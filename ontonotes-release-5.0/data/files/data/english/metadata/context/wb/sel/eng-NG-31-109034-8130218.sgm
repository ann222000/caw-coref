VDH: Barbara Tuchman dies

Barbara Tuchman was the granddaughter of Henry Morgenthau, Sr. and
daughter of Maurice Wertheim, who bought &quot;The Nation&quot; for a song.
Tuchman was educated at Radcliffe College, graduating in 1935, going
on to work in Tokyo and around the world, publishing her first book in
1938, &quot;The Lost British Policy.&quot; She was perhaps more famous for &quot;The
Guns of August&quot; and &quot;Stillwell and the American Experience in China&quot;
which won her the Pulitzer in 1962 and 1971, as well as &quot;The Distant
Mirror&quot; and &quot;The March of Folly.&quot;

Along with CV Wedgwood, she is the proverbial godmother of SHWI. So,
during her globe-trotting before the Second World War, she is on the
wrong ship, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and is washed
overboard, her body never to be found. Maurice and his wife grieve.
Tuchman's would-be husband never meets her, and his life burbles
onward.

What happens to the art of history writing without Barbara Tuchman?
Which books win instead of &quot;The Guns of August&quot; and &quot;Stillwell&quot;? What
does JFK read during the Thirteen Days?

Other thoughts?

I really, really hope the oft-told Tuchman story is apocryphal.
Namely, the story that it was &quot;The Guns of August&quot; that single-
handedly convinced JFK to go cautiously during the Cuban
Missile Crisis, because of the example of out-of-control
mobilization schedules. If it's true...well, fill in the rest.

If it's not true, the first effect I can think of is less nostalgia
for the Belle Epoque. _The Guns of August_ is largely
responsible for the myth of the division between the
happy, wise Belle Epoque and and the violent totalitarian
20th Century (ignoring that WWI was a Belle Epoque war,
and showed what clowns the Belle Epoque leadership
were). _The Guns of August_ doesn't entirely support
the myth, but that's the part that gets known (_The Proud
Tower_,  IIRC, doesn't support it either).

For alternate historians that JFK can admire, there's
always the usual suspects: Carlyle, Trevor-Roper,
A.J.P Taylor,.Durant, et al. Maybe Prescott too.
And Gibbon. Lots of GIbbon.

I'm not sure how pop history writing goes without her,
but then, I'm one of those who never liked Tuchman
all that much. _The Guns of August_ always struck
me as hypocritical and racist. So I'm not the best judge
here.

Yeah, I think not. Though it is a convenient way to shorthand the
decision-making process then. I feel like things would still go well,
given that Bobby kept telling Jack not to be America's Tojo, and so
on.

Or, at least, a flavor of it. I feel like the end of the British
Empire is still going to create the sort of emotional vacuum into
which people like SM Stirling will get sucked. I'm fairly sure the
Belle Epoque circle jerk will keep going without Tuchman, given that
Kipling's poetry is around. OTOH, what we could see is a cleaving
between British and American visions of the Belle Epoque, where the
former misses it and dreams of it, while American pop history has a
more realistic tilt. Or perhaps a more americentric one. Alt 1960's
and 1970's pop history sees lots of books about the post-bellum era
and the creation of the American Empire. Hmm, that might not be so
good.

The latter seemed to be a lot harder on Europe than the former. OTOH,
I read PT four or five years ago.

I dunno enough about the industry then to have a good sense of how it
progresses, but I feel like &quot;A World Lit Only By Fire&quot; being the pop
tome for medieval Europe rather than &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; is plain bad
news bears.

It's very much a product of her times and upbringing. Which is not to
say that racisim is OK, but it's relatively understandable, and the
work is still good in a number of ways, though, for example, &quot;The
First Salute&quot; not so much.

Is there another popular American historian from that period who was
not an academic whose books are still reprinted all over the place now
that they're dead?

I always thought nostalgia for the Belle Epoque
started as soon as it became clear that the overthrow
of the old Europe in 1914-18 wasn't going to usher in
anything better, ie almost at once, and more so from
the 1930s.

Even going so far as to offer AH speculation of
her own, an interesting little essay titled &quot;If Mao
Had Gone To Washington,&quot; speculating about
FDR establishing normal relations with Chinese
communists in 1945 (a possibility described at
length in Duncan Brack's AH anthology, President Gore &amp; Other Things
That Never Happened).

While I have nothing useful to contribute to this
particular thread (i.e., Tuchman dying early), I've
always wondered why her Mao essay has never
been the topic of SHWI banter (my Googles on
&quot;Tuchman,&quot; &quot;Mao,&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; turn up
nothing). It just seems like something people
would be discussing here. Any thoughts, folks?

Never been, thank Jesus. But a quick trip to the Wiki is, as ever,
fascinating.

As it turns out, Mainstreet USA is based on Marceline, Missouri, the
boyhood town of our Nazi-loving mouse-drawer; it revives it, with some
additions and alterations, based on the time he spent there. This sort
of nostalgia is distinct from the sort of weird &quot;Yay big pink map!&quot;
stuff that comes later, as it is a more fundamentally universal theme
to have fuzzyheaded feelings for your childhood home, wherever it may
be.

^^^^^^^^^^^
ITYM Barbara. Barbra Streisand or perhaps St. Barbra are, of course,
unrelated entire to this particular project. But anyway, it's just
plain odd to refer to her by her first name.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and I think it reflects the deep desire to romanticize the pre-

And while I think that's a current or a &quot;meme&quot; run amok in certain
factions of society in the postwar world, it's not necessarily an
American one, nor one that should establish itself much as one.
Certainly, the boys and girls who grew up between 1923 and 1939 in the
USA would feel a little pressed, but their hardship doesn't constitute
a hill of beans compared to a Welsh miner or a French Jew.

Plus, generalizations are tricky creatures, Mike, and I think, while
there's going to be something going in the Anglosphere, it's certainly
possible to posit an Americocentric movement to develop in the postwar
ebullience of the US. It would be easy to tap into the 1890-1910 era
to encourage a sense of America's &quot;Republican Burden&quot; to defend the
world against lesser, less pleasant -isms that are more oppressive,
and so on. To develop a narrative sense of a particularly American
Century starting with the annexation of the Philipines on, to talk
about a rise of liberty and a defeat of one evil (imperialism) as a
dry run for the defeat of (fascism) leading to the global struggle
against (communism) without any particular handwringing for the post-
bellum era of US history. Who would want to think about Indian raids
and the Freeman's Bureau, when there are much better things to
remember? It'd blend in very well with Camelot, mind, and rachet up
all the way through 1968 or 1973.

Certainly. But the tangible dissolution of the European Empires and
the creation of the bipolar world after 1945 would further that
feeling, and give it deeper strength and meaning, covered by nostalgia
and grief in the various former imperial metropoles and so on. That
feeling, of course, doesn't have to be shared back in the US, which
has been doing great guns since the Maine blew up, and such.

Will? He did teach at Seton Hall and Columbia, although his academic
career
was not particularly long lasting. He was as much of an academic as
Charles
Beard, whose teaching career was similarly brief - and who still has
at least
one book still in print (&quot;An Economic Interpretation of the
Constitution&quot;)

Ariel wasn't, but considering that she was 15 when she married Will
(who at
the time was teaching in the private high school she attended, after
he left his
post at Seton Hall), no big surprise she never got into academia.

Quite. But in a paragraph trading in memes or vast cultural
experience, the feelings of Blacks, Hispanics, and Eastern European

Identical. The idea would be to somehow subsume the Belle Epoque stuff
which is such a fetish in a more &quot;Whig-American&quot; grand march of
Republican Progress sort of thing. What would you think would be a
likely alternative if not the Belle Epoque hand-wringing and so on?

Without experiencing small town America, Disney's not quite the

However, in TTL, his family could wind up in Berrien County, Michigan,

In OTL, Disney was horrified by the more urban amusement parks typical

etc.) , and probably not only for their rundown condition but also
because of
them being filled with ethnicities he may have found less than

Judging by 1940s-50s Mexican cinema, which was widely screened in
Hispanic neighborhoods in the US as well as throughout the Spanish
speaking of world, there was nostalgia for the &quot;belle epoque
mexicaine&quot;
of the Porfiriato. And nostalgia for pre-1898 Spanish-ruled Puerto
Rico
has always had appeal to a certain segment of Puerto Rican society ;
the sons of the plantation owners ruined by the Spanish-American war
played
a substantial role in formulating the independence movement. Such
nostalgia, however, is probably closer to Confederate nostalgia than
to
belle epoque nostalgia, as it idealizes the rural plantation rather
than a
sophisticated city life.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; And exactly how different is that from OTL's mid-20th century American
&gt; &gt; historiography?

&gt; Identical. The idea would be to somehow subsume the Belle Epoque stuff

&gt; Republican Progress sort of thing. What would you think would be a
&gt; likely alternative if not the Belle Epoque hand-wringing and so on?

A weaker conservative wing of the GOP post-WW2? Bob Taft's cancer
fells
him in 1943 rather than 1953. An earlier decline of the &quot;Old Right&quot;? A
1946
election in which the Dems keep at least one branch of Congress
instead
of losing both houses? This one baffles me a bit, just because it's
an
intensification of OTL rather than an actual ATL.

Speaking of Disney: I think either an earlier death for Walt or my TL
in which he moves production to the UK to take advantage of the
devalued pound and the currency transfer laws (&quot;The Disney Animation
Studios of England') might have some influence on the postwar pop
culture.

Another pop culture influence: many of Hollywood's depictions of the
Belle Epoque were the work of Central European Jews, some of whom
had fled before Hitler (e.g. Erich von Stroheim, Ernst Lubitsch) and
others who had left post-'33. However, a TL in which they stay in
Europe (particularly a TL in which they are able to work in Germany
and Austria in the 1930s) produces a series of knock ons and
butterflies
going far beyond this WI.

That was basically what I figured - marginally more academic than
Pierre Berton (who was essentially a journalist rather than a
historian) but nowhere near as strong academically as say JL
Granatstein.

Wiki says he taught Latin, French, English and geometry at Seton Hall
while his work at Columbia seems to be in philosophy. Given he also
served as librarian one can call him many things but not a
professional historian.

This would be in stark contrast to someone like Anthony Beevor who
started as an army officer who earned the credentials of an academic
historian (which is essentially Granatstein's career path before he
left academia and ended up heading the Canadian War Museum).

&gt; &gt; If it's not true, the first effect I can think of is
&gt; less nostalgia
&gt; &gt; for the Belle Epoque. _The Guns of August_ is
&gt; largely
&gt; &gt; responsible for the myth of the division between the
&gt; &gt; happy, wise Belle Epoque and and the violent
&gt; totalitarian
&gt; &gt; 20th Century (ignoring that WWI was a Belle Epoque
&gt; war,
&gt; &gt; and showed what clowns the Belle Epoque leadership
&gt; &gt; were). _The Guns of August_ doesn't entirely support
&gt; &gt; the myth, but that's the part that gets known (_The
&gt; Proud
&gt; &gt; Tower_,  IIRC, doesn't support it either).

&gt; I always thought nostalgia for the Belle Epoque
&gt; started as soon as it became clear that the overthrow
&gt; of the old Europe in 1914-18 wasn't going to usher in
&gt; anything better, ie almost at once, and more so from
&gt; the 1930s.
">

Depends on among what kind of people. Some had
obvious reasons to be nostalgic (old-guard British
Tories, Russian Whites, etc.) Others were never
nostalgic -- Lytton Strachey became a best-seller
with a character assassination of Eminent Victorians.
Then there's the sort of neo-nostalgia you get in, say,
George Orwell, who thought the Belle Epoque was a
nightmare and a disgrace, but that it was better than
what came later.

But Tuchman has created a different kind of nostalgia.
_The Guns of August_ is pretty clearly written with
World War II in mind even though it's officially about
World War I. With phrases like &quot;the first of many
years Europeans would spend hiding in cellars,&quot; she
helped build the myth that WWI had nothing to do
with what came before, that it was part of the new age
of war and totalitarianism -- unlike what it actually was,
a war fought by Belle Epoque leaders with Belle Epoque
institutions. And the related myth that WWI swept
away the Belle Epoque by random cataclysm, unlike
what really happened -- it swept away the Belle Epoque
because nobody wanted the leadership that had created
WWI.

Again, _The Guns of August_ itself doesn't entirely
support the myth -- it makes clear that the disasters
were due to shoddy systems that put the likes of
Kaiser Bill and Rennenkampf in charge. But that's
not the part that gets remembered.

It's not me, it's Carlos, whose knowledge of China and the South
Pacific convinced me that Diamond was playing an aggressive shell
game. Plus, anyone who tries to sell you a unified theory of
everything is likely going to offer to sell you a bridge. But Doug
Muir does it best:

&quot;No, I dislike Diamond because he's sloppy.  He always was, but after
his stuff
started getting popular he became /really/ sloppy.

&quot;He regularly throws out unsupported speculations as valid theories,
theories
as facts, and (repeatedly) anecdotes as evidence.  He long ago reached
the
point where even a popular science magazine should be cite-checking,
fact-checking, and generally getting him to chill out and color inside
the
lines... but he's a NYT list author now, so they dassn't.

&quot;But it's got holes in it that you can watch TV through.  There are
issues of
fact (where he says stuff is so that isn't)**, issues of logic (where
he makes
arguments that are fallacious), and -- repeatedly and egregiously --
issues of
exposition (where he tells only one side of a story and/or completely
ignores
stuff that doesn't fit his pet theory).

&quot;I had fun with _Third Chimpanzee_ and _Guns, Germs and Steel_, but a
lot of
the fun was picking holes, finding flaws, and mentally arguing with
the
author.  I've been repeatedly unnerved by how many people seem to take
both
books as Holy Writ.

&quot;Also, fame does not seem to have been good for Diamond.  He seems to
have gone from &quot;basically likable blowhard&quot; to &quot;insufferably pompous
ass&quot;. Pity.&quot;

More specifically:

&quot;Guns, Germs -- He's got plenty of valid points about why the New
World was
relatively disadvantaged WRT domesticable plants and animals, compared
to the
Old.

However, he goes way, way too far with his claims that the Old World
suffered
from a &quot;vertical&quot; geographical orientation rather than a &quot;horizontal&quot;
one.
Given the technological level of the American civilizations -- late
Neolithic
-- domestic plants and animals were spreading just about as quickly as
they
had been at the equivalent point in Old World history.

When Old World civilizations were in the late Neolithic -- say, in the
fourth
millenium BCE -- most of the Old World crops and domestic animals that
Diamond
goes on about were not even close to being universally spread
throughout the
civilized belt of Eurasia.

The post-Conquest history of the New World suggests yet another hole
in
Diamond's &quot;vertical orientation&quot; theory.  The Spanish quickly built up
water
transportation networks in the Caribbean and along the Pacific coasts
of
Central and South America.  By the 17th century, these had resulted in
a
startling degree of ecological uniformity across a very wide area; all
the
major food crops were growing everywhere they could grow, and Eurasian
domestic animals were everywhere from Patagonia to Colorado.

The Native Americans were already starting to build water trade
networks;
South Americans sailed along the Pacific coast up to Central America,
and
Mesoamerican trade goods reached as far north as the Ohio.  Several
food
crops, most notably corn, had already spread along these trade
routes... often
undergoing considerable changes along the way.

The best that can be said of Diamonds argument here is that he
simplifies a
complex interweaving of cause and effect (fewer domesticable plants
and
animals --&gt; slower development of cities and advanced technology --&gt;
less
trade and slower development of advanced travel technology --&gt; slower
diffusion of what plants and animals there were) and reduces it to a
fairly
simplistic, and seriously flawed, piece of geographical determinism.&quot;

This is all under the thread &quot;Jared Diamond.&quot; But, yeah, bones gnawed
by interstellar leopard-baboon. Points for those who get the
reference.

Now, back to your regularly scheduled programming.

Disney was extremely right wing, and certainly did have ethnic and
racial
prejudices - that can't be denied. Whether the intensity of his
prejudices
qualified him as a raving, full blown racist is open to debate. I
wouldn't
considered him to have been a virulent racist, more likely a racist of
a
milder type. For example, as objectionable as we find &quot;Song of the
South&quot; or the various cartoons involving certain stereotypes today,
they're
not &quot;Birth Of A Nation&quot;. However, it's possible that Disney's racism
may
have been tempered by what was commercially viable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; likely alternative if not the Belle Epoque hand-wringing and so on?

&gt; &gt; A weaker conservative wing of the GOP post-WW2? Bob Taft's cancer
&gt; &gt; fells him in 1943 rather than 1953. An earlier decline of the &quot;Old Right&quot;? A
&gt; &gt; 1946 election in which the Dems keep at least one branch of Congress
&gt; &gt; instead of losing both houses? This one baffles me a bit, just because it's
&gt; &gt; an intensification of OTL rather than an actual ATL.

&gt; Oh, I think we could get it done by giving more power the Dulles
&gt; Brothers wing of the GOP sooner. Their weird mix of righteous
&gt; religious crusade against communism, complete with brittle zeal, and
&gt; their disgusting vision of American domination of the globe. Plus
&gt; crippling the Wise Men; Acheson-Harriman-Bohlen's cosmopolitan
&gt; internationalism would cut too much against scaled-up Dulles-American
&gt; wankery.

A Dulles fully unleashed probably means getting rid of Ike, or at
least
his presidency. Perhaps a Dewey victory in '48? Although I'm not 100%
sure Dewey would appoint J.F. Dulles at State, he certainly couldn't
restrain him like Ike was able to do, not having quite the same
gravitas.

&gt; &gt; Another pop culture influence: many of Hollywood's depictions of the
&gt; &gt; Belle Epoque were the work of Central European Jews, some of whom
&gt; &gt; had fled before Hitler (e.g. Erich von Stroheim, Ernst Lubitsch) and
&gt; &gt; others who had left post-'33. However, a TL in which they stay in
&gt; &gt; Europe (particularly a TL in which they are able to work in Germany
&gt; &gt; and Austria in the 1930s) produces a series of knock ons and
&gt; &gt; butterflies going far beyond this WI.

&gt; It'd also probably mean liquidating Hitler.

That's what I was referring to. Then we're in territory beyond the

of this WI but which is all too familiar in SHWI.

I understand what you're saying. The respectable racist, the type who
would
consider the KKK or the Black Hundreds to be for the vulgar masses,
but
who nevertheless shares their views (and makes their existence
possible).
There never would have been a Klan if not for the southern elite
sharing their views and giving them free reign, even if they didn't
directly
participate (or distanced themselves once things got out of control,
like
Nathan Bedford Forrest)

Aesthetically, it makes perfect sense. Disney was nothing if not an
absolute idealist - an aesthetic fascist so as to speak. And he
probably related to the politics on some level.

I've never seen the original uncensored version, though I have seen
some of the aforementioned films with some pretty bad stereotypes
of African Americans. Reportedly the original cut of &quot;Fantasia&quot; had
some brief minstrel show type content, which was deleted upon its
1955 re-release.

Assuredly, the devastation caused by the Revolution had something to
do with this genre's existence. It didn't seem to survive the '50s,
however.
It seemed to have ended with the general decline of Mexican cinema in
the late '50s.

ObWI: Pedro Infante doesn't crash his private plane five minutes after
takeoff in Merida on April 15, 1957, and successfully flies back to
Mexico City. In OTL, Infante's death signalled the end of Mexican
cinema's Golden Age. In TTL, the biggest male star in the Spanish
speaking world survives (perhaps even to the present ; he'd be 89
if still alive). While there were clear cut signs that the &quot;Epoca de
Oro del Cine Mexicano&quot; was coming to an end - with William Jenkins
monopolizing exhibition and most of the studios closing, and the rise
of the &quot;churro&quot; (B movie) given the shrinking availability of funds -
Infante dying was seen as the end of an era. So, does the golden
age of Mexican cinema last longer with a living Infante? (My guess
is that TV eventually will have an impact - but what percentage of
Mexico's population in the late 1950s owned televisions? At most
the Golden Age lasts well into the '60s, but eventually ends. Once
Pedro gets hired by the Azcarragas to star in a telenovela for
Telesistema - Televisa after '72 -  then the golden age is over. )

I can't see Ike losing a presidential election in a TL in which his

OK, some events a little different from OTL. What would constitute
victory, however? The capitulation of Kim Il-Sung and a unified
Korea under Synghman Rhee? Or an earlier cease fire? Under those
circumstances, I could imagine a MacArthur victory in '52 if he runs.
