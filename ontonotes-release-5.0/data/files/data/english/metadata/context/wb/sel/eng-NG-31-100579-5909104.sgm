Something I posted in this forum about locations used by the BBC for
their M R James' GHOST STORIES FOR CHRISTMAS:

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/alt.books.ghost-fiction/msg/c5c346e8...

A few days later, 'Ghosts &amp; Scholars' laid claim to one of the
discoveries:

"...Happisburgh, which played host as Seaburgh church in 'A Warning to
the Curious'."

http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/News.html

I've noted that 'Ghosts &amp; Scholars' associates have quietly filched
several pieces of information from me over the years. No doubt they
will soon be claiming to have discovered that James' THE ASH-TREE was
inspired by the Rev A.D. Crake's THREE BLACK CATS  after their silly
attempts to bash the discovery have fallen by the wayside.

I'm deeply flattered by your interest, Mr &amp; Mrs Pardoe, but I'm sure
that your old chum 'Monty' would have argued 'credit where credit's
due'.

If you read the Ghost and Scholars news item they are quoting an email
from a third party who had visited the location.... hardly "laying

What an extraordinary claim. The G &amp; S News page clearly states:

&lt;&lt; Eddie Brazil has e-mailed about a visit he paid to East Anglia this
summer: "trying to find Jamesian locations from the stories based in
Suffolk and also from the TV adaptions":

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    &quot;As always the illusion of art is far more satisfying than the disappointment of reality.
">

Both Felixstowe and Aldeburgh were too crowded to get that 'bleak and
solemn' feel; as was Norwich Cathedral, used as Barchester in 'Stalls
of Barchester'. We made it up to Happisburgh, which played host as
Seaburgh church in 'A Warning to the Curious'. &gt;&gt;

So, Mr Brazil  visited Happisburgh during his summer (loosely defined,
I guess, as being between June and the end of August) holiday, and
Chris Barker posted a reference to Happisburgh on 12 September.

1. How does this constitute 'filching'?

2. There is no Mr Pardoe. There is a Dr Pardoe, who has little or
nothing to do with Ghosts &amp; Scholars.

3. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the Revd. Crake's
story inspired anything. Haven't we already worked that silly theory
to death?

On a point of fact, Chris, and (for what it's worth) in my capacity as
Assistant Editor of G&amp;S, I for one didn't actually need to read your
post to know that Happisburgh was used as one of the locations for the
BBC's "A Warning To The Curious".  During a very pleasant holiday in
Norfolk round about this time of year in 2004, I explored all that
North Norfolk coast from Yarmouth round to Hunstanton, taking in
Happisburgh along the way before it vanishes like Dunwich beneath the
waves.  I had my picture taken in the cloisters of "Barchester
Cathedral" while I was at it - some twenty-two years after I first went
to live in Norwich, and fell prey to East Anglia's, er, *peculiar*
charm.  I mentioned my trip to both Rosemary &amp; Darroll Pardoe, ad I'm
fairly sure that I specifically mentioned Happisburgh in that context.
Then again, it's entirely possible that they already knew: certainly I
know that David Rowlands was more than au fait with the railway line
which features in the programme in question, because he wrote and told
me all about it when I was planning my trip.

Anyway: I ramble.  Mr Brazil evidently made a similar trip to mine, and
was good enough to e-mail G&amp;S with an account of his findings; so
please believe me when I say that no plagiarism of your findings should
be inferred from the coincidence of his e-mail's receipt and your own
posting at a.b.g-f.  Actually, the Pardoes don't spend a lot of their
time at this particular node of t' Net, so I very much doubt they'd
have read it here anyway.

Yes, yes, yes. And I could argue that I first made the link several
years ago and cite the fact that I mentioned it to my wife at the time.

The fact remains that the first public reference to Happisburgh
possessing the church used in the film came from me. Ditto for the fact
that I have spoken to someone who actually recalled the filming taking
place in this area, specifically along the sand dunes and beach which
stretch from Holkham to Wells. Has anyone at G&amp;S ever spoken to anyone
involved in the original film about the locations used? I doubt it or
you would have said by now.

People may well indeed come out of the woodwork to argue that they had
the discovery themselves last summer / last year / ten years ago, but
the fact remains that no one bothered saying so in public, whether it
be in a publication or the internet.

So, incredibly minor issue that it is, it is correct to say that I was
the first person to publicise the fact that Happisburgh church features
in the BBC production of 'A Warning To The Curious'. Thus if anyone
future G&amp;S newsletter seeks to argue otherwise it would not only be
wrong, but it would suggest that 'scholarliness' is a secondary
consideration after cronyism.

There is a wealth of evidence to support this claim. However, it is
very well-known that you would rather cut your own hand off than
acknowledge that I - a staunch critic of your managament of the Ghost
Story Society - have made an important Jamesian discovery.

Those who know about M R James know that you and Rosemary Pardoe and
various other Jamesian idolators have for years claimed that an
Erckmann-Chatrian tale which featured a water crab must have inspired
'The Ash-tree' for no other reason than James was known to have liked
their work. Yet the similarities between the two tales are so weak as
to be completely untenable. In contrast, the similarities between 'The
Ash-tree' and the 'Three Black Cats' are strikingly vivid. Thus by your
own inconsistent method of analysis you come unstuck.

Reggie Oliver has referred to me on more than one occasion as something
of a Jamesian expert. Bearing in mind that Reggie is a qualified
historian who actually went to the same school as James, knowing much
about James from a young age, I rather think his unbiased and informed
opinion is worth sigificantly more than your ignorant and very heavily
prejudiced view.

It is highly likely that James' cribbed from Crake's tale: accept it
and move on. Who knows, the next discovery may be yours.

&gt; CR
">

Actually, the M.H. James title is called BOGIE TALES OF EAST ANGLIA.
And yes, there is a good case for arguing that M.R. James had a hand in
authoring this spoof of the veridical ghost story.

However, for the reasons stated, I am also quite certain that M R James
plundered Crake's THE THREE BLACK CATS for inspiration for THE
ASH-TREE, as I am sure critics will come to accept during the passage
of years. As you have a whole array of rather unpleasant reasons for
wishing to pooh-pooh the discovery, I also believe that your reputation
and integrity will be undermined.

You seem incapable of tolerating other people's opinions, both when
they do not accord with your own, and when the proposer refuses to
supplicate him or herself at your feet. However, you do not 'own' M R
James, and nor are your views on M R James in anyway definitive. The
position you should be taking is to politely state that you disagree
with my speculations, whilst allowing them to stand as independent
arguments which should be both respected and acknowledged. Instead of
this, you abuse your position as 'owner' of the Ghost Story Society to
pour unpleasant and ill-motivated scorn upon every and anything I have
ever said about M R James, whilst claiming rather fraudulently that you
aren't engaged in a personal vendetta.

Let's review the evidence.

1. I am not alone in arguing that LGC's BBC adaption of LOST HEARTS
intuited a dark theme of child abuse in the original tale, and
amplified it accordingly. Indeed, a critic for one of the highbrow
newspapers wrote that it 'hinted bleakly at child abuse'. In response,
you have ranted and raved about how absurd my view is, suggesting that
I must be sick in the head for holding the views I have, even going to
the preposterous lengths of writing to the journalist concerned to
demand she expand upon her views. Yet all you have to do is accept that
some people do have concerns about aspects of James work, notably those
which appear to hint at dark Freudian undertones. Bizarrely, you are
scathingly intolerant of such views, deeming them some sort of vague
attack upon your business empire which comprises Ashtree Press and
Ghost Story Society.

2. My contention that James plundered the Crake tale is a strong one.
First, there are the very strong comparisons between the two tales.
Second, there is evidence which proves that James was desperately
casting about for inspiration to find an extra tale to fill the
collection it eventually appeared in. Third, there is the similarity
between James' working title for the book and Crake's. Fourth, there is
an identical quoting of judiciary opinions at the beginning of both
tales both of which reference witchcraft. Fifth, there is the fact that
Crake explicitly states that his tale has been handed down his own
family line, not that it is a general piece of folklore. Yet despite
all of this, you and your friend Rosemary Pardoe have gone to quite
extraordinary lengths to pooh-pooh the discovery for no other reason
than I made it, inclusive of the commissioning of negative pieces and
reviews by obvious cronies.

3. BOGIE TALES OF EAST ANGLIA is an obvious spoof and was published at
the same time that James was spoofing ghost stories in various
Cambridge journals. It mirrors the satire James was authoring elsewhere
right down to the amusing mimicry of working class East Anglian
accents. The index references fictional ghost stories by only one other
party, Erckmann-Chatrian, two of James' favourite writers. What's more,
apart from one misleading or possibly ingenuous reference to an M H
James in one of James' own reference books, there is no reference to an
M H James anywhere else in the annals of literature.

4. The spoof article THE GHOSTOLOGISTS IN CONCLAVE which appeared in
The May Bee is again quite likely to have been by M R James. Yet just
as with BOGIE TALES, you have demomstrated an extremely vehement
refusal to even countenance the suggestion, a strength of conviction
which is excessive and misplaced.

So you see, your position is both intolerant and extreme. I therefore
care little for your opinion or your obstinate, wilfull ignorance,
because I know that sooner or later, you will fall by the wayside and
others more professional and broad-minded will come along. One day a
decent and authoritative assessment of M R James's ghost stories will
be published, and it will include a broad spectrum of ideas and
speculations. I don't know whan that will be nor who will collate it,
but I do now this: you could never hope to manage the project because
you are crippled by self-interest and prejudice.

This thread is so frustratingly *you*, Chris. By which I mean to say
that it highlights some of your erratic and nasty tendencies. I would
certainly agree that this appears to be an "incredibly minor issue".
But frankly, I doubt that anyone would have so much as raised an
eyebrow if you had simply engaged in a minor bit of puffery, making the
innocuous point that you realized the connection between the
Happisburgh locale and the telecast of "Warning". But oh, no, that's
never enough for you. First, you make it sound as though you've
uncovered some sort of esoteric, arcane lore. Then, in your typically
noxious style, you have to accuse others of "filching" this factoid as
though you had somehow trademarked it. And not that it really matters,
but for the record you're not the first person to have made mention of
this connection on the Internet.

And I thought you were going to confine this kind of crap to your
Yahoo! Site.

Yrs,

Michael

Which would still not invalidate the truth of my statement above.
Would it?

I don't believe anyone's suggested otherwise, have they?  Your original
posting *seemed*, unless I read it all wrong, to be suggesting that G&amp;S
nicked the information re: Happisburgh from your a.b.g-f post, whereas
anyone who takes the trouble to look on the G&amp;S website will see its
actual provenance:

http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/News.html

Now, nowhere on the G&amp;S website will you find the claim that
Happisburgh church = "Seaburgh" church is original, never-before
published information.  A G&amp;S reader thought it worth his while to
write in and share his holidaying experiences, that's all.  We get
quite a lot of that, and it's always welcome to hear from subscribers.

No, nobody has.  You're all exclusive there, and no mistake.

I certainly didn't.  An awful oversight on my part, but I'll have to
live with it.

Yes, you certainly were.  But, as I pointed out above, no-one said you
weren't.

Well, if we're going the unfettered-speculation route: IF you were to
suggest that I'm planning to sacrifice twenty-three virgins to my cruel
demon gods this Hallowe'en, that would be wrong too, wouldn't it?  But
I'm sure you WON'T claim that.  Similarly, I doubt that G&amp;S will be
jumping your claim on the Happisburgh exclusive.  Rest easy.

It's a pity that you hadn't adopted this stance a few years ago. The
ABGF archives are littered with a series of ad hominem attacks by you
(and others), many of which were made in reponse to my arguing an
alternative viewpoint.

The behaviour of David Anderson, Jessica Salmonson, R.J. Warren, John
Pelan, you and your wife set new standards in malicious abuse and
professional hypocrisy. If I posted some of the highlights of your
collective responses to my publishing ventures and literary
speculations, I think many people would be appalled by your behaviour.

However, although I did not ever sink to your depths, and in spite of
my believing that you are currently faking a more reasonable stance
because you have future business interests to protect elsewhere, I
accept that I have often contributed to the conflict.

Oh, tut, tut, Mr Barker. People in glasshouses, and all that. And you
