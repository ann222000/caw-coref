I there any simple way to adapt a parallel port printer to a network?

I'd like to move a printer to a closet and get it out of the way.

Google for printservers.  For example:

Go to any computer store and ask for a &quot;HP JetDirect Print Server&quot;.
Won't be really cheap, these tend to be sold to corporate customers
with really heavy duty printers they want to share over their
corporate network, not folks with old printers sitting in the closet.
I think the HP 170x series starts around $150.

HP printers that aren't hopelessly old or low-end can take a JetDirect
card that plugs in a slot in the back.

Don't you have the SMC Barricade router like I do? It should have a LPT
port built in. Might be useful if you can live with a somewhat generic
driver and your printer isn't too exotic.

I'll have to do the same thing for a little HP-5L here because the new
puter don't have no LPT port no more :-(

The big one is a Brother 7820N which dwelleth on a LAN port, Very practical.

Put the printer, plus a networked computer (with a parallel port!
that's very important!), monitor, keyboard, and mouse in the closet.
Make sure nothing is obstructing the computer's ventilation holes.
Enable file and print sharing on the computer.  When you want to print
a document from your laptop, walk over to the closet and power up the
computer and printer.

Or just buy a print server, as Mr. Shah brilliantly suggested.

As other have mentioned, what you want is a print server.  Here's the list of
what Newegg has, sorted by &quot;best ratings:&quot;
http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N;=201013038... .
Ignore the USB-only ones (which these days are more popular than parallel port
versions!), of course, and decide whether you want it to be wireless or not
for the network connectivity.

I've only had a few over time, having instead switched to printers with the
network interface built-in over the past few years. :-)  I do know that the
D-Link DP-301P+ and Netgear PS101 are popular models -- they're likely to be
available at, e.g., Best Buy of Fry's.  My mother has one of the Buffalo
LPV3-U2 which has worked well for her, but that's a USB-only model.

Yep.  But it's croaking... reboot required more than once per day.

If you're looking to replace the 1120C (nice printer, certainly), an OfficeJet
K850DN (D=duplexing, N=networked) is what I have and I've been pretty happy
with it.  The only surprise was that it's actually slower than many
letter-sized printers -- I guess there isn't as much competition for speed in
thiese larger-format printers.

Maybe reflash the EEPROM in there? Might be worth to download the latest
firmware and give it a shot. I've heard people with older models had
problems requiring frequent rebooting and this fixed it at least for
some of them.

My wife caught me talking to myself (sometimes I'm the only one who
will listen!) while I was in the shower.  I said, &quot;two cents&quot;.  So she
asked me what that was all about.  I told her I was doing an economic
analysis; $50 for a print server, versus a maximum of two cents' worth
of electricity, each time I fire up the server in my office, if I
print a document from my laptop.

$50... two cents... $50... two cents...

Nice!  How well does the duplexing work?

The 1120C is my wife's and has seen HEAVY duty printing Girl Scout
stuff ;-)  So it's feed mechanism is wearing out.

I would use one of your network computers, one that is not used all that
heavily as the print server.

Install the printer normally and then share it with your local network. If
you don't have a working parallel port on the computer, USB to parallel
(bi-directional) converters can be had fairly inexpensively.

All users should be able to use the printer (or not as you set permissions).

Quite well; I haven't had any problem with it.  The only thing to be aware of
is that, since it's an ink jet, after it prints side 1 it just sits there
waiting for the ink to dry before it pulls it back in and prints the second
side.  That makes it slower to print, e.g., 10 duplex sheet than to perform
manual duplexing (print all the odd pages, flip the stack over, print all the
even pages), but it's still worth it to me (I guess I'm usually not in that
big of a hurry...).

For 13&quot;x19&quot;, I've found that it is sensitive to paper alignment: It is
possible to load the paper crooked enough that it'll just sit there and ram
the paper into the side of the carriage, eventually ripping it.  I've learned
to be careful about this (besides loading the paper and straight as possible,
the trick seems to be allowing a little bit of play in the paper guide -- not
having it jammed all the way up right next to the paper's edge) and haven't
torn a sheet in quite some time.  It reminds me of the older D-sized HP roll
paper plotters that had the exact same problem -- if you didn't get the paper
very, very close to perfectly square, the paper would slowly drift towards the
edge and eventually rip.

You can get little print server boxes for &lt;$70. DLink, and others,
make them. If your printer is an HP and it can scan, then you need a
HP Jetdirect print server for $300, or whatever they cost these days,
to support the bidirectional communications.

Ink jet can get rather expensive for high-volume users like Jim's wife.

Sounds familiar.  I made an external guide for the straight thru feed
on the 1120C to ensure squareness... particularly an issue with card
stock.

Google &quot;parallel print server&quot; ... quite a selection of products are

Yes, certainly true.  The K850 series do use large ink tanks, so at least it's
cheap relative to most other inkjets.  (Hence it's cheaper than cheap laser
printers, albeit unlikely to be cheaper than true business-class lasers.)

If you've got an old dinosaur PC lying around, you could turn it into a

How 'bout getting this plus a USB-LPT adapter:

http://www.lantronix.com/device-networking/external-device-servers/ub...

USB-LPT used to be available at Walmart for under $20 but their web site
seems to be toast right now. Again. No idea if such a combo works but
per the Lantronix ad there is a good chance that it might. Then you
could hang all kinds of other stuff onto this box.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I there any simple way to adapt a parallel port printer to a network?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to move a printer to a closet and get it out of the way.

&gt;&gt;Buy a new one that is already networked! Cheaper and Simpler!!

&gt;&gt;I am happy with my Canon PIXMA IP4000R.

&gt; Just ordered an hp LaserJet P2015DN, but I have also an old hp1120C
&gt; and a Stika stencil cutter that I'd like to get off of my desk.

Well, HP has a nice solution: The HP Jetdirect 170x. They have more, more
expensive solutions as well. My local computer store has much cheaper
parallel printer servers. (About 50 Euro). Personally I fired up an old
WIN98 engine with some adapter cards. It served me well for the printers.
The scanner gave some problems however.

Buy a 50 foot (or whatever it takes, that was the longest one I recall
seeing when I bought a 25 foot one last year to solve a similar problem)
parallel printer cable, unless you have some other reason to want to
network it - but if the logical PC as print server is not also going to
live in the closet, it still might be the cheaper solution.

If that seems like an expensive solution, shop better - some places
charge way too much for cables.

did you look on the back and see if it has a P-port?
mine does.
of course, I only have a 8 port with a WAN port, but I also have a 9

I got high speed at the house.
Got kind of slow how ever, when the kids wanted to down load MP3's

The most simple way is to buy a wireless or ethernet print server ($40 to

similar options that also don't require the printer to be connected to a

I have boxes of parallel printer cables stacked in the storage
building. Let me know if anyone needs any.  Standard, and long ones,
free, if you pay shipping.

Also, there are plenty of DB25 and DE9 serial cables in various
lengths.  The same deal, you only pay for shipping, if you can use
them.  When I get caught up on the 'Computers for Veterans' project, I
am going to thin the cable herd, and sell the scrap copper.

If your PC's are on a lan and all running windows(linux may support it too)
you can use printer sharing.  Printer only needs to be hooked up to one pc
and the rest can print to it.  In this case you don't even need to buy
anything.
