Robert Bosch was born in 1860, the son of a farmer.

He invented the spark plug, and went on to found a successful German
based multinational
corporation.

Bosch was an early opponent of Hitler, and hired some German civil
servants dismissed by the
Nazi government.

Bosch even sent Carl Goerdler and others, traveling under the guise of
company business to drum
up allied assistance to assassinate Hitler.

Bosch refused to accept awards from the Nazi government.

The Bosch corporation had its own, "soap opera"with the Nazis during
the war, with the corporation
being, "between a rock and a hard spot".  The Nazis needed, but never
trusted the Bosch company.

Robert Bosch died in 1941, and following his will instructions, The
Bosch Corporation is the worlds
largest non-profit corporation, with 93% of all profits going to the
Robert Bosch Foundation.

Bosch Corporation is now paying restitution, along with Krupp Arms,
Daimler, and the IG Farben
Trust has been wiped out due to restitution payments.

Any additional info posted, will be appreciated.  Advance thanx.
