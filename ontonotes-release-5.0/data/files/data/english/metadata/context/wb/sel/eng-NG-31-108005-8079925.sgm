Apparently, I didn't manage to whine enough about how nasty this stuff is to
sew.

The bride-to-be showed up today with about 100 yards of black tulle.  She
has this idea that &quot;we&quot; are going to make curtains out of the panels ( she
says she cut them into 8' lengths.  She want me to put a header at the top
and the bottom, &quot;we&quot; will then gather them onto dowel rod and hang them from
the ceiling with ribbon.  This is to hide the columns at the reception hall.

If she did manage by some miracle to cut them all the same length, we
shouldn't have a problem, but if she didn't, it's gonna look odd, right?
She wants to run a dowel rod through the bottom hem as well so they will
hang straight.

I'm thinking maybe it would be better to sew washers every so often along
the bottom for weight but I don't know, what do you all think?  She's going
to cut the dowel rods the size of the width of the columns - about 24&quot;, I
think.  How would she keep the tulle on the dowel rods at the bottom?

Oh, this is not good.  I think we need to talk about this some more.

Maybe it would be better to tie them at the top and the bottom with really
wide ribbon.

Just say no.

Maybe you can explain that the columns are weight-bearing and thus
necessary and that most people will notice them less if they are left
alone than if they are covered with miles and miles of black tulle.
Black? At a wedding?

When I was planning my wedding, I had altogether too much to think
about to come up with craft projects. LOL.

Good luck,
Sunny

What I did to hide columns was to cut tulle longer than the length of
the column by about a foot.  Layed the tulle on the floor and gathered
it around the bottom of the column with the bottom edge of the tulle
pointing to the ceiling.  Tied it off w/ a ribbon.  Then pulled the
lengths up and tied around the top of the column.  The bottom edge of
the tulle was hidden as it was folded under the long length of the
tulle.  Kind of looked like belly-dancing pants.

I also happended to use a garland of silk flowers around the top as
this was the only decoration in the whole room.  And I only had eight
columns that were 6&quot; in diameter and 8' tall to do.  This might not
work for what you are doing...

First of all, who is the bride in relation to you? Sister? Cousin?
Friend??

Second of all, why does she want to hide the columns?

Third of all, why BLACK? I realize that different cultures have
different views of black at a wedding and I truly hope that I'm not be
... culturally insensitive ... but BLACK?  If she has bridesmaids I
think I would have gone with a color a shade or two off of what they're
wearing rather than such a dark color ...

But most of all, it kinda sounds like your good nature might be getting
a bit taken advantage of ... spending oodles of hours creating bridal
favors is one thing, but redecorating a room with 100 yards of tulle
sounds a bit excessive ... especially when the solution/method isn't
cut-and-dried and has to be fudged.

If I had a nickel for every long-distance acquaintance who found out
that I could sew and just wanted a &quot;little favor (which wasn't little
at all)&quot; I'd be the richest woman in the world! :)

The last &quot;little favor&quot; was for a Mariner's Compass quilt - king size -
from a friend of a friend of a friend! :)
Needless to say, I had to beg off!

My inerpretation is she wants it gathered top and bottom, so it fans
on the ends and bellys in the middle.
She is going to paint the dowels herself right?

This needs to look good for one day, not fit somebody perfectly or
last a lifetime or several, right?

If she has the right length, all you need do is sew some quick and
dirty pockets at the appropriate spots on the tulle.  Cut some strips
of whatever is cheap and black in the remnents section.  Cut them at
about three and 3/4 times the diameter of the dowel.
Use a narrow hem foot and slam a hem onto your strips, or serge, or
overcast the edge, whatever is easiest for you to do.
Fold the strips in half and sew it down at the appropriate spot on the
tulle, following the line where you hemmed or edged on the strips.
Done.
Remind her to hot glue the pockets onto the ends of the dowel or
Murphy will prevail.

If she has blown the measuring, two choices as I see it.
(1) She goes out and gets more yardage and does it right this time.
(2) You cut all the pieces to the shortest length. Then SHE goes out,
gets some lace yardage and hot glues lace to the bottom of her
curtains.  Lace on the front, glue from the tulle side, no you won't
sew it for her.  You sew, you don't glue, glue is her responsability.

You can also blow off the bottom dowel by doing the lower gather with
a big ribbon, which is then taped or glued to the tulle, and using
tape or sticky putty to stick it to the column.  No messing around
with weights then.
Plus if you have to lengthen the tulle it can cover the join.

That will totally work on the bottom, but as I said, she will have to
stick it to the column for stability's sake.  The top will be taking
more weight so a dowel (or anything a bit solid) there is actually a
good idea.  More to have a solid hanging than anything.  Otherwise
Uncle Klutz will pull half of them down by accident before the night
is over.

Ummmmm with our crowd it could be to keep the drunken peoples from walking
into them! &lt;gr&gt;

This is a basement of a municipal auditorium.  It is the only place in our
area where you can have a reception with 500 people.  It is very utilitarian
(we have our quilt show there) and not terribly attractive.  These columns
are the bane of every wedding designer/friends decorating for you.  It's
hard to make them unobtrusive so sometimes we make them the showpiece.

&gt; tulle, following the line where you hemmed or edged on the strips.
&gt; Done.
&gt; Remind her to hot glue the pockets onto the ends of the dowel or
&gt; Murphy will prevail.

&gt; If she has blown the measuring, two choices as I see it.
&gt; (1) She goes out and gets more yardage and does it right this time.
&gt; (2) You cut all the pieces to the shortest length. Then SHE goes out,
&gt; gets some lace yardage and hot glues lace to the bottom of her
&gt; curtains.  Lace on the front, glue from the tulle side, no you won't
&gt; sew it for her.  You sew, you don't glue, glue is her responsability.

&gt; You can also blow off the bottom dowel by doing the lower gather with
&gt; a big ribbon, which is then taped or glued to the tulle, and using
&gt; tape or sticky putty to stick it to the column.  No messing around
&gt; with weights then.
&gt; Plus if you have to lengthen the tulle it can cover the join.

&gt; That will totally work on the bottom, but as I said, she will have to
&gt; stick it to the column for stability's sake.  The top will be taking
&gt; more weight so a dowel (or anything a bit solid) there is actually a
&gt; good idea.  More to have a solid hanging than anything.  Otherwise
&gt; Uncle Klutz will pull half of them down by accident before the night
&gt; is over.

Omigod, we will have to hide it.  I hope she never hears of silk.  She told
me last night she is looking for dragonfly fabric for curtains for their
daughter's room...  I didn't say anything, but I think I see curtains in my

Unless you really want to do curtains, nip the whole thing in the
bud NOW!  Next time she mentions fabric for curtains, say something like
&quot;I hope you find just what you are looking for.  I'm really sorry, but I
absolutely HATE to make curtains (or whatever) so I wouldn't be able to
help you with that project.  I'm sure you understand.&quot;   Make sure you
look her right in the eye when you say this -- you can smile just a bit
but be FIRM AND polite.  This is called being assertive AND honest.
Remember, assertive is when you tell folks what you want/need, etc. but
do not hurt their feeling when you do so.  You can say NO -- honest, you
really can :-).  It won't hurt much at all the first time either -- ask
me how I know LOL.  CiaoMeow &gt;^;;^&lt;

I'm writin this out 100 times so I can do it without stuttering when she
asks.

I have obligations out the wazoo.  My brother asked me to make my darling
SIL a set of scrubs out of camoflauge material!  I don't know what's up with
that, but the people he knows sent him a big wad of camo fabric straight
from the factory. I haven't measured but I think there's about 20 yards of
Realtree in that bag.  Actually it would make great curtains!  hehehheh.  I
think it's going to be too heavy to make a garment out of. I need to cut a
half yard and see how it washes.

I still have to make the clothes pin holder that will look like a wedding
dress to hold gift cards for the wedding.  Our quilt show is over Labor Day
and I will again do the program book.  I also have ribbon toppers to finish
for that.  I know there's a bunch more stuff stuck back in my sewing room
that I've promised to do.

On top of that, my dear MIL passed away yesterday morning.  She was the one
who taught me to sew when I married her son 34 years ago.  She encouraged me
and helped me and was so delighted when I made something.  I, in turn,
showed her the little I knew about quilting a few years ago and she never
looked back.  She loved it and was very good at it.  She was making charity
quilts for a local group in the city where she lived with her daughter. She
finished a top as late as a couple of weeks ago.  She was 89 (but looked
60).

Goodby, Ginger , I'm going to miss you.

{{{{{{{{{Cindy &amp; Family}}}}}}}}}}  I'm so sorry to hear about your DMIL
but I'm very pleased to see that you must have had a wonderful
relationship with her.  As for the camo fabric --  makes me LOL.  I once
made a garter &amp; bride's &quot;dollar dance&quot; bag out of camo fabric!!  This
was for a girl who loved to hunt &amp; camp with her DH to be so it was
quite appropriate.  It did look odd under the *very* traditional wedding
gown the bride wore :-).  We won't even talk about what the camo bag
looked like hanging on the bride's arm while she &quot;danced for dollars&quot; at
the reception -- LOLOL!  CiaoMeow &gt;^;;^&lt;

&gt;&gt;Apparently, I didn't manage to whine enough about how nasty this stuff is
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;sew.

&gt; Start now, and be freaking annoying about it.

&gt;&gt;The bride-to-be showed up today with about 100 yards of black tulle.  She
&gt;&gt;has this idea that &quot;we&quot; are going to make curtains out of the panels ( she
&gt;&gt;says she cut them into 8' lengths.  She want me to put a header at the top
&gt;&gt;and the bottom, &quot;we&quot; will then gather them onto dowel rod and hang them
&gt;&gt;from
&gt;&gt;the ceiling with ribbon.  This is to hide the columns at the reception
&gt;&gt;hall.

&gt; Sombody has been reading &quot;The Gothic Martha Stewert&quot;

&gt;&gt;If she did manage by some miracle to cut them all the same length, we
&gt;&gt;shouldn't have a problem, but if she didn't, it's gonna look odd, right?
&gt;&gt;She wants to run a dowel rod through the bottom hem as well so they will
&gt;&gt;hang straight.

&gt;&gt;I'm thinking maybe it would be better to sew washers every so often along
&gt;&gt;the bottom for weight but I don't know, what do you all think?  She's
&gt;&gt;going
&gt;&gt;to cut the dowel rods the size of the width of the columns - about 24&quot;, I
&gt;&gt;think.  How would she keep the tulle on the dowel rods at the bottom?

&gt; My inerpretation is she wants it gathered top and bottom, so it fans
&gt; on the ends and bellys in the middle.
&gt; She is going to paint the dowels herself right?

&gt; This needs to look good for one day, not fit somebody perfectly or
&gt; last a lifetime or several, right?

&gt; If she has the right length, all you need do is sew some quick and
&gt; dirty pockets at the appropriate spots on the tulle.  Cut some strips
&gt; of whatever is cheap and black in the remnents section.  Cut them at
&gt; about three and 3/4 times the diameter of the dowel.
&gt; Use a narrow hem foot and slam a hem onto your strips, or serge, or
&gt; overcast the edge, whatever is easiest for you to do.
&gt; Fold the strips in half and sew it down at the appropriate spot on the
&gt; tulle, following the line where you hemmed or edged on the strips.
&gt; Done.
&gt; Remind her to hot glue the pockets onto the ends of the dowel or
&gt; Murphy will prevail.

&gt; If she has blown the measuring, two choices as I see it.
&gt; (1) She goes out and gets more yardage and does it right this time.
&gt; (2) You cut all the pieces to the shortest length. Then SHE goes out,
&gt; gets some lace yardage and hot glues lace to the bottom of her
&gt; curtains.  Lace on the front, glue from the tulle side, no you won't
&gt; sew it for her.  You sew, you don't glue, glue is her responsability.

&gt; You can also blow off the bottom dowel by doing the lower gather with
&gt; a big ribbon, which is then taped or glued to the tulle, and using
&gt; tape or sticky putty to stick it to the column.  No messing around
&gt; with weights then.
&gt; Plus if you have to lengthen the tulle it can cover the join.

&gt;&gt;Oh, this is not good.  I think we need to talk about this some more.

&gt;&gt;Maybe it would be better to tie them at the top and the bottom with really
&gt;&gt;wide ribbon.

&gt; That will totally work on the bottom, but as I said, she will have to
&gt; stick it to the column for stability's sake.  The top will be taking
&gt; more weight so a dowel (or anything a bit solid) there is actually a
&gt; good idea.  More to have a solid hanging than anything.  Otherwise
&gt; Uncle Klutz will pull half of them down by accident before the night
&gt; is over.

I STILL work as a professional seamstress.  I'll blow my own horn
and say that I am good at what I do -- *very* good and I charge
accordingly!   When people say stuff like &quot;It'll only take a minute&quot; to
me, I just tell them that I charge by the JOB not by how long something
will take!  People who have never done alterations have NO CLUE what is
involved, especially if you do the job properly.
Most people who want something hemmed tell me it won't take any
time, just fold the hem up once!  NOT -- doesn't work that way, for me
anyway!  I might do that on something for a child when the hem will just
have to be let down again in a few months but never on something for an
adult.
I also have no problem telling someone I can't do a job -- whether
it's because I don't have the time or just plain don't want to do it --
LOL!  CiaoMeow &gt;^;;^&lt;

&gt;&gt;    Unless you really want to do curtains, nip the whole thing in the bud
&gt;&gt; NOW!  Next time she mentions fabric for curtains, say something like &quot;I
&gt;&gt; hope you find just what you are looking for.  I'm really sorry, but I
&gt;&gt; absolutely HATE to make curtains (or whatever) so I wouldn't be able to
&gt;&gt; help you with that project.  I'm sure you understand.&quot;   Make sure you
&gt;&gt; look her right in the eye when you say this -- you can smile just a bit
&gt;&gt; but be FIRM AND polite.  This is called being assertive AND honest.
&gt;&gt; Remember, assertive is when you tell folks what you want/need, etc. but
&gt;&gt; do not hurt their feeling when you do so.  You can say NO -- honest, you
&gt;&gt; really can :-).  It won't hurt much at all the first time either -- ask
&gt;&gt; me how I know LOL.  CiaoMeow &gt;^;;^&lt;

&gt; I'm writin this out 100 times so I can do it without stuttering when she
&gt; asks.

&gt; I have obligations out the wazoo.  My brother asked me to make my darling
&gt; SIL a set of scrubs out of camoflauge material!  I don't know what's up
&gt; with that, but the people he knows sent him a big wad of camo fabric
&gt; straight from the factory. I haven't measured but I think there's about 20
&gt; yards of Realtree in that bag.  Actually it would make great curtains!
&gt; hehehheh.  I think it's going to be too heavy to make a garment out of. I
&gt; need to cut a half yard and see how it washes.

&gt; I still have to make the clothes pin holder that will look like a wedding
&gt; dress to hold gift cards for the wedding.  Our quilt show is over Labor
&gt; Day and I will again do the program book.  I also have ribbon toppers to
&gt; finish for that.  I know there's a bunch more stuff stuck back in my
&gt; sewing room that I've promised to do.

&gt; On top of that, my dear MIL passed away yesterday morning.  She was the
&gt; one who taught me to sew when I married her son 34 years ago.  She
&gt; encouraged me and helped me and was so delighted when I made something.
&gt; I, in turn, showed her the little I knew about quilting a few years ago
&gt; and she never looked back.  She loved it and was very good at it.  She was
&gt; making charity quilts for a local group in the city where she lived with
&gt; her daughter. She finished a top as late as a couple of weeks ago.  She
&gt; was 89 (but looked 60).

&gt; Goodby, Ginger , I'm going to miss you.

Same here Mary!!  I do occasionally still do alterations and such, but
not often.  &lt;G&gt;
For someone special I may do an occasional job. But more as a favor. &lt;G&gt;

I also don't usually do garment sewing for others any longer. Got real
tired of trying to explain that just because the model on the pattern
envelope looks good, doesn't mean *you* will look the same.  sigh.

I just finished altering a Wedding gown and dress for the bride's
mother.  The mom is a friend so I didn't charge them as much as I would
have a stranger.  The problem I have with doing alterations garment
construction for people I don't know is that so many women want
something taken in &quot;just a tiny bit.&quot;   Taking in a total of 1/4&quot; along
the side seams of a garment does NOT make it look much different.
VBS -- we won't even talk about the brides who want to wait until
the last minute to have their gown altered because they are **positive**
they will lose another 10 pounds!  I try to tell them that this is OK if
the 10 pounds will come off in just one part of their body but that just
doesn't happen!  Even the bride I just altered the gown for was like
this -- oh, and she is stick thin already but wanted to lose another 2
or 3 pounds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  At least she listened to me about WHERE that
weight will disappear from -- LOL!  I'll have to get photos of that
gown.  The bodice needed to be taken in about 3&quot; and I shortened the
train by about 10&quot;.  It has a very unique hemline and it was quite
unusual.  It didn't have a bustle, just one of those loops that the
bride is supposed to put over her wrist to keep the train from dragging.
The bride didn't want that, she wanted a bustle.  Now THAT was a true
challenge and it took some cogitating on my part to figure out how to do
it but I managed and it looks pretty nice.  Best part is that the bride
*loves* the way it looks :-).  CiaoMeow &gt;^;;^&lt;

Ahhhh, shucks.  (I really am blushing.)  I just have this need to do
&quot;it&quot; right. Doing it quick may work, but not as well. And doesn't last
in the long run.

You could try suggesting using the columns instead of hiding them.  At our
reception we used tulle yardage with white Christmas lights in it to 'cover'
beams in the ceiling.  Made them look great.  Just 'wrap' the lights and
then spiral it down the column would be all she needed to do.  Very easy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Apparently, I didn't manage to whine enough about how nasty this stuff is
&gt; to sew.

&gt; The bride-to-be showed up today with about 100 yards of black tulle.  She
&gt; has this idea that &quot;we&quot; are going to make curtains out of the panels ( she
&gt; says she cut them into 8' lengths.  She want me to put a header at the top
&gt; and the bottom, &quot;we&quot; will then gather them onto dowel rod and hang them
&gt; from the ceiling with ribbon.  This is to hide the columns at the
&gt; reception hall.

&gt; If she did manage by some miracle to cut them all the same length, we
&gt; shouldn't have a problem, but if she didn't, it's gonna look odd, right?
&gt; She wants to run a dowel rod through the bottom hem as well so they will
&gt; hang straight.

&gt; I'm thinking maybe it would be better to sew washers every so often along
&gt; the bottom for weight but I don't know, what do you all think?  She's
&gt; going to cut the dowel rods the size of the width of the columns - about
&gt; 24&quot;, I think.  How would she keep the tulle on the dowel rods at the
&gt; bottom?

&gt; Oh, this is not good.  I think we need to talk about this some more.

&gt; Maybe it would be better to tie them at the top and the bottom with really
&gt; wide ribbon.
