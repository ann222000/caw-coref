Background - Prince Hamlet

This is meant to be only an essay. It is a first reconnaissance of a
realm well-nigh unexplored and uncharted. From whichever way one
enters it, one is caught in the same bewildering circular complexity,
as in a labyrinth, for it has no deductive order in the abstract sense,
but instead resembles an organism tightly closed in itself, or even
better, a monumental &quot;Art of the Fugue.&quot;

The figure of Hamlet as a favorable starting point came by chance.
Many other avenues offered themselves, rich in strange symbols and
beckoning with great images, but the choice went to Hamlet because he
led the mind on a truly inductive quest through a familiar landscape -
and one which has the merit of its literary setting. Here is a
character deeply present to our awareness, in whom ambiguities and
uncertainties, tormented self-questioning and dispassionate insight
give a presentiment of the modern mind. His personal drama was that he
had to be a hero, but still try to avoid the role Destiny assigned him.
His lucid intellect remained above the conflict of motives - in other
words, his was and is a truly contemporary consciousness. And yet this
character whom the poet made one of us, the first unhappy intellectual,
concealed a past as a legendary being, his features predetermined,
preshaped by long-standing myth. There was a numinous aura around him,
and many clues led up to him. But it was a surprise to find behind the
mask an ancient and all-embracing cosmic power - the original master of
the dreamed-of first age of the world.

Yet in all his guises he remained strangely himself. The original
Amlóði, as his name was in Icelandic legend, shows the same
characteristics of melancholy and high intellect. He, too, is a son
dedicated to avenge his father, a speaker of cryptic but inescapable
truths, an elusive carrier of Fate who must yield once his mission is
accomplished and sink once more into concealment in the depths of time
to which he belongs: Lord of the Golden Age, the Once and Future King.

This essay will follow the figure farther and farther afield, from the
Northland to Rome, from there to Finland, Iran, and India; he will
appear again unmistakably in Polynesian legend. Many other Dominions
and Powers will materialize to frame him within the proper order.

Amlóði was identified, in the crude and vivid imagery of the Norse,
by the ownership of a fabled mill which, in his own time, ground out
peace and plenty. Later, in decaying times, it ground out salt; and
now finally, having landed at the bottom of the sea, it is grinding
rock and sand, creating a vast whirlpool, the Maelstrom (i.e. the
grinding stream, from the [Icelandic] verb mala, &quot;to grind&quot;), which is
supposed to be a way to the land of the dead. This imagery stands, as
the evidence develops, for an astronomical process, the secular
shifting of the sun through the signs of the zodiac which determines
world-ages, each numbering thousands of years. Each age brings a World
Era, a Twilight of the Gods. Great structures collapse; pillars topple
which supported the great fabric; floods and cataclysms herald the
shaping of a new world. (Giorgio de Santillana, 'Hamlet's Mill - An
Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time', 1969; Second Paperback Edition,
David R. Godine, Publisher, Boston, 1983, pp. 1-2.)

The Concept of A World Age

One explanation that has been proposed to account for the appearance of
homologous structures and often even identical motifs in the myths and
rites of widely separate cultures is psychological: namely, to cite a
formula of James G. Frazer in The Golden Bough, that such occurrences
are most likely &quot;the effect of similar causes acting alike on the
similar constitution of the human mind in different countries and under
different skies.&quot;

There are, however, instances that cannot be accounted for in this way,
and they suggest the need for another interpretation: for example, in
India the number of years assigned to an eon is 4,320,000; whereas in
the Icelandic Poetic Edda it is declared that in Othin's warrior
hall, Valhall, there are 540 doors, through each of which, on the
&quot;day of the war of the wolf&quot;, 800 battle-ready warriors will pass
to engage the antigods in combat. But 540 times 800 equals 432,000!

Moreover, a Chaldean priest, Berossos, writing in Greek ca. 289 B.C.,
reported that according to Mesopotamian belief 432,000 years elapsed
between the crowning of the first earthly king and the coming of the
deluge.

No one, I should think, would wish to argue that these figures could
have arisen independently in India, Iceland, and Babylon. (Joseph
Campbell, 'The Mythic Image', Bollingen Paperbacks, Princeton
University Press, 1973, p. 72)

Notes On The End Of The World

According to the Hindu tradition of cosmology, we are now nearing the
end of the Kali Yuga (the Age of Iron) which is the final and most
negative of four evolutionary Yugic cycles. Each Yuga is like the
season of a super-cosmic year, even greater than the cosmic year of the
precession of the equinoxes. When the Earth came into its current phase
of manifestation and the first Yuga began ('Satya' Yuga, meaning
'Purity') humanity was barely removed from its original state of
God-like innocence. This was the original Golden Age. As time
progressed the planet underwent the influence of a negative descending
spiral, and the quality of life in each successive Yuga became further
and further removed from the knowledge of truth and natural Law (in
other words, 'Reality'). In the second, Treta Yuga (Silver Age)
spiritual awareness decreased by one fourth and by the time of Dvapara
Yuga (Copper Age) negativity had a 50% holding. In the Kali Yuga the
vibration has become pretty murky and humanity is labouring against
heavy odds. Righteousness (right-use-ness) has diminished to scant one
fourth of its original strength. Throughout our current history we have
created and been assailed by all the evils of Pandora's box. No
wonder the human race is having such a difficult time. But the turning
point has now arrived, and the dawn once more sheds its light on a
confused and ignorant planet. The Vishnu Purana, one of the oldest
sacred texts of India says about the Kali Yuga, &quot;The leaders who rule
over the Earth will be violent and seize the goods of their subjects...
Those with possessions will abandon agriculture and commerce and will
live as servants, that is, following various possessions. The leaders,
with the excuses of fiscal need, will rob and despoil their subjects
and take away private property. Moral values and the rule of the law
will lessen from day to day until the world will be completely
perverted and agnosticism will gain the day among men.&quot;

There are many other references to this division of time. For instance,
in the Bible, Nebuchandnezzar's dream (Daniel 2:31-45) was of a
bright and terrible image with a head of finest gold, chest of silver,
hips of brass and legs of iron. The feet and toes were of iron mixed
with clay. This image was destroyed by stone, unmade by human hands,
which crushed the feet to dust and the pieces blew away in the wind.
Although Daniel the prophet interpreted the various metals as the
world empires which succeeded Babylon, the dream also has a more cosmic
meaning. It represents the great yugas. The iron legs are the Iron Age
or Kali Yuga which deteriorates at the end of its cycle into the
present unstable civilisation symbolised by the feet of iron and clay.
The prophet interpreted the stone as the true kingdom of God which
would replace the other civilisations as the real and lasting Kingdom.

THE END OF A WORLD

This end only appears to be the &quot;end of the world,&quot; without any
reservation or specification of any kind, to those who see nothing
beyond the limits of this particular cycle; a very excusable error of
perspective it is true, but one that has nonetheless some regrettable
consequences in the excessive and unjustified terrors to which it gives
rise in people who are not sufficiently detached from terrestrial
existence; and naturally they are the very people who form this
erroneous conception most easily, just because of the narrowness of
their point of view. ...the end now under consideration is undeniably
of considerably greater importance than many other, for it is the end
of a whole Manvantara, and so of the temporal existence of what may
rightly be called a humanity, but this, it must be said once more, in
no way implies that it is the end of the terrestrial world itself,
because, through the &quot;reinstatement&quot; that takes place at the final
instant, this end will itself immediately become the beginning of
another Manvantara...if one does not stop short of the most profound
order of reality, it can be said in all truth the &quot;end of a world&quot;
never is and never can be anything but the end of an illusion. (Rene
Guenon, 'The Reign of Quantity and The Signs of the Times' -
Internet.).
