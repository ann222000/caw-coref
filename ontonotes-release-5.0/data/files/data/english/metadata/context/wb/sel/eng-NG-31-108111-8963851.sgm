It's been a while since I've had to train a dog to do this, but if I'm going
to be dog sitting with any kind of frequency, I may end up having to teach
certain doggies how to behave on leash.

A certain young dog is clearly missing a few brain installments.  When he
gets excited, he trills.  He chirps.  He makes Chewbacca noises.  When he
has a leash on, this is accompanied by a bucking bronco routine.  I have
tried the make like a tree routine.  He's pretty convinced that he is
perfectly capable of pulling this tree off its roots.  Tried changing
directions and seeing if he'll pay attention, which he will if we're indoors
(and have yummy treats which he will persistantly try to nab and that
failing, will sit instead), not at all if we're out.  If we're going some
place and he's excited (= any place other than within 20' of the house as
long as there is no wildlife nearby), he'll pull, lunge, jump up in the air,
jump up and forward at the same time, try to run, etc.  He is controllable
by a Halti, but does not walk on a loose leash with it.  Because his head
turns towards me when he tries to pull, he'll jump up in the air and in
circles with it on.  He doesn't know how to walk in a straight line, and zig
zags constantly - out front, to the side, behind you, back between your
feet, etc.  While ordinarily a sissy, he pays zero attention to a properly
fitted prong (I'll admit that the prongs are probably too large for him)

Is there anything that can be done to at least remediate his natural
tendencies somewhat in a short period of time?  He is otherwise a very good
boy, especially for a young Sibe.  No, scootering, skijoring, etc. are
generally not an option at this time.  All I can say is TG for the dog park.

When I have CrazyDog for a longer period of time, I'll try it.  He is very
exhuberent about everything, so I am reasonably sure about how he'll react
(I know how he'll react indoors, for instance), but it's worth a shot.
Also, I don't really care if he heels or not; I just want him to walk on a
loose leash without getting in everyone's way and tangling us all up.  I can
still walk three dogs at a time by myself, but it's considerably more
difficult when one of them is constantly getting in everyone else's way.

BTW, when the dog is excited and trilling in your ear when you're in the
car, don't join in.  Very bad idea unless you want your glasses and ears
full of slobber.

In class with Zoe, one of the tricks was keeping a stick with peanut
butter in front of her nose, walking along at the pace I wanted, letting
her get little licks now and then but mostly just keeping it slightly in
front of her.

That dog would do anything for peanut butter.

Things that have worked for me include clicker training and
lots of random changes of direction (throw in gee/haw
commands and he'll start picking that up, too, which has the
additional benefit of teaching him to listen to you in
addition to other attention modes).  Much patience is key to
most things doggie.

Things that have not worked have included make-like-a-tree
and training collars.  However, I handle a training collar
badly and it may work for someone with decent skills.  I
have never known make-like-a-tree to work for any Siberian.
I'm sure that there are some out there for whom it would be
effective, but in my experience a typical Siberian will
happily choke itself while pulling against something solid.

RTFM is age-old computer lingo.... It stands for
&quot;Read The F***ing Manual&quot; ;-) I used the manual
and it works very good!

But it is a long text to read (76 pages printed on
A4-size paper) My lab is 1year old now, and
teaching him something new takes about 30
minutes  (depending on what to teach of course)

My other dog (a 7year old staffordshire terrier-mix)
is a bit slower in learning, but he is used to me calling
him a &quot;bad dog&quot;whenever he did something i didn't
want him to do, or it might be the age.

Sometimes it looks like Sam (the lab) WANTS to learn
something new: he wants me to bring along the can
filled with washers whenever we go for a walk. It is a
very &quot;humane&quot; way of teaching: the dog is allways a
&quot;good dog&quot;, and never a &quot;bad dog&quot;

There is nu punishment or prong-collars involved.

For a fact i tought him to heel in 15min's without
beeing on a leach at-all !!! When he spotted a dog,
he used to run towards it, but now i tought him to &quot;ask
permission&quot; first, and to my surprise it worked!

My dogs never went to puppy-training
(lucky for them), maybe this helped too.

Oh, you mean JUST LIKE HOWE LeeCharlesKelly taught us
to train ANY dog to SIT or DHOWEN NEARLY INSTANTLY?

&quot;Despite Skinner's clear denunciation of &quot;negative
reinforcement&quot; (1958) NEARLY EVER LEARNING THEORY
model involves the USE OF PUNISHMENT. Of curse,
Skinner has never to my knowledge, demonstrated
HOWE we escape the phenomenon that an expected
reward not received is experienced as a punishment
and can produce extensive and persistent aggression
(Azrin et al, 1966).&quot;

&quot;The IMBECILITY of some of the claims for operant
technique simply take the breath away. Lovas et al
(1966) report a standard contingent reward/punishment
procedure developing imitative speech in two severly
disturbed non verbal schizophrenic boys. After twenty-
six days the boys are reported to have been learning
new words with alacrity. HOWEver, when REWARDS
were moved to a delayed contingency the behavior
and learning immediately deteriorated.&quot;

&quot;It is NO WONDER that the marked changes in
deviant behavior of children can be achieved
through brief, simple educative routines with
their mothers which modify the mother's social
behaviors shaping the child (Whaler, 1966).

Some clinics have reported ELIMINATION ofthe
need for child THERAPY through changing the
clinical emphasis from clinical to parental HANDLING
of the child (Szrynski 1965).

A large number of cases improved sufficiently after
preliminary contact with parents that NO treatment
of children was required, and almost ALL cases
SHOWE a remarkably shortened period for therapy.
Quite severe cases of anorexia nervosa have been
treated in own to five months by simply REPLACING
the parents temporarily with EFFUSIVELY LOVING
SUBSTITUTES (Groen, 1966).&quot;
