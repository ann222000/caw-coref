They had a caller today with the following question.

A car has 40 psi in each of the four tires. Why doesn't the pressure
change if the car is lifted up so its tires are no longer resting on
anything. They said that the tires don't deform enough to change the
pressure.

A physisist calls in and says PV=nRT, so the pressure doesn't change.
I think this might be wrong and the tires deform when they are on the
ground, changing the volume, keeping the pressure the same, and then
return to shape if they aren't on the ground.

This is because, mostly, I had read that you can measure a car's weight by
doing this.

1) measure the pressure in each of the four tires and record it

2) measure the &quot;footprint&quot; of each of the four tires in sq inches

From 1) and 2) you can determine how much weight is on the tires, by

lbs/sq in * sq in  = lbs, which must be the weight of the car.

I intend to try this with the scouts when we meet in a parking lot prior
to a trip. Will I get a good result? We might try it with the car &quot;empty&quot;
then with 4 or 5 scouts in it to see if it makes a difference. Obviously
sources of error are the accuracy of the tire guage and measuring the
footprint of the tire.

By knowing the CG of the vehicle and its weight, you can figure the

By some amount, sure.  A properly inflated car tire tends to show an almost
but not quite undetectable amount of distortion under normal proper loads.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; changing the volume,

The distortion is small in shape, and I suspect the change in volume would
be extremely minute.  I don't know how one would go about detecting volume
changes in such a set-up, so I suspect the change may even be undetectable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; keeping the pressure the same,

If the volume decreases and there is no leak or temperature change, the
pressure increases--minutely, of course.  This pressure increase probably
is detectable, but not with typical tire gauges.  You'd probably need
research-grade equipment.

The general cross sectional shape is &quot;round&quot;.  It's flattened a bit on
the bottom.  Now when you lower the car onto the road, it flattens
further, deforming further from the ideal round shape.  The resulting
shape has a higher circumference to volume ratio.  The volume is

I've been thinking. Suppose the tires were balloons. The pressure in a
balloon can be measured. If you squeeze on a balloon, does the pressure
change or does the balloon deform (bulge out) where you aren't squeezing
on it. Perhaps the same is true for tires?

In some trivial way some parts of the tire do deform outward (some of the
parts immediately adjacent to the parts that deform inward), but not in a
way that completely counteracts the rest of the deformation.

Both.  What would cause some part of the balloon, distant from where you
are squeezing it, to bulge out?  Pressure is the only plausible answer I
can come up with.  And if the pressure didn't change when you squeezed it,
why would the bulging out due to that unchanging pressure change? It
wouldn't.

&gt; Both.  What would cause some part of the balloon, distant from where you
&gt; are squeezing it, to bulge out?  Pressure is the only plausible answer I
&gt; can come up with.  And if the pressure didn't change when you squeezed it,
&gt; why would the bulging out due to that unchanging pressure change? It

&gt; &gt;there will be a limit to how far the tire can deform, and when that
&gt; &gt;point is reached then the pressure in the tire will increase.

Mine says that if you use weight = sum(contact_patch_area * tire_pressure),
you're neglecting the tire stiffness.

But tires aren't like balloons -- tires (at least most modern ones) have
steel and/or fiberglass belts that don't stretch (much).

I'm going to have to ask again, I'm afraid. Pressure is due to Temp,
Volume and the number of particles present. With my baloon, the temp is
constant (because I say so), and the number of particles are constant. So
if I squeeze the balloon and it bulges elsewhere, the pressure must be
constant, because of the temp/# of particles, so any bulge results in the
same volume. Yes?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;IANA physicist either, but it seems to me that when the bottom of the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;there will be a limit to how far the tire can deform, and when that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;point is reached then the pressure in the tire will increase.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What does your theory say about being able to measure the weight of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; car using the pressure in the tires, and the footprint of the tires?

&gt; &gt;Mine says that if you use weight = sum(contact_patch_area * tire_pressure),
&gt; &gt;you're neglecting the tire stiffness.

&gt; So if we had GVW we could find a factor for tire stiffness, that might be
&gt; roughly ok for most tires?

Sure, assuming it's approximately linear over all four tires, which
seems reasonable.

Rubber stretched that wasn't stretched before.  That indicates an
increase in pressure.  The volume that you squoze it is less than the
volume of the bulge, therefore V &lt; V_0 , which makes P &gt; P_0.

No.  If n and R and T all remain constant, that still leaves P and V to
change.  And both do.  If P didn't change, why would the bulge bulge?
You decrease the volume by squeezing.  That increases pressure.  That
causes a bulging, but not by as much as the original decrease in volume.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt; IANAPhysicist, but... Yes, the tires deform where they meet the pavement
&gt;&gt;&gt; (at rest).  But the question that floats to the top of the slime in my
&gt;&gt;&gt; head is &quot;does the volume of the container change?&quot;  When the bottom of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; tire deforms inward, does the rest of the tire deform outward leaving
&gt;&gt;&gt; the internal PSI back where we started??

&gt;&gt; I've been thinking. Suppose the tires were balloons. The pressure in a
&gt;&gt; balloon can be measured. If you squeeze on a balloon, does the pressure
&gt;&gt; change or does the balloon deform (bulge out) where you aren't squeezing
&gt;&gt; on it. Perhaps the same is true for tires?

&gt; But tires aren't like balloons -- tires (at least most modern ones) have
&gt; steel and/or fiberglass belts that don't stretch (much).
">

Car Talk's web site has a discussion about this problem:

http://action.publicbroadcasting.net/cartalk/posts/list/529411.page;j...

From what I can glean from it, either:

The function of the air in the tire is to keep the tire from collapsing,
it is the tire itself that carries the load, but the forces present in
this system are in the tens of thousands of pounds.

Or:

The tire deforms inward at the bottom, decreasing the volume, but it
deforms outward around this, increasing the volume.  There is a net change
in tire pressure on the order of a fractional pound.

Inflate a balloon half-way, then drive your car on top of it.
If the balloon pops, the weight of the car probably increased the pressure.

That would still only give you the volume. Unless you know the
average density of all parts involved (which would include a lot of
air if you insist on watertight), you're no closer to knowing the
weight.

Sigh.  Archimedes' insight was that you could measure the volume of
something by imersing it in water, provided it sinks.  Or rather, his
insight was that you could use this to determine if an object was made
of gold or not, by measure the volume and the weight.  Since at the
time there was no substance known that was as dense or denser than gold,
any other material you used to &quot;cheat&quot; with lower the density.

If something *floats*, on the other hand, it displaces a weight of
water equal to its own weight.  The fact that it floats tells you
somthing about the density, and you can even made a rough guess
based on how much of it protrudes above the liquid.
