Boat Transporting Undocumented Immigrants Washes Ashore

For the second time in less than three weeks, a  boat used to transport
undocumented immigrants into the United States  washed ashore on a northern San
Diego County beach today, authorities  reported.

A Coast Guard crew spotted the roughly 20-foot Sea Ray  sport-fishing vessel
in the waters off Dog Beach in Del Mar overnight and  alerted U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement about 3 a.m., ICE  spokeswoman Lauren Mack said.

Sheriff's officials found the  dilapidated craft beached nearby, and Border
Patrol agents located eight  undocumented Mexican nationals in the area and
took them into custody,  Mack said.

A similar vessel came ashore on the same stretch of  coast Nov. 7. Officials
believe that one also had been used to ferry  undocumented people into the
country from south of the border, according  to ICE.

A total of 15 such small, old and run-down human smuggling  boats have been
found abandoned in county waterfront areas -- including  Imperial Beach, La
Jolla and Mission Bay -- over the last seven months.

Federal authorities suspect one or more criminal group is behind  the
ocean-going efforts, Mack said. She described the method as unusual.

&quot;It's uncommon for an organization to dump their boat,&quot; Mack said.
&quot;Generally they want to keep it.&quot;
