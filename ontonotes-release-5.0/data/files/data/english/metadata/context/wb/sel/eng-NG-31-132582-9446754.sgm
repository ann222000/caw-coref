Free Forevermore

When this earth is over
And my life is done,
I'll be awakened by a trumpet
And the voice of the Father's son.

For a little while, I'll sleep.
But, it won't be for long
Until I reach that judgment seat,
Upon God's Great White Throne.

When He opens up His Book of Life,
I'll know my name appears
Because I've accepted Jesus Christ,
His son, through humble tears.

From His son's forgiveness,
His love and saving grace,
I'll find myself in Heaven;
Walking through those pearly gates.

There won't be any sadness there,
No pain or bitter tears.
For, all these things have passed away,
Along with months and years.

I'll get to talk with the saints of old.
We'll walk on Heaven's shore.
Justified by Jesus' blood,
I'm free forevermore.
