* website to learn about our featured place of the week, the Waterfront
Museum and Showboat Barge at Pier 44 in Red Hook, Brooklyn.

Known in its former life as the Lehigh Valley Railroad barge #79, the craft
used to haul 450 tons of cargo back and forth across the Hudson River
between the Westside and New Jersey docks. Decommissioned but not yet
demolished, David Sharps found the old barge under the George Washington
Bridge. He pumped out 300 tons of mud and began a multiyear effort to bring
it back to life, with plenty of help from other New Yorkers. As one of the
last of its kind on the water, it is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places. Now successfully renovated and docked at Pier 44 since the
mid-1990s, Sharps has turned the barge into a museum by day and showboat by
night. Read about it in the
PlaceExplorer&lt; http://ent.groundspring.org/EmailNow/pub.php?module=URLTracker&amp;cmd;=tr... &gt;in
a new profile contributed by Kate Fox.

- Visit the permanent collection of tug and barge artifacts, and the
special exhibition, *Showboat 'Round the Bend!*, extolling the glory
of the American showboat, on view until May 2008 and co-produced with the
Theatre Museum (curators Mary Habstritt &amp; Virginia Willets; designer
Elizabeth York).The museum's public hours are Thursdays 4-8pm year-round
except for the last two weeks in December. Group visits by appointment
year-round.
- Other Special events:
Oct. 6 &amp; 7: Noon - 6pm for Open House NY
