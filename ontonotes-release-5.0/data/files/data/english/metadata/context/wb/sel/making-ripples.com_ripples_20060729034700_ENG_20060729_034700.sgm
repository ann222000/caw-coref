I said in my earlier post:

If you do not stand out from the crowd, you risk being considered a
commodity. This has serious implications for the self-employed business
person or artist.

My wife asked me a very good question about &quot;standing out from
the crowd&quot; which is worth discussing before I go any further.

Gretchen has begun revitalizing herself as an artist after a
twenty-year detour into industry. She is already attracting attention
and has begun to exhibit her paintings and pastels in local galleries,
but at the same time, she doesn't consider that her work is that
different from the works of more experienced artists in this area.

I am not sure I convinced her, but her work is readily
distinguishable from the work of the other artists she paints with. To
my eye, it is not so much a matter of technique as a matter of
intention. No matter what she paints, I feel that she imbues each
painting with a certain feeling of life. As her technique improves, she
is able to elicit more emotional response from the viewer with less
effort.

Once she figures out what she wants to accomplish, there will be no
stopping her if she decides to pursue a career as a professional artist.
