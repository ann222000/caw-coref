I'm working on a disaster preparedness planning project for a member of
ours - trying to build a supply spreadsheet.  They want to know how much per
day they'd need of certain things and have considered that the families who
come will bring their animals.

so how much water per day does a dog drink, on average.  Obviously it
varies -so we will estimate on the high side.  But how much?

One cup per 10 pounds of body weight is the rule of thumb.  But, I'm also
thinking that there has to be another question, which is how much water a
dog absolutely needs to stay alive in survival situations.

Also, would it be an option to add water purification tablets as an item?
More expensive than bottled water probably, but more portable and compact.

I haven't figured it out.  We have a 5 gallon waterer, plus auto water
for when we're outside.  We were going through the 5 gallons in anywhere
from 3 days to a week (3 dogs, 2 cats).  With just 2 dogs and 2 cats, it
has been slower, but I am honestly not sure how much.  Hard to tell when
so many animals share the same water.  I only worry if I notice one
seems to be at the water bowl  more frequently than average.

Average dog weight is much harder than cats.

I guess i'm being INCREDIBLY unclear.

I work for an organization that is a membership organization of HEALTH
CLINICS FOR HUMANS.

one of those clinics, here in anchorage, has become one fo the congregate
care locations in the disaster plan of the city.  In an emergency, they are
prepared to take on 250 humans and their 60 dogs and 65 cats.  They have
asked me to help figure out how much in the way of supplies they should have
on hand for consumables, including water and food for the dogs and cats.

Its a pretty &quot;guesstimate&quot; kind of thing, I know.  Maybe  I should just call
my vets office for a recommendation.

I'll bet!  Most of the lameness I've had to deal with myself
were pretty obvious - arthritis, navicular disease, etc.
The last horse I had was pretty much the last straw and
drove me out of horses - she was intermittently off with
what looked like neurological problems and we tried pretty

kept coming up empty.  Eventually she went into one episode
that was so bad and so persistent that I ended up having her

BWEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!

Navicular Problems

WRITTEN BY: Cheryl Sutor   [October 7, 2002]

The most common cause of locomotor lameness in horses is
found in the navicular area of the horse's hoof. The &quot;hows&quot;
and &quot;whys&quot; of navicular problems are often written-off as
&quot;un-known&quot;. I have decided to write this article to clear up
the confusion that is commonly spread about this problem,
which has grown to epidemic proportions.

I will define navicular problems, discuss how and why they
exist and give advice on preventing and treating these
problems in your horse.

The terms &quot;Navicular Disease&quot; or &quot;Navicular Syndrome&quot; are
often used to define navicular problems a horse may have.

However, neither of these terms should be used to define
navicular problems. Using the word &quot;disease&quot; has never
been justly defined when referring to navicular problems.

Navicular problems are not a disease, they are man-made.

The word &quot;syndrome&quot; is defined as: a commonly recurring
group of symptoms of unknown cause. The cause of navicular
problems IS known, and therefore, the word &quot;syndrome&quot; also
is not a correct identifier.

So, for the purpose of this article, I will use the term
&quot;navicular problems&quot; throughout.

Navicular problems are completely man-made through
improper trimming, short-term or long-term shoeing,
and/or inadequate natural environment throughout a
horse's life. This improper care can cause problems in
the navicular area of the hoof, not to mention a plethora
of problems within the entire horse.

I think we will take a large average - say 50 pounds, and just multiply from

That's kinda how it is around here as well.  The dog park population
definitely skews larger; I suspect that a lot of small dog owners are afraid
to bring their small dogs in and have them mingle among the large.  Average
would probably be 50 - 60 pounds, maybe closer to 60.

Generally, the larger the animal, the more efficient it is in terms of food
and water requirements. A 100 lb dog will not need 100 times as much food
(or water) than a 1 lb mouse. It is probably more proportional to the
surface area of the animal than weight.

I found an on-line calculator:

http://www.mycockerspaniel.com/h2o.htm

The formula they use is:

dogs requirement of water (ml/day) = (70 * (body weight in kg)^0.75) * 1.6

It's a simple Javascript.

Muttley, at 75 lb, would require 1580 ml or 6 cups, 5 oz. I would have
guessed about 1-2 quarts. A little 15 lb dog needs 473 ml, or 1 cup 8 oz.

If you'll note, they also say:

&quot;Veterinarian, Janet Tobiassen Crosby  recommends dogs and cats should
have 30 ml of water per pound of body weight which comes close to the
formula on this page.&quot;

30ml =~ 1 oz.

So that would be approximately one ounce per pound of body weight per
day.

Not very cool, but...

I have no idea how much my dogs drink.  There are two water dishes in
the house which are refilled by whoever notices they're getting low (me
or my daughter, usually), plus they drink from their cooling tank out in
the yard.

Zane especially.  He herds his basketballs around the yard until he gets
too hot then he'll run up to the patio, throw himself into the tank and
have a nice long drink of his own bathwater.  I empty and scrub the tank
out every other day or so so at least there's nothing much growing in
there, but it still gets pretty murky pretty quickly.  He ignores water
bowls with nice clean water placed nearby, preferring the
one-stop-shopping option.

I just wanted to comment in this thread that it is a good idea to
know about how much _your_ dogs normally drink in a day - and be
aware if their behavior changes. (I know this is difficult with
multiple dogs).

Oppie began increasing his water intake sometime last fall.  At
first we thought it was because he had just started on a thyroid
supplement, and didn't give it too much thought.  But pretty soon
we noticed that we were filling his water bowl at least twice a
day (as opposed to once with water left over).  At that point we
mentioned it to the vet, who asked for urine sample.

The specific gravity of his urine was extremely low (it was very
dilute), so they did a bunch more tests, including complete blood
and thyroid panels and abdominal ultrasound, which turned up
nothing.  And he kept on drinking 12-13 cups a day, when his norm
had been about 5-7.  He was even &quot;leaking&quot; in his sleep.

Meanwhile, we decided to go ahead with LP surgery, which meant a
change in diet, so in early March we took him off the Iams and
Nutro kibble that he'd been eating (are you seeing what is
coming?), to get him used to eating moist food before the surgery.

By the time we did the surgery, March 21, his water consumption
was lower, though not back to normal.  It normalized within a few
weeks.

Oh - and he developed hypertension and went blind in one eye -
something that was noticed in his presurgical testing.

His blood pressure has normalized; the eye won't ever recover.
The vet. ophtalmologist thinks it was due to hypertension.

At the end of March we read about the melamine/etc.
contamination; Iams and Nutro kibbles were affected, although we
didn't have the bags so we couldn't check the lot numbers.

Can we prove that the excessive water consumption, hypertension
and blindness was caused by melamine contamination?  No.  But our
vets won't rule it out, either.  And melamine has been recognized
as a diuretic for more than 50 years.

So - it's always a good idea to know what your dogs' norms are.
I think if we had been monitoring his water more closely, we
would have noticed the problem sooner... in this case, we would
not have had the necessary information to correct it (no one
suggested changing his diet, and we didn't think of doing so),
but in other folks' cases, it might make a difference.

You could still do the same general thing, just not with your records.
Call your vet's office and ask them if they could keep a chart by the
weighing equipment and jot down the weights of dogs and cats who come
in during a day, or a week if they don't weigh that many animals in a
day.  Take the chart and figure out the average weight of dogs and of
cats, then do the math to get the number of dogs and number of cats
you want to be prepared for.  I would think that the vet's office
would be willing to take the extra minute or so to jot down the weight
on a separate list as well as on the patient's chart if it's for a
good cause like making sure you have food and shelter for their
animals as well as human disaster victims.  Look what happened with
pets in New Orleans.
