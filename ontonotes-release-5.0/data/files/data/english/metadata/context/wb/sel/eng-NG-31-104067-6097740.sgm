hey group,

to update the situation with the video files, i decided to remove them
from the group archives and jizz agreed to move them to a more secure
location. he and i were in agreement that the files left in the
library in this group can be viewed by anyone on the internet, whether
or not they belong to this group or wish to participate. when jizz
discovered that the files were open to the net i took it upon myself
to protect everyone's anonymity and twisted jizz's arm to move them.
he did the best he could given the time limit i gave him before i
started deleting the files.

please be aware that anything you post to this group is open to the
public. the settings can not be changed and i wanted to make sure
everyone knew that if you post something personal make sure you do it
with an anonymous email address. do not use your home or personal
email address to post sensitive topics to this group. Â i have tried to
protect everyone's anonymity as best i can but everyone wants vid
files and i thought it best to let you know the nature of the
situation.

slam it up but keep it under the radar.
