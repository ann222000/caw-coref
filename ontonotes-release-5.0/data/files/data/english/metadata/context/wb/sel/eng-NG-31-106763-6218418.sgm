I could have easily fell for this one. YOU are rich, you have a tax
accountant, s/he tells you how much you owe the IRS but the amount is
much more than what the client really owes the IRS. THE accountant
pays the IRS the real amount and puts the rest in his secret checking
account. HE got away with it for five years. HE woudn't have ever got
caught until he made an unbelievably obvious and stupid mistake, he
pays off his client's tax debt with a check that bounced, the IRS
called the client and informed him of his situation, the client
checked his books......................

$4M 'PLUNDER' DUNDERHEAD
By LAURA ITALIANO

February 28, 2007 -- Embezzlement 101: If you're going to write checks
on your secret embezzlement account, make sure they don't bounce,
especially if you're sending them to the IRS.
That's the dopey mistake that tripped up an Upper East Side accountant
charged with stealing $4.1 million from a Midtown clothing importer he
worked for, authorities say.

Stephen Schor, 46, was arrested yesterday and was held in lieu of
$150,000 bail after pleading not guilty to embezzlement charges that
could get him up to 25 years in prison.

Manhattan prosecutors say that between 2000 and 2004, Schor lied to
his client, claiming that the man's companies owed huge amounts of
taxes.

He allegedly told the client, Irwin Peters, to pay the money directly
to him and he'd send it on to the taxman. He then allegedly sent the
IRS the correct amount and put the rest in his secret account.

He used the money to buy a Mercedes and pay bills, including rent on
his $2,600-a-month Upper East Side apartment, authorities said.

But then Schor used a check drawn on the seriously depleted account to
pay his client's $25,000 tax bill, authorities said. It allegedly
bounced, and the IRS promptly informed Peters.

Peters - head of Andre Romanelli Inc. and Van Gils International, Inc.
- started checking the books, discovered the alleged fraud, and called
cops.

"The moral of this story is, if you're embezzling money, don't put out
checks that are going to bounce," said DA Robert Morgenthau.
