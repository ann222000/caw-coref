Significant Pure Assembler Application In MASM ?

Poor old Betov has been try out another one of his geriatric fantasies
recently, that there has never been a significant application written
in MASM.

Now we will put aside all of the ones from the old days, any NDA
closed source code from professional development companies, any
internal code that Microsoft use MASM for in either thier OS
development or applications like Office or device drivers and the like
and see what is left.

I spend most of my spare development time working on stuff for the
masm32 project and I get very little time for application development
but I do have to write one application for every version that is
released and that is the installation for the masm32 Project. The
MASM32 Installation is written exclusively using the MASM32 project.

The current version available at www.masm32.com is as follows,

m32v9r.zip     3,537,002     3/10/2006

Differing from poor old Betov, the MASM32 Installation did not take 8
years to cobble together, it uses standard MASM object modules in a
highly extendable modular design that is clean and easy to modify and
maintain.

In terms of what is a significant application, the MASM32 Installation
has been downloaded and installed by a massive number of people who
see a pure MASM application in action every time they install the
MASM32 project.

Its time for Betov to come clean and admit that he was trying to feed
members of theis newsgroup more bullsh*t.

It is not so bad that he has these phantasms and illusions.  Some of
them are actually funny.  What is worrisome is that he has a hard time
shaking them loose even when confronted with hard evidence to the contrary.
They appear to become integrated into his cerebral cortex, thereby making it
almost inpossible to remove and start afresh.

Betov is a bitter old man, eaten alive by jealousy.
He will never understand why MASM is powerfull. It's a lost cause.
What really is a pity is that beginners could be influenced by him and
be off-track for a while or always like Wannabe. Too bad for them.

He would understand if only he would test drive MASM.  He needs to be
careful during his first time, however.  It may be too powerful for him to
control until he gains experience and wisdom in effective programming.

Another important fact about him is he is rarely on the defense.
His entire strategy is to stay on the offense, and keep others on the
defense.

Point out a defect or deficiency in either himself or his product,
and watch how he turns the conversation around, and starts accusing or
blaming you, or others, for something that usually has nothing at all
to do with what you were originally talking about. Then he's got you on
the defense.

Understanding his methods cripples him.  Don't let him get you on the
defense, and he is powerless.

Impossible or you'll have to tell me how. Its twisted mind is able of
doing things that are way beyond the logic. At the end, when he cannot
add something for its defense, he can claim victory and thats all.
That's what he did on the topic &quot;Apologies seem to hurt&quot;. Hutch often

I have at least 2 pure MASM &quot;applications&quot; to offer:

1. HX DOS extender. Project size is about 110.000 lines, it was
started in 1992.
2. COMView, about 50.000 lines of code, written in 2001/2002.

You will probably find that downloaded many times and useful to people
who have downloaded it is far more significant than what Betov had in
mind with the term.

Not surprising as it was not around in 1992. Many different people

Sorry, this restriction wasn't mentioned in the OP's request for

You like it or not, &quot;significant&quot; means something having
a source size around 300, 500, 1000 Kb. That is, a real
*Application*, and evidently not a small Demo. One of
the multiple problems coming with MASM is that is becomes
more and more difficult to write and to maintain anything,
above some significant size. The reason why none of you
has anything to show. Facts.

The biggest win32 app ever written with MASM was created
with TASM by Bodgan (H. E.), and he achieved its size
(quite &quot;significative&quot;), by implementing its Sprites in
a special code driven manner, which is rather comparable
to consider Bitmaps as *code*.

Ok, so you've needed 26 minutes to download the &quot;side-toy&quot;, start it

All he has to do &quot;weasel&quot; out of a legitimate answer is say &quot;money.&quot;  It
could be almost anything.  Secrecy seems to be a favorite game for him.
Anytime he can't rip American politics or society because AU or UK politics
and society are worse, he starts up a &quot;it's my MASM32 secret agreements that
you don't, can't, won't know about which I'll never prove to you they exist
that allow me the lawful privilege of doing what you perceive as illegal&quot;
threads.  He was extremely quiet on the Australian and British financial
problems of Northern Bank and Rams HL.  Of course, he'd blaim the US for
that too citing our trivial financial crisis.

His secret reason could be almost anything:

1) almighty AUD...
2) code won't compile with MASM only
3) code requires a commercial software package to compile
4) used some code for which he doesn't have rights
5) used some code which isn't open sourceable
6) wants to keep his own code private or retain rights
7) used patented algorithms
8) used restricted licensed information
9) used &quot;reverse engineered&quot; information
10) hiding work owned by his employer
11) stole code from someone else
12) he enjoys aggravating others on serious issues
13) etc.

There are so many I don't even have to list something embarassing like
coding using Visual Basic Script...  ;-)

Do you mean like a C compiler is to MASM ? How many right clicks do
you need to make in RotAsm to emulate MASM using VC as a side tool ?

You may have mastered using a &quot;paquet de merde&quot; like RotAsm to write a
bloated &quot;paquet de merde&quot; but MASM is the right tool for writing small
fast professional quality tools and applications so you can have the
trash and the smart stuff will continue to be written in MASM like it
always has.

HAY Rod,

Why don't you go back to sucking Betov's dick quietly so you don't
make a fool of yourself any longer.

HAY Rod, have you realised that there is a world out there at last ?
here is your question for the day, which American polititian is
phuking America the hardest ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He was extremely quiet on the Australian and British financial

Little touchy there komrade ? As the arse falls out of the Yankee

it&quot; ? Was it those wicked Ruskies selling their oil ? Perhaps the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; His secret reason could be almost anything:

&gt;   1) almighty AUD...
&gt;   2) code won't compile with MASM only
&gt;   3) code requires a commercial software package to compile
&gt;   4) used some code for which he doesn't have rights
&gt;   5) used some code which isn't open sourceable
&gt;   6) wants to keep his own code private or retain rights
&gt;   7) used patented algorithms
&gt;   8) used restricted licensed information
&gt;   9) used &quot;reverse engineered&quot; information
&gt;   10) hiding work owned by his employer
&gt;   11) stole code from someone else
&gt;   12) he enjoys aggravating others on serious issues
&gt;   13) etc.

Or a few more,

No. The hx source is well over 3 MB and about 90% of it are Win32 PE

This is a claim without backup IMO. There is no inherent defect in
MASM which makes writing large applications impossible or especially

Where did you found out those &quot;26 minutes&quot;?

Well, I have several problems with this.

First, no idea which IDE was used. So...

Second, COMView.asm does not seem to me to be the Main File. So,
impossible to know which asm files are inside (only .inc, there)
and how they are organized. So, it is impossible for me to take
a real look, nor to evaluate the real work, in this typical MASM
hell.

That being said, this seems to be a nice job, but if you are happy
with a having spent, at least, two years, for having a list view
showing the available COM objects, with such an horror as MASM...
