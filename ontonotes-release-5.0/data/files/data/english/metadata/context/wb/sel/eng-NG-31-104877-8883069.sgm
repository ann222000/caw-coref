FOUR

Four is the tetrad or Quaternary of the Pythagoreans! and it is a
sacred number in the advanced Degrees.

The Pythagoreans called it a perfect number, and hence it has been
adopted as a sacred number in the Degree of Perfect Master.

In many nations of antiquity the name of God consists of four letters,
as the Adad, of the Syrians, the Amum of the Egyptians, the efos of
the Greeks, the Deus of the Romans, and pre-eminently the
Tetragrammaton or four-lettered name of the Jews. But in Symbolic
Freemasonry this number has no special significance.

I've mentioned many times that Shakespeare was Jesus.  This quatrain
corroborates what I've been saying.  The implication is that the bones
of Shakespeare meant something to Jesus?  What?  Shakespeare was

It refers to Jesus' dust,

i.e.

Dust to dust, ashes to ashes

- alleging that there are bones.

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` ````

This, of course, would shake the faith of some.
But of what kind of people?

My own view is that it doesn't make any difference,
it is
totally irrelevant whether anyone went in
their body, to the sky...

the body is a temporary covering, of NO lasting importance.
In another realm, there will be other bodies, of another kind.
Certainly not the dense physical ones of earth.

Insofar as I am a Christian,
I do NOT let it rest on whether a physical body went to heaven.
What kind of people do?

They're nuts.  The message is &quot;Jesus, bust man, he.&quot;  The &quot;d&quot; in
&quot;DUST&quot; is a reversed &quot;b.&quot;  The latters in the inscription were all
capitalized by an ignorant engraver.   Chaucer, who wrote the
gravestone's words (at God's command), wanted to counter the
homosexuality that was rife in those days by pointing out the Our Lord
was definitely heterosexual.  (Chaucer was a reincarnation of Moses,
so used to making inscriptions of this sort.)

Words: George Wither, 1588-1667

1. Sweet baby, sleep; what ails my dear?

Be still, my child, and lend thine ear
.   To hear me sing thy lullaby.
.       My pretty lamb, *FORBEAR TO* weep;

2. Thou blessed soul, what canst thou fear?

Thy God is now thy father dear;
.   His holy spouse thy mother too.

.       Be still, my dear; sweet baby, sleep.

Pilgrim's Progress

Valiant: Yes, it doth. Now that which caused me to come on pilgrimage
was this: We had one Mr. TELL-TRUE come into our parts, and he told it
about what CHRISTIAN had done, that went from the city of Destruction;
namely, how he had forsaken his wife and children, and had betaken
himself to a pilgrim's life. It was also confidently reported how he had
killed a serpent that did come out to resist him in his journey; and how
he got through to whither he intended. It was also told what welcome he
had at all his Lord's lodgings; especially when he came to the gates of
the Celestial City. &quot;For there,&quot; said the man, &quot;he was received with
sound of trumpet by a company of shining ones.&quot; He told it also how all
the bells in the City did ring for joy at his reception; and what golden
*GARMENTS* he was clothed with; with many other things that now I shall
*FORBEAR TO* relate. In a word, that man so told the story of CHRISTIAN
and his travels, that my heart fell into a burning haste to be gone
after him; nor could father or mother stay me: so I got from them,
and am come thus far on my way.

I take it you just want imperative examples (there are plenty more
indicative ones).   The most famous would be Donne, from &quot;A Valediction of
weeping&quot;, written in the 1590s: [from Poems (1633)]

19           O more then Moone,
20        Draw not up seas to drowne me in thy spheare,
21        Weepe me not dead, in thine armes, but **forbeare**
22        To teach the sea, what it may doe too soone,

3          For offring, with thy smiles, my wit to grace,

5          And so my sharpnesse thou no lesse dis-joynts,
6             Than thou did'st late my sense, loosing my points.

Yes, that was what I had in mind. Thanks. I suppose I

Thanks, Peter. I certainly think that the couplets by
Jonson and Anton are early enough and as like the one
on the grave as Marlowe's is.

I can't believe Bob posted this before I did, its the exact same thing! I
was merely going to add a few extra notes to connect it with the Tomb
inscription which by cipher wheel, number substitution, Templar bread-making
recipe #4 and The Annunciation [if read in Despotic Greek] clearly predicted
that the Author would return, as 'Eldyis', again with the inverted b/d known
to initiates and illiterates.

The etymology is simple! ELIE; Elijah [Chaucer], and ELICHE: alike //Depos.
Ric. II p. 6  and from ELFE; a witch or fairy [A. Sax].

But the clincher is surely: ELVENE: Elves [A. Sax].

Of course; PRESCELLE merely means; to excel //Palsgrave, and the Author
himself joked on this topic, by coining PRECEDENT meaning; prognostic,
indication and also 'a rough draft of writing'. What the Author is really
intimating is her knowledge of the word PRESEPE: a precept of order

for here es comene a presepe, swykke menne to take  //MS Lincs A. i. 17,
f. 148

an ani ful no

Now, the word DUST means [A. Sax] 'to shake the hips' ('to dust one's
jacket' is a phrase still in use, meaning to shake it all about. See also
DUSCHYNG //Hampole, from DUSH; to gyrate wildly, to swivel with an attitude)

Hence the author anticipates his own future incarnation, this time as a man,
named ELFLICHE PRESCEPE

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He is commemorated today by a statue in the Romanian city
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Constanta (modern name of Tomis) and the 1930 renaming
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the nearby town of Ovidiu, alleged location of his tomb.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Latin text on the statue says (Tr. 3.3.73-76):
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ........................................................
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .  Hic ego qui iaceo tenerorum lusor amorum

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can't help wondering whether the writer of the

&gt; &gt; &gt;    And thus bespake him: &quot;Gentle youth, forbear

No, it's a thing of wonder and beauty called Literature Online or LION, a
more or less comprehensive (up to C20) searchable database of published
English literature published by Chadwyck-Healey.  Unfortunately it's not

tool.

&gt; &gt; Yes, that was what I had in mind. Thanks. I suppose I
&gt; &gt; should also have said that I was really only looking for
&gt; &gt; ones that predated 1621/2, which is most probably when
&gt; &gt; the inscription on the grave first appeared.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The most famous would be Donne, from &quot;A Valediction of
&gt; &gt; &gt; weeping&quot;, written in the 1590s: [from Poems (1633)]

&gt; &gt; &gt; 19           O more then Moone,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 20        Draw not up seas to drowne me in thy spheare,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 21        Weepe me not dead, in thine armes, but **forbeare**
&gt; &gt; &gt; 22        To teach the sea, what it may doe too soone,

&gt; &gt; Thanks. That is certainly one I should have known (although
&gt; &gt; it isn't in any of the anthologies I have).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Jonson, Ben, 1573?-1637:  LVIII. To Groome Ideot. [from
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Workes (1640)]

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1          Ideot, last night, I pray'd thee but **forbeare**
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2             To reade my verses; now I must to heare:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3          For offring, with thy smiles, my wit to grace,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4          Thy ignorance still laughs in the wrong place.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5          And so my sharpnesse thou no lesse dis-joynts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6             Than thou did'st late my sense, loosing my points.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 7          So have I seene at Christ-masse sports, one lost,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 8             And, hood-wink'd, for a man, embrace a post.

&gt; &gt; And that one too, given that I have Parfitt's Penguin &quot;The
&gt; &gt; Complete Poems&quot; by my side right now. Another one addressed
&gt; &gt; to Shakespeare, I suppose?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Prince HENRIES Obsequies;
&gt; &gt; &gt; OR Mournfull Elegies upon his Death.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wither, George, 1588-1667:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Vicount Lisley, Lord Chamberlain to the Queens Majesty,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and L. Governour of Vlushing, and the Castle of Ramekins.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 37        Here under lies a Sidney: And what then?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 38        Dost think here lies but reliques of a man?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 39        Know 'tis a Cabinet did once include,

&gt; &gt; &gt; 45        And now your Tears and private Griefe **forbeare**,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 46        To turne unto our Great and Publike Care.

&gt; &gt; Don't you think the 'forbear/To' should be an enjambment?

&gt; It must be, always; some ELiabethan and Jacobean printers
&gt; had a habit of bunging in commas at line-endings regardless.
">

I was suggesting that your list ought to restrict itself to
enjambments, because I don't think that this is one. He is
not saying &quot;forbear to turn...&quot;. It is the &quot;Tears and private
Griefe&quot; over the death of Sidney's son which he is asking him
to forbear (withhold, keep back), so that he can now get on
with writing about the &quot;Great and Publike Care&quot; of Prince
Henry's death.

Ah yes. They're the Scrooges who sought permission to

The inscription implies that its word are
those of the poet (&quot;my bones&quot;). Yet they
clearly are not.  We are therefore supposed
to assume that the poet expressed these
sentiments strongly -- to his nearest and
dearest --  but never got around to putting
them into writing, (even though he seems
to have known that he was dying) leaving
it to some much less competent local
person.

Yet the skilled use of enjambment indicates
that the author was not unsophisticated,
even it the rest of verse is close to doggerel.
The use of 'yt' for 'that' (twice) seems to me
deliberately rustic and old-fashioned.

The purpose of this verse was to ensure
that the body of the Stratman would never
be re-located to Westminster Abbey.
Local rustics were supposedly burying
him, expressing his wishes with this curse.
Of course, none if it was their idea -- let
alone his -- but that was how it had to
appear.

The author was probably Thomas Greene,
who had shown considerable competence
as a poet when he was a law student .  He
was soon to be a great London barrister, but
while the Stratman was alive, he remained
Stratford's Town clerk, and, almost certainly,
the chief government agent in charge of this
matter.

He did his best to make this inscription as
crude as possible, but could not restrain
himself from exploiting an enjambment that
was far too sophisticated.

Sorry, Paul, but louts were using enjambments to get end rhymes for
years before there was a term for them.  Enjambments are not
sophisticated.  If you had studied the works of more than one poet,
you might know this.  Furthermore, gravestone rhymes like this one
(I'm sure) were common and would have had time to become standard
enough for any doggerelist to use.  I wasn't there, and I lack your
knowledge as to what any given human being would have to do in a given
circumstance, so I don't know how the rhyme was chosen for the grave,
but my hunch is that Shakespeare did voice his superstition enough for
whoever was in charge of his burial to grab a standard don't move
these bones rhyme for the gravestone.

Jesus advised us to merge into the Holy Spirit.  Why worry about dust,

up being reborn again.  That's what it means.

Thanks for the good post, Lyra.  Good anagrams, too.

Archbishop opens medieval church

The restoration included colourful wall paintings, uncovered during
dismantling

A 13th Century church, which was dismantled and rebuilt 50 miles away
at a museum in Cardiff,
has been opened by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

St Teilo's Church has been recreated stone-by-stone over 20 years at
the National History Museum, St Fagans.

The church from Pontarddulais near Swansea has been restored to
recreate its appearance in 1520.

Copies of a rare series of 16th Century paintings, which were
uncovered as it was being dismantled, adorn the walls.

First Minister Rhodri Morgan also attended the ceremony with the
archbishop, Dr Rowan Williams.

The first minister said: &quot;I have watched the incredible skills of the
restoration team
that have reconstructed the building and saved the frescoes.

&quot;This is a stunning addition to the treasure trove of Welsh history
contained in St Fagans.&quot;

Curator Gerallt Nash said: &quot;Before we actually started the work of
dismantling the building,
we carried out a rescue operation to uncover what was hidden away
beneath layer upon layers of lime wash.

&quot;That was when we found the amazing series of wall paintings here.&quot;

The congregation inside St Teilo's church

The congregation gathered inside the rebuilt church

The discovery influenced the decision to reconstruct the church as it
would have looked in the 16th Century - prior to the Reformation.

&quot;Most of the people who do remember it there and who remember going to
services there in the summer will have quite a surprise, because it's
going to be 'dressed up' as it were in its medieval guise.

Sometimes four Khands (regions) have been described.  They are
supported and sustained by the Shabd, Nam, or Holy Spirit, which
Shakespeare often called &quot;Art.&quot;  Good one.

MM:
Similarly, five main stages have been described in mysticism.  The
&quot;art of V,&quot; could be the Shabd (Sound) of each particular one.  If it
does not adorn us, it means that we should forbear the dust of the old
dead Master, and look for the living, breathing Master, to follow him
to the True Home.  Good one.

&gt; you might know this.  Furthermore, gravestone rhymes like this one
&gt; (I'm sure) were common and would have had time to become standard
&gt; enough for any doggerelist to use.  I wasn't there, and I lack your

&gt; circumstance, so I don't know how the rhyme was chosen for the grave,
&gt; but my hunch is that Shakespeare did voice his superstition enough for
&gt; whoever was in charge of his burial to grab a standard don't move
&gt; these bones rhyme for the gravestone.- Hide quoted text -

Basic question here -- I'm grateful to Lyra for posting this, btw;
I tried posting it a few weeks ago, asking for opinions, but
Google apparently flaked --

What makes you say this is doggerel?  I've come across that
opinion before, and don't see it.

Is there a consensus on this evalutation?

Conrad.

ps - Was all Jesus's poetry doggerel?

(quote, excerpts)

As far back as the Roman period, Livy - writing in around 17 AD -
described how Celtic warriors decorated skulls with gold and used them
for drinking cups and for offerings to their gods. It is believed that
this was the origin of such practices as those seen not too long ago
with the famous St. Teilo's skull.

St. Teilo's well is in Wales, at Llandeilo Llwydarth, where the water
is renowned the world over for its healing abilities. The skull,
Penglog Teilo, is said to be the oldest surviving Welsh skull, still
used for healing purposes - indicating the fact that there were indeed
many others. At Carmarthen the skull of Ffynnon Llandyfaen was used in
the same way - as was the skull of a Welsh nobleman named Gruffydd ap
Adda ap Dafydd.

In a paper published in 1893 Sir John Thys cited the examples of
Ffynnon Elian and Ffynnon Deilo as remnants of the priestly caste of
'well keepers', which had survived into modern times. But why would
this practice have occurred? Why would it be so widespread and so
ancient?

``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` ``````````````````````````

But, we can still see the skull or head being associated with the
healing waters of the serpent deity. We were amazed to discover that
virtually the same story is to be discovered in the stories of the
founding Saint of the Sinclair family - the same family intricately
linked with the Templars, the Holy Grail, Rosslyn Chapel and the
Masons.

We also find that the patron Saint of the Sinclair's is actually St.
Katherine, who is often pictured holding the sword, which severed her
head!

&gt; Archbishop opens medieval church

&gt; The restoration included colourful wall paintings, uncovered during
&gt; dismantling

&gt; A 13th Century church, which was dismantled and rebuilt 50 miles away
&gt; at a museum in Cardiff,
&gt; has been opened by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

&gt; St Teilo's Church has been recreated stone-by-stone over 20 years at
&gt; the National History Museum, St Fagans.

&gt; The church from Pontarddulais near Swansea has been restored to
&gt; recreate its appearance in 1520.

&gt; Copies of a rare series of 16th Century paintings, which were
&gt; uncovered as it was being dismantled, adorn the walls.

&gt; First Minister Rhodri Morgan also attended the ceremony with the
&gt; archbishop, Dr Rowan Williams.

&gt; The first minister said: &quot;I have watched the incredible skills of the
&gt; restoration team
&gt;  that have reconstructed the building and saved the frescoes.

&gt; &quot;This is a stunning addition to the treasure trove of Welsh history
&gt; contained in St Fagans.&quot;

&gt; Curator Gerallt Nash said: &quot;Before we actually started the work of
&gt; dismantling the building,
&gt; we carried out a rescue operation to uncover what was hidden away
&gt; beneath layer upon layers of lime wash.

&gt; &quot;That was when we found the amazing series of wall paintings here.&quot;

&gt; The congregation inside St Teilo's church

&gt; The congregation gathered inside the rebuilt church

&gt; The discovery influenced the decision to reconstruct the church as it
&gt; would have looked in the 16th Century - prior to the Reformation.

&gt; &quot;Most of the people who do remember it there and who remember going to
&gt; services there in the summer will have quite a surprise, because it's
&gt; going to be 'dressed up' as it were in its medieval guise.

It isn't the universities who are mandating that policy, either.
Anybody who uses the computer facilities at a university library will
know that the extra security on the online databases is on account of
the publishers' refusing to make their databases available even to
universities unless the universities agree to extremely tight
restrictions on who has access.  In my experience universities go to
some lengths to ensure they're in compliance with that policy
(instituting two or more tiers of access, if necessary, to ensure they
can't be accused of opening the door to anybody and everybody).

In the case of articles on nuclear physics, for example, it makes
sense.  You wouldn't want just anybody to have access to this sort of
thing.

MM:
Reminds me of the story of Saint Sarmad.  Reportedly he was beheaded,
then held his own head high proclaiming that he was God.  After this
demonstration, his Master, Bhika,  told him to die, now that he had
proved his omnipotence.  Here is one account of that story:

http://mail.sarai.net/pipermail/reader-list/2003-September/003051.html

It is here that Sarmad, the digambar (nude/ skyclad)
Sufi fell in love with Abhay Chand, the Hindu
merchant's son.. and renounced the world. It is here
that Aurangzeb ordered his execution.. apparently for
'insulting Islam', but essentially for befriending
Dara and influencing the masses of Delhi with his
blending message..
Three executioners tried unsuccessfully to behead
him.. till Sarmad himself handed Abhay Chand the
sword..singing' Come my beloved, in whatsoever garb
thou come, I recognise thee well'..His severed head
walked the steps of the Jama Masjid before thousands
of Dilliwalas and had to be restrained from destroying
the whole city..the legend says. He was followed by
the Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur, who he and Dara Shikoh
loved dearly- beheaded at Gurudwara Sheesh(Head) Ganj,
again in the heart of Chandni Chowk.

The Mughals were never to regain their glory..and
Dara's grave was never found.
But then, this is Dilli..

MM:
Guru Tegh Bahadur was also a Saint, in the line from Guru Nanak.
Sarmad wrote some beautiful rubaiyats.  He extolls the Sant Mat
teachings in them, referring to the Shabd, Nam, or Holy Spirit, as
&quot;Wine,&quot; in the same style as Omar Khayyam.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Just as a matter of interest (and forgive me if I
&gt; &gt;&gt; wrongly assume that you didn't have *all* of these in
&gt; &gt;&gt; your own memory!) which database would you use for a
&gt; &gt;&gt; search like this - JSTOR?

&gt; &gt; No, it's a thing of wonder and beauty called Literature Online or LION,
a
&gt; &gt; more or less comprehensive (up to C20) searchable database of published
&gt; &gt; English literature published by Chadwyck-Healey.  Unfortunately it's not
&gt; &gt; free (my university subscribes) but it's an extraordinarily useful
research
&gt; &gt; tool.

&gt; It's a shame that it's not in the hands
&gt; of anyone who could use it.

It's certainly of no use to a fantasist like Crowley, who (in any case)

MM:
I saw a program on TV last night.  It was about incorruptible bodies
of so-called Holy People.  One is 700 years old, enclosed in a glass
case, and the public views it as a tourist attraction.  Science is at
a loss why their bodies don't decompose in a normal fashion.  They
were not embalmed, either.  There are a lot of them, and the Catholic
Church used to canonize those people, thinking it was proof of
holiness, according to the program, anyway.  There were so many of
them, that the Catholic Church stopped that practice, however.

Maybe that is what Shakespeare wanted to avoid, becoming a tourist
attraction in death?

Ye Olde Giftshop

The arrival of the Jubilee brought with it the mass production of
Shakespeare souvenirs. Garrick's literary agent, Thomas Beckett,
proclaimed himself the official bookseller of the Jubilee, but the
plays, pictures and songbooks that he was selling were all directly
related to Garrick and the Jubilee, rather than Shakespeare alone.

The first day of the Jubilee was a success but then it started to rain
heavily. Garrick tried to continue the celebrations on the second day,
but the rains proved to be too much. The firework display was ruined
and the specially built rotunda (a replica of Garrick's personal
shrine to Shakespeare) was submerged under half a foot of water.

The rain only added to other problems, such as a lack of
accommodation, huge amounts of traffic and the general chaos of the
event. Garrick was forced to cancel the activities on the third day,
much to the annoyance of many.

The one highlight was Garrick's performance of his Ode Upon Dedicating
A Building And, Erecting A Statue, To Shakespeare, At Stratford-upon-
Avon. Despite the rain and floods, people crammed into the rotunda to
hear Garrick's now famous dedication - the greatest performance of his
life.

&gt; Archbishop opens medieval church

&gt; The restoration included colourful wall paintings, uncovered during
&gt; dismantling

&gt; A 13th Century church, which was dismantled and rebuilt 50 miles away
&gt; at a museum in Cardiff,
&gt; has been opened by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

&gt; St Teilo's Church has been recreated stone-by-stone over 20 years at
&gt; the National History Museum, St Fagans.

&gt; The church from Pontarddulais near Swansea has been restored to
&gt; recreate its appearance in 1520.

&gt; Copies of a rare series of 16th Century paintings, which were
&gt; uncovered as it was being dismantled, adorn the walls.

&gt; First Minister Rhodri Morgan also attended the ceremony with the
&gt; archbishop, Dr Rowan Williams.

&gt; The first minister said: &quot;I have watched the incredible skills of the
&gt; restoration team
&gt;  that have reconstructed the building and saved the frescoes.

&gt; &quot;This is a stunning addition to the treasure trove of Welsh history
&gt; contained in St Fagans.&quot;

&gt; Curator Gerallt Nash said: &quot;Before we actually started the work of
&gt; dismantling the building,
&gt; we carried out a rescue operation to uncover what was hidden away
&gt; beneath layer upon layers of lime wash.

&gt; &quot;That was when we found the amazing series of wall paintings here.&quot;

&gt; The congregation inside St Teilo's church

&gt; The congregation gathered inside the rebuilt church

&gt; The discovery influenced the decision to reconstruct the church as it
&gt; would have looked in the 16th Century - prior to the Reformation.

&gt; &quot;Most of the people who do remember it there and who remember going to
&gt; services there in the summer will have quite a surprise, because it's
&gt; going to be 'dressed up' as it were in its medieval guise.

Rotunda in Starý Plzenec (Old Pilsen near Pilsen, Czech Republic),
from the 10th century.
Beehive, Wellington, NZ
Rotunda - Öskü, Hungary.

A rotunda is any building with a circular ground plan, often covered
by a dome. It can also refer to a round room within a building (a
famous example being within the United States Capitol in Washington,
D.C.). The Pantheon in Rome is a famous rotunda. A Band Rotunda is a
circular bandstand, usually with a dome. Several cities have buildings
referred to as &quot;the Rotunda,&quot; among them:

The Pantheon, Rome, Italy, originally built as a temple to the seven
deities of the seven planets in the state religion of Ancient Rome.

The Church of the Rotonda in Thessaloniki, built as the &quot;Tomb of
Galerius&quot; in 306 AD.

For me, the interesting thing is what was there *before*
the monument was erected. We know that Shakespeare died
on 23rd April 1616, and was buried (we don't actually
know where) two days later, on Thursday 25th.

From E.I. Fripp, however, we learn the following about the
condition of Holy Trinity's chancel two years later:

&quot;The Chancel was pronounced 'ruinous' in 1618, the Cor-
poration resolved 'to bestow some charges' on keeping
it 'dry' in 1619, and they were presented by Quyney and
the churchwardens ... for its 'decay' in April 1621. In
1621-2 the walls were 'mended' and 'painted' and the
windows 'glazed', and the building was presentable, for
the first time since the Poet's interment, when his old
friends and fellow-actors of the King's Company paid
their one and only visit to Stratford, presumably to
see his monument, in the Summer of 1622.&quot;

It therefore seems almost certain that the erection of the
monument would have been undertaken at the same time as
the major work on the chancel was being done.

However, it is the monument which apparently supplies the
name of the person buried beneath it. So I wonder:

a) whether Shakespeare was even buried there originally,
and, if not, (given that the words on the tombstone don't
actually say he is there) whether his remains ever were
actually transferred to the grave we now assume to be his.

b) what it actually said on his grave during the five or so
years following April 1616, when there was no monument
to identify the occupant.

No, it is not certain, nor even almost. For all we know, the
installation of a new monument to Shakespeare might have been the
incentive for the refurbishing of the chancel. As inheritors of the
parish tithes and therefore lay rectors, the family might have
complained of the condition of the burial site. Again, we just don't
know, but these possibilities are just as likely as your scenario.

I'm sure there is more to be learned from close inspection of the
monument and the extant records.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Just as a matter of interest (and forgive me if I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wrongly assume that you didn't have *all* of these in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your own memory!) which database would you use for a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; search like this - JSTOR?

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, it's a thing of wonder and beauty called Literature Online or LION,
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; more or less comprehensive (up to C20) searchable database of published
&gt; &gt; &gt; English literature published by Chadwyck-Healey.  Unfortunately it's not
&gt; &gt; &gt; free (my university subscribes) but it's an extraordinarily useful
&gt; research
&gt; &gt; &gt; tool.

&gt; &gt; It's a shame that it's not in the hands
&gt; &gt; of anyone who could use it.

&gt; &gt; Paul.

&gt; It's certainly of no use to a fantasist like Crowley, who (in any case)
&gt; produces all his material from a more fundamental source.

I don't agree, Dr. Groves. Imagine the hours of fun Crowley could have
with keyword searches under scatological terms!

There had been pressure for the Chancel's refurbishment for
a couple of decades at least before Shakespeare's death.
Fripp also tells us that

&quot;In 1593 the Chancel of the Church was in a bad state,
and the Corporation moved Lord Treasurer Burleigh (the
Chancel was Crown property) to compel the tithe-holders
to put it in repair; and not long after obtaining it as
a grant from the Crown, they proceeded to bring pressure
upon these gentlemen, of whom Shakespeare was one, and
to sell, or let, the right of burial within its walls.
Shakespeare was buried here in 1616; but it was not
until his monument was erected, or was about to be
erected, that they had the place made less unworthy of
its illustrious dead.&quot;

We also have Schoenbaum's comment (in his Compact Documentary
Life, p.10):

&quot;The church's harmonious interior proportions have,
however, survived the vicissitudes (the chancel fell
into decay and was boarded up; two years after Shake-
speare's burial there, it was declared 'ruinous').&quot;

It seems to me very unlikely that such a highly expensive
monument would have been erected in a place apparently shut
off to the public because of the ruinous state it was in.
Does it not also seem quite likely to you that the only
time the King's Men ever visited Stratford (1622) - given
that they were not to play there - might have been to attend
the unveiling of the monument to their fellow Shakespeare
in the church's newly renovated chancel?

In fact I would go further, and say that the erection of
the monument and the publication of the First Folio were
two parts of a single project, the same people being behind
both of them, and both scheduled for completion in 1622 -
the year when the FF had been intended to make its first
appearance at the Frankfurt Book Fair.

The only doubts I have about what both Fripp and Schoenbaum
say (and for the same reason) is whether Shakespeare was
indeed buried there in 1616, or whether this is something
that they just assume because there is no record of his
having ever been interred anywhere else and it being gen-
erally accepted that he is buried there now.

The fact that his wife is buried there also supports it as the

Right now I would just like to know the extent of what is known now!

On my next trip to Stratford I plan to ask permission to cloesly
inspect the monument and take measurements and photographs. Perhaps
there are some photographs that were taken the last time it was
dismantled.

Given the site, the likeliest problem was rising damp. The placing of
the monument quite high on the wall ( a common practice in similar
churches with similar problems) suggests that this may have been the
issue.

We can say for sure that he was buried somewhere and given what we
know about Shakespeare's standing in the community the burial in the
chancel seems just about the only place he would have been buried.
There are a number of reasons to suppose Shakespeare anticipated his
death and took some interest in the disposal of his remains. I'm
interested too in the mention of a stone in the chancel marking his
resting place in addition to the stone containing the famous
adjuration concerning his bones (which reflects Shakespeare's
knowledge of the burial arrangements over the generations in the
church).

Only the one I quoted: E.I. Fripp's &quot;Shakespeare's Stratford&quot;
(p.74). As Fripp was also the editor of the &quot;Minutes and
Accounts of the Corporation of Stratford upon Avon and other
records (1553-1620)&quot; I guess he must be a fairly reliable
source. He continued:

&quot;...the building was presentable, for the first time
since the Poet's interment, when his old friends and
fellow-actors of the King's Company paid their one and
only visit to Stratford, presumably to see his monument,
in the Summer of 1622. Kemp, Pope, Phillips, Bryan long-
since, and Burbage of late, were dead; but others of
his once matchless brotherhood survived -- Lowin, Gough,
Tooley, Shanks, Underwood, and the editors of the forth-
coming Folio-edition of his Plays, Heminge and Condell.
It is significant of the change of mind in Stratford
with regard to the stage, as of the change in the char-
acter of the drama, that even those men were forbidden
to perform in the Gild Hall and were paid 6s. as a
*solatium*.&quot;

&gt; &gt; In fact I would go further, and say that the erection of
&gt; &gt; the monument and the publication of the First Folio were
&gt; &gt; two parts of a single project, the same people being behind
&gt; &gt; both of them, and both scheduled for completion in 1622 -
&gt; &gt; the year when the FF had been intended to make its first
&gt; &gt; appearance at the Frankfurt Book Fair.

&gt; &gt; The only doubts I have about what both Fripp and Schoenbaum
&gt; &gt; say (and for the same reason) is whether Shakespeare was
&gt; &gt; indeed buried there in 1616, or whether this is something
&gt; &gt; that they just assume because there is no record of his
&gt; &gt; having ever been interred anywhere else and it being gen-
&gt; &gt; erally accepted that he is buried there now.

&gt; The fact that his wife is buried there also supports it
&gt; as the original grave site.

Not really. It supports it being where his remains were by
1623, when she was buried next to him, but not necessarily
where he was between 1616 and whenever the monument was
erected.

The point I am making is that the inscription on the grave
makes no sense without the monument being there *as well*.
Therefore the tombstone (if it *is* Shakespeare's) and the
monument must have been created at the same time. So what
was written over his grave (wherever it was) in the five
years or so before that? And why was it changed?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, it is the monument which apparently supplies the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name of the person buried beneath it. So I wonder:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a) whether Shakespeare was even buried there originally,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and, if not, (given that the words on the tombstone don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually say he is there) whether his remains ever were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually transferred to the grave we now assume to be his.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b) what it actually said on his grave during the five or so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years following April 1616, when there was no monument
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to identify the occupant.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure there is more to be learned from close inspection
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the monument and the extant records.

&gt; &gt; So am I.

&gt; Right now I would just like to know the extent of what is
&gt; known now!

&gt; On my next trip to Stratford I plan to ask permission to
&gt; closely inspect the monument and take measurements and
&gt; photographs. Perhaps there are some photographs that were
&gt; taken the last time it was dismantled.

Good luck! Please keep us posted.

I'm not following you here.

Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,
To digg the dvst encloased heare.
Blest be [th]e man [tha]t spares thes stones,
And cvrst be he [tha]t moves my bones.

How is the sense of the inscription dependent upon the monument being
present also? Why couldn't that have been there and then the monument
installed years later?

Why was what changed?

&quot;It would perhaps be the greatest stratfordian joke of all if his

the essence of the joke then being, the expressed admonition not to
dig in the dust (a covert suggestion or provocation for posterity to
really do it some day?) in order NOT to find any bones. IF there are
bones there, and if they be Shakspere's, then there is no issue and no
joke, but if there is nothing, where then are the bones? Should they
be dug for somewhere else? Maybe the issue should be investigated? We
are all eager to know the truth.
