This quote from the review of I'm Not There on indieWIRE:

&quot;Cate Blanchett portrays a version of Bob Dylan at his most familiar,
in the mid-'60s during his infamous transition from folk to rock
music&quot;

reminds me of something a couple were quoted as saying in a review
from a few years back, when asked what makes them still attend Dylan
concerts.  Having been going since the 60's, they said they regarded
the shows they saw in London in 1966 as the peak of Dylan's concert
performances, and added that it doesn't matter how bad he is nowadays,
when they clap they are &quot;applauding the memory&quot;.  It seems the media
in general take this view, as Dylan circa 1965-66 is the Dylan most
regularly harked back to in newspaper roundups, and his image from
that time is used most often for magazine covers etc.  Why do the
media in general seem to have such difficulty accepting Bob as he is
now, and feel the need to immortalise him as a 25 year old?  Oh well,
we know better - don't we?

When I first joined this board I was that way too. But the efforts of
the many Dylan fans here have broadened my perspective on Bob and I see
that he has made a great deal of great music since 1966.  And I'm also a
bit more keen on his current public image.  I don't need Bob to be
forever young.

What you stay strikes me as very true. I would add, however, that Bob
Dylan's publicity people also play that card and they play it mightily
in terms of what they release and the art work they use to release it
and the overall image they want to project of the guy.  Also, in all
fairness to the media (which I give very grudgingly and only for these
30 seconds), the Dylan phenomenon as
we know it has the media's carbon footprint all over it.  From the NYT
at the very first to heavy New York and SF backing from the press,
this guy got a very nice ride so to some degree they did earn it and--
what he understandably resent the most--they ended up owning a small
piece of him.  Bob Dylan was a very media friendly artist, I think
it's fair to say.

Because, especially after the Scoresese documentary, that is widely
seen as Dylan's high watermark, the time or year when he had
solidified his revolutionary songwriting and performing stance and
taken it worldwide...

Other icons are often depicted at the height of their powers and
influence or at their watershed moment, when the world listened,
looked, absorbed, and changed...  Churchill during the Blitz...
MacArthur returning to Fiji... Marilyn Monroe skipping subway fare...
James Dean posing in a red windbreaker...  The Beatles arrival in
America in 1964...  JFK as President...  Lincoln with full beard as
President...  Maybe the media consensus is that Dylan '65-66 is his
most impactful and lasting image...

The only competition Dylan has from himself in this realm of his
'65-66 imagery and song are his 'Freewheelin' protest era, and his
BOTT/RTR days...  There is no other serious contender in Dylan lore,
unless you count the 'Soy Bomb' appearance...  At least they chose
Dylan's arguably coolest and artistically challenging...  The 'RAH'
Bootleg Series release is hardly 'easy listening', nor is 'Highway 61
Revisited'...  The closest Dylan comes to lite-FM during that period
is 'She Belongs To Me' off BIABH...

The media, however, does go through cycles, and though Scorsese's NDH
has left the impression of the '65-'66 Dylan deeply in its wake, that
could all change to something else someday...  But the concentrated
intensity of the unself-conscious Dylan of that period (or is it that
he was totally immersed in self-consciousness and subconsciiousness?),
that period will be seen as his most intense, world-changing, and
productive, simply because it was...  No one can change that...  It
happened...

Also, perhaps a lot of people are under the impression that, since NDH
ends in 1966, that there isn't really much of interest beyond that if
the documentary didn't even bother to go there...

Yeah, but you'd imagine that everyone who's seen NDH (and it must be a
lot - plenty of non Bob fans I know were keen to see it) must be
equally familiar with modern day Bob as they are with 1966 Bob, seeing
as 2004 Bob is as visible in it as any other.  You can still recognise
Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney in the tabloids - there were shots of
Jagger dancing in the street in London's 'Metro' at the weekend - I
would imagine anyone who's seen NDH must be able to do the same with
current Bob.  Mind you, not if they used stills from CTGM, the M&amp;A
premiere or Newport 2002.  Maybe a lot of publicity shots the papers
get sent are too weird to use in a story that isn't about how weird
Bob Dylan looks.  His appearance has changed about as often as his
voice I guess.  There's a nice picture at the top of the Wikipedia
page, from 2006 by the way

The line was &quot;most familiar.&quot;  In the mid-60s Dylan changed the music world
and to some extent the culture.  For the last 25 years his music hasn't done
anything of the sort.

If her &quot;Kate&quot; is any indication, Cate Blanchett doesn't know the difference
between imitating and acting.  Caricatures, actually.  But I guess '66 Dylan
is a good candidate for caricature.

Yeah, I meant to add the Scorsese show to the publicity machine that
keeps Dylan frozen in that time period. At this late date with so much
having happened between 66 and now, it's extraordinary that Scorsese's
show was as predictable as it was in its focus, theme,
etc....predictable, that is, if it had been done by some run of the
mill film maker or ad agency.  There just wasn't anything especially
Scorsese about the show with the possible exception of the very open
and the Hard Rain's Gonna Fall montage with Dallas.   Did his pact
with the devil or the  Commander In Chief or whomever it was with run
out at the end of 66 and he chose not to renew?

I think that you are mistaken here.  I'd think that the vast majority
of people who've seen NoDirectionHome know him not much past Tangled
Up .  I also think that the generation that was coming of age after
66, the generation that was developing around Iggy, MC5, Bowie, prog,
Johnny Thunders, the Dolls, 13 Fl. Elevators, etc., did not revere him
anywhere near as much as his contempos did--well not openly, anyway.
Somebody recently mentioned that Dellesandro scene about still reading
Dylan liner notes.  In the film, that was a put down.  So even though
Dylan returned to the scene in the mid-70's and continued doing great,
bround-greaking stuff right through the Christian records, the press,
other musicians, etc. kept him pretty locked up in that cage.  He's
really the only one who could change the public perception of him, but
he chooses not to as demonstrated by No Direction.  When you consider
a career like Frank Sinatra's that has so many distinct, sui generis
periods which are recognized as such in most peoples' minds, it's too
bad that Dylan doesn't promote the same aspects in himself.  I know it
would be a schlep to do that after all the 65-66 Canonization that's
already gone forward, but releasing a 64 Philharmonic Hall concert
doesn't really widen the frame.

There was a Mojo Magazine interview with Siouxsie from the Banshees
this month.  She ends up walking out of the interview because she
becomes so exasperated with the interviewer asking her about the Punk
days when she wants to talk about her new album.

Unfortunately the media is reactive.  It can only describe what has
long gone.  It is up to people like us to keep spreading the word
about the current artists we love so that they don't become entombed
and fossilized.

In Siouxsie's case the media are only interested in the time she wore
a Nazi armband as a 16 year old.  In Bob's it is the Judas shout.
Both incidents are just incidental details, of course.

Do you remember the Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson routine from Monty
Python?  That said it all.

Sinatra didn't really fare any better in his know-for image-scope...
The Capitol years, c. 1953-59, were the iconic image of a fedora'd
Sinatra, pre-Kennedy years, happy-go-lucky yet lonesome and yearning
actor singer dating a bevy of Hollywood actresses while still legally
wed...  Runner up, and probably now in the lead is the early '60s, pre-
Beatles Frank with the Rat Pack, Vegas stirred and in tux, slightly
drunk and irreverent...  The Bobby Sox Sinatra is still very viable,
though, with the force of the War behind it... (Dylan's protest
period)?...  No other Sinatras need apply...

Overall, however, Sinatra was and probably will be considered in
history to have been a slightly bigger star than Dylan, whatever their
respective accomplishments really are...

Duets is really the only thing that pulled the latter-day Sinatra out
of media-image obscurity, as far as a cross-generational
presentation...  Otherwise, he was seen, before the Tony Bennet/Harry
Connick boom, as being someone's parents' music, Pills and Booze,
rather than Bugz and Drugz...

Well, right there you've mentioned a bigger breadth of periods than
Mr. Dylan has in the public mind.  And yes you're right, Sinatra will
be remembered as much bigger.  There are many many reasons for this
that cover so many different things about the individuals, the kind of
music, the zeitigests and so forth, but a very important difference is
that Sinatra's fans kind of grew up with him and stayed loyal to him--
even through to the end when he came back with his Main Event stuff.
In other words he stayed relevant to his fans.  In other words please
be true.

Dylan's grasp on the public imagination is more subtle, though, and is
disseminated through other artists...  For instance, someone might
never realize that Dylan changed the way the Beatles wrote songs... or
that their acoustic guitar playing became more focal and intricate or
aggressive during a time because of Dylan's effect on them...  Those
things might or might not be apparent to people in general, but those
things are there in the music and the recorded performances...
Whenever the Eagles (whose Greatest Hits is, oddly enough, the biggest
selling record of all-time) rear their ugly feathers, Roger McGuinn
should get a royalty...

There are some other recognizable periods to the public at large than
just the ones I mentioned for Dylan...  The 'We Are The World'/Live
Aid days were pretty front and center at the time... as well as the
'Lovesick'-period where Dylan was all over the media...  And what
other singer is widely known for having a voice that anyone can parody
with an indecipherable, grizzled, phase-phrased vocal squabble?...
Not many other singers can make that claim...

Sinatra's public image might not be a clear cut as we may think,
either, anymore... especially with members of his generation dying off
fairly rapidly...  'As Time Goes By'... indeed...

Dylan has stayed relevant to more than just his fans.  And his legacy
is something we can only guess at now.  Sinatra will be remembered as
one of the greatest singers who ever lived.  But he didn't write songs
and he was not to my knowledge quoted by presidents.

Dylan, yesterday, was included on the school curriculum here in
England as a compulsory part of key stage 3.  He is more properly set
aside giants like Shakespeare / Keats / Picasso / Michelangelo than
singers.

I think you'll be surprised to see how many of his fans have stayed
with him when the final reckoning comes.  Modern Times was number 1 in
many countries around the world and there is hardly a singer or
songwriter these days who does not acknowledge a debt to Dylan.  He
has also changed our use of language, which changes the way we think.

&gt; Dylan's grasp on the public imagination is more subtle, though, and is

Without a doubt Dylan writes songs and gets quoted by all sorts of

themselves, as performed by him, aren't heard on prospective

I'm afraid I don't know key stage 3.  It sounds like a weight

The media in the US and the media in Britain cover Bob a bit
differently. His iconic rock star image of the sixties is still in
full sway in UK publications such as Mojo, Uncut, Word, Q, et. al. We
really only have RS to compare, and they cover Bob contemporaenously.
Occasionally an American magazine will do a nostalgia piece, but
that's it. No constant or chronic reprises.

Here, Bob has lots of images. Compare for a moment the images of
Elvis, Presley that is.

Elvis has how many images? Two, three, four? Greaser Elvis, Movie Star
Elvis and Las Vegas Elvis. Gospel Elvis wasn't a phase but perpetual
spin-out. Army Elvis is in there too, but the DoD hasn't discovered or
can't afford its marketing value in recruitment yet. To date, he is
either pictured in his tight jeans and carefully coiffed pompadour or
in a gold lame jumpsuit wearing wicked sideburns.

How many media images has Bob? Let's see, there's Folk Bob, Rock Bob,
Dad Bob, Road Show Bob, Gospel Bob, Commercial Bob, Musicology Bob and
Elder Statesman Bob. In the UK, Rock Bob rules.  But here in the US,
Bob is pictured in a variety of media images such as in a work shirt
and tousled hair or in polka dots with Ray-Bans and an afro or with
scruffy beard and a jeans jacket and harp rack or wearing a broad
brimmed hat with fancy band and a vest or in any of his period pieces,
including country gentleman, southern dandy, range rider or western
chic.

Objectively, the image that dominates is the one that serves the
commercial interests of his business at the time. The subjective image
that dominates is the one that fastened us to Bob in the first place,
either temporally, or musically. At least that's what it looks like to
me.

RS prides itself on being up to date... and if they run old pictures,
it's within an article with a current story...  Many of the magazines
from UK mentioned above thrive on selling history pieces...  Mojo
started out doing nothing but that; that was their m.o. to do mostly
history articles and features...  Q was always half and half...  Uncut
used to try to cover everything, even having movie subject-matter on
their covers, but have since opted for the Mojo model...  The '66
Dylan predominates in England, probably because there is so much stock
photo imagery of him from the '66 UK tour...  Also, maybe that is seen
as the 'sexy' Dylan, and sex sells...  They have covered other eras,
but the Dylan in shades a la James Dean before the crash is the one
that currently holds sway...  Maybe there's the danger of a guy
seemingly fully in control and totally out of control that is
mesmerizing... thus, the proliferation of '66 imagery...  Again, the
NDH doc. reinforces such choices to the media...

Also... even geniuses are seen as having their quota, as far as how
much of an examination of their greatness can be foisted onto the
general public...  People get sick of being told about how great
someone is...  Change the world once?...  Great...  Change the world
three or four times?...  Boring...  Dylan is seen as having changed
the music world once (if not twice), primarily during the NDH
period... and sometimes that's all that the media, as well as the
public, are willing to put up with...  Anything else can lead to
widespread schizophrenia...

&gt; &gt;Elvis has how many images? Two, three, four? Greaser Elvis, Movie Star

&gt; Elvis and Las Vegas Elvis. Gospel Elvis wasn't a phase but perpetual
&gt; spin-out.

&gt; The &quot;gospel Elvis&quot; existed throughout his career.  The other images you
&gt; mentioned follow the chronology.

&gt; &gt;Army Elvis is in there too, but the DoD hasn't discovered or can't afford

&gt; its marketing value in recruitment yet.

&gt; Elvis was drafted.  It's a famous image (and event) with dubious recruitment
&gt; value today.

&gt; &gt;Objectively, the image that dominates is the one that serves the commercial

&gt; interests of his business at the time.

We need a horse named Polemic to race against the horse named Apologia.

Thanks. How Great Thou Art illuminated a facet that stayed bright and
had historic impact.

Indeed he was. I remember it well. A real patriot, he was, and served
publicly. But it ain't over yet. We've a long way to go before we find
the walkin' line... See those commercials advertising the war yet?

Cash flow is king; whatever moves the merch makes it, in market
culture, that is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you don't seriously mean to say that people

&gt; &gt; &gt; that many listenings.

&gt; &gt; I think that it's worth noting that the same people who say Bob's
&gt; &gt; voice is shot, and insist that this is fact not opinion, also claim
&gt; &gt; Modern Times does not stand up to repeated listenings (!!!). And yet ,
&gt; &gt; a while back, it was said that negativity was all in certain rmd'ers
&gt; &gt; imaginations.

&gt; &gt; Bob live currently: rubbish.
&gt; &gt; Bob's latest album: no good.

&gt; &gt; Negativity on rmd? As if.

&gt; Not that I don't find this continuing argument fundamentally stupid,
&gt; but that's a straw argument if I ever saw one, considering that
....
&gt; I'm
&gt; one of the people saying that Bob's voice ain't what it used to be (I
&gt; think I settled on &quot;wounded&quot;) but Modern Times is quite good.

Very sorry but you're on the black list.  You've been pulled out of
the line.  They just want to ask you a few questions.  Nothing to get
too worried about.  No, you don't need to bring any belongings.  Just
yourself will do.
