The heretics, cultists and unbelievers I have been encountering on Usenet
have one thing in common that I have noticed -- a marked dishonesty when it
comes to the Holy Scriptures. They have to lie, misrepresent and use all
sorts of deception to try to support their antiBiblical stances. However
it's really no surprise since the source of all their antiBiblical stances
is the father of all lies, Satan. God abhors dishonesty and He abhors those
dishonest tactics used to try to bolster unBiblical teachings. He warned us
as Christians to watch out for those who teach falsely and to reject utterly
those false teachings. He told us to study the Holy Scriptures so we would
be able to discern the counterfeit from the legitimate. And when we rightly
do, it makes the heretics, false teachers and haters of God angry. I mean
spitting mad angry. And that's because they can't handle the truth of God.
Danny Hall's sermon has to do with the topic of honesty, something that is
impossible for the antiBiblical crowd to exhibit. I urge my Christian
brethren to read this Biblically-based article.

May God bless,

TO TELL THE TRUTH
by Danny Hall

As I have been studying the Sermon on the Mount, I have been amazed at how
absolutely applicable it is to our contemporary society. It is as if Jesus
were looking down the corridor of time right to where we live when he was
speaking about these things. As the saying goes, the more things change, the
more they stay the same. Cultures and circumstances may change, but the
sinfulness of the human heart has never changed.

All kinds of things point to the fact that dishonesty is rampant in our
society. Here are a few examples:

Last week four men connected with BALCO Laboratories here in the Bay Area
were indicted for designing and distributing performance-enhancing steroids
to athletes. The most famous of their alleged clients was Barry Bonds,
although nothing has been proven about him personally. Performance-enhancing
drugs are intended for one thing: to enable athletes to cheat, to give them
an edge over their competitors. There is much money to be made both by those
selling the steroids and by the athletes who use them, as their statistics
go up and their value increases.

We are in the middle of the Martha Stewart trial, which is again about
cheating the system.

Recently there was a huge scandal at Saratoga High School about some
students' breaking in using some high-tech gizmos to steal answers to tests.

As we approach tax season it is a standard joke that people are not always
exactly honest on their income tax returns.

This is an election year, so we will be bombarded by promises and
accusations, a lot of truths and half-truths and no truth at all, all mixed
together in a frenzy of campaigning by candidates to get elected.

Besides all these big examples, there is the proverbial little white lie
that all of us every now and then reserve the right to use. Many times
across my career as a pastor, the question has come up, particularly with
other pastors, &quot;How many people attend your church?&quot; We pastors use
&quot;ministerial math&quot; and evangelistic crusade estimates to answer that
question. Somehow we are driven to present our church as being a little
better than the other guy's. And sometimes you are trapped; you don't even
know how to avoid the little white lie. Any of us who are husbands know what
it is like to have to answer the question, &quot;Does this make me look fat?&quot;

Part of our problem is that we have grown very comfortable with the shading
of the truth. We assume that everyone has an agenda through which they
filter truth. We call it spinning the truth in order to make it suit their
purposes, and that is somehow supposed to make it acceptable. We live in a
culture that really is characterized by dishonesty.

But this is nothing new. We're going to look at a passage that focuses on
similar issues that Jesus confronted in his day. Matthew 5:33-37:

Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, &quot;You shall not make false
vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.&quot; But I say to you, make no
oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth,
for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of
the great King. Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make
one hair white or black. But let your statement be, &quot;Yes, yes&quot; or &quot;No, no&quot;;
anything beyond these is of evil.

God values honesty

In order to understand what Jesus is talking about, we need to look at the
Old-Testament antecedents. The term &quot;false vows&quot; means perjury, deliberately
lying when others expect you to fulfill an oath. The term &quot;fulfill your
vows&quot; literally means to fence or box yourself in, to put a boundary around
yourself. So when you make an oath, you fence yourself in to tell the truth.

Oath-making has a lot of background in the Old-Testament Law. Leviticus
19:12 says, &quot;You shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the
name of your God; I am the Lord .&quot; Numbers 30:2 says, &quot;If a man makes a vow
to the Lord , or takes an oath to bind himself with a binding obligation, he
shall not violate his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out
of his mouth.&quot; Deuteronomy 23:21-23 says, &quot;When you make a vow to the L ord
your God, you shall not delay to pay it, for it would be sin in you, and the
L ord your God will surely require it of you. However, if you refrain from
vowing, it would not be sin in you. You shall be careful to perform what
goes out from your lips, just as you have voluntarily vowed to the L ord
your God, what you have promised.&quot; These Old-Testament antecedents to the
teaching of the scribes and Pharisees of Jesus' day all point to the fact
that God puts value on telling the truth.

The author of Hebrews reflects back on some of the Old-Testament oaths and
gives us some more insight into this matter. &quot;For when God made the promise
to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,
saying, 'I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you.' And so,
having patiently waited, he obtained the promise. For men swear by one
greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an
end of every dispute. In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the
heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an
oath....&quot; (Hebrews 6:13-17.)
To summarize, because of the human propensity to lie, God allowed oaths in
his name to add weight to a person's word in grave situations, to give a
sense of greater accountability for their word. Even God himself sometimes
made oaths, not because he ever lied, but to accentuate the gravity of the
situation. There are some things that need to transcend the normal human
tendency to deceive or to fudge the truth, and so oath-taking in the name of
the Lord was allowed among the people of Israel. Underneath that was God's
desire for us to be people of integrity, to fulfill our word.

But there was a problem that Jesus addresses in Matthew 5.

Jesus challenges cultural dishonesty

The Old-Testament instructions had been stretched into an elaborate system
of loopholes in the requirement to keep one's word. Notice this little
series of oaths he refers to: by heaven, by earth, by the city of Jerusalem,
even by their own head. A series of gradations of oaths had developed. They
could be more serious with some oaths and less serious with others. They had
taken the Old Testament allowances about swearing by God and his word and
twisted them. For instance, Leviticus 19:12 says not to swear falsely by the
Lord's name, but they took that to mean that they could swear falsely by
something other than the Lord's name. Numbers 30:2 says that if someone
makes an oath to God they must keep it, but they took that to mean that they
could renege on those made to anyone other than God. They could leave
themselves an out.

So people were managing the truth, if you will, coloring their relationships
with one another with varying levels of commitment to fulfill their promises
and vows. The result was a culture of deceit. Peter himself fell victim to
this temptation later in the gospel of Matthew. Having walked with Jesus
throughout his earthly ministry, Peter was fearful as Jesus was taken to
trial. Matthew 26:69-74 tells the story of Peter's denials of Jesus:

&quot;Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to
him and said, 'You too were with Jesus the Galilean.' But he denied it
before them all, saying, 'I do not know what you are talking about.' When he
had gone out to the gateway, another servant-girl saw him and said to those
who were there, 'This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.' And again he denied
it with an oath, 'I do not know the man.' A little later the bystanders came
up and said to Peter, 'Surely you too are one of them; for even the way you
talk gives you away.' Then he began to curse and swear, 'I do not know the
man!'&quot;

The word &quot;swear&quot; here is not the word for profanity; it is a strong word for
oath-taking. Reflecting the spirit of his culture, Peter invoked the regular
habit of swearing by something other than the name of God to try to lend
weight to his words, even in the moment when he knew in his heart that he
was deceiving. And of course, immediately after that, the rooster crowed and
Peter went and wept bitterly, for the prophecy that Jesus had given him came
true. He realized the deceitfulness in his heart and how he had abandoned
his Lord.

So what is Jesus' command in the midst of this elaborate system of deceit?
&quot;I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne
of God, or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by
Jerusalem, for it is the city of

Gosh. all the people I have seen lying about God and Jesus have called
themselves Christians on Usenet and then rant on and on about cultists
and unbelievers.

Perhaps its not really &quot;lying&quot; if they are so deluded that they
actually believe it.

I can really relate to how much Jesus was irritated with people like
you who claim to know everything about God but yet Jesus had
tremendous patience and compassion with unbelievers and cultists and
heretics and prostitutes and tax collectors and (gasp) Samaritans.

When given the choice, I would have to choose Jesus' teachings over
your stuff since the two don't agree.

The bible was never &quot;holy&quot;.

Quoting the Bible is NOT quoting God.

BIBLE - the Fundamentalist Golden Calf which comes in a Trew Kristyun
version that you can supersize with added fries (in Hell).

The Bible ...[is] ... a collection of human responses to God (very human,
some of them all too human), which we are at liberty to use in the process
of formulating our own individual, unique response to God.  We don't do that
by imitating these responses slavishly.  I mean God, if he exists, doesn't
want innumerable clones of the apostle Paul.  He wants us to respond to him,
each of us in our own unique way.  And we can use the Bible to do that, but
we don't do it by obeying it slavishly and blindly. - Peter Cameron
&quot;Heretic&quot; (Doubleday; Sydney: 1994) p. 195

DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF A CHRISTUS OBNOXIUM

... quoting from James Barr's book &quot;Fundamentalism&quot; on the three
distinguishing features of the Fundamentalist:

'Firstly, a fundamentalist has a very strong emphasis on the inerrancy of
the Bible, and believes in the absence from it of any sort of error.

Two, a strong hostility to modern theology and to the method, results and
implications of modern critical study of the Bible.

And three, an assurance that those who do not share their religious
viewpoint are not really true Christians at all.'

Yes, Carl, those who have exchanged posts with you recognize your basic
dishonesty and inability to comprehend Truth when it is presented to you.

Your delusion is so deep that you can not differentiate between what
some doctrine says the Bible says, and what the Word of God actually
does say.

The answers to the following questions give evidence that when taken in
totality, the Bible teaches the doctrine of the Trinity:

1. Who does the Bible say is God?
The Father (Eph. 4:6)?  Yes!
The Son (Titus 2:13; John 1:1,14; 20:28)?  Yes!
The Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3-4)?  Yes!
Or the one and only true God (Deut. 4:35)?  Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit are all Jehovah God.

2. Who raised Jesus from the dead?
The Father (Romans 6:4)?  Yes!
The Son (John 2:19-21; 10:17,18)?  Yes!
The Holy Spirit (Romans 8:11)?  Yes!
Or God (Acts 3:26, 13:30, 17:30,31; 1 Thess. 1:9,10; Heb. 13:20)?  Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God were responsible for raising Jesus from the
dead.

3. Who saves man?
a. Who REGENERATES man?
The Father (1 Peter 1:3)?  Yes!
The Son (John 5:21, 4:14)?  Yes!
The Holy Spirit (John 3:6; Titus 3:5)?  Yes!
Or God (1 John 3:9)?  Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God are responsible for regenerating man.

b. Who JUSTIFIES man?
The Father (Jer. 23:6, cf. 2 Cor. 5:19)?  Yes!
The Son (Romans 5:9, 10:4; 2 Cor. 5:19-21)?  Yes!
The Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:11; Gal. 5:5)?  Yes!
Or God (Romans 4:6, 9:33)?  Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God are responsible for justifying man.

c. Who SANCTIFIES man?
The Father (Jude 1)?  Yes!
The Son (Titus 2:14)?  Yes!
The Holy Spirit (1 Peter 1:2)?  Yes!
Or God (Exodus 31:13)?  Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God are responsible for regenerating man.

d. Who propitiated God's just anger against man for his sins?
The Father (1 John 4:14; John 3:16, 17:5, 18:11)?  Yes!
The Son (Matthew 26:28; John 1:29; 1 John 2:2)?  Yes!
The Holy Spirit (Heb. 9:14)?  Yes!
Or God (2 Cor. 5:1; Acts 20:28)?  Yes!

BIBLICAL CONCLUSION: The Bible says that the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit in the unity as God had propitiated God's just anger against man for
his sins?

BIBLICAL RESULT: The Bible clearly teaches the doctrine of the Trinity.

Though some exalt human reason against the doctrine of the Trinity, saying
that it is &quot;unreasonable,&quot; people who submit their minds to God's Word must
conclude that it is unreasonable NOT to believe in it.

&gt;sorts of deception to try to support their antiBiblical stances. However
&gt;it's really no surprise since the source of all their antiBiblical stances
&gt;is the father of all lies, Satan. God abhors dishonesty and He abhors those
&gt;dishonest tactics used to try to bolster unBiblical teachings. He warned us
&gt;as Christians to watch out for those who teach falsely and to reject utterly
&gt;those false teachings. He told us to study the Holy Scriptures so we would
&gt;be able to discern the counterfeit from the legitimate. And when we rightly
&gt;do, it makes the heretics, false teachers and haters of God angry. I mean
&gt;spitting mad angry. And that's because they can't handle the truth of God.
&gt;Danny Hall's sermon has to do with the topic of honesty, something that is
&gt;impossible for the antiBiblical crowd to exhibit. I urge my Christian
&gt;brethren to read this Biblically-based article.

&lt;snip - who cares what Dan Hall says when you are making false
statements in public&gt;

Carl,

You are unrighteously making unrighteous judgments against others. You
judgments are unrighteous because you are basing what &quot;you&quot; consider
to be righteous on false premises.  Usually, you use the words
&quot;Biblical truth&quot; or &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot;; but this time speak about the
Holy Scriptures which are quite a different things.  According to
Wikipedia:

Sola scriptura (Latin ablative, &quot;by scripture alone&quot;) is the assertion
that the Bible as God's written word is self-authenticating, clear
(perspicuous) to the rational reader, its own interpreter (&quot;Scripture
interprets Scripture&quot;), and sufficient of itself to be the final
authority of Christian doctrine.

Sola scriptura was a foundational doctrinal principle of the
Protestant Reformation held by the reformer Martin Luther and is a
definitive principle of Protestants today (see Five solas)

Sola scriptura may be contrasted with Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox teaching, in which the Bible must be interpreted by church
teaching, by considering the Bible in the context of Sacred Tradition.

The assertion that by scripture alone, etc. above is a false assertion
because the assertion says that the &quot;Bible&quot;; not the Scriptures is the
authority for Christian doctrine.  Scriptures, not versions of the
Bible, should be sola scriptura.

It is those who deceptively use versions of the Bible to prove
doctrines contrary to the Scriptures that are at fault; not those of
us who search the Scriptures to find whether things are true.  You
have shown no evidence that you search the Scriptures to find out
whether things are true.  Your proof of your beliefs are articles
written by other men rather than words spoken by holy men of God.

So, you should read what you wrote and make sure that it does not
apply to you before your strike out at others.  It would eb the
&quot;Christian&quot; thing to do.

NAUGHTY WORDS IN THE BIBLE (KJV)

1 Samuel

David vows to kill &quot;any that pisseth against the wall.&quot; 25:22, 34

1 Kings

God promises to &quot;bring evil upon the house of Jerobaom&quot; and says he will
&quot;cut off&quot; anyone &quot;that pisseth against the wall.&quot;  14:10

Zimri kills everyone &quot;that pisseth against a wall ... according to the word
of the Lord.&quot; 16:11-12

God promises to &quot;bring evil upon thee&quot; and to &quot;cut off&quot; all those &quot;that
pisseth against the wall.&quot; 21:21

2 Kings

God says that the &quot;whole house of Ahab shall perish,&quot; and that he &quot;will cut
off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall.&quot; 9:8

This verse speaks of eating and drinking one's own bodily waste products.
Charming. 18:27

Psalms

The psalmist asks God to &quot; do unto them as unto the Midianites ... which
became as dung for the earth.&quot; 83:9-18

Isaiah

People eating &quot;their own dung&quot; and drinking &quot;their own piss&quot; 36:12

Ezekiel

God tells Ezekiel to eat barley cakes that are made with &quot;the dung that
cometh out of man.&quot; (Yum!) 4:12

God trades &quot;cow's dung for man's dung&quot; and then he tells Ezekiel to make
bread out of the cow's dung. 4:15

Malachi

&quot;Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces.&quot; 2:3

Matthew

Jesus calls his adversaries a &quot;generation of vipers.&quot; 12:34

Jesus calls the Pharisees &quot;hypocrites, wicked, and adulterous.&quot; 15:2-3

Jesus speaks harshly of his disciples when they fail to cast out the devil,
saying &quot;O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?&quot;
17:17

Jesus calls his critics fools, hypocrites, serpents, vipers, kiilers of the
prophets, and just about every other name he can think of. 23:17-37

Luke

Jesus calls his critics fools, thus making himself, by his own standards
(Mt.5:22), worthy of &quot;hell fire.&quot; 11:40

The man (whoever he was) who talked with the two unnamed apostles on the way
to Emmaus calls them &quot;fools,&quot; thereby making himself a candidate for &quot;hell
fire.&quot; (Mt.5:22) 24:25

John

Jesus calls his opponents (the Jews) the sons of the devil. 8:44

Acts

&quot;And when they [the Jews of Corinth] opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he
[Paul] shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own
heads.&quot; (Have a nice day?) 18:6

Paul says, &quot;God will smite thee, thou whited wall.&quot; 23:3

Romans

Paul calls people fools, thus making himself worthy of &quot;hell fire.&quot;
(Mt.5:22) 1:22

1 Corinthians

Paul calls people fools, thereby making himself eligible for &quot;hell fire&quot;
(according to the words of Jesus in Mt.5:22). 15:36

Galatians

Paul calls the Galatians &quot;foolish&quot; and thus makes himself worthy of hell
fire. (Mt.5:22) 3:1

&quot;I would they were even cut off which trouble you.&quot; The New Revised Standard
Version translates this verse as: &quot;I wish those who unsettle you would
castrate themselves!&quot; 5:12

Philippians

&quot;Beware of dogs ... beware of the concision.&quot; I'm not sure who Paul is
calling &quot;dogs&quot; here. Some say he is referring to Jews -- to those of &quot;the
concision&quot;, as opposed to Christians, who are of the &quot;true circumcision&quot;. In
any case, Paul is expressing hostility and intolerance toward his fellow
human beings. 3:2

Titus

According to Paul, the people of Crete are &quot;always liars, evil beasts, slow
bellies.&quot; 1:12

To Paul, Jews are unruly liars &quot;whose mouths must be stopped.&quot; 1:10-11

Philemon

Paul says that &quot;the bowels of the saints are refreshed by &quot;Philemon.&quot; 1:7

Paul asks Philemon to receive Onesimus just as though he were Paul's very
&quot;own bowels.&quot; 1:12

Paul pleads with Philemon to &quot;refresh [his] bowels in the Lord.&quot; Amen 1:20

James

James calls his readers a bunch of &quot;adulterers and adulteresses.&quot; 4:4

One liar in particular I've noticed in here is John Weatherly.
He lied concerning Jesus.... he insisted Jesus baptized with water.
He insisted 'Jesus cursed people out' when He got angry... and of
course, look at the 'drunkard' nonsense where he claimed &quot;Jesus
SLOSHED&quot;.....

He misconstrues Scripture, and fraudulently represents himself as 'an
ordained Pastor' as well as a 'psychologist'.

He tried to represent himself as 'The Holy Spirit' also, which he
denied, but again I proved by providing his post.

He advocates violence, adultery, gutter mouth, and lives to post idle
threats.

Still care to call him a 'Christian'???

Be VERY CAREFUL, Carl, that you don't allow yourself to be misled by
that charlatan.

&gt;TO TELL THE TRUTH
&gt;by Danny Hall

&gt;As I have been studying the Sermon on the Mount, I have been amazed at how
&gt;absolutely applicable it is to our contemporary society. It is as if Jesus
&gt;were looking down the corridor of time right to where we live when he was
&gt;speaking about these things. As the saying goes, the more things change, the
&gt;more they stay the same. Cultures and circumstances may change, but the
&gt;sinfulness of the human heart has never changed.

&gt;All kinds of things point to the fact that dishonesty is rampant in our
&gt;society. Here are a few examples:

&gt;Last week four men connected with BALCO Laboratories here in the Bay Area
&gt;were indicted for designing and distributing performance-enhancing steroids
&gt;to athletes. The most famous of their alleged clients was Barry Bonds,
&gt;although nothing has been proven about him personally. Performance-enhancing
&gt;drugs are intended for one thing: to enable athletes to cheat, to give them
&gt;an edge over their competitors. There is much money to be made both by those
&gt;selling the steroids and by the athletes who use them, as their statistics
&gt;go up and their value increases.

&gt;We are in the middle of the Martha Stewart trial, which is again about
&gt;cheating the system.

&gt;Recently there was a huge scandal at Saratoga High School about some
&gt;students' breaking in using some high-tech gizmos to steal answers to tests.

&gt;As we approach tax season it is a standard joke that people are not always
&gt;exactly honest on their income tax returns.

&gt;This is an election year, so we will be bombarded by promises and
&gt;accusations, a lot of truths and half-truths and no truth at all, all mixed
&gt;together in a frenzy of campaigning by candidates to get elected.

&gt;Besides all these big examples, there is the proverbial little white lie
&gt;that all of us every now and then reserve the right to use. Many times
&gt;across my career as a pastor, the question has come up, particularly with
&gt;other pastors, &quot;How many people attend your church?&quot; We pastors use
&gt;&quot;ministerial math&quot; and evangelistic crusade estimates to answer that
&gt;question. Somehow we are driven to present our church as being a little
&gt;better than the other guy's. And sometimes you are trapped; you don't even
&gt;know how to avoid the little white lie. Any of us who are husbands know what
&gt;it is like to have to answer the question, &quot;Does this make me look fat?&quot;

&gt;Part of our problem is that we have grown very comfortable with the shading
&gt;of the truth. We assume that everyone has an agenda through which they
&gt;filter truth. We call it spinning the truth in order to make it suit their
&gt;purposes, and that is somehow supposed to make it acceptable. We live in a
&gt;culture that really is characterized by dishonesty.

&gt;But this is nothing new. We're going to look at a passage that focuses on
&gt;similar issues that Jesus confronted in his day. Matthew 5:33-37:

&gt;Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, &quot;You shall not make false
&gt;vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.&quot; But I say to you, make no
&gt;oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth,
&gt;for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of
&gt;the great King. Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make
&gt;one hair white or black. But let your statement be, &quot;Yes, yes&quot; or &quot;No, no&quot;;
&gt;anything beyond these is of evil.

&gt;God values honesty

&gt;In order to understand what Jesus is talking about, we need to look at the
&gt;Old-Testament antecedents. The term &quot;false vows&quot; means perjury, deliberately
&gt;lying when others expect you to fulfill an oath. The term &quot;fulfill your
&gt;vows&quot; literally means to fence or box yourself in, to put a boundary around
&gt;yourself. So when you make an oath, you fence yourself in to tell the truth.

&gt;Oath-making has a lot of background in the Old-Testament Law. Leviticus
&gt;19:12 says, &quot;You shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the
&gt;name of your God; I am the Lord .&quot; Numbers 30:2 says, &quot;If a man makes a vow
&gt;to the Lord , or takes an oath to bind himself with a binding obligation, he
&gt;shall not violate his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out
&gt;of his mouth.&quot; Deuteronomy 23:21-23 says, &quot;When you make a vow to the L ord
&gt;your God, you shall not delay to pay it, for it would be sin in you, and the
&gt;L ord your God will surely require it of you. However, if you refrain from
&gt;vowing, it would not be sin in you. You shall be careful to perform what
&gt;goes out from your lips, just as you have voluntarily vowed to the L ord
&gt;your God, what you have promised.&quot; These Old-Testament antecedents to the
&gt;teaching of the scribes and Pharisees of Jesus' day all point to the fact
&gt;that God puts value on telling the truth.

&gt;The author of Hebrews reflects back on some of the Old-Testament oaths and
&gt;gives us some more insight into this matter. &quot;For when God made the promise
&gt;to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,
&gt;saying, 'I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you.' And so,
&gt;having patiently waited, he obtained the promise. For men swear by one
&gt;greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an
&gt;end of every dispute. In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the
&gt;heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an
&gt;oath....&quot; (Hebrews 6:13-17.)
&gt;To summarize, because of the human propensity to lie, God allowed oaths in
&gt;his name to add weight to a person's word in grave situations, to give a
&gt;sense of greater accountability for their word. Even God himself sometimes
&gt;made oaths, not because he ever lied, but to accentuate the gravity of the
&gt;situation. There are some things that need to transcend the normal human
&gt;tendency to deceive or to fudge the truth, and so oath-taking in the name of
&gt;the Lord was allowed among the people of Israel. Underneath that was God's
&gt;desire for us to be people of integrity, to fulfill our word.

&gt;But there was a problem that Jesus addresses in Matthew 5.

&gt;Jesus challenges cultural dishonesty

&gt;The Old-Testament instructions had been stretched into an elaborate system
&gt;of loopholes in the requirement to keep one's word. Notice this little
&gt;series of oaths he refers to: by heaven, by earth, by the city of Jerusalem,
&gt;even by their own head. A series of gradations of oaths had developed. They
&gt;could be more serious with some oaths and less serious with others. They had
&gt;taken the Old Testament allowances about swearing by God and his word and
&gt;twisted them. For instance, Leviticus 19:12 says not to swear falsely by the
&gt;Lord's name, but they took that to mean that they could swear falsely by
&gt;something other than the Lord's name. Numbers 30:2 says that if someone
&gt;makes an oath to God they must keep it, but they took that to mean that they
&gt;could renege on those made to anyone other than God. They could leave
&gt;themselves an out.

&gt;So people were managing the truth, if you will, coloring their relationships
&gt;with one another with varying levels of commitment to fulfill their promises
&gt;and vows. The result was a culture of deceit. Peter himself fell victim to
&gt;this temptation later in the gospel of Matthew. Having walked with Jesus
&gt;throughout his earthly ministry, Peter was fearful as Jesus was taken to
&gt;trial. Matthew 26:69-74 tells the story of Peter's denials of Jesus:

&gt;&quot;Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to
&gt;him and said, 'You too were with Jesus the Galilean.' But he denied it
&gt;before them all, saying, 'I do not know what you are talking about.' When he
&gt;had gone out to the gateway, another servant-girl saw him and said to those
&gt;who were there, 'This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.' And again he denied
&gt;it with an oath, 'I do not know the man.' A little later the bystanders came
&gt;up and said to

If we just put into practice what Christ preached, most of us
might be better off. Not everyone agrees with everything Christ
said, but they don't disagree with all he said either.

Amo 5:14  Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD,
the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

Amo 5:15  Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in
the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the
remnant of Joseph.

Amo 5:16  Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus;
Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways,
Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as
are skilful of lamentation to wailing.

Amo 5:17  And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through
thee, saith the LORD.

Amo 5:18  Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is
it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.

Amo 5:19  As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went
into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.

Amo 5:20  Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even
very dark, and no brightness in it?

Amo 5:21  I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in
your solemn assemblies.

Amo 5:22  Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I
will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your
fat beasts.

Amo 5:23  Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
hear the melody of thy viols.

Amo 5:24  But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
mighty stream.

Amo 5:25  Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

Amo 5:26  But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your
images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

Amo 5:27  Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond
Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.

&gt;&gt;1 Kings

&gt;&gt;God promises to &quot;bring evil upon the house of Jerobaom&quot; and says he will

&gt;&gt;Zimri kills everyone &quot;that pisseth against a wall ... according to the
&gt;&gt;word
&gt;&gt;of the Lord.&quot; 16:11-12

&gt;&gt;God promises to &quot;bring evil upon thee&quot; and to &quot;cut off&quot; all those &quot;that

&gt;&gt;2 Kings

&gt;&gt;God says that the &quot;whole house of Ahab shall perish,&quot; and that he &quot;will
&gt;&gt;cut
&gt;&gt;off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall.&quot; 9:8

&gt;&gt;This verse speaks of eating and drinking one's own bodily waste products.
&gt;&gt;Charming. 18:27

&gt;&gt;Psalms

&gt;&gt;The psalmist asks God to &quot; do unto them as unto the Midianites ... which
&gt;&gt;became as dung for the earth.&quot; 83:9-18

&gt;&gt;Isaiah

&gt;&gt;People eating &quot;their own dung&quot; and drinking &quot;their own piss&quot; 36:12

&gt;&gt;Ezekiel

&gt;&gt;God tells Ezekiel to eat barley cakes that are made with &quot;the dung that
&gt;&gt;cometh out of man.&quot; (Yum!) 4:12

&gt;&gt;God trades &quot;cow's dung for man's dung&quot; and then he tells Ezekiel to make
&gt;&gt;bread out of the cow's dung. 4:15

&gt;&gt;Malachi

&gt;&gt;&quot;Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces.&quot; 2:3

&gt;&gt;Matthew

&gt;&gt;Jesus calls his adversaries a &quot;generation of vipers.&quot; 12:34

&gt;&gt;Jesus calls the Pharisees &quot;hypocrites, wicked, and adulterous.&quot; 15:2-3

&gt;&gt;Jesus speaks harshly of his disciples when they fail to cast out the
&gt;&gt;devil,
&gt;&gt;saying &quot;O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with
&gt;&gt;you?&quot;
&gt;&gt;17:17

&gt;&gt;Jesus calls his critics fools, hypocrites, serpents, vipers, kiilers of
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;prophets, and just about every other name he can think of. 23:17-37

&gt;&gt;Luke

&gt;&gt;Jesus calls his critics fools, thus making himself, by his own standards
&gt;&gt;(Mt.5:22), worthy of &quot;hell fire.&quot; 11:40

&gt;&gt;The man (whoever he was) who talked with the two unnamed apostles on the
&gt;&gt;way
&gt;&gt;to Emmaus calls them &quot;fools,&quot; thereby making himself a candidate for &quot;hell
&gt;&gt;fire.&quot; (Mt.5:22) 24:25

&gt;&gt;John

&gt;&gt;Jesus calls his opponents (the Jews) the sons of the devil. 8:44

&gt;&gt;Acts

&gt;&gt;&quot;And when they [the Jews of Corinth] opposed themselves, and blasphemed,
&gt;&gt;he
&gt;&gt;[Paul] shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own
&gt;&gt;heads.&quot; (Have a nice day?) 18:6

&gt;&gt;Paul says, &quot;God will smite thee, thou whited wall.&quot; 23:3

&gt;&gt;Romans

&gt;&gt;Paul calls people fools, thus making himself worthy of &quot;hell fire.&quot;
&gt;&gt;(Mt.5:22) 1:22

&gt;&gt;1 Corinthians

&gt;&gt;Paul calls people fools, thereby making himself eligible for &quot;hell fire&quot;
&gt;&gt;(according to the words of Jesus in Mt.5:22). 15:36

&gt;&gt;Galatians

&gt;&gt;Paul calls the Galatians &quot;foolish&quot; and thus makes himself worthy of hell
&gt;&gt;fire. (Mt.5:22) 3:1

&gt;&gt;&quot;I would they were even cut off which trouble you.&quot; The New Revised
&gt;&gt;Standard
&gt;&gt;Version translates this verse as: &quot;I wish those who unsettle you would
&gt;&gt;castrate themselves!&quot; 5:12

&gt;&gt;Philippians

&gt;&gt;&quot;Beware of dogs ... beware of the concision.&quot; I'm not sure who Paul is
&gt;&gt;calling &quot;dogs&quot; here. Some say he is referring to Jews -- to those of &quot;the
&gt;&gt;concision&quot;, as opposed to Christians, who are of the &quot;true circumcision&quot;.
&gt;&gt;In
&gt;&gt;any case, Paul is expressing hostility and intolerance toward his fellow
&gt;&gt;human beings. 3:2

&gt;&gt;Titus

&gt;&gt;According to Paul, the people of Crete are &quot;always liars, evil beasts,
&gt;&gt;slow
&gt;&gt;bellies.&quot; 1:12

&gt;&gt;To Paul, Jews are unruly liars &quot;whose mouths must be stopped.&quot; 1:10-11

&gt;&gt;Philemon

&gt;&gt;Paul says that &quot;the bowels of the saints are refreshed by &quot;Philemon.&quot; 1:7

&gt;&gt;Paul asks Philemon to receive Onesimus just as though he were Paul's very
&gt;&gt;&quot;own bowels.&quot; 1:12

&gt;&gt;Paul pleads with Philemon to &quot;refresh [his] bowels in the Lord.&quot; Amen 1:20

&gt;&gt;James

&gt;&gt;James calls his readers a bunch of &quot;adulterers and adulteresses.&quot; 4:4

&gt;&gt;3 John

&gt;&gt;John says he &quot;will remember his [Diotrephes] deeds ... pratting against us
&gt;&gt;with malicious words.&quot; 1:10

Nice try &quot;Liar Rod&quot;, let's get down to the real issue here....YOUR

Tell me, &quot;Rod&quot;, which story about your tween years is true. I mean,
WHICH story is a lie, &quot;Rod&quot;?

Were you homeless until 19, or did you work, or did you hang out in
bars?

It's very easy to catch you in lies because you crave attention so
much you'll say anything to try and get some.

But hey, you'll be able to have lying contests where YOU'RE
going....HELL IS FULL OF LIARS, little swine.

It's from the old testament, so take a good hard look at it
religionist, because it states Gods feelings on the matter.

Scripture was written to draw people like me that know the difference
between religion and truth. The fact that you are unable to doesn't
lesson the effect of my words, religionist. And by the way, I haven't
ridiculed the bible, I spoke the truth about what I believe concerning
it, but you're simply unwilling to admit it. Now I suggest AMOS 5
entirely, perhaps it will help you to get things in perspective.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell me, &quot;Rod&quot;, which story about your tween years is true. I mean,
&gt;&gt;&gt; WHICH story is a lie, &quot;Rod&quot;?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Were you homeless until 19, or did you work, or did you hang out in
&gt;&gt;&gt; bars?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's very easy to catch you in lies because you crave attention so
&gt;&gt;&gt; much you'll say anything to try and get some.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But hey, you'll be able to have lying contests where YOU'RE
&gt;&gt;&gt; going....HELL IS FULL OF LIARS, little swine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Have a BLESSED Day,

&gt;&gt;   You're masquerading as a man of God. Provide the name of the
&gt;&gt; organization issuing your credentials, the state they are issued

&gt;  You keep demanding credentials!  Produce YOURS, or shut up!

Produce or SHUT UP!

&gt;Pastor?
&gt;  Another word for &quot;pastor&quot; is &quot;elder.&quot; Chronologically, I am an elder
&gt;as I approach my 60th year, and I've been a Christian now for some 55
&gt;YEARS. By just about any accounting, I am an elder.

&gt; I was briefly an ordained associate pastor, so I have actually been
&gt;an ordained pastor.  I was also an ordained Sunday School teacher for
&gt;several years at a church that requires one to be appointed by the
&gt;other elders and then elected (&quot;approved&quot;) by the congregation.

&gt; So I have pastored at TWO churches.

&gt;and the Lord only
&gt;&gt;knows what else!

&gt;evangelist, teacher, preacher...

&gt; I think that's a good place to leave it.

Yes -- let's LEAVE IT. We know you are NOT an ordained Pastor, John-

I've got a little plan for you, fagboi, after I find you. I'm
planning a little rawhide party for your pedophile butt, then
afterwards I have some aquaintances that need some new meat
for an all gay brothel in Panama, and you'll make a fine
addition to there selection of male whores. That will be a

Now THAT would be a mistake of monumental proportion on your part,
&quot;Reprobate Rod&quot;. You aren't quite man enough to do that, little swine.

But hey, it's nice to be physically threatened by a cowardly piece of
slime like yourself, &quot;Reprobat Rod&quot;.

The truth hurts, doesn't it &quot;Reprobate Rod&quot;.

Just to review, &quot;Rod&quot; is a cowardly liar that can't keep his lies
straight. I will say that you are a &quot;chip of the ole block&quot;. Winter
taught you well.

Now this is what I call CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&quot;Rod&quot;, you are the nuttiest swine I've met out here. Compared to you,
Puster Winter is normal.

Did your disposition come from years on skid row, or from your buddies
at Emporia High class of 68? You haven't answered the lesbians
question, &quot;Rod&quot;. WHICH STORY WAS A LIE????????????

Come on, tell us,  you liar.

Just for the record, &quot;Rod&quot; has now posted a second threat of physical
violence to me.

I wonder what your classmates at Emporia High would say about you,
&quot;Rod&quot;?
