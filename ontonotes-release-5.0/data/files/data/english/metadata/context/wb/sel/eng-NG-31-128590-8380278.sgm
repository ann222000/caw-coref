At a late hour on Saturday night last the Manchester mail was proceeding at its
usual rate towards Carlisle, and had left Lancaster about four miles, when the
coachman perceived a cart approaching, the driver of which was lying in the
cart, covered up, and asleep. The coachman called out to him, but being
stupefied at just rising from sleep, and perceiving his perilous condition, he
pulled one of the reins, which unfortunately happened to be the wrong one, and
the consequence was that it came in front of the mail, and before the coachman
had time to pull up his horses, the cart came in contact with the splinter-bar,
and carried it away with a portion of the front of the coach. BRYDONE, the
coachman, was sitting with the reins in his hand, and before he had time to
throw them down, he was dragged off the box by the horses, which had become
alarmed by the concussion, and galloped off with the reins. The coachman was
dragged to the ground, and received several severe bruises, but fortunately no
bones were broken. BRYDONE is considered a very excellent coachman, and not the
slightest blame attaches to him. The horses were stopped at a short distance,
and the guard went back to Lancaster for another coach, which occasioned some
delay. None of the passengers received any injury. - Carlisle Patriot.
