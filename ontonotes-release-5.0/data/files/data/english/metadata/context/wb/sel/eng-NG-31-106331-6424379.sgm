Hello.

My name is Chris Jenkins. And you may not know it, but I am the living,
breathing, son of God. You see, God sent his "spirit" down to impregnate my
mother, and I was born.

Because of this, I represent your only path to heaven after you die. This
means that you should listen to and believe everything I have to say. If you
do not, you will be doomed to burn endlessly in a pit of fire, while all
those who did beleive in me will be celebrating at an endless party, where
we do such fun things as sing songs of devotion to me, and fall down on your
knees and worship me, for an eternity. Once again, this is a very good
reason to listen to all I tell you to do.

I am the only way for you to avoid eternal suffering. Everyone else is lying
or misguided. Do you know how long eternity is? That's a lot of suffering.
Oh no, I'm not threatening you. I care about your safety and your eternal
well being. I would hate for that to happen to you, but, you know, if you
don't listen to me, and do what I tell you do, then that's where you're
headed. Remember, everyone who tells you anything different is lying, or
misguided. They are possibly also under the influence of "the devil", which
is what I like to call my wayward little bother. He got mouthy with God, my
father, and got disowned, so now he's trying to do his own thing. He's bad,
so don't listen to him.

What? This sounds a little far fetched, and you want to know why you should
believe me? Why, because I said so, and I am the son of God, you know. I
wouldn't steer you wrong.

Here's my guidebook. It's called "The Idiot's Guide to Eternal Salvation".
It is the direct word of God. How do you know that is true? Why, it says it,
right in the book. It also says that I am the son of God, as though you
needed any additional proof.

Perfect. Now that we have all of that squared away, will you go ahead and
put all your money in this plate? Thanks, appreciate that. God won't forget
it.

Chris Jenkins,
You mimic Christianity.  I belive, however, that no matter how cruel you
may get to Christianity and its followers, God Jehovah will forgive you.
And, if you ask him into your heart, he will allow you to go to heaven.  I
forgive you, and believe me, I am not the most forgiving person you will
find. God is more forgiving, so I know for a fact he forgives you.
How, if you are an evolutionist, how can you answer the following
statements:
1. All snowflakes have their own design.
2. All humans have their own special DNA.  Not even twins are alike.
3. Great Whites (among other sharks) have their colors for a reason.
I'll ask you more if you can answer these. Make your response fairly
through, maybe five sentences an answer. If you cant' answer one, I'll be
able to give you an answer about the same length or longer. Then you'll know
my religion is the true religion.

May you see the glory of God,

Erwin

I'll answer all three of your questions, and I'll try to use five sentences,
although on at least one, the answer is much simpler:

1. No, they don't. Snowflakes are not unique, and there have likely been
countless duplicates since the dawn of the planet. However, the odds of you
catching two identical ones are pretty slim. One scientist, however, did
just that:

http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1784760.htm

2. Of course DNA is unique. This is WHY evolution occurs. It's very simple:
Daddy (ABCDEF) copulates with Mommy (GHIJKL), and has a boy child (ABCJKL)
and a girl child (DEFGHI). When any two organisms procreate, the genetic
material that they are made from mixes, and forms a new strand, which
contains bits and pieces of the original strands. Since every blend is new,
it progresses that every blend is identical. If you think this is some sort
of miracle, then you simply don't understand what pea farmers in the 1700's
figured out. Time for a remedial science class.

3. Yes, and that reason is Natural Selection. When mutations occur in
genetic propagation, (the effect of entropy, an unstoppable universal force,
similar to your concept of God, except measurable), the results of that
mutation either make an organism more likely to survive, or less likely to
survive. If the mutation made the animal more likely to survive, than it is
also more likely to procreate, thus passing on that genetic mutation to its
offspring. If the mutation makes that animal less likely to survive, it is
most likely going to die off before it has had a chance to procreate, and
thus end that genetic strain along with it. This is why we do see sharks
appropriately camouflaged from above and below, but don't see many three
legged cross eyed horses. Get it?

Now, I've got one for you. Show me one single piece of archaeological or
paleontological evidence that the earth, and all of its flora and fauna,
came into being over the course of six days roughly 6,000 years ago. And
please, be thorough. Use at least five sentences, and stick to real
evidence, and not the over-translated watered down scripture and verse you
fundies typically throw out as though it proves something.

Sorry, let me correct in number two: "since every blend is new, every blend
is unique."...and not identical.

Erwin,
I AM a Christian, and one doesn't have to DO anything to gain forgiveness. He is accepted just as he is.  To say otherwise is to deny grace.
(Erwin)
And, if you ask him into your heart, he will allow you to go to heaven.  I forgive you, and believe me, I am not the most forgiving person you will find. God is more forgiving, so I know for a fact he forgives you.

See? You know it, too.  You just said that God forgives Chris.....WITHOUT CHRIS ASKING FOR IT.  You contradicted yourself.

(Erwin)
How, if you are an evolutionist, how can you answer the following statements:
1. All snowflakes have their own design.

(Pottsie)
Because "Individuality" means "uniqueness".....and "uniqueness" means "one-of-a-kind"

(Erwin)
2. All humans have their own special DNA.  Not even twins are alike.

(Pottsie)
For the same reason stated above.

(Erwin)
3. Great Whites (among other sharks) have their colors for a reason.

(Pottsie)
There is a "reason" for everything.  But I may or may not be able to "prove" what that "reason" is.

(Erwin)
&lt;snip&gt;
Then you'll know my religion is the true religion.

May you see the glory of God,

Erwin

(Pottsie)
The correct answers to these questions are beyond religion.  An Atheist, Agnostic, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, or Christian can answer them.  It doesn't prove anything about Christianity....much less that it is the "True" religion.  THAT is a joke!

Namaste

Hey All,

I find religion rather fascinating but only as a study, not to
practice. That is just my own view. The thing that I find to be most
unsettling about most religions is the; believe in me or you will
perish in eternal damnation fun. I love to study religion and would
love to sit down with people from each and every religion, sect, and
sub-sect and get their clear picture, but it always turns from an
explanation to preaching. One of the best countries so far, in the
world, for religious study, that I have found, is China. I have been
able to sit down with Buddhists, Taoists, and Muslims here in China
and have true discussions where it never once traced into preaching. I
found Buddhists to also be the most accepting of others. I have no
problem with people who are faithful, but it is their faith, not mine,
and I do not push my "atheism", for lack of a better word, on them.
Every Buddhist I have spoken with in China has finished every
conversation with gratitude for having sat and discussed with them,
not indignation as I have found most Christians do. It is a sad world,
in my opinion, when religion crushes inquisitive nature.

Holy Book just like any other book. He/she/it interprets it according

Chris,
Are you sure that Christo means light?  I'm pretty sure it means "the
anointed one."  And actually Lucifer means "light bearer."  And
Christopher is "bearer of the Anointed one."

&gt; &gt; knees and worship me, for an eternity. Once again, this is a very good
&gt; &gt; reason to listen to all I tell you to do.

&gt; &gt; I am the only way for you to avoid eternal suffering. Everyone else is lying
&gt; &gt; or misguided. Do you know how long eternity is? That's a lot of suffering.
&gt; &gt; Oh no, I'm not threatening you. I care about your safety and your eternal
&gt; &gt; well being. I would hate for that to happen to you, but, you know, if you
&gt; &gt; don't listen to me, and do what I tell you do, then that's where you're
&gt; &gt; headed. Remember, everyone who tells you anything different is lying, or
&gt; &gt; misguided. They are possibly also under the influence of &quot;the devil&quot;, which
&gt; &gt; is what I like to call my wayward little bother. He got mouthy with God, my
&gt; &gt; father, and got disowned, so now he's trying to do his own thing. He's bad,
&gt; &gt; so don't listen to him.

&gt; &gt; What? This sounds a little far fetched, and you want to know why you should
&gt; &gt; believe me? Why, because I said so, and I am the son of God, you know. I
&gt; &gt; wouldn't steer you wrong.

&gt; &gt; Here's my guidebook. It's called &quot;The Idiot's Guide to Eternal Salvation&quot;.
&gt; &gt; It is the direct word of God. How do you know that is true? Why, it says it,
&gt; &gt; right in the book. It also says that I am the son of God, as though you
&gt; &gt; needed any additional proof.

&gt; &gt; Perfect. Now that we have all of that squared away, will you go ahead and
&gt; &gt; put all your money in this plate? Thanks, appreciate that. God won't forget
&gt; &gt; it.

Ahh Brandon, then feel free to ignore the nutters that seem to have
mistaken this forum for some sort of converstion shop, and talk to me
about Sikhi I wont try to convert you, or Pottsie about his brand of
Christianity(which I must say I can get on with far better than the
normal brand).

&gt; Hey All,

&gt; I find religion rather fascinating but only as a study, not to
&gt; practice. That is just my own view. The thing that I find to be most
&gt; unsettling about most religions is the; believe in me or you will
&gt; perish in eternal damnation fun. I love to study religion and would
&gt; love to sit down with people from each and every religion, sect, and
&gt; sub-sect and get their clear picture, but it always turns from an
&gt; explanation to preaching. One of the best countries so far, in the
&gt; world, for religious study, that I have found, is China. I have been
&gt; able to sit down with Buddhists, Taoists, and Muslims here in China
&gt; and have true discussions where it never once traced into preaching. I
&gt; found Buddhists to also be the most accepting of others. I have no
&gt; problem with people who are faithful, but it is their faith, not mine,
&gt; and I do not push my &quot;atheism&quot;, for lack of a better word, on them.
&gt; Every Buddhist I have spoken with in China has finished every
&gt; conversation with gratitude for having sat and discussed with them,
&gt; not indignation as I have found most Christians do. It is a sad world,
&gt; in my opinion, when religion crushes inquisitive nature.

Peter clearly believes in a responsibility to preach the word.

He appears to do so with an admirable openness and sincerity.

Some may consider it presumptuous and forward. That does not strike me
as good enough reason to vilify the person. So why do we do?

Beacause this is a forum for rational discussion. Proselytization is not
rational discussion, rather, the opposite thereof. He is not villified for
his beliefs, but rather the inappropriateness of his statements to this
forum.

Should he care to provide rational explanation for his beliefs, or open
debate to specific issues which debatable, than he is welcome to do so.

"Is there a God?" - Interesting and acceptable topic
"My God is the right path to heaven, and you are going to burn in
everlasting hell unless you submit to the rituals of my religion." - Not so
much, and prompts villification.

Yes, i think i get it; thanks Chris.

Peter, less "proselytizing" and more "rational discussion" appears to
be the moderators advice.

Perhaps the rest of us might exercise a little emotional restraint; we
could all do with a constructive focus on the interesting questions
and issues raised in this forum.

you know Christ wants everyone on Earth to go to heaven thats why he

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; See? You know it, too.  You just said that God forgives Chris.....WITHOUT

&gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; There is a &quot;reason&quot; for everything.  But I may or may not be able to

&gt; &gt; The correct answers to these questions are beyond religion.  An Atheist,

&gt; &gt; &gt; I AM a Christian, and one doesn't have to DO anything to gain
&gt; forgiveness.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He is accepted just as he is.  To say otherwise is to deny grace.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Erwin)
&gt; &gt; &gt; And, if you ask him into your heart, he will allow you to go to
&gt; heaven.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; forgive you, and believe me, I am not the most forgiving person you
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; &gt; find. God is more forgiving, so I know for a fact he forgives you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; See? You know it, too.  You just said that God forgives
&gt; Chris.....WITHOUT
&gt; &gt; &gt; CHRIS ASKING FOR IT.  You contradicted yourself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Erwin)
&gt; &gt; &gt;      How, if you are an evolutionist, how can you answer the following
&gt; &gt; &gt; statements:
&gt; &gt; &gt;    1. All snowflakes have their own design.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Because &quot;Individuality&quot; means &quot;uniqueness&quot;.....and &quot;uniqueness&quot; means
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Erwin)
&gt; &gt; &gt;    2. All humans have their own special DNA.  Not even twins are
&gt; alike.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; For the same reason stated above.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Erwin)
&gt; &gt; &gt;    3. Great Whites (among other sharks) have their colors for a
&gt; reason.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a &quot;reason&quot; for everything.  But I may or may not be able to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;prove&quot; what that &quot;reason&quot; is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Erwin)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Then you'll know my religion is the true religion.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  May you see the glory of God,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Erwin

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Pottsie)
&gt; &gt; &gt; The correct answers to these questions are beyond religion.  An
&gt; Atheist,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Agnostic, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, or Christian can answer them.  It
&gt; doesn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; prove anything about Christianity....much less that it is the &quot;True&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; religion.  THAT is a joke!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste

&gt; &gt; &gt; Chesterton

&gt; &gt;     You say that you are a Christian, but have you really asked
&gt; forgiveness
&gt; &gt; from Jesus Christ? No, probably not.  That means that you aren't a
&gt; &gt; Christian, for you still need to ask forgiveness from your Creator.

Hey Doggie,

Welcome to you.

Don't take my words here literaly, I was makeing a small joke and
referanceing Lord of the rings into the bargin.

It is true I have a deep unlikeing for Christianity, but hate?  Heh
naaa that's too strong a word for me to use  mean it.

Still until we get debate on this subject instead of getting told the
'truth' then I shall continue to treat it as I see it, a joke.
