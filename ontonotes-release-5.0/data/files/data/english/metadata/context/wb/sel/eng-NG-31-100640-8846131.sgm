I've lurked here, off and on, for quite a while.  It seems that,
occasionally, the topic actually gets around to 8-track tapes.

I have a collection of about 450 cartridges.  I would like to sell them,
preferrably as a whole.

They have been sitting in boxes and have not been played for at least 20
years.

There are classic rock, R&amp;B, disco, soul cartridges in various states of
condition.

If anyone is interested, let me know.

Thanks,

Leggette

If you haven't already, you will soon recieve an email from Charlie
Nudo telling you they're not worth much, he will offer you some low
amount for them. If he gets them he will turn around and sell them for
much more than he gave you.

Your best bet is to go to 8 Track Heaven and talk with the folks
there. They originally started this group but left to get away from
Charlie Nudo.

What he said.  Due to Nudo destroying this newsgroup, you'll probably
only get his reply, and it'll be a &quot;low ball.&quot;  8TH has some active
collectors and fans, and will probably give you more, not to mention
they tend to be more honest folk that you're going to attract in here.

Hint:  You can get more if you list/sell them individually, or at
least in label- or genre-separated packages.  They'll probably all
need pads and the usual maintenance, so 50¢ to a buck is about the
going rate, except for sought after titles, more if they're in good
shape with good labels.

Sounds like a pretty diverse collection, just judging by the size.
Good luck!

Steely Dan, etc.

over America- it is so CRISP !  And every single tape had an RCA Music
Service, Columbia House, or other original slip cover on it !

&gt; Miller Band, Steve - Sailor  OS
">

One of my all time favourite albums ever. I still have the 8 track
and lp from the time. They were more commonly known as The Steve Miller
Blues Band at the time. Things went downhill after this for my tastes.
However, his popularity with the general public hit big when he began
putting out more pop sounding stuff. Mention Steve Miller and few are
familiar with Sailor but will cite &quot;Abracadabra&quot; and &quot;Fly Like An Eagle&quot;.
Catchy tunes, but no &quot;Gangster of Love&quot;. I especially enjoy the opening
riffs of that one.
Boz Scaggs was in the band at that time. He put out a great self
titled album recorded at Muscle Shoals after leaving SMBB that I also rather
like. Sadly he lost his way shortly after and went sort of disco-ish. Again
few are familiar with that first LP but know his later stuff. He is still
touring and does seem to have returned to some R&amp;B and blues sensibilities
but I am sure he is expected to do the hits like folks remember them. Duane
Allman did a lot of slide work on that freshman pressing. Horn section?
Muscle Shoals, you'd best believe it.
There was another guy in Steve Millers band (Tim Davis??) that
charted with a hit and disappeared. As I recall it was a bit of a novelty
tune.

WAY downhill.  Miller in those days was a pedestrian talent of
mediocre intellect at best, and the early stuff's about as good as he
ever got, despite all that help from none other than Les Paul in his
youth.  His big &quot;hits&quot; were, as Grace Slick once coined, &quot;moron
music&quot;...big hits because they appealed to the least common
denominator of public taste.  &quot;Abra abra cadabra, I'm gonna reach out
'n grab ya&quot; and &quot;Big ol' jet airlinah&quot; indeed!

Scaggs was out to hit the charts and make some cash, which &quot;Silk
Degrees&quot; certainly did, and with a crossover appeal into various
charts.  It was an RIAA platinum awardee, IIRC, actually eclipsing
Miller in single album sales.  His second and subsequent albums
weren't well received.

Tim Davis broke into the monthly Hot 100 on his own in 1972 with
&quot;Buzzy Brown,&quot; indeed a novelty tune that was poorly promoted, and it
sank off the Hot 100 within 2 weeks, although it got a lot of local
airplay on Midwestern AM outlets throughout that summer.  The single
placed in the 500s in the yearly Billboard tally, and he was never
heard from again, although he showed up as a sideman here and there.

Not that Noodles actually HAS this album, or the whole collection, of
course...the supposed acquisition is probably yet another figment of
his mercury poisoned brain.

Going from memory. This was prior to Silk Degrees. Just titled Boz
Scaggs with a picture of him in b&amp;w leaning against a building. His next
album was already different and had him and about a hundred musicians on the
jacket. Still looked down to earth though. After that it was pastel silk
suits and hopeless tunes. But as I think I mentioned most folks never saw
those first two albums. I would not be surprised if a Google search just
omitted them. Poof....gone.
