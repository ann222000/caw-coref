I adopted a white and black shorthaired female kitten, about 4 months old,
from the local SPCA. I have had her about 3 months now (she is now 7 months
old) and she still will not come to me or have anything to do with me. She
will walk around the room while I am in it, but if I call her, she looks at
me and runs. My schipperke (a small dog) and she seem to get along fine. I
don't know any of her history before I got her from the SPCA, don't know
whether she was abused or anything.

What could I do to get her to warm up? I have thought of getting another
kitten. Maybe if she saw another cat here that was not afraid and was not
abused, she might warm up.

If she doesn't warm up, she will still have a home here. I made a
commitment to care for her and plan to fulfill it

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,,,

My father has a cat that took six months for it to even go near him. Now,
the two are inseparable! This cat implicitly trusts my dad now. Just be
patient; I'm sure your cat will like and respect you even more for it.

"/> Very wise. At 7 months she is still very much a kitten, but it's time
to get her neutered.

I had one cat which turned into a lap cat when he was 5 years old, so
patience is what's called for. Some cats never get very affectionate -
it's not in their personality. Maybe also she gets her companionship
from your dog, which is great for them but a pity in some ways for you!

You could also try bribes - offering her food treats she has to come to
get from you. I use that method to get mine in sometimes. The ones I
buy come in nice little packs which I can rustle, and the cats associate
the sound with a treat. I always give them the treat when they come to
the noise.

Allan,
Might I suggest something that worked for me with a very skittish
cat that I got, also as a kitten. Sounds so similar to yours. I guess
I took a &quot;take charge&quot; approach&quot;. I stopped waiting for her to come to
me...I realized that this would probably not happen and soon I would
have a cellar cat. So, I started to CONSTANTLY handle her. Every
moment I had free, would gently pick her up, kiss, coddle and treat
with extreme sweetness. It gradually happened that she realized I was
NEVER a threat. I don't think she realizes now that have any capacity
to harm her. She is now 2 1/2 years old, still very skittish of
everyone else but me. Yours will probably be the same..a one person
cat. Keep this approach going and don't stop. It took my little gal
several months before she stopped running from me each time. She still
darts now and again, but I think it is to stay in practice (just in
case). She is now quite affectionate, but it did take alot of
approaches. And I love your stick-to-it-ness. Too many people drag
their pets back to he pounds.
Please put my address in your book and e-mail me, say April Fool's
Day. I'm most interested..I hate stories with no endings.

&gt; One of my cats was like this too for at least the first year of her

"/> life. I got her at about 8 weeks. I just kept trying to pet her and
never show any signs of aggresion or anger to her. Try petting and
talking to her while she is eating. I have read they will assoiate the
petting with comfort feelings of eating. Patients is the key here
because mine is now 4 years old and she is now the most affectionate of
3. She is so lovable now she is always trying to sit on our laps and
she will sit with us for hours!!! Don't give up!! Good luck!! It
sounds like she has an excellent home!!! PS.. I would let her get
comfortable with her new home before introducing a new kitten to the
family. Cats are territorial and could cause her more anxiety.

I found that it is more effective if I leave her alone, but

a little more.

I can also see that much can depend on the companion, if
the skittish animal is still a kitten. Allan has a dog, and
if the dog is friendly and affectionate, the cat may start
imitating it. That is precisely what my skimmish kitty does:
she has learnt to walk all over me when I'm in bed, because
she saw the big cat do it and she decided I was not dangerous
when lying.

"/> I agree with this. I someone tries to force themselves on you do you
like it?

Personally I find hand-feeding cat treats helps, sitting quietly, and
taking things *very* slowly. Also if the cat is playful playing will
help - 'cat fishing rods' are very popular with mine, so popular I have
to put it in the wardrobe when I'm not using it!

Feed-time is another change to get the cat to come. If you can feed
little and often, until the cat is a bit more familiar with you.

The bottom line is I allow my cats to choose if they are going to
approach me or not. After all, they have their own likes and dislikes.
