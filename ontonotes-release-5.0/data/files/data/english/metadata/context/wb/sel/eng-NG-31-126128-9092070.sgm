The Malibu &quot;Castle&quot; burned down. Bob reportedly owned it at one time.
I guess it was up for sale and actually due for a walkthrough this

Castle burned down, this afternoon I think.  Nothing left evidently
but walls and a gate.  It's all at CNN, I'd guess, or the LA Times
website.  Haven't checked either; I just heard about the fires from a
friend whose family's ok but who told me they were thinking about
evacuating Pepperdine U.

I'm telling you Bob Dylan/Satan is behind this.

It was supposed to be my castle for all my friends from the computer,
and then I found out about it, and told everybody, then he sold it,
and now he is burning it down, just to humiliate me, and get me back
for saying that I was going to make him the laughing stock of the
modern world, and now that is what he is doing to me, and so he burned
down my castle, and he also burned down my mother's cousin Leila's
house because she had Bob Dylan's autograph in it, and because of what
I said to John at the concert where Bob Dylan made me come on stage
and then raped me.

OMG, California is on fire, and I forgot all about it, and didn't know
about today, and am just completely self-obsessed and doing my writing
all day and shutting out all reality, what about the people suffering
all over the world, is it really bad of me to ignore that California
is on fire, just because it's all over the news, didn't Bob say that
he doesn't like watching T.V. because he feels manipulated, that's
exactly how I feel, there is tons of stuff going on all over the
world, do I really wanna get caught up in the excitement, I mean, it's
like drama, the whole thing is drama, I don't mean that it's not real
and tragic, but it's all over the world, why should I suddenly stop my
life loving Bob Dylan and mourn for the California fires, what about
the people starving all over the world, what about all the people
suffering from cancer, what about the war, what about this, what about
that, what the fuck, am I supposed to feel bad that I spent all day
being happy while California is on fire.

Fuck, I just wanna be alone with Bob Dylan and hide.

No confirmation and probably not likely.  The place was only built in the
70s and didn't have that many owners.

As to Bob's real house, as of this afternoon the fires were going south of
there.

Hopefully there will be no more loss of life in this our latest
environmental disaster.

We're in the advisory evacuation area right now. Flames are a couple miles
to the south, and unless there's a drastic wind shift tonight, we should be
okay. Prior experience tells me I don't need to worry until I see flames on
the ridge behind my house.

Now I need to rant a little bit. I'm tired of news reporters and fire
officials criticizing people for trying to save their houses. Almost all the
houses that are going up are in developed, non-wooded residential areas,
where the fire is propogated by embers only. The bottom line is, if you're
up on your roof putting the embers out with a garden hose, you're probably
going to save the house. It's not something that firemen have the time or
the resources to do on every house, so there's no reason why able bodied
grown men shouldn't be allowed to try and save their property. They're not
interfering with fire crews, they're perfectly cognizant of the danger, and
they should have every right to face it in the defense of their homes should
they so choose. When local authorities start issuing these mandatory
evacuation orders, the result is that hundreds of houses burn to the ground
that didn't need to.

Rant over. Thank you for the kind wishes.

&gt; &gt; Be safe, Badlands420! Hope you didn't have to evacuate.

&gt; We're in the advisory evacuation area right now. Flames are a couple miles
&gt; to the south, and unless there's a drastic wind shift tonight, we should be
&gt; okay. Prior experience tells me I don't need to worry until I see flames on
&gt; the ridge behind my house.

&gt; &gt; I just saw on
&gt; &gt; the news how one man
&gt; &gt; saved his house with a garden hose, while all the houses around him no
&gt; &gt; longer exist. What a scary situation for everyone involved.

&gt; Now I need to rant a little bit. I'm tired of news reporters and fire
&gt; officials criticizing people for trying to save their houses. Almost all the
&gt; houses that are going up are in developed, non-wooded residential areas,
&gt; where the fire is propogated by embers only. The bottom line is, if you're
&gt; up on your roof putting the embers out with a garden hose, you're probably
&gt; going to save the house. It's not something that firemen have the time or
&gt; the resources to do on every house, so there's no reason why able bodied
&gt; grown men shouldn't be allowed to try and save their property. They're not
&gt; interfering with fire crews, they're perfectly cognizant of the danger, and
&gt; they should have every right to face it in the defense of their homes should
&gt; they so choose. When local authorities start issuing these mandatory
&gt; evacuation orders, the result is that hundreds of houses burn to the ground
&gt; that didn't need to.

&gt; Rant over. Thank you for the kind wishes.

I am also thinking of you while hoping for the winds to calm down.
May you not see flames on that  ridge behind your house.

We got throught the night and we're still here, although many people on our

Here's some info from my father in law in Malibu:

Just got back from talking to a fireman who was now going to San Diego
where
the problems are horrific. The fires coming nearly on to PCH are under
control and so they can reduce their watch. Smoke still makes the sky
grey
and glows red in the sunset. We had 1500 firefighters here on sunday
and
monday. They did fantastic work from the air during daylight dumping
water
and controlling all the operations for miles with many small and large
fires, as more and more broke out. It all started in malibu Canyon and
within minutes a church was destroyed. The flames then drifted down to
PCH
and damaged some roofs slightly of the shopping centre
and then went to the COlony and destroyed two houses. The winds have
been
ferocious since friday night and they are still with us but not nearly
so
strong as I write. They come off the desert and are hot. The
temperatures
have been 90 here today. The wind was the cause of it all of course.
The
hills over a huge area are burnt. However things are so much worse in
San
Diego area. they say 1 million people have been forced to evacuate. As
you
can imagine there are soup kitchens, schools turned into dormitories
and the
navy are giving up their barracks to house people

Thank you Martin .  It feels essential to hear from individuals who
are there. Entire communities' lives are being transformed.

For those of us who feel inclined to do so, may I suggest gathering
healing intentions in the heart,  loading them with good vibes and
deep breaths of life, then sending them forth to the regions affected,
as often and as deeply as we feel led to.
Leave your feet on the ground as you do so. I am not joking.  I ain't
crying either, just suggestin' workin' positively the energy of the
inner heart (chakra) and sharing it with others,  with our intentions
crossing the distances,  breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and
sendin' blessings, good vibes for sure, to the land, to the people in
their hour of need. Also lendin' the wonderful firefighters continued
strength, vitality and courage.

Thanks again Martin for sharing your father in law news.

if it should spread to anyones property let it be those who easily

no one else will

It looks like we're in the clear for now. Things didn't look so good
yesterday afternoon; the fire got into the hills west of Lake Hodges, where
it was shielded from the Santa Ana winds, and started roaring northward,
taking a couple hundred houses with it in Del Dios and burning into Harmony
Grove, less than a mile to the south of here. It was there that the heroic
efforts of three agencies (Montebello FD out of East LA, CDF bulldozer
crews, and US Navy helicopters) stopped the thing cold and kept it out of
San Marcos. Those guys rule and we are in their debt.

This thing is not over by any means, though. There's serious shit going down
in the eastern mountains of the county (Palomar Mountain is in a lot of
trouble right now, as is my parents' house in Julian), as well as in the
south county near the border, north of here in Fallbrook, and at Camp
Pendleton where they have two new fires burning out of control.

Now I just wanna know where the Chargers are playing their &quot;home&quot; game this
Sunday. If it's in Phoenix, I might make the drive out there.

Good car to drive after a war.

Or the coming Apocalypse.

I dunno.

I didn't see the movie, but is it anything like Mad Max?

Really hot, people sweating and wearing t-shirt rags, and guns and
jeeps after some kind of war?

Well, with global warming and the ensuing fight for survival, I
suppose a Cadillac SUV is exactly what the Dylan's of the future will
be driving.

There won't be any more of my people.

It's just me, and I'm taking my genes with me.

Don't worry.

I'm never coming back.

Unless you are going to bring me back on purpose to send me to Hell.

Sorry.

Ok, bye.

Now that I think about it more, I actually know quite a few people like
that. Constantly strapped for cash, but always tooling around in a brand new
car. Usually a gas-guzzling SUV that's at least twice as big as any car they
could ever need.

Typically, these are also the same people who incessantly complain about
high gas proces.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The world's falling apart.  I'm on Lake Lanier (or what used to be) in
&gt; &gt;&gt; N GA.  It looks like a nice place for horses now.  But at least those
&gt; &gt;&gt; mussels down in Fl are ok.  And I wonder...  if they're endangered,
&gt; &gt;&gt; then why are they eating them?

&gt; &gt; Water shortages throughout the American souths...  Runaway growth and
&gt; &gt; development...  Building large communities in essentially what is a
&gt; &gt; desert (the Southwest)...  Reliance on non-renewable, now-remote
&gt; &gt; resources (oil)...  Is it the American Dream or the American Facade?...

&gt; Don't worry.  It'll be alright as long as we all drive big Cadillac SUVs.

An Escalade, anyone?...  When my sister informed me that Bob was going

It's really too perverse...

Ironically, a very good book on the West and its water resources (or
lack of thereof, and how the rerouting of the Colorado river to feed
the Southwest and enable large human communities to exist there) is
called 'Cadillac Desert:  The American West and Its Disappearing
Water'...  Cadillac it is...

It wouldn't surprise me if a lot of Dylan fans who object to the commercial
went out and bought Caddys.
