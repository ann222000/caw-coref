I am looking for shoes that will fit my muscular calves (17&quot;) and in a
search these came up.  I'm not sure what kind of warped female or drag
queen could carry these off but I had to share.

It also inspired me to do a layout on my favorite things that my
mother went &quot;but Kate why&quot; since I had a favorite pair of shoes that I
wore out (thank you Aunt Florence for the $$$$) that my mother H A T E
D!

Also, Kate, you don't have to fool us.  It's ok if you was looking for these
for yourself to buy.  Or are you showing these to us and you have already
bought them. LOL

Shannon,

Very funny, with all that I've been through a broken leg is the last
thing I need.  I am curious as to how one would stand with them on.
Then again Larry looked at them (and being a typical male) said &quot;honey
you're not meant to stand in them.&quot;

I wish I had a picture of my favorite boots....I wore out two pair of blue
Kangaroo Boots in the late 60's and early 70's.
I have to find the photo of my oldest daughter dressed in my 60's clothing
for a special day at school. That would be a good one to scrap.
