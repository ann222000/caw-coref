I don't have cable TV, satellite TV, etc.  Just a few regular channels.
Those channels were recently added to by three.  Last night I was flipping
through and caught the last half hour of the goofy older film, 'Amityville
Horror'.  Oh my!

I have long lamented the loss of the old Friday night &quot;Creature Feature&quot; on
U.S. network television.  Tonight, this same channel is showing Stephen
King's 'Carrie'!  7:00p.m.  I'm going to make some popcorn and snuggle with
Persia while I watch what would have been scary 30 years ago. LOL

Even though I knew what was coming, I jumped too!  LOL  It was fun to see it
again.  Wonder if they are showing another creepy movie tonight?  I'll have
to check.

Oh, and Persia pretended great interest in the popcorn I made but then only
licked the salt off a piece and then ignored it.

Yeah, that type of stuff is on cable now.

All the channels are full of horror movies this week. I enjoy some
creepy movies, but most of the contemporary ones are too bloody and
gross for my taste. I want to feel unsettled, creeped out, but NOT
grossed out, thank you!

Don't you just love the Halloween season? Last night I watched Silence
of the Lambs. I think we've watched all of the Jason and Michael
movies now and the first Chuckie movie (the others got old real fast).
We at least watch parts of them, you don't have to watch the entire
movie since you know what's going to happen. We flip over to the ball
game and between innings watch the movies until the scary parts when
we stick with the movie.  Speaking of popcorn, I bought a WhirleyPop
popping pan from Bed Bath and Beyond a week ago.  I wanted real popped
popcorn. It takes less than 5 minutes to pop and tastes so much better
than microwave popcorn.  I can highly recommend this pan if anyone has
seen it and considered buying it.

Of course I'm not talking &quot;slasher movies&quot;.  No Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  No
slice and dice.  I love 'Poltergeist' (the first one... I tend to dislike
sequels of anything).  It was sufficiently creepy without being overly
gross.  Might have to pop that in the VCR on 10/31 ;)

Read the book before I ever saw the film, but that was one hell of a
performance by Anthony Hopkins.  I'm going to watch 'Meet Joe Black'
tonight.  Joe is Brad Pitt, and I never liked him until I saw him in this
film.  Love the musical score by Thomas Newman.  This is a remake of a black
&amp; white film called 'Death Takes a Holiday' which was made back in the
1930's.

Microwave popcorn is a blight on the world!  In every place I have worked
people bring it in for &quot;lunch&quot;.  Now that's nice and healthy! (NOT!)  That's
not butter, it's powdered stuff with a bunch of chemicals.  And it stinks to
high heaven.  The stuff reeks.

I cook popcorn the old fashioned way.  3 Tbs. oil (preferably corn oil), 1/4
cup popcorn.  Heat the oil until it just starts to sizzle.  Toss in a corn
kernel.  When it pops, add the rest of the popping corn.  Then cover the pan
and shake it.  Shake it, shake it, shake it baby! over the burner.  Keep it
moving.  In about 3 minutes, there will only be one or two kernels left
popping.  It takes an amazingly small amount of popping corn to fill a 4
quart pan.

Drizzle it with melted butter and sprinkle it with salt.  Put the lid back
on and shake it up to mix well.  Voila!  Then go enjoy your movie :)

You might enjoy the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series - funny, cheesy, not too much gore
(worst I was was someone getting 'stabbed' in the ankle with a pencil (ouch)
a tree come to life and get a bit 'handsy' with a female).  There are 3
flicks in the series:

Evil Dead (cost less than $400,000 to make in 1979-80, and is *still*
bringing in money)
Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (question, after their experiences in the cabin in
the first movie - why do they go back?)
Ash vs. the Army of Darkness (a 1973 Olds Delta 88 in medieval times????)

All three star Bruce Campbell, and all three directed by Sam Raimi (director
of the recent Spiderman movies, and one of the producers of the Hercules
(starring Kevin Sorbo) and Xena (starring Lucy Lawless) series) - the one
Army of Darkness is the cheesiest of all, and has it's own cult
following....

In all tree of the Evil Dead movies, Sam put some sort of reference to a Wes
Craven horror flick in it (a movie poster on a wall, or some such thing -
and IIRC, Wes started doing the same in some of his movies, particularly
having a character watching Evil Dead in his movie A Nightmare on Elm
Street, as well as a poster from Evil dead on a wall.... AFAIK, they are
still at this 'competition'....

The WhirleyPop work similarly except it has an &quot;agitator&quot;, for lack of
a better word.  You turn the handle that is attached to the agitator
and it stirs the kernels and then the popped corn as well so nothing
burns.  I have cooked lots of popcorn your way (being about the same
age) but this way seems easier to me. I agree about popcorn for lunch.
My desk is near the area where the microwave is and the smell of
popcorn is only welcome if it comes after our oriental lab workers
have cooked their fish lunches. Whew!! I really dislike having to
smell everyone's lunch every day.
