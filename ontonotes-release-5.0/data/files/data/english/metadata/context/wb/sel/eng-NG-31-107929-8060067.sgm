1) where's the list?

2) I can't think of ten American sports cars.  There's the Corvette, the
Solstice/Sky, and then you have to get real obscure...  Muntz Jet,
Kaiser Darrin, that's all I can think of off the top of my head.  Unless
you count specials like Old Yaller.

One of the first- at least the first postwar, American sports cars was
the Crosley Hotshot/Supersport.  It won Sebring one year.  At least it
won on the formula, which considered milage during the race AND
displacement of the engine.  The Hotshot only had 740cc (45 ci) so
that gave it a BIG handicap advantage.  I lusted over them when I was
a kid, kind of forgot about them, and now I can't afford one 'cause
they are so expensive!

Back around 1952 (When I was a kid, about ten years old) I was riding
with my dad and we stopped at a gas station.There was a Crosley station
wagon car at the gas station.I asked my dad if he would buy that car for
me.
There really is ''something'' about quirky little cars.

The Avanti?  It kicks arse, but it's not a real sports car.  Same could
be said for the Golden Hawk, Speedster, Super Hawk etc.  Studebaker
never made a car after 1953 that wasn't based on either their generic
sedan chassis (including the Lark and Avanti) or the C/K body chassis
(coupe/hardtop, Speedster, Hawk, GT Hawk etc.)

I'm using wikipedia's definition of a sports car:
&quot;A sports car is an automobile designed for performance driving. Most
sports cars are rear-wheel drive, have two seats, two doors, and are
designed for precise handling, acceleration, and aesthetics. A sports
car's dominant considerations can be superior road handling, braking,
maneuverability, low weight, and high power, rather than passenger
space, comfort, and fuel economy.&quot;

And thus, in no particular order, here are the American Sporty Cars I
can think of.

Vette
Viper
Solstice/Sky
Mustang
Cougar
Thunderbird
Camaro/Firebird
Fiero
Dodge Charger
Plymouth Laser/Eagle Talon (although they're half Japanese)
Ford Probe
Saleen S7
Vector
Delorean
Moser Raptor
Panoz

Note that not all versions of the above cars are that sporty, but I'm
not getting that specific.

I'm willing to give a half point to performance editions of certain
other cars too, most of them being &quot;sport coupes&quot; such as the Beretta
GTZ, Monte Carlo SS, and stuff, but they're not really sports cars.

The Laser was Chrysler-badged.  The Dodge Daytona was of course the same
body with a smaller engine.  Dunno if they sold the thing under the Plymouth

My experience with these cars is that everything on them that was made in
Japan just keeps running and running, and everything made in America falls
off or breaks.

Sports cars can have more than 2 seats. Who's going to say that a
Porsche 911 isn't a sports car?

And sports cars can have front-wheel drive. The Ford Probe fits into
this category as does the Lotus Elan (not fitting in this category
because it's English).

The Chrysler Laser was different from the Plymouth Laser. The Chrysler
Laser was entirely Chrysler Corporation designed while the Plymouth
Laser was primarily a Mitsubishi design.

I do have a problem with the Delorean being added to this list, since
it's Irish with a French engine. The Bricklin was Canadian, which is
far more American than the Delorean, but nobody's mentioned it.

Wrong &quot;Laser.&quot; You're thinking of the Dodge Daytona / Chrysler Laser
(which they may have spelled 'Lazer') from the 80s, which was 100%
Detroit. 2.2 (or 2.5L) Chrysler 4-cylinder power, though later I think
they weighted it down with the POS Mitsubishi 3.0 v6 like they did the
LeBaron. Awsome little cars, the turbo versions went like stink. There
was even an IROC R/T version of the Daytona with the 2.2L 220HP DOHC
turbo, which was incredibly fast. Sub 12 second fast. Unfortunately, the
lifespan of the timing belt on that Lotus-head version of the engine was
about 10k miles. It was basically a demostration engine that was put in
limited production for enthusiasts. Very collectable cars now.

He was talkng about the Eagle Talon/PLYMOUTH Laser/ Mitsushitti Eclipse
from the 1990s, which regardless of badge was 100% Mitsubishi junk.

lol, no it's not.
:)

dictionary.com:
&quot;sports car
–noun
a small, high-powered automobile with long, low lines, usually seating
two persons.&quot;

IMO, &quot;sports car&quot; is a fairly liberal definition that depending on how
you look at it, can include stuff like Mustangs, or does not.

It's one of those &quot;you know it when you see it&quot; - a Honda Insight seats
two people, yet it's sure no sports car.

It's like defining &quot;Muscle Car&quot; - to some people, because a Trans Am is
a &quot;pony car&quot;, that means it's not a muscle car... even though it
basically came with the same engines as a GTO and was often faster...

It's partly why I changed it to &quot;sportY&quot; car - I have a 2001 Trans Am
and yet do NOT consider it a sports car.  I had a Fiero, it was no
sports car either.

If two seats is a serious criteria, you have to include the first
Firehawks (available as a two seater) and the Cobra R Mustang from a few
years ago - it also only came as a two seater.

That really doesn't fit everything, either. Would you consider an early

You're quite right, although I would argue that there is a more widely

ok, how about this list of American (GM, Ford, Chrysler, etc...) two
seater sports cars?

1. Vette
2. Viper
3. Solstice/Sky
4. Thunderbird
5. Ford GT40
6. Saleen S7 http://www.saleen.com
7. Mosler http://www.moslerauto.com
8. Fiero
9. Firehawk
http://www.yearone.com/enthusiast/articles/3rdn4thperformancearticle/...
10. Cobra R http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang_SVT_Cobra
11. Vector http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_W8
12. AMX http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_AMX
13. Panoz Esperante http://www.panozauto.com

all of them are two seaters.
If they MUST be without a fixed roof, the list shrinks...

I like both versions of the list, but I'd add the Plymouth Prowler to
both. Retro-rod styling aside, it meets all the other requirements of
both lists.

And if we're going back to add the '55-57 Thunderchickens, there are a
few other oldies that could be added. I don't even want to start
thinking pre-war, it gets way too complicated. :-)

How about 2002-2005? They were two seat convertibles with a V-8.

I don't see either of the recent Cadillac 2 seaters in the list
(Allante and XLR)

How about the Buick Reatta? And the Chrylser TC?

D'oh. Yes, although for some reason I've never been able to think of

Because there was no stickshift option, and no high-performance
options at all.

True story; at the time the &quot;new&quot; bird was introduced, SWMBO was
working for Ford as an internal auditor.  She was invited to some roll-
out presentation, apparently to pump up the enthusiasm of Ford
employees for their new products.  She apparently ended up chatting
with some powertrain engineer type and asked him if there were any
plans down the road to introduce a SVT version, she suggested maybe a
supercharged version as a homage to the Paxton/McCulloch equipped
'57s.  The engineer deferred answering the first part of the question
and expressed skepticism that Ford had ever made a supercharged T-
bird.  I hope that that wasn't a *senior* powertrain engineer...

As far back as 1957, Ford offered Supercharged Thundrbird cars for
sale.McCulloch centrifical supercharger, 300 Horsepower.Even I knew
that.
Do you remember those old Jiggs and Maggie comic strips? Back in the
1950s, Ford used to have some great big Jiggs poster boards hanging
around in their factories.The Jiggs poster boards said, Sure, And
Quality Counts!

So did I, simply because I used to have a Studebaker Golden Hawk, so
it was good to know what parts interchanged with more common makes,
e.g. if I saw a good deal on a &quot;Ford Thunderbird supercharger kit&quot; I
knew that I could use the blower on a Studebaker :)

I may like old cars, but no, there's no chance in heck of me

World War Two Jeeps are also sort of known as the All American Wonder.I
nominate those Jeeps as ''Sports Cars''.
There is (or used to be) a World War Two Jeep in the Smithsonian Museum.

Oh geez. I could envision similar comments from engineers at Chrysler
following the mass exodus after the Diamler fuc^H^H^H^ takeover. But I
think a little pocket of old-timers (or at least interested and
knowledgable new-timers) survived somewhere deep in there. The big
question now will be whether Nardelli runs *them* away :-(

hey, at least Chrysler brought out some RWD cars after MB took them
over.  I almost bought a Magnum or a Charger when I was family car
shopping.  I woulda even bought a V6.  We ended up with the Subaru
Legacy Wagon tho, mostly because of cost, and partly because it had a
stick, and partly because it was the first family car we could both
agree on.

Odd...but the definition listed above says USUALLY a 2-seater. That's
not &quot;central to the definition.&quot; A 2+2 can be a sports car as well.
