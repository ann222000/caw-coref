[two quick footnotes and then continuing on with the main thread...]

1 -- in other words, there is no doubt that people are being
discriminated against based on sex/gender dynamics as to basic human
relations in the state. the basic relation of people _begins in a
state of bias, and functions on the basis of these interactions.

2 -- in some sense, 'marriage' could be considered a structural
relationship between male patriarchy and female matriarchy as to 'one
being' and co-existence, as mediated through religious and cultural
traditions and... as to overall balancing of the self with self and
other (and neutral balancing of state)...
===

continuing with the general investigation of human relations in a
context of sex/gender dynamics...

it is possible to model a single human who exists in a one-sided
condition as to 'total being' of male-female dynamics... as such, in
the above diagram this is a man/male who is on one-side of the sex/
gender divide.

it is then possible to model this single human individual in relation
to the issues of 'family structure' and of parent-child relations...

in that the role of the 'parent' then encompasses spanning both the
male and female of parenting, of mothering and fathering, in some
way, as this then influences how a child will develop in their male-
female dimensionality, for better/worse.

in other words, a single parent exists on one-side of the traditional
balancing of issues between mothers (woman) and fathers (man), in
terms of the matriarchal/patriarchal divide in how sex/gender
relations exist. and from this one-sided situation it is then an
issue of providing a balanced upbringing for the child, in terms of a
stable relationship within such a dynamic, as it relates to parent-
child, and of the child with their self and other children, families,
and so on.

thus, in a two-parent family of man and woman, the child would
exist between the two parents, in a more neutral overall balance (N),
whereas in a one parent family, this then defaults to one-side or
another, as a context in which relations are to find grounding, (i.e.
of mental circuits connecting with physical circuits in modeling of
one's existence, and rationalizing this in term of a such a
perspective) etc.

the 'balance' of an individual parent then would be important as to
how a child would be able to find balance with themselves and others.
if existing as as human, they may then operate within certain
functioning, whereas if existing as binary fe|male or wo|man, they
could then be forced into bias, from a condition which is 'sided'
from the beginning.

(note: this same dynamic could relate to children of divorced parents
if they stay with one parent, yet this is only a sketch and it is
mentioned only as a potential reference).

in any case, to give an example of what this scenario is implying is
to consider a view of a single parent, yet this time on the side of
matriarchy...

in a matriarchal organization it may be that women share a certain
social structure and thus if married couples divorce or even never
wed, there may be some connection in  the raising of children amongst
individual women who exist in a larger community of single parents
who are women.

this is to try to setup the conditions in which parenting exists in a
binary condition of 'men' and 'women' and that parenting then falls
onto women, by default somehow. and in such a scenario, it is
proposed that the relation of the parent with the child within these
same terms of binary being (of male or female, man or woman) then
creates a certain ideological predisposition, for how a child will
develop via this dimensionality...

[note: it is realized the mishmash of these words, yet the intent is
they suffice enough to supplement the diagrams and elucidate various
key points, however difficulty. this is an area of what is assumed
'recognizable' and pervasive issues as regards single parents who are
raising children from within unbalanced conditions, with catastrophic
effects...]

in other words if a parent is a single mother and 'the family' exists
on one-side of the sex/gender divide -- in this case, that of the
female, -- and in addition, the parent is to mediate this condition
in binary terms of 'being male/female' and 'being man/woman' -- that
if the mother were to relate as a woman to the child (say, a male in
this example) that, for this child to have a 'balanced' development
they may be forced to locate their male 'parenting' within a
patriarchal context (all male) if the single parent is unable to
provide this basic structuring/balancing of the individual child,
with their own self, via parenting and male dimensionality.

that is another way of saying that if considered in terms of 2-value
binary reasoning, a single mother who raises a female child would be
different from a single mother who raises a male child, if this
situation between the balancing of sex/gender was short-circuiting in
the family and the larger community. the 'male' child would likely
have to locate their shared male dimensionality outside the single-
parent family, as the father is absent, and moreso: this situation
would seem to propel this biasing if people exist in terms of 'being
man' and 'being woman', (being male/female) -- because it then
creates this division and legitimates it, as to establishing a shared
identity of self with the group.

[one more attempt: if the mother exists largely in 'female' terms
(+F/-F) and then the child happened to be male, because of the binary
condition of onesidedness of a given person via this parental
identity, would force a child to find the male relations (+M/-M)
outside of the family, by default of this sex/gender identity. versus
a human identity in which a larger total balance could be established
within the single parent family, etc).

in other words, the child in the previous example which may have
grown up within the context of matriarchy (hypothetically), then
because of binary sex/gender identity may be required to "balance"
themselves as males/man; and in particular, to distance any
identification with this female-side if identity exists in only black
or white terms of being. (male or female, man or woman -- 'i am man',
'i am all male', etc).

the point of walking through this is to see the structural dynamic at
work in this circuitry. the 'why' of children who develop along
patriarchal lines, who become imbalanced as a result of 'all male'
perspectives which become warped, distorted, as to the total range of
a self, for only one-side. which then sets up various other short-
circuiting relations with self and others...

for instance, two males who then function in binary terms of 'being
male' (all male) are in effect existing in a split state, in which
the whole self is divided and then it can be an issue of this chosen
'self' as it relates to another (the other, which is actually the
self) -- in which violence and other altercations can take place.

this is to say, these two people are stuck in a limited framework of
existence/being, in which 'man' becomes the pinnacle, the height of
reasoning and action, including group dynamics and individual value,
etc.  and the balanced human view, including 'female' dimensionality
could be sublimated if not totally denied, in an attempt at achieving
total manhood. the kind of biasing this sets up within individuals
then could become highly charged as to similarities and differences,
between people -- and in particular, between how these 'patriarchal'
males relate with females, on the other side of this situation.

note that the female dimensionality is gone (in the above diagrams)
and so this is then not a model of balanced people, and instead, 'all
male' patriarchy which is unbalanced and exists in a distorted state
of biasing, as to the total human condition (male-female).

the balanced view of patriarchy of male-organization would include
balancing of a total self as a being, within the shared set. so that
it is not only an issue of being male, it is also to include female
dimensionality, however sublime. leave it up to esoteric practices to
provide centuries if not millennia worth of examples that this is not
an aberrant POV.

in any case, 'humans' in patriarchy could still balance within the
total male set, as to the male-female dynamics, and retain a balanced
male-organization as it then can relate to matriarchy. the key to
this is that people retain their 'full self' (whole being) as they
can relate within this structuring, and not have to suppress or
repress or oppress their own humanity in order to co-exist...

for example, two humans within patriarchical organization would each
have their own dimensional relations as to male and female dynamics.
they each are unique people who have their own framework for
development through family structures. one person has their mothering
and fathering dynamics, and the other, their own experiences of how
these male and female relations configured the self in relation to
self, others, etc.

so here's a point that will be expanded on in the next post, of the
circuitry of relations...

it is in the matching of dimensions between these two people, as to
the shared relations across this male and female framework, that then
establish the basis for co-existence and shared-being as human men/
males. i.e. the basic relation between two people is related to
'values' which can establish a dimensional framework between the two,
if it is to be in balance, or it may be short-circuiting and not be
possible. yet, it is the individual male-female (+ and -) matrix
which then becomes the basis for a shared matrix which then places
both people in the same context. sexual identity is a foundation for
this type of connection between beings, because it is of the most
common structures that exist in humans (based on family structure of
fe|male dimensions of mothering and fathering).

in any case, the example above is of two humans who exist in
patriarchy as human males or men, yet still retain an overall balance
of this human dimensionality (m-f), even though existing on one-side
of the overall sex/gender divide. in some sense this could be
considered a model of patriarchy that then could potentially function
in regard to 'females' that would include 'female being' within this
'male organization' by default.

[cannot say it clearly enough, nor is it necessarily the goal. there
are enough anecdotes  of these situations to hopefully ground such
ideas in practices such as political outings where males dress up as
females and the like, as part of private patriarchal goings on. it is
only to offer enough of a suggestion that this is a mainstream
understanding, etc].

okay. back to the split people who exist in terms of 'all male'
ideology. in this same one-sided context (on the side of patriarchy)
-- these two do _not add up to a larger shared set of their full male
and female dimensionality. i.e. half the matrix is missing, that
which is associated with the female side (+ and -). instead, both
people are forced bias into only one binary half of their total self,
the 'all male' or 'only male' side. (male + and -).

so, this is a situation that is then getting more and more polarized
between individuals (as males) and groups (of 'all male' being). and
the critical aspect to consider is that this is not a balanced
circuit of the total self -- to balance it requires the 'other'
female side of this binary situation.

that is, in this 'all male' hierarchy, it may be that 'lesser
males' (weaker/passive) may be seen as part of this 'female'
dimensionality, or females who are outside of this context, on the
other side, outside of this biased patriarchal worldview, existing in
distortion.

this is to seek to say that there is a short-circuit within this all
male patriarchal ordering, and it is that the female is denied and
oppressed and suppressed within the individuals of this 'all male'
dynamic, even while it exists in every person as a human being. and
it is thus possible to 'short-circuit' the overall balance, such that
this regression of the self is taken out on 'others' or another, in
particular females, who have no value/little worth in such an 'all
male' perspective, except within a patriarchal view of what this is
to be.

[note: a sociology or anthropologist might be able to analyze such a
situation in terms of the woman/female having to exist as lower than
the lowest male, in relation to the total set of males, so as to
retain the all-male hierarchy. hypothetically. i.e. that women as sex
objects and commodities and merchandize for male-appetites and male
desire then becomes the basis for shared value and exchange, in
essence, economics of sex, in which the total human relation is
mediated in animalistic terms, within the status quo.]

in any case, in such a warped scenario whereby 'all male' patriarchal
ideology rules the relations between people, the binary division
between men and women then creates a gap between the 'whole' people,
that then can be mediated through another via sex/gender identity. as
such, a woman who relates in this 'all male' ideology must then enter
into a certain relation in order to balance with this total set
(which is lopsided, on one-side of this situation, the patriarchal).
and as such, the short-circuit within the male or 'man' then requires
this woman to feed the ideological structure itself (the illusion)
and it is through this power over another/others, that the 'all male'
ideology continues to function, with or without females, which then
would include male on male violence/etc.

in other words, it is the short-circuiting of the one-sided biased
males who reason in black and white terms, that then creates this
situation that is fed by others who relate in this same warped
dynamic, as to male-female balancing. it is for the reason of this
one-sidedness that then propels a certain large-scale bias, across
whole communities and demographics, as to how males and females, men
and women relate, as it then can be seen related to broken families
and binary biasing of gender within parenting, as it then feeds into
patriarchal and matriarchal divisions -- rather than human balancing,
into which children are to grow and develop within a stable and
healthy dynamic range, versus a one-sided caricature of 'being man'
which actively devolves the human soul.*

(* soul is used in this context because so much of what occurs in
these terms is entirely soulless - yet 'being' could be used instead.
it is of tragedy, the human devastation and dehumanization of self
and others, in these terms. and for all the religiosity that is often
bandied about, it is these types of short-circuiting relations that
attain evil proportions. sometimes it is necessary to say so. that
this is base and degrading as to being and co-existence and must
eventually be recognized as such when all is to be accounted for.)
