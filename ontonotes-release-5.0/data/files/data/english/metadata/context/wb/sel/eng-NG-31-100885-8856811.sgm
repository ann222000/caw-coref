Hi all,

I got up this morning to find Honey has totally trashed her house.  She has
even thrown her heavy bowl across her house from one side to the other and
now there are pellets everywhere.  All the newspaper has been shredded and
there is hay everywhere.  Now she is at the door wanting out.... What do I
do?  Michael says not to give in to her if its bad for her to be out.  She
is certainly perky enough.  What should I do?  Miranda ( who is in the
bottom level below Honey) has started to trash as well but not to the extent
that Honey has.

Regards Kate and the 2 madams :)

Let her out but keep her in a confined area.  No jumping on the couch!

I say let them out for a bit. They won't exert themselves if it hurts too
much.

I wouldn't let them out together though...one at a time. Remember, it takes
a few months for the hormones to recede, so you'll get some pms symptoms
during that time too.

spay stiches are very dangerous to come out. i myself. would not even
chance it. i know of a horror story where a bunny had her stiches come
out. :( the end results were awful. i don't even want to say what
happend.. she did die. :(  i have had to keep bunnies (teddy and piper)
confined in a pen for a month and a half. it was very important to do
so. i did... they delt with it.  one week is a breeze.  honey will be
fine.  and at least miranda is feeling enough pain to keep herself calm.
all my vets believe  in keeping operated buns (of that sort) in a tiny
pain. less insentive to move too much..
