Deadwind Pass pre-Kara?

Before the expansion, Deadwind Pass was one of my least-visited zones.
I think I may have killed a few ogres once.  I certainly never made it
all the way through the Vice down to where Karazhan now stands.

Was anything there before the expansion?  I assume there was at least an
area named Karazhan on the map, because the pre-expansion legendary staff
from Naxxramas specifically refers to it.

I wonder about this every time I ride down that path to my weekly Kara
run.

good question... that makes 2 of us.  I remember writing off that area
after I finished duskwood as one of those &quot;unfinished areas&quot;; i had
completely forgotten about it until I started running Kara.

I remember there being some houses and stuff down there and me

something.&quot;, but it's been a good while back and I can't remember a

standing &quot;back in the day&quot;?

i used to go down there to mess around every so often. everything then
was how it is now, save for the fact you obviously couldnt get in to the
place. the only thing im not sure on as i never went down there is the
two cellars that you collect the water from. im not sure what if
anything was down there pre-tbc.

The area hasn't changed as much as you might think. The cellars are new,
and the back stairs wasn't there (or at least not accessable), but Karazhan
itself was there, if not under that exact name. The whole bottom section of
the map had an area name, but I don't remember what it was. *

I was down in the area a few months before the expansion came out.  6
months before, maybe.
The cellars were there and you could kill the mobs in the place, they
were a lot easier to kill,
but they didn't drop anything good.
The back stairs were there too and you could walk up to the instance
portals at the front and the back door,
but they were blocked with gates as they are now.  Years ago I saw some
videos of people kiting gold farming bots off the bridge
between the back stairs and the instance portal to their death from the
fall.
There was also a crypt behind a locked gate over by the graveyard.
That's probably still there too, but I keep
forgetting to check.

I think it was fairly similar, only with lvl 60 undead instead of 70... not
entirely sure though as I never really went there; a friend went a few
times though and I've seen his screenies.

As others have said it looked pretty much the same - but the mobs
outside were of a lower level. They bumped them in the patch before the
expansion - which caught me by surprise when I was snooping around there

As other people have said, it was pretty much the same, except
level 60 undead townsfolk and no NPCs by the main entrance.
The tower was there, little bits of the map could be seen,
but you couldn't get in.  The cellar areas were there with
ghost mobs, just not much point to them (I fished down there
a couple of times).

The undead were upgraded to level 70 just before BC came out,
and people would group to kill them and get netherweave and
some early BC loot.

I remember kiting mobs to the cellar gate and then letting them kill me so i
could rez the other side and go into the cellar through an instance portal.
I don't remember it too clearly but can remember looking round the darkened
rooms and cells imagining all manner of new evil monsters and bosses, in
some ways it was more exciting than the real thing. It was around about the
time when there was a lot of exploration of unavailable new content going
on - same with climbing into hyjal summit via WS and dropping down then
destroying my HS to get through the invisible barrier. Also caverns of
time - fantastic to run through an empty new place like that, somewhere you
aren't supposed to be and just let your imagination take over.

An instanced area. The portal was behind a gate. That's maybe 6 months or so
before TBC, I forget.

I remember a few weeks before the expansion 7-8 of us made a raid and went
down there to kill some of the ghosts; it was actually a very fun challenge
killing mobs so much higher than us, although when a few people had to
leave it got too hard... once we were down to 4 we kept wiping every time
we got an add, which happened a lot with our aggro range :-) I think that
was about the only time I ever went there before the expansion; I really
should learn to explore more!

Heh. I had a small stack of netherweave nets that I would occasionally link

I knew one person who would farm the ogres in Deadwind Pass for
runecloth.

Also, gold farmers used to frequent the area.  There were some videos
floating around a while back of a guy who documented his gold farmer
bot killing spree.  From what I hear, he ended up getting banned for
harrasment of other players because of the videos.

Probably not as many as there were before though.  Gold farmers were
drawn to that area simply because of the lack of other players.  The
fewer players they run into, the less likely they are to be killed or
reported by them.

Imagine their surprse when one day all the ghosts gained 10 levels on
them.

I'm still not sure how they were able to make them unless the ghosts

They do drop it; I had about half a stack before TBC came so I could get
started on netherweave bandages easily :-)

That's it exactly. Perhaps it was changed later (though I'm pretty sure I
have gotten netherweave recently when jumped by a ghost), but when they
released the new talent trees BC, they also rennovated deadwind pass and
put the level 67+ ghosts there. For laughs, a group of us went down
there and farmed netherweave, just to link it and have people say &quot;wha?&quot; A
few &quot;needs level 65&quot; greens popped up too, and a different group actually
turned up a purple of that level that was endlessly linked in chat.

And then I was killing time pre-BC slaughtering furbolg and found the
netherweave net recipe on the timbermaw trainer - I immediately challenged
a guildie to a duel (something I NEVER do), and hilarity ensued when I
netted them. *

I found the net recipe almost as soon as it appeared as I was grinding
timbermaw rep at the time, so checking there often for new stuff to
make.  When I looked on thottbot at the time though I couldn't find a
source for netherweave without being in the TBC beta test.

&gt;&gt;Before the expansion, Deadwind Pass was one of my least-visited zones.
&gt;&gt;I think I may have killed a few ogres once.  I certainly never made it
&gt;&gt;all the way through the Vice down to where Karazhan now stands.

&gt;&gt;Was anything there before the expansion?  I assume there was at least an
&gt;&gt;area named Karazhan on the map, because the pre-expansion legendary staff
&gt;&gt;from Naxxramas specifically refers to it.

&gt;&gt;I wonder about this every time I ride down that path to my weekly Kara
&gt;&gt;run.

&gt;As other people have said, it was pretty much the same, except
&gt;level 60 undead townsfolk and no NPCs by the main entrance.
&gt;The tower was there, little bits of the map could be seen,
&gt;but you couldn't get in.  The cellar areas were there with
&gt;ghost mobs, just not much point to them (I fished down there
&gt;a couple of times).

&gt;The undead were upgraded to level 70 just before BC came out,
&gt;and people would group to kill them and get netherweave and
&gt;some early BC loot.
">

I farmed extensively there to get the enchanting pattern from the ogre
warlocks.  The ogres used to be bot city and it was quite a pain
outracing the bots to get the tags on the mobs.  The crypts didn't
change they just upleveled the ghosts.  They didn't drop much but when
they did drop something it was usually a blue.  I ghosted into the
locked crypt underneath the cemetary (Hellfire ftw) and explored it at
leisure - it's really, really cool down there but I have no idea what
they'll ever do with it.  Extremely creepy.
