Hi,

Bike's been in the shop since monday. I can't believe the withdrawal.
Feel free to ignore me...

Anyone dream about riding? I mean, not just think about it before you
fall asleep, but after you're asleep and running from wolves or
finding your lady is made out of sugar or seeing the end of the world,
you end up on a motorcycle? I was on one last night that sort-of flew.
And it growled like a beast. It was more like a roller coaster, having
several &quot;side cars&quot; in tandem, and i was in the front putting it over
some big hills and noticing it didn't really ever come back down. And
the other night i had a dream i was just riding my bike, plain and
simple. That's it, that's the dream, i pulled up to a stop sign,
slowed, and peeled away. The sound of the bike is the best part -
there's no &quot;reality&quot; to muffle it. I also had a dream about
countersteering. I guess i have concerns over my skills. I had a dream
where it wasn't working, and then i was going over my MSF course, and
then it was working again. Talk about practical!

Are bikes basically like tattoos, in that people either have one and
that's it or they have one and then they have two and then three ...
except more expensive? I admit i'm not thinking about *buying* another
bike, but my brother is buying a bike now (my progress inspired him to
get back into it ..) and i can see myself riding his. So it's sort of
like getting another. And he's probably going to get the sv650 since
it's the &quot;best bike ever&quot; ... &quot;after the norton 500.&quot; The big question
is ... what happens when i want to upgrade? I'll *probably* sell my
bike if i get one that feels the same, but if i decide i want a
totally different type of bike, then i'd have to keep my current one,
and from there i could just see the snowballing.

It took about 3 seconds for me to start desiring pipes. People are
*ALWAYS* talking about the pipes and as of a week ago i was thinking
that it was ridiculous. That's because i was looking in from the
outside. I'm going to start looking into them - i heard all the names
and i know you can &quot;sample&quot; the sounds on youtube. I want that deep
rumble. I don't care about performance and i don't necessarily want to
be louder, i just want the purr to be deeper. Am i a pipe stastic now?
Especially since i haven't put 10 miles on the bike yet? When i get it
back and spend all my time riding, will i want to upgrade my pipes
even more?

Do people ever actually get tickets for having too-loud pipes? I mean,
other than making lots of noise in a parking lot - if you're just
cruising along and get stopped, will a traffic stop ever include the
officer asking you to start the bike back up and let him listen to it
while you rev it? I could see myself fighting that easily - cops
aren't engineers, they can't gauge the decibal level, etc ... but does
it ever happen? In NY? It's not something to even consider, right?

What's up with whitewalls? I think they're badass and i'm replacing my
tires anyway, and i wanted to get whitewalls but *everyone* i know
told me not to. Said it would make my ride a clown cycle. Is that for
real? I don't really mind getting laughed at, but the shop had already
special-ordered my regular tires so i couldn't get them anyway, but
when next the tread is low i think i'm getting whitewalls. Is that
bad? My bike is black and white. How could it not be great?

Do highway bars offer saf&quot;ety? Is the thinking like ... if you spill
sideways and don't fly off the bike, one of your legs won't get
crushed by the bike? Do you people recommend them? Is it a style thing
mostly, giving the front a greater profile? In that sense, is it
visibility?

Is there some list of bike law differences by state? I know PA and CT
have no helmet laws. I was thinking more lanesplitting - some
reference of states where it's totally allowed? I couldn't imagine
driving through the city without splitting, and i realize it's
illegal, but i don't care about that at all. For other states though,
i'd at least like to be conscious of my violations. And when i say
&quot;lanesplitting&quot; i don't mean crotch-rocket zipping up a highway at
120+ between the cars, i mean mostly just zipping through when traffic
stops and less-often splitting in a way i could argue was for my own
safety.

What kind of security makes it hardest for someone to drive my bike
away? A huge chain lock or some kind of ignition-interrupt based on
proximity (i'm assuming those exist)?

Is there a benefit to parking near other bikes, or is it just a
pointless norm? I was thinking about it like maybe if i park near the
6 or 7 bikes it's more likely someone's watching over them. But then,
if a thief came alone, wouldn't it be easier to chisel out a lock or
something when near the cover of all the extra bikes? Or is the point
of parking near bikes that the bike thief is going to go for the most
expensive / least protected one, and it's a gamble but &quot;that's
probably not me&quot;? Is that the thinking?

And about tickets, is the rule basically that i need my plates on if i
park on the road and need them off if i park on the sidewalk? Trying
to not get towed, hopefully no tickets either.

Where do i stick an EZpass if i take off my windshield? Just anywhere?
There's a faraday effect with autos if the tag isn't right up on the
glass - does that mean i have to hold it over my head, or just away
from the bike? Should it be in a pocket? Ideally i can just go right
through the damned thing without having to adjust my riding - that's
the whole point.

In the movie &quot;Any Given Sunday,&quot; the sideways, foot-skidding dirt race
about 1/3 through the flick - does that go on anymore? I want to
watch! Is the shoe what makes that possible? (implying that the
correct shoe and the correct surface means that tactic would work in
other contexts?)

Is a throttle lock a good investment for highway riding? Are they
safe? I never looked into this but heard of it and thought it would
suit me.

How do i make my friends get into riding, other than making them
jealous? Everyone's bugging out about safety. That doesn't do anything
for my situation, but it means they won't be making up their minds to
try this anytime soon. Is &quot;just don't let them see you crash&quot; the only
way to win them over?

If there's a big group of bikes riding down the highway, and i come up
behind them, is there some code of ettiqutte about riding near them?
Like ... i'm not part of that, i should stay away? Or more-the-
merrier? Or there's no real rule, but say if i see them stop at a rest
stop and start talking i can feel them out and make a decision then? I
don't see myself making long hauls and/or wanting to ride with a band
of bikers, but ya never know! Does it matter if it's 4 bikes or 20
bikes or 80 bikes?

Gaaaaaaaah i want my bike.

It depends on what happens.  If you hit an animal or person on the
highway, engine guards could very well be the deciding factor, whether
or not you get a broken leg (mine have saved me one).  That's fairly
significant, actually.

But if your bike goes down on its side in soft dirt or in a ditch, the
guards might dig in and spin the bike violently (had that happen too).
Could make the bike start to do an end-for-end tumble, even.  Maybe
that's a little less significant than breaking a leg.

Overall, I'd say they're a safety plus.  They might prevent you from
getting your leg pined between the bike and the ground too.  They also
make a huge difference in terms of costly damage, should your bike
fall at slow speed.

Exhaust pipes are mostly about &quot;bling&quot; and a more mellow note. They usually
do nothing for performance. If you install aftermarket pipes, save the
stockers, original equipment pipes are expensive and you may need your old
pipes to cure a fix-it ticket.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You'll have to experience that for yourself. I have bought a few performance
systems, but never bought one just for styling or sound.

Of course. I know a guy who bought a Kerker and had the shop install it. But
he didn't have any way to take his OEM system home with him, so he left it at
the shop. He went out and got a fix-it ticket. for noise.

He went back to the shop and asked them to install his OEM pipes. But the
shop had sold his pipes because he'd left them there. So he bought a set of
OEM pipes to solve the fix-it ticket.

Then he went back to the same shop and bought another Kerker and left his OEM
pipes at the shop. He got another fix-it ticket and went back to the same sop,
and guess what? They had sold his second set of OEM pipes.

I could see myself fighting that easily - cops

Google Usenet for messages about whether NYPD uses a decibel meter. They

you. Then you have to prove you're an acoustical engineer before you can

It's a safety thing to keep the bike off your leg in a crash. Lower leg
injury is a big problem with motorcycles. I have met several riders who lost
their legs in crashes. The Hurt report says crash bars are ineffective to
protect your legs.

But crash bars do protect the engine cases. That's why some racing
organizations mandated crash protection or heavy duty engine covers on
certain Jap bikes.

Yes, there are. You can go to www.dmv.org to find an online vehicle code for

If you're going to ride around without license plates, expect to get stopped
and have your papers checked out. if you're riding without plates, never run
from the cops, they might shoot you. If you park your bike without plates,
expect it to get stolen or towed away.

The classic movie was called &quot;On Any Sunday&quot;. AMA flat track racing is still
done on dirt tracks all over the country. it's quite a show. The riders wear
a steel shoe on their left foot so they can stabilize the motorcycle while
slifing the corners. This works best on a &quot;cushion&quot; track of loose dirt, but
the limestone sand at Daytona makes for an awesome short track event that
draws spectators from all over the country during Bike Week.

Follow them at a respectful distance, don't break into their formation. When

Hey, it depends. There are outlaw bikers that will tell you that they don't
know you and tell you to move on. If you see a club wearing cut off levi
jackets and three piece patches on the back, they are outlaw bikers.

Other bunches of riders meet casually and go pack riding together and do
stupid things together, like racing on public streets and getting killed or
injured.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I don't see myself making long hauls and/or wanting to ride with a band

">

For some reason, new riders seem to think that pack riding is an expression
of solidarity and coolness and having somehow &quot;arrived&quot; in the world of
motorcycling.

Spontaneous pack rides are actually a public nuisance. Somebody is likely to
be injured or killed, and you might wind up going to the hospital to visit
some rider you hardly know, or you might be expected to go to am total
stranger's funeral, just because you and he both ride motorcycles.

A group of riders is no smarter than the stupidest rider. Four bikes is
plenty for a ride, if you show up somewhere with 80 bikes, expect to attract
law enforcement attention and get run out of a parking lot, unless you have
made arrangements with the business you are patronizing.

Pretty natural to be concerned at this stage of the game, and it's

Trying to describe the &quot;average&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; motorcyclist
is like trying to describe the average person in general; you
might be able to do it, but like the proverbial &quot;typical homeowner
with 2.3 kids and 1.7 dogs,&quot; there really ain't no such critter.
Some people fill garages and even whole houses with bikes
and associated thingamajigs; others are happy with one,
and lavish all their attention and farkle budget on that one, and
some have one and treat it pretty much as &quot;just a thing to
get me to work.&quot;  Find what works for you and your budget,

You HAVE pipes. What I suspect you mean is that

the &quot;loud pipes aren't good for anything&quot; camp - I like
to be able to hear what's going on around me as I ride,
and I especially like being able to continue hearing
afterwards.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Do people ever actually get tickets for having too-loud pipes?
">

Yes, they do; this varies considerably from region to
region, city to city.  Around here, Denver just recently
got VERY serious about cracking down on loud motorcycles,
and adopted a very stupid law that the AMA has been
fighting ever since.  By the way - have you checked out
the AMA yet?  You'll get a lot of opinions in both directions
re AMA membership as well, but I keep sending in my
dues because I like to have someone in my corner in just
these sorts of legal matters.

Different strokes for different folks.  On a classic/vintage bike
from an era where whitewalls were the norm, I personally
couldn't see any other choice.  On the other hand, they'd look
pretty silly on a modern sportbike or tourer.  You're talking
cruiser, I know, and so you've already parted ways with my
personal tastes in bikes anyway, so I will give no further opinion
about that.

You really should, and here's why.

As far as I know, California is the only state where lane-splitting
is completely legal; there are a few others where it remains a
gray area within the law.  In any state except California, though,
my experience is that very few cage drivers will be expecting
lane-splitting, and in some places they'll get outright hostile/nasty/
P.O.ed/soggy-and-hard-to-light about it.  Sometimes to the point
of trying to &quot;take out&quot; the rider who has the sheer gall (in their
opinion) to be trying it.  A little time spent with Google will no
doubt turn up numerous examples of such clowns suggesting that
driver block motorcyclists (f'rinstance, by suddenly opening their
doors) if they try to lane-split.  And even where it IS legal, that's
going to be a very small comfort when you go up against a
car and lose.   So my basic recommendation is to really try hard
to ride so as not to piss people off.  That's really hard to do
sometimes, but please remember that you ARE at a serious
disadvantage out there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Removing the wheels and locking it inside an armored truck
would probably make it hardest to drive away.  :-)  Short of
that, there's a plethora of chain locks, disc locks (things that
attach to your brake discs and make it impossible for the
wheel to turn very far if at all until they're removed), etc., which
can at least give you SOME better peace of mind.  Keep in
mind, though, that - even more than is the case with cars -
there's nothing that can give you a 100% guarantee your bike
won't be bothered.  Motorcycles are light enough that they can
even be lifted and hauled away if they can't be ridden away,
and a chain strong enough to prevent that with certainty isn't
going to be very convenient to carry.  And if they don't
take it, there are still plenty of cretins out there who will knock
the bike over, bump into it when parking, etc., etc., etc..
Life is risk; the best you can do is minimize the risk to the
extent PRACTICAL, and then simply accept the rest.  You
DO have insurance, right?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And about tickets, is the rule basically that i need my plates on if i

for the definitive answer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Where do i stick an EZpass if i take off my windshield? Just anywhere?

Anywhere there's no metal between it and the overhead sensors.
I just got the latest Rider WearHouse holiday catalog, and I see
they're carrying a handlebar-mounted carrier for the EZ-Pass
sorts of transponders.  I'm sure others have them as well.  It
DOESN'T have to be &quot;right against the glass,&quot; as there is no
surrounding metal cage structure as in a car.

The best thing I've ever found in that regard:

Simple, cheap, lets you rest your throttle hand, and there's
no worries at all about it being stuck &quot;on&quot; when you need
to cut the throttle RIGHT NOW.

&gt; way to win them over?
">

Not Everyone Gets It.  Basic fact of life.  If your friends
are representative of the population in general, I would guess
that one in ten, MAYBE, would become seriously interested in
motorcycling if they were properly exposed to it.  Another
1-2, maybe, out of that ten might try it for a while and then
move on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If there's a big group of bikes riding down the highway, and i come up
&gt; behind them, is there some code of ettiqutte about riding near them?
">

Don't just barge into a group.  Even if you come up on
just 1-2 other riders, you can't assume that they WANT
companionship on their ride.  If you get a chance to talk
with a rider or a group when stopped, you'll get some idea
as to whether or not they'll mind you riding &quot;with&quot; them.
In any event, DON'T try to ride in tight formation - definitely
not at this stage of the game.  Give yourself and the
other guy plenty of breathing space.  Don't tag along
directly behind him or her, either - if they're to the left of
the lane, follow behind and to the right if it's possible to do
that safely.  And above all, do NOT try to keep up with them.
Ride your own bike, at YOUR skill and comfort level.  If
it so happens that you're still with them after a mile or ten,
fine - but that's NOT your top priority.

Yes. pipes can make a slight difference in performance and a big
difference in your perception of yourself on a bike. I have V&amp;H pipes
on mine and it sounds bad-axx, but on longer trips, I come to hate the
pipes - that drone, hour after hour. Around town for short rides,
they're great.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Do people ever actually get tickets for having too-loud pipes? ...snipped...

Yes, they do but typically it's tied to gunning the engine. My son got
stopped yesterday by a local m/c cop. My son changed the grip of the
clutch and has less travel than before, meaing he has to give it more
gas at times. The cop simply told him to &quot;watch the throttle son. Some
neightbors have been complaining&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Guards do give your bike a wider profile as would a light tree up
front and big saddlebags in the rear. As for safety, I've heard of
folks here who attribute not losing a limb to engine guards. And if
you really want to stretch out on a ride, you'll want guards with
hiway pegs.

The ignition security systems do exist and come as n option on some
bikes, inc Harleys. I regularly use the fork lock and the fact that my
bike is 800+ lbs. Otherwise, you can carry around a heavy chain I

locks that bolt on to your front disc brake. Just remember to take 'em

I just like to know my limits. If i'm sharing the road with cars, i

bikes, don't creep into the cruiser circles, etc etc. Just had no idea
about whether there were standing codes.

Like if you go to a club, you don't just run up to a girl and start
dancing, you make eye contact and take it from there. If you go
running or biking, you don't keep pace because that creates a hazard,
unless you're having a conversation. If you play DDR, you don't shadow
without asking because that's distracting. Some of this is common
sense, some of it is only learned through exposure. I just wanted a

&gt; Not Everyone Gets It.  Basic fact of life.  If your friends
&gt; are representative of the population in general, I would guess
&gt; that one in ten, MAYBE, would become seriously interested in
&gt; motorcycling if they were properly exposed to it.  Another
&gt; 1-2, maybe, out of that ten might try it for a while and then
&gt; move on.

I just can't see why everyone wouldn't want to ride a motorcycle for
short distances. We all subway around the city, and i know a bike has
to be faster most hours of the day, if not all. Isn't time money?

I'll remain happy that i have 1 good friend who rides and a brother
who rides. And 3 new friends who are new to riding. I guess i'll just
have to make friends with bikers if i can't make bikers of my friends.

&gt; Don't just barge into a group.  Even if you come up on
&gt; just 1-2 other riders, you can't assume that they WANT
&gt; companionship on their ride.  If you get a chance to talk
&gt; with a rider or a group when stopped, you'll get some idea

&gt; In any event, DON'T try to ride in tight formation - definitely
&gt; not at this stage of the game.  Give yourself and the
&gt; other guy plenty of breathing space.  Don't tag along
&gt; directly behind him or her, either - if they're to the left of
&gt; the lane, follow behind and to the right if it's possible to do
&gt; that safely.  And above all, do NOT try to keep up with them.

When knowledgeble riders talk about &quot;outlaw bikers&quot;, they are not referring
&quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; on an interstate murder and robbery spree, as
Hollywood would like you to believe.

&quot;Outlaw biker&quot; refers to a rider who belongs to a motorcycle club. or &quot;MC&quot;,
as opposed to a an independent rider
such as yourself (at the moment) or a rider who belongs to an association,
such as the American Motorcyclist Association or some racing organization or
a brand-loyal club.

The American Motorcycle Association, as it was called in the 1950's
attempted to organize American riders into either road riding clubs or
competition clubs that raced in the dirt.

The road riding clubs attracted rich people and the road rides turned into
events where the best dressed rider or best dressed couple took a trophy home.
Obviously the richest riders would always win and they would run the
association and look down their noses at the poorer riders.

There were many riders who did not want to be judged upon their wealth, so
they didn't want to join an association that compared the wealth of one rider
to another.

Such riders usually couldn't afford to tear up a street bike racing it,
either. They just wanted to ride their bikes and fix them up
and hang out with their friends and chase women and have a good time

The &quot;outlaw biker&quot; doesn't join associations, he rides only with the other
&quot;outlaw bikers&quot; in his club.

These riders know each other, they know each other's last names and where
they live, and a member of an &quot;outlaw biker&quot; MC is considered trustworthy and
a
*brother* to the other MC members.

He got to be a brother by earning the respect and trust of the other MC
brothers and he would be welcome to stay in their homes and they would take
the shirt off their backs to help him if he needed it.

A motorcyclist who wants to join an MC gradually earns the brothers trust by
hanging out with them, following them on rides, and may be invited to become
a &quot;prospective member&quot;.

A prospect may wear a cut off levi jacket, but he doesn't get the full three-
piece patch until the members vote on whether they want him to become a
brother.

So, if you see a bunch of riders parked along the road and they are wearing
cut off levi jackets with patches, you'll know what you are seeing.

African American MC's seem to be more common than all-White MC's nowadays.

I used to always sell my bike when I bought a new one, but then I

&gt;&gt; If you're going to ride around without license plates, expect to get stopped
&gt;&gt; and have your papers checked out. if you're riding without plates, never run
&gt;&gt; from the cops, they might shoot you. If you park your bike without plates,

&gt;I meant plates off while parking on a sidewalk, plates clearly on when

Ummm... I think you're referring to what certain folks TRY to
get away with in NYC or such, parking on the sidewalk and removing the
plates in the hopes that the ticket-writing cops won't be able to
write them a ticket with having a license plate number.

Instead, they will just impound the vehicle :-)  Then you can
pay extra fines for storage, towing, having no plates, as well as
parking on the sdiewalk.

If they're all wearing the same 3-piece insignia on the back

&gt; of new-rider crashes, regardless of whether it was improper braking,
&gt; steering/looking, or cornering that *actually* caused the crash. Thank
&gt; you for affirming that.

It's certainly a major one.  I was fortunate enough to have a
very experienced rider give me some helpful hints when I was
starting out, and the very first time we rode anywhere together,
he made it very, very clear that my job was to ride MY bike,
and in no way was I to attempt to keep up with him.

There are still a lot of &quot;new-rider crashes&quot; that happen when said
new rider isn't trying to keep up with anyone, since they're out
riding around by their lonesome.  I wouldn't say that this is
unavoidable, but you've probably already been told how likely it
is that you WILL drop the bike before your first six months or
so are up.  That doesn't mean you have to resign yourself to it,
just that you need to keep in mind that it's when you START to
feel comfortable with this whole riding thing is probably when
you're the biggest danger to yourself.  Right now, for you, every
ride is likely an exercise in &quot;drinking from a fire hose&quot; - there's
a lot you're trying to keep up with through conscious effort.
It won't be very long before some of it starts to feel &quot;natural,&quot;
but that is exactly when you need to try to keep some of it
on a conscious level (to some degree), just so you won't
get into a situation of riding beyond your skill level simply
because you were no longer aware of it.

Nothing at all.  It's not the jacket that matters to anyone,
it's the insignia on it, if that insignia 'belongs' to someone else /
some other group.  Whether it's on a denim vest, leather vest, leather
jacket, or 2 strings and a strip of velcro, doesn't matter.

AFAIK, as long as it doesn't give appearance on infringing on
another club's colors / logo, that's not a problem.  You might want to
stay away from certain dominant color combinations, especially red and
white, or red and gold.

You might want to look up 'rocker panels' and 3 piece patch'
in context of MC's and clubs, etc, and stay away from that design.
There is a history to how they evolved, and what they mean.

Bwahahahah!!!!!  Hell no :-).  I don't know if they would take
the time to beat the shit out of me ( and waste 5 or 7 seconds out of
their day ), or merely wipe me off their shoes :-)

Actually, they would take one look at me, think 'citizen' (
non club kind of person ), and ignore me, unless I was making an ass
out of myself, like by trying to pretend I was hanging around with
them or something.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;trying to particularly get personal, but you do seem knowledgeable about

I've read about it, to educate myself.  IMO, that's something
you should do also.  There's ~ 10,000 designs you could choose, and if
10 of them are potentially offensive to some people - pick one of the
other 9,990.  Life is simpler that way.

AFAIK, the main thing is simply 'go on about your business,
and let them go on about theirs'.  Do not be disrespectful, do not
call them 'brother' ( a word they feel is earned, not given.  This is
a 'magic word' to them, to be avoided.  AFAIK, 'friend', or 'man' etc
is fine, but not 'brother', which is reserved, in their opinion, for
other members of their club ), and do not pretend to be a bad ass, or
to be one of them when you haven't been invited, etc.  # 1 rule would
be 'don't run your mouth'.

Really, simple common courtesy stuff - if you step on
someone's toe, say 'I'm sorry'.  If you spill a drink on someone,
apologize and offer to pay for the cleaning. Don't touch their bikes,
or their jackets / colors, without permission.  Simple shit anyone
should do with anyone else anyway, 'club' or no club - 'keep your paws
off other people's stuff'.  The magic word is 'respect'.  Don't be
making comments about people, don't be pushing people, etc etc.

And, of course - if you're in a place and the shit hits the
fan, or it looks like something you're uncomfortable with - find a
place more pleasing to you to hang out.  If your church lady is
designing your patch for you, I doubt you'll be having rides to the
local titty bars and hard-core drinking / drugging places, etc,
anyway.  And I doubt any 1 %'rs will be showing up at your socials :-)

It's a good idea to investigate which MC's are already active in whatever
area you live in. The MC's have been active since after WW2, and many
possible names are *taken*.

For instance, a group of local riders decided that they would like to call
their loose knit MC &quot;Vikings&quot; and they designed a *one piece patch*, it was
all red, except for the helmeted viking face and the words &quot;Vikings&quot;, and
&quot;Los Angeles, California&quot;.

They were standing around on Hollywood Boulevard, looking like your typical
sidewalk commandos when an independent biker came up and told them that the
&quot;Vikings&quot; weren't welcome in that territory and that they'd better get out of
there, before there was trouble.

The president of the &quot;Vikings&quot; told the guy that he must be thinking of a
different bunch of &quot;Vikings&quot;, because his club had no problems with anybody.

The independant then said that the *real* Vikings would cut their patches off,
if they were caught. The &quot;Viking&quot; president said, &quot;Well, if they want the
patch, all they have to do is ask, we're not going to fight anybody over a
patch.&quot;

Another time, they all rode down to Tucson on vacation. The Tucson police and
the sheriff stopped them and asked what their business was in Tucson and
checked their papers and found everything in order.

The sheriff final asked, &quot;What is this &quot;Vikings&quot; business? Are you guys some
kind of a *social club*?&quot;

The Viking president said, &quot;Yessir, that's what we are, a social club, yessir,
that's right, sir.&quot;

The sheriff said, &quot;Well, if you go riding into Tucson wearing those patches,
the *real* bikers may start trouble. It's better if you don't wear those
colors here.&quot;

So they took their levi cutoffs off and put them in their saddlebags to ride
to the motel where they had reservations. The sheriff also asked them when
they were leaving and the president of the Vikings said they were riding back
to Los Angeles early the next morning.

A sheriff's cruiser was in the parking lot the next morning, waiting to
escort them back out of town.

Another thing to understand is the mentality of immigrant MC clubs. For some
strange reason, immigrant MC clubs and car clubs believe that they somehow
&quot;represent&quot; the town they live in, even when they live in rented apartments
on the wrong side of the tracks, in some slum area.

The immigrant MC's actually believe that they are a force to be reckoned with,
and, if they have a patch with the name of that town on it, they are ready to
fight anybody else that moves in on what they consider to be &quot;their turf&quot;.

The traditional outlaw biker wore filthy &quot;originals&quot; that were as grey-green
and greasy as the Limpopo river and stank like sweat and piss and stale
grease. They were the biker's party clothes.

He did NOT wear his party clothes every day. He wore them on party weekends.
He wore whatever a blue collar worker wears to his day job.

If you see a rider with a brand new bright blue levi cutoff with a bunch of
run pins on it, he's just a weekend warrior that does poker runs and charity
runs or goes on &quot;classic&quot; runs that put miles on their bikes just for the
sake of riding with strangers so they will have somebody to ride with.

The real outlaw MC rider was out there on the highway on holiday weekends
going to a brawling, drink until you pass out, women swapping, gang fucking
party until you crash motorcycle run.

The poker run types won't even consider swapping women or getting drunk or
getting loaded on a Sunday morning putt, they just don't do that. They have
to get home to the wife to take her shopping.

Every once in a while, some female who has heard about how bikers like to
party will approach a group of rubs hanging out on some sidewalk and walk up
and ask a biker if she can be a &quot;mama&quot; for the club.

Such women are often disappointed and confused when the rubs are uninterested.

Back to the levi cutoff:

To show there's an exception to all rules, occasionally you will see a lone
Hells Angel wearing a clean new levi cutoff and riding a nice shiny custom
Harley, instead of riding a grungy oil-leaking chopper.

The clean jeans Hells Angel is a sort of outlaw RUB, and gawd only knows what
he'll do to try to prove himself worthy of being called &quot;outlaw&quot;, after
having *bought* the image.

Maybe that incredibly clean HA doesn't even smoke or drink or shag women.

You can be the one to ask him, I'm afeared of the three piece patch.

&gt;&gt;I'm glad to hear outlaws will tell me to &quot;move on&quot; instead
&gt;&gt;of robbing and shooting me outright.

&gt;When knowledgeble riders talk about &quot;outlaw bikers&quot;, they are not referring
&gt;&quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; on an interstate murder and robbery spree, as
&gt;Hollywood would like you to believe.

&gt;&quot;Outlaw biker&quot; refers to a rider who belongs to a motorcycle club. or &quot;MC&quot;,
&gt;as opposed to a an independent rider
&gt;such as yourself (at the moment) or a rider who belongs to an association,
&gt;such as the American Motorcyclist Association or some racing organization or
&gt;a brand-loyal club.

&gt;The American Motorcycle Association, as it was called in the 1950's
&gt;attempted to organize American riders into either road riding clubs or
&gt;competition clubs that raced in the dirt.

&gt;The road riding clubs attracted rich people and the road rides turned into
&gt;events where the best dressed rider or best dressed couple took a trophy home.
&gt;Obviously the richest riders would always win and they would run the
&gt;association and look down their noses at the poorer riders.

&gt;There were many riders who did not want to be judged upon their wealth, so
&gt;they didn't want to join an association that compared the wealth of one rider
&gt;to another.

&gt;Such riders usually couldn't afford to tear up a street bike racing it,
&gt;either. They just wanted to ride their bikes and fix them up
&gt;and hang out with their friends and chase women and have a good time

&gt;The &quot;outlaw biker&quot; doesn't join associations, he rides only with the other
&gt;&quot;outlaw bikers&quot; in his club.

&gt;These riders know each other, they know each other's last names and where
&gt;they live, and a member of an &quot;outlaw biker&quot; MC is considered trustworthy and
&gt;a
&gt;*brother* to the other MC members.

&gt;He got to be a brother by earning the respect and trust of the other MC
&gt;brothers and he would be welcome to stay in their homes and they would take
&gt;the shirt off their backs to help him if he needed it.

&gt;A motorcyclist who wants to join an MC gradually earns the brothers trust by
&gt;hanging out with them, following them on rides, and may be invited to become
&gt;a &quot;prospective member&quot;.

&gt;A prospect may wear a cut off levi jacket, but he doesn't get the full three-
&gt;piece patch until the members vote on whether they want him to become a
&gt;brother.

&gt;So, if you see a bunch of riders parked along the road and they are wearing
&gt;cut off levi jackets with patches, you'll know what you are seeing.

&gt;African American MC's seem to be more common than all-White MC's nowadays.

Ah, now it's coming to me.  Years ago, you used to go by the name here
of, &quot;Old Biker&quot;, right?

You may be discussing 'a look', I doubt anyone else is.
Everyone else is discussing membership in certain clubs.  The members
can 'look' as different from each other as any other group of guys.
