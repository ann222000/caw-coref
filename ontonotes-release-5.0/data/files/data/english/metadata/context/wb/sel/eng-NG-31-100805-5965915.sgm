Putting a label on the people like yourself is a fair and reasonable
thing to do. Putting a label on all the people who are not like yourself
is an aggressive act.

Calling yourself nudists or naturists is fine, its your group and you
are free to choose your own label. But when you label the rest of the
world that label, whatever it might be, as long as it is not simply the
addition of a negating prefix, is going to be offensive.

If homosexual people don't like the term homosexual (which is simply an
accurate description) then they are free to choose a term for
themselves. Expecting everybody else to use that word and to use it with
the same positive connotations they like to fill it with is a little
naive, but it is their choice. Taking the adjective gay and
turning it into a noun is one thing but inventing an opposite
for it is something else again. Why should an in-group get to label the
rest of the world? Surely it is up to the rest of the world to decide
their own label, just as it was right for homosexuals to be able to
identify themselves as gay it should be up to the 95% plus of the
population to choose their own label not have it chosen for them by an
uppity minority with a bee in its bonnet. Why should a noun need an
opposite? What is the opposite of dog? What is the opposite of cloud?
Most nouns don't have opposites because they don't need them. Nobody
needs a term for people who are not members of the Barrow-in-Furness
Golf Club, people who are not red-headed or for people who are not on
their way to Mecca to idolize an old meteorite.

I call myself a Bright. It means a person without superstitious beliefs.
It includes atheism but goes further than that to make it clear that I
don't believe in ghosts and spirits and the whole realm of the
supernatural. If you have similar beliefs you can choose to call
yourself a Bright. It's your choice. It is not my right to look at your
beliefs and "out" you as a Bright. That is rude. Bright is a label whose
pin only faces inwards. Not only are Brights forbidden to label other
people as Brights children are not allowed to join and anybody who is
told that they must join is ineligible to join.

http://www.the-brights.net/

Bright is, like gay, a noun created from an adjective which has positive
connotations. It immediately stirred up controversy because people
wanted it to have an opposite because they wanted to be offended by
what that opposite was. But it is a noun, why does it need an opposite?
Don't you get it? But no, they wouldn't be told that we weren't calling
them dim or dull. Eventually after a couple of years it was finally
decided that, just to shut the critics up an opposite would be declared.
That opposite is super. As in superstitious. The opposite of somebody
who lacks superstitious beliefs is, obviously, one who has one or more
superstitious belief, hence a super. Happy now? Probably not. I was much
happier with non-Bright, even though the definition was a bit of a
double negative. I don't see it is up to me or the members of any group
to label those who are not in that group. The term super while it has
the benefit of sounding equally as positive as Bright (equal but
different) is misleading and a bit of a taunt. You don't have to have
superstitious! beliefs not to be a Bright, you just have to not identify
yourself as a Bright. Perhaps it would be better to have a three way
split, those who are Brights, those whose beliefs make them ineligible
to be Brights, the supers, and those who are too young to be allowed to
choose, don't know about the choice or choose not to wear the label
that they are qualified to wear. The third category are the non-Brights.

Groups which label outsiders are arrogant. Are you happy to be called a
gentile, an infidel, a kafir, a shiksa (gentile bitch),  a textile or a
breeder?

Isn't calling somebody a textile little different to calling somebody a
nigger? Nigger is simply an amusing, informal and semi-affectionate
term applied to a group by those outside that group, is it not? The
niggers don't like being called niggers? Well, who cares what niggers
think, eh? What is the difference? Textile is an amusing term applied
to those not in the in-group, and when they are riled it is spat out
with just the same venom as the Klan spits out the word nigger or some
Islamofascists spit out the term kafir or bitchy homosexuals spit out
the term breeder. Why arm yourself with potential hatespeak? Disavow
those terms. Call people by the terms they are happy to call themselves,
and no others.

&gt; (snipped)

&gt; Hardly aggressive - anyone who feels that a using a descriptive, neutral,
&gt; word for the majority outgroup is aggressive, is, at the very least, overly
&gt; sensitive. It is simply a less clumsy way of saying non-nudist that at the
&gt; same time sidesteps the question of whether to use nudist or naturist.

&gt; Similar terms have been (and are) used throughout history, and some have
&gt; pejorative implications, some haven't - gentile, heathen, straight, pagan,
&gt; infidel, goy, anglo, barbarian, for example. In general such words only
&gt; become pejorative when they are applied to a minority by a majority rather
&gt; than the other way round.

Why have you removed very relevant groups? Your interest is a minority
interest, it is analogous to other minority interests, as I demonstrated
clearly in my post. This is my thread, if you debate with me you do it
on my terms or you talk to the hand.

Terms used by in groups of the out group are not always simply neutral
and descriptive. Why is there any need for a word to describe people who
are not nudists? Do vegans have a word for people who are not vegan? No,
because they are not a group, they are not organized, they are not
coherent, they have no common agenda or common mindset and they are much
better described as simply non-vegans. So are non-nudists.

There are lots of reasons not to be a nudist which range from apathy to
Puritanism to ignorance and cowardice to hating the attitudes of those
nudists that they are aware of. Lumping together the shy with the
sufferer of priapism or gynecomastia or obesity with the prudes with the
apathetic or those with dyslexic tattoos is meaningless. Because they
are not a group a label is particularly inappropriate especially as it
is only ever used as either a taunt disguised as a joke or a direct insult.

I do not know.  What is a textile?  By my definition anyone who had
sex where both partners are nude is a nudist.  According to the 2004
ABC sex survey, 15% of US men have paid for sex an average of $500 --
as the street prostitution makes up under 10% of the trade.

I would define a textile as

a) A virgin over the age of 30.
b) Someone who noly had sex with clothes on and has never been to a
nude beach or club.

In USA that would be a small minority.  By the age of 30, according to
surveys, 99.2% of men and 99% of women did have sex.  According to
Albert Kinsy in 1950, 92% of couples had sex with clothes off.  Now
that percentage is much higher.  So overall, just 2% of population are
textiles.

Like you, I'm an agnostic. In the minds of some people, "agnostic" is a
pejorative term. In the minds of other people, like me, it is not. I
think I'd be overly sensitive if I felt offended by being called an
agnostic. Similarly, I feel that anyone who is being offended by being
called a "textile" is being overly sensitive. For me, the term
"textile", in the present context, means "someone who is opposed to the
practice of nudism on moral grounds", "someone who thinks that the
practice of social nudity is shameful". If you'd prefer the term
"anti-nudist" to designate such folks, that's fine with me.

Chill out, friend.

Best wishes,
Bert

Anti-nudist is a good term, there are nudists, anti-nudists and people
who are neither. Textile is just a silly taunt that is too easily used
as an insult intended to hurt.

I am not an anti-nudist, I support nudists doing their own thing in
appropriate places, I just am not one myself and as I know that most
people are not wanting to make the whole world nude I don't support any
idea of changing the default assumption that clothes should be worn
except where exceptions are made. Why should that cause nudists to
attack me, hound me and use their "innocuous" label exactly as if it had
all the sting of a word such as fascist or nigger?

Agnostic is a term invented by an agnostic and chosen as a label by
agnostics. That makes it very different to textile, which was invented
by an in-group as a label for the out-group. It probably started as
light-hearted but just look around, it is used as a taunt and an insult
by nudists.

In Britain many people choose to be called naturists rather than
nudists, as they see the term nudist has got unacceptable baggage. It's
their group, their choice. It is not up to anybody else to say that they
are really nudists. Similarly it is not up to nudists to label those who
are not nudists, or for gay people to call those who are not gay "breeders".

How do you feel about being called:

A breeder?

A goyim?

A Gorjer (non-Gypsy)

A mental couch potato? http://mwillett.org/atheism/agnostic.htm

Meat? (literal translation of the name given by some New Guineans for
anybody who isn't a member of their particular tribe)

It is my thread in as much as I started it. If people want to debate
with me they can do so, but they don't get to choose the terms.

If you cut a group from your replies you are changing the game. You
can't go changing the game half way through and then claiming that
you've won. Unless your name is William Webb Ellis.

I stated that if people want to debate with me on this thread they do it
my way or they can talk to the hand, i.e. I will ignore them. Of course
anybody can reply to the posts already made, I have just pointed out
that if you go trying to take your ball and play just in one group then
you can play by yourself. I have set this thread up in such a way that
everybody is in a minority and nobody can count on a baying pack of
hounds behind them.

I will do all I can to maintain the thread across all the groups so as
to ensure that everybody has to be reasonable because they don't have
home court advantage and they don't have any right to expect that their
view is shared by the majority of the people reading the thread. In fact
nobody knows how many people will read the thread, who they might be or
what their history is. I am not in the lion's den any longer, there are
dangerous and unfamiliar beasts of all shapes and sizes here. Nobody is
safe.

You're not in Kansas any more.

It's part of the disease. Narcissistic patients try to sustain an
image of perfection and personal invincibility for themselves and
attempt to project that impression to others as well. Those with
narcissistic personality disorder project an inflated sense of self
because underneath that image of grandiosity is really an insecure
person with very low self-esteem. The grandiose image is a way to
protect themselves from fearing that others will find out that they
have weaknesses and imperfections just like everyone else.

This one is hooked by his own hand, and therefor unable to disengage.
If ignored, he'll talk to himself or spam other groups to get the
reinforcement he so desperately craves.
