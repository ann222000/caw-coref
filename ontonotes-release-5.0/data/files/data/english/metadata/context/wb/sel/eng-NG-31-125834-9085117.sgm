Charley Uchea has been boasting about all the showbiz projects she has
in the pipeline following her stint in Big Brother.

The 22-year-old south London 'It Girl' said she might have her own TV
show and a single released and she would 'definitely' go on Celebrity
Big Brother.

&quot;I might have my own TV show coming up hopefully if everything goes
right, you know, and also just to do a bit of TV presenting and stuff,&quot;
she gushed. &quot;There's so many different things coming up. A bit of
modelling, a bit of acting, I'll try a bit of both.&quot;

When asked about any plans for a musical career, Charley said: &quot;Maybe,
we're talking about it, maybe yeah. Hopefully I might have a single out
soon but my voice isn't that great but you never know do you?&quot;

Charley also explained the ongoing feud between her and Posh Spice
wannabe Chanelle Hayes, who recently said she was 'too scared' to
attend the Big Brother wrap party because of her nemesis.

&quot;We just don't get on, she hates me. I don't hate her, I just dislike
her,&quot; she said.

Who knows Flopsy but isn't it ridiculous that somebody as nasty and
pig-ignorant as her is made into a TV personality. No wonder this
country is going to the dogs if young kids see her type getting on for
behaving so badly.
She should be made an example of instead, like that awful thing on the
X-Factor last night.

It's not a get-out clause, it's a fact. The further you are away from
the exchange they slower speed you'll get. That's always been the case.

Although beneath the streets of Paris two companies, France Telecom's
Orange and Free, are laying down fibre-optic cables to bring speeds of
up to 100Mbps to homes. But &quot;Fibre-to-the-home&quot;, as it is known, is
viewed as far too expensive a solution in the UK.

Well, we're almost sitting on our exchange.....where's there excuse
there then? So I'm paying through the nose to get a service UP TO 8 meg
when there are people on the lower package, paying less and getting
higher speeds than me.

&gt;&gt; Exactley. She now thinks she's a celebrity and wants to be on CBB. Get a
&gt;&gt; job Charley and a bit of self respect.

&gt; I laughed out loud when I read that she would 'definitely' go on CBB.
&gt; Gosh, she's so up her own backside.  :-)

&gt;&gt; Yeah...the famous get out clause.....*up to* 8 meg. :-(

&gt;It's not a get-out clause, it's a fact. The further you are away from
&gt;the exchange they slower speed you'll get. That's always been the case.

&gt;Although beneath the streets of Paris two companies, France Telecom's
&gt;Orange and Free, are laying down fibre-optic cables to bring speeds of
&gt;up to 100Mbps to homes. But &quot;Fibre-to-the-home&quot;, as it is known, is
&gt;viewed as far too expensive a solution in the UK.

More like the thing she is furious about is losing her CBB pay.
