A Modest Proposal for Waterboarding Judge Michael Mukasey

By Jaime O'Neill
Created Nov 8 2007 - 9:35am

President Bush's nominee to be the new Attorney General is a judge who seems
to have a hard time forming judgments. He can't, for instance, quite make up
his mind whether or not he thinks waterboarding is torture, something many
civilized people would consider a no-brainer.

For those who may confuse the word waterboarding with something you do at
the seashore during summer vacation, a definition may be in order.
Waterboarding is a minor variation of interviewing techniques used primarily
in cases where you have a prisoner or prisoners from whom you are trying to
extract information. In order to accomplish that objective, you decide to
put said detainees on slant boards and then simulate drowning them by
forcing water down their throats and up their noses, an exercise that
creates panic and fear of death in the detainee. At no time do you tell them
you're just kidding because that would ruin the suspense. Other than the
terror and the choking, it is thought by some to be little more than the
sort of thing frat boys do to one another during hazing exercises.

Which may be why Judge Mukasey, the aforementioned Bush nominee to become
Attorney General, just can't make up his mind whether or not such a practice
might constitute torture. So, in an attempt to help the dithering judge
arrive at a conclusion--any conclusion--it is hereby proposed that the
judicial oversight committee waterboard Judge Mukasey as a way of getting an
opinion on the matter from the man who seeks a job where rendering opinions
is a top job spec.

Waterboarding, it's been claimed, has a rare capacity to clarify the mind,
and it's fairly certain that were he to be waterboarded, Judge Mukasey could
and would come up with an opinion on the practice, an opinion that has, thus
far, eluded him, It matters little that the opinion Mukasey renders under
the influence of superhydration would likely be any opinion he thought his
interrogators wanted to hear. At least it would constitute a judgment on the
subject, along with a demonstrated willingness to be cooperative when he's
being asked a civil and simple question.

It's amazing how a little thing like fear of imminent drowning can increase
one's desire to please others. People who have been waterboarded show an
appealing willingness to tell other people just about anything they think
will make their waterboarders happy, and isn't making other people happy a
good thing, no matter the motive that produces the happiness?

The happiness by-product of waterboarding notwithstanding, there are certain
to be some among us who will object to the very notion of pouring water down
the gullets of blindfolded candidates for high government office. There are
always the overly-sensitive types who will argue that such practices might
border on the inhumane, rude, or unkind. Some might even argue that the drip
method of Senate confirmation would be a violation of bedrock American
values. But think for a moment of the message it would send to the world at
large if we were to use the practice on our own officials that is causing so
much moral handwringing throughout the world when we use it on our suspected
enemies. By waterboarding nominees for top government posts, we could
demonstrate our conviction that we, as a nation, sincerely find that
waterboarding isn't so bad, and we're so sure it isn't that we're willing to
use the technique as part of the process of affirming the nominations of our
own cabinet officers. Once such a precedent was established, it's almost
certain that the whining from the international community~those nanny-minded
and self-appointed guardians of moral behavior~would, at long last, shut the
hell up, their high dudgeon sunk low by our nation's willingness to apply
the same conduct to our Attorney General designee as we are to suspected
terrorists.

And, since it appears that support for waterboarding has become bi-partisan,
with Democratic Party watchdogs like Senators Chuck Schumer and Diane
Feinstein willing to sign off on the appointment of Judge Mike Mukasey, it
seems only appropriate that the two worthy Senators administer the
waterboarding to Mukasey personally, inasmuch as they have shown themselves
capable of countenancing his fuzzy attitudes about the practice.

Surely, such a proposal carries more advantages than disadvantages, and is
likely to do far more good than harm.
