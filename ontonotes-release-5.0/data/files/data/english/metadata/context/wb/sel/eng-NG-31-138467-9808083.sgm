Dear friends and devotees,

Bhakti is eternal.

I happened to see the following questions from one brother devotee, in one
of the Yahoo Groups.  Even though, I contributed a little along with others,
I want to share with you all the full details in this regard.

Questions asked by the devotee!

&quot;How can we avert or stop a disaster, accident which we see in
our dream?
Also
1) how to analyse these dreams with the real life.
2) how to track with whom is this incident going to happen.&quot;

My analysis:

Though the initial question appears to be very small, its significance is
superior and appealing.  The answer should be of fact-based.

I am neither an astrologer nor a spiritual leader.  I am a retired
physician.  By the grace of God, I had the blessings of His Holiness
Paramacharya and heard many devotional secrets.  I have, therefore, decided
to spend some time on spiritual matters and Sanatana dharma, in addition to
my service to patients, which made me to join the devotional groups.  That
is the reason that I have been interfering in some clarifications, with the
knowledge acquired from the great Guru. I would prefer to sit in the desk as
a student rather than in a chair of a teacher.  Yet, the questions of the
devotee are more valuable and any clarification should help our entire
society.

Keeping all in view, I felt that the matter has to be explicitly clarified.
I am therefore giving some elaborate details regarding dreams on medical,
practical and even spiritual point of view.

Dreams are the images, thoughts and feelings experienced while asleep,
particularly strongly associated with rapid eye movement sleep (REM). The
contents and purpose of dreams are poorly understood, though they have been
a topic of speculation and interest throughout recorded history

There is a biological definition of dreaming. General observation shows that
dreams are strongly associated with rapid eye movement sleep, during which
an electroencephalogram shows brain activity to be most like wakefulness.

When the body decides that it is time to sleep, neurons near the eyes begin
to send signals throughout the body. These neurons are located in such close
proximity to neurons that control eyelid muscles that the eyelids begin to
grow heavy. Glands begin to secrete a hormone that helps induce sleep and
neurons send signals to the spinal cord which cause the body to relax.

There are many hypotheses about the function of dreams. During the night
there may be many external stimuli bombarding the senses, but the mind
interprets the stimulus and makes it a part of a dream in order to ensure
continued sleep.

Dreams have a long history both as a subject of conjecture and as a source
of inspiration. Throughout their history, people have sought meaning in
dreams or divination through dreams. They have been described
physiologically as a response to neural processes during sleep,
psychologically as reflections of the subconscious, and spiritually as
messages from God or predictions of the future. Many cultures practiced
dream incubation, with the intention of cultivating dreams that were
prophetic or contained messages from the divine.

The most common emotion experienced in dreams is anxiety. Negative emotions
are more common than positive feelings

Content-analysis studies have identified common reported themes in dreams.
These include: situations relating to school, being chased, running
slowly/in place, sexual experiences, falling, arriving too late, a person
now alive being dead, teeth falling out, flying, embarrassing moments,
failing an examination, or a car accident. Twelve percent of people dream
only in black and white

Dreams of absent-minded transgression (DAMT) are dreams wherein the dreamer
absentmindedly performs an action that he or she has been trying to stop
(one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a
cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have reported waking with intense
feelings of guilt. One study found a positive association between
successfully stopping the behavior

Dreams can link to actual sensations, such as the incorporation of
environmental sounds into dreams, or dreaming of urination while wetting the
bed. Some philosophers have extended this idea to a skeptical hypothesis
about ontology.

The recall of dreams is extremely unreliable, though it is a skill that can
be trained. Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by
relatively little affect, and factors such as salience, arousal, and
interference play a role in dream recall.

According to a recent medical theory one passes in sleep through many phases
until one arrives at a state in which there is absolute rest and silence,
which lasts only for ten minutes, the rest of the time is taken up by
travelling to that and travelling back again to the waking state. The ten
minutes sleep can be called &quot;Sushupti&quot; in the Brahman of Brahmaloka, the
rest is &quot;Svapna&quot; (dream) or passage through other worlds (planes or states
of conscious existence). It is these ten minutes that restore the energies
of the being, and without it, sleep is not refreshing.

People's ideas of sound sleep are absolutely erroneous. What they call sound
sleep is merely a plunge of the outer consciousness into a complete
subconscious. They call that a dreamless sleep; but it is only a state in
which the surface sleep consciousness which is a subtle prolongation of the
outer still left active in sleep itself is unable to record the dreams and
transmit them to the physical mind. As a matter of fact the whole sleep is
full of dreams. It is only during the brief time in which one is in the
Brahmaloka that the dreams cease.

The dreams are strongly associated with rapid eye movement sleep and nothing
but hallucination, in the medical point of view.  But it is natural that one
will become despair psychologically. How can we avert or stop a disaster,
accident which we see in our dream?  The main remedy is meditation and
Bhakti.  Any bad or good is in accordance with the Karma as per our Hindu
mythology and at the same time one can overcome bad by praying God.

If one is destined to get poisoned by a snake at a particular time, he/she
cannot elude and has to undergo.  But in case, he/she sits at that time
praying Lord Siva in a Temple, the snake cannot enter in the midst of all.
Then what about the destiny?  Then also he/she gets poisoned by a small
scorpion bite which can be cured by an ordinary physician. It does not mean
that one should always sit in the temple.  It would only emphasize that
Bhakti on God is the ultimate, even to overcome the preordained bad or
torment. Why bad, anguish. disaster or accident?  Even death!  The example
is our Markandeya Purana.

Please therefore ignore the dreams and think them as night-mare.  Come out
of them and live happily.

With love and regards,

Sastry.
