Defending the "Bored Mom"
October 14, 2006
Vox Populi
By Denise Noe

Helen Kirwan-Taylor, an American expatriate living in Great Britain,
caused quite a stir when she published "Sorry, but my children bore
me to death." In this essay, she revealed that she finds many aspects
of caring for her children dull. She dislikes driving them from place
to place. She admits that she has made up excuses to avoid appearing at
parent (or perhaps specifically mother) and child activities when she
was actually shopping or having highlights put in her hair. She further
confesses that when she went with Ivan, 10, and Constantin, 12, to see
Pirates of the Caribbean, she spent most of the movie text-messaging
her friends.

Indeed, when Ivan and Constantin were very small, Kirwan-Taylor became
a workaholic largely to be away from the kids.

As one might expect, this article occasioned a flurry of outrage and
indignation. Many found it gaspingly horrible that someone - at least
if that someone is a mother - could describe any aspect of caring for
kids as "boring."

This brouhaha brings home the ancient truth of the extraordinary
variation in individual taste. I have no children but I checked a copy
of Pirates of the Caribbean out of the library, watched it, and enjoyed
it. However, the movie is largely made up of dramatic fight scenes and
special effects. It is a film oriented toward children. I can easily
see how many of my fellow grown-ups would not want to watch it.
Shopping is an activity that utterly bores me. While Kirwan-Taylor
dislikes going on field trips to museums, I'd take the museum over
the hairdresser's any day of the week.

It also reminds me of how an activity may be differently perceived by
differently situated people. Kirwan-Taylor finds it tedious to drive
her children around. In Saudi Arabia, where women are forbidden to
drive and this task automatically falls to men, many women would
consider performing it a sign of liberation.

However, Helen Kirwan-Taylor is a mother and it appears utterly
verborten for a mom to admit she finds any aspect of childcare dull.

Dad in this intact family does not appear to be a Mr. Mom or Superdad
type. Kirwan-Taylor never mentions him directly but speaks of
"fathers legging it to the pub to avoid being around when nappies
(diapers) are changed."

If mothers are honest, they should be able to admit that, however much
they love their children, kids can be aggravating and exhausting. In
colloquial terms, their noise and demands can drive anyone temporarily
"nuts." It ought to be acceptable for a mom to admit she finds some
aspects of childcare boring.

The controversy over Kirwan-Taylor's revelation reminds me of an
essay I read decades ago by a young mother faced with the opposite
problem. She was a feminist and held a responsible position in her work
outside the home. She planned to have her baby and go right back to her
outside job and that is what she did at first. As it happens, she was
not concerned about her baby's welfare and confident that the
childcare arrangements she had made were good. The problem she faced
was that she simply missed the baby terribly during the time she was
away from it. For her own happiness, she gave up her paid job for
fulltime homemaking so she could be with her child constantly.

While this young woman and Kirwan-Taylor are opposites in the amount of
time they wanted to be with their children, they are similar in
rejecting one version or another of political correctness in favor of
being true to themselves.

Some critics have suggested that Kirwan-Taylor should not have had
children if many child-connected tasks bore her. That seems misguided.
She appears to love her kids. She is proud of them, describing little
Ivan and Constantin as "creative and clever." Of course, it is
possible that Ivan or Constantin will one day shoot up their schools or
end up on the police blotter for some horrible crime or become mentally
ill. However, it seems to this writer also quite possible that these
are two well-adjusted boys, "clever and creative" as their mom
claims, and the world is not poorer for their existence.

The fact that a mother is not fascinated by every single aspect of
childcare does not mean that she should have remained childless. For
one thing, it is quite possible for people to do things that are boring
to them - and do them well. However, that Helen Kirwan-Taylor is so
frequently bored by childcare probably does mean that she should not be
with her kids 24/7 - which she is not. Like the vast majority of dads
and a large number of moms, she outsources many aspects of childcare.

Since her article focuses on herself, her feelings, and her children,
it unfortunately gives short shrift to someone very important and that
is the person or people who do much of the childcare for Ivan and
Constantin. As in most families that employ nannies, the one here is a
woman. Male nannies exist and are sometimes called "mannies" or
"childminders" but this may be a field in which discrimination
against men is rampant. The type of person that nanny is will be a
major determinant of how the boys turn out so I hope she is
psychologically healthy and more approximates Julie Andrews in Mary
Poppins than Bette Davis in The Nanny or the homicidal Louise Woodward
in real life.

Constantin, at least, appears to view his mother's feelings
realistically. He has gone on talk shows to defend his mother. He
realizes that he and the mom he loves and who loves him can find
different sorts of activities fascinating. He has stated, "Most of
the time she's on the computer, which I find incredibly boring. And
stuff like going on a school run (driving kids to school), I can see
her point of view that that would be incredibly boring."
Significantly, as he is maturing, he and his mother are finding more
interests in common among them listening to books on tape and jogging.
He also has picked up some of his mother's unabashed honesty - and
undoubtedly speaks for many other children - when he states, "Moms
are boring, too."
