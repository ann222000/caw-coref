I'm going to try to go on Friday for a few hours.  My original hip
replacement is coming undone and is being re-replaced on 5/9, so it
depends on how well I'm able to walk by then.... if at all.  :-(

OH no!  That's not good news!  I hope you're able to hobble over for a day,
and then run around all of it next year!  But whatever you do....my thoughts
and best wishes are with your for your surgery.

Ohhh that's a good stay Maureen!  You should get everything looked at a
couple times!  Are you taking classes?  Which ones?  I know it seems like a
long time....but it goes very very fast!  Especially if you take classes.  I
have one full day class and two half day ones.  It does make for a busy
time.

I'm taking two classes from Linda Taylor..."So you think you want to be a
longarm quilter" and "longarm freehand for beginners"
http://www.americanquilter.com/shows_contests/paducah/2007/pdf/finish...
No, I'm not thinking of buying a longarm.  But one of our local shops is
going to move to a new building and she will have several longarms for rent.
I thought this might be a good way to get started.  After all, we ALL know I
have a lot of tops to finish!  And I also thought some of the techniques
might translate to my home machine.  I've taken numerous maching quilting
classes.....I'm waiting for ONE of them to work!!!!

The other class is from Sharon Schamber....a machine applique class, "Cotton
boll applique".
http://www.americanquilter.com/shows_contests/paducah/2007/pdf/appliq...
I'm beginning to second guess that one.  It appears it could be similar to
the ovals I just made.  With the extensive class supply list, I have a
feeling it's going to be pretty detailed.  We'll see.  She might be a lot
more Type A than I am!  We are supposed to bring reds for the flowers,
greens for the leaves and brown for the stems...I might make mine hot pinks,
lime green and dark purple!  This is an 8:30 am -4pm class......I start
getting the heebie jeebies about 2-3 pm.  I've been known to pack up and
leave early just so I don't scream.  I swore I wouldn't take any more all
day classes, but I wanted to take a class from her.  A weak moment.  I pick
up techniques pretty quickly....I don't really need to make the entire
project in a class.  I hope I have to come back and say it was great and I
wanted to stay longer!

It's going to be interesting as this year the show is providing machines for
everyone in the workshops.  It would certainly be a lot easier to not schlep
my machine back and forth, and it will keep the classrooms a lot tidier, but
I wonder how hard it will be to work with a machine that's not mine.  I also
can't imagine how the long arm classes are going to work out.  First time
for everything!  It will be really nice to avoid that pile up of people
pulling their machines to the class area.  There is one small elevator for
everyone...machine toters and those who have to use a wheelchair.  It can
get congested and tempers run short.  I hope this helps.

If you ever make a return trip Jeanne, there is a big show in Chicago in
early April and then the AQS show is in late April.  The Chicago show is an
offshoot from the Houston show....same organizers.  I popped over there last
year for a day.   From my point of view, it would be nice  to separate those
shows more!  But they have their reasons, I'm sure.

Yes, taking classes too.  I can't recall off hand right now which ones, I'd
have to go downstairs and dig out my list.  But most are in the evening after
the show closes.

I'll be at work a grand total of five days in April.  1st we're in Jamaica.
I get home and spend a couple of days at work putting out fires, then off to
Paducah.  Can't wait.
