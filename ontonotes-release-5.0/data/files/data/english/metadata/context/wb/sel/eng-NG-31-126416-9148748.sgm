I really like the shadowing that this web site is using behind the
images.  I have tried to dig through their code to figure out how they
did it, but it still eludes me.  How do they do it?

With Firefox and the Web Developer Add-on, I quickly determined (by
looking at the indivual images on the page) that the shadows are bits of
graphic which get put together (added as bg images, via the magic of JS)
around the &quot;actual&quot; images (the photos) to give the appearance of white
frames with shadows all around.

See http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/img/fineart-white/border-rb.gif ,

It is a javascript driven site... A lovely example of how not to
make a site degrade well. You basically get nothing at all with
js off.

Anyway, about the shadow... you can do all this stuff easily in
an image program. most even have built in actions/commands and
options if you do not want to actually draw them up yourself with
original tools. And for good measure, let me say that if there is
a way to do this in JS or HTML or CSS or some clever combo, it is
sure not to be reliable and good.

FYI, you don't need the Web Developer extension just to get to all the
images on a page. Just View-&gt;Page Info (CTRL+I in Seamonkey) and they'll
all be there on the Media tab.

Actually, that is the objective of this given site.  It is a feature
of the site that I personally.  One of my side businesses is that of a
high school senior portrait photographer and I use this site to post
proofs for my seniors.  Most seniors don't know how to get around the
comples JS to download the images.  But generally speaking, I agree
with you.
