The 65816 thread has shown me that a couple of Apple II aficionados
are working in the Semicon Business.

I am just curious to see how many and in which field.

For myself I am in the business for 15+ years as a design engineer for
CMOS and BICMOS (occasionally Bipolar) processes.

I am specialized on electrostatic discharge phenomena and Latch Up
prevention. A.k.a. ESD Wizzard :-)

Worked with process nodes from 3um down to 0.12 um (briefly touched
65nm)

What has all this to do with the Apple II? Nothing, I could never make
any use of our mighty Apple II.

If someone has Spice running on a Apple II  please let me know, I will
have my IIc dragged in the office and up and running in no time.:-)

I read on one of the Apple II history sides that Cray-Computers have
used Apple II to design their machines.
Any information about this? Is there any Layout (CAD) Software
available? (Would be a very big surprise to me as the amount of design
data should bust even a full blown IIgs)

Anyhow, I hope I get some replies

Wolfgang

I'm an engineer with Big Blue's EDA group in Burlington, VT.  Prior to this, I
spent ten years writing software duct-tape for our ASIC library developers.

The work is interesting, but if I told you much more than that I'd have to
kill you &lt;g&gt;.  Seriously, it's not my job to know what's cleared for public
consumption and what's not, so best to err on the side of caution and stay
away from specifics.

That was from Seymour Cray himself!  Upon hearing that Apple was
buying a Cray to help design their machines, he said, &quot;Funny, I am
using an Apple to simulate the CRAY-3.&quot;

I suspect that he was talking about the high-level design, involving
the balance of various &quot;speeds and feeds&quot; and not EDA tools.  ;-)

Dang, I don't have any cool &quot;I used an Apple II to design GPUs&quot; story
but when I worked at Compaq in the late 80's, Randy Spurlock, the author
of one of the first Apple II emulators for the PC, worked a couple of
office doors down.  I would find him working on it in the middle of the
day.  I don't think he works there anymore :-)

As a side note to Michael, I heard from one of my old coworkers from
Compaq (not Randy) who is now an HP fellow.  Hmmmm.  I definitely didn't
see that in his future.

That sounds nice, do you have a picture of it?

Thinking about Apple II for simulation or layout work was a
stretch :-)
But the idea of having spice running got me somehow.
I checked the web for early spice implementations but could not find
any usefull source code.
I had a simple spice running on my HP48sx, maybe I should dig for the
source and try to port it to the Apple.

Spice is an &quot;analog&quot; simulator and makes very heavy use of floating-
point, so both speed and RAM space would be major issues running on
an Apple II.

You could do small problems, like the ones in books about
learning to use Spice.  Sometimes for real problems one only
needs to run Spice on a small part.

I haven't looked to see how big it is, though.
You might want more than 64K of (bank switched) RAM to
use it.

There was something that purported to be a CP/M overlay linker/manager. I do
not remember the name, but Elliam Associates had it listed in their catalog.
Not sure if the linker or the vendor are still around (or, indeed, if it was
other than vaporware).

If you can run on a Hitachi HD64180 / Zilog Z180, Turbo Modula-2 180 supported
overlaid MCODE modules.  Data was limited to available room in the main 64k
bank, but code space was bounded only by available memory.  I actually wrote a
moderately serious control application that leveraged this feature.  Problem
for Apple 2 users is simple, the only Z180 based coprocessor was the CardZ180
project I worked on.  We sold a whopping total of 15 units or so.

Several Apple2 compilers support overlays. Aztec C and HyperC come to
mind. Capabilities of each vary. The 2 C systems are K&amp;R but both can
support floating point math with the proper files. IIRC, HyperC supports
Apple SANE.

Other systems can use a chain file method with shared variables. ZBasic
(64 &amp; 128k), Kyan Pascal and possibly others.

ZBasic has excellent FP but it has a large runtime package. This may not
be a problem with the 128k version. Plus, it's legally free to use and
doc's are available.

Kyan Pascal as available online offers an optimizing feature which might
improve memory and speed requirements. There was a 128k option provided
by Kyan but I can't locate this item.

Micol Advanced BASIC might also work for you but I don't know it's
feature set too well, yet. It requires 128k and a 65C02 based II.

I totally agree. We allways try a simulation of the whole device but
this can take several days on our mashines.
For the most times I am only intrested in a handfull of elements .

I found a spice2g6 Fortran source code. 530k size. The biniary will
hopefully much smaller.
Maybe I can compile it on a IIGS? Is there a Fortran compiler
availiable?

After glancing through the source code I gave up hope to get it
running on any Apple II.
The program will consume most of the memory and there will be no room
left for calculations.
Just by looking how they build up  a memory matrix to hold the values
you can see that the Apple can not handle it.

Maybe a stripped down version for simple RC networks will do but just
a simple transistor array will cause trouble.

By diggin arround here in TI I found a PSPICE from MicroSim
Corporation with Manual and Floppies dated 1987.

&gt; as my Apple IIc!
">

Your memory was quite good!  In fact, I remember this, too.  ;-)

But in my book, this doesn't qualify as FP C, because it doesn't have
any real FP syntax, just function calls to an external FP library.

While this makes it *possible* to write HyperC programs with some FP,
it certainly doesn't make it easy--or even approximately syntax-
compatible with anything.

If function calls are the only syntax supported, then I guess we
could also have a HyperC suporting Roman Numeral representation.  ;-)

Sadly, these are the only choices available in C on the 8 bit II. Orca
offers more features at the cost of requiring a GS. At least the
functionality is available, it just means that porting the code would be
difficult.

It's a shame that HyperC source isn't available--this would be a

This would be a great find. I recall years ago reading that someone had
this but hadn't uploaded it anywhere. After that, I never found any
mention of this again. I would also like to find the source for it's
CDOS shell/OS version, curiosity mostly.

I'm sure that with work and determination, it could be reverse
engineered but with the mixed 6502 and internal byte code it would
certainly be a large task. I expect it would require several dedicated
individuals at least. Still, there is an exceptional amount of
documentation available including how the assemblers function and even a
simple optimizer.

Any ideas, interested parties?

One addition I would like to see would be a 128k version.

I might have the source on my hard drive somewhere...  I remember a
few years back someone told me that they had it, and I requested it
via email.  I don't think I ever opened it up to see if it was
actually the source.

I agree--that is at least as important as FP in my book...
