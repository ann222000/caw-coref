The following is an account of my time at Wat Thamkrabok and the reasons I
ended up there.  I have changed the names and details of the other patients
at Wat Thamkrabok in order to protect their identities and to avoid
embarrassment.

JOURNEY TO WAT THAMKRABOK

I had left Mai Sot at nine that morning and the trip to Wat Thamkrabok
lasted about seven hours on my Honda Wave.  A journey of that length would
normally have taken me a lot more time, due to regular stops for beer, but
that day was an exception.

The beer stops occurred due to two reasons; the first was that I enjoyed
riding my motorbike in an alcohol induced semi-haze but the most important
one was that I was a habitual drunk.  That day I felt like I had a huge
excuse to get drunk but physically felt unable, although a large part of me
was screaming out for it.  I had already tried back at my Mai Sot hotel as
soon as I awoke but I just couldn't keep the beer down.  As soon as it hit
my throat I retched. This was a huge disappointment for me as I had wanted a
last bash at the sauce before swearing off it forever.

The plan was to get as drunk as needed before midday and then stop, I would
have the rest of the trip to the temple to sober up a bit and give a good
first impression.  It never occurred to me that the fact that I was
admitting myself for detox probably told them everything they needed to know
about me.  But I was also terrified of them not admitting me although I did
consider spending the night on the beer in Lampang and checking in the next
day but the patient's of my girlfriend was wearing thin and I was genuinely
afraid that another night on the beer would kill me.

If I was to say that I got sober for my girlfriend I would be lying. Her
disapproval certainly didn't make things easy and I hated letting her down
but this wasn't enough of a reason for me to stop.  If I am brutally honest,
the truth is that if it had been a choice of the joys of intoxication or her
she would have ended up dropped like a shot.  She wouldn't have been the
first either.  I have been lucky enough to have had some amazing women in my
life and there isn't one I regret being with.  What they saw in me I have no
idea but I always managed to mess things up eventually.  I was devoted to
alcohol and everything else was secondary.

I suppose that was the main reason for me wanting to quit this time was that
I physically felt unable to continue.  It felt like my liver was screaming
out to me.  I had been told a few years previously, after a blood test, that
my liver function was compromised but I continued to drink none the less,
only now with the added guilt that I was slowly killing myself.

I was in Ireland at the time and needed a medical for a job in Saudi.  The
blood results came back showing elevated liver function results.  The doctor
wanted to send me straight away to a liver specialist but I convinced her to
redo the test.  I told her that I had just come back from Koh Samui and had
been drinking particularly hard.

I felt devastated.  I had previously cared for patients in liver failure and
it is not something that I would wish on anybody. I felt like the thing that
scared me the most was not just that my life could be in danger but that my
drinking had been given a death sentence.  I left the doctor's surgery and
hit a nearby bar.  My immediate worry was that I wouldn't be able to take
the nursing job in Saudi and that I would be stuck unemployed in Ireland
with a dodgy liver.  Although there is a big demand in Ireland for nurses I
wasn't registered there and didn't particularly want to be.

I saw my future in Saudi where I planned to get off the alcohol and make
tons of money so that I could spend years travelling before settling
somewhere exotic, most likely Thailand.  This plan was now being jeopardized
and I didn't like it one bit.  I already had an idea that the new blood test
would also be disastrous as I had continued drinking heavily since my return
to Dublin.

It turned out I was right.  The next lot was even higher but I convinced the
doctor to complete my medical form.  She noted down the LFT results on the
form and her recommendation that I see a liver specialist.  I rang the
agency and was delighted to be told that this would not be a problem and
that I was on my way to the Magic Kingdom. The night before my departure I
celebrated by getting drunk knowing that my drinking problems would be over
once I hit Saudi.

A further four years of damage had accumulated before the trip to Wat
Thamkrabok.  The last few years in Thailand was spent mostly drunk so I was
fairly sure my liver was a lost cause.  I had avoided blood tests since and
ignored the more or less constant abdominal pain.  This however was not
enough to stop me drinking; it was the fact that when I ingested alcohol I
vomited it back up.  A good day for me was when I could get a few beers down
me.  If I could get past two big bottles I would escape the vomit and I
could happily get pissed but there was no way this was happening on that
trip to the temple.

Nevertheless I spent the whole trip looking out for bars but somehow managed
to make it past them all and arrived at Wat Thamkrabok.

WELCOME TO WAT THAMKRABOK

I can't remember exactly the type of reception I was expecting at the temple
but it certainly didn't turn out as I imagined.  I suppose it is common
among most drunks and druggies that our mind constantly fluctuates between
us thinking we are the lowest of the low to believing that the universe
revolves around us.

This was a big day for me and I was expecting a hero's welcome.  I failed to
realize that I was just another lost soul among many and my arrival was no
big deal.  I suppose the only thing different was that I had been crazy
enough to go there by a glorified scooter from Phitsanulok via Mai Sot but
I'm sure they were beyond being amazed by the antics of the likes of me.

The temple seemed to cover a huge area but it looked deserted as I rode
around on my motorbike.  There were many empty buildings and it actually
felt a bit spooky.  I eventually saw some monks who gave me directions to a
reception area.

I had an interview with a Swiss monk who patiently listened to my story.  He
had a really healthy glow about him which is so often missing from the
people I would normally associate with in bars.  He also seemed very kind
and serene and listened to my story without any signs of judgement.

I felt that I needed to convince the Swiss monk of my sincerity to quit the
booze but this was hardly needed.  The interview was more of an orientation
and I'm pretty sure they would never turn anyone away.  I listened as he
told me about the temple routine but I wasn't taking much in as I was
suffering the affects of alcohol withdrawal.

This wasn't my first time entering a treatment facility but instead part of
a long treatment history which began when I was twenty.  My first appearance
in one was in Dublin in 1990 where I attended, as an out-patient, a day
service which catered for alcoholics, druggies, schizophrenics and manic
depressives.  We all received the same treatment except us alkies were given
abstem, which makes you really sick if you touch alcohol, and we were
expected to attend AA meetings.

I attended a few AA meetings but didn't really take to them as I didn't like
associating with the drunks who were mostly much older than me.  I actually
felt less stigmatized spending my time chatting with the schizophrenics,
manic depressives and druggies who I thought were much more glamorous.  As
you can imagine my attitude meant that the treatment centre didn't do much
for me but I suppose I did stay off the alcohol for a few months.

One problem was that I attended the treatment centre for the wrong reasons.
My family had suggested it and my ex-girlfriend said she would consider
getting back together if I sorted out my drinking.  It was really her that
was my motivation for attending as well as the desire to leave Ireland
again.  I was only back a few weeks and already had enough.  At the time I
genuinely thought I loved her but I also saw her as means of escape.

I had met Val two years previously in Oxford where I was working as a barman
in a pub called the Westgate.  I had loved it there and it is here that my
drinking had first become a noticeable problem, but not really noticeable to
me.  I had started working there at eighteen and had spent the couple of
years before meeting her constantly drunk and sleeping my way through as
many of the available women as I could.

I would often make an arse of myself when drunk but just put this down to
high spirits.  It was at this time that I had my first blackout and during
it split up with a girl I was seeing.  I couldn't remember a thing about it
and was amazed when I heard but again I made a joke out of it.  I really
enjoyed it when people talked about my drunken escapades as it made me feel
like a bit of a celebrity.

Val soon came to the conclusion that Oxford was no good for me and suggested
we move with a vague plan of eventually going to Germany.  We decided to hit
Dublin first but any hopes she had of my problems with alcohol would resolve
were shattered when I discovered the joys of the 'early house' where you
could get drunk at seven in the morning.  I thought it was the best idea
ever and it added a whole new disturbing element to my problem.

My main memory of that time in Dublin was living in a bleak bed-sit and
having very little money, we once ended up eating Alpen muesli with
mayonnaise for dinner.  My family lived on the outskirts of the city but I
wanted to show them that I could cope on my own.  The lowest point came when
I sold a load of Val's cassette tapes to buy booze.  We decided that Dublin
was probably not the best place for me and moved to Scotland and her home in
Dumfries.

We spent that Christmas in her mums and on New Years Eve her mother, whose
bed we were sleeping in, needed to act as nurse as both me and Val took
turns vomiting into a basin. It was unusual for Val to be drunk and thought
it was great fun at the time.  We got a room in a house in Dumfries town but
to Val's horror there was a drunk writer/poet living there with who I became
bosom buddies with. I had gotten a job in a local club but after the first
night I never went back because I was too busy drinking scotch with my new
friend.  We decided to move to Glasgow where things further deteriorated to
a stage where she finally had enough and kicked me out.

I had no money and even as I hitched my way to the ferry terminal on the
other side of Scotland I was convinced she would tell me to come back.  She
didn't.  I finally needed to get my dad to pay for my fare from Ireland so
that I could make my way back there.  I was expecting a lot of sympathy from
my family but the best they could do was tell me to get help.  This was why
I ended up in my first treatment centre.

After a couple of months sober I returned to Glasgow and Val.  In my time
away she had discovered the Jehovah Witnesses and after a few more months I
gave up the idea of us having a future together.  I worked briefly as a
security guard for £1.50 an hour but left after I was caught asleep at my
post.  I returned to Oxford where I tried controlled drinking for a while
before going back to Glasgow and resumption of my previous drunkenness and
working in bars.  This lasted about a year before moving back to London.

The next time I needed treatment was at the age of twenty-five in London.
This time I spent a full year in a dry house and stayed sober for two years
but now is not the time for that story.

So as I said previously this was not my first treatment centre but what had
occurred before was completely different from Wat Thamkrabok.

Two monks escorted me to a curtained area where they provided me with a
laundry basket and told me to remove my clothes.  They suggested that I
consume any alcohol in my bag and I felt cheated because I didn't have any.
The only things that I was allowed to keep were my underwear, a few books
and my toiletries.  All money, clothes, passport, mobile phones, cameras and
everything else were locked away.  I was given two red prison-like uniforms
and some food vouchers and taken by the monks inside the locked area of the
temple where my kind were kept.

INSIDE

It had been explained to me that the red uniform which I was now wearing was
well known in the Louburi/Sariburi area and that if I ran away the local
people, and the police in particular, would know where I belonged.  Fleeing
was the last thing on my mind, especially as I had no money, motorbike key
or passport and my home was about 400KM away but it did happen regularly.
It was mostly Thais who escaped but apparently the odd Farang did as well.

Inside the gate I was asked by a monk what drug I was coming off and how
long I intended to stay off it.  I informed him of my intention to quit
alcohol for life. He told me that I needed to attend a ceremony in the
afternoon and I was to begin the medicine that afternoon.  I was a bit
surprised as I thought I would have at least the day to settle in.  I was
escorted to my room which contained three empty beds.

It was obvious that the bed beside me was occupied from the belongings
scattered around it.  I also noticed lots of mattresses in a larger room
which I had passed on my way to this smaller back room.  Apparently this
small room was where they kept us new admissions.  The room was very basic
and the bed hard but I hadn't been expecting much.

There was a sort of bed side locker where I shoved my books, which are
things I can never travel without.  I had only taken a couple with me, one a
Buddhist meditation manual and the other was a bit of light fiction.  I
hoped that there would be more books available as I suspected that I would
have plenty of reading time available in the near future.  The rest of my
belongings consisted of underwear, a towel, and some toiletries which I left
in the basket.  I also had a spear uniform and a sarong which had been
supplied by the temple.

I lay back on my bed and wondered what the future here had in store.  I was
eager for my room-mate to appear so that I could get some information but I
was also nervous about meeting a stranger, I am actually a fairly shy type
of guy.  I had no idea where everyone else was and I was too anxious to go
look for them.  I tried to read a bit as I had a few hours to spare before
the ceremony but I was unable to concentrate.

I was soon joined in the room by Matt who unbelievably came from the same
city as me in Ireland.  What are the chances of me checking into a detox in
Thailand and ending up in a bed beside another person from Dublin?  I
suppose though that the chance of it happening is higher than I would expect
seen as so many of my country have drug or alcohol problems.

Matt was twenty-six and was here with his wife Sharon as they were both
trying to get off heroin.  She was also from Dublin so I was beginning to
feel like I was right at home.  Matt was impressed by the fact that I now
lived in Thailand and could speak a bit of Thai.  We chatted a bit about
Dublin but Matt soon began to find the talk a struggle as he entered
withdrawals.

Matt and his wife had only arrived in that morning from Dublin and according
to him they had their last hit of heroin in the plane toilets and this was
now well out of their system.  I had heard that heroin withdrawals were
nasty but when he started rolling around on the bed moaning I though he was
putting it on a bit.  It is hard to feel sorry for someone else when you
have your own withdrawals to worry about.

I have been lucky enough to never have experienced serious withdrawal
complications from alcohol.  I know some people have seizures and many have
died during the DTs. I have milder symptoms which are far from pleasant but
bearable.  The main things I have experience are, sweating, inability to
concentrate, anxiety, minor hallucinations, general body pains and vague flu
like symptoms.  The worst part was knowing that they would disappear with a
few beers.

I was glad that Matt had already had his initiation ceremony as his moaning
on the bed was increasing my anxiety levels.  He began shouting that he
couldn't cope with the withdrawals and all I could do was tell him that he
didn't really have much choice.  I reminded him of how unlikely it was that
he would score heroin in the Thai countryside, especially as he had no money
and was wearing a uniform which identified him as a drug addict.  I was glad
when the time for the ceremony arrived so I could get out of the room.

THE SAJJA

I was taken outside the locked area of the temple to where a senior monk was
waiting to give me my sajja, which is a vow which in this case was to stop
drinking alcohol for life. I noticed that there were a lot more people
around as I passed through the complex.

The ceremony took place kneeling in front of a Buddha statue and I was
accompanied by a young Thai who was obviously suffering badly from drug
withdrawal.  The whole process was conducted in Pali language and both me
and the other addict repeated when required as best we could.  I was
struggling to fix my attention on anything but got through it somehow.

It was the use of the sajja that really appealed to me when I had read about
Thamkrabok on the internet.  I wanted to make a total commitment to quitting
alcohol and this felt like the perfect chance to do it.

Buddhism had become a very important part of my life and I am convinced that
it saved me from self-destructing completely.  I had been able to stop
drinking for a month or two over the previous few years with the help of
meditation and I'm sure my health would have deteriorated a lot more if it
were not for those breaks.  Buddhism had also given me a reason to quit as I
saw how my life could have meaning.

My first real contact with Buddhism occurred when I was about fifteen and
practicing a Chinese martial art.  At the time I was also interested in
Taoism which is another religion connected to Chinese Kung Fu.  My ideas
about these two great Faiths were probably very naive and I am sure that I
would mix the teachings of the two religions up.  It was also at this time
that I had my first encounter with meditation and was immediately fascinated
with it and all the possibilities it offered.

I do not have many memories of my early childhood, particularly before the
age of seven. One memory though is of my fascination of two wooden Buddha
images that stood above the fireplace in my parental grandparent's house; I
think that these had been put there by one of my aunts or uncles who had
visited Thailand.  I am not claiming any great meaning in this but I do find
fairly prophetic.

Before the age of fifteen I would have considered myself a devote Catholic;
or as devote as a teenage boy can be.  I was an altar boy, would frequently
do readings at mass and was even a member of the choir for a brief period.
I was very interested in Christianity and devoted time to reading the
Bible.  It was during these investigations that serious doubts arose in my
mind which quickly lead to me losing my faith completely.

These doubts, in my case, were irreconcilable and this was the end of my
membership with the church.  This decision of mine to abandon Christianity
caused a good deal of stress for my family in particular my grandmother.
This was not helped by my bitterness towards their faith, which I felt had
let me down, and for many years I would never miss an opportunity to
criticize them for their beliefs.  I now feel shame about this behaviour but
have no regrets about abandoning Christianity.

Due to major upheavals in my life I was unable to continue my martial arts
practice and my meditation practice soon faded out too.  My discovery of
alcohol soon replaced these pursuits and my investigations into Buddhism
were put on hold, although throughout the following sixteen years my
interest would occasionally be rekindled; but never for any real length of
time and never with any serious effort to follow the path.

I became interested in Buddhism again just before my move to Saudi and by
the time I moved to Thailand I was devouring every Buddhist book I could get
my hands on.  The message inside these books screamed out at me and it all
seemed so obvious.  I could see a way out of my addiction which would work
for me.

It ended up taken a further three years to finally escape but it was such a
relief to know there was a way out of the hell that addiction was making of
my life.  During those next few years I would often feel desperate but there
was always the hope that it would soon end and when the pain got too much it
was this that got me to Wat Thamkrabok.

The sajja vow is a serious business and this is especially true for the Thai
people who are convinced that breaking it will lead to horrific
consequences.  Oa had been quick to provide examples of people who had gone
to Wat Thamkrabok and later broke their vow.  These people died shortly
after or their lives became unbearable.  I wasn't completely convinced that
these events occurred because of breaking the vow but there is no way I
wanted to find out.

Wat Thamkrabok is unique in that you are only allowed to go through their
treatment program once; there are no second chances.  The reason for this is
the sajja which can only be made one time.  This was another aspect of the
temple which appealed to me as the revolving door policy of most treatment
centres didn't seem to work for me and I had seen how it had failed many
others.  I really felt this was my last chance and it was with this in mind
that I took the vow.

After the ceremony I went back to my room to await the medicine which makes
you vomit, knowing that it was this stuff that the temple was most famous
for.

THE MEDICINE THAT MAKES YOU VOMIT

When I got back to the dormitory almost everyone there was wearing a sarong
and one of the monks told me to do the same.  I soon found out this was
necessary for the medicine ceremony which was about to take place in a few
minutes; after all you didn't want vomit on your day clothes.

I had been told already that I was not allowed eat anything between midday
and the evening when the medicine was given.  We were also not allowed fizzy
drinks for the first five days and real tea and coffee were not available in
the compound.  These restrictions were in place in order to stop the effects
of the medicine being made worse than they already were.

I was nervous about the whole vomiting business even though I regularly did
this when I drank, it was not something I looked for but saw it as a
necessary part of being a drunk.  We walked over to the area where the
medicine was to be given.  Six of us in sarongs and another three in the
normal red uniform.  The guys in the red had already finished their course
of Wat Thamkrabok's specialty and were busy given us advice about how to
make it less unpleasant.

Myself, Sharon and Matt were first-timers and had no idea what to expect.
The other three westerners who were to receive the medicine would be taking
it for the last time, as they had already had four doses, but they also
seemed nervous and withdrawn as we made our way to the big event.

I was surprised by the number of people in the square where the ceremony was
to take place.  There was a line of tin buckets on one side and already
about twenty Thais kneeling in front of them, we were led to the last vacant
buckets as the old-timers gave us there final bits of advice.  &quot;Drink as
much water as you possibly can&quot;.  &quot;Try and go as long as possible before
getting sick&quot;, and &quot;kneel on your sandals&quot;.

We were all in place in front of the buckets.  My anxiety levels were
through the roof and I felt very self-conscious.  There were a big group of
people in front of us including a improvised musical band, a group of
western monks, a large group of Thais who had finished their course of
medicine and various temple helpers.  Behind us walking up and down were the
Thai monks who were keeping on eye on us like anxious mothers.

The medicine man began walking down the line of buckets administering a shot
glass of a dark brown liquid to each person as he went.  As soon as they
drank the medicine each person began knocking back scoops full of water.  He
had started at the other end from me so I had a bit of a wait.  I was glad
for the advice about using the sandals under my knees as kneeling on the
concrete was painful.

The band was playing and everybody began clapping and the Thai's who knew
the words began singing;

Krao nii, dtong lerk hai dai
Ta lerk mai dai, dtong daay ner ner,
Lerk sep-dit sia dii tii ter
Dtit pai jon ger, kong yer sak wan
Krai hen gaw ruu gan tua
Taa kuin pai mua
Dtong cha jabaan
Lerk sep-dit
sa-tii tua gan
taa lerk mai dai nan dtong daay ner ner

Now is the time to quit,
If we can't quit we are sure to die,
It is truly great to quit our addictions,
If we keep doing it until we're old, it will get us some day,
Doesn't matter where or who, everybody knows,
If you start doing drugs,
You need to make a vow,
to quit drugs forever
because if we can't quit we are sure to die.

The medicine man came to me and I knocked back the slimy brown liquid and as
soon as I tasted it knew that this was not something that belonged inside a
human.  I copied everyone else and frantically began drinking scoops of
water from the large bucket in front of me.  A monk standing behind me was
shouting out encouragement 'gin, gin, gin' which means to drink plenty.  I
was vaguely aware of others vomiting around me.

I had been told to try and finish the whole bucket of water but was only on
my second scoop when I began vomiting violently.  There was a gutter running
in front of us and it was into this that we were to aim but this was
difficult as it was projectile vomiting.

Soon there was nothing left to vomit up and I began retching.  The monk
pointed to the bucket and I returned to drinking scoops of water, although
it was difficult due to continued retching and vomit running out my nose but
soon I had something to vomit again.  This continued for about fifteen
minutes until the monks were satisfied that I had drunk enough.  I knew that
there was still more vomit to come but just wanted to get away.

When I got back to the room the other medicine takers were out the back
vomiting into a sewage pit.  I grabbed a couple of bottles of water to drink
and joined them around the hole to continue vomiting.  The amazing thing was
that it didn't feel strange to be standing there vomiting with a group of
strangers.  It is amazing how quickly we adapt.

THE FIRST NIGHT

After about an hour all that needed vomiting had been vomited and I was
surprised to find myself hungry.  I hadn't eaten anything since the day
before but this was not unusual for me as I would often miss a day's food
when on the beer.

There was a restaurant beside the ladies dormitory which was in the
neighbouring building to ours.  It was very basic but exactly what you came
to expect in Thailand and the variety of dishes available was surprising
given its small size.  There were a couple of large tables and three smaller
ones where you could eat your food.

Matt wasn't hungry but needed to get out of the room so he also came along
with me to get some food.  The rest of our Farang group were already tucking
into their meals with the exception of Matt's wife who like him was in no
mood for eating.

Sharon was six years younger than Matt but the withdrawals were making her
look a lot older.  She was very pale and her eyes were blood shot and
puffy.  Underneath you could see that she was an attractive woman but heroin
had done a good job of hiding this beauty.  We had only had a brief
conversation so far but she seemed a typical Dublin girl no different from
the ones I grew up with.  I immediately became fond of her in a brotherly
sort of way.

I ordered some food from the lady in the kitchen and went back outside to
sit with the rest of the group as I waited.  With the exception Of Matt and
Sharon I hadn't had a chance to learn much about the other members of the
group but they soon began filling me in on their backgrounds.

Bill was a tall Canadian with a goatee who reminded a bit of an American
Wrestler. He was one of those larger than life guys who automatically become
the centre of attention in any group.  He had come to Wat Thamkrabok to get
off cocaine and had been there three weeks already and was due to leave the
next day.  He seemed like he was great fun to be around and I thought it a
pity that he was going.

Joseph was Greek and appeared to be in his early forties.  He spoke
excellent English and it didn't take long to realize that he was very well
educated.  He had been very helpful and encouraging at the medicine ceremony
earlier but he too would be leaving the next day.

George was the oldest of the group and he was an alcoholic Glaswegian in his
late fifties.  He had been through many treatment programs in London and
like me had also lived in an Alcohol Recovery Project 'dry-house'.  It
turned out we shared many similar experiences despite the age difference.  I
was glad to hear that he would be staying a while longer at the temple.

Unlike me George turned up at the temple with a full bottle of whiskey and
when the monks told him that he needed to get rid of it he knocked back
almost the whole bottle.  Apparently he spent his first night wandering
around the treatment facility singing, dancing and trying to create a party
atmosphere.  The monks were amused by his antics and continued to make
references to it.  I could tell that George was ashamed about the whole
business but I found myself envious of his last dance with alcohol.

Matt and Sharon were both showing signs of withdrawal symptoms as they
puffed away on their cigarettes.  I suggested they try something to eat but
they weren't very enthusiastic but Sharon finally agreed to try some French
fries.  Matt decided he had enough and wandered back to his room and bed.

Sharon was unable to touch any of her food when it came but I happily
finished mine.  It normally takes a few days for me to get my appetite back
after coming of the alcohol so I looked on this as a bonus which I put down
to the wonders of the Wat Thamkrabok medicine.

Sharon was beginning to feel that her symptoms were getting worse and she
began to doubt her ability to last the course.  This was her first time
attempting getting off heroin and didn't feel that her problem was nearly as
bad as Matt's one.  She only smoked the stuff while he injected which
apparently is a lot more serious.

I told her that she would be a fool to not take this opportunity to get off
that dirty drug and that she was young enough at twenty to still have a
great future ahead.  She agreed but I wasn't sure she was doing this to shut
me up or because she genuinely believed it.  We talked for a bit more until
she had enough and headed to the girl's dormitory where she would suffer her
withdrawal symptoms in silence.

The restaurant was closed for the day and everyone had left.  George, Joseph
and Bill had gone to watch a movie in a sit-down area near the entrance.
They invited me along but I didn't feel that I had the concentration to
watch TV.  I went back to the room even though I was wide awake and tried to
read but soon gave up.

One of the alcohol withdrawal symptoms that I suffer from is insomnia which
is not helped by a slight night fever that also seems to occur along with
it.  I am not sure how much my lack of sleep that night was due to these
symptoms or due to the fact that Matt didn't stop moaning and shouting all
night.  Lack of sleep can make me feel like I am close to insanity,
especially in a situation like this when I am helpless to do anything about
it.  I knew that Matt was probably just as helpless to stop.  The morning
eventually came.

MORNING

I managed to drift off to sleep eventually near morning but it didn't last
long as Bill woke me and Matt up for morning chores.  It wasn't even six yet
and still dark outside.  I dragged myself out of bed but Matt refused to
move despite Bill telling him it was expected and part of the treatment.
There was no way he was getting out of the bed so we left him to it.

We made our way back to the square, where the medicine show had been the day
before, and a large group of Thais busily sweeping the leaves that had
fallen over night.  Myself, Bill, George and Joseph grabbed a bamboo brush
from a rack and joined them.  Each of us found our on spot and made our way
slowly around the temple sweeping as we went.

I quickly became grateful for making the effort to get out of bed and do
some work.  I tried to treat it as a moving meditation and it felt very
therapeutic.  Nobody was talking during the work but instead focusing on
what they were doing as they swept from side to side.  The only time we made
contact with each other was when we moved our leaves together to make
mini-mountains in order to make it easier to scoop up.

I thought we had finished our work when we had reached the gate out of the
treatment area but was surprised when they opened it to allow us to continue
sweeping the rest of the temple compound.  I didn't mind one bit and this
was probably the most productive thing I had done in a while.

Sweeping became a bit harder as we hit pebbles but it now seemed that more
people had joined in and it could actually be difficult to find an area to
sweep.  I found myself become possessive of the area I was sweeping and
actually got slightly irritated when others invaded it to help me out.  It
was a bit ridiculous really.

We reached a small shrine which contained a Buddha statue.  I was later to
find it that it also contained the body of one of the temple founders which
had been mummified. People had already begun showing their respect in the
form of a triple bow in front of the Buddha image. I grabbed three incense
sticks which were left for this purpose and joined the others in this simple
act which has been performed for nearly two thousand five hundred years by
Buddhists around the globe.

People who are not familiar with Buddhism often view this act of respect as
idol worship but this is not the case and it certainly isn't the reason why
I perform it.  I use it as a chance to remind myself of my beliefs and as a
chance to practice humility.  I always try and bow mindfully, the first bow
thinking of the Buddha, the second thinking of his teachings, and the third
vow thinking about the community of monks he left behind.  The three incense
sticks also serve this purpose.

When we had finished paying our respects we made our way back inside the
locked area of the temple.  It had only taken half an hour to complete and
was far from backbreaking work.  This sweeping of leaves needed to be
performed twice a day and the purpose was to prevent malaria and to remove a
favourite hiding place for spiders and other nasties.

I made my way back to the room but didn't get too comfortable as I knew we
would need to get up again in an hour.  I picked up my book and managed a
few chapters before we were called for the National Anthem.

The Thai National Anthem is played twice a day at eight in the morning and
six in the evening.  I first saw this ritual performed when I began teaching
English in a Bangkok government school and was now very familiar with it as
I heard it each morning from the school near our house.  In cinemas across
Thailand a different anthem is played prior to the main film, that one being
the King's anthem.

Matt said he wasn't going to attend the National Anthem as he didn't see the
point of it and wasn't physically up to it.  I told him that he was being
very disrespectful but he just didn't get it and wouldn't listen, he rolled
over in his bed and ignored me.

I knew he was suffering from his withdrawals and understood him not wanting
to sweep but I didn't think five minutes paying respect to his hosts was
asking too much, especially as they were treating him for free.  His
attitude was beginning to irritate me and I felt that his lack of respect
made all us Westerners look bad.

I joined everyone else in front of a square statue dedicated for this
purpose and we stood to attention while the anthem was played.  The Thais
sang it with great pride and I joined in during the few bits I remembered.
I felt a bit self-conscious doing so and worried that the Thais may view me
as an over-enthusiastic Farang who was butchering their favourite song and
that the other Westerners might think I was showing off.  I ended up just
mumbling a bit.  I looked around and was pleased to see that Matt had been
escorted out by the monks to join the rest of us.

THE TEA CEREMONY

After the National Anthem we were each given a mug of a special herbal tea
produced at the temple.  The first time I tried this I thought it was really
disgusting but quickly developed a taste for it.  I had been told that this
mixture was great for de-toxin the body and there were also other claims
that it lowered cholesterol levels and importantly for me helped heal the
liver.  During my stay at the temple I never missed an opportunity to drink
the stuff.

As I mentioned earlier the condition of my liver had been of great concern
to me for a few years.  When the doctor in Ireland had warned me that it was
being damaged I thought that this would act as a 'wake-up' call but it
didn't.  Even before hearing this news I had decided to use my move to Saudi
as a chance to take a break from alcohol.  The fact that alcohol was banned
there had been a major factor in the decision to take the job.

As soon as I arrived in Riyadh it became apparent that any idea I had of
alcohol being unavailable there was wrong.  The Saudi whose job it had been
to collect me from the airport and deliver me to my villa in Medical City
was quick to inform me how alcohol was obtained and when we arrived one of
the first things in my villa he pointed out was the alcohol being distilled
by one my neighbours.  He obviously saw in me somebody who likes a drink.
Alcohol was illegal in Saudi Arabia but was very easy for foreigners to brew
there own and most Westerners did.

I did manage to stay off alcohol for the first few weeks in Riyadh but fear
of destroying my liver could only stop me short-term and in the end the
alcoholics friend, denial, won out and I was back on it again.  I had plenty
of justifications but none of them were reasonable and would probably sound
insane to somebody who hasn't suffered from addiction.  I told myself that a
few weeks was plenty to allow my liver to heal and that I would be more
careful in future.  I saw life as dull and unbearable without my drug and
that 'controlled drinking' was the best way.

This attempt at 'controlled drinking' was not a new idea to me but rather a
method I had been attempting since the age of twenty and failing miserably
each time.  These failures never deterred me from trying it again, even
though during moments of lucidity and sanity I would know that I was
deluding myself.

The truth was I had no real desire to control my alcohol intake and from the
very first time I drank alcohol my goal was to get drunk.  I never drank for
the taste and saw anything less than intoxication as a waste of times.  I
would see people leave a drink unfinished or spending hours sipping it and I
would think they were crazy; I can't even sip water.  What I really wanted
was to be able to get drunk whenever I felt like it without suffering the
consequences.  This of course was an impossible task.

I think that it is almost impossible to describe to someone else what it is
like to be an alcoholic, or drug addict, unless they are one.  The best
definition of insanity I have heard was in AA and it described it as
constantly repeating the same mistakes but expecting different results each
time.  This is what we do, it doesn't mater how messed up our lives become
or how many resolutions we make the insanity tells us that this time it will
be different.  We continually forget the basic law of nature which states
that if we keep on doing the same things, the same things will keep on
happening.  This is our problem.

I knew from the first time I got help for my alcohol problem that the only
real solution was complete abstinence but, as Buddhists learn fairly
quickly, knowing something intellectually doesn't really mean you know it.
It was easy for me to bury this information in the depths of my mind and
continue on with the madness that things would improve if only the
conditions were right; no alcohol before six in the evening, no strong
lagers, no spirits, only spirits, eat before drinking and only twenty-one
units of alcohol a week.

The insanity of the belief that I could somehow escape the consequences of
being a habitual drunk was ruining my life as well as my health.  I had
finally reached my limit and had taken all I could take.  I needed to stop
now and forever.  This really was my last chance and even if the Wat
Thamkrabok monks told me I needed to run around Thailand naked in order to
get sober I would have done it.  Like alcohol I didn't like the taste of Wat
Thamkrabok tea at first but unlike alcohol I knew it was benefiting me.  I
only hoped that it wasn't too late for my liver but suspected it was.

Shortly after receiving our tonic we needed to go to the main reception to
receive our Thamkrabok currency which we could use to buy things such as
food and drinks inside the temple.  These vouchers actually looked like
money and came in different denominations.  We were allowed to get any
amount of this currency we wished so long as it was a reasonable amount but
I never needed more than 100 Baht each day. We were expected to pay for
these vouchers at the end of our stay.  Real money was not allowed.

PROMISES

The routine at Wat Thamkrabok was far from strenuous but there were regular
activities throughout the day.  I found a daily itinerary posted on our
dormitory wall behind Matt's bed; I am not sure how we missed it the day
before.  It was a lucky find as it stopped the need for me to be continually
asking people what I should be doing next.

The daily routine involved waking up at six to sweep the temple and then
free time until the National Anthem at eight followed by the collecting of
vouchers.  There was free time until about one in the afternoon during which
we could wash anything that needed washing, have a shower, eat something or
get a massage.  I was quick to put my name down for a massage when the
masseuse turned up in the morning for bookings.

I later heard Matt and Sharon say that they wouldn't mind a massage so I had
no problem delaying mine until another day.  The masseuse could only fit a
few in before her noon finish and it was obvious that their need was greater
than mine.  I was hoping that a massage would help settle Matt a bit.  He
seemed pleased about the idea and it was the first thing I had seen him
positive about since meeting him.

Sharon had looked a lot better at breakfast and even managed to eat
something.  She appeared to be beginning to believe that she could make
treatment work for her and I was pleased for her sake.  We began discussing
possible future career plans and she mentioned that she wanted to return to
education.  I thought this was a great idea.  I began to wonder what would
have happened if I had remained sober at her age.

One of the promises made at Wat Thamkrabok is that if you keep your sajja
vow great things will happen in your life.  I had no problem believing this
and already had personal evidence of how just quitting alcohol could
magically turn my life around.

When I was twenty-five I entered treatment for the second time.  During the
period prior to this had been  living in South East London and had reached
what I thought was the lowest place I could possibly reach; begging for
money in an area of London known as Elephant &amp; Castle.  This period of my
life was very brief but it can still fill me with deep shame.

I had reached a stage where I felt unable to function and was regularly
suicidal.  I had spent much of that year going to bed and just hoping I
wouldn't wake up.  This was also the year that Kurt Cobain had committed
suicide and I envied him his courage to end it all.

In my view of the world at the time, suicide was cool and I have no idea how
many drunken suicide notes I wrote during this period.  A doctor later told
me that I had suffered a breakdown and diagnosed me with alcoholic induced
depression.

I am sure the doctor was right in his diagnosis but it was not what I
expected depression to be like.  During these episodes I would feel
intensely awake and everything would seem very clear.  The idea of suicide
was exciting and made the world appear less hostile as I now felt in
control.  Death has always been a terrible fear of mine but during this time
I viewed it as my friend and saviour.  I look back now and think I was
incredibly 'lucky' to survive this dangerous time.

I actually had quite a few things going for me at the time.  I had just
completed an 'Access to Social Science Course' and was due to start my
degree in a few months.  It had been my aim to get out of bar-work and
return to full-time education and had spent the last years up to this
studying for 'A' Levels and GCSEs by distance education.  My 'A' level
results were far from fantastic but alright considering the fact I was drunk
throughout that period and was also regular using amphetamine.

My breakdown occurred on the day my exam results came out for the access
course.  I had passed everything, my dreams were well on track, and I should
have spent the day proud and happy like everyone else who passes exams.
Instead my mood turned completely black and I found myself unable to
function and terrified that I had gone completely mad.

My mind was racing and I couldn't get any control over it.  I was working in
a friend's bar part-time, and was expected at work that day, but there was
no way this was going to happen.  I couldn't even get my thoughts straight
enough to telephone him and tell him I was too sick to come in.  All I could
do was drink.

I remember very little else about that day only that I ended up begging for
beer money in an underground walkway, a couple of hundred meters from the
University I was due to be attending.  One of the few clear thoughts I had
was that I wouldn't be going to University anytime soon.

The next day my mood was the same.  I had consumed an extremely large amount
of alcohol the day before but didn't even feel hung-over and for the first
time in years I didn't even want to drink.  I took to walking the streets of
London hoping that this would somehow slow my thoughts and allow me to think
straight.  I considered admitting myself to a psychiatric ward but didn't
know how to do this.

It is funny really, I was hoping for my mind to return to sanity long enough
for me to get myself admitted to a mental hospital.  I somehow ended up in
New Cross and noticed the Alcohol Recovery Project (ARP) office.  I don't
know how I achieved this as the ARP office doesn't even have a sign on it;
just an anonymous shop-front.  A few days later I had entered one of their
dry houses and began a very happy time of my life.

I stayed sober for two years after this and completely turned my life
around.  My mental condition was completely altered as my depression
disappeared and I had no more suicidal thoughts.  I began to love waking up
in the morning and the days just weren't long enough for me to fill
everything I wanted to do into them.  I also found that real joy occurred
when you thought about other people and this motivated me to train as a
nurse.

The greatest thing was knowing that all the time my life was improving.  As
a drunk my life was deteriorating in a steady progression as time passed but
the opposite occurred when sober.  The most amazing success stories I have
ever heard occurred when drunks got sober.

So I had no problem believing the Wat Thamkrabok promise that my life would
continuously improve as long as I kept my vow.  I knew this would also
happen for Sharon if she kept hers.  I tried to explain this to her that
morning but sometimes it is hard to put things the right way; especially in
a situation where one drunk in withdrawals is trying to convince a heroin
addict in cold turkey.

THE GRAND ENTRANCE

After breakfast I had a shower and washed the uniform I had worn the day
before.  When I say shower, I actually mean a large tank full of cool water
from which you used a plastic scoop to pour it over yourself.  After a few
years in Thailand I was familiar with this arrangement but was curious as to
what Matt would make of it.

It was ten o'clock in the morning and this meant that I still had two and a
half hours before the next item on our schedule.  Matt and Sharon both had
their massage to look forward to while Bill and Joseph were both busy
preparing for their departure.  I returned to my favourite position which
was lying on the bed reading.

I fell asleep at some stage and woke up to the noise of a pick-up truck
reversing outside my window.  I was amazed to see another westerner being
lifted unconscious out of the back of it but a group of brown robed monks.
This was not the sort of thing that you see everyday and I suspected that
this new admission was going to be a very interesting guy indeed.  It turned
out I was right.

The unconscious man looked to be in his late thirties, although it is hard
to tell when somebody is in such a state.  He was covered in vomit and he
appeared to have both wet and shat himself.  I immediately put him down as a
fellow drunk and was pleased as I was beginning to feel outnumbered by the
heroin addicts; especially since Bill was leaving.

The monks carried our new neighbour into our room and deposited him on a
mattress which had just been put on the floor in anticipation of his
arrival; somebody had obviously phoned ahead.  As well as the monks were two
female farang volunteers who were both ex-addicts who had recovered at Wat
Thamkrabok a few years previously.  They were a great help around the temple
because they could act as translators and knew how to meet the specific
needs of their fellow Westerners.  They also knew the answers to most of our
endless problems.

The vast majority of monks at Wat Thamkrabok are ex-addicts themselves and
it has always been my conviction that it is only alcoholics/addicts who can
really gain the trust of their suffering fellows.  This explains the lasting
success of AA which despite have fairly low long-term recovery rates (if you
believe the available figures), they do help many people achieve long
periods of sobriety and there are a significant number of members who
managed to maintain this sobriety for the rest of their life.

I would imagine that AA has helped more people than any other organized
recovery method.  But having said that, I tend to believe the majority of
problem drinkers recover without any outside help, but I have no way of
proving this and it could easily be argued that these people's problem
weren't that big to begin with.

It is known though that people did recover from alcohol addiction before the
arrival of AA and still do recover without it today.  I have great respect
for Alcoholics Anonymous because they have really helped me in the past and
they were definitely a necessary part of the path that got me where I am
today.  I have many fond memories of my involvement with them but I no
longer attend their meetings and have developed some different views in
regards to how best I should recover.  I still benefit from the wise things
they taught me though, much of which is compatible with my Buddhist beliefs.

I must have read hundreds of recovery books over the years and the ones that
really appealed to me were those written by fellow drunks.  Those written by
non-addicts would always feel a bit dry or else it would feel like somebody
was trying to sell me something and automatically make me suspicious of the
value of their writings and their motivations for writing it.

The books written by fellow drunks would be full of the insanity which I was
also dealing with and reading them would reassure me that somebody else
understood.  Hearing about their recoveries would lift my spirits and
provide hope; I would devour this type of book. Probably the best book of
this type is the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous which has helped so many.
Unfortunately some zealot people have used this book as a bible, from which
to preach from, and this has turned others off it.

I know that professionals in the recovery business have helped many but at
the end of the day it is a business and from what I can tell a very
profitable one.  As I mentioned earlier it is very easy to get caught up in
their revolving door policies.  There are plenty of theories available about
how to cure alcoholism but some of these have turned out to cause more
damage than benefit.

I don't think people who get addicted to alcohol or drugs tend to be very
trusting people; they probably were at one stage but coping with an
addiction changes things.  When I was young I was very naive but years of
alcohol abuse had made me very cynical of professional helpers.  It would be
very difficult for me to be open with them but somebody who was previously a
drunk, but now recovered, could quickly win my trust.

The crowd around the new arrivals bed departed as soon as they were
satisfied that he was safe to be left alone.  They had sensibly turned him
on his side and I was urged by the nurse in me to frequently peak over at
him to make sure he wasn't choking on his own vomit. He remained
unconscious.

HEAT

At one in the afternoon we all went for a communal sauna in a different part
of the temple; outside the locked treatment area.  We were escorted by about
six monks and when we arrived at the first sauna we were divided into two
groups; Thai and Farang.  There were over thirty in the Thai group but only
four westerners in our group.  We were also later joined by two Thai women.
I felt a bit sorry for the larger group as it looked like we were getting
special treatment.

The Sauna was under the control of a tall African-American monk who
apparently was an ex-GI who had been at the temple for years.  He was very
loud and very funny.  The sauna was made of concrete and if I hadn't know
what it was beforehand I would have assumed it was a toilet.  The sauna was
heated from a fire at the back of the building.

We were directed to a large tank of cold water and followed the example of
the two Thai women who were completely soaked through scooping it all over
their bodies.  The water was a welcome relief from Thai heat but it didn't
last long as we entered the cramped dark room that was the sauna.  There
were two benches on each side and another tank of water at the end of the
room.  There was a strong smell of what I assumed to be eucalyptus.  We were
separated from the outside by a curtain which was kept wet in order to trap
the heat inside.

One of the monks had joined us and I made the mistake of commenting to him
that it wasn't that hot.  He began scooping more water and the room was soon
full of steam.  We were only expected to stay in for ten minutes each time
but it seemed like an eternity.  Matt quickly escaped the room but I forced
myself to stay.

Soon there was only myself and the monk left inside and I was convinced his
colleague, who was meant to be checking the time, had forgotten about us; it
now seemed a lot more than ten minutes.  I commented in Thai to my companion
but he just laughed, he looked like he could stay in there all day.  At last
I was relieved to hear somebody shouting 'awk pai' which means out.  I burst
out of the room and scooped some lovely cold water over myself.

We were allowed to take a break for a few minutes and then the whole process
was repeated.  We had three sessions inside the sauna that day and I felt
really good afterwards.  My body felt clean and I felt relaxed but really
awake at the same time.  We were taken back inside the locked area.

When we got back to the room the new arrival was thrashing around on his
mattress and moaning in his sleep.  A group of monks soon arrived having
decided that this was the time to remove his vomit covered clothes and get
him inside the red uniform.  He was more alert now and didn't seem too happy
about being touched and began kicking out at the monks.  He still hadn't
opened his eyes so I was sure he had no idea where he was or who was
touching him.

The monks persisted and managed to get him down to his soiled underwear.  It
was at this stage that he opened his eyes and began screaming at the monks
in a broad Welsh accent to 'get the f**k away from me'.  The two female
western volunteers had now arrived and tried to explain to him that he had
arrived safely at Wat Thamkrabok.  He didn't seem to comprehend this
information as he continued to scream and kick out at the monks.

Matt, in the bed beside me, was loving the action and seemed to think the
whole thing was hilarious.  The monks were probably seeing the situation as
less comical as some of the Welsh guy's kicks and punches made contact with
them.  He had begun screaming that he wanted his stuff back and was accusing
everyone of stealing his drugs.  He didn't look like he was going to calm
down anytime soon, if anything he was getting worse.

He was now on his feet and consequently more of a danger to himself and
everyone around him.  The monks rushed him and managed to get him out of the
room and into the swimming pool.  Matt was now cheering the action and
shouting out advice.

When I had arrived at the temple the day before I hadn't even noticed the
swimming pool, probably due to the fact that it was the strangest swimming
pool I have ever seen.  It was only about a meter and a half across and
about ten meters long.  On first sight the water looked very dirty and when
Bill had jumped in it for a swim the day before I was surprised.  I had a
dip myself and found it wasn't that bad at all.  The water was up to about
chin level and the water was cleaner then it had seemed from above.  I
noticed a filtering device at one end of the pool and this further reassured
me.

The new guy was in the pool and surrounded by monks who weren't going to let
him out until he calmed down.  He had stopped screaming but was still
accusing people of stealing his stuff and occasionally making a swipe at a
monk's leg in an attempt to pull then into the pool.

After a few more minutes of this he seemed to accept the fact that the monks
were trying to help him and they agreed to let him out of the pool if he
agreed to stop attacking them.  They helped him out of the pool but as soon
as he returned to our room he became aggressive again and resumed screaming
that he wanted his stuff.  The monks eventually managed to restrain him and
took him to a room across from our dormitory where he was locked in.  He
continued to scream for another half hour but was calm enough to be released
soon after.

SELFISH

In the afternoon we needed to sweep the temple again.  Myself and George
were now the only foreigners helping out.  Matt had again refused to leave
his bed and Sharon hadn't joined us either; maybe she didn't know about it
as she was in the women's dormitory and nobody there could speak English.
She had complained earlier that she was finding it difficult because of the
language barrier between her and the Thai women.  The monks didn't seem too
concerned about their absence.

I was a bit annoyed with Matt because he didn't seem to be putting in, what
I considered to be, the required effort.  I judged him to be not taking
things in the temple serious enough, and it was my opinion that if he didn't
change his ways quickly he would fail in his attempt to quit drugs.  I knew
that this was his business but it still bothered me because I could see that
underneath his bullshit he was actually a decent guy.  He was also from my
home town and so he sort of felt like family.

If I looked deep at the reasons for my irritation with Matt it is obvious
that the real problem was we had very similar personality flaws.  His
self-absorption and selfishness were so obvious to me because I had spent so
much of my life being self-absorbed and selfish.  When I noticed these
faults in him it reminded me of what I am really like and this is far from
the way I like to picture myself.

I have always viewed myself as a really nice guy who has had bad things
happen to him over the years.  I have no problem admitting that I have made
many mistakes but can easily explain this away as a response to previous bad
experiences or things beyond my control.

In this way of thinking my alcohol problem is not my fault because I am a
victim of alcoholism and all the bad things that I do when drunk is due to
this, so I shouldn't really be held accountable.  If I do something bad when
sober I can blame this on poorly suited coping methods I learnt as a child.

If somebody doesn't like me I can reassure myself that they haven't really
seen the real me.  The problem with this type of thinking is that it means
that nobody is really responsible for anything although I usually don't to
see it this way.  In my world I make mistakes because of circumstances
beyond my control but others do so because they are bad people.  An
ex-girlfriend summed it up beautifully when she said, &quot;Paul, you expect so
much from other people but so little from yourself&quot;.  She was absolutely
correct but at the time I thought she was just someone else who
misunderstood me.

I was twenty-two when I met Barbara in London bar, off Tottenham Court Road,
where she was working as a part-time barmaid.  At the time I was also
working as a barman at a nearby pub called 'The Marlborough'.  I had spent
that day on a pub-crawl from my favourite part of London at the time, Camden
Town.

These solo pub-crawls were due to my belief that somewhere out there was the
perfect bar and if I just found it everything would be just right in my
life.  This bar would be frequented by other fantastic customers with who I
would bond with immediately and we would become life-long friends, and all
these new friends would help sort my life out.  They would see the locked
talent within me and perhaps see that underneath I had the potential to be a
rock star, or a movie star or even a novelist.  This bar would be a mixture
between the Sam Malone's 'Cheers' bar and Santa's magic grotto.

I know that this sort of thinking is completely ridiculous but I continued
to look for this perfect bar right up until the time I entered Wat
Thamkrabok.  I never managed to find it and never even came close; it was
just the alcoholic version of 'the search for the holy grail' although I
would imagine that those searching for the grail got a lot more exercise.

It was about nine at night when I came to the bar where Barbara worked and I
must have been very drunk, although I didn't really feel it, because I had
been drinking since midday.  I was sitting at the bar and somehow managed to
get into conversation with her.  This was unusual for me because I normally
kept quite due to shyness and the fact that when drunk I could easily upset
strangers, so I had learnt to avoid contact.  It was especially unusual
because she was very attractive and I rarely make the first move in this
type of situation.  I somehow managed to get a date and we arranged to meet
the next evening in another local bar.

At work the next day one of the other barmen, Geoff, was pleased for me but
advised that I take it easy on the alcohol, on this first date, and avoid
getting drunk.  He had seen me in action when drunk before and realized that
this wasn't going to impress anyone.  It was Geoff's opinion that the reason
I got so drunk was because I drank so fast and he suggested that I switch to
an alcoholic drink which I didn't like the taste of.  Cider was the second
drink I had gotten drunk on and it caused me to be violently sick at the
time and I had avoided it since.

I was very nervous about meeting Barbara so had a couple of pints of cider
before our date.  I was quick to lose these nerves when she arrived not just
because of the alcohol but also because she was so easy to be around.
Barbara only worked as a barmaid part-time and was studying to be a
chiropodist at the University of London the rest of the time.  She lived in
nearby student accommodation.

The idea that drinking cider would slow down my consumption rate turned out
to be false.  I was knocking them back but Barbara didn't seem to mind.  She
wasn't drinking as much as me but she had a few.  She seemed to enjoy
herself and must have seen something she liked in me because we ended up in
bed together.

I went out with Barbara for about nine months and at the time was convinced
I was in love.  I would still look at other girls and wonder if I was
missing something but this was normal for me and I had no intention of being
unfaithful.

During our time together I was often critical of her student friends but
this was more to do with jealousy than anything else.  I envied their
student life and I soon became aware that my life was going nowhere and I
felt worthless in comparison to them.  My answer to this was to be very
arrogant around them; I was very good at looking down on people while lying
in the gutter.

In the beginning she didn't seem too bothered with my heavy drinking but as
the months went by she became aware of just how serious my problem was.  The
final straw occurred on a trip to Liverpool to visit her family.  I had
literally just walked through the door of her families' home and I was
insisting she take me to the local pub.  I saw nothing wrong with this at
the time but her family was very shocked and her mother warned her of what
she would be getting into by getting involved with a drunk.  That weekend in
Liverpool was enough to convince her that we had no future together.

Over the next couple of weeks Barbara pulled away from me but the harder she
pulled away the more I tried to hold on to her.  I had handed in my notice
at the bar and was due to quit the next week.  My accommodation came with
the job so I needed to rent a new flat and I was hoping that we would now
live together full-time.  I had gotten a job in a supermarket on the night
shift so that I could go to college during the day.

Barbara used the excuse of her exams to suggest we have a break from each
other.  I was completely devastated and used it as an excuse to hit the
alcohol even harder.  We weren't allowed to drink behind the bar but I no
longer cared, I was leaving anyway.  During one of these drunken episodes I
pretended to collapse behind the bar in order to get off work but I suppose
the real reason was attention seeking.  I secretly hoped Barbara would hear
about it and come rushing to see me full of concern, but of course she
didn't.

The boss of the bar had reached his limit with me and made it quite clear
his disappointed.  He had asked me to reconsider leaving 'The Marlborough'
but now thought it was for the best.  He said he just couldn't understand
me; when I first began to work there I was like a 'diamond' but now my work
had deteriorated to such an extent that I was a liability.  It was obvious
he wanted me to leave right away but he obviously felt sorry for me and
allowed me to finish the week out.

A couple of days later I saw Barbara walk past 'The Marlborough' with some
college friends. I ran out after her and she genuinely seemed shocked at the
state I was in.  She agreed to meet up with me for a chat a few days later.
I was so relieved and became convinced that we would get back together.

Any hope of a reunion was destroyed that night.  I would get a one hour
break from the 'The Marlborough' in the evening and I would use this time to
travel to another bar and knock back a few pints of larger.  I had finished
my break and was returning to work when I saw Barbara walking with another
man who had his arms around her.  I shouted out her name and she looked at
me in surprise.  I am sure she felt sorry for me but they just kept walking.

I can't remember much of the rest of the night only that I drank myself into
oblivion.  I started knocking back beers as soon as I returned to the bar
and soon entered blackout mode.  I left the next morning for Ireland and
gave up any ideas of starting a new job or moving into my new apartment.  I
lied to the landlord that a family member had just died so that he would
quickly return my deposit.

I was angry at Barbara for quite a while after this and hated what I saw as
her betrayal.  When I left for Ireland I sort of expected her to plead with
me to come back but I never saw her again.  It took me a long while but
eventually my anger wore off and I realized that she had really tried to
make things work and it was me who kept letting her down.

Now I look back at my time with Barbara and feel immense gratitude because
it was her that motivated me to return to education.  Not long after
returning to Ireland I began studying for my 'A' levels via distance
education and this path led to seven years later entering City University to
study nursing and later obtain my degree.

My lack of qualifications had been a big disappointment in my life as I was
expelled from school without any significant exam results at sixteen.  When
I entered secondary school I was in the top stream but my parents went
through a very messy separation and I reacted badly to this.

In a period of two years I went from top stream to being put in a
non-academic class which concentrated on work skills.  None of my family
seemed too worried about this as they were too caught up in their own
problems.  In between I had changed school as I had moved to Cork to stay
with my dad and his new girlfriend.  My behaviour continued to deteriorate
until I was finally expelled from school.

As I say, I could give you a convincing list of reasons why I'm so messed up
but if I'm honest selfishness &amp; self-absorption should be top of the list.
I could see these defects in Matt and didn't like being reminded of them.

DANNY GETS HIS MEDICINE

The noisy new neighbour was Danny from Cardiff and when I got back to the
room he was busy chatting away with Matt.  He looked  more relaxed now but
was still not happy with his predicament and was insisting that he be given
his stuff and be allowed to leave the temple.

Wat Thamkrabok had sent a pick-up to collect him from the airport; which is
situated about three hundred kilometres away in Bangkok.  Two of the female
volunteers were waiting, with a placard bearing his name, in arrivals at Don
Muang airport.  He told us that he had changed his mind at the last minute
about coming straight to the temple and decided to spend the weekend getting
wasted in Bangkok first instead.

He had drunk a bottle of vodka on the plane so was really in party mode.
Unfortunately for Danny's plans he made eye contact with the two volunteers
waiting for him and, according to his version of things, they conned him
into getting into the pick-up truck.

George had been through a similar experience but unlike Danny he had somehow
evaded his greeters to spend the weekend drunk in a sordid area of the Thai
capital called Patpong.  I later humorously suggested that this proved that
we alkies were far more cunning than our junkie counterparts.

Danny had finished another bottle of vodka on his way to the temple and this
accounted for his state when he arrived.  Surprisingly he had not come to
the temple to get off alcohol but instead to quit heroin.  He felt that
alcohol was the least of his worries but I wasn't convinced.

Danny was threatening to go on the rampage if the temple didn't return his
stuff and allow him to leave.  At one stage he leapt out of the bed and
kicked the door open and this annoyed me because he broke the mosquito
frame.  I was worried that Matt was making things worse by ridiculing him
and accusing him of attention seeking; like he could he talk.

Matt grilled him about his heroin use and accused him of exaggerating the
amounts he claimed to take and then proceeded to question his sexual
orientation and made very derogatory remarks about the Welsh.  Danny was no
easy target and was throwing equally insulting comments at Matt.  It was
very juvenile but they actually both seemed to be enjoying the slagging and
although what they were saying was fairly offensive stuff it wasn't
bothering anyone else.

When I was growing up in Dublin I was very familiar with this type of banter
and would often use it among friends. Our way of showing affection was by
saying disgusting things about the other's mother or sisters.  A favourite
was to stick your middle finger in the air and invite your friend to smell
his mother.  It was very offensive stuff but we didn't really know any
better. It was a type of humour that I thought that I had left behind in my
teens but this was the level of communication now between the two; but to
Matt's credit it was taking Danny's mind off his lack of mood altering
chemicals.

The time arrived for our evening vomiting session and when the monks arrived
to escort Danny he surprised us by willingly coming along.  I am not so sure
that if he knew what he was getting into that it would have been so easy.
Whatever buzz he was still getting off the alcohol would soon be removed as
he vomited into a Wat Thamkrabok drain.

The action with Danny had kept my mind from thinking too much about the
upcoming vomiting ceremony.  I was actually more anxious about the whole
thing this time as I now knew exactly what it involved.  Danny was kneeling
by the bucket next to mine and he was surrounded by three Thai monks, two
farang monks and the two volunteers; they obviously weren't taken any
chances with him.  The music started up, the clapping started, we knocked
back the medicine and once again I was puking my guts up into a Wat
Thamkrabok drain.

I had been told that the aim of the medicine was to reduce the time in
withdrawal by quickly removing all the impurities from the body.  I am not
sure about the science behind this but I definitely had milder withdrawal
symptoms after just one dose.  I am convinced though that it has a lot more
benefit than just reduced withdrawal symptoms and I feel that the ceremony
itself was just as important as the medicine.

As I said before we drunks and druggies are often self-absorbed and selfish
and generally lacking in any type of humility.  This means that it can be
hard for us to learn life's lessons as we are not very teachable.  In my
view projectile vomiting in front of a group strangers is probably one of
the most humbling experiences there is.  When you are sick like this it
makes you completely vulnerable to the world and this instils a willingness
to learn and change.

Danny seemed to be following the yelled out instructions appropriately and
was managing to get a lot more water into himself than I was.  Like the
previous day I was struggling to get it down because my stomach was
cramping.  I did the best that I could but escaped back to the dormitory
yard as soon as I thought I would get away with it.  I struggled to avoid
vomiting as I made my way across the court yard to clean and tidy away my
bucket.

The other vomiters soon joined me around our dormitory sewer. Danny was far
from happy and in between pukes he demanded that we give him back his
'f**king stuff and get him the f**k out of here'.  In between vomits we
tried to let him know that it wasn't really up to us.  I started to break
into hysterical laughter as the ridiculousness of our situation hit me.  As
John Lennon famously said; 'nobody told me there would be days like
these...strange days indeed'.

WE WEREN'T PRISONERS

It wasn't true to say that we were held prisoner in Wat Thamkrabok but it
was true to say that the monks would use every trick in the book to keep us
there.  The monks knew that the first reaction many would have when the
withdrawals began was to want to flee.  As I mentioned before the majority
of the monks were ex-addicts themselves so they knew what the deal was.
They knew what we were going through because they had been through it
themselves.  They also knew how manipulative and devious we could be because
they had been this way themselves.

The monks must have seen every type of crazy over the years and it is a
credit to the temple that it still continues to help so many seemingly
hopeless cases.  I would say the majority of westerners who go through the
temple have already been through some if not many treatment centres in their
home countries and Wat Thamkrabok is often their last chance.  The services
of the temple are offered for free and the monks don't get paid for their
work.  The temple offers help with no strings attached but for some even
this isn't enough.

Pete Doherty is a famous rock star and drug user in the UK and is credited
for bringing Wat Thamkrabok to the British media's attention.  He stayed at
the temple for three days before fleeing and according to press reports
claimed to have been beaten with bamboo sticks and forced to drink the
medicine that induces vomiting.  I had never heard of him before staying at
the temple and I still know very little about him but I think it is a shame
that he has been so negative about the temple.

The failure of Pete Doherty to quit heroin should be seen as his failure and
not the temples, at least that's my view.  I don't think he gave it a fair
go if he left after just three days; perhaps he was disappointed with the
lack of five star accommodations and the fact that he wasn't treated like a
star.  I can only speculate and maybe I'm wrong about him.  It could easily
be the media who have exaggerated everything he said.

I do know that it was very bad publicity for the temple and I can only hope
that it hasn't turned anyone off going there.  It would be horrible to think
that somebody lost the opportunity to get well because of the story of Pete
Doherty's brief stay there.

There was another source of embarrassment in the form of a popular magazine
whose journalist pretended to be a patient in order to write a story about
how he survived the 'toughest treatment centre in the world'.  The Thai's
are a very honourable people and so would not expect somebody to enter the
temple in order to make a quick buck by making a joke of their hard work.
This article full of photos has probably further damaged the temple's
reputation in the west.

Despite the betrayals and criticism, the temple continues to function and
willingly offer help to those in need because they know their methods work.
When somebody turns up at the temple with the intention of quitting
everything that can be done will be done to help them achieve their goal.

The medicine had worn off and I had managed to eat something.  Despite his
complaints of unbearable withdrawal symptoms Danny had managed to eat a
whole plate of 'Khao Phad' which is a Thai fried rice dish.  Matt didn't
touch any food again and Sharon had managed to eat only a little.

Danny was continuing to argue with anyone who would listen that he needed
his 'stuff' and wanted to leave the temple immediately.  He even threatened
to smash up the restaurant but only managed to half-heartedly throw an empty
plate.  One of the monks informed him that there was no way he could now
leave as the office where his stuff was kept was now closed.

I also tried to explain to him that even if he did get his stuff where was
he going to go?  The temple is in the middle of nowhere with no public
transport nearby and very little traffic.  I doubt even in Thailand that
anybody would stop to give a lift to a foreigner who was so obviously a
junkie; especially when that person was hitching a lift outside a famous
drug treatment centre.

The monks were wisely reacting to Danny's pleas by either ignoring him or
delaying him, something that I have found the Thais to be particularly good
at.  A monk would pass by and Danny would complain that he wanted to leave
right away and needed his belongings.  The monk would listen patiently until
he had finished and then either walk off and ignore him or walk off with the
promise to ask someone more senior but not return.  This continued until
about ten o'clock.

I remember from attempts to detox by myself the temporary relief that comes
when you reach the point in the day when you know that even if you wanted to
you now couldn't get drunk.  This often occurs when it is too late and all
the bars and off-licenses are closed, you know that you have made it for
that day.  The hours of struggling to fight the urge to drink are over for a
while and it is like a great weight has been lifted.  I could see this
happen to Danny.  He suddenly realized that he wasn't going to get anymore
drugs that day and so he gave in.  He decided to stay the night but he would
definitely be leaving in the morning.

As I said we weren't kept prisoner at the temple and if we really wanted we
could leave at anytime.  The gate at the entrance was locked but the wall
was fairly easy to climb and the opposite end of the courtyard wasn't fenced
in.  The reason most of us stayed was because or geographical position and
the state of our lives meant we had nowhere else to go.

BUILDING SANDCASTLES AND KICKING THEM DOWN

When I got back to the room I saw that the two boys were in no mood for
sleep, as they were both sitting up in their beds chatting and joking away
together.  I hadn't slept hardly at all the night before, and felt a bit
exhausted, but I realized there was no point in even trying to sleep until
Matt and Danny had settled down a bit.  I wasn't in the mood for
conversation so I took my book and went out to the back yard where the
toilets and showers were.

On my way out I was cornered by George who was far from happy about the
noise coming from our room and the fact that the light was still on after
ten o'clock.  I wasn't really sure what he wanted me to do about it and
suggested that he have a word with them himself.  He didn't seem willing to
do this and seemed to think that because I also shared the room with them
that I was somehow responsible.  I agreed to have a word with them if it
would keep the peace.

The temple had three dormitories; one for male Thais, one for male
foreigners; and one female.  Our male dormitory was divided into two; the
smaller section was dedicated to us new admissions while the larger section
was for those who had completed the five day course of vomiting.  The
sections were separated by a chalk-wall partition which didn't reach the
roof so wasn't sound proof and the light from our room spilled into the next
and visa versa.  Now that Bill and Joseph had left George had the large room
all to himself while myself Matt and Danny shared the smaller one.

I returned to our room and asked Matt and Danny if they would mind turning
off the light and keeping the noise down as George was trying to sleep.  The
two of them immediately took umbrage accusing me of trying to take away the
only distraction they had from their withdrawals.  I pointed out that I was
just passing on the message.  Danny demonstrated his irritation by shouted
out, 'there is no f**king way I am putting the light out and going to sleep
at ten o'clock and if that grumpy old f**ker doesn't like it he can just go
f**k himself'.  Well I tried and if George wanted to complain again he could
do it himself next time.  I actually think that he should have kept his
annoyance to himself because the complaint had made the two boys nosier if
anything.

I did agree that George could be a bit of a grumpy old git though.  He
reminded me of what my future had in store if I continued to drink and it
didn't quickly kill me.  I met many like him before and he was a product of
the revolving-door policy of treatment centres in the UK.  There are a whole
group of men and women who spend their lives going from treatment centre to
treatment centre with gaps in between in which they rebuild their lives only
to return back to the sewer that is active alcoholism.

It seems to me that addicts and alcoholics love building sand castles and
kicking them down again.  What I mean by this is many will get periods where
they can walk away from addiction and begin rebuilding their lives.  During
this sober time they are extremely productive and amaze people at the huge
change in their whole persona.  Many substance abusers have hidden or
neglected talents which can now blossom.  Their lives continue to get better
and better as time passes, people now respect and admire them instead of
pity and loathe them.  They have regained their self-respect.  Then it
happens.

I call it the 'f**k-it' button.  Life is great but there is a part of us
that misses the excitement of living in despair.  All the horror and
desperation of being an active drunk suddenly doesn't seem so bad.
Rebuilding our lives was great and kept us active but what now?  Our loved
ones long ago stopped praising us for all the progress we have made and now
take it for granted that we are sane productive humans.  We look back at all
our achievements and think how we would previously reward our successes with
a few beers.  We start to miss that reward.

An example of this phenomenon is American painter Jackson Pollock who
managed to quit alcohol for two years and had the most productive period of
his life.  During this time he became famous and produced the art which was
to ensure his place in history.  He was praised by the media who made the
bold claim that Jackson was the greatest American painter in history.

All this acclaim wasn't enough for Jackson Pollock and after two years off
alcohol he returned to the bottle and never managed another period of
sustained sobriety after that.  His art deteriorated, the fans turned to
critics and his health deteriorated.  In a few years he developed ascites
but was spared the misery of death by liver failure when he died in a
drunken car crash aged forty-four.  A passenger in his car also died.  There
is an endless supply of stories like this.

Watching somebody close to you drink or use again, after a long period of
sobriety, must be incredibly hard.  It probably took a long time for trust
to develop and now that trust is smashed and there is no logical explanation
for it.  Why would somebody choose to exchange a happy productive life for
the life of a useless addict?  I am not aware of any sane answer to this
question and can only offer my theory that we enjoy building castles and
kicking them down again.

Inside the mind of a relapsed addict is the conciliatory thought that they
can always stop again when things get bad.  They reason that if they did it
before than of course they can do it again.  This is the most dangerous
delusion that an alcoholic can ever have because they have forgotten that
conditions needed to be a certain way for them to be able to stop the last
time.  There is no guarantee that these conditions will ever arise again and
for many they don't.

It had taken me many years and many failed attempts to reach the gates of
Wat Thamkrabok and when I arrived there I brought with me the willingness to
do absolutely anything to quit alcohol.  I had never been so desperate
before and it was this that allowed the temple to work.  I strongly believe
that it was these two things together that made me recovery possible; the
unique treatment offered by Wat Thamkrabok and my complete surrender to
their program.  The chance of these conditions arising for me again in this
life must be exactly impossible.

While I was with the Alcoholic Recovery Project (ARP) in London I met many
people, who like George, had been in and out of treatment facilities for
thirty years or more.  The ARP is a fantastic organization and I really hope
that it is still up and running and I will always owe it a great debt.  The
problem though is that the ARP, and organizations like it, are open to
abuse.  They are offering services to master manipulators and people who
know the system inside out and also know where the weak points lay.

ARP offers a full rehabilitation package or at least it did twelve years
ago.  The normal procedure was that you entered detox for a month after
which you went to stay in a 'dry house' for a year.  After the year you
received a council flat, which are incredibly hard to come by in London.
All this time you receive long-term sickness benefit and social welfare pays
all your treatment costs.  Many of us were also lucky enough to receive a
transport pass which meant we could travel anywhere in London for free; the
purpose of this was so that we could attend AA meetings.  During the year we
were financed to attend any courses we wanted and encouraged with any hobby
we had an interest in.  The only demands on us are that we remain sober and
attend the in-house meetings and those in the ARP office.

This was a fantastic program because it allowed you to slowly rebuild your
life and insured that everything was in place to make the whole process
easy.  There are enough success stories in my opinion to justify the expense
of ARP and similar recovery programs.

As well as the success stories there were also those who abused the system.
These were people who liked the idea of a council flat and saw it as an
ideal way to get off the streets, save some money and dry out before the
next round on the alcohol.  They would sober up for the year, watch their
health improve, save some money, get a council flat, return to drink, stop
paying bills, end up back on the streets and then repeat the whole process.
It was a very easy cycle to get caught up in.

The majority of relapsers didn't intentionally set out to get locked in the
'revolving door' syndrome they just enjoyed building sand castles and
kicking them down.  Many were institutionalized and just couldn't cope with
life outside the treatment centres.  Some like me just couldn't cope with
life being so good.

THE LONG NIGHT

I stayed out by the showers reading until near midnight before deciding to
give up on my book. I was tired and also fed up with being constantly bitten
by mosquitoes.  On my way back to the room I noted that George was sitting
up in his bed and staring at the partition wall, he seemed to be trying to
mentally will Matt and Danny to shut up. I felt sorry for him because I
could tell that he was a guy who liked things a certain way so this must be
torture.  The light was still on in our room and the two boys were just as
lively as when I had left and they looked like they weren't going to stop
anytime soon.

My only knowledge of 'cold turkey' was what I have seen in the movies such
as 'Trainspotting'; although I have met a few recovering addicts in
treatment.  The picture that I had of the junkie detox process was, a
sweating man, or woman, in obvious pain rolling around on a bed
hallucinating and making the occasional delirious comment.  I had not
expected the people going through 'cold turkey' to be able to give a
continuous running commentary on what they were experiencing and comparing
it with the fellow in the bed across for them.  I had always seen detox as a
solo event and not a group activity.

I wanted to go to sleep but considering the reaction to my last attempt at
quietening things down I decided to not say anything and just let them talk
themselves out.  They had been chatting away for a few hours now and I was
fairly confident that they would soon lose steam.

I started reading my book again but after half an hour I was beginning to
feel desperate for sleep.  I tried to ignore the noise but I just couldn't
stop myself from listening to their conversation, not because it was
interesting but because it was so loud.  The strobe light above the bed was
also beginning to make me feel a bit nauseous.  I was beginning to get
really irritated and so asked them if they would at least turn out the
light.  They reluctantly agreed.

I do enjoy sleeping but I don't think that I am overly concerned with it.  I
have gone long periods without sleep without any noticeable problems, except
perhaps for feeling a bit dopey.  I also worked night shifts for a few years
and can manage with just a few hours during the day.  I have never bothered
with lie-ins except for those occasions when I was to hung-over to get out
of bed, but this was rare as I usually woke up early after heavy drinking so
that I could continue drinking.

I have heard that sleep depravation can drive people insane and I would have
no problem believing this.  Sleep is not something that most people need to
think too much about and we usually just take it for granted.  It is only
when we can't sleep, or get enough sleep, that we really think about it and
realize just how vital it is.  We can then become obsessed by sleep and this
can exacerbate the problem further.  My mother has suffered with insomnia
for years and I have seen how damaging a condition this can be to mental
health.

It was obvious to me that both Matt and Danny were suffering from their
withdrawals.  Danny was not only in the temple to kick heroin but also
methadone, which is apparently far harder to quit and has worse side
effects.  I was told that the temple advises people to get off methadone
treatment before arriving at the temple.  It was now day two for Matt and he
was complaining of terrible cramps while Danny was still in the early stages
of his withdrawals.  In comparison to them my symptoms were very light and
it had been the easiest detox I had ever gone through, at least so far.  I
realized that this talking together was probably helping to distract them a
bit from their problems so decided to leave them to it.

I took my pillow and blanket and moved into the big room with George.  I
could still hear them talking but it was more bearable and I was beginning
to think that I might get a few hours sleep after all.  George wasn't happy
about me being there though as I hadn't completed the five days on the
medicine.  He suggested that I go ask permission from the monks but I wasn't
going to wake them up at one in the morning.  I returned back to the party
room.

It was coming up to two in the morning and it seemed like Matt and Danny
were beginning to settle a bit.  The gaps between their comments were
definitely getting longer.  This reprieve was ruined however when Alex
decided to drop in and pay them a visit.  Apparently he couldn't sleep
either, due to jetlag, and had gone for a walk around the temple.  He had
heard the noise from our room and had decided to check in on us.  The fact
that he could so easily wander into our locked treatment area is further
evidence against those who think that patients are kept at the temple
against their will.

Alex was an ex-patient of Wat Thamkrabok who was doing really well.  He had
managed to get off heroin and had now been clean of all intoxicants for a
couple of years.  He was back in the temple because he had accompanied Matt
and Sharon over from Dublin, where he was also from.  He wanted to use the
opportunity of this return visit to drink as much of the temple tea as
possible as he believed it would help his hepatitis-B.  He was a very
interesting guy with and a good example of how to get off drugs.  I had
chatted to him a few times and he carried a good message.  He was staying in
a room in a different part of the temple as only patients were allowed in
the treatment area.

My heart sank when Alex entered our room.  To be fair he did try and
converse in whispers but at this stage I was annoyed and this only further
irritated me.  I began to childishly give occasional 'tuts' and rustle my
bed sheets but nobody seemed to notice.  If I was more grown up I could have
suggested to Alex that he and the boys conduct his impromptu teaching
session somewhere else but I decided to suffer in silence instead; as
somebody who had spent years of his life drunk I had become accustomed to
playing the victim.

Alex stayed until well after three and the Danny and Matt continued to chat
till daybreak.  At about five in the morning I gave up all hope of getting
any sleep as I now knew that even if I did nod off it would be fairly
pointless as I needed to get up to sweep at six.  It was at this stage that
the two of them went to sleep.

I tried to avoid George as we both went out to sweep.  I was sure that he
saw me as partly responsible for the noise due to staying in the same room,
guilt by association.  As I began to sweep I was amazed to find that I
didn't really feel that tired and anyway it wasn't like I had work to go
to.  The long night was over and I was beginning to feel positive again.

MEDITATION

At breakfast time Sharon informed us that Phra Hans, the Swiss monk, was
willing to provide meditation sessions if we were interested.  I was
delighted with this, as I had already decided that meditation was to be an
important of my recovery.  I had seen what a powerful tool meditation could
be and was convinced that not only would it keep me away from alcohol but
more importantly give my life meaning and purpose.

As I mentioned previously, I had first began meditating at about fourteen
years of age whilst learning Kung Fu but the practice fell away as I stopped
martial arts and began my drinking career.

In my teens I had some, what I consider now to be, strange ideas about
meditation. I liked to completely stop all thinking as I believed the
emptiness was exactly like death and that if I could do it often enough my
fear of death would fall away.  I also had the typical teenage fantasies of
meditation giving me supernormal powers and I suppose I must have
occasionally wished that I could use these powers to get lots of
girlfriends.  Importantly though it helped me cope in the early stages of my
parents break-up but unfortunately as the marriage further fell apart so did
my meditation practice.

During the sober times of the next seventeen years I would often return to
meditation in one form or another.  These periods of practice were too brief
to provide much benefit but my belief in the potential of meditation never
wavered.  I also practiced Thai-Chi, a type of moving meditation, during the
two sober years I had in London.

Two and a half years prior to my attending Wat Thamkrabok I had revived my
interest in meditation by attending another temple, called Wat Rampoeng in
Chiang Mai Thailand, for a twenty-six day meditation retreat.  It had been
my hope at the time that this retreat would cure me of my alcohol problem
and I suppose it did; it just took a lot longer for it to work than what I
had expected it to.

The meditation course at Wat Rampoeng was intensive and was based on the
Mahasi technique of Mahasi Sayadaw, who was a Burmese monk.  The meditation
involves both sitting and walking practice and focuses on the four
foundations of mindfulness.  During sitting practice you use the rise and
fall of the abdomen, as well as touch points around the body, as an anchor
to which you return after acknowledging when the mind wanders.  The walking
meditation involves mentally noting the slow movements of the foot; rising,
lifting, moving, lowering, touching and putting.
