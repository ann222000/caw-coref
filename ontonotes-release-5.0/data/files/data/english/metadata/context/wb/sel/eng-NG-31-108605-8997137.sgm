Yikes.

Wikipedia is wrong about the testing for Lyme.

And I am tired of straightening everyone out.

It's simple and you can see it with your own
eyeballs in the RICO complaint:
http://www.actionlyme.org/USDOJ_COMPLAINT_RICO.htm

But there's a lot more substantiating data from the crooks
in the Right Nav Bar,

ALL FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Save it all to your drives.

What would be great for us biological science morons is the
following:  Could you go through your info on diagnostic testing---and
pretend that you do not know much about biololgical or chemical
science. Then..... Try to SIMPLIFY each essential concept so that an
intelligent  non scientist like myself can understand it.

What I understand so far (correct me if I am wrong) about the flaw in
the diagnostic test is-- (this is my humble understanding....:
The process starts as follows: (pictures would really help here)

1)  A European borrelia spirochete was zapped with electricity,
causing it to break up into its component proteins--- each of which
had a different molecular weight which corresponded to a &quot;band.&quot;
2)  The different weighted proteins were then arranged  like pretty
maids all in a row according to their weights.
3)  These proteins were then &quot;blotted&quot; onto a piece of paper or nylon,
arranged according to their weight, from lightest to heaviest.
4) A person infected in New York has their blood brushed onto  the
&quot;blot&quot; to see if his or her blood reacts to any of the European
borrelia proteins?  (Sounds dumb already....Why not use a New York
borrelia strain????)

5) If your blood's antibodies  aggregate on a particular protein in
the lineup, it means that you have antibodies to that protein and it
&quot;lights up &quot;  in a &quot;band&quot;  by its weight number.
5.5) Band 42 corresponds to the flagella(wiggly tail)  of ALL
spirochetes, so its not unique to Lyme- since some gum diseases are
spirochete organisms.
6) Weight number 31 (that skinny little protein) is unique to Lyme---
it corresponds to borrelia's Outer Surface Protein A, or OspA.  THis
protein is essential to borrelia and may have  to do with Lyme
arthritis.
7) NOW LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT-- BAND 31 was excluded  from the test
as a measure of infection?  Why?
8) A synthetic version of the OspA (our friend band 31) WAS included
as a part of  the failed Lymerix vaccine  -- presumably because it was
central to creating a Lyme immune response--- but was NOT considered
central in the diagnostic test?

Help me here-- perhaps we could write a simpltons book with pictures
etc that explain the whole process ---- thereby revealing the fraud in
a simple, but accurate  way?

LETS COMMUNICATE THIS TO A BROADER, LESS SCIENTIFIC  AUDIENCE!

Thanks

Hi Kathleen--

THanks again for all of your work on our behalf.  If you would like to
work with me to produce a video  that could translate the complex into
the simple -- -- I have experience with video creation and multimedia
and would love to do the job.  You could provide the science... I
could translate it down to its most basic level-- with flashy graphics
and interviews.  This would de-ghetoize your information-- anbd would
greatly frighten our opponents.  THese guys are so happy to see your
information ghetto-ized.  They are laughing all the way to the bank..

Your ability to understand this fraud is preciesely why you are so
VALUABLE to the broader Lyme community....BUT, your presentation is
difficult for laymen to understand-- precisely because you understand
all the technical details and complex history ----at the genius
level..

We desperately need a  slick PR person who can who can TRANSLATE  your
truthful science into a killer book, or a flashy video or a Powerpoint
presentatation that other academics, writers and journalists can
readily understand so that we can all respond to the scientific phony
baloney &quot;peer review&quot; RICO fraud -----with confidence.

WE need to be able to eviscerate their pseudo scientific arguments--
and LOTS of people need to be able to fight this fight!!! So.. when
they claim that you are nuts, or I am an obsessed Lyme activist--- 50
more people can come forward with your knowledge...to edit WIkipedia,
write articles on the web and correct -- or at least counter--- the
PAID dis-information campaign.....

Personally, right now, I don't feel as confident as I would like in
explaining the fraud  issue to those less informed than me.   I'm
trying, but perhaps I will have  to actually create a teaching  video
to educate myself...

I'm talking about a video that we can show to housewives like my
lawyer neighbor who has Bell's palsy and a child with stunted growth,
but she does not know the first thing about Lyme because of the
censorship and cover up in the broader media...  They have done such a
masterful spin job on us -- it is sickening.

We need to be able to spin back with our own slick propaganda based on
facts-- designed to make people angry when they understand the
deception!!  ALSO WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER--  THIS
IS THEIR CLASSIC CONTROL STRATEGY.....

Our opponents are spending  big bucks on droves of PAID  editors at
Wikipedia to keep the truth away from the American people.  Sites like
Lymenet seem to be taken over by users who do not really want to know
the issues--- with some users actually getting offended when a post
exceeds a certain length.  THis makes it really hard to get our
message out........ sadly this is why it has to be DUMBED DOWN.....

WE need to create an Alex Jones type of video like Terrorstorm-- we
need a fancy, well produced video that captures the attention of
people including congressmen and senators.... we need a video that
ranks on Google  (although google is for the most part censored,
also)... we need an educational tool that counters the propaganda
pumped out by CDC,  Mead and the New York Times, etc.

Your site is incredibly brilliant and valuable-- but I fear that their
strategy has been to ghetto-ize you- so that the info does not reach a
broader audience-- such as WIki.

We MUST reach a broader audience.  WE MUST make more in the Lyme
community focus not on  wallowing in self pity-- but instead, focus on
DOING SOMETHING TO COUNTER THEIR DISINFORMATION. WE MUST EMPOWER LYME
VICTIMS With KNOWLEDGE.

WE MUST make Lyme victims understand that they are exhuasted and
tired and confused because they have, in part,  been LIED to by the
government. Most victims do not understand this yet.... It is our job
to communicate it.

Thanks again, and lets stick together and use all our talents inh
synergy to bring this truth out.

Well, I tried to do the videos in the order that would
help everyone understand the crime:
http://www.actionlyme.org/YOUTUBEVIDEOS.htm

The first part is What is Meant by &quot;SCIENTIFICALLY VALID?&quot;
Yale has a scientifically valid test according to FDA rules for a
method validation:
SENSITIVITY
SPECIFICITY
ACCURACY
RUGGEDNESS
PRECISION
LINEARITY in and out of MATRIX
Limit of Detection or Limit of Quantitation.

This is what I did in the lab every single day of my life for the last
8 years I worked at Pfizer.

Yale owns the patent for the only scientifically valid antibody test
for Lyme, since they made 41 SPECIFIC, it is the EARLIEST TEST (could
detect ALS before it becomes ALS, so we are talking negligent homicide
for not using it), and it is the most ACCURATE (detects 17/18 or 94.4%
of all Lyme cases)

The CLAIM of the patent (5,618,533) is actually a validation of the
method.

So this is undeniable and anyone could be brought in from the FDA's
Bioanalytics Division to be asked if this is correct, should there be
a trial and/or a Congressional Hearing.

Yale staff will then be asked &quot;WHY AREN'T YOU USING THIS METHOD?&quot;
And then indicted for negligent homicide.

The second part Markers of Disease.
The bad guys say we're nuts and deploy the psychiatric non-scientists
to imaginate the cause of our symptoms.  Insurance companies know the
value of psychiatric idiots who make up their imaginary bullshit and
never run any medical tests.

Part IIA is Klempner's secret Multiple Sclerosis haplotype: HLA-
DQB1*0602.
NINDS' Roland Martin found the first one.  That is why he was
recruited to work at the NIH from Germany, just like Willy Burgdorfer
was recruited from Switzerland to work in US Bioweapons at the Rocky
Mountains bioweapons lab (which was about to have a moat dug around
it, but I understand they never finished that project).

Part III demonstrates how psychiatry is not a medical practice and
that it is malpractice to treat Lyme brain with psychotropics.  So, in
deploying the psychiatric idiots upon us, the bad guys cause us double
brain damage, since the standard of care for a delirium - in
particular *this* delirium - is ceftriaxone, even according to the
psychiatric idiots.

The NOT-standard of care is psychotropics, even according to the
psychiatric idiots.

Part IV is all the RICO patents; There are 6 main ones that really are
the essence of the crime.

Part V is UCONN's abuse of Czech children- giving them a vaccine that
they knew would do them no good, just to see how bad would be the
adverse events.  This would be considered &quot;assault&quot; in the USA.

Then I put all the bad guys reports which they refuse to give to
Richard Blumenthal in the right hand navigation bar, since this is
hilarious and this is everyone's data, since you all paid for it.

There must be 50 reports by the bad guys that they don't want people
to know about.

I will be adding to them, but I am sick and have MS and it is too hot
to move, if you know what I mean...

When you have MS you can't take the heat, and as you can see from my
tests, I have the MS kind of Lyme:
http://www.actionlyme.org/JAMES_PHILLIPS_HOMEPAGE.htm

And that my kids test positive for Lyme and Ehrlichiosis and that this
is CONGENITAL:
http://www.actionlyme.org/Schoen.htm

That clearly all happened before they bagged me.

I would be happy to try to make it simpler, but I don't know how.
This is a visual thing,  You have to look at the graphics and watch
what I do in the videos with &quot;Mr. Panda.&quot;

You all are welcome to do whatever you like with the data-

You paid for this research;  It's yours.

Kathleen
