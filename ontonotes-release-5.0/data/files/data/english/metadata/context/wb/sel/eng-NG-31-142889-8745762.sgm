---------------------  DON'T LOOK NOW, BUT  ...

Mighty Russia, led by Vlad &quot;The Ultimate Winner&quot; Putin, has &quot;grabbed&quot;
a vast portion of the North Pole and its over- and underwater
environs.

Many observers say that in this day and age, &quot;this can't happen!&quot;

But it has.

And no matter what the U.S., Canada, Norway, and Sweden say, in
reality, there's now nothing short of war that'll change things.

But it will interesting to see what happens when one or more of these
onlookers tries to drill within the Russian &quot;boundary.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Russia's Deep-Sea Flag-Planting at North Pole Strikes a Chill in
Canada&quot;&quot;

By Doug Struck

Tuesday, August 7, 2007; A08

TORONTO, Aug. 6 -- A dramatic submarine dive to plant the Russian flag
on the seabed at the North Pole last week has rattled Canadian
politics and underscored the growing stakes as the ice cap melts in
the oil-rich Arctic.

Canada and the United States scoffed at the legal significance of the
dive by a Russian mini-sub to set the flag on the seabed Thursday.
&quot;This isn't the 15th century. You can't go around the world and just
plant flags&quot; to claim territory, Canada's minister of foreign affairs,
Peter MacKay, told reporters.

But the government here has been thrown on the defensive by the
Russian action, accused by critics of doing too little to meet a
deadline for the five Arctic nations to map and claim huge areas of
the Arctic seabed.

A U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker left Seattle on Monday for an area 500
miles north of Barrow, Alaska, where a contingent of 20 scientists are
to continue compiling an undersea map in preparation for a U.S. claim
of the resources there.

Canada has not equipped itself to do the same. It has no icebreakers
heavy enough to tackle the Arctic ice head-on.

In the view of opposition leader Jack Layton, head of the New
Democratic Party, the government has responded with little more than
rhetoric to threats to Canadian sovereignty in its frozen backyard.
&quot;Canada must move quickly and make immediate, strategic investments in
its Arctic,&quot; Layton said Sunday.

The 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea gives each of the five
Arctic nations -- Canada, the United States, Russia, Denmark and
Norway -- 10 years after their ratification of the treaty to map out
the Arctic seabed.

The maps, along with sediment samples and other scientific
information, can be used to claim parts of the seabed that are
extensions of the continental shelf of each nation. The claim would
apply to the buried resources, not to the water above.

For years, progress under the international treaty was slow. The
United States has not ratified the convention, though observers expect
that to happen soon under the Democratic-controlled Congress. Global
warming has added a sudden urgency to the process by thinning the
Arctic ice cap, making drilling and shipping more feasible.

The potential rewards are great. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates
that 25 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas lies in the
Arctic.

&quot;The huge irony is that we are only talking about this because
humanity has burned so much oil and gas that the ice is melting,&quot; said
Michael Byers, an international law expert at the University of
British Columbia in Vancouver. &quot;It could be a vicious cycle: Climate
change is opening up the Arctic to oil and gas drilling, which almost
certainly will cause more climate change.&quot;

Russia, the first of the Arctic nations to ratify the treaty, has
undertaken extensive mapping using its huge nuclear-powered
icebreakers. Norway and Denmark have also conducted undersea mapping.
Canada, which ratified the treaty in 2003, is cooperating with Denmark
on the ice northeast of Ellesmere Island, setting off explosives to
seismically map the ground under the Lincoln Sea region of the Arctic
Ocean.

The United States has been mapping the Chukchi Cap area since 2003,
according to Larry Mayer, director of the Center for Coastal and Ocean
Mapping at the University of New Hampshire. That area is not expected
to conflict with Russian claims, he said.

Mayer, who will join the icebreaker USCGC Healy as chief scientist,
said the U.S. mapping effort will be greatly aided by sonar mapping
done by U.S. Navy nuclear submarines that routinely cruised under the
Arctic cap during the Cold War. That classified information has
gradually been made public for scientists' use, Mayer said.

Canada historically has considered much of the North American side of
the frozen Arctic its territory and bristles at U.S. claims that the
thawing Northwest Passage through that area is an international
strait. Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who is to tour Arctic
communities this week, has called the Arctic &quot;central to our identity
as a northern nation.&quot;

But Canada has no northern deep-sea port and no submarines capable of
traveling under the Arctic cap; its aging icebreakers were built for
work on the Arctic's edges and in the St. Lawrence Seaway. It has a
minimal military presence in the north and counts on the traditional
presence of the native Inuit people to bolster its claims to the
thousands of scattered islands that make up the Canadian archipelago.

Layton said Canada's larger problem is its failure to try to stop the
warming that is opening up the Arctic. &quot;Climate change policy is
northern policy, and we have no time to waste,&quot; he said.

Planting a flag on something does not mean you own it.
Does the US own the moon?
