[This post is cross-posted to a bunch of groups that don't normally go
together (rec.antiques plus anyone I thought might regularly deal with
ammonium nitrate and metal). Please post newsgroup-specific follow-ups
to just that group.]

So, here's a poser of a question: how do I get ammonium nitrate
crystals out of my typewriter (an unusual ca. 1900 understrike with
6-row duplex keyboard) without further damaging the pine, steel, tin,
and lacquer paint it's sitting on?

The chemical got there when my cat mangled a cold pack on the shelf
above the typewriter; a little bit of the ammonium nitrate/water
solution from the cold pack dripped into the keyboard, then the water
evaporated away leaving tracks and drips of white powder and crystal
blooms and film on bits of my typewriter.

I don't know how long it's been there, probably a couple months. It's
all quite dry now. Where it's sitting on tin, the tin is very rusty.
Where it's sitting on steel there is a little bit of white powder
corrosion at the edges. The paint and wood seem unaffected. I'm
afraid that if I get the ammonium nitrate wet with water again, it
will rapidly resume corroding the metal.

What is the best non-reactive solvent for cleaning ammonium nitrate
off of metal? Does it hurt wood or paint? (I can't take the
typewriter apart enough to scrub it without damaging the typewriter --
I'm going to need to swab off the inside as best I can with q-tips,
but the ammonium nitrate has to really /want/ to dissolve if I'm going
to get it all.)

Thanks a lot for any help. I'm really sad to see my poor typewriter
corroding.

All I can think of is alcohol, which won't dissolve it but should flush it
out without doing too much harm.

Another alternative is flushing the whole thing in de-ionised water, and
then drying somewhere fairly warm with low humidity.

Or better yet, de-ionised water, then flush out the water with alcohol, then
dry it.

"/> Here's my advice, and someone else may have better.

1. Get rid of as much of the dry residue as you can by simply brushing
and blowing it away. Any partial disassembly of your typewriter that
you can safely do will help in this and subsequent stages. Consider
taping some narrow flexible tubing to a vacuum cleaner fitting to help
get the stuff out, and keep it under control (don't let it go just
anywhere, you want to be rid of it).

Run the next few steps in rapid succession to limit the damage:

2. Wash it out with water.

3. Get rid of as much of the water as you can with alcohol. Caution:
the alcohol will damage any laquer or laquer-based paints. Methanol or
ethanol will work slightly better than isopropyl alcohol, but that
will do the job.

4. Blow dry with the exhaust from your vacuum cleaner (or a hair
dryer, or whatever source of air you can provide).

This procedure may further damage your typewriter, but when it's done,
it's done. The situation you have now will result in continuing
damage, as the nitrate crystals will continue to pull water out of
moist air, and damage will continue indefinitely.

Just out of idle curiousity, why can't you disassemble the typewriter?
I saw your appeal in rec.crafts.metalworking, and it's hard for us to
imagine this being much of a problem...

"/> Here is how I would do it:

1) remove all the wooden parts. Clean them using a cloth dampened with
water and immediately wiped dry after the cleaning.

2) Wash the rest with water, then dry in a low temperature oven. If the
metal parts are not painted or lacquered, then you can use a higher temp.

3) Re-oil any necessary pivot points and replace the case.

You could try drying it with alcohol, as others have suggested, but
the alcohol might attack the lacquer. You would need to do some
careful tests.

I would flush it generously with water - corrosion is not instantaneous, and
yes, amm nitrate really really does want to dissolve in water - drain,swab
the water away as far as possible and rinse the last drops of water off with
isopropanol, and dry with hair dryer. WD40 might be preferred to
isopropanol, if its possible to swab away the oily residue.
Oh yes, take the ribbon out first!

I cleaned up an old teletype once, which was just only gummy with
old lube and dust; and as my final piece de resistance, sprayed
it with WD40. It gummed it up worse than it was before. Don't spray
WD40 on anything that has delicate moving parts. I had to clean it
all over again, using isopropyl and a typewriter brush, and then
when I finally got it clean again, I put a few drops of sewing
machine oil on the motor, and left the rest dry. It worked.

IOW, DO NOT use WD40. Flood it with water, and put the vacuum
cleaner hose on the output side to blow it dry - a hair dryer will
never give you the airspeed you need. But NH4NO3 sould wash away
just fine with plain water. If you want to get really classy,
you can use deionized (soft) water, or if you want to impress
your friends, you can use club soda - when I was a video game/
pinball machine repairman, we used to use club soda (carbonated
water) to wash the crud off the circuit boards that they always
incurred operating out in public. (e.g., somebody'd spill a beer
down into the buttons on the machine, it'd malfunction, the
operator would bring it into the shop, and we'd spray the contacts
and wash the circuit board with a seltzer bottle.) If that doesn't
de-crud it, I'd say the strongest you'd want to go would be
isopropyl.

But DO NOT SPRAY ANYTHING AS DELICATE AS A TYPEWRITER WITH WD40!!!
It'll gum it up and you'll have a whole nother repair problem on
your hands!

The least invasive, most effective solvent for cleaning delicate
mechanical and electronic devices is -- distilled water with a little
non-ionic surfactant added. Photograhic wetting agents work well for the
surfactant. (Kodak Photo-Flo concentrate)

I still remember with glee the look on my boss's face in 1968 when he
'caught' me dunking a Hewlet-Packard oscilloscope into a 55 gallon drum
of suds! A good 'shooshing' in the water, along with about 96 hours of
drying in a 150F oven cured all the zaps, pops, and arc-over problems the
'scope was having.

Water might not be _good_ for your wooden parts (and the ubiquitous PAPER
cushions common in some old office machines), but it's got to be a lot
less harmful than AN corrosion.

The person asked for a non-reactive solution.

Like Lloyd said, distilled water (deionized if possible) would be the
best method - followed by drying in an oven at low heat.

"/> I encountered this when I left a couple small stones in a tin covered
with 3-36. As the 3-36 evaporated over several months it left a waxy-
gooey residue on the stones. After I took the stones out I left the
remaining 3-36 uncovered and as it evaporated more it left behind a soft
congealed mass. I suppose it could have been a reaction with old oil
coming out of the stones, but the volume of the goo was certainly much
greater than what could have been in the stones.

I keep them in mineral oil now.

Cut and pasted:

Ozone generators that are sold as air cleaners intentionally
produce the gas ozone. Often the
vendors of ozone generators make statements and distribute
material that lead the public to
believe that these devices are always safe and effective in
controlling indoor air pollution. For
almost a century, health professionals have refuted these claims
(Sawyer, et. al 1913; Salls,
1927; Boeniger, 1995; American Lung Association, 1997; Al-Ahmady,
1997). The purpose of this
document is to provide accurate information regarding the use of
ozone-generating devices in
indoor occupied spaces. This information is based on the most
credible scientific evidence
currently available.

Some vendors suggest that these devices have been approved by the
federal government for use
in occupied spaces. To the contrary, NO agency of the federal
government has approved these
devices for use in occupied spaces. Because of these claims, and
because ozone can cause
health problems at high concentrations, several federal government
agencies have worked in
consultation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to
produce this public information
document.

The basic document tends to say (sorta) that ozone creation devices are more
or less worthless.
I like the list of potential health problems too. :)

"/> An ion is basically a charged particle. Because the particle contains a charge,
it can easily react with other particles. The problem with regular water, as
opposed to deionized, are the trace amounts of contaminants and byproducts of
chlorination with can interfere with the use of water.

in the air you breath. It is a lung irritatant that can be dangerous to
asmathics and people with respiratory problems.

If it is producing ozene, get rid of that sucker. It's worse than second-hand
cigarette smoke.

Hi
Ions in air are thing looking to chemically attach to something.
Ozone will attach to the oxygen carrying chemicals in your blood.
This reduces the amount of oxygen the your blood can carry.
Ions in water are a different thing. Most any kind of salt ( not
just table salt ) will split into ions in water. This is because
of the polar nature of water ( a good thing or we would exist in
out current form ). When the water evaporates, the salts recombine
to form crystals. Hard water is mostly calcium salts ( actually
good to drink but doesn't taste particularly good in tea ). These
tend to form hard to remove crystals on surfaces when drying ( water
spots ). De-ionizing the water precipitates or grabs these ions
out of the water. This isn't pure water yet but the remaining
contaminates are mostly nonionic volatiles. For the least contaminated
water, distilled is best.
With the latest kick for drinking purified water, many may be
doing themselves damage. It has been shown in several studies
that some of the trace elements in drinking water tend to help
prevent heart problems. The calcium in hard water is yet another
good source for this mineral that is usually missing in many
diets. Well water can be bad for you, though. Some minerals
are toxic in any concentration. Others are needed in small
amounts but toxic in large amounts. No easy answers.

"/> Thank you to Andy, Allison &amp; Derek, Susan, and Dwight for your responses.

The EPA page on ozone generators (thanks, A&amp;D) is appropriately frightening.

The device I have does not produce ozone specifically to be useful as an air
purifier (which the EPA says is ineffective anyway); it produces ozone as a
by-product of the ionizing function which actually is quite effective in
cleaning the air. (I have run this thing for a little while now, and I've seen
what it pulls out of even normal indoor air. Yikes.) One would think that it
produces less ozone than a device designed for the primary purpose of producing
ozone, but who knows if that's true. I'll look at the manufacturer's info
packet again. But it is still producing at least a little ozone, and, as they
say, better safe than coughing your lungs up. I'm sending the derned thang
back.

A guy I know said that the EPA is &quot;overreacting yet again,&quot; and he bubbles
ozone up into his hot tob in lieu of more toxic bacteria-killing chemicals.
(Hmm, why haven't I been invited to his hot tub recently? But I digress.) I
think I've finally reached an age at which I'm more inclined to believe the EPA
than sexy guys with hot tubs.

Thank you again, folks.
