&gt;NIGGANOMETRY

&gt;1. Easy E and his friend, M.C. Ren, went to the corner store to buy a
&gt;pack of Old English Soda Pop. If the Soda cost $3.85 and between the
&gt;two old friends they had a ten dollar bill, how much change would they
&gt;receive.

&gt;2. E-40 was concerned with his friend, Too-Short's dental problems so
&gt;E-40 decided to buy Too Short his missing teeth. If a set of dentures
&gt;cost 560 dollars, and E-40 has 332 dollars, does E-40 have enough
&gt;money. If E-40 does not have enough money, how much more do he need.

&gt;3. Ice Cube was looking to shoot his new video from his next album, &quot;I
&gt;Know I'm Just a Has-Been Studio Gangsta,&quot; and he had 72 dollars to
&gt;complete his video. If Ice Cube was using 6 dollar bills to pay his
&gt;staff on a daily basis, how many jigaboos does he have working for
&gt;him. (The key is dividing 72 by 6.)

&gt;4. Mack 10 was driving down the strip in his Cutlass sitting on a
&gt;brand new set of Daytons listening to his West Side Connection tape
&gt;when one of his four huge speakers blew out. If one of Mack 10's
&gt;speakers cost 7 dollars, how much do 4 cost. (The key is
&gt;multiplication.)

&gt;5. Dodo Stain and Nappy were best friends who each weighed 500 pounds
&gt;apiece. Everybody at their work said they were fat slobs so they
&gt;decided to lose some weight, so they could go to the local clubs and
&gt;&quot;mack&quot; to all the local mommies in town. If both men vowed to lose 20
&gt;pounds each week, how many pounds would they lose in 3 months? What
&gt;will be their combined weight after the 3 months?

&gt;6. Biggie Little was a rapper who was 2 feet tall and had an ashy
&gt;forehead. If Biggie needed to grow another 4 feet to be taken serious
&gt;in the rap game, and there was a doctor who charged 2 dollars an inch,
&gt;how much money would Biggie Little have to spend to grow the extra 4
&gt;feet? There are 12 inches in a foot.

&gt;7. Dapper Dan was a nigga who took great pride in his Tuff Skin
&gt;polyester suits. He owned 9 of them in all different colors. If Dapper
&gt;Dan's wife left him because he treated her bad and his feet smelled,
&gt;and when she left she took 3 of his Tuff Skin suits, how many does he
&gt;have left? If each suit cost 15 dollars, how much will it cost to
&gt;replace the stolen suits?

This test is an effort to eliminate the cultural factor in testing.
