As explained by Krum at &quot;The Wedding&quot; the pendant Xeno Lovegood wore around
his neck was &quot;Grindelwald's Sign.&quot;  It so infuriated Krum so that he was
ready to duel Xeno right then and there, if he wasn't one of Fluer's wedding
guest.

However it was also the symbol of the Deathly Hollows long before it was
Grindelwald's sign.  Grindrlwald's evil may have forever changed the way
many wizards (like Krum) react to the Deathly Hollow's symbol.

Same for the Swastika, it was a Hindu symbol of good fortune and well-being
long before Hitler and the Nazi's change it to a symbol of evil as well.
Many people in the muggle world would react the same way to someone wearing
a swastika as Krum did to Xeno, and for similar reasons.

So the sign of the Deathly Hollows and the Swastika have seem to befall to
similar fates.

There was a large bank branch somewhere in London, built well before
the 1930s, that had a swastika mosaic built into the floor.
Apparently, it has only been removed in the last year.

Rowling has previously admitted to intentional parallelism between
Grindelwald and Hitler, so yes, their symbols too would show similarities.

As a matter of vague interest, I came across a paraphrased Cezanne
quotation yesterday that made me say &quot;hmm&quot;:

&quot;Treat nature by means of the cylinder, the sphere, the
cone...everything brought into proper perspective... directed to a
central point.&quot;

The wand, the stone, the cloak?  The philosophico-literary ramifications
are rife!

A googlepause reveals the ellipses suppress mundaneity:

Cézanne to Emile Bernard, 15 April 1904
&quot;May I repeat what I told you here: treat nature by means of the
cylinder, the sphere, the cone, everything brought into proper
perspective so that each side of an object or a plane is directed
towards a central point. Lines parallel to the horizon give breadth...
lines perpendicular to this horizon give depth. But nature for us men is
more depth than surface, whence the need to introduce into our light
vibrations, represented by the reds and yellows, a sufficient amount of
blueness to give the feel of air.&quot;

Oh well, it was interesting while it lasted.

Yes, as I understand it, the word &quot;Swastika&quot; is Sanscrit. Used in Buddhism a lot. You
see the &quot;correct&quot; swastika image (not the Nazi &quot;reverse mirror image&quot;)  at very many
Buddhist shrines in Asia etc. Kinda throws you if you're not carefull or don't recognize
it as such.

I always thought the &quot;dark mark&quot; to be more closely related to the Swastika. Consider the parallel
in GOF just after the Quidditch world cup when the death eaters reaked havoc in the camp. That
whole scene brought such events as &quot;KristalNacht&quot; to mind, and Barty Crouch Jr.'s conjuring the
dark mark for all to see seems remenicent of Nazi supporters etc. defacing property etc. with their
swastika after plundering through a neighborhood.

But there's nothing stopping her from having two symbols and two meanings.

I always saw the &quot;Dark Mark&quot; to be more like the Nazi SS &quot;Death's Head&quot; the
SS used as a coat of arms.  Many SS Troopers had it tattooed on their arms
as a symbol they killed a Jew or an enemy of the Reich.   They even look
similar, just no snake.

And I agree that the riot after the Quidditch World Cup did seem similar to
&quot;KristalNacht&quot; in many ways.

Good points. However, the Swastika in Buddhism, Buddhist shrines, and other
places in Asia can have the arms point left or right, and that was the case
historically. What is unique about the symbol of the National Socialist
German Workers' Party is that it is squared on the arms/corners, but it was
eventually turned 45 degrees to the horizontal (to highlight the S-shape)
and always pointed in the S-direction (not the Z-direction) because they
used it sometimes to symbolize meshed S-letters for &quot;Socialism&quot; under the
National Socialist German Workers' Party (e.g. on their main flag). The rune
comment is correct, because the German Socialists also used it to resemble
the rune that corresponds to the S-letter, as they also did for the S.S.
Division with its alphabetical meaning. Similar alphabetical symbolism can
still be seen every day on Volkswagens, as the swastika-style VW logo /
emblem (using meshed letters). Those are all discoveries of the noted
historian Dr. Rex Curry (author of &quot;Swastika Secrets&quot;)
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

Don't fall for common errors. Remember, the &quot;Nazis&quot; did not call themselves
&quot;Nazis.&quot;  They also did not call their symbol a &quot;swastika.&quot;  They used a
word that classified their symbol as a type of cross.

Many people overuse the word &quot;Nazi&quot; because they do not know the
actual name of the group: the National Socialist German Workers Party
(NSGWP). Other people overuse the shorthand term to deliberately cover-
up the group's actual name, in order to rehabilitate socialism.  Most
people do not know that &quot;Nazis&quot; did not call themselves &quot;Nazis&quot; (they
called themselves socialists). The same people are unaware that German
socialists did not call their symbol a &quot;swastika.&quot;  They perpetuate
two more myths: (1) That the swastika, as an ancient symbol and as a
Sanskrit word, represented the opposite of German socialism; (2) That
&quot;Aryan,&quot; from the ancient Sanskrit concept, retained no conceptual
relevance for German socialists. http://rexcurry.net/swastika.html

The ancient term &quot;swastika&quot; is often translated as &quot;good luck&quot; or
&quot;well being&quot; or &quot;auspicious.&quot;  The symbologist and etymologist Dr. Rex
Curry has pointed out that the Sanskrit concept of &quot;good luck&quot; fit the
National Socialist view (and every socialist's view, even today) of
socialism.

&quot;Swastika&quot; and &quot;Aryan&quot; were conceptually related in Sanskrit, long
before the NSGWP existed. People who oversimplify &quot;swastika&quot; as &quot;good
luck&quot; also oversimplify the word &quot;Aryan.&quot; In Sanskrit, &quot;Swastika&quot; had
a similar meaning to the word &quot;Aryan,&quot; because both included the sense
of &quot;fortunate&quot; or &quot;favored&quot; as in a favored person, who belonged to a
fortunate caste, class, or race. &quot;Aryan&quot; is probably related to the
aristoi, the &quot;most noble,&quot; of Greece (Aristotle, aristocracy,
aristocrat). The related concept of &quot;arch&quot; creates nouns that signify
people and groups having authority over others of their class
(archbishop; archdiocese; archangel; archenemy, archrival) or
&quot;exemplary&quot; (archetype).  Aryan probably included &quot;accomplished,
skillful.&quot; The original meaning of the root, pertaining to &quot;skillful
assembly&quot; or &quot;union&quot; might be seen in Latin ars &quot;art,&quot; and &quot;architect&quot;
and ordo  (&quot;order&quot;).  The term &quot;Aryan&quot; is related to the word
&quot;Iranian&quot; (Iran or Persia).

Professor Curry has shown that the Sanskrit term &quot;swastika&quot; did not
merely mean &quot;good luck&quot; in the modern sense, as is often said. For the
higher classes (and for those who dreamed or aspired) the symbol meant
that it was &quot;good luck&quot; to be in a high caste / race (read that as
&quot;Aryan class&quot;) and not the low class / race. In that way, the sanskrit
concept is not dis-similar from the German Socialist use.

It is often said that German National Socialists altered (and ruined)
the &quot;good luck&quot; meaning of the symbol from its history in India and
Asia. That leaves a lot out of the complete story.

If swastikas had any &quot;Aryan&quot; etymology in the minds of German
socialists, it was a common dictionary's second meaning: &quot;noble&quot; or
&quot;high rank.&quot; They used it to mean a &quot;master race&quot; or &quot;noble class&quot; or
&quot;ruling class.&quot;  The swastika became an emblem for the cockamamy
&quot;super socialist man.&quot; http://rexcurry.net/george-bernard-shaw-superman-socialist-swastika-s...

The swastika was sometimes used as alphabetical symbolism of
overlapping S-letters for &quot;socialism&quot; under the National Socialist
German Workers Party. It was turned 45 degrees to the horizontal (to
highlight the S-letter) and oriented in the S-direction.

In that way, the swastika did not change from a good-luck symbol for
German socialists and their admirers. But for some of the world, the
symbol became a bad-luck symbol for &quot;socialism.&quot;

It is also consistent with India's historic socialism and, as a
cosequence, its historic levels of poverty and misery.

It is consistent with the dogma of a mystical India-Germany promoter
of National Socialism known as Savitri Devi. Known as the &quot;Aryan Hindu
prophetess,&quot; she authored a lengthy examination of the Hindu theory of
cyclical history that included Hitler was an avatar or god come to
earth.  Born Maximiani Portas, she became a strong admirer of Hitler
in the 1920s, moved to India in 1932 because of its caste segregation
system, and took a Hindu name. Later, her writings were republished,
and she gained new fans in the 1970s as new interest in National
Socialism spread. Devi died in 1982, but the author boasted that her
combination of Hindu religion and Nordic racial ideology became a
bridge between National Socialism and the New Age movements. It was
not the culture of India that drew Devi, but her belief that India
represented the best of racial segregation. Once in India, she became
interested in Hinduism and wed the Brahman A.K. Mukherji in a marriage
of shared ideals that also happened to bolster her shaky legal status
as a resident sympathizer with German National Socialism.

And there are older consistencies with the dogma of another mystical
India-Germany promoter of National Socialism known as Madam Blavatsky
of the Theosophical Society (established 1875 in New York). In 1888,
Blavatsky's group joined with the American National Socialist Edward
Bellamy and his Bellamy Clubs (Nationalist Clubs) to work for
socialism. Edward Bellamy was the author of &quot;Looking Backward&quot; (1888)
an international bestseller known as the bible of National Socialism,
and translated into every major language (including German, Russian
and Chinese). Edward Bellamy was cousin to Francis Bellamy, author of
the &quot;Pledge of Allegiance&quot; (1892) the origin of the stiff-arm salute
(the early salute to the Pledge), later adopted by the National
Socialist German Workers Party.

During the time that the American National Socialist Edward Bellamy
worked with Blavatsky, she and the Theosophical Society used a
swastika symbol. Thus the swastika's association with socialism began
in the USA three decades before it was used in Germany by the National
Socialist German Workers' Party.
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

Before and after Bellamy's book, Blavatsky continued to promote
socialism in Germany, India and worldwide. At the time this was
written, the Theosophical Society of America (TSA) continued to
maintain its Springfield Branch office at the Edward Bellamy House, 93
Church Street, Chicopee, MA and also its library.

The version of the swastika symbol adopted by German socialists is the
same swastika used in Blavatsky's symbolic brooch.

That utopian socialism is consistent with the Bellamy dogma and with
the totalitarian societies of the socialist Wholecaust (of which the
Holocaust was a part): ~60 million slaughtered under the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics; ~50 million under the Peoples' Republic of
China; ~20 million under the National Socialist German Workers Party.
In 1939, the National Socialist German Workers Party joined as allies
with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to invade Poland in a
pact to divide up Europe, spreading WWII. Even after German socialism
was defeated, Soviet socialists continued to pursue their part of the
pact they had made with German socialists. Socialists in the USSR and
in China went on to kill even more millions of people.
