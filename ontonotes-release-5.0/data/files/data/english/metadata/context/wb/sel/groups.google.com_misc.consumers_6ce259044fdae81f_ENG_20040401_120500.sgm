humans. They are never vegitarians.

Cats are obligatory carnivores. They will become sick if given

If someone is a vegan they shouldn't keep carnivorous pets. If

try talking them out of it and consider reporting them to the

Her cat developed such an instinctive craving for meat that
when it had kittens, it ate them. The poor dear reportedly

"/> They are doing what everybody is doing. There are people out there on
the Atkins diet, and Subway is making the information available to let
them know which products are lowest in carbs.

Meanwhile, they are _also_ letting you know which subs are low in fat,
which is more important for those of us on the AHA diet. Last time I
looked they had seven different subs available, each with under 6 grams
of fat in a 6&quot; sub. And I assume that's with the cheese, which I
always tell them to leave off.

The information is available right there on the menu board.

I'm going to go right on patronizing Subway, thank you.

One unfortunate thing is that a lot of people go on the &quot;Atkins&quot; diet
or one its newfangled variants and think that means they can eat a big
bunch of fat bacon, broccoli smothered in butter, etc. Yes, that will
raise their risk of heart disease and stroke enormously.

But the doctors who came up with those diets have been backpedaling
furiously. They now say, &quot;Well of course you should also avoid the
really high fat foods. Eat _lean_ meats and vegetables for your
low-carb diet.&quot;

And btw I'm quite willing to believe that giving up carbs will cause
you to lose weight. I suspect that eating nothing but meat and cheese
will cause your taste buds to get bored sooner, so you eat less than
if you ate the meat _plus_ bread, rolls, cookies, etc.

But boycott_Subway is right, eating a high-fat high-protein diet will
do bad things to your heart and cerebral arteries, and your intestines,
and may result in kidney stones, gall stones, and/or deficiency diseases.

If you're really looking for something to boycott, one brand of &quot;lite
beer&quot; is advertising that they are low in carbs. Yeah, sure, if you
ignore the fact that alcohol is equivalent to sugar in the way the
body metabolizes it.

Dietary Factors and the Risk of Incident Kidney Stones in Younger Women
(Journal Abstract) Added on: 1/30/2004 Hits: 114

From Harvard University Medical School and The American Society of
Nephrology, 2003: This study was conducted at the Brigham &amp; Women's
Hospital in Boston. It studied the affects of diet on the formation of
kidney stones among 96,000 women for 8 years in the Nurses Health Study.
They found that high sugar intakes significantly increased the risk of
developing kidney stones among women. They also noted that the intake of
animal proteins did not raise kidney stone risk. They were surprised to
find that dietary calcium (not supplements) intake lowered the risk of
stones. (Free Registration Required)

"/> Not really. Alcohol is burnt for fuel, but the insulin response isn't the

Please read an Atkins book before you go misrepresenting the diet. I ate
low fat for many years and all it did for me was make me insulin resistant
and depressed. I'm on low carb now, I feel great, and my goal this year
is two centuries (100 miles is a century). On low fat, the most I ever
road was 50 miles, and I did 60+ miles many times last year.

What about all of the people who's health has improved because of
Atkins?

If you're on Atkins and you notice something obvious goes wrong (like
getting ill more often, feeling like shit, etc) then discontiue the
diet and see a physician.

Subway hasn't done anything wrong.

Doesn't sound so bad. White bread is tasteless, nutritionless starch.
While the concept (lower the starch and sugars and empty calories from
the diet) makes people go &quot;Wow that sounds REALLY healthy!!&quot;, the name
&quot;Atkins&quot; seems to trigger a &quot;You'll die in 2 years and your kidneys will
fall out!&quot; reaction! And yet, people don't realize they are talking
about the same thing.

I don't generally do fast-food much either, happened to spend a couple

tried the low-carb wraps at Subway a couple times. They aren't
bad-tasting and they didn't make my blood sugar crazy.

to up your amount of carbs to a level where you maintain your lost
weight. Most of us low carbing tend to stay toward the low glycimic
carbs, too. The high glycimics tend to contribute to various
problems.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

really a lot more moderate than the press, and sponsored studies give
it credit for, *always has been.* (And you should take a good, hard,

It'll curl your hair.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If you're really looking for something to boycott, one brand of &quot;lite

excess calories in form of carbs vs. being fat or protein are most valid
for ill effects that are also ill effects at least in part of a sedentary
lifestyle, and that active athletes have more of a higher need for carbs
than anything else compared to sedentary people?

without knowing more about what they actually are, but... I ate them two
days in a row without bad effects on my blood sugar nor coming out of
ketosis. I also didn't choose carb-heavy foods to fill the thing with
either, that would likely make a difference.

If I were needing to eat out and grab something quick and there was a
Subway around, I might get a wrap again. Or a salad - I didn't know
they did their subs as salads too, that could be a good choice.

&gt; Boycott McDonalds, because they knew that their Supersize meals were

Personal responsibility---try it on and see if it fits.
