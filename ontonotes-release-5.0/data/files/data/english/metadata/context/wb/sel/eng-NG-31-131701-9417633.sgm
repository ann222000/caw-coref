Join us on tonight's call, our guest this evening is Larry Bradley,
author of &quot;Neither Liberal nor Conservative be: An Action Plan for
People Disgusted by Polarized Politics&quot;

Aaron Russo told us to stop being good Republicans and Democrats and to
start being good Americans.

Larry will share his plan on how we can be good Americans.

- Where do I begin? (The issues are so complex.)
- What's wrong?
- Why are things so vicious and antagonistic?
- Who has time to figure out the solution? Not me.
- The whole business is so slimey and disgusting it repulses me.
- And anyway, what impact can one person have?

Larry will present his action plan then we'll open it up for Q/A.

If you want the knowledge and power to change things then get on the
call tonight!

Call Time is 9:00p.m. Eastern / 8:00pm Central / 6:00pm Pacific
Call number is 218-486-1300 Â bridge 804272
