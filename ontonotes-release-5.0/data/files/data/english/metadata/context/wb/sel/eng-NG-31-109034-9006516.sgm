General Kurt von Schleicher was a close confidante of President
Hindenburg, and the last Chancellor of the Weimar Republic prior to
Hitler's becoming chancellor.  He had a plan in '33 to create a
permanent government through the declaration of marital law and the
suppression of the Communists and elements of the Nazi Party.  He
planned to unite the left Nazis- led by the Strasser brothers, and the
Social Democratic and Christian labor unions, in order to rule the
country under emergency decree but with those groups support.
Essentially he planned to destroy the extreme left and right, leaving
a more agreeable center, from which a more stable government could be
built.  His plan obviously failed because he lost Hindenburg's support
to von Papen's plan to bring Hitler into government.
In this POD he gains Hindenburg's support and declares martial law.
Hitler realizes what is happening and mobilizes his party supporters,
as do the Communists.  Schleicher has called out the Army to enforce
the martial law and his emergency decrees and orders the arrest of the
leaders of both the Communist and Nazi Parties.  Special &quot;Emergency
Tribunals&quot; are held and the Nazi and Communist Party leadership is
accused of plotting a coup against the Republic.  When the dust clears
Schleicher is still Chancellor now ruling by decree but has managed to
create a government from representatives of the above mentioned
groups.  Gregor Strasser assumes control of the Nazi party, the pro-
Hitler leadership having been swept aside, and the Communist party is
outlawed.  For the next several years there is continued unrest from
hard-core Nazis and Communists.
With Schleicher having averted a Nazi takeover how will Germany
evolve from here?

The bottom line is: bad news for democracy. Authoritarian forms of
government (or outright dictatorships) do not go out of fashion.
Schleicher manages to whittle away details of the Versailles treaty; the
British-German Naval Agreement is done as in OTL, some settlement can be
reached, way later, as to the Rheinland. Without spending as much as Hitler
on rearmament, an authoritarian German government is viable. Extremists
threaten its stability, but OTOH they also justify its existence as opposed
to true democracy.
This kind of government needs to vent on to some warlike enterprise, as
proven by Italy's Abyssinian stint; but probably Schleicher manages to
channel the hotheads into the Spanish Civil War and possibly some other
minor adventure.
It is possible that some time later, Czechoslovakia implodes, but with less
German pressure from the outside, and therefore it passes away almost
peacefully, relatively speaking.
Thus we can face an Europe in which three kinds of governments coexist and
appear each to have a chance to keep chugging along; authoritarian
right-wing governments, the lone example of the URSS, and democracy. And the
first type might look rather efficient and appealing. This situation might
keep going for a long time; in OTL, minor countries kept or developed
authoritarian governments or dictatorships after WWII, also due to the
Communist threat (Spain, Greece, Turkey). In this ATL, that kind of
government might seem viable even for a major power (Germany, Italy) and
might be in force in other countries, too (Poland, various Eastern European
kingdoms...).

Of course, there is the Chinese affair going on. In OTL, the Japanese made
their moves because the Vichy French could not oppose them, and carried on
also because the Dutch colonies couldn't defend themselves and the British
had their hands full. In this ATL, this isn't true; OTOH, given the Japanese
leadership, some rash decision is always possible. The next big war might be
a colonial war in Asia. it can't be ruled out that if things shake up in the
region, Germany, which has lost all its colonies in 1918 and needs some
action somewhere, offers its help to some of the players, in order to get a
slice. In other words, one also wonders whether the de-colonization process
takes place as in OTL, and as fast.

How would things go in the Spanish Civil War ITTL ? Schleicher is
going to be giving less support to Franco than Hitler did in OTL.  Is
this enough to swing things in favour of the Communists ?

Not unless it also causes Mussolini to reduce his involvement. Italian
support for Franco was on a bigger scale than German. For Germany, it was

I wouldn't be so sure. True, there is not much to be gained in Spain for
this ATL's Germany - but there wasn't a whole lot for our Germany, either,
apart from testing the new hardware and making good propaganda.
OTOH, there is this need of strongly nationalistic regimes to fight (or at
least &quot;fight&quot;) the enemies, be they within or not. What's the point of
ramping up the nationalistic rhetoric if you live peacefully and have no
grudge against anybody?
This goes hand in hand with the authoritarian regimes' need of an enemy, who
justifies the regimes' methods; we can't afford the luxury of democratic
niceties because we're fighting the war on (your preferred fill-in enemy
here).
There is another factor, the one that led to the existence of the Spanish
Division Azul. Schleicher has on his hands these rabid anti-Communists, who
are a pain in the neck at home. Why not use the SCW as a safety valve? In
this ATL, the German &quot;volunteers&quot; might be somewhat closer to real
volunteers.

Is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; this enough to swing things in favour of the Communists ?
">

No, never. The SCW was not won by the presence of foreign troops as such. If
you want to remove the one foreign ingredient that will crash the
Alzamiento, you have to remove not the troops but the transport aircraft at
the very beginning of the war, which allowed Franco to airlift his reliable
Moroccans from Africa to the Peninsula. Without those aircraft, he's
successful in Africa and the Canarias, but he finds it very difficult to
reinforce his generals in Spain proper. And those were primarily Italian
airplanes, the German ones came after those.
If Schleicher sends not one man, but Mussolini sends his aircraft, Franco
still wins.

When you look at how Hitler went about rearmament and then acquiring

without provoking a general war.  The French and British did not want
another war, and so what if the Germans get Austria and the Polish

The Japanese are definitely going to still be aggressive in Asia.
They started the war in China long before the threat of war reared its
head in Europe.  I think that the war in China will be limited, and
China will have prominent foreign support.  The anti-Nazi coup
actually plays a role here, because prior to Hitler the German Army
had a de facto alliance with China.  China was one of the countries
that the Army used to build and test equitment that it wasn't allowed
to under treaty obligations.  German officers helped to train the
Chinese Nationalist Army in OTL.

There is the small detail that Poland is allied with France, and it's not
going to cave in like Austria and Czechoslovakia. A no-war, negotiated
expansionism can only go so far. Remilitarizing the Rhineland without irking
the French too much might be obtained through longish negotiations; Austria
is realistic; the Sudeten, even at a slower pace, is the real last straw.
And if Schleicher isn't making a huge spending spree on military toys, he's
not going to be able to wield them in even a half-realistic threat against
Czechoslovakia, like Hitler did.

This is a kind of arrangement that took place in more recent years in Turkey
or South Korea, but I doubt it would work in the 1930-40s. In recent years,
democracy was the way to go and non-democratic governments were subjected to
all sorts of allied pressure, bad publicity, and internal movements, because
democracy is good, democracy is what people want. But in the 1930s? Are we
sure the efficient, get-things-done strongman isn't the best solution? Why
should Schleicher, for one, let go?

The Italian air force support in the very first days of the Alzamiento was
absolutely invaluable. Not for combat, but for the first troops airlift in
history. Not done very competently (lost a lot of aircraft without enemy
intervention), yet it was the difference between having the Moroccan troops
bottled in Africa and unleashing them in Spain. Anybody could have done
that - but not Franco, and only the Italians were willing to, initially.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not always. But not even in the same ballpark as the effectiveness of
&gt; German support ... or even Communist support.

Well, that depends.
If we look at the committment of whole large units, the Soviets and Germans
did not even show up for the match, there. And the Italian performance was
only marred at Guadalajara, which, for all the propaganda, was at most a
defensive victory for the Republic; for the rest, the Italian divisions were
at least averagely competent or better than that, and, anyway, there is no
comparison because there were no German or Soviet divisions.

As to the training supplied to the Spanish allies, I think the ballpark is
about the same.

As to the hardware. Some of the Soviet and of the German hardware was way
way better, in absolute terms, when compared to Italian hardware. But then
again, much of this assessment is influecned by later (WWII) experiences,
while on the contrary we should assess these toys in the context of the war
they were used in.
Take the German 88mm. Exceptional gun; it could pierce most tanks in WWII;
in the SCW, it could pierce all tanks. Fine, so what? If we look at the SCW
only, the Italian 75mm CK AA gun could do exactly the same - pierce all
tanks. And as to the primary use, AA, they were basically equivalent for the
SCW purposes.
Take the fighters. OK, the German ones were much better than a Fiat CR.32.
So what, as far as the SCW is concerned? The CR.32 did survive encounters
with enemy fighters and did down enemy bombers.
What about the tanks? The German Pz I was only marginally better than a
CV35. A T-26 or a BT-7 were much better, with their superior armor and 45mm
gun - in theory. In practice, in the SCW they were out of action due to
mechanical breakdowns for a very large part of their time, so a running CV35
is much better than an immobilized T-26. And it can scare unsupported, badly
trained infantry just as well as a marginally better Pz I.
So if you want to assess the hardware in absolute terms, yes, your &quot;not in
the same ballpark&quot; definition might apply here and there. But if you assess
it in relative terms, relative to the context it was actually used in, I
don't think it applies.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, Italian support was, as often as not, so incompetent as to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be worthless.

&gt;&gt;The Italian air force support in the very first days of the Alzamiento was
&gt;&gt;absolutely invaluable. Not for combat, but for the first troops airlift in
&gt;&gt;history. Not done very competently (lost a lot of aircraft without enemy
&gt;&gt;intervention), yet it was the difference between having the Moroccan
&gt;&gt;troops
&gt;&gt;bottled in Africa and unleashing them in Spain. Anybody could have done
&gt;&gt;that - but not Franco, and only the Italians were willing to, initially.

&gt; Yes. So?

&gt; It in no way invalidates my statement ... especially in context.
">

I'm afraid I disagree. That contribution was carried out rather
incompetently... but... it wasn't worthless. It was actually worth a lot. To
the point that a case could be made - a what-if - wherein _without_ that
contribution, albeit rather incompetent, the Alzamiento fails. Even without
going to that length, without those aircraft Franco's life will be very much
harder.
So that contribution was incompetent - but not to the point of being
worthless. Therefore I think your statement is invalidated, at least as far
as that one ingredient of the Italian support is concerned.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not always. But not even in the same ballpark as the effectiveness of
&gt;&gt;&gt; German support ... or even Communist support.

&gt;&gt;Well, that depends.

&gt; Possibly.
">

Sure. I explained the parameters according to which it is my opinion that
the effectiveness of the Italian contributions was, generally speaking, in
the same ballpark as the other contributions. The parameters are, exactly,
well, the ballpark itself, so to speak. The war we're talking about, the
level of the opposition. A submarine that can reach 200 meters of depth is
better than one that can go down 100 meters, generally speaking. But if the
action takes place in an enclosed sea which is no deeper than 50 meters...
is the first submarine really all that better?

I agree with you. A LOT of the impetus for democratic changes we're
seeing now is due to what we saw in 1987-91 in Eastern Europe - the
Berlin Wall dismantling and so forth.

Everything we know about Schleicher suggests he had a lot more in
common with Pinochet and his ilk than any modern leader of a major
western power. It would be majorly out of character for him to behave
in the way suggested. Particularly when faced with 6 million +
unemployed Germans in the Great Depression.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The bottom line is: bad news for democracy. Authoritarian forms of
&gt; &gt;&gt; government (or outright dictatorships) do not go out of fashion.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Schleicher manages to whittle away details of the Versailles treaty; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; British-German Naval Agreement is done as in OTL, some settlement can be
&gt; &gt;&gt; reached, way later, as to the Rheinland. Without spending as much as
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hitler
&gt; &gt;&gt; on rearmament, an authoritarian German government is viable.

&gt; &gt; When you look at how Hitler went about rearmament and then acquiring
&gt; &gt; the pieces of &quot;Greater&quot; Germany,  I would say that he went about it
&gt; &gt; rather the wrong way.  Given a slower pace I think that a German
&gt; &gt; government whose only goal was to unite Greater Germany, not Hitler's
&gt; &gt; ethnic cleansing Aryan hegemony thing, could have been able to do so
&gt; &gt; without provoking a general war.  The French and British did not want
&gt; &gt; another war, and so what if the Germans get Austria and the Polish
&gt; &gt; Corridor back, its all German anyway.

&gt; There is the small detail that Poland is allied with France, and it's not
&gt; going to cave in like Austria and Czechoslovakia. A no-war, negotiated
&gt; expansionism can only go so far. Remilitarizing the Rhineland without irking
&gt; the French too much might be obtained through longish negotiations; Austria
&gt; is realistic; the Sudeten, even at a slower pace, is the real last straw.
&gt; And if Schleicher isn't making a huge spending spree on military toys, he's
&gt; not going to be able to wield them in even a half-realistic threat against
&gt; Czechoslovakia, like Hitler did.
">

I was actually thinking that the Germans basically had one shot at
being able to bully one of the Allied Eastern European countries out
of contested territory.  Hitler had mobilized his army and was
threatening war before the Munich agreement was signed.  I was
thinking of a secret Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and a Munich agreement
where the allies abandon Poland to the tender mercies of the Germans
and Soviets.  Poland was really the better country to go after because
Czechoslovakia in the long-term is probably not going to survive as a
united state.  When the state finally disintegrates into its ethnic
pieces the Sudetenland Germans can go on their merry way.

Unfortunately, the British in particular, and to a lesser degree the French
were amenable to hacking away Czechoslovakia exactly because they doubted it
would be a viable state in the long run. Which did not apply to Poland.
Poland did have large minorities, but at least it also had a clear compact
majority.
Additionally, when the Sudeten went away, significantly weakening
Czechoslovakia, the French could console themselves by thinking that on the
other hand they still had a Polish counterweight, which had actually even
grown heavier (Cieszyn and its coal mines). If OTOH they kiss Poland
goodbye, what are they left with? The Czechoslovakian patchwork.
Finally, the German minority in the Sudeten was more compact and visible
than the German minorities in Pomerania, and as to Danzig, it had its own
special status.
There were good reasons if Hitler went for the Sudeten first. Here you are
not only assuming he's replaced by Schleicher, but also that Schleicher
finds some good reasons for choosing Poland as his target; I don't see them.

Industrialized, yes. A tradition of elections? Not a lot of it. Under the
Kaiser, representatives were window-dressing rubber-stampers. With Weimar,
yes, elections, each of them delivering an always fractious, sometimes
dead-locked Reichstag, and each of them marred by political violence. Not
such a good thing in the eyes of many Germans at the time.

On the one hand, I'd point out that neither does he look like somebody
having democracy and the rule of law in great esteem. On the other hand, not
all strongmen really have personality or vision. A strongman isn't
necessarily a man of great new ideas. There might be - there were -
strongmen who were conservatives who just kept the status quo, tamed some
rubber-stamping parliament and the press, summarily jailed enemies of the
state, carried out some nationalist propaganda, and tried to keep their
country out of trouble. They did not rock the boat; they ruled by decree
exactly in order to throw overboard the boat-rockers without having to worry
about parlimaentary procedures, legal details, civil rights. Metaxas,
Smigly-Rydz, Horthy...

What sort of timescale are we talking about? Does this government
_have_ to get rearmed by 1939? Or could they go slower?

Just offhand, it seems to me that once the Rhineland and Austria have
been attended to, other things could wait a while if economics so
decreed. Czechoslovakia is now enveloped on three sides by German
territory, so is obviously going to fall some day, and there seems no
harm in waiting a few years for people to get used to that idea. As
for Poland, the bit Germany really wants - West Prussia - is even more
vulnerable, indeed indefensible against a rearmed Germany. If economic
factors make it inadvisable in the 1930s, could it not be just as well
done sometime in the 1940s or even 1950s?

The government can if it has popular support and no adversion to
deficit financing. Schleicher never had much political following.
Party thugs (or faithful) would be willing to engage in street battles
for Hitler but never for Schleicher. Would Schleicher be able to rein
in the unions as easily as Hitler did? I doubt it.

Hitler did have legitimacy of a sort. His coalition government of
March 1933 did control the majority of Reichstag seats. ATL Schleicher
would be constantly fearful of loss of military support.

They'd have to go much slower. Schleicher's labor union supporters are
still powerful and they will go on strike every so often. There won't
be Nazi Labor bosses in factories to stifle worker demands for better
conditions and wages. Maybe by 1945 the Reichswehr will be ready but
1939 is too early.

That of course gives the French, Poles and others time to improve
their military capability. The Germans might have the advantage in a
new war but nobody will call it a Blitzkrieg.

Will Austria be attended to? Dollfuss and/or Schussnig won't be
anxious to be swallowed by a Germany led by a military tyrant with
little popular support and legitimacy. The Clerical-Fascist government
won't be faced with a large local population of Hitlerites. The
Austrian Army didn't fight against the Wehrmacht OTL but it might
battle Schleicher's forces.

OTL Czechoslovakia could be said to be enveloped on four sides if you
count Poland. The 1938 Munich Accord alloted terrritory to Germany,
Hungary and Poland (Teschen region). Hitler had a 1934 pact with
Poland that disavowed and German territorial ambitions. Schleicher
would never have had the local support to sign such a pact. Come
crisis time the Poles very likely will bach the Czechs in their
dispute with Germany.

Perhaps, but the Poles, French, British etc. have not stood still
since 1939. Come September 1, 1949, do the Germans have a qualitative
advantage over their enemies? Will there still be a German-Soviet Pact
to divide Poland? Will Schleicher really be able to hold on that long?
I doubt it.

Well if this plan goes through as per the POD then he will have the
support of the unions.  I think that the coup would be planned and

&gt; &gt; Czechoslovakia is now enveloped on three sides by German

&gt; OTL Czechoslovakia could be said to be enveloped on four sides if you

Schleicher might not be able to hold out that long, but post WWI
Germany shared pretty much the foreign policy.  They wanted Austria to
join German, and take back the Polish corridor.  Whether or not
Schleicher was in control Germany would be looking to cut up Poland.
The Soviets are the same way.  Stalin had some pretty concrete foreign
policy goals prior to WWII, and would be willing to work with whomever
could get him his goals.

Would the German people believe it? Of course they would since it
would be true. Another question would be if the German people would
accept a Schleicher dictatorship. The 45% or so who had voted for
either the NSDAP or the DNVP would not. I don't know if the Communists
would accept a Schleicher dictatorship but their support (if any)
would be tenuous.

Schleicher's only power base would be in the Armed Forces where there
were already plenty of Nazi sympathizers. The soldiers would support
him against mobs and SA men - but only for a while.

Nope.

The British were committed to a withdrawal from India by 1942.

The war delayed Indian independence.

As for the rest of the Far Eastern Empire,  it's anyone's guess,  but
without India there's no real point in holding onto the stuff further East.

Without the huge port cities of Bombay and Calcutta to act as 'focuses' for
the Empire in the Far East it probably won't work profitably.

On the other hand no war also means no partition as the Congress leaders
don't spend the war in jail.

India is the current India plus  Pakistan,  Burma and any other bits hanging
about.

Afghanistan comes to the forefront of international relations much
earlier...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; General Kurt von Schleicher was a close confidante of President
&gt; Hindenburg, and the last Chancellor of the Weimar Republic prior to
&gt; Hitler's becoming chancellor.  He had a plan in '33 to create a
&gt; permanent government through the declaration of marital law and the
&gt; suppression of the Communists and elements of the Nazi Party.  He
&gt; planned to unite the left Nazis- led by the Strasser brothers, and the
&gt; Social Democratic and Christian labor unions, in order to rule the
&gt; country under emergency decree but with those groups support.
&gt; Essentially he planned to destroy the extreme left and right, leaving
&gt; a more agreeable center, from which a more stable government could be
&gt; built.  His plan obviously failed because he lost Hindenburg's support
&gt; to von Papen's plan to bring Hitler into government.
&gt;   In this POD he gains Hindenburg's support and declares martial law.
&gt; Hitler realizes what is happening and mobilizes his party supporters,
&gt; as do the Communists.  Schleicher has called out the Army to enforce
&gt; the martial law and his emergency decrees and orders the arrest of the
&gt; leaders of both the Communist and Nazi Parties.  Special &quot;Emergency
&gt; Tribunals&quot; are held and the Nazi and Communist Party leadership is
&gt; accused of plotting a coup against the Republic.  When the dust clears
&gt; Schleicher is still Chancellor now ruling by decree but has managed to
&gt; create a government from representatives of the above mentioned
&gt; groups.  Gregor Strasser assumes control of the Nazi party, the pro-
&gt; Hitler leadership having been swept aside, and the Communist party is
&gt; outlawed.  For the next several years there is continued unrest from
&gt; hard-core Nazis and Communists.
&gt;   With Schleicher having averted a Nazi takeover how will Germany
&gt; evolve from here?
">

About 30 minutes after Schleicher announces his coup, he is confronted
by the heads of the departments of the General Staff. He was shot by
General Werner von Blomberg and died instantly. The Army summoned
Fritz von Papen, who had the confiedence of President Hindenberg, and
announced a government of the Army to be headed by von Papen as
Chancellor. The left ranks of the Nazi party were decimated in street
fighting and Hitler, Goering, Rohm and other high level Nazis were
imprisoned, tried and hung as traitors.

The military-led Germany government concentrated on rebuilding the
Army and creating an atmosphere of trust with their neighbors. The
Strasbourg Conference of 1934 returned the Rhineland to Germany and a
modus vivendi with Poland provided German access to East Prussia.

German &quot;volunteers&quot; participated in the Spanish Civil War as part of
the Franco forces. Several weapons systems were given trials in this
encounter, many faults with the aviation and armor led to closer
relations with the Soviet Union, which the German military had used as
a training ground since the 1920s.

When Italy invaded Ethiopia the small contingent of German troops sent
by the League of Nations was instrumental in securing the port of
Eritrea and enabling the British force to counteract the Italians.

Not really. The Cripps proposals of that year were for some sort of

and France - just rearmed enough that defeating Germany would require a
serious fight, not just an occupation of the Ruhr type of op. Once they had
that, they could get away (as Hitler did get away) with any claims that
sounded halfway reasonable.

Note that Eire, which _did_ have Dominion status, was nonetheless perfectly
free to remain neutral in WW2.

Canada and South Africa did not declare war, iirc, till about a week after
Britain (with a sizeable &quot;no&quot; vote in the SA Parliament). Australia and NZ
were at war (declared by their Governors-General) from the moment GB did,
because _their_ legal opinion , not Britain's, held that it was
constitutionally impossible to remain neutral when the &quot;Empire&quot; was at war.
However, all decisions on their participation in the war, and military or
other conribution to it, were made by their governments, not by anyone in
London.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Additionally I think that the military budget post-coup would be as
&gt;&gt; &gt; high as Hitler's.  The Army would be able to demand anything that it
&gt;&gt; &gt; wanted, and if it wanted a higher budget (and what military doesn't?)
&gt;&gt; &gt; than it would get it.  The military build-up necessary to intimidate
&gt;&gt; &gt; Poland and show that the Germans were fully ready to risk war would
&gt;&gt; &gt; definitely be in the cards.

&gt; Depends. It's in a fragile situation, facing Communists on one side
&gt; and whatever's left of the Nazis on the other. Can it afford to spend
&gt; heavily on armaments at the expense of people's standard of living?

In the short term, you can cover both bases - by getting the state indebted

I think so. Of course if Schleicher goes for a slower rearmament, on a more

It would be nice if politicians would cease applying new
interpretations to words. A present case in point is Iraq where
something called &quot;sovereignty&quot; was declared several years ago. Since
the Premier has zero authority over American forces and next to none
over Iraqi forces I fail to see how Iraq can be called sovereign.

Similarly, independence and dominion status seemed to mean different
things back in the 1940s. From TIME Magazine for Monday, Apr. 06,
1942, &quot;Standing in a sun-splashed, marble conference room in New
Delhi, Sir Stafford Cripps solemnly read to 200 correspondents
Britain's offer of full Dominion status to India after the war,
including the right to separate into two or more Dominions and even to
secede from the British Commonwealth.&quot;

OK, since the 200 correspondents were politically knowledgeable, it
seems superfluous for Cripps to have to enumerate those things that a
Dominion can do. It would seem that everybody already knew what was
meant by a Dominion. By the way, what is the difference between &quot;full
Dominion status&quot; and partial Dominion status?

If you're referring to 1945 Rhodesia or Jamaica, you're correct as far
as I know. The local legislative assemblies were all White controlled.
India was a quite different matter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; De facto, at worst, if not exactly de jure.
">

Getting back to my contention that the 1945 British were not anxious
to quit India let's see what the Wavell Plan offered:

&quot;The Wavell Plan, which would be effective until the granting of
Indian independence or dominion status, is a modified Cripps Plan.
Under the Cripps Plan, the Viceroy had complete control over defense
and foreign affairs. Under the Wavell Plan, the Viceroy will also
control finance. Under the Cripps Plan, the Assembly could not
overthrow the Government by a vote of censure. Under the Wavell Plan,
the Assembly can overthrow the Government and cause a change of
Executive Council (Cabinet) on any issue except defense, finance or
foreign affairs.&quot;

That's from TIME for May. 21, 1945. The war in Europe was over by that
point but there was no mention of immediately giving India either
independence or dominion status. (Note the wording about independence
or dominion status. Somebody thought they were different things back
then.) Wavell was proposing a plan that would resemble Walter
Ulbricht's DDR except that Ulbricht had more autonomy.

Continuing: &quot;The proposed viceregal control of finance is presumably
due in part to Britain's debtor position to India. Britain now owes
£1,030,000,000 (about $4,500,000,000) in the form of sterling credit
to India. Britain is unable to repay even a small part of the debt
immediately, and does not want India to sell her sterling credit to
the U.S. In time she hopes to pay her debt by sales of export goods to
India.&quot;

So Britain would continue to control the Indian ecomony and would
repay its debts by sales of export goods. Who would determine the
price and value of these marvelous British exports? Not the Indians
I'm sure.

The European war was over when Wavell made his proposal but the
Japanese war continued. How long would it last? Probably 1947 but it
could be going on until 1949 or later. The Indians would of course
have to wait it out.

What if the Wavell Plan fails?

&quot;If the Wavell Plan fails, the Viceroy has the full approval of the
British Cabinet to use the Indian Army to keep order and suppress any
revolt quickly. He has asked for an increase of British officers in
the Indian Army.&quot;

&gt; &gt; They'd have to go much slower. Schleicher's labor union supporters are
&gt; &gt; still powerful and they will go on strike every so often. There won't
&gt; &gt; be Nazi Labor bosses in factories to stifle worker demands for better
&gt; &gt; conditions and wages. Maybe by 1945 the Reichswehr will be ready but
&gt; &gt; 1939 is too early.

&gt; &gt; That of course gives the French, Poles and others time to improve
&gt; &gt; their military capability. The Germans might have the advantage in a
&gt; &gt; new war but nobody will call it a Blitzkrieg.

&gt; But how much difference does it make?

&gt; GB and France being better armed has no effect unless they _want_ to oppose
&gt; Germany. Even a better armed Poland has little chance against  a better
&gt; armed Germany, so as long as Germany hasn't got Anglo-French backs up to the
&gt; point of them deciding to guarantee Poland, then it's no great matter if
&gt; British or French armaments have increased that much.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just offhand, it seems to me that once the Rhineland and Austria have
&gt; &gt; &gt; been attended to, other things could wait a while if economics so
&gt; &gt; &gt; decreed.

&gt; &gt; Will Austria be attended to? Dollfuss and/or Schussnig won't be
&gt; &gt; anxious to be swallowed by a Germany led by a military tyrant with
&gt; &gt; little popular support and legitimacy. The Clerical-Fascist government
&gt; &gt; won't be faced with a large local population of Hitlerites. The
&gt; &gt; Austrian Army didn't fight against the Wehrmacht OTL but it might
&gt; &gt; battle Schleicher's forces.

&gt; Well, that rues out Schlicher doing _anything_. If he can't tackle Austia he
&gt; certainly can't take on Czechoslovakia or Poland.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Czechoslovakia is now enveloped on three sides by German
&gt; &gt; &gt; territory, so is obviously going to fall some day, and there seems no
&gt; &gt; &gt; harm in waiting a few years for people to get used to that idea.

&gt; &gt; OTL Czechoslovakia could be said to be enveloped on four sides if you
&gt; &gt; count Poland. The 1938 Munich Accord alloted terrritory to Germany,
&gt; &gt; Hungary and Poland (Teschen region). Hitler had a 1934 pact with
&gt; &gt; Poland that disavowed and German territorial ambitions. Schleicher
&gt; &gt; would never have had the local support to sign such a pact. Come
&gt; &gt; crisis time the Poles very likely will bach the Czechs in their
&gt; &gt; dispute with Germany.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As for Poland, the bit Germany really wants - West Prussia - is even
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; vulnerable, indeed indefensible against a rearmed Germany. If economic
&gt; &gt; &gt; factors make it inadvisable in the 1930s, could it not be just as well
&gt; &gt; &gt; done sometime in the 1940s or even 1950s?

&gt; &gt; Perhaps, but the Poles, French, British etc. have not stood still
&gt; &gt; since 1939. Come September 1, 1949, do the Germans have a qualitative
&gt; &gt; advantage over their enemies? Will there still be a German-Soviet Pact
&gt; &gt; to divide Poland? Will Schleicher really be able to hold on that long?
&gt; &gt; I doubt it.

&gt; As above, the state of Anglo-French arms is less important than whether they
&gt; feel threatened enough to takeaction. And I always thought that Germany
&gt; (pre-Hitler) was on reasonable terms with the SU most of the times, so a
&gt; Pact is stillat least conceivable.

Yes and no - my understanding of the Cripps proposals is that it was
sort of a second class Dominion status without several of the powers
Canada, SA, Australia and NZ took for granted after the 1931 Statute
of Westminster.

Had it been FULL Dominion status Congress might well have gone for it.

In fairness the Canadian Parliament took about a week to reconvene

declare war once the Speaker called the house to order.

My understanding of Canadian law is that the Governor-General would
have exceeded his powers had he made such a declaration with the very
likely result that Canada would be a republic a.s.a.p. after VE Day.

Given all Canadian GG's were British peers up to the 1950s one can

Agree entirely.

FWIW, the German generals seem to have been a lot more cautious than Hitler
in the 1930s, being scared stiff of the risks he was running.

My guess is that the Army regime brings back conscription and reoccupies the
Rhineland (though maybe later than OTL) and at some point takes Austria,
which is by far the easiest acquisition to make, but may take their time
over Czechoslovakia and Poland. After all, neither is going to go anywhere
and there's no reason to suppose that GB and France will become any more
eager to protect them, while in the case of CZ there's always the chance
that it may be pulled apart by internal dissention.

I wonder if that (at least partially) if a side-effect of the fact that
Military Dictatorships have less &quot;legitimacy&quot; than the &quot;civilian&quot; ones -

&gt;&gt; override any attempts by UKG to interfere.

&gt;&gt; De facto, at worst, if not exactly de jure.

&gt;Note that Eire, which _did_ have Dominion status, was nonetheless
&gt;perfectly free to remain neutral in WW2.

I'm a bit surprised that nobody picked up on that.  While the title
&quot;King of Ireland&quot; lasted until 1949 and was apparently used formally
for external affairs (if
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland &gt; is
to be believed), and they were theoretically still in the
Commonwealth, there was no language in the 1937 constitution for his
role (except perhaps as an &quot;organ&quot; buried in Article 29?
&lt; http://www.johnpghall.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/constit.htm#thetext &gt;), no
governor-general, and &quot;The executive power of the State in or in
connection with its external relations shall in accordance with
Article 28 of this Constitution be exercised by or on the authority of
the Government.&quot;.

Surely that was affected by the fact that the Statute of Westminster

I'll defer to our Aussie friends on this one though let it not be said
that the Canadian declaration of war was not in any way in doubt the
way South Africa's might have been.

I don't have my references handy but any dissension in Canada was on
the matter of conscription for overseas service vs. the actual DoW.

Besides, did not the Australian government declare war BEFORE
Chamberlain announced the British declaration?

The DoW vote was not quite unanimous but close enough:

&quot;Though the decision to go to war overwhelmingly supported by Parliament,
it was not unanimous.

&quot;James Shaver Woodsworth, a Methodist minister and pacifist who helped
create the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, broke ranks with his
party and became the sole member of Parliament to vote against the motion
to go to war.

&quot;French Canada was less supportive of rushing to join Britain in the war
effort. Quebec MPs Wilfrid Lacroix and Liguori Lacombe voted for a 'non-
participation amendment' but were its only supporters. The next day the
Globe and Mail called them 'two French-Canadians who gained eternal
distinction by an attitude unworthy of their people and country.'&quot;
http://archives.cbc.ca/400i.asp?IDCat=71&amp;IDDos;=1810&amp;IDCli;=12259&amp;IDLan;=1

Considering that in the US there was one vote (by Jeanette Rankin) against
the declaration of war on Japan even after Pearl Harbor, I would say that
Canada came about as close to unanimity on the DoW as one could reasonably
expect.

Note Mackenzie King's remarks on Woodsworth during the debate:  &quot;There are
few men in this Parliament for whom I have greater respect than the leader
of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. I admire him in my heart,
because time and again he has had the courage to say what lays on his
conscience, regardless of what the world might think of him. A man of that
calibre is an ornament to any Parliament.&quot;

There's no question that Woodsworth was a CONSIDERABLY bigger fish
inthe Canadian parliament than Jeannette Rankin was in the US
Congress. He was definitely a front-bencher which is a term I would
expect Canadians / Brits / Aussies and Kiwis to recognize. I'd expect
quite a few 'Murricans here to understand 'frontbencher' as well. In
the unlikely event a CCF government had been formed, Woodsworth would
certainly have had a cabinet position which Rankin never would have
been considered for.

(ObWI: create a CCF government in Canada federally any time between
1930-1960)

I'm chiefly surprised Mackenzie King would speak in such terms since
King was the arch-______ (pragmatist to his friends, opportunist to
his foes) of Canadian politics.

Your quotation sounds more like a funeral eulogy than the usual kind
of speech one usually hears in Parliament particularly with respect to
a decision to go to war.

Well, maybe Mackenzie King knew that Woodsworth's vote was so unpopular, even
within the CCF, that Woodsworth *was* dead (politically) and that therefore
it was safe to be generous to him.

Also, remember that unlike the sole dissents of Jeanette Rankin in 1941 or
Barbara Lee in 2001, (leaving aside that neither of them was a party leader)
this is not a case in which the nation declaring war (or authorizing the use
of force) had been attacked, so it was possible to view anti-war votes with
somewhat greater calm.

On the other hand, the Athenia had already been sunk so our side knew
the Germans were serious.

(On a personal note, my Irish great-grandmother visited Canada in 1939
and had taken the Athenia to get here. My grandmother used to talk
about how her mother had cried and cried about the fate of the
stewards who had treated so well on her passage. The family tried to
get her to stay in Canada for the duration but she insisted on
returning to Belfast saying her place was there so she had to wait in
Montreal for two weeks to catch a ship back)
