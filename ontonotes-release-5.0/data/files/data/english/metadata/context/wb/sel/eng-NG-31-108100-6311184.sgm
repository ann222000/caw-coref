Hi Gang,

Just thought I'd close the story.

Jerry came over this morning and he's a pro!  First, the shopping list
he gave me was dead on accurate. When I make a list I always have to
go back to Lowes a few times.

He just went to work, measuring and cutting and in a couple of hours
it was done. I am so happy, and in so much pain.

Screwing all afternoon is hard work.

Bada bump....

&lt;g&gt;

Congrats, Hunter.  Now you get to move all those heavy shop tools
in.  And maybe even buy some more!

Funny you should say that, I was just sitting here wondering how to
get those big things up the hill, across sand and up the step into the
new shop.

Much of my stuff is from Sears, those Craftsman tools that live on
large red metal drawers.  They have little wheels on some, but they
will sink in the sand.

As for buying more.  There's not much more. Nothing that I can think
of that I need, except for a screw gun.  &lt;g&gt;

Oh, the felons also stole my router bits, a brand new set that came in
a large wooden box.  $100.00 worth. Didn't realize until I went to use
one.  )c:

I guess I need new router bits, again.

Gonna put some kind of a peg board up on the back wall...

You're not doing that by ... er .. hand, are you?

A hefty cordless drill with magnetic screw tip works wonders.  Of all
the things I'm picturing, maybe that's what you meant by "screw gun".

I'll do that someday.  Right now, Colorado weather is being terrific!

And the Tiger is still being held captive by decal-removal terrorists.
I have to pounce on them every few days while listening to them whine

stripes were applied with Nasa's tile re-entry glue.

In Florida, as well as any high humidity area, a shop rag with a very light
oil to wipe your tools down is your friend.  Just keep oily, or ANY rags, in
a closed metal container.  Damp or oily rags will spontaneous combust, we
lost a pressman at the Knoxville News-Sentinel when a room full of shop rags
burst into flames.

Ha! I was robbed by the gardner/plumber, aka " The Felon".

The dogs liked him as much as we did )c:

The good news is, the barn the floor is in, is inside the fence where
my trailer and the dogs roam.

The garage was unprotected, and everyone who comes here can see into
the garage and most come thorough it to get into the house.

Few have any reason to be up near the barn.

Hahaha!!! Actually, I remember one night in Montana, I think, I was
sound asleep...the trailer wasn't hooked up to the truck.

All of a sudden we were moving..... the trailer slid off the levelers
and rolled to a stop.

I must have forgot the chocks, or maybe I still used those silly
little yellow plastic ones back then.

It was quite an experience. &lt;g&gt;

Hi Mickey,

I thought I did, until I went to use a router bit. The box was gone.

I know the box of router bits was on the shelf where the router table
lives.

I did call the police, and there was no record of it being pawned. I
guess he sold it outright to someone.

He's in jail still. When he gets out he's supposed to pay me back the
money I paid getting my stuff back. I doubt he will, but if he does
I'll ask him what happened to the bits.

I still haven't picked up the 'free' chocks the salesman said he'd
give me. Are they really required? I usually find a couple of logs
with a triangular profile and jam them under the downhill side of the
wheels... nothing's moved yet as far as I can recall.

You spray it on, let it dry, wipe it off. A thin film remains. Harmless to

I should add that you don't *have* to wipe it off pliers, hammers, etc. I
don't use it on that type of tool anyway; makes them slippery.
A thin film of oil (whatever is in an oily rag) will protect wrenches,
pliers etc. My wrenches usually get enough oil on them from use so it's
never been a problem.
I usually have to wipe the oil *off* instead of *on*.  &lt;G&gt;

You can purchase a big bucket of air drier in the supermarket, discount

Sounds good. You need room on both sides of a radial arm saw.  Course you
can always turn a board end for end if you don't have enough room on one
side.
What do you use for ripping.  If you use the radial arm saw, be careful!

Here's mine.

I can move the workbench to line up with the table saw so it serves as an

I have a total of 1060 sq. ft. But there's a small bathroom (4 X 7) and the
enclosure for the furnace and the water heater.
I have all my large power tools on casters so I can move them around to
better accommodate a big project.  I'm also able to move everything to the
sides so I can park my GMC in there. (when I don't have a project underway)

If you have that much room, it would be great.
You don't really need a table on each side of the radial arm saw.  Since the
wood won't be moving, those roller supports will do just fine.
With a table saw the wood moves across the saw and onto the outfeed table
(or whatever you have for support) so a large flat surface is best.

I've thought of that, wanted to when I was working in the garage and
had to pull it out and push it back when Patti was headed home.

I worry about saws on wheels and having them move. I suppose you have
locking casters.

The beauty of the workshop is I want everything to live where it'll
work.
