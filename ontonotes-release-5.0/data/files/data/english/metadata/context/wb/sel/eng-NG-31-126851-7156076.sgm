Transgender debate: Heat, and yes, light

Sunday, March 04, 2007

In recent weeks the small town of Spring Arbor, and its namesake
Christian university, have been rocked with an unlikely controversy.
John Nemecek, respected and honored professor for 16 years, was
dismissed after beginning to present himself as herself -- that is,
as Julie Nemecek.

The word, which few of us knew much about before this story, is
transgender. Or, to give the term its psychological garb, Gender
Identity Disorder or Dysphoria. It is a disorder recognized by the
American Psychiatric Association, with complex causes and a treatment
that involves hormonal therapy and a gradual transition from living
as one gender to the other. In most cases, as with Nemecek, the shift
is from male to female. Nemecek has followed the prescribed therapy.

That has led to another transition -- from Nemecek's status as a
valued SAU professor to a person without a job. Resolving the related
job issues will be the subject of an equal-opportunity mediation
session this week. Those issues are best left for resolution within
that framework.

Our interest is more on the debate this has provoked within this
community -- and far beyond it. (At one point, a Google search of the
words "Nemecek, transgender" produced 14,000 Web site references on
the Internet.)

Like many in the community, we have relationships with people we
highly respect on both sides of the debate. As journalists who
grapple with tough issues all the time, this is one of the most
sensitive we've encountered. Spring Arbor (even Jackson County) is a
mostly conservative and traditional Christian community. It is a
place where one does not simply step out of manhood into womanhood
without raising an emotional debate. At times, the emotions have
gotten quite raw.

Reader response to this story at times has been abusive and extreme.
Julie has been dismissed as "a goof" and a "hedonist," her mental
stability called into question. She has been the subject of more
Bible-based rebukes than most people would get for capital crimes.

But the response has also been informative and affirming at times.
We've heard from medical doctors who treat transgenders, from other
transgenders themselves. There have been expressions of generosity
and kindness, of sympathy and compassion.

We have learned from all of this. The community has been stretched in
a way none of us could have anticipated.

Some have criticized the university, but we do not, for we know that
the university community has struggled greatly over this situation.
One of the significant ethical challenges for Christian institutions
such as SAU will be how to respond to prescribed treatment protocols
for the transgendered person. If such treatment is rejected, the
question is begged: What is the Christian solution?

We all need more light on a subject like this. But light cannot come
as long as the transgender is a nonperson. The Nemecek story has lent
eloquence, intelligence and a human face to the transgender person.
The truth is that Julie Nemecek is an articulate spokesperson for the
transgender cause. She is Christian, an ordained minister. She is
highly educated and thoughtful, not flamboyant.

Individual reactions may incline toward the good and noble, or the
critical and intolerant. Both are understandable in the context of
different situations. But perhaps if we see in the Nemecek story the
long story of human brokenness, it may also prompt in us that ancient
prayer, "Kyrie eleison" or Lord have mercy -- for all who suffer in
this life, and for ourselves as well.
