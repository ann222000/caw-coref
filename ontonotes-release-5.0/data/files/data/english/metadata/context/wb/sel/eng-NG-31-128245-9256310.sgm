IDF denies capturing top Hamas member

The IDF denied involvement Saturday night in what Palestinians claimed was
an Israeli capture of a senior Hamas operative involved in the kidnapping of
IDF Cpl. Gilad Schalit.

If the Palestinian reports are true, Israeli forces penetrated deep into the
heart of Rafah late Friday night to nab Mohawah al-Qadi, a senior member of
the Hamas's armed wing and a commander in the Executive Force.

Although the IDF denied responsibility for the operation and the Shin Bet
(Israel Security Agency) refused to comment whatsoever on the operation,
Hamas said it took place over two kilometers beyond the Gaza security fence
and in an area known to be a hotbed of Hamas gunmen.

&quot;A special Zionist force wearing Executive Force uniforms entered George
Street in eastern Rafah in a civilian Subaru car and then headed towards the
Sufa crossing&quot; with Israel, Hamas's armed wing, the Izzadine al-Kassam
Brigades, said in a statement.

Palestinian sources also said that al-Qadi was involved with the kidnapping
of Schalit in June 2006.

Al-Qadi, apprehended together with his assistant Saqer Abd al-Al, was
&quot;responsible for the Executive Force public relations,&quot; the group said.

At first, Hamas officials thought the man was taken by Fatah loyalists
because of clashes taking place between loyalists of the two groups in Gaza
since Friday morning.

Hamas spokesmen said that only when the Subaru car carrying al-Qadi was seen
leaving the Gaza Strip accompanied by helicopters did they consider that the
operative had been grabbed by the Israelis.

According to one account, the car traveled to Dahaniyeh airport in Gaza and
an IAF chopper took the man from there.

Meanwhile, on Saturday morning, IDF soldiers allegedly shot and killed a
Palestinian teenager who approached the Karni Checkpoint in the northern
Gaza
Strip carrying a firearm.

According to Palestinian sources, the 19-year-old, Ramzi Hiles, had
approached the border fence area while hunting fowl and was shot by an IDF
sniper, bleeding to death from a gunshot wound to his thigh.

The IDF opened an investigation into the incident, but said that initial
information indicated that the youth was part of a group of
suspicious-looking Palestinians who approached the fence. Soldiers said that
when they saw the group, they fired warning shots into the air, but did not
target the youth.
Overnight Saturday, Palestinians threw two explosive devices at IDF forces
operating south of Jenin in Kabatia and Mutalet a-Shahida, although neither
device succeeded in damaging equipment or wounding soldiers.

No injuries or damage were reported after Palestinians also threw rocks and
petrol bombs overnight Saturday at Israeli vehicles traveling northwest of
Ramallah.

Also overnight Saturday, IDF forces operating in Nablus arrested a wanted
Palestinian who was transferred for questioning to the Shin Bet.
