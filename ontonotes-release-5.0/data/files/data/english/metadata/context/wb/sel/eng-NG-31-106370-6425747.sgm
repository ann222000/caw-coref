Cheney's leg checked again after he has 'discomfort'
Vice President Dick Cheney returned this morning to the Washington hospital
where he was treated earlier this month for a blood clot in his left leg.

"He's getting a routine follow up on his leg. It's just a routine checkup,"
spokeswoman Megan McGinn told the Associated Press.

Cheney has had a number of medical problems since he re-entered public life
in 2000 as the Republican vice presidential nominee. Here's how the wire
service summed up his medical history: He had six hours of surgery on his
legs in 2005 to repair a kind of aneurysm, a ballooning weak spot in an
artery that can burst if left untreated. He has had four heart attacks,
quadruple bypass surgery, two artery-clearing angioplasties and an operation
to implant a special pacemaker in his chest.

Update at 12:25 p.m. ET. Cheney had "discomfort:"

Earlier our headline said that McGinn had described Cheney's visit as a
"routine checkup."

McGinn has now told AP that Cheney went to the hospital after experiencing
discomfort in his left lower leg. An ultrasound test "revealed no extension
or complication of the clot," said Cheney spokeswoman Megan McGinn, and he
later returned to work.

I was just passing by and, as it happens, I am just finishing up "The Dark
Side of Camelot," by Seymour M. Hersh.  Back when the events happened I
wondered as to why and who would want the young, handsome, gregarious,
popular man dead.  After reading the book it seems there were a lot of
people.  When the book came out, I, and a lot of others, apparently,
thought, "What more is there to know?"  Well, it seems to be a lot.

You might as well claim, that the right wing wants to kill Bush.

Bush successfully started a war, transferred tax payers money to
military contractors, transferred the debt to our children and grand
children. He is on his way to bankrupt the federal government. All of
this is the wet dream all 'patriots' like Norquist and the corporate
oligarchy to ruin the country, and enrich themselves.

Ah, yes, the Kennedy family.  Are the sins of the father visited on the
sons?  Let's take a look:

Joe Kennedy Sr.:  Mafia connected fascist asshole.  (Recalled as ambassador

Joe Jr.: dead

Jack: dead

Bobby: dead

Teddy: a bum

Yep, the Kennedys are a definite example of what happens when you have

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; obesity, chronic severe booze abuse.  Anyone really think that
antigun
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nut will be around too much longer?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, Teddy could be around for a long time. It would be counter

&gt; &gt;&gt;   The left wing will do it, like they did the last two times.

&gt; &gt; Three if you count brother Joe.

&gt; Ah, yes, the Kennedy family.  Are the sins of the father visited on the
&gt; sons?  Let's take a look:

Stolen from 'National Lampoon', circa 1976.  Very funny issue, wish I still

&gt; Yep, the Kennedys are a definite example of what happens when you have
&gt; perverted family values.

The Kennedy family gives truth to the theory that God invented whisky to
keep the Irish from ruling the world.

LOL!  I'm Irish and this is funny.

(And, you're right about the Nat Lamp:  that flap about the Kennedy's was so
