Homer 1994 - 03.01.2007&quot;
brothers and sisters i bid you beware
of giving your heart to a dog to tear

i put homer to sleep yesterday.

it was quite possibly the hardest thing i've ever done.

monday night i was trying to teach him to down using a
food lure. he wasn't getting it, so i put a hand on him to
try to encourage him to down. he attacked me, biting me
twice on the hand, and then when i stood up and backed
away, he came after me more and bit me on the leg as well.

i was shocked and devestated and a hundred other things.

i ended up emailing my trainer (who has turned out to be a
very kind friend) and she called me and i spent an hour on
the phone with her crying. she doesn't deal with aggression
cases, but she listened to me and talked me down. i hardly
slept that night.

tuesday i took homer in to work with me and had the vet
feel his neck. i didn't think it was a reaction due to pain
but i had to check it out. the vet put his hands on the sides
of homer's head and manipulated his head around. homer
didn't show any signs of pain or discomfort. he went
through the motions some more.

homer flipped out, with no warning, extremely violently. it
took him a long time (it felt like a lifetime. it was probably
around 3 minutes) to calm down enough that the vet could
take his hands off of homer without anybody getting hurt.

i went home for lunch and called a behaviorist. i spent a lot
of the day reading the brenda aloff aggression book and the
karen overall behavior book.

that night the behaviorist called me and i told her what had
happened and she asked questions and i answered them as
best i could.

she gave him a pretty poor prognosis.

everything that she said made sense to me, and nothing
she said was earth-shattering or even really anything
that i didn't already know.

this morning i took him in and held him close and cried into
his fur and told him how much i love him and let him go.

he was a dangerous dog. he bit unpredictably and with no
warning. he was a love, a snugglebug, a sweet sweet dog
as long as you didn't do anything he didn't want done. but
if you tried to &quot;make&quot; him do something he didn't want to
do, all bets were off. his reaction could be a snap or it could
be an over-the-top meltdown.

i couldn't live with a dog like that.

i *will not* live with a dog like that.

i've spent the last three days crying my eyes out. i never
imagined i could get that attached to a dog who i had for
all of 12 days and who bit me several times during those
12 days.

but i was. i loved him.

i loved him ferociously, but i had to let him go.

for his sake.

for my sake.

for the sake of luce and mushroom.

i feel horrible. heartbroken. guilty. angry.

and yet i don't regret him, not for one moment,
despite how things turned out.

i never meant to own a poodle. i used to take those
online &quot;what breed of dog is right for you tests&quot;
and get poodle and go back and change my answers.

i especially never meant to own a little poodle.

sometimes life turns out to be the last thing you expect.

the first time i met her i had just started working
overnights by myself. she was hospitalized with
pneumonia and an ugly anal gland abscess. she
barked and carried on and peed in her cage every
twenty minutes and pretty much drove me crazy
all night and i absolutely couldn't stand her.

then one of our doctors brought her back to the
hospital for good. her owner had alzheimers and
had to go into a home, and pam said she'd take
siren and try to find her a home. the womans
other dog was an easy rehome- a 2 year old mini
poodle, cute as a button. but siren was 16, senile,
with advanced heart disease, not great kidneys,
full cataracts in both eyes, and no potty training
whatsoever.

she stayed about 2 months in the kennels. she
grew on me. i would leave her out with me at
night so she'd get some exercise and some
attention. one night i mentioned to the vet who
had brought her in that i wished i could take
her but was afraid i couldn't afford her.

she'd need multiple medications, regular bloodwork,
x-rays, etc. the vet offered to pay for her medical bills
if i'd give her a good home.

she told me she didn't expect siren to live more than
a year.  she lasted 18 months and 4 days. she could
have kept going physically. but her little brain had
just run out. the past two weeks she's just been terrible.

she was pacing nonstop and wouldn't or couldn't stop.

i'd pick her up and try to bring her back to bed and
quiet her down, and her legs would just keep pacing
as i held her.

she was getting lost and stuck in corners, and at walls,
and in weird places i can't figure out how she got into.
she hardly knew where she was or what was going on
anymore.

and when i asked her what she wanted, all i got was
an overwhelming feeling of apathy.

so i took her in tonight after appointments and we
put her to sleep. it was one of the hardest decisions
i've ever had to make.

i think i've been crying for a week. i thought i was
cried out, but when the vet was giving her the
injection and started crying,

i lost it.

i'm home now and just feel so empty. i have to
figure out what  to do with all her things. her bed.
her coats. i feel so lost.

they got me beautiful flowers at work and i keep
looking at them and tearing up again because i
am just so touched.

she was a special dog and she touched a lot of
people's lives. i miss her very much.

goodnight my little space princess. sleep sweet
and remember me in your dreams.

02/25/2007: &quot;the new dog.&quot;
Last saturday i adopted a 12 1/2 year old mixed breed dog from a
local shelter. my best guess is pit bull x beagle (does that make him
a piggle?). there's definitely beagle in there. anyway, he was at the
shelter because his owners got divorced. it was so cold there and he
was so sad and shivering and it was just terrible. it took me a long
time and several trips to see him before i made a decision, but in the
end, i had to save him.

so homer is here now, 18&quot; at the shoulder, a skinny 37 pounds. he's
doing great. it was a little rocky at the beginning, because the wild
young dogs want to play with him, and he doesn't appreciate their
demolition derby style of play. everybody's getting used to everybody
else though, now, and life is much more peaceful. homer's favorite
thing in the world is the red dog bed in my livingroom.

he's such a great dog. old dogs are so often overlooked in the
shelter, but he's fantastic. he's housebroken, quiet in the crate,
polite on a leash, friendly with people, tolerent of other dogs,
doesn't bark, doesn't chew, just wants to snuggle. i am so glad
he's here.

and he's got cool ears.

thanks greymatter!

&quot;(38) golden rule of pit bull ownership&quot;

never trust a pit bull not to fight.

we need to remember where these dogs came
from, what image we created them in.

we designed these dogs as the ultimate canine gladiators,
faced them off in combat, selected for those who won.

we humans have been doing this selective dog breeding
thing for a long time. we're good at it.

and the result, with pit bulls, is dogs who will fight to the death,
dogs who will not back down, dogs who fight to win. period.
because it's instinct.

so when we keep multiple dogs together, multiple pit bulls especially,
there's always some risk. it's important to be careful, to be
vigilant, to
take precautions, and to accept that there's always the possibility of
something happening and the responsibility of taking care of it.

my dogs are never together unsupervised. if they're outside, i'm with
them. if i'm not home, they're crated. i'd prefer it be otherwise, but
it's not safe. 99% of the time they're great together. they adore each
other. they snuggle with each other. they play with each other.

but every once in awhile tempers flare. every once in awhile
they have a go at each other. it's never come to anything serious-
a bit of blood, dogs who have had to be separated- but when it
was over it's always been over.

but someday it could be otherwise. people who keep multiple pit bulls
always live with the chance that one day those dogs won't get along,
that one day the winds will change and they'll have two dogs who
cannot be together, period. there are people who make households work
with separated dogs. i don't envy them one bit. it can't be easy.

so i take what precautions i can, stop what fights i can before they
start. i only give extremely valuable goodies like fresh bones when
the dogs are in their crates (used bones are fine loose). i don't
allow humping or any blatant dominance displays. normal behavior?
sure. a big fight trigger? you better believe it. so it doesn't happen
here. because i said so.

and i keep my fingers crossed and hope that we will always have
peace and two puppies piled in my bed at night happily snoring.

others are somewhere else.

that people think that the things that you think about and tell them

everything is going swimmingly. the biting issue has been resolved
with a harness, but he's also learning/listening to commands better,
so there's not really much need to physically direct him now, which is
good.

he's sleeping upstairs on a dogbed on my bedroom floor at night
instead of in his crate, he's eating better (though he still takes for
freaking ever) and things have settled down so that it's not such a
three ring circus here. i am grateful.

this morning i invited him up on the bed for a snuggle and he hopped
up, spun around, flopped down, rolled on his back, and gazed at me so
adoringly. i am so glad he is here.

&lt; http://shattering.org/images/homerportrait.jpg &gt;

you know what's funny? i didn't meet him out of the kennel the first
time i saw him because he was humping his blanket non-stop and that
kinda grossed me out. he doesn't hump anything here.

my only gripes about him is that he's a wandering pooper, and that his
nails are so freaking disgustingly long but i can't take more than a
tiny sliver off the ends because his quicks are also so freaking long.
