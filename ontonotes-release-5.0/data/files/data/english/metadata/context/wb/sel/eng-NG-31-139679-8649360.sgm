1 PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER

This paper is a basic reference for important rules terms,
rules, and tournament rules. Beginners should read
especially chapters 2 and 3, players chapters 3 to 5,
tournament players and organizers chapter 6.

2 INFORMATION FOR BEGINNERS
2.1 What Must I Know as a Beginner?

The game is played on a grid board. Typically it has 19x19
intersections, but 9x9 are also fine. Two players compete.
The first player uses black stones, the other white.

The players alternate. A player may play or pass. Playing
is putting one's own stone on an empty intersection and
removing any surrounded opposing stones. To avoid
cycles, a play may not recreate any prior configuration of
all stones on the board.

Two successive passes end the game. Then the player with
more intersections wins. Intersections are his if only his
stones occupy or surround them.

2.2 Which Rules do I Need as a Beginner?

You can play with short rules as in 2.1. Other rules may
be different, but the game is the same, i. e. strategy,
tactics, and the score do not change. Extremely rare
exceptions confirm this rule.

The winner can be determined by area or by territory.
Either includes empty intersections surrounded only by own
stones. While area adds intersections occupied by own
stones, territory adds opposing prisoners instead.

All rules, except short rules, have further phases after
alternation and before scoring. Towards a game end it is
often clear which stones will be removed. The additional
phases allow the players to agree on which stones shall be
removed. Thereby final removals do not require alternation.

Whether you score by area or by territory or whether you
remove by alternation or by agreement should mainly depend
on which rules are used by people you play with.

2.3 Which Rules Should I Teach?

You should use a board with 9x9 intersections, short rules as
in 2.1, and count each player's score by using a finger to
scan the board for his intersections.

2.4 Where do I Find More Information?

3 IMPORTANT CONCEPTS

While strategy and tactics virtually remain the same,
concepts vary in different rules. However, the following
gives a comprehensive overview on standard terms.

3.1 Stone, String

The physical device that colours one intersection in a
play is a STONE. Two intersections of the board are
ADJACENT if they have a line but no intersection between
them. Two intersections with either black, white, or no
stones on them are CONNECTED if they are adjacent or if
there is a chain of adjacent intersections of their type
between them. A REGION consists of an intersection and
any intersections connected to it. A black or white
region is called a STRING.

3.2 Surrounded

An intersection of one colour is SURROUNDED by another
colour if each leaving path reaches the other colour first
after the one colour. Hereby it can only be surrounded
black by white, white by black, empty by black, or empty
by white. A region can be surrounded. For strings there is
an alternative notion of no liberty (or breath). A LIBERTY
of a string is an empty intersection adjacent to it. Thus
a string is surrounded if and only if it has no liberty.

3.3 Removal, Suicide

A removal empties the intersections of surrounded stones
if there are any. Hereby removal of opposing stones is
executed first, if necessary. Rules may either require or
forbid removal of own stones. This is called suicide or no
suicide. In practice, suicide might be used for so called ko
fights or in capturing races.

3.4 Capture, Prisoner

Rules that score territory call a removal a capture
because all removed stones are seriously kept as prisoners.

3.5 Move, Play, Pass

The players have alternate turns. On each turn a player makes
a move that is either a play or a pass. A play places one's
own stone on an empty intersection. It can then include
removal of surrounded stones, if any. A pass merely continues
alternation by giving the opponent the next turn.

3.6 Compensation

The first move advantage by black can be compensated by
compensation points (komi) that are added to the white score
after the game end. Komi can be adjusted by 0.5 to avoid
ties. Today integer values for komi for 19x19 boards
typically range between 5 and 7. For 13x13 boards one should
use 8, for 9x9 boards 6. -
A weaker player (black) can get the right to place an agreed
number of compensation stones (handicap) before white's first
play. Rules may allow free or fixed handicap. Free handicap
does not apply any restriction. Fixed handicap requires
traditional placement on set intersections.

3.7 Phases

Normally, a game consists of the phases alternation,
agreement, scoring. A game stop is between alternation and
agreement, the game end is between agreement and scoring,
and after scoring both players accept the counted score as
the result. The main part of the game is the alternation
phase. Special rules are invoked after it. Typically, two
successive passes in alternation are the game stop and start
the agreement phase. In it the players may agree on strings
to be removed. If they agree, then they remove those strings
from the board; this ends the game. Sometimes they might
disagree, then no strings are removed but alternation is
resumed as if the last game stop did not occur.

3.8 Recreation

The position is the pattern of black and white stones on the
board. Without extra rule a position might be repeated
infinitely. The easiest rule to prohibit this says: A play
may not recreate a position. This refers to positions after
completion of plays, i.e. after possible removals. The rule
is called &quot;superko&quot;. -
Some rules use concepts different from superko. They combine
a &quot;2-play rule&quot; with a &quot;long cycle rule&quot;. The first says:
Two successive plays may not recreate a position. The second
says: If a position is recreated after more than two moves,
then the game ends either immediately or, as a variant, as
soon as the players agree, with the result &quot;without result&quot;.
In practice the 2-play rule is sufficient for almost all
cases. It handles the relevant standard pattern of two
adjacent intersections. For superko this is just a special
application.

3.9 Scoring

The score is the result after the game end as defined by
the rules. There are two different scoring methods: area
scoring and territory scoring. Rules use one of them. Both
give the same result in almost all cases and both evaluate
the difference of the black and the white scores. A player's
AREA score is the sum of intersections with own stones and
of empty intersections surrounded only by own stones. Simply
speaking, a player's TERRITORY score is the sum of empty
intersections surrounded only by own stones and of prisoners
of opposing colour. With both scoring methods empty
intersections that are not surrounded by either black or
white are neutral.

3.10 Counting

A score must be determined by some mechanical procedure in
practice; this is called counting. There are various methods.
Some rules prescribe one. A possible method is to use one's
finger to count point by point. Other methods rearrange a lot
of stones on the board.

4 PARTICULAR RULES

Rules vary extremely. However, in practice they often give
the same result.

4.1 Short Rules

Examples of short rules are the Simple Rules or the
Tromp-Taylor rules. They have no game stop and no agreement
phase. Both are superfluous since necessary removals may
already be performed in the alternation phase. Two successive
passes end the game that is scored then. Short rules use area
scoring, superko, and suicide. Further settings are left for
tournament rules.

4.2 American Rules

These are used by the American Go Association. They use
situational superko, no suicide, and 7.5 komi. They permit
free or fixed handicap. Their most remarkable feature is to
allow one of area scoring or territory scoring. Herefore
pass stones (one prisoner compensates each pass) and white
moving last always ensure the same result, regardless of the
applied scoring method.

4.3 Chinese Rules

These are used in continental China and sometimes in other
countries. Area scoring and no suicide are used.

4.3.1 Official Chinese Rules

In practice, ko rules roughly amount to a 2-play rule and a
long cycle rule. The mentioned superko is overridden. The
counting is a sophisticated half counting, where empty
intersections and then after rearrangements stones of one
colour are added to be compared with half the non-neutral
intersections. The komi as a half komi is 3.75. In normal
full counting counts and komi would be twice as big.

4.3.2 Simplified Chinese Rules

Positional superko is used. A counting method is not
prescribed. The full komi should be 7.5.

4.4 Japanese Rules

The differences mainly affect handling of late game phases
but often do not alter scores. Japanese rules use some
traditional territory scoring that attempts to exclude so
called sekis. No suicide applies. The core of the ko rules
is a 2-play rule and a long cycle rule. Typically, komi is
6.5. Fixed handicap should be used. The counting is a
sophisticated rearrangement of empty intersections and
filling-in of prisoners.

4.4.1 Game Finishing Process

A game finishes with the following process: 1) So called
dame (neutral points) and defensive moves (necessary
connections etc. due to occupied dame) are filled.
2) The hypothetical analysis, which presumes perfect play,
determines so called life or death of each string

&gt; 6.3 Tie Breakers

&gt; Tie breakers can refine pairings or results. The first
&gt; criterion is always the number of wins (or McMahon points),
&gt; all further criteria, if any, are tie breakers. They attempt
&gt; a refinement where a low number of rounds and a tournament
&gt; system do not guarantee sufficient distinction between
&gt; players' achievements. However, they must be applied with
&gt; care since they are only marginally better than coin tossing.
&gt; The most important tie breakers are direct comparison, SOS,
&gt; SOS-2, SOSOS. An ordered combination, like SOS-SOSOS e.g.,
&gt; is possible: if numbers of wins are equal, then SOS applies,
&gt; if also SOS is equal, then SOSOS applies. -
&gt; Direct comparison acknowledges the winner of a game between
&gt; two players in question. SOS is the Sum of Opponents' Scores.
&gt; SOS adds up the numbers of wins of all opponents of a player.
&gt; SOS-2 is meant to improve SOS: For every player, the two
&gt; smallest opponents' values are ignored as noise. For all
&gt; opponents of a player, SOSOS adds up their SOS values to
&gt; indicate the performance of the opponents' opponents. -
">

Can Robert cite some major tournaments where SOS-1
and/or SOS-2 are applied?  Otherwise I think we will need to
conclude that Robert is being intellectually dishonest, and not
properly representing these actual events from the real world.
Fact of the matter:  SOS-1 and SOS-2 in general -reduce- the
quality of available decision-producing information and do not
achieve maximal entropy reduction (noise reduction) in statistics.
We are not eliminating outliers by resorting to SOS-1 and SOS-2.
Robert imagines that they reduce &quot;noise&quot; however their utilization
actually -contributes- more of that &quot;noise&quot; than takes it away.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; While tie breakers are a nice tool for easing a pairing
&gt; program's life, the luck of a first round pairing tends to
&gt; have greater influence on a tournament's results after the
&gt; last round than tie breakers. Therefore it is a good idea to
&gt; issue shared places for all players with the same number of
&gt; wins (or McMahon points). Also one must fairly assign SOS
&gt; points for opponents missing in some round; enforcing
&gt; participation is preferable especially for top players. -
">

Surely first-round pairing is crucial, however Robert seems
to assume that &quot;luck&quot; is present only at this juncture.  Any &quot;luck&quot;
is more correctly characterized as a persistent phenomena which
in part we are also attempting to measure during the course of a
tournament.  Players with consistent &quot;luck&quot; are -expected- to win.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 6.4 Pairing

&gt; Pairings must be fair, precise, and consider prior
&gt; achievements during a tournament. One should consider colour
&gt; balance and no pair twice, one might also aim at avoiding a
&gt; pair of players from the same club or country, depending on
&gt; a tournament's intentions. Pairings might be done manually
&gt; in small tournaments; for most tournaments pairing programs
&gt; should be used. These can create fair pairings convincingly,
&gt; some even watch global balance.
">

It turns out that selection of proper pairing strategy has more to
do with entropy reduction than the particular tiebreaking method.
Best pairing obtained appears to be &quot;slide pairing.&quot;  Of course
Robert doesn't say anything about this because he seeks to be not
very informative whenever he publishes his unofficial Rules FAQ.
Yet &quot;information&quot; is precisely what we are trying to obtain when
conducting a games tournament.  If there seems to be an echo
chamber in here it's due largely to some fundamental ignorance.
Robert already knows what to expect when he publishes that FAQ.

There are some guidelines but not too much that is mandatory.

We admit there is a restricted set of players who form the top core
from which we expect there is a winner.  In other words, each player
may be assessed as having likely chances to win first place, or not.
There is also another set of players who are unlikely to place.  You
may also ask them and they will agree that they are unlikely to place.
Of course it is unfair to pair players from one group against the other
group in the First Round, unless ALL top players are paired against a
player from the unlikely group.  The TD needs to &quot;pair down&quot; to some
degree (meaning &quot;slide pairing&quot;) else a strong player might become
unfairly depressed throughout successive round pairings.

">

Quite obviously, the larger that &quot;x&quot; is in your SOS-x, the less
information that is made available for assessing tournament standing.
We agree that a very large value for &quot;x&quot; is a very bad idea; now use
induction to prove that lesser values for &quot;x&quot; only reduce the very bad
idea to something not quite as bad.  Yet there is no &quot;zero-crossing&quot;
to convert reduction of a bad idea into something positve above zero.
The likelihood of a bad pairing for Round One is very much less than
the likelihood of many good pairings for Round One, because TD's
are enshrined into their priesthood by virtue of sensible experience.

We may also need to re-examine this notion you try to advance:
that somehow there is some property of the part that cannot be made
to apply to the whole.  If I may divide the field of players into bands
I may just as well move the bandsizes around, even into unequal
portions.  As I increase the size of a bandsize it's fundamental part
properties do not disappear once making bandsize into total size.

The only argument you can try to present that could disallow
extending properties of the whole to each of the parts would be that
of the neutral SODOS contribution within each McMahon band.  Yet
if SODOS is neutral then adding or subtracting zero within a band
has no effect upon whether parts of a whole may extend to a band.
Furthermore, we are also speaking of the &quot;dark horse&quot; possibility
when an  unlikely player emerges from First Round to win overall.
So that's a &quot;band crossover&quot; problem, even when a top group has
been accorded McMahon bonus from the outset.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Robert seems to assume that &quot;luck&quot; is present only at this juncture.
&gt; No. (If the FAQ suggest such, please be more specific.)

Quoting from Robert's FAQ:

&quot;Wile tie breakers are a nice tool for easing a pairing
program's life, the luck of a first round pairing tends
to have greater influence on a tournament's results
after the last round than tie breakers.&quot;

That's your singular occurrance of the technical term &quot;luck.&quot;
What is being suggested by Robert is that this is the only occasion
for &quot;luck&quot; in the course of a tournament (or in paragraphs of a FAQ).
A fact of the matter:  the greater influence on a tournament's results
is due to ALL rounds, and ALL pairing applications.  The sum total of
ALL rounds by far exceeds greatly only that of First Round.  Indeed,
a &quot;close pairing&quot; (rank adjacency pairing) in First Round can have
the effect of nullifying tournament results altogether, when -MANY-
stronger players are marginalized into &quot;struggling&quot; against weaker
opponents.  Errors introduced by such methods far exceed Robert's
anxiety over that error due only to a First Round pairing between
strong and weak.  As I have stated, neither adjacency pairing nor
slaughter pairing are optimal.  In between those extremes we may
find &quot;slide pairing.&quot;

Pairing strategies have been researched and continue to be
researched.  Pairing is crucial to validation of tiebreaking methods.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Best in the sense of minimizing tiebreaking errors due to your
anxieties over First Round discrepancies, and best in the sense for
minimizing overall entropy, i.e. maximizing the entropy reduction.

Of course it's a fallacious notion that you must do all of the research.

without your rubber-stamp of approval.

Let's define &quot;pairing inaccuracy&quot; to mean degree to which a player
is paired from a position at variance to that player's &quot;ultimate rank.&quot;
Meaning that, once we have arrived at what we believe to be the
rank order of those players at the end of a Round (could be &quot;at the
end of Round Zero&quot;) we then apply some pairing strategy to sort
out the impending Round.  If we have applied a pairing strategy
based upon wildly imprecise estimations then that Round was paired
with many &quot;pairing inaccuracies.&quot;

I many interpret your anxiety concerning Round One Pairing
to mean that you suspect it may contain many &quot;pairing inaccuracies&quot;
or deliberated pairings based upon a very much incorrect estimation
of the initial rank order.  For purposes of the tournament perhaps it is
more likely to encounter &quot;pairing inaccuracies&quot; for Round One than
for successive Rounds.  Players arrived at the tournament reporting
ranks highly inflated (or deflated) from what is to become determined
by the tournament as &quot;actual rank&quot; for its own internal purposes.  It is
of course the intention of proper pairing strategy to reduce the amount
of &quot;pairing inaccuracy&quot; as the tournament progresses.

Your hypothesis, concerning SOS-x, seems based upon a high
value being assigned (by yourself) to the initial &quot;pairing inaccuracy.&quot;
Your counterargument against my inductive procedure, from SOS-x
to SOS-(x-1), to SOS-(x-2), down to SOS-(x-(x-1)), seems to suggest
that &quot;pairing inaccurcy&quot; thoroughly obliterates straightforward tendency
for induction when passing from SOS-(x-(x-2)) to SOS-(x-(x-1)).  Yet
the straightforward tendency of induction is extremely strong, because
we are discussing merely the aspect of statistical propensity without any
special case analysis being applied to exceptional rank discrepancies.
To be certain, there is a set of exceptional rank discrepancies but we
cannot know in advance just exactly who is being comprised in that set.
Prior to Round One there was every effort made to avoid all exceptional
rank discrepancies !

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The likelihood of a bad pairing for Round One is very much less than
&gt;&gt; the likelihood of many good pairings for Round One,
&gt; How do you define &quot;bad pairing&quot; for this?
">

I will substitute the phrase &quot;sum of pairing inaccuracies&quot; for &quot;bad
pairing.&quot;  Once deciding to apply &quot;slide pairing&quot; or some alternative,
then an inverse pairing procedure should generate expected rank order.
By no means should avoidance of the phrase &quot;bad pairing&quot; preclude
strong players from being matched with weaker players.  It merely
refers to whether the inverse of intended pairing corresponds to rank.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; We may also need to re-examine this notion you try to advance:
&gt;&gt; that somehow there is some property of the part that cannot be made
&gt;&gt; to apply to the whole.
&gt; Yes.
">

I am referring to need to re-examine, not to the truth or falsity
of the re-examined proposition.  If I may adjust bandsizes using some
similar analysis then nothing seems particularly special about any parts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That's your singular occurrance of the technical term &quot;luck.&quot;
&gt;&gt; What is being suggested by Robert is that this is the only occasion
&gt;&gt; for &quot;luck&quot; in the course of a tournament (or in paragraphs of a FAQ).
&gt; Tha latter. The former would be overinterpretation.
">

A tournament director unaware of the statistics for round-by-round
&quot;pairing inaccuracy&quot; cound introduce many variables explained by &quot;luck.&quot;
