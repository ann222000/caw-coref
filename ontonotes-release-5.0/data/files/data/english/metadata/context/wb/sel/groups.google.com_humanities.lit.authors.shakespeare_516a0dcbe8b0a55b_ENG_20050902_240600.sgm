These Latin poems are written in &quot;elegiac couplets&quot;, each couplet consisting
of a dactylic hexameter followed by a dactylic pentameter with a marked
medial caesura. (The dactyls may, at some points required or permitted by
the accepted rules, be replaced by spondees.) They are &quot;sonnets&quot; only in
the NSOED &quot;rare&quot; sense of &quot;a short poem or piece of esp. lyrical and amatory
verse&quot;. As far as I know there was no standard classical or Renaissance
six-line verse form in elegiacs.

I couldn't find translations but the following may be of some use. Perhaps
others will correct or improve my attempt.

Robert Greene, MA of both universities, concerning himself

I am one for whom life was laughter, gossip, parties, girls, idle writing of
little books: prodigal of passion as was when I saw Spring and Summer, with
the Dog I say goodbye to Autumn and Winter. The bubble of wit, the fluff of
art, the penny-whistle of loving - is there any pipe that does not [now]
lament with a wretched tune?

and

Gabriel Harvey, for the much-missed soul of his brother John

But it was the younger's task to write a funeral ode for the elder, had not
the brutal law of Fate forbidden it. Why should I cry out to no avail,
brother, most brotherly of brothers? All pleasant things have gone: only sad
things remain. I am nothing but a corpse, filthy in a verminous garment;
though he dwells in heaven, I bid a tearful farewell to him.

NOTES

1. &quot;Idle&quot; or &quot;empty&quot; for &quot;vana&quot; seems to fit the context of life as no more
than fun, but another meaning for &quot;vana&quot; is &quot;boastful, puffed-up&quot;, and a
looser version could be &quot;showing off by writing little books&quot;: that may be
his self-accusation.

I don't understand the reference to &quot;the Dog&quot;. It may be a reference to the
dog-days in the year, when malign influences were supposed to be at work.
(There isn't a misprint or mistyping, is there? There is certainly an error
in the title, where &quot;vtirusq.&quot; must be &quot;vtriusq.&quot;)

&quot;pluma&quot; is properly fluffy feathering, down - not a full-size feather
(&quot;pinna&quot;).

&quot;Fistula Amandi&quot; - &quot;fistula&quot; is &quot;a tube&quot;, and hence sometimes a sort of
whistle or musical pipe. In this line, he is saying that everything once so
important to him now seems trivial and impermanent - the bubble bursts, down
is blown away, the pipe is broken. &quot;Avena&quot; in the next line means literally
&quot;oat straw&quot;, and is another word in pastoral verse for a shepherd's
improvised pipe.

&quot;Amandi&quot; is the gerund, a form that usually carries an implication of duty
or compulsion.

2. &quot;Fraterimme&quot; is presumably Greene's own coining.

&quot;Funus&quot; can mean &quot;funeral&quot; or the corpse itself. The garment is &quot;pullato&quot;,
which ought to mean &quot;having sprouedt, germinated&quot;. I assume (not too
plausibly) that it means &quot;breeding lice or other vermin&quot;: the mourner is as
foul in his dress and hygiene as a rotting corpse. Can someone do better?
&quot;Squallidus&quot; normally has a single l.

Yes, that's more exact. It's always said to be a pentameter, but it feels
more like a hexameter with two incomplete feet. There's a slight jolt and
often a pause in each pentameter as one crosses the caesura, and it seems a
curious form for Ovid to have used for lengthy poems such as the Amores and
Fasti. Green uses it pretty well, I think, in these two brief elegies.

If there are non-Latinate readers here, they might like the English elegiac
couplet dinned into me at school as a mnemonic: of course the English is
accentual, not quantitative, verse, but the pattern is similar..

Down in a deep, dark ditch lay an old cow munching a beanstalk;
| - uu | - - | - uu | - - | - uu | - - |
Out of her mouth popped one, yesterday's dinner and tea.
| - uu | - - | - (-) | - uu | - uu | - (-)

An interesting word: there is &quot;If I do, dog worry my uncle&quot;, a phrase
implying refusal on being asked to do anything contrary to one's wishes.

There are some 7 definitions which are Elizabethan including one direct from
Chaucer, &quot;a dogge for the bow&quot;, which may be a figure.

&gt;&quot;Amandi&quot; is the gerund, a form that usually carries an implication of duty

And this /emphasis?/ on duty may support my first meaning above.

There are some 30 hyphenated terms of DOG~ which are Elizabethan or earlier,
including DOG-APE; the dog-faced baboon, a species first described by Gesner
in 1551, and something which could be figured upon by an academic such as
Greene.

I am more puzzled by Fraterimme, and you must decide if the [A. Sax] context
below serves the contemporary possibility:-

For he ne myzte no lenger forthe prolonge
The venym hid that frat so at his herte

/MS Digby, 230

Which I think means: gnawed, devoured.

A strict defintion of FRATEr would render this:

A person who solicited alms under the pretence of their being for an
hospital. //Fraternitye of Vacabondes// 1575. The exact period, but do we
deal with pig-Latin of the period [?] or something older like:-

FRATOUR:

A temperance servede in the fratour, that scho to ylkone so lukes that
mesure be over alle, that none over mekille nere over lyttille ete ne
drynke.

/MS Lincoln, A i 17 f. 273

Which would refer to the frater-house.

Re. the following:

I don't understand the reference to &quot;the Dog&quot;. It may be a reference
to the dog-days in the year, when malign influences were supposed to be
at work. (There isn't a misprint or mistyping, is there?

Comment:

In Saga Myth of 13th century Iceland, the &quot;dog&quot; concept is associated
with the Dog Star Sirius and, in the masterpiece Saga of Burnt Niall,
the &quot;dog&quot; Sámr is one of three gifts received by the saga's Solar Hero
Gunnarr Hámundarson.

In the Penguin edition of the saga, the account thereof is as follows:

When they parted, Olaf said, 'I want to give you three gifts: a gold
bracelet, a cloak that once belonged to King Myrkjartan of Ireland, and
a dog I was given in Ireland. He is a big animal, and will make as
good a comrade-in-arms as a powerful man. He has human intelligence,
and he will bark at every man he recognizes as your enemy, but never at
your friends; he can tell from a man's face whether he means you well
or not. He would lay down his life rather than fail you. His name is
Sam.'

Then he said to the dog, 'Go with Gunnar and serve him as well as you
can.'

The dog went to Gunnar at once and lay down at his feet. (Ch. 70)

***

As it happens, the Dog concept is invoked three times in the only
Shakespeare play in which Iceland (Island) is mentioned - Henry V, Act
II, Sc. i:

Bar.
Good Lieutenant, good Corporal offer nothing heere.
Nym.
Pish.
Pist.
Pish for thee, Island *dogge*: thou prickeard *cur* of Island.
Host.
Good Corporall Nym shew thy valor, and put vp your sword.
Nym.
Will you shogge off? I would haue you solus.
Pist.
Solus, egregious *dog*? O Viper vile;
The solus in thy most meruailous face,
the solus in thy teeth, and in thy throate,
and in thy hatefull Lungs, yea in thy Maw perdy;
and which is worse, within thy nastie mouth.
I do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can take,
and Pistols cocke is vp, and flashing fire will follow.

***

The Dog concept is associated with both Robert Greene and Christopher
Marlowe in Shakespeare Myth.

1. &quot;In his own phrase he fell again with the *dog* to his old vomit,&quot;
wrote Schoenbaum of Robert Greene's relapse into his old ways after
praying that the Lord send him grace to amend and become a new man.

2. &quot;Dead is the *Dog* of spite&quot;, it is reported of Greene in Sonnet #
I of &quot;Greenes Memoriall, Or certaine Funerall Sonnets&quot;.

3. &quot;But see what a hooke the Lord put in the nostrils of this barking
*dogge*...&quot; wrote Thomas Beard of Marlowe in 'The Theatre of God's
Judgement&quot;.

***

So what's with the Dog?

The Saga of Burnt Niall offers one clear clue - when his enemies
encircle Gunnar and, eventually, kill him, the first thing they do was
to have someone Sámr viewed as Gunnar's friend lead the Dog away to
slaughter.

As they prepared to drive an axe into its head, the Dog recognized them
as enemies and attacked and bit one of them in the groin - as the axe
finished it off, the Dog let out an ear-piercing scream.

Compare the oath said to have flown out of Marlowe's mouth at the
moment of death in Beard's account.

A second clue resides in the Cipher Value of the Dog's name - Sámr,
2332, as in 2322 + 10 = 2332.

When the last of the arsonists, who burned Niall and his family in
their farmstead, is decapitated at Saga's end, &quot;the head spoke ten as
it flew off the body&quot; - in the context, this alludes to mythical
Father, 10, whose 'wounded name' is to be 'healed' through the union of
Two - Male and Female - Fives.

As in Prince Hamlet's address to King Claudius in Act V, Sc. ii -

&quot;Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion; - is thy *union* here?&quot;

The residual Cipher Value 2322 links the Dog to the Sun's waning power
after Autumnal Equinox through the Mithraic imagery of the
'torchbearer' Cautopates, 5857, and the associated Zodiac sign of
Scorpio, 4594, who gain the upper hand at Autumnal Equinox over their
Vernal Equinox counterparts, the 'torchbearer' Cautes, 3518, and the
Zodiac sign Taurus, 4611 as in 5857 + 4594 - 3518 - 4611 = 2322.

***

And how might all this relate to Shakespeare Myth?

In several ways, including the following:

First. The torch of 'torchbearer' Cautopates is always shown turned
*down* - as in the pictorial representation in Elizabethan England of
the motto &quot;Qvod me alit me extinguit', a variation of which - Qvod me
nutrit me destruit or That which nourishes me also destroys me - is
inscribed on what purports to be Marlowe's portrait.

Second. In Cipher Language, the waning of the Sun's Power after
Autumnal Equinox, 2322, is a function of Light of the World's, 1000,
incarnation in mythical Brownswerd, - 4000 as in 2322 - 1000 + 4000 =
5322.

Alias Gulielmus, 5322.

Third. The Cipher Value of the Marlovian motto, Qvod me nutrit me
destruit, 14144, is mirrored in the Cipher Value of what purports to be
a *copy* of the burial entry of one Will Shakspere gent, 10026, on
April 25, 1616, as in 10026 + 2502 + 1616 = 14144.

Fourth. As for the 'union' in 'death' - 'destruction' - of Claudius,
4470, and Gertrude, 4520, it signals advent of Brave New World, 8990 as
in 4470 + 4520 = 8990.

And what might all this mean?

As I understand it, the Sun's Dog aspect is Light's Shadow 'brother' -
that is, the Dog and the Solar Hero are *twin* manifestations of Cosmic
Creative Power at the level of Archetypal Stratfordian.

Alias Every Man.

Hence the admonition by the Privy Council that Her Majesty was not
amused by Marlowe being &quot;defamed by those ignorant in the affairs he
went about.&quot;

Hence the placement on record by the Shakespeare Authors of 'evidence'
that Christopher Marlowe 'survived' his 'death' - for the Stratfordian
*of record* embodies the human condition.

Prodigal of poetic rage I looked on Spring and Summer,
To Autumn and Winter I say goodbye at the same time as the
Dog does.

Yes, it is Sirius, which when it rises and sets with the sun
'parches head and knees and the flesh is dried up with heat'
(Hesiod, Works and Days 587-8). That is in July-August.
'When the power of the bitter sun relaxes its sweaty heat
and great Zeus rains after harvest and mortal flesh turns
much more supple - for then the star Sirius passes little
during the day over the heads of men who live by labour, but
increases his share of the night ...' (ibid. 415-9).

SPER: is A. Sax for 'point'. There are 7 distinct meanings, or rather
variants, and here is the main sufficiently surrounded to allow a
non-figurative context.

And till the sunne was at mydday spere,
On golde and sylke and on wolles softe,
With hir hondes she wolde worche ofte.
/Lydgate, ms Ashm. 39 f. 8

Palsgrave uses it as &quot;to fasten&quot;, as is more formalised in SPEREL, linking
both spellings.
SPER is also used (1) to prop up; to support, still in use c.1800 according
to Craven Gloss. ii. 158

A SPERKET is a wooden hooked large peg, not much curved, to hang saddles, &amp;c
on. &quot;Spurget&quot; according to Ray; &quot;a tagge or piece of wood to hang any thing
upon;&quot; and continues &quot;but we always pronounce the 'k'. it is like perk, but
the latter is supported at both ends, for fowls to perch on. //Moor. p. 382

Spellings of &quot;speer&quot; seem all north of Eng and are architectural, and a
&quot;spurtle&quot; is also a small stick [North]. &quot;Spurre&quot; is same as &quot;Spere&quot;. And
finally; a spur is attached to the foot and may as well be of sharpened
wood!

Cordially, Phil Innes

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Funus&quot; can mean &quot;funeral&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am more puzzled by Fraterimme, and you must decide if the [A. Sax]
&gt;&gt;&gt; context below serves the contemporary possibility:-

&gt;&gt;&gt; For he ne myzte no lenger forthe prolonge
&gt;&gt;&gt; The venym hid that frat so at his herte

&gt;&gt;&gt; /MS Digby, 230

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which I think means: gnawed, devoured.

&gt;&gt; I don't think these speculations are necessary. &quot;-erimmus&quot; is a standard
&gt;&gt; Latin superlative suffix, meaning the same as &quot;-issimus&quot; but preferred
&gt;&gt; for words ending in -er. It's just very odd to have it attached to a
&gt;&gt; noun, which is why I assume Greene coined it. (The -e ending is the
&gt;&gt; vocative case.)

&gt; yes - you are likely right. though its common enough to see latin suffixes
&gt; indifferently attached to A.Norman [O.F.] nouns

The oddity that nouns aren't usually thought of as permitting comparative
and superlative, and I couldn't find an instance of &quot;fraterimmus&quot; in
Lewis&amp;Short.

&gt;&gt; Your &quot;frat&quot; must be related to words such as &quot;fretwork&quot;, as you evidently
&gt;&gt; suppose. &quot;For he could no longer extend [his resistance to] the hidden
&gt;&gt; poison that gnawed so [potently] at his heart.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&quot;Funede&quot; must be the same as &quot;foined&quot;, meaning &quot;thrust&quot;. What do you
&gt;&gt; understand by &quot;sperls&quot;? &quot;When the armies met, with xxxx they vigorously
&gt;&gt; thrust&quot;. It's not a misprint for &quot;speres&quot;, is it?

Fine, then: those examples with an l settle the matter, and one should
presumably translate as &quot;weapons&quot; or even &quot;spears&quot;.
