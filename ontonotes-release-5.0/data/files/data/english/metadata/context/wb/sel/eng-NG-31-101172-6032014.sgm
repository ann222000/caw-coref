Much To Do with Nothing

Much To Do with Nothing
Copyright (c) 2007 Travel Alberta, All Rights Reserved
Written by: Travel Alberta

It almost goes without saying that hiking in the Rocky Mountains
is a free activity. The same is true of mountain biking, provided
you bring your wheels with you. Otherwise, you'll need to rent.
For a rare mountain treat, though, it's tough to beat swimming.
What's that? You thought the water would be too cold? It's true
that the lakes at this elevation are mostly snow run-off from the
mountains, but there are a few gems that provide a cool in the
chilly sense of the word opportunity to shed the heat of a hot
summer day. One in particular is found just off Minnewanka Lake
Road, close to Banff. Take the turnoff to Johnson Lake, and
you'll find a small sandy beach at the foot of crystal clear
waters fringed by majestic mountains. It's a favorite spot with
the locals (and somewhat of a local secret) so you won't find a
lot of crowds at this charming swimming hole.

History and Culture

As Canada's first national park, Banff is rich with historical
and cultural attractions, many of which are free to enjoy. At
Canada Place, open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., May through September, you
can discover Canada  in a variety of family-oriented interactive
exhibits that highlight the land and people of Canada. You'll
find another free attraction close by, at the colorful Cascade
Gardens, where a traditional teepee is set up from July to
September. This is the Siksika Nation Interpretive Centre, where
interpreters can introduce you to the lore and culture of the
mountain-based Siksika Nation. Every Tuesday at noon, the centre
puts on a free display of drumming and dancing.

Truly "Campy" Entertainment

In all of the Rocky Mountain parks, campgrounds are a hotspot of
activity. They're also excellent places to enjoy free
entertainment. Many campgrounds have amphitheatres, where park
interpreters stage live drama and educational theatre programs.
Always a hit with families, the campground theatre programs are
more than just free"¦they're also fun.

Music in the Mountains

There's something almost spiritual about music played at this
altitude. And something almost heavenly about the
price...nothing! A local favorite in Banff is the Serenade at St.
George's (June 21, 28, July 5, 12, 19, 26, August 2, 9) held in
the evenings at St. George's In The Pines Anglican Church on
Beaver Street. The chamber music is truly uplifting. For daytime
music in Banff, be sure to check out Music at Noon (June 22, 29,
July 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27, 28, August 3, 4, 10, 11) held at
Rolston Recital Hall in the world-famous Banff Centre for the
Performing Arts. Here, the music on tap ranges from baroque to
classical, and from jazz to contemporary. Not far away, in
Canmore, you can enjoy more musical treats in a mountain setting.
At Canmore Mondays (June 20, 27, July 4, 11, 18, 25) you can
listen to soloists and chamber musicians fill Creekside Hall with
their inspiring notes.

Knock Knock!

On June 18 and 19 in Banff, you get the chance to enter buildings
you might not otherwise have access to and learn about the
historical, cultural or architectural significance of some of
Banff's finest buildings. It's all part of Doors Open Banff,
with sites open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. both days. The Doors Open
Banff Information Centre is located in the Old Crag and Canyon
Cabin at the corner of Lynx Street and Bear Street, and brochures
will be available at Banff Town Hall and the Visitor Information
Centre.

Sweet and Savory

When you're strolling the streets of Banff, Jasper, Canmore and
Waterton, you'll be tempted by the sights and smells of candy,
barbecues and restaurants galore. Some even offer free samples
and treats. For example, it's not unusual to pick up a chunk of
fudge at the Fudgery on Banff Avenue. And if you stop at
Melissa's Restaurant &amp; Bar on Lynx Street in Banff, you can
treat yourself to free popcorn.
