****************************************
EUREKA Inter-Parliamentary Conference,
Den Haag, 26 and 27 May, 2005
*****************************************

&quot;Honourable Ministers,
Members of Parliament,
Ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to thank the Dutch Parliament and the EUREKA Chairmanship
for inviting me to speak at this conference.

I have gladly accepted the invitation because the topics you are
addressing - the Lisbon strategy, the European Research Area and the
role of EUREKA - are at the heart of the debate on the kind of Europe
we want for the future.

In the weeks and months to come, politicians and citizens will have to
make choices on what Europe we want, for ourselves and for our
children.

===============================================
The Lisbon strategy and knowledge for growth
===============================================

The European Commission, for its part, has clearly stated what Europe
it wants to realise, namely a Europe that promotes prosperity,
solidarity and security.

It has proposed to re-launch the Lisbon strategy that European leaders
defined in 2000 and to re-invigorate it by focusing on growth and
employment in a stronger partnership with Member States.

The reason why we decided to put the Lisbon strategy at the heart of
our programme and why Member States and the European Parliament have
broadly endorsed it is, quite simply, because its success will
determine to what extent we will be able to preserve, and possibly
strengthen, the European way of life.

In the face of increasing global competition, we have to work together
and exploit the unique resource that we have: knowledge, relying on the
creativity and the brains of all our citizens.

Building the knowledge society and leveraging knowledge for growth is
probably the best, and maybe the only, way to sustain our European
model of society, if we don't want to make a trade-off between
economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection.

We cannot and do not want to compete on low wages. Even if we have to
reform our social security systems, they will always be more generous
than our trading partners. And we will not accept to compete on the
back of our environment.

That is why knowledge-based growth must become the motor of sustainable
competitiveness and welfare in Europe.

Of course, I do not refer to knowledge in the sense of just knowing
more for its own sake. When I talk about knowledge, I refer to the
whole chain of knowledge which leads to sustainable growth.

Europe, its citizens and its enterprises, must build world-class
leadership in the way we produce knowledge through research, in the way
we diffuse knowledge through education and in the way we use and apply
knowledge through innovation.

We call this the knowledge triangle, which can only function well and
produce the economic and societal value we expect from it if it is
integrated in adequate framework conditions, such as proper fiscal
incentives, good collaboration between industry and academia, and a
general scientific culture.

Knowledge is a factor of competitiveness. European enterprises can only
achieve leadership in global markets if Europe takes the lead as an
economy and society of knowledge. If we cannot be the cheapest, we have
to be the best.

The emerging markets in which our companies compete are increasingly
global and technology-intensive. By raising the knowledge capacity of
our firms, our competitive advantage can be based on providing the best
new products, services and processes in the world.

But knowledge does not only create competitive businesses. It also
allows society to make progress. Progress in fields such as health,
environment and energy largely depend on the advancement of knowledge.

We are already strong in knowledge, but we can become much stronger if
we pool together our efforts in an intelligent way, if we have our best
researchers work together and compete for excellence, if we create an
internal market for knowledge.

If a Union of 455 million people chooses to realise knowledge Europe, I
can see a bright future for Europe.

====================
European Research
====================

For the first time, with the new Lisbon strategy fully endorsed by all
EU institutions, we have a coherent programme to make knowledge Europe
happen.

It is in this context that the European Commission presented on 6 April
its proposals for the future EU research programmes, known as the 7th
Framework Programme, which would run from 2007 to 2013.

I am strongly encouraged by the very positive reception our proposals
have had.

The Commission's proposals for research may seem ambitious, as we are
proposing to double the budgets.

But in light of the the challenges we face to preserve our way of life,
the broad commitment we have to the Lisbon strategy and the
opportunities and needs we see to realise knowledge Europe, the
proposal to double the R&amp;D budget is rather modest.

I say this without irony: a doubling of European research funds is the
bare minimum of a sound proposal to restructure not only the EU budget
but indirectly also the national budgets towards growth and jobs.

We have to realise that the EU is investing too little in research. We
invest, all 25 countries, public and private sector together, 2% of our
GDP in research. That compares with 2,7% in the US and 3% in Japan.
Interestingly, South Korea is already today at 2,9% of GDP and China at
1,5%, which is more than a number of EU Member States.

We also have to realise that EU research funding has a strong leverage
and multiplier effect, both on national research budgets and on private
R&amp;D investments.

Even though it only represents 6% of public R&amp;D spending in the EU,
roughly the equivalent of Daimler-Chrysler's research budget, the
EU's Framework Progamme is a powerful instrument for leveraging
knowledge for growth. It focuses on consolidating our strengths,
addressing our weaknesses, serving the needs of our industry and
enhancing knowledge and technology transfer across the whole European
Union.

Our proposal for the 7th Framework Programme is built around 4
objectives, corresponding to 4 programmes:

(*) The Cooperation programme, where the objective is to gaining
leadership in key scientific and technology sectors by working together
across borders between industry, academia and public authorities. We
see a very strong role for industry in this cooperation, notably
through industry-led technology platforms.
(*) The Ideas programme, where the objective is to stimulate excellence
and creativity in frontier, higher-risk research which will provide the
basis for tomorrow's breakthrough innovations. This programme will
fund individual teams of researchers, competing for the first time at
European level on the sole criterion of excellence.
(*) The People programme, with the objective of supporting researcher
mobility, training and careerd development.
(*) And, fourthly, the Capacities programme through which the EU can
build the capacities it will need in the knowledge economy, for example
in terms of research infrastructures, innovating SMEs and people
interested in science.

FP7 also proposes to introduce a novel risk-sharing finance facility
aimed at improving access to EIB (European Investment Bank) loans for
large European research actions, in particular, large collaborative
research projects or new research infrastructures.

===============================
Doing more for R&amp;D in Europe
===============================

By focusing on actions where there is real added value at European
level, by overcoming duplication and fragmentation and by mobilising
our scientific community to create knowledge Europe, coupled with a
simplification of procedures, I am confident that the 7th Framework
Programme will deliver and will provide very good value for money.

Obviously, the Framework Programme alone will not suffice.

We will have to get the proper framework conditions in place, as I
mentioned before, in particular to boost private sector R&amp;D investment
and innovation.

And national budgets and policies have to follow suit. Fortunately, as
a result of the Lisbon agenda, R&amp;D and innovation is now high on most
national agendas.

Nearly all Member States have set national targets regarding research
investment. If these are met, research investment will come close to
2.6 % by 2010 - a real improvement on the current level of about 2 %.

=====================
The role of EUREKA
=====================

Let me now turn to the role played by EUREKA.

Through the hundreds of projects it has initiated in its 20 years of
existence, EUREKA has significantly contributed to the competitiveness
of our industry. It has contributed, in complementary ways to the EU
Framework Programmes, to fostering trans-national cooperation.

Even if Member States have not supported EUREKA as effectively as they
could have done in recent years, I am convinced EUREKA can remain a
strong framework for catalysing R&amp;D in Europe.

The 2004 EUREKA Ministerial Conference in Paris called for a stronger
national support of EUREKA projects. At the same time, ministers made a
plea for a strengthened cooperation of EUREKA with the Commission.

As European Commissioner for Research, I want to follow up on this and
explore all possible synergies and complementarities between the EU and
the EUREKA actions in research.

To develop a partnership between EUREKA and the Commission, two
initiatives are currently under discussion:

(*) an enhanced cooperation in the framework of European Technology
Platforms and - possibly - Joint Technology Initiatives, and
(*) the launch of a specific activity in favour of research-intensive
SMEs.

The Dutch Chairmanship of EUREKA is actively pursuing both initiatives
in close cooperation with the Commission services.

In fact, EUREKA Clusters are already participating actively in the
definition of key European Technology Platforms and Joint Technology
Initiatives, notably in the area of information and communication
technologies.

Let me also briefly address the second possible initiative related to
SMEs.

At the general policy level, we consider that the launch of a number of
new Art. 169 initiatives would make a significant contribution to the
realisation of the European Research Area.

The EUREKA initiative addresses a critical sector of European industry
- that of research-intensive SMEs. Building on its intrinsic strength
in this sector, EUREKA has the potential to make a real contribution
towards the integration of important parts of national programmes in
favour of research-intensive SMEs.

In such a way, we would make the European Research Area concrete for a
group of key players in our knowledge economy, the SMEs that drive
research and innovation.

If such a scheme has the required quality and European ambition, I
trust that we can muster the necessary support among Member States to
contribute from the EU budget.

This would obviously require that we have the necessary financial means
in FP7.

=============
Conclusion
=============

Ladies and gentlemen,

There have been several moments in its history when the EU has been at
a cross roads.

This time, the EU is at a cross roads as it is to decide on the
financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013.

It comes down to choosing what kind of Europe we want: a Europe of the
past that serves to redistribute existing wealth? Or a Europe of the
future, that thrives on knowledge and ensures sustainable prosperity
for its people.

Let there be no misunderstanding: the 1% proposal that is advocated by
the group of net contributing countries to the EU would lead to a
reduction of the EU budget - € 9 billion in 2007 compared to 2006.

And let's not have any illusions: this reduction is unlikely to
happen in agriculture or in structural funds; it will happen in the
budgets that hold the key to our future, those of R&amp;D and innovation.

Allow me therefore to say that the decision on the financial
perspectives is a moment of truth.

I know that you, members of Parliament, are well aware of what is at
stake. Your personal engagement and support is essential in helping
Europe meet its ambitious objective.

With your active help, the financial perspectives can become a golden
opportunity for Member States to demonstrate that they are truly
committed to the Lisbon strategy, not only in words but also in deeds.

Thank you for your attention.&quot;
