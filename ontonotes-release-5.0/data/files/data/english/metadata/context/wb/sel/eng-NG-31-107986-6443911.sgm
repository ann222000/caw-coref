I made up a Wee Heavy Scotch Ale and wanted it to have a bit of a smoke
character, so I added 1lb of peated malt.  I tasted it after a week
when it was transfered to secondary and the smoke was a bit more than I
wanted.  I wanted a background note and it was a mild foreground
flavor.  I tried it again last night after racking to keg (2 weeks from
brew) and the smoke flavor seems stronger now than it was last week.
The beer needs a little aging time as it is, but I'm wondering what to
expect from the smoke...  Will it mellow over the next few weeks or
will it maintain its flavor?

I'm not sure how it will age, I'd say it'll mellow but that's just a guess.

FWIW, traditionally the smokiness comes from the yeast.  They don't
actually use peated malt in beer brewing, that stuff is for making Scotch
Whiskey.  Many homebrewers use it, but next time maybe try getting rid
of it and using a good scotch ale yeast instead.  See if that gives you
the subtle character you're after.

Last time I made a Scotch ale I added a little peated malt (1/4lb I
think) and used white labs edinburgh yeast.  It had no smoke flavor.
This time I used 1 lb and used the Wyeast Scotch ale yeast which I've
been told will add more smohe phenolic than the White Labs.  I guess
the combination of both the Smoked grain and the yeast was too much.

Yeah, I've read similar comments about the WL vs WYeast yeasts before too.
If it were me, I'd try going back to 1/4 lbs (or none) on the peated malt
and see what effect the WYeast will give you.

Laphroaig mellows with age. Takes a few years, mind.

A pound for 5 gallons?  Uhhhh, tell us if it mellowed in 10 years or
so.  You way over did the addition.   Most would advice against any
peated malt addition but if you are going to add some, think ounces,
not pounds.

My strong scotch ale uses five ounces of peat smoked malt and my
starting gravity is 1.120.  The smoke doesn't really mellow out as
much as the rest of the flavors.  I would recommend that you make
another batch without any smoked malt and blend the two together.
