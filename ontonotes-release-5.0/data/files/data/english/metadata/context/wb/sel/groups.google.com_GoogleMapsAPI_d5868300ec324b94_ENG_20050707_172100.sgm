Scaling icons client-side in IE (DXImageTransform??)

If you give a Google Map icon a GSize that is different from the
icon's natural size, in Mozilla the icon is scaled to the
dimentions you specify.

In IE, however, the icon retains its natural size. This is
because they are not img objects (!), but rather div objects with
their style set to:

progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src=&quot;URL&quot;)

This is apparently to work around IE's poor support of alpha-blended
PNG files.
I can scale the marker manually like this:

marker.iconImage.style.zoom = 0.5;

...but I would like to do this generically to get the same
behavior as in Mozilla. However, I don't know how to determine
the image's natural size in order to compute the correct zoom
factor. Does anyone with deeper knowledge of IE's
non-standardness have any clues to give me?
