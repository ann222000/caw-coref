For those who can not attend NAB 2007 in Las Vegas, EFPlighting.com
will have a complete illustrated report as it relates to lighting and
related products for ENG/EFP productions. We will post highlights
daily and a more complete trade show on the web right after NAB. If
there's anything about lighting that you are particularly interested
let us know at i ... @efplighting.com

On EFPlighting.com we have a preview on new lighting product announced
by manufacturers for NAB.

Thanks
