Anyone familiar with or using Dream Dinners?

One just opened up locally and I went today and put three meals together for
the coming week.

Is it a place where you can cook nice meals for a week or two, in
their kitchen and with all their equipment, and they do all the
shopping and clean up for you?   I think we have something similar
called Let's Dish.  Great concept.

You forgot (a) that it's also their menus and recipes and that (b) in
some cases they have done some of the prep work.

There are a number of places doing this -- it's sort of a DIY Boston
Market type thing with a bit more upscale/gourmet of an approach.  Or
maybe more like the freshly-prepared cook-it-yourself things they sell
at Costco.

I would be more comfortable trying it if they listed ingredients on
their web site (where you reserve your preparation time) so I would know
that there were no ingredients that we couldn't have, and if the prices
weren't *quite* so high.  When I looked at them, it looked like cost and
quantity per serving is similar to, say, Marie Callender or other
upscale TV dinners ($4-5 per "polite" serving), which means each of my
boys would need two servings and for that price, we'd be better off
going to Sweet Tomatoes, a soup and salad place also with fresh food and
that lists all their ingredients upon request, or even to go to the
Chinese or Mexican place in the neighborhood and get takeout with a
better value.

But if you have no foods you avoid and can afford it and have nobody
with a high caloric requirement to make it it cost even more, or maybe
for somebody like my sister who doesn't cook at all, it could be worth it.

Well, there has to be the potential for *plenty* of volume to make it a
profitable business venture.  The places here have room for probably
25-50 people a day preparing meals (times $100 apiece makes beaucoup
bucks).  The population here is so dense that there are, for example, at
least 250,000 people within a 5-mile radius of my home, compared to what
I am sure is a *much* lower number where you are.

There is a company in the next town over that has Dinners by Design or some
such name.  You can prepare it yourself or let them prepare it for you to
cook.  My sister orders hers on the first of the month.  They list all the
ingredients of each dish and the calorie count.  If there is an ingredient
you don't want in what you are ordering, you request it be left out.

She gets "half orders" which are 3 servings and she said they are very
generous servings.  The lasagna she was able to make for four servings.  She
said they also have a freezer with prepared meals that you can choose from
when you go to pick up the food.

Although she told me what it costs, I've forgotten.  She gets enough to fill
her refrigerator freezer each month, is happy with the quality, the variety,
and the price.  Bear in mind, however, she only has herself to feed.  She
likes the ability to have a variety of foods without buying ingredients that
would go to waste and not be used for other meals.

We have several "Dinner's Ready" franchises in our area.  A few of my
friends use it intermittently.  I have been contemplating trying it
out.  It is probably a cheaper alternative to those evenings when I
don't have time to make a decent dinner and pick up Chinese or a
pizza.

Let us know what you think after you have enjoyed a dinner or two.

At the Dream Dinner place locally, they do not prepare the meals for you.
They prep the ingredients and you place the prepped ingredients in ziplock
bags and then freeze them at home.

I do all of our cooking and grocery shopping and I would say that the
ingredients are of pretty good quality.  The portion size is "polite" as
Melinda mentioned.  I put together three six-serving meals, but I think the
six-serving meal would be just about right for the three of us.  Who eats
one pork chop?  lol

I just tried out their introductory offer because I was curious about the
whole concept.  We've been eating out more recently, and that tends to be
not very healthy for us, as well as more costly.

I would have to order a month's worth of meals to see how it impacts our
budget, but I suspect that we wouldn't be spending more.  Not sure how much
less either.

Will do.

I'm going to make the pork chops with apples, raisins, brown sugar, and
ginger tonight.

I make a similar dish sometimes, but I sometimes substitute apricots for the
apples.

I've been doing that for a couple of years now.  I go on a huge shopping
spree a couple of times a year and just throw everything, or most things,
together, label and then toss into the freezer.  You just have to keep track
of what you have in their and whatever additional  ingredients you need to
add just before cooking.  Makes my life a lot easier and now that I'm no
longer doing MT, it's made my husband's life a whole lot easier as well.
He's not taking to the house-husband position all that well &lt;sigh&gt;.  I know
he misses working and he just does not equate housework/childcare at the
same level.  Not that there is a lot to do, but he's having a hard time
wrapping his head around the idea he will never work in construction again.

I thought about doing that too, once I saw what the Dream Dinners concept
was all about.  Once you have the recipes and basic ingredients worked out,
all that Dream Dinners saves you is any prep time, such as peeling and
slicing the apples for my pork chops with apples dinner tonight, which was
pretty good by the way.

I may try doing it the same way you are and see how it goes.

For a lot of men, their identity seems to be defined primarily by the work
they do.  When they retire they feel sort of lost.  Some adjust better than
others.  Not being productive in a financial sense is also pretty difficult
for a lot of us to adjust to.  Maybe you could give him a check every couple
weeks for the housework/childcare:).

I love my work, but it has never defined who I am.  I have so many other
passions, hobbies, and interests that I wouldn't have enough time for all of
them even if I was retired.

Good thing I like what I do, however, because I still have at least 15 years
left of doing it, God and ed willing.

Not just men suffer from this.  I was single for 34 years before I got
married and it took me almost 3 years of being married to come to grips
with the "our money" concept.

I still haven't reconciled myself to the fact that unpaid work (read:
laundry, cooking, housework) is still work and valuable, and I don't
really think I ever will.  I can convince myself that grocery shopping
and possibly even cooking *is* paid work because if you're clever, you
can do it for next to nothing, but alas, I am not that clever.

Depending on how many you want to do in advance, it is pretty easy.  The
last time I did it, it took a whole weekend to do though.  But, I had enough
in my freezer that I really did not have to worry about dinners for about 3

Yeah, he was kind of forced to retire since his accident at work and it's
been hard.  He's only 46 and 4 years away from his official retirement.  Too
bad though that he was injured badly enough that he will probably never get
to enjoy his retirement.  He loved what he did and he was damn good at it.
He did concrete work for 30 years and now he cannot pick his socks up off
the floor without wondering if he'll get upright again.  He cannot do the
things he enjoyed - bowling, hiking, bike riding, home renovations or even
swimming.  So he sits home all day in the house he was suppose to rehab,
watching television, playing on the computer or on a good day he will take
the dog for a while aroiund the park.   He cannot even sit through dinner
any longer so nights out are even shot.

Whats worse is that I'm making all these changes in my life - school, work,
etc. and I know that bothers him greatly.

Financially we are actually better off in a strange way with his disability
checks so that's not a big deal, its just the lifestyle change that has been
the hardest.

But I think to make mattes worse is how jaded I've become to a lot of
things.  It's been four years since his accident and I know he's been
through a lot, but to see him stagnate like he is is very hard.  I know he
cannot do heavy labor, rehabbing, etc., but can he pick up after himself?
Can he remember to ask his daughter what time she needs to be picked up?
Check the mailbox?  Run a vacuum?  I know it sounds petty, but I;ll come
home to him on pain pills and unable to move because he did something stupid
like decide to tear a wall down in the basement  in preparation for a new
bathroom which is something we cannot even begin to afford to do, let alone
him be able to do it - all because that is what he wants to do.  I keep
telling him he needs to wrap his head around the fact that this is just the
way things are - he needs to alter his reality a little bit and just do the
things he is honestly capapable of doing and that needs to be done within
his restrictions and just learn to accept it.

Geez, I know that sounds really harsh, but he wont go talk to anyone and in
the meantime he is driving me and his daughters absolutely nuts.

Thanks Kathy.  Unfortunately no.  He's had surgery already and it helped
initially.  What burns me most is that he was under special restrictions
which basically prevented him from working as a finisher ever again, but at
least he was 80% pain free and was able to do things again.  His employer
found a job for him which would accommodate his restrictions and he was
actually happy because he was "working".   Unfortunately the job they found
him was once someone's relative in this godforsaken politically corrupt city
and they were none to happy to be back on the streets having to actually
earn their pay.  So someone in thier infinite wisdom put together a special
crew to "accommodate his restrictions" which is unheard of.  In the trades,
you either do the entire job, or you do not work, but someone pulled some
strings and since it was "within his restrictions" he had no choice but to
go back out on the streets and pour concrete again.  He managed a day and a
half and then I get the call that he is back in the ER.  I wanted to rip
heads off when I got that call.  He redamaged his back and it caused even
more damage.  Had he been left alone in his truck doing estimates and
paperwork, he would probably be just fine.  Instead  he is worse off now
than he was before the surgery.  The only option now is a four to five level
fusion, but that wont do anything for the pain and nerve damage.  It's just
how things are now.

I really disliked this city before the accident, but now I loathe this place
and what they have done to him and my family.  All we can do now is hold out
for four more years and hope they do not screw with us even more and put his
pension in jeopardy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought about doing that too, once I saw what the Dream Dinners
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concept was all about.  Once you have the recipes and basic ingredients
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worked out,  all that Dream Dinners saves you is any prep time, such as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peeling and  slicing the apples for my pork chops with apples dinner
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tonight, which was  pretty good by the way.

&gt;&gt; Depending on how many you want to do in advance, it is pretty easy.  The
&gt;&gt; last time I did it, it took a whole weekend to do though.  But, I had
&gt;&gt; enough in my freezer that I really did not have to worry about dinners
&gt;&gt; for about 3 months so while it was a busy weekend, it sure helped big
&gt;&gt; time.

&gt;&gt; &gt; For a lot of men, their identity seems to be defined primarily by the
&gt;&gt; work they do.  When they retire they feel sort of lost.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, he was kind of forced to retire since his accident at work and it's
&gt;&gt; been hard.  He's only 46 and 4 years away from his official retirement.
&gt;&gt; Too bad though that he was injured badly enough that he will probably
&gt;&gt; never get to enjoy his retirement.  He loved what he did and he was damn
&gt;&gt; good at it. He did concrete work for 30 years and now he cannot pick his
&gt;&gt; socks up off the floor without wondering if he'll get upright again.  He
&gt;&gt; cannot do the things he enjoyed - bowling, hiking, bike riding, home
&gt;&gt; renovations or even swimming.  So he sits home all day in the house he
&gt;&gt; was suppose to rehab, watching television, playing on the computer or on
&gt;&gt; a good day he will take the dog for a while aroiund the park.   He cannot
&gt;&gt; even sit through dinner any longer so nights out are even shot.

&gt;&gt; Whats worse is that I'm making all these changes in my life - school,
&gt;&gt; work, etc. and I know that bothers him greatly.

&gt;&gt; Financially we are actually better off in a strange way with his
&gt;&gt; disability checks so that's not a big deal, its just the lifestyle change
&gt;&gt; that has been the hardest.

&gt;&gt; But I think to make mattes worse is how jaded I've become to a lot of
&gt;&gt; things.  It's been four years since his accident and I know he's been
&gt;&gt; through a lot, but to see him stagnate like he is is very hard.  I know
&gt;&gt; he cannot do heavy labor, rehabbing, etc., but can he pick up after
&gt;&gt; himself? Can he remember to ask his daughter what time she needs to be
&gt;&gt; picked up? Check the mailbox?  Run a vacuum?  I know it sounds petty, but
&gt;&gt; I;ll come home to him on pain pills and unable to move because he did
&gt;&gt; something stupid like decide to tear a wall down in the basement  in
&gt;&gt; preparation for a new bathroom which is something we cannot even begin to
&gt;&gt; afford to do, let alone him be able to do it - all because that is what
&gt;&gt; he wants to do. I keep telling him he needs to wrap his head around the
&gt;&gt; fact that this is just the way things are - he needs to alter his reality
&gt;&gt; a little bit and just do the things he is honestly capapable of doing and
&gt;&gt; that needs to be done within his restrictions and just learn to accept
&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt; Geez, I know that sounds really harsh, but he wont go talk to anyone and
&gt;&gt; in the meantime he is driving me and his daughters absolutely nuts.

I'm sure sometimes that's the case, Phyllis. If someone is eating for
one, either the single serving packages are more expensive, or you have
too much left over and it goes bad before you can eat it. Some thing you
could divide up and freeze, but that's not always possible.

Maureen, when I read your post, it made me ache for you and especially for
your husband.  Naturally, I do not know how he expresses his feelings now,
but I know many men who have suffered disabilities don't do that very well.

It is so very hard to accept that you cannot do the things you used to do
with ease and "to accept it."  My wife bitches constantly about the
condition of my "office" and why don't I pick it up?  The "office" is an 8 x
12 bedroom which was my MT office - now my selling on eBay office and my new
business venture office.  I have suggested that she just not come back here
and not worry about it, but she will not listen to that. A few days ago, she
"cleaned, dusted, and vacuumed" my office.  For some strange reason, she
moved absolutely everything in here and put it in a different location.  Why
she can't or won't put things back where they were I don't understand.  Now
I can't find anything.  My pile of bills is now in three piles.  Part of the
"stuff" on my desk is now down on top of the printer.  Transcribers are in a
chair, and now I can't tell which work and which don't.  While she was
vacuuming, I guess, she managed to unplug the fax machine, the printer, one
phone line, and one lamp.  (They all were plugged into different outlets -
strange!)

Now, why don't I clean it up myself?  The mess doesn't bother me.  I know, I
knew where everything was.  I spent about an hour looking for the charger
for my cordless screwdriver.  When I asked where she had put it, she reached
into the closet, into a box on the floor, under something else, and said "is
this it?"  I couldn't find the remote for the TV.  She reached up into a
cubbyhole in the, the.... (whatever that tall thing that sits on the back of
the desk is called) and pulled the remote out from under some transcriber
mics.  That "thing" has five different cubbyholes, and she has re-arranged
all of them.  Now my two bottles of plastic cleaner and polish that I use to
shine up the transcribers that I use almost every day are sitting behind two
smoke detectors and a purple rubber glove.  Hmmmm....... that's must be a
hint that she wants me to fix the smoke detectors and put them back up.

Darn, I got way off the subject, didn't I?  Getting back to a disabled man
not being able to do the things he used to do and still wants to do.

My oldest son and I started a new business venture about two months ago of
buying, fixing up, then selling and financing used mobile homes.  The idea
was to buy them cheap, fix them up, and sell them at a nice profit and
provide financing for them.  (Used single wide mobile homes are almost
impossible to finance.)  Kevin's idea was since I was retired, I had the
time to do the "legwork" involved, get the necessary licensing, permits,
etc., find the mobile home to buy, do the negotiating, and he and my younger
son would do the "fixing."  Well, the younger son is not the most dependable
person alive, has not shown up at all to help us, and we hired a handyman to
help.

I bought the first trailer from a dealer.  They screwed me really good.  Now
we have over $10,000 in it with no end in sight, and the dealer hasn't even
gotten us the title.  I gave the dealer a deadline of next Thursday to have
the title in my hands or Friday morning I will present the a bill that is
due and payable then for all the money and time we have put into this thing,
in addition to the purchase price.

Anyhow, I have been trying to help with the repairs and find that physically
because of my COPD and emphysema that I cannot do what I would like to.  For
example, I was being the "go-fer" last weekend, getting supplies and paint.
We needed a lot of paint, and a 5-gallon bucket of paint was quite a bit
cheaper that 5 1-gallon buckets.  Because of my re-torn rotator cuff, I
could not lift the buck of paint off the shelf in Home Depot and put it in
that shopping cart.  Thankfully, a nice customer did it for me.  Then when I
got out to the SUV, I couldn't lift it again to put it in the back.  While I
was waiting for a Home Depot loader to help, another nice customer again
offered to help and I gratefully accepted.  I (and I believe anyone in the
same situation) find this humiliating, but there is not a hell of a lot I
can do about it.

After 3 years of being on oxygen for the emphysema, 2 torn rotator cuffs and
1 re-torn, and a total knee replacement a little over a year ago, I have
become very deconditioned.  I know I should get out and walk, go to the gym,
but the longer it goes on, the more difficult it is to do even the little
things.  Another "minor" thing - bending over to tie my shoes in the morning
makes me so short of breath I see stars and almost pass out.  I went to
slip-on shoes, but that does not address the real problem, does it?

If you and others have read stuff  I have written here about my limitations,
you know I have tried to make somewhat of a joke about them, but somethings
the joking doesn't work that well.  I really carry the oxygen over my
shoulder at all times for other reasons than just getting the best parking
spaces.  The souped-up wheelchair and things like that are certainly not
real, just my attempts at some levity about the situation.

The one and last thing I want to say to you is to try to be less critical of
your husband.  I fully understand that it is frustrating to you and the rest
of the family, but it is doubly so for him.  Try to compliment him for the
things he does do, even if they are very tiny.

Here's my last example:  Today I worked on the trailer for a few hours with
Jesus, our handyman.  (Kevin is out of town for a week).  Then I came home,
started supper in the crockpot, emptied the 3 bags of trash in the kitchen,
cleaned up the counters, and something else.  (Damn, that really isn't very
much, is it?)  But anyway, when Martha got home from work, the first thing
she commented about was that I hadn't scooped out the cats' litterbox.  (She
did compliment me on the supper, though.)

Thinking of you.  Hang in there!

Neal

Geez, Neal, I think you did more than I did this weekend LOL!! And that is
just amazing.

I know I need to be more patient with him but it is so hard.  We still have
two teenage girls at home and they need their dad.  Part of my decision to
leave MT before finishing school was to get out of the house and forcing him
to have to do some things.  I thought maybe if I wasnt here to fall back on,
he would do it.  So far, not so good.

I really need for him to go talk to someone, but I guess real men do not do
that - at least in his head.

I know last summer when I did the landscaping in the front of the house it
just about killed him to watch me do it and him having to just sit and
watch, er supervise, but he cannot do it and I really do not mind.  I
understand he cannot do it.  I give a crap what the neighbors thing - never
did befoer and certainly care less now, but it nags at him.

I would not even mind his mess if it was kept in one room, but it trails all
over the house.  He has a back and hip injury, not a brain injury.  I do not
want to hear  I forgot any more.  If the girls gave him that excuse he'd be
all over them, yet that is what I'm gonna put on his headstone.  I do not
think he even knows where the litter box is.

Your office sounds like my father-in-law's office LOL!! the Organized Mess.
I do not know how he did it, but he could find a needle in a haystack.  I
have to say when he passed away and we had to clean out the office, it was
like a treasure hunt :)  I miss him so much.  I think if he was still
around, Ray would be dealing with things much more differently.  That man
had two open heart surgeries, three ulcer surgeries, a replaced knee and
lung cancer and he still dragged his butt out of the house to do things.  He
certainly wasnt pain free, but doing something gave him a purpose.  Right
now Ray's in the self-pity phase, which I can certainly understand, but he's
been there for about two years now and I jsut cannot imagine 30 more years
of it.

I feel like such a bitch :(

Neal, my husband's disabilities began 17 years ago and more are added every
few years it seems.  I wish he would do more, but he doesn't and I'm not
going to nag him about it.  Whatever time we have left together, it isn't
going to be spent worrying about whether a room is clean and tidy.  It is
going to be spent enjoying each other's company.

He has his computer, printer, etc on an adjustable table that takes up one
whole short wall in the dining room.  If I dust I use a Swiffer so I don't
have to move anything.  It is his space, his "stuff", and I try to "do unto
others" as I would have others do unto me.  I wouldn't like it if someone
moved my stuff, so I don't move his.  I wouldn't like it if someone nagged
me, so I don't nag him.  Do I get frustrated?  Yes; and sometimes even
overwhelmed, but he is my husband, not my child, and I don't tell him what
to do.  When he let me know he liked his computer things the way he had
them, I decided that was the way they would stay.

If you re-arranged everything in the kitchen cupboards or her dresser or the
medicine chest in the bathroom, I imagine she'd be less than pleased to find
the canned peaches in her lingerie drawer or the cough syrup in the freezer.

My husband has had to give up almost everything.  He can't work and earn a
living, he can't walk through a store or garden center, he can't walk up or
down stairs to help with the laundry or put things away, he can't shovel the
snow in winter or mow the grass in summer, he can't fix our computers when
the need arises, he can't even eat the things he used to truly enjoy
(end-stage renal disease, sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, stroke, and
now tests for his heart rate which drops to 37 whenever it feels like it).

The last time he tried to do something he shouldn't have he broke and split
his left femur.  He was not allowed to bear weight for six months and was in
a wheelchair for another six months.  I can remember shoveling  in a snow
storm at 4 a.m. to get the walk and driveway cleared by 6 so the ambulette
could take him to the hospital for surgery.  Now I don't care if he never
tries anything ever again because that was a horrible year for both of us.

Most women would prefer their homes to be clean and tidy, and believe others
who enter our homes blame us for any disarray.  One of the wisdoms I've
learned over the years is that if my husband is contented, I really don't
care what others think.  If they don't like the way the house looks, then
they should stay out.

I hope you can convince your wife that life for someone who can no longer do
the things he wants to do, needs to do for his own sake, is tough enough
without someone not even allowing him the control of the one room in the
house that is his.

Sorry, I'm off my soap box now.  It just hit a nerve.

You are not a bitch, Maureen, this is certainly understandable.  He is
depressed and if he doesn't get over it and get off his butt, it will get
worse, I know I have it too.  I have gone through this with my back.
Truthfully, if he does not pick up after himself and do little things that
he really can do, it will deteriorate into a mess and he will get even more
depressed.  I'd stay on top of it from that aspect.

&gt; that - at least in his head.

&gt; I know last summer when I did the landscaping in the front of the house it
&gt; just about killed him to watch me do it and him having to just sit and
&gt; watch, er supervise, but he cannot do it and I really do not mind.  I
&gt; understand he cannot do it.  I give a crap what the neighbors thing -
never
&gt; did befoer and certainly care less now, but it nags at him.

&gt; I would not even mind his mess if it was kept in one room, but it trails
all
&gt; over the house.  He has a back and hip injury, not a brain injury.  I do
not
&gt; want to hear  I forgot any more.  If the girls gave him that excuse he'd
be
&gt; all over them, yet that is what I'm gonna put on his headstone.  I do not
&gt; think he even knows where the litter box is.

&gt; Your office sounds like my father-in-law's office LOL!! the Organized
Mess.
&gt; I do not know how he did it, but he could find a needle in a haystack.  I
&gt; have to say when he passed away and we had to clean out the office, it was
&gt; like a treasure hunt :)  I miss him so much.  I think if he was still
&gt; around, Ray would be dealing with things much more differently.  That man
&gt; had two open heart surgeries, three ulcer surgeries, a replaced knee and
&gt; lung cancer and he still dragged his butt out of the house to do things.
He
&gt; certainly wasnt pain free, but doing something gave him a purpose.  Right
&gt; now Ray's in the self-pity phase, which I can certainly understand, but
he's
&gt; been there for about two years now and I jsut cannot imagine 30 more years
&gt; of it.

&gt; I feel like such a bitch :(

Maureen,

I gotta agree with Susan.  You are not a bitch, so don't feel like one.
This disability crap is hard on everyone.  Oh yeah, I forgot about my sleep
apnea and hernias.

I wish I had some "words of wisdom" for you, but don't.  But... if your
husband is depressed, as he probably should be, talk to his doctor.  Maybe
the doc can talk to him on an office visit.  My doctor basically saved my
life several years ago.  I was thinking seriously about a bullet cure for my
feelings and he found out.  He called me up, told me to come see him on his
day off or he would have me arrested and committed.  I went to talk to him,
broke down and cried, and he put me on Paxil.  It has been very good for me.

I do think it is good that you (and me, and Phyllis) can share these things.
To know others are coping with the same things somehow gives us more hope.
I know misery loves company, but I don't think that is it.

Martha and I had one of the worst fights a couple of days ago we've had in
45 years of marriage.

I thought we had an agreement that I would buy another mobile home, was in
some peoples' home finalizing a deal, when she called me on my cell phone.
When I told her the deal was about to be finished, she threw a wall-eyed
fit, said I had promised not to buy another trailer until the one we were
working on was sold, etc, etc, etc.  I ended up having to back out of the
deal, and it was very embarassing.

That night I tried to "explain" that I thought we had an understanding that
I was going to buy more trailers.  After all, I had told her about making
offers on four of them.  She said she thought I was just BS'ing about the
offers.  She held me to the earlier deal about not buying any more.

I explained (or so I thought) the several different times we had talked
about it, but she would tell me "that what she actually said wasn't what she
meant."  At least it was a learning experience for me to know that talking
about things was a waste of time unless I could read her mind and know "what
she really meant," not what she said.

I guess the main thing that depresses me is that although she has been in
one trailer and Kevin has been in two, he thinks he can buy them much
cheaper than my offers and she thinks I don't have good "judgement" on
buying them.  I don't know all that much about them, but I've looked at 14
mobile homes and negotiated with the owners to buy them, but I guess that
doesn't count.

Sometimes life is a bitch.

Also, thanks Phyllis for sharing your situation with your husband.  I
empathize with that, too.

Maureen,

I'm glad that at least you took the opportunity to express your situation
and how you feel about it.  Sometimes that in itself is a very good thing to
do.

I've read the entire thread carefully.  From your initial post and your
responses to the other posts I think you have no reason to feel like a bitch
about how you feel.

Your husband obviously is depressed and refuses to seek the help he needs to
get better.  I can very much appreciate what Neal describes about his
situation, but I don't think that your expectations are unrealistic.  I
think you have a very good grasp of what your husband is physically capable
of doing and not capable of doing.

On top of his physical problems, he is suffering from mental illness.  It
must be extremely frustrating to know that he would probably get better if
he would just get some help for it.  I would like to be able to help find
some kind of a solution, but as you know, it's not real easy to get someone
to seek help if they don't want to and are in denial that they have a
problem.

I will keep you and your family in my prayers Maureen.

I don't think you have any reason to feel bad about your feelings, and
again, I'm glad that you shared them with us.

One other thing.....................

In addition to what I said I would encourage you to seek some counseling for
yourself if you aren't already.

The last thing you and your daughters need is for you to get into a
depression over the situation also, and sometimes that can also help the
person in denial to get a more realistic perspective.

A counselor may also have some good suggestions in regards to how to best
approach and encourage him to seek help.

You're right; it isn't a matter of misery loving company, just a matter of
sharing frustrations and maybe some solutions.  Life is hard.  It is even
harder when our bodies won't respond the way we want them to; the way they
did work for so many years.  On several occasions, when my husband was going
through particularly bad times, I've told him that nothing I have ever had
to do for him has ever been a burden.  Even though I wish circumstances
hadn't made then necessary, and caused fatigue more times than not, they
were never a burden.

I've often said if women could learn to think like men there would be fewer
arguments and much more peace and harmony (though I may be deemed a traitor
to my gender for saying so).   I read once that wives must feel loved and
husbands must feel respected to have a happy marriage.  A wife is indeed
wrong if she ever embarasses her husband.

Since I doubt we women will ever be able to know how to think like men, I
found a way to determine exactly what my husband thinks about any particular
decision (which we never make unilaterally):

1.    I would like to . . .
2.    I plan to accomplish it by . . .
3.    It will cost . . .
4.    Do you have any advice on how to better accomplish it?
5.    Do you agree we should do this?
6.    So you're telling me we should . . .
7.    Are you sure you want to . . .
8.    Are you sure you want to . . .

Because these conversations take place seated face to face with no
distractions and take a period of time (sometimes a very short period) and
working through a thought process to complete, the conversation is less
likely to be forgotten by either of us.

In a business where there are partners it is best if each partner has
his/her own role, their own job; one that doesn't overlap with the other
partners: finance, requisition, negotiation, hiring/firing, rehab, how to
share the costs and profits with a lot of business meetings leaving nothing
to speculation.   I sincerely hope your business continues to grow and will
bear financial fruit and emotional satisfaction.

We haven't been married as long as you and Martha (and you two must be doing
something right to have stayed together for so long), but hope to achieve
that some day.

I gotta put my 2c in here, and drag something else Maureen said about
her DH saying, "I forgot."

Say my DH and I have an agreement that we've hammered out.  I make
myself think about exactly what it is I want and SAY SO so that nobody
can go back later and said, "But I thought you meant..."  NO.  I SAID
what I meant and I MEANT what I said.  I am consistent in that.

So now my DH just says, "Well, I forgot."  Shit, if you're gonna do it
anyway, just go ahead and tell me to take a flying leap from the git-go
instead of handing it over to "I forgot."

We have many an animated discussion over "I forgot."

Thanks Ed and everyone else who responded.  It does feel good to get it out.

We had a talk tonight after work and I told him he needs to go see his doc
to try to get new meds and he needs to go talk to someone, even if it is
just a friend, cause he needs to get out and do something.   I have gone for
help also which was wonderful and I think that is what saved my sanity these
last couple of years.  Now it is up to him.  I think he will.  He's too
young to continue like this.

We've been married 24 years this year and I'd like to stay  married for
another 24.

who enter our homes blame us for any disarray. One of the wisdoms I've

to go home.  Thankfully it just a sciatic type pain and I should be good in
