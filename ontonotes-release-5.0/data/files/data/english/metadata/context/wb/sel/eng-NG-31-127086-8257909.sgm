I'm thinking of buying the Rhapsody bed by Temperpedic.  Before spending
$2599.00 on a new bed though (uggggggh) I bought the memory foam mattress
topper today at Costco.  For my Queen sized bed it was $139.99.  It has
2-1/2 inches of memory foam and 1-1/2 inches of micro-fiber, kind of like a
pillow top.  You can sleep on it either way, the foam on top or the
micro-fiber on top.  Thought I'd let the group know how it works out.  I'm
really hoping I can stay in bed longer than an hour or two.

The reason I'm interested in the Rhapsody, is Oprah had a doctor on her show
one day and he said the Rhapsody is the best bed for a good nights sleep.
I'm thinking if this topper works out I'll stick with it and not spend the
money on the bed.

Anyway, I'll let you guys know how this works out for my messed up back.  At
this price, it's definitely worth trying.

I live in NH and there is a company that sells Temperpedic Knock-offs

Temperpedic at home and bought a knock-off for his summer place. he
says there is not any difference between the two at all.

Try overstock.com they got genuine temperdemic toppers, mattresses &amp;
sets @ about 50% off. My set (a frame, box spring &amp; top mattress (not
just a topper, 25 year warranty) was $1400 delivered and even set by the
moving compamy. Hilarious to watch it expand when they first open it.

This is my reply to what bbwwes had to say.

It was strange just watching the topper expand.  It came folded, compressed
and vacuum packed.

The verdict is in....Just using the topper I slept better than I have in
years.  I was actually able to stay in bed for the entire night.  I still
woke up several times through the night, but was able to get back to sleep
without having to get out of bed because the pain of laying down was so
great.

I had a memory foam topper for a month. It made me really hot! Way too

As I recall we tried it both ways to try to make it cooler. Neither
way was cool enough. Even my warm loving wife thought it too hot. It
was part of an air bed package we returned because of the heat issue.
We went back to a water bed.

Dear Sue,

Stick with the guys that offer the in home 30/60/90 day trial so you really
get a road test and NEVER buy it from one of their &quot;stores&quot;. QVC saved us
$1500 on a Select Comfort (this was before the air gauges that gave you your
&quot;sleep number&quot;) but the wife likes her side disgustingly mushy and I get
better results out of a medium rock hard setting.
Her folks went full boat on the Craftmatic that bends like a hospital bed,
so they can watch TV and all that other stuff but they got took moneywise
but nothing they couldn't handle and they were in a hurry, I guess.
But you absolutely have to shop around, QVC and HSN are really good places
to pick up a deal, but the savings is going to be big, BIG, bucks, all with
the same warranty, test drive period, and the whole deal. They really push
the options in the stores, the sheets (which are nice 300 thread count, but
you can catch them on sale for like half the price) the mattress pads, the
pillows (a rip in my opinion. You can mix and match technologies if you
want) and that cash register just starts a singing. You can get all the add
ons at QVC and HSN also. Please shop around. You can get a bed and a
half-assed used car for what you'll pay retail.
Give a shout when you're ready for that used car shopping too. That will be
a bit tougher than QVC and the bed, but we'll do what we can.

Sweetest of Dreams--og

chris and i have one of the toppers.  It has changed our sleep in wonderful
ways.

I was beginning to get minor back pain when i slept...that is completely
gone.  I also sleep the whole night thru, unless the bladder interrupts.
chris is almost 6'4&quot; and has had different minor pains in his knees and
such.  He also can sleep thru the night, until the mini doxie comes licking
him in the face for morning kibbles.

But the biggest difference is in Max.  We have a shepherd mix who has
arthritis and hip problems.  He always slept on the couch or the guest bed.
Once he tried the Temp topper, he's slept on our bed almost every night.  I
think that is the strongest statement.  My crippled doggie-boy loves the
topper (and the occasional buffered aspirin.)

I would strongly suggest the topper.   My parents have the full Temper-pedic
mattress bed and sleep very well.  Both of them have medical issues.  Ma has
had spinal cancer and Fibro and Multiple Myeloma.  Gene is 6'5&quot; had both
knees replaced and general mid-70's complaints.  They would not have kept
the mattress if they didn't like it...they have the means.  They tried the
topper first, which is why we have it now.

Slide one into the &quot;for&quot; slot...

deep peace, and restful doggies,
Lavon

I don't really know what you need to know before you buy. Here is one page
of my current Consumer's Report subscription. I hope it clears up more than
it confuses. But if you have more questions, I'll try to get the answers you
need from CR.

This is my reply to what Hawk ... @sbcglobal.net had to say.

The topper I got from Costco has a micro-fiber pillow top mattress pad that
goes with it.  The foam actually slides inside the mattress cover, under the
micro-fiber mattress pad.  I don't feel any warmth from it at all and I
sleep really warm.  It may depend on which type of topper a person gets.
The one from Costco is called &quot;Choices&quot;.  You can sleep with the foam on top
or the thick quilted mattress pad on top.  I've tried it both ways and
prefer the quilted mattress pad on top.  It's like sleeping on a puffy
cloud.

&gt; I was wondering the same thing...bought a pillow topper once and it
&gt; was sleeping on a bunch of feathers...and didn't help much...

&gt; I assume these toppers to UNDER the mattress pad??

This is my reply to what Mike Berkowitz had to say.

That's too bad Mike.  This has worked out really great for me.  It no doubt
depends greatly on which type of topper you get.  This one from Costco has a
very thick quilted mattress pad that goes with it, filled with some type of
micro-fiber and the foam slides inside the mattress pad.  You can sleep
either way, with the foam on top or the mattress pad on top.  I've tried
both ways and prefer the mattress pad on top.  I feel like I'm sleeping on
top of the clouds.  I sleep very warm and don't have a problem with this
one.

This is my reply to what OldGoat had to say.

I've thought about buying it from QVC or HSN.  I think I may just get it
from Costco.  They are even less expensive there.  Will check out the return
policy first though!  They generally have free shipping on these big ticket
items too.  How do you like the sleep number bed?  I was actually set on
getting one of those until I heard that doctor say the Rhapsody is the best
bed for a good nights sleep.

Thanks for the sweet dreams......:-)

&gt; Dear Sue,

&gt; Stick with the guys that offer the in home 30/60/90 day trial so you
&gt; really get a road test and NEVER buy it from one of their &quot;stores&quot;.
&gt; QVC saved us $1500 on a Select Comfort (this was before the air
&gt; gauges that gave you your &quot;sleep number&quot;) but the wife likes her side
&gt; disgustingly mushy and I get better results out of a medium rock hard
&gt; setting. Her folks went full boat on the Craftmatic that bends like a
&gt; hospital
&gt; bed, so they can watch TV and all that other stuff but they got took
&gt; moneywise but nothing they couldn't handle and they were in a hurry,
&gt; I guess. But you absolutely have to shop around, QVC and HSN are really
&gt; good
&gt; places to pick up a deal, but the savings is going to be big, BIG,
&gt; bucks, all with the same warranty, test drive period, and the whole
&gt; deal. They really push the options in the stores, the sheets (which
&gt; are nice 300 thread count, but you can catch them on sale for like
&gt; half the price) the mattress pads, the pillows (a rip in my opinion.
&gt; You can mix and match technologies if you want) and that cash
&gt; register just starts a singing. You can get all the add ons at QVC
&gt; and HSN also. Please shop around. You can get a bed and a half-assed
&gt; used car for what you'll pay retail. Give a shout when you're ready for
&gt; that used car shopping too. That
&gt; will be a bit tougher than QVC and the bed, but we'll do what we can.

This is my reply to what Gigglz had to say.

Before spending that much money for the bed, I thought spending the money
for the topper to check it out was a wise thing to do.  I'd rather spend a
little money and be disappointed than spend alot of money and be
disappointed. :-)

Give it a try......it's not perfect, but much closer than the firm mattress
I've been sleeping on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I too have been looking into that bed.  I've talked to some chronic
&gt; painers that say they like the bed, but because it forms to your body,
&gt; sometimes turning your body over can be difficult.  It depends on IF
&gt; you need to turn or not.  Given my ridiculous spine, I'm one that has
&gt; to turn periodically all damn night.  I'm thinking I'll just get that
&gt; topper for myself, too...and take it from there :-)

&gt; Lemme know what you decide, sweetie!

I tried a foam matress many years ago, and because of the way you sink in
to it I also felt really hot and itchy, the best matress I ever had came
almost free from a furniture rental place, like a pool table with an inch
of packed down horsehair on it, ultra, super, mega firm!

God I miss that mattress!

My favorite matress pad today is three Vicodins, one Morphene and 800 MG
of Diphenhydramine, plus all the other night time meds.

We bought one of those toppers from Costco. Pain in the A$$ to unfold.

It works pretty well, but it is warmer than the mattress because it
reflects body heat. We've had a mild summer so far, with cool nights, so
it has not been a problem, but I think on a sweltering night it might
well be very hot and sweaty.

This is my reply to what Juba had to say.

It was a pain to unfold, almost needed 2 people.  It's amazing how it plumps
up after being squished and vacuumed packed.  We've had some over 100 degree
days and some very warm nights and I'm still doing ok with it.  I did sleep
on top of the covers 2 nights though.  We're just not used to that kind of
weather up here.  I'm going to get the mattress from Costco.  Can't beat
that price.

interesting points you both make about the temperature reflection -

with still's disease i have high overnight temp and night sweats more
often than not -

when i had to use an eggcrate for a while it wasn't a good match at all
with the foam...

anyone have a similar experience with which to gauge the temperpedic
products?

be well

I have a tempurpedic bed and I LOVE it. I don't have back issues though.
I DO get VERY hot at night but this is totally independent of my bed
composition. The only thing I would say about the tempurpedic is be
careful if your room gets below 65F. It turns into a rock so don't jump
on it. You have to wait for your body heat to make it a bit more soft.

&gt; with still's disease i have high overnight temp and night sweats more
&gt; often than not -

&gt; when i had to use an eggcrate for a while it wasn't a good match at all
&gt; with the foam...

&gt; anyone have a similar experience with which to gauge the temperpedic
&gt; products?

&gt; be well

&gt;&gt;It was a pain to unfold, almost needed 2 people.  It's amazing how it plumps
&gt;&gt;up after being squished and vacuumed packed.  We've had some over 100 degree
&gt;&gt;days and some very warm nights and I'm still doing ok with it.  I did sleep
&gt;&gt;on top of the covers 2 nights though.  We're just not used to that kind of
&gt;&gt;weather up here.  I'm going to get the mattress from Costco.  Can't beat
&gt;&gt;that price.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm thinking of buying the Rhapsody bed by Temperpedic.  Before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;spending $2599.00 on a new bed though (uggggggh) I bought the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;memory foam mattress topper today at Costco.  For my Queen sized
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bed it was $139.99.  It has 2-1/2 inches of memory foam and 1-1/2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inches of micro-fiber, kind of like a pillow top.  You can sleep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on it either way, the foam on top or the micro-fiber on top. Thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd let the group know how it works out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;We bought one of those toppers from Costco. Pain in the A$$ to unfold.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It works pretty well, but it is warmer than the mattress because it
&gt;&gt;&gt;reflects body heat. We've had a mild summer so far, with cool nights,
&gt;&gt;&gt;so it has not been a problem, but I think on a sweltering night it
&gt;&gt;&gt;might well be very hot and sweaty.

Dear Sue,

Sorry for taking a while to get back at you. It's pretty decent. You can go
from laying in a hammock kind of cradled feeling to sleeping on a board in a
matter of about 30 seconds. What I usually do as a starting point is pump it
up until I feel it filling the small of my back, supporting the curve. Then
you can add a little more &quot;bounce&quot; or support as you feel like it, so it's
like having a bunch of mattresses in one.
I read or saw something on TV once about mattresses, you normal box
spring/mattress setup, and they scam you like mad. There's (if I recall
right) 5 different levels of quality of the same mattress that are
available. They rate them like hotels %star being top o the line 1 star
being a real shitbox. Places like &quot;mattress discounters&quot; usually handle 2
and 3 star mattresses at 5 star prices. Avoid them like it was a used
mattress store. The show told you how to tell the difference because they're
all identical, but I forget how. It like a secret, like where they hide the
VIN numbers in cars.
But you shouldn't run in to that with any of the new high tech mattresses. I
hope. If not, we got lucky with the Select Comfort. No problems, even when
the dog with the bear claws  joined us. Only she prefers both settings at
the same time, sleeping across the bed. Perfect fit on a king size bed.

Good hunting (and Costco sounds good too)--og

&gt; This is my reply to what OldGoat had to say.

&gt; I've thought about buying it from QVC or HSN.  I think I may just get it
&gt; from Costco.  They are even less expensive there.  Will check out the
&gt; return policy first though!  They generally have free shipping on these
&gt; big ticket items too.  How do you like the sleep number bed?  I was
&gt; actually set on getting one of those until I heard that doctor say the
&gt; Rhapsody is the best bed for a good nights sleep.

&gt; Thanks for the sweet dreams......:-)

&gt;&gt; Dear Sue,

&gt;&gt; Stick with the guys that offer the in home 30/60/90 day trial so you
&gt;&gt; really get a road test and NEVER buy it from one of their &quot;stores&quot;.
&gt;&gt; QVC saved us $1500 on a Select Comfort (this was before the air
&gt;&gt; gauges that gave you your &quot;sleep number&quot;) but the wife likes her side
&gt;&gt; disgustingly mushy and I get better results out of a medium rock hard
&gt;&gt; setting. Her folks went full boat on the Craftmatic that bends like a
&gt;&gt; hospital
&gt;&gt; bed, so they can watch TV and all that other stuff but they got took
&gt;&gt; moneywise but nothing they couldn't handle and they were in a hurry,
&gt;&gt; I guess. But you absolutely have to shop around, QVC and HSN are really
&gt;&gt; good
&gt;&gt; places to pick up a deal, but the savings is going to be big, BIG,
&gt;&gt; bucks, all with the same warranty, test drive period, and the whole
&gt;&gt; deal. They really push the options in the stores, the sheets (which
&gt;&gt; are nice 300 thread count, but you can catch them on sale for like
&gt;&gt; half the price) the mattress pads, the pillows (a rip in my opinion.
&gt;&gt; You can mix and match technologies if you want) and that cash
&gt;&gt; register just starts a singing. You can get all the add ons at QVC
&gt;&gt; and HSN also. Please shop around. You can get a bed and a half-assed
&gt;&gt; used car for what you'll pay retail. Give a shout when you're ready for
&gt;&gt; that used car shopping too. That
&gt;&gt; will be a bit tougher than QVC and the bed, but we'll do what we can.
