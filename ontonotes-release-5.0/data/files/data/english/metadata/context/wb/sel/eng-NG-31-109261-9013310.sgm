For those of you who don't know, I have returned to Canada.  I am now
in Edmonton, Alberta, quite safe and sound.  My bike trip may have
come to a premature end, but the traveling will not be stopping soon.
Sorry I haven't updated in a long time, but I have been short of time
and computers in the process of getting home.  Here's the story:

My friend told me about a beach party, and as you may have guessed, I
accepted this invitation.  I hitchhiked out to a town called Villa
Rica on the Gulf coast, just north of Veracruz.  I arrived in the late
afternoon as the sun was setting with some other random hitchhikers I
met on the road.  We soon had a cold beer and a swim to kill the heat
of the day, and my other friends arrived shortly after.

On the second night of this several day beach party there was an
incredible storm.  First it was lightning like I have never seen it
before, hundreds of shocks.  Then the wind picked up and the rain
pelted down.  Some of us decided to go for a skinny dip and left our
clothes on the beach, which may have been a mistake because I now no
longer have a pair of pants.  It is in the ocean I assume...and in my
pants was my wallet...in my wallet was all my money and identification...

The next day, quite poor I headed back to Jalapa.  I phoned home and
told my family of my dilemma.  My mom naturally offered to pay for a
plane ticket home.  I could have been home 4 months ago if I had taken
up her offer, but instead, not out of pride but out of the opportunity
to experience what it is like to be so humble, I turned down such an
offer.  Really just to see if I could do it, I set out to make my way
home, pesoless.

My last week in Jalapa was spent working on the street, selling the
jewelry I learned how to make there with fellow Artisanos.  This
proved itself useless so like in all times of crisis I made cookies.
Seriously, I went to a friend's house who kindly lent me the
ingredients for the first batch and I made about 70 cookies and sold
them all the next day.  Then on the way home, I bought more
ingredients, and made several hundred cookies that night. I sold them
all in a matter of a few hours the next morning.  I made money this
way for 3 days before hitting the road with 2 lovely lady friends.

The three of us hitched to a town called Mazunte in Oaxaca to work on
the beach.  As it turns out we worked on nothing but our tans and made
much less money than we spent.  We met with 5 more girls from all over
the world and spent 2 days there before they all went their separate
directions.  I stayed there for a few more days, working a little
everyday just for my hotel room (my tent was quite broken, and still
is).

I left 2 days after they did, bound for Puerto Escondido.  I didn't
end up working on that beach either as I met a guy just after waking
up on the beach who gave me his rented surf board and told me I could
collect the deposit.  Needless to say I spent the whole day surfing.
I slept on the beach again that night and headed to the tourist trap
of Acapulco.

It took the better part of the day to get there but I got there in
time to work a little on the beach and when night fell, I headed up
onto the strip of discos where all the tourists go to spend money in
the night.  I sat down with my backpack and my drum and work in front
of me until a slightly drunk man approached me asking to play my
drum.  I saw that he was an Artisano as well by the display case he
had in his hands, so I took a look at his wares while he sang a song
with my drum.  He then invited me to come sell with his friends, more
Artisanos.  I followed him up the street and met a very cool group of
people making things in peoples hair called Trenzas de Colores.  These
are a kind of hair extension made with string kind of like a braid but
a little more complicated.  It can consist of several different kinds
of knots and the people in Mexico are crazy about them.  I quickly
learned how to make them and was on my way to making money.  I stayed
that night with some of the people I met and met a girl the next night
who I stayed with for the duration of my stay in Acapulco.  We did
move out of her house after about 8 days to live with another friend
up on the hill.

Now, up on the hill is a kind of valley that I was told about.  So one
day I went for an adventure after work.  I went after work because we
usually start at 8PM and end around 6AM when the tourists go home.
This is a prime opportunity for an early morning adventure.  I went up
into this valley composed of about 50 prominent and massive boulders,
some bigger than most houses.  These boulders are set on each other to
make a huge network of caves beneath them, almost all of which are
well lit.  I spent the day rock climbing and spelunking.

The next day I met a very good friend and offered to show him this
valley.  We were on our way to his house after work when we spotted a
police truck.  The truck pulled up to s and stopped and 5 police armed
with M16's stepped out of the back.  They told us to stop and demanded
a bag search.  When they found nothing they went on to say they needed
to take us in for further questioning.  This is really just a con to
get a bribe out of us.  We refused and another cop got out of the cab
and demanded another bag search, this time including my pockets and a
search through my wallet.  The others did their best to distract us,
and it didn't seem to matter how closely I watched my things get
rooted through.  They left soon after, probably because they stole
most of my money and my digital camera.  This was no bribe.  This was
blatant highway banditry made by sticky fingers.  To serve and
protect, my ass.

We carried on however, and made it up to the mountain again in the
morning.  We spent several hours free climbing up and down into caves
and up to the tops of massive boulders.

I left Acapulco son after that, still 4000 pesos short of being able
to legally cross into the United States.  You need to have a certain
amount of money in your pocket at the time in order to cross as they
don't want you working in their country.  More Mexicans will need to
learn how to climb walls now.  Here's to the Great Wall of America.

Anyways, I made it into a town called Zihuatenajo after I left and met
a little boy there who told me his mom owned a hostel.  I went with
him to El Rincon Del Viajero Hostel, roughly translated to &quot;The
Travelers Corner Hostel&quot;.  If you ever go there I would suggest
checking in there with Mali.  It is a very beautiful hostel with an
amazing host, well worth checking out.  I was able to clean there very
big and very green garden for a few nights of camping under their
patio.  I camped there instead of in the garden because my first night
I had some funny dreams about swimming and woke up in about a foot of
rain water in my tent...

I met a German girl there who lived in her Volkswagen van and traveled
to all the cool surf spots. She was heading to one such surf spot in
the same direction I was going, so I hitched a ride with her and got
back on the road.  I caught a good succession of rides for the next 2
days into Mazatlan.  My second last ride was in the back of a truck
with several surfboards bound for San Blas. They dropped me off in the
middle of the jungle there on a half built road.  Off in the distance
was pitch black at this time as a crazy storm was slowly rolling in my
direction.  I could see the road for miles to the north slowly become
very wet and get closer.  I could see forests of bamboo swaying in the
gale force winds and the ditch filled quickly with water.

The storm hit before anyone would pick me up (although many people
were kind enough to point at the storm in front of them to let me know
it was coming, as though I didn't see it...).  The wind hit me and with
it the rain.  Buckets upon buckets poured from the sky.  I had put my
bag on top of some rocks on the side of the road and covered it in my
rain coat, but this proved useless.  Everything was soaked through in
a matter of minutes.  I stood there for 20 minutes or so becoming
saturated with water until a big black pickup stopped.  I ran up to
him and looking like a drowned rat, asked where he was going.  He said
Mexicali.  At this point I think the heavens opened up and a chorus of
angels beckoned me into the back of the truck.  If you know your
Mexican geography, you will know that Mexicali is a border town right
next to Tijuana.

I sat in the back of the truck with my cat for 2 days.  We drove into
the desert by nightfall and the man and his wife checked into a
motel.  I slept in the back of the truck until it started raining
again and I retreated to the lobby of the motel to sleep on a bench.
We got on the road when the sun came up.  And it got hot.  Very fast.
In fact, it was way too hot for a kid who comes from an icebox like
Canada. It got up to about 50 degrees that day with the direct
sunlight beating down on me.  I drank water like a madman, but still
managed to stay very dehydrated.  I asked to come in the cab, but the
man said no, too may bags in there.  My cat was in the process of
dying and was drinking as much water as I was.  With no other options
I set my somewhat delirious mind to work and made a tent out of my
blanket in the back.  I simply hooked it on my feet and my elbows and
my head and opened up a flap at the back end so the wind could come
through.  This kept me out of the direct sunlight and filled my tent
with fresh blast furnace like wind.  This probably saved me from heat
stroke.

They dropped me off right next to the American border.  I got my cat
vaccinated for rabies and worms, put her in my drum and walked into
America.  This is how it went down...

I walked into the building and waited my turn in line for a while.  I
flashed the front of my passport to a guy and he said &quot;ok that's fine,
go check your bags.&quot;  So I put my backpack through their scanner and
raised no red flags so they passed me through.  Then I said, &quot;I have a
cat in a drum, what do I do with her?&quot;
They asked &quot;Is it was alive or dead,&quot; but nothing more.  Then I asked
where to get a visa.  And the man said &quot;You're Canadian, you don't
need one.&quot;
&quot;So where do I go?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Well&quot;, He said, &quot;Just walk right out those doors right there&quot;, as he
pointed to the United States.  So I said peace and love and left.

You may notice a fundamental step in crossing borders is missing
here.  I not once showed one piece of ID aside from the front of my
passport, and I didn't have a stamp in my passport.  I officially
entered the States as an Illegal Immigrant.  How applicable to have
entered this way from Mexico.

While I was in Mexicali I met a woman there who loved my cat sitting
on my shoulder, and because of her, she invited me to stay at her
house in the States.  I made it to a town called El Centro and stayed
at her house to dry out my still very wet bags.  I left the next day
and started hitchhiking in a place they call the Sonora Desert.  It's
really hot there.  Having drank all my water I flagged down a short
ride into the next town, where I got a ride to a truck stop about
100KM away.  Then I waited there on the exit to Interstate 10 for two
whole days until a trucker picked me up.  He drove me another 600
miles to San Francisco.  There I was left at a rest stop and picked up
not only at night, but by a woman, which almost never happens.  This
was because of my cat, once again.  Come now, any guy with a cat on
hit shoulder can't possibly be a bad person.  We drove together all
night and she talked a lot, but she had amazing stories from traveling
in Guatemala and Mexico.

She left me at another interstate exit on I 5 after taking me out for
2AM breakfast in a casino.  My next ride at 6AM got me into Redding,
California at the last big truck stop the man said.  I caught a ride
from there with another trucker all the way to Seattle Washington.  He
left me in a nasty spot however.  I slept at the truck stop on the
back of a flatbed trailer in between some boxes.  I had asked the man
the night before and in the morning was greeted with half a
cantaloupe.  I tried hitching at the truck stop until someone reported
me to the security and escorted me off the property.  From there I
went to the interstate exit for about an hour before a police man
pulled over, and only on his loud speaker (like the several other cop
encounters I had in America) told me to leave.  So I went to the road
that ran alongside the highway, but was told by yet another cop that I
couldn't hitch in town limits. So I caught the bus downtown.  I saw on
my map that there was a ferry to Victoria, British Colombia.  I walked
into the ferry terminal, cat in drum as usual and found out that I had
just enough money to get me there and from Nanaimo back to the
mainland in Vancouver.  Then my cat decided to stick her head out, and
the man said &quot;Aww, you've got a little kitty.  Are you taking her with
you?  It will be another 20$ for her ticket and if you don't have a
proper kennel for her, you can rent one for an additional 10$.&quot;  This
news brought my total way higher than I had money for.  Luckily the
man there was thinking fast and told me about a shuttle service to
downtown Vancouver from Seattle for only 30$ and that if my cat just
didn't stick her head out, there was no problem with her.  I took this
option and on the first of September I crossed back into Canada.  This
makes a total of 17 months abroad.

When I got back into Vancouver I got in contact with Ira Sutherland,
that guy I met 3 times biking across Canada.  He was back in town
after a huge adventure in South America and said I could stay at his
place.  I was on my way there when I met some of the local street
punks panhandling.  I was curious to experience the Canadian busking
and panhandling scene so I stuck around with them.  It is nothing like
Mexico.  People in México have respect for each other, they say please
and thank you and would you like to buy something.  In Vancouver they
say &quot;Gimme some money&quot;, and say that people like it rough; it's a
novelty for them.  I was pretty unimpressed.  I ended up staying with
all of them that night and learned places to sleep in Vancouver
streets.  I met up with another traveler who was with us and went with
her to the beach instead of sleeping in a gutter reeking of urine.

In the morning I got a new bank card as soon as the bank opened.  I
went for coffee with that traveler girl and walked around downtown for
the morning.  Then I went to Ira's house that night.  Being a traveler
himself, he understood fully why I didn't show up the night before.
Plans change all the time.

I stayed with Ira for a few days and went rock climbing the first day,
then we went on an epic bike ride, my first time on a bike in 4 months
along the entire coastline of Vancouver.  My legs loved it.

As luck would have it, Ira's parents happened to be driving to Golden
the next day, so I hitched a ride with them.  From golden I got a ride
right away into Lake Louise, and from there I was picked up by a cool
punk rock guy who drove me down the entire Icefields parkway, a truly
spectacular drive and dropped me off in Jasper.  From Jasper a man
picked me up on his way to Bingo in Hinton and was kind enough to go
out of his way to drop me off on my doorstep there.

Now comes the time when I rub in every naysayer and bad wishers face
that hitchhiking is a good and legitimate way to travel, although
never taken lightly and always with precaution.  For example, not once
in my life have I ever simply jumped in the front seat.  I always
leave my bags sitting where they are and run up to the car, ask some
questions, scope them out, and then decide if I should get in.  Just
don't be stupid and use your head.  I made it.

So in total I hitchhiked from Mazunte, Oaxaca, just north of the
Guatemala border to my house in Hinton, Alberta, a trip of close to
5000 KM in 23 days, excluding my 2 weeks in Acapulco.  Not bad, eh?

So that was the past, now some words on the future.  I really can't be
sure at this point that I will take up bicycling again and finish the
trip.  I feel that I have had an amazing trip, and I have no regrets
in 17 months.  I traveled a total of close to 20,000 KM by bike and
around 10,000 KM hitchhiking.  I don't really know exact figures right
now.  I have learned so much, met so many amazing people, experienced
so many eye opening events and I have successfully broadened my mind
to the point that it will never stop getting wider.  I also got a
wonderful virus in my travels.  It's called the Travel Bug.  I'm
stricken with it.  I can't stop now, although it may not be quite like
I had planned from the beginning, I will still keep moving.  My future
plans are as such.  In the short term I will be returning to Hinton
for no more than a day, just long enough to pack my bag there and
leave.  Hinton is a dead end town for someone like me.  I would die
inside if I stayed there.  I plan on heading into interior British
Colombia instead to work on the ski hills for the winter, replenish my
funds and next spring there may be a return trip to Mexico.  More on
that trip later.  However, as you know, plans are made to change, and
they change frequently.

Lastly I want to thank you all for tuning into my travels.  I hope I
might have inspired some of you to get out and move your bodies.  It's
easier than you think in this day and age of super fast and efficient
travel. Thank you to everyone who has helped me along the way;
Everyone who has let me fill up a water bottle, or picked me up on the
highway, or allowed me to sleep in their yard.  Without the kindness
of strangers I might not have been able to make it this far.  I have
learned that the world is filled with amazing people, even if it takes
some time to find them sometimes.  Thank you all so very much.  Peace
and Love, Brothers and Sisters.
