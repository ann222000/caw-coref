The book is The Foreigner's Gift. It is availbale on amazon.com.

Other books that show that Gadhafi quit his wmd project due to
Saddam's demise by teh US nad UK in 2003 are the following:

1)Shopping for Bombs

2)Allah's Bomb

3)At the Center of the Storm (former CIA director George Tenet's
autobio)

4)Godless by Ann Coulter

5)Statecraft by Dennis Ross

Not a book but check the cnn.com website for what Gadhafi himself said
in a Dec. 22, 2003 interview and how he pretty much admitted when he
didn't have to that he quit wmds due to the Iraqi invasion.
