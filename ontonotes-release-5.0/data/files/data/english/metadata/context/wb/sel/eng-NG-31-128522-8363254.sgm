NRC Sends Special Inspection Team to Brunswick Nuclear Plant

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has dispatched a Special Inspection Team
to the Brunswick nuclear power plant, operated by Progress Energy near
Southport on the southeastern coast of North Carolina. The team will inspect
and assess circumstances associated with a July 26th failure of a valve in
the cooling water system for one of the redundant loops of the Unit 1
Residual Heat Removal, or RHR, system. The RHR system is used to remove
decay heat, and in an accident, it can also be used to inject water into the
reactor core. On July 26th, two RHR service water pumps tripped on low
suction pressure, and Progress Energy declared that loop of the system
inoperable.

Plant employees determined that a water supply valve had failed, and after
an analysis and repairs to the valve, that loop of the RHR system was
declared operable again. NRC officials said that Progress Energy repaired
the valve quickly and there was no threat to public health and safety at any
time.

The NRC's two-person Special Inspection Team is developing a sequence of
events related to the valve failure; reviewing the company's response to
earlier information the NRC issued on these valves; assessing the plant
staff's analysis, maintenance and corrective actions on the valves; and
identifying any generic issues for Brunswick or other nuclear plants. The
special inspection is expected to take about a week, and the NRC will issue
a report within 30 days of the completion of the inspection.
