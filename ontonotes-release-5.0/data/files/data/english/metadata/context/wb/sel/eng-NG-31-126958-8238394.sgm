Phil Schapp, WKCR's chronomaniac, in the middle of the
seven-day memorial broadcast (available on the internet) for
Max Roach, has just announced the death of Evelyn Blakey.

Odd fact:  She shared a birthdate and deathdate with Max
Roach.

To clarify, she was born on his birthday, and they both died
last Thursday.  She was much younger.

===================

As I type this, my eyes water. Evelyn was a dear friend to me. She was
my maid of honor. She was the star that shined the brightest in the
sky. Evelyn will be in my heart forever.
