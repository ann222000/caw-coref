Scientists at the University of Liverpool have discovered how fish have
evolved over the last 400 million years to stay motionless at different
water depths.

A research team led by Dr Michael Berenbrink, a Comparative
Physiologist at the School of Biological Sciences, has revealed how
modern fish, such as pike and cod, have developed a way of floating at
certain water levels using a gas-filled swimbladder.

Dr Berenbrink investigated the mechanism that allows fishes to keep the
swimbladder inflated with gas even at great water pressure in the
depths of the sea. The mechanism comprises of a complex system of
arteries and veins, called the rete mirabile, and special blood
proteins, which can release oxygen even at high oxygen concentrations.

These systems drive oxygen from the blood into the swimbladder allowing
the fish to float at different levels in the sea without coming to the
surface of the water for air. A similar system is also present in the
eye of the fish, which provides oxygen to the retina.

Dr Berenbrink explains: &quot;I am interested in how the mechanisms in the
swimbladder and eye could have evolved. Some fish have no swimbladder
and others fill it by swallowing air at the surface of the water.
Another group of fishes has a closed swimbladder that is inflated
through gas secretion even when they are in high water pressures. My
aim was to find out how these systems came into place and how this
allowed for the great variety of fishes we have in our oceans today.&quot;

The study revealed that the special blood proteins, which are essential
for oxygen secretion, were present in the eye system 250 million years
ago. This predated the swimbladder system by 100 million years. The
special blood proteins induced development of the swimbladder system.

Dr Berenbrink continued: &quot;Many researchers believe that the swimbladder
evolved from a primitive lung, which can be traced back 400 million
years. These findings will help us to understand the diversity and
success of modern fishes in their environment.&quot;
