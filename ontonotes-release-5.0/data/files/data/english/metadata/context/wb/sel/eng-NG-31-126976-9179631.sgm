The State of New York announced plans for a major reconstruction of
Pennsylvania Station in New York City.  The current Madison Square
Garden would be torn down, as reported by 1010wins newsradio today.

Some details are available at the following website, there are
additional links to other websites.

http://www.empire.state.ny.us/moynihanstation/default.asp

How firm these plans are I don't know.

As a passenger my first concern is convenience.  A fancy daylight
'great hall' is a burden to me if I'm forced to walk an e-w city block
more to get tickets or to/from my train.  I don't know the details of
the latest plan, but some past plans moved critical stuff over to the
former US Post Office which is a full city block west of where most
people are going.  It seems many planners are focused on the grand
architecture, not the needs of actual train passengers.

(I wish they'd reopen the underground concourse from Penn Sstation to
Herald Square for ease of use to the Sixth Avenue subways there.)

I agree.  This project does nothing to solve the transit issues.  All this
does is build a monument as some politician's legacy.

I have not read the entire Scope of Work, (It's 100 pages) but all it
appears to address is the headhouse and the retail space.  Nowhere does
it involve increasing train capacity.  Increasing capacity by added tracks
and tunnels should be their first priority - THEN they'd have a need to
fix the headhouse....

And I can't imagine why the Dolan's would want to give up their tax benefits
and their subsidized Con Ed bills....  but that's me.

Cheers!

Like most other sports venues that haven't been rebuilt, remodelled or
whatever that costs money to put up, MSG is seen as &quot;antiquated&quot; and
cannot compete in today's modern word of sporting arenas by some. Having
tried and failed to secure the West Side Yard property, the Dolan
family's next big bet is to latch onto the &quot;new&quot; Penn Station thing and
some how get part or all of the costs of a new MSG paid for by
taxpayers, like most every other sporting venue construction plan.

After all both the Mets and Yankees will have brand new venues soon, and
then there is that new stadium going up as part of the Brooklyn Yards,
which will at first have the Nets, but if every old man in NYC gets his
wish, Mr. Ratner will buy the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; Dodgers and install them there
as well.

For NYC's/NYS's part, having MSG/the Dolan family on board with the plan
for the &quot;new&quot; Penn Station, will at least help defray some of the costs
if not in reconstruction/construction, at least assist in making the new
station a destination and anchor it will need to be to keep from being
the same giant millstone around NYC's neck, as the old Penn Station was
for Penn. Building a new station is fine and dandy, but as NYP well new,
buildings don't run themselves nor in of themselves pay their way. IIRC
the idea is sort of something like what has been done with GCT, with
restaurants, shops and the like.

The Hotel Pennsylvania is being replaced.  Perhaps one of the basement
levels of the Manhattan Mall could be extended through the basement of
the new building and across Seventh Avenue.  Then you could walk through
the mall from Sixth Avenue to Seventh Avenue.

Different passageway.   The murder (or maybe it was a rape) was in a
passage below 6th Ave that ran between the 34th and 42nd St stations.
And it was in the 90's, IIRC.

Of course, there could have been a murder in the Gimbel's passageway
in the 80's, but there wasn't one announced as the reason for the
closure.

The people at 2600.com, the hacking mag, are complaining that one of
the buildings built along with the old Penn Station, the Hotel
Pennsylvania, is going to be torn down. (They have their hacking
conventions there.)

The hotel, built by the famous firm of McKim Mead &amp; White  (of course,
Stanford White was killed by a jealous hubby at the rooftop garden of
an earlier Madison Sq. Garden) is best known for the Glen Miller tune
built around its phone number, PEnnsylvania 6-5000.

(OJ's trial was the trial of the last century? What about the White
murder, two Clarence Darrow trials - Scopes and Leopold/Loeb, Fatty
Arbuckle and the Double Indemnity murder trial of Ruth Snyder and Judd
Gray at Court House Sq.? Not to mention the boring old constitutional
argument court cases that went to the Supreme Court that really WERE
important and changed history like Brown vs. Board or Roe vs. Wade?)

It is a &quot;dingy passageway&quot; now, but then it was one of the greatest
ideas for a hote.  It allowed people comming from the trains going to
gimbles and/or the hotel, not to get wet when it rained.   Do some
research and you'll see that Gimbles used to be where the mall is now.

You're going to have an uphill battle trying to save hotel Pennsylvania.
Merrill Lynch is seriously considering moving to whatever office tower
is built there, and even if ML does not, the hotel is going to be torn
down. It will join the growing trend of Manhattan hotels either
demolished or converted into residential condos.

The Plaza hotel had lots of great history behind it as well, didn't keep
it from being converted to mostly condo apartments now did it? If Mayor
Bloomberg hadn't stuck his oars in, the building would have been totally
converted.

With real estate prices in prime areas of Manhattan going through the
roof, any building not pulling it's potential weight in profit is fair
game for redevelopment. Especially hotels which by their nature do not
have those pesky permanent tenants to deal with. Rumour has it that the
Roosevelt Hotel near Grand Central Terminal may be put up for sale soon
as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The State of New York announced plans for a major reconstruction of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Pennsylvania Station in New York City.  The current Madison Square
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Garden would be torn down, as reported by 1010wins newsradio today.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Some details are available at the following website, there are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;additional links to other websites.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.empire.state.ny.us/moynihanstation/default.asp

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;How firm these plans are I don't know.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As a passenger my first concern is convenience.  A fancy daylight
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;'great hall' is a burden to me if I'm forced to walk an e-w city
&gt; block
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;more to get tickets or to/from my train.  I don't know the details
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the latest plan, but some past plans moved critical stuff over to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;former US Post Office which is a full city block west of where most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people are going.  It seems many planners are focused on the grand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;architecture, not the needs of actual train passengers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(I wish they'd reopen the underground concourse from Penn Sstation
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Herald Square for ease of use to the Sixth Avenue subways there.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; The people at 2600.com, the hacking mag, are complaining that one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the buildings built along with the old Penn Station,

&gt; theHotelPennsylvania, is going to be torn down. (They have their hacking

&gt; &gt; &gt; conventions there.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; The hotel, built by the famous firm of McKim Mead &amp; White  (of
&gt; course,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stanford White was killed by a jealous hubby at the rooftop garden
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; an earlier Madison Sq. Garden) is best known for the Glen Miller
&gt; tune
&gt; &gt; &gt; built around its phone number, PEnnsylvania 6-5000.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (OJ's trial was the trial of the last century? What about the White
&gt; &gt; &gt; murder, two Clarence Darrow trials - Scopes and Leopold/Loeb, Fatty
&gt; &gt; &gt; Arbuckle and the Double Indemnity murder trial of Ruth Snyder and
&gt; Judd
&gt; &gt; &gt; Gray at Court House Sq.? Not to mention the boring old
&gt; constitutional
&gt; &gt; &gt; argument court cases that went to the Supreme Court that really WERE
&gt; &gt; &gt; important and changed history like Brown vs. Board or Roe vs. Wade?)

&gt; &gt; Yes we are complaining, however not for the only reason.  The hotel is
&gt; &gt; worth saving if only to keep midtown from becoming the new wall st.

&gt; You're going to have an uphill battle trying to save hotel Pennsylvania.
&gt; Merrill Lynch is seriously considering moving to whatever office tower
&gt; is built there, and even if ML does not, the hotel is going to be torn
&gt; down. It will join the growing trend of Manhattan hotels either
&gt; demolished or converted into residential condos.
">

Unfortunately it's not a good candidate for conversion, because it's
so bulky. A building of that shape in  Chicago was converted, and the
ratio of outside wall to floor space was so low that every apartment
was basically a railroad flat (long rooms or halls stretching from the
service core) without even the benefit of the &quot;airshafts&quot; our
tenements had.

Speaking of Sanford White, the building where he romanced Miss. Nesbitt,
collapsed yesterday.
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/nyregion/28collapse.html?ref=nyregion

As for the Hotel Pennsylvania, yes, there simply isn't the sort of guest
traffic in the Herald Square area to warrant upgrading/restoring the old
girl. The most upscale thing to happen in the building is the annual
Vera Wang bridal sample sale (if they are still held there). Every other
hotel in the area is either a low budget tourist trap, or fleabag
welfare style hotel. Things improve a bit as one moves up 8th Avenue
towards Times Square, but not by much. Even the newly expanded Javitts
Centre won't help the Penny hotel as it simply is too far west to be of
any use.

Again, land being what it is today in Manhattan, the best use of that
property is an office building, especially now that plans are underway
to build over the West Side Rail Yards. Our grand and great grand
children shall probably know a vastly different area than we do now.

The Hilton Passageway that led to the hotel is not the same one that led to
Gimbels. The passageways served a somewhat different purpose than they would
today -- and although I think they would be helpful, promoting them is
trickier than simply informed (or uninformed) nostalgia.

Direct access to subways was very important for department stores &quot;Back in
the Day&quot; -- Macy's, Gimbels and Saks 34th (through Gimbels and across/above
32nd Street) could be reached without going outside; One could get to
Wanamaker's from the BMT at 8th Street as well. In Philadelphia, one could
get to Wanamaker's, Lt's, Gimbels and Strawbridge and Clothier directly from
the subway (and Suburban Station and before that, Broad Street Station).

I believe that Marshall Fields and others in Chicago, and Filene's in Boston
also had subway access.

In any case, what made this work was also that the department stores all
offered free delivery within 50 miles of Columbus Circle, so one could shop
all day and not have to carry stuff around or be jostled with it on the
subway )or commuter railroad) on the way home.

The third leg of this relationship was radio -- stations like WCBS, WOR,
WNBC and WABC (and their predecessors) and others made their living with
advertising for the stores that offered free
delivery and daytime chatter programming that informed housewives about
things going on in the City to attract them in to see shows and museums have
dinner with their [commuting] spuses as
well as sales in the stores.

It was all a different lifestyle, to be sure, in the pre-suburban mall days.

There's a very elaborate, recently redesigned network of underground

Original poster did not state all bathrooms in the suite were full
baths. Entirely possible the suite has only two or even one full
bathroom, with the remaining baths &quot;powder rooms&quot;, or some sort of
similar non-full bath.

Very common arrangement in homes and large apartments. If possible
master bedrooms always have their own private baths, leaving another
full bath to serve any remaining bedrooms. Powder rooms are required as
guests and visitors only require a place for &quot;freshening up&quot;.

If you mean similar to the ones in Paris, Metro; highly doubt it due to
lack of space. Too much property in the way, and virtually none of it
owned by the MTA, NYC or NYS. Not to mention all the stuff underground
which would have to be shifted  if that was where  you were going. What
NYC should do is seriously consider a page from many European cities and
make say 34th Street and 42nd Street, between certain avenues in
Mid-Town closed to vehicular traffic during the day. Exempting buses and
perhaps taxicabs, it would allow for faster movement cross-town, and
even the possibility of some sort of tram line similar to what is now
running in Paris.

Who, besides a railfan is making the connection?

In any case, when the extension to the #7 is done and the &quot;Station&quot; is in

Commuters, of course, take the E train, which gets them to Rockefeller

And if one wants to just throw money down the rat hole to connect the dots,
there's a group going around trying to undo NJT's THE Tunnel with a

But in the end, a rat hole is still a rat-hole. Look at Philadelphia's
Center City Commuter tunnel to see the cost-effectiveness from the

train operation more efficient).

I remember reading somewhere that there are some tunnel stubs that

Actually, it's NJT that undid ARC Alternative G and its connection
between NY Penn and Grand Central, which would deliver &quot;commuters&quot; where
they wanted to go to, instead of to some bunker station 17 stories below

If  you live in the Northern suburbs and work in Long Island or New
Jersey,
it might make commuting by public transportation competitive with
driving.
As it is, the additional half hour or so you have to allow to get from
GCT to
NYP makes any commute that involves changing stations impractical.

For that matter, I sometimes go to NJ or Philadephia from Westchester
County;
I'd rather take the train than drive, but not to the tune of an extra
hour or two
each way.

I say &quot;might&quot;, because the practicality of taking the train would
still depend upon
how much mid-town Manhattan is out of the way and on how the schedules
mesh.

For sure.  Yesterday, Macy's opened a  downtown Portland (OR) store
in the grand old 11-story building that was once the Meier and Frank
flagship department store (Macy's acquired them about 5 years ago).
They advertised heavily about the (nostalgic) advantages of shopping
downtown, right where the MAX light-rail stopped and opening day was
swamped.  The building was refurbished with 5 floors of Macy's on its
lower part and 6 floors of luxury downtown condo apartments above
that.

Thanks for the tip.  I wish we would have known that this past spring

I hope that it's that good the next time that we visit, a couple of

Each bedroom had an adjoining  full bath with a tub.  The bathroom off

How about:

* The LIRR's new station dug UNDER the existing GCT, for east side
access, because MN won't give up track space?

* The NY DOT and LIRR unable to come up with a park and ride at the ex
Cerro Wire site - which sits RIGHT NEXT TO BOTH THE LIE AND LIRR.

* PATH and the NYC subway still not connected.

* No &quot;one stop ticketing&quot; machines in this area, not even between the
LIRR , subway and Metro-North.

* LIRR and MN tickets being different physical sizes and shapes (this
might have been fixed by now - I haven't been on MN in years).

* NYC / NY State DOT and the PA not being able to get their act together
at the GWB.

* No logical, or even consistent format to schedules or line names.

* No common 'clearing house' website for travel information.

* Different payment modes for different services.

* JFK's Airtrain system, which provides non-compatible rail access to an
airport that's bordered on one side by a rail line.

* Ronkonkoma station and the terminal at Macarthur Airport are at
opposite ends of the facility.

* The enormously inconsistent fare structure of suburban lines around
the city.

* No integration with Amtrak or other services.

* Metro-North trains seen in Penn Station, which is a stop Metro-north
doesn't even service.

Don't even get started on the numerous electric standards used around
NYC, which would be enough to fill a decent list.  Even third rail
standards different between systems.

If I landed in the NYC area from somewhere else, I'd have no idea how to
get to Newark NJ from Stamford CT, or even what agencies were involved
(New Jersey Transit goes to NY?  Metro-North is a commuter train?  PATH
looks like the subway but has a different fare structure, different
turnstiles, and doesn't connect with the subway system?  HBLRT is run by
NJT but I can't buy tickets at Penn Station for it?.)

Actually, the top floors are supposed to become a hotel called &quot;The Nines&quot;
that when it opens is supposed to be the most luxurious in Portland.  They
are still working on the uppor floors, but wanted the Macy's store open
for the Christmas season.

They may be aiming for the wrong market though.  That hotel will have by
far the best transit service in Portland and perhaps aiming a little lower
would hit the market better.
