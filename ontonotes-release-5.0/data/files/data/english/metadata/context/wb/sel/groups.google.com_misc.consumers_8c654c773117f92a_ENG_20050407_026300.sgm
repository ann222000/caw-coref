...have legal grounds for making a copy of your picture ID card?
My own bank insisted on it when I withdrew several thousand from my
savings account. I have no problem with their wanting to examine my
ID; I'm just concerned about their insisting I allow them to photocopy
it. Is my paranoia showing?

Cash transactions over some trigger amount, ISTR $5k but not sure, must
be reported to somewhere.

Yes, I did withdraw cash, but why would, assuming the money is my own,
would Homeland Security be interested? It's mine, not theirs, and what
I chose to do with it is, as long as I'm not doing anything illegal, my
own concern.

"/> Because a cash transaction is untraceable. In the current (US) climate, if you
want to use large wads of cash, you're assumed to be up to no good. True
Americans (tm) use nice, traceable checks or credit cards.

A lot of this crap predates the War On Terrorism (tm), a lot of it dates from
the War on Drugs (tm). Hell, some of it probably dates from the War on Demon
Alcohol (tm 1920).

"/> As long as you pay taxes on it. Large cash transactions are often
considered to be money-laundering or part of the underground economy
(drugs, weapons, etc.), so they want to know who's doing it. Oh,
you didn't know about their motto: &quot;Guilty until proven not quite
so guilty (there's no such thing as innocent)&quot;.

Have you heard about the forfeiture laws which for all practical
purposes make possession of &quot;too much&quot; United States currency a crime?
I figure &quot;too much&quot; cash is around the price of a donut.

"/> I'm not sure where you are getting your misinformation, bnut the
requirement is to report all large (over $10,000) cash transactions -
not just deposits.
http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol3/v3n16lau_body.html
Between 1970 and 1995, a series of U.S. laws, regulations, and
directives have sought to scrutinize movements of large cash
transactions and suspicious financial activities. The Bank Secrecy Act
(1970) obligates financial institutions to report cash transactions in
excess of $10,000 using the Currency Transaction Report (CTR) and
requires individuals to report the transportation of currency in
excess of $5,000 (now $10,000) into or out of the United States.

The 1986 Money Laundering Control Act declared money laundering to be
a crime in its own right and made &quot;structuring&quot;—transactions to avoid
filing a CTR—a criminal offense. In 1995, Clinton signed Presidential
Decision Directive 42, which freezes U.S. assets of Colombian drug
trafficking organizations and bars U.S. companies from doing business
with the traffickers’ front companies.

"/> Let's see.

You withdraw a few thousand dollars, in cash. They want to see your ID.
Then they want to document the fact they checked your ID by making a
Xerox copy. Sounds OK to me so far.

Later your dementia kicks in and you don't remember withdrawing the
money. You run to your bank with your lawyer in tow, demanding your
money. Bank says you did indeed withdrew the money and we can prove it.
We have a copy of your ID you presented at the time.

Case closed. No litigation. No bad feelings.

A better way to say the above would be: I could, if the bank gave me a
copy of the transaction recepit, easily prove said transaction occured.
No waste of Xerox paper required.

"/> Yes, they do. I had far more money in my Washington Mutual account than the
amount I needed, but the bastards would only give me a cashier's check. I
took that check to BofA where I had maybe $4K in my accounts, and BosA was
happy to cash it for me.

When I closed out my WM accounts (they lost our signature card when I closed
out the FIRST account and it took them at least 45 minutes of GOD knows what
before they mentioned that I could show them my driver's license in order to
close out the second account) they didn't even bother to ask why I was taking
out that much money, so I told the guard on the way out. I figured somebody
should know even if they didn't give a shit.

I hope all those phishers who concentrated on WM made a big haul that WM will
have to make good on. Serves 'em right.
