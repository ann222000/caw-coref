It appears the Clark Government didn't have the justification to send
In the Jack boots to torment the Tuhoe Nation.
I am not going to say to Sue and co. I told you so. As I don't think
Clark is being
Completely honest with what is going on.
Now the state wants to increase its powers to control terrorism.
What a better way to justify the introduction of oppressive laws
Is to legally lose a case against some local agitators.

You weren't paying enough attention.  The Solicitor General said that
police action was fully justified.  He said the Terrorism Suppression

And bit by bit, legislation could be justified that takes
away our right to _not_ have the state observe everything
that every citizen of the country does 24/7, and bit by bit
the right is taken away for every citizen to know what the
state is doing.
And of course we'll willingly comply, because &quot;if you
haven't done anything wrong, then there's nothing to fear&quot;.
And of course this will all be conducted by bureaucrats -
&quot;free from political interference&quot;.
And what better way to get this started than to show the
people how very &quot;real&quot; the threat from within is.

Yep, as was feared by many when the bullshit anti terror laws were passed
and has been seen time and time again in the USA with thier 'patriot act'
the new and over the top powers given to the police will be abused against
those who have nothing to do with terrorism.

No, needs to redraw the law to make it workable.  If you read the report or even
a for-grownups summary, you'll note that the police action was commended but the
_law_ as written required an over-complicated set of procedures to constitute
proof i.e. that it was impractical in operation because badly written - not that
it was unfair or oppressive.

Yes, what a good excuse to whitewash the activities of the people picked up in
this operation - because the law was badly written the full information cannot
be presented to public view in court, which gives the ideal opportunity for
those who were lucky to evade this disclosure to launch a major spin offensive.

Who's &quot;whitewashing&quot; their activities?
FFS, they're still facing serious charges aren't they?
If there's proof of a conspiracy, then there should be
additional charges.  If there's no proof of a conspiracy,
then surely new laws shouldn't be created to allow that
standards for proof should be lowered.

I tend to agree with you - it probably also explains why the
press releases and jackboot disguise tactics - to make sure
of maximum media impact.
It was ludicrous to suggest that rootin' shootin' pig and

animal rights activists in Wellington.

I have had a look at the anti-terrorism law (messy/poorly written as it is)

One of the key media instructions appears to have been to not describe any of
the accused as &quot;peace activists&quot; at any time.

&quot;Environmental activist&quot; and &quot;animal rights activist&quot; were allowed.

For a good proportion of the accused, &quot;peace activist&quot; would be considerably
more accurate.

Determining where this spin was applied would reveal someone who should resign.

We? Why are we 'entitled' to know such things?

Guns can be used for all sorts of things. While it may be illegal

&gt;&gt; You weren't paying enough attention.  The Solicitor General
&gt;&gt; said that  police action was fully justified.

&gt;Well he's fucking wrong! Just like you!

OK then, tell him this and then post his reply to you.

Until then remain, as is your habit, hostage to your own idiotic

&gt;&gt; I am not going to say to Sue and co. I told you so. As I don't

&gt;&gt; Clark is being
&gt;&gt; Completely honest with what is going on.
&gt;&gt; Now the state wants to increase its powers to control
&gt;&gt; terrorism.

&gt; No, needs to redraw the law to make it workable.  If you read
&gt; the report or even a for-grownups summary, you'll note that the
&gt; police action was commended but the _law_ as written required
&gt; an over-complicated set of procedures to constitute proof i.e.
&gt; that it was impractical in operation because badly written -
&gt; not that it was unfair or oppressive.

&gt;&gt; What a better way to justify the introduction of oppressive
&gt;&gt; laws
&gt;&gt; Is to legally lose a case against some local agitators.

&gt; Yes, what a good excuse to whitewash the activities of the
&gt; people picked up in this operation - because the law was badly
&gt; written the full information cannot be presented to public view
&gt; in court, which gives the ideal opportunity for those who were
&gt; lucky to evade this disclosure to launch a major spin
&gt; offensive.
">

Yeah right. So you are another, along with Bilestain, to say they
were in fact terrorists?

Convenient for the Police to not have to tell the public what
evidence proved they were terrorists. Hide it under the carpet,
eh.

It's all bullshit, lies and smoke and mirrors.

Yes. It's just a precursor to the new Police powers to curtail

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not going to say to Sue and co. I told you so. As I don't think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Clark is being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Completely honest with what is going on.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now the state wants to increase its powers to control terrorism.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What a better way to justify the introduction of oppressive laws
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is to legally lose a case against some local agitators.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And bit by bit, legislation could be justified that takes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; away our right to _not_ have the state observe everything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that every citizen of the country does 24/7, and bit by bit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the right is taken away for every citizen to know what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state is doing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And of course we'll willingly comply, because &quot;if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; haven't done anything wrong, then there's nothing to fear&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And of course this will all be conducted by bureaucrats -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;free from political interference&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And what better way to get this started than to show the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people how very &quot;real&quot; the threat from within is.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong and right who is to judge.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Law now is the judge, law and precedent.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How easily shall the Government whip away protestors merely on their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swaying voters away from them threatening their greedy purse strings?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They may have no compulsion to name people they have taken through the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; night.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Law's inadequacies require making public that the discerning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; masses may view the present terrorism laws and confer with the sitting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Government why change is plausible.

s.5 defines a Terrorist Act
s.13 outlines participating in Terrorist Groups

I have looked at it too.

The &quot;excuse&quot; that the act was written to cover terrorism
outside of NZ, and not &quot;domestic&quot; terrorism seems absurd.
There are even several specific clauses in the act adding to
the apparent intent of it to cover acts of terror within NZ
- to ensure that it actually also covers terrorist acts
outside of NZ.

We live in interesting times.

IMO The &quot;does not apply to NZ&quot; claim made for reasons as you
say - they don't have anywhere enough evidence of terrorism,
and want to broaden the definition to encompass &quot;political
dissent&quot; - perhaps even &quot;thought crime&quot;.

Frederick's point (as I see it) was that the SG's response tended to
promote surveillence (or fishing trips, per the recent Auckland
motorway police exercise). Thus there isn't any substantial change
from the offical doctrine that 9/11 was the justification for
widespread interception of domestic communications. Rather than raise
the policy issues which led to the prosecution of firearms offences
being touted as being anti-terror measures, the SG basically made a
scapegoat of the legislation.

Burke's specious questions can be extended to the point
where you could just as easily ask why any law abiding
citizen should worry if government spies should place a
security camera in their bedroom, or your &quot;local bobby&quot;
drive an armoured vehicle with a machine gun turret.

Yeah - sometimes I'll troll you Sue, but I usually prefer

It's all I expected from you.
It would seem that your POV and beliefs are somehow sacrosacnt and dont
require proof or justification from you, where as everyone else's POV and
beliefs do.

Unfortunately for you, in the real world AND in this forum you're just like
everyone else, and DO have to prove the validity of your POV and beliefs,
and justify them.

Of course you can chose NOT to do that if you want to.
Which proves you're just another BS idiot ranting and raving about nothing
at all...

&gt;&gt;&gt; To see if he would be *honest* for once and stop posting his usual
&gt;&gt;&gt; BS in nz.general...

&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean, here he is, in this forum, claiming he is having his
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'freedoms' being removed by law and the police.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But he wont tell us what these 'freedoms' are, and that we ALL need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be afraid, be VERY afraid.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's a thought;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why dont you have a go at answering these questrions and tell us how
&gt;&gt;&gt; YOU think you're affected by anti-terrorism laws:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even thought you (apparently) have done nothing illegal, do you still
&gt;&gt;&gt; fear the law and/or police?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dont you like the law and/or the police because they go after those
&gt;&gt;&gt; that act illegally.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Question(s) for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What freedoms do you fear losing under anti-terrorism laws?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Be specific.

&gt;&gt;&gt; List them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Describe *in detail* what it is that YOU will lose.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell us why you think you have a right to that particular 'freedom'

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have had a look at the anti-terrorism law (messy/poorly written as
&gt;&gt;&gt; it is) and no matter how hard I look, there is nothing in it that
&gt;&gt;&gt; will affect me and mine in any way at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How is it going to affect you?

&gt;&gt; Ha ha.

&gt;&gt; Even if Colp gives you the answers that you don't deserve,
&gt;&gt; you're still just a pond scum.

&gt; Response noted.
&gt; It's all I expected from you.
&gt; It would seem that your POV and beliefs are somehow sacrosacnt and dont
&gt; require proof or justification from you, where as everyone else's POV
&gt; and beliefs do.

&gt; Unfortunately for you, in the real world AND in this forum you're just
&gt; like everyone else, and DO have to prove the validity of your POV and
&gt; beliefs, and justify them.

&gt; Of course you can chose NOT to do that if you want to.
&gt; Which proves you're just another BS idiot ranting and raving about
&gt; nothing at all...
">

Ahhahhaa
So to take your POV doesn't require proof, but to dispute
your POV does?
You're the one that's happy with the government having
increased powers *without guarantee* that they wouldn't
misuse them - even against subservient gits like you.

&gt;&gt; Burke's specious questions can be extended to the point
&gt;&gt; where you could just as easily ask why any law abiding
&gt;&gt; citizen should worry if government spies should place a
&gt;&gt; security camera in their bedroom, or your &quot;local bobby&quot;
&gt;&gt; drive an armoured vehicle with a machine gun turret.
