Crawfish or Shrimp Etoufee

Seasoning Mix:
2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. ground red pepper (pref. cayenne)
1 tsp. white pepper
1 tsp. black pepper
1 tsp. dried sweet basil
1/2 tsp. dried thyme leaves

Etoufee:
1/4 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped green bell peppers
7 Tablespoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups, in all Seafood Stock
1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, in all
2 lb. peeled crawfish tails or medium shrimp
1 cup finely chopped green onions
4 cups hot cooked rice

Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl ad set
aside. In a separate bowl combine the onions, celery and bell peppers.

In a large heavy skillet (pref. cast iron) heat the oil over high heat
until it begins to smoke, about 4 minutes. With a long-handled metal
whisk, gradually mix in the flour, stirring until smooth. Continue
cooking, whisking constantly, until roux is dark red-brown, about 3-5
minutes (be careful not to let it scorch in the pan or splash on you).
Remove from heat and immediately stir in the vegetables and 1 tablespoon
of the seasoning mix with a wooden spoon; continue stirring until cooled,
about 5 minutes.

In a 2 qt saucepan bring 2 cups of the stock to a boil over high heat.
Gradually add the roux and whisk until thoroughly dissolved. Reduce heat
to low and cook until flour taste is gone, about 2 minutes, whisking
almost constantly (if any of the mixture scorches, don't continue to
scrape that part of the pan bottom). Remove from heat and set aside.

In a 4 qt. saucepan melt 1 stick of the butter over medium heat. Stir in
the crawfish (or shrimp) and the green onions; saute about 1 minute,
stirring almost constantly. Add the remaining stick of butter, the stock
mixture and the remaining 1 cup stock; cook until butter melts and is
mixed into the sauce, about 4-6 minutes, constantly shaking the pan in a
back and forth motion (versus stirring). Add the remaining seasoning mix;
stir well and remove from heat (if sauce starts separating, add about 2
tablespoons more of stock or water and shake pan until it combines). Serve
immediately over rice.

Note: Can substitute Knorr Seafood or Veggie Boullion for stock.
