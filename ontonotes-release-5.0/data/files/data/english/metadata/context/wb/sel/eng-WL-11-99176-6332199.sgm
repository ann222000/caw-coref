Medea Benjamin summarizes recent developments from the Iraqi government, in which the President, Vice-President, and National Security Adviser have all called for a concrete timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from their country, to be largely finished by the end of 2007. What's interesting about this, in relation to the recent Democratic proposals , is two-fold. One is that, in comparison to the Levin-Reed-Salazar plan, at least, the Iraqis are calling for a more aggressive plan for withdrawal than the Democrats (and that's the "left" Democrats; most of the Democrats, including such Presidential contenders as Clinton and Biden, don't even support the mild Levin plan, much less the slightly more aggressive Kerry plan). But the second is, I think, more significant. From what I heard from Levin et al. and Kerry et al., none of them even bothered to mention what the Iraqis want. It was all about us (or perhaps I should say "them,"), and how "we" had to force the Iraqis to take responsibility. What the Iraqis themselves are calling for wasn't of interest.

Eli, if you can bear it you should check out some of the posts and comments over at AmericaBlog (supposedly "left" and "liberal") over the last few days, on the topic of amnesty for Iraqis who have been imprisoned for fighting back against
occupying troops. John Aravosis is hysterical over the idea, and wants the D.C. Dems to self-righteously bash the Republicans who seem inclined to accept the proposal. He's posted on it a number of times, and I've gotten sucked into commenting (something I don't usually do on these huge pro-Democratic Party blogs) because I simply can't restrain myself. I seem to in the minority, and I've been called disgusting and treasonous a time or two, but I've also gotten some support and agreement, for comments like the one below:

[John's suggestion]:"Please tell your Senators to oppose giving amnesty to terrorists who kill American soldiers."

[My response]:
"Oh, this is ridiculous. I will do no such thing. American troops are terrorizing the Iraqi population in an illegal, immoral, unjust and grossly asymmetrical war. Foreign occupying troops are legitimate targets and the Iraqis who fight back are not "terrorists."

Moreover, if Iraq is presumed to have a sovereign and independent government, where the hell do U.S. senators get off trying to dictate that government's policies? Butt out!

If this is the only political issue that Dems feel they can rally round and fight the Republicans on, the party is even further gone than I thought."

This blog and its fans represent one of the few sane corners of the political universe, if you ask me. I kept running over here from AmericaBlog looking for a safe refuge and to see if Eli had some biting commentary on the absurd posturing of some of the Democrats in Congress that Aravosis was so thrilled with.

Eli's point above is, well, THE POINT: This whole debate, this massive tragedy, is about IRAQ, not the United Fucking States of America. And the "liberals" or however you want to describe them of America are as Ameri-centric as any.

And yet if no one challenges their distorted worldview, how will anything change? I don't kid myself that my (increasingly irate) expressions of dissent really changed anyone's mind over there, but you never know...and you have to try. Here's another comment I left there:

"American troops in Iraq are an entirely legitimate target for attack. They are invaders and occupiers. They destroy, murder, torture and terrorize in a war that the U.S. started, for base, not noble, reasons. American special forces engage in black ops that cause more death and chaos. The Iraqi economy is a shambles, its resources ripped off by American contractors. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died, many more have been injured, maimed, orphaned, traumatized. And radicalized. All as a result of the war that Americans wage and fund.

This is not about America, or about how the pathetic Democratic Party can twist the issue to political advantage and score points against the Republicans. This is about IRAQ. In the eyes of most Iraqis, and indeed most of the world, the Americans are not the good guys here. To label Iraqis who take up arms against foreign troops in their country as "terrorists" is a gross and mendacious distortion of the reality. The truth is that the United States is engaging in massive state-sponsored acts of terrorism around the world.

It has 130,000 troops in Iraq, a massive network of bases, a multi-billion dollar heavily fortified Embassy, and at least fourteen PERMANENT military bases under construction. The U.S. Congress refuses to insist on withdrawal, and continues to vote to fund the war. An amendment prohibiting the use of funds for the construction of permanent bases that Congress voted to approve was stripped from the legislation.

It's pretty obvious to all that the United States has absolutely no intention of leaving Iraq voluntarily. Iraqis have every right to fire on American troops as part of an ongoing campaign to force them out. If you don't want them to be targeted and attacked, then GET THEM OUT OF IRAQ."

Whew! You tell 'em! Pretty disgusting picture and completely morally bereft posturing by the liberals in the Democrat Party.

"And the "liberals" or however you want to describe them of America are as Ameri-centric as any."

I socialize and community organize with the Ameri-centric liberal types who get all caught up in the presidential election every 4 years like replacing one George Bush with another, or a little less imperialistic one from the D party, will make some big difference. And they go through this same thinking process decade after decade, things get worse, and duhhh....it's not working! And I have to watch my tongue lest I alienate myself from friends. They don't blog, they don't get news or analysis from the web at all. They pass around funny emails ridiculing Bush like he is the problem and if only we could get rid of him. They get their news from NPR, the corporate newspaper, and TV and think of themselves as well-informed.

So yes, I depend on this blog for some sanity too. I don't have the time or the stomach to do what Jean is doing on the liberal blog(s). But you go and more power to you!

No surprise here. Our government and our people, at least the Davos/HBS/Goldman-Sachs elite, work on the same principle: it's about us (or the US) for the former, about me,me,me for the latter. Lasch was right about the personal narcissism, starting in the 1980s, as the defining quality of the American character. Our empire-building is a collective version of it.
We could be invading Norway and bombing the hell out of Oslo and the boys and girls at Harvard and Berkeley would be battling for interview slots with McKinsey. The streets would be empty. Especially if "American Idol" is on TV.

Aravosis is full of himself, and AmericaBlog should be named ClicheBlog or MindlessBlog: it's a great blog if you want to imagine how Homer Simpson views American politics.

"So love me, love me, love me... I'm a liberal!"

This thread reminded me of Phil Ochs's wonderful "Love me, I'm a liberal." Out of date references but the analysis is spot on. For those who don't know, and I very much doubt there are readers here who don't, check it out. There's a modern version done by Evan Greer, less good, but check it at... (hope this works)

If it doesn't work, just make your way through the website... Evan Greer, near the bottom of his music page.

Cheers.

And I have to watch my tongue lest I alienate myself from friends.

With all due respect to you, but I have to suggest that this seems to be the problem with America. You would rather be polite.

How has it come to be that being impolite is worse than stopping your government from killing innocent people?

Jamie,

I don't have the time (and sometimes not the stomach) for arguing with liberals either really, and I don't do it regularly, but sometimes I can't keep quiet. I've even commented on the right-wing Confederate Yankee blog on the Haditha massacre: http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/a...ives/
179276.php

I'm noborders there, though you could probably easily figure that out yourself. After getting the standard refrain "God bless America and God bless the American military" three times, and the argument that a pregnant woman could be classified as the enemy, and killing Iraqi kids was justified because even "children can throw grenades, count American troops, report American positions" , I gave up. The posters there are the ca. 15% of the population (a/c William Blum's rough estimate) that are completely unreachable, who "would support the outrages even if the government came to their homes, seized their first born, and hauled them away screaming, as long as the government assured them it was essential to fighting terrorism (or communism)."

I wouldn't have the patience for doing what you're doing--socializing and organizing with NPR-type Americans who think getting rid of Bush is the solution to all America's problems (and the world's problems with America). The 2004 Kerry campaign was terrible for the antiwar movement--too many (including some who knew better) threw their activism behind his candidacy out of misguided desperation. And Americans got Bush, and Iraqis got more carnage and suffering, anyway.

Most of my immediate family members consider themselves liberal Democrats. My niece is getting married this summer; I was instructed by my sister to leave my politics at home if I come to the wedding. Two of my other sisters have drinking and drug problems; they were likewise instructed to leave the booze and the drugs at home. So in this "liberal" circle, my politics are apparently considered as toxic and undesirable and embarrassing as alcohol/drug addiction. Nice.

Die for the Elite, I find AmericaBlog useful and informative on many things, and I thought John's recent campaign of calling up Congressional "defenders of marriage" to ask them point-blank about their sexual practices was a brilliant way of exposing their hypocrisy. Moreover, if you just hang out in comfortable places with folks who pretty much share your politics, how is public opinion ever going to evolve? I think you need to shake up the conventional wisdom, challenge the assumptions, do what you can to shape the debate, make people think. And when you do, you might get some surprisingly positive responses.

A slightly different take on who and where. In Iraq, this war should be about the Iraqi's. But here in the US, this illegal war is about Iraq, and not about the criminal behavior of the US. As we have made obvious, our elephantine feet can not improve Iraq. I have no idea what it will take for the US to look at its own behavior, but we need to focus on the US not Iraq.

It is only this blog, and too few others that have any reasonable perception of of just what our behavior is. It seems impossible to penetrate the walls of ignorance, denial and pathology which carapace our population and leadership.

Bush, a child of Mussolini, is more than an archetype of so many things that are wrong with this nation. He is in part its engineer. As little hope as I see with the Kerrys and Clintons, they only dodder into the fascism that Bush races towards.

" 'And I have to watch my tongue lest I alienate myself from friends.; "

"With all due respect to you, but I have to suggest that this seems to be the problem with America. You would rather be polite."

And polite.....unfortunately not one of my highest virtues. I'm working on the "with age comes wisdom" thing. And maybe with wisdom will come better judegment about when and how to express my views.

One cultural phenomenom I noticed when I moved from the east coast, NY area, to the west is that in California activists were much more into being polite and not disagreeing and debating issues. Where I came from, people spoke up with more freedom and less self-censorship. I'm still too east coast for many of the folks I deal with, but have been forced to mellow a bit to be accepted in the west. Wonder if anyone else has noticed this.

Yes, I have observed it, and, coming from hill country of the South (where people are likewise pretty blunt spoken), I have encountered it in some pretty pernicious ways.

Usually, impolite means that you are pointing out flaws in politically and personally expedient decisions that are primarily designed to allow the participants to delude themselves that they are actually doing something important, while avoiding any confrontation with the people responsible for the problem.

Such as: being against the war in Iraq, while going to rallies that dishonestly target Bush and the Republicans as solely responsible for it.

I've also heard this described as the need for "civility". The dynamic in play here is the ability to exploit the need for politeness as a way of providing political emotional gratification without actually doing anything.

The most effective political activist, or anyone who needs to deal with human beings in any way now that I think of it, is to ariculately tell and explain the unvarnished truth as you see it while speaking appropriately to the particular audience, and remaining charming or agreeable enough so as not to alienate or anger those who are persuadable. I don't have that talent, but admire those who do and support them.
