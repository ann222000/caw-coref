===============================================================
Changes to land cover may enhance global warming in Amazon, reduce it
in midlatitudes
===============================================================

New simulations of 21st-century climate show that human-produced
changes in land cover could produce additional warming in the Amazon
region comparable to that caused by greenhouse gases, while
counteracting greenhouse warming by 25% to 50% in some midlatitude
areas. The simulations from the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) show the importance of including land cover in
computer-model depictions of global change. The results will be
published in the December 9 issue of Science.

Lead author Johannes Feddema (University of Kansas) carried out the
modeling work with six coauthors from NCAR while on sabbatical at the
center. The team linked NCAR's Land Surface Model with the global-scale
Parallel Climate Model, developed by scientists at NCAR and the U.S.
Department of Energy under DOE sponsorship. This marks the first time a
simulation of 21st-century warming includes not only interactive ocean
and atmosphere components but also changes in land cover caused by
agriculture, deforestation, and other human activities.

&quot;The choices humans make about future land use could have a significant
impact on regional and seasonal climates,&quot; says Feddema.

Taken together, the impacts of greenhouse gases around the globe should
far outweigh the regional effects of land-cover change, according to
Feddema. However, the regions with extensive agriculture and
deforestation also tend to be highly populated, so the effects of
land-cover change are often focused where people live.

&quot;Compared to global warming, land use is a relatively small influence.
However, there are regions where it's really important,&quot; he says.

To bracket a range of possibilities, the group examined two contrasting
scenarios for greenhouse emissions and land cover put forth by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The more pessimistic
scenario assumed that emissions will increase steadily, while the more
optimistic scenario assumes rapid gains in energy efficiency.

The results for the first scenario show that deforestation adds 2°C
(3.6°F) or more to surface temperature across the Amazon by 2100.
Cooling occurs in the nearby Pacific and Atlantic waters with a
weakening of the large-scale Hadley circulation that drives tropical
and subtropical climate. In turn, moisture penetrates further north and
produces a cooling, moistening influence across the U.S. Southwest
during that region's summer monsoon.

While deforestation acts to warm the tropics by replacing forests with
less productive pasture, converting midlatitude forests and grasses to
cropland tends to act as a cooling influence, because the crops tend to
reflect more sunlight and release more moisture into the air. Feddema
and colleagues found that expanded agriculture tends to counteract
global warming by as much as 50% across parts of North America, Europe,
and Asia. In Canada and Russia, boreal forests add to regional warming
as they spread north over time.

Although the two IPCC scenarios studied agree on the impacts of land
use in some regions, they produce contrasting results in others. The
next step for Feddema and colleagues is to utilize the NCAR-based
Community Climate System Model, which will provide higher-resolution
results. They also hope to incorporate the effects of urban areas on
regional climate.

&quot;Our results suggest that more research efforts should be devoted to
producing viable scenarios of land-cover change in the future,&quot; says
coauthor Linda Mearns, director of the NCAR Institute for the Study of
Society and Environment. &quot;We very much hope that other climate modeling
centers perform experiments similar to ours.&quot;

&quot;The purpose of our project is to include human processes more directly
in global climate models,&quot; adds Feddema. &quot;This is the first step.&quot;

The simulations were supported by the DOE, the National Science
Foundation, and the University of Kansas. NSF is NCAR's primary
