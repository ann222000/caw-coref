Is this what you did to the poor creature, Ms Irene Pepperberg?
Have him worked to death by your research?
8-12 hours a day, every day, of gruelling mental exercise, just to
find out where the limits of avian intelligence exist!  No wonder
Alex died so young.

Both you and Brandeis University should be ashamed of yourselves!

Bird Brain Dies After Years of Research

WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) - Alex, a parrot that could count to six, identify
colors and even express frustration with repetitive scientific trials, has
died after 30 years of helping researchers better understand the avian
brain.

The cause of Alex's death was unknown. The African grey parrot's
average life span is 50 years, Brandeis University scientist Irene
Pepperberg said. Alex was discovered dead in his cage Friday, she said, but
she waited to release the news until this week so grieving researchers could
get over the shock and talk about it.

&quot;It's devastating to lose an individual you've worked with pretty much
every day for 30 years,&quot; Pepperberg told The Boston Globe. &quot;Someone was
working with him eight to 12 hours every day of his life.&quot;

No, he's an ex-parrot. The only reason he dosn't fall off the perch is
because he's nailed to it. Monty P had so much fun with that one.

Liberal Democreeps are like parrots, because they always repeat
the same meaningless slogans over &amp; over.  As Hillary's campaign
picks up more steam, get ready to hear things like, &quot;Isn't it time
for a woman&quot;?    If anyone can see any substance in that statement,
pleas feel free to point it out to the rest of us.

Of course you can fill in the blank with other republican candidates
who scream famnily value and thne to home at night to their THRID
WIFE.

It's interesting that the Mormon is the one with one wife, which
is something Thompson, McCain, Gingrich can't claim.

Or the chicken hawks who scream about how great this war is but
when it came their time to go to war they were no where to be found.

The majority of intelligent thinkers agree with me, they are -
understandably - scared because they can loose tenure, jobs and families
(on false charges) in the US of A, AKA The United Socialist Republic of
