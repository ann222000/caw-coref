Please Support the LPAB and Consortium Appeal
Re: UC Berkeley Extension Laguna St Campus Local Landmark Designation

The Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board (by unanimous vote) and the
San Francisco Preservation Consortium have appealed the Planning
Commission's decision not to landmark the UC Berkeley Extension
Laguna Street Campus (formerly the San Francisco State Teacher's
College) to the Board of Supervisors. The Issues Committee of San
Francisco Architectural Heritage also voted unanimously to support
said appeal.

Hope you can join us this Tuesday at 3:00 pm in asking the Board of
Supervisors to support the LPAB and uphold Article 10 of the
Planning Code by making the National Register-eligible Laguna Street
Campus San Francisco's next Local Landmark.
