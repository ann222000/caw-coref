AT&amp;T has no obligations to stop selling other Smartphones- even Apple

&quot;Cutting back on bandwidth?&quot;  Please.  It's a phone- data isn't
allocated to manufacturers!  The Starbucks deal is a simple cross

iPhone/iPod owners see a Starbucks icon on their phone.  The T-Mobile
connection, while ironic, is a red herring- if Starbucks used
Boingo's network the same deal would've been done.

iPhones, like TyTns and N95s, have WiFi.  Nothing prevents AT&amp;T WiFi
phone owners from buying T-Mo's WiFi &quot;Hotspots&quot; service
($19.99/month.)
It has nothing to do with thecellular service.

Could be right Todd.  If you saw today's news, Comcast cut &quot;Unlimited
Internet&quot; service to their customers who pay for &quot;Unlimited Service&quot; by
doing heavy downloads - i.e. &quot;no connection available&quot; at all!  The HTC TyTn
II runs Windows Mobile 6 and doesn't need to run server based as does the
iPhone and it is supposedly to run on 3.5g so it will be very fast with far
more features like the ability to scan in business cards, and will run GPS
as well. Apple sees the writing and cannot compete with it unless they dump
the iPhone for a newer model that will knock down the HTC.  I doubt if it
will happen as Apple prefers the user to be tied to their service like
sealed-in batteries and no slot for any other memory rather than tying up a
computer or server to make the exchange (HTC got that right as did Nokia).

Unfortunately, as has always been Apple's problem, very little software is
written for it compared to Windows based anything.  Plus, Bill Gates has
backed HTC now so the iPhone is going to have a very short sales run except
to the Apple people who buy into Apple's sales &quot;gimmicks&quot; which are very
good.  HTC makes a lot of manufacture's phones and no doubt learned form
their mistakes.  Now they go it one their own having learned those mistakes.
Just wished it were cheaper than $1000 but that will change as did the
iPhone (I hope!).

Glad I didn't jump on the iPhone bandwagon - and now certainly won't.
There's always something better around the corner.

That's how it works nowadays - there's always something better around
the corner.  If you decide to never buy a tech product because
something better will turn up soon, you'll never buy anything.

My personal strategy is to buy last season's best thing.  That way I
get charged the lower price (prices nearly always go down a while
after first release - though not usually as quickly as what happened
with the iPhone), any &quot;bugs&quot; in the item will have been discovered and
sorted, and I get to own a gadget or whatever that is pretty damn good
- not as good as the &quot;latest thing&quot;, but good nevertheless.

That works especially well for cameras.  You can get a nice one with a
high-quality lens for a low price because it has &quot;only&quot; X megapixels
(like you need that many anyway - 2 megapixels fills a computer screen
plenty well).

True, but at least I wouldn't be the owner of a product that has been
discontinued like Apple's 4gig iPhone.  That has to be one of the shortest
product runs ever at 2 1/2 months before being discontinued!

Soon it will be once you stand in line, it'll be obsolete by the time you
get to the register.

No more Apple's here.  I think I'll wait for a product that has been out at
least 4 months before being discontinued or qualifying for a &quot;credit.&quot;

Since foreign countries have better and even faster goods to market than the
U.S., I doubt if the iPhone will be worth anything overseas against their
current product lines.  Sad really.

yes, but in the Apple world, Apple products are supported far longer
than any other company does. Even Apple's 6 year old iPod is well
supported to this day. You can't say that about Nokia or Moto phones, or
any MP3 player other than Apple. I like the stuff since you get more
value when you buy from them. I don't like crap, so having the better
device and the longer lifetime is important.

You mean... &quot;you've never owned an apple product before&quot;, so are trying
to bluff the readership, nice try, but buzz, you've been caught in a
lie. If you do wait 4 months you run the risk on the other side of
having just bought, but a new model comes out. While I agree Apple's
$100 drop in 70 days is a little fast, it's right in line with the
industry when you think about it.

Well, the other countries don't have the technical resources to build
something on the level of an iPhone, so even 3-4 years from now the
iPhone will still be the top tech product / top cell phone in those 2nd

Just down the street from each other, here, is Best Buy and Circuit City.

If I'm going to buy something from one of them, I'll take a copy of the
price tag to the other for the price match + 10 or 15%.  Then, you take
that receipt to the first store and get THEIR price match + 10 or 15% for
even more discounting....returning the first product you bought without
even opening the package.  It's a handy piece of change on same-priced
items costing hundreds of dollars!  I don't mind playing these stupid
mind games...really.  Best Buy marked the 750GB Western Digital My Book
Essential Edition (USB port only) down to $179.95, the best price I've
ever seen, including the net, for a couple of days.  I played the game
and ended up paying $157 for a really nice 750GB USB external drive that
sells for nearly twice that anywhere else....(c;  Even has 158 GB still
free after a week on my system!

Two days later, the price was $279 for it...and holding.  I think someone
screwed up....TS.

Gee. I have owned Archo's products for years now. At least they were smart

China has the technology and their internet is faster (U.S. is still copper

Doubt it.  With the roll out of 3.5G and whatever else is on the horizon,
the current will need to adjust and the U.S. is no longer a first world
order technological giant.  Restrictions and litigation are to great in the
U.S. It's now overseas countries that are moving ahead.  The cell network in
the U.S. is too slow to change verses other countries.  That is one reason
Nokia who has about 35% of the phone sales overall, fell out of grace with
AT&amp;T as they moved away from the 850 frequency to 900 Mhz.  The N95 didn't
adopt to the older U.S. system.  They had to go back to making Quad-band
phone N95 8gig model to satisfy the FCC for U.S. operation.

The smaller, 2nd world countries as you call them, are in a far better
position to update their entire networks than the U.S. due to the size of
the geography alone.  Finland and Korea can change their entire system out
in weeks compared to the U.S. landmass that would take years - assuming cell
towers are 5-8 miles apart.

All Job's hyped copyrights on the iPhone will stifle growth in the U.S.
market as well.  His money will come from lawsuits on similar products in
the U.S. which other countries can ignore and move on.  Who will it
ultimately hurt?  The consumer.  (Same basic argument for Mp3 music files as
well, but don't get me on that one!).  I expect HTC and LG to become
stronger in the Asian markets and European as well.  Nokia and others,
should they wish to continue sales in the U.S., will need to satisfy our
older network.

&gt; &gt; iPhone will still be the top tech product / top cell phone in those 2nd
&gt; &gt; world countries.

&gt; Doubt it.  With the roll out of 3.5G and whatever else is on the horizon,
&gt; the current will need to adjust and the U.S. is no longer a first world
&gt; order technological giant.  Restrictions and litigation are to great in the
&gt; U.S. It's now overseas countries that are moving ahead.  The cell network in
&gt; the U.S. is too slow to change verses other countries.  That is one reason
&gt; Nokia who has about 35% of the phone sales overall, fell out of grace with
&gt; AT&amp;T as they moved away from the 850 frequency to 900 Mhz.  The N95 didn't
&gt; adopt to the older U.S. system.  They had to go back to making Quad-band
&gt; phone N95 8gig model to satisfy the FCC for U.S. operation.
">

3.5G is still far slower than normal WiFi so I wouldn't need it but
maybe 5-10% of the time. Yes, the US system is screwed up, but not much
Apple can do about that. The europe iPhone will obviously have 3 or 3.5G
we'll know in about a month.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The smaller, 2nd world countries as you call them, are in a far better
&gt; position to update their entire networks than the U.S. due to the size of
&gt; the geography alone.  Finland and Korea can change their entire system out
&gt; in weeks compared to the U.S. landmass that would take years - assuming cell
&gt; towers are 5-8 miles apart.
">

Yes, tiny countries with small populations have an advantage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; All Job's hyped copyrights on the iPhone will stifle growth in the U.S.
&gt; market as well.  His money will come from lawsuits on similar products in
&gt; the U.S. which other countries can ignore and move on.  Who will it
&gt; ultimately hurt?  The consumer.  (Same basic argument for Mp3 music files as
&gt; well, but don't get me on that one!).  I expect HTC and LG to become
&gt; stronger in the Asian markets and European as well.  Nokia and others,
&gt; should they wish to continue sales in the U.S., will need to satisfy our
&gt; older network.
">

But nobody in Europe has the ability to make highly advanced phones such
as the iPhone, so it will quickly become the number 1 smart phone in
europe and remain that way for decades. Apple just knows how to build
products like no other company on the planet. Smaller, faster, lighter,
better battery life, Apple will kill all the european phones in a matter
of a year or so.

Nice talking with you.

Oh sure they will.  I'll bet Nokia is just quaking in their boots.

Think Apple will come up with anything like the Nokia IP2450 security phone?
Highly doubtful.  It's a Nokia-Seimens design. Consumer cost $59,995.00.  Is
it worth it?  Maybe to some business.

The iPhone should be marketed as a mutli-media phone as does Nokia with
their N95.  It certainly isn't a business phone as the HTC TyTn II which
does far more but at a higher cost.  I'd hesitate to the iPhone a
smartphone.  Too &quot;gimicky&quot; an advertsing word for a multi-meida phone -
which it is.

Oh, the ipod has usually scored lower than iRiver, Creative, and Archos in
all audiophile reports.  Go look.

Who says it's &quot;obsolete&quot; just because they're no longer selling it?  4G
is plenty, for many.  For many, it's every bit as good as having the 8G
version.

Do you also cry when your computer becomes &quot;obsolete&quot; because newer and
faster machines are selling for less than what you paid for yours, even
though yours still works fine for the things you want to do?

have outclassed the models available here for as long as I can remember,
we get the junk, and we get it behind schedule.  Then, there is Japan,

Yes, but you are forgetting all that changed on June 29th, now, NO
japanese phone is up to par with the iPhone, it completely wipes out all
