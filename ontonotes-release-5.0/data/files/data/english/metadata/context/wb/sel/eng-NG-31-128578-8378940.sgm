General Obasanjo’s presidency has succeeded in clearing the cobwebs from the eyes of the average Yoruba person. We, as a nation, are now ready to resume debate on our economic and cultural development, a debate that had been effectively suspended for more than three decades. In the interim, we were more than convinced that we absolutely needed a Yoruba person to be at the helms of affairs in Lagos or Abuja. Our economic survival, we thought, was dependent on how much we could be garner from petronaira. And who could farm this to our area but a fellow Yoruba person! Former president Obasanjo’s regime succeeded in debunking such a myth. Hurrah to him!!

In a way, we Yoruba people are now far ahead of the curve in comparison with our fellow travelers in the struggle for economic development, the Igbo people. They too are fighting to have an Igbo person as president. I sincerely pray that they are successful soon.

Our economic resurgence will depend on the following factors:

We, Yoruba people, must quickly abandon the culture of economic dependency as a nation. Our economic survival is in our hands and not in reliance on anyone. Money coming from Abuja only enhances our dependency and entrenches the culture of enslavement.

We must immediately embrace the notion that our development is based on our human factors and our intellectual wherewithal, and not what raw materials we can sell to the white man.

We must make economic decentralization and democratization our policy within our Yoruba nation. This is what we understand best and this is what we have done for centuries before even the coming of the white man. This only means that economic well being must be determined at the community level by the community and for the community.

We must make electricity generation within each of our communities a top priority. Electricity generation is the chief economic engine known to man. Our production of this must never depend on any one. As a matter of fact, the generation of electricity by Akure community must never depend on Ondo community. This is the lifeline of each community and must never be surrendered to friend or foe.

We, Yoruba nation must unite to fight against ECN, NEPA, PHCN or whatever acronym is given to that wealth destroying sinkhole that has been responsible for our enslavement in the last forty years. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. If we are not convinced that no good will ever come out of that organization, let us then determine again to sacrifice the next generation of Yoruba people to an experiment that has failed us for four decades.

We, Yoruba people, must resume our educational supremacy. In this regard, we must extricate our educational well being from the clutches of the national government and do what our venerable Chief Awolowo taught us. This is that education functions best when the community has a stake in it. This was the reason he did not take our schools away from the community. It is within this educational decentralization that we, Yoruba people, can enforce the teaching of Yoruba language and culture to our children. A system that is designed from somewhere else will never put our interest first.

A corollary to number six above is that we must unite in enforcing the teaching of Yoruba language, grammar, culture, religion, history and literature in all our educational institutions, beginning from the primary schools all the way to our tertiary institutions,. The dictum is simple: If it is not taught, it is not known; and if it is not known, it is soon forgotten. English people are adept at speaking English because they are taught English. Of course we, Yoruba people are even more adept at speaking English because we are taught English and posit that we have more at stake in learning English than English people themselves. Remember, ‘fail in English, fail in all’.

We must begin a genuine dialogue mainly at the community level and at the Yoruba national level on ways to woo back our citizens who had fled abroad due to economic deprivation brought mainly by reliance on non-performing Nigerian governments, and catalyzed by NEPA cum PHCN. This means that we must involve these individuals in economic debate within each community. While we are much grateful for the dollars/pound sterling/marks they send home to us, we are more interested in their intellectual capabilities.

We must resume our cultural development first by debunking the myth that a vigorous participation in culture is a recipe for eternal damnation. A situation where, even kings and high chiefs, the keepers of our culture, are now walking away from our culture is not tolerable. It makes us an amorphous nation. Enough said on that issue.

Lastly, we must have a conference and debate rationally what will constitute a viable economic community within our Yoruba nation. Once each economic community is formalized, a rational debate on economic development can begin within each community to the glory of our Yoruba nation

May God help us, Amen.

Dear Dr. Fakinlede,

Thank you very much for the ten factors you have given below. They
are are straight to the point and I hope that we the Yoruba consider
them seriously. They represent the position that various Yoruba
organizations in the Diaspora like Egbe Omo Yoruba (North America)
and Egbe Omo Yoruba (Europe) have endorsed. Yoruba organizations at
nome will not have any problem with these points either. The earlier
we get down to business, the better.

However, I do not agree with your very first paragraph. The 1999
elections showed that the Yoruba did not want just any Yoruba to lead
Nigeria; they wanted somebody who they could trust to to lead the
country according to what they perceived as the Yoruba values of
public-spiritedness, supine intelligence, and personal and political
integrity. They were then asked to choose between Chjef Obasanjo and
Chief Falae,both of whom are identified as Yoruba. They did not
choose the former. As for the 2003 elections. the results are still
being disputed by the Yoruba at home. Hence we have no data to
support the position that the Yoruba wanted just any Yoruba in
office. I claim that we have always known better than that.

Best regards,

Adeniran Adeboye
