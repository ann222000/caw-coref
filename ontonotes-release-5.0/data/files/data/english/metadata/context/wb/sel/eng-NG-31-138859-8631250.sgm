Know The Reasons Why Employee Hate Their Managers And Quit
An Article by Jazzy

Do you know why employees leave the company? Even with good salary and compensation? Listen up employers and managers. Bruce L. Katcher and Adam Synder published 30 Reasons Employees Hate Their Managers - What Your People May Be Thinking and What You Can Do About It.

Being an employee and an employer myself, I will attest that these 30 reasons mentioned in the book are all true but I will only highlight some of them here.

In chapter 4, the title is, &quot;Nobody Appreciates My Hard Work&quot;. Every employee should feel appreciated in small or big things they have done. Who in the world does not want to be appreciated anyway? In work, home, and even team play, people are looking for to be acknowledged. You would not imagine the impact to them even simple note like, &quot;Nice design colors&quot;, &quot;Great job mom&quot;, &quot;Nice post&quot;(for bloggers) or &quot;That is a nice pass&quot; (if you are playing basketball.) Just be careful though to sound like you are faking it. They will know it too. Believe me.

&quot;Management Does not Listen To Employees&quot;. What is the feeling of being ignored? How can employees trust the judgment of management when their good suggestions are ignored?

&quot;There Are Too Many Damn Meetings&quot;. This is something I really, really, hate. Many managers thought that activity means productivity and having many meetings means clear direction. I tell you that people usually wander especially if it is a long one.

&quot;It is Just Not Right that We All Receive the Same Pay&quot;. I worked with company that the salary is based on level. If we are on the same level means we have same pay. If you work harder and I slack most of the time, don't you think it is unfair? One reason why companies do this is they are lazy to accurately measure performance.

Overall, I think lack of leadership skills is the root cause of this. There is so many people in senior level position does not know how to lead.

You Manage Things and You Lead People.

What's your take on this?
