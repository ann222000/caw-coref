here I am again, but hopefully with something that's a bit more tasteful
- well, maybe a LOT more tasteful - than my last instrumental :)

I'd been practising this riff for &quot;Gutbucket&quot; for about a year - and
been playing it a lot since getting my Squier Telecaster Custom II back
in June. But I'd never been able to get it arranged properly until now.
That's when I found a battered old nylon-string guitar in the hostel I
was staying in Montreal - and an arrangement came up one night when I
was a bit bummed.

This also happily coincided with my recent purchase of Native
Instruments' Guitar Rig 2 amp emulation software - and let me tell you,
this is something else regarding its quality and number of very useful
features. I managed to get pretty swampy, stoked, and firebreathing with
the various patches I tried with the Tele, and the riff turned into an
interesting twangfest.

All Guitars: Squier Telecaster Custom II through Guitar Rig 2
bass: Peavey Millennium BXP through Johnson J-Station
drums: Groove Agent 2

do check it out, and as usual tell me what you think!

sorry, no vocals this time, so your ears are spared yet again :)

BONUS! It was too hot to go out today, and I had a day off, so I whipped
up a YouTube video of me playing the tune by myself (no accompaniment)
on my Peavey Falcon. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=584Ou-0LXzU

a special challenge to Keith Adams: try to listen to the whole tune this
time instead of just 23 seconds before shooting your mouth off. Also, I
dare you not to come up with lyrics :)

Good work Dan, I really like the riff.  Very memorable &amp; hooky.  The
only thing I would've done differently is use a lower reverb rate,
that's about it.

What are you using for drums?

Good stuff Dan - I like it better than your other &quot;less tasteful&quot;
stuff. It's got a kinda &quot;secret agent&quot; feel about it. I agree with the
other poster who thought the reverb was a bit thick on it though.

Oh, ok. well in that case.........
Actually I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed the starting hook and the
consequent bass roll.
Putting lyrics to it would be a challenge, without the proper image to
describe but it fits into that catchy genre that transends funk, blues and
oter styles.
IMHO of course.
The only thing I would change is replacing the video with a flat bellied
club Kat doing her thing up in the lights.. (much more appealing)

&gt; do check it out, and as usual tell me what you think!

&gt; sorry, no vocals this time, so your ears are spared yet again :)

&gt; BONUS! It was too hot to go out today, and I had a day off, so I whipped
&gt; up a YouTube video of me playing the tune by myself (no accompaniment)
&gt; on my Peavey Falcon. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=584Ou-0LXzU

&gt; a special challenge to Keith Adams: try to listen to the whole tune this
&gt; time instead of just 23 seconds before shooting your mouth off. Also, I
&gt; dare you not to come up with lyrics :)

Nice groove. A little overprocessed for me in the tone department, but the
playing is in there.

thanks. Now that I've had a few days to think about it, perhaps that
main riff is too processed. At least with Guitar Rig I can go back and
re-amp the parts again. Maybe I'll try that.....

Dan, I notice that when I have a fancy gadget with a lot of capabilities
that I feel like I am wasting my money if I don't use them all. For that
reason, my lack of discipline, I scaled back my rig and just use the basics.
I went from a rack of crap to a guitar, a wah, envelope filter, and an old
analog delay and my amp. Minimalist yes, but it keeps me in my zone.

But your music is more intricate than mine and often times what you use
enhances what you play (Yes, I've listened to a bunch of your music). I
think you have a better feel for what effect is needed in a given situation
than I do. I'm more of an armchair quarterback. I can give you my opinion,
but it does not mean I could do it any better. I guess what I'm saying is
don't change it based on my opinion. This is art, not a democracy. No one
can express Dan Dreibelbis any better than you can. Your music is good,
interesting, and well-done. Thanks for sharing.

&gt; Oh, ok. well in that case.........
&gt; Actually I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed the starting hook and the
&gt; consequent bass roll.
&gt; Putting lyrics to it would be a challenge, without the proper image to
&gt; describe but it fits into that catchy genre that transends funk, blues and
&gt; oter styles.
&gt; IMHO of course.
&gt; The only thing I would change is replacing the video with a flat bellied
&gt; club Kat doing her thing up in the lights.. (much more appealing)

Thanks for the encouragement and the kind words.

These days I have more of a flat stomach. But since I'm out to
entertain and not nauseate, I'll keep the shirt on :)
