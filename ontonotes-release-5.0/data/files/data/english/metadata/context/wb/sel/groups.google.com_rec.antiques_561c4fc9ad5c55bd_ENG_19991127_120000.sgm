Unionists back peace deal

David Trimble wins backing for Mitchell
proposals

The Ulster Unionist Council has backed the
Mitchell peace deal which should see the
setting up of a devolved, power-sharing
government for Northern Ireland within
days.

The votes in favour of the deal were 480
to 349 against.

The historic vote by the 858 delegates to
the party's ruling council is also an
endorsement of Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble's position.

Council delegates were asked by David
Trimble to back him until February when
they are expected to make a final decision
on whether to continue support for the
devolution deal.

The 'yes' vote heralds the
beginning of a new era in
Northern Ireland's history.

The procedures for forming
a power-sharing executive,
the first in a generation, are
due to be triggered on
Monday.

As the unionist delegates were voting it
was learned that the Ulster Unionist MP
William Thompson is to resign from the
party on Tuesday.

Mr Thompson has been a prominent
campaigner against the Mitchell deal.

The breakthrough in the stalled peace
process came after a meeting of the
council in the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on
Saturday where David Trimble was
greeted with applause by the delegates.

The council voted to support the
proposals designed to break the deadlock
over the stalled peace process put
forward by former US senator George
Mitchell after his review of progress of the
Good Friday Agreement.

A smiling Mr Trimble was greeted by both
supporters and opponents of the deal as
he arrived on Saturday morning.

Speaking on his way into the meeting, Mr
Trimble said Northern Ireland could have
confidence in the Unionist delegates.

He said: &quot;I am quite content to leave
these matters to the good sense and
judgement of the delegates of the Ulster
Unionist council.&quot;

Before the meeting,
the Ulster Unionist
deputy leader, John
Taylor, confirmed to
the BBC that he
would support Mr
Trimble.

A fortnight ago he
said there was
nothing new in the
Mitchell Proposals
but Mr Taylor said
he had since
received a number of private assurances.

The proposals involve setting up the
delayed power-sharing government,
followed the same day by a statement
from the IRA to say it has appointed a
representative to the international
decommissioning body headed by General
John de Chastelain.

The decommissioning body was set up
under the terms of the Good Friday
Agreement and its role is to oversee the
decommissioning and distruction of
terrorists weapons.

Ronnie,
I wish you all peace in your end to the violence , with respect for all your
traditions of Northern Ireland. I hope the people imprisoned for their
political beliefs will be pardoned and returned to their families.

"/> Hi Ronnie, I heard Trimble interviewed on our CBC radio about two weeks
ago, at the time he didn't sound very optimistic. He said at the time it
was all up to the IRA to turn in their weapons before any more progress
could be made and was worried that the vote would go against him. I hope
it all goes well, Ireland has seen enough suffering in it's history.

Bared my soul to the crowd eh but oh what the cost
Most of them laughed out loud like nothing's been lost
There were hypocrites and parasites and people that drain
Tell me why must I always explain

Why, why must I always explain
Over and over, over again
It's just a job you know and it's no sweet lorraine
Tell me why must I always explain

Well I get up in the morning and I get my brief
I go out and stare at the world in complete disbelief
It's not righteous indignation that makes me complain
It's the fact that I always have to explain

I can't be everywhere at once, there's always somebody to see
And I never turned out to be the person that you wanted me to be
And I tell you who I am, time and time and time again
Tell me why must I always explain

Well it's out on the highway and it's on with the show
Always telling people things they're too lazy to know
It can make you crazy, yeah it can drive you insane
Tell me why must I always explain.

the first or maybe favorite fat lady he thought of, Rosanne. Had nothing to do
with the baseball incident. The entire thread was about the GFA in Ireland.
