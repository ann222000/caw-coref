Elizabeth: The Golden Age
By Roger Ebert
/ / / October 12, 2007
.
Cast &amp; Credits
Elizabeth I: Cate Blanchett
Sir Francis Walsingham: Geoffrey Rush
Sir Walter Raleigh: Clive Owen
Mary, Queen of Scots: Samantha Morton
Robert Reston: Rhys Ifans
Elizabeth Throckmorton: Abbie Cornish
Philip II: Jordi Molla
.
&lt;&lt;&quot;Elizabeth, the Golden Age&quot; is weighed down by its splendor. There are
scenes where the costumes are so sumptuous, the sets so vast, the music
so insistent, that we lose sight of the humans behind the dazzle of the
production. Unlike &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998) by the same director, Shekhar
Kapur, this film rides low in the water, its cargo of opulence too much
to carry.
.
That's despite the return of the remarkable Cate Blanchett in the title
role. Who else would be so tall, regal, assured and convincing that
these surroundings would not diminish her? We believe she is a queen. We
simply cannot care enough about this queen. That Blanchett could appear
in the same Toronto Film Festival playing Elizabeth and Bob Dylan, both
splendidly, is a wonder of acting. But the film's screenplay, by Michael
Hirst and William Nicholson, places her in the center of history that is
baldly simplified, shamelessly altered, and pumped up with romance and
action.
.
We see her kingdom threatened by two Catholics, Mary, Queen of Scots
(Samantha Morton) who stood next in line to the throne, and Philip II of
Spain (Jordi Molla), who was building a great armada to invade England.
Elizabeth's treasury is depleted, her resources strained, her attention
diverted by the arrival in her court of the dashing Sir Walter Raleigh
(Clive Owen). He has just returned from the New Land with two gifts: the
territory of Virginia, which he has named after her in honor of her
virginity, and tobacco, which she smokes with great delight. Elizabeth
was indeed by all accounts a virgin, but in 1585, when the story is set,
she would have been over 50 and her virginity more or less settled. The
film sidesteps the age issue by making her look young, sensuous and
fragrant, and yearning for a man such as Raleigh.
.
This Sir Walter, he is a paragon. He would have been 32 in 1585. Despite
his shabby attire and rough-hewn manners, he uses brash confidence to
rise in Elizabeth's esteem and becomes her trusted adviser and a
mastermind of the British military strategy. The film deals with the
famous 1588 defeat of the Armada with Raleigh at its center, commanding
ships to be set afire and aimed to ram the Spanish vessels. He swings
from ropes, brandishes his sword, saves himself by plunging into the
sea, and in general proves himself a master swashbuckler, especially
since history teaches us that the real Raleigh was ashore the whole time
and played no role in the battles.
.
In the court, he is also a swordsman, seducing and impregnating
Elizabeth's favorite lady-in-waiting, Elizabeth Throckmorton (Abbie
Cornish). When Elizabeth hears this news, Blanchett rises to full fury
in an awesome example of regal jealousy. She desired Raleigh for
herself, of course, although there is no evidence that, in life, she had
such feelings for him.
.
Some of the film's best scenes involve Mary, played by Samantha Morton
as a heroic and devout woman who goes to the executioner's ax with
dismay but royal composure. Elizabeth's own crisis of conscience over
Mary's death is also well played, but the film is far more interested in
romantic intrigue and sea battles. I think it undervalues the ability of
audiences to get involved in true historical drama, instead of recycled
action cliches.
.
The costumes and settings are nearly overwhelming. Reviewing the earlier
film, I suggested that Shekhar Kapur was perhaps influenced by the rich
colors and tapestries of his native India. Here he seems carried away by
them. There are scenes where the elaborate lace on Elizabeth's costume
is so detailed and flawless that we don't think about the character, we
wonder how long Blanchett must have had to stand there while holding the
pose and not ruffling anything.
.
Can there be a third Elizabeth film? Of course there can. She lived
until 1603, and some of her greatest glories were ahead of her.
Shakespeare was active in London from the 1580s, although it was with
Elizabeth's successor, James I, that his company enjoyed its great royal
favor. No matter. With the same cavalier attitude to history as this
second film, we could be talking about &quot;Elizabeth and Shakespeare in
Love.&quot;&gt;&gt;

I question the 1580s reference (as we know of none) and the idea that
LCM was not a royal troupe enjoying all such favor.

1580's is only an intelligent inference based on the fact that Greene
was complaining of the uncomfortable presence of the non-university
educated &quot;shake-scene&quot; stepping on his and others' toes in the early
1590's. Whatever career projection you choose based on Greene, it has
Shakespeare writing and acting in London in the 1580's.

I just got back from seeing this. Here's the plot:

Osama bin Laden is plotting to overthrow Queen Elizabeth, whose only
desire is to make sure her people enjoy freedom of religion. Errol
Flynn comes to court with gifts, and tells her he wants to start a
colony in Virginia, a place in the New World which he has named for
her. Torquemada, who works for Elizabeth, is trying to discover what
her evil stepsister, Mary, is up to. Elizabeth consults John Dee to
have her fortune told. A crazed religious nut, Francis Throckmorton,
bursts in on Elizabeth while she is at prayer and fires a pistol
directly at her heart, but the gun was not loaded with a bullet, so he
is tortured by Torquemada, who then talks Elizabeth into having Mary
beheaded. Meanwhile, Errol Flynn has fallen in love with a lady-in-
waiting, and he impregnates her, but does the right thing and they get
married. When Elizabeth finds out, she has Errol thrown in the Tower.
But Osama bin Laden sends a fleet of Spanish ships to invade England,
and Elizabeth frees all the prisoners to fight for England, including
Errol. She dresses up as Joan of Arc and gives the troops a big talk,
saying that she will either be with them in heaven or victorious on
the field. Errol commands the British fleet and rams all the Spanish
ships with fire ships and saves the country. Torquemada then dies in
bed, attended by Elizabeth. He and his lady-in-waiting have a baby,
and Auntie Elizabeth drops in to give the baby a blessing and ask him
if he's still interested in establishing a colony in America. The End.

Next up: Errol Flynn sails to America with Benjamin Franklin, Geroge
Washington and Nathan Hale, and together they fight the Civel war and
end slavery forever.

I would recommend that anyone who wants to see a good movie skip this
one and see Michael Clayton instead. I saw that one last night and it
is excellent.

'SARTOR RESARTUS ', which is considered Carlyle's masterpiece, is one
of the oddest books ever written, supposedly part book review and part
biography. The writer said that he patched it together from another
book, 'The History of Clothes, Their Origin and Influence', and
from the life of its supposed author, Herr Diogenes Teufelsdröckh.
.
.       The Latin title means &quot;the *TAILOR* patched.&quot;
.
Both the German professor &amp; his book existed only in Carlyle's
imagination. But in the professor's name he poured out his own
soul. Teufelsdröckh's spiritual struggles, loves, and hates
were Carlyle's own. The book is written in a rhapsodic,
broken style that has since been called &quot;Carlylese.&quot;
.
Thomas Carlyle, the eldest son of a Scottish peasant family,
was born in the lowland village of Ecclefechan on Dec. 4, 1795.
.
In 1834 the Carlyles moved to London, where they spent their remaining
years. The following year 'SARTOR RESARTUS ' was published in Boston,
Mass. Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of Carlyle's earliest disciples, had
the
book published in America because no British book publisher would
accept it.

SARTOR RESARTUS  - Thomas Carlyle

&lt;&lt;&quot;If aught in the history of the world's blindness could surprise us,
here might we indeed pause and wonder. An idea has gone abroad,
and fixed itself down into a wide-spreading rooted error, that
*TAILORS*
are a distinct species in Physiology, not Men, but fractional Parts of
a Man. Call any one a _Schneider_ (Cutter, *TAILOR* ), is it not, in
our dislocated, *HOODWINKed* , and indeed delirious condition of
Society, equivalent to defying his perpetual fellest enmity? The
epithet
_schneidermassig_ (*TAILOR-like* ) betokens an otherwise
unapproachable
degree of pusillanimity; we introduce a _ *TAILOR's-Melancholy* _,
more opprobrious than any Leprosy, into our Books of Medicine;
and fable I know not what of his generating it by living on CABBAGE.
Why should I speak of Hans Sachs (himself a Shoemaker, or kind
of *Leather-TAILOR*), with his _Schneider mit dem Panier_?
.
Why of Shakspeare, in his _Taming of the Shrew_, and elsewhere?
.
Does it not stand on record that the English Queen Elizabeth,
receiving a deputation of *Eighteen TAILORS* , addressed them
with a 'Good morning, gentlemen both!' Did not the same virago
boast that she had a Cavalry Regiment, whereof neither horse nor
man could be injured; her Regiment, namely, of *TAILORS* on Mares?
.
Thus everywhere is the falsehood taken for granted,
.   and acted on as an indisputable fact.&gt;&gt;
