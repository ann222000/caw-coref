Excerpts from
http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/jul2007/pi20070713_19008...

RadioShack's ongoing cuts to its workforce and advertising costs will
lead to disappointing comparable-store sales and lower profits for the
foreseeable future. Reduced commissions and benefit packages are also
hurting employee morale.

Even before being shut out of the iPhone market, RadioShack had been
losing significant market share in wireless products to carriers and
big-box stores.

RadioShack needed to slash costs just to keep pace with falling sales,
but most of the cost reductions to date have centered on
brand-building efforts that might have expanded the customer base. Any
new cuts from now will probably eat into advertising that drives store
traffic and promotional events, and that's sure to hurt sales going
forward.

What RadioShack appears to be missing is any sense of a longer-term
strategy toward bringing in new merchandise and finding ways to
generate higher margins.

Having gone through numerous boom-bust cycles, the retailer is sorely
in need of a new hot product now that wireless and satellite radio on
on the decline. The GPS navigation device has done very well, but the
market isn't large enough to offset slowing sales in other categories.

Shrug. Economic Darwinism in action. RS wrote off their original core
market, the electronic hobbyist, years ago. They tried to go mainstream,
with mall locations, too many locations, Â and major-media advertising, vs.
the 2nd-tier strip centers and mailed flyers and catalogs that built the
company. Doubt I go in the local RS more than once or twice a year anymore-
they simply no longer carry much that I need, or can't find cheaper
elsewhere. Lousy selection, high prices, untrained staff-&gt; lower sales -&gt;
the downward spiral begins. I do feel sorry for the career employees, and
the kids that had an interest in electronics that no longer have entry-level
jobs to start their careers. And it is a pain to have to buy parts online,
or take off work to go to an actual industrial supply. But RS as a
corporation did it to themselves- they are now little more than a cell phone
and techno-toy store, and others (real world and online) do that better and
cheaper. I give them another few years before they go online-only, or go
belly-up entirely. IIRC, a major part of their business is now the
non-RS-labeled cell phone kiosk stands they run in malls and other stores
like Sam' Club.

You'd be surly too if the operation you are working in is sinking beneath the waves.

Even the stupidest monkey should notice that is happening.

Its hardly surprising that they end up with the dregs in a 4.x% unemployment market.

Little surprise, really. Â They've abandoned their base.
The last time I set foot inside a RS was in 1994, when a
friend was employed with them. Â I was willing to pay a bit more to
help a friend.
Since I can find everything I might buy at RS cheaper
elsewhere, I see no reason to shop there. Â I guess others are of the
same mind.

i went in one recently to buy a few electronic parts, so
there's ~$10 in revenue. Â But that was the first time in
years... i once ran in one to see about a mobile phone car
charger, but they had it priced at something like 3 times
what i knew it it cost at somewhere like Wal-Mart. Â I was
in a hurry, but i'm never in that much of a hurry, so i
went to WM.

you never see anyone in one, they're always empty. Â I've
often wondered how they stay open. Â I agree, there's not
much in them of any interest to anyone I know.

used to be a lot of fun back when they started to sell
computers, listening to them make up answers as they went
along. Â Then they moved the walls of parts into that stack
of oversize acro mills pull out bins, that you couldn't see
into, and the part you needed was either not in it's
assigned bin or sold out a few days after the stack was put
in place a year ago. Â I did get a good deal on x-10 modules
when they closed out the home automation. Â 5 years ago I
stopped at one looking for simple 4 inch radio speaker and I
was shown their full speaker collection. Â A few 6 1/2&quot; and
6&quot;x9&quot; three way automotive speakers and half a dozen 10&quot; and
12&quot; woofer boxes for trunk mounting ;-) Â Haven't been back
since.

Ironically Fry's had the 4&quot; speakers for about $2. Â Most
amazing is, it was part of their full collection of PHILMORE
parts. Â I have Philmore stuff all over the place, from the
60s/70s, exceeded only by Lafayette Radio parts ;-) Â I
didn't know Philmore was still in existence! Â I'm making up
for lost time, I now have bins of their connectors,
adapters, and switches. Â As well as the 4&quot;, 5&quot;, 6&quot;, and 8&quot;
speakers.

The local store used to keep all that stuff in bins behind the
counter. Â Went back there to look thru it and the manager screamed at
me, &quot;NOBODY goes behind my counter!&quot; Â So I no longer went behind his
counter, which was easy because I no longer went thru his front
door...

Philmore is still around big-time.

See
&quot; http://www.minute-man.com/acatalog/Online_Catalog_Philmore_and_Calrad... &quot;
for the most of the Philmore line.

I saw some Lafayette and Olson stuff at the local electronics flea
market. Too bad there is no longer any chains that sell components like
those stores. Fry's doesn't pay much attention to the few aisles they
have that still sell components. I get most of that kind of stuff from
&quot; http://allelectronics.com/ &quot;, they are very good.
