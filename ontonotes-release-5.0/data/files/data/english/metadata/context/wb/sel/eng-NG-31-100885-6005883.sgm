Does anybody know if Tena do naughty small male lop size pants?  Not
wishing to cause anybunny embarassement, but..... guess who has
suddenly decided he needs to mark territory?  And he'd been so good
with his tray before.  Stinky boy!!!!

What I know I OUGHT to do in such a situation is to

1) put an extra litter tray where he is doing it - done that, fingers
crossed that one will work

2) pick him up as soon as I see him squat and move him to the preferred
tray - no chance I'm afraid.  He hates to be picked up and gallops off
at a rate of many mph.  If I do manage to pick him up he often gets
very distressed so I'm trying to do it only in situations that have a
good outcome like transporting him a very short distance to something
nice to eat, in order to help him understand it's a GOOD thing to be
picked up by THAT ****** HUMAN.  Picking up is a long-term project.

3) steam cleanining the marked areas to kill off bacteria and therefore
smell, and then spraying them with Febreze or similar to make them into
something I want to smell

4) dunno - any help available?

Ros, the lovely Cinnamon and the Outlaw.

is he fixed?...

I noticed that within a week of both my buns being fixed, they both stopped
spraying entirely... the difference was amazing...

and I do keep a litterbox available outside the cage...

also you could put up an indoor penlike fence so the bun only has limited
room, but still enough to stretch his legs and play a bit... you can put
down a cheapo plastic tablecloth like you get for xmas or something to keep
your carpets a bit cleaner inside the fenced area with a litterbox... keep
an eye on him and until he starts to use the litterbox regularily, don't let
him run about...

I also noticed taht with my buns, If I leave a towel on the floor, they will
prefer to pee on that than anything else... found that out quickly... *towel
was left on the floor by my son... yeesh... dern teenagers*

Yes, he was already neutered when I got him from the shelter.  (and
both I and the vet have checked to be sure there are no 'baubles'
hiding away there!)

I think that part of the problem is that he's come into Cinnamon's
territory, which has to smell of her.  (Even though I don't notice it).
He keeps trying to hump her to prove he's the boss - she either claims
a headache and runs off with him in pursuit - the exercise is doing her
a lot of good! - or else continues eating, grooming, whatever and takes
no notice of his attempts at all which can't do much for his male ego.

I don't cage them.  There is a hutch they can go into if they want to,
and sometimes they do, but not often.  Its door is always open.
There's one litter tray near that with blankets in between, all set on
a tiled floor which is easy to clean.  Cinnamon uses the tray, as he
does most of the time, but sometimes the blankets - which I lift and
wash straight away.  Further along they have more blankets and their
feed dishes, water hay, all of which can be moved into the lobby where
the hutch is if I do need to shut them in using the dog gate.  Again,
those blankets are regularly washed, but they tend not to get marked
anyway.

It's in the living room that there is a problem.  That's carpeted.
There are bunny blankets in front of the fire and another litter tray
by the door on waterproof front door mats that are washable.

Cinnamon is a good girl and uses the trays.

Nutmeg made a brilliant start but in the past 2 weeks has begun to mark
in the living room.  Now remember that is really the only space that I
can sit down with the bunnies and we are companions - I don't want to
shut them away in the kitchen/lobby (where there is NO space for me to
sit - tiny area)

He began peeing on the marble hearth and it was running down onto the
carpet.  He's stopped that since I steam cleaned it all.  Then he began
excavating both litter trays all over the floor - the living room one
most often - making a horrible mess of the doormats, and he was peeing
on the excavated litter instead of in what was still in the tray. I
kept putting the litter back and washing the mats and suddenly he just
stopped that trick.

HIs latest venture is the little fur fabric catbeds that they love to
lie in.  I discovered where the nasty niff was coming from yesterday
and put it in the washer.  As soon as it was dried I put it back down
and he peed on it again right away.  It went back into the washer and
he peed on one of the other blankets which is right now in the washer.

If I get some sort of cage and confine them, not only will it be
contrary to the type of life I'm trying to give them, and that all my
other rabbits have been fine with, but also it would take up a huge
chunk of my living room floor...It's only 12 x 12 feet and contains the
settee and armchair, folding dining table and folding chairs, (One open
so I can work at the computer and one leaf of the table out), built in
cupboard in one corner containing the gas meter with the TV on top, a
bookcase, the front door opeining into it, the kitchen door at the
other side and the staircase going out of it.  (table and chairs and
bookcase under stairs).  I've put an extra litter tray now where he has
started to pee, so that's another obstacle.  It is pretty short of
floorspace as it is, I really couldn't cope with less.  So I'm afraid
for those reasons a cage is out.

I'll put some plastic sheeting under the blankets to stop it
penetrating into the carpet, but just wish he'd give up peeing where he
doesn't need to.

I wonder if the problem has to do with the fact that I bought new
litter trays.  He had begun to pee over the back of the old ones
(accidentally I'm sure) so I got 2 high-backed ones and the problem
began when I did the changeover.  I filled them with the litter from
the old trays so it had the right scent - it had been cleaned that
morning with the wet stuff and the poos taken out but some of the
unsoiled old stuff returned.  The new trays are smaller and square
instead of the rectangular cat trays.  It seems very co-incidental that
what wasn't a problem before is now.  It's one of the old trays that
I've put where he's marking and he is using it happily - just hope his
aim is improved!  I really don't want to change back to the old trays
as he had managed to make a real mess with his poor aim, and the normal
place the tray has to stand is at the end of my settee - I don't want
that sprayed with bunny pee too.

Ah well - I'll keep trying.....

The confinement of a fenced area would mainly be temporary until you can
trust him to use the litter all the time...

how much smaller are the new litterboxes?  I know when nibs is out and about
he is more likely to use a larger box rather than the smaller one I have for
my dwarfs...

Bambi will become frusterated in her cage and start to dig dig dig into the
litterbox as well with stuff flying hethernether everywhere...

He could also be marking his territory against the cats more than the other
bun... I never let nibs into my bedroom or my sons bedroom as thats where my
dog likes to lay down most of the time and he has gone and marked up the
beds... *he also stalks the dog*  but nibs does NOT like the dog at all...
but we are slowly working on that...

how well does the bun and cats get along?  it might be those two species you
have to get together...

I was always told that a mixture of half vinegar half water was the best to
remove any urine oder, even that oder WE cannot smell, but they can.  You
might want to try that instead of dragging out a steam cleaner each time.
It also works wonders in cleaning litterboxes.

I don't have cats.  Next door has a new kitten but he's never been in
here yet.  There's just the 2 varmints and me.

No I don't let them into the bedroom either.  When Mr H d'Bun was alive
the only place he would territory-mark was my bed.......

Cinnamon has been in and she was an angel.  Just lay down beside me and
went to sleep, but those boys have to be in charge, don't they?

He's just gone into the kitchen to get his breakfast and peed on the
clean blankets straight away.  I can smell it from here.

We're off to the vet this morning for vaccinations.  I'm going to get
him checked again to make absolutely certain that the castration has
been completely successful and their's not a small appendage still
lurking in the fur that I can't see or feel......

&gt; &gt; stopped that trick.

&gt; &gt; HIs latest venture is the little fur fabric catbeds that they love to
&gt; &gt; lie in.  I discovered where the nasty niff was coming from yesterday
&gt; &gt; and put it in the washer.  As soon as it was dried I put it back down
&gt; &gt; and he peed on it again right away.  It went back into the washer and
&gt; &gt; he peed on one of the other blankets which is right now in the washer.

&gt; &gt; If I get some sort of cage and confine them, not only will it be
&gt; &gt; contrary to the type of life I'm trying to give them, and that all my
&gt; &gt; other rabbits have been fine with, but also it would take up a huge
&gt; &gt; chunk of my living room floor...It's only 12 x 12 feet and contains the
&gt; &gt; settee and armchair, folding dining table and folding chairs, (One open
&gt; &gt; so I can work at the computer and one leaf of the table out), built in
&gt; &gt; cupboard in one corner containing the gas meter with the TV on top, a
&gt; &gt; bookcase, the front door opeining into it, the kitchen door at the
&gt; &gt; other side and the staircase going out of it.  (table and chairs and
&gt; &gt; bookcase under stairs).  I've put an extra litter tray now where he has
&gt; &gt; started to pee, so that's another obstacle.  It is pretty short of
&gt; &gt; floorspace as it is, I really couldn't cope with less.  So I'm afraid
&gt; &gt; for those reasons a cage is out.

&gt; &gt; I'll put some plastic sheeting under the blankets to stop it
&gt; &gt; penetrating into the carpet, but just wish he'd give up peeing where he
&gt; &gt; doesn't need to.

&gt; &gt; I wonder if the problem has to do with the fact that I bought new
&gt; &gt; litter trays.  He had begun to pee over the back of the old ones
&gt; &gt; (accidentally I'm sure) so I got 2 high-backed ones and the problem
&gt; &gt; began when I did the changeover.  I filled them with the litter from
&gt; &gt; the old trays so it had the right scent - it had been cleaned that
&gt; &gt; morning with the wet stuff and the poos taken out but some of the
&gt; &gt; unsoiled old stuff returned.  The new trays are smaller and square
&gt; &gt; instead of the rectangular cat trays.  It seems very co-incidental that
&gt; &gt; what wasn't a problem before is now.  It's one of the old trays that
&gt; &gt; I've put where he's marking and he is using it happily - just hope his
&gt; &gt; aim is improved!  I really don't want to change back to the old trays
&gt; &gt; as he had managed to make a real mess with his poor aim, and the normal
&gt; &gt; place the tray has to stand is at the end of my settee - I don't want
&gt; &gt; that sprayed with bunny pee too.

&gt; &gt; Ah well - I'll keep trying.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; also you could put up an indoor penlike fence so the bun only has

&gt; keep

Thanks for the tip.  I'll give that a try.

Really the steam cleaner is no problem, being one of those small
portable ones, but mighty powerful.  It just lives in the cupboard with
the vacuum cleaner so takes a couple of minutes to get set up from
finding the results of his sinful behaviour.

Back from the vet

2 of the vets gave him a thorough search - he was most annoyed - and
there definitely are no baubles lurking in his abdomen.  I must say I'm
very pleased about that because that would be a major op for him and
they'd have to come out as they're far more likely to get malignant
tumours up in there, aren't they?

Sorry I forgot earlier your comment about the size of the litter trays.
In area they're probably about the same size as the old ones.  The old
trays were rectangular and these are square but it just seems so
strange that this marking has only begun since we got them.

He did no marking through the night - miraculous and the place smelled
quite fresh when I came downstairs, but since then he's gone completely
OTT, so I wonder if he's challenging me?

He likes me to hand feed him and will tolerate having his face
scratched and rubbed now for a short time as long as I don't try to
lift him - that's progress.  But he doesn't love me like Cinnamon does.
When I lie on the floor to play with her and stroke/scratch her he
stays pretty much away from my hands, but climbs all over me and sniffs
me.  I stay still and talk gently to both of them.  I know I'll get
there with him, but it is going to take some significant time, I think.

If he is challenging me for leadership, I hope that doesn't mean I
smell like a male bunny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL.  Must change my
deodorant!  But he could see me as a rival couldn't he?  The house must
have my scent - I've lived here 10 years, and HIS WIFE is every bit as
bonded with me as she is with him.  She'll leave him and come to me for
a cuddle quite happily.

I'm going to read Language of Lagomorphs again and keep a close watch
on his body language to see what he's saying to me.  Perhaps I'm
insulting him and he's taking revenge.

&gt; how much smaller are the new litterboxes?  I know when nibs is out and about
&gt; he is more likely to use a larger box rather than the smaller one I have for
&gt; my dwarfs...

&gt; Bambi will become frusterated in her cage and start to dig dig dig into the
&gt; litterbox as well with stuff flying hethernether everywhere...

&gt; He could also be marking his territory against the cats more than the other

&gt; beds... *he also stalks the dog*  but nibs does NOT like the dog at all...
&gt; but we are slowly working on that...

&gt; how well does the bun and cats get along?  it might be those two species you

&gt; &gt; Yes, he was already neutered when I got him from the shelter.  (and
&gt; &gt; both I and the vet have checked to be sure there are no 'baubles'
&gt; &gt; hiding away there!)

&gt; &gt; I think that part of the problem is that he's come into Cinnamon's
&gt; &gt; territory, which has to smell of her.  (Even though I don't notice it).
&gt; &gt; He keeps trying to hump her to prove he's the boss - she either claims
&gt; &gt; a headache and runs off with him in pursuit - the exercise is doing her
&gt; &gt; a lot of good! - or else continues eating, grooming, whatever and takes
&gt; &gt; no notice of his attempts at all which can't do much for his male ego.

&gt; &gt; I don't cage them.  There is a hutch they can go into if they want to,
&gt; &gt; and sometimes they do, but not often.  Its door is always open.
&gt; &gt; There's one litter tray near that with blankets in between, all set on
&gt; &gt; a tiled floor which is easy to clean.  Cinnamon uses the tray, as he
&gt; &gt; does most of the time, but sometimes the blankets - which I lift and
&gt; &gt; wash straight away.  Further along they have more blankets and their
&gt; &gt; feed dishes, water hay, all of which can be moved into the lobby where
&gt; &gt; the hutch is if I do need to shut them in using the dog gate.  Again,
&gt; &gt; those blankets are regularly washed, but they tend not to get marked
&gt; &gt; anyway.

&gt; &gt; It's in the living room that there is a problem.  That's carpeted.
&gt; &gt; There are bunny blankets in front of the fire and another litter tray
&gt; &gt; by the door on waterproof front door mats that are washable.

&gt; &gt; Cinnamon is a good girl and uses the trays.

&gt; &gt; Nutmeg made a brilliant start but in the past 2 weeks has begun to mark
&gt; &gt; in the living room.  Now remember that is really the only space that I
&gt; &gt; can sit down with the bunnies and we are companions - I don't want to
&gt; &gt; shut them away in the kitchen/lobby (where there is NO space for me to
&gt; &gt; sit - tiny area)

&gt; &gt; He began peeing on the marble hearth and it was running down onto the
&gt; &gt; carpet.  He's stopped that since I steam cleaned it all.  Then he began
&gt; &gt; excavating both litter trays all over the floor - the living room one
&gt; &gt; most often - making a horrible mess of the doormats, and he was peeing
&gt; &gt; on the excavated litter instead of in what was still in the tray. I
&gt; &gt; kept putting the litter back and washing the mats and suddenly he just
&gt; &gt; stopped that trick.

&gt; &gt; HIs latest venture is the little fur fabric catbeds that they love to

&gt; &gt; and put it in the washer.  As soon as it was dried I put it back down
