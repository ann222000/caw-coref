I wish, I've been recruited to help redo the deck on the back of my
mother-in-law's house this weekend.

&quot;Life is not a journey to the grave with intentions of arriving safely in a
pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly
used up, totally worn out and loudly proclaiming ... WOW! What a ride!&quot;

I'll be there, so far, it'll be helping out where I can, with a SS ride
thrown in, a ride with my wife &amp; kids (maybe even just the paved bike path),
and I do have a &quot;kitchen pass&quot; to camp (family goes home).

ARe any of you guys leaving from the Worcester area?  Perhaps I could meet
someone in that area and hitch a ride the rest of the way to NEMBA fest?  It
is kind of a haul from Burlington, CT all the way to Wompy, but it could be
my last weekend to ride before hockey season (I coach) hits full swing.

Best,

Mark

I can't make it.  Too many kid/family obligations on Saturday.

I am out, too.  Jake had his cataract surgery yesterday and I need to
be close to home.  If the recovery goes well, I hope that we will be
doing some hiking soon (in case anyone is interested in joining for
some &quot;cross training&quot;) and maybe even doing some rides before the end
of the year (I'm keeping all my fingers crossed!).

The good news is that his vision should be back to normal (or close)
within a week or twio we just need to get ahead of a lot of
inflammation and pressure in the eyes post-surgery.

Had looked forward to getting to Wompy for Nembafest, so please take
some pics and post a report if you're going!
