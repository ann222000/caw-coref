No.  I've probably had sexual contact with thousands of men during the
past 20, or more, years.  One evening in the local park can result in
such contact with more than a dozen men.

A few times a new shag has asked &quot;What about HIV?&quot;  To which I've
responded &quot;What about it?&quot;  And that's the end of the conversation
about HIV.  Perhaps they're too embarrassed to probe further or too
eager to have their wicked way with me.

Even a direct question, such as &quot;Do you have HIV,&quot; would elicit a &quot;No&quot;
response from me.

I'm not aware of any instant HIV tests and normal blood tests take
several days to weeks to complete.  Unless the potential partners
are physically restrained and confined testing center premises until
their HIV tests come back negative, there is no way for one partner
to be certain the other partner hasn't engaged in any sex outside
their potential relationship.

In other words, two days wait means two dozen possible outside sexual
encounters for each potential partner.  Do you really trust your new
partner enough to not have cheated on you during the time window
between taking the blood samples and receiving the results from the
off-site laboratory?

There are no HIV tests at all!  It's a bit difficult to test for
something that doesn't exist.

The 10 HIV Myths According to the Denialist:

AIDS is a New Disease - AIDS is really a re-packaging of existing illnesses.

HIV Cause AIDS - some feel HIV is harmless; others feel that HIV may be involved but there are other
factors that contribute to AIDS.

HIV is Infectious - as stated earlier, many feel that conventional HIV theory violates established
rules of viral behavior.

HIV is Sexually Transmitted - the spread among heterosexuals is too slow, disproving the belief that
HIV is sexually transmitted.

Gay Men are Dying From AIDS - this stems from the belief that recreation drugs such as amyl nitrate
are responsible for the deaths among gay men. Denialists believe gay men have a higher incidence of
recreational drug use than the general population, accounting for higher HIV and AIDS death rates
among gay men.

Africa is Being Destroyed by HIV and AIDS - denialist believe it is things like malnutrition and
unsanitary conditions that cause the deaths in Africa, not HIV and AIDS.

AIDS is Incurable - avoiding things like toxic drugs and living a healthy life style will cure AIDS
according to the denialist.

You Can Test for HIV - the denialist believes that the tests used to diagnose HIV are flawed and
unreliable.

AZT is an Anti-Viral Medication - according to denialists, AZT does nothing but damage DNA and really
has no anti-viral activity.

Drug Regimens Stop HIV - in fact, combination therapies do nothing but mask symptoms, according to
the denialists, and in fact it is these drugs that make people sick, not HIV and AIDS.
