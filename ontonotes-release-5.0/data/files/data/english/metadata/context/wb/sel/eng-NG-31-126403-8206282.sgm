I'm sure this has been covered many times but I
was wondering if leaving the printer on all of the
time is better for clogs. There is nothing worse
than a clogged head that you can't clear. It seems
like my i960 is clogging and it is harder and
harder to clear.

The best way is to use OEM ink and never turn off the printer.

This is one of those subjects that gets periodically discussed and to
which there are many opinions.  It depends upon the ink formulation, the
printer head and cleaning design, the climate you live in, and even the
printer model and the specific printer, as tolerances in manufacturing
differ.  In general, you have to test and see.  Warmer and dryer
climates, and equipment that gives off a lot of heat usually biases
towards shutting down between use (depending, however, on how much time
we are talking about).

I wouldn't  argue any of the points Art is making; not that I would want to
in the first place. He is usually right. Additionally I believe the clogging
would have a greater tendency with older ink that is reaching the point of
expiration from the manufacturer, as it tends to thicken due to oxidation.

Agreed. As for the printer on/printer off question, I never argue the

Most of the Canons have a little vacuum pump below the wiper blade to
pull ink through during a cleaning cycle. The wiper blade gets worn
and the vacuum pump fails. Getting harder and harder often indicates
more of a problem with the wiper or the pump, rather than with the
ink.

If you are using aftermarket ink, I'm guessing that your supplier is
giving you pigmented ink instead of the dye based ink that is suppose
to be used on that printer.  Pigmented ink will clog a print head
that

From a purely environmental aspect, and probably in terms of equipment
longevity, this is usually a good approach, after all, electronics do
have a lifespan.  Older equipment used to be less clearcut, because
power supplies and surge resistance wasn't as we'll designed as today,
so turning things on and off regularly took their toll as well.  Today,
most equipment is built to withstand on/off cycling quite well
eliminating most issues with those related failures, so turning it off
saves no only electricity, but also component lifespan.

Some older inkjet printers also tended to do long and wasteful cleaning
cycles with each power cycle, but again, most of that is history.

I'd actually be surprised a 3rd party vendor would supply a more costly ink.

The word compare is the key.  He may be able to provide his empirical
opinion as far as his taste goes but there are two issues.  He may not
be using Sensinent ink as the relabeler he sources ink from may not
tell him.  Also there is the issue of longevity that he most likely
does not know.  And I do not think Wilhelm tested that ink.

There is something fundamentally wrong with your post.
You're stating that...&quot;the vendor probably didn't do it intentionally&quot;.

&gt; Irwin,

&gt; I know this is off the subject, however since I can't email.....this
&gt; is my only way I can of communication.  Could you please tell me if
&gt; you ever compared photo prints from Sensient ink and OEM Canon ink?  I
&gt; just inherited a Canon i960 and I'm still looking for ink for it.

&gt; How well does photo prints compare with these two different inks?  I
&gt; checked many reviews and although most are positive, I would like to
&gt; hear from you.  Also, which website do you buy from?

&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Stan
">

Bought mine from Alotofthings.com
I bought bottles of refill ink, they come with lot numbers and
production dates, and photo printing results were the same for me as
with Canon OEM cartridges (I saw no difference when I refilled my
cartridges that came with the printer). Of course, my results have been
consistent since then, since I am still using the first bottles of ink I
got. I'm finally running low on a couple of colors, so when I replace
them, there may be a difference (haven't got there yet), but since I
will be using the same ink for a couple of years, if there is a
difference in the next batch, I can make a compensation that will be
good for several years.
But to answer your question directly, I didn't have to make any
compensation for the first batch.
This observation is for refill ink only, I would assume that if you
bought cartridges refilled by someone else, there might be more
variability.
A 4 or 8 ounce bottle of refill ink will give you a huge number of
cartridge refills that are 100% constant since it is the same ink every
refill. I see no signs of ink deterioration after 42 months on the same
bottles, but that may be pushing it.

&gt; The word compare is the key.&amp;nbsp; He may be able to provide his empirical
&gt; opinion as far as his taste goes but there are two issues.&amp;nbsp; He may not
&gt; be using Sensinent ink as the relabeler he sources ink from may not

&gt; does not know.&amp;nbsp; And I do not think Wilhelm tested that ink.&lt;br&gt;
">

There is only one real issue, I have used both, so I can compare, you
have only used Canon, so you don't know shit.
Since you haven't ever seen a bottle of ink, you don't realize that my
bottles are labeled with the manufacturers name, date of manufacture,
and lot number. And since I use the same bottle of ink to refill 40 or
50 cartridges, I know it is consistent. I know many things about my ink
and my printing results, (sorry to be repetitive) and you don't know
shit.
The dumbest Motherfucker in the world who buys a printer can buy the ink
they tell him to buy, and he won't learn anything unless he tries

That's a stretch.  They do make labeling errors on occasion, but why
assume that pigment ink was exchanged for dye in this case?

Stan,

Before I kill file you, can you please explain to me why you find it
necessary to respond to this same posting three different times with
three different versions of your answer, stating nearly the identical
wording?

I'm not speaking of three identical postings which could be server
hiccups, but three nearly identical replies to the exact same posting.
(see below)

I can see only three possible reason for this:

1) You suffer from some type of neurological impairment which involves
your short-term memory.  If this is accurate, maybe you are unaware you
are doing this, and therefore the information below could be helpful.
If this is the case, you should see your doctor about this matter to see
if it is a warning sign of a degenerative condition (I am not being
sarcastic here).  If you are aware of this problem, you may wish to
examine your &quot;sent&quot; email box to see if you have previously responded to
a posting prior to responding, to avoid this.

2) You are trying to create some type of stat for yourself that shows
you respond to a lot of emails, even though the substance within them is
not necessarily helpful, and is definitely completely repetitive

3) You are trying to be annoying

4) some other explanation I don't fathom but would like to hear your
reasoning about.

&gt; Art,

&gt; good point.  I don't think they would do it intentionally.  My guess
&gt; is that it would be a untrained worker that refilled the wrong ink by
&gt; accident.

Sounds religious to me.

&gt; He knows you will not like it.

&gt;&gt; I'm not speaking of three identical postings which could be server
&gt;&gt; hiccups, but three nearly identical replies to the exact same posting.
&gt;&gt; (see below)

&gt;&gt; I can see only three possible reason for this:

&gt;&gt; 1) You suffer from some type of neurological impairment which involves
&gt;&gt; your short-term memory.

&gt; What about you

&gt;&gt; If this is accurate, maybe you are unaware you are doing this, and
&gt;&gt; therefore the information below could be helpful. If this is the case,
&gt;&gt; you should see your doctor

&gt; If you care about the guy then recommend yours

&gt;&gt; about this matter to see if it is a warning sign of a degenerative
&gt;&gt; condition (I am not being sarcastic here).  If you are aware of this
&gt;&gt; problem, you may wish to examine your &quot;sent&quot; email box to see if you
&gt;&gt; have previously responded to a posting prior to responding, to avoid
&gt;&gt; this.

&gt;&gt; 2) You are trying to create some type of stat for yourself that shows
&gt;&gt; you respond to a lot of emails, even though the substance within them
&gt;&gt; is not necessarily helpful, and is definitely completely repetitive

&gt;&gt; 3) You are trying to be annoying

&gt;&gt; 4) some other explanation I don't fathom but would like to hear your
&gt;&gt; reasoning about.

&gt; And who says you are so pious.

&gt;&gt; Arthur,

&gt;&gt; Good point.....the vendor probably didn't do it intentionally.
&gt;&gt; However, the minimum wage employees they use to package the stuff
&gt;&gt; could of made a mistake.

&gt;&gt; Art, good point that pigmented ink cost more.  I guess I was trying to
&gt;&gt; suggest maybe their untrained employees didn't know the difference.

&gt;&gt; On the other hand, I use nothing but aftermarket ink refills (Sensient),
&gt;&gt; always turn my i960 off when not in use, and after nearly 4 years, have
&gt;&gt; no clogs or need to run cleaning cycles. It probably doesn't matter if
&gt;&gt; you leave it on, since it goes into standby mode after a few minutes
&gt;&gt; anyway, but I just habitually turn mine off.

&gt; Irwin,

&gt; I know this is off the subject, however since I can't email.....this
&gt; is my only way I can of communication.  Could you please tell me if
&gt; you ever compared photo prints from Sensient ink and OEM Canon ink?  I
&gt; just inherited a Canon i960 and I'm still looking for ink for it.

&gt; How well does photo prints compare with these two different inks?  I
&gt; checked many reviews and although most are positive, I would like to
&gt; hear from you.  Also, which website do you buy from?

&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Stan

I refill my carts with MIS inks in my two i960's and one ip5000 printers
with no &quot;tweaking&quot;.  A little less intensity in thel red spectrum than I see
with Canon OEM ink, but I feel that OEM is too saturated in red skin tones.
