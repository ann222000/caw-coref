Hi -
I've been reading along for a while and hope you all can help. The regulars
here seem to know so much about training and temperament and dogs in
general. I've rejoiced at Tuck's recovery, been amazed at the cool stuff
diddy teaches him, marveled at gorgeous photos and victories, and cried at
your sad times. Elegy, I admire your strength and courage.

My life was shared by a dog for fourteen years. I loved her dearly, had a
lot of fun with her and gave her the best life I knew how. I was pretty
ignorant about training, but she was well-mannered and loving, except for
being hostile to other dogs. (I have recently learned that I may have, at
least partly, caused this.) I always made sure she had a job, such as
protecting me from the squirrels, and plenty of exercise and snuggles. She
got insulinoma and had surgery but the tumor came back. I made her last year
as good as it could be, and my vet put her down while I held her, in
October. You can see her here. http://www.flickr.com/photos/64966431@N00/

I've been trying to put my life back together without Liz. I've always known
that I want another dog, and have been visiting with many. Since I can't
hope to have another dog as perfect as Liz was, I've been reading a lot
about training and behavior.Whatever dog I adopt will go with me to doggy
school - as much for me as for the dog. There is only so much one can learn
from a book.

I prefer to adopt a rescue - there are just so many dogs out there that need
a home. I can figure out size and color and looks - what I'm asking about is
temperament.

How can I tell if a dog will be (reasonably) sociable, or if it will have
dangerous personality traits? I know there are no guarantees. Are there ways
to tell about a dog's personality that I can do? I have read a little about
temperament testing. I'm still hesitating to choose because I don't know how
to do this.

Can you all coach me, please?

Pablo is a very good boy and at almost 10 years of age is very much in-sync

Now at 4.5 she's still the Anti-Lassie (sort of like the Anti-Christ but
with 4 white socks, tulip ears, and a pointy nose) and we often tell her
that it's a Good Thing We Love Her or we would send her off to be a junk
yard dog.

On the plus side, Lucy just passed the screening for Cornell Companions, the
local therapy animal group.  She's So Extremely Charming and makes each
person feel like they are her Most Favorite Person in the World.  Little do
they know it's all part of her evil plan.

Not that it's helpful to help you choose a dog, but Matt is right. As you
gain experience, you learn how to train a dog to meet your expectations. As
you learn more and more about the abilities of a dog, you learn how to get
that conformity and increasingly raise the bar. As the dog reaches and
exceeds, it becomes the best dog ever. Taking your dog to obedience school
helps you to easier achieve those goals

Sometimes it's a crap shoot, as elegy sadly discovered.  For the most
part, though, dogs are adaptable, plastic, resilient critters and this
lets them conform to whatever behavior standards you have for them.

What do you consider a dangerous personality trait?  Human aggression?
Suspicion of strangers (note that this puts you at some risk during the
early stages of an adoption)?  Dog aggression?  Intemperate barking?
Separation anxiety?

If you're looking at dogs of identifiable breeds, or mixes of known
breeds, sometimes that helps to identify certain potential problem
areas.  For instance, ACDs are velcro to their humans but suspicious of
strangers -- this can be a problem in a number of ways if you don't
expect it.  When considering an ACD for myself, I don't worry about a
stand-offish attitude when we're first introduced because it won't last
and I actually enjoy being accompanied everywhere by a houseful of dogs.

Someone who's looking for the more temperate affection of, say, a Chow,
could be fooled by the ACD's initial standoffishness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I know there are no guarantees.
">

The best guarantee is your own recognition that any dog you get will
need some help and work to "get with the program".  I've found that the
biggest problem people have with dogs is the (human) expectation that
dogs are born trained and tuned to human existence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Are
&gt; there ways to tell about a dog's personality that I can do? I have
&gt; read a little about temperament testing. I'm still hesitating to
&gt; choose because I don't know how to do this.
">

That's actually a very smart reaction.  Keep in mind that shelter and
rescued dogs may have dozens of people looking at them as a possible
companion (okay, maybe several instead of dozens), and if everyone
applied their own variants of temperament testing, the poor dog will get
the impression that humans are not only irrational, silly creatures
(which we are) but that humans go out of their way to challenge,
confront, and otherwise get in dogs' faces.

Many shelters have "getting to know you" rooms where you can spend some
time with a particular dog.  The first thing I do with a dog in one of
those rooms is ... nothing.  I just let the dog do whatever it's going
to do, and I'll sit quietly and watch.  What I do from there will depend
on whether the dog actively explores the room, solicits attention from
me, lays by the door and whines, or whatever, but usually involves
trying to get the dog's attention.  I might try to see whether the dog
has been taught any simple commands, like "sit", because that also
speaks to the dog's history with humans and its trainability.  I try to
remember that the dog should come out of this evaluation process with a
positive impression of humans, because that's far more important to its
survival than whether or not I choose to adopt that particular critter.

I think some of it boils down to "what is 'better'?"  I owned THE most
perfect Golden Retriever, from 1988-2000.  The most trustworthy dog I
have ever met and everyone loved him, but especially ME.  Was he the
"best" dog I've owned?  Depends on the criteria, and I try not to
measure them against each other.  So many factors, and a big one is who
*I* am when I acquire and live with the dog.

I do different things with dogs now then I did then.  Have more of them.
Live in a totally different living situation.  Know more, but am also
less stringent.    So much of it is not the dog, and I think that is
more of what Matt is saying.  The person is such a huge factor.

I do have some thoughts on personality when it comes to strong-willed
dogs.When you meet the dog, you want to be unthreatening.  Women are
usually better at this;-)  Get down to his level and talk high and
squeaky. This will show you how sociable thay are.  The dog that does
not respond to this, you probably don't want.  Try a whine in the room
with the dogs and see who gets up and wags. When it comes to strong-
willed dogs, how they respond depends on how confident you are. A
strong-willed dog is great, they are often the ones who seem the
smartest after training and they have oodles of personality. But they
are also the ones who will test you, and potentially get aggressive.
It really depends a lot on how firmly you take the dog in hand. The
one who's the stand-out in the pound is often a strong-willed dog.
With any dog, though, how they behave with other dogs and in public is
ultimately going to depend on you-the personality type is just
something you're going to have to consider when training to get the
most out of it.

Suspicion of strangers? As in shyness? Fear? Not sure - have wondered if
this is something a dog can get over, with the right handling. Or a
breed-specific thing, like how a border collie is around strangers?
Dog aggression? Lived with this (on leash only) for 14 years. I question now
whether I (unwittingly) caused this by protecting Liz from the dogs she
'incited.' I would have to learn if there is another way to deal with it -
mine didn't change anything.
Intemperate barking? Please, no.
Separation anxiety? Have heard this is caused by human mistakes in training.
If so, then perhaps it can be resolved? No idea how to do this, either.

&gt; If you're looking at dogs of identifiable breeds, or mixes of known
&gt; breeds, sometimes that helps to identify certain potential problem
&gt; areas.  For instance, ACDs are velcro to their humans but suspicious of
&gt; strangers -- this can be a problem in a number of ways if you don't
&gt; expect it.  When considering an ACD for myself, I don't worry about a
&gt; stand-offish attitude when we're first introduced because it won't last
&gt; and I actually enjoy being accompanied everywhere by a houseful of dogs.

&gt; Someone who's looking for the more temperate affection of, say, a Chow,
&gt; could be fooled by the ACD's initial standoffishness.
">

My first choice is a fox terrier, or more likely a rat terrier or terrier
mix at rescue groups. Liz spent 14 years teaching me about life with a dog
(was a 'cat person,' but still love cats:) and about the heart of a terrier.
I always said she had the same heart as a pit, which I consider to be a
_very_ good thing, just in a smaller package. I love their fearless,
intensely focused, inquisitive nature. Well-handled, they are so loving.

&gt; The best guarantee is your own recognition that any dog you get will
&gt; need some help and work to &quot;get with the program&quot;.  I've found that the
&gt; biggest problem people have with dogs is the (human) expectation that
&gt; dogs are born trained and tuned to human existence.
">

Heaven forbid. Liz was 'trained' to march to her own drummer - and most of
it was delightful. Making the rules myself is a novel idea - I know I sound
like an idiot - but one I've got to get used to. I've learned that dogs see
the world and people very differently than people do. I need training as
much as any dog I could find.

&gt;&gt; Are
&gt;&gt; there ways to tell about a dog's personality that I can do? I have
&gt;&gt; read a little about temperament testing. I'm still hesitating to
&gt;&gt; choose because I don't know how to do this.
&gt; Many shelters have &quot;getting to know you&quot; rooms where you can spend some
&gt; time with a particular dog.  The first thing I do with a dog in one of
&gt; those rooms is ... nothing.  I just let the dog do whatever it's going
&gt; to do, and I'll sit quietly and watch.  What I do from there will depend
&gt; on whether the dog actively explores the room, solicits attention from
&gt; me, lays by the door and whines, or whatever, but usually involves
&gt; trying to get the dog's attention.  I might try to see whether the dog
&gt; has been taught any simple commands, like &quot;sit&quot;, because that also
&gt; speaks to the dog's history with humans and its trainability.  I try to
&gt; remember that the dog should come out of this evaluation process with a
&gt; positive impression of humans, because that's far more important to its
&gt; survival than whether or not I choose to adopt that particular critter.

&gt; I do have some thoughts on personality when it comes to strong-willed
&gt; dogs.When you meet the dog, you want to be unthreatening.  Women are
&gt; usually better at this;-)  Get down to his level and talk high and
&gt; squeaky. This will show you how sociable thay are.  The dog that does
&gt; not respond to this, you probably don't want.  Try a whine in the room
&gt; with the dogs and see who gets up and wags. When it comes to strong-
&gt; willed dogs, how they respond depends on how confident you are. A
&gt; strong-willed dog is great, they are often the ones who seem the
&gt; smartest after training and they have oodles of personality. But they
&gt; are also the ones who will test you, and potentially get aggressive.
&gt; It really depends a lot on how firmly you take the dog in hand. The
&gt; one who's the stand-out in the pound is often a strong-willed dog.
&gt; With any dog, though, how they behave with other dogs and in public is
&gt; ultimately going to depend on you-the personality type is just
&gt; something you're going to have to consider when training to get the
&gt; most out of it.

It can be.. Different strokes for different folks. But many of us involved

You make it sound like it's one or the other.  It's both.  The dog
competes AND is just being herself.  Or rather, the human part of the
team competes.  The dog has a grand time going to interesting new
places, meeting interesting new dogs, running around doing fun doggy
things (could be herding, agility, retrieving).

Many of the terrier breeds are expected to same-sex aggressive or dog
aggressive, or both.  Rat terriers less than Foxies or Jacks, if my

adult dogs ought to be expected to adore throngs of new acquaintances.

I recently (like last night) came to a similar conclusion myself.  Most of
the older dogs at the dog park do fine with other dogs, but with very few
exceptions, don't exactly play with each other.  There are many that run
around chasing balls or otherwise play with humans, a few that chase the
dogs chasing balls, a bunch that putter around, occasionally playing with a
dog or two they know, but mostly, it's the young dogs making new friends,
playing tag and keep away, and wrestling each other into the ground.

Now that the weather has warmed up a tad, there has been an influx of new
people, and I'm getting more and more people asking me if Khan is a puppy.
For the most part, his playmates fall into the 'Two and Under' category, and
he is the only older dog I know who is consistently happy to take on new
playmates.

Yeah, he's pretty happy with his little fiefdom.

He's just very different from other dominant dogs I've met, most of whom
were more puffed up and reserved around other dogs.  A vast majority would
never stoop to the level of their underlings, and you can just forget about
rolling around on the ground or getting their faced chewed on.

I will admit that it is just a load of fun to watch him have such a
rollicking good time.  He'll swat at his buddies with those massive paws and
send them flying, they'll come back and throw themselves at him, and he'll
go down hard, legs waving in the air, and let them sit on him, chew on his
face and drag him about by his ruff.  He's just such a good dog.

For many dogs, competition or some other kind of structured activity
with their special person is part of who they are. Other dogs just
want to hang out with their person. It depends on the dog, and it
depends on the person.

You'll probably be happiest with a dog that doesn't remind you too
much of the one that's gone. I'll never get back my dear, beautiful,
perfect Sunday, the first dog who was MINE and not my cousins', but
other dogs since then, without taking her place, have filled some of
the gap, and been special in their own ways. I would never want to
have missed out on Brandy, either, or...well.

The main thing is to be ready for a new relationship, and not try to
recreate the old one.

IMO those dogs are not true dominant dogs. True dominants don't *need*
to puff up and get all snarky to prove their position. All the other
dogs simply know it. And true dominants are often quite happy to do
silly things like roll around and get their faces chewed on because they
are very comfortable with their rank and status.

Viva is a true dominant and most of the time you'd never know it--she
often lets Cala push her around. But no dog ever picks a fight with her.
Ever. She never postures, stiffens, or eyes strange dogs and is
generally happy to ignore them, but they just don't mess with her. Not
even known dog-aggressive dogs will try it. She'll stand around in the
most unassuming of poses and everybody just sort of veers right out of
her way.

You do see it in people too. I'm sure all of us have been somewhere when
someone walks in the room and you just feel the force of their power.
