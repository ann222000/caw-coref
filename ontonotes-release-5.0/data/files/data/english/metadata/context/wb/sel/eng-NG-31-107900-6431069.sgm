HI
While installing speakers in a home theater, there are 110volt wires
directly behind two of the speakers.
Does anyone know of a way to isolate the speakers from the power wires
without rerouting the power wires. Like sheet lead or metal boxes
or?????
Thank You
Don

It's called PVC insulation and can be found ready installed on purpose made
stuff called 'insulated cable'.

You're worried about hum pickup?  It isn't normally an issue at
speaker levels, which is why speaker cables aren't even screened. Even
with line level signals, it's usually sufficient just to avoid
bundling signal and power cables together.

Is this a real problem or just a potential one?

There's no possibility whatever it can be a real problem.

It is rare that you can find a location for any speakers
that are NOT next to a wall with mains power running
through it.

Why?  There are millions of speakers installed in this kind
of arrangement with no problem whatsoever.

If there is some specific problem you want to solve, tell us
what it is.  Otherwise don't worry about it.

It is possible that this is a powered speaker and the OP
has a long run of unbalanced (and maybe even unshielded/

along thew way, or could be a ground loop?  Without the
pertinent details, we are shooting in the dark.

If it is a conventional speaker with speaker-level wiring,
agreed that the possibility of interference from power
mains wiring is slim and none.

I truely think audio noise can get into systems. Ticks and buzzes
might get there just through ground loops, and the speaker lines
have capacitive coupling, effectively creating a ground loop.
on occasion a shielded speaker cable can help, perhaps even
with a strong AM radio station nearby. 60 HZ hum would not be as much a
problem. These are grounded only on one end, or connected to shield only
on one end, at the amplifier side. Usually indicated with an arrow. The shield
will keep the capacitive coupling to ground at the equipment site, and no be as
subject to remote coupling to other static fields.

Speaker lines are very low impedance and high-level. That is
why they virtually never need any kind of shielding, etc. Unless
the OP has one side of his speaker locally grounded (which
would be truly bizzare), there is no "ground loop" possible.
The "load" (the speaker) is completely floating/isolated and
the line is completely balanced in the classic sense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not at 50 or 60 Hz.  The "capacitive coupling" is slim to none.
In fact that is one of the reasons many recommend AGAINST
using any kind of shielded/screened cable for speaker wiring.
(Because of excess parallel capacitance which some power
amps may not like.)

Only if the power amp has some design or manufacturing
flaw that makes it susceptable to RF coming in through the
speaker lines.  Might be a consideration if the installation is
in a high-power transmitter shack, etc.

I was referring to a ground loop between the input circuitry or

capacitively coupled through the speakers wires, to another AC source or
ground not having the same potential as the preamps ground.
Completly isolated means completely. A wire cannot be nxt to another wire
and be isolated.

The amount of capacitance between the shield and driven leads
is minimal. The shield can also be attached to driven output.
I think I mentioned 60Hz would not likely be a problem. Buzzes and tick
up in the many kHz range can be a problem.

It can happen with the best of equipment near high powered AM
fields. The usuall Ham trick is to install a cap, or resistor and cap
across the speakers outputs. This has worked many times.

If it's unshielded he's an idiot and besides it has nothing to do with
'isolation' !
