&gt; This might be a little out there but I thought I'd post it anyway.

&gt; While I was reading the comments on the last topic a few
&gt; days ago I turned on the television card in my PC and did a
&gt; little channel surfing. I came across a show called &quot;It's
&gt; Me Or The Dog!&quot;. It's about an expert dog trainer (Victoria
&gt; Stilwell) who helps people with problem dogs. Of course
&gt; it's always the owners who have failed to train the pets
&gt; that are the real problem.
">

Watch the MAN in the show the Dog Whisperer, he always gets the job done.
Dogs must know who the Alpha man in the pack is then they behave, just like
Females.

Zoe and Paul have two greyhounds that fight, bite, go crazy

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; on walks and have turned the house into one big toilet and
&gt; it's down to Zoe's 'natural' (no discipline) rearing of the
&gt; dogs. Paul wants to discipline the dogs but Zoe wont hear
&gt; of it despite the fact that her methods have failed. Paul,
&gt; finding his advice totally ignored disengages from the
&gt; situation and lets her get on with it. She now sees his
&gt; lack of involvement as the 'real' problem and thinks if
&gt; only he'll get involved then doubling up what didn't work
&gt; in the first place, now, somehow miraculously will work.
&gt; The bit that made me really take notice was when she said
&gt; if she had to choose between the dogs and her partner then
&gt; he would have to go.

&gt; Now, I missed the beginning but managed to record some of
&gt; it and here is the defining moment of the show (for me
&gt; anyway) on youtube (about 3 minutes).

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTbcqayhG4Q

&gt; When Zoe is forced to accept that she has done a lot wrong
&gt; in the training of the dogs she bursts into tears (how very
&gt; predictable). Women accepting responsibility for their
&gt; actions these days seems to be a rarity. And why should
&gt; it when they can falsely blame men and continually get
&gt; away with it?
">

Because we permit them to. Women and children are irresponsible and must
always be led by a strong man.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It really kind of sums up the problems men face with modern,
&gt; pushy 'empowered' women who think with their feelings and
&gt; are constantly told by the media that women are intrinsically
&gt; right and men are inherently bad and wrong.
">

Well that's brainwashing because since the beginning of time females always
had to be led by men.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When you boil it down to basics, Paul was right and Zoe was
&gt; wrong but she would not accept this, despite all the evidence
&gt; that her methods had failed, until being told off by another
&gt; woman 'expert'.

&gt; What was Paul supposed to do in this situation to get the
&gt; dogs disciplined correctly? Raise his hand to Zoe?
">

He needs to train Zoe first, he has been negligent in his duty as a man.

As far

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; as I can see the only thing he could do was to disengage,
&gt; yet that only resulted in even more blame being heaped
&gt; upon him. And it irks me that to get Zoe onboard with a
&gt; solution plan Paul still had to unjustly accept half the
&gt; blame.

&gt; So many women are just not prepared to listen to men these
&gt; days no matter how wrong they are.&quot;

In the old days females knew their place :o)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not much has changed, hence the basis for TV shows

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the kids are (unsurprising to me) much better behaved.

Of course. With females in charge, it's like children minding children.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The fathers on the program also are quicker to put

Females never learn and will do the same thing over and over even if it is
not working. Mentally, they reach their peak at 16 and it's all downhill
from there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I thought of when seeing this Society.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Children.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And specifically these grossly overweight kids you see in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the news every so often. The news stories always follow the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same pattern. They seem to cover every angle except the
&gt;&gt;&gt; obvious one.
">

It's very obvious why the kids are fat. It's directly correlated to the % of
unwed females and fatherless homes. You must remember that the Patriarch is
the one who keeps the kids and the naturally self indulgent females in
check. Look at the statistics from 30 years ago on both unwed mothers and
the rates of obesity and you can see that they are directly related. 30
years ago fat kids and unwed mothers were rare and in fact it was a disgrace
for a female to get knocked up if she wasn't married. A female would have to
hang her head in shame for being so irresponsible and go off to a home for
unwed Ho's to have the kid which would be put up for adoption to some nice
decent respectable married couple. And this is how it should be because
females are irrational and it's the only thing they understand. If left to
their own devices they would engage in promiscuous sex which is just a
female's compulsive drive to get pregnant and you can see the result today.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Where is the child getting such huge amounts of food from
&gt;&gt;&gt; if they're to big to even walk anymore?&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; And the answer is the mother of course. But wimmin just
&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot be blamed for anything at all these days so that
&gt;&gt;&gt; line of investigation has to be worked around or ignored.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And it's obvious how these idiotic wimmins minds work.
&gt;&gt;&gt; When the kid screams for food she always gives in because
&gt;&gt;&gt; it wouldn't be &quot;caring&quot; to see the child &quot;suffer&quot;.
">

The child isn't suffering  by being made to eat a normal diet  lol  He will
be suffering if he gets diabetes or any of the other diseases lard arses are
prone to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I disagree.  They plug the kid's mouth with food so the
&gt;&gt; (usually single) mother doesn't have to be &quot;stressed out&quot;
&gt;&gt; by listening to the kid whine and moan that it's hungry
&gt;&gt; or bored or whatever.  Most mothers just want quiet
&gt;&gt; at any price.  Especially when *she* doesn't have to pay
&gt;&gt; the price.
">

Females never have to pay the price. Perhaps when these lard arses reach
18yo and realise what moma has done they'll sue her for child abuse :o)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yeah.  The &quot;suffer&quot; stuff is just an excuse those mothers
&gt; use to excuse themselves.

&gt;&gt; To an older child, food is what a pacifier or bottle is
&gt;&gt; to an infant from mom's perspective.

&gt; So true.  I see the effects of that misguided kind of mothering
&gt; all too often in the checkout line at the market.
">

I've noticed that in US supermarkets there are aisles that say &quot;no candy&quot; I
didn't know why this was so and then realised it was so that the kids with
the female wouldn't start screaming for it  lol  I guess the male managers
who run these stores know not to put temptation in front of children and
females.

Many

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; children have trained the parent, usually the mother, that
&gt; a trip to the store is really an expedition to find a toy
&gt; and some candy for the kid.
">

Sure. She's training the kid to be a shopper like herself and buy useless
junk food, known to females euphemistically  as &quot;comfort food&quot;  lol

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; And the more she gives in the more the child wants
&gt;&gt;&gt; and so on.  Then you get to the point where witholding
&gt;&gt;&gt; food really does cause large amounts of anguish
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the kid and that's it.

&gt; Drug addictions often start that way; at first the
&gt; easy pleasure seems to come with no ill effects, then
&gt; the dosage has to go up and up to get relief and
&gt; withdrawl comes at a cost.  One could say that those
&gt; mothers are feed-the-kid junkies and are themselves
&gt; junk food pushers who addict helpless kids.
">

It's no surprise that 80% of junkies in the 1800's were females using
opiates and cocaine and not much has changed because it is the females who
still use most  mind altering prescription drugs today.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Drastic measures like removing the child from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mother and starving it
">

That's not necessary for a kid because he is still growing. Just a normal
diet will surfice but it will have to be supervised by a male social worker
(substitute Patriarch) for it to work.

will cause long lasting mental

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; trauma but continuing down the same path will mean no
&gt;&gt;&gt; real life for the kid.

&gt;&gt; I believe kids will do much better without a mother
&gt;&gt; who cares more for &quot;her peace of mind&quot; than the health
&gt;&gt; and well being of her children.

&gt;&gt; Too many mothers are simply &quot;girls who can't say no.&quot;
">

How do you think these unwed Ho's got knocked up in the first place?   haha

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; :-)

&gt; Well put, Jill.

&gt;&gt;&gt; All for the sake of some discipline which a father in
&gt;&gt;&gt; charge would have provided.

&gt; Hey, either the parent trains the child or the child will
&gt; train the parent.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was looking up some stuff about child obesity and
&gt;&gt;&gt; found that some sectors are trying to blame this crisis
&gt;&gt;&gt; on poverty.
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.newstatesman.com/200310200013
">

Poverty?  haha Poor people in most places are skinny. It's only in the US
and developed countries with a high % of unwed mothers where the kids are
fat and &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; is giving them free food thanks to the taxes paid by
working MEN.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; If they are so poor how can they afford the mountains of
&gt;&gt;&gt; food?

&gt; Your tax dollars at work.  Or more precisely, waste.
&gt; If they're &quot;poor&quot;, they're almost certainly feeding on
&gt; the welfare dole.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The article above states:
&gt;&gt;&gt;    &quot;The &quot;fat gap&quot; between rich and poor
&gt;&gt;&gt;    is the result of food poverty - a term
&gt;&gt;&gt;    increasingly used to explain why those
&gt;&gt;&gt;    on low incomes often cannot provide a
&gt;&gt;&gt;    healthy diet for their children.&quot;
">

I suggest you look at how much these &quot;poor people&quot; get in food stamps before
saying they can't eat a healthy diet. Myself, and a number of other
professsors have experimented and lived very well on what these females
receive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Ha!  That invented term &quot;food poverty&quot; explains nothing.
&gt; It is a pseudo-explanation, something stuck in where one
&gt; might expect an explanation to be provided but this glib
&gt; phrase &quot;food poverty&quot; is no explanation at all; it's just
&gt; a dogma peddled by true believers in a peculiarly
&gt; unrealistic ideology.
">

It's bullshit. These poor Mexicans practically live on beans.rice and
oatmeal for breakfast and seem pretty healthy and slim to me. All this stuff
is cheap.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; They expect us to believe that fruit and vegetables are high
&gt;&gt;&gt; priced luxury items only the evil rich and privileged middle
&gt;&gt;&gt; classes can afford?

&gt; Uh huh, just as &quot;they&quot; expect us to believe that Osama bin
&gt; Laden is a victim of poverty and &quot;globalization&quot;.  &quot;They&quot;
&gt; are quite self-deluded, aren't they?

&gt;&gt; Snack foods cost as much or more than fruit and vegetables.
&gt;&gt; It's an obvious truth.

&gt;&gt; Here's the difference:  Snack foods don't have to be washed,
&gt;&gt; peeled, sliced, or cooked.  Fruits and vegetables almost
&gt;&gt; always require some sort of preparation in the home.
&gt;&gt; What--you want &quot;overworked&quot; single moms to have to do
&gt;&gt; more work?  LOL.
">

C'mon, peeling a few potatoes or carrots is hardly work  lol The problem
with females is that they are always wasting time on trivial crap and
bullshitting on the phone.
Just the other day I had a plumber working on some things and it was taking
him longer than expected so he asked to use my phone to call his wife. After
telling her he would be home when he finished the job and probably listening
to a lot of female trivial bullshit he hung up. I didn't say anything but
then he said to me that his wife was crying that he wasn't home and worrried
lol The real reason was that she had some little tiff at work and needed him
there to listen to her big &quot;problem&quot;  lol I bet dinner wasn't ready when he
got home   haha

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Heh heh.  Such a time-consuming strain it is to rinse those
&gt; apples and grapes under the kitchen faucet.  And peeling
&gt; a banana -- it's sooooo hard, those single moms must
&gt; really be wondering how a monkey can learn how to do it
&gt; and teach her little monkey how as well.

The average monkey is smarter than a US female :o)
