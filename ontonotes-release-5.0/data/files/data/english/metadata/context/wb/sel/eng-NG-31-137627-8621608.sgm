Little brown bats find home in Muldoon for the summer

Tiny mammals have been visiting for 15 years

Ahh, Anchorage -- where there are moose in the yards and bears in the trash
... and some folks have bats in the bedroom. Just ask Inge Boyden.

The longtime Muldoon area resident not only has bats hunting for insects
among the tall trees in her Centennial Park neighborhood each summer -- for
the past 15 years, she's had them flying inside her house as well.

One showed up during an afternoon party in July when Boyden and her
now-grown children were sitting together in the back patio -- and spotted a
tiny bat on the inside looking out.

&quot;And Mom said, 'Oh no, not again ...' &quot; recalls daughter Karina Barenz.

This week she found another one that died in her kitchen trash can.

Most often, however, the tiny flying mammals (a species known as &quot;little
brown bat&quot;) appear indoors late in the evening, as many as five a night.

&quot;One summer I had 17 (on different days),&quot; says Boyden, a 68-year-old widow
who works these days as an office assistant at St. Patrick's Church in
Muldoon. &quot;Usually they show up about 2 or 4 in the morning -- in your
bedroom.&quot;

Does she hear them fluttering around?

&quot;They don't flutter,&quot; she says. &quot;They sail. You just know there's something
there, and you open your eyes -- and you run.&quot;

Does she switch the lights on and try to catch them?

&quot;They'll come after you if you do,&quot; Boyden adds with a laugh. &quot;At least it
seems like it. In reality they don't. It's just that they fly toward you.&quot;

So she opens the bedroom door, walks out, waits for the bat to follow her --
then hurries back in and quickly shuts the door.

&quot;Then you start to go back to sleep again, but you think there might be
another one, and you open up your eyes -- and there is another one.&quot;

Boyden has invited biologists from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to
her home to try to determine how the bats are getting in. On one visit a
specialist thought they might be coming down her chimney. But the chimney is
screened, and she keeps the flue closed.

She also hired a pest control expert from Wasilla, who walked around the
house's foundation, looking for holes. And she asked the people re-modeling
her kitchen to do the same thing. But none of those efforts solved the
mystery.

She built an outdoor bat house on the side of her garden shed, trying to
offer an alternative. But so far the bats prefer her house instead.

It all started in 1992, one year after her husband died, the family says.

Boyden was away on a trip that summer, and her then-26-year-old daughter
Karina Barenz was inside the house alone, sleeping in a basement bedroom. It
was about 2 or 3 in the morning.

&quot;I was sound asleep -- and I felt something run across my pillow,&quot; Barenz
recalls. &quot;Yeah, then I was wide awake. I thought it was a mouse ... so I
turned the light on -- and it was flying above my head.&quot;

That was quite a surprise.

After four or five subsequent episodes in the years to come, however, the
summer bat visitations inside her mother's home became so commonplace that
Barenz and her siblings learned to take them in stride.

Either they or their mother would simply herd the bat outside by opening a
door or a window. Or they would catch it in a container while it hung
resting on the drapes.

&quot;They're not going to hurt you,&quot; Barenz says. &quot;They're definitely more
scared of you than the other way around.&quot;

According to a Web site maintained by the Alaska Bat Club (which praises the
&quot;only mammal that can fly&quot; for consuming up to 5,000 mosquitoes a night),
there are five species of bats in the state.

Nearly all of them are limited to Southeast Alaska. Only the little brown
bat (Myotis lucifugus) occurs in the Interior or Southcentral.

Not much is known about the population, migration or ecology of local bats,
according to the site.

That's why non-game biologist David Tessler of the Alaska Department of Fish
and Game in Anchorage is coordinating a &quot;Citizen Scientist&quot; project to
gather information about bat sightings in Alaska (see
&lt; http://www.akbat.net/ &gt; www.akbat.net ).

Inge Boyden says the state is welcome to all the bats it can find in her
home. All she asks is that the state find a way to keep them out.

&quot;They said my house could be considered a maternity ward,&quot; Boyden says. &quot;And
I said, 'Outside is fine. But inside is not.'&quot;
