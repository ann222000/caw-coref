Hi!
I am an independent artist building a website and I am looking for
some feedback on my work. Sometimes artists cannot handle criticism,
but I LOVE it. Even if you have some really nasty things to say about
me or my work, I can usually find some truth in it and use it to my
advantage to become a better artist. If you are having a nasty day and
want to blow some steam - I'll take it!!!! I will greatly appreciate
if you're feeling positive and want to share your opinions. Any ideas
on how or what should be marketed? Do I even create anything worth any
interest? My personal favs are the watercolors, and the photo
manipulations. Let me know.... thanks in advance.
