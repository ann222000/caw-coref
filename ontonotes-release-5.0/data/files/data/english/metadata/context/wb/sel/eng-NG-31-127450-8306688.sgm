What's with those NBC morons screwing over Conan after promising him
the Tonight Show?  Hell, they just fuck over all their talent.  I'm no
Leno fan but remember they stabbed him in the back by secretly
offering the Tonight Show to Letterman after Leno had it initially.
At least Letterman had the class to turn it down.

What the hell is wrong with those NBC dickheads?  Who would WANT to
work for NBC?  Sheesh.

I disagree with that. I like Ferguson. I watch his show, I don't watch

After hearing the Conan will replace Leno after he retires, I have given
Conan several tries.  The  man just is NOT funny.   His opening monologue is
the worst.  I do realize that there are different styles of humor.  Leno is
my funny guy.  Conan is not even close and if they give him the job, I don't
know what I will watch at that hour.  I know lots will disagree with me, but
I never laugh at Letterman either.  It is just a different type of humor.

In my area, Leno is taped-delayed a half-hour so I usually watch the
first half-hour of each (usually the best part) and I like both.

Although I like some of what Conan does (like &quot;In the year 2000&quot;) I
never feel compelled to watch his show.

&quot;What will Leno do?

Will 'Tonight' host retire gracefully or act like a schmuck?

By Scott D. Pierce
Deseret Morning News

When Jay Leno announced (in 2004) that he was going to retire
(in 2009) and hand &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; over to Conan O'Brien, he made
much of his desire for a smooth, friendly transition.
In his on-air announcement, Leno recalled the controversy
surrounding his ascension to the &quot;Tonight&quot; throne instead of logical
successor David Letterman, saying, &quot;A lot of good friendships were
permanently damaged.&quot;
He insisted, &quot;Quite frankly, I don't want to see anybody go
through that again.&quot;
Dave Bjerke, NbcConan O'Brien chats with Jay Leno on &quot;The Tonight
Show.&quot;      Well, we're two years away, and it's looking more and more
as if there's going to be more rancor. And friendships, if they exist,
will be damaged.
Let's be clear about this. Leno's then-manager not only plotted
against and double-crossed David Letterman (who had boosted Leno's
career by making him a frequent guest on &quot;Late Night&quot;), but she
plotted against Johnny Carson himself. Carson's sudden announcement of
his retirement (made without forewarning his NBC bosses) was at least
in part because he was tired of the behind-the-scenes maneuvering on
behalf of Leno, who was the permanent guest host of &quot;Tonight&quot; at the
time.
Not surprisingly, Letterman wasn't pleased. Neither was Carson.
And Leno has no one to blame but himself for all the rancor.
So if NBC forced the 2009 retirement on him, well, what goes
around comes around.
The announcement that he would step down in 2009 came as more
than a bit of a surprise, given Leno's workaholism. And with that in
mind, it's no surprise that he might not be retiring after all.
There are two scenarios for how this might work out. Leno is
still raking in the cash for NBC, so one theory is that NBC will
renege on its deal with O'Brien and pay him off under the terms of
their 2004 deal — reportedly to the tune of $40 million. (There are
reports that NBC is talking to Jon Stewart about taking over &quot;Late
Night&quot; and being the next successor to Leno. But Stewart has the
perfect vehicle in Comedy Central's &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; and his previous
attempt at a late-night talk show, well, bombed.)
Or Leno could go to another network and compete with O'Brien.
ABC might be interested. Fox is definitely interested, as reported by
the New York Post (which shares ownership with Fox).
Whereas Letterman had sympathy going with him when he went to
CBS after getting blindsided by NBC, Leno would look petulant if he
&quot;retires&quot; from NBC only to move to ABC or Fox.
Whatever happens, O'Brien will land on his feet. He either gets
&quot;The Tonight Show&quot; or he gets $40 million and a job at either ABC or
Fox. (Or maybe even CBS, where he'd be the perfect successor to
Letterman — if Letterman ever chooses to retire.)
And Leno, well, unless he follows through on his promise and
retires gracefully, he'll be giving people the shaft all over again.
It's utterly astonishing that he has been able to maintain a
nice-guy image to this point. If Leno does anything other than retire
gracefully from late-night TV in 2009, that image should be finished
forever.&quot;

http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,665195172,00.html

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&quot;After years of teasing, Carson retired from the “Tonight Show,” on 22
May 1992. The ins and outs of his retirement are beyond fair
discussion here. Still, a few points are worth noting.

Clearly, Carson had five or more good years left. Healthy, though a
life-long chain smoker, he was intellectually acute. He was sharper
and quicker than were any of his competitors. He played tennis, daily,
and traveled widely, with Alexis, something he hadn't done much before
he married her. (Right, at Wimbledon, in 2001.) He drove himself 40
miles to and from work. “That’s a nice 40 mile drive,” says Howard
Lapides, “from Wildlife Drive, in Malibu, to the NBC studios in
Burbank.” Nice, but still an hour each way or more, which Carson did
with ease.

All around, Carson was active and able. Three live shows a week seemed
a fair grind. Larry King (1933-) and Regis Philbin (1931-), at 74 and
76, flourish on network television. Ed McMahon remains active at 85.

The “Tonight Show” structure was stable, the audience growing. Carson,
McMahon and Severinsen fit as a glove. Agitation for change came
mostly from those wishing to replace Carson, on the “Tonight Show,”
except David Letterman. (Right are Doc Severinsen, Johnny Carson and
Ed McMahon in a publicity still from the mid 1970s.)

Carson acted on the notion that discretion is the better part of
valor. He opted to retire, on his own terms. He was dignified to a
fault, and to the end. A lesser person likely would’ve gone kicking
and screaming into the long dead air, and tried to make a comeback.

By 1992, Carson was working on yearly contracts. He seemed fine with
the arrangement. More money surely accompanied each renewal. In the
end, his fierce independence likely didn’t sit well with NBC
executives. Though no one talks, on the record, Carson may have
preferred to stay a few more years, but NBC wanted the show back.

Some markers point to the ouster of Carson. He declined the offer to
retire in prime time, with lots of big name celebrities and ballyhoo,
preferring to leave as he came, on the “Tonight Show.” Usually a team
player, Carson didn’t retire in a way that would most benefit NBC, and
Leno. Fifty million people watched the last “Tonight Show.” The
audience for a prime time retirement party might have been the most
watched television show, ever. He declined to let NBC benefit thrice:
him out, replaced by a controllable host and a huge prime-time payday.
This is telling.

Carson didn’t guest on the “Tonight Show,” after he retired. Jack Paar
and Steve Allen guested, often, on the show after leaving. Carson
(right) made an “unscheduled” appearance on “Late Night, with David
Letterman,” in 1993. He went so far as to sit behind the desk. There
was also a brief cameo on “Letterman,” in 1995. The inaction and
action are telling.

Carson wisely stayed out of the selection process for his successor.
It's likely NBC preferred it that way. Unofficially, he advised
Letterman, but not Leno. As permanent guest host, Jay Leno had an
advantage, but not the seal of approval.

Carson had told second wife, Joanne Copeland, NBC wanted somebody it
could control. Leno was the obvious choice, to replace Carson, on the
&quot;Tonight Show.&quot; Letterman, compared with Leno, was a loose cannon,
creatively.

The cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine was the seal of approval for
Letterman: he's heir to Johnny Carson. Nobody got anything from
Carson, without hard work, Letterman earned the approval.&quot;

“Carson was the last of the Steve Allen line,” says Dick Summer, who
currently hosts a syndicated podcast, “A Good Night’s Sleep,” and you
see it in the last two shows. “You could trust him to be there, even
in your bedroom. You knew he’d share some laughs with you, while
pretending he didn’t notice the woman in bed with you, until he gave
you one quick wink, just before “Doc” started the theme music out.
Leno [is a] comedian. Carson was Carson, the ultimate pro, always in
control, until that single tear, at the very end, showed he was even
more human than we ever knew. I loved [him]. You did, too. Carson was
you and me, the way we wished we could be.”

&gt;preferred to stay a few more years, but NBC wanted the show back.

&gt;Some markers point to the ouster of Carson. He declined the offer to
&gt;retire in prime time, with lots of big name celebrities and ballyhoo,
&gt;preferring to leave as he came, on the “Tonight Show.” Usually a team
&gt;player, Carson didn’t retire in a way that would most benefit NBC, and
&gt;Leno. Fifty million people watched the last “Tonight Show.” The
&gt;audience for a prime time retirement party might have been the most
&gt;watched television show, ever. He declined to let NBC benefit thrice:
&gt;him out, replaced by a controllable host and a huge prime-time payday.
&gt;This is telling.

&gt;Carson didn’t guest on the “Tonight Show,” after he retired. Jack Paar
&gt;and Steve Allen guested, often, on the show after leaving. Carson
&gt;(right) made an “unscheduled” appearance on “Late Night, with David
&gt;Letterman,” in 1993. He went so far as to sit behind the desk. There
&gt;was also a brief cameo on “Letterman,” in 1995. The inaction and
&gt;action are telling.

&gt;Carson wisely stayed out of the selection process for his successor.
&gt;It's likely NBC preferred it that way. Unofficially, he advised
&gt;Letterman, but not Leno. As permanent guest host, Jay Leno had an
&gt;advantage, but not the seal of approval.

&gt;Carson had told second wife, Joanne Copeland, NBC wanted somebody it
&gt;could control. Leno was the obvious choice, to replace Carson, on the
&gt;&quot;Tonight Show.&quot; Letterman, compared with Leno, was a loose cannon,
&gt;creatively.

&gt;The cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine was the seal of approval for
&gt;Letterman: he's heir to Johnny Carson. Nobody got anything from
&gt;Carson, without hard work, Letterman earned the approval.&quot;

&gt;“Carson was the last of the Steve Allen line,” says Dick Summer, who
&gt;currently hosts a syndicated podcast, “A Good Night’s Sleep,” and you
&gt;see it in the last two shows. “You could trust him to be there, even
&gt;in your bedroom. You knew he’d share some laughs with you, while
&gt;pretending he didn’t notice the woman in bed with you, until he gave
&gt;you one quick wink, just before “Doc” started the theme music out.
&gt;Leno [is a] comedian. Carson was Carson, the ultimate pro, always in
&gt;control, until that single tear, at the very end, showed he was even
&gt;more human than we ever knew. I loved [him]. You did, too. Carson was
&gt;you and me, the way we wished we could be.”

Some small factual errors in this paragraph:

Carson appeared twice on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;: May 16,
1985, in L.A., and his surprise walk-on to announce his retirement on
May 23, 1991. Neither time did he sit behind the desk (though for the
'85 appearance, he folded out his own cardboard desktop to sit behind
in his guest chair).

The desk bit described in your cite occured on &quot;Late Show with David
Letterman,&quot; on May 13, 1994, not 1993, during the first time LS was in
L.A.

He never made a &quot;brief cameo&quot; in 1995.

What year did Carson make the brief cameo in the taped remote bit during
the California shows?

That would be 1994. He also appeared on the LSwDL on Friday, May 13,
1994.
