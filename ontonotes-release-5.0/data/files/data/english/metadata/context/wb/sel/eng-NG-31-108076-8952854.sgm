Hey, it's a &quot;fighting fish.&quot; That's martial, right?

I just bought a Betta today so as to use that 1 gal tank I got when we first
got goldfish (before I knew what goldfish space requirements actually were).
Athena (my daughter) named him &quot;Sam.&quot; Kolordny knows why.  Here are some
pictures:

http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g206/dburkhead/sam071027b.jpg For this
one, I made some effort with the graphics software to enhance the color to
something closer to what the fish actually looks like.  In the other photos
the color is more &quot;muted&quot; than reality.

Now, if I can just get that head mounted laser properly waterproofed....

Nice. I haven't had one of those in forever. I tried breeding them for
a while, didn't have a very good survival percentage tho. Now I just
raise my own kids, and my percentages are a lot better with
that... ;-)

If you mean the survival percentage of the fry, that's entirely normal.  If
you mean survival of adult bettas, as in many cases (OOTC--such as in
martial arts) there are _lots_ of myths floating around.  Frex, Betta's are
not happy in those little cups.  They can survive in them, that's about it.
(And the person who came up with that &quot;Betta in a vase&quot; thing should be
shot--Betta supposedly eats the plant roots and the Betta waste fertilizes
the plant in a closed cycle.  Problem with that is Bettas are _carnivores_.
They may nibble on the roots but they get no nutritional value from them.)

Yeah, I meant the fry. When I had multiple tanks going I did each one
as a biotope, all plants and animals from the same region. I had
amazon, congo, malawi, and SE asia. Tried a marine tank, but it was
just as I was getting into MA and started to fade on the aquarium
hobby. I would like to do more again, but I can't keep up on my 38
community that I have left. Maybe someday when the kids can help out a
bit.

You'd probably get better results if switched back from sports mode into
auto.

it.
