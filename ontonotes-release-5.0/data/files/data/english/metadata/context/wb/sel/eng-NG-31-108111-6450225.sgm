Hello everyone... I also posted this same question on
rec.pets.dogs.breeds and waiting to get an answer from that group as
well. But let's see what you guys think?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

Ok... I don't want to make a big deal out of this but--hear me out...
and I really need you guys to keep an open mind.

Our little (teacup) chihuahua--Spike--likes to bark at nothing. I
mean, she's barking at something--but there is nothing there,
nothing.  My wife and I have observed her closely now for about nine
months.  She's not tilting her little head up as if to try and hear a
sound that we can't. She's barking at something because she barks in
one particular direction, exactly the way she barks when someone she
doesn't recognize comes to our house.

Now this is the part that almost made me take her to the vet. The
other night, I heard her barking angrily--you can tell. I looked into
the living room and as usual, nothing there. Then she started running
around in circles, glancing back as she was running as though she were
being chased--obviously scared because she was yelping and barking at
the same time. She ran so fast and erratic that she crashed into the
side of the couch. I walked into the living room and of course,
nothing there.  I picked her up and she was trembling--more so than
she usually does. She made so much noise that my wife came out of her
bath to see if everything was ok.

We have a cat--Charlie that like to tease her ocasionaly. But Charlie
was on top of the fridge looking pretty scared himself, that's where
Charlie goes when he gets scared.

Ok, I'm a rational person and I'm not crazy, nor do I like to jump to
conclusions but I've never seen a dog behave this way. Can this be
some sort of anxiety? mental illness, perhaps? she's lovable and
playful, she's as bratty as she needs to be and really smart. I don't
get it?

Folks, this is a very serious question and I'm deeply concerned
because I really don't know what she's doing and we're really
curious.

Has anyone seen their dog do anything like this?

Thanks,

Alex

Dogs don't act this way for nothing at all.  Are you sure she's not hearing
noises in the walls or floor?  Maybe mice or something that you arne't
picking up on.

Like I said, we've been observing her for the past nine months. At
first we thought it was shadows and lights. We eliminated that by
making sure that the curtains were closed at night. Besides, she
doesn't bark at the windows.  Mice? no--we don't have mice, Charlie
(cat) has eliminated that threat. Bugs? No, again... Charlie deals
with them effectively.  Noises? I don't know... I can understand
noises if all she did was bark at the walls or windows or the door.
But the other night, she behaved as though she was being chased.

But whoever that wizard-dude was that answered my post first, said
that it was a panic attack--anxiety. I know that when people have
anxiety and panic attacks, we think there's someone following us
around. We freak out, make things up, imagine things that aren't real,
hallucinate--something bordering on schizophrenia.  Chihuahuas are
jumpy, excitable. In humans, that's a symptom of a general anxiety
disorder (GAD). But do dogs go through the same mental trauma?

I don't know... I thought this group would share some insights.

If you have fire house alarms, you could check the batteries to make sure
they aren't dead.  When they are dead, the alarm makes this constant ticking
noise at even intervals.  Some people don't hear the noise, but it drives me

Yes, some dogs suffer from biochemical imbalances that are
similar to humans.  Dr. Karen Overall is one veterinary
researcher who investigates the use of psychoactive meds for dog
behavioral problems like anxiety and ocd (google on her name). I
don't think you can diagnose panic disorder from the description
that you gave, but it's one possibility.  If she's not hearing
mice or bugs or something in the walls or floor, she might be
hallucinating.  Or is it possible that she's losing her hearing
and responding this way to sounds that sound "different" to her?

Have you had her evaluated by a vet?  Discussed her problems with
one?  That's the first step you should take whenever you see an
unexplained behavioral change - there's often an underlying
physical problem.

Interesting possibility.  I can easily ignore our fire alarms'
beeps when the batteries are low, but the dogs go bonkers when it
happens.

Jerry Howe, is " that wizard-dude" who suggested the "panic attack"
idea. While I consider that explanation plausible, and am amazed that
Howe came up with it, he is generally best filtered out. Period. No one
in any dog-related news group I know of is interested in hearing about
Howe or seeing him quoted.

Well... I did think that "the Wizard dude's" explanation reply to my

theory on my dog hallucinating or I start believing in ghosts--which
is what "most" people that I've told this story to suggest.  I don't

You may have mice in your walls. We found out that we have a raccoon
that likes to perch on a little roof overhang. One of our dogs was
alerting us to this situation (we thought she was just letting us know
the paper carrier was delivering). One day the paper carrier called us
to tell us about the raccoon.

Your dog may also have a form of dementia.

This NG is specifically for dog rescue.  I hate cats
and never give a cat an even break--unless they just
happen to break in the middle.

When I started to work at the animal shelter, cleaning
kennels, I was asked if I liked cats. I replied
enthusiastically, "Yes, if they are cooked  right!"

I've never had to work with the cats! :-)

We're all different.

&gt;&gt; What is the best way to perform home euthanasia on a dog?
&gt;&gt; I want to put down the family pet but I don't have a lot

&gt;&gt; I will.

&gt;&gt; All replies appreciated.
&gt;&gt; Andrew Nanton

That's a lot of wisdom--for a "top poster".

$50.00 for euthanasia and cremation is a real bargain.
The same service would be about $120.00 for a 40# dog,
in this area.

You know, I don't believe in beating around the bush much.
I believe we ought to say what's on our mind. I see you
hold a similar view. Of course, having a small mind
complicates things. That was quite a generalization you
made: "Anybody that can't afford that ($50.00 to have
their pet killed) shouldn't have a pet in the first place!"

Andrew Nanton didn't mention that the family pet was sick
or aged. So, for all we know, the family is saying good
bye to their pet because they can't afford $50.00 to keep
it alive!

If that is the case, they probably don't have $50.00 to
kill their pet! Either way, they are trying to do the
right thing.

Because of money, my pet ownership days are running out.
I hope you are never faced with that situation.

Whatever it takes.

I almost replied, "WRONG!," and offered this explanation:
I sometimes makes little cuts under my watchband, with a
razor blade.

Although there is some physical pain, I feel triumphant
because Michael Ball is getting a little dose of what he
deserves.  So, it is a pleasure.

How odd; even sensations that most people would rate as
bad, sick, horrible, etc., can be and are pleasures--if
we want them.  I never thought of those insignificant
little cuts specifically as pleasures, but they are!

I love it when little streams of blood trickle down my arm.
And I like the reminder pain over the following couple of
days, during the healing process.

Prozac affects everyone differently.  Please, don't allow
other's Prozac experiences to influence you too much.

I take another medicine that makes me tired; so, I can't
attribute fatigue to Prozac.  FWIW, fatigue is a common
complaint.  I don't believe Prozac has any effect on one's
immune system.  In my humble opinion, Tabasco Sauce and
jalapeno peppers are far more effective than any flu shot!
:-) I haven't had a cold in years. :-)

Wait a minute! A cat lover!?  Oh, well, I suppose someone has to...

"Rage"?  "Again"?  I wonder if a lot of folks get angry
at their therapists, and why?  My therapist used to try
to convince me that Michael Ball is not so bad.  That
annoyed me so much!  I'm not sure what bothered me most:
the fact that I couldn't seem to convince him of the truth;
or the thought that he was trying to trick me; or something
entirely different.

He was a nice guy, but I just couldn't get him to see the
real me.  Ha! If I had, he might have stopped wasting his
effort!  We eventually began working on his problems.  :-)

Misplaced aggression?  Is that why we tend to attack
some of those who want to "help" us?

I hope he tells you "something good" too! If you were
asked to list the top three good things you'd like for
him to tell you, what would they be?

I put myself in your shoes for a minute and discovered
that question is not as simple as it sounds. We don't
always know how to heal the pain or even what is causing
the pain: we only know that we hurt.

Maybe your doctor will tell you that it is not your skin
that you want to escape, but everything inside of that
skin" your..."self"!

I'm reminded of a time in my life when I applied to enter
a sex reassignment program. Fortunately, during the initial
evaluation process, it was determined that I wasn't transsexual,
and didn't want to be a woman: I just didn't want to be Michael
Ball.

That was a day of considerable relief, but also one of great
sadness and hopelessness. There would be no Andrea Beck, and
for the time being, no escape from MB.

Best wishes tomorrow. I hope you'll tell us how things went.

&gt; Hello everyone... I also posted this same question on
&gt; rec.pets.dogs.breeds and waiting to get an answer from that group as
&gt; well. But let's see what you guys think?

&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ­---------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Ok... I don't want to make a big deal out of this but--hear me out...
&gt; and I really need you guys to keep an open mind.

&gt; Our little (teacup) chihuahua--Spike--likes to bark at nothing. I
&gt; mean, she's barking at something--but there is nothing there,
&gt; nothing.  My wife and I have observed her closely now for about nine
&gt; months.  She's not tilting her little head up as if to try and hear a
&gt; sound that we can't. She's barking at something because she barks in
&gt; one particular direction, exactly the way she barks when someone she
&gt; doesn't recognize comes to our house.

&gt; Now this is the part that almost made me take her to the vet. The
&gt; other night, I heard her barking angrily--you can tell. I looked into
&gt; the living room and as usual, nothing there. Then she started running
&gt; around in circles, glancing back as she was running as though she were
&gt; being chased--obviously scared because she was yelping and barking at
&gt; the same time. She ran so fast and erratic that she crashed into the
&gt; side of the couch. I walked into the living room and of course,
&gt; nothing there.  I picked her up and she was trembling--more so than
&gt; she usually does. She made so much noise that my wife came out of her
&gt; bath to see if everything was ok.

&gt; We have a cat--Charlie that like to tease her ocasionaly. But Charlie
&gt; was on top of the fridge looking pretty scared himself, that's where
&gt; Charlie goes when he gets scared.

&gt; Ok, I'm a rational person and I'm not crazy, nor do I like to jump to
&gt; conclusions but I've never seen a dog behave this way. Can this be
&gt; some sort of anxiety? mental illness, perhaps? she's lovable and
&gt; playful, she's as bratty as she needs to be and really smart. I don't
&gt; get it?

&gt; Folks, this is a very serious question and I'm deeply concerned
&gt; because I really don't know what she's doing and we're really
&gt; curious.

&gt; Has anyone seen their dog do anything like this?

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Alex

Do you happen to mice.My dogs holly and chris they are jack russells
they have done that type of barking.I discovered that barking at a
mouse.I had put a mouse trap in the cabnit near where they were
barking.
