If you are having trouble finding a subject in the table of contents
below, a text search of this document may be helpful. If reading this
on the World Wide Web, choose Edit: Find or other similar command from
the toolbar in your browser.

Note: Map references are now given in latitude and longitude, due to
most online mapping services easily incorporating the data. Use one of
the following URLs to get a map (* = latitude and ** = longitude, the
latter of which will be a negative number [west] for nearly all of
North America):

http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=*,**

1.1

What is misc.transport.road?

misc.transport.road is an unmoderated (uncensored, uneditable) Usenet
newsgroup in which individuals may discuss issues pertaining to road
transportation and design. Read misc.transport.road using Google
Groups Usenet archive: http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road
. Usenet is described at http://www.faqs.org/usenet/ ,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet , http://www.smr-usenet.com/tech/about.shtml
, and http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/netbook/ (1997). Sep 13, 2005

1.1.1

Q: What types of postings are acceptable on misc.transport.road?

A: The charter is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----
misc.transport.road is for discussion of all aspects of road/highway
transportation and design not included in other groups (such as
misc.transport.trucking and misc.transport.urban-transit).
Commercial posts and advertising are not appropriate for this group,
with the following exceptions:
* individuals seeking to buy or sell books, magazines, collector's
items, memorabilia, etc. are permitted.
* announcements of commercial or semi-commercial web sites and other
resources are permitted.
All such commercial or advertising posts should be brief, should not
be posted repeatedly and must be clearly related to the topics the
group is meant to discuss. Frequent reposting of the same or similar
articles is specifically prohibited.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The charter is archived at http://faqs.org/usenet/news.announce.newgroups/misc/misc.transport.misc

1.1.2

Q: Why are people talking about (insert offtopic subject) on m.t.r?

A:

Radio/TV stations | Gas stations/restaurants/stores | License plates |
Geographical names | Government units | Area codes | ZIP codes | Time
Zones

Radio/TV stations: This started because of people talking about it in
roadtrip reports; it usually starts as an on-topic thread and drifts
off-topic. Go to http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/audio/tvq.html for a list
of American TV stations (this also accesses radio station
information). See also http://dmoz.org/Arts/Radio/Resources/Guides/ ,
http://dmoz.org/Arts/Radio/Internet/Directories/ , and
http://dmoz.org/Arts/Television/Stations/

Gas stations/restaurants/stores: Gas stations came first as offshoots
of roadtrip reports, generally to mention prices of fuel; now new
threads have been started about current and former restaurant and
store chains. A site with links to nearly all active U.S. retail
chains is located at http://www.synergos-tech.com/crossroads/business.htm
. More information may be found at http://dmoz.org/Business/Retail_Trade/
. Information about old supermarket chains may be found at
http://www.groceteria.net/ . Malls and other retail outlets no longer
extant or with few locations remaining are discussed at http://www.deadmalls.com/
. A timeline of significant events in retail in the 20th Century is at
http://retailtrafficmag.com/ar/retail_cheers_years_th/ . Stuckey's
information is at http://www.stuckeys.com/ , http://www.stuckonstuckeys.com/
, and http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Rash/stuckey.html . Gas prices may
be located at http://www.gaspricewatch.com/ , http://www.gasbuddy.com/
, or various sites at http://dmoz.org/Home/Consumer_Information/Automobiles/Fuels/Price_Com...
. Gas station memorabilia is the subject of http://www.oldgas.com/ . A
discussion group about oil company history is at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oilhistory/
.

License plates: Obviously license plates are visible anytime one uses
a road. For a directory of webpages showing photos of current
standard, current special, and old license plates, go to
http://dmoz.org/Recreation/Collecting/Themes/Transportation/Automobil...
.

Geographical names: These names arise when posters discuss the
ownership of a certain road or the style of boundary signs. One may
use http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnis/web_query.gnis_web_query_form to
find all geographic names in the United States, and
http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/search/search_e.php for all names in
Canada. http://www.wordways.com/commonp.htm lists the number of
occurences of certain place names in the U.S. (&quot;Midway&quot; occurs 211
times as-is and 250 times with slight variations, while &quot;Fairview&quot;,
occurs only 201 times as-is but 256 times with slight variations; the
name which occurs in the most states is &quot;Riverside&quot;, only absent from
AK, HI, LA, and OK). A compilation map with names created by two or
more U.S. states due to the position near those states is located at
http://www.geocities.com/mapguygk07/Misc/Statelines/ (see also
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Geographic_portmanteaus ).
A listing of the most frequently misspelled U.S. city names is at
http://www.epodunk.com/top10/misspelled/ , which includes Cincinnati.
A partial listing of names of towns with the same names as nearby
towns in adjacent US states is at http://www.zifyoip.com/stuff/citypairs.txt
.

Government units: These come up due to the same reasons as
geographical names. Posters from areas without certain units become
confused over their meanings when they are mentioned. The United
States Bureau of the Census assigns two main types of unit below the
county-level: Municipalities and townships.
Municipalities are governments that are traditionally based around a
single concentration of population. &quot;City&quot; is the common name for a
large municipality; smaller ones include &quot;village,&quot; &quot;town,&quot; and
&quot;borough,&quot; though places labelled by those names might not actually be
incorporated. Most municipalities have an elected council and
sometimes a mayor.
Townships are direct divisions of counties. They exist only in the
Northeast and Midwest U.S., and are generally unincorporated except in
New Jersey. (There are also land survey divisions called &quot;townships&quot;,
but these are not usually the type being discussed -- see
http://www.ca.blm.gov/pa/cadastral/meridian.html for a map of areas
which use this type.) &quot;Town&quot; in this context refers to the same type
of entity, just with a different name, used in New England, New York
State, and Wisconsin, though towns in New England are incorporated,
are similar to cities, and often are more powerful than townships are.
This &quot;town&quot; is not to be confused with the more general meaning of
&quot;town&quot; above. Townships/towns are usually governed by an elected board
of &quot;supervisors,&quot; &quot;trustees&quot; or &quot;selectmen,&quot; which in New England are
sometimes supplemented with town meetings. See also the Census
Bureau's Geographic Areas Reference Manual, Chapter 8 (
http://www.census.gov/geo/www/garm.html ), and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township
A special circumstance is home rule, defined as &quot;self-government or
limited autonomy in internal affairs by a dependent political unit (as
a territory or municipality)&quot; (Merriam-Webster), which usually comes
up when discussing routes in a state system which otherwise would be
fully state-maintained. A home rule reference is Home Rule in America:
A Fifty-State Handbook by Krane/Rigos/Hill, ISBN 1568022816 (
http://www.cqpress.com/product/Home-Rule-in-America-A-Fifty-State.html
, abridged table at http://www.cla.sc.edu/poli/civiced/Reference%20Materials/US_home_rule...
).
A special type of municipality is the independent city. These are
cities separate from any county. In the United States, the independent
cities are Baltimore; St. Louis; Carson City, NV; and all cities in VA
( http://www.vipnet.org/cmsportal/localgov_old.htm#city ). Washington
is wholly within the District of Columbia and therefore separate from
all states as well as counties (DC has had no counties for a long
time).
Counties have &quot;collectors&quot;, those who make a roster of ones visited.
Many roadgeeks travel as many roads as they do because they are county
collectors. See http://www.extramilerclub.org/ , http://www.countycounters.com/
, and http://www.mob-rule.com/counties/ .
For more information, see http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/browse_frm/thread/...
, especially message 16 ( http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/266bc5b127d59585
, message ID 0014749c.4288b ... @usw-ex0104-033.remarq.com ) , the
Census Bureau website at http://www.census.gov/ , and Rand McNally's
Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide, available at most larger
libraries or at http://www.randmcnally.com/rmc/promo/promoCAO.jsp .

A list of each state's smallest municipality per the 2000 U.S. Census
is located at http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/b6237468990d6bbc
(12/6/05 - Message ID:
1133924285.930983.52 ... @z14g2000cwz.googlegroups.com ).

Area codes: Usually a secondary off-shoot of the above. Thorough area
code information is at http://www.lincmad.com/ and http://www.nanpa.com/
. See also http://dmoz.org/Reference/Directories/Address_and_Phone_Numbers/Area_...
and http://dmoz.org/Business/Telecommunications/Resources/Numbering/ .

ZIP codes: Similar to area code discussion. ZIP codes are American
postal codes, 5 digits long with an optional 4-digit suffix (&quot;ZIP&quot;
stands for &quot;Zone Improvement Plan&quot;). http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/ is the
United States Postal Service page which includes an FAQ and a locator;
http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/zipdecode/ is an unofficial map
locator.
Canadian postal codes are covered at http://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pcl/bin/advanced-e.asp
.

Time zones: These are usually mentioned in reference to signs
designating them or to old maps which show former boundary alignments.
http://www.worldtimezone.com/ shows boundaries worldwide; http://www.time.gov/
has US boundaries as well as links to pages on time zone history
(official zone and boundary definitions are at
http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_03/49cfr71_03.html ).
Standardized daylight-saving time in the US was created by the Uniform
Time Act of 1966 http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/260.html ; states
observing year-round standard time (AZ, HI, formerly IN, possibly
future ME) are documented at http://www.mccsc.edu/time.html . A
history of daylight-saving time is at http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/
. See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time

Making repeated off-topic posts in any newsgroup is generally
considered bad Netiquette ( http://faqs.org/usenet/ ;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette ).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

2 Frequently used abbreviations

2di, 3di = 2 or 3-digit interstate; occasionally used to mean 2 or 3-
digit of any route type, but in this FAQ it means 2 or 3-digit
interstate (2 digit interstate); 2di usually refers to all mainlines,
which include 1 digit routes; &quot;odd/even 3di&quot; often refers to the 1st
digit, not the last, since the 1st digit in a 3di defines its function
- e.g. I-235 may be called an even 3di
2dus, 3dus = 2 or 3-digit U.S. Route; as above, 2dus usually refers to
all 1- and 2-digit mainlines
AADT = Average Annual Daily Traffic. Counts for selected urban U.S.
highways may be found at http://www.webspawner.com/users/beachbuminda650/
; in addition, state DOT websites (see entry below) may list counts
for all highways which they maintain.
AASHTO = American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (sets US and Interstate route numbering, among other duties)
http://www.transportation.org/
A-nn = Autoroute nn (used in Quebec and some European countries)
Alt = Alternate
BANANA = Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody
BGS = Big Green Sign -- those huge signs on freeways that tell drivers
where to go (also BBS for blue or brown, BYS for yellow, BOS for
orange; and SGS for small, LGS for little, etc.). The section in the
MUTCD (see entry below) that covers them is Chapter 2E (
http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003/part2/part2e1.htm ).
Bus = Business
Byp = Bypass
C/D = Collector/distributor. These are roadways which parallel a
roadway of a freeway, and are used within interchanges or interchange
complexes to separate exits and entrances from the main roadway so
that all weaving can occur on the C/D roadway. These differ from
frontage roads in that they are always one-way freeway-grade, whereas
frontage roads can have at-grade intersections and driveway access.

3 Common Road and Highway Terms

3.1 Breezewood

This term refers to a stretch of surface road that connects two
different freeways, or two different stretches of a single one,
without any direct connection via an interchange. Usually, these roads
are filled with traffic lights, gas stations, fast food joints, etc.
The original example is in Breezewood, Pennsylvania, where I-70
follows surface US 30 for a quarter mile where it meets the
Pennsylvania Turnpike. See http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/tollroad.htm
or http://www.pahighways.com/interstates/I70.html for more details.
Breezewood is the subject of a 2002 documentary by Jason Hutt called
Breezewood, Pennsylvania (see 12.4.1 ). Oct 3, 2004

3.2 Business Routes

A loop or spur off a highway into the center of a town. Business
routes generally have the same number of the main highway, but have
special &quot;Business&quot; signs. Interstate business routes, for example,
have special green shields, sometimes offset from the rest of a BGS by
what MI's DOT calls an &quot;accent square&quot; (see
http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part2/part2d1.htm#section2D11 ).
Most interstate business routes are surface streets, usually old
alignments of US highways. Some are freeways, like the I-80 business
loop in Sacramento (see http://www.cahighways.org/049-056.html#051 and
http://www.interstate-guide.com/business-routes/bus80.html for details
on and history of that particular route), but don't meet more
technical interstate standards like ramp spacing. Sometimes but not
often Interstate business routes are referred to as &quot;green
Interstates&quot; in certain areas. The only Interstate business routes
from the same parent to meet each other are I-44 BS and I-44 BL in MO
( http://www.cosmos-monitor.com/road/sign/mo/routeindex.html#BS44 ).
US and state business routes are often the original route through the
city. A list of Interstate business routes is at
http://www.interstate-guide.com/business-routes/ and a list of U.S.
business and other auxiliary routes is at http://www.us-highways.com/usban.htm
. Jul 18, 2006

3.3 Button Copy

Button copy is a term used to describe letters and characters on signs
with several inlaid reflectors in them, providing better visibility at
night. States started phasing them out on signs at the end of the 20th
Century, opting for reflective sign sheeting for the whole sign
instead. See http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/3d4e957b8741f740
(Message-ID: 3A3D4D1F.58FD0 ... @earthlink.net ). Jun 27, 2005

3.4 Control City

Usually associated with the Interstate Highway system, a control city
is usually identified as the city on a sign which drivers are most
likely to be headed. They appear as the bottom city on distance signs,
on &quot;pull-through&quot; BGSes, and in signs leading to the freeway at
interchanges. A complete list of control cities that AASHTO recommends
for the Interstate system, as well as a more complete description, can
be found at http://home.roadrunner.com/~pwolf/controlcities.html .

The cities on the exit signs on freeways are often called control
cities as well on the newsgroup, as are the signs that say &quot;City A -&gt;&quot;
at an intersection, though these are officially known as
&quot;destinations&quot;. MUTCD sections: http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part2/part2e1.htm#section2E12
(freeway/expressway), http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part2/part2d2.htm#section2D34
(surface road) Oct 4, 2007

3.4.1

Q: What are the longest distances listed to a particular control city?

A:The longest distance on a conventional mileage sign, and one of only
three four-digit instances, is probably 1007 miles for Los Angeles on
I-40 in NM. Others of note are 1508 km (937 mi) for Yellowknife, NT
( http://albertaroads.homestead.com/transcanada/hwy16/hwy16w1.html -
the largest number on a conventional distance sign), 857 (mi) for El
Paso on I-10 in TX, and 1065 km (662 mi) for Fairbanks, AK on the
Alaska Highway in YT ( http://www.teresco.org/pics/signs/20010613/84km-close.jpg
). Other very-long-distance controls include New York City in Ohio
( http://www.roadfan.com/nycohio.html ), on the New York State Thruway
just into NY State, in Baltimore, and in Boston; Miami in VA; Tampa on
I-285 in Atlanta; Memphis in Chicago; Tulsa in St. Louis; Los Angeles
in the San Francisco Bay area; Manteo, NC on US 64 at the other end of
NC; Denver in eastern KS; and various large western U.S. cities from
other large western U.S. cities which contain no cities of note
between them.

For non-conventional control cities, there are signs at highway
termini which list distances to the other terminus. These include US
41's north end ( http://www-personal.umich.edu/~aleskiw/roadgeek/Gallery1.htm
and http://www.geocities.com/usend4049/End041/end041.htm ) and I-70's
east end ( http://www.m-plex.com/roads/trips/i70et_parkandride.html -
bottom), as well as both ends of I-40 ( http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-040.html
) and US 50 ( http://www.geocities.com/usend5059/End050/end050.htm ).
Also, signs on the Ohio Turnpike list Chicago ( http://www.roadfan.com/ohtpkchi.jpg
) and New York City &quot;VIA TURNPIKES&quot;.

See also 10.3.2 . Mar 25, 2005

3.4.2

Q: Which control city for an Interstate has the smallest population?

A: The smallest places follow, with 2000 Census populations:

Breezewood, PA (I-70): c. 200 (unincorporated, estimated by Rand
McNally)
Delaware Water Gap, PA (I-80): 744 (may refer to the geologic feature
rather than the locality)
Valley Forge, PA (I-76): 1200
Hancock, MD (I-70): 1725
New Stanton, PA (I-70): 1906
Limon, CO (I-70): 2071

Other notably small controls also appear elsewhere in PA as well as in
CA and MS. Jun 16, 2005

3.5 Decommission

To revoke a number from a particular highway. Normally this is
accompanied by downloading to the next lower government body, although
sometimes it remains as a secret state route, or a US route becomes a
state route.

3.6 Interchanges

Interchanges are grade-separated intersections with one-way ramps
connecting the two roads. They are often also called &quot;exits&quot; though
that term may also apply to a single off-ramp (road carrying traffic
from the freeway to the crossroad). The many different types are
outlined at http://www.kurumi.com/roads/interchanges/ . Hybrid
interchange-intersection conditions also exist, such as Jughandles,
common in NJ ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jughandle ); Michigan
Lefts, common in MI ( http://www.michiganhighways.org/indepth/michigan_left.html
), known in Chicago as &quot;Boulevard Turns&quot;; or &quot;channelization&quot;. Sep 13,
2005

3.6.1 SPUI

One of the more talked about types of interchanges, a SPUI (single-
point urban interchange) looks like a standard diamond interchange,
but the ramps work in a much different way, allowing traffic to flow
easier by making opposing left turns concurrent. A list is available
at http://web.archive.org/web/20021218091949/http://web.mit.edu/spui/www...
(page no longer active). See also http://www4.trb.org/trb/crp.nsf/All+Projects/NCHRP+3-40
/ http://64.118.69.9/acb1/showdetl.cfm?DID=92&amp;Product;_ID=2277 (&quot;Single
Point Urban Interchange Design and Operations Analysis&quot;, National
Cooperative Highway Research Program [NCHRP] Report 345) as well as
Section 2 . Mar 11, 2006

3.6.2

Q: What is the longest distance between interchanges?

A: In the U.S., there are 51 miles southbound and 49 miles northbound
between Exit 193 (US-441/FL-60) and Exits 242/244 (US-192/441), and 41
miles between Exit 152 (FL-70) and Exit 193, on Florida's Turnpike.
There are 37 miles between Exit 4 (Bonneville Speedway) and Exit 41
(Knolls) on I-80 in western Utah, the longest stretch on both a free
highway and a publicly-numbered highway (Florida's Turnpike is
officially FL-91 but there are no references to that in the field).
There are also no services between these two I-80 exits, just a pair
of rest areas (the two Florida's Turnpike stretches listed above both
have a median service area along them). See Question 6.10 for the
longest stretch between services on an Interstate and Question 6.10.1
for the longest stretch on an Interstate between other Interstates.

3.6.3 Exit Lists

An exit list, also called an exit guide, is a listing of all the exits
on a section of freeway/tollway/expressway. It is used to find the
information about an exit before one exits. Sometimes exit lists are
also made for surface streets with some degree of access control (for
example arterials with jughandles in New Jersey). The exit lists are
typically made by people who want to make them (roadgeeks). They use
maps and personal experience when creating the exit guide. A few state
departments of transportation make bare-bones text exit lists. Some of
the exit lists have services listed at exits, while others just list
the exits. Most list the cities and towns the exit leads to. Rest
areas are usually listed. Some of the service area listings even
include what types of food and gas (petrol) establishments may be
found at those service areas (service plazas/oases). Links to exit
lists are at http://www.ajfroggie.com/triskele/ . Nov 18, 2003

3.6.5 Volleyball

An interchange between two roads whose ramps meet at at-grade
intersections on a third level, those at-grade intersections being the
only ones in the interchange. Not an official term. See
http://www.kurumi.com/roads/interchanges/volleyball.html Jan 3, 2003

3.6.6 One-quadrant ramp

As named by AASHTO (see Question 4.2) in their &quot;Green Book&quot;, aka A
Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (2001 edition:
Publication Code GDHS-4, ASIN 1560511567), this describes a simple two-
way connecting road between two main roads which themselves are grade-
separated. While it is identified as an interchange and displays a
main characteristic of one (the separation), it is unusual in that all
eight turn movements traverse two at-grade intersections, one at each
end of the connector (unless right-turn ramps at one or both of the
intersections are employed), whereas generally at least one of the
main roads in an interchange only connects to the other with sharp-
angled offramps that do not allow cross traffic.
A sampling of locations of these is located at

3.6.7 Truck escape ramps

A discussion of escape ramp construction/composition and locations is
at http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/browse_frm/thread/...
(6/30/05), and signage standards are at
http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part2/part2c.htm#section2C13 .
Jul 19, 2005

3.7 Jersey Barrier

A concrete divider on freeways with a cross-section in the shape on an
inverted Y. More information is available at http://www.roadstothefuture.com/Jersey_Barrier.html
.

3.8 Mileposts

Mileposts are signs placed every mile on roads which show the mileage
from some point along the route (usually a terminus or a political
boundary.) The MUTCD standard is to use a green vertical sign with the
word &quot;MILE&quot; at the top. Some states use them only on Interstates;
others put them on other routes as well. California restarts its
mileposts (which it calls postmiles) at each county line, including
interstates. Many other states do this too, but not for interstates.
Kilometerposts are used in places using kilometers. Images are at
http://members.aol.com/rcmoeur/d10.html and
http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003/part2/fig2d-13_longdesc.htm . There
is also a 1967 publication by the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety called &quot;Mileposting&quot;. See also 10.3.1 and 10.3.2 .

3.9 Multiplex

When two routes &quot;join up&quot; and are co-signed. Other similar terms used
are &quot;concurrency&quot; and &quot;overlap&quot; (&quot;multiplex&quot; seems to be a creation of
m.t.r while the others are actually used by DOTs). A secret multiplex
occurs when one route is unsigned on the concurrent section. A useless/
unnecessary multiplex occurs when one or both of the routes ends while
multiplexed; one of them could have ended at the other. A wrong-way
multiplex occurs when the 2 routes are signed in opposite directions
(e.g. [NORTH] [1]/[SOUTH] [3]). A wrong-way multiplex may also carry a
route with a third direction (e.g. [NORTH] [1]/[SOUTH] [3]/[EAST] [2])
- there are many examples of this in the field in various places. A
four-direction multiplex is theoretically possible (some individual
routes can and do briefly run in or close to the opposite direction of
which they are signed, see Question 12.16.1 ) but none has been found
yet by m.t.r contributors.

RI-114 actually multiplexes with itself in Pawtucket (it is a
transition between two one-way couplets where one couplet has each
direction with the oncoming route to the left rather than to the
right, due to a circuitous path taken by the northbound routing). See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_Route_114#endnote_Pawtucket
.
Truck US-19 also does this while traversing a pair of I-279
interchanges in Pittsburgh. http://www.m-plex.com/roads/pamplex/mp_i279_us19_trkus19_us22_us30.ht...
US-250 may also do this at US-19 in Fairmont, WV.

3.9.1

Q: Which highway has the most multiplexed routes?

A: I-465 on the east side of Indianapolis, IN, between the US-36/SR-67
and US-40 exits, also carries US-31, US-36, US-40, US-52, US-421,
SR-37, and SR-67, for a total of 8 routes on one highway, though only
I-465 is posted along this stretch as all other routes following I-465
except I-74 have a sign reading &quot;FOR [route shield][direction]/FOLLOW
[I-465 shield]/to Exit [number]&quot; on the onramps where they enter I-465
(see http://illi-indi.com/showFull.php?id=1452Â§ ion=34652 ). The most
signposted routes is 7 in GA: US-1, US-23, US-301, SR-4, SR-15, SR-23,
and SR-121 just short of the FL line (
http://www.gribblenation.com/papics/outofstate/gatotempole-folkston.jpg
). This is possible because in GA every US highway is usually paired
with at least one signposted state route (see 7.6.4 ), so other
examples with this many or possibly even more may exist elsewhere in
the state.

For Interstates the most along any one roadway is

I-55/64/70 between St. Louis, MO, and East St. Louis, IL (FHWA implies
in its route log [see Section 6 intro] that I-44 ends at I-70, but
MoDOT states that it goes to the IL border, creating by that reckoning
I-44/55/64/70, though this may change with the construction of a new
Mississippi R. bridge further north [ http://www.newriverbridge.org/
]),

and I-39/90/94 in WI.

(In OH, I-77/80/90 and I-77/80N/90, portions of today's I-80/90 and
I-90, were briefly proposed when the easternmost portion of today's
I-94 was to be the northernmost portion of I-77, but these were never
signposted - see http://www.roadfan.com/5758int.html .)

For U.S. highways, it's a tie between many four-route multiplexes,
including that on the aforementioned I-465 segment. (US-61/63/64/70/79
used to run on I-55 between West Memphis, AR, and Memphis, TN,
possibly with US-63 ending at the AR/TN line, but US-63 was later
rerouted.) Sep 13, 2005

3.10 Ramp to Nowhere

Segments of highway or ramp that sit unused, often barricaded. They
may be part of a cancelled or a future highway project. Also called
Ghost Ramps. A special type is the Evel Knievel Ramp, which stops in
mid-air. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unused_highway Feb 8, 2007

3.11 Roadgeek

Usually used to mean an m.t.r regular who is not professionally
involved with roads. Also used to describe anyone who has a larger-
than-average interest in roads. Other similar terms used are
&quot;roadfan&quot;, &quot;highway enthusiast&quot;, &quot;viaphile&quot;, &quot;odologist&quot; (see
http://www.cbrd.co.uk/reference/dictionary/#o ), and the pun &quot;roads
scholar&quot;. See http://web.archive.org/web/20040414215828/http://www.ylekot.com/geek....
(no-longer-extant webpage at Archive.org)

http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~gtg377a/meetings.html . Mar 10, 2006

3.12 Super 2

A controlled-access freeway with two lanes and usually without a
center median. Super 4s are undivided 4-lane freeways. A Super 2
Expressway is a Super 2 with occasional at-grade intersections; some
states call these Super 2s.

3.13 Toll highway

A freeway that charges a toll. Some people on m.t.r do not use
&quot;freeway&quot; to describe a toll highway (see also 3.14). Various states
refer to these with various names. Lists of toll facilities are
available at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/tollpage.htm and
http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~mn2n/tollroads.html . In the 1800s
toll roads were known as Turnpikes (see http://eh.net/encyclopedia/?article=Klein.Majewski.Turnpikes
), a term which resurfaced in the middle of the 20th Century.
Interstates specifically may be tolled only if physical improvements
are made to them (in which case the toll is used to pay for the
improvements), there is reimbursement to the Federal Highway
Administration all federal money used in the building process of the
stretch in question, or there is an Act of Congress. See also
http://www.tollroadsnews.com/ . Mar 8, 2007

3.13.1 E-ZPass

This is one of many Electronic Toll Collection agencies in North
America. Go to http://www.e-zpass.info/ for a list and map of E-ZPass-
compatible highways, and http://www.e-zpassiag.com/ for a list of all
the ETC agencies worldwide as well as contact information. The term
&quot;open-road tolling&quot; is used to describe the condition using this
system in which motorists do not have to slow to below highway speed
to be detected. Apr 5, 2007

3.14

Q: What is the difference between an expressway and a freeway?
What is the difference between limited access and controlled access?

A: According to AASHTO, a freeway is a fully controlled access road,
one with no cross traffic. A freeway can be tolled; the &quot;free&quot; refers
to the fact that traffic can ideally flow freely. An expressway is a
divided highway with no private access BUT occasional traffic lights
are allowed; essentially it is a freeway with intersections, usually
with traffic signals, in place of interchanges. Major roads should get
interchanges where traffic necessitates them. Many states, including
California and Wisconsin, use this. This FAQ does too.
However, most east coast states plus others use expressway for the
&quot;official&quot; freeway, and freeway is simply an alternate term for the
same thing, or absent from the vocabulary altogether. Many of these
states use the &quot;official&quot; terms in legal matters but name them
differently. There are two cases of an &quot;official&quot; expressway being
named a freeway: the Rockaway Freeway in New York City and the State
Fair Freeway (K-96) between Wichita and Hutchinson, Kansas.
A special type of expressway is the &quot;Jersey Freeway&quot;, an unofficial
term used to describe an expressway with no median breaks. As the name
implies, these are common in NJ.
For a list of expressways in the US and Canada see http://www.expresswaysite.com/
.

&quot;Limited access&quot; usually refers to freeway grade in common usage;
according to AASHTO, however, only &quot;controlled access&quot; refers to
freeway grade, whereas &quot;limited access&quot; refers to expressway grade.
Some states including FL reverse AASHTO's definitions, and some states
such as VA use &quot;limited access&quot; to designate only frequency of access
and not specifically highway type.

3.14.1

Q: What is the difference between the terms &quot;highway&quot; and &quot;route&quot; when
referring to numbering systems?

A: It depends on the local region's tradition. OR actually uses both
terms in different contexts (see Question 7.6.4). The term &quot;the&quot;
preceding the route number (e.g. &quot;the 405&quot;) is only common in S. CA
( http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/browse_frm/thread/...
) and metro Buffalo within the US (it is common in other English-
speaking countries). Discussions on the topic:

3.15 Spur

A branch route whose number often contains the same number as the
primary route and ends at a specific point away from the mainline. Jan
28, 2002

3.16

Q: What is the difference between a traffic circle and a roundabout?

A: Very generally, roundabouts are small circular roadways built for
traffic flow improvement which are designed more meticulously than
traffic circles, which sometimes are just the roadway around an
obstruction rather than dedicated traffic control. For very detailed
information, see http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/00-0671.pdf , especially
Section 1.5 (this is part of http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/00068.htm ),
as well as http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part3/part3b2.htm#section3B24
. See also http://dmoz.org/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Interchanges/Roundabouts/
and http://www.aaroads.com/kick-off/highway.html#roundabout . (Note
that some newer traffic circles are not roundabouts, but small
&quot;traffic-calming&quot; devices - see http://dmoz.org/Science/Technology/Transportation/Traffic_Calming/
.)

Roundabouts are often used in Great Britain at interchanges, either as
a large roundabout ( http://www.cbrd.co.uk/reference/interchanges/roundabout.shtml
) or two smaller ones on each site of the motorway (
http://www.cbrd.co.uk/reference/interchanges/dumbbell.shtml ). The
latter is also gaining presence in the U.S., most notably along I-135
in KS, and on I-70 in Vail, CO. Other locations are listed at
http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/browse_frm/thread/...
(10/17/05).

The term &quot;rotary&quot;, found mostly in MA, may refer to either a traffic
circle or a roundabout.

The term &quot;roundabout&quot; originated in Great Britain, but is purported to
have been coined by an American working abroad there (
http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/85bb8a44f40b98e9
, message ID 1127264917.495082.158 ... @g49g2000cwa.googlegroups.com ).

3.16.1

Q: Where is the Magic Roundabout?

A: There are many. The most famous of these is located in Swindon in
southern England, and is a roundabout containing five mini-roundabouts
within it. The main roundabout carries two-way traffic. For more
information, see http://www.swindonweb.com/life/lifemagi0.htm and
http://www.digitalnorseman.com/musings/2002/rndabt.html . A
compilation of locations of these roundabouts is located at
http://www.pberry.plus.com/ukroads/magicroundabouts/ . Apr 8, 2003

3.17 Bump

This is a term used on m.t.r to describe two routes which resume each
other's routings at an intersection, only overlapping within the
intersection (ex.: a route which enters an intersection from the west
and leaves to the north, and another which enters the same
intersection from the south and leaves to the east). This term is also
applied to freeway interchanges, even if the routes in question
actually cross each other or have a short overlap within the
interchange (exs.: I-80/eastern I-76, I-80/I-74). &quot;Cannon&quot; has been
suggested as a British equivalent ( http://www.cbrd.co.uk/reference/
dictionary/#c ). Apr 23, 2005

3.18 Cutout

This refers to a route marker (see Question 10.1) which is cut in its
own shape, rather than cut as a square or rectangle with a black
background behind the marker shape. All route markers were originally
cutouts, and today most Interstate and some state route shields are
cutouts, as well as US shields in various places, predominantly CA
(see http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~jlin/signs/usa/#US ). Jul 19, 2005

3.19 Clinch

To travel a highway its entire length. This definition is tempered by
personal interpretations, such as travelling both directions,
traversing ramps, driving vs. riding, and completing in a single trip.

4 Government

Highways are covered in the respective Section 23s of both the U.S.
Code ( http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title23/title23.html ) and the
Code of Federal Regulations (U.S.) ( http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/cfrassemble.cgi?title=200523
). Mar 10, 2006

4.1

Q: What is FHWA?

A: The Federal Highway Administration ( http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ ) is an
agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation that administers
funding for American highways, including the National Highway System
(see Question 7.7 ). It also promotes safety on the highway system.
Links to online manuals and articles published by the FHWA (including
the MUTCD, see Section 10 ) are on http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/fhwaweb.htm
(see also Section 10). Note that the abbreviation for the agency is
not &quot;FHA&quot; (which is the Federal Housing Administration). Also note
that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is not
a part of FHWA (but is a part of the USDOT), nor are the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) (formerly but no longer
part of the DOT) or the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

Q: What is AASHTO?

A: The American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials ( http://www.transportation.org/ ) is a consortium of the 50
state DOTs and USDOT. Formerly known as AASHO. Documents with route
numbering decisions made by AASHTO since 1989 are located on the

4.3

Q: What are ISTEA, TEA-21, and SAFETEA-LU?

A: ISTEA, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, passed
in 1991, authorized federal funding for highway, transit and safety
programs. The funding expired in October 1997, so in March 1998, ISTEA
was given an extension. TEA-21, the Transportation Equity Act for the
21st Century ( http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/tea21/ ), which can be viewed
as a successor to ISTEA, authorizes a 33% increase in transportation
spending. They also include regulations which must be followed to
receive federal funding. The next successor, passed in 2005, is
SAFETEA-LU, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient
Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy For Users, known prior at
different times as SAFETEA or TEA-LU ( http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/
, http://www.house.gov/transportation/highway/tealu.html , or
http://www.house.gov/transportation/highway/increasehighwayfund.html

Q: What are the Appalachian Regional Corridors?

A: The Appalachian Regional Corridors are a system of proposed 4-lane
highways designed to stimulate economic development in the Applachian
Mountain Region. They each have letters. For more information see

6 The Interstate Highway System

The Interstate Highway System (or, more formally, the Dwight D.
Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways) is a
system of divided controlled access highways present in every state as
well as DC and PR. It has more than 45,000 miles to its credit. A
complete list is found at http://www.ihoz.com/interstates.html (1 and
2 digit) and http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/ (3 digit), as well as at
http://www.interstate-guide.com/ . Information on planned Interstates
and Interstate extensions can be found at http://www.aaroads.com/high-priority/
and http://www.interstate-guide.com/future.html . FHWA's overview of
the system is at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/interstate.html
, a route log is at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/ , and
an FAQ is at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/faq.htm . See Question
6.1 for Interstate history. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations lists
in Title 23, Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 470, the &quot;Guidance
Criteria for Evaluating Requests for Interstate System Designations
Under [Title] 23 [of the] U.S. [Code, now-repealed Section] 139 (a)
and (b)&quot; (for text, see the portion directly after Section 470.115 in
the respective file at http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_04/23cfr470_04.html
). AASHTO's Interstate policy is at http://www.trafficsign.us/inpolicy.html
. This policy states among other items that Interstates and U.S.
Highways with the same number should not exist in the same state,
likely the reason why there is no I-50 or I-60, although US-24 and
I-24 both exist in IL, and US-80 and I-80 briefly existed in CA until
the former was truncated outside the state (both instances presumedly
overlooked due to the distance between), and three proposed Interstate
extensions and one new Interstate are planned to exist in states with
the corresponding U.S. route (41 in WI, 49 in AR, 69 in TX, 74 in NC -
on current signage for the latter's pairing with US 74, &quot;FUTURE&quot;
replaces &quot;INTERSTATE&quot; on the I-74 shields - see elsewhere in Section 6
for more details on each of these).
Even though these routes are known as being federally-marked routes,
it is actually the states that maintain them in most cases, and other
non-federal-level agencies in the rest. The Interstates have received
federal funding of various percentages of the whole throughout the
history of the system, however (see http://www.cahighways.org/itypes.html
). Interstates are automatically included in the National Highway
System (see Question 7.7 ).
There are single-state Interstates (see Question 6.12) - the name
&quot;Interstate&quot; refers to the system as a whole and not to any individual
numbered route.
A ranking subject to interpretation of 2-digit Interstates by
importance is located at http://www.kurumi.com/roads/rank2di.html .

6.1.1

Q: How did the Interstate Highway System come to be?

A: In 1944, Congress authorized construction of an interstate
expressway system connecting major cities and industrial centers. No
money was involved in the bill. The project never took off until the
awarding of the first contract for I-70 in Missouri, in 1956. North
Dakota was the first state to complete its Interstates. More
information is available at http://www.tfhrc.gov/pubrds/summer96/p96su10.htm
and http://eisenhower.archives.gov/dl/InterstateHighways/InterstateHighwa...
. Jul 10, 2003

6.1.2

Q: What was the first stretch of Interstate to open?

A: The first stretch of Interstate opened under the 1944 Congress act
was I-70 in Kansas, which opened in 1957. More information is at
http://www.tfhrc.gov/pubrds/summer96/p96su18.htm 2000-08-17 15:29:33

6.1.3

Q: What were the original plans for Interstates?

A: The Interstate System's original plans are detailed in a
publication called General location of national system of interstate
highways, including all additional routes at urban areas designated in
September, 1955, commonly known as the &quot;Yellow Book&quot;. Go to
http://www.ajfroggie.com/roads/yellowbook/ or http://www.roadfan.com/intreg.html#yellowbk
for much more information including maps. See also http://www.roadfan.com/5758int.html
. Apr 5, 2007

6.2 Interstate Numbering

There's a very strict plan for numbering Interstate routes. The one
and two-digit routes are the mainlines, with the even numbered routes
going east-west, and the odd routes going north-south. The even
routes' numbers increase as you go north, with the odd Interstate
roads increasing to the east. The major routes end in 0 or 5. As for
three-digit interstates, those that both start and end at a 2-digit
route get an even first digit, while those not connected to the
Interstate system at their end or ends have an odd first digit.
Exceptions to this occur usually when a state has depleted its
respective choices for 3-digit Interstates. If a 3-digit Interstate
has another 3-digit Interstate branching from it (a &quot;grandchild&quot;),
then the numbering for the second-generation highway is the same as
for the first-generation one. In the field are I-105 CA, I-235 KS,
I-444 OK, I-370 MD, I-175/375 FL, I-278/478/678/878 NJ/NY, I-579 PA,
I-280/380/980 CA, I-190 MA, I-590/990 NY, I-495 NY, I-695 DC, and
I-795 MD (each intersects with another 3di with a common &quot;root&quot; but
not with its 2di parent). I-195 NJ also used to be one but it now
intersects I-95 directly. For more on numbering see the FHWA site at
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/interstate.html#Interstate_Numbe...
.

Documents with Interstate route numbering decisions made by AASHTO
since 1989 are located on the Special Committee on U.S. Route
Numbering page at http://cms.transportation.org/?siteid=68 . Dec 8,

6.2.1 Letter Suffixes

6.2.1.1

Q: What happened to letter extensions on Interstate highways?

A: AASHTO eliminated them in 1980 and told state DOTs to think of
other numbers. Two still remain on I-35. I-15E in California stayed
until 1983 (see 6.2.1.3). Jan 18, 2002

6.2.1.2

Q: Why does I-35 split in Dallas and Minneapolis?

A: As stated in the previous question, some Interstates once carried
letter suffixes. All but three were changed in 1980, and one of those
(I-15E in CA) was gone by 1983. The remaining two are the I-35 splits
in Dallas and Minneapolis, which remain because there was no consensus
on what the new numbers would be. The smaller cities, St. Paul and
Fort Worth, did not want their Interstate highways &quot;demoted&quot; to 3di's.
Jul 9, 2003

6.2.1.3

Q: What are/were all the suffixed interstates?

A:

Actually existed

I-5W (CA) -- I-505, I-80, I-580, I-205, CA-120 (see
http://www.cahighways.org/001-008.html#005 for details)

I-35W/I-35E still exists in TX and MN (see 6.2.1.2)
I-35W (KS) -- I-135
I-59B (AL) -- I-459 (Note: &quot;59B&quot; was chosen through a system of
placeholder numbers using &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, etc., as opposed to &quot;B&quot; meaning
&quot;bypass&quot;)
I-70N/I-70S (MD) -- I-70/I-270
I-70S (PA) -- I-70 between I-79 and I-76
I-75E (FL) -- I-75 between I-275 termini

I-80N (IA) -- I-680 east of I-29
I-80N (OH) -- I-80/90, I-90, I-490, I-480, and OH 14 between US 250
near Norwalk and I-76 near Ravenna
I-80S (CO/NE) -- western I-76
I-80S (OH/PA/NJ) at first used today's I-76 in OH and PA and I-276 in
PA; later it was rerouted on today's I-76 and I-676 through
Philadelphia and Camden rather than around; and later it was truncated
at today's I-376 when I-76 was created along today's I-376 and the PA
Turnpike
(See http://www.roadfan.com/ohiomaps.html , http://www.pahighways.com/interstates/pdi.html#I80S
, and http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/i76.htm for details on
the OH/PA/NJ I-80N/I-80 and I-80/I-80S)
I-81E (PA) -- I-380
I-180N (ID) -- I-184 in Boise; all other spurs of suffixed 2dis were
non-suffixed

Planned but never signed

The sources for these are the 1957 and 1958 maps on http://www.roadfan.com/5758int.html
-- see 6.1.3 for more details

I-5E (CA) -- I-5 between I-5W termini (see above)
I-80N (PA/NJ) -- I-78
I-80S (PA) -- I-76 east of Harrisburg
I-81S (PA) -- I-81E (see above)

I-94N (MI) -- I-196 (now I-96 west of Grand Rapids)
I-95E (RI/MA) -- I-195 (pre-Interstate plans called it US 6)

Sep 13, 2005

6.2.2

Q: Why the heck does I-99 have such a weird number?

A: This has been one of the most contentious questions or topics in
the newsgroup. Unlike other interstate highways, which have their
numbers assigned by AASHTO, I-99's number was assigned in a piece of
appropriations legislation sponsored by former Rep. Bud Shuster (R-
Pa.), through whose district the highway ran.

Many of the regulars on m.t.r take issue with this highway designation
because:

1) Its number was written into law, as described above;

2) Its number is out of place--a highway designated as I-99 should run
right along the Atlantic coast; and

3) From its length (under 70 miles), location (in an area where all
the available 2di designations are already being used), route
(basically, a spur from I-76 to the Altoona/State College area, at
least until it connects to I-80), and the fact that it doesn't come
close to any interstate other than I-76, an odd 3di designation (such
as I-576) would be more appropriate.

As a side note, for now I-99 also has the distinction of being the
only 2 digit interstate that does not have a direct interchange with
any other interstate.

Q: What is I-238?

A: Interstate 238 is a 2-mile freeway on the east side of San
Francisco Bay, California. It is not numbered according to the regular
Interstate numbering conventions; rather, it was an extension of CA
238. There is no I-38. More information is at http://www.gbcnet.com/roads/I-238/

6.2.4

Q: Why are there two Interstates 76, 84, 86 and 88?

A: All duplicates but 86 arose around the time when most letter
suffixes on Interstates were removed, though not all replaced a
suffixed Interstate designation. Eastern I-86 (see 6.3.6) was recently
added because there were no other choices that would fit. At one time,
an eastern I-86 existed from Hartford, CT to I-90 in MA; this is now
part of I-84 (see http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/i86.html ). There
were also two I-39s, but I-39 is now signed along I-90 between the two
sections (see http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-039.html ). There are
technically two I-74s, but these are planned to be connected, unlike
the other duplicates (see Question 6.3.4 ). I-90, interpreted by some
two be in two segments, is actually continuous (see Question 6.3.10 ).
At one time two I-77s and two I-82s were planned (see
http://www.roadfan.com/5758int.html ). Apr 5, 2007

6.2.5

Q: Which 3di spurs go both directions from a parent?

A: I-305 CA (hidden), I-516 GA, I-526 SC, I-540 AR (small overlap with
I-40), I-170 MO (crosses I-70, ends at I-270), I-580 CA (small overlap
with I-80), I-185 SC (crosses I-85, ends at I-385), I-385 SC, I-390 NY
(crosses I-90, ends at I-490), I-394 MN (crosses I-94, ends at I-494),
I-595 FL; future: I-710 CA, I-355 IL, I-195 NJ; former: I-181 TN (part
south of I-81 was replaced by I-26 first, then north was later) Sep

6.3 Oddities

6.3.1

Q: What happens to I-95 in NJ?

A: The short explaination is the &quot;NIMBY factor&quot;. Residents of the
Princeton and New Brunswick, NJ, areas managed to kill a section of
I-95 through their towns in the early 1980s; the NJ Turnpike also
opposed it as it would provide an alternate to the toll road. There
has been a gap ever since. On the NJ Turnpike, the I-95 signs
disappear. There is a plan to build an interchange connecting the
existing I-95 with the PA Turnpike northeast of Philadelphia, where
they currently cross but do not have an interchange. The new routing
would follow the PA Turnpike connector from the NJ Turnpike across the
Delaware River to the new interchange, where it would resume its old
route. This interchange should be complete around 2008. More
information is available at http://www.njfreeways.com/Interstate_95_Gap.html
, http://www.nycroads.com/roads/I-95_NJ/ , and http://www.paturnpike.com/i95/
. This will complete the gap between New York City and Philadelphia,
but will not provide easy access to I-287 from Philadelphia for
bypassing New York City as original I-95 would have.
Some propose rerouting I-95 on the NJ Turnpike all the way to the
Delaware Memorial Bridge and I-295; this is how most through traffic
goes anyway. Many people have a problem with this because it would
bypass Philadelphia. Sep 30, 2004

6.3.1.1

Q: Are I-95's exit numbers between I-80 and NY an extension of I-80's?

A: No. Those numbers are based on the original mileage of I-95 in NJ
including the unbuilt portion mentioned above in 6.3.1 (see the
relevant section of http://www.nycroads.com/roads/I-95_NJ/ ). Sep 30,
2004

6.3.2

Q: Why do some Interstates, such as I-180 in WY, have traffic lights
or at-grade intersections?

A: Usually Interstates are not allowed to have any cross traffic. In
fact at-grade intersections have kept the new I-86 in New York from
extending further east. But in these cases, AASHTO granted variances
because there was no other reasonable way to build them.
Wyoming I-180 is the only Interstate with no freeway portions. There
are three stoplights. Why was it commissioned in the first place? The
state of Wyoming wanted an Interstate serving downtown Cheyenne. It
was to be freeway, but that idea was rejected. More information is at
http://www.rockymountainroads.com/wyoming/i-180.html
I-676 in Philadelphia, PA has some traffic lights between the Vine St
Expressway and the Ben Franklin Bridge. Construction of a freeway
connection would impact several historic landmarks. There is some
doubt among roadgeeks as to whether I-676 actually goes this way; the
official PennDOT maps label the freeway connection to I-95 as 0676 and
put US 30 on the Ben Franklin Bridge. There is an I-676 shield on the
county map, but shields reflect actual signage, not internal
designations (as the 0676 does). NJDOT however takes I-676 over the
bridge officially and in signage. (See http://www.pahighways.com/interstates/I676.html )
I-78 in Jersey City, NJ runs along a one-way pair of surface streets
between the end of the Turnpike Extension and the Holland Tunnel. I-78
ends just across the border in Manhattan, New York City, so it could
be truncated, but hasn't been. NJ 139 also runs along those streets,
as if NJDOT were prepared for truncation. FHWA, NJDOT, and NYSDOT all
officially refer to these last few miles as I-78. (See also 12.2 )
Rehabilitation on an adjacent section of NJ-139 started in 2005
( http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/commuter/roads/jcviaducts/ ),
but this does not affect the at grade section of I-78 (which also
carries anotehr section of NJ-139).
I-70 in Breezewood, PA is the most famous of these. It runs along a
short section of US 30 lined with businesses between the north-south
free portion of I-70 and the Turnpike connection. It would be fairly
easy to construct direct ramps, but the businesses have been
successful in blocking them. Some think the influential congressman
Bud Shuster has helped block the ramps. (See 3.1 above)
I-585 in Spartanburg, SC is signed NB before the freeway starts, past
several traffic lights. It is unknown why; the road was and is also
US-176. (See 6.3.9)
I-690 at the NY State Fairgrounds in Syracuse has a pedestrian
crossing that only functions during the NY State Fair. Because this is
only in operation for a small period of time, it is not worth it to
build an overpass.
I-8, I-10 and I-17 in AZ, I-40 in NC, I-10 and I-40 in W. TX, and I-40
in NM have some at-grade intersections for forest, farm, and ranch
access (see http://www.arizonaroads.com/wrong/ ). Most of these
highways were built directly over a pre-existing rural two-lane road,
so this is the only access for many of these properties. Interchanges
would not be worth the expense due to the extremely low traffic which
these intersecting roads carry (some in fact are private).
AK Interstates have signals, but that is because those Interstate
designations are &quot;hidden&quot; along state highways which are usually
surface roads with at-grade intersections (see Question 6.3.8 ).

Several other interstates end at traffic lights, but this is perfectly
OK as long as this is not a 3di's only connection to its parent or an
even 3di's only connection to another interstate at one end.
One example of this that is often brought up is I-587 is Kingston, NY;
this connects to the I-87 ramp via a traffic circle. However, a
traffic circle is somewhat up to standards; there is no cross traffic.
In fact there is a case of a 3DI not meeting its parent; the
abovementioned I-585 in Spartanburg, SC ends at Business Loop I-85,
which is the old I-85 (and is a freeway, but not up to full interstate
standards). It continues to I-85 (bypass) as 4 lane US 176, which is
due for upgrades soon. (See 6.3.9)
I-65 in NW IN formerly had a traffic light installed in 1980 at the IN
Toll Road (I-90) connection at the north end (41.592,-87.3) ; this was
considered by INDOT to be mainline I-65 (
http://www.in.gov/dot/div/technology/interchanges/I65/is262.pdf - note
that this diagram shows the rail crossing just north of the signalized
intersection as active; it actually was abandoned by the time I-65 was
extended northward to US-12/20) but was not really the same case of a
traffic light on an Interstate as other examples because the section
north of this signal functioned more like a ramp pair, and was
probably considered one by AASHTO. This has been replaced by
conventional grade-separated freeway ramps.
I-291 in Springfield, MA, has an access point at I-90/MA Turnpike
similar to the former I-65/I-90 junction cited above, albeit with a
more simple design (42.16,-72.54).

Several tunnels on the system have signals at their portals, either to
stop unwanted vehicles from entering (too tall, too heavy, too wide,
hazardous material carrier) or for traffic capacity control.

Question 6.3.7 deals with drawbridges on Interstates, which have
traffic lights but no cross traffic.

Railroad crossings:
The Interstate highway specifications do not permit railroad grade
crossings. A few did exist before, but all have either been grade
separated or had the tracks removed. However, a number of crossings do
still exist on some non-Interstate highways with controlled access. In
many of these cases, the crossing is classified as &quot;Exempt&quot; by the
particular state, meaning that vehicles normally required to stop at
railroad crossings, such as vehicles carrying hazardous material and
school buses, can continue through without stopping. Instead, all
trains are required to send a flagman to clear the highway traffic
before it may proceed. These crossings are rarely busy railroad
mainlines, as they tend to be lightly-used or even disused industrial
spurs. Exempt crossings are noted with a tab on the advance RxR
warning sign post and/or on the crossbuck post itself (see
http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part8/part8b.htm#section8B05 ).

Former crossings on Interstates:
I-65 north end in IN (see above). Abandoned, then interchange
reconstructed.
I-87 Adirondack Northway, NY, near the Mohawk River. This line was
apparently already up for abandonment with the now-defunct Interstate
Commerce Commission when the Interstate was being built, so it did not
pay to build an overpass that would be useless in a few years.
I-94 near Ypsilanti, MI. Now abandoned. This same line used to cross
US 23 at-grade as well.
I-94 near Albion, MI. Now abandoned.
I-395 in N. VA (Shirley Highway) near Glebe Rd. Crossing dismantled
when the Washington &amp; Old Dominion RR folded. Note that this was while
it had its pre-Interstate designation (VA 350).

Existing crossings on non-Interstate controlled-access highways [* -
Exempt]: US-1, Edison, NJ (Jersey Freeway - see 3.14); US-4 near
Rutland, VT; US-12/14/18/151, Madison, WI; US-30/250, Wooster, OH*;
US-46, Totowa, NJ; US-60, Springfield, MO*; US-63, Columbia, MO;
US-151, Beaver Dam, WI; US-151, Waupun, WI; US-301, Rocky Mount, NC;
US-322 between Harrisburg and Hershey, PA*; NY-49 near Rome*; OH-7,
north of Martins Ferry; OR-22, east of Salem; Atlantic City-Brigantine
Connector, NJ*

Other former grade crossings on major divided highways: US-1, Danvers,
MA; US-3, Billerica, MA; US-4, Portsmouth, NH; US-6, Denver, CO;
US-12/14/18/151, Madison, WI (2 others in addition to the current
one); US-23 south of Dundee, MI (and others); US-64, Tulsa, OK (2);
US-131, Kalamazoo, MI; MA-2, Concord; NY-17 (Quickway)/future I-86
near Middletown, NY

Note: The above question refers to Interstate intersections with roads
which carry general traffic and not roadways such as maintenance roads
(intersections between these and freeways are common throughout the
U.S.). Mar 11, 2006

6.3.3

Q: Where was the Embarcadero Freeway and why was it torn down?

A: The Embarcadero Freeway, I-480, would have connected the Bay Bridge
to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, carrying mostly local
traffic. The first section north from I-80 was built. Most San
Francisco residents hated it because it blocked the view of the
waterfront from the other side. After a 1989 earthquake almost made it
collapse, it was permanently closed and torn down. The same thing
happened to the northern half and most of the upper deck of the
Central Skyway (US 101). Across the Bay in Oakland, part of the
Cypress Freeway (I-880) actually collapsed, killing some motorists.
This double decker freeway was torn down and rebuilt on a new
alignment; the old alignment is now a wide boulevard with a park in
the middle.

6.3.4

Q: Why are these I-73 and I-74 signs popping up in North Carolina?

A: Interstate 73 and the 74 extension are specified in the ISTEA
legislation. I-73 will go from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to Myrtle
Beach, South Carolina, while the 74 extension will head east from its
present Cincinnati, Ohio terminus to Portsmouth, Ohio and be mostly
multiplexed with 73 south of there. A North Carolina portion south of
Greensboro was already freeway, so they installed signs there. Some
states are reluctant to build the new highway, specifically Ohio. More

2000-08-11 19:10:26

6.3.5

Q: Why are there freeway loops in Phoenix?

A: The loop freeways are not Interstates because they are funded by a
1/2 cent sales tax paid by county residents, not by Federal money. If
these freeways had waited for inclusion in the Interstate system, they
may have been delayed for years, or never been built at all. More
information is at http://www.arizonaroads.com/urban/ . Jan 15, 2002

6.3.6 What is the new I-86?

The eastern I-86, the newest 2di, runs from just outside Erie, PA, to
East Corning, NY, along state route 17, the Southern Tier Expressway.
The move was designed to spurt economic development in the Elmira and
Binghamton areas. This part was designated in late 1999; it is planned
to extend east to I-87 at Harriman once the at-grade intersections are
eliminated. More information is at http://www.aaroads.com/high-priority/corr36.html

6.3.6.1

Q: Does it really dip into Pennsylvania?

A: Yes, it does. Exit 60 (US 220) is entirely in Pennsylvania, and the
dip is complete with &quot;STATE BORDER&quot; signs. However, New York maintains
it. Maps: 42,-76.54 ; http://www.empirestateroads.com/maps/waverly.jpg

6.3.8

Q: Why are there Interstate highways in Hawaii? Are there plans for
Interstates in Alaska or Puerto Rico? Are there any freeways in Alaska
or Puerto Rico?

A: The Hxx Interstates were approved by AASHTO when Hawaii became a
state in 1959 to allow Hawaii to have Interstates (see
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/hawaii.htm and
http://www.hawaiihighways.com/FAQs-page4.htm#why-Interstates ). Even
though Alaska and Hawaii do not connect directly to other states,
their highways fall into the same system as those in the other 48
states, so while &quot;Interstate&quot; can't be literal, the name is there for
consistency. Alaska and Puerto Rico officially have Axx and PRxx
routes, respectively, but these are unsigned and, in Alaska's case at
least, generally not up to Interstate standards. In 1959, when Alaska
became a state, they asked for funding for fully standard Interstates
on the current corridors plus others, including one to Nome. This was
rejected. In 1981, FHWA added current routes A1-A4 to the Interstate
system as 2 lane rural arterials. The only Alaska Interstate routes
that have been upgraded to freeway are AK 1 (A1) east of downtown
Anchorage to just short of the AK 3 (Interstate A4) junction in
Palmer, and a few miles of AK 1 (Interstate A3) south of downtown
Anchorage. Puerto Rico has many rural and urban freeways (autopistas);
most of the rural freeways are tolled. The AK/HI/PR Interstates do not
have an &quot;I-&quot; preceding them in their abbreviations.
Here is a list of the Ax routes:

A1 follows AK 2 from the Canadian border to Tok Junction and then AK 1
to Anchorage.
A2 follows AK 2 from Tok Junction (AK 1) to Fairbanks.
A3 follows AK 1 from Anchorage to Soldotna.
A4 follows AK 3 from Palmer (AK 1) to Fairbanks.

Q: What's up with I-585 in Spartanburg, SC?

A: When the I-85 bypass around Spartanburg was built, old I-85 became
BUSINESS I-85. I-585 originally ended at I-85 like it should, but
since new I-85 was built it has not touched I-85, although that is
being addressed as that section is being converted to freeway.
Another oddity on I-585 is the fact that it is signed NB for several
blocks before Interstate-grade begins, in downtown Spartanburg.
In other words, I-585 doesn't extend far enough to I-85 (yet) and
extends too far on the other end. See http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/i585.html
and http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-585_sc.html . Dec 15, 2005

6.3.10

Q: Why is the Chicago Skyway no longer I-90?

A: Actually, according to FHWA, it still is. In late 1999, Chicago
added a TO banner to all the I-90 reassurance markers on the city-
maintained Skyway ( http://www.chicagoskyway.org/ ). Apparently the
city was looking at old records and realized it was never technically
approved as an interstate (see http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/2044938ffca6c8b4
, message ID n9jig-2008991217310 ... @chi-pm4-1a-40.theramp.net ).
However, in 2005, FHWA rebutted by saying that I-90 is and always has
been on the Skyway, at least since the I-90 and I-94 designations have
been as they have since 1964 (see http://www.tollroadsnews.com/cgi-bin/a.cgi/XeXDlOhBEdmcEIJ61nsxIA
, 6/28/05).
Another strange fact about the Skyway is that it was built as a 10
mile toll bridge. Illinois law at the time prohibited non-bridge toll
roads, so Chicago had to get it approved as a toll bridge over the
Calumet River.
In early March 2004 a plan to privatize the Skyway was proposed; this
plan was put into action in mid-October 2004. (&quot;For Sale: Chicago
Skyway&quot;, Chicago Sun-Times, March 2, 2004; &quot;Overseas investors to
lease Skyway from city&quot;, Chicago Tribune, October 15, 2004)
The Skyway has a McDonald's restaurant in the median by the toll plaza
( http://www.tollroadforsale.com/images/slide13.html ,

Q: Why does I-180 in IL exist?

A: I-180 serves the town of Hennepin, population 707 (2000 census). It
was built to serve LTV steel, a major defense contractor. In the
future it may be extended south to Peoria, signed either as I-180 or
IL-29 ( http://www.dot.il.gov/il29/default.aspx ), but it currently
has almost no traffic. See http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/i180.html#180il

. Mar 11, 2006

6.3.12

Q: What happened to I-265 in Nashville?

A: In late 2000, I-65 was rerouted along the former I-265, which
existed between I-24 and I-40 northwest of downtown, to relieve
traffic on the former I-40/65 multiplex (now I-40 between I-65 and
I-24). See http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/ix65.html#265tn and
http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-265_tn.html . May 28, 2003

6.3.13

Q: Are Kentucky's parkways built to Interstate standards?

A: No, according to Carl Dixon, Branch Manager, Division of Planning,
Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Each of Kentucky's parkways would
require work to reach the standards defined for Interstates. Work that
would be required depends on the parkway; however, the work would
&quot;include more lanes (e.g., the Daniel Boone Parkway), wider median
widths, wider shoulders, reduced grades, smoother curves, improved
interchanges, and possibly several other design details&quot;. The
Parkways, however, do allow trucks. The &quot;Parkway&quot; designation stems
from the fact that that's what Kentucky called its toll highways (not
all of these are tolled anymore). I-66 is planned to run along the
Cumberland Parkway and possibly the Boone, Natcher, and Western
Kentucky Parkways, and I-69 is planned to run along the Purchase
Parkway and possibly the Pennyrile and Western Kentucky Parkways (see
http://www.kentuckyroads.com/i-66/ and http://www.kentuckyroads.com/i-69/
). Jan 28, 2002

6.3.14

Q: Why do I-17's exit numbers start so high?

A: Until the mid-1980s Arizona used a special system for its mileage
-- any route which did not enter Arizona from another state used the
mileage of the route where its southern or western end was for its
point of origin rather than zero (e.g.: If Route 2's southern end was
at Route 1 and Route 1's mileage at the Route 1/Route 2 intersection
is Mile 57, then Route 2's lowest-numbered milemarker would be Mile
57). I-17 is a special case: Its exit numbers are actually those of
the former longer routing of AZ 69, which branched from US 89 at Mile
201, since I-17 and AZ 69 were paired early on. AZ 69 has been
truncated since I-17's exits were numbered (see http://www.arizonaroads.com/arizona/az69.htm
). I-17's exit numbers are not related to those of I-19 (see 10.3).

Q: What's with the I-465 spur northwest of Indianapolis? What is it
designated?

A: I-865, the east-west I-465 spur which connects I-65 to I-465
northwest of Indianapolis, exists partly because the I-65/I-465
interchange farther south lacks ramps between the north and northwest
(it also has no ramps between the south and southeast). It was
formerly signed as I-465 East eastbound and I-65 North westbound (the
I-65/I-865 interchange also lacks connections, between the southeast
and east) and was simply considered another part of I-465. It was
renumbered to I-865 in April 2002 and signage was changed beginning in
May 2002. Why it is now called I-865 is thoroughly explained in an
Indiana DOT press release (see http://www.in.gov/serv/presscal?PF=dot&amp;Clist;=6&amp;Elist;=52862
, 4/24/02). The spur also carries US 52, which, while not signposted
along most of I-465 (see 3.9.1), is in fact signed along the length of
the spur. The milemarkers on this spur used to start at 900 before it
was renumbered. See also http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/ix65.html#465in

Q: Has there been a proposal to extend eastern I-76 eastward?

A: Not officially. Many laypeople have proposed this extension, which
entails the freeway portion of NJ 42 plus most or all of the Atlantic
City Expressway, but this has not been considered officially due to a
combination of sub-Interstate features, potential confusion, and
disinterest (see http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/browse_frm/thread/...
). Oct 16, 2003

Q: What's with I-22?

A: I-22 has been signed into law as a designation running along
Appalachian Regional Corridor X (US-78) in TN, MS, and AL (see
Question 4.4 ). See http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-022.html and

Q: What's with I-41?

A: I-41 is designated along US-41 in TEA-LU (see Question 4.3 ). The

the same highway) has not yet been addressed (see the Section 6 intro
for why this would be noteworthy). For more information see

Q: What's with the proposed Interstates in the southern US?

A: There are two Interstates being considered in the Southeast, I-3
and I-14. These would be named after the 3rd Infantry Division of Fort
Stewart in GA and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
respectively. For routing information and the history of the
proposals, see http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-003.html and
http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-014.html .
