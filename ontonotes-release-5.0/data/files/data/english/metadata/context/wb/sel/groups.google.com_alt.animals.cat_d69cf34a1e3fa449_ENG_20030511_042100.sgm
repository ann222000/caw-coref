I've posted here a while back asking for help, and got a few good responses,
but my troubles with Pip continue.
Here is a description:

Pip is 11 months old, was the runt of the litter and lives with Alex (my 4
year old cat)

- He has some overgrooming problems, so thinking it was litter
allergies, I changed to natural recycled paper pellets
- He then started peeing next to the box
- Then he peed in my box of recycled newspapers in the living
room (I moved the papers away)
- He continues to use that corner
- Peed on my jacket on the floor once
- Found a wet towel in the bathroom this morning that he used
- Today I just caught him doing it on the carpet in the living
room again (other side of the room from his other accidents)

What I've done:
- Took him to the vet for a urinary check - no infection, but
moderate amount of crystals in the urine.
Vet said to give him more wet food to help that. (I've
mostly been giving them dry 95% of the time - so now they are getting
plenty of both)
- Tried cat repellent spray in the corner
- Put a floor mat over there with plastic underneath to keep the
leak-through off the carpet
- Soaked the area with Nature's Miracle (I have the corner of
the carpet pulled up right now to dry - he did it on the floor mat
underneath tonight)
(Yes, it was soaked with Nature's Miracle also, and
just drying)
- Tried club soda
- 409 carpet cleaning foam
- Sprayed air freshener there
- Baking soda
- Pet oder baking soda
- More Nature's Miracle
- Put a small table there to try to block it
- I talked to the people at the cat shelter where I got him.

I'm sure he has probably used other places on the carpet around the house
that I just haven't found yet.

Some other issues:
- He has had a skin problem where he has been overgrooming down
to the skin so it is all bald and bloody in spots.
- Vet thought it was food alergy, so I tried special food that
he hated to eat
- The people at the pet shelter said it was most likely anxiety
from Alex hissing at him all the time, so they gave me some kind of
anti-depressant pills for him.
- The pills have been helping a bit and his skin is a lot
better, but the peeing continues.

He poops in the litterbox just fine, but he prefers to use the carpet all
the time for urinating.

I can't take much more of this, and really want to find an answer. NOTHING
is working, and soon my house will smell like a cat toilet unless I figure
something out. I just don't know what else to try. I sometimes think I
should give him up, but that would be so hard on him since he is very
attached to me. I had to hand feed him when he was 5 weeks old since he was
a tiny runt of the litter. As far as I can tell from other people visiting,
I'm the only person in the world that the little guy really trusts.

Here is a photo of the little guy so you can see what I'm dealing with:

Any other advice would be greatly appreciated!

Tom:
I would try another litter box. What I mean is get 2, one for number one
and the other for number 2. Put one where he pees the most. When he starts to
pee elsewhere pick him up and put him in the litter box. If he is as smart as he
looks he will get the hint. Once he starts going there start to gradually move
the litterbox to where you want it permanently.
Is there any way that you can separate the two for a while? If not I
have seen and read about people who use a product called Feelaway(sp) they use a
diffuser it sprays a calming mist that calms the cats down. This might help on
both matters. It might calm Alex down so hat he won't hiss at Pip all the
time.Pip might just not get the pee scared out of him by Alex.
Just my advice for what it is worth.

Tom:
I hope you do find a solution to the problem. I'm probably sure that you
have already talked to your vet about Pip. I wish I had an answer for you.

Just another free advice tip.

Why not try and keep Pip in the bathroom longer. I don't mean just shut
him up in there, just keep him in there longer and play with him there away from
Alex.
Maybe Alex will get curious about what's going on and want to get in the fun an
realize that Pip isn't so bad after all and cut down on the aggressive behavior.
This would relieve the tension on both cats.
I really do wish you, Pip, and Alex can work this out soon.

I talked to the cat expert at the cat shelter again today. She told me that
I should try Dr. Elsey's Cat Attract litter. I guess that is supposed to
smell nice to cats so they use it.
I have kept Pip in the bathroom lately, he screams for a while then just
goes to sleep.

Good suggestion. I've used Cat Attract before and had good results with it.
It is a bit on the pricey side though. What I have done to get more use out
of a bag is, spread a few inches of their usual litter on the bottom topped
with about an inch of cat attract. Be sure to keep the boxes immaculate.
Some cats are very particular about the cleanliness of their box.

You might also want to try using a black light on the places where Pip has
urinated. Cat urine glows under black light. Maybe you missed a spot, or
two, while cleaning and he is still picking up the scent.

Best of luck........

Good idea. I've also heard that Citrus will keep them away. Smells kind of
nice to humans too.

So far so good with the cat attract over the last 24 hours. Hopefully this
works!

Tom,

I recently found a new product on the internet, sold by many vet med and pet
stores. The product is called &quot;FELIWAY&quot;. After years of trying to stop
several of the male cats we've had from &quot;spraying&quot; -- a behavior where the
cat marks his territory by spraying a shot of urine, usually about 8''
horizontally on a wall. a mirror, a corner, whatever, this Feliway which I
bought on the web actually stopped all so called &quot;marking&quot; in one month or
spraying it each day for that month! It has feline pheremones which the cat
recognizes as positive friendly odors. The cats seem to be calmed and
relaxed, and I have had no more outside the catbox problems. Use a search
engine and lookup the word. &quot;Feliway&quot; or &quot;cat behavior modicfication&quot;.
Good Luck
K

&gt; I've posted here a while back asking for help, and got a few good
responses,
&gt; but my troubles with Pip continue.
&gt; Here is a description:

&gt; Pip is 11 months old, was the runt of the litter and lives with Alex (my 4
&gt; year old cat)

&gt; - He has some overgrooming problems, so thinking it was litter
&gt; allergies, I changed to natural recycled paper pellets
&gt; - He then started peeing next to the box
&gt; - Then he peed in my box of recycled newspapers in the living
&gt; room (I moved the papers away)
&gt; - He continues to use that corner
&gt; - Peed on my jacket on the floor once
&gt; - Found a wet towel in the bathroom this morning that he used
&gt; - Today I just caught him doing it on the carpet in the living
&gt; room again (other side of the room from his other accidents)

&gt; What I've done:
&gt; - Took him to the vet for a urinary check - no infection, but
&gt; moderate amount of crystals in the urine.
&gt; Vet said to give him more wet food to help that. (I've
&gt; mostly been giving them dry 95% of the time - so now they are getting
&gt; plenty of both)
&gt; - Tried cat repellent spray in the corner
&gt; - Put a floor mat over there with plastic underneath to keep
the
&gt; leak-through off the carpet
&gt; - Soaked the area with Nature's Miracle (I have the corner of
&gt; the carpet pulled up right now to dry - he did it on the floor mat
&gt; underneath tonight)
&gt; (Yes, it was soaked with Nature's Miracle also, and
&gt; just drying)
&gt; - Tried club soda
&gt; - 409 carpet cleaning foam
&gt; - Sprayed air freshener there
&gt; - Baking soda
&gt; - Pet oder baking soda
&gt; - More Nature's Miracle
&gt; - Put a small table there to try to block it
&gt; - I talked to the people at the cat shelter where I got him.

&gt; I'm sure he has probably used other places on the carpet around the house
&gt; that I just haven't found yet.

&gt; Some other issues:
&gt; - He has had a skin problem where he has been overgrooming
down
&gt; to the skin so it is all bald and bloody in spots.
&gt; - Vet thought it was food alergy, so I tried special food
that
&gt; he hated to eat
&gt; - The people at the pet shelter said it was most likely
anxiety
&gt; from Alex hissing at him all the time, so they gave me some kind of
&gt; anti-depressant pills for him.
&gt; - The pills have been helping a bit and his skin is a lot
&gt; better, but the peeing continues.

&gt; He poops in the litterbox just fine, but he prefers to use the carpet all
&gt; the time for urinating.

&gt; I can't take much more of this, and really want to find an answer.
NOTHING
&gt; is working, and soon my house will smell like a cat toilet unless I figure
&gt; something out. I just don't know what else to try. I sometimes think I
&gt; should give him up, but that would be so hard on him since he is very
&gt; attached to me. I had to hand feed him when he was 5 weeks old since he
was
&gt; a tiny runt of the litter. As far as I can tell from other people
visiting,
&gt; I'm the only person in the world that the little guy really trusts.

&gt; Here is a photo of the little guy so you can see what I'm dealing with:

&gt; Tom,

&gt; I recently found a new product on the internet, sold by many vet med and pet
&gt; stores. The product is called &quot;FELIWAY&quot;. After years of trying to stop
&gt; several of the male cats we've had from &quot;spraying&quot; -- a behavior where the
&gt; cat marks his territory by spraying a shot of urine, usually about 8''
&gt; horizontally on a wall. a mirror, a corner, whatever, this Feliway which I
&gt; bought on the web actually stopped all so called &quot;marking&quot; in one month or
&gt; spraying it each day for that month! It has feline pheremones which the cat
&gt; recognizes as positive friendly odors. The cats seem to be calmed and
&gt; relaxed, and I have had no more outside the catbox problems. Use a search
&gt; engine and lookup the word. &quot;Feliway&quot; or &quot;cat behavior modicfication&quot;.
&gt; Good Luck
&gt; K

"/> I've tried all the commercial cat repellents myself -- we have a
similar problem, only with us, it's a leather sofa all three cats seem
to pee on with wild abandon -- and abandon is what we've done to the
sofa, more or less. We found loading the area with booby-trapped
balloons (balloons with open safety pins taped on, so any jiggling
would cause an explosion) helped, but only while the balloons were in
place. It was suggested to me that I use a scat-mat, an electrified
mat that delivers a shock when the animal steps on it, but since
no-one could tell me what would happen if the animal peed on it, I was
reluctant to try it. Then someone suggested a pad such as is used for
children who have bedwetting problems: when anything wet touches the
pad, it buzzes to wake the sleeper. If we were keeping the sofa, I'd
try that.

In the meantime, I've just happened upon the PERFECT carpet cleaner.
Our carpet under the leather sofa was just about a write-off, and we
tried every commercial product on the market, with no success. We had
it steam-cleaned, but that was a temporary solution. A co-worker
suggested Oxy-clean, which seemed to help a little. Then we thought,
since we had very little to lose, that we'd try hydrogen peroxide --
and it works! I've been using the straight 3 percent solution, right
from the bottle, and it eliminates the stain AND the odor.
Fortunately, our carpet is off-white, so the bleaching effect of the
peroxide is not a problem -- I expect if you had a coloured carpet,
this wouldn't be a workable answer.

Very best of luck -- this is an awful problem, as I can attest. And
kudos to you for being so patient with your kitty.

I provide Biffy, the World's Rottenest Cat (and world class sprayer) with
home, food and veterinary care, so perhaps I can offer some assistance.
Biffy is a very serious problem sprayer who loaned his body to science(at my
insistance ) to clinically test several pharmeceutical remedies. [n.b.,
Clinically, spraying is vertical marks. The horizontal marks Pip's leaving
aren't spraying.] Biffy's behaviour is being managed by a combination of
medication and behavioural modification. As part of this process, I've also
become a de facto expert on removing, as well as preventing spray marks.
BTW, much of this advice is from the University of California School of
Veterinary Medicine, which is where much of Biffy's clinical work was done.

Cleanup Protocol
1. Take a few paper towels, blot up the stain. Add the odor neutralizer.
Wait ten minutes. Blot again. Repeat if necessary.
2. Use the odor neutralizer anywhere thats porous or semi porous (sofa,
rug) Find an odor neutralizer that works, and stick to it! The University
of California (where Biffy participated in clinical trials) recommends Mr.
Max's Anti Icky Poo. I do to, but with reservations--the perfume in it (and
all odor neutralizers have some sort of perfume) triggers my asthma.
3. For hard surfaces (tile floors) use an NONSCENTED soap and water
solution or an oxygen bleach and water solution. Rinse well and blot.
Cleaning is really important. Once you start removing the scents, Pip will
be less inclined to use inappropriate spots.
BTW--finding cat spray marks is easier with an ultraviolet light. You can
buyUV bulbs for $2-3, but fluorescent UV works better. You can get a small
battery powered UV flashlight for about $12.

Cat Pan Protocol
1. Add another cat pan. UC recommends 1 pan per cat, plus one extra. (for
two cats, three pans). It doesn't have to be very big--I found sterllite
dishpans are just the right size &amp; only cost a buck or two.
2. Scoop solids out of the pans daily.
3. Change litter &amp; scrub pan weekly (again, use oxygen bleach or unscented
soap)
Again, much of this is scent related--I was amazed, when I started using
unscented soaps to eliminate cat scents, how my cats became less
territorial. And BTW, you may want to start reducing the number of
conflicting scents you use, or limiting them to a few key scents. I
switched to unscented hair conditioner, laundry soap, dish soap and
deodorant. However my bath soap, shampoo and cologne that have the same
fragrance--so everything I use is clearly marked as MINE.

Cat Protocol
1. Feed them out of separate bowls, and perhaps in separate rooms. Two
water bowls too!
2. Provide each of them with separate quality time every day--even 10
minutes makes a difference.
3. Behavioural modification. Reward Pip for using the cat pan. Praise
him, pat him, give him a cookie. Ignore his transgressions-- (this is, I
know, and almost superhuman feat, but try) Just quietly clean up and IGNORE
him (no words, no eye contact, nothing. Then leave the area)
4. Try clicker training or some form of operant conditioning. Training a
cat to do tricks provides her/him with a behaviour that is assured of a
reward--positive attention, which is often what the cat is looking for. The
training part was the hardest part for me to believe, but it did work.
Biffy used to tear things apart, spray on whatever I'd just been working on,
beat on his brother or break into a cabinet when he wanted attention. I
started to clicker train him. When he learned that he'd get rewarded for
jumping into a box, he started to jump into the box whenever he decided he
needed attention, and I learned that when Biffy jumps in the box, it's time
to give him a few moments of pats and praise. There's a book--Clicker
Training for Cats by Karen Pryor (she also has a web site)--and a few
clicker training yahoo groups you may want to look at.

Medical Intervention:
1. Try feliway. It didn't work on Biffy, but I know of other cats it works
wonders for.
2. If Feliway doesn't work, pills might. A few medications are being tried
on cats (Biffy included) that seem to work wonders. Prozac and Clopromazide
both are being used successfully, albeit still experimentally, on problem
sprayers.

Good luck

&gt;&gt; I've posted here a while back asking for help, and got a few good
&gt; responses,
&gt;&gt; but my troubles with Pip continue.
&gt;&gt; Here is a description:

&gt;&gt; Pip is 11 months old, was the runt of the litter and lives with Alex (my
4
&gt;&gt; year old cat)

&gt;&gt; - He has some overgrooming problems, so thinking it was
litter
&gt;&gt; allergies, I changed to natural recycled paper pellets
&gt;&gt; - He then started peeing next to the box
&gt;&gt; - Then he peed in my box of recycled newspapers in the
living
&gt;&gt; room (I moved the papers away)
&gt;&gt; - He continues to use that corner
&gt;&gt; - Peed on my jacket on the floor once
&gt;&gt; - Found a wet towel in the bathroom this morning that he
used
&gt;&gt; - Today I just caught him doing it on the carpet in the
living
&gt;&gt; room again (other side of the room from his other accidents)

&gt;&gt; What I've done:
&gt;&gt; - Took him to the vet for a urinary check - no infection,
but
&gt;&gt; moderate amount of crystals in the urine.
&gt;&gt; Vet said to give him more wet food to help that. (I've
&gt;&gt; mostly been giving them dry 95% of the time - so now they are getting
&gt;&gt; plenty of both)
&gt;&gt; - Tried cat repellent spray in the corner
&gt;&gt; - Put a floor mat over there with plastic underneath to keep
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; leak-through off the carpet
&gt;&gt; - Soaked the area with Nature's Miracle (I have the corner
of
&gt;&gt; the carpet pulled up right now to dry - he did it on the floor mat
&gt;&gt; underneath tonight)
&gt;&gt; (Yes, it was soaked with Nature's Miracle also,
and
&gt;&gt; just drying)
&gt;&gt; - Tried club soda
&gt;&gt; - 409 carpet cleaning foam
&gt;&gt; - Sprayed air freshener there
&gt;&gt; - Baking soda
&gt;&gt; - Pet oder baking soda
&gt;&gt; - More Nature's Miracle
&gt;&gt; - Put a small table there to try to block it
&gt;&gt; - I talked to the people at the cat shelter where I got him.

&gt;&gt; I'm sure he has probably used other places on the carpet around the
house
&gt;&gt; that I just haven't found yet.

&gt;&gt; Some other issues:

&gt;&gt; to the skin so it is all bald and bloody in spots.
&gt;&gt; - Vet thought it was food alergy, so I tried special food
