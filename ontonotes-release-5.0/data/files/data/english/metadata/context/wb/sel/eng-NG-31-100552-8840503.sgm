Woo-Hoo! Back home and playing with a &quot;new&quot; Weasel.

It all started when I dropped in to visit Marlen Halverson at Glasgow, Montana on my way
home from South Bend. He advertises a lot of parts/cars in TW, and I figured I'd check out
the flock.

I got the tour, and discovered he had one sad, rusty Weasel there, but which still had a
great many good parts on it, like most of the power train, for instance. So I made a deal
to buy it, and gave him a deposit.

Work got in the way; I was away for 9 weeks.

Marlen called early last week, and said he was going to be going to an auction of vehicles
and wagons, including a Studebaker Six wagon, at Cutbank, Montana. He said he would haul
the Weasel out to Shelby on his trailer, if I were to meet him there, where we could
transfer it.. I said OK, and agreed to meet him Monday morning at Shelby. He told me the
day before he left, &quot;by the way, the body of the Weasel fell apart while I was loading
it.&quot; Well, it WAS rusty.

I got to Shelby about 11:00 Monday morning, after waiting nearly half an hour at the
border just to get the necessary vehicle export form. Well, the Weasel was spread out all
over Marlen's great long wagon-toter trailer, like a Revell kit from H*ll. There was NO
way it could be rolled off one trailer and onto the other. We wandered arounf Shelby
trying to find somebody with a forklift or picker, and finally wound up with me hiring a
big picker truck from the trucking company right next door to the Town Pump truck stop
where we met. This did the job in 15 minutes, with no sweat required. Cost $120, but it
was worth it.

While loading the Weasel, I was back and forth on the cellphone with U.S. Customs and
Border Protection at Whitlash, MT, trying to get the export paperwork for the Weasel
squared away. Finally got that done; the final message being &quot;call me back tomorow at 9:00
A.M. or shortly thereafter.&quot; Spent Monday in the motel at Shelby, and called the Customs
guy in Whitlash the next morning. &quot;Call us back after 4:00 P.M.&quot; and we'll let you know if
there are any hitches with the paperwork.&quot; OK. I went with Marlen to the auction at
Cutbank, some 23 miles west of Shelby. I honestly didn't see a darn thing that felt like
bidding on. Marlen did buy a whole bunch of wagon and buggy stuff, ranging from loose
axles to entire wagons. The &quot;Studebaker&quot; wagon, wasn't. Some unknown running gear with
what MIGHT have been a Studebaker box on it.

4:00 came around, and I called Whitlash again. &quot;Good news, no problems with your
paperwork.&quot; Me:&quot;Does that mean I can head up the road to the Sweetgrass border crossing
now?&quot; &quot;No, we still have to fax the material to Sweetgrass. They won't get it until after
noon tomorrow.&quot;

So I stayed another night in the motel at Shelby, watched TV, and had a few beers at the
bar across the road. I know now what I SHOULD have been doing.... Had a good sleep, slept
late, had a nice big breakfast at the Town Pump cafe, and drove off up the road toward
Sweetgrass, only 30-odd miles from Shelby. Parked in the Sweetgrass rest stop, and called
Whitlash again. &quot;We got the paperwork back from Washington, DC. All is OK. We'll fax it to
Sweetgrass inside of an hour. DON'T go to the crossing until at least an hour has passed.&quot;
Me: &quot;OK, thanks for your patience.&quot;

So I wandered across the road to the Glocca Morra bar, and had a couple of Coors Light.
Danny, the owner of the place, is a big collector of military vehicles, and we chatted
about Weasels, etc. By 1:30, my hour delay had well gone by, so I drove around to the U.S.
Customs office, and went in with my bill of sale. Finally got the export OK'ed, although I
got chewed out for presenting a carbon copy of the bill of sale, and for not having a
document from the state of Montana stating it had never been titled. (It's logically
impossible to prove a negative, anyway, right?) I understand the rationale for having
export controls on vehicles; it prevents stolen cars from being &quot;laundered&quot; in Canada,
which has much slacker rules for registering/titling vehicles. I went through the EXACT
same procedure with my '96 Suburban that I bought in Oregon, but I had done my homework,
and had all the paperwork in order. I was kind of caught off-guard, picking the Weasel up
on short notice, and kind of hoped that somebody at Customs would simply LOOK at the heap
of parts, and make an executive decision: &quot;Yup, that is indeed a heap of parts, not a
vehicle anymore. Have a nice day.&quot; But the rusty relic of a Weasel hull still bore a
serial number, and the hoops had to be jumped through.

Anyhow, I got cleared out of the USA with the poor old wreck, and rolled up the road to
Canadian Customs. Home free? Uh-uh. The gal minding the store in the Canada Customs post
took a look at the Weasel, and said, &quot;I've got to turn you back. There is too much mud and
soil embedded in that thing. You have to go back to the USA and wash it. Department of
Agriculture rules.&quot; Again, a case of the rules making sense in general, but being kind of
ludicrous in the particular, since if some nasty bug exists in the soil of northeastern
Montana, it probably also exists in the soil of nearby southeastern Alberta. Nasty bugs
being no respecters of lines on a map, you know.

But I didn't argue; that would have been pointless, so I took the U-turn route, and went
back into the USA. As luck would have it, the blonde woman who had processed my export of
the Weasel was stationed in the Customs booth as I rolled up, and I told her that I'd been
turned back for excess mud on the Weasel. I said, &quot;I guess that Montana mud isn't good
enough for them.&quot; She laughed and waved me through, saying I would find a coin-op car wash
in Sunburst, about 7 miles down the road.

So I drove down to Sunburst, and tried the car wash on the mud. Effective, NOT. I got out
a screwdriver, and began digging mud and gravel out of the various nooks and crannies in
the suspension, bogie wheels, and body openings. Let me tell you, when it comes to nooks
and crannies, Weasels have the market cornered. I spent 3 hours with a screwdriver and my
fingers, digging mud out of that thing. Then I spent $12.00 at the car wash to spray off
as much of the remainder that I could. I didn't get all of it, but I must have gotten
close to 90% of it, a large part of which simply migrated to my jeans and sweater. I
figured I had made a sincere effort to comply with the soil regulation, and if they wanted
the Weasel &quot;surgically clean&quot;, that I'd simply store it in the lot at Sweetgrass, and come
down with tools and dismantle and clean it right there. But the effort I made proved
sufficient, and they let me in without any trouble, putting the Weasel down as &quot;auto
parts&quot;. So now I have a serial number that I cannot register, since I don't have the K-22
form for it. Not that it's a big issue, since it's an off-road vehicle, anyhow. One
pleasant surprise was that, since I'd been out of country for more than 48 hours, I was
entitled to a $400 exemption on GST, so instead of paying some $60 in tax, I only got
dinged $38.

After getting through the border, the remainder of the trip home was uneventful. Had real
nice weather for the entire trip,

Lessons learned:
1.  There is a booklet available at U.S. Customs, &quot;Exporting a Vehicle / Shippers and
Exporters&quot;, Customs Publication No. 0000-0147. It's also available on the Customs Web
site. According to this booklet, even a parts car is subject to export reporting, and the
age of it is not relevant. If the main body shell, the part that bears the serial number,
is the piece you need, you have to run through the hoops. OTOH, it would appear that a
power train, 4 quarter panels, and a bunch of other loose parts, would not trigger an
export report. If I had left the Weasel hull behind, and just brought engine, power train,
and suspension, I'd have had no trouble.

2. If the vehicle being imported is dirty, or full of trash, clean it out before heading
for the border. Aside from the mud/soil issue, what would happen if the Customs inspector
found a bag of pot under the seat of a car that you were hauling? I'd sooner it were ME to
find and dispose of questionable things like that!

3. If a Canadian buys a used car, or parts car in the USA, he should be sure to get one
of: a good title, released by the title holder of record, or a valid junk or salvage
title, or a bill of sale PLUS a document from the state of origin which indicates that
either no title is required for the vehicle in question, or that it is no longer in the
records. Things like this can take time to get! If the parts car is worth enough to go
many miles to fetch it, then it's worth taking the time to get the paper trail in order.

4. If you get all your ducks in a row, you can notify U.S. Customs by phone, and fax them
the necessary documents several days before your departure, so that the completed
documents are waiting for you at your port of departure from the USA. Makes the whole
process pretty painless.

The U.S. Customs Website is &lt; www.customs.gov &gt; Go there, and you can probably download the
above-described publication as a .pdf file. It's less than 20 pages, and pretty
straightforward. Once you know what documents you need, and where to send them, the actual
process is no big deal, really just a formality for most of the cars that interest people
on this group.

Well, a long, but hopefull not pointless story.

BTW, I did get into Weasel rendering today. I got the two front idler wheels off, and the
swing arms that carry them, and removed the front axle ( a part I need for my driver
Weasel). Pulled out the radiator, and a fuel filter, and several of the brackets that the
track tension springs abut against. Since the front panel of the hull was torn loose and
hanging by a thread, I air-chiseled that off. Rolled the gutted hull sideways off the
trailer all by myself. Not very heavy at all. Still some nifty brackets and gadgets
attached to that gutted hull, like the bracket for the Pyrene

So much for NAFTA, I thought free trade between the U.S. and Canada
was supposed to be easier(?)  They must have looked at you and figured
you had DEEP POCKETS.  The motels, crane company and car wash, were
probably all owned by their friends and relatives.  Thank you for
recycling our junk, but our condolences and an apology is due for the
hassle.

Well, it looks like all the hassle paid off. I pulled the engine out of the chassis today.
It was stuck solid, wouldn't turn. I removed the water pump and its adaptor housing (both
Weasel-only parts, and worth $$$). Water pump was seized, but the engine still didn't
turn.

Removed the distributor (special Weasel part), and the oil filter and filler stack. The
generator and carburetor are missing. Manifolds are there, and the heat riser valve is NOT
stuck. Seems to be 100% OK. Pulled the head off, and all the combustion chambers were
black and oily. A very light coating of surface rust in the visible cylinder bores, and NO
RIDGE! Just a light ring of black carbon above the area swept by the rings. Engine still
didn't turn.

I unfastened the engine mounts (and can use them in my driver Weasel), and used the loader
on the little tractor to lift the engine. That loader is one handy unit. I set the engine
(complete with transmission) aside, and went to work removing the final drive. I uncoupled
the drive shaft from the final drive, and threw it on the ever-growing parts pile. I
didn't have to uncouple the front end, because the U-joint was broken, right through the
cross!

Got the final drive out, and it looks like the rear axle bearings are OK. Nice to have
spares; they are inch-dimensioned roller bearings, and are becoming hard to find. Set the
final drive in the barn, again with the able assistance of the loader.

I began unbolting the suspension arms and guide rollers from what's left of the hull
tunnel, but gave up, as I had reached the end of my air hose, and the air impact doesn't
work well on the extension hose.

I turned my attention to the engine, and began removing the transmission and bell housing.
Got the transmission out, and it was locked up solid. I figured, &quot;Aha! So that's what
happened. The T84 tranny, which is notoriously weak, piled up, and jammed so suddenly that
the momentum of the vehicle sheared off the front U-joint.&quot; Once the locked-up tranny was
removed, and the bellhousing, I put a screw in one of the holes on the back of the block,
and levering against that, was able to rotate the engine with a pry bar. It turned quite
easily, and I pulled it through several revolutions. One or two valves remained in the up
position, but a light tap with a hammer sent them back to their seat. None were stuck
down.

I think this is a very low-time engine. Re-assembled, it will probably run fine as-is. At
worst, it should only need cylinder de-glazing and a fresh set of rings. The engine was
not really stuck at all, just the tranny. I will haul the pan off and clean it, though.
Also, the water jacket is full of crud. But it's definitely a keeper.

Then I took the cover off the transmission, and the doggone thing is LIKE NEW inside!
Gears are bright and shiny, with only the slightest trace of rust. And no chips out of the
first-reverse sliding gear or cluster or reverse idler. None. All that was wrong was it
was locked in first and third together, which of course will jam up any transmission.
Somehow the interlock feature got defeated. I unjammed it, and everything turns just fine.
Full of nice clean oil, too!

So it looks like I got lucky, and got a Weasel which had received a new or rebuilt engine
and tranny, shortly before some calamity caused first and third to engage together and
snap the U-joint. Or maybe the U-joint got snapped by someone trying to tow it while the
tranny was locked up. I guess I'll never know. But that sad-looking heap of parts has
turned up some hidden treasures. It wouldn't surprise me to learn the final drive is a
fresh rebuild, too. I'll have to open it up some day, too.

So I'm quite a happy camper now.

Were the pistons cast iron or aluminum?  I thought I read that due to
war time shortages, Weasels got cast iron(?)  I would think that a
rebuild outside of the military network, would receive aluminum.

They look like cast iron, but I'll have to try them with a magnet. I do have another
Weasel engine here, all apart, and it has cast iron pistons, and Babbitted bearings in it.

Went to another auction sale today, about 20 miles from home. Got a 72&quot; Woods 3-point
hitch rough-cut mower (like a brush hog) for $700, and just fetched it home. I bid on an
Oliver 88 Row Crop, but dropped out when it went over $1200. It was a runner, and sold for
$1400, I think.

Looks like I'll be mowing tomorrow with the tractor.
