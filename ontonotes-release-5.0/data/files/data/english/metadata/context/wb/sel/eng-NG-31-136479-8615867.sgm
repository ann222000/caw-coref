Good morning!
As Jimmy would say &quot;I'm lighting the path&quot;!
I hope Sir James is having the time of his life!

A semi-swoosh... off to class, but I'll be back with the exciting news
of the great mid-north! :)

Morning, Gang!  Another 9-5 shift today:-(  It's absolutely gorgeous,
weather-wise, in Jersey.  Hope everyone gets the same type of weather
today.  Have a great day!!!

You sound tough Joan. I bet she does stay up all night to pack at the
last moment. That's how my kids always did it, too.

Annie, there is a New Jersey instructor coming here to work for a
couple of weeks. She wants to go to some classes, but she is staying
right downtown without a car. I will try to pick her up for one
evening class, but traffic is so bad going in and out of downtown, I
am not sure if it's even doable. I am teaching every morning for two
weeks while she is here, so I can't go to a lot of evening classes in
that time frame.

Hey, Joan, if it's any consolation, Cman is leaving in 4 days and has
not begun to think about packing. He claims he's not taking nearly the
clothes he did last year. He says all he wears are sweats and tees.
(great... my son's a slob at college). Much MUCH more important is the
new flat screen and surround sound system he bought. (Great... my
son's priorities are right there in order!)

Island Sue,
I've been a lurker of this site for a while and decided to join in
since I'm the one who contacted you about classes in Calgary.  I
appreciate your response and hope that I'm able to get to one of your
classes.  I'll know more once I arrive and have a chance to check on
my schedule of meetings.  I know Annie very well.  She and I teach in
the same area in NJ.

Hey, Barbara!  Glad you posted.  It's always nice to have a new name
on the board.  I hope you have time to see some of the beautiful
sights around Calgary while you're there.

Kiddo had a beautiful flight out of town yesterday.  She was able to
nab a &quot;water side&quot; seat on the plane, so the San Juans, Canada, and
Mt. Baker were part of her view.  Seems so quiet here now.....

Oh, forgot to add a few interesting things I learned recently from
Miss H:

She said it's very popular to eat raw egg mixed with rice and soy
sauce for breakfast.  The thought makes my stomach turn.  I asked her
if it was slimey.  She didn't know the word, but looked it up on her
translator real quick and replied &quot;yes&quot;.  Blech.  She usually eats
toast with chocolate sauce on it for breakfast, while her grandma eats
rice.

Sushi is a once a month sort of thing while sashimi is very frequent.
She'd never had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before.  She said
they make jelly sandwiches and peanut butter sandwiches, but not
peanut butter and jelly.  Their peanut butter must be more liquidy
than what we use (Ad*ms or organic in our house) because she said the
peanut butter sandwich doesn't stick to your mouth.  Hmmm.

She said they have salami or shrimp on pizza, had never heard of
canadian bacon or pepperoni.  When we bought one at our favorite
gourmet u-bake last night she selected a tropical hawaiian (our fave)
and loved the canadian bacon and crumbled bacon on it.

Barbara, what a small world!! Until Annie mentioned Jersey this
morning I forgot she lived there. So I kind of wondered if there was a
tiny chance she may know you-and that's why I posted the info here.
WELCOME to Mega Talk!!

Anyways, I am trying to see if anyone can pick you up the first week
you're here to take you to a class. My daughter is home the first
week, so I am pretty sure I won't be available. The second week, I can
pick you up on a Monday or a Wednesday to go to Patsy's class. If I
pick you up at 5:30 then we can get there in plenty of time.

I am awaiting emails from other instructors to see if anyone else can
do the same so we can get you to a few classes. I think Taxi's would
be way too costly to get you in and out and the trains and buses would
never get you there on time. There is one class that may be close
enough to Taxi there, but we'll see what that instructor says. I know
she has picked up people before for class, but it depends on her day
work, etc.

You are staying across the street from the most beautiful YMCA I have
ever seen, so you should be able to exercise every night if you want
to venture out into some other fitness classes. You can google &quot;Eau
Claire YMCA, Calgary&quot; and you should be able to see a schedule.

We'll have to exchange phone numbers by email so we can stay in touch
at that time. Hope to chat soon and be sure to post some more. We're a
pretty friendly bunch here.

Just checking in briefly... no rest for the weary! And my phone has
been ringing like crazy over the past 10 minutes. Go fig! I feel very
important. :-D

I've forgotten how much I love kindergarten. It's GREAT!! I am so at
home in my classroom! And this afternoon was bliss. I had the boys and
girls all stretched out for rest time and put on a zen-like CD... they
were OUT. Not a peep other than some snoring... lol... I actually let
them rest for about 35 minutes because they were so peaceful! Deep
sleep, too... waking them up was tough. I turned the lights on, played
upbeat music, and still... not a twitch. Started calling names,
tapping shoulders... they still looked a little dazed when they
finally got loaded onto their buses to go home! LOL! Guess I wore em
out.

My former CO and close friend, Kelly, is coming back to town to visit
this weekend! I'm sooo excited! (She moved to TN and sold to our
current CO at the end of May, if you missed that.) This week is our
Open House at Jazzercise and we're doing a special class (party stuff,
props, and all 6 instructors teaching.) She'll be there as a student
and I'm sure there will be some food involved. Lots of fun planned.

Bah for now!

Is Kelly teaching in TN?? Let us know how she likes it there. It will
be fun for the two of you to reunite.
Have fun with your Open House, too.

&gt; Just checking in briefly... no rest for the weary! And my phone has
&gt; been ringing like crazy over the past 10 minutes. Go fig! I feel very
&gt; important. :-D

&gt; I've forgotten how much I love kindergarten. It's GREAT!! I am so at
&gt; home in my classroom! And this afternoon was bliss. I had the boys and
&gt; girls all stretched out for rest time and put on a zen-like CD... they
&gt; were OUT. Not a peep other than some snoring... lol... I actually let
&gt; them rest for about 35 minutes because they were so peaceful! Deep
&gt; sleep, too... waking them up was tough. I turned the lights on, played
&gt; upbeat music, and still... not a twitch. Started calling names,
&gt; tapping shoulders... they still looked a little dazed when they
&gt; finally got loaded onto their buses to go home! LOL! Guess I wore em
&gt; out.

&gt; My former CO and close friend, Kelly, is coming back to town to visit
&gt; this weekend! I'm sooo excited! (She moved to TN and sold to our
&gt; current CO at the end of May, if you missed that.) This week is our
&gt; Open House at Jazzercise and we're doing a special class (party stuff,
&gt; props, and all 6 instructors teaching.) She'll be there as a student
&gt; and I'm sure there will be some food involved. Lots of fun planned.

&gt; Bah for now!

&gt; &gt; Barbara, what a small world!! Until Annie mentioned Jersey this
&gt; &gt; morning I forgot she lived there. So I kind of wondered if there was a
&gt; &gt; tiny chance she may know you-and that's why I posted the info here.
&gt; &gt; WELCOME to Mega Talk!!

&gt; &gt; Anyways, I am trying to see if anyone can pick you up the first week
&gt; &gt; you're here to take you to a class. My daughter is home the first
&gt; &gt; week, so I am pretty sure I won't be available. The second week, I can
&gt; &gt; pick you up on a Monday or a Wednesday to go to Patsy's class. If I
&gt; &gt; pick you up at 5:30 then we can get there in plenty of time.

&gt; &gt; I am awaiting emails from other instructors to see if anyone else can
&gt; &gt; do the same so we can get you to a few classes. I think Taxi's would
&gt; &gt; be way too costly to get you in and out and the trains and buses would
&gt; &gt; never get you there on time. There is one class that may be close
&gt; &gt; enough to Taxi there, but we'll see what that instructor says. I know
&gt; &gt; she has picked up people before for class, but it depends on her day
&gt; &gt; work, etc.

&gt; &gt; You are staying across the street from the most beautiful YMCA I have
&gt; &gt; ever seen, so you should be able to exercise every night if you want
&gt; &gt; to venture out into some other fitness classes. You can google &quot;Eau
&gt; &gt; Claire YMCA, Calgary&quot; and you should be able to see a schedule.

&gt; &gt; We'll have to exchange phone numbers by email so we can stay in touch
&gt; &gt; at that time. Hope to chat soon and be sure to post some more. We're a
&gt; &gt; pretty friendly bunch here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Island Sue,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been a lurker of this site for a while and decided to join in
&gt; &gt; &gt; since I'm the one who contacted you about classes in Calgary.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate your response and hope that I'm able to get to one of your
&gt; &gt; &gt; classes.  I'll know more once I arrive and have a chance to check on
&gt; &gt; &gt; my schedule of meetings.  I know Annie very well.  She and I teach in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same area in NJ.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Annie, there is a New Jersey instructor coming here to work for a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couple of weeks. She wants to go to some classes, but she is staying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right downtown without a car. I will try to pick her up for one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evening class, but traffic is so bad going in and out of downtown, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am not sure if it's even doable. I am teaching every morning for two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weeks while she is here, so I can't go to a lot of evening classes in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that time frame.

Yup! Last I heard, she was starting out with 2 classes/week and had
been approved to be their newest MA. I heard a few stories about
classes she visited... and it sounded like she might be able to help
out some people. She's a *great* instructor. Hey - she got *me*
through workshop! ;-)
