Up until about 1960, Romania was a good, docile Soviet satellite.  The
Romanian leader, Ghirghiu Dej, was one of the "little Stalins" and a
good, conservative Communist.  The Romanians had firmly supported the
ostracism of Tito and the Soviet intervention in Hungary.

And then they went all nationalist.  The reasons for this are
complicated and various.  One was festering resentment over rough
Soviet treatment after WWII.  Another was revulsion and outrage at
Comecon economic plans that would have reduced Romania to an agrarian
backwater providing food and raw materials for industrialized
Communist states.  But one big factor was that Dej and Khruschev
couldn't stand each other.  Dej was one of those Communist leaders --
Mao was another -- who regarded Comrade Nikita as a pathetic travesty
of Stalin, a baboon succeeding a tiger.  Dej kept his opinion hidden
until after Soviet troops left Romania (summer 1958) but after that
his contempt was increasingly obvious.

OTL Khrushchev grew increasingly annoyed with Dej and his nationalist
line, and finally tried to have him overthrown.  However, without
actual Soviet troops in country, his options were limited.  He wasn't
quite willing to invade... after all, Romania wasn't going as badly
renegade as Hungary.  So he tried to get some local Romanian Party
leaders to depose Dej.

Alas, the chosen leader of the pro-Soviet coup -- a fellow named Emil
Bodnaras, former Minister of War and now Deputy party leader -- was
loyal to Dej, or at least to Romania.  Bodnaras promptly turned around
and reported the coup plans to Dej, and the whole thing never got past
the planning stage.

Part of the problem was that Khrushchev tried this in 1963.  By which
time Dej was pretty much untouchable... he'd purged everyone of
questionable loyalty back in the 1950s, and in the early 1960s had
reinforced his position further with calculated appeals to
nationalism.  (As one writer has noted, in the 1950s Romanian
Communism relied on Moscow to protect them from the people, but by the
1960s they were using the people to protect them from Moscow.)  Dej
didn't go nearly as far as Ceausescu later would, but by 1963 he had
already established himself as a Romanian patriot struggling against
the... /misguided/ comrades in Moscow.

(In this case, it helped that Dej was a home-bred Communist who had
spent the war years in jail in Romania, not a "Muscovite" arriving in
the Red Army's baggage train.  Romania was unique among the eastern
European satellites in this regard; everywhere else, the Muscovites
had triumphed over the local Communists.  But Dej had two advantages:
first, he was utterly devoted to Stalin and Stalinism; and second, his
rival Ana Pauker, the leader of the Romanian Muscovites, was a woman
and a Jew.)

To make this work, Khrushchev has to try it earlier, no later than
1961, and he needs to find someone more... flexible, than Emil
Bodnaras.

There are two possible candidates.  But Ion Maurer was probably too
honest, if that word is meaningful in this context... he was a serious
Communist, back in the day, but also a Romanian patriot.  That leaves
Dej's #3, fortyish Nicolae Ceausescu.

Would Ceausescu be willing to head a Moscow-backed coup against Dej in
1960?  You know, much as I loathe the man, I'm inclined to doubt it.
While his nationalism was obnoxious -- totalitarian, racist, and
grounded largely in fantasy -- it seems to have been sincere.  It's a
little like asking if Hitler, c. 1925, would have been willing to
become a paid agent of the French.  You don't have to be an admirer to
acknowledge that this is unlikely.  One can be very evil without being
every sort of evil.

So Khrushchev has to find someone else.  We'll call him Puppetescu.
Puppetescu is either a true-believing Communist internationalist (rare
at all times anywhere, and very rare indeed in Romania) or a totally
sleazy, amoral opportunist.  Puppetescu doesn't have much support in
the Party, but he does have some allies in the Securitate, which was
heavily infiltrated with Soviet agents (OTL it would take Ceausescu
twenty years to weed them out, and the evidence is he never did get
them all).  If Khrushchev moves early and decisively, I think he's got
a shot.

Let's say it gets as far as a no-kidding coup attempt.  I say coup,
because even in 1960 -- when Dej was only just experimenting with
nationalism, and not seriously contemplating a threat from Moscow --
he was in pretty strong control of both government and Party.  Without
Soviet troops in Bucharest, Puppetescu won't be able to swing a
peaceful deposition by Party Congress.  So he'll have to use the
Securitate to bushwhack Dej, throw him in the pokey, grab the TV and
radio stations, and declare a fait accomplit with immediate and loud
support from Moscow.

Two possibilities here: the coup succeeds, or it doesn't.  Both those
can go in interesting directions...

Pause here.  Thoughts?

It _could_ work-plenty of deviation exists after all. But this _can't_
make the other puppets happy. I don't know that much about the
politics of the Bloc at the time, but this intervention seems to be
more dangerous then that in Hungary, where the were honest to goodness
liberals about. Also this is before the full Sino-Soviet split, making
it a precedent of sorts, and not a good one.

If it doesn't work at once, then the situation gets very delicate. Normally
such coups, when not immediately successful, are easily crushed, but in this
case there is the strong meddlesome neighbor supporting Puppetescu... would
the Soviets drop Puppetescu and deny their involvement, or would they claim
that the Romanian people is begging their Communist brothers to intervene?
Another question, in case internecine strife goes on for more than just a
few days, is what happens in Transylvania. Suppose some figure of the
Hungarian minority publicly supports the internationalist, non-nationalist
Puppetescu.

As I think about it, this looks more and more like a low probability
WI.  OTL, Khrushchev didn't get will and truly pissed at Dej until
1962.  By that time, Dej was probably invulnerable to anything short
of invasion.  This seems to have been deliberate on Dej's part... he
spent a decade methodically eliminating threats and rivals, then
played the nationalism card to strengthen his position internally, /
then/ confronted Moscow.

TTL, we have to somehow make Khrushchev almost blind with rage by 1960
or so.  I'm not sure how to do that.  The key POD might be in Dej
himself... perhaps we can give him a microstroke that affects his
judgment, causing him to be less cautious with Moscow.  Yeah, it's a
stretch.  But we'll say he becomes intolerably insolent the instant
the Soviet troops leave Romania (1958), instead of slowly ramping up
the gain over several years.

So, a Moscow-backed coup.  Let's take the simpler track first and say
it succeeds.

I think the first effect will be the satellites falling more closely
into line with Moscow.  With Dej's fate in mind, the various satellite
leaders will be noticeably more docile and respectful.  Not that they
were exactly pulling Moscow's nose OTL, but we've probably eliminated
the Prague spring.

The more important long term effect, though, will be to ramp the
paranoia way, way up.  This is reminiscent of the Bulgarian coup WI
from last week.  But in that TL, the threat was from the military...
bad, but manageable.  In this TL, Moscow has penetrated and turned a
satellite's own security services, using them to overthrow the local
boss and put a puppet into power.  Since al the satellite leaders rely
heavily on those same security services, this is really going to tie
them in knots.

Not just in Eastern Europe, either... the Chinese Communist
leadership, just edging into the Sino-Soviet split, is going to just
go nuts.  OTL the "desovietization" of the Chinese party was a
relatively mild and bloodless affair.  TTL it will probably be much
nastier.

Meanwhile, Moscow will probably be pretty cocky for a while.  OTL
their satellites presented them with a dilemma that they were never
fully able to resolve: Soviet dominance was backed by the threat of
force, but the exercise of that force would have massively negative
side effects.  It was like using a cattle prod to keep order in a
kindergarten.  The Soviet system suffered from a painful lack of soft
power.

TTL, they've been able to knock down an uppity nationalist before he
even got properly started.  That's going to make them think that this
is a viable option.  It seems like that could lead them in a lot of
different directions, most of them wacky.

Thoughts?

What about if Hungary for whatever reason doesn't have either
the uprising of 1956 or the consequences? Without that in mind, perhaps
Dej is more willing to take the risk of pissing Moscow off.

Funny but it seems that in OTL Moscow managed to topple Dej, although
five years later and with an unwanted effect. See what Gen- Ion Mihaj
Pacepa, the then head of the Romanian Intelligence Service, wrote in
Nov. 2006: 'On Sunday, March 20, 1965, I paid my last visit to
Gheorghiu-Dej's winter residence in Predeal. As usual, I found him
with his best friend, Chivu Stoica, Romania's honorary head. Dej
complained of feeling weak, dizzy, and nauseous. "I think the KGB got
me," he said, only half in jest... During the March 12, 1965,
elections for Romania's Grand National Assembly, Gheorghiu-Dej still
looked vigorous. A week later, however, he died of a galloping form of
cancer. "Assassinated by Moscow" is what the new Romanian leader,
Nicolae Ceausescu, whispered to me a few months after that.
"Irradiated by the KGB," he murmured in an even lower voice, claiming,
"That was firmly established by the autopsy."

Or maybe not.

Speculating from total absence of knowledge...

I would guess that the "pro-Soviet" element in the CCP
was only moderately less nationalist (autonomist?) than
the Mao faction, and almost certainly not as servile
to Moscow as the Bulgarian affair would seem to demand.

They too would see the Bulgarian affair as suggesting
a similar threat to China, which they would fear.

Besides that, they would want to avoid any possibility
of being viewed as Moscow's local agents in a similar
plot.

The reaction in China would probably be a universal
repudiation of Moscow allegiance, with formerly pro-
Soviet figures leading the chorus.

Perhaps.

Dej's death was a little... odd.  He was 63 and seemed, as far as
anyone could tell, in robust good health.  Then he just keeled over
after a brief illness.

Other hand, it wasn't /weird/ odd.  I mean, the man was born in rural
Romania in 1902.  He'd already outlived his life expectancy by a
decade or two.  And like a lot of Communist leaders, he enjoyed the
high life -- mistresses, cigars, good booze.  Fun, but not playing the
odds.

Well, Pacepa is a very important source.  But he has to be taken with
a grain of salt.  Here he's giving us a forty-year-old reminiscence of
something he says Ceausescu told him.

Do I find this theory implausible?  No, not at all.  But I wouldn't
call it /likely/, based on the information we have.

Note that the KGB, in Soviet times, didn't much use radiological
weapons.  Ceausescu, on the other hand, did -- a number of expatriate
and dissident Romanians dropped dead of cancer after the Securitate
poisoned them with radiation.  So, Ceausescu can't be considered a
reliable source here.
