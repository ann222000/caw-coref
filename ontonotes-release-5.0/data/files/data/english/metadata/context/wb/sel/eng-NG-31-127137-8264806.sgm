Important news from SEG America

The Segway Enthusiasts Group of America is undergoing a significant
transformation.

As you know, volunteer organizations rely on consistent stewardship
and activity in order to prosper.  While both our membership and
general interest has continued to grow throughout the years, the
volunteer effort has not.  In fact this year we did not receive enough
nominations for the SEG America Executive Board to remain in
compliance with our bylaws. Simply put, we no longer have the
volunteer resources necessary to maintain and grow SEG America.

Because of this, the current entity of SEG America will officially
retire on August 31, 2007.  There is a silver lining, however.
Segway Inc. believes in this community and would like to continue
nurturing it in a new way.  It sees an opportunity working with and
for Segway enthusiasts and hopes to come up with practical and
creative ways to grow membership and involvement.

We expect this transition to take some time and we hope you will
support their efforts and continue your involvement.  We believe our
group and its founding objectives will be well served under a more
consistent and motivated stewardship via Segway Inc., a company that
has always supported our efforts and is now ready to take them to the
next level.  Your SEG America membership will be one of the starting
points for the launch of this new effort.

What will happen to SEG America's assets?  Remaining assets will be
reallocated within the Segway Enthusiast community.

It has been our honor as the Executive Board of SEG America to serve
this organization over the last three years.  We have made many
friends, and we have all had some good times.  We thank you all for
that.

For more news about the SEG America transition, stay tuned to Segway
Inc.'s &quot;The Last Mile&quot; blog at http://www.segway.com/blog .  We
encourage all of you to continue to glide with pride, be good and
responsible Segway citizens, find opportunities to glide with your
friends, and continue a long and successful life in the Segway
community.
