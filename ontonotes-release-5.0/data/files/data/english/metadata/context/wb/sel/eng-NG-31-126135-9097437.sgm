I've been doing some research for a long fiction project I'm
working on, and I've got a scenario where a futuristic antimatter
weapon (something like a Star Trek-style photon torpedo --
antimatter held in a magnetic bottle) is used to take out a
planetside coastal city (and probably a significant radius
around the city). The city is Sydney, Australia, for the curious.

I (and, in-story, the instigators of the explosion) would like
for it to be significant enough to cause some tidal and/or
geological effects elsewhere in the world, but to be blunt I
don't really know where to start researching this. The
aggressors are using a large bomb -- larger than Hiroshima,
probably larger than Czar Bomba -- deliberately with the intent
that it both destroy the city and cause significant short-term
crises elsewhere, in order to make immediate organized
retaliation / searching / discovery more difficult. In other words,
I would like to choose an appropriate megatonnage to bring
about some geological and/or tidal effects without something
likely to render the planet uninhabitable or destroy civilization
in places that aren't Australia.

I've checked the Nuclear Weapons FAQ at nuclearweaponarchive.org,
but they don't seem to have a lot of information on tidal or geologic
effects of large blasts; I'm specifically /not/ looking for effects
like
nuclear winter that wreck the planet long-term. I'm not an expert
on the environmental effects of large explosions, though I do know
about basic things like EMPs, and can research nuclear winter.
I've also read most of the past threads here on Google about using
antimatter for pseudonukes, and while they're very informative, I'm
not seeing the tidal/geological info I'm looking for.

I was hoping someone here might be able to recommend good
sources on these kind of effects from larger-than-nuke detonations.
Are there any good speculative science books or articles about
planetary effects of large-scale blasts? Is it even _possible_ to
have large environmental impacts (tidal waves, earthquakes, etc.)
on other continents with a blast not large enough to cause
nuclear winter or other planet-wrecking side effects?

I haven't been able to find a FAQ for this group; if these kind of
research questions are bad/off topic, I apologize. If they're kosher,
great; I'll have more in the future! :)

I've found two articles that might point up what you're looking for, at
least in general terms.

http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/asteroid_paine_septem...

The above web page talks about the effects of asteroid strikes on Earth's
oceans. From a brief glance, not a good thing, for your proposed
tsunami/tectonic effects.

http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mystery_monday_040412.html

This points to an article which in turn points to an online calculator
which you might care to use to compute the effects of an asteroid of given
size hitting the earth. This might be a bit more along the lines of what
you're looking for.

The actual calculator is here: http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/impacteffects

And here's another one just to give you an idea of the kinds of energies
involved in your little bomb blast:
http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/tsunami_asteroid_030602.html

I'm mentioning the subject of asteroid impact, for the very simple reason
that, when you're talking about explosions involving anti-matter, exotic
substances, or other hand-wavium, you're into the range of more
megatonnage than the typical nuke is capable of, irrespective of what the
doom-sayers might try to predict. Asteroid strikes do generate those kinds
of energies, and similar, if not identical results. They're a very good
substitute.

HTH.

It's actually nice to see Australia mentioned. Quite a lot of books just
stick to the northern hemisphere. I'm glad the RAAF get a look in as
well.

Environmental effects -- nuclear winter type stuff -- will be felt
long before tectonic ones.

One possible comparandum: the Tambora eruption of 1815.  Tambora's
total energy is estimated in the low tens of gigatons range.  It
didn't set off any secondary earthquakes, but it sharply affected
global climate.  Tambora gave rise to the &quot;Year Without A Summer&quot; as
aerosols from the eruption spread throughout the atmosphere, blocking
sunlight.

-- Interestingly, the mechanisms were different in different places.
In North America, temperatures didn't drop by much, but there were
killing frosts in June and September, which drastically shortened
growing seasons and wiped out harvests.

(This actually shows up in US history if you look closely.  The bad
harvests gave rise to a spurt of emigration from New England south and
west, giving a shot in the arm to the development of western
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.  Towns like Cleveland and Cincinnati
show a sudden surge in population growth rates in the late 18-teens.)

In Europe, on the other hand, average temperatures seem to have
dropped by about 3 degrees centigrade or over 5 Fahrenheit.  Glaciers
advanced in the Alps and icebergs invaded the North Sea.  The climate
generally became much cooler and wetter, with few sunny days and
abnormal amounts of rain.  The harvests were not hit as badly as in
America, but the net effects may have been worse, as Europeans were
less well nourished and less mobile than Americans. (N.B., at this
period the US was still on average poorer than western Europe -- but
Americans ate better.)   Cooler and damper conditions led to crop
blights, and malnutrition may have helped trigger a typhus outbreak
that killed 65,000 people in Britain and Ireland.

East Asia felt it too; China saw a bad harvest and devastating floods
from heavy rains.

The rest of the world seems to have been affected to various degrees.
Africa, South Africa and most of South America barely noticed, but
Argentina saw a bit of cooling, and India saw a famine that has not
been well documented but was certainly large.  Oddly, the Arctic seems
to have barely been affected at all.

In Europe and North America, food reserves were enough to get through
one bad harvest -- though it was noted that deer and even raccoons
disappeared from forests across settled America, as hungry people went
hunting.   Probably a lot of people starved in China and India, but
these are not well documented.

Things to note about Tambora:

1) The effects were distributed quite unevenly, probably because of
global circulation pattersn in the high atmosphere.  These are still
imperfectly understood, so you could probably handwave anything you
liked -- &quot;New York freezes, but Tokyo hardly notices&quot;.

2)  The eruption was in 1815, but the freezes and famines were in
1816.  IOW, it took about a year for the effects to be fully felt.
This is not perfectly suitable for dramatic impact, but again, there's
room for a lot of handwaving -- Tambora may have been slow to affect
world climate because the initial injection of aerosols was into a
relatively calm area of wind around the equator.  So, you could
probably get away with nuclear winter-type effects appearing within
weeks to months.

A volcanic eruption doesn't map perfectly to an antimatter bomb --
Tambora released tens of gigatons of energy, but over a period of
several days.  I suspect you could get a rough Tambora equivalent with
a bomb in the 5-10 gigaton range.

C&amp;P from old articles of mine. If any parts seem to come out
of left field, blame my crappy editing:

Wave formation:

Stolen without attribution from _Hazards Due to Comets &amp; Asteroids_

Wave height, impact in shallow water:

h = 1450 m [d/r] [y/gigatons]^1/4

h = wave height
d = water depth
r = range to impact
y = yield

ditto, impact in deep water:

h = 6.5 m [y/gigaton]^0.54 [1000km/r]

Wave run in:

Xmax ~ 1.0 km [h/10 meters]^4/3

And this really is a *very* rough rule of thumb. Consider
what happens to a 10 meter wave hitting the cliffs of Dover vs
Bangladesh (with 17 million people roughly 1 meter above high
tide, IIRC).

As I recall, parts of HAZARDS are lifted right out of THE EFFECTS
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS so this shouldn't be too far off for your purposes.

This depends on things like the altitude where the explosion is.

Asteroids explode at a specific heights. With nuclear bombs, there are
options.

A nuclear or antimatter explosion sufficiently far above ground does
not raise much dust. What it does is heat a large volume of air, which
rises up and eventually cools back to air. There is also little water
waves or ground shaking caused.

An explosion under shallow ground may form a big crater. But if the
depth is larger, most of the displaced earth would settle on the
crater rim, with little dust rising to upper airs.

If you want widespread tectonic/seismic effects, but no nuclear
winter, make the explosion deep underground. A strong compression
shock wave would be pretty devastating on close distance, and could be
rather intimidating on larger distances...

Agreed, although I'd have trouble with any surface burst doing much
tectonicly, without some other amazingly horrendous (climate)
consequences. Tsunami, however, should be rather easy to induce, just
drop a large rock (or make a large explosion - as mention up-thread,
essentially the same thing at these scales) into the water. The
problem with a Sydney-based event doing this effectively is there's
just not a lot of water there - a deep-water impact on the scale of
500-1000 m impactor (or the equivilent) would be far more efficient.

One issue: if the epicenter is Sydney, you're not going to get very
big tsunamis anywhere but some Pacific islands and New Zealand.

(Because the Pacific is quite large.  Even a gigaton detonation won't
produce such a huge wave at a range of 10,000+ miles.)

Tsunamis are dramatic, but really -- if you want max collateral
damage, go with a ground burst.  A Tambora-equivalent will knock a
noticeable hole in the world's economy and (indirectly) kill millions
of people.  A Tambora-times-one-order-of-magnitude might /collapse/
the world's economy, or damn close.  Trying to fight off an alien
invasion while the world has gone into ferrets-in-a-sack mode... well,
it's not as Kewl as a 50-meter wave taking out Los Angeles, but it
would be more likely to work.

More likely the effects appear differently in different places because
different places have differing climatic drivers.  NY could freeze
because the Gulf Stream got a lot colder - but Tokyo doesn't have a
warming current to suddenly get cooler.

I have no expertise to base my conclusion on, but I have always thought
that that would be the case. Anti-matter anihilates totally in presence of
matter, resulting in hard radiation, photons, who knows what all. An
asteroid strike generates physical energy and heat, things like that. The
practical upshot is, you're going to have different blast effects between
the two.

The two do overlap in some degree - how much, I'm not willing to even
speculate - in that they both can cause tsunami, over pressure, etc.

That is what I was thinking of, when I suggested the idea of asteroid
strike.

Someone analyzed antimatter compared to nuclear explosions, and found
antimatter releases more of the energy in heat and prompt radiation,
less in blast and fallout.

However, as a general rule, the bigger the explosion the less
significant the difference, at least when there's air, water or other
forms of matter in the way to catch whatever the initial output is and
convert it to other forms. A 20 kiloton explosion in atmosphere will be
quite different if caused by antimatter, nuclear bomb or asteroid
impact. 20 megatons, less different. 20 gigatons, less again.
