Who do people here use for Life Insurance in Australia?
I've just had a policy application with REST rejected because I fly! Before
I filled out the forms, I verified with them that anything up to 100 hours
per year would be fine, and not attract extra premiums! I rang them this
morning after getting the rejection, and they said they'd been informed to
reject any application from people who fly! Bloody ridiculous if no-one will
insure pilots. The guy told me that he thought the rejection was a wrong
decision in my case as I'd be flying less than 30 hours a year, but he
couldn't change the decision. He said he'd forwarded my file on to the Hong
Kong office to see if they will change their mind, but he said they'd
probably put an aviation exclusion on the policy. I told him if they did
that, they could stick their policy where the sun don't shine, and, I'd be
moving my Superannuation from REST to another fund.
Good way to kill off an industry!

Many life insurance companies refuse pilots.
They work purely on statistical data, and that data says refuse pilots.
Also, I'm suprised that you are suprised that they don't make exceptions
for someone flying less that 30 hours per year. It doesn't follow that
the less hours you fly, the safer you are. In fact, quite the opposite
would seem to be the norm..

I understand that, and I also agree that the less you fly, surely, the less
safe you would be. Having said that, when I phoned them before sending in
the forms, _they_ told _me_ that under 100 hours a year was fine, and would
attract no extra premiums.

My insurance company asked if I was going to fly commercially when I
told them I was getting flying lessons.  When I said no I'd just be a
private pilot they said OK no problem and left my premiums as they were.

Then I would also be quite upset.
I hope that you can find a company who keeps their word.
Hmmmm - insurance and keeps their word in the same sentence?
Now there is a first :)

He has said before (here) that he got his handle in his sim days, and that it
would be difficult to change, because so many know him with that name.

Although I applaud him for getting into real planes (unlike other Losers found
around these parts lately), I also think it would be a wise move to transfer
into a new name.  Something like "gentle lander"- formerly known as "crash
lander."  Doing that in his sig for a while might let others know of the name
change, then drop the "crash lander" part after a period of time.

I know of  a couple of people in this group, that also post in other groups
I post to. One of those people use a different name in here, than they do in
the sim group.
In the sim, if I crash, it doesn't matter, so the name Crash Lander has no
consequence. Out here, if I crash, it would not be so inconsequetial.
Therefore, from this post on, I will no longer call myself Crash Lander in
real pilot ng's. I will call myself Oz Lander.
How's that sound to you guys?

Well, I think that considering your newsgroup 'handle' as a window into
your skills as a pilot is beyond silly and I just can't imagine why some
folks here thinks that it's that important.

But in the end, it's your call.

I'm in Ireland so can't help you choose insurers in Oz.  But I can
tell you my premiums doubled when I confessed to being a PPL.  And
that's on a joint policy with my non-flying wife so I consider that to
be effectively a 300% loading.  For 20 hrs a year or so in the air.  I
spend 400 hours a year in a car and they don't care about that.  Lazy
actuaries I reckon.
