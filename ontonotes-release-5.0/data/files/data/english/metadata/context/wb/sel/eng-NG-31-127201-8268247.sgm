LONDON -- Two Royal Air Force jets shadowed a Russian strategic bomber
that approached British air space last week, the Ministry of Defense said
Tuesday.

The incident occurred Friday, the same day Russian President Vladimir
Putin flexed his military's muscle by placing strategic bombers back on
long-range patrol for the first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
&quot;

are we to believe that fancy red star actually makes this plane russian?
i think rove's back at the white house, and in a big way. Â maybe a war
with russia approved by democrats (who later deflect and detract) is just
the thing this war on radical islam (er, terror) needs.... a new enemy
(er, 08' election deflection)!
