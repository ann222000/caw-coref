I knew it's kerosene, just don't know what the original poster's

Isn't Jet A up to $4 a gallon or so?  You'd have to be getting it

$3.75 where I'm at. I have to drain the sumps daily, back in the old
days we just drained it onto the gravel lot, now we have to capture it
so I take it home every night and heat my garage (as well as my 20000

it's just a "sheep herd" question.  allegedly there's some nascar

if he is, it's not necessarily his fault.  the radio pundits were all
using the words "jet fuel", even the alleged transgressor, when
interviewed, called it "jet fuel".  that's why i think it's media hype.
no professional driver that knows a wheel from a wrench would call
avgas "jet fuel".  "jet fuel" is great for sound bites though.

Who says NASCAR has to run its races to suit *you*?  NASCAR is a
business, whose interest is putting butts in seats, not developing
tomorrow's technology.  And they're pretty damn good at it.

You don't like it, that's fine.  Some find a circle-track to be boring,
and I am fine with that.  But in NASCAR, there is passing, drafting, and
the occasional wreck (more in a plate race).  In F1, the finishes are
almost always dependent on the qualifying position.  There is hardly ever
a photo-finish, and passing in a turn is almost unheard of.  Not to

pass, then wait a while before you see anything else.

You watch what you like, and I'll watch what I like, but to dismiss
NASCAR's popularity simply because they don't make your car better is just

forgot to mention - the "jet fuel" thing was per commentary on sports
radio.  i was in the car out of my local f.m. radio region for a good
deal of that day, so had sports radio on a.m. on the dial.  and all the
pre-race talk and interviews were about "cheating" and the use of "jet
fuel".  they even had a phone interview with the driver concerned and he
used the words "jet fuel" when discussing the alleged infraction.  so,
you and i know it's b.s. to use those words, but that was the way it was
presented to the public.  and because it was clearly incorrect, and was
a term used by a professional driver who i think /most/ unlikely to be
so ignorant, /that/ is why i say it was media stir-em-up, not reality.
nothing like a little controversy to get a few more eyeballs on the screen.

&gt;You don't like it, that's fine.  Some find a circle-track to be boring,

&gt;the occasional wreck (more in a plate race).  In F1, the finishes are
&gt;almost always dependent on the qualifying position.  There is hardly ever
&gt;a photo-finish, and passing in a turn is almost unheard of.  Not to
&gt;mention that, for a spectator, it is dull as hell.  You see a blur of cars
&gt;pass, then wait a while before you see anything else.

I guess F1 makes greater demands on the car, the driver and the
spectators.  It isn't dull if you understand what is going on.  The
only way to pass in a turn (as opposed the going into a turn) is if
the turn is so wide and forgiving that multiple lines can be driven
with equal speed.

I got free tickets to an oval track race a couple years ago and was
amazed to see two cars drive side-by-side for three laps.  It may be
exciting as a horse race, but obviously it isn't very demanding of the
participants.

Way to step around the point, there.  Always easier to point out the
silly things in someone *else's* culture, ain't it?
