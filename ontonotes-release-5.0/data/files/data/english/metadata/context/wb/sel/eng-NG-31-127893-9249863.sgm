I have had Dell puters for years - cannot actually say that have ever had

Agree with you there Andy, I have Dell towers and laptops and had no
problems with them, find the build quality quite good. The laptops are
probably the most user friendly on the market to break down and rebuild.

I have used my Dell Latitude C640 for DJ work for about a year and it only
crashes when I try to play a song that's too long, (anything longer than
about 8mins) as although I have 1Gb of memory, DJ programs are very memory
hungry. I have a PCMIA USB card, 2 external HDDs, Printer, Broadband modem,
and a external DVDRW.

I am one for making my PC work to the max and always make sure it's runnig
at top speed. As far as I'm concerned Dell make good laptops, but I agree
that thier desktops are a bit nasty. Not easy to upgrade them with generic
parts.

On the Dell desktops I have had trouble with the power supplies being
different (differently wired connectors to the norm and slimline power
supplies), floppy drives being different.

Hard Drives, CD ROM Drives, memory all standard parts not just tied to Dell.
If I ever had one critiscm it was/is that on the cheap Dell Budget entry
level desktops it was/is the onboard graphics (sharing PC RAM) and onboard
sound rather than plug in PCI and AGP cards. Acoustics (cooling fans) have
always been super silent IMO. Mainboards they have used seemed to have been
high quality not cheap Taiwan crap and the cases haven't been too bad design
easy to get into and service with plenty of room.

The Dell inspiron laptops extremely good value for money, good specs - tough
plastics used and at only 499 euro great price for an everyday laptop for
surfing net and checking emails (once you remove all the crapware Dell
install on the laptop!)

Walk into any of the stores/offices/banks/businesses/clinics/auto parts
stores,etc around here and you will see almost all of them use Dell
computers, mostly Dell desktop computers.They are Dell business
computers.I think Dell contracts them out to businesses.

I think its more to do with just because they are cheap. I think its the
name a well. down at my local PC World they have some entry level desktops
and notebooks with an unknown name (well lets just say not a brand that
comes to mind as easily as dell and I think they might just be Currys and PC
Worlds own brand) and they are the same price if not dear than a Dell
equivalent PC.

I am not saying the PC World and Currys own brand ones are crap but me
personally I would rather go for Dell in that situation. The only downside
is having to wait for Dell to deliver the PC to your door in normal
circumstances that could be 4 or more working days later for home users.
There would be people who would simply not want to wait for one to be
delivered and would much rather want to nip into town and pick up a desktop
or notebook PC and sling it in the back of the car and away they go - this
is where Dell must be losing some sales but because you buy direct
(normally) from Dell you have to wait for the stuff to be delivered.

If they could somehow divert a little and start selling some standard entry
level Dell PC's in the likes of PC World Currys Dixons stores they would do
much better I reckon, however then I suppose that would bump their prices up
and I suppose you get the Dell's cheap because you buy direct from them.

Look on the web for,
How does Dell handle their business system computers for commercial
applications?

I haven't checked any of those sites yet, (it doesn't matter to me
anyway.I don't own a business and I am not a business cat) but y'all can
look at them.

I checked a computer newsgroup in America.(there are thousands of them)
Joan, in Tennessee, said they use Dell computers at work.She said about
three years ago right after the two years warranty expired, the hard
drive in 125 of them died.She said evidently Dell replaced those faulty
drives or we would not be getting pallets loads of them almost weekly.

I have already made up my mind of exactly which brand name of computer I
will buy, when I get ready to buy one, that is.A Velocity Micro big
desktop computer.I have no use for a laptop computer, I never go
anywhere where I would want to use a laptop and I don't tote.I would
probally fumble around and drop it on my hardwood floor and break it
anyway. www.velocitymicro.com

Keyboard and mouse will be Gyration mini keyboard and Gyration
rechargable mouse. www.gyration.com

None of that sissy kid stuff (Dell, HP,Gateway, ad hoc) for me!

I don't know what Hard Disk Drives the US DELL PC's were shipped with but in
Europe it was mainly Maxtor (not known for certain) and a lot of them failed
and I have had to change a lot of them. Of course DELL did not make the
HDD's that crashed so they cannot be at fault about that but I do know that
when it happened to some people they said &quot;right that's it I am never going
to buy another DELL PC again because it keeps crashing and then breaks
down - so I am going to buy a different a different brand PC next time!&quot;  -
but its not Dell's fault because the disks had problems that was enough to
put people of buying Dell again.

Apart from anything else I don't know what its like in other parts of the
world but a lot of people in Ireland (well where I am ) don't treat their
PC's with enough respect. They will have them sitting on floors, they will
have them on wobbly tables that wobbles when the PC is turned on, have them
in damp rooms, let dust and fluff accumulate all over the air vents/holes of
the case, empty out ashes at an open fire nearby them, put them in kitchens
with all that cooking and humidity, turn them on and off quickly, don't shut
down windows properly, let pets climb all over them and even let them sleep
on them!!, put cups of coffee on top of them, kick them, let 2 year olds
play with them and put coins into the CD ROM Drive! --- and then after
treating them like this go &quot;I don't know what's wrong with it, its always
give us trouble that PC since we have had it!!&quot;  :-)

well admittedly some coffee cups fit almost perfectly into the CD ROM drive
tray so you can be forgiven for that. Floppy disk drives and digital camera
card readers take a wafer thin after eight mints perfectly as well :-)

yeah, dirty ol' buggers aren't they  :-)

My mother in law used to (and still does I reckon) wipe her mouth on the
wiping up towel then wipes the dishes later - (and most probable mops the
floor with it as well!) - every now and again it might get put into the
wash!

Irish definition of cleaning the toilet - pour some toilet duck down it -
definition of cleaning the bath ....... have another bath in it.

mop the floor - I have seen people use the same cloth they wipe the worktops
down with! - trouble is if that was me living in that environment I would be
dead of germs within a week and these ones living in grime hardly get
anything wrong with them!!

one farmer I knew once used to bring the sheep through the front of the
house and let them go out the back door so as not to go out and get wet! -
only in Ireland!

(sorry in advance if I have offended anyone on here who wipe their mouth on
the tea towel, or mop their floors with the worktop rag or bring their farm
animals into the house)

Well as long as you use a strong bleach and scrub it should be ok!

could very much believe that. I smell some 'ripe' people sometimes in the
centra and supervalu markets sometimes! (all together now: Centra, for the
way we smell today..) and they pick up the apples and fruit and then put
them down again. - there was one bloke the other day (not that old) who was
so black with grime the only thing whit/pinkish on him was his tongue! :-)

A fella used to go through ballymote down here wearing woman's dresses and
women's pinafores and wellies in the shops I don't think he was a tranny or
anything although I didn't make his acquaintance to find out! :-)

I still cannot get over these young teenage girls over here smelling of
sweat and BO so much and not wearing deodorant.

(sorry to diverse from the original thread by the way about 2 week wait on
Dell laptops - if this was Boards.ie I would be banned for going off
topic!!)

Years ago, I read an article online at Computer Shoppa, Bliss' No Right
Clicking.The article explained that there are two different qualities of
the silicon wafers/chips that are used in the manufacture of
computers.There are Retail parts.(best quality) And there are OEM
parts.(low quality) The best computers use Retail quality parts.The
second best computers (mainstream computers) use the second best
parts.When silicon parts are manufactured, those are the two different
qualities of the silicon wafers/chips.Back in the 1950s, Ford Motor
Company used to have some great big posters of Jiggs (on the web, Jiggs
and Maggie Comic Strips) (I used to read Jiggs and Maggie comic strips
in the local newspaper back in the 1940s and 1950s) on the walls and
hanging from the ceilings in their factories.The Jiggs great big Jiggs
cartoon posters had a cartoon picture of Jiggs and the posters said,
SURE!, AND QUALITY COUNTS!

I believe Velocity Micro computers are top quality computers and that is
why I will buy one someday.I could buy one right now if I want to, but
WebTV does most everything I want as far as reading online newspapers,
science and technology and Military sites and accesing newsgroups and
emailing.WebTV does not have a hard drive so no viruses, etc.For the
time being, WebTV is A OK with me.

I always wondered what happened to that 80's pop singer Howard Jones  - so
that's where he has ended up making computers in yankeeland.

On the web,
Howard Industries: Growing on customer service

Howard Industries was founded by Billy Howard in a World War Two era
Army Barracks in 1968.(Camp Shelby, I am thinking) Some of those big
Howard Industries commercial and industrial electrical transformers and
switches (electrical transmission and distribution equipment) are over
there in Ireland.Howard Indistries ships around the World.

I usually buy my fruits and vegetables at a local fruit/vegetable
stand.Organically home grown, much better than that stuff that is sold
in the regular food stores over here.

my beef about Organically grown veg is that it costs dearer, goes off
quicker and my body misses the chemicals and pesticide sprays and I get
withdrawal symptoms! :-)

The tomatos in the food stores over here don't even taste like real
tomatos, they are hard too.Dang messed up cross bred genetically
modified crap is what they are and most of them are from Mexico, same as
a lot of other vegetables and fruits.If I had a green thumb I would grow
my own garden in my back yard next spring.My dad used to have a big
garden and the old home place in another town we lived in back in the
1940s, we had a big garden and one milk cow and some chickens and the
usual dogs and cats.I used to have two seventy feet tall pecan trees in
my yard, one in my front yard and the other one in my back yards.The
winds and rain from hurricane Katrina lossened up the tree roots and the
trees were leaning to much toward my house.In June of 2006 I had the
trees cut down and hauled away.
