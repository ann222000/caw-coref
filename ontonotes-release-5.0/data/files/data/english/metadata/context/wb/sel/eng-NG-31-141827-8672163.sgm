The Borderlands
Dead End
As the bitter debate over illegal immigration to the United States
rages, the first of many planned barriers, a 295-mile-long wall, is
being built through a remote desert corridor along the U.S.-Mexico
border. This spells trouble, not just for people but for the jaguar,
the Sonoran pronghorn, the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, and other
imperiled animals that are already struggling to survive.
By Michelle Nijuis

In the long yellow light of an Arizona afternoon, a young wildlife
biologist named Emil McCain walks down a dry creek bed, eyes fixed on
the dirt. &quot;Sometimes I'll run smack into a tree branch,&quot; he laughs.
&quot;I'm always watching the ground.&quot; This creek, tucked into rugged
mountains about 50 miles south of Tucson, lies a few miles shy of the
U.S.-Mexico border and a rough, dusty drive from pavement. But for
McCain, this remote spot is familiar territory. He has spent much of
the past three years here, braving heat, isolation, and blisters, all
in hopes of spotting signs of jaguars.

His quest has paid off-not once but dozens of times. McCain works for
the Borderlands Jaguar Detection Project, a tiny nonprofit group that
monitors motion-sensitive cameras throughout these mountains. Since
2001 the cameras have collected more than 80 photos of at least two
male jaguars, one of which has a range of about 525 square miles, an
area larger than Grand Teton National Park. McCain, who taught himself
to track animals during his childhood in rural southern Colorado,
spends his walk in the creek bed scanning for tracks, scat, and
possible jaguar &quot;scrapes&quot;-gashes in the dirt made to mark territory.

Although dozens of jaguars were trapped or shot in the Southwest in
the early and mid-1900s, the species was thought to have disappeared
from southern Arizona and New Mexico, largely from hunting and habitat
loss. But in March 1996 a rancher named Warner Glenn followed his
hunting dogs into the wilderness along the Arizona-New Mexico border,
and found himself staring at the unmistakable black spots of a jaguar-
a hefty, full-grown male. Glenn raised a camera instead of a rifle,
and returned home with the first known photograph of a live jaguar
north of the border.

Six months later, in another mountain range, hunter Jack Childs and
his wife, Anna Mary, also followed their dogs to within 30 feet of a
jaguar. &quot;It was beyond words,&quot; says Childs, still stunned by the
experience more than a decade later. Unable to forget the jaguar he
saw, Jack Childs launched the Borderlands Jaguar Detection Project.

Why, and for exactly how long, these jaguars have dwelled in the
Southwest is something of a mystery. What is clear is that the jaguars
seen in Arizona hold little regard for political boundaries.

The remote, unforgiving, staggeringly diverse country that straddles
the border between Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora is one of
the most politicized landscapes in the world, a place long caught up
in the ferocious international debate over immigration. Solid fences
and other barriers are now expanding along the entire southwestern
border, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has committed to
building 295 miles of new border fencing by the end of 2008. Largely
forgotten in these plans, however, are the jaguar, the chronically
endangered Sonoran pronghorn-now making a tenuous U.S. recovery in
southwestern Arizona-and scores of lesser-known creatures. While
barricades reach into the wild country of southern Arizona and beyond,
these species await the consequences.

&quot;If the wall goes up, it will be a complete and absolute barrier for
terrestrial wildlife,&quot; says Christine Hass, assistant director of the
Audubon Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch, in Elgin, Arizona, and a
wildlife ecologist who has studied carnivores in the region for more
than a decade. &quot;It has the potential to have more impact here than
anything we've ever seen.&quot;

The Arizona-Sonora border is often imagined as a stretch of naked
desert, punctuated only by a couple of forlorn cacti. While the
western part of the state certainly fits the desert stereotype, in
southeastern Arizona and northeastern Sonora, where jaguars roam,
mountains rise from the desert floor into shady evergreen islands of
spruce and fir. Here, in the so-called Sky Islands, the tropics nudge
into the Southwest, and Canada extends a cool finger into Sonora,
creating a biological melting pot that includes not only black bears
and mountain lions but also troops of coatis-a tropical relative of
the raccoon-and flashy birds, including trogons and parrots. In these
mountains, hikers on the lookout for rattlesnakes might instead
encounter a vine snake, a pencil-thin tropical species that can grow
to five feet.

For years Arizona's remote deserts and forests were quiet places,
frequented primarily by hikers, hunters, and a trickle of border
crossers. That changed in the mid-1990s, when the U.S. Border Patrol
started cracking down on illegal crossings in border cities. The
mountains and deserts, policy makers thought, were barriers unto
themselves, forbidding enough to scare off would-be border crossers.

They were wrong. Between 1993 and 1996, while apprehensions of illegal
crossers declined in San Diego and El Paso, overall apprehensions
increased, and those in Arizona nearly tripled. The Arizona border,
the most heavily traveled in the Southwest, tallied 303,800
apprehensions-44 percent of the total-between October 1, 2006, and
June 30, 2007.

More and more crossers began attempting the brutally hot and dry
federal lands in southwestern Arizona, often with fatal results.
Migrant deaths along the border shot up in the mid-1990s, and despite
rescue efforts by the Border Patrol and humanitarian groups, dozens of
people continue to die of dehydration and exposure each summer. Land
managers in border refuges and parks routinely find signs of desperate
passage: infant diapers, a roll of family pictures from Mexico, a
backpack discarded in a final, frantic moment.

Drug smugglers also brought weapons and rivalries to the desert, and
violent deaths became part of the landscape. Illegal immigrants have
been caught in the crossfire, and in the summer of 2002 a National
Park Service law-enforcement ranger named Kris Eggle was killed while
helping the Border Patrol catch two men suspected in a string of drug-
related murders. In early 2007 drug smuggling activity in Organ Pipe
Cactus National Monument had gotten so bad that park officials
effectively closed the park's backcountry to visitors until further
notice.

The toll on habitat mounted, too. Vans, trucks, and cars stuffed with
dozens of border crossers streamed through untracked desert, only to
be abandoned when they broke down or encountered impassable terrain.
Border Patrol enforcement and rescue operations sliced into wilderness
areas, compounding the damage. Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge,
which encompasses a wilderness area larger than Rhode Island, now has
between 400 and 500 miles of entrenched illegal roads, some 150 feet
wide, with secondary impacts to match. &quot;We measure trash in the tons,&quot;
says refuge manager Roger Di Rosa.

The refuge, about 100 miles southwest of Phoenix as the raven flies,
is key habitat for the Sonoran pronghorn, which was endangered even
before there was an Endangered Species Act. (It was protected in 1967
under a precursor to the modern act.) Built like a small deer,
pronghorn have bulging eyes, delicate muzzles, and the fleetest feet
of any land mammal in North America, capable of 60-mile-an-hour
sprints. The Sonoran subspecies of pronghorn may have once numbered in
the thousands, but during the past century highways and fences
crisscrossed its habitat and hunting hastened its decline, restricting
it to small populations in Arizona and Sonora. The boom in border
traffic not only tore into pronghorn habitat but also stretched the
time and resources of many land managers. Between 2001 and 2002,
during a prolonged dry spell, the Sonoran pronghorn population in
Arizona plummeted from 150 animals to an estimated 21.

Illegal immigration is, of course, the subject of fierce controversy,
and proposed solutions-including the immigration bill that died in the
U.S. Senate this past summer-usually create more conflict than they
resolve. But on Arizona's southern border, among those who deal with
the situation's realities, there are glimmers of agreement.

Most say that vehicle barriers-sturdy, chest-high steel pipes placed
about four feet apart-are needed in many places to slow the flow of
motorized traffic across the deserts, protecting both human life and
wildlife habitat while allowing people and animals to move across the
border. &quot;Everyone wanted vehicle barriers,&quot; says Di Rosa.

Various types of vehicle barriers now stretch for more than 70 miles
along the Arizona border, across the southern edges of Organ Pipe
Cactus National Monument, Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge,
Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, and other federal and tribal
lands. By the end of next year the Department of Homeland Security
expects to have installed more than 240 miles of barriers along the
Arizona border.

&quot;We're not going to call vehicle barriers a solution-the real solution
is comprehensive immigration reform-but we support the land managers
who need them,&quot; says Jenny Neeley, a longtime environmental advocate
who until recently was the Southwest representative with Defenders of
Wildlife in Tucson.

What few land managers and other professionals on the Arizona border
say they want, however, is a fence-more precisely, a &quot;pedestrian
fence,&quot; a more or less solid wall designed to keep out not only cars
and trucks but also people on foot. The Border Patrol has long used
fences in urban areas, where crossers can almost instantly disappear
into city crowds, and the few minutes of delay afforded by a fence can
make the difference between capture and escape. But in remote places,
the pace of the chase slows, since crossers must walk for hours-
sometimes days-before reaching a highway or city.

&quot;There's no reason to plunk down a fence in areas that have no
strategic advantage,&quot; says Dion Ethell, public lands liaison for the
Tucson sector of the Border Patrol.

Yet a border fence is exactly what Congress approved in 2006. In late
October President George W. Bush signed the Secure Fence Act, which
called for more than 700 miles of double-layer fence along the
southwestern border, including the nearly 400-mile stretch between
Calexico, California, and Douglas, Arizona.

Many Democrats dismissed the bill as election-year politicking. &quot;You
show me a 50-foot wall, and I'll show you a 51-foot ladder,&quot; scoffed
Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano after the bill was passed. Though
the fence itself has received no specific funding, the Department of
Homeland Security has promised to build 295 miles of new border
fencing by the end of next year, including more than 130 miles in
Arizona. The construction is part of a suite of projects that also
includes high-tech &quot;virtual&quot; fencing and a steep increase in the
number of Border Patrol agents.

In far-western Arizona fence construction is already under way. In the
summer of 2006 the Border Patrol was completing its environmental
analysis of vehicle barriers for the 37-mile-long southernmost border
of the Barry M. Goldwater Range. The plan, supported by the U.S.
Marine Corps (which is responsible for the western part of the
Goldwater Range) and other border agencies, was part of a coordinated
effort to install vehicle barriers along both the Goldwater Range and
the adjoining Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge.

But in Washington, D.C., other proposals were afoot. Representative
Duncan Hunter (R-CA), a cosponsor of the Secure Fence Act and then
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called for the
construction of a pedestrian fence along the Goldwater Range, citing
disruptions to military training activities. &quot;A complete fencing
solution is called for-partial or virtual fences won't work,&quot; he
stated last September, shortly before announcing his intention to run
for the Republican presidential nomination.

By late summer of 2006 the Department of Homeland Security was
informing federal agency officials in Arizona that the planned vehicle
barriers would be expanded into a fence. This past January Homeland
Security Secretary Michael Chertoff waived the federal laws requiring
environmental review of the project-a move permitted under the 2005
REAL ID Act, which granted him broad authority to waive laws when
doing so was deemed necessary to &quot;ensure expeditious construction&quot; of
border barriers and roads.

&quot;We never asked for a fence, and we still haven't asked for a fence,&quot;
says Ron Pearce, range manager for the Marine Corps' section of the
Goldwater Range. Illegal border traffic through the range has hampered
military operations, he says, but the situation has improved thanks to
some far more basic measures, such as the establishment of radio
communication between Border Patrol and military personnel. &quot;The fence
doesn't make any difference to our operations,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't
think it does any damage, but I don't think it'll do much good, and I
hate to see money wasted.&quot;

On the southernmost border of the Goldwater Range, the ongoing fence
construction has been funded by a border-wide program called the
Secure Border Initiative. The 15-foot-high fence sections, single
panels of heavy-duty steel mesh, are attached to posts with thick
metal bands. This fence-the Department of Homeland Security calls it a
&quot;hybrid fence&quot;-is currently slated to extend along the international
border almost all the way to the western edge of Cabeza Prieta
National Wildlife Refuge. It's clearly impassable for any large, four-
footed mammal, but the lower edge of the fence is periodically
perforated with ladderlike trios of small slits, designed to allow the
flat-tailed horned lizard-a species long proposed for federal
protection-to climb through without a passport. Visible through the
mesh, just a few hundred yards away, is Mexico Highway 2 and its
procession of buses and tractor trailers.

The fence now extends for less than a mile toward the eastern horizon,
and the vehicle barriers continue past it for an additional seven
miles or so. Beyond that, soon to be divided, is open desert, where
nothing but blowing sand marks the border.

Where will the fence go next? The Department of Homeland Security
recently proposed building a pedestrian fence along most of the
southern border of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, about an
hour's drive southwest of Tucson. The waiver signed by Secretary
Chertoff last January exempts the Goldwater project from a panoply of
laws, including the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration
Act, hinting that the adjoining Cabeza Prieta refuge may be next in
line. &quot;I didn't wake up with Stupid tattooed anywhere on my body,&quot;
says refuge manager Roger Di Rosa. &quot;So, yes, I think it could happen
on the refuge.&quot;

The Sonoran pronghorn populations in Arizona and Mexico have long been
separated by Mexico Highway 2, so a fence on the southern border of
the refuge wouldn't further restrict these already isolated herds.
It's the fence next door, in the Goldwater Range, that's most likely
to complicate things; by pushing border traffic eastward into Cabeza
Prieta, it could disrupt the pronghorn's recent and modest recovery in
Arizona.

In 2002, when the state's pronghorn population &quot;was nearing
extinction,&quot; says Curt McCasland, assistant refuge manager, agencies
hastily organized a captive breeding program to coax it off the
critical list. Does now nurse their fawns in a one-square-mile fenced
area on the refuge, where an irrigation system ensures some vegetation
is plump and green, and four young adult males have been successfully
released into the wild. The Arizona population stands at an estimated
68, and wildlife managers, in optimistic moments, talk about
establishing a second population in the state.

Farther east along the Arizona border, toward the Sky Islands, new
sections of fence would pose other problems. &quot;The biggest impacts
would be on animals that have core areas in Mexico,&quot; says ecologist
Christine Hass of Audubon's Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch. Solid
fencing in southeastern Arizona, she says, would fragment habitat not
only for large mammals such as the jaguar but also for the coati, two
species of skunks, and the tiny Coues deer, a subspecies of white-
tailed deer, called &quot;the gray ghost&quot; for its ability to seemingly
vanish into the landscape. Because populations divided by the fence
would have smaller pools of prospective mates, their genetic diversity-
and, with it, their ability to withstand disease, environmental
stresses, and other challenges-is likely to erode. &quot;These species may
have viable populations north of the border, but they'd certainly be
better off with gene flow from the south,&quot; says Hass.

Even wings may not deliver animals from their predicament. &quot;People
think birds are going to tear off and fly anywhere they want, but
that's not the case for specialists like the pygmy owl,&quot; says Aaron
Flesch, a researcher at the University of Arizona who studies owls in
northern Sonora. He has found that the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl-
extremely rare in southern Arizona and declining in Sonora-rarely
flies more than 12 feet off the ground and avoids open areas. For the
pygmy owl, and other highly restricted birds such as the Gould's
turkey, a border fence may be impassable.

Jaguar biologist Emil McCain has no doubt what the fence would mean in
Arizona for the jaguar, listed on the federal endangered species rolls
for a decade. &quot;It would be totally catastrophic,&quot; he says, pointing
out that the Sky Islands of southeastern Arizona are the northernmost
reach of Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental Range. &quot;It's probably the
finest example of habitat fragmentation you can think of. If we slice
off this end of the range, big carnivores would suffer most, but
nothing would do well on this side of the line.&quot; The fence, say
conservationists, would also end dreams of reintroducing the species
in southern Arizona.

What the fence would mean for the core population of jaguars in Sonora
is not so clear. Biologist Alan Rabinowitz of the Wildlife
Conservation Society, a longtime champion of jaguar protection, argues
that despite years of looking, biologists have solid evidence for only
one resident jaguar-nicknamed Macho B-north of the border. (The other
frequently photographed jaguar, Macho A, has not been caught on camera
since 2004, and the other jaguars sighted during the past decade are
assumed by many to be wandering bachelors, making brief forays north
of the border.) While the fence would isolate Macho B from potential
mates and prey south of the border, he says, that's unlikely to have
much impact on the Sonora population, already struggling to survive in
a harsh, dry habitat with scarce prey.

McCain and his colleagues aren't about to give up, saying that they've
only begun to explore the remote reaches of the borderlands. Sergio
Avila, a biologist with the nonprofit Sky Island Alliance in Tucson,
recently set up a dozen motion-sensitive cameras just south of the
border (see &quot;To the Future of the Jaguar and the Ocelot,&quot; page 69),
hoping to document jaguar movements in the little-studied ranchlands
of far-northern Sonora.

The public forest north of the border serves as a refuge, McCain
believes, as evidenced by the sporadic but continuing jaguar sightings
in Arizona. Last year rancher Warner Glenn, who made the initial
jaguar sighting in 1996, spotted a second jaguar, this one across the
state line in New Mexico, this one loping south toward the Mexican
border. &quot;It doesn't matter that there are more animals in Mexico,&quot;
says McCain. &quot;Mexico also has overgrazing and poaching of the jaguars
themselves. This is a refuge here.&quot;

McCain continues to live amid his cameras, in a breezy, ramshackle
ranch house just four miles north of the border. As canyon wrens whisk
up and down the chimney, he fires up his computer to show a grainy
black-and-white video. The clip, collected from one of his cameras,
reveals a jaguar lifting his tail and spraying to mark his territory.

&quot;That shows that he's talking to somebody,&quot; McCain says, musing over
the few seconds of movement on the screen. &quot;He's saying, 'I'm here,'
which could be to drive away another male. Or it could be to attract a
female.&quot;
Whether a female-and thus a potential resident breeding pair-lives
north of the Arizona-Sonora line is one of the borderlands' most
elusive mysteries, and McCain can only hope that fences won't
interrupt his search. &quot;I'm sure there's a female. I'm positive,&quot; he
says. &quot;I set out every day thinking, 'Where am I going to find her?'
But for all I know, she could be right across the border.&quot;

&quot;To the Future of the Jaguar and Ocelot&quot;

While fencing projects rumble forward, the borderlands continue to
reveal new wonders. Just a few dozen miles south of the Arizona
border, in the Mexican Sky Islands, Sergio Avila is exploring little-
known territory.

A biologist with the Sky Islands Alliance, a nonprofit group based in
Tucson, Avila studies the area between the northernmost known breeding
population of jaguars-the animals in and around the Los Pavos Ranch, a
10,000-acre reserve about 130 miles south of the border-and the
jaguars sighted over the past decade in southern Arizona.

&quot;We wanted to find out what was going on down here,&quot; says Avila, a
native of central Mexico. &quot;We're not only doing jaguar work but also
getting to know people, and letting them get to know us.&quot;

Unlike the northern end of the Sky Islands region, which is largely
public forest, much of the Sonoran part is private ranchland. So Avila
has put his fluent Spanish and easy grin to work, gradually building
relationships with ranchers.

When Carlos Robles allowed Avila to set up cameras on his ranch last
spring, the results came quickly. The first rolls of film Avila
developed held an image of a slender feline figure, about the size of
a cocker spaniel, captured mid-stride in a sunny valley. It was not a
jaguar but an ocelot. There are two small breeding populations of
ocelots in far southeastern Texas-fewer than 100 individuals in all-
and the species is well documented in more tropical areas south of the
border. But ocelots are only rumored to persist in Arizona, and are
thought to be very rare in the deserts of far-northern Sonora.

On a recent evening, Robles and Avila and several of Avila's
colleagues sat in the Robles ranch kitchen, talking amiably but
cautiously about the ocelot, the borderlands, and the future of their
work together. Robles was raised on this ranch, and has lived and
worked here all his life, carrying on a tradition his family began in
1934. &quot;I grew up with the sound of cattle around me,&quot; says Robles,
whose ranch now hosts birdwatchers and hunters as well as cows. While
most of his neighbors, he adds, still consider it a badge of honor to
shoot a wild cat, he feels differently. Robles gives a heartfelt
speech about his desire to protect his land for future generations
-&quot;The river needs children to bathe in it,&quot; he says in Spanish-and
vows to support Avila as he searches the still-unknown reaches of the
Sky Islands for jaguars.

&quot;I just want to hug everyone,&quot; jokes Avila, laughing. &quot;I've been
waiting years to have a conversation like this.&quot; Robles pulls out a
bottle of tequila, pours shots for his new companions, and raises his
own glass: &quot;Al futuro del jaguar y el ocelote&quot; (&quot;To the future of the
jaguar and the ocelot&quot;). Robles and Avila grin at each other, drain
their glasses, and head outside for a look at the Sonoran stars.-M.N.
