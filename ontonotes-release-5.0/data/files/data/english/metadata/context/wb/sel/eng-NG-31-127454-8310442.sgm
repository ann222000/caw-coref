It is obvious from the Epilogue that Harry married Ginny and they had
three children (James, Lily &amp; Albus Severus), &amp; that Ron &amp; Hermione
got married and had two children (Hugo &amp; Rose).

- Who did Draco marry?  Pansy Parkinson?

- Who the hell picked &quot;Scorpius&quot; as the kid's name - Draco or his
wife?

- Did Hagrid and Mme. Maxime end up together?

- Did Harry &amp; crew go back to Hogwarts and finish up their schooling?

- Who got the job to re-build Hogwarts (and is there a magical mafia
in the construction business?)

- What career paths (if any) did the characters follow?

- Who are the teachers at Hogwarts now (besides Neville, obviously)

- What happened to Kreacher?  Is he still serving Harry's family or is
his head on the wall and his offspring have taken over?

- If house elves have offspring, did they give one to Arthur &amp; Molly?

- Did they let Grawp breed?

- Did the centaurs accept Firenze back into the herd?

- Did Viktor Krum eventually get laid because of his status as an
International Quidditch Player?

- Did anyone zap Rita Skeeter with &quot;Raid&quot; (bug killer spray) like they
should have?

- Did the giant squid end up as calamari at one of the feasts?

Draco, it is in the same star name tradition of the Black family as
his own name.

Don't think so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Who the hell picked &quot;Scorpius&quot; as the kid's name - Draco or his
&gt; wife?
">

No mother would give such a name to her son. As usual the Malfoy women have
no voice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Did Hagrid and Mme. Maxime end up together?
">

Not likely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Did Harry &amp; crew go back to Hogwarts and finish up their schooling?
">

Unlikely, but Hermione may have insisted that they do so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Who got the job to re-build Hogwarts (and is there a magical mafia
&gt; in the construction business?)
">

Presumably the staff and the ministry would've repaired the damages. Rebuild
is the wrong word, as the damages were major, but nowhere near total.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - What career paths (if any) did the characters follow?
">

No information except for Neville. Harry wouldn't have become an Auror,
because he clearly states at the end of the last chapter that he's had
enough trouble for a lifetime, and also he wouldn't want to risk the Elder
wand being passed on to someone else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Who are the teachers at Hogwarts now (besides Neville, obviously)
">

No teacher, except for Charity Burbage and Snape died. So, presumably, more
or less the same staff are teaching there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - What happened to Kreacher?  Is he still serving Harry's family or is
&gt; his head on the wall and his offspring have taken over?
">

He's the Black family Elf. Sirius made Harry inherit the House of Blacks. So
presumably Kreacher served out his remaining years under Harry. Rowling
showed how he came to accept Harry and his friends.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - If house elves have offspring, did they give one to Arthur &amp; Molly?
">

Harry would never enslave an Elf like that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Did they let Grawp breed?
">

Ask Hagrid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Did the centaurs accept Firenze back into the herd?
">

Probably not. They are extraordinarily dogmatic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Did Viktor Krum eventually get laid because of his status as an
&gt; International Quidditch Player?
">

Who cares.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - Did anyone zap Rita Skeeter with &quot;Raid&quot; (bug killer spray) like they
&gt; should have?

Hopefully someone did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You should rather be asking about the fate of all those pitiful inferi.

this is the one I wanted answered in the Epilogue. I always imagined
that Harry would become an Auror, and Hermione would onew day be
Headmistress (probably Charms professor until then). Since I really
could not see a future for Ron I half expected him to get killed.

It was obvious (when Ron lived) that he would marry Hermione and Harry
would marry Jenny, but I also would like to know what happened to some
of the others. I assume Luna took over the Quibbler, but did George
continue the Joke Shop after Fred's death?

And one burning question: What eh Hell became of Umbridge??!!?? I
really wanted to see her come to a grizzly end.

Almost the last thing the book says of Harry at Hogwarts is that he
was &quot;thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in
Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a
sandwich there&quot; (p.749). It is not explicit, but the implication is
that he is returning to his permanent accomodations at school, and
that he is returning to become a student again.

I imagine he would want to return to school, especially as what he
wants now is a simple uncomplicated life free of adventure. No doubt
the surrogate Weasley parents would encourage that as well.

Has anyone worked out the chronology? How much of the school year is
shot at this point?

It was pretty much at the end of the year by the time of the final battle.
And I doubt they could've had lessons since part of the scholl had been

Based on the fact that Harry notices it's May just before they leave
to raid Gringotts, I'd say it would be coming up close to exam time.

It's only been nineteen years.  McGonagall taught there for 41 years (as
of the seventh book), and Dumbledore was there for over 50.  Every
teacher who didn't assume room temperature in the fight probably stayed

Tonks catches pregnant somewhere in the vicinity of the wedding, which is

That's April. Harry spends a fair bit of time planning the Gringott's heist

Barbarossa:

'Scorpius' is a constellation, as is 'Draco' and 'Andromeda'.
In the Greek it is spelled 'Skorpion,' in Latin 'Scorpius,' and
in modern parlance 'Scorpio.'

'Regulus,' 'Arcturus,' 'Sirius,' and 'Bellatrix' are first
magnitude stars.

The name of the variable star Algol in the constellation
'Perseus' comes frome the Arabic 'al-ghul' meaning &quot;demon star.&quot;

-- I await the appearance of Algol Malfoy and, perhaps, his rival
Perseus Tonks.

Very good. There can't be any idea of Harry graduating with his class.
So we don't really know anything about his later schooling. The
suggestion there is a bed with his name on it in Gryffindor Tower must
simply signify that Hogwarts is still his home. What that means about
his education we don't know. In a real college he would drop down a
year; presumably, that's what happens here too.

Ahh, haven¹t been paying attention in Astronomy class, I see.
The Andromeda galaxy, one of the closest such, is so named
because it is found in the constellation of Andromeda - as the
Orion nebula is found in the constellation of Orion.

Actually, it is both :). There is the constellation Andromeda and the

Narcissa is one who breaks the mold since her name is (cruelly)

What an odd thing to say.  Narcissa was clearly the head of the Malfoy
family in the final book. Both Lucius and Draco looked to her for
their decisions, on multiple occasions.  And, the tendendency to name
folks after stars came from the *black* family (ie, the women).
Sirius, Draco, Bellatrix, Andromeda, and probably Narcissa are all
stars.  So yeah, Draco probably followed the tradition, but the
tradition came from his mother's family, not his father's.

Yes, technically speaking, the Trio are not fully qualified. I don't
think Harry or Ron care much about that, but not having taken the
final exams will bug Hermione and she would like to go back to
Hogwarts to formally complete her education. Ron will come along
as otherwise he will be separated from her for a good part of the
year. Same thing with Harry and Ginny. Ha, Ron can still achieve what
he once saw in the Mirror of Erised: A head boy (that's for sure if he
goes back to school), the Quiddich Cup holder and the fame of the best
Gryffindor goalkeeper in a hundred of years or something. Somehow
I doubt Harry will want to play Quiddich again - he will be happy to
support Ginny as a Seeker instead.

Now, can you imagine Harry taking his final exam in DADA? It is
an O+ for a start. Shame the Prince's book with all the recipes for
Potions is lost, though.

I can see some good fan fiction ideas here. But fan fiction writers,
beware! Harry must not duel anybody, not even Draco Malfoy, again,
as he cannot risk loosing the ownership of the Elder Wand. Remember,
he must die undefeated.
