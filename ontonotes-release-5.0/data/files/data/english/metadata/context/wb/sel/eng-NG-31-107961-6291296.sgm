Hi,
I'm new to the group, and to paddling, and was wondering if anyone on
this list is located near Northwest Georgia. My wife and I are looking
for people to paddle with and learn from.
Thanks'

Google up "Georgia Canoeing Association" and "Carolina Canoe Club".

Both are primarily whitewater clubs, but both have flatwater
contingents.  For ~$25 each, it is worth joining each.

And in that part of the world, Tennessee Valley Canoe Club
&lt; http://www.tvccpaddles.com/ &gt; in Chattanooga would also be a good bet.
