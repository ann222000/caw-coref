“How Eisenhower solved illegal border crossings from Mexico”

By John Dillin
http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0706/p09s01-coop.html

Excerpt:

“General Eisenhower ... quoted a report in The New York Times,
highlighting one paragraph that said: ‘The rise in illegal border-crossing
by Mexican 'wetbacks' to a current rate of more than
1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation
in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters
of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal
Government ...&quot;
“Herbert Brownell Jr., Eisenhower's first attorney general, said the
president had a sense of urgency about illegal immigration when he took
office.
“America ‘was faced with a breakdown in law enforcement on a very large
scale,’ Mr. Brownell said. ‘When I say large scale, I mean hundreds of
thousands were coming in from Mexico [every year] without restraint.’&quot;
--------------------------------------------------

&quot;Unfortunately, the majority of illegal aliens who are here are engaged
in criminal activity. Identity theft, use of fraudulent Social Security
numbers and green cards, tax evasion, driving without licenses represent
some of the crimes that are engaged in by the majority of illegal aliens on
a daily basis merely to maintain and hide their illegal status. In
addition, violent crime and drug distribution and possession is also
prevalent among illegal aliens. Over 25% of today's federal prison
population are illegal aliens. In some areas of the country, 12% of
felonies, 25% of burglaries and 34% of thefts are committed by illegal
aliens.&quot;

-- Testimony of District Attorney John M. Morganelli before the House
Subcommittee on Immigration, Border, Security and Claims [Note: 99% of
warrants for murder in Los Angeles, California -- the USA's 2nd
most-populous city -- are for illegal aliens]

&quot;It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate,
tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of
men.&quot;
-- Samuel Adams

&quot;“All great truths begin as heresies.”

-- Former Democrat Governor of Colorado Richard Lamm, official of
Defend Colorado Now, a movement opposed to illegal immigration
and public services for illegal aliens

WHAT WOULD THE FOUNDING FATHERS DO? ...

If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is
then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of
self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government ... The
citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert,
without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair ...
The natural strength of the people in a large community, in
proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in
a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the
attempts of the government to establish a tyranny ... the people, without
exaggeration, may be said to be entirely the masters of their
own fate.

-- Alexander Hamilton

The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain
occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive.

-- Thomas Jefferson

The will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any
government, and to protect its free expression should be our first object.

-- Thomas Jefferson

We in America do not have government by the majority. We have government
by the majority who participate.

-- Thomas Jefferson

All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to
remain silent.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people
alone. The people themselves are its only safe depositories.

-- Thomas Jefferson

In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of
principle, stand like a rock.

-- Thomas Jefferson

No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

-- Thomas Jefferson

The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to
keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves
against tyranny in government.

-- Thomas Jefferson

As our enemies have found we can reason like men, so now let us show
them we can fight like men also.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Don't talk about what you have done or what you are going to do.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Every citizen should be a soldier. This was the case with the Greeks
and Romans, and must be that of every free state.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will
delineate and define you.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Merchants have no country. The mere spot they stand on does not
constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their
gains.

-- Thomas Jefferson

I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied
corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial
by strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country.

-- Thomas Jefferson

I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties
than standing armies.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Experience demands that man is the only animal which devours his own
kind, for I can apply no milder term to the general prey of the
rich on the poor.

-- Thomas Jefferson

Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government
those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations,
perverted it into tyranny.

-- Thomas Jefferson

I should have expected as much.... you spit in the face of the truth.

It's beyond me how you can still respect the greatest criminal ever
to serve in American office... the first president ever elected having
a criminal record... the very cause of at least half of the turmoil in
the world today... and the biggest, unpunished LIAR ever to serve.

... And he continues to serve by re-writing and avoiding American laws:

Sina: Is Political Islam Fascism?
Our good friend Ali Sina of Faith Freedom has sent us this article
about political Islam. It is a thought-provoking analysis from someone
who was born into Islam, raised in an Islamic society, and now, as an
ex-Muslim, works to enlighten both questioning Muslims and interested
non-Muslims as to the nature of Islam.

Also, there is an ongoing gnat infestation in my email box: a steady
stream of messages from people either insulting Ali Sina and demanding
I denounce him, or insulting me and saying that Ali ought to denounce
me. Ali pointed out in an earlier article that divide and conquer is a
tactic of war preached by the Prophet Muhammad. As a continuing
indication to the senders of those messages that their campaign is not
working, I am happy to put this up.

Islam is a religion with a very political agenda. The ultimate goal of
Islam is to rule the world. But what kind of government an Islamic
state would have?

It certainly won't be democratic. Islam is not compatible with
democracy. Amir Taheri, an Iranian born author/journalist in a debate
on Islam and democracy argued that in fact the word democracy does not
exist in any of the languages spoken by Muslims. &quot;To understand a
civilization,&quot; Taheri said, &quot;it is important to understand its
vocabulary. If it was not on their tongues it is likely that it was
not on their minds either.&quot;

Democracy implies equality. But equality is unacceptable in Islam. Un-
believers cannot be equal to believers and women are not equal to men.
Even the non-Muslims are not deemed to be equal. The People of the
Book (Jews and Christians) are accepted as second class citizens and
allowed to live in an Islamic state provided they pay the protection
tax; Jizyah. But the pagans, atheists and idolaters are not regarded
as fully humans. According to the Quran, the idolaters are to be
killed wherever they are found. (9:5)

In the April 9, 2002 issue, The Wall Street Journal published the
concept of blood money in Saudi Arabia. If a person has been killed or
caused to die by another, the latter has to pay blood money or
compensation, as follow.

100,000 riyals if the victim is a Muslim man
50,000 riyals if a Muslim woman
50,000 riyals if a Christian man
25,000 riyals if a Christian woman
6,666 riyals if a Hindu man
3,333 riyals if a Hindu woman

According to this hierarchy, a Muslim man's life is worth 33 times
that of a Hindu woman. This hierarchy is based on the Islamic
definition of human rights and is rooted in the Quran and Sharia
(Islamic law). How can we talk of democracy when the concept of
equality in Islam is inexistent?

Of course killing the idolaters &quot;where ye find them&quot; was not always
expedient. What would the Muslim rulers in India gain if they killed
all the Hindus? Over whom would they rule? So pragmatism often
prevailed and the Muslim rulers would exert some degree of tolerance
towards their pagan subjects. Furthermore, it is hard to find a Muslim
ruler as ruthless as Muhammad himself. Muslim rulers killed whenever
profit dictated and since live subjects were more profitable than dead
ones, the extermination was not total as was intended by Muhammad.
Nonetheless this tolerance was out of political expediency and not a
right of the pagan. Muhammad's butchery of his victims on the other
hand, was psychopathological. He would massacre entire populations
simply because they rejected him or hurt his humongous narcissistic
ego.
The Christians and the Jews, the so called People of the Book, had
some conditional rights. They had to pay Jizyah and buy their
protection. Nonetheless they lived in a state of religious apartheid
and were subject to humiliating treatments. For example, they were
considered najis (impure) and were not allowed to go out on rainy
days, lest their impurity may rub to a passing Muslim, make him
&quot;impure&quot; and annul his prayer. The Jews and Christians were required
to dismount from their donkey or horse if they met a Muslim in their
way and they were supposed to greet the Muslim humbly and show
submissiveness towards him. The Dhimmis were not allowed to build
their houses taller than those of their Muslim neighbors and in some
cases they were not allowed to build new churches and synagogues and
needed permission to repair the existing ones.

Taheri said: &quot;To say that Islam is incompatible with democracy should
not be seen as a disparagement of Islam. On the contrary, many Muslims
would see it as a compliment because they sincerely believe that their
idea of rule by God is superior to that of rule by men which is
democracy.&quot;

One Islamic site explains: &quot;In Western democracy, the people are
sovereign; in Islam sovereignty is vested in Allah and the people are
His caliphs or representatives. The laws given by Allah through His
Prophet (Shari 'ah) are to be regarded as constitutional principles
that should not be violated.&quot;

Taheri quoted several Muslim thinkers who expressed their disdain and
disapproval of democracy.

&quot;Ayatollah Khomeini called democracy &quot;a form of prostitution&quot; because
he who gets the most votes wins the power that belongs only to Allah.
Sayyed Qutb, the Egyptian who is credited to be the ideological mentor
of Safalists, spent a year in the United States in the 1950s and
wrote: &quot; America is a nation that has forgotten God and been forsaken
by Him; an arrogant nation that wants to rule itself.&quot;
Yussuf al-Ayyeri, one of the leading theoreticians of today's Islamist
movement, published a book ( available on the Internet) in which he
warned that the real danger to Islam did not come from American tanks
and helicopter gunships in Iraq but from the idea of democracy and
rule by the people.

Maudoodi, another of the Islamist theoreticians now fashionable,
dreamed of a political system in which human beings would act as
automatons in accordance with rules set by God.
He said that God has arranged man's biological functions in such a way
that their operation is beyond human control. For our non-biological
functions, notably our politics, God has set rules that we have to
discover and apply once and for all so that our societies can be on
auto-pilot so to speak.

The late Saudi theologian, Sheikh Muhammad bin Ibrahim al-Jubair, a
man I respected though seldom agreed with, sincerely believed that the
root cause of all of our contemporary ills was the spread of
democracy. &quot;Only one ambition is worthy of Islam,&quot; he liked to say,
&quot;the ambition to save the world from the curse of democracy: to teach
men that they cannot rule themselves on the basis of manmade laws.
Mankind has strayed from the path of God, we must return to that path
or face certain annihilation.&quot;&quot;

So what kind of government Islam is proposing?

Democracy means the rule of people. This is unacceptable in Islam. The
Quran is empathic that &quot;to Allah belong all Dominion and
power&quot; (2.165, 35:10, 35:13, 64:1). The words &quot;No judgment but
God's&quot; (la hukm illa li-llah) is based on several Quranic verses (esp.
6.57; 12.40, 67 etc.) This power is vested on His regent known as
Khalifat al-Allah.

The Khalifa cannot legislate. He can only interpret the Law given in
the Quran and the sunnah and apply it. Naturally, since the Quran is
not a clear book, this allows for a wide range of interpretations and
this explains why there are so many Islamic schools of thoughts and
sects. &quot;But the bottom line is&quot; says Taheri, &quot;that no Islamic
government can be democratic in the sense of allowing the common
people equal shares in legislation.&quot;

Common people are called awwam, and as the saying goes: al-awwam kal
anaam! (People are like animals).

It is up to the &quot;experts&quot; of the Law to interpret the Sharia and let
the awwam know how they should live their lives. This endows the
&quot;expert&quot; ruler, all the power and allows him to act as the deputy of
God on Earth. There can be no opposition to the ruler. You can't
oppose God by opposing his representative.

In democracies people's beliefs are irrelevant. They can belong to any
religion or no religion and still manage to govern themselves in a
secular state. This is not the case in monotheistic societies where
God is the lawgiver. Christians and Jews have managed to separate the
Church from the State. This evolution in Islam is not possible. The
concept of Church (with capital C) as understood in Christianity does
not exist in Islam. There is no authority like the Vatican or the
Church of England in Islam. The Mullahs and Imams are average Muslims
who through their knowledge of the Quran and Sharia gain reputation
among the ummah and their own peers. You can't separate the Islamic
&quot;Church&quot; from politics, because there is no such thing as the Islamic
&quot;Church&quot;. Every Mullah can interpret the Sharia in his own way. But he
can't redefine the explicit teachings of Islam.

Presently Muslims do not have a khalifa. But even if they had, the
khalifa would not have been able to deviate from the Quran and
announce the separate Islam from politics.

Islam's main goal is to give the dominion of this world to its
&quot;rightful&quot; owner, Allah. No authority on Earth can change that.
Impeding Islam to achieve this goal is denying its raison d' tre and
it is tantamount to blasphemy. Islam by definition is imperialistic.

It must advance, conquer and reclaim the dominion of all Earth or
there is no reason for it to exist.

Democracies are pluralistic. People have different faiths and are free
to criticize, not only each other's religions but also their own.
Islam does not tolerate that. Anyone who dares to criticize Islam
faces severe punishment including execution or assassination. Islam is
regarded as The Truth, the Only Truth and the Absolute Truth. Defying
this truth is the same as defying God and that cannot be tolerated.
Challenging the authority of the representative of God is like
challenging God himself.

On May 27, 1999 Rafsanjani, one of the ruling Mullahs of Iran said:
&quot;If the Islamic nature and fundamental pillar of the state and the
velayat-e

Religion of Peace?: Why Christianity Is and Islam Isn't
(Hardcover)
by Robert Spencer (Author)

From the Inside Flap
Christianity or Islam: which is the real &quot;religion of peace&quot;?
Almost any liberal pundit will tell you that there's a religion bent
on destroying our Constitution, stripping us of our liberties, and
imposing religious rule on the U.S. And that religion
is . . .Christianity! About Islam, however, the Left is silent--except
to claim a moral equivalence between the two: if Islam has terrorists
today, that's nothing compared to the Crusades, inquisitions, and
religious wars in Christianity's past.

But is this true? Are conservative Christians really more of a threat
to free societies than Islamic jihadists? Is the Bible really &quot;just as
violent&quot; as the Qur'an? Is Christianity's history really as
bloodstained as Islam's? In Religion of Peace? Why Christianity Is and
Islam Isn't, New York Times bestselling author Robert Spencer not only
refutes such charges, but also explains why Americans and Europeans
must regain an appreciation of our Christian heritage if we ever hope
to defeat Islamic supremacism. In this eye opening work, Spencer
reveals:

* The fundamental differences between Islamic and Christian teachings
about warfare against other religions: &quot;Love your enemies&quot; vs. &quot;Be
ruthless to the unbelievers&quot;

* The myth of Western immorality and Islamic puritanism and why the
Islamic world is less moral than the West

* Why the Islamic world has never developed the distinction between
religious and secular law that is inherent in Christianity

* Why Christianity has always embraced reason--and Islam has always
rejected it

* Why the most determined enemies of Western civilization may not be
the jihadists at all, but the leftists who fear their churchgoing
neighbors more than Islamic terrorists

* Why Jews, Christians, and peoples of other faiths (or no faith) are
equally at risk from militant Islam

Spencer writes not to proselytize, but to state a fact: Christianity
is a true &quot;religion of peace,&quot; and on it Western civilization stands.
If we are not to perish under Islam's religion of the sword--with its
more than 100 million active jihadists seeking to impose sharia law--
we had better defend our own civilization.

I agree with you on this, be like going to get a poll at the Catholic
college asking them to say if they support the Pope or not.  Take the
same Poll at a convention of atheist if the Pope is accepted as doing
a good job, or is the voice for God.
