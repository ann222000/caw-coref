If a company needs financial incentives to locate in your
jurisdiction, you might want to think twice about who you're trying to
recruit. The City of Martinsville found out the hard way when it enticed
MZM Inc. into locating its Foreign Supplier Assessment Center to the
city. The scandal-ridden center closed earlier this month.

The episode has garnered headlines mainly because it's an issue in
the re-election race of U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode, who, according to the
Roanoke Times , "requested $3.6 million in federal funds for the center
that eventually went to MZM, which at the time was headed by Mitchell
Wade, one of his key campaign contributors. Wade has since pleaded
guilty to bribing a California congressman in exchange for defense
contracts and making $46,000 in illegal contributions to Goode's
campaign."

But there's a larger issue. Martinsville is on the hook for at least
$100,000 in economic development incentives granted the now-defunct MZM,
and may also be liable for part of a $500,000 state grant. The Roanoke
Times has the details here .

I can't be too hard on Martinsville, which has seen its textile- and
furniture-based economy take a pounding over the past 20 years.
Unemployment was running high in 2003 when the decisions were made, and
city leaders were desperate to create new jobs. But communities need to
exercise due diligence before they pass out financial incentives. Being
forced to repay $100,000, $200,000 or more could hobble the city's
economic development programs in the near future.

As the story itself points out, it is not usual for the local
government to assume the repayment promise that is normally imposed on
the business. This untypical example does not raise quite as many red
flags as you imply -- since in most deals it is (as it should be) the
business which is on the hook for non performance. Who encouraged
Martinsville to make this bonehead deal?

How could Martinsville have known in advance that this company was
going to be involved in such shenanigans? Companies are in the business
to make money, to be sure. But the vast majority of businesses
understand that their continued existence depends on ethical and fair
business dealings.

We can't say the same for government enterprises, which is why the
government enterprises are the ones that need the greatest scrutiny.

In fact, we could say the opposite for government enterprises. Their
continued existence consists of surveying the market and finding out who
has the most votes and who has the most money. Their modus operandi
consists of transferring the latter to the former. <
