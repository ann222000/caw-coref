I was quite shocked to see this story:
http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4168476a7693.html#Scene_1

Where John Van Vilet of JR Orchards managed to set of a massive fireball
which killed and maimed hundreds of birds. I am surprised that this is
allowed, even with firefighters present it sounds like a major risk.

But the real shocking thing is the cruelty towards the birds, those who have
been maimed?

Here is a photo of the guy here on his website:

Good that he set off a &quot;massive fireball&quot; then!
If it had been smaller, less of the pests would have been killed, and
possibly more just injured.

The story revolts me.  I hate to think of the maimed, burned and
flightless starlings struggling on the ground.

However, the orchardist has done nothing worse than accepted practice.
Orchardists employ bird shooters every year.  Airports routinely
poison seagulls.  And chicken farming and battery egg production are
cruel on a scale far exceeding this.

They're starlings.  Imported pests, y'know, like possums, and wasps.

He's a fool. Those starlings were near nesting, when they need live food for
their chicks, and kill a huge amount of &quot;bugs&quot;, grassgrub etc, rather than
taking fruit, which isn't around now anyway, except for citrus, and I've
never seen starlings helping themselves to those. (My tui does, he pecks a
small hole in the grapefruit and drinks the juice, I've watched him at it.)

It seems there is no law against what he did, but I think the SPCA is
working on it, from what was on TV.

As far as I know, there is no law against putting a curse on someone,
either.
Violence is out, of course, but a nice natural disaster...........

I wonder.

While this story is terrible your spamming their contact details here is

Imagine if everyone did it for those that did things we disagreed with?

I believe that posting contact details should only be used for the real
scum of the net...the spammers

Hell's teeth, what an weird view!  The net is is means of communication - what
you suggest would mean that dead-tree media should only publicise offenders
against dead-tree media production and distribution, phones likewise....

The man behaved in a way that people with an average amount of compassion and
empathy consider vile in the extreme.  It appears that the legal channels are
not available to address his cruelty so it's not as if publishing his details
would prejudice his chance of a fair trial.

He picked on the helpless just as surely as those scum who set fire to dogs and
kittens.  He hasn't the insight to feel remorse, he doesn't appear to think that
cruelty to non-humans is significant.  Let him take whatever comes - short of
extreme violence - from anyone who follows up the leads given in the original
post.

Well, it's not nice I suppose, but lots of our food production has
unsavoury practices.  Visit abbatoirs and battery hen plants. Take
particular note of what happens to male chicks.

No, because they're brought to life only to serve the human
food-making machine.  Their choice is either to complete the journey,

Their brought to life to enhance existence. To share their milk is a
kind gift.
I ate cheese this morning feeling I had made a step to share life on
earth with another communicating. Yes communicating living mammel!
Cows they see you arrive and they see expressions. They see a truck
arrive and they see human expressions. They see the same anxiety they
themselves feel when from their number a cow is storm drained and
ditch dies.
Through mammilian, reptilian, shared facial expressions. Cows, lambs,

That's Tilly, alright.  To answer your question, no, I do not.  But it
makes no difference to the puppies whose hand it is that smothers
them.  You avert your eyes and pretend it does not happen in your
world of delusions, whilst I live in the real world.

Tilly is the kind of person who uses all the conveniences of the
technical world, while decrying everything that makes it possible.
It's not a pretty sight.

Maybe the artificial breasts could be filled with hydrogen instead of
silicone. Make them weightless and give them a nice uplift.

And drank wine.

But he freed the sacrificial doves.

&gt;&gt; This man has a history of cruelty to animals and birds.
&gt;&gt; Note the coward left the country immediately to avoid the fallout.
&gt;&gt; Only a psychopath would do what he did,  the local farmers and
&gt;&gt; orchardists
&gt;&gt; are outraged at his cruelty.

&gt; I hadn't heard anything about him, or leaving the country etc.,
&gt; but then I'm not really nto gossip and all dat jazz
&gt; but I do know many farmers and orchardists and as far as I am aware
&gt; they don't target bird tribes for extermination

Somebody should check the dead and injured birds for species. If even one
native bird such as a tui is found, surely action can then be taken against
the ratbag.

A rapid, painless death. It is traumatic for them to be
transported in trucks and held for hours in the yards at the
works. They can smell the blood and hear the animals further up
the line being slaughtered.

They calm down pretty quickly after being on a truck. Yards they are used to
(for dairy cows anyway). Yes they can smell the blood but I'm sure when they
hear the sounds of slaughter they don't associate it with that. Most cows
that I've worked with arn't too freaked out at the smell of blood, but I've
seen bulls get uppity at the smell. Although I'm told if you were to cut a
cow's neck in the yards you would have a stampede on your hands...
