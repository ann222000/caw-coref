Hi everyone,

Forgive me if this has been discussed at meetings recently as I’ve not been
able to make one for a while, but has there been any discussion as to when
and where the SHSFG Christmas party is going to happen this year?

Regards

Phil Plumbly

Hi everyone,

In the light of the complete nil response, is there any interest in having
an SHSFG Christmas party this year, and if so who wants to host it?

John,

Great to hear from you, and your offer is appreciated but I suspect you’re
right regarding attendees and the distance involved.

Anyone else want to offer to hold the party?

I personally would prefer the week before as that makes it easier for people
who already have work Christmas do commitments or those out of town have
more chance to attend.

I’m already committed to going to a Christmas do on that date.

Thanks for volunteering though Jeff, what date do you prefer to hold it?

I'm always interested in a party.  I hosted a Xmas one almost as an initiation into the SHSFG.  I suppose I could do another if no one else will.  At least the timing will be right since the money's about to come in.

From a famine to a feast.  Dave has now volunteered o hold the Christmas Party too, so fight amongst yourselves and let us know what you decide.

As for dates 8th or 15th is good for me.  I do have a county poker final on one of those weekends but it is on a Sunday so no problems there.

I await your democratic decision.

I sent my party offer in while catching up on my email after Cornwall, not realising that Jeff had already made one.  But I'll abide by the vote.

I’d like to thank both Jeff and Dave for coming forward and volunteering to
run the party this year. Anna and I ran it last year, and felt someone else
ought to have the chance to do it this year.

Dave, no offence but my preference would be to have the party at Jeff’s
place on the 8th as I’m not available for the option of the 15th, and we’re
likely to be out of Portsmouth for much of the day on the 8th so won’t want
to travel to Gosport and back that evening as well.

I’d be more than happy to attend any subsequent party at your place at
another time....

But I will be happy to abide by any majority vote as to location and date.

Regards
