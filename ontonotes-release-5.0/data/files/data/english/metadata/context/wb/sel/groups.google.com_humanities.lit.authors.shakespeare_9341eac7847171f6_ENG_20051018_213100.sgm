There was something peculiar about 'Troilus and Cressida' - the play
was not listed in the First Folio Catalogue, yet was printed therein.

And it was left out in some copies of the First Folio.

What was going on?

An oversight?

A hint - as in, figure this one out?

I don't know how David Kathman and Terry Ross would answer these
questions - they must have thought about them and, if they had figured
out what was going on, it is fair surmise that they would have placed
their answer on record.

Another peculiariy about 'Troilus and Cressida' is the Preface to the
1609 edition of the play - one that (I like to think) served to
document the views of the Shakespeare Authors of what we now know as
Stratfordian Orthodoxy:

As in the reference therein to &quot;all such dull and heavy-witted
worldlings, as were never capable of the witte of a Commedie, comming
by report of them to his representations, have found that witte there
that they never found in themselves, and have parted better-wittied
then they came: feeling an edge of witte set upon them, more then ever
they dreamd they had braine to grinde it on.&quot;

The Shakespeare Authors knew precisely what they were doing - or so I
construe the reference in the Preface to &quot;grand censors&quot; and &quot;grand
possessors&quot; and the assertion that, when the Author bids farewell, the
stage is set for &quot;an English Inquisition.&quot;

&quot;What meanes this, my Lord?&quot;, Ophelia asks Hamlet after &quot;the dumbe
shew&quot; has been presented in Act III, Sc. ii.

And, after Hamlet has explained that it &quot;meanes Mischeefe&quot;, erstwhile
wretched Ophelia gets the point:

&quot;Belike this shew imports the Argument of the Play.&quot;

Why, indeed!

Provided only that the audience is well enough versed in the imagery of
ancient creation myth and the Kabbalistic aspect of the Shakespeare
Opus to recognize the Argument of the Play.

Without further ado, here is the relevant text from the First Folio -

Hoboyes play. The dumbe shew enters.

Enter a King and Queene, very louingly; the Queene embracing him. She
kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vnto him. He takes her vp, and
declines his head vpon her neck. Layes him downe vpon a Banke of
Flowers. She seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him. Anon comes in a Fellow,
takes off his Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares,
and Exits. The Queene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes
passionate Action. The Poysoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes
in againe, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away:
The Poysoner Wooes the Queene with gifts, she seemes loath and
vnwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his loue. Exeunt.

Ophe.
What meanes this, my Lord?
Ham.
Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes Mischeefe.
Ophe.
Belike this shew imports the Argument of the Play.
Ham.
We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players cannot keepe counsell,
they'l tell all.
Ophe.
Will they tell vs what this shew meant?
Ham.
I, or any shew that you'l shew them.
Bee not you asham'd to shew,
hee'l not shame to tell you what it meanes.
Ophe.
You are naught, you are naught. Ile marke the Play.

Enter Prologue.
For vs, and for our Tragedie,
Heere stooping to your Clemencie:
We begge your hearing Patientlie.

Ham.
Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?
Ophe.
'Tis briefe my Lord.
Ham.
As Womans loue.

- and the 1609 Preface to Troilus and Cressida, which heralds &quot;a new
play&quot; - one that was &quot;never stal'd with the Stage, never clapper-clawd
with the palmes of the vulger...&quot;

***

My goodness! What snob! What arrogant fool!

It's almost as if the author is looking down his nose at the &quot;grand
censors&quot; of today, whose &quot;new English Inquisition&quot; is on display on
HLAS every day.

Well.

The answer to Ophelia's question - &quot;What meanes this, my Lord?&quot; - is
readily elicited by means of a weed despised by &quot;all such dull and
heavy-witted worldlings, as were never capable of the witte of a
Commedie...&quot;

***

- which &quot;imports the Argument of the Play&quot; through the 1609 Preface to
'Troilus and Cressida':

A never Writer to an ever Reader NEWES.

Eternall reader, you have heere a new play, never stal'd with the
Stage, never clapper-clawd with the palmes of the vulger, and yet
passing full of the palme comicall; for it is a birth of your braine,
that never undertooke any thing commicall, vainely: And were but the
vaine names of commedies changde for the titles of Commodities, or of
Playes for Pleas; you should see all those grand censors, that now
stile them such vanities, flock to them for the maine grace of their
gravities: especially this authors Commedies, that are so fram'd to the
life, that they serve for the most common Commentaries of all the
actions of our lives, shewing such a dexteritie and power of witte,
that the most displeased with Playes, are pleasd with his Commedies.
And all such dull and heavy-witted worldlings, as were never capable of
the witte of a Commedie, comming by report of them to his
representations, have found that witte there that they never found in
themselves, and have parted better-wittied then they came: feeling an
edge of witte set upon them, more then ever they dreamd they had braine
to grinde it on. So much and such savored salt of witte is in his
Commedies, that they seeme (for their height of pleasure) to be borne
in that sea that brought forth Venus. Amongst all there is none more
witty then this. And had I time I would comment upon it, though I know
it needs not, (for so much as will make you thinke your testerne well
bestowd) but for so much worth, as even poore I know to be stuft in it.
It deserves such a labour, as well as the best Commedy in Terence or
Plautus. And beleeve this, That when hee is gone, and his Commedies
out of sale, you will scramble for them, and set up a new English
Inquisition. Take this for a warning, and at the perrill of your
pleasures losse, and Judgements, refuse not, nor like this the lesse
for not being sullied, with the smoaky breath of the multitude; but
thanke fortune for the scape it hath made amongst you. Since by the
grand possessors wills, I beleeve, you should have prayd for them
rather then beene prayd. And so I leave all such to bee prayd for (for
the states of their wits healths) that will not praise it. Vale.
