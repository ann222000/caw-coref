Did Fender use plastic, solid-shaft pots in  the mid-60's ?  137 says
CTS,  but what does 6840 say ?

Speaking of plastic shaft pots, is there anything inherently wrong with them
as opposed to metal shafts?

Knurled plastic shafts might be more easily stripped. With solid
plastic shafts, a set-screw might be able to get a better 'bite' into
the plastic, vs. against a solid round metal shaft.

$79 starting price says there's a sucker born every minute.  It's a rusty,

Now, now...

You know better than that.  Pots are made from carbon,
and the older they are, the less carbon-14 they have in
them.  Everybody knows carbon-14 has shitty tone.
New pots just can't measure up.  Shame on you.

They are also sold to SCAMMERS trying to fake a vintage guitar.  But
what really pisses me off is repro (or even real) neck plates with
vintage serial numbers!

Many a Fender amp has tumbled a flight of stairs.

The difference between the shafts is simple at the bottom of the stairs.

One shaft yields the broken knobs to be replaced.

The other type shaft gets broken off, and pots are now replaced.

You're absolutely right.
BTW, there's no such thing as a Fender pot, it's a CTS pot.
For every pot CTS sold Fender, they sold 100,000's more
to other manufacturer. They found their way in countless
radios, TV's, stereos. Tear apart a 1968 radio, chances
are you'll find CTS pots.

AFA this ebay item is concerned, I've thrown out better ones.

Hell, what will they sell next, the original set of strings?

What about that thin plastic film that covers the pickguard?

It is not the carbon-14 vintage pots idiots desire,
but the copper used on the sweeper arm inside the pot.

Prior to mid 60's, those copper components were
mined right in the United States. Afterwards copper was
imported from Africa and Asia. The whole reason
Vietnam happened was not to defeat communism, but safe passage
of cheap copper to the United States Electronic manufactures.

NASA needed mass amounts of copper for the Space program.
The coverup started with Truman and ended with Nixon. Makes
the JFK killings look like child's play. Bobby Kennedy wanted
to keep the mines for the poor blacks to have work in the Southern
States. That is why he was gunned down in LA.

Trust me.

Week 40, 1968
http://www.theguitarfiles.com/guitarfile578.html

I would have said '68 was late 60s. Plastic shaft CTS pots seem to have been
used on amps (and occasionally guitars) then. In fact my '69 Swinger
probably does, but I'll have to check.

From:
http://zeus.lunarpages.com/~jimshi2/potcodes/potcodes.htm
&quot;  Okay, now that I shown the theory, I will show some deviations with the
code. Lets take &quot;032367&quot; as an example. In theory, this code represents a
solid shaft, 250K ohm potentiometer used in Telecaster, Esquire, Musicmaster
family, P-Bass, J-bass , Bass 6, and any other guitar requiring a pot with
these specs. Often amplifiers require a similar potentiometer in the
circuit. I have seen many 032367 pots in late 60's and 70's amplifiers.
Usually they have a nylon shaft, but these are found in guitars as well from
time to time.&quot;

Yeah, I don't put 100% faith in sheer numbers of ebay transaction, the price
is more important to me.  For example, some sellers have sold hundreds of $3
items and then they list a $1000 item.  I like to see what completed
auctions they have before considering their feedback.  I've only got an ebay
feedback of 38 (been a ebay member since the late 90's), but the cheapest
thing I've bought or sold was over $100 and the most expensive thing I sold
was $15K and I have a 100% feedback rating.

Sounds good to me - it's not exactly a sealed precision instrument. Just
folded tabs, as far as I can see (love those old Fenders).

Any particular pot - make, etc. - I need to source to do this? I'm assuming
that designs differ, and that the only way you find out is AFTER you've
stripped one down and maybe found it won't fit. On the other hand, maybe
modern replacements are no different (at least track-wise) from the oldies.

&gt; &gt; &quot;  Okay, now that I shown the theory, I will show some deviations with the
&gt; &gt; code. Lets take &quot;032367&quot; as an example. In theory, this code represents a
&gt; &gt; solid shaft, 250K ohm potentiometer used in Telecaster, Esquire,
&gt; &gt; Musicmaster family, P-Bass, J-bass , Bass 6, and any other guitar
&gt; &gt; requiring a pot with these specs. Often amplifiers require a similar
&gt; &gt; potentiometer in the circuit. I have seen many 032367 pots in late 60's
&gt; &gt; and 70's amplifiers. Usually they have a nylon shaft, but these are found
&gt; &gt; in guitars as well from time to time.&quot;

&gt; More to the point, what do we do about duds, like the one I took off my '62
&gt; Strat after it finally became just too unreliable?  Switch cleaner
&gt; eventually had no effect, but it's 'an original', and as such should be on
&gt; the guitar. Which, in turn, is meant to be played, after all...

&gt; Nothing is ever clear-cut : 0 (

&gt; RM
">

A very long time ago, I had a fellow bring in an old Tele.

He wanted a setup, and told me to replace the pots.

He said he sprayed them, and it didn't help at all.

So, before doing any work on anything, I always verify the customer complaint.

Yes, the action was uneven, and the intonation not correct.

However, there was nothing wrong with the pots.

So, I setup the guitar, and left the pots alone.

We hooked the guitar up to my amp for a play test before he paid his bill.

Later one that day, he called to tell me the pots were still scratchy.

I told him to bring in the amp he was using with the guitar along with his Tele.

We hooked them up, and sure enough, the pots were scratchy.

Then, I plugged in my Strat, and my volume control was suddenly scratchy.

I then, fired up my amp, plugged in his Tele, and found his volume pot just fine.

Likewise my strat.

DC from his amp was the problem.
