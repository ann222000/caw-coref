Fabulous Letters! Empower Many Voices, Speak Truth to Power! Each person on ODSP has been harmed by ODSP Discrimination. ODSP violates each Person's Charter Right to Equality. Every Person on ODSP is entitled to say "I was screwed, my Rights were Violated." It's True, Prove Me Wrong, Dalton McGuinty Can't. http://home.cogeco.ca/~mmdilts/Profiles/Thomasson.htm

Still, no one, not even anonymously,  can prove ODSP fully complies with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. When not one person, can prove  ODSP fully complies with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, we must conclude that ODSP violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. ODSP violates the Charter Rights of each and every person on ODSP. Prove Me Wrong, Dalton McGuinty Can't.

Violating any Person's Charter Rights endangers Every Person's Charter Rights. The only way to ensure that any person's rights are protected is to ensure that Every Person's Charter Rights are protected. If the Government can violate some people's human rights it will certainly try to violate more people's human rights.

The hardest part is convincing people that ODSP discrimination is real. Most people's first reaction is "That makes no sense, They wouldn't do That". ODSP Discrimination is so clearly wrong that it is very hard to convince people it is happening. ODSP Discrimination is so bizarre most people find it hard to believe without strong proof.

Day by day  the $1,000 ODSP Discrimination Challenge creates stronger and stronger proof that ODSP violates the Charter. Hopefully the Challenge will convince people that ODSP Discrimination is real and must be stopped.

Please make sure you tell your own local MPP. You can find out who your MPP is and how to contact them in the Empowerment Section on the Challenge Page http://home.cogeco.ca/~mmdilts/Profiles/Thomasson.htm Each constituent is entitled to ask their MPP to stop ODSP discrimination, as well as asking the Minister.

Numbers matter, we need thousands of people speaking out across Ontario.  Please tell your MPP and your community about ODSP Discrimination, ask them to help stop it. Ask your friends, family, community, to speak out. Please help stop ODSP Discrimination.

Sincerely David Thomasson

Mr. Thomasson's most eloquent letter drives home a very serious point.
This is why letters must be written. There are people on this site who
will help you compose or edit it, as it must be brief and to the
point. We have the power to bring change. Please think about your vote
in the upcoming election.

Dave is Right!
If the Government can take our rights away ( private medical info
which they say they destroy but I don't by it) not to mention the
rights between patient and Physician is confidential like lawyer/
client it is privilaged info), how is it that a Government empoyee or
Minister can make medical calls that override a doctor or specialist&lt;
as well as rights to proper access to vote if disabled, using medical
info
against a person, equality, etc. They are stipping and eroding all our
rights. They are leaving us in poverty,why, because the public thinks
they can't end up like us and their right's are not untouchable!
Privacy
is important, but ODSP &amp; OW have there noses in all our affairs.
Think about it they know more about us them the need to! Nothing is
scared!!
So write, get family and friends involved, what about our rights to
access to all the documents we have supplied them under Freedom Of
Information Act? Its our files, its our personal information!
Everyone needs to get involved! It starts with us! So look at the
letters available to you to use give friends and families copies and
mail them in
fax, e-mail (problem with e-mail they can clain they didn't get it)
mail and fax are the best options!
Sincerely
Joan

I finally got to a place that I don't get hassled or bugged or any
number of things that did happen. I'm afraid if I write letters etc.
then my head would be back in a sling!

you!)

Hi Joan,
You don't need to do that. At the last meeting of
the ODSP Recipients' Support Group, we were told that
we have the right to call our worker, make an
appointment and go in and look at our file. We have a
right to see our file. You don't need Freedom of
Information Act. All you need is a phone. Why not try
it it?
Bonnie

Annie,
I've never felt threatened or fearful in speaking out on ODSP or any
other matter.  In fact, some of the people at the ODSP office ask for
and get copies of letters I write from me and they say, "You go girl!"
In fact, when they gave me the letter telling me my special diet $$
was cut, the worker who did this was almost apologetic and saying,
"You are going to appeal this, aren't you?"  I did tell them it's not
THEIR fault the special diets were cut.  They're just doing what the
Minister and her policy people ordered. In fact, the Minister shoulders
the blame all on her own.  And now, the Minister is whining about
so many appeals being made about the special diet ... like, huh?
What did they THINK was going to happen when they pulled that
stunt?  As if we're all going to walk away and say, "yes, Minister".
