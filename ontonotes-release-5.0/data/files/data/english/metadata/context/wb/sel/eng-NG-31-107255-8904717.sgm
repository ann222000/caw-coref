GlaxoSmithKline's Deadly Cover-Up
By Shelley Jofre, CorpWatch

A striking young woman with a talent for painting, Sharise Gatchell was --
like many teenagers -- painfully self-conscious. At 14, she moved with her
family from South Africa to England where at first she found it hard to make
friends. By the age of 16 she was acutely embarrassed that her periods
hadn't started and felt she was sweating excessively. Just the sort of thing
to make adolescence even more painful than usual. Her mother, Stephanie,
took her to see a consultant physician at the local hospital. Stephanie
Gatchell recalls:

&quot;During that consultation she became a bit emotional because she was
explaining to him about the problems she had and how it affected her social
life. Then she started crying and I was amazed. He asked her, 'Sharise, do
you sometimes feel like ending it all?', and I couldn't believe it when she
said 'Yes I do.' And then he started talking about paroxetine and suggesting
that she try it.&quot;

&quot;Off-label&quot; Prescriptions

Paroxetine -- better known as Paxil in the U.S. -- is an antidepressant. It
is licensed only for adults, but doctors are allowed to prescribe any
medicine if they think it will help their patient, a practice called
&quot;off-label&quot; prescribing. Sharise was not the only teenager getting
paroxetine off-label. Around 7,000 children a year were on the drug in the
UK; and many more in the U.S.

Within days of starting on paroxetine, Stephanie noticed a dramatic change
in her daughter: she became more confident. But with the confidence came
aggression and worse:

&quot;One day in the kitchen her sleeve pulled up slightly and I noticed that
there were cut marks on her left arm. I couldn't believe my eyes. She was
obviously self-harming while she was on the drug, something she's never ever
done before.&quot;

Stephanie persuaded her daughter to stop taking paroxetine. But in 2003
Sharise went back on it without telling her mother. When her parents
returned from a weekend break, Stephanie immediately realized something was
terribly wrong:

&quot;I went upstairs before my husband came in, and the moment I got to the
landing at the top and I turned round and looked, she was hanging from the
loft hatch. I tried to revive her, but before I even started I realized I
was too late.&quot;

Next to her daughter's suicide note lay a packet of paroxetine. Stephanie
instinctively blamed the drug and now blames herself for letting her
daughter take it. But she couldn't have known what the drug's manufacturer
had known for years.

GlaxoSmithKline Experiments on Children

UK-based GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the second largest drug company in the
world, which recorded 2006 sales of over $45 billion, had begun a series of
clinical trials in the mid-1990s to test whether paroxetine would work in
depressed children. Paroxetine had already been hailed as a wonder drug in
adults as a treatment for everything from depression and stress to anxiety
and even shyness. By the new millennium 100 million paroxetine prescriptions
had been written worldwide, bringing in $2 billion a year for GSK and
placing the antidepressant a close second to Prozac in popularity.

With the adult market sewn up, the company sought new ways to make money
from the drug, or &quot;life cycle management,&quot; as the approach is known in the
pharmaceutical industry. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wanted to
boost the number of medicines tested for children and had introduced an
incentive that would give companies a six-month extension on their patent
just for carrying out pediatric trials. For paroxetine alone that would be
worth $1 billion. And if GSK could be the first company to prove its
antidepressant was safe and effective for children, the rewards would be
even higher, as paroxetine could become the market leader.

Hundreds of children were recruited from around the world to take part in
three clinical trials. One group was given the drug, the other a placebo.
They were randomized controlled trials (RCT) where neither the children nor
their doctors knew whether they were taking the active drug or the placebo
until the end of the study. This is widely accepted as the best way of
working out whether a drug causes a particular effect: the gold standard in
terms of evidence.

But the outcome of these the trials was not what GSK had been hoping for.
Paroxetine proved no better than placebo. In the biggest trial, Study 329,
which was conducted across several sites in the U.S., 11 of the 93 children
who took paroxetine developed serious side-effects; seven had to be
hospitalized. Significantly more had self-harmed or attempted suicide on the
drug than on placebo.

The BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) obtained confidential case
reports from Study 329 which detail what happened to them:

&quot;[13 days after starting paroxetine] the patient became very angry. He
punched pictures, broke glass and sustained lacerations that required six
sutures... he expressed hopelessness and possible suicide thoughts.&quot;

&quot;The patient began exhibiting symptoms of disinhibition, grandiosity and
expansive mood around week four [after eight weeks] the patient became
agitated and said she would kill herself.&quot;

&quot;[11 days after starting paroxetine] the patient was hospitalized for
psychosis with auditory hallucinations and superficial cuts.&quot;

Yet this was a drug that was supposed to make children happier and reduce
the risk of suicide.

The company knew it had a problem. In an internal memo to senior executives
in 1998 the product director for paroxetine admitted:

&quot;The results of the studies were disappointing. The possibility of obtaining
a safety statement from this data was considered but rejected. Consultation
of the marketing teams confirmed that this would be unacceptable
commercially.&quot;

In other words, publishing the data in full would undermine the drug's
safety profile and put profits at risk. It took five years for this
information to reach the public domain and only then as a result of the BBC
investigation. In the intervening years doctors continued to prescribe a
drug to tens of thousands of vulnerable children, ignorant of the fact that
it had not been shown to work and was harmful to some.

Lawsuits Reveal Questionable Paper Trail

This has been described by British psychiatrist Dr. David Healy as &quot;the
biggest medical scandal since thalidomide.&quot; Dr. Healy, rather than the
regulatory authorities charged with monitoring the safety of medicines, was
instrumental in uncovering the evidence at the heart of the scandal. It was
a series of U.S. legal actions that led Dr. Healy, as an expert witness, and
the legal team with whom he was working, deep into GSK's secret archives,
where they found a series of damning internal documents.

What this paper trail reveals is how the company, with no hope of obtaining
a children's license, devised a back-door method of marketing paroxetine for
childhood depression. In came the spin-doctors to bury the inconvenient
facts and spread the good news to doctors around the world that paroxetine
was safe and effective for children.

Drug companies discovered long ago that doctors are much more likely to be
persuaded by their peers than by the hard sell of sales reps. So GSK built a
business relationship with several leading academics to write articles and
speak at conferences, effectively selling paroxetine for the company. They
are known in the trade as &quot;Key Opinion Leaders.&quot;

Internal company documents reveal that Professor Martin Keller, Chair of
Psychiatry at Brown University in the U.S., was one of the company's leading
Key Opinion Leaders. He was named as the author of Study 329. But the
documents cast doubt on whether he actually analyzed the data himself and
wrote the final paper. In a memo, Professor Keller thanks a ghost writer for
the initial preparation of the study manuscript -- a ghost writer who works
for a medical public relations company hired by GSK:

&quot;You did a superb job with this. Thank you very much. It is excellent.
Enclosed are some rather minor changes from me.&quot;

It is clear from the internal correspondence that the ghost writer was
making some important decisions about how to present the data for
publication. At one point a senior GSK executive comments that: &quot;It seems
incongruous that we state that paroxetine is safe yet report so many Serious
Adverse Events.&quot;

GSK suggests to the public relations person that she make clear paroxetine
may have caused all 11 of the serious side-effects. But the final article
says: &quot;Of the 11 patients, only headache (1 patient) was considered to be
related to the treatment.&quot;

The paper never states clearly how many children became suicidal, nor does
it explore whether the drug was to blame. Instead, it concludes that
paroxetine is &quot;generally well-tolerated and effective&quot;.

The next step in GSK's marketing plan was to get the study published.
Doctors rely on medical journals to give them advice they can trust. The
first journal GSK approached spotted flaws in the study and rejected it. So
the company sent it to the premier children's mental health magazine, the
Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Its peer
reviewers also spotted the flaws, as is clear from their confidential
comments:

&quot;Overall. Results do not clearly indicate efficacy, authors need to clearly
note this.&quot;

&quot;The relatively high rate of serious adverse effects was not addressed in
the discussion.&quot;

&quot;Given the high placebo response rate, are [these drugs] an acceptable
first-line therapy for depressed teenagers?&quot;

Nevertheless, the journal published the study. Who knows how many child and
adolescent psychiatrists around the world were influenced by the article's
misleading conclusion?

At the same time, another of GSK's PR people was saying in an internal memo:

&quot;Originally we had planned to do extensive media relations surrounding this
study until we actually viewed the results. Essentially the study did not
really show paroxetine was effective in treating adolescent depression,
which is not something we want to publicize.&quot;

Objective Medical Opinion?

When I first started looking at Study 329 for the BBC in 2002, I was
confused about its findings. The published article's conclusions seemed at
odds with the details of the study. I went to Philadelphia to interview one
of the authors and came across another of GSK's Key Opinion Leaders -- Dr.
Neil Ryan, an eminent child psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh. He
was speaking at an American Psychiatric Association symposium sponsored by
GSK but I had no reason at that time to think he was anything other than
independent.

Dr. Ryan told the audience that paroxetine was effective for children with
depression. He didn't mention anything about the apparent high rate of
psychiatric side-effects of paroxetine in Study 329. But the more I studied
the data, the more convinced I became that paroxetine was causing serious
problems for some kids who took it. When I returned to Britain, I pursued
him by telephone but he refused to talk to me about it.

Fast forward four years, when the internal GSK documents revealed what had
actually been going on behind the scenes. Dr. Ryan had been asking the
company that sponsored his research how he should deal with my awkward
questions, emailing all my correspondence to them. In one email he said:

&quot;I'll call you again later today and you can advise on how might be best to
handle this.&quot;

GSK denies that it promoted paroxetine for off-label use through Key Opinion
Leaders or any other route, laying the responsibility firmly at the door of
individual clinicians.

A statement issued by the company reads: &quot;Any decision to prescribe a
medicine outside its authorized indications, in the EU or the U.S., is made
by a doctor on the basis of his/her clinical judgement and the interests of
their patient.&quot;

But where do doctors get the information from that gives them the confidence
to prescribe off-label? From medical journals and conferences.

It was the documents that in the end exposed the Key Opinion Leaders and the
drug company. Without the U.S. legal action we would have been none the
wiser. The drug is now effectively banned in the UK for use in under-18s and
in the U.S. it carries a &quot;black box&quot; warning about the risk of suicidal
behaviour.

This drug was GSK's golden egg for many years and a lucrative business was
built around its promotion. So it is perhaps not surprising the company
dismissed my investigation as media scaremongering. What is surprising,
though, is how many doctors on both sides of the Atlantic who claim to
practice evidence-based medicine still refuse to acknowledge the damage the
drugs can do -- even though the evidence comes from GSK's own RCTs and the
company's internal correspondence clearly shows how they tried to cover it
up.

Sales Affected by Warning Labels

Dr. Mike Shooter, former President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and
a child psychiatrist who used to prescribe paroxetine, says:

&quot;I personally felt cheated and heaven only knows what the children,
adolescents and their parents and their doctors on the other end of that
felt. Very much the same. This has huge implications, right through
medicine.&quot;

Professor Keller and Dr. Ryan seem unabashed by their role in the scandal. A
few months ago Professor Keller co-authored another paper, on the impact of
media reporting on prescribing. Rather than exploring how those conducting
the trials overlooked the damage to children caused by the drug, he and his
co-authors expressed concern that prescriptions of antidepressants to
children have declined sharply in the U.S. since the addition of the black
box warning -- as if the increased risk of suicidal behaviour on the drugs
wasn't something that should affect prescribing.

The FDA is now considering whether to remove the black box warning on
paroxetine and other similar antidepressants because it is scaring doctors.
In the UK, the regulatory authorities are investigating whether GSK acted
fraudulently in its conduct over Study 329. Theoretically, criminal charges
could be brought, but the medicine's regulator is fully-funded by the drugs
industry, so don't hold your breath.

Meanwhile, Stephanie Gatchell and her husband have moved away from the home
that holds so many awful memories, to start a new life in Ireland. They
can't forgive GlaxoSmithKline for concealing what it knew about paroxetine:

&quot;I can't understand how they could possibly be so devious, and all just
because of profit. I think the decision-makers in that company should be
brought to justice. They have a lot to explain.&quot;
