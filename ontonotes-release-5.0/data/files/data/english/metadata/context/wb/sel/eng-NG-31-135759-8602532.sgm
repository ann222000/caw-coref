New Nanoparticle Could Provide Simple Early Diagnosis Of Many Diseases

*************************************************
Science Daily - Most people think of hydrogen peroxide as a topical
germ killer, but the medicine cabinet staple is gaining steam in the
medical community as an early indicator of disease in the body.

The nanoparticle polymer is made of peroxalate esters. A fluorescent
dye (pentacene) is then encapsulated into the polymer. When the nano
particles bump into hydrogen peroxide, they excite the dye, which then
emits photons (or light) that can be detected (Credit: Image courtesy

and Emory University researchers are the first to create a
nanoparticle capable of detecting and imaging trace amounts of
hydrogen peroxide in animals. The nanoparticles, thought to be
completely nontoxic, could some day be used as a simple, all-purpose
diagnostic tool to detect the earliest stages of any disease that
involves chronic inflammation - everything from cancer and Alzheimer's
to heart disease and arthritis.

The research, lead by the laboratories of Niren Murthy at the Wallace
H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and
Emory University and Dr. Robert Taylor in the Division of Cardiology
at the Emory University School of Medicine, will appear in the October
issue of Nature Materials and was funded by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Hydrogen peroxide is thought to be over-produced by cells at the early
stages of most diseases. Because there were previously no imaging
techniques available to capture this process in the body, the details
of how the hydrogen peroxide is produced and its role in a developing
disease must still be determined.

The Georgia Tech and Emory nanoparticles may be the key to better
understanding the role of hydrogen peroxide in the progression of many
diseases and later play an important diagnostic role, Murthy said.

&quot;These nanoparticles are incredibly sensitive so you can detect
nanomolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. That's important
because researchers aren't yet certain what amounts of hydrogen
peroxide are present in various diseases,&quot; Murthy said.

The ultimate goal, however, is that the nanoparticles could some day
be used as a simple, all-purpose diagnostic tool for most diseases. In
the future, the nanoparticle would be injected by needle into a
certain area of the body (for instance, the heart). If the
nanoparticles encountered hydrogen peroxide, they would emit light.
Should a doctor see a significant amount of light activity in the
area, the doctor would know that the patient may be presenting early
signs of a disease in that area of the body.

The Georgia Tech and Emory nanoparticles penetrate deep tissue and
operate at a high wave length, making them sensitive indicators of the
presence of hydrogen peroxide produced by any sort of inflammation.

The nanoparticle polymer is made of peroxalate esters. A fluorescent
dye (pentacene) is then encapsulated into the polymer. When the nano
particles bump into hydrogen peroxide, they excite the dye, which then
emits photons (or light) that can be detected in a simple, photon-
counting scan.

&quot;It's using this nanoparticle made of peroxalate esters that allows
you to do this three component reaction in vivo. If you were to inject
a peroxalate ester and a dye, they would go their own ways once in the
body. With the nanoparticles, we can sequester both of these reagents
within nanometers of each other, in vivo,&quot; Murthy said.

The goal was to maximize the wavelength of the particles. Wavelength
determines the sensitivity in vivo. And if the particle's wavelength
is high enough, it can penetrate the skin and display clearly on a
scan.

The research team started with a nanoparticle that was made of dye and
filled with peroxide esthers. They later realized that the reverse (a
particle made of peroxalate esters and filled with dye) was more
effective at imaging hydrogen peroxide, Murthy said.

The group will conduct further tests with the nanoparticles to confirm
their safety and effectiveness.
