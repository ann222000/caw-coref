Well, the 2007 Offense is after they stopped taping, and the 2004
Defense was two years before the memo that outlawed the taping.

Isn't revisionism great? The memo didn't outlaw anything, it only
re-emphasized the rule because the Pats were ignoring it. Taping has
been outlawed for years.

Defense:  2000 Ravens
Offense: 1990 Bills

The Rams? After Belichick showed everyone how to beat them in the 2001
Superbowl they were never a threat again.
The Steelers were aided by their great defense.
The Ravens 2000 defense allowed the fewest PPG in NFL history, and
with NO NONE NADA help from their offense.
The Bills went to 4 consecutive Super Bowls.

Came within one missed Ray Wersching field goal of an undefeated season.
Blew out the favored Dolphins 38 - 16. Made Marino look like the chump he
was. The '84 49ers invented both the Fridge and the Super Bowl shuffle.
They embarrased the Bears in the NFC Chmpionship game 21 - 0. To this
day, Ditka seethes over it.

The Bears played the weakest AFC team to make the Super Bowl in many
years. The only reason anyone thinks they were great is because of the
press they get. The screamer Ditka wore his welcome out in Chicago very
soon after, and his classless refusal to allow Walter Payton to score a
TD goes down as one of the lowest acts in sports history.
