Hi everyone,

I have been a pain patient for many years, but have had so many
different diagnoses that I'm confused about what is actually wrong
with me.  I have spinal injuries and pain in my muscles and joints,
but the worst pain is in my neck and shoulders.

For the past few years I have noticed that I seem to have limited
immune responses.  For example, I have had pink eye since August that
has waxed and waned but never completely cleared.  I also have had
chronic sinusitis for over two years now, infection that is causing my
nose to peel and swell, ear infections and other problems.  I seem to
catch every flu or cold that comes around and I can't completely shake
illnesses.  Also, if I get a cut, it inevitably gets badly infected.
As a result, I am always sick and almost constantly running fevers.

I am tempted to think that perhaps there is something greater that is
causing the constant pain and the infections/ illnesses.
Unfortunately, I'm not insured at the moment and the doctors will only
treat the most urgent symptoms (usually by throwing antibiotics and
steroids at them).  Does anyone know of a condition that might fit
what is happening to me?  I am thinking that if I research this and go
to my doctor with a possibility or two, they would be more willing to
help me.

Thank you all in advance!

fairly technical, but the bottom line is that yes, chronic pain [pain
equals 'stress' on body systems] can, of itself, lower immune function
in some [but not all] patients - here are diff. points each from several
diff. study/articles :

&quot;analyzed cytokine expression patterns in 40 patients with chronic
widespread pain (26 of whom had FM), 40 age- and sex-matched healthy
controls, and an additional 15 patients with chronic widespread pain who
were recruited from a different center. Expression of messenger RNA
(mRNA) for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNFalpha), and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1)
in peripheral blood was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Serum protein levels were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We found significantly lower
relative gene expression (P &lt; 0.0001 for IL-4; P = 0.03 for IL-10) and
lower levels of serum protein concentrations (P &lt; 0.0001 for IL-4; P =
0.04 for IL-10) of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in patients with
chronic widespread pain than in the control group. This finding was
corroborated in an additional group of 15 patients with chronic
widespread pain. There were no significant differences between the
groups in levels of mRNA for IL-2, IL-8, TNFalpha, or TGFbeta1. Protein
data paralleled the real-time PCR results. CONCLUSION: Chronic
widespread pain is associated with a lack of antiinflammatory and
analgesic Th2 cytokine activity, which may contribute to its
pathogenesis.&quot;

&quot;Disruption of homeostasis can result in endocrinopathies like
hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, cortisol deficiency, and growth hormone
deficiency. Sleep-disordered breathing and altered sleep architecture,
tolerance, and hyperalgesia are CNS [central nervous system] changes
seen in chronic opioid therapy. In addition, there are reports that the
immune system can be impaired with both opioids and pain. The converse
is true as well, where an altered immune system can induce or enhance
symptoms of pain.

An example of the emerging research on the impact of the
neuroendocrine-immune systems is the study here suggesting a proposed
mechanism of how morphine can modulate the immune system. It was
suggested that activation of the central opioid receptors can regulate
the peripheral immune system through the stimulation of the
hypothalamic, pituitary axis, and the sympathetic nervous systems. The
activation of the HPA [hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal] axis results in a
production of cortisol from the pituitary, and this results in the
release of the glucocorticoids, which can result in a broad spectrum of
immunosuppression. Activation of this system by opioids elicits the
release of hormones from these organs, which had been demonstrated to
suppress lymphocyte activity as well as natural killer cells and
macrophage function. At this time, it is very complex, but it appears to
have an increasing importance in the field of medicine.&quot;

&quot;the people with chronic pain were low on two anti-inflammatory
cytokines: interleukin-4 and interleukin-10. The scientists next
enlisted 15 more people with chronic pain who were taking pain
medications different from those taken by the first 40 patients. The new
group showed the same shortages of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 that
the original group of pain patients showed.&quot;

&quot;Having terrible pain is not good for people. It influences all aspects
of life: mood, concentration, motor performance, sleep, social
relations. New evidence indicates that pain affects the immune system
such that cancer cells appear to grow faster when there is pain. Being a
stoic and putting up with severe pain is not necessarily good for
patients.&quot;

&quot;Some of the physical consequences of untreated or under-treated chronic
pain include: increased stress, metabolic rate, blood clotting and water
retention; delayed healing; hormonal imbalances; impaired immune system
and gastrointestinal functioning; decreased mobility; appetite and sleep
problems;&quot;

i do want to also point to a freq. issue for those in extremis with pain
: we often don't have much physical activity and as such, are in
terrible 'condition' - lung function, muscle tone, liver/kidney
function, etc.

for those individuals, a lack of general 'body' conditioning is a large
factor in overall health. it's not a personal criticism, just a plain
fact that anyone who is in general poor conditon is more subject ot
colds, flu, infections and such.

when you are able to, you might want to ask for a full blood panel
workup looking to see what level of t cells etc. can be found - might be
some info there

Where were you working when all this started? Had you worked there very
long? Were you in the military?

While I realize that you will have to foot the bills yourself I might
see an immunologist. Your typical GP probably does not have much more
than a general understanding of  immune system function. Your
explanation sounds like you are vulnerable to opportunistic infection.
Everyone has a varied susceptibility to colds and flu, however, when
you indicate that you've been suffering conjunctivitis, ear and sinus
infections, along with the colds and flu it becomes more concerning.
And, while wound healing process is not solely a function of the
immune system, it does play a major role.
While I don't want to alarm you I wonder if you have been screened for
HIV infection? What about diabetes? Unchecked diabetes can cause havoc
with cell mediated immunity.
In any event, I would think your money will be better spent seeing a
specialist.

Thanks everyone for the replies.

Paul:  Thank you, that was extremely informative!

Top:  I was a teacher.  However, I retired ten years ago to stay at
home with my children.

Joe B.:  I have been screened for HIV and diabetes; negative on both
counts.  I do suspect thyroid problems.  The problem is that my blood
tests come out fine, but I have a noticeable goiter.  The doctors
have, so far, refused any other testing since the blood tests don't
indicate a problem.  My current PCP is blaming all other problems on
the chronic sinusitis, but that doesn't seem right to me.  We should
have insurance in three months and I will look into an immunologist
then.

Doesn't seem right to me either.
Very happy to see that you have passed the HIV and diabetes tests.

Good Luck and do please let us know how things work out.

After I read my post to you it didn't look the way I meant it to. The
reason for my questions was to find out what you might have been exposed
to. I do hope you find a good solution.
