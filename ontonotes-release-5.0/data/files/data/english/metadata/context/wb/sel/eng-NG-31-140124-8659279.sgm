By BRYAN CURTIS

Good Morning, Mr. Davis. ‘Hello.’ How are you Feeling? ‘We’ll See!’

Behold Al Davis, the owner of the Oakland Raiders. The occasion was the
National Football League’s annual meetings in Phoenix last March, and
Mr. Davis — always “Mr.” for supplicants trying to get his attention —
had agreed to a short interview. The Raiders’ press department, adept in
the ways of Soviet-era obfuscation, had neither confirmed nor denied
Davis’s presence in Phoenix, but here he was, just after 9 a.m.,
standing in the hallway of the Arizona Biltmore.

“At least you can tell everybody he’s well, that he’s not dying,” Davis
told me.

Yes. Nonetheless, the first thing you notice about Al Davis is his
fragility. He moves with both hands clutching a walker, taking small,
mincing steps, and he has an attendant trailing behind him, seemingly to
make sure he doesn’t topple over backward. Davis has watery blue eyes
and an aquiline nose. His sartorial style remains defiantly retro: hair
in a pompadour, body in a polyester tracksuit. He wears a Super Bowl
ring on each hand. He is 78.

Davis began our conversation with a diversionary feint, talking current
events instead of football. “You got these newspapers screaming at the
president of the United States to get out,” he said, “and the president
screaming to stay in. It concerns me, obviously. As it should anyone who
has any interest in what’s going on in this country.” Davis was
concerned about Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chavez, too. “He’s going to
socialize that country and take away land. Now, is that bad? One country
— Cuba — survived with it. I say survived. I don’t want to say prospered.”

I told Davis I had no idea he was interested in foreign affairs. “No, I
know foreign affairs,” he said. “From a strategic standpoint dating back
to World War II, and maybe a little before that, to the growth of the
Third Reich.”

This was an interesting place to take things. In 1981, in a conversation
with the sportswriter Gary Smith, Davis confessed he was “captivated” by
Hitler. Coming from a Jewish man who had grown up in Crown Heights,
Brooklyn, the remark invited all sorts of inquiries.

Davis chuckled when I reminded him of the article. “I didn’t tell him
that,” he said. Davis paused. “He had to be stopped, you know?”

Gary Smith?

“No, Hitler. Now, was there some admiration for what they were doing? If
you were connected with football, you had to have some admiration. You
know, quick strike.”

The Raiders and their quick-strike, “vertical” passing game were so
successful that, over four decades, the team put together the best
winning percentage in the N.F.L. And Al Davis was both the source and
the beneficiary of that success, for no owner inhabits a sports
franchise as thoroughly as he does. Your garden-variety megalomaniac
like George Steinbrenner can achieve a certain grandiosity, but Babe
Ruth and Joe DiMaggio and 20 World Series championships put their stamp
on the Yankees long before Steinbrenner made the scene. Davis has been
with the Raiders for 43 of the team’s 47 seasons. He has been to five
Super Bowls and won three times. He has been the team’s head coach, its
general manager and its managing general partner. (Davis acquired a
small ownership stake in 1966, then leveraged it into control of the
team.) He minted the team’s muscular catchphrases — “just win, baby,”
“pride and poise,” “commitment to excellence” — and he chose its
silver-and-black uniforms. (Davis, as it happens, is colorblind.) Davis
spends most of his time in his Oakland aerie; “I’m not really part of
society,” he once said. Steve Ortmayer, who worked for Davis for 14
years as an assistant coach and director of football operations, says:
“His life is the Raiders. That’s not a statement to be taken lightly,
like a lot of people’s life is what they do. It’s to an extent that he
has never taken a day off from the Raiders. Never.”

This makes Davis the last practitioner of a classical style of sports
management you might call personality-driven football. As perfected by
Paul Brown of the Cincinnati Bengals and George Halas of the Chicago
Bears, personality-driven football is the psychological joining of owner
and team. Davis flouted league decorum in the front office; the Raiders
flouted it on the field. But in the new N.F.L. — which, in his
charmingly out-of-time way, Davis has likened to I.B.M. — teams tend to
be owned by captains of industry and are no more an extension of their
owners’ personalities than their fast-food franchises or theme parks or
used-car empires. Davis, on the other hand, has no other business.
“We’re not a club where the owner was in the widget business,” says Amy
Trask, the Raiders’ C.E.O. Davis pours everything he has into the Raiders.

Which may not be enough anymore. There was a time when, with apologies
to the former N.F.L. commissioner Pete Rozelle and Tex Schramm, the
president and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys, you could have
called Davis the savviest man in the N.F.L. But the league, which has
always strived for competitive parity, has caught up with Davis. In both
its breakneck growth and its adoption of many of the Raiders’ methods,
the N.F.L. has bumped up against the limits of personality-driven
football, because it takes more than one man’s instincts to run a
successful team. Someone must monitor the salary cap, make sense of the
vast amount of data on college prospects and run the stadium — which in
the Raiders’ case happens to be one of the most decrepit in sports.

Since 2003, the Raiders have put together the worst record in the N.F.L.
Davis has been through four head coaches in the past six seasons, most
recently the hapless Art Shell, who also coached the Raiders from 1989
to 1994. Shell made it through one season the second time around,
overseeing the most dismal season in Davis’s years with the team. Those
Raiders were 2-14 and finished dead last in the league in total yards
gained and points scored, and by season’s end Shell, convinced that a
Raiders’ executive was undermining his standing with Davis, was making
cryptic references to a “fox in the chicken coop.” An assistant coach
offered to fight players on the sideline.

This is the Raiders’ baroque period. “They’re like North Korea,” one
rival team official told me. “They’re in the community of nations, but
they’re kind of not.” The same official added that the Raiders are the
only business that has ever said no when he called and asked to leave a
message. The team and its owner have long been mysterious (one of
Davis’s players once compared him to Greta Garbo), but the lengthy
silences were taken to mean that Davis was concocting some ingenious
scheme — a new offense, a surprise draft choice, even moving the whole
team to Los Angeles, which he did in 1982 for 13 years and has
threatened to do again.

Now the silences seem to indicate something else.

Football men are Naturally paranoid creatures, and because Davis has
little life outside football, he maintains a wariness even in his
private exchanges. “What he decides to let you see is what you get,”
says Gene Upshaw, a former guard with the Raiders who is now the
executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association. “He’s not going to
let many people inside his head, his brain, his thinking, his
philosophy. He’s just going to do what he does, and you just accept it
and move on.” Upshaw suspects, but cannot exactly confirm, that on a few
recent occasions Davis asked him to be general manager of the Raiders.
Davis would call Upshaw and say, “I don’t know what I’m going to do” or
“I don’t have anyone to run this club.” But he never said, “Gene, please
come be my general manager,” and Upshaw figures this is a purposeful
omission, designed to allow Davis to maintain a plausible deniability.

Omission is one of Davis’s favorite strategies — he lets others fill in
the blanks. Since his health keeps him away from the field during
practices, Davis frequents a small room in the Raiders’ headquarters in
Alameda, south of Oakland, where he spends hours pouring over “cutups,”
quick snatches of video that show every play from the previous week’s
game. If Davis crosses paths with an assistant coach, he’ll stop him and
ask a purposefully hazy question: “Say, how did that kid beat us across
the middle?” The coach will begin nervously scanning his visual memory
for the one play that Davis is talking about. He is wary of Davis’s
temper and humbled by his football knowledge, which despite his age
remains unparalleled. If he gives the correct answer — the safety took a
bad angle, say — Davis will never mention the matter again. If the
assistant tries to fool him, Davis will never let him forget it.

What Davis’s friends would most like to hear from him is what’s wrong
with his health. Last year, the Raiders installed a special elevator in
McAfee Coliseum, where they play, so that Davis could get to the owner’s
box without climbing any stairs. But Davis insists his health is fine
except for a bum quadriceps. “I’ve known him since I was 17, and he’s
never going to admit that he feels bad,” says Paul Maguire, an ESPN
football announcer and former player, who met Davis in 1955. “If you ask
him how he’s feeling, he’ll say, ‘My team’s not doing well.’ That
concerns him more than any ailment he might have.”

Davis’s inner circle, a small, football-centric group, includes three
former Raiders and members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Jim Otto, a
center who played 15 seasons; Ted Hendricks, a 6-foot-7 outside
linebacker known as the Mad Stork; and George Blanda, who provided
superb backup quarterback play and field-goal kicking until the
outlandish age of 48. Davis has enormous affection for these men and
invariably links his favorite adjective, great, to their names — as in
“the great Jim Otto.” Until a few years ago, Otto and Blanda and
Hendricks could often be seen on the field at games flanking their
paterfamilias like some kind of Praetorian Guard.

These days, the former Raiders are, like Davis, considerably more frail
— Otto has had 28 knee surgeries and recently had one of his legs
amputated. When in town, they often join Davis to watch the Raiders play
from the owner’s suite. Here, there is a certain decorum. The ex-Raiders
may pipe up to interject an opinion now and again, but if the team is
losing, the three of them will sit silently while Davis stews. “It was a
long year last year,” Hendricks says. During a Raiders loss, the only
noise in Davis’s suite is a fus illade of insults after nearly every
play. Offense has always been his primary interest, and when the Raiders
aren’t throwing long — “attacking,” as Davis likes to say — he has been
known to dispatch the great Jim Otto to visit with the Raiders’
assistant coaches and, as Otto puts it, “remind them of something that’s
going on down on the field.”

The Saturday night dinners Davis gives before road games have a more
jovial feel. Otto, Hendricks and Blanda are often there, joined by
Davis’s friend Dr. Robert Albo; his brother, Jerry; and their wives,
including Davis’s wife of nearly 53 years, Carol, whom he calls
“Car-OH-lee.” Unusual for Davis, there is not a word of football
discussed. More recently, Davis has also discouraged the discussion of
politics, owing to tense arguments that Hendricks says predate the
current Bush administration. Davis never drinks alcohol, but he’s a
lively host, and the conversation hops from military history to women’s
basketball to one of Davis’s secret passions, music. Among the many
friends Davis has eulogized over the years are the jazz singers Sarah
Vaughn and Billy Eckstine. The eulogy is one of Davis’s best mediums —
he is sweet and often funny, even for those with whom he crossed swords.

“Get a good picture, please — I want everyone to know I’m alive.” That
was Davis’s unusual request last December, after he made his way into
the Raiders’ locker room following a sloppy, turnover-filled loss to the
St. Louis Rams.

As this and his proof-of-life moment in Phoenix demonstrate, death has
been on Davis’s mind quite a lot lately. It fascinates and confounds
him. “It’s the only thing that I don’t think I’ve licked in my life,” he
says in an ESPN documentary that aired in 2003. “I wasn’t able to save
some people who were dying.” When Davis’s loved ones fall ill, he snaps
into action: former Raiders like Willie Brown are dispatched to deliver
checks to cover medical expenses, airplanes are commandeered to whisk
the sick to distant hospitals — anything to keep friends and former
players alive.

Davis credits his steadfast bedside vigil with helping Carol recover
from a heart attack she suffered in 1979. When a Raiders employee named
Del Courtney contracted Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare disease that can
cause complete muscular paralysis, in 1971, Davis would stand next to
him and say, “You’re a Raider, and Raiders don’t die.” (Courtney made a
miraculous recovery.) But even with his interventions there have been
the inevitable disappointments: the death of former Raiders like John
Matuszak, who died of heart failure in 1989; Lyle Alzado, who succumbed
to cancer in 1992; and more recently, Bill Walsh, who coached with the
Raiders for one season and whom Davis visited two days before he died
this summer. When we met in Phoenix, Davis was still reeling from the
deaths of Ernie Ladd and Ernie Wright, whom he coached as an assistant
with the American Football League’s Chargers in the 1960s.

Lately, Davis has reached beyond his inner circle to talk about matters
of mortality. Last year, he called Jack Kemp, whom he met when they were
with the Chargers — Kemp as quarterback and Davis as wide receivers
coach. Kemp had been busy writing op-eds calling for the abolition of
the estate tax, which his fellow Republicans often refer to as the
“death tax.” “Al called me when he read one of my articles,” Kemp told
me, “and he said that I was right, and that he was calling to say he
supported tax reform and putting an end to the so-called death tax.”
Davis was not putting his own affairs in order, he assured Kemp; he said
he was looking out for his African-American players who were the first
in their families to earn big money. Kemp hadn’t heard much from Davis
in recent years, but he was giddy over the endorsement. “I think Al’s a
good old-fashioned Hubert Humphrey Democrat, and I’m a Ronald Reagan
Republican, and here we were in solid agreement,” he says.

Another recent Davis confidant is Bill Romanowski, the All-Pro
linebacker who played his final two seasons in Oakland. After suffering
more than 20 concussions in his playing career, Romo, as he’s known, set
about creating a “brain fuel” that would restore his mental powers.
(That Romanowski was considered one of the N.F.L.’s dirtiest players
makes you wonder whether this was a good idea.) Romo dubbed his brain
fuel Neuro1 and now markets it as an elixir to help you “confidently
recall names and facts” and to “enhance one’s quality of life and
performance.” Feeling fully revitalized, Romanowski recently called his
former employer and said, “Mr. Davis, I think I can change your life!”
Davis summoned Romanowski to Oakland, and now, Romanowski says, he
visits Davis three or four times a year to discuss nutrition. When I
asked if Neuro1 had enhanced Davis’s mental acuity, Romanowski paused
and then said, “Well, you talked to him, didn’t you?”

Davis’s football intelligence was never so much a matter of x’s and o’s
as a cultural consciousness that Davis has called his “gestalt.” The
Raiders were a peculiar mixture of Davis’s desires. Well into the 1960s
and ’70s, pro football retained a militaristic snap. George Plimpton,
the journalist and erstwhile quarterback, wrote that the ’60s were “so
violent that it is impossible to accept the metaphor of football, and
its popularity, without wondering whether it reflects some of the
country’s excesses.” As a student of foreign affairs going back to the
Third Reich, Davis plundered the association with gusto. For years, the
game-day schedule he distributed to the team listed 1 o’clock — game
time — as “We go to war!” Military metaphors abounded: the N.F.L.-
A.F.L. merger of 1970, which Davis initially opposed, reminded him of
the agreement at Yalta; he issued statements like “The guerrilla wins if
he doesn’t lose.” Howie Long, a defensive end who studied history at
Villanova, found that after his indoctrination with Davis he began
imagining the team’s practice center in Alameda as a fortress city in
the hills of Cortona, something to be defended at all costs.

But the hard line Davis took in metaphor disguised a more liberal heart,
an almost tender inclusiveness. What we tend to remember as the bad-boy
Oakland Raiders — the “mélange of odds and ends, oddities and
irregulars, factory seconds and seeming chain-gang escapees,” as the
writer Mark Ribowsky put it — was in fact an early template for modern
professional football. It is well known that Davis provided feed and
care to troubled souls like Alzado and Matuszak. It is less well known
that Davis was among the first wave of owners to scout the historically
black colleges, from which he pulled, for example Art Shell, the rumbler
on the left side of his offensive line. Davis could look at a castoff
and see a future star, like Jim Plunkett, who had been cut by the San
Francisco Forty-Niners, or Todd Christensen, a washed-up fullback whom
Davis converted into a rangy tight end. If Davis was more paranoid and
combative than other owners — he has sued the N.F.L. numerous times —
his players looked upon him as unconcerned with reputation or
conventional wisdom. “The truth of it is I’d been cut twice and had
tryouts for four teams,” Todd Christensen told me, “so he could have
been Khameini or Osama bin Laden for all I cared.”

The mix the Raiders achieved was revolutionary, and Davis managed a
number of historic firsts. He became the first owner to draft an
African-American quarterback in the first round, Eldridge Dickey, way
back in 1968. He made Art Shell the first African-American head coach in
the modern era; he made Tom Flores the first Hispanic coach. Amy Trask
is the first woman to serve as chief executive of an N.F.L. team. In the
1960s, Davis moved two games out of segregated cities in the deep South
when he learned the stands and local hotels would be segregated. “I just
think he is absolutely unencumbered by prejudice of any type,” Trask says.

Davis wasn’t simply attempting a demographic shift but wholesale
behavioral modification. In the 1970s, some N.F.L. teams were still
enforcing a ludicrous, top-down propriety — the rival Kansas City
Chiefs, for example, required players to wear red blazers when they
traveled together. The Raiders would have none of it. “These are the
greatest athletes in the world,” John Madden once said. “They’re like
artists. And if you take their creativity away from them by making them
robotic, then they’re going to play like robots.”

The Raiders’ ethic was organic and bottom-up. Sometime in the 1970s, Jim
Plunkett and Fred Biletnikoff began sitting on their helmets during
practice. There was nothing particularly special about sitting on your
helmet other than most other teams in the league wouldn’t let you do it,
and for the player it conveyed a certain psychic benefit.

The Raiders’ idea of a mandatory team function was “Camaraderie,” a
Thursday-night drinking session masterminded by some of the more
intimidating members of the offensive and defensive lines. (At Super
Bowl XV in New Orleans, in 1981, the Raiders moved Camaraderie to the
French Quarter, and they encircled and shared liter-size Hurricanes as
if they were standing in a huddle.) The Raiders were not unfamiliar with
Northern California’s counterculture scene. Linebacker Chip Oliver left
the team to live in a commune. Linebacker Phil Villapiano was beaten
senseless by a group of Hell’s Angels in a bar fight. Gene Upshaw
kibitzed with Bobby Seale, Huey Newton and other members of the Black
Panthers at one of Upshaw’s Oakland bars. Seale and Newton, Upshaw says,
were Raiders fans, because they admired the team’s fierce sense of loyalty.

Indeed, it is tempting to regard the team Davis cobbled together as the
N.F.L.’s first radical political organization, with a militant ethos and
an open-minded approach toward membership. “Al always felt the enormity
of the Raiders, the mystique of the Raiders, could control players,
because players wanted to fit into that mystique,” Steve Ortmayer says.
A more conventional owner might have insisted on a few nods to decorum:
coats and ties on the team plane, no fraternizing with the Panthers. But
Davis’s refusal to commit to a moral code other than “just win, baby”
helped him juggle all the heterogeneity. Excluding anyone on the basis
of race or attitude might cost him a player and give another owner an
edge. Davis had an expansive vision of what could make a football team.
What other teams craved, the Raiders had in spades: camaraderie.

What changed was not so much Davis losing his touch as the rest of the
league catching up. Two events leveled the playing field. One was the
N.F.L.’s belated adoption of more expansive free agency and a salary cap
in 1993. As Ortmayer puts it, this was a problem “because it broke down
the ability of Al to run the operation totally as a family.” Suddenly
the Raiders’ camaraderie had less appeal than the big contract. The
other change was that the N.F.L. became more like the Raiders. The
N.F.L. now has African-American coaches like Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith
and African-American quarterbacks like Steve McNair and Vince Young. The
remnants of faux-military culture have given way to a relaxed atmosphere
that can accommodate even those players with “attitude” problems. Randy
Moss, whom the Raiders acquired from Minnesota in 2005, quit on the team
last season; he suggested in a radio interview, unwisely but perhaps not
incorrectly, that “there’s a lot of funny things going on around here in
this organization.” When the Raiders traded Moss to New England this
spring, it was a measure of how the N.F.L. has evolved that the wonkish
and corporate Patriots, rather than the Raiders, were thought to provide
a nurturing environment in which a provocateur like Moss could flourish.

Davis’s cultural innovations had been integrated into the N.F.L.’s
mother brain. And thanks to further measures like harsh punishments for
on- and off-the-field transgressions, the league has entered a period
where there’s very little cultural difference between the franchises.
“The gap between the smartest owner and the dumbest owner is much
narrower than it was a generation ago,” says Michael MacCambridge, the
author of “America’s Game,” a history of professional football. This
change has proved beneficial for historically benighted franchises like
the Arizona Cardinals and disastrous for once-smart franchises like the
Raiders. As the new century approached, and the Raiders hadn’t won a
Super Bowl since 1984, they had the desperate look of every other
mediocre N.F.L. franchise. All that remained of personality-driven
football were Davis’s quirks.

Not long ago, I called Rich Gannon, the quarterback who led the Raiders
to the Super Bowl in 2003, and asked him to explain Davis’s management
style. “He’s a complicated guy,” Gannon said. “I think he’s
misunderstood at times, and other times people’s interpretations and
impressions are fairly accurate.” When Gannon came to Oakland in 1999,
the Raiders were already sliding into mediocrity. Davis had let his
personality run wild; he was on his third head coach in five seasons;
the Raiders’ players were teetering on the edge of revolt. “Guys coming
in 5, 10 minutes late to the practice field without their jerseys on,”
Gannon recalled. “Players that had total disrespect for the coaches and
the other players. Just a sick, sick, debilitating environment to work in.”

Davis was still practicing personality-driven football, but in impatient
rather than visionary mode. This affected his coaches most
conspicuously. In 1998, Davis hired Jon Gruden, who was 34, to be head
coach. Along with personnel man Bruce Allen and offensive coordinator
Bill Callahan, Gruden began the slow process of restoring order to the
Raiders by adding battle-tested veterans: Gannon, Charlie Garner and
Jerry Rice. But Davis clashed with Gruden over his contract and, in a
huff, allowed him to leave for Tampa Bay in 2002; Allen followed Gruden
a season later; Callahan led the Raiders to the 2003 Super Bowl, lost to
Gruden’s Buccaneers and was fired a year later. In one swift stroke, all
the people who had returned the Raiders to respectability — who had
brought the kind of fresh ideas that smoothed the rough edges of Davis’s
personality — had vanished. That left only Davis. “Look what’s happened
since then,” Gannon told me. “They’ve had the worst record in the N.F.L.
over the last four years. Last year — that was a travesty.” He added,
“You could have brought in Tom Landry or Vince Lombardi and it wouldn’t
have made any difference.”

Landry and Lombardi being unavailable, last winter Davis turned to Lane
Kiffin, an offensive coordinator at the University of Southern
California. (Strangely, Davis had first interviewed Steve Sarkisian,
another U.S.C. coach; Sarkisian reportedly turned down the job, though
the Raiders claim it was never offered to him.) Kiffin is a boyish 32,
two years younger than the Raiders’ defensive tackle Warren Sapp. When
Kiffin interviewed with Davis late one night in January, the old owner
dazzled his young pupil by reeling off the precise heights, weights and
40-yard-dash times of prospects going back decades. When I met up with
Kiffin a few months later, he was still giddy in telling the story.
“Imagine you’re interviewing with an owner who’s been a great coach as
well, who’s already in the Hall of Fame,” Kiffin said. “He’s not just
managing the team interview. This is about x’s and o’s, coaches,
play-calling, everything, because he knows it all.”

Far from a naïf, however, Kiffin has so far proved to be a capable
bureaucratic infighter. The Raiders had the No. 1 choice in April’s
draft, and Davis is credited with selecting JaMarcus Russell, the
fiercely large quarterback from Louisiana State University. (At the end
of July, Russell still had not signed with the Raiders, and the team
signed Daunte Culpepper to compete for the starting job.) But Oakland’s
boldest off-season move, credited to Kiffin, was to trade Moss to New
England for two players and a draft choice. Kiffin installed Mark
Jackson, an associate from U.S.C., as director of football development,
and he moved Robert Gallery, a former high pick, from offensive right
tackle, where Davis reportedly wanted him, to left guard. Kiffin is
thoroughly unmoved by Davis’s “just win, baby” propaganda. “Obviously,
there’s an unbelievable tradition and history there,” Kiffin told me.
“But over the course of time, things change. It’s an organization that’s
fallen on hard times lately. It’s no secret — he realizes that.”

Though he talks to Kiffin on the phone every day, Davis has shown signs
of receding in recent years. One agent told me that last season he never
spoke to Davis in the course of contract negotiations; a former
assistant coach told me Davis had minimal, if any, input into the game
plans. Davis has even become something of a league man. A persistent
noodge to Pete Rozelle (who called Davis a “charming rogue”), Davis
rallied owners last spring to approve an extension to the collective
bargaining agreement. Paul Tagliabue, the departing commissioner,
appointed Davis to the committee to select his successor. Davis even
gave up his longstanding suit against Alameda County, which for a time
controlled the sale of Raiders tickets.

Davis is the team’s titular head, and will be as long he’s alive, but
the team is no longer a revolutionary force. Last season, friends
report, you could see the pain on his face — clearly, the old methods
weren’t working. Tom Flores, who coached the Raiders to two Super Bowl
titles in the 1980s, visited Davis in May and found him blaming himself
for the Raiders’ recent frustrations. “I think he realizes he’s not 57
years old,” Flores says. “He wants to do this and get it done as quickly
as possible. But he knows it can’t be done overnight.”

“He feels like he wants to do more,” Bill Parcells, another longtime
Davis friend, says. “I just hope time doesn’t run out, you know?”

“Huddle-huddle-huddle-huddle!” Part of Lane Kiffin’s plan to revitalize
the Raiders is to make the team’s training camp in Napa Valley a bastion
of positive reinforcement. When I visited one afternoon, Kiffin was
making his way through the ranks and tossing footballs to unsuspecting
defensive tackles. When he flipped one to Warren Sapp, who checked into
camp at a svelte 282 pounds, Kiffin said, “He’s lost weight and he’s
working on his hands!” Sapp replied, “I’ve had these since I was 5,
Coach!” Even beyond the usual optimism at the start of training camp, a
new friskiness prevailed. When the Raiders lined up to run a play,
Kiffin’s assistants gathered behind the line of scrimmage. As soon as
the play was over, they ran up like expectant stage moms to congratulate
the players.

Davis was not in Napa that day — or given his ability to transcend time
and space, perhaps he was. The reliably surrealistic Raiders press
department would neither confirm nor deny his presence in Napa or
Oakland or anywhere else. (He showed up on the practice field the next
day.) Davis had once been an omnipresent figure at these practices. Gene
Upshaw remembers how, when he was still playing, he would see Davis
lurking behind him as he was about to run a play; and then, after
running it, he’d see Davis clear across the field; and then, after
running another play, Upshaw would look up and there was Davis standing
right behind him again — Davis had covered the field faster than Lester
Hayes! “Every day I go on the football field I think about him,” Willie
Brown, now an assistant coach with the team, told me.

If any Raider in Napa seemed linked intellectually to Davis’s old Raider
irregulars, it was Jerry Porter, who, with the departure of Randy Moss,
has become the Raiders’ best and most mercurial wideout. Last year,
after a feud with Art Shell, Porter showed up in Napa wearing a
professional wrestling belt and a T-shirt featuring an extended middle
finger. Shell would later suspend Porter for four games for
insubordination after Porter yelled at him during a practice; according
to a report in the San Francisco Chronicle, Porter also availed himself
of Al Davis’s private parking space. In Napa, Porter was claiming
selective amnesia (“I don’t remember last year,” he said), making a
series of leaping catches and periodically throwing a penalty flag to
entertain his teammates.

I pulled Porter aside after practice and asked him what it was like to
play for Al Davis. He shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t necessarily play
for Al,” he said. Say again? “I said I don’t necessarily play for Al,”
Porter said. “Al’s not our coach.”

Even so, I said, between the Raider mystique, the five Super Bowls and
“just win, baby,” the Davis legend, if not Davis himself, must surely
permeate the Raiders’ facilities. “No, you see him in passing,” Porter
said. “We have a good back-and-forth conversation of about 20 words, and
we’re on our way.” And what wisdom did Davis, the aficionado of the
long-bomb passing game, impart? Porter was hard-pressed to recall
anything specific. “Something about football,” he said.

This is the post-Davis Raiders. A team with its own quirks, coaches and
vision, but without the considerable imprint of its owner. Through the
ministrations of Dr. Romanowski, Davis may be able to emerge every now
and then to declare that reports of his death are greatly exaggerated.
Lane Kiffin may succeed in reversing the embarrassments of the last four
seasons. But Davis’s personality-driven football is dead. Jerry Porter
delivered the eulogy, without malice: “The Raider mystique does not
exist anymore.” .
