I'm currently moving objects using PivotJoint like in demo project. Is
it possible by applying more than one PivotJoint to scale (make it
bigger/smaller) the body?

If you are asking if a joint can change the shape of an Body the
answer is no. This is a rigid body engine. That means that a body will
not deform no matter how much force is applied to it.

Is it possible to change the size manualy in code (not with joint)?

You can also use the Body.Transformation property.

How can I get Joints associated with a Body? I have found only count
of joints.

You can loop though all the joints in the engine and search the
Joint.Bodies property.

I have seen that Joint makes jointCount++ and -- for it Bodies. It
could make joints.Add(this) instead ;)
