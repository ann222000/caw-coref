They say this is the computer age. PAH!
They're still slow, error-ridden and
inconvenient pieces of fragile junk.

Someday people will look back at things
like having to wait several minutes to restart a
computer to clear an error, or load a program
and snicker in disbelief and ridicule.
"How could we live like that", they'll
wonder.

Still an entire corner of the room chock full of cables
and power sticks and this and that, constant memory
shortages, hard discs that are too small, one
compatibiliity problem after another...viruses and trojans
and...christ I have to adjust three different
volume controls to listen to tv on my computer.
Forget trying to record tv to the hard drive, it'd fill up
in minutes.  And still with dsl we have  to download
these small grainy and fuzzy porn videos
that look blocky and tend to start and stop
whenever they damn well feel like it.

I mean when will computers not force us to chose
between storing all the porn, video and music
we want? No way all three are fitting into one
computer.

And scan discs and defrags and adware cleaners and
registry fixers and a hundred more.

How can we live like this!!!!!!!!

No laptops - nanobots inside you.

"FleshWire #101, June 13, 2066.

After repeated delays and several alleged fatalities among beta-
testers NanoSoft(R) released their new Neuralizer(tm) SO last week.
The program includes several ground breaking features, such as
RapiDetox, ViviDream and PerfectMem.
Accordig to NS CEO, overdoses whith any LEGAL drugs are a thing of the
past. Law enforcement agencies are also said to be pleased with the
new software. Sources have revealed that, in compliance with last
year's Clean-Ur-Act Act, Neuralizer(tm) immobilizes the user and
alerts the authorities if THC is detected in the blood stream. Several
civil rights groups contend that Neuralizer(tm) does more than that
and will contact DEA if it detects THC in nearby persons.
OUR ADVICE: Don't go near potheads until the FOIA request for Nationa
Security Embedded Features for Neuralizer(tm) comes out.

Security should be better than that of previous wetware, but there is
a price to pay. ViviDream won't allow you to share unlicensed sim-
stims. That could affect the sales since Hi5 (the ubiquitous porn
sharing protocol) is not supported.
To date only one virus is known. The GOP mal-aware is designed to
arouse the user if certain words and phrases are heard. Among these,
several republican presidents of the 20th and 21st century, Pat
Robertson, preemptive strike, Monroe Doctrine, Ronald MacDonald and
the songs Dixie's Land and Let's Roll. Should be noted that the
"Richard Nixon" trigger has the lowest treshold - sometimes just Nixon
triggers the virus. Effects can be especially enbarrasing for men but
they subside in minutes (GOP is a MOM*).
OUR ASSESMENT:The GOP is not particularly dangerous and can be easily
avouded if you do not enter real-time VR/sim-stim political debate
environments.

PerfectMem is here at last.
'The IQ tool' as it's been touted by NanoSoft(R) is indeed a really
neat piece of wetware. It will help you remember all those pesky grad
school texts and your girfriend's birthday. However, we suggest that
you don't overdo it. Keeping more than 7 exaqubits in the QRB** can
lead to random access of main behavioural markers (such as your
botched first date and the death of your dog).

Back when we had Macs at work, they were only used by the secretaries and
upper management.  Now we're all PC's.  But since they've released the new
Intel based Macs, we port our software to Mac, so "real engineers" can now
run our software on a Mac, if they really want to.

I still work in the same building, on the same floor, for nearly 17 years

In my opinion, Windows didn't become "usable" until Windows 3.1.  I ran that
for years before I jumped straight to Win98SE.  I then ran that for years
until I jumped to WinXPSR2.  My thought is that I never want to use any
"next generation" OS until the second maintenance release comes out.  ;-)

My company, UGS, ports its CAD/CAM/CAE software to Macs running Intel
hardware.  Even though I don't know all the details, I understand it wasn't
that hard since the core of their new OS is very Unix like.

Except for the porting platforms.  We'll port to anything reasonable that
our customers require, including Macs running with Intel CPU's.  ;-)

That would explain it.  We had previously ported to certain flavors of Linux
running on Intel hardware.  I never remember all the platforms we port to,
since I spend most of my time on Win32 with a bit of time spent on Win64 and
Sun (Solaris).

It was real. The canopy release mechanism when kaput, and they had to

It's "very Unix like" because it's BSD Unix with some Mach bits thrown
in.  Go under the eye candy and pretty much anything written for
Berkeley Unix will compile and run on it.

I believe there's someone around here who used to have a .sig that
said something to the effect that ever since Unix was invented a lot
of people had expended a lot of effort reinventing it poorly...

Coincidentally, that's almost verbatim - the last bit about it should
learn us, not we learn it - that the OpenMoko people have been pushing.
http://www.openmoko.org/ - It's a project to design an opensource phone,
in partnership with a large chinese phone maker.
First hardware for sale for $350 later this month.

Their ideal is for all phones to run this freely available OS, and you
can install whatever apps you like.

However.
The problem with 'one big computer' is that there is simply not enough
bandwidth in the spectrum to talk wirelessly to it.

Excessive integration.

I can understand, just about, how a navigation system would come unstuck
with it reaches 180 degrees from its reference point (which I'm assuming
is the Greenwhich meridian), which happens to be where *most* of the
international date line is. Such a system should be uninterested in the
actual date.

But comms and fuel management?
