WHAT OTHERS THINK OF ........

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF ARIANS

ARIES : They are extremely headstrong and listen to no reason. They fail to
see the other person's point of view. They can be inconsiderate and
ruthless. If only they could curb their hot temper, we could live tolerably
together.

TAURUS : They are a bit too flamboyant for my liking. But I appreciate their
truthfulness and sincerity. In love, they are inconsistent.

GEMINI : They are innocent and likeable. I like their fire and dash. We make
good friends. But in love, they are too intellectual and logical; and in
sex, too disciplined to suit my taste.

CANCER : They are not serious. They hardly understand the deeper side of
life. They are superficial, a flirtatious lot. They talk of ethics and
discipline, but lack both. I don't like them.

LEO : Arians are great. It's good to be in love with an Arian. But though
they pay you plenty of compliments, they are not generous with gifts or
presents. But the way they pamper me, compensates for all their
shortcomings. I like their disciplined life style.

VIRGO : Arians are futile idealists. They waste their time in theorising.
How can I like people who do not believe in a secure life? They leave
everything to chance, and do not like to plan their future. Associating with
such people is fraught with danger.

LIBRA : Arians seek to make an impression and, of course, they generally
succeed. They appreciate art, and understand my views on life. They are
romantic and match my own sex drive. I would love to marry an Arian.

SCORPIO : They stimulate my interest, but their lack of consistency drives
me almost crazy. I have always failed to hold onto them, much as I would
like to. They lack purpose in life, changing from one thing or one partner
to another. They could work wonders, if only they stuck to one thing at a
time.

SAGITTARIUS : Arians attract me. Their intellect and optimism are inspiring.
They are good friends and never let me down in times of need. They add
colour to any occasion and they are intensely romantic. I can't help falling
in love with such fiery people.

CAPRICORN : They scorn materialism, and that is an unrealistic approach to
life. It's understandable if they dislike security, as they put it; but an
utter disregard of normal conventions makes them immature. I cannot like
such people.

AQUARIUS : We are great friends. But the Arian philosophy of life is more
intellectual than spiritual, and I do not appreciate that. They make good
love-partners, but lack depth and finesse. And in matters of sex they can be
impatient, too 'physical', I would say. But nevertheless I love them.

PISCES : If only I could attract an Arian my love-life could become
interesting. But we are opposites. They are out-going while I like solitude.
I seek them only when I feel depressed and dull, otherwise I keep them at a
distance. I cannot tolerate their temper.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF TAUREANS

ARIES: They are friendly, dependable, but too methodical for my liking. They
are so formal in their love-relationships that they cause unnecessary delay
in arriving at a mutual understanding.

TAURUS: They are suspicious of others and suffer from an insecurity complex.
If they overcome this trait and do not interfere in my personal and private
activities, I would like to associate with them.

GEMINI: I hardly get on with Taureans. They think of me as a superficial
type, and are also critical of my sex-life. But I must say they admire my
artistic traits.

CANCER: We are good friends. They are deep thinkers and good judges of
characters. I like their loyalty towards friends, and their quality of
always being helpful in time of need.

LEO: They are a bit of a bore. They are sincere, honest and loyal, but too
straight-forward and simple. They are good in a love-relationship, but it
takes a lot of time to cultivate them.

VIRGO: We get along very well. They understand my views on life. Their
artistic bent of my mind lends them a strange aura of charm. They live with
good taste, though simply. I like them.

LIBRA: I have come across a number of Taureans, and I find them warm and
affectionate. But somehow we have not been able to strike a not of intimacy.
It may perhaps be my fault. I lead a bit of a fast life, which they do not
like.

SCORPIO: Their consistent attitude attracts me. They are good lovers and
make compatible sex-partners. I am attracted by their strong, deep,
passionate nature and their penchant for things beautiful. The powerful way
they hold and touch you is pleasantly exciting. I could have an enduring
love-relationship with them.

SAGITTARIUS: I do not get on with them. They are so vindictive and resentful
about my way of life. I cannot communicate with them. I wonder how even
people with artistic traits could be so self-centered.

CAPRICORN: I am in love with Taurean. They have achieved a happy blend of
artistic and physical reality. They are not idle idealists. We have a lot in
common and we respect each other's views. And they certainly know the art of
love.

AQUARIUS: They believe in the world of form, and I like to dwell upon the
formless. Though they respect my spiritual approach to life, I find them too
earthy and physical. They may be artistic, but they lack refinement in
matters of sex and love.

PISCES: I find them quite loveable. They respect tradition and conventional
in their approach to life; that makes them dependable and sincere. They are
exciting lovers and can keep me pleasantly satisfied.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF GEMINIANS

ARIES: They are intelligent and highly understanding; I like their easy
manners. They are good friends, for they don't bore you with problems or
family wrangles. They make pleasant companions and witty conversationalists.

TAURUS: They may be popular, but I don't like their flirtatious outlook.
They are so immodest in the way they dress and they have no respect for
conventions. Their friendships is superficial and makes me doubt their
sincerity. I cannot trust them in matters of love.

GEMINI: Once they are really and truly in love, they could make devoted
partners. They wish to do too many things at a time, which he makes them
inconsistent in their careers. Nevertheless, they are good companions.

CANCER: A talkative lot. Pretentious and self centered. They pay far too
much importance to outward appearances. No depth. I can never get along with
them.

LEO: Good entertainers, they are very sociable. Only, at time, their
behavior in large gatherings shock me - they don't care for anything or for
any person, and stick to their own convictions. But they are quite friendly
towards me.

VIRGO: They are real Casanovas. Although they may be fun as acquaintances,
they are a bit rowdy and loud. If you begin to be intimate with them with
the idea of marriage in mind, you are sure to suffer a nervous breakdown!

LIBRA: I like them. They are so natural and easy in their approach. They
dress stylishly and I like their choice of colours. As lovers of art and the
theater, they make pleasant companions.

SCORPIO: They are mere talkers, and they think that they know everything.
But I think they are nuts! They lack proper discipline - in everything. I
wonder how they manage to have so many love affairs. But then, their
involvements are just fleeting and temporary.

SAGITTARIUS: Great lovers: can't resist them! They make sex more interesting
by talking about it. They are always the centre of attraction, especially at
parties. Just knowing them is an exciting experience. I would happily marry
one of them.

CAPRICORN: They risk everything in experimenting with new ideas. This could
be disastrous. If they were more cautious they would be more successful in
life. In love and sex, too, they lack prudence.

AQUARIUS: Their desire to know and understand the meaning of life, attracts
me. Though they are thinkers, they respond favourably to things beautiful
and artistic. I love them.

PISCES: Somehow we never get along. They devote so much time to frivolities,
and don't try to cultivate deep attachments with anybody. That is why, in
spite of their large number of acquaintances, they have only a few friends,
perhaps none. Their approach to love and sex is scandalous!

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF CANCERIANS

ARIES: They baffle me, they are so prosaic and physical. They have no
interest in intellectual matters. Though they can make good friends, their
emotional insecurity scares me. I feel they would bind me to a conventional
life.

TAURUS: They are people of deep understanding. Sincere in friendship,
trustworthy in love. They would rather hurt themselves than cause
unhappiness to others. I like them.

GEMINI: They are impossible - too slow and dull. They call me names and
think I am a flirt. But I think that they are self-centred, ambitious and
jealous.

CANCER: If they overcome their lethargy we could establish good
understanding between ourselves. But love is a different matter. Somehow
their career seems to be more important than any relationship with others.

LEO: Their tendency to cling frightens me. And they take too much interest
in mundane affairs. Their outlook is rather commonplace and matter-of-fact.
They mean no harm, I agree; but somehow we are very different types.

VIRGO: They are all right. We are quite friendly. So what if we take pains
to establish our careers? After all, that's the way of the world. I find
them loyal and faithful.

LIBRA: Physically, they attract me. But somehow they keep me at arm's
length. I like to attend their parties - they serve good food! But we don't
really click.

SCORPIO: Great friends! Ardent and faithful as lovers. I like their physical
strength - and their prowess in the art of love. They respond well to my
aggressive nature. We get on well.

SAGITTARIUS: They are reserved and aloof. All my efforts to establish a more
intimate relationship with them, are in vain. They are very choosy about
whom they go about with, very clannish and sectarian. I don't like them.

CAPRICORN: Generous and kind-hearted, they give complete freedom to their
partners. Their views on love and sex are clear and uncomplicated. We have
great rapport with each other. I love them. Ours is a happy marriage.

AQUARIUS: They never discuss philosophy or take an interest in spiritual
matters. Though they have good taste in dress and live in style, they are
not artistic enough for me. Their views on life are too conventional and
traditional. They lack finesse in matters of love and sex.

PISCES: We are good friends. I find them sympathetic and sincere. They love
home-life. They have great depth of character, but are charmingly modest
about their achievements. We like each other and get along marvelously.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF LEOS

ARIES: Lively and pleasant, they are the very picture of romance. I like
them for their uncomplaining nature. They are great lovers too. They give
complete freedom to their partners.

TAURUS: They are a little too proud of themselves - and it shows in their
slowly life-style. But I do appreciate their respect for tradition. However,
they don't take a steady stand in matters of love and sex, so their
love-life is erratic.

GEMINI: They are romantic. Well-groomed and cultured. I like their dignified
composure and regal bearing. We are good friends. Only I avoid getting into
an argument with them; I think they are right in their beliefs.

CANCER: They imagine themselves to be righteous all the time. They lecture
people on traditions as if they were authorities on the subject. I don't
like them. They are too loud and full of airs.

LEO: They flatter themselves too much. Egoists. If they tone down a bit and
think of others as equals. We can get along well, no doubt.

VIRGO: They make a big show of their worldly possessions. I think they are
full of conceit. They are so dogmatic. I cannot get on with them. They play
around in love and come out with lectures on morality.

LIBRA: They are full of life and vitality. I love Leo natives. So true and
honest in friendship. And fine sex -partners too. Trust a Leo in time of
needs.

SCORPIO: They are loud-mouthed, and talk nonsense. They are lucky in worldly
success. But so mediocre in matters of sex. I grant that they are sincere,
but too choosy about friends. Perhaps I am just indifferent towards them.

SAGITTARIUS: They attract me. I like their straight-forwardness. They make
good companions in love. A sexual relationship might be a bit difficult, but
that is understandable since they pay little attention to the physical side
of love.

CAPRICORN: I don't like them. They are so self-centered and dogmatic. They
always have hangers-on about them. They are a spoilt lot. Their luck in
their careers is not commensurate with their talent.

AQUARIUS: Their questionings about the material and spiritual values of life
attracts me to them. I like the way they tune their ideals to reality. They
are well-mannered, refined and tactful. I would like to have a Leo for a
life-partner.

PISCES: They pay too much attention to outward show and are far too
class-conscious. They rate everything in terms of financial success. I do
not like them. They imagine themselves to be the very centre of society,
thinking that all life will come to a standstill without them.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF VIRGOANS

ARIES: They are good -natured people, but a bit too prudent. They are always
harping on career and security, which I don't like. I am an 'outdoor' person
perhaps rather brush, whereas I find them a bit sloppy. We don't get along.

TAURUS: I admire their realistic approach to life, their practical ideas.
They are homely and sincere. Our tastes, likes and dislikes are identical.

GEMINI: Their hyper-critical nature scares me. They are so fastidious and
difficult. I wonder how people find them jovial and friendly. I don't feel
at ease in their company.

CANCER: They make loyal, steadfast friends. Quite sympathetic and
understanding. They plan their future well. I appreciate their sincerity.

LEO: Too prosaic and dull. I find their conversation inane and their company
tiresome. They are more impressed by the material possessions of an
individual than by his qualities of character.

VIRGO: No wonder they have few friends - they are perennial fault-finders.
They waste their time in meaningless entertainment and futile social
functions. In spite of all this, we do get on well.

LIBRA: They are docile and home-loving; nice, sincere types. But we are
poles apart as far as love is concerned. They aren't artistic either; too
careless and mundane. No, we don't suit each other.

SCORPIO: Good friends. I like their sense of humour. In this dull, dreary
life it is good to know persons like them. And they are thoughtful partners,
skilled in the art of love.

SAGITTARIUS: They are good as family friends. But in personal relationships,
I find it difficult to establish any rapport with them. In money matters
they are stingy, although they claim to be charitably disposed!

CAPRICORN: I find them inspiring and encouraging, devoted in love. Their
realistic approach towards sex makes a relationship easy and pleasant. I
love them.

AQUARIUS: Their realism is a bit too commonplace; they never bother to
appreciate the finer things in life. Their rather physical approach to love
baffles me. There is no meeting ground between us.

PISCES: They are faithful and dependable in friendship. Sincere in love,
they make compatible partners. They love domestic life and children. I would
be only too glad to marry a Virgoan.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF LIBRANS

ARIES: Extremely charming and pleasant, they are so understanding and
considerate. I like their out-going nature, and they appreciate my sense of
independence. I would love to marry a Libran.

TAURUS: I like their artistic traits. They are interesting companions, too.
But we don't see eye to eyes in matters of love. They are easy-going and too
indulgent about sex. At times, I am almost afraid of getting involved with
them.

GEMINI: An inspiring lot. Great lovers! But they are too frivolous sometime
- even for me. They make exciting partners. It is only the fortunate who win
the love of a Libran.

CANCER: I think they are a bit showy. Their tastes may be very refined but
their life-style is immodest. They are not steadfast and faithful in love.
Somehow we don't seem to strike a note of intimacy.

LEO: They are good friends of mine. Charming manners, artistic, pleasant to
be with. They make genial hosts. They are fine in matters of sex, though a
bit too easy-going.

VIRGO: I think they are a licentious lot. All right, so one can have a fling
or two - but their affairs seem to be endless. They are self-centered and
usually make friends only with people who can help them to fulfil their
ambitions. I don't like them.

LIBRA: They are just not serious about anything. They are merely lucky
enough to be rich and successful in th eyes of the world. But they don't
strive to achieve any goal. Still, they make adaptable partners in marriage,
which is good enough for us to be together.

SCORPIO: I find them too soft and delicate. Even in conversation, they lack
depth. They are superficial in love. Totally frivolous. I do not get on with
them.

SAGITTARIUS: Great entertainers, they make exciting, absorbing companions. I
like their taste for travel. They are good speakers, too, and the centre of
attraction wherever they go. I like their unassuming nature.

CAPRICORN: Too flamboyant for my liking. They talk too much, being
thoroughly over-confident. Pleasure-seekers, they pay more attention to
physical charm than to mental compatibility. I do not associate with them.

AQUARIUS: I can't resist their disarming smile. They are guileless and
innocent. True and sincere friends, they are also fine lovers, adept at the
art of love. I love them.

PISCES: I find them irresponsible and flippant. They socialize a bit too
much. In love and romance, too, they seek physical pleasure more than
emotional ties. They are callous in their relationships. I keep myself aloof
from them.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF SCORPIOS

ARIES: I admire their independent spirit and sense of freedom. But I think
they are too self-centered and inflexible. They dwell more on the physical
plane, weighing everything in terms of worldly success. I avoid establishing
any intimacy with them.

TAURUS: They are people of strong character. I like their confident and
forceful ways. They make good, steady partners in love and I would happily
approve of marriage with them.

GEMINI: They are difficult to get along with. Although they talk well and
have refined tastes, they remain so aloof. In love they are slow to be
aroused; I lack the patience to set them afire! They could be dangerous if
slighted.

CANCER: I appreciate their views on life. They are devoted lovers, though a
bit too aggressive. I love them. Our likes and dislikes in domestic matters,
like the choice of a home, are identical. As friends, too, they are helpful
in times of need.

LEO: They attract me, but somehow the attraction is not sustained, and does
not lead to marriage. Rather, they seem to compete with me in the
career-game. Our friendship can turn into mutual hatred. I keep them at bay.

VIRGO: Consistent in friendship and sincere in love, they are trustworthy;
you can safely confide in them without the risk of betrayal. Good judges of
character, they are impartial. I like them.

LIBRA: I like them as lovers; but it is difficult to disentangle oneself
from their love-nest. To flirt with them is to invite trouble. They are not
artistic, though I do not doubt their good taste. They are good as
acquaintances, and that is all there is to our friendship.

SCORPIO: Why can't they be more flexible in their approach? So long as you
go along with their vies, they accept you. But they do not brook criticism,
though they themselves are highly critical of others. Still, they make good
companions in life.

SAGITTARIUS: Too serious and sceptical for my liking. I do not like their
self-proclaimed 'radical' views. Their dislike of tradition or established
conventions alienates them from many. They are coarse in matters of love and
romance. We do not click.

CAPRICORN: They are persons of deep understanding and intelligence. I like
their practical approach to life. They don't delude themselves with false
utopian values. They make good partners in love.

AQUARIUS: We respect each other - but that's all! They are rational to the
point of irrationality. If they delve into mysticism or the occult, they go
to extremes. They lack finesse in thought and action.

PISCES: Enduring friends - and great lovers! They respect my views on life.
I like their courage and enthusiasm. Full of confidence, they achieve
tremendous success in their careers. I just love them.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF SAGITTARIUS

ARIES: I find them understanding and warmly affectionate. They believe in a
simple straightforward relationship and do not suffer from any complexes.
They are quite daring and enthusiastic by nature, loving freedom and
adventure. I love them.

TAURUS: I respect their conventional outlook, but I think that it is
deceptive. They have too many involvements, and are quite reckless in
anything to do with love. I find them irritable and dogmatic. We do not get
along well.

GEMINI: I like their optimism. Full of hope and enthusiasm, they inspire me
with a zest for living. They are honest and frank and rarely speak ill of
others. I would love to marry a Sagittarian.

CANCER: They think no end of themselves! Most of the time they talk about
their own achievements and desires. They show no concern for others, and are
far too self-indulgent. I do not like them.

LEO: They are hard-working and sincere. I like their purposeful approach to
life; they strive for recognition and usually succeed because of their own
merits. In love and sex they are discreet. We get along well.

VIRGO: They are too self-centered. Egoists, they talk about nothing except
their own aims and aspirations. They drown themselves in their own work and
activities, hardly devoting any time to others, not even to their families.
We cannot strike a note of mutual intimacy.

LIBRA: They are interesting people, full of life and sparkle. Good lovers
too, they make exciting partners in sex. Although they do not pay sufficient
attention to the finer things of life, I still like them for their honesty
and truthfulness.

SCORPIO: They are shallow and dull. Mere talkers, they lack depth and
understanding. They are 'weak' in sex, and too soft for my liking. Utterly
conventional in their life style and in their outlook, they bore me.

SAGITTARIUS: If they could stick to just one partner, we could get on well.
But their urge for variety in love and sex sometimes makes them wander from
one affair to another. I like their bold and frank nature and, in spite of
their other drawbacks, I love them.

CAPRICORN: I dislike their domineering attitude. They think they are masters
of every discipline. I respect their sincere approach to life, but find them
too egoistic. They cannot make intimate friends, though they claim to know a
large number of people.

AQUARIUS: Enterprising and sincere, they are persons of learning. I like
their rational approach to life, but find them neglecting artistic pursuits
completely. They dwell more on the mundane plane than on the altruistic. But
they are honest friends, and I like them for that.

PISCES: In a relationship they do not really care about the other person.
They weigh everything in terms of profit and loss, and usually associate
with those who hold high positions in society. In love and sex, they are
indifferent to the finer aspects of a relationship, and dwell merely on the
physical. I do not involve myself with them.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF CAPRICORNIANS

ARIES: They are too career-oriented,ready to sacrifice their ideals to
achieve their goals.And in friendship too,they are possessive and jealous.
They are vindictive; I can hardly trust them. Somehow we are not very
friendly.

TAURUS: They are good companions and devoted lovers. I respect their views
on life. Although they speak little, they are gifted with profound
understanding. In romance,too, they are responsible and balanced. I love
them.

GEMINI: I find them self-centered and withdrawn. How can I get to know them
when they are forever talking about boring things like their career
problems?They don't take any trouble over deepening a relationship, and
hardly spend any time in entertainment and socialising. I don't like them.

CANCER: Sincere as friends and faithful in love, they arouse respect. I find
their withdrawn nature enigmatic and would love to get to know them
intimately. In marriage, too, they are loyal, and love children and family
life. I would like to marry a Capricornian

LEO: I dislike their cynicism. They think no end of themselves. They brood a
lot and are always worrying. I get board in their company. How can I like
them when most of the time they criticized me and my work?

VIRGO: Methodical in their work and amicable by nature, they are sensible
and known how to get on in this world. I find them hard-working and
responsible. In romance and sex too, we are compatible. I love them.

LIBRA: I admire their merit and prudence. But that is not all there is to
life. I feel if there is no beauty or romance, life is not worth living; and
on this score I find them coarse and dull. Somehow we maintain a respectable
distance between us.

SCORPIO: They are people of understanding and knowledge. Through their main
goal is material success, I still like their purposeful way of life. They
are quite friendly and sympathetic. We get along well.

SAGITTARIUS:They are always running around, a little too anxious about their
careers. They hardly ever help others, but they expect others to work for
them! A selfish lot, full of conceit and malice, making a big show of their
charities. I don't like them.

CAPRICORN: They are loyal and faithful, but I think they devote more time to
their careers than to personal relationships. If only they would pay more
attention to matters other than work, and show some concern for the opinion
of others, we could get along together. I appreciate their steadfastness in
friendship.

AQUARIUS: I respect their views- and their efforts in achieving their aims.
But they are a bit too materialistic for us to be true friends. They lack
finesse in love and reject ideals completely. In sex , I find them coarse; I
cannot achieve any rapport with them.

PISCES: I find them good companions in love. They appreciate my view of
life. I like to travel in company with a Capricornian; they are good guides
and interesting conversationalists; even though they may not speak much.
They are well-informed, and do not make a show of it.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF AQUARIANS

ARIES: They are good-looking, very artistic and humane. Quick in striking a
friendship, they are enduring and loyal in a relationship. I can't help but
love such refined persons.

TAURUS: They are quiet and reserved. I respect their intellect and artistic
traits. But they tend to philosophize a bit too much; they are so detached
that they seem indifferent to life. No doubt they are friendly, but somehow
we lack intimacy.

GEMINI: Highly talented and yet unassuming, they interest me. They never
have any complaints; they always look at the positive side.How easily they
laugh away the miseries of life! It is good to know such people. I love them
sincerely.

CANCER: They are devoted in love and marriage; true and sincere as friends,
they are people of integrity. But it is their unconventional life style that
disturbs me. And also they seen so detached and aloof. We are good
acquaintances, but that is all there is to our relationship.

LEO: I see great depth of character in their reserved, quiet demeanor. Their
mastery of metaphysical subject and their keen interest in art fascinates
me. They are consistent in their friendship and affection. I would love to
marry an Aquarian.

VIRGO: They are warm and sympathetic, helpful to others and honest in their
dealings. But their worry-free nature is slightly immature. They tend to
take life too easily and hardly struggle to achieve recognition, although
they claim to be reformers and involve themselves in humanitarian causes. I
find they lac a strong purpose in life.

LIBRA: Great lovers of art and things artistic, they are the geniuses of
this world. They are good conversationalists and make genial companions.
Sincere and honest in relationship, they are extremely gentle and polite. I
love them and have an easy rapport with them.

SCORPIO: I grant them their keen intellect, but do not like their idle
spiritualism. They are irrational in their outlook and have an easy answer
to most of the complexities of existence. But I have nothing against them as
individuals, since they are truthful and genuine in their affections.

SAGITTARIUS: They are quiet friendly towards me. I like their simplicity and
unobtrusiveness. But they seem to be devoting more time to their so-called
'humanitarian' causes, than to anything more fruitful. Still, I like them
for their selflessness and warmth.

CAPRICORN: I think they are somehow 'lucky' in life. That is why they can
talk of philosophy and devote their time to art. True, they are determined
in their own sphere of activity and usually succeed in achieving their goals
by fair means. But I do not like their superiority complex, which shows
itself in their over-calm personality.

AQUARIUS: They devote more time to the affair of people in general than to
those of any individual in particular. They may be neglecting a close friend
or a member of their own family in their pursuit of humanitarian causes.
They are truly spiritualist and honest in beliefs and action. If they could
pay a little more attention to their families, we could be ideal partners.

PISCES: They are deeply sympathetic, and inspire courage and confidence in
other. Their sunny outlook and happy-go-lucky nature is highly infectious. I
respect their love of spirituality and of Nature. They are enduring as
friends, always helpful in times of need.

WHAT OTHERS THINK OF PISCEANS

ARIES: They are too sensitive and touchy. Highly possessive by nature, they
tend to restrict my freedom. I respect their sincerity and loyalty but find
them too serious- positively dull. I do not get on with them.

TAURUS: They have depth of character and conviction. I respond to their
artistic bent of mind. Sincere and trustworthy in a relationship, they make
good friends. They rarely speak ill of others nor do they hurt others
feelings. I like them.

GEMINI: I find them indecisive and weak, lacking in purpose. They attach too
much importance to their involvements and tend to be over-possessive. Of
course, they are honest and just in their dealings, but that is not all
there is to a relationship. In love and sex, they are too soft and docile. I
would have nothing to do with them.

CANCER: Devoted and faithful, they love home and family life; and in a
relationship, they are responsible. I like their complete surrender in love;
it is difficult to resist the friendship of a Piscean. I love them.

LEO: They are too soft and delicate, highly emotional and over-sensitive. I
find them fussy and tiresome. Although I like their charming manners and the
attention they pay to etiquette, establishing intimacy with them seems a bit
difficult.

VIRGO: Warm and sincere, they are true friends. In love and affection too,
they are enduringly faithful. Highly adaptable, to the point of making
compromises, it is easy to live with them. I would be happy to marry a
Piscean.

LIBRA: They are imaginative and respond deeply to beauty and Nature. But
they pay meager attention to love and sex, which is an essential part of
life. I admire their faithfulness in love, but find them monotonous and
dull. I cannot fall in love with them.

SCORPIO: In love, their complete surrender overwhelms me. They are simple
and straightforward people. Highly passionate, they have a strong sexual
urge, which makes them good partners. I would love to get to know them
intimately.

SAGITTARIUS: As mere acquaintances, they are tolerable. But I find them too
cautious and withdrawn for any closer relationship. They make me feel guilty
in anything concerning love and sex. They sound a bit too moralistic and
dogmatic. I do not get on with them.

CAPRICORN: Steadfast and restrained in a relationship, they are innocently
charming. I like the limitless trust they place in others. It is difficult
to betray such honest people. I love them and fortunately we have great
rapport with each other.

AQUARIUS: I appreciate their sincerity and truthfulness. But they dwell too
much on the emotional plane, getting attached to too many things and people.
I can hardly communicate with them on an intellectual or spiritual level.
Nevertheless, I like them.

PISCES: They ought not to take life so seriously. They first see the darker
side of everything before savouring the happier things in life. If only they
paid a little more care to love and sex, we could have a blissful union.
