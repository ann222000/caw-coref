Sanjay Leela Bhansali has a sense of good music, that is why his films
are known for soothing and soul lifting music.After giving a break to
his pet music director Ismail Darwar, this time sanjay has given break
to  Monty Sharma who had given background score to Sanjay's film
Black. Monty has tried to create a masala out of traditonal classical
as well as the moder rock influences.

Monty Sharma has tried to  harmonize perfection with bunch of new
talents (Shail Hada and Parthiv Gohil). Against all odds, it serenades
out to be a refreshing breather for its rhythm divine structural base
and welcome relief from inspired earsplitting and vociferous hip-
hop's, rap's and reggae's.

If Shreya Ghoshal was the find of DEVDAS, then SAAWARIYA showcases
youthful yore and yell of Kishore Kumar's 70's yodeling into new power
house named Shail Hada in delightfully mesmerized title track
&quot;Saawariya&quot;. Monty's rhythm arrangements complimented with briskly
guitar strumming forms enchanting chemistry in making it a
chartbusting &quot;yuppie&quot; track. Ironically, it was Shailendra Singh's
vocal finesse in Rishi Kapoor's debut BOBBY in the year 1973 that
stormed and now it's again Shailendra Singh (alias Shail Hada) making
big news for his son Ranbir in this outstanding track. Shail Haida's
modulating baritones are reminiscent to Abhijit's vocal textures as it
pounces back with the decorum of contemporary concert rock feel amidst
loud cheering and whistling in &quot;Saawariya (Reprise version)&quot;.

Monty's melodic voyage gets into typical Laxmikant Pyarelal-A.R Rehman
mould as one hears delectable sitar riffs, rhythmic drumming, supple
percussions and loud chorus pitched thunderously in textures of soft
echoing vocal tones in &quot;Jab Se Tere Naina&quot;. Shaan's effort makes it
laudable while it's traditional arrangements and contemporary wording
gives it an enchanting  romantic outlook.

&quot;Masha Allah&quot;, a rhythm divine romantic track is typical &quot;chorographer-
art director&quot; elemental work where serene aura of eternal love in
natural surroundings concocts appealingly with volubly soothing
romanticism. Kunal Ganjawala's soulful vocals create magnetism while
Shreya Ghoshal's mellifluous tinge in interludes adds more shades into
it.

Sanjay Leela Bhansali holds baton from Monty and gets his favorite
Shreya Ghoshal into solo singing with her stylized &quot;Bairi
Piya&quot; (DEVDAS) baritones contorted in sluggish tempo in &quot;Thode
Badmash&quot;. Nusrat Badr's wording may not be poetic delight but
Bhansali's harmonic intellect and Shreya's supple vocals serenades
desired mushy ambience.

After vibrant Shail Hada, surprises are in store from Parthiv Gohil
for his synchronized vocals emanating out the variable modes of
meeting soul-mate in soul-stirring &quot;Yoon Shabnami&quot;. This track has
transcendental modes as it swivels from its soft serene feel in its
prelude to  &quot;qawalli&quot; flows gleaming out the arrival of &quot;chand&quot; in the
form &quot;Saawariya&quot; (eternal soul-mate). Sandeep Nath's lyrical wordings
are appealing and its &quot;rubaiyya&quot; enlightens up the romantic flare with
sheer innocence. Parthiv Gohil's impressive intense singing has
glimpses of Hariharan's vocal flair and with added &quot;Saawariya&quot;
signature tuneful notes, it justifies itself to one of all-time
Bhansali's nostalgic outings.

The Soundtrack is a listner's delight.
