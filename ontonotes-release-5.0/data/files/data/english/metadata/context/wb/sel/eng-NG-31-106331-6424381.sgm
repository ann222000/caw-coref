Look around the building that you are sitting (or
standing) in.  Whether it is your house, your office, or maybe just a
random structure that has a computer in it, it wasn't here millions of
years ago.  In fact, it actually developed through a process of
evolution.  Of course it took many centuries of erosion, water, and
weathering!  Maybe a decade or more before you were born, it suddenly
appeared!  Electricity and all!  Isn't it amazing!  There is no way
some "creator" must of built it!

Can you prove the paragraph above?

You see, we humans are much more complicated than a
building.  If you think about it, we have tissue, organs, cells, and
life!  How is it that we, of all things, just evolved here to today?
We must have had some sort of creator, just like the building!  I am
sure many of you believe in human evolution, but do you believe in the
paragraph above?  A human evolving is even more bogus than a brick
building with electricity evolving!  And I hate to break it to you,
but just as the building has a builder, so do we have a creator, and
our Creator is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

As you explain it, that all complicated things were either created or
evolved, I finally understand where I have been wrong all these years.... my
house must have evolved too!!

sorry, i cant buy into your argument. an inanimate object is different
than a creature that is alive in a way that makes your argument
useless. as an example there is the need of a organisms of a kind to
procreate by definition. a building does not have this ability.

No offense, I'm amazed at how foolish you are. You either saw it built or
saw something that proved that, it did not spring up from the ground, but
that it was built with a specific blueprint, much like your body.  So
look around your house for a date or a house building company, I guarantee
you it was built by some construction company.

May you see the truth of God,

Erwin

Wait a minute!  You mean experience counts in this?  Well, in that case, I
surely do have experience that houses and humans come about it far different
ways.  And.  wait. that would mean that YOU have the same type of experience
too!!  Come to think of it, most people know that houses and humans come
about in far different ways. I must have been crazy to think that they
didn't.  I wonder if that's a clue to solving this puzzle? But what is
different about how people come about and how houses come about?  Hmm?

Any organism, or part of an organism, that proves itself successful (by
offering an increased chance for survival and breeding opportunity) is
preserved. Over time, these are naturally selected and survive; less
successful organisms may eventually die out.

You can look at evolution at various levels, but the most accurate way is at
gene level.

Granted people are complex, but they are not designed other than by
mother nature. While a design needs a designer, or a creation needs a
creator, but the order you are observing requires no orderer. Order is
a function of nature alone, so what you are praising and worshiping is
nature, even if you don't recognize it...and yes evolution, which
after all is a wonderous process. You confuse it with god afterall. dkw

Not a sixth grader. A six year old. The difference is about 5 years of age.

You see, when you apply circular logic and specious reasoning, combined with

Besides reading that in a book, Peter, would you care to tell us a couple of things?
1.  Why do you not believe that Lee can be in the Presence of his Creator 24 hours a day, 7 days a week?
2.  What makes you think there is a place called heaven (or hell for that matter)
3.  How do you know that Lee isn't forgiven BEFORE he asks for it?

The Parable of the Invisible Gardener

"Once upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In
the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer
says, 'Some gardener must tend this plot.' The other disagrees, 'There
is no gardener.' So they set up a barbed-wire fence. They electrify
it. They patrol with bloodhounds. But no shrieks ever suggest that
some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire ever
betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry. Yet still
the Believer is not convinced. 'But there is a gardener, invisible,
intangible, insensible to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent
and makes no sound, a gardener who comes secretly to look after the
garden for which he loves.' At last the Sceptic despairs, 'But what
remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an
invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an
imaginary gardener or even from no gardener at all?'" - from
Wikipedia

Yes we are more complicated than a building - just our brains alone
are incredibly complex beyond imagining.  That's why you should never
be your own brain surgeon.

So tell me, how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally
elusive (not to mention omniscient, omnipresent, omnibenevolent)
designer differ from an imaginary gardener or even no gardener at all?

The argument by design is an invalid argument and Pastor Skip should
be embarassed to make it.

Hey Peter,

Okay well lets us slow down a bit then.  I understand very well how to
reach the crator, and lets just say that my understanding seems very
differant from yours.

Take it as read that such statements like this:

'the only way you may see your Creator in heaven is to ask
forgiveness from Jesus Christ!'

Cuts no ice with me and will only ever piss me off, not because I have
a dislike for Christianity(although this is asuredly true) but because
it is an inherently stupid argument, in fact it is no argument at all.

I have come to a certian understanding about God, and Gods plan via a
route of carefull and intelegent(no sniggering you Atheist lot!)
thought and reading.

If you wish to 'let me understand' anything about God, Jesus, or
heaven then you will have to enter into discourse with me and make
your arguments telling.

Peter I am more than willing to do this, although I fear I already
know what the outcome will be.

Ohh and one last thing, I seem to remember a chap here before with
your name, he buggered off one day when the questions become too hard,
I wonder if that will happen again?

They are NOT proven.  They are written about.  If you want to take someone else's word on it, have at it.  But because it is written in the Bible does not mean it is "proven".  If you want to believe that what is written in the Bible is Proof......again, have at it.

Peter, What did the father say to the Prodigal Son upon his return?  Did he say "I forgive you?"  Nope.....he didn't even acknowledge the "sin".  The son ASKED for forgiveness......which does something for his guilty feelings, but it had no effect on the father.  The father was simply happy to have his son back.

If you HAVE to ask......it's not Grace.

You have simply bought in to Fundamentalist BS!

Why do you insist arguing with this deluded fool.  His entire life is
based around religious ideas, therefore if he is convinced (i.e. by

never change his mind.  Try to "save" his disciples, not him.

I'm not trying to "save" anyone....simply because he
doesn't need "saving" anymore than anyone else on this
board. The idea that circulates in all cultures
religious or secular that the other person is broken
and needs to be fixed is a problem cause by the human
condition in the first place.  ie... If I see you as
broken, I don't look at my own shortcomings.

Now that doesn't mean that my shortcomings are
"faults" or "sins"...it simply means that I haven't
"arrived" yet and that I've got a long way to go to
get to where I want to get to.

I can discuss things with people as a way to increase
my understanding and therefore bring myself closer to
MY goal.  If the person who I'm discussing something
with believes that they have "arrived", it only means
that they have a different destination than me.  Where
they want to get to is none of my business.

Yet that's not strictly true, we can say roughtly how old the universe
is by the WMAP data which shows us the microwave radiation left over
from the big bank.  In essance we can tell how long ago this big bang
