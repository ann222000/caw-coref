Hello guys.

Does anyone have any experience with rolling vehicles off road? I
don't, but I'm concerned about it and am about to add an attempt at
rollover protection on my HMMWV (and maybe my Unimog U1100).

The basic dilemma is the need to isolate the body from the frame.
This is important in most vehicles to prevent noise and vibration
(not real concerns for full-time ORVs) from entering the cab; and
maybe also to minimize sheet metal fatigue from flexing. It is
doubly important for Mogs because their frames must flex a lot.

Added to this is the issue of whether roll cages (or bars) should be
fastened to frames or bodies. I think that all race car experience
(except for tub cars with no central frames) demands the cage be a
part of the frame; after all, the frame is the unit with almost all
the mass attached. But often race car cages need to protect the
driver from 100 mph + crashes. Fastening a cage to the frame is
difficult and requires isolation from the body with large holes in
the body and rubber grommets.

So one is tempted to use body mounted cages/bars. Maybe for the 20
mph. gentle rollovers (not crashes) that most recreational ORVs might
experience, a well designed, triangulated and gussetted cage attached
to the body would be adequate.

Any opinions or experience? Thanx.

It's not very noticeable in street vehicles either, just make sure that your engine/ tranny
mounts are in good shape as well as your shocks and suspension. It's their job to stop the
vibrations, body mounts are to let the frame flex slightly more than the body.

FRAMES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO FLEX!!! This is one of the biggest misconseptions in the four
wheeling community, people want their frames to do the job of their suspension. Think what
happens if you bend a piece of wire back and forth over and over again, eventially it will
break. The same is true for your frame, if you insist and twisting it back and forth it will
crack and eventially break. One nice thing about frame mounted cages is that they won't allow
the frame to flex as much and throw that responsibility back on your suspension were it belongs
(and the suspension on an unimog is a great system to begin with).

"/> our club requires that cages be mounted to frame on all fiberglass or very rusty vehicles. I
have yet to see someone issolate the cage and body and have never heard anyone complain about
the results. Remember whats at stake here (your head), personally I will never go without a
cage again, they've saved my butt too many times. I'll always mount them to the frame too,
I've seen roll bars punch through fenders before and that's not fun. One last thing you might
want to consider is mounting the seats to the cage as well, if the cage holds together but the
seats break loose your no better off than you were without the cage. Hope this info helps.
See ya on the trails,

No experience, only what I've learned from reading all the info I can
get my hands on, and talking to the accessible &quot;experts&quot; about it.
With a large floor plate on the floor mounts, it's OK to mount to the
floor of the vehicle.
SCORE, from what I can tell from their rules (don't recall the web
address, but it's somewhere on a link from Dean Waters' 4x4 page), does
not seem to require a cage to be attached to the frame. If you're going
to find a hard crash anywhere, you can probably find a similar or worse
one at a race, be it SCORE, SODA, LaRana, or anywhere else. High speed
crashes are usually the worst, and they (at least SCORE, anyway) does
not seem to expect that the cage is part of the frame.

FWIW, a Hummvee (is yours military or civilian-model?) is pretty sturdy
as is; I've heard tales of people rolling them 1-2 full barrel rolls,
pushing them back upright, reseating the tires, and driving away. In
fact, if you have the runflats, you don't even have to reseat the tires.
