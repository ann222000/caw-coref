This reminds me so much of &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.multivax.com/
last_question.html&quot;&gt;The Last Question&lt;/a&gt; by Asminov.

I agree full knowledge of existence, whether by man or our descendents
is our Reason, the Universe perhaps needs to experience itself to
function.

Another good book with an interesting theory was The Omega Point
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_point
by Tipler.

I theorise that mans experience through time will be the breaking
point through to faith and spirituality.  Time on a cosmological scale
is but another dimension as is space, to speak of the Universe must
mean referring to its entire existence from the Big Bang to whatever
the future holds.  Perhaps consiousness is but the experience of minds
making sense of events along the time dimension?

Yeah, Time is of the essence (now where did I hear that, oh yeah, the
apartment rental contract ;&gt;))  - Really though, time is the key to
me.  Cause and effect, physics, mathematics, chemistry, prose. Hell,
everything is into time. I can't really think of anything that doesn't
have time as some sort of attribute.  I sometimes suspect that if we
can just succeed at getting outside the &quot;moment&quot; and seeing a
chronology as a whole (gestalt?) then many murky things become clear.

One of my favorite timewasters is to try to exercise my mind into the
ability to grasp a long interval of time all at once, instead of as
memory (which implies time passing), I guess an analogy would be to
hear all the notes of a song at one time while still understanding the
melody and rhythm.  There are often references to &quot;timelessness&quot; in
religion and eastern philosophy.  This is where I got the idea to try
to take my &quot;now&quot; into longer than an instant. (I will write more about
this later (pun and self reference intended.))  Ouch that hurts....
Maybe the reason that time travel isn't real is because it isn't a
&quot;physics&quot; thing, it's a &quot;philosophy&quot; or &quot;mind&quot; thing.  One thing I do
see is that because the brain (as opposed to &quot;mind&quot;) has as an
attribute that it functions within time (neurons fire at about 200 Hz,
I think, and Hz is of course expressed with respect to time) and the
physical limitations of the brain may well determine the ability of
the mind, BUT, maybe not!  Maybe the &quot;Spark of Life&quot; referenced
elsewhere in this group, the essence of consciousness if you will,
rides on top of the physical brain, sort of like the application rides
on top of the OS, which runs on the hardware on a computer, with the
difference that &quot;mind&quot; expands the realm, while software only inhabits
physicality - there's no spirit in software, but I have a urgent need
to believe that my spirit isn't completely limited to the expanse of
my brain.

If that made sense, then I have done better at expressing what, to me,
are some symbolic representations that don't convert well to words,
than I could realistically expect.  If not, then please excuse my poor
attempts at saying things that I don't know the words for.  None of
the tenses in English can be used to describe the idea of being in
more than one moment (which in physics would mean being in more than
one place) now. There is no word for nowever (unless I just made it
up!) and mind/body is a false dichotomy, I believe.

One of the reasons I (in a different thread here) presented the idea
of man-machine augmentation (implants and brain-machine interfaces) is
because computers will soon present us with a philosophical problem,
similar to that of  genetic manipulation - see: http://www.singinst.org/
- for details.  Whether we like it or not, man has the ability to
change the universe, especially our planet, in myriad ways.  We need
to bring our understanding of the metaphysical to at least the level
of our understanding of the physical before we really do misuse our
power and botch everything up.  We won't get a second chance to get it
right.

To me, computers and technology offer both great hope and great fear.
The hope is that my species will go forth and multiply, and have
dominion over all throughout the universe.  The fear is that we will,
but at the cost of our humanity.  One of the very basic questions is
whether or not man's mind can act as a manipulator of reality without
physical action.  Another basic question is if we have the morality to
control how and what we achieve.  Just because we can, doesn't mean we
should, or does it?  How would God answer that question?  Why would he
give us the gifts of intelligence and curiosity, and then expect us
not to use them?

Sigh, every time I write to you folks, I seem to wind up asking
difficult questions.

You haven't done any better job than me at answering them, either
&lt;grin&gt;.

how can he give us anything if there is no difference between he and 'us'?

Good point, one that I would elucidate as the man/god false
dichotomy.

Put another way, man, squirrels and catfish are not part of nature, we
ARE nature, and nature is God.

The fundamental interconnectedness of all things...  It's not really
that all things are interconnected, it's that they are all the same
thing!

Understanding or not understanding are perspectives that are
particularly human in that they are either successes or limitations of
our perceptions, not limitations on the transparency of reality. All
is there for us to see, if we but only look. Accepting things that are
not understandable has nothing to do with whether or not they are
real, they are, or are not, as the case may be. It is our perceptions
that have to be proven correct or incorrect.  It is when we don't
accept the proof that we run into trouble.

I personally cannot discount paranormal events because I have had
direct experience with several.  Perhaps this is because my mind is
open, or perhaps I am simply gullible.  I am unable to prove or
disprove to my satisfaction either way, and again this could be a
personal fault, or prejudice.  This in no way means that anyone else
should hold strong beliefs based on my experience, only that I cannot
be sure.  It is my hope to one day have an answer, but I do not base
my actions on the belief that I will again experience a mystical
insight.  It is peculiar to mystical events that they are
&quot;unexplainable&quot; - If they were explainable, they wouldn't be
&quot;mystical.&quot;  Nonetheless, as H. G. Wells wrote in 'War of the Worlds',
&quot;The odds of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, but still
they come.&quot;

You would cry, too,
if it happened to you.&quot;

Time is a funny thing, at times when we are very focused it seems to
pass faster.  In meditation, sitting two hours seems like ten minutes.
Getting outside the moment really isn't the problem, it's truly
getting inside the moment, that's where timelessness is.  That's where
one gets to perceive the WHOLENESS of everything.  And it's not like
you are everywhere at once, it's that your consciousness is everywhen,
and you can even pick a destination within everywhen at the speed of
thought.  Time and space need each other, it's necessary on this side
of the looking glass.  Eternity has no need of such limitations.
Holding the minds attention on longer periods of time won't achieve a
perception of timelessness, but it will develop your will power which
is a good thing.  This helps one achieve whatever intent or desire
they may have.  Taking the moment and extending it is going in the
wrong direction, withdrawing into the moment and holding it there is
the destination you are looking for.
That's great, &quot;I think therefore I Hertz&quot;.  ; &gt;)
I think it may be that the consciousness is the OS and we are the
application, the brain being the IO device.  The problem; the
application has a virus called EGO.  It disengages us from the real
purpose of the application and misinterprets our sense of
dissatisfaction.  It's like when you are born your heart and mind are
connected, the heart can express through the mind.  As stress is
introduced to our life the vibration of the mind is tuned to lower
vibrations. Because the hearts vibration is so high, and the mind
finally gets so dense that the heart can't speek through it and a
break happens.  One of the results of this break is that one
experiences a sense of dissatisfaction.  We spend the rest of our
lives trying to be satisfied through things outside ourselves. We
desire something, we acquire it, and we get attached to it.  It's like
we grow a psychic appendage to that thing.  When that thing dies, gets
broken, stolen, or leaves before we are ready, it's like an amputation
without an anesthetic, negative emotions, tuneing to a denser
vibration.  We are pulled deeper into error.  Meditation is going into
that timelessness where the KEYNOTE resides, and tuneing ourselves out
of dischord and reconnecting the heart to the mind, result;
satisfaction, happiness, an intuitive grasp of the Divine Intention,
being appropriate in every moment.
It's in this state of consciousness only, that we can be of any use to
anything without causing a domino effect of errors.
With computers that run faster, it only means that we can make errors
that much faster. It's the old GIGO syndrome, garbage in garbage out.
Intelligence and curiosity are the elements of consciousness that
eventually lead us back through the looking glass.  First we have to
let go of all theories and empirical ways of inquiry and borrow some
of the esoteric ways of seeking.

This has been such a great chain of responses and creative thought.

I am a great fan of Asimov's &quot;The Last Question.&quot; I first read it
years ago when I was working at a planetarium and we got permission
from Asimov to produce it as a planetarium show. Since one of my roles
at the planetarium was to run the shows, I probably watched our
finished program fifty times. I still think the ideas Asimov wrote
about in the last question are timeless. In fact, whenever I think
about what will happen to the universe at the end of time, I reflect
on Asimov's story. It is just as powerful and meaningful for our
generation.

There is a book entitled;  &quot;The Kybalian&quot;  by Three Initiates, the
seven laws expounded on in this book may well be the most profound
explanation of existence we have.  I was initiated into the
meditations that utilize these laws and I can say from experience,
they work!

According to the Journal of Parapsychology, the term paranormal
describes &quot;any phenomenon that in one or more respects exceeds the
limits of what is deemed physically possible according to current
scientific assumptions.&quot;

The word paranormal comes from the words &quot;para&quot; meaning beyond, and
normal. So the term paranormal really means something that is beyond
the normal scope of science or being beyond a scientific explanation.
knorton13.tripod.com/id33.html

Anything that does not take place in the natural order or in a normal
way of things that take place in the realm of the world. This term is
used to refer to unexplainable events. These would included but are
not limited to ghosts, ESP, telepathy, UFO's, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness
monster.
laurelparanromal.tripod.com/id13.html

paranormal: Beyond the range of normal experience or scientific
explanation. 2. of or pertaining to events or perceptions occurring
without scientific explanation, as clairvoyance or extrasensory
perception.
towerwebproductions.com/alt-lib/occult/definitions.shtml

# A general term which refers to anything that cannot be explained
scientifically, ie that which can not be understood in terms of
current scientific knowledge. The word Paranormal is often used
specifically to describe phenomena relating to Ghosts and Hauntings.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Any or all of those definitions may be applied to what I experienced.
As a hardnosed empiricist, I consider my paranormal experiences to be
a wake-up call to the limitations of my perception and understanding,
not an invalidation of what I know, but rather clues as to what I do
NOT know.  I accept the possibility that there is more to this world
than pure science and provable fact, but I do not see that that in any
invalidates experience with things that are repeatable to a degree
approaching certainty.

To be specific, at the very real risk of accusations impugning my
integrity and sanity, I will say that I experienced severe nightmares
in the 18 months prior to September 11, 2001.  I would say that the
same dream occurred about 40 times in that period. These nightmares in
no way predicted the tragedy that occurred that day, but they were
fraught with terror, airplanes, bombs, death and destruction.  The
nightmares ended afterward.

My belief is that, in some way connected to the ideas that the
universe has communications channels that we don't understand, there
was a paranormal reason for these nightmares.  That is to say that
there was some aspect of reality that was trying to tell me of the
future, but my empirical nature was unable or unwilling to hear the
message.  My bad.  Not that there was anything I could have done.  No
one would have believed such a fantastic tale, even had I understood
the message perfectly.  The point is simply that it happened and to
me, it is unexplained. Not unexplainable, just unexplained as yet.

This is why I inquire into the state of cosmology, quantum mechanics,
macro physics and philosophy as well as parapsychology.  No single
discipline offers the answers I seek.  None can.  Jim Sauter, in
another post in this thread makes some interesting statements that
really seem to bear out the same thing I keep hearing in my own head.
I think perhaps we are discussing two sides of the same coin when I
talk about expanding the moment and he talks about compressing time.
They are the same thing seen from different perspectives.  I, too have
experience with meditation, foremost on the list is time spent
studying Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism - in which chanting is used to
develop mental discipline for the deeper insights.  Before I began
that sudy, I once attended a function where a learned teacher of this
faith, whom I did not know nor recognize (I assumed he was simply
another worshiper) talked to me at great length, drawing me into some
really good self analysis.  At the end of the night, the friend who
took me to the event made a comment that I had monopolized the time of
their honored guest (I was not a member of the group, and besides he
approached me, so I had no idea that I had committed such a faux pas)
to which my reply was to ask who the gentleman actually was.  My
friend told me that he was the highest ranking member of NS in
America.  So of course I wondered why he chose to talk to me over all
the highly respectful members of the temple (not a one of them ever
interrupted our chat!) and my friend informed me that the Priest had
chosen to learn from me. ME!  I still don't know what or if I taught
him, but my friend said the the Priest told him later that I was much
further on the path to enlightenment than any of the faithful present
that night.  There was a word he used, that basically meant that I had
achieved some form of insight that was normally only achieved after
great study (No I don't recall the word) and that I would be a great
asset to the temple if I could be persuaded to join.  I declined, not
from malice or disbelief, but because it was painfully embarrassing to
be held in undeserved regard.  I felt then, as I do now, that any
enlightenment I may have achieved is only a baby step toward my final
goal.   Some may argue that that attitude is the enlightenment, if so,
it is not fulfilling my need.

I must say that I no longer experience stress or confusion, merely
acceptance that all will be made clear when I am ripe for
understanding.  That a baby cannot understand things that an adult
takes for granted.  In &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; Michael Valentine
Smith says &quot;I am but an egg.&quot;  This is my attitude, I am waiting to
hatch and really begin the journey to understanding.  And it will come
to pass. That is my faith and belief.  Patience will be rewarded.

Peace, may we all grok life, the universe and everything in the
fullness of time,

and to comment this sentence I'll use a song from Björk:

*Alarm call*

I have walked this earth
And watched people
It doesn't scare me at all
I can be sincere
And say I like them
It doesnt scare me at all
You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness
I want to go on a mountain-top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the human race
From suffering
I'm no fucking buddhist
But this is enlightenment
The less room you give me
The more space I've got
It doesnt scare me at all
This is an alarm-call
So wake-up, wake-up now
Today has never happened
And it doesn't frighten me
It doesn't scare me at all

My life has been saturated with paranormal experiences since my
earliest years, (five months old).
I enjoyed your comments a lot, right on.
I have to go to work soon so I'll just make a short comment.
The answer that we come to through all our enquireing will never be
UNDERSTOOD by our mind, instead we come to inhabit the answer as an
experience. That experience: &quot;The Intuitive Grasp of The Divine
Intention&quot; an inner guidance to appropriate behaviour  on your way to
enlightenment.
Thanks for the input.          Next TIME,       Jim

Bob,
An interesting little book along these lines:   &quot;Flatland&quot;,  and a
more contemporary reprint, &quot;Flatland&quot;/&quot;Sphereland&quot;.
I like the idea that God created time so everything wouldn't happen all at once.
It's very interesting to me how empirical scientists explore the
metaphysical with a left brain mentality.  They discount the input of
the right brain's ability to perceive systems and wholes and many of
the laws and tools of the spiritual world.
Another book of interest: &quot;The Kybalian&quot; by three initiates.
Another Time,    Jim
