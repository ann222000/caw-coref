Hi
first time poster but have question about the flght planner and the computer
ATC. I just started creating flights using the flight planner and
occasionally the
ATC will not direct me to the next VOR? and then other times it constantly
has me change back and forth between different Centers

Are there bugs with the ATC in Flight Sim X?
TIA

Dunno, I have to confess that in ten years of flight simming, i have never
once used the flight planner - after all, that would not be proper
quilling...

Hey John,

Welcome to the forum!

I can only speak on my experience with FSX. Some have reported, instances of
the ATC dropping, or &quot; forgetting&quot; them, where they ended up just having to
cancel the flight.
I normally use the flight planner, flying IFR, at high altitude airways. I
have yet, to have atc drop me, or forget me. They have always guided me to
the proper landing .

I can say, when I am running with the GPS open, oftentimes I will pass an
intersect, and continue along the assigned heading for a few nm, before atc
finally tells me to turn and get on the correct heading for the next
intersect.

As far as constantly changing back and forth between centers, that certainly
has happened to me on more than one occasion, sometimes i just grumble and
do as they say, eventually they settle down some.

Hope this helps,

--
Don

FS tries to be as real as it can.  There are some quirks, just as you found
out.  The ATC is good, but most of the time switching back and forth from a
couple of Centers to Towers and back again drives me nuts.  Especially on
long haul flights that I like to do.  I don't get dropped or forgotten about
too often but it does happen.

The flight planner is very lame.  I try and fly the real routes that are
available on some online flight planners, or if its the states try
www.flightaware.com

I use FSBuild to create the route that I copy, and then push the route over
to FSNav so I can fly it.  This way I bypass the FS Flight Planner.

Ok, well thanks everyone for those prompt replies. I also have never had a
problem
with using the high altitude airways. Just this am tried a VOR to VOR and it
forgot me, but
I had the GPS open and didnt wait much so it might have directed me later...
Still, having a great time with FSX, now that I have a PC that runs it...
Thanks everyone

ATC will not keep giving you headings to each waypoint. You have a
flight plan and you are expected to fly it. You will only be given a
heading by ATC when they want you to deviate from your plan. This is
also true in RL.

Good to know, thanks Ian.
I now fly, with gps open, and turn when I see a direction change on the gps.

Still a learning :)...
