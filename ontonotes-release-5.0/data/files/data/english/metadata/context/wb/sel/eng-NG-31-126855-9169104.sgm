0)  RRND/FND Fundraiser, Q3 2007

UPDATE, 08/24/07

The last 24 hours have been another one of those &quot;nada&quot; fundraising days --
not a single contribution toward our quarterly fundraising goal.

Depressing? Yeah -- but we had a couple of good days there, and there are
still ~36 hours left to make it up and get this fundraiser over by Monday.
If we do that -- if YOU do that -- it's &quot;no more fundraising until
December.&quot; If not, we keep slogging along, and I probably kick off the 4th
quarter drive earlier. Time to support &quot;the libertarian movement's daily
newspaper,&quot; folks ... our operators are standing by.

We are at $600. Our goal is $3,000. We've got a full tank of gas, half a
pack of cigarettes, it's dark and we're wearing sunglasses. Hit it! - TLK

1)  GOP Senator: US should begin Iraq withdrawal
Reuters

&quot;President George W. Bush should announce on September 15 a small initial
pullout of U.S. troops from Iraq to spur the Iraqi government to take steps
toward political reconciliation, an influential Republican senator said on
Thursday. Virginia Sen. John Warner said Bush should 'announce on the 15th
that in consultation with our senior military commanders he has decided to
initiate the first step in a withdrawal of our forces.' ... Warner said he
did not advocate 'rapid pullout' from Iraq and pointed out he had voted
against any timetable for withdrawal.&quot; (08/23/07)

2)  Poll: Most Americans in the dark about world politics
Yahoo! News

&quot;Two-thirds of US adults admit to being in the dark about political issues
outside the United States, and only a third are well-versed in US politics,
the results of a poll published Tuesday showed. ... Global political
knowledge was miniscule, with just three percent of women and 14 percent of
men saying they are extremely knowledgeable on world politics. One reason
for the knowledge gap is lack of interest, according to the poll. 'Well over
half (57 percent) say they do not like learning about political issues in
other countries,' and 32 percent expressed a lack of interest for homespun
politics, the Harris Poll group said.&quot; (08/22/07)

3)  Iraq: Insurgents attack Samarra police posts
Guardian [UK]

&quot;Sixty suspected al-Qaida in Iraq fighters hit national police facilities in
a coordinated attack in Samarra, sparking two hours of fighting that saw
three people killed and more than a dozen insurgents captured, police said
Friday. The masked attackers drove into the city at dusk Thursday in about
20 vehicles, including pickups with machine-guns, then split into small
groups and assaulted four police checkpoints and a headquarters building, a
Samarra police official said. One policeman and two civilians -- a woman and
an 11-year-old girl -- were killed in the fighting in the city 60 miles
north of Baghdad, and nine others were injured including a police commando
and three children. There were no details on insurgent casualties, but
police arrested 14 suspects, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to release the information.&quot;

4)  US authorized Pakistan incursions
Salt Lake Tribune

&quot;Newly uncovered 'rules of engagement' show the U.S. military gave elite
units broad authority more than three years ago to pursue suspected
terrorists into Pakistan, with no mention of telling the Pakistanis in
advance. The documents obtained by The Associated Press offer a detailed
glimpse at what Army Rangers and other terrorist-hunting units were
authorized to do earlier in the war on terror.&quot; (08/23/07)

5)  GA: Panicked pols propose preposterous pants prohibition
Fox News

&quot;Baggy pants that show boxer shorts or thongs are becoming a 'major concern'
throughout the United States and should be banned in Atlanta, according to a
proposed amendment to the city's indecency laws. 'I don't want young people
thinking that half-dressing is the way to go. I want them to think about
their future,' the amendment's sponsor, city councilman C. T. Martin said.
Debbie Seagraves, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Georgia, said the law could not be enforced in a nondiscriminatory way
because it targets something that came out of the black youth culture. ...
The proposed ordinance would also bar women from showing the strap of a
thong beneath their pants. They would also be prohibited from wearing
jogging bras in public or show a bra strap, Seagraves said.&quot; (08/23/07)

6)  AZ: City sells stolen land
Arizona Republic

&quot;Mesa obtained almost twice the assessed value when it sold property last
week to downtown hardware store owner Ken Lenhart. The deal closed the books
on what likely was the most controversial land transaction in Mesa history,
one that became a national rallying cry for property-rights advocates and an
example of what many view as abuse of the power of eminent domain. ...
Bailey balked at the amount he was offered for his building and relocation
costs, and when the city tried to use eminent domain to acquire his shop he
went to court with the help of the Institute for Justice, a libertarian
legal advocacy group. After Bailey won a landmark ruling in the Arizona
Court of Appeals in 2003, the city and Lenhart were stymied. Mesa let it be
known this year, however, that it was getting ready to sell the property. An
appraisal done for the city in April by Appraisal Technology Inc. of Tempe
valued the parcels at far less than the $1.27 million it cost to acquire
them. The five lots along Main Street were valued at $370,000, and the four
lots along Pepper Street at $395,000 -- a combined $765,000, or $13.90 per
square foot. Mesa, however, got Lenhart to pay $1.34 million, or $24.36 per
square foot.&quot; (08/22/07)

7)  IN: BP backs off plan for more Lake Michigan pollution
Chesterton Tribune

&quot;In the wake of ongoing public outcry, BP America announced this morning
that it will not dump more pollution into Lake Michigan from its Whiting
refinery despite the approval granted by Indiana for the increased
discharge. ... BP announced that it will not implement the state permit but
will instead work over the next 18 months to seek other technologies that
would allow it to expand its refinery without increasing the amount of
ammonia and total suspended solids discharged into Lake Michigan. ...
Indiana's permit prompted ongoing public outcry, with opposition that
included public officials from Illinois and Michigan. Opponents said the
permit amounted to a reversal of decades-long efforts to reduce pollution
levels in the lake.&quot; (08/23/07)

8)  Facebook to open gold mine of data to advertisers
Times Online [UK]

&quot;Facebook is preparing an advertising model that would allow advertisers to
target its users based on information that they reveal about themselves on
the social networking website. ... The site is a potential goldmine to
advertisers because it contains a host of data on its users, such as their
birthdate, interests, events they plan to attend, holidays and musical
tastes, as well as numerous photographs. ... The advertisements are expected
to appear differently from the banner ads and boxes that show up on the
borders of Facebook pages at present. Instead, they would be mixed up with
the 'news feed,' which provides updates on the activities of each user's
friends.&quot; (08/24/07)

9)  Iraqi immigrant gets US apology, cash for abduction
Seattle Post-Intelligencer

&quot;Arrested and held in a Montana jail 5,000 miles from his family, recent
Iraqi immigrant Abdulameer Yousef Habeeb nearly abandoned his belief in
America, the country that gave him political asylum after he fled
persecution at home. But a group of attorneys, a federal apology and cash
restored that faith, Habeeb said Thursday at a news conference. It was held
to formally announce the settlement of his lawsuit against the federal
agents who arrested and nearly deported the 41-year-old Kent resident and
father of three. ... Habeeb, an artist, left his native Iraq after a series
of government arrests in retaliation for his opposition to Iraq's
then-dictator Saddam Hussein. Granted political refugee status by U.S.
immigration, he soon settled in the Seattle area and began looking for work.
He found a job building furniture and then was offered a job at an Islamic
newspaper in Washington, D.C. .... and boarded a cross-country train to
begin work. ... the Seattle-to-Chicago leg of the trip made a brief stop in
Havre, Mont. Habeeb joined other passengers on the platform to stretch his
legs. ... [A Border Patrol] agent arrested Habeeb, locking him in a local
jail for three days and then transferring him in handcuffs to Seattle for
deportation. ... A few days later, he was released without explanation, but
the D.C. newspaper, fearing that Habeeb was a man marked by federal
authorities, pulled the job offer.&quot; (08/23/07)

released from military custody. A three-judge panel of the court ruled 2-1

military trials, doesn't strip Ali al-Marri of his constitutional right to
challenge his accusers in court.&quot; (08/23/07)

12) Marine charged with 225 counts of abuse
Port Huron Times-Herald

&quot;A Marine drill instructor has been charged with 225 criminal counts
connected to abusing recruits, a Marines spokesman said Thursday. In one
incident, Sgt. Jerrod M. Glass allegedly ordered a recruit to jump
head-first into a trash can and then pushed him further into the container,
according to court documents cited in The San Diego Union-Tribune. He is
also accused of striking recruits with a tent pole and a heavy flashlight.&quot;
[editor's note: Something smells &quot;someone powerful's son complained, let's

and a boy. He is also accused of assaulting another boy and a girl.&quot;

&quot;Iranian police have closed more than 20 barbers' shops in the capital
Tehran. The authorities say the barbers were encouraging un-Islamic
behaviour by offering Western hairstyles, tattooing and also
eyebrow-plucking for men. Police say they have inspected more than 700 shops
during a two-week crackdown in the city. The move is part of an annual
campaign against what is known locally as bad hijab, or un-Islamic clothing,
that this year is also targeting men.&quot; (08/23/07)

&quot;Police have warned sat nav users not to leave them in cars after thieves
used one to find the owner's house. The thieves took the device from a
parked car, pressed 'home' and got the family's address, reports the Daily
Mirror. They also found the keys to another car in the vehicle parked at
Alton Towers theme park in Staffs, and stole them. They did not steal the
first car. But knowing the family would probably be away from home for the
entire day, they headed off to the empty house in Shropshire. There they
found that the stolen keys fitted a convertible in the driveway so they took
it.&quot; (08/23/07)

17) PA: Uproar over state plan for gun sale shutdown
Philadelphia Inquirer

&quot;Conspiracy, idiocy or just plain political opportunity? When it comes to
the issue of guns in Pennsylvania, the answer depends on geography -- or so
suggests the latest flap over Gov. Rendell's decision to shut down the
state's instant background check system for gun purchases between Sept. 2
and 6. The reason: much-needed computer upgrades. The fallout: people won't
be able to buy guns for four days -- four days that coincide with the start
of hunting season, when doves and early Canada geese become fair game,
hunting enthusiasts say. Anger around the Capitol is palpable. And at least
one top Republican says it's an effort by 'liberals from Philadelphia' to do
back-door gun control.&quot; (08/23/07)

&quot;As Tonya Mathenia cradled herself in his fleece blanket, the 38-year-old

a husband for more than three years. The man she killed with a 9mm pistol
Sunday night after snatching the weapon she said he put to her forehead,
threatening to end her life in their Westside bungalow. Instead, she took
his. ... The woman said she called 911 as the abuse began and screamed so
someone at the other end could hear her before she hung up as her attacker
approached. At 8:54 p.m., according to her phone's memory bank, she got a
call back from the Sheriff's Office. After secretly pressing the speaker
phone button, she hollered some more, hoping help would be on the way. It
didn't come in time. Police said they answered a call about a shooting about
9:15 p.m.In the minutes before, as her companion started closing in,
Mathenia said instinct overrode loyalty and love. Fear rising from her gut
radiated to a finger poised on the gun's trigger.&quot; (08/23/07)

bullet that lodged in Mr. Wallace's spine paralyzed his legs, and he used a

&quot;Partly to restore strained ties with ally America, and partly to deal

the Persian Gulf. In the European nation most publicly opposed to the Iraq
war, media reaction in Paris on both the left and right appears to support
new French offers to mediate among Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish factions --
whose strife is paralyzing Iraq's day-to-day governance. ... France's sudden
shift on Iraq 'is almost as spectacular as the refusal of France to take
part in the American intervention in Iraq,' noted the left French daily Le
Monde. 'It is time to stop lecturing the Americans about their errors and
start contributing to a solution.'&quot; [editor's note: It'll be mildly

27) Swiper no swiping!
Fairfield Weekly
by Phil Maymin

&quot;I have watched my share of Dora [the Explorer], and what's most interesting
to me is a minor character named Swiper. I'm not alone in my fascination:
the same Wikipedia article devotes more than a thousand words to Swiper;
Dora gets less than 150. Why is Swiper so interesting? I think the creators
of the show, perhaps unconsciously, made the character the embodiment of
government. And viewers, sensing that familiarity, perhaps also
unconsciously, trigger in themselves the same feelings of unease that they
get when thinking about government itself. Like the government, Swiper the
Fox appears in every episode and tries to steal an important item from Dora.
Yet Swiper doesn't need or use the item himself. Instead he merely hides it

Interview with George Phillies, candidate for the Libertarian Party's 2008
presidential nomination. &quot;Moreno: Are there any additional items in your
background that you think serve as qualifications for this job? Phillies: As
a college professor, I have enormous practice in taking complex ideas and
explaining them in small pieces so that ill-read, unmotivated students
actually understand them. I expect this skill will be extremely effective in
dealing with Congress and the Federal bureaucracy -- the American people
will, I am sure, enjoy my explanations and wonder why Congress is taking its

29) Don't know much about history
Guardian [UK]
by Matthew Yglesias

&quot;For months now, many conservatives have been fundamentally positioning
themselves for the post-war era, readying the arguments that will blame the
failure of the venture in Iraq on its opponents rather than its architects.
That Bush himself has chosen to join them is, perhaps, on some level the
clearest reflection of the reality that the president knows perfectly well
that the war is unwinnable, and blame-shifting now the best hope for saving
his historical legacy.&quot; (08/23/07)

30) The carnage in Iraq -- past, present, and future

&quot;The headline of an August 22, 2007, article in the New York Times reads,
'Citing Vietnam, Bush Warns of Carnage if U.S. Leaves Iraq.' Readers with
live brain cells must be stunned by such a warning. What, exactly, does
President Bush imagine is happening every day in Iraq now? Does he envision
scenes of social tranquility and cooperative harmony amid the peaceful palms
of Mesopotamia? And what, one wonders, does he suppose was going on earlier
in Vietnam, as the U.S. forces extended their unwelcome stay year after
grisly year? At times, observing the president and listening to his
speeches, one simply doesn't know what to make of him. Is he actually as
detached from reality as he appears to be? And do his handlers really
believe that at this late date, the American people will take seriously the

31) The caudillo in his labyrinth
Reason
by Michael C. Moynihan

&quot;To many gringo observers, Hugo Chavez is merely a mildly buffoonish, if
delightfully brave, left-wing populist; a blustering, swaggering caudillo
who used the UN lectern to unmask the current American president as the
physical incarnation of the devil; a cherubic strongman sidling up with
politicians like Rep. Joe Kennedy and London Mayor Ken Livingstone in order
to unburden the empire of capitalism's victims. But he is also the man who
has declared his eternal friendship with Libya's Col. Gaddafi, Belorussian
dictator Alexander Lukashenko, Iranian leader Ahmadinejad, Zimbabwean tyrant
Robert Mugabe, Sandinista commandante Daniel Ortega, imprisoned terrorist
Carlos the Jackal, Saddam Hussein and, of course, Fidel Castro. Amongst the
gringo masses, this side of Chavez is rather less well-known.&quot; (08/23/07)

Crockett think? As best I can tell, Homeland Security thought, or pretended
to think, that a wily terrorist might put a bomb in the trash cans. So they
built blast-proof cans after taking out the vulnerable old cans. Some
company made a fortune supplying them, Homeland Security being a richly

33) Gun lobby Or smart citizens?

Carey posed a question about gun control to the contestant: what percentage
of Americans believe that Americans should be allowed to own automatic
weapons? The answer was 41%. I watched the show and the audience applauded.
If, as Drew notes from time to time, that the Poll was conducted of New
Yorkers, man, am I impressed! The significance is that on the question of
'automatic weapons,' the finding is not 1 or 2 percent or even 10 or 20
percent, but a thriving 41%.&quot; (08/23/07)

&quot;When it comes to America's criminal justice policy, the cure is often worse

which has inflicted more social damage than drugs themselves. So too with
the war on gangs, according to a report by the Justice Policy Institute,
released this July. The conclusion of the 108-page report is evident in its
title, 'Gang Wars: The Failure of Enforcement Tactics and the Need for
Effective Public Safety Strategies.' Written by Judith Greene and Kevin
Pranis, the report persuasively argues that punitive policies of policing
that specifically target gangs increase rather than decrease gang violence.&quot;

&quot;Four major U.S. banks on Wednesday proudly announced they had borrowed $500
million each from the Federal Reserve's discount window. A few weeks ago,
borrowing from the discount window would have been seen as an act of
desperation. Now it's being promoted as an act of patriotism: a way to
grease the nation's stuck credit wheels and help restore calm in the capital
markets. The $2 billion in loans was more window dressing than window
borrowing, but it -- along with other moves -- seemed to have a salutary
effect. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 145.27 points or 1.1 percent
to 13,236.13 Wednesday. The yield on the three-month Treasury bill rose to
3.56 percent from 3.51 percent on Tuesday.&quot; [editor's note: No matter what

(which I abbreviate for reasons of space) from Charles Dickens's Oliver
Twist. In it, the plucky young hero has been chosen by the other boys to ask
the managers of the poorhouse in which they're locked up to increase their
daily servings of gruel, lest they starve.&quot; [editor's note: Despite Mr.

40) Taxpayers putting in their two cents worth
Nashville City Paper
by Steve Gill

&quot;The penny is not what is used to be. Congress 25 years ago eliminated most
of the copper from the coin due to a big spike in the cost of the metal.
Since then, zinc has been the main ingredient -- over 97% -- with copper
being limited to a thin coating into which Abraham Lincoln's face in
engraved. Now, with the price of zinc soaring, it costs taxpayers over
1.7cents to make each 1-cent coin. In other words, it costs nearly
twice as
much to make a penny as the thing is worth. The U.S. Mint cranks out roughly
8 billion new ones each year to the tune of well over $100 million annually.
(Each nickel also costs about 10 cents in production costs, by the way.) Can
you imagine a company continuing to manufacture a product that costs twice
as much to produce as it can charge for the product?&quot; (08/23/07)

41) How to challenge Iran's militancy without using arms
Christian Science Monitor

&quot;There have been persistent rumors in Washington that President Bush does
not want to leave office without 'doing something' about Iran. Even more
alarming, there have been rumors that Mr. Bush has solicited a green light
from Russian President Vladimir Putin for Israel to 'do something' about
Iran. One of the central problems with the Bush administration is that it
thinks military first and sometimes military only -- with disastrous results
for America. Though military action is an option, the consequences of the
United States or Israel attacking Iran would be catastrophic. Fortunately,
the American people do not want this to happen. Only 10 percent approve of a
military confrontation with Iran, according to a CBS/New York Times poll in
March, and most worry about America's troubled relationship with the Muslim
world. A large majority are concerned that the Iraq war is destroying
America's international reputation. They do not want to make matters worse.&quot;

what really makes it work is a system of government subsidies and

47) Deadly lockdown in New Orleans
Salon
by Robin Templeton

&quot;New Orleans has the highest incarceration rate of any major U.S. city --
double the national rate. Louisiana also locks up more people in local jails
than any state, in part because of state laws, unheard of in other parts of
the country, that paralyze due process. District attorneys have 60 days from
the time of arrest to decide whether to press charges and typically use the
full statutory time limit. From there, it takes an average of three months
for detainees to get a court date. It can take up to three years to get to
trial. According to a recent study by the Vera Institute of Justice, 40
percent of those entering the Orleans Parish Prison would qualify to be
released on their own recognizance. Instead, the city opts to lock people up
if they can't post bail, which is true of three-quarters of the jail's
detainees. While it was bad before the storm, 'now the system is only
working to pick people up,' says Loyola Law School professor Bill Quigley.
'It's a vacuum, sucking poor people in and keeping them in. Being arrested
now equals being sent to prison.'&quot; (08/23/07)

48) Epidemic of ignorance
National Review

&quot;Last week I went shopping in our small rural hometown, where my family has
attended the same public schools since 1896. Without exception, all six
generations of us -- whether farmers, housewives, day laborers, business
people, writers, lawyers, or educators -- were given a good, competitive
K-12 education. But after a haircut, I noticed that the 20-something cashier
could not count out change. The next day, at the electronic outlet store,
another young clerk could not read -- much less explain -- the basic English
of the buyer's warranty. At the food market, I listened as a young couple
argued over the price of a cut of tri-tip -- unable to calculate the meat's
real value from its price per pound. As another school year is set to get
under way, it's worth pondering where this epidemic of ignorance came from.&quot;

The Power of Narrative
by Arthur Silber

&quot;Almost all of our public debate is conducted on the first level of
analysis: what various political leaders say their goals and objectives are.
In terms of those stated goals, their decisions in foreign policy are
uniformly calamitous, and they lead to results that are the opposite of what
they claim they hope to achieve. No public figure will admit the truth of
the second kind of analysis and, I regret to note, most Americans are not
the least bit interested in hearing such unpleasant truths. Nonetheless,
they are truths: a huge swath of our economy is now devoted to preparing for
war, making war, and cleaning up after war. To one degree or another, most
members of Congress are beholden to the economic powers that drive the
obsessive concern with war, and its cornucopia of economic opportunity. Both
parties are enmeshed in the War State, and the current corporatist warmaking
apparatus devours almost all those who go into public service. Until this
intricate and complex system is altered, nothing else will change, except in
comparatively superficial ways.&quot; (08/22/07)

&quot;Bonuses at hedge funds and Wall Street firms are a topic of obsession in

billion payday for a top hedge-fund manager like James Simons of Renaissance
Technologies, bonuses are important economic leading indicators for New
York-area real estate brokers, art dealers, and gold diggers of all types.
The ritual reporting of bonuses provokes envy in some (fellow graduates of
MBA programs that are doing well, but not so well), and self-loathing in
many (Phi Beta Kappa grads who chose to go into anthropology instead of
finance). In recent years, the only question surrounding bonuses has been:

&quot;At the most recent G-8, one of the few substantive outcomes was the
commitment to increase funding for AIDS to $60 billion. Before the Summit,
President Bush announced his plans for a doubling of AIDS funding for,
mainly, Africa. His plan -- called PEPFAR -- will be increased to $30
billion. Although criticism has come from AIDS activists who want more, both
houses of Congress and both sides of the aisle are praising this initiative
so it looks like a done deal. However no one in the US government and few in
the anti-AIDS community are dealing with a major issue in the transmission
of AIDS called 'property stripping.' Since the cure for property stripping
is cheap, technically quite easy and would have an enormous secondary impact
on economic growth (poverty is a hidden vector of AIDS) it would seem like a
sure thing for attention. But it is virtually ignored.&quot; (08/23/07)

&quot;For nearly half a century, the United States has maintained an economic

dictator, however, has easily outlasted a succession of American presidents
bent on his political demise. Even today, with the dictator incapacitated by
poor health, his regime looks more durable than the British monarchy. A
plausible conclusion is that if our boycott didn't achieve its purpose in
the 20th century, it will not do so in the 21st. Yet it remains firmly in
place, unchallenged by either Republicans or Democrats. The other day, Sen.
Barack Obama (D-Ill.) reopened the discussion of Cuba policy with an op-ed
column in The Miami Herald that accused President Bush of 'blundering,'
stressed the need to 'help the Cuban people become less dependent on the
Castro regime,' and promised to 'grant Cuban Americans unrestricted rights
to visit family and send remittances to the island.' This may sound like a
bold and refreshing attempt to overhaul our Cuba policy. In fact, it's a
cheerful embrace of a strategy that has proved its futility year after

post-graduation debt levels, 2008 Presidential campaign rhetoric is rife
with promises of more federal aid for college students. Expressing
widespread liberal sentiment, Barack Obama's stance is that the government
should 'guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, life-long,
top-notch education, from early childhood to high school -- from college to
on-the-job training.' Obama has also floated the idea of giving all students
who maintain a B average a guaranteed, taxpayer-funded college education.&quot;

65) A pyrrhic victory?
Liberty For All
by Stephen Burr

&quot;I've long said that the only difference nowadays between the Democrats and
Republicans is one of degree, and how quickly you want to see your freedoms
taken away from you. It's no wonder the BCRA passed with a significant
number of Republicans supporting it. But insomuch as party politics means
anything anymore when it comes to the Big 2, I do believe that the Democrats
are going to be in for a nasty surprise as the true ramifications of this
legislation become known.&quot; (written 12/03; posted 08/23/07)
