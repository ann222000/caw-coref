Have been feeling much better about quitting and have had many fewer
craves and none very strong..Until today~~
(In a 'crisis' and wanting to go buy a pack of smokes and blame the
person who is hurting me.)
I know I'll be sorry later..if I do...So I'm trying not to 'cave'.

Many Congrats Mari on 7 Months as a non-smoker ;-)
This 'crave' sounds more like anger related, need to find a new way of
coping..... deep breaths... pummel a pillow.... call out the BDU ???
Post here?  Read here?  Have you a favourite distraction game?
See you can do this......

Sometimes Nicodemon seems to tap you on the shoulder near a milestone?

SEVEN MONTHS is MMMMMMMagnificent ;o)

Cheers

Mari!! First huge congratulations on 7 months. Second, noone can make
you smoke. If someone is being a jerk, do not give them any sort of
power over you. Saying someone is hurting you and blaming them for
smoking is junkie thinking. Be strong. You can do it.

Dear Mari-

Happy 7 MMMMMMM's! It sure sounds like you are having a milestone crave!
A prior signature that I had here (possibly from 2004 when I was
active here) was "Cravings are not instructions giving you permission to
smoke!  Cravings are just memories."

Keep up the good work and don't let anyone steal your thunder lady.

Hugs,
robbster

OK.  Blame the person who is hurting you for hurting you.  Do *not*
blame the person who is hurting you for you slipping off your quit -
if you don't - and you won't - because I say so.  So there!!!

Mari

Please stay strong and don't give in. I know how you feel because I had a
moment, well a bit longer than a moment but I had a moment like that tonight
in what I thought was the end of the world and I BADLY craved a cigaroonie
and I didnt care about the consequences at that moment in time I just
wasnted a smoke hug and I believe if they'd been in the house then I
probably would have but hey lets be honest it wouldnt have helped. I'd still
be having a lot of money go out of my account through a scam that scammed me
tonight, the only difference would be I'd be smoking as well and then be
kicking myself for caving. I think what I'm trying to say is smoking won't
help hun so dont do it.

April

Mari,

You have done so very well. 7 months is to be proud
of and would be awful to lose.
Someone is hurting you? That sucks.

The nico-demon is very sneaky just waiting for any opening. 7 months was a
particularly touchy time for me, I caved while feeling very good about my
effort.
What the hell was I thinking, not really sure because there is no reason
when it comes to addiction other than satisfying that itch. You've come this
far stay strong you'll be glad you did.

If someone is hurting you, don't give him the satisfaction
of you hurting yourself too.

Mari!  Congrats on the Seven Months!  As everyone else has said, don't
let this person get to you to the point that you give up on yourself
and smoke.  That was sort of what happened with my 3 year quit back in
2001 and it's taken me way too long to get back here.  Hang tuff,
don't puff and know that we are all behind you with the BDU in tow.

(((Mari))) It's OK to crave. It's the way we fight ourselves to
freedom. Just don't smoke and come out stronger at the other
end of this. No matter how much you smoke, it will not take
away the hurt and you know it. Stay strong,
Robin.
