Atle Selberg, a mathematician whose theoretical work on the properties
of numbers was recognized with the Fields Medal and other major
prizes, died Aug. 6 at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 90.

The cause was heart failure, his family said.

As a young mathematician, Dr. Selberg was first widely recognized for
a major contribution to the study of prime numbers, which are evenly
divisible only by 1 and themselves.

Mathematicians had already proved a fundamental theorem describing the
distribution of prime numbers among whole numbers. In 1948, he and
Paul Erdos, a prominent Hungarian mathematician, each came up with key
concepts in developing a simpler version of the proof and avoiding
analytical techniques involving complex numbers. However, the two
squabbled for years over the apportionment of credit for the proof.
Dr. Selberg published his proof in the Annals of Mathematics in 1949.

In 1950, the International Mathematical Union cited Dr. Selberg's
proof and other work in awarding him the Fields Medal, often called
the Nobel Prize of mathematics, which cites promising mathematicians
40 or younger. The next year, Dr. Selberg was named a professor of
mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he
continued his research for the rest of his career.

Dr. Selberg also developed the Selberg trace formula, which relates
the geometry of certain types of surfaces to the frequencies at which
they can vibrate, somewhat like the way the shape of a drum determines
the sounds it can make. The formula was a keystone in modern research
in number theory and related fields, and led to discoveries of
unexpected and subtle connections between the properties of numbers,
especially prime numbers, and those of geometric surfaces. He
explained the formula in a 1956 paper that was published in the
Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.

J. Brian Conrey, a number theorist and executive director of the
American Institute of Mathematics, said the trace formula became a
fundamental lever that &quot;opened the door to whole other fields of
mathematical analysis.&quot;

Because of the high level of abstraction inherent in his kind of
research, Dr. Selberg expressed concern that specialists in the field
could become isolated from their peers and the public. &quot;Where there is
a high degree of involvement in something that seems too remote from
everyday life, there may sometimes emerge a type of person somewhat
out of touch with reality,&quot; he said in an interview in The New York
Times in 1966. &quot;Or at least with what other people consider reality.&quot;

In visits to the American Institute of Mathematics in Palo Alto,
Calif., he liked to gather mathematicians together for lunch,
conversation and a spirited game of boccie, Dr. Conrey said.

In the 1940s, he developed a powerful method for separating nonprime
numbers from prime numbers. Such methods, called sieves, date back to
Eratosthenes of Cyrene, a scholar in the third century B.C. In the
sieve of Eratosthenes, one sifts out the prime numbers by crossing out
higher multiples of a prime number. For example, 2 is prime, but that
means higher multiples of 2 (that is, 4, 6, 8, etc.) are not prime
since they are divisible by 2.

Dr. Selberg's sieve, which assigns a score to each number in a way
that prime numbers tend to have high scores and nonprime numbers low
scores, &quot;remains perhaps the most powerful sieving method known&quot; and
&quot;is still very much a modern tool,&quot; said Peter Sarnak, a professor of
mathematics at both Princeton University and the Institute for
Advanced Study.

The son of a mathematician, Atle Selberg (his first name was
pronounced AHT-luh) was born in Langesund, Norway. He received his
doctorate in mathematics from the University of Oslo in 1943.

In 1986, Dr. Selberg shared the Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics
with Samuel Eilenberg.

He retired from the institute in 1987, and became an American citizen
in the 1990s.

Dr. Selberg is survived by his wife, the former Betty Compton. His
first wife, Hedvig Liebermann, a researcher at the institute and
Princeton's Plasma Physics Laboratory, died in 1995.

He is also survived by a son, Lars, of Middlefield, Conn.; a daughter,
Ingrid, of London; and four grandchildren.

Mathematician Atle Selberg; Won Fields Medal

By Martin Weil
Washington Post Staff Writer

Atle Selberg, 90, who was known as one of the great mathematicians of
the 20th century and was a winner of the Fields Medal, which is often
considered the Nobel Prize of mathematics, died Aug. 6 at his home in
Princeton, N.J. He had a heart ailment.

Since 1949, Dr. Selberg had been associated continuously with the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, the former academic home of
Albert Einstein and one of the most prestigious of American scholarly
institutions.

The institute's director, Peter Goddard, described Dr. Selberg as &quot;a
mathematical giant&quot; and said in a statement that &quot;his far-reaching
contributions have left a profound imprint on the world of mathematics.&quot;

Peter Sarnak, a professor at the institute's School of Mathematics,
said in the statement released by the institute that Dr. Selberg &quot;was
a mathematician's mathematician.&quot;

Dr. Selberg possessed &quot;a golden touch&quot; and prepared the way for many
future findings, Sarnak said.

The area in which Dr. Selberg specialized was analytic number theory.
In the simplest terms, number theory can be described as the study of
the properties of the integers, which include the common numbers
employed in daily life.

But modern number theory has reached a level of complexity and
abstraction that places full appreciation of its achievements beyond
the capacity of all but a few.

&quot;I don't think that other people have had grave difficulties
understanding my work,&quot; Dr. Selberg said in 1990. In its statement,
the institute said he maintained &quot;an understated view&quot; of his
accomplishments.

The Fields Medal was awarded to Dr. Selberg for his work on proving a
challenging theory about the distribution of prime numbers. For years,
mathematicians had believed that it could be proved only by the
laborious application of ponderous techniques. In 1949, Dr. Selberg
and another celebrated mathematician, Paul Erdos, achieved a proof
through techniques of startling simplicity.

Each, it was reported, was to report on his own contribution in the
same issue of the same mathematics journal. Because of what has been
described as a misunderstanding that led to hurt feelings, Dr. Selberg
published first. His Fields Medal, recognizing him for a variety of
accomplishments, followed.

Dr. Selberg was born June 14, 1917, in Langesund, Norway, the youngest
child of a mother who was a teacher and a father who was himself a
mathematician.

An equation found in one of his father's books inflamed Dr. Selberg's
mathematical curiosity at the age of 13. It showed a way of expressing
{pi}/ 4, in which pi is the celebrated irrational number designating
the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

Dr. Selberg was determined to learn what produced &quot;such a very strange
and beautiful relationship.&quot;

Later, he said, he was strongly influenced by &quot;remarkable, strange and
beautiful&quot; formulas in the works of Srinivasa Ramanujan, the
brilliant, largely self-taught Indian-born mathematician who made
important contributions to number theory.

In a talk given in India to honor the 100th anniversary of Ramanujan's
birth, Dr. Selberg noted the difficulties Ramanujan had suffered in an
&quot;inflexible and rigid educational system.&quot;

This, Dr. Selberg said, showed that schools should know when to make
exceptions. At all levels, he said, &quot;allowances should be made for the
unusual and perhaps lopsidedly gifted child with very strong interests
in one direction.&quot;

Dr. Selberg's first wife, Hedvig, died in 1995. Survivors include his
second wife, Betty Compton Selberg; two children from his first
marriage; two stepdaughters; and four grandchildren.
