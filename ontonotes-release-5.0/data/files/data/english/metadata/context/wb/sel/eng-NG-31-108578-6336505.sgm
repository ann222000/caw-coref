Ok, so i got my echo results back... and it was after the doc sent me
for one after finding possible LVH in my EKG's and having tachycardia..
of anywhere between 120-158 bpm's, and palpitations.. shortness of
breath.

the echo came back negative for LVH though. now, on some of it, they
couldnt get a "good visualization" of certain parts of the heart. could
this mean a possible ling issue causing problems seeing? or my body
itself? it makes no sense tho, because the other things they could see
okay.. but not these other ones? huh?

heres some of the results i typed up:

*******echo test

echo results:

M-Mode results:
LV Diameter (Diastole) (3.7 - 5.4 cm) = 4.3
LV Diameter (systole) = 2.1
Septal Thickness (Diastole) (0.1 - 1.1cm) = 0.4
LV Posterior Wall (Diastole) (0.7cm - 1.1 cm) = 0.4
LA Diameter (Systole) (0.9 - 4.0 cm) = 2.4
Aortic Root Diameter (2.0 - 3.7 cm) = 2.4
Visualized ascending aorta diameter = 2.1
RV Diamater (Diastole) (0.5 - 2.5 cm) = 1.8
Aortic Cusp Separation = 1.6

Echo summary:

Echo summary:
Overall left ventricular function is hyperdynamic. No significant
valvular stenosis or insufficiencies. Technically difficult study due
to patients body habitus.

Left Atrium:
The left astrium is normal.

Mitral valve:
The Mitral valve is normal. Mitral valve prolapse is not noted. By
color/pulse wave/continuous wave doppler mitral regurgitation is trace.
There is no mitral stenosis.

Right atrium:
The right atrium is normal.

Tricuspid Valve:
The tricuspid valve is normal. By color/continuous wave doppler
tricuspid regurgitation is physiologic. There is no evidence of
pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonic Valve:
The pulmonic valve is not well visualized. By continuous wave doppler
significant pulmonic valve stenosis is not demonstrated.

Pulmonary trunk and Arteries:
The pulmonary trunk and arteries are not well visualized.

Aorta:
The aortic root dimension is normal. The ascending proximal thoracic
aorta is normal in dimension. The aortic valve is not well visualized.
By continuous/pulse wave doppler no aortic stenosis is present. By
color/continuous wave doppler no aortic regurgitation is present.

Aortic arch:
The aortic arch is not well visualized.

Rght ventricle:
The right ventrical is normal.

Left ventricle:
The left ventrical is normal in size. There is no left ventricular
hypertrophy present. No regional wall motion abnormalities are present.
Overall left ventricular function is hyperdynamic. The estimated LVEF
is 70%. By continuous/pulse wave doppler diastolic dysfunction is not
suggested.

Pericardial Effusion:
There is no pericardial perfusion.

Intracavitary Mass:
There is no evidence for intracavitary mass.

Congenital findings:
By color/pulse wave doppler there is no evidence in this study for
ASD/PFO.

---------------

Stress test:

resting echocardiogram:
Hyperdynamic LV function.

Stress ECG revealed non-specific ST-T wave changes. There were no ECG
changes diagnostic for ischemia.

Was 130/80 before stress test. went down to 120/80 after.

BPM: 158 BPM

That is a high resting heart rate.  Because your LV is reportedly
hyperdynamic, would suspect a chronic high output state such as
thyrotoxicosis or anemia.

yes, they did blood tests.. and im not anemic.. nor do i have any
thyroid problem. they tested me after i had the echo done to make sure.
just got these results given to me today, actually.

they want me to see an electrophysiologist... due to the holter
readings i had, found 117 skipped beats.
and the tachycardia. she seems to think my hearts just hypersensitive
to.. adrenaline, or stress.. or hormones... because i have some
hormonal disorders. otherwise.. at times.. when feeling okay.. and
calm, my BPM will actually be normal. anywhere between 80 and 90.

they wanna try me on toprol for a while, too. 25mg.

thanks for the reply!!

The thickness of the wall between the left and right ventricles.  It
would serve as a marker of scarring when the ejection fraction is down,
which is not applicable in your case.

Thankyou again for your reply.

I have some other questions to ask... based on my tests. My cardio wont
be back till next monday (again), shes only there every monday, other
times, shes at another place, doesnt return calls, or even let me ask
questions half the time without having an attitude, lol (and well i
think im gonna have to see a different cardio.. )

So, okay.. lol.. here we go.

Whats the difference between LVH and Cardiomyopathy exactly? they'd be
clearly able to see LV Cardiomyopathy on an echo if i had that? and
based on what i posted.. does anything else seem evident that perhaps
that could be there?

also, on my 24 hour holter reading.. it picked up these:

"  ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 117 beats, of which, 2
were in couplets, 74 were single PVC's, and 41 were VE's.

Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted  of 1 PAC. "

she says missed beats and such like these are.. normal? i wanted to ask
her all about these, but, like i said.. she didnt have the time and
pretty much flicked me off.

what would youo make of those?

again, thankyou so much for your replies and your taking time to answer
these.

LVH stands for left ventricular hypertrophy which means there is a
thickening of the walls of the left ventricle.  Your echocardiogram
indicates that this is not the case for you.

Cardiomyopathy is a more general term that simply mean heart muscle
problem.

No red flags for me.

It is possible that you feel nearly every one of your missed beats and
that the only way to getting you feeling better is to keep you from
having them by figuring out what has changed to cause you to now either
have more or to feel them more.

it also says on my stress echo report that during the stress
electrocardiogram, as i was on the tradmill...this:

"Stress electrocardiogram":

"Stress ECG revealed non-specific ST-T wave changes. There were no ECG
changes diagnostic for ischemia."

I'm assuming they mean the actual ELECTROcardiogram they gave me as
they were doing the stress echo.
What could this mean whole St-T wave thing mean, exactly?

On my EKG (electro)  that I had in the office a week prior to this
stress echo, had these notes written on the sheet:

1. early transition - RsR Mv2 -? mild RV strain
2. NSST D
3. Borderline RAE

What are those?

Sorry for all the questions.

oh, and i forgot to add...  on the final impressions note, the doctor
writes:

"No evidence of ischemia by clinical, ECG or echo criteria.
Deconditioned. tachycardia present before and after the test. Possible
hyperventilating. No significant valvular or flow abnormalities. A full
doppler-echo was performed on this date. " etc etc

that sounds rather.. contradictory to the other thing?

&gt; &gt; What could this mean whole St-T wave thing mean, exactly?

Would have to see your actual tracing to know what exactly was being
described.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; On my EKG (electro)  that I had in the office a week prior to this
&gt; &gt; stress echo, had these notes written on the sheet:

&gt; &gt; 1. early transition - RsR Mv2 -? mild RV strain
&gt; &gt; 2. NSST D
&gt; &gt; 3. Borderline RAE

&gt; &gt; What are those?

Changes we sometimes see in folks with chronic recurrent subacute
pulmonary embolic events (small clots going to the lung).

Actually, those who don't ask questions are the ones that typically end
up being sorry.

RAE stands for Right Atrial Enlargement.

NSSTW (Delta) stands for Non-Specific ST and T Wave Changes

RSR' in V2 describes a particular appearance of the QRS wave in EKG

Odd though, in the echo, it shows my right atrium and ventrical are
both "Normal" and "Normal size".
Could these st-t and RAE and RsR abnormalities on the EKG have been a
false positive... and could have been brought on by the tachycardia
making it appear this way? because as i was having the EKG done, my BPM
was 118 at that time, it says. 15 mins later it went up to 154.

however, the echo showed a trace of mitral regurgitation , then it also
said the tricuspid regurgitation is physiologic. so i have two things
regurgitating here? from my studies and research, tricuspid
regurgitation can be a sign of right atrial enlargment as well..
(backing up the EKG's possible findings..)

I remember looking over at the Echo on the screen and seeing the
ventricles clearly, and the blue and red coloring flow... but recall
the very top being very hard to see. I was also on an odd angle, but i
remember trying to see if i could see the aorta or something, out of
curiosity (always been fascinated by that stuff).. and really couldnt
at all.

Thankyou for your replies. I've since been doing a lot of reading
tonight on this type of a thing and just seems like something these
idiot doctors of mine should have at least brought up to at least rule
out.
I'm a believer that this kind of crap doesn't just show up for no
reason...

Also, when I first started noticing the symptoms that initially sent me
to the doctor.. happened on december 4th. i was at work and i work with
animals at a vet hospital and ended up getting pulled by a huge dog i
was restraining with a leash.. and ended up getting slammed into a
bunch of stuff and pretty much went flying across the room. my left
leg.. that was the worst hit, (lower leg.. above the area that connect
the foot and lower leg, directly in the front) is STILL swollen in that
area and sore to the touch. there is still very minor bruising that can
be seen in very bright lighting. a greenish, yellow, very faint color
to it. the gash mark is still there. the night after this happened, i
was having severe pain in the entire leg.
but, then later all over my body. i have an un-specified auto-immune
disease that apparently causes a lot of deep aching all over my body,
feeling flu-like.. almost all the time, especially during my periods. i
actually began my period that very same day. go figure.

the symptoms started the next day actually. my chest hurt horribly..
back.. everywhere. had mass amounts of gas, like i had never ever had
before. in my esophagus... stomach intetsines.. burping constantly.
hard to swallow, i could feel everything bulging.. i could barely sit
right for days after that. the heart palpitations started, pretty much
the following day after that. heart flutters.. felt like it was
skipping. never had that in my life like that. started feeling dizzy..
hands looked like they were very close to cyanotic.. face looked rather
odd colored. people saying i looked sick. could barely eat or drink
anything due to the strange amounts of "air" or gas in my body.. eso..
and stomach.
my neck started feeling strange later that 2nd night.. on the left
side. felt a flutter feeling there as well and felt like a lot of
pressure there. my mom made a comment that my neck actually looked
swollen.. slightly..
this went on and on. i called the doctor.. couldnt get an appointment
till the following monday.
went.. and my BPM was 125 and blood pressure was 120/80 (my normal..
well high normal) . listened to my heart and claimed it was beatingn
super fast yet he didnt hear the murmur i was born with.
he checked my neck and the thyroid thing.. and said that seemed fine
and thyroid was not palpable, etc.
ordered the blood tests (which all came back normal), and set me up
with the cardiologist after he did an EKG and it was showing strains
and simply just said it was "A very.. very strange EKG".
so, i managed to get an early appointment the following monday from
then (or else id have to wait till february)..
i mentioned to the doctor about my fall  and the cardiologist as well,
and they didnt even seem to think it was related. uh huh. i was having
symptoms id never had in my life happen after that fall!
my lungs felt tight as if i had some muscle strain inside.. if there
were such a thing, and trapped air in them.. and a inflamed kind of a
feeling.. that i dont think was a deep chest wall muscle or tissue
feeling.
im very in tune with my body and well have shitloads of symptoms from
the other stuff that becomes a daily thing.. yet.. this was something
totally alien to me.

so, i see the cardio.. they do another EKG.. same stuff. possible LVH
(that she later scribbled out as RAE.. hmm) . she kept going  on and on
about the LVH tho.. (only to change it to RAE?? alrighty...)
didnt even let me finish my story about the fall, pretty much cut me
off left and right. i was feeling like crap and didnt even feel like
dealing with it. i just wanted to echocardiogram done... and this was
my only chance of getting soemthing done soon.. or else anywhere else..
itd be a different story.

so, she ordered the holter and the stress echo for later in the week..
and all this was showing up...

so... who knows.

im really wondering if that fall REALLY did have soemthing to do with
this.

since then.. ive been ok. the air buildup everywhere subsided.. the
tingling in my hands and feet went away.. dizziness subsided.. lung
feeling.. yet i feel a coughy kind of a feeling deep down my throat
sometimes. but the tachy is still there but not as bad. if i get
slightly nervous or go to stand up.. it'll start racing. other times,
its fairly ok. this latest bout got worse after my last period.. (my
2nd since the fall).. which was lastweek.

so, im calling my family doctor tomorrow.. gonna get an appointment,
hopefully this week! im sick of the waiting crap. demand i have a CT or
MRI... and im gonna raise hell about this.

wish me luck.

&gt; &gt; &gt; and could have been brought on by the tachycardia
&gt; &gt; &gt; making it appear this way?

&gt; &gt; No.

&gt; &gt; &gt; because as i was having the EKG done, my BPM
&gt; &gt; &gt; was 118 at that time, it says. 15 mins later it went up to 154.

&gt; &gt; Perhaps your doctor(s) should reconsider the possibility of pulmonary
&gt; &gt; emboli.

&gt; &gt; &gt; however, the echo showed a trace of mitral regurgitation , then it also
&gt; &gt; &gt; said the tricuspid regurgitation is physiologic. so i have two things
&gt; &gt; &gt; regurgitating here?

&gt; &gt; Yes.  However such regurgitation is not clinically significant.

&gt; &gt; &gt; from my studies and research, tricuspid
&gt; &gt; &gt; regurgitation can be a sign of right atrial enlargment as well..
&gt; &gt; &gt; (backing up the EKG's possible findings..)

&gt; &gt; Clinically significant tricuspid regurgitation can lead to right atrial
&gt; &gt; enlargement.  However, your tricuspid regurgitation has not been
&gt; &gt; characterized as such.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I remember looking over at the Echo on the screen and seeing the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ventricles clearly, and the blue and red coloring flow... but recall
&gt; &gt; &gt; the very top being very hard to see. I was also on an odd angle, but i
&gt; &gt; &gt; remember trying to see if i could see the aorta or something, out of
&gt; &gt; &gt; curiosity (always been fascinated by that stuff).. and really couldnt
&gt; &gt; &gt; at all.

&gt; &gt; It takes a trained eye to see structures on an echocardiogram.

&gt; Thankyou for your replies.

A radiologist should be consulted about how best to detect a small
peripheral pulmonary embolus suspected to have occurred on 12/05/2006.

Would suggest you print out this post and hand it to your family
doctor.

so, if this is the case... and my possible first... can this be easily
treated?
ive read things about blood thinners, etc.. but.. are these actually
enough to fix the problem?

also, i just remembered... my grandmom, on my mom's side... had deep
vein thrombosis in her legs.. and one was considered so severe they
were scared to even operate on it. though, this was way back, too.
my grandmom, on my dads side... just died in may of a massive massive
stroke.. and had some other clotting issues.

my mom.. has moderate-severe vein issues in her legs (varicose and
others).. and pretty much has since her 20's. my aunt, on my dads
side... varicose.. my other aunt had a severe clot in her leg and had
surgery...

yeah..

its rather concerning. especially this EKG thing, which she failed to
even tell me about the other things.

you've helped out a lot!

its just when i feel something is wrong.. despite what they tell me..
im gonna go with my own gut feeling. i knew something wasnt right.
nothing added up, either.. then seeing that EKG.. it baffles me how the
doc hasnt said a word about this.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it didnt look like anything, why would they have to downplay it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your EKG was nonetheless abnormal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Changes we sometimes see in folks with chronic recurrent subacute

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what exactly do each of those things i mentioned stand for exactly?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RAE stands for Right Atrial Enlargement.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NSSTW (Delta) stands for Non-Specific ST and T Wave Changes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RSR' in V2 describes a particular appearance of the QRS wave in EKG
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lead V2

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and how on earth could they have ruled out pulmonary issues and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hypertension if they couoldnt even see my pulmonary arteries and trunk?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your history and physical exam may have lowered their clinical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suspicion for pulmonary emboli.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, those who don't ask questions are the ones that typically end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up being sorry.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, apparently my cardiologist seems to see a sin in asking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions..

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sad to read about your difficulties with your cardiologist.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thanks again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You are welcome :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Odd though, in the echo, it shows my right atrium and ventrical are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both &quot;Normal&quot; and &quot;Normal size&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However, the echo is a &quot;technically difficult study&quot; so that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; measurements may be off.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Could these st-t and RAE and RsR abnormalities on the EKG have been a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; false positive...

&gt; &gt; &gt; No.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and could have been brought on by the tachycardia
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making it appear this way?

&gt; &gt; &gt; No.

&gt; &gt; Medicine is an art.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm a believer that this kind of crap doesn't just show up for no
&gt; &gt; &gt; reason...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, when I first started noticing the symptoms that initially sent me
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the doctor.. happened on december 4th. i was at work and i work with
&gt; &gt; &gt; animals at a vet hospital and ended up getting pulled by a huge dog i
&gt; &gt; &gt; was restraining with a leash.. and ended up getting slammed into a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of stuff and pretty much went flying across the room. my left
&gt; &gt; &gt; leg.. that was the worst hit, (lower leg.. above the area that connect
&gt; &gt; &gt; the foot and lower leg, directly in the front) is STILL swollen in that
&gt; &gt; &gt; area and sore to the touch. there is still very minor bruising that can
&gt; &gt; &gt; be seen in very bright lighting. a greenish, yellow, very faint color
&gt; &gt; &gt; to it. the gash mark is still there. the night after this happened, i
&gt; &gt; &gt; was having severe pain in the entire leg.
&gt; &gt; &gt; but, then later all over my body. i have an un-specified auto-immune
&gt; &gt; &gt; disease that apparently causes a lot of deep aching all over my body,
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling flu-like.. almost all the time, especially during my periods. i
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually began my period that very same day. go figure.

&gt; &gt; Folks with autoimmune disorders tend to be hypercoagulable predisposing
&gt; &gt; them to forming clots in the deep veins of their legs especially when
&gt; &gt; there has been trauma to their legs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the symptoms started the next day actually. my chest hurt horribly..
&gt; &gt; &gt; back.. everywhere. had mass amounts of gas, like i had never ever had
&gt; &gt; &gt; before. in my esophagus... stomach intetsines.. burping constantly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard to swallow, i could feel everything bulging.. i could barely sit
&gt; &gt; &gt; right for days after that. the heart palpitations started, pretty much
&gt; &gt; &gt; the following day after that. heart flutters.. felt like it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; skipping. never had that in my life like that. started feeling dizzy..
&gt; &gt; &gt; hands looked like they were very close to cyanotic.. face looked rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; odd colored. people saying i looked sick. could barely eat or drink
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything due to the strange amounts of &quot;air&quot; or gas in my body.. eso..
&gt; &gt; &gt; and stomach.

&gt; &gt; Sounds like a pulmonary embolus may very well have occurred for you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; my neck started feeling strange later that 2nd night.. on the left
&gt; &gt; &gt; side. felt a flutter feeling there as well and felt like a lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt; pressure there. my mom made a comment that my neck actually looked
&gt; &gt; &gt; swollen.. slightly..

&gt; &gt; Distended neck veins would also be consistent with a pulmonary embolus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; this went on and on. i called the doctor.. couldnt get an appointment
&gt; &gt; &gt; till the following monday.
&gt; &gt; &gt; went.. and my BPM was 125 and blood pressure was 120/80 (my normal..
&gt; &gt; &gt; well high normal) . listened to my heart and claimed it was beatingn
&gt; &gt; &gt; super fast yet he didnt hear the murmur i was born with.
&gt; &gt; &gt; he checked my neck and the thyroid thing.. and said that seemed fine
&gt; &gt; &gt; and thyroid was not palpable, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; ordered the blood tests (which all came back normal), and set me up
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the cardiologist after he did an EKG and it was showing strains
&gt; &gt; &gt; and simply just said it was &quot;A very.. very strange EKG&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; so, i managed to get an early appointment the following monday from
&gt; &gt; &gt; then (or else id have to wait till february)..

&gt; &gt; Actually, your story is highly suggestive of your having suffered a
&gt; &gt; pulmonary embolus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; i mentioned to the doctor about my fall  and the cardiologist as well,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and they didnt even seem to think it was related. uh huh. i was having
&gt; &gt; &gt; symptoms id never had in my life happen after that fall!
&gt; &gt; &gt; my lungs felt tight as if i had some muscle strain inside.. if there
&gt; &gt; &gt; were such a thing, and trapped air in them.. and a inflamed kind of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling.. that i dont think was a deep chest wall muscle or tissue
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling.

&gt; &gt; My index of suspicion from what you have written is very high for your
&gt; &gt; having suffered a pulmonary embolus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; im very in tune with my body and well have shitloads of symptoms from
&gt; &gt; &gt; the other stuff that becomes a daily thing.. yet.. this was something
&gt; &gt; &gt; totally alien to me.

&gt; &gt; If what you suffered was a pulmonary embolus, this bit of history would
&gt; &gt; suggest it was your first.

&gt; &gt; &gt; so, i see the cardio.. they do another EKG.. same stuff. possible LVH
&gt; &gt; &gt; (that she later scribbled out as RAE.. hmm) . she kept going  on and on
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the LVH tho.. (only to change it to RAE?? alrighty...)
&gt; &gt; &gt; didnt even let me finish my story about the fall, pretty much cut me
&gt; &gt; &gt; off left and right. i was feeling like crap and didnt even feel like
&gt; &gt; &gt; dealing with it. i just wanted to echocardiogram done... and this was
&gt; &gt; &gt; my only chance of getting soemthing done soon.. or else anywhere else..
&gt; &gt; &gt; itd be a different story.

&gt; &gt; &gt; so, she ordered the holter and the stress echo for later in the week..
&gt; &gt; &gt; and all this was showing up...

&gt; &gt; &gt; so... who knows.

&gt; &gt; &gt; im really wondering if that fall REALLY did have soemthing to do with
&gt; &gt; &gt; this.

&gt; &gt; If you suffered a pulmonary embolus, your fall would have been a
&gt; &gt; contributing factor.

&gt; &gt; &gt; since then.. ive been ok. the air buildup everywhere subsided.. the
&gt; &gt; &gt; tingling in my hands and feet went away.. dizziness subsided.. lung
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling.. yet i feel a coughy kind of a feeling deep down my throat
&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes. but the tachy is still there but not as bad. if i get
&gt; &gt; &gt; slightly nervous or go to stand up.. it'll start racing. other times,
&gt; &gt; &gt; its fairly ok. this latest bout got worse after my last period.. (my
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2nd since the fall).. which was lastweek.

&gt; &gt; &gt; so, im calling my family doctor tomorrow.. gonna get an appointment,

okie doke.

so i went and saw the doc today, and he is setting me up for a VQ scan
of the lungs...

checked my Pulse Ox.. and it was 98. are those things accurate?

my BP was 114/76 and pulse rate was.. 100 (taken by the med assistant)
when i first got in there and when i moved around abit and the doc
checked it and then it spiked up to 120 again.

also, he brought up the Holter test results again.. and im not sure,
but... are these life-threatening? he said they arent normal but also
not life-threatening, but ... seemed rather hesitant on saying it.
though, my cardio said those are all normal. wtf?

"  ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 117 beats, of which, 2
were in couplets, 74 were single PVC's, and 41 were VE's.

Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted  of 1 PAC. "

for the 24 hour holter.

are those life-threatening? is this ormal for all in a 24 hour period?
what exactly are these VE's? and the others?

i wasnt sure because ive been told different things about it.

i was talking to my dad after this, and he said he was diagnosed with
this, too. he has extra and skipped beats... and also has an issue
where he literally feels them every hour. hes been checked and no one
seemed concerned.

he also has a thing where he seems to not be able to take enough deep
breaths. he said he started feeling that way when he was about my age..
25-27.
same as me. been like that for a while. im always taking deep breaths.
i sometimes feel like my lungs are being squashed inside... when im
sitting down or whatever.

thats another thing that baffles me. the EKG shows a right atrial

just seems like.. a lot of things that should be addressed. sadly,

Would suggest that you have your doctor(s) consult with a radiologist
about what in his/her opiinion would be the best test given your
history.

update:

working on getting with a new cardio group and getting a 2nd opinion..
and echo test redone.

one other thing, which i totally left out in my messages before.. is..

ever since i started noticing these extra problems.. back in december..
whenever i lean or lay on my left side.. i get a strange feeling in my
neck... and feel theres 'too much' of something going through... and my
heart will make a heavy "pflumph" feeling. its like a mix of a flutter
and just a gush. like as if it regurgitated something. thats the only
way to really describe it. i can feel it into my throat.

i marked this particular symptom on the holter test diary.. and
supposedly nothing showed up on the holter matching up with that
particular times i had noted these things happening.
i dont think its a skipped beat or a double beat. its like a "gush
splumph" feeling. its hard enough where i can feel it through me most
of the time. it doesnt hurt.. its just strange and annoying and i find
it a pain in the ass sleeping on my left side anymore (which I always
have enjoyed doing) or leaning on my left side when sitting. i always
tend to favor that side.

one night i had shifted to my left, and i woke up from my sleep with my
heart racing and feeling a weird flushy feeling all over my body and my
neck... just a strange feeling and i quickly moved over to my right and
it very quickly subsided. in the beginning, and more so the week
following that fall... i found it difficult to move around in bed.
going from laying down to sitting up.. id feel that gushy thing and
feel like as if the blood was just like a pool inside my chest just all
over. like a swooshy pool inside my heart.

also, when id lean to my left when sitting... id feel my heart slamming
into my chest on the left side as if my heart was taking up my whole
chest cavity and slamming into the side ribs.
i felt like i could literally feel it. and prior to leaning oer, it
wouldnt even be racing. its the sensation of feeling it.

what on earth could that be? the docs seemed to not even give a shit.

Suspect your pulmonary arteries (PAs) are tenser with the higher
pulmonary pressures from the possible PEs so that the sensation of
lying on your left side is from the PAs slamming up on the backside of
the front of your chest.  This can be detected on physical exam by a
sign known as the "PA tap" felt by a hand on your chest while you are
lying partway on your left side.

damn, and the doc never ever did a PA Tap test on me...

another thing, as i was mentioning the week after the fall.. the
numbness,, tingling, clammy hands/skin,.. sickly paleness all over,
lack of color in fingernails.. light-headedness, etc..
all of that has seemed to have gotten better. i mean i still have the
pressures, thumping in chest sometimes, feeling like i cant get a deep
enough breath more than i did before, tachycardias.. but the other
weird symptoms that were keeping me from doing much of anything
properly has calmed down a bit. esepcially the left-sided thing. like i
said, i can now lay and lean on my left side and while it will still
occur (sometimes I can go a couple days with nothing much happening),
its reduced almost 70%. and sometimes wont happen at all. is this a
good sign? or could this mean nothing.. or mean something actually
worse? could the emboli moved on elsewhere? or.. ive heard of people
with PE's actually having days where they'll be fine and then have says
where they're feeling horrible.

my fingers and nails once again look very very very pink and healthy..
and overall, I feel "okay". i still feel a little 'off' this past
week.. but one thing i did notice.. that i hadnt really had the chance
to experience before, is...
like today i ate a lot of salty stuff. and its on occasion that i
over-indulge in the total crap, but... i had a large thing of pepsi, 1
cup o noodle soup (its got a lot of salt in it), for a snack.. late
lunch.. i had a big cheesesteak sandwich (again, lots of salt..).. and
i felt really 'off' after that. pressure around the sides of my ears...
in my neck.. felt a little.. "heavy" in regards to pressures. dont know
what my BP was.. since i dont have access to a BP monitor. i was never
that sensitve to salty things.. an thats not really even...
over-indulging, either..  or extreme really. just felt unlike me..
usually i feel really good after eating stuff like that, LOL. but
overall, i eat healthy. but eating stuff like that isnt a rarity at
all, too. but.. just the response my body had to it... kinda freaked me
out. for i havent really been eating anything that much like that since
last month.. in fears of BP spikes or whatever.
i was feeling alright before it.

i'll let you know how i get along with getting this new cardio. my GP
doc is back tomorrow and i'm going to demand them give me a referral to
a new cardio, unrelated to the group im with now.. (and i called that
cardio twice today! and no call back! as usual! last damn time..)
i just hate the waiting.. for appointments. im guaranteed a 2nd opinion
anyway with my insurance... if its gonna take ages.. im sending myself
to the ER and then theyd have to get me tests done.. without all the
waiting crap. but of course.. thyd most likely look at my results i
already got done and flick it off.. or whatever as usual. you should
have seen the hell we went thru for my mom with her heart problems..
then it later turnded out she had had mltiple heart attacks.. and a
large amount of her hearts dead.. and all kinds of other stuff.. had to
get her to 2 hospitals until they finally figured it out. god..
her BP would go from 200's to.. 100.. to super low, like to the point
of being dangerously low.. and back up again. shes got mass heart
damage.. heart "spasms".. it actually spasms... and other
complications. really sad when these docs cant figure that out.
something pretty obvious.

and then theres the lack of common sense and abilty to put obvious
things together...and lack of hearing the patient out...

Kudos to you for not being like that!!!

gives me some hope!

thanks again.

&gt; &gt; and echo test redone.

&gt; &gt; one other thing, which i totally left out in my messages before.. is..

&gt; &gt; ever since i started noticing these extra problems.. back in december..
&gt; &gt; whenever i lean or lay on my left side.. i get a strange feeling in my
&gt; &gt; neck... and feel theres 'too much' of something going through... and my
&gt; &gt; heart will make a heavy &quot;pflumph&quot; feeling. its like a mix of a flutter
&gt; &gt; and just a gush. like as if it regurgitated something. thats the only
&gt; &gt; way to really describe it. i can feel it into my throat.

&gt; &gt; i marked this particular symptom on the holter test diary.. and
&gt; &gt; supposedly nothing showed up on the holter matching up with that
&gt; &gt; particular times i had noted these things happening.
&gt; &gt; i dont think its a skipped beat or a double beat. its like a &quot;gush
&gt; &gt; splumph&quot; feeling. its hard enough where i can feel it through me most
&gt; &gt; of the time. it doesnt hurt.. its just strange and annoying and i find
&gt; &gt; it a pain in the ass sleeping on my left side anymore (which I always
&gt; &gt; have enjoyed doing) or leaning on my left side when sitting. i always
&gt; &gt; tend to favor that side.

&gt; &gt; one night i had shifted to my left, and i woke up from my sleep with my
&gt; &gt; heart racing and feeling a weird flushy feeling all over my body and my
&gt; &gt; neck... just a strange feeling and i quickly moved over to my right and
&gt; &gt; it very quickly subsided. in the beginning, and more so the week
&gt; &gt; following that fall... i found it difficult to move around in bed.
&gt; &gt; going from laying down to sitting up.. id feel that gushy thing and
&gt; &gt; feel like as if the blood was just like a pool inside my chest just all
&gt; &gt; over. like a swooshy pool inside my heart.

&gt; &gt; also, when id lean to my left when sitting... id feel my heart slamming
&gt; &gt; into my chest on the left side as if my heart was taking up my whole
&gt; &gt; chest cavity and slamming into the side ribs.
&gt; &gt; i felt like i could literally feel it. and prior to leaning oer, it
&gt; &gt; wouldnt even be racing. its the sensation of feeling it.

&gt; &gt; what on earth could that be? the docs seemed to not even give a shit.

&gt; Suspect your pulmonary arteries (PAs) are tenser with the higher
&gt; pulmonary pressures from the possible PEs so that the sensation of
&gt; lying on your left side is from the PAs slamming up on the backside of
&gt; the front of your chest.  This can be detected on physical exam by a
&gt; sign known as the &quot;PA tap&quot; felt by a hand on your chest while you are
&gt; lying partway on your left side.

Well, got the new appointment to the new cardio (and entirely new
cardio group as well) for Monday at 2:30pm!  :)
And the VQ scan referral went through and thats all set, too. Plus, my
doc ordered a whole new set of extra blood tests,, a whole array of
hormones, and other systemic things. So, I'm all set.

and again, I thank you for all the info!

ok, so i saw the new cardio today. a very nice guy. he works over at
the main hospital and the ER, too.

ok, so they did a new EKG on me today. this time it still showed the
LVH and some other things but this time it didnt show the T-wave
inversions. or not as bad.. or at all. im not sure. it didnt actually
appear to be any, as i saw. he compared the ones done at the other
place and today and we went over them...

(could the t-waves been less or non-invtered this time due to a lower
heart rate today? which was 95... instead of the 120-130's.) also,
what do these t-wave inversions mean? (just seeing what you guys say)

AND... he thinks its a huge possibility that my echo was done like
shit. because he even said, "You body frame and habitus, would be one
of the easiest to do an echo on. for that to be a problem sounds like
bullshit", LOL.

so, yes.. hes gonna redo the stress/echo (thank god), right at their
place... so he and his group will look everything over.
and he ordered a chest x-ray, vq scan (tho, im already suppsoed to
have it done at thge other place).

so, he said that... the pulmonary artery stenosis is still not ruled
out. but he also suspects pulm. hypertension. he even said that no
matter what... ANY pulm. stenosis will result in P. hypertension? is
that true??
my main worry is... permanent PH..

and the embolism.. he thinks thats a possibiluty as well and isnt
doubting anything.

BP was 110/80 in the right arm. 100/80 in the left. (kind of odd)?

so the echo will be done on feb. 15th.

yeah, but could the P. Hypertension remain constant and permanent
after suffering from life-long stenosis/PH even after a stenosis
correction?

ive heard of some people being stuck with PH after long term embolisms
and such, too. that if not treated.. it could lead to permanent PH.

im also very aware of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension.. which has no
underlining cause. and many of the time is caused by Lupus and other
related plaque/tissue buildup or sar tissue from long term
inflammation of the auto-immune disease.
but this type is rarely treatable... they have meds they can try but
it rarely ever helps and most people end up developng heart failure
from it and the prognosis is pretty bad.

you think it could be that one? thats the PH thats been remaining in
the back of my mind ever since all this started....

thanks again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; shit. because he even said, &quot;You body frame and habitus, would be one
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the easiest to do an echo on. for that to be a problem sounds like
&gt; &gt; &gt; bullshit&quot;, LOL.

&gt; &gt; It remains possible that your echo tech was inexperienced.

&gt; &gt; &gt; so, yes.. hes gonna redo the stress/echo (thank god), right at their
&gt; &gt; &gt; place... so he and his group will look everything over.
&gt; &gt; &gt; and he ordered a chest x-ray, vq scan (tho, im already suppsoed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; have it done at thge other place).

&gt; &gt; &gt; so, he said that... the pulmonary artery stenosis is still not ruled
&gt; &gt; &gt; out. but he also suspects pulm. hypertension. he even said that no
&gt; &gt; &gt; matter what... ANY pulm. stenosis will result in P. hypertension? is
&gt; &gt; &gt; that true??

&gt; &gt; Yes.  However, your sudden onset of symptoms after the leg trauma
&gt; &gt; would suggest against a chronic pulmonary stenosis as the underlying
&gt; &gt; problem originally.

&gt; &gt; &gt; my main worry is... permanent PH..

&gt; &gt; Pulmonary hypertension from pulmonary stenosis would be surgically
&gt; &gt; correctable (i.e. not permanent).

&gt; &gt; &gt; and the embolism.. he thinks thats a possibiluty as well and isnt
&gt; &gt; &gt; doubting anything.

&gt; &gt; &gt; BP was 110/80 in the right arm. 100/80 in the left. (kind of odd)?

&gt; &gt; Could simply be from not waiting long enough for the systolic
&gt; &gt; pressures to settle down.

&gt; &gt; &gt; so the echo will be done on feb. 15th.

&gt; &gt; Sounds fine.

&gt; &gt; May GOD continue to heal your heart, in the interim.

Still waiting for my appointment next week...
but in the meantime, i had another question, hope you dont mind.

My mom had to go into the hospital for her own heart problem again...
and I was playing around with the pulse/ox thing... and we were
curious what mine was. so as i had it on my finger.. dependgn on if i
stood up or not.. it was going all over the place and had nothing to
do with the way it was on my finger. the Ox would go from 98 to 95,
then 99, then 97, then back to 96... and stay there. and the pulse
itself would be consistent with how i felt when standing up and
such... it'd go all over the place. from 98.. to 111.. to 122, then
95.. then anyhere between 88 and 122 about, within seconds. like i was
mentioning before.. just simply standing up and can make me feel my
heart start beating a lot faster.. and sometime si'll feel a 'rush' in
my head, chest, neck/lung area.

could this be consistent with a PT? or something else?
what could this errating Pulse Ox mean?

i was also feeling a little tight in my lung area when this was going
on too... and a little 'off'. thats been happening more than usual
lately. the last week and a half or so now.

as for the heart "thumps", that seems to have pretty much ceased. i
cant recall having one for a while now. ive been sleeping and resting
on my left side and laying on my stomach again with absolutely no
problem so far. which is nice. just seems to be this pulse shit.. and
the lung feeling.

&gt; No.

&gt; &gt; ive heard of some people being stuck with PH after long term embolisms
&gt; &gt; and such, too. that if not treated.. it could lead to permanent PH.

&gt; Correct.  However, this is different from PH from pulmonary stenosis.

&gt; &gt; im also very aware of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension.. which has no
&gt; &gt; underlining cause. and many of the time is caused by Lupus and other
&gt; &gt; related plaque/tissue buildup or sar tissue from long term
&gt; &gt; inflammation of the auto-immune disease.
&gt; &gt; but this type is rarely treatable... they have meds they can try but
&gt; &gt; it rarely ever helps and most people end up developng heart failure
&gt; &gt; from it and the prognosis is pretty bad.

&gt; Correct.  Heart/Lung transplants are an option for some.

&gt; &gt; you think it could be that one? thats the PH thats been remaining in
&gt; &gt; the back of my mind ever since all this started....

&gt; Your history would not be consistent with PPH.

&gt; &gt; thanks again.

UPDATE:

So today I had the new stress/echo done at this new place and the
attending doctor was wondering why they were giving me a stress echo
and not just a plain regular echo. Because supposedly stress echos
only show the wall motions and the other stuff regarding pumping
action and thats it... and wont show the in depth structures, and all
of that in ruling out stuff like the pulomary stenosis and other
abnormalities. Is that true??

So.. I guess theyre gonna talk to my regular cardio when hes back
Monday and see if he can order one of those, too.

Well, apparently this latest stress/echo was showing up no significant
wall motion issues.. and I was able to get to a stage 4.. my BPM went
up to 200 till I had to stop. Not from dizziness but my heart felt
like it was gonna pop out of my chest and it freaks me out when that
happens.

The EKG today came out like the one I had back in December. Inverted t-
waves and all that again. Looked worse than the last one, where I
thought it was looking better.

And they saw how my BPM went up just from standing up and moving
around. It went from 70 to 111.. to 128 to 60, to 138 back to 90.. all
within seconds. It kept bouncing all over the place. They were
baffled.

well, they finally got me all setup for a DVT scan (since it runs in
my family and my accident), and it all showed up negative on tge DVT.
however... on my bottom right leg near the ankle, the tech was having
compression issues with that area of the artery. i asked could this be
a clot area? and he just said, no, more likely some type of arterial
disease. wtf??? in just a small area? and um, im 25 years old.. no
diabetes.. otherwise perfect vascular health. so who knows.

next day i got the VQ scan and chest x-ray done at a local hospital.
well.. i still dont know everything yet. the techs did everything and
the doc there supposedly looked at everything real quick (a skim,
wtf?), and supposedly they wouldnt let me leave if there was any
'immediate problem'. so, i never even got to speak to the doctor. and
they'll look over more of it later and send the report back to my
cardiologist and family doctor. so, i still dont know anything about
this possible PE.  same tachy's been going on. everytings pretty much
the same. nothing different.

i still think a CT scan needs to be done, but.. thats the insurance
companies for ya! they dont wanna do shit unless theres good enough
reason...

The bottomline is that your lower extremity vascular ultrasound was
abnormal even if it were unrevealing for a source of pulmonary emboli
(PEs).  This may indicate a higher risk for future DVT and
consequential PEs.

Update:

I went to see the cardiologist today and went over the test results.
Turns out everything turned out okay. No embolism. VQ showed nothing,
chest x-ray was fine, etc.
general stress echo (Not full echo), came back normal. non-specific st-
t waves as usual.. heart rate went up to supposedly 203 within 5 mins,
no wall movement abnormalities reported. same as the other one, pretty
much.

But again, I pointed out to him that despite what my previous full
echo said (that said i had no pulmonary hypertension, determined by
continous doppler/etc) at the other facility back in december, that
those EKG's DO continue to keep coming back as saying there's a mild
right ventricular strain, and also on that other echo it did say
"tricuspid valve regurgitation is physiologic", but the overall vavlve
was 'normal'. that this (the regurgitation, along with the right
atrial straining) is usually a sign of 'something' going on concerning
the lungs. added in all of the symptoms i have.. and have been having
for years now that have been progressive.

he said that from the plain stress echo they did at this latest place
(without the full doppler, etc),  they can soemtimes tell if there's
some sign of PH, however, he said it shows no actual evidence of it,
but is this true? can you even tell from one of those tests?

anyways, he suggested due to my history of pulmonary artery stenosis,
that no matter what, back then i had some form of PH, .. and perhaps
even if the stenosis fixed itself, the PH could still be there, or.. i
just simply didnt outgrow it. he also mentioned its possible for
Pulmonary Artery Stenosis to return later in life? i've never heard of
that one. but that the only way to know for sure is to have a Right
heart - Pulmonary catherization done. but... given the EKG signs and
my history.. its still possible this could be what it is. but said,
thats up to me, and take some time to think about it. im just really
scared that this might be Primary PH, given the whole auto-immune
history which scares me the shit out of me. because i know which that
one, they usually cant do anything about it... and a lot of times its
seen in people who do have these (non-specific as of 2000) connective
tissue disorders like i was definitely diagnosed with. the last  Lupus
test i had done, which was an antibody/ant-DS-DNA panel, came back
negative. every other time its been borderline or very high (for the
ANA end of it alone).

i just hope it is just... the stenosis or something from that, that
they can fix... and prevent from getting worse. and not Primary PH.

im worried that it could be getting worse as we speak. last EKG i had
done was in the beginning of feb, and it was the same as the one from
december. "mild" right atrial strain and/or enlargement. how long
could it be before it gets to the point of moderate enlargement and/or
failure?

so, if a cath is what's needed, then i wanna get it done soon, before
anything gets worse. i feared this from the very beginning...

also, as far as my symptoms go, they seem pretty much the same, if not
less than before, well in what was going on in december, at least.

as for overall out of breath stuff.. that seems to be something thats
been going on for years, really. im not to the point of not being able
to do anything. its just when i run or exert myself does it get like
that, and depends on the day and activity really.

One would not rely on a plain stress echo to either confirm or refute

Pulmonary stenosis (PS) is not the same as pulmonary hypertension (PH
- elevated pulmonary artery pressures).  Indeed, PS lowers PA
pressures and protects the lungs from developing pulmonary
hypertension.

&gt; i've never heard of
&gt; that one. but that the only way to know for sure is to have a Right
&gt; heart - Pulmonary catherization done. but... given the EKG signs and
&gt; my history.. its still possible this could be what it is. but said,
&gt; thats up to me, and take some time to think about it. im just really
&gt; scared that this might be Primary PH, given the whole auto-immune
&gt; history which scares me the shit out of me. because i know which that
&gt; one, they usually cant do anything about it... and a lot of times its
&gt; seen in people who do have these (non-specific as of 2000) connective
&gt; tissue disorders like i was definitely diagnosed with. the last  Lupus
&gt; test i had done, which was an antibody/ant-DS-DNA panel, came back
&gt; negative. every other time its been borderline or very high (for the
&gt; ANA end of it alone).

&gt; i just hope it is just... the stenosis or something from that, that
&gt; they can fix... and prevent from getting worse. and not Primary PH.

&gt; im worried that it could be getting worse as we speak. last EKG i had
&gt; done was in the beginning of feb, and it was the same as the one from
&gt; december. &quot;mild&quot; right atrial strain and/or enlargement. how long
&gt; could it be before it gets to the point of moderate enlargement and/or
&gt; failure?

Depends on how elevated your PA pressures are.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; so, if a cath is what's needed, then i wanna get it done soon, before
&gt; anything gets worse. i feared this from the very beginning...

i know PS isnt the same as PH, but the PS can cause PH. supposedly,
from what i have been told, any type of PS, no matter how mild or
severe, it will come with some degree of PH.

given that my symptoms have been going on, rather mildly since high
school (well, as a child i dont recall having the out of breath/tachy
issues like that until i was older. virtually nothing 15 and under,
really.. except when i was 12 or 13.. they said i had 140/80 BP a few
times, but the doc discarded it as just the hormones. they didnt want
to put me on anything else.. then the BCP's controlled it, for that
time being. in result of easing the hormonal imbalance symptoms).. it
makes me think the congenital PS just got worse, instead of getting
better like they claimed, when i was a child. they supposedly told my
parents, it would either stay the same or correct itself.

i feel like im chasing ghosts.

so if i say OK to the pulmonary cath, what are the risks? are these
more risky than say, a regular cath? i know theres risks with anything
like that, and of possible stroke, if it dislodges soemthing or
possible limb problems.. but i wasnt sure if this other one carries
more risks or not.

what other pulmonary issues could have arisen based on my childhood
PS, say, if it corrected itself, but.. could it have left any residual
problems behind?

does it seem likely that the PS just got worse? ive done a lot of
research on congenital PS and the majority of it all pretty much
corrects itself.
when i was a baby, a doc noticed i had a very subtle flow murmur and
ordered tests and noticed i had this stenosis. years later to now, i
still have this 'flow murmur'. are these types of murmurs typical for
PS patients? and is it also typical for just PH patients, without the
stenosis?

sorry for all these questions. you've helped me a lot with these and
you do seem to know your stuff (more than my own docs...).

also, before i forget.. say this is my PS getting worse.. and so far
there is no heart failure.. just a very mildly enlarged Right atrium/
ventricle and extremely mild or almost no LVH (as its been stated
now)... if i get the PS repaired... soon, will the effects on the
right side heart, etc be able to be reversed?

also, what does the whole "tricuspid valve regurgitation is
physiologic" mean really? isnt this a sign of a right side heart
problem?

Incorrect.  PS does not cause PH.  Septal defects with left to right
shunting cause PH.

BCPs can cause subacute PE events leading to PH.  VQ scans do not have
enough sensitivity to detect all subacute PE events.  For this reason,
it is still possible that you have been having PEs to this day.

Clinically significant PS would cause marked hypertrophy and
enlargement of your right ventricle (RV).  Your having only mild RV
enlargement/hypertrophy would suggest that PS is not your problem.
