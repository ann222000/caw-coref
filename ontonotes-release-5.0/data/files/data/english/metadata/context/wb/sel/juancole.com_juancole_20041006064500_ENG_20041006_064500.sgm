How to understand the sudden outbreak of candor among Bush
administration officials (or former officials) about Iraq in the past
couple of days?

In the vice presidential debate on Tuesday evening, Dick Cheney said,
"I have not suggested there's a connection between iraq and 9/11." Well,
maybe not in so many words, but Cheney hinted around about this sort of
thing relentlessly.

E.g. consider this from an appearance on Meet the Press: "Cheney: "If
we're successful in Iraq, if we can stand up a good representative
government in Iraq, that secures the region so that it never again
becomes a threat to its neighbors or to the United States, so it's not
pursuing weapons of mass destruction, so that it's not a safe haven for
terrorists, now we will have struck a major blow right at the heart of
the base, if you will, the geographic base of the terrorists who have
had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9/11."
[NBC, Meet the Press, 11/14/03]

It is hard to read this statement in any other way than that Cheney
mistakenly thought Iraq was the "geographic base" of al-Qaeda. Although
he later went on in the same interview to deny an Iraq/9/11 connection,
I fear I believe his tactics in this regard were deliberately dishonest.
Cheney typically made these inflammatory associations up front, then
quietly denied their full implication later, sure that the first, bold
statement was what would stay in people's minds. This is the way that at
one point a majority of Americans were bamboozled by the Bush
administration into thinking that Saddam was somehow connected to 9/11,
which he was not. So why is Cheney backtracking more explicitly now? It
is because before, he could get away with saying these things despite
their falsehood, because no one was seriously challenging him and the
press did not want to get out ahead of a major political figure. But now
it is the election season, such that the press can always find a
legitimate counter-voice. In this situation where you cannot depend on a
monopoly over official information, it starts to become dangerous to lie
outright, because you know an opponent will call you on it and maybe
weaken your credibility.

On Monday, remarks of L. Paul Bremer were released AP reports that he
said of the looting in April-May 2003, "We paid a big price for not
stopping it because it established an atmosphere of lawlessness," Bremer
said during an address to an insurance group. It released a summary of
his remarks in Washington. "We never had enough troops on the ground,"
Bremer said, while insisting that he was "more convinced than ever that
regime change was the right thing to do."

CNN notes some backtracking : "Bremer attempted to clarify his
comments in a statement released Tuesday, saying his remarks referred
only to "the situation as I found it on the ground, when I arrived in
Baghdad in May 2003, and when I believed we needed either more Coalition
troops or Iraqi security forces to address the looting."

The problem is that a statement like "we never had enough troops on
the ground," if it is what he said, cannot possibly refer only to May,
2003. It seems to be a more honest evaluation of Bremer's year in Iraq.
And, it is rich that Bremer should complain about the need for more
Iraqi security forces on the ground. This is the man who dissolved the
Iraqi army in the first place!

Bremer's remark clearly puts the blame for the Iraq quagmire squarely
on Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Undersecretary of Defense
Paul Wolfowitz, the two architects of the new Pentagon policy of "small
force wars." Both were harsh to Gen. Shinseki for daring to suggest that
pacifying Iraq would require 300,000 troops. Actually, this is already a
low estimate. Calculating on the basis of the situation in the Balkans,
some security specialists at the National Security Council estimated in
spring of 2003 that 500,000 troops would be needed. In contrast,
Rumsfeld forced the Joint Chiefs of Staff to accept an invasion force of
only 100,000, which was good enough to win the war but not enough to
secure the peace.

Why did Bremer speak out now in the middle of the election season? It
may just have been an error of judgment on his part. He was speaking to
an insurance association in West Virginia, and may not have intended his
remarks to become public. I have been told that he spoke at DePauw U. in
mid-September and said the same thing. A "no-recording rule" had been
announced to the audience, presumably for deniability's sake. As for the
substance of his original statement, it is clearly an attempt on his
part to begin shifting some of the blame for the Iraq debacle from
himself onto other players, chiefly Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz. Bremer's
place in history, not to mention any future career in Washington,
depends on his ability to convince analysts that he was not principally
at fault for how things went bad in Iraq.

The Philadelphia Inquirer had reported on July 2, 2003:

U.S. overseer in Iraq seeks reinforcements

By Jonathan S. Landay and Warren P. Strobel

Inquirer Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON - The top American administrator in Iraq, confronting
growing anti-U.S. anger and guerrilla-style attacks, is asking for more
American troops and dozens of civilian officials to help speed up the
restoration of order and public services.

Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld was reviewing the request
from L. Paul Bremer, U.S. officials said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.

So Bremer could be settling scores on that rebuff. For more see
Poynteronline run by Jim Romenesko.

Then there was this amazing admission by Rumsfeld at a news
conference:

QUESTIONER: My name is Glenn Hutchins. Mr. Secretary, what exactly
was the connection between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda?

RUMSFELD: I tell you, I'm not going to answer the question. I have
seen the answer to that question migrate in the intelligence community
over the period of a year in the most amazing way. Second, there are
differences in the intelligence community as to what the relationship
was. To my knowledge, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence that
links the two.

Why did Rummy suddenly have this episode of conscience? It may well
be a sign of a rift with the Neoconservatives in the Pentagon. They made
him look like a fool, and he seems happy to repudiate them. I suspect he
is setting up the Neonservatives to take the fall, after the election,
when he will ask for their resignations. And it won't be pro forma.
