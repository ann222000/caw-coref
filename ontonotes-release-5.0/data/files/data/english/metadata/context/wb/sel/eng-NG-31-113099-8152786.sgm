&quot;No American President can stand up to Israel.&quot;

These words came from feisty Admiral Thomas Moorer, Chief of Naval
Operations (1967-1970) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(1970-1974). Moorer was, perhaps, the last independent-minded American
military leader.

Admiral Moorer knew what he was talking about. On June 8, 1967, Israel
attacked the American intelligence ship, USS Liberty, killing 34 American
sailors and wounding 173. The Israelis even strafed the life rafts,
machine-gunning the American sailors leaving the stricken ship.

Apparently, the USS Liberty had picked up Israeli communications that
revealed Israel's responsibility for the Seven Day War. Even today, history
books and the majority of Americans blame the conflict on the Arabs.

The United States Navy knew the truth, but the President of the United
States took Israel's side against the American military and ordered the
United States Navy to shut its mouth. President Lyndon Johnson said it was
all just a mistake. Later in life, Admiral Moorer formed a commission and
presented the unvarnished truth to Americans.

The power of the Israel Lobby over American foreign policy is considerable.
In March 2006, two distinguished American scholars, John Mearsheimer and
Stephen Walt, expressed concern in the London Review of Books that the power
of the Israel Lobby was bending US foreign policy in directions that serve
neither US nor Israeli interests. The two experts were hoping to start a
debate that might rescue the US and Israel from unsuccessful policies of
coercion that are intensifying Muslim hatred of Israel and America. The
Israel lobby was opposed to any such reassessment, and attempted to close it
off with epithets: &quot;Jew-baiter,&quot; &quot;anti-semitic,&quot; and even &quot;anti-American.&quot;
Today Israeli citizens who oppose Zionist plans for greater Israel are
denounced as &quot;anti-Semites.&quot;

Many Americans are unaware of the influence of the Israel lobby. Instead
they think of the US as &quot;the world's sole superpower,&quot; a macho new Roman
Empire whose orders are obeyed without question or the insolent nonentity is
&quot;bombed back to the stone age.&quot; Many Americans are convinced that military
coercion serves our interest. They cite Libya, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq,
and now they are ready to bring Iran and Pakistan to heel with bombs.

This arrogance results in the murder of tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds
of thousands, of men, women and children, a fate that many Americans seem to
believe is appropriate for countries that do not accept US hegemony.

Coercion is what American foreign policy has become. Macho superpatriots
love it. Many of these superpatriots derive vicarious pleasure from their
delusions that America is &quot;kicking those sand niggers' asses.&quot;

This is the America of the Bush Regime. If some of these superpatriots had
their way every &quot;unpatriotic, terrorist supporter&quot; who dares to criticize
the war against &quot;the Islamofacists&quot; would be sent to Gitmo, if not shot on
the spot.

These Bush supporters have morphed the Republican Party into the Brownshirt
Party. They cannot wait to attack Iran, preferably with nuclear weapons.
Impatient for Armageddon, some are so full of hubris and self-righteousness
that they actually believe that their support for evil means they will be
&quot;wafted up to heaven.&quot; [see

It has come as a crippling blow to Democrats that &quot;their&quot; political party is
comfortable with Bush's America, and will do nothing to stop the Bush
regime's aggression against the Iraqi people or to prevent the Bush regime's
attack on Iran.

The Democrats could easily impeach both Bush and Cheney in the House, as
impeachment only requires a majority vote. They could not convict in the
Senate without Republican support, as conviction requires ratification by
two-thirds of Senators present. Nevertheless, a House vote for impeachment
would take the wind out of the sails of war, save countless lives and
perhaps even save humanity from nuclear holocaust.

Various rationales or excuses have been constructed for the Democrats'
complicity in aggression that does not serve America. Perhaps the most
popular rationale is that the Democrats are letting the Republicans have all
the rope they want with which to produce such a high disapproval rating that
the Democrats will sweep the 2008 election.

It is doubtful that the Democrats would assume that men as cunning as Karl
Rove and Dick Cheney do not understand the electoral consequences of a low
public approval rating and are walking blindly into an electoral wipeout.
Rove's departure does not mean that no strategy is in place.

So what does explain the complicity of the Democratic Party in a policy that
the American public, and especially Democratic constituencies, reject?
Perhaps a clue is offered from the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune news
report (August 1, 2007) that Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison will spend
a week in Israel on &quot;a privately funded trip sponsored by the American
Israel Education Federation. The AIEF--the charitable arm of the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)--is sending 19 members of Congress
to meet with Israeli leaders. The group, made up mostly of freshman
Democrats, has plans to meet with Isreali Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and
[puppet] Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The senior Democratic member
on the trip is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who has gone three times.
. . . The trip to Israel is Ellison's second as a congressman.&quot;

According to the Star-Tribune, a Republican group, which includes Rep.
Michele Bachmann (R, Minn), led by Rep. Eric Cantor (R, Va) is already in
Israel. According to news reports, another 40 are following these two groups
during the August recess, and &quot;by the time the year is out every single
member of Congress will have made their rounds in Israel.&quot; This claim is
probably overstated, but it does show careful Israeli management of US
policy in the Middle East.

Elsewhere on earth and especially among Muslims, the suspicion is rife that
the reason the war against Iraq cannot end, and the reason Iran and Syria
must be attacked, is that the US must destroy all Muslim opposition to
Israel's theft of Palestine, turning an entire people into refugees driven
from their homes and from the lands on which they have lived for many
centuries. Americans might think that they are merely grabbing control over
oil, keeping it out of the hands of terrorists, but that is not the way the
rest of the world views the conflict.

Jimmy Carter was the last American president who stood up to Israel and
demanded that US diplomacy be, at least officially if not in practice,
even-handed in its approach to Israel and Palestine. Since Carter's
presidency, even-handedness has slowly drained from US policy in the Middle
East. The neoconservative Bush/Cheney regime has abandoned even the pretense
of even-handedness.

This is unfortunate, because military coercion has proven to be
unsuccessful. Exhausted from the conflict, the US military, according to
former Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Colin Powell, is &quot;nearly broken.&quot; Demoralized elite West Point graduates are
leaving the army at the fastest clip in 30 years. Desertions are rapidly
rising. A friend, a US Marine officer who served in combat in Vietnam,
recently wrote to me that his son's Marine unit, currently training for its
third deployment to Iraq in September, is short 12-16 men in every platoon
and expects to be hit with more AWOLs prior to deployment.

Instead of re-evaluating a failed policy, Bush's &quot;war tsar,&quot; General Douglas
Lute, has called for the reinstitution of the draft. Gen. Lute doesn't see
why Americans should not be returned to military servitude in order to save
the Bush administration the embarrassment of having to correct a mistaken
Middle East policy that commits the US to more aggression and to
debilitating long-term military conflict in the Middle East.

It is difficult to see how this policy serves any interest other than the
very narrow one of the armaments industry. Apparently, nothing can be done
to change this disastrous policy until the Israel Lobby comes to the
realization that Israel's interest is not being served by the current policy
of military coercion.

administration. He was Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial

Not a single one in the United States.  If there are any &quot;Islamo-
fascists&quot; who kill people in the United States they are simply
criminals who should be treated like criminals, i.e., they should be
arrested, given a fair trial, and punished if convicted.  We need a
president who embraces America's tradition of rule of law, and not
some Jew-loving cowboy who sends our young men thousand of miles
overseas to risk their lives to protect some murderous Jews who can
stay in their own country.

Killing a lot of innocent people to avenge the crimes of a few is a
peculiarly Jewish concept.  We see it in Palestine daily.  We see it
coming from the Washington think tanks stacked with pseudo-
intellectual Jews.  We hear it from the Jewish talking heads on our
television screens, people like Kristol, and Krauthammer, and their
ilk.

We hear it from AIPAC.  And, unfortunately, we hear it from the
grovelling candidates struggling to please their alien campaign
contributors.  And we hear it from people like you, Jews, people with
an alien ethic, a barbaric and foreign culture, simple-minded animals
who are unable to maintain a civilized community unless disciplined by
physical force.

Interesting, but I haven't heard that President Bush sent troops to
Israel - the US didn't even ssend troops when Iraq bombed Tel Aviv. If
there is such a plan, I am dead set against it.

I do remember a president sending troops to Lebanon, to protect the
population, and ingratitude, some 200 US Marines were killed.

Given that President Bush comes from Texas (oil country), this cowboy,
and his close compatriots (one of whom, we all wish could shoot like a
cowboy, rather than shoot his friends, accidentally), are more closely
tied to the oilfields of the Gulf States. My understanding, from what
I have seen and read, and talks with executives of multi-national oil
companies, is that close relationships with the Saudis, and the Emirs
of the Gulf, is far more important to Washington, than ties with
Israel.

Interesting that you write that 'Killing a lot of innocent people to
avenge the crimes of a few is a peculiarly Jewish concept (I presume
you are writing about Israel's policy of retribution, which
undoubtedly you have experienced first hand on a daily basis). But how
would you advise Israeli leaders to cope with
Farfur and the new Bee - and a teen age girl telling all those kids
watching afternoon television that everyone in Palestine dreams of
becoming a martyr?
Mothers wishing to give their lives to become martyrs, or encouraging
their children to become suicide bombers, to follow in the footsteps
of an older sibling who has been sent to paradise by an Israeli
bullet.
Kids throwing rocks and molotov cocktails? You probably would not want
Israeli soldiers to use rubber bulltes, because that might mean that
these kids would have to wait to become martyrs.
Fighters launching rockets into Israeli settlements? You would condone
the attacks, as it is their right to protest, right?
Terrorists digging tunnels from occupied houses, under the border so
as to kidnap Israeli soldiers
(BTW: I don't really understand why your Palestinian representatives
complain that the Israelis, and the world, seem to value Palestinian
lives less than the lives of Israelis, and then they have Israeli
soldiers kidnapped, perhaps one, perhaps four, and expect the Israelis
to release 1,500 Palestinians in exchange for the four Israelis (oh,
yes, and in several cases, they want live Palestinians in exchange for
dead Israelis). Each time this is done, do you not expect people who
have mastered simple multiplication and division to calculate exactly
how much you, the Palestinains, value the live of one of your own as a
fraction of an Israeli body, or an Israeli life.? Is it not you the
Palestinians, who are telling the rest of the world how little the
life of a Palestinian is worth?)

And many thanks for pointing out the backgrounds of some of the
reporters that I normally do not get to watch. Based on your
recommendation, I guess I should make an effort to watch Kristol and
Krauthammer the next time they are on TV.

One last item, on what bases do you describe the Jews as a people with
an alien ethic, a barbaric and foreign culture? I thought that the
Muslim world claimed the origins of their faith stemmed from this
culture, that the major guides of that culture had been adopted by the
Muslim faith as prophets of theirs. Hmmm? where does that leave you?

Were you against Bush's attack on Iraq?  Do you think Bush ordered the
invasion of Iraq to protect American lives?  How do you feel about
Bush's threats to attack Iran?  Why do you think the United States is
occupying Iraq and surrounding Iran?  No doubt, you think it's all
coincidence that the Jews in Bush's back rooms, in the Israeli
government, and in the U.S. media have been doggedly pushing for an
American attack on Israel's enemies in the Middle East.  I don't.
Bush is doing the bidding of his Jewish &quot;advisors,&quot; and the United
States is paying a dear price.

Y' know...there's some questions about just who set that bomb in
Lebanon.  We learned later that the Jews of Israel had prior knowledge
of the attack.  Isn't it amazing how the Jews seem to always have
prior knowlege of most of the attacks on the United States?   Some
people might think it's because the Jews are the ones staging the

Maybe, but the Jews of Israel think the oilfields of Iraq, and of
course, the planned pipeline to Israel refineries and the port at
Haifa, are much more important than the fields in Saudi Arabia--so
Bush is trying to wrest control of the Iraqi oil fields from the
defeated Iraqi people.  Again, it's no coincidence that Bush's
strategy is step-for-step in line with plans drawn up by the Jews
years ago.  It's no coincidence that Bush is willing to drain the U.S.
military resources if necessary to force the Iraqis to pass a law
surrendering control over their oil resources and the Kirkuk-Haifa
pipeline is back on the drawing boards in israel and Washington.

I'm glad you asked.  My advice to the Israeli leaders would be rather
simple: stop killing Palestinian civilians; stop stealing Palestinian
tax money; stop taking over Palestinian land and farms; stop
bulldozing Palestinian homes; stop razing Palestinian villages; stop
diverting Palestinian water; stop bombing Palestinian hospitals; stop
shelling Palestinian schools; stop blocking Palestinian travel; stop
barring Palestinians from medical facilities; stop building Jew-only
settlements on Palestinian land; stop acting like Jews.

Of course, there are a few positive steps that could be taken.  For
example, the Jews could tear down that wall, withdraw all their
citizens back into the only legitimate Israel, and grant civil rights
to all inhabitants regardless of race, religion, or creed.  The Jews
might try governing by rule of law rather than by fiat and physical
force.  Such a drastic change from their intrenched tribal form of
government will take some adjustment, I know, but it will produce
results in the long run.

Good point.  The Israelis are holding thousands of Palestinians in
barbaric prisons without charge, without trial, without rights of any
kind, and the Jews get upset if the Palestinians grab a couple of
armed Israeli soldiers to obtain the release of a few of the
Palestinian civilians.

What's more absurd is that Israeli soldiers can be kidnapped like
school girls, and the entire Israeli military force is then routed by
a few barefooted and poorly armed Hezbollah fighters. It's no wonder
the Jews are constantly trying to get American soldiers to fight
Israel's enemies.

Islam borrowed the ancient barbaric myths of the Sumerians,
Babylonians, Egyptians, and Canaanites--just like Judaism did.  But
Islam also borrowed a touch--just a touch--of the gentle teachings of
Jesus and adopted Jesus's concept of one almight God for all men
regardless of background.  The Jews, by contrast, cling to their
ethnocentric tribal concept of god, a god that hovers over a small,
genetically related tribe of wanderers, excluding all but their
selected members.  That alien and barbaric tribal culture is in
constant conflict with the more enlightened modern world.

&gt; &quot;No American President can stand up to Israel.&quot;

&gt; These words came from feisty Admiral Thomas Moorer, Chief of Naval
&gt; Operations (1967-1970) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
&gt; (1970-1974). Moorer was, perhaps, the last independent-minded American
&gt; military leader.

&gt; Admiral Moorer knew what he was talking about. On June 8, 1967, Israel
&gt; attacked the American intelligence ship, USS Liberty, killing 34 American
&gt; sailors and wounding 173. The Israelis even strafed the life rafts,
&gt; machine-gunning the American sailors leaving the stricken ship.

&gt; Apparently, the USS Liberty had picked up Israeli communications that
&gt; revealed Israel's responsibility for the Seven Day War. Even today, history
&gt; books and the majority of Americans blame the conflict on the Arabs.

&gt; The United States Navy knew the truth, but the President of the United
&gt; States took Israel's side against the American military and ordered the
&gt; United States Navy to shut its mouth. President Lyndon Johnson said it was
&gt; all just a mistake. Later in life, Admiral Moorer formed a commission and
&gt; presented the unvarnished truth to Americans.

&gt; The power of the Israel Lobby over American foreign policy is considerable.
&gt; In March 2006, two distinguished American scholars, John Mearsheimer and
&gt; Stephen Walt, expressed concern in the London Review of Books that the power
&gt; of the Israel Lobby was bending US foreign policy in directions that serve
&gt; neither US nor Israeli interests. The two experts were hoping to start a
&gt; debate that might rescue the US and Israel from unsuccessful policies of
&gt; coercion that are intensifying Muslim hatred of Israel and America. The
&gt; Israel lobby was opposed to any such reassessment, and attempted to close it
&gt; off with epithets: &quot;Jew-baiter,&quot; &quot;anti-semitic,&quot; and even &quot;anti-American.&quot;
&gt; Today Israeli citizens who oppose Zionist plans for greater Israel are
&gt; denounced as &quot;anti-Semites.&quot;

&gt; Many Americans are unaware of the influence of the Israel lobby. Instead
&gt; they think of the US as &quot;the world's sole superpower,&quot; a macho new Roman
&gt; Empire whose orders are obeyed without question or the insolent nonentity is
&gt; &quot;bombed back to the stone age.&quot; Many Americans are convinced that military
&gt; coercion serves our interest. They cite Libya, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq,
&gt; and now they are ready to bring Iran and Pakistan to heel with bombs.

&gt; This arrogance results in the murder of tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds
&gt; of thousands, of men, women and children, a fate that many Americans seem to
&gt; believe is appropriate for countries that do not accept US hegemony.

&gt; Coercion is what American foreign policy has become. Macho superpatriots
&gt; love it. Many of these superpatriots derive vicarious pleasure from their

&gt; So what does explain the complicity of the Democratic Party in a policy that
&gt; the American public, and especially Democratic constituencies, reject?
&gt; Perhaps a clue is offered from the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune news
&gt; report (August 1, 2007) that Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison will spend
&gt; a week in Israel on &quot;a privately funded trip sponsored by the American
&gt; Israel Education Federation. The AIEF--the charitable arm of the American
&gt; Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)--is sending 19 members of Congress
&gt; to meet with Israeli leaders. The group, made up mostly of freshman
&gt; Democrats, has plans to meet with Isreali Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and
&gt; [puppet] Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The senior Democratic member
&gt; on the trip is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who has gone three times.
&gt; . . . The trip to Israel is Ellison's second as a congressman.&quot;

&gt; According to the Star-Tribune, a Republican group, which includes Rep.
&gt; Michele Bachmann (R, Minn), led by Rep. Eric Cantor (R, Va) is already in
&gt; Israel. According to news reports, another 40 are following these two groups
&gt; during the August recess, and &quot;by the time the year is out every single
&gt; member of Congress will have made their rounds in Israel.&quot; This claim is
&gt; probably overstated, but it does show careful Israeli management of US
&gt; policy in the Middle East.

&gt; Elsewhere on earth and especially among Muslims, the suspicion is rife that
&gt; the reason the war against Iraq cannot end, and the reason Iran and Syria
&gt; must be attacked, is that the US must destroy all Muslim opposition to
&gt; Israel's theft of Palestine, turning an entire people into refugees driven
&gt; from their homes and from the lands on which they have lived for many
&gt; centuries. Americans might think that they are merely grabbing control over
&gt; oil, keeping it out of the hands of terrorists, but that is not the way the
&gt; rest of the world views the conflict.

&gt; Jimmy Carter was the last American president who stood up to Israel and
&gt; demanded that US diplomacy be, at least officially if not in practice,
&gt; even-handed in its approach to Israel and Palestine. Since Carter's
&gt; presidency, even-handedness has slowly drained from US policy in the Middle
&gt; East. The neoconservative Bush/Cheney regime has abandoned even the pretense
&gt; of even-handedness.

&gt; This is unfortunate, because military coercion has proven to be
&gt; unsuccessful. Exhausted from the conflict, the US military, according to
&gt; former Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
&gt; Colin Powell, is &quot;nearly broken.&quot; Demoralized elite West Point graduates are
&gt; leaving the army at the fastest clip in 30 years. Desertions are rapidly
&gt; rising. A friend, a US Marine officer who served in combat in Vietnam,
&gt; recently wrote to me that his son's Marine unit, currently training for its
&gt; third deployment to Iraq in September, is short 12-16 men in every platoon
&gt; and expects to be hit with more AWOLs prior to deployment.

&gt; Instead of re-evaluating a failed policy, Bush's &quot;war tsar,&quot; General Douglas

&gt; debilitating long-term military conflict in the Middle East.

&gt; It is difficult to see how this policy serves any interest other than the

IF YOU NOTICED THE OFFER OF THE PALESTINIAN INVESTMENT CORPORATION TO

WHY?

COUNTRIES MOVE BY INTERESTS.  THE PALESTINIAN INVESTMENT CORPORATION
IS PUTTING USA INTERESTS ABOVE AN INDEPENDENT INTEREST OF ISRAEL.  AS
A MATTER OF FACT, IT DEGRADES ISRAEL TO MERELY A CORPORATION THAT CAN

&gt; &quot;No American President can stand up to Israel.&quot;

&gt; These words came from feisty Admiral Thomas Moorer, Chief of Naval
&gt; Operations (1967-1970) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
&gt; (1970-1974). Moorer was, perhaps, the last independent-minded American
&gt; military leader.

&gt; Admiral Moorer knew what he was talking about. On June 8, 1967, Israel
&gt; attacked the American intelligence ship, USS Liberty, killing 34 American
&gt; sailors and wounding 173. The Israelis even strafed the life rafts,
&gt; machine-gunning the American sailors leaving the stricken ship.

&gt; Apparently, the USS Liberty had picked up Israeli communications that
&gt; revealed Israel's responsibility for the Seven Day War. Even today, history
&gt; books and the majority of Americans blame the conflict on the Arabs.

&gt; The United States Navy knew the truth, but the President of the United
&gt; States took Israel's side against the American military and ordered the
&gt; United States Navy to shut its mouth. President Lyndon Johnson said it was
&gt; all just a mistake. Later in life, Admiral Moorer formed a commission and
&gt; presented the unvarnished truth to Americans.

&gt; The power of the Israel Lobby over American foreign policy is considerable.
&gt; In March 2006, two distinguished American scholars, John Mearsheimer and
&gt; Stephen Walt, expressed concern in the London Review of Books that the power
&gt; of the Israel Lobby was bending US foreign policy in directions that serve
&gt; neither US nor Israeli interests. The two experts were hoping to start a
&gt; debate that might rescue the US and Israel from unsuccessful policies of
&gt; coercion that are intensifying Muslim hatred of Israel and America. The
&gt; Israel lobby was opposed to any such reassessment, and attempted to close it
&gt; off with epithets: &quot;Jew-baiter,&quot; &quot;anti-semitic,&quot; and even &quot;anti-American.&quot;
&gt; Today Israeli citizens who oppose Zionist plans for greater Israel are
&gt; denounced as &quot;anti-Semites.&quot;

&gt; Many Americans are unaware of the influence of the Israel lobby. Instead
&gt; they think of the US as &quot;the world's sole superpower,&quot; a macho new Roman
&gt; Empire whose orders are obeyed without question or the insolent nonentity is
&gt; &quot;bombed back to the stone age.&quot; Many Americans are convinced that military
&gt; coercion serves our interest. They cite Libya, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq,
&gt; and now they are ready to bring Iran and Pakistan to heel with bombs.

&gt; This arrogance results in the murder of tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds
&gt; of thousands, of men, women and children, a fate that many Americans seem to
&gt; believe is appropriate for countries that do not accept US hegemony.

&gt; Coercion is what American foreign policy has become. Macho superpatriots
&gt; love it. Many of these superpatriots derive vicarious pleasure from their
&gt; delusions that America is &quot;kicking those sand niggers' asses.&quot;

&gt; This is the America of the Bush Regime. If some of these superpatriots had
&gt; their way every &quot;unpatriotic, terrorist supporter&quot; who dares to criticize

Yes you are clever.  But not better.  You are not great.  But you are
strong.  ElParedon and Aviroce have started with the Jew.

You are clever because you are able to mopolize licensing and achieve
hegemony over social and economic and media aspects.  For that you are
strong.  But you never learned your lesson- vicious greed leads you to
Hell not Heaven.  You saw that in Russia.  You saw that in Austria.
You saw that in Poland.  You saw that in Germany.  You smell that in
the United States of America.  And you see that in the world
community.  When Americans suffer enough at your hands and plans, they
will retaliate.
