no checking with very small turnings?

Here's my situation:
1) I'm a complete noob to turning (this is basically my first project
ever, and I've never actually seen anyone use a lathe before)

2) I have some 5" or so diameter walnut logs I was going to do some
bowyering with (but they ended up with too many knots) that have been
sitting in my driveway for 10 months.  The ends were checked about an
inch into the wood, but the rest seemed reasonable for what I wanted
to do.

3) Goal: nice small project that I can finish without getting terribly
frustrated that isn't pens (pens just don't do it for me).  I decided
to try to make some small sake cups (essentially a 2"x2" or so
shotglass).

So, what I did was cut off a foot from the end of the log, ran it over
the jointer to make 3 sides with 90 degree faces, then quartered it on
the table saw.  I then cut off  the checked ends, and cut the 4
quarters into 4" long blanks to give me plenty of room to work with.

I turned my blanks round between centers, drilled out a 1.5" deep
starter hole with a forstner bit on the drill press, then chucked up
what I had on the lathe with a self-centering chuck.  I scraped out
the inside, shaped the outside, sanded both, then used a parting tool
to cut the basically finished piece off.

I was fairly pleased with what I got as a first attempt, but figured I
could do better, so I just set that aside as-is for a few days.  After
observing it for a bit, I am a bit puzzled.  I can perceive absolutely
no checking on my finished cup, and I didn't do anything on it to
prevent checking.  The end of the log that I cut my starter piece from
is already checking badly at this point.

So.. the real questions:
1) Do small things such as tiny bowls or pens not check?  (or not
check as badly?)
2) In another month am I going to see checking on my cup?
3) If  2) is true, if I polyurethane my cup now, would it then not
check since no more moisture could escape?
4) Would my results be a lot different if I was using very green wood?

And one question related to my project, but not the checking:
5) After I part my piece off, is there any convenient way of sanding
the bottom (or turning a divot)?  Turning it around in the chuck will
scratch it all up.  Here are the ideas I've come up with:
a) rubberized chuck jaws or strips of rubber between the jaw and the
piece
b) hot glue + face plate (centering would seem to be an awful chore
if I wanted to make say... 80 of these)
c) jam chuck (I'd have to make all of them exactly the same time if
I wanted to make several)

I'm even newer than a noob, but you might find this Northern Log Home
article helpful( http://www.northernloghome.com/checking.htm)- I know I
just learned something new!

I suspect that, because you pieced the logs apart, you don't have intact
circular growth rings and, thus, won't be subject to checking. But I'm
really new at this, so consider the source. I'll wait to hear what the
experts have to say!

happy turning!

You've actually done pretty well for yourself, especially if you've
not turned before. I'll try to answer your questions to the best of MY
knowledge. Others may do things differently.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So.. the real questions:
&gt; 1) Do small things such as tiny bowls or pens not check?  (or not
&gt; check as badly?)

Yes, they will. I've had a pen crack 4 months after it was made. The
size of the piece is really irrelevant to the cracking or checking
process. What is relevant is the dryness of the wood to start with and
the overall thickness of the material when you are done. Evenly thin
vessels will crack less. They may warp but cracking will be minimized.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) In another month am I going to see checking on my cup?

You might.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Finish on top of wet wood usually doesn't work. At best it will cloud
the finish. It has been my experience that even finished, wood will
find a way to crack. I don't think you can truly seal a surface if
there is water present underneath. The finish will not "stick" as it
should...I think.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4) Would my results be a lot different if I was using very green wood?
">

Not necessarily but as stated above, turning green is a matter of
turnning thin. You can take a wet log, turn it as thin as you can and
finish it right on the lathe. But you need to be fast. I have had
cases where the wood cracked right before my eyes while on the lathe.
Some times the heat from sanding alone will do it.

I think you have exhausted pretty all the avenues open to you. All are
valid ways to chuck up the piece, the problem with your question is
the "turning 80 pieces" part. As you become more proficient as a
turner, you get better at sizing things just right. I've made jaw
chucks that have been used to finish pieces in the hundreds and which
are still in use today. I just finished turning 500 items and used the
same jam chuck to finish the tops in this case so that there was no
nub visible.

Practice making a uniform tenon on your pieces, of the same constant
diameter which you can mount in a jam chuck. If it gets a little
sloppy at times and doesn't fit quite right, you can spray a little
water on the chuck which expands the wood to get a better fit. Another
alternative is to use a piece of paper towel wedged between the chuck
and the piece.

The one thing I would like to point out is that wood will crack much
more if the pith is retained. In your process of cutting up your
blanks, I would have remove the center completely, then used the rest
to make the square blanks. The pith is your worst enemy as far as
cracking goes.

I hope this helps.

Thin things dry more evenly, which minimizes possibilities for checking.
Your long-grain configuration leaves you vulnerable to checks in the bottom,
produced by the same mechanism which produced the end checks you removed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) In another month am I going to see checking on my cup?

Possible.  Depends on how gently and evenly you dry them.  I'd put them on
stickers to provide air to both sides of the bottom, a method which works
for me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

As mentioned, you're going to get gum for a long time.  Not to mention that
you'll get rough surfaces again as things dry, so you might want to wait a
bit until the pieces are dryer.

I part off with a concavity in the bottom using a parting tool and gouge or
chisel to trim it smooth where the scrape leaves rough spots or pills
fibers.  If you leave a half inch  stub sticking out, you can whittle it
away fairly easily with a curved knife.  Some people use a carving gouge,
but I find the knife easier, because I can hold the piece in one hand and
whittle with the other while bracing with my thumb.  Parting off is helped
greatly by using a wooden cone center held in place by your revolving
tailstock, as is working the outside slim or giving it a stem.  Suggest it
as a great turning aid.  I've a NOVA center which allows me to bolt on any
size disk or cone I want, but other methods work.

I use a flexible shaft and small disk to sand, so after carving the stub
relatively flush, I can use the curvature of the disk to follow the
concavity while leaving the rim unsanded for later levelling.
