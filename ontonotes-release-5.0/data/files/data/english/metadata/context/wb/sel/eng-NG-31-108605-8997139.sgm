Please pardon an ignorant landlubber's question:

I have never served in the military, and I deeply respect the
incredible commitment, focus, and perseverance involved in becoming a
Navy SEAL, and I am grateful that there are people like that in the
U.S. military; I could never be a Navy SEAL.  That said, I have often
wondered, why the Navy makes it so difficult to become a SEAL.  In
other words, as I understand it, the mission of the SEALs (among other
things) is to sneak ashore ahead of amphibious invasions, scout out
the terrain without engaging the enemy, and sneak back without getting
caught or shot at.  Now with all due respect for the mission, and I'm
sure it's a dangerous one, why would you force recruits to go through
all the things you see on the Discovery Channel, like &quot;surf torture&quot;
and Hell Week, and all the other things involved with BUD/S?  I would
think you would want to select the sneakiest, most evasive sailors,
rather than selecting for the absolute toughest, most rugged
individuals.

Again, maybe this is a clue as to why I am not a high-level manager in
the Navy, but this is a question that has often crossed my mind as I
watch those Discovery Channel specials.

there has never been a military unit that excels at self-promotion more than
the seals.
the army's delta force is just as tough but they prefer to work in the
shadows.

I would offer as an illustration of how that works by citing someone I
knew who went through the UDT program before there were SEALs. When
you finish you are placed in order of class ranking and allowed to
pick the next available duty. My acquaintance said he had heard the
UDTs were tough, he had finished the course, was qualified and didn't
find them to be so tough. He was running security at a very nasty
naval base in the Phillipines within a week.

That is one of many missions and if they get caught out there alone,
they need the skills and fortitude to try and survive the situation.
They also do assault, snatch and grab, counter terrorism, counter
insurgency, recon, Search and destroy, etc.  Look at the history of
their missions in Viet Nam and you'll see a lot more than the task you
described.
Even if they were doing a 'simple' (yea right) recon mission it
might involve exiting a submerged Sub several miles offshore, swimming
in at night, make a several mile trip inland to the target, spending
several days hidden but observing (or maybe lasing a sight for a smart
bomb.  Then quickly getting back the several miles to the shore,
swimming out and meeting with the sub to exfiltrate.  And being
prepared at any time if they get detected to fight their way back.
Sneaky and evasive would be only a small part of what the requirements
for that mission would need.

A little history from navyseals.com

&quot;In 1962, President Kennedy established SEAL Teams ONE and TWO from
the existing UDT Teams to develop a Navy Unconventional Warfare
capability. The Navy SEAL Teams were designed as the maritime
counterpart to the Army Special Forces &quot;Green Berets.&quot; They deployed
immediately to Vietnam to operate in the deltas and thousands of
rivers and canals in Vietnam, and effectively disrupted the enemy's
maritime lines of communication.

The SEAL Teams' mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and
clandestine maritime operations. Initially, SEALs advised and trained
Vietnamese forces, such as the LDNN (Vietnamese SEALs). Later in the
war, SEALs conducted nighttime Direct Action missions such as ambushes
and raids to capture prisoners of high intelligence value.&quot;

And a recent press release regarding Afghanistan...

&quot;020114-N-8242C-006 Eastern Afghanistan (Jan. 14, 2002) -- During a
search and destroy mission in the Zhawar Kili area, U.S. Navy SEALs
(SEa, Air, Land) found valuable intelligence information, including
this Osama Bin Laden propaganda poster located in an al Qaida
classroom. In addition to detaining several suspected al Qaida and
Taliban members, SEALs also found a large cache of munitions in
numerous caves and above-ground structures. The SEALs destroyed more
than 50 caves and 60 structures by using on-ground explosives and air
strikes. Navy special operations forces are conducting missions in
Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. U.S. Navy photo.

The same thing applies to Marine Force Recon and battalion recon, or other
specialized units (back in the day 2nd Marines had a Scout Sniper Platoon).
Your normal person cannot actually do most of this stuff, so you need a
stringent weeding out process. It is 25% physical, 75% mental.

Responding to the OP, I am not sure that the mission of SEALs is to scout
out the beach in advance of an amphibious invasion. I think the Marines have
all of that well in hand. The SEALs will probably be executing very specific
missions, and they won't include checking beach gradients and soil
composition...they will probably be more exotic.

Again responding to the OP, you actually do select for the sneaky, evasive,
rugged types - not the bodybuilders or thugs. The physical stuff is designed
to ID who has the mental qualities to survive in True Shit.

Lt (jg) Robert Kerrey citation for the Medal of Honor
His Medal of Honor citation reads:
Medal of Honor

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life
above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a SEAL team leader
during action against enemy aggressor (Viet Cong) forces. Acting in
response to reliable intelligence, Lt. (j.g.) Kerrey led his SEAL team
on a mission to capture important members of the enemy's area
political cadre known to be located on an island in the bay of Nha
Trang. In order to surprise the enemy, he and his team scaled a 350-
foot sheer cliff to place themselves above the ledge on which the
enemy was located. Splitting his team in 2 elements and coordinating
both, Lt. (jg.) Kerrey led his men in the treacherous downward descent
to the enemy's camp. Just as they neared the end of their descent,
intense enemy fire was directed at them, and Lt. (jg.) Kerrey received
massive injuries from a grenade that exploded at his feet and threw
him backward onto the jagged rocks. Although bleeding profusely and
suffering great pain, he displayed outstanding courage and presence of
mind in immediately directing his element's fire into the heart of the
enemy camp. Utilizing his radio, Lt. (jg.) Kerrey called in the second
element's fire support, which caught the confused Viet Cong in a
devastating crossfire. After successfully suppressing the enemy's
fire, and although immobilized by his multiple wounds, he continued to
maintain calm, superlative control as he ordered his team to secure
and defend an extraction site. Lt. (jg.) Kerrey resolutely directed
his men, despite his near unconscious state, until he was eventually
evacuated by helicopter. The havoc brought to the enemy by this very
successful mission cannot be over-estimated. The enemy soldiers who
were captured provided critical intelligence to the allied effort. Lt.
(jg.) Kerrey's courageous and inspiring leadership, valiant fighting
spirit, and tenacious devotion to duty in the face of almost
overwhelming opposition sustain and enhance the finest traditions of
the U.S. Naval Service.

Simple answer..

The selection criteria have been found to select the kind of people they
need to do their job(s).

Hell week is all about &quot;stress&quot; and I don't mean simple physical
stress.. It's about pushing on beyond the normal limits...

Not everyone is capable of going that extra bit longer that can be the
difference between success and failure... They are searching for those
that can.

They want combat soldiers that will still be intelligent,mentally smart,and
physically adept AFTER a physically grueling trip in,despite things going
wrong,and be able to get out after completing their mission.Many tough guys
can pass the physical tests,but are not sufficiently mentally agile and
adept during and after it.
They have to be flexible and adaptable after enduring incredibly tough
conditions. They have to be able to replan their mission right in the
middle of it,to adapt to changing conditions,yet complete their mission
successfully.

He is one of those people who pop up on cable TV from time to time to
lend a voice about things like military service and the state of the
union. As the wiki shows he can have some strange ideas and is not
some dead hero lying by the side of the road. He got into a
&quot;discussion&quot; with the students at the New School, of which he is
president, over the &quot;war crimes&quot; he admits to committing. In another
era he would be a hero for all to admire, now he is just another &quot;once
was&quot; who shows up from time to time.

I do hope so. In UK medal biz you can't get a VC for saving your
comrades from an attack by the US Airforce. Only a GC, which is an
exact but civilian equivalent, because no enemy of HM involved. But the
citation, hmm, cited was pretty damned impressive. Impressed the shit
out of me, anyway.

I do not, rpt not, slag off American fighters who earned their medals.
Even in my eld, I retain enough boyhood to be awestruck by that kind of
courage. I could probably summon up around 5% of it to defend my
woman... but my mission?  Bows head suitably. Raises glass to the truly
brave.

NB my grandfather, way back in 1935, received from the hands of HM King
George the King's Police Medal for Gallantry. He dived into a septic
tank (a large thing full of shit) to try to save a small boy, unknown
to him, who had foolishly fallen into the thing. Boy died; Grandfather
spent about three weeks in hospital with complications due to swimming
in shit. I feel ashamed to be a far lesser heir. I believe a glass
might be raised to the memory of Sergeant David Cairns (later
Inspector) of the Glasgow Police Force. Since I brought up the subject

The MOH recipients point out their medals are representative of their

factors that have nothing to do with the action but much to do with

I don't believe anyone knows for absolute certainty, until they are

and then are suddenly surprised that they acted without thinking and
exhibited a courage they never believed they posessed.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Please pardon an ignorant landlubber's question:

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I have never served in the military, and I deeply respect the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; incredible commitment, focus, and perseverance involved in becoming a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Navy SEAL, and I am grateful that there are people like that in the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; U.S. military; I could never be a Navy SEAL.  That said, I have often
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wondered, why the Navy makes it so difficult to become a SEAL.  In
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; other words, as I understand it, the mission of the SEALs (among other
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things) is to sneak ashore ahead of amphibious invasions, scout out
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the terrain without engaging the enemy, and sneak back without getting
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; caught or shot at.  Now with all due respect for the mission, and I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sure it's a dangerous one, why would you force recruits to go through
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all the things you see on the Discovery Channel, like &quot;surf torture&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and Hell Week, and all the other things involved with BUD/S?  I would
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; think you would want to select the sneakiest, most evasive sailors,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rather than selecting for the absolute toughest, most rugged
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; individuals.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is one of many missions and if they get caught out there alone,
&gt; &gt; &gt; they need the skills and fortitude to try and survive the situation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; They also do assault, snatch and grab, counter terrorism, counter
&gt; &gt; &gt; insurgency, recon, Search and destroy, etc.  Look at the history of
&gt; &gt; &gt; their missions in Viet Nam and you'll see a lot more than the task you
&gt; &gt; &gt; described.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Even if they were doing a 'simple' (yea right) recon mission it
&gt; &gt; &gt; might involve exiting a submerged Sub several miles offshore, swimming
&gt; &gt; &gt; in at night, make a several mile trip inland to the target, spending
&gt; &gt; &gt; several days hidden but observing (or maybe lasing a sight for a smart
&gt; &gt; &gt; bomb.  Then quickly getting back the several miles to the shore,
&gt; &gt; &gt; swimming out and meeting with the sub to exfiltrate.  And being
&gt; &gt; &gt; prepared at any time if they get detected to fight their way back.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sneaky and evasive would be only a small part of what the requirements
&gt; &gt; &gt; for that mission would need.

&gt; &gt; [ SNIP ]

&gt; &gt; The same thing applies to Marine Force Recon and battalion recon, or other
&gt; &gt; specialized units (back in the day 2nd Marines had a Scout Sniper Platoon).
&gt; &gt; Your normal person cannot actually do most of this stuff, so you need a
&gt; &gt; stringent weeding out process. It is 25% physical, 75% mental.

&gt; &gt; Responding to the OP, I am not sure that the mission of SEALs is to scout
&gt; &gt; out the beach in advance of an amphibious invasion. I think the Marines have
&gt; &gt; all of that well in hand. The SEALs will probably be executing very specific
&gt; &gt; missions, and they won't include checking beach gradients and soil
&gt; &gt; composition...they will probably be more exotic.

&gt; &gt; Again responding to the OP, you actually do select for the sneaky, evasive,
&gt; &gt; rugged types - not the bodybuilders or thugs. The physical stuff is designed
&gt; &gt; to ID who has the mental qualities to survive in True Shit.

&gt; Lt (jg) Robert Kerrey citation for the Medal of Honor
&gt; His Medal of Honor citation reads:
&gt; Medal of Honor

&gt;     For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life
&gt; above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a SEAL team leader
&gt; during action against enemy aggressor (Viet Cong) forces. Acting in
&gt; response to reliable intelligence, Lt. (j.g.) Kerrey led his SEAL team
&gt; on a mission to capture important members of the enemy's area
&gt; political cadre known to be located on an island in the bay of Nha
&gt; Trang. In order to surprise the enemy, he and his team scaled a 350-
&gt; foot sheer cliff to place themselves above the ledge on which the
&gt; enemy was located. Splitting his team in 2 elements and coordinating
&gt; both, Lt. (jg.) Kerrey led his men in the treacherous downward descent
&gt; to the enemy's camp. Just as they neared the end of their descent,
&gt; intense enemy fire was directed at them, and Lt. (jg.) Kerrey received
&gt; massive injuries from a grenade that exploded at his feet and threw
&gt; him backward onto the jagged rocks. Although bleeding profusely and
&gt; suffering great pain, he displayed outstanding courage and presence of
&gt; mind in immediately directing his element's fire into the heart of the
&gt; enemy camp. Utilizing his radio, Lt. (jg.) Kerrey called in the second
&gt; element's fire support, which caught the confused Viet Cong in a
&gt; devastating crossfire. After successfully suppressing the enemy's
&gt; fire, and although immobilized by his multiple wounds, he continued to
&gt; maintain calm, superlative control as he ordered his team to secure
&gt; and defend an extraction site. Lt. (jg.) Kerrey resolutely directed
&gt; his men, despite his near unconscious state, until he was eventually
&gt; evacuated by helicopter. The havoc brought to the enemy by this very
&gt; successful mission cannot be over-estimated. The enemy soldiers who
&gt; were captured provided critical intelligence to the allied effort. Lt.
&gt; (jg.) Kerrey's courageous and inspiring leadership, valiant fighting
&gt; spirit, and tenacious devotion to duty in the face of almost
&gt; overwhelming opposition sustain and enhance the finest traditions of
&gt; the U.S. Naval Service.

What a pity that the farmers they fought were trying to free their

I think you are confusing your Vietnam villages, lots of people do.
Non-conventional warfare makes people do things that they regret
later, the little old lady with the hand grenade in her lap, the kid
dragging the AK-47 along a path, the house boy with a commission in
the Vietnamese army, not the old up and at em of the movies.

On February 25, 1969, he led a Swift Boat raid on the isolated peasant
village of Thanh Phong, Vietnam, targeting a Viet Cong leader that
intelligence suggested would be present. The village was considered
part of a free fire zone by the U.S. military.

Kerrey's SEAL team first encountered a peasant house, or hooch, and
killed the people inside with knives. While Kerrey says he did not go
inside the hooch and did not participate in the killings, another
member of the team, Gerhard Klann, said that the people killed there
were an elderly man and woman and three children under 12, and that
Kerrey helped kill the man. Despite the differing recollections about
who actually stabbed these people, Kerrey accepts responsibility as
the team leader for their deaths: &quot;Standard operating procedure was to
dispose of the people we made contact with,&quot; he told the New York
Times Magazine.  Later, according to Kerrey, the team was shot at from
the village and returned fire, only to find after the battle that all
the dead were women and children, clustered together in the center of
the village. &quot;The thing that I will remember until the day I die is
walking in and finding, I don't know, 14 or so, I don't even know what
the number was, women and children who were dead,&quot; Kerrey said in
1998. &quot;I was expecting to find Vietcong soldiers with weapons, dead.
Instead I found women and children.&quot;  Klann, and a Vietnamese woman,
Pham Tri Lanh, who says she witnessed the assault, gave a different
account, saying that the SEALs rounded up the inhabitants of the
village and shot them.

Regardless of what actually occurred that night, Kerrey expressed
anguish and guilt over the incident:

You can never, can never get away from it. It darkens your day. I
thought dying for your country was the worst thing that could happen
to you, and I don't think it is. I think killing for your country can
be a lot worse.

Kerrey was awarded a Bronze Star for the raid on Thanh Phong. The
citation for the medal reads, &quot;The net result of his patrol was 21
Viet Cong killed, two hooches destroyed and two enemy weapons
captured.&quot;

&gt;&gt; out easily either. Getting a CAR or MEM is also not casual.

&gt; I do hope so. In UK medal biz you can't get a VC for saving your
&gt; comrades from an attack by the US Airforce. Only a GC, which is an
&gt; exact but civilian equivalent, because no enemy of HM involved. But the
&gt; citation, hmm, cited was pretty damned impressive. Impressed the shit
&gt; out of me, anyway.

&gt; I do not, rpt not, slag off American fighters who earned their medals.
&gt; Even in my eld, I retain enough boyhood to be awestruck by that kind of
&gt; courage. I could probably summon up around 5% of it to defend my

I'd like to think I earned most of my ribbons. They were quite strict about
who would get a CAR, and my MEM is also rather unusual - I don't think it is
even authorized for Marines in Iraq or Afghanistan. Getting unit citations
does take rather valorous conduct, also.

&gt; part of a free fire zone by the U.S. military.

&gt; Kerrey's SEAL team first encountered a peasant house, or hooch, and
&gt; killed the people inside with knives. While Kerrey says he did not go
&gt; inside the hooch and did not participate in the killings, another
&gt; member of the team, Gerhard Klann, said that the people killed there
&gt; were an elderly man and woman and three children under 12, and that
&gt; Kerrey helped kill the man. Despite the differing recollections about
&gt; who actually stabbed these people, Kerrey accepts responsibility as
&gt; the team leader for their deaths: &quot;Standard operating procedure was to
&gt; dispose of the people we made contact with,&quot; he told the New York
&gt; Times Magazine.  Later, according to Kerrey, the team was shot at from
&gt; the village and returned fire, only to find after the battle that all
&gt; the dead were women and children, clustered together in the center of
&gt; the village. &quot;The thing that I will remember until the day I die is
&gt; walking in and finding, I don't know, 14 or so, I don't even know what
&gt; the number was, women and children who were dead,&quot; Kerrey said in
&gt; 1998. &quot;I was expecting to find Vietcong soldiers with weapons, dead.
&gt; Instead I found women and children.&quot;  Klann, and a Vietnamese woman,
&gt; Pham Tri Lanh, who says she witnessed the assault, gave a different
&gt; account, saying that the SEALs rounded up the inhabitants of the
&gt; village and shot them.

&gt; Regardless of what actually occurred that night, Kerrey expressed
&gt; anguish and guilt over the incident:

&gt;     You can never, can never get away from it. It darkens your day. I
&gt; thought dying for your country was the worst thing that could happen
&gt; to you, and I don't think it is. I think killing for your country can
&gt; be a lot worse.

&gt; Kerrey was awarded a Bronze Star for the raid on Thanh Phong. The
&gt; citation for the medal reads, &quot;The net result of his patrol was 21
&gt; Viet Cong killed, two hooches destroyed and two enemy weapons
&gt; captured.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Please pardon an ignorant landlubber's question:

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have never served in the military, and I deeply respect the
&gt; &gt;&gt; incredible commitment, focus, and perseverance involved in becoming a
&gt; &gt;&gt; Navy SEAL, and I am grateful that there are people like that in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; U.S. military; I could never be a Navy SEAL.  That said, I have often
&gt; &gt;&gt; wondered, why the Navy makes it so difficult to become a SEAL.  In
&gt; &gt;&gt; other words, as I understand it, the mission of the SEALs (among other
&gt; &gt;&gt; things) is to sneak ashore ahead of amphibious invasions, scout out
&gt; &gt;&gt; the terrain without engaging the enemy, and sneak back without getting
&gt; &gt;&gt; caught or shot at.  Now with all due respect for the mission, and I'm
&gt; &gt;&gt; sure it's a dangerous one, why would you force recruits to go through
&gt; &gt;&gt; all the things you see on the Discovery Channel, like &quot;surf torture&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; and Hell Week, and all the other things involved with BUD/S?  I would
&gt; &gt;&gt; think you would want to select the sneakiest, most evasive sailors,
&gt; &gt;&gt; rather than selecting for the absolute toughest, most rugged
&gt; &gt;&gt; individuals.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Again, maybe this is a clue as to why I am not a high-level manager in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the Navy, but this is a question that has often crossed my mind as I
&gt; &gt;&gt; watch those Discovery Channel specials.

&gt; I appreciate your sentiment, but this is the mindset that regular Marines,

Formerly outside the gate at Subic Bay Naval base.  You crossed into
town on a bridge over the Perfume river. As to whether that was the
real name or a nom du rive (pardon my french {attempt}) I do not
know.  We (and thousands of US sailors before and after) called it
Shit River (it was sadly, an open sewer.)  Young girls in full length
formal dresses would stand/pose in the small dug-out boats a beg you
to toss coins into the boat.  Jerks (unfortunately a large majority of
the sailors) would purposely toss the coins 'near' the boat but into
the sewer.  The younger brothers who manned the tiller would then dive
into the sludge and invariably come up with the  peso or two.  How, in
unknown as the water had the consistency of chocolate milk.  A sad
statement on what young sailors from a supposedly civilized country
would find amusing.

No, Fred. There wasn't any SEAL out there that could do arty, mortars, NGF,
CAS or CIFS like I could. There's no reason to believe that a SEAL is a
better machinegunner than a Marine from a MEU (SOC) unit. SEALs wouldn't
know how to fight out of a tank (I did back in the day, in an M-60, as a
loader), they wouldn't be particularly great at fighting out of AAVs like
Marines are, and there is no reason to believe that a SEAL is going to be
better rushing out the ramp of a helo than a straightline Marine grunt.

SEALs are good at very specific stuff, but there is no reason to consider
them the &quot;very best&quot;. A shitload of people in other MOS's and various
branches could qualify - they just don't want to. They'd rather do their
job.

As for SEAL training being harsh, I guess being in 10th Marines was a walk
in the park. Ignoring the heart attacks and smashed knees...

It occurs to me that the really incredible stuff is soldiers, naval infantry
(Marines), sailors and aircrew doing their regular thing. I suspect that the
death rate for elite units is rather less than it is for line units. With
some exceptions - one probably would not have wanted to be Grossdeutschland
or any SS Panzer unit or be a German submariner to have longevity.

&gt; &gt; in the situation.  There are many that believe they would not step up,
&gt; &gt; and then are suddenly surprised that they acted without thinking and
&gt; &gt; exhibited a courage they never believed they posessed.
&gt; &gt;   I have personally seen a couple that talked a great story, and to
&gt; &gt; thier credit probably believed they would act heroically.  But when
&gt; &gt; the incident presented itself to act, they froze or retreated.

&gt; Good points. You never know, and can only hope you will be up to it.
&gt; You'll likely get no warning. What was it Napoleon said about 'le
&gt; courage a deux heures du matin' or something like that.

&gt; &gt; I will raise a glass tonight in his honor.  (Ok, not like it takes a
&gt; &gt; whole lot to get me to raise a glass ;)

&gt; Thanks, Sean. Sorry to bully you into it. Still, I wasn't exactly
&gt; pointing a sawn-off shotgun in your direction to make you pick up the
&gt; glass. Put it back down, there's a good boy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that my comment above about &quot;my woman&quot; does not imply any
&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of ownership. More than my bleeding life is worth, mate. She might
&gt; &gt; &gt; read this, too, and not go all the way to the end. I'm in trouble.

&gt; &gt; Discretion being...

&gt; A real problem. Back down to 600 feet, and rig for depth-charging. You
&gt; know what these pesky females are like.

I served near the Perfume river. Hometown friend was a doctor on board
a squadron of LSTs. They did Subic City as a liberty port. His comment
was that he wished he had done his specialty in VD as the entire span
of possibilities was represented in three nights of liberty.
