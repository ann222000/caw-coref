I am going to be releasing a new version of the engine soon. Here are
a few things that will be added:

Some minor speed improvements.
New Broad Phase Detectors.
Compatibility with Xbox360 (I need this tested again with the new
code.)
Fixes for support of serialization.
Support for filtering collision events using ignorers. (I still need
to test this)

If anyone wants to tell me about some bugs or unexpected behavior now
I the time to tell me.

Nice to know that a new release is coming!
What I would like to see are some tutorials or a documentation.
The one demo is big. I think it is better to split the demo in more
than one demo. Maybe link all demos together to one demo for
presentations.

Hey accAgon,
Your right, documentation files and more source code samples would
be great; but your talking about one person here!
So, I uploaded a simple &quot;tutorial&quot; project, which is in VB.NET '05. I
mean very simple too, it just creates a box, a floor, then applies
gravity.
I hope to advance the VB tutorials to show more as I become more
familiar with the physics engine myself.

Hi Daniel Story ,

thanks for a tutorial. But I'm programming in C# and a VB.Net tutorial
isn't really a help.
But for VB.Net programmer I think it can help.

I have created a small tutorial it incomplete but can be finished
later:
http://code.google.com/p/physics2d/wiki/BasicIntroduction
Tell me what you think.

The tutorial is short but helps a lot for the first steps.
What I miss are examples how to use a graphic library like sdl with
the physic engine.

Since the event ignore was untested it was broken (go figure). I have
fixed it but I have decided I really don't like how complicated
setting up an ignorer is. Next version I may completely redesign it.
This version it will remain the way it is.

I have also tested Xbox360 Compiling. (I would like to have a
confirmation of this by another source though)

One feature I forgot to mention was that MultipartPolygon now has a
CreateFromBitmap that will return multiple polygons if there are
multiple polygons in a bitmap. The new 'U' demo demonstrates this. The
immovable platforms were all parsed from one giant bitmap.

So has anyone found any bugs (in the SVN)? I would hate to make a
release with bugs in it that can be easily fixed.

It seems you are running on linux. And it seems I failed to localize
the datadir path.

Try to replace

static readonly string dataDir = @&quot;..\..\..\data&quot;;

with

static readonly string dataDir = @&quot;../../../data&quot;;

in the demo.cs file.

And see if it will work.

The last slash is correct because of the line
Path.Combine(dataDir, &quot;FreeSans.ttf&quot;)

I'll commit a smarter fix when I get home. (I hope that is the only
problem on Linux)

This definitely looks like a bug with the Tao framework.

I would recommend downloading the newest version of both SDL.NET and
Tao. (though I thought the SVN had the most recent versions) Maybe
even recompiling them for Mono.  If that does not work you could try
their SVN version of Toa.OpenGL.

BTW how are you compiling this on Linux? Does Mono Develop have a
converter for 2005 solution files now?

No, I tried my own compiled sdl.net library's.
The only solution which is left is to compile tao framework on my
own.

&gt; Have you had any luck with this issue?

&gt; &gt; I'm using your svn dlls. Maybe I should use my own compiled ones.
&gt; &gt; Yeah, monodevelop has a converter for VS 2005 files.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This definitely looks like a bug with the Tao framework.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would recommend downloading the newest version of both SDL.NET and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tao. (though I thought the SVN had the most recent versions) Maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; even recompiling them for Mono.  If that does not work you could try
&gt; &gt; &gt; their SVN version of Toa.OpenGL.

&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW how are you compiling this on Linux? Does Mono Develop have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; converter for 2005 solution files now?
