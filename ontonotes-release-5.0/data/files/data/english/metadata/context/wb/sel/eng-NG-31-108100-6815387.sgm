Hi All - didja miss me? I'm still on the road so I don't visit here
very much.

Last fall I asked here for advice on getting my 39 foot 5er up the
coast. So said go ahead - it's an adventure; some said - no way!

Well, I did it and I really enjoyed it. Much of the highway is KPRA 30
restricted (over 30 feet kingpin to rear axle not recommended). We're
just over KPRA 27 so I knew I could make it. At KPRA 30 I would have
been over the lines.

If you're a good driver and not easily distracted and you have 1st
rate equipment (e.g. lots of power and VERY good brakes) then you can
take this wonderful trip too.

I wish I had done the trip north to south so that the rig would be
away from the cliff face. There were a few places I thought I might
rip off my awning (or worse). The cliff is actually cut back further
at car level then is pretty much even with the white line higher up.

The section below San Fran was the most challenging but the really
tough part was under 2 and a half hours driving. I started to get
worried as I took Hwy 1 right through San Francisco. There was a lot
of traffic and I'm pretty sure my trailer brakes were fading. If it
got any worse, I would have stopped.

The Golden Gate was a nice reward after a tough drive.

Oregon and Washington have their tough parts too, but on the whole are
not as "good / bad" as the CA part.

Still one more month on the road, then home...

Cheers, Joe
