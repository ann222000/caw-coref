Is Gay Marriage Anti Black???

By Kenyon Farrow

I was in Atlanta on business when I saw the Sunday, Feb. 29th edition
of the Atlanta Journal Constitution that featured as its cover story
the issue of gay marriage. Georgia is one of the states prepared to
add some additional language to its state constitution that bans same
sex marriages (though the state already defines marriage between a man
and a woman, so the legislation is completely symbolic as it is
political).

What struck me about the front page story was the fact that all of the
average Atlanta citizens who were pictured that opposed gay marriages
were black people. This is not to single out the Atlanta Journal
Constitution, as  I have noticed in all of the recent coverage and
hubbub over gay marriage that the media has been real crucial in
playing up the racial politics of the debate.

For example, the people who are in San Francisco getting married are
almost exclusively white whereas many of the people who are shown
opposing it are black. And it is more black people than typically
shown in the evening news (not in handcuffs).  This leaves me with
several questions: Is gay marriage a black/white issue? Are the Gay
Community and the Black Community natural allies or sworn enemies? And
where does that leave me, a black gay man, who does not want to get
married?

Same-sex Marriage and Race Politics

My sister really believes that this push for gay marriage is actually
not being controlled by gays &amp; lesbians. She believes it is actually
being tested in various states by the Far Right in disguise, in an
effort to cause major fractures in the Democratic Party to distract
from all the possible roadblocks to re-election for George W. in
November such as an unpopular war and occupation, the continued loss
of jobs, and growing revelations of the Bush administration's ties to
corporate scandals.

Whatever the case, it is important to remember that gay marriage
rights are fraught with racial politics, and that there is no question
that the public opposition to same-sex marriages is in large part
being financially backed by various right-wing Christian groups like
the Christian Coalition and Family Research Council.  Both groups have
histories and overlapping staff ties to white supremacist groups and
solidly oppose affirmative action but play up some sort of Christian
allegiance to the black Community when the gay marriage issue is
involved.

For example, in 1990's the Traditional Values Coalition produced a
short documentary called &quot;Gay Rights, Special Rights,&quot; which was
targeted at black churches to paint non-heterosexual people as only
white and upper class, and as sexual pariahs, while painting black
people as pure, chaste, and morally superior.

The video juxtaposed images of white gay men for the leather/S&amp;M
community with the voice of Dr. Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;
speech, leaving conservative black viewers with the fear that the
Civil Rights Movement was being taken over by morally debased human
beings. And since black people continue to be represented as hyper
sexual beings and sexual predators in both pop culture and the mass
media (pimps &amp; players, hoochies &amp; hos, rapists of white women &amp;
tempters of white men), conservative black people often cling to the
other image white America hoists onto black people as well - asexual
and morally superior (as seen in the role of the black talk show host
and the role of the black sage/savior-of-white people used in so many
Hollywood movies, like In America and The Green Mile, which are all
traceable to Mammy and Uncle Remus-type caricatures).

Since the Christian Right has money and access to corporate media,
they set the racial/sexual paradigm that much of America gets in this
debate, which is that homos are rich and white and do not need any
such special protections and that black people are black - a
homogeneous group who, in this case, are Christian, asexual (or hetero-
normative), morally superior, and have the right type of &quot;family
values.&quot; This, even though black families are consistently painted as
dysfunctional and are treated as such in the mass media and in public
policy, which has devastating effects on black self-esteem, and urban
and rural black communities' ability to be self-supporting, self-
sustaining, and self determining.

The lack of control over economic resources, high un/underemployment,
lack of adequate funding for targeted effective HIV prevention and
treatment, and the large numbers of black people in prison (nearly one
million of the 2.2 million U.S. prison population) are all ways that
black families (which include non-heterosexuals) are undermined by
public policies often fueled by right wing &quot;tough on crime&quot; and &quot;war
on drugs&quot; rhetoric.

Given all of these social problems that largely plague the black
community (and thinking about my sister's theory), one has to wonder
why this issue would rise to the surface in an election year, just
when the Democratic ticket is unifying. And it is an issue, according
to the polls anyway, that could potentially strip the Democratic Party
of it solid support from African-American communities.

And even though several old-guard civil rights leaders (including
Coretta Scott King, John Lewis, Revs. Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson)
have long supported equal protection under the law for the gay,
lesbian, bisexual and transgender community (which usually, but not
always means support of same-sex marriage), the right wing continues
to pit gay marriage (and by extension, gay civil rights) against black
political interests, by relying on conservative black people to
publicly speak out against it (and a lot has been written about how
several black ministers received monies from right-wing organizations
to speak out against same-sex marriages in their pulpits).

But many black leaders, including some I've been able to catch on
television recently despite the right-wing's spin on the matter, have
made the argument that they know too well the dangers that lie in
&quot;separate but equal&quot; rhetoric. So, if many of our black leaders
vocally support same-sex marriage, how has the Christian Right been
able to create such a wedge between the black community and the gay
community?

Homophobia in Black Popular Culture

Some of the ways that the Christian Right-wing has been so successful
in using same-sex marriage as a wedge issue is by both exploiting
homophobia in the black community and also racism in the gay
community.  In regards to homophobia in the black community the focus
of conversation has been about the Black Churches' stance on
homosexuality.

It has been said many times that while many black churches remain
somewhat hostile places for non-heterosexual parishioners, it is also
where you will in fact find many black gays and lesbians. Many of them
are in positions of power and leadership within the church - ushers,
choir members/directors, musicians, and even preachers themselves.

But let me debunk the myth that the Black Church is the black
community. The black community is in no way monolithic, nor are black
Christians. The vast majority of black people who identify as
&quot;Christian&quot; do not attend any church whatsoever. Many black Americans
have been Muslim for over a century and there are larger numbers of
black people who are proudly identifying as Yoruba, Santero/a, and
atheists as well.

The black community in America is also growing more ethnically
diverse, with a larger, more visible presence of Africans, West
Indians, and Afro-Latinos amongst our ranks. We have always been
politically diverse, with conservatives, liberals, radicals and
revolutionaries alike (and politics do not necessarily align with what
religion you may identify as your own). It is also true that we are
and have always been sexually diverse and multi-gendered. Many of our
well-known Black History Month favorites were in fact Gay, Bisexual,
Lesbian, or Transgender.

Despite our internal diversity, we are at a time (for the last 30
years) when black people are portrayed in the mass media-mostly
through hip-hop culture-as being hyper-sexual and hyper-heterosexual
to be specific.  Nowhere is the performance of black masculinity more
prevalent than in hip-hop culture, which is where the most palpable
form of homophobia in American culture currently resides.

This of course is due largely to the white record industry's notions
of who we are, which they also sell to non-black people.   Remember
pop culture has for the last 150 years been presenting blackness to
the world - initially as white performers in blackface, to black
performers in black face, and currently to white, black and other
racial groups performing blackness as something that connotes sexual
potency and a propensity for violent behavior, which are also
performed as heterosexuality.

And with the music video, performance is important (if not more) than
song content.  As black hip-hop artists perform gangsta and Black
Nationalist revolutionary forms of masculinity alike, so follows overt
homophobia and hostility to queer people, gay men in particular.
Recently, DMX's video and song &quot;Where the Hood At?&quot; contained some of
the most blatant and hateful homophobic lyrics and images I have seen
in about a decade.

The song suggests that the &quot;faggot&quot; can and will never be part of the
&quot;hood&quot; for he is not a man. The song and video are particularly
targeted at black men who are not out of the closet, and considered on
the &quot;down low.&quot;  Although challenged by DMX, the image of the &quot;down
low&quot; brother is another form of performance of black masculinity,
regardless of actual sexual preference.

But it's not just &quot;commercial&quot; rap artists being homophobic.
&quot;Conscious&quot; hip-hop artists such as Common, Dead Prez and Mos Def have
also promoted homophobia through their lyrics, mostly around notions
of &quot;strong black families,&quot; and since gay black men (in theory) do not
have children, we are somehow anti-family and antithetical to what a
&quot;strong black man&quot; should be.

Lesbians (who are not interested in performing sex acts for the
pleasure of men voyeurs) are also seen as anti-family, and not a part
of the black community. A woman &quot;not wanting dick&quot; in a nation where
black dick is the only tangible power symbol for black men is seen as
just plain crazy, which is also expressed in many hip-hop tunes.  None
of these artists interrogate their representations of masculinity in
their music, but merely perform them for street credibility.  And for
white market consumption.

It cannot be taken lightly that white men are in control of the record
industry as a whole (even with a few black entrepreneurs), and control
what images get played. Young white suburban males are the largest
consumer of hip-hop music. So performance of black masculinity (or
black sexuality as a whole) is created by white men for white men. And
since white men have always portrayed black men as sexually dangerous
and black women as always sexually available (and sexual violence
against black women is rarely taken seriously), simplistic
representations of black sexuality as hyper-heterosexual are important
to maintaining white supremacy and patriarchy, and control of black
bodies.

Black people are merely the unfortunate middlemen in an exchange
between white men. We consume the representations like the rest of
America.  And the more that black people are willing to accept these
representations as fact rather than racist fiction, the more
heightened homophobia in our communities tends to be.

Race and the Gay Community

While homophobia in the black community is certainly an issue we need
to address, blacks of all sexualities experience the reality that many
white gays and lesbians think that because they're gay, they
&quot;understand&quot; oppression, and therefore could not be racist like their
heterosexual counterparts. Bullshit.

America is first built on the privilege of whiteness, and as long as
you have white skin, you have a level of agency and access above and
beyond people of color, period. White women and white non-heteros
included. There is a white gay man named Charles Knipp who roams this
nation performing drag in blackface to sold-out houses, north and
south alike.  Just this past Valentine's day weekend, he performed at
the Slide Bar in NY's east village to a packed house of white queer
folks eager to see him perform &quot;Shirley Q Liquor,&quot; a welfare mother
with 19 kids.

And haven't all of the popular culture gay images on TV shows like
Will &amp; Grace, Queer as Folk, etc., been exclusively white?  No matter
how many black divas wail over club beats in white gay clubs all over
America (Mammy goes disco!) with gay men appropriating language and
other black cultural norms (specifically from black women), white gay
men continue to function as cultural imperialists the same way
straight white boys appropriate hip-hop (and let's not ignore that
white women have been in on the act, largely a result of Madonna
bringing white women into the game.).

There have always been racial tensions in the gay community as long as
there have been racial tensions in America, but in the 1990's, the
white gay community went mainstream, further pushing non-hetero people
of color from the movement.

The reason for this schism is that in order to be mainstream in
America, one has to be seen as white. And since white is normative,
one has to interrogate what other labels or institutions are seen as
normative in our society: family, marriage, and military service, to
name a few. It is then no surprise that a movement that goes for
&quot;normality&quot; would then end up in a battle over a dubious institution
like marriage (and hetero-normative family structures by extension).

And debates over &quot;family values,&quot; no matter how broad or narrow you
look at them, always have whiteness at the center, and are almost
always anti-black. As articulated by Robin D.G. Kelley in his book Yo
Mama's Dysfunktional, the infamous Moynihan report is the most
egregious of examples of how the black family structure has been
portrayed as dysfunctional, an image that still has influence on the
way in which black families are discussed in the media and controlled
by law enforcement and public policy.

Since black families are in fact presented and treated as
dysfunctional, this explains the large numbers of black children in
the hands of the state through foster care, and increasingly, prisons
(so-called &quot;youth detention centers&quot;). In many cases, trans-racial
adoptions are the result.  Many white same-sex unions take advantage
of the state's treatment of black families; after all, white queer
couples are known for adopting black children since they are so
&quot;readily&quot; available and also not considered as attractive or healthy
compared to white, Asian and Latino/a kids.

If black families were not labeled as dysfunctional or de-stabilized
by prison expansion and welfare &quot;reform,&quot; our children would not be
removed from their homes at the numbers they are, and there would be
no need for adoption or foster care in the first place.  So the fact
that the white gay community continues to use white images of same-sex
families is no accident, since the black family, heterosexual, same
sex or otherwise, is always portrayed as dysfunctional.

I also think the white gay community's supposed &quot;understanding&quot; of
racism is what has caused them to appropriate language and ideology of
the Black Civil Rights Movement, which has led to the bitter divide
between the two communities.  This is where I as a black gay man, am
forced to intervene in a debate that I find problematic on all sides.

Black Community and Gay Community - Natural Allies or Sworn Enemies?

As the gay community moved more to the right in the 1990's, they also
began to talk about Gay Rights as Civil Rights. Even today in this gay
marriage debate, I have heard countless well-groomed, well-fed white
gays and lesbians on TV referring to themselves as &quot;second-class
citizens.&quot;  Jason West, the white mayor of New Paltz,  NY, who started
marrying gay couples was quoted as saying, &quot;The same people who don't
want to see gays and lesbians get married are the same people who
would have made Rosa Parks go to the back of the bus.&quot;

It's these comparisons that piss black people off. While the anger of
black heteros is sometimes expressed in ways that are in fact
homophobic, the truth of the matter is that black folks are tired of
seeing other people hijack their shit for their own gains, and getting
nothing in return. Black non-heteros share this anger of having our
blackness and black political rhetoric and struggle stolen for other
people's gains.

The hijacking of Rosa Parks for their campaigns clearly ignores the
fact that white gays and lesbians who lived in Montgomery, AL and
elsewhere probably gladly made many a black person go to the back of
the bus. James Baldwin wrote in his long essay &quot;No Name in the Street&quot;
about how he was felt up by a white sheriff in a small southern town
when on a visit during the civil rights era.

These comparisons of &quot;Gay Civil Rights&quot; as equal to &quot;Black Civil
Rights&quot; really began in the early 1990's, and largely responsible for
this was Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and a few other mostly-white gay
organizations. This push from HRC, without any visible black
leadership or tangible support from black allies (straight and queer),
to equate these movements did several things: 1) Piss off the black
community for the white gay movement's cultural appropriation, and
making the straight black community question non-hetero black people's
allegiances, resulting in our further isolation. 2) Giving the (white)
Christian Right ammunition to build relationships with black ministers
to denounce gay rights from their pulpits based on the HRC's cultural
appropriation. 3) Create a scenario in their effort to go mainstream
that equates gay and lesbian with upper-class and white.

This meant that the only visibility of non-hetero poor people and
people of color wound up on Jerry Springer, where non-heteros who are
poor and of color are encouraged (and paid) to act out, and are
therefore only represented as dishonest, violent, and pathological.

So, given this difficult history and problematic working relationship
of the black community and the gay community, how can the gay
community now, at its most crucial hour, expect large scale support of
same-sex marriage by the black community when there has been no real
work done to build strategic allies with us? A new coalition has
formed of black people, non-hetero and hetero, to promote same-sex
marriage equality to the black community, and I assume to effectively
bridge that disconnect, and to in effect, say that gay marriage ain't
just a white thing. Or is it?

Is Gay Marriage Anti - Black?

I, as a black gay man, do not support this push for same-sex marriage.
Although I don't claim to represent all black gay people, I do believe
that the manner in which this campaign has been handled has put black
people in the middle of essentially two white groups of people, who
are trying to manipulate us one way or the other.  The Christian
Right, which is in fact anti-black, has tried to create a false
alliance between themselves and blacks through religion to push
forward their homophobic, fascist agenda.

The white gay civil rights groups are also anti-black, however they
want black people to see this struggle for same-sex unions as
tantamount to separate but equal Jim Crow laws.  Yet any close
examination reveals that histories of terror imposed upon generations
of all black people in this country do not in any way compare to what
appears to be the very last barrier between white gays and lesbians'
access to what bell hooks describes as &quot;christian capitalist
patriarchy.&quot;

That system is inherently anti-black, and no amount of civil rights
will ever get black people any real liberation from it. For, in what
is now a good 40 years of &quot;civil rights,&quot; nothing has intrinsically
changed or altered in the American power structure, and a few black
faces in inherently racist institutions is hardly progress.

Given the current white hetero-normative constructions of family and
how the institutions of marriage and nuclear families have been used
against black people, I do think that to support same-sex marriage is
in fact, anti-black (I also believe the institution of marriage to be
historically anti-woman, and don't support it for those reasons as
well).

At this point I don't know if I am totally opposed to the institution
of marriage altogether, but I do know that the campaign would have to
happen on very different terms for me to support same-sex marriages.
At this point, the white gay community is as much to blame as the
Christian Right for the way they have constructed the campaign,
including who is represented, and their appropriation of black civil
rights language.

Along with how the campaign is currently devised, I struggle with same-
sex marriage because, given the level of homophobia in our society
(specifically in the black community), and racism as well, I think
that even if same-sex marriage becomes legal, white people will access
that privilege far more than black people.  This is especially the
case with poor black people, who regardless of sexual preference or
gender, are struggling with the most critical of needs (housing, food,
gainful employment), which are not at all met by same-sex marriage.

Some black people (men in particular) might not try to access same-sex
marriage because they do not even identify as &quot;gay&quot; partly because of
homophobia in the black community, but also because of the fact that
racist white queer people continue to dominate the public discourse of
what &quot;gay&quot; is, which does not include black people of the hip-hop
generation by and large.

I do fully understand that non-heteros of all races and classes may
cheer this effort for they want their love to be recognized, and may
want to reap some of the practical benefits that a marriage
entitlement would bring - health care (if one of you gets health care
from your job in the first place) for your spouse, hospital visits
without drama or scrutiny, and control over a deceased partner's
estate.

But, gay marriage, in and of itself, is not a move towards real, and
systemic liberation. It does not address my most critical need as a
black gay man to be able to walk down the streets of my community with
my lover, spouse or trick, and not be subjected to ridicule, assault
or even murder. Gay marriage does not adequately address homophobia or
transphobia, for same-sex marriage still implies binary opposite
thinking, and transgender folks are not at all addressed in this
debate.

What does gay marriage mean for all Black people?

But what does that mean for black people? For black non-heteros,
specifically? Am I supposed to get behind this effort, and convince
heterosexual black people to do the same, especially when I know the
racist manner in which this campaign has been carried out for over ten
years? And especially when I know that the vast majority of issues
that my community-The Black Community, of all orientations and genders-
are not taken nearly this seriously when it comes to crucial life and
death issues that we face daily like inadequate housing and health
care, HIV/AIDS, police brutality, and the wholesale lockdown of an
entire generation in America's grotesquely large prison system.

How do those of us who are non-heterosexual and black use this as an
opportunity to deal with homophobia, transphobia and misogyny in our
communities, and heal those larger wounds of isolation,
marginalization and fear that plague us regardless of marital status?
It is the undoing of systems of domination and control that will lead
to liberation for all of ourselves, and all of us as a whole.

In the end, I am down for black people who oppose gay marriage-other
folks &quot;in the life&quot; as well as straight, feminists, Christians,
Muslims, and the like. But I want more than just quotes from Leviticus
or other religious and moral posturing. I want to engage in a
meaningful critical conversation of what this means for all of us,
which means that I must not be afraid to be me in our community, and
you must not be afraid of me. I will struggle alongside you, but I
must know that you will also have my back.
