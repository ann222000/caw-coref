I once heard a preacher tell a church congregation that he'd quit
hanging around some of his old friends because, as he put it &quot;I want to
get around righteous folks!&quot; Why did he not believe these friends of
his were righteous? He mentioned one of them watching &quot;Hell's Box
Office&quot; and &quot;Sin-to-the-Max&quot; on cable TV.

What does this say about that preacher's definition of righteousness?
It is based on a person's performance. And unfortunately many of us
have this idea that our righteousness, or whether God finds us pleasing
to Him, is based on our performance.

The Bible says &quot;4Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to
him as a gift, but as an obligation. 5However, to the man who does not
work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as
righteousness. 6David says the same thing when he speaks of the
blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from
works:
7&quot;Blessed are they
whose transgressions are forgiven,
whose sins are covered.
8Blessed is the man
whose sin the Lord will never count against him.&quot;
Think about that! God credits righteousness to us who believe, apart
from our works! He will never count sin against us! How awesome!

The Bible presents a decidedly non-works-based definition of
righteousness. It's credited to us by God, apart from our works. We're
righteous because God says we are, and that's the end of that
discussion!

Is that a liscence to sin? If you want to look at it that way. I look
at it as a liscence to be accepted by God, a liscence to come into
God's presence and enjoy friendship with Him without my flaws and
imperfections condemning me. The only way I or any of us will ever meet
God's standard of righteousness is if it is creditted to us apart from
our works.

In the passage I quoted above, it says the wages of someone who works
are not considered a gift but an obligation. What would it be like if
you could earn your salvation? If you could earn blessings from God?
Would He get credit or would you? I'm thankful that God has given me as
a gift something so precious, something I could never earn, and all the
glory goes to Him!

Sometimes there are people who come to know Jesus while living the
&quot;wild life&quot;. They may at one time or another lived a life many would
consider outside the standards of the &quot;good Christian life&quot;. They are
told you are saved by the blood of Christ, but now you need to change
how you live. The great message they received from the Gospel begins
to change its message- You need to leave your old friends, your old
ways, your old habits, your old unhealthy destructive ways and if you
don't you will not be living God's Way. I think Jesus takes them were
there at and continues to minister to them where they are at- and He
works with their hearts. The inward change begins and continues as He
chooses. He loves that person and He knows what He will do with that
heart. I just hope I'll stand out of His way and let Him do His job.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: whenever a person draws a
line between The Righteous People and The Unrighteous People, and then
announces, &quot;Look at me, Lord! I'm on the right side of the line! Lord?
Lord?&quot;, that person won't find Jesus on his side of the line. Jesus
will always be on the other side of the line, hanging with The
Unrighteous People.

Man,

oh man oh man, without this being the truth there is no way that I'd
know Jesus. While I was the vilest, lowest of the lows, He let me know
what He wanted...just me. Not my behaviors; but me. There isn't any
way of knowing when my attitudes or actions are &quot;right&quot; unless they are
purely loving and I can be so confused when trying to know which way is
&quot;up&quot; that I just have to say: Thank you for taking care of it ALL
Jesus. Believe me, I know when I'm on the &quot;other side of the
line&quot;(when I'm intentionally dwelling on something that would probably
cause someone some emotional pain cuz they Love me) and the curious
thing about it is that Jesus is with me there too. Certainly not
endorsing anything not of Faith, but providing me with the beacon of
His Love to stay with him even though my shame or guilt would have me
running from G-d. Jesus, please tell them it's true...You've never
left me and never will.

Another unrighteous one,
a

I absolutely love the following poem. I received it when I was 18
years old and struggling with relationships and all kinds of other
junk. I don't even remember who gave it to me. This poem and others
like it have kept me &quot;centered&quot;. Being &quot;centered&quot; is key to me:
staying in the here and now and knowing that Jesus and those He has
given me to love me are with me each step at a time now and throughout
eternity. Enjoy.

&quot;I'M HIDING&quot;
(Anonymous)

&quot;I'm hiding, Lord
And tired of the masquerade.
The costume bag has been exhausted.
The masks are worn and ragged.
365 days of Halloween is not a treat.

I'm hiding because I'm frightened . . .
Of the smiles covering tears
And paint covering years,
And just the whole game of hide and seek.

This morning I put the costume bag in the attic.
This afternoon I must venture out with no cover-ups,
No tricks and no gimmicks.
Just the timid, sensitive, caring individual You made me,
Seeking perhaps just one more
Who wants out of the game.
And together we go through life unafraid,
Seeing not only the surface, but beneath.
Sharing even the daydreams,
And the crazy, childlike fantasies Of life together.

Lord, smooth out the rough edges of the real me.

I've never played that role before.

Amen.&quot;

Hi you all:

Remember what Jesus said in Matthew 6:33:

&quot;And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field
grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon
in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God
clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is
thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little
faith. So do not worry, saying, `What shall we eat?' or `What shall
we drink?' or `What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these
things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. . .

But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things
will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow,
for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of
its own.&quot;

One needs to have the proper understanding of the word &quot;righteousness&quot;
here for sure!! I've seen people take this to mean that God requires
our righteous behavior as a prerequisite to receive anything good in
this life or for Him to want to have anything to do with us. I used
to ponder that myself when I read this verse.

UNTIL the Lord showed me it's HIS righteousness I need to be seeking.
AND His righteousness has NOTHING to do with my behavior. HIS
righteousness IS Jesus Christ. What a relief! No wonder the days are
easier when I'm seeking my Jesus to walk with me through them. I'm not
looking at what I'm doing: whether I'm good or bad or right or wrong. I
no longer have to worry about tomorrow as far as having to be in
control of it. I can let our Lord take that burden for me.

&quot;So do not worry, saying, `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we
drink?' or `What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these
things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.&quot;

As our Lord walks with me during the &quot;trouble&quot; in my life right now He
is telling me, &quot;So don't worry, Pam, about what's going to happen to
your daughter and grandchild. I know what you need. I know what Laura
needs. I know what Dave and Phil and Kyle and Holly and all your
friends need in this situation. Keep seeking me.&quot;

Jesus Christ IS righteousness.

&quot;So do not worry, saying, `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we
drink?' or `What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these
things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.&quot;

I just looked up the word &quot;pagen&quot; in the dictionary. It simply means
&quot;non-religious&quot;. It used to mean non-Christian. I like the current
definition much better.

It seems to me that the pagans have a great point here!!! I've often
worried about where we'd get money for the next meal and whether or not
our children would have adequate clothing to go to school. I haven't
much worred about a water supply, although many in America do have that
problem right now. I worried continuously when my children were younger
about whether or not we'd live in the slums because I thought Phil
would lose his job. Worry was my constant companion.

As the Lord taught me the definition of &quot;righteousness&quot; - that it IS
Jesus - I started to compare myself with the non-religious. I had, and
still do at times, a lot in common with pagens! A pagen does not run
to God for help and believe that He's with him or her. My worry was and
still is a sign that I am not relying on a &quot;power greater than myself
to restore me to sanity.&quot; (AA: Step 2)

At times, I have a lot of empathy for the non-religious!! Each time I
worry.

In times like that I am thankful that the Biblical definition of the
word &quot;righteousness&quot; has nothing to do with my behavior. Nothing!!!
If it did, my worry would be compounded in that I'd be looking at
myself as never measuring up. I might be thinking, &quot;You must not be a
Christian, Pam, because you worry. You are a pagan.&quot;

Thank God He loves the non-religious. Jesus loves the pagen.

That's because Jesus Christ IS righteousness and we are not!!

Thank GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love you Jesus.

Years ago I proclaimed to a heroin addict that the Lord loves him even
though he was destroying his life. He looked up at me with tears
streaming down his face. He said he didn't expect me to say that. He
expected me to ream him. His mother was furious at me for telling him
how much Jesus loves him. She wanted me to tell him that the Lord
would not put up with him until he cleaned up his act. When I let her
know that I couldn't lie to her son, she went back to her church and
told her friends there that Metro West Outreach OK's sin.

Another time I told a client that Jesus forgave her for her sin of
malicious gossip. The Lord had opened her heart to show her how
destructive gossip is. She was in tears as she pointed out the
specifics of the habit. I proclaimed to her, as is typical for me to
do, that the Lord had not only gifted her with &quot;seeing&quot; how big the
problem of gossip is, but that He also 100% forgave her for it. She
screamed at me! Seriously! &quot;Don't tell me that,&quot; she said, &quot;God is
stupid to forgive me. I need to be punished. I want to keep believing
that God will punish me for my sin because that's the only thing that
will stop me from doing it.&quot; I reminded her that her attempt to
control the problem by rejecting the Lord's forgiveness was obviously
not working. In fact, based on the evidence she had shared, her
problem was getting much worse. She didn't buy that. I never saw her
again.

Neither woman was seeking God's righteousness which would have led them
to understand His love for the sinner.

Today, let's not get sidetracked by staring at our sins, our bad habits
and patterns. In other words, let's not seek after our own
righteousness to solve our problems because we don't have any.

&quot;But seek first . . . HIS righteousness . . . &quot;

Jesus IS righteousness. In HIM we'll not only find forgiveness, but
we'll find His help to overcome things we do to cause problems for
ourselves and others.

Jesus IS righteousness. Not ME! Cool.
