25 million years ago, on a planet named Minerva (where the asteroid belt
is now), there was a race of giant humanoids known to humans as
Ganymedes (since scientists first discovered evidence of their existence
on the Jovian moon Ganymede).  When the Ganymedes first evolved, they
had a poisonous secondary circulatory system which early Minervan
animals had developed to protect themselves from carnivores.  As a
result, there were no carnivores on the land.  This secondary system
made the Ganymedes very vulnerable to accidents.  Even the slightest cut
would kill them be releasing the poison into their primary circulatory
systems.  The Ganymedes figures out how to neutralize their secondary
systems, first by eating certain plants and molds, then via surgery,
then by eliminating the gene that creates that system.  Unfortunately,
the Ganymedes eliminated their ability to tolerate high carbon dioxide
levels when they eliminated their secondary systems, so their geese were
cooked when CO2 levels started to soar.

PP 149-150 of paperback: Danchekker tells Hunt how the Ganymedes tried
to solve the CO2 problem.  They considered holding down the CO2 level
through artificial means, but they feared that they would destroy
Minerva's greenhouse effect in the process, freezing the planet.  They
worked out a way to heat up the Sun to compensate, but a test of that
method by the Ganymede ship Shapieron on the star Iscaris blew up that
star.  They considered moving to Earth, but didn't think they could
survive with Earth's predators, and couldn't stomach the idea of wiping
out Earth's life forms.  Why didn't the Ganymedes simply build and
deploy solar mirrors in orbit for the purpose of heating up Minerva if
the greenhouse effect got destroyed?

&gt; &gt; (..snip..)
&gt; &gt; Back on Turle, why didn't anyone suggest taking the Borijan
&gt; &gt; civilization underground to escape from the radiation?

&gt; Because they had too short time, I suppose.  And if someone did manage
&gt; to build one, it'd be available right there for everyone to fight for.
&gt; (Or connive for, or whatever.)  OTOH spaceships, once they had left,
&gt; would be safe from other Borijans.

&gt; &gt; Why did Sarvik try to leave
&gt; &gt; his computer behind?

&gt; Knowning that computer I'm kind of sympathetic with that choice.
&gt; Though I suppose the reason would be more like, competition from
&gt; a being which was more experienced at being a computer than Sarvik.

&gt; &gt; Another idea would have been for Farworlds to
&gt; &gt; send the generation ships to the most hospitable of the planets on
&gt; &gt; which it had factory projects, and directing those factories to
&gt; &gt; prepare those planets for colonization.  This would reduce the
&gt; &gt; amount of supplies needed by the generation ships.

&gt; Apart from the plot needing it?  Don't remember if anything touched on
&gt; it.  Wanted a less ruined ecology, maybe.

Come to think of it, how would automated factories go about building an
ecosystem?

Probably because they were controlled by the mind of James P. Hogan.
