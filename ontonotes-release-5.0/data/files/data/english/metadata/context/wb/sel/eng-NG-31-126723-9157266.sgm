Im babysitting a 7 year old who has a ton of labels and was also just returned from foster care.  She has been throwing mega fits and will also say things like Im supid, I hate myself, etc. I just kills me to hear that and Im nto sure the best way to handle it.

I have a high spirited 8 year old and severly autistic 6 yo so Im used to the mega fits that can last hours..... the I hate myself stuff is new. I think she can sense that it bothers me so bad therefore keeps saying it .

My youngest said things like that a lot when he was 5, 6 or 7.  Now that
he's older, I see that it was likely from an exaggerated conscience.  He
gets completely incapacitated by guilt feelings when he does something
wrong, even though there was no harm done.

When he was little and saying those things, I tried not to react too
strongly.  But in certain circumstances I did react earnestly by looking him
in the eye and telling him that I loved him no matter what.  When he said he
would rather be dead, I always, always told him that I would be very sad
without him in my life.  Sometimes I expanded on that to include Daddy and
his brothers and his grandparents, if he seemed to need extra reassurance.
Sometimes I just said, &quot;You won't always feel that way.&quot;

I'm not sure that professing your love for a girl you are only babysitting
is going to go over too well. Her issues are likely way deeper than my
son's.  But you can tell her that you enjoy being with her and that seeing
her unhappy makes you sad.  Don't let it &quot;bother&quot; you.  Those feelings can't
help.  Be confident that she's not stupid and find ways to tell her so and
pass that confidence on to her.  Be confident that she is
loved/liked/admired/respected and find ways to tell her and demonstrate to
her that it is true.

It's not going to go away right away.  If she is really feeling those
things, make sure she can express it to you, without too much drama that may
be paying off for her in other ways.

It's not supposed to *not* bother a person to hear that someone hates
themselves.  I certainly wouldn't want someone to think that I can sit
comfortably with those words, and I wouldn't want to behave like it's
acceptable to hear.  I'd like to think of a way to have a happy influence.

Somebody recently posted the link to a blog belonging to a musician.  It
covered the use of words like hate and should, among others.  That might
serve as an inspiration.  I didn't save it as I was flying through email and
maybe someone could repost it.

Well, there's bothering and then there's *bothering.*  There's no need to
panic at an expressed feeling.  There's no need for alarm, unless the child
is holding a gun to her head.  There *is* a need to respond.  Nothing in my
post said I could sit comfortably with those words, but I don't have to heap
my feelings about it on top to make it more than what it is.  No 7 year old
would really want to be dead.  No 7 year old is going to hate themselves
every minute of every day for the rest of their lives.  Keeping it in
perspective helps the child keep things in perspective, too.

Thanks for the clarification.  I let myself get distracted and didn't
put that thought in even though I had it.  There are degrees to
anything and keeping things in perspective is the thing to do,
especially with a really big word like &quot;hate&quot; floating around.  No
need to add more to it.

My point is to seek to communicate a bit.  When a child is confiding
something that hard to deal with, s/he's asking something.  I think
it's important to make it plain that what the child said *is* worthy
of attention and not be silent hoping it all goes away, seeming as
though I didn't care how the child felt.  Something non verbal ..
stopping what I'm doing and turning my face toward the child and
listening would be simple and could lead to the child being able to
talk more openly about the trouble.  There's a lot of child abuse
going around, and I have heard that phrase come out of a child's mouth
before.  Maybe it's not as big of an issue as child abuse.  Maybe the
child feels unloved and unheard and needs someone to trust, and that's
all that's needed... a listening ear, attention.

Yes, communication.  My experience is that it's not a one-time thing.  The
first time you hear it, you have your normal reaction and surprise and
conversation, and a few more times you talk about it some more.  If a child
needs the whole long involved thing each time they say it, then by all
means....it has been my experience that a two or three word answer is
enough.  Then again, I have sons, who struggle with their feelings pretty
much solo and I only occasionally get a glimpse.  They don't want me to say
too much, ever.  This girl may be different.

Thanks for all the responses. A breif history. This little girl got a bruise because her brother pushed her into a doorknob. The school reported when she went to school the next day and told the counselor her mother shook and pushed her into a computer desk. She has been diagnosed as bipolar and adhd.

She was in foster care for 8 months. Thrown out of 6 foster homes and finally placed into a group home.

I can really understand her saying things like I hate myself and i just want to die. I have been following a recent thread at always unschooled and I think she needs to know that I can handle her and Im not going to send her away.

I think Im going to try not making a big deal of her words and not force as if its a punishment but encourage her to join me/us in everything we do.

Her mom is trying really hard but also raising 3 singly, working and going to school fulltime so this 7 year old gets pushed aside a lot, told to go outside and play and watch her little brother etc. Mom loves this girl dearly and i think she is truly trying but she is very overwhelmed right now.

I want to build this little girl up and make her feel loved but I dont want her to prefer me/ here to mom and alienate mom/daughter even more.

Nicole
