1. I just accessed the SGM archives at
http://groups.google.com/group/soc.genealogy.medieval/topics , and searched
on the phrase &quot;leek 2007&quot;.
Using both Explorer 7.0 and Safari 3.0.3 I get the same response: three
hits.
Using Firefox, Version 2.0.0.8, I get no hits.

2. When I access the August 2007 archives,
http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/index/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2007-08
with the default threaded listing, all three of these browsers cut off the
list after 11 August. If I change to chronological listing, the entire
month's postings are shown.

Can anyone verify or explain this bizarre behavior?

I get three with Firefox 2.0.0.8.

I don't know if this is the case in this instance, but many archiving
sites archive the posts daily (or more frequently), but only extract
the new posts for indexing periodically (weekly or monthly or even
longer).

When searching in Firefox, be sure that you do not begin with
quotation marks.  If you do (&quot;leek 2007), the search will produce only
results that include leek and 2007 in that exact order and placement.
If you search without the quotation marks (leek 2007), you will get
three hits.

This anomaly is probably due to a server crash at RootsWeb.  It is
possible that the threaded list can be regenerated from the
chronological list.  The way to inquire about this problem or request
rethreading is to go to the RootsWeb Help Desk,
http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/ , and click on the HelpDesk link near the
bottom of the box at the left; equivalently, click on the link for Error
Reports (Technical).  Anyone can do this.
