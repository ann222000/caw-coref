I'm kind of stumped as to which direction I should be going in.  I've
been strength training for the past six months and notice a major
difference in my upper body strength.  I have also been doing crunches
and leg raises, but my abs still have a small layer of fat over them.
Some people tell me I need to up my calorie intake to build muscle,
while others say I need to cut my calorie intake to burn the fat.  If
I cut my calorie intake, will it negatively affect my muscle growth,
or will I just lose fat?  I've been doing some major cardio exercise
lately (20-25mi bicycle rides daily) but am not sure if that is the
right thing to be doing.

Thanks.

First thing to note, for the record, is that you may be genetically
predisposed to storing most of your fat around the abs.  Men in
general are like this, relative to women, but certain racial/ethnic
groups, like indigenous Mexicans, seem to really store fat around the
waist -- just the facts, that -- so bear that in mind when all else
fails.  (Don't know how much you know, but a lot of people don't
realize that -- or the natural effects of age, for that matter.)

Having said that, if you lose your weight very slowly, like only half
a pound a week, you should be able to maintain your muscle mass while
burning off the fat.  It appears that the body turns to protein as a
last resort, so if you're supplying just enough calories for muscle
maintenance (and not necessarily further growth), and you diet and
exercise such that you're only losing half a pound to no more than a
pound a week, then over the course of a year (maybe even half a year)
you'll see your abs nicely defined.

The trick is in finding out that magic sweet spot where you're taking
in just enough calories, not too much, not too little, but just a
little bit less than what you need to make the body start burning fat
but not resort to also cannibalizing muscle.

The conventional wisdom says that if you increase calories and lift
weights, you'll add mostly muscle but also some fat, while if you reduce
calories and lift weights, you'll lose mostly fat but some muscle.  For
this reason, some people alternate between the two, depending on which
they feel is more important at the moment.  The cardio is better for fat
burning, not so good for increasing muscle or strength.

In other words, we aren't sure, either - use your judgement, experiment,
note the results, and adjust accordingly.  It's what we all do.

Did you think doing crunches would specifically reduce the fat over your
midsection? That must be why people who type away at the computer never
ever have pudgy hands, no matter how fat they are.

When you want to lose fat, you need to expend more energy than you take
in from food. You also should do some form of weight training to
minimise muscle loss.

When you want to gain muscle, you need to consume more energy than you
expend in order to supply you with the energy to create and maintain the
extra muscle.

Cheers,

Ari

Just one more question..  when I am cutting calories below my
maintenance level, do I factor in exercise?  Ie.) lets say I burned
2000 calories bicycling.  I only want to cut my calorie level by
200-500 cal. per day to avoid losing muscle as well as fat.  Would
this mean I have to eat more that day so I only have a 200-500 cal.
deficit?

Yes, count exercise. It's just looking at the same thing in two
different ways: 1) using exercise to create a calorie deficit while
eating maintenance calories, or 2) eating at a deficit below maintenance
plus exercise (as you've described). They're exactly the same thing and
you end up in exactly the same place.

People always makes this too complicated, when it's simple. Reduce
your weight training, adjust your calorie intake and increase your
cardio until you've lost the fat, then increase your weight training
to gain lean mass. There is no rule saying you have to do both at the
same time - it's just a greedy desire to have your cake and eat it
too.

I've been doing something similar over the last 10 months and am pretty
happy with the results in both fat loss and lean-body mass gain.  In that
time I've lost about 40 lbs bodyweight but increased LBM from doing a
combination of cardio (including 20-30 mi bike rides), weights and somewhat
reduced calorie intake.  Before/now pic here: http://tinyurl.com/2u955j
Seems that the weight training has helped both in losing fat and has been
almost solely responsible for the increase in LBM. While I prolly could've
gained more muscle if I'd eaten more and done less cardio, my emphasis has
been on fat loss, but with some LBM gain.

In answer to our question, I guess you need to decide whether you want to
emphasize fat loss or muscle gain. If you want to accelarate fat loss, as
your post indicates, then reduce calories further, but I'd imagine any LBM
gains will be reduced as well.
