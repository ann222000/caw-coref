I've made a lot of progress since my ex left me for another dude 2 yrs ago.
She went on to file an ugly court battle, etc.  The dude beat her a bit,
cheated on her then left her.  Me? I moved on from the get go.  But I still
have so much to be bitter about even though I try not too.. However, it is
important for me to be able to move on seperately with my life.  Even with
kids involved.  Bottom line is I threw in the towel last week and told her
we needed to stop fighting and start communicating for the kids.  Well here
we are a week later and I'm not liking talking to her.  Yep - its like it
was an invite to make it easy for her.  I'm not trying to punish her.  But
there is a history of me, her parents, anyone making it easy on her in life.
A lot of it is stuff about the kids I don't want to hear period cause it
sucks .  I don't want to hear that I got to pony up half of my kids glasses.
What about the one's I bought right at the seperation that she then lost at
her house?  Where does the money come from?  Isn't all the staggering
support I am paying covering anything?  Why does she always tell me she is
broke?  Man, being nice all of a sudden open up her giving me commentary on
my relationship with a gal friend.  Etc.  Perhaps the first few years need
to different...  Anyway, I'm just trying to find a balance.  Personally she
dumped me and I feel she should get like next to 0 of my time and energy.
Kids?  They've gotten all of dad since way before so this isn't about them.
Going back to the balance though - I consider myself a single dad with 3
kids.  That's my family.  That't been my family.  Wow for some reason I'm
really rethinking my being nice to her again.  I always feel crappy/get
duped in the end.  Total ramble sorry...

That's okay.  Its what this joint is for.
IMHO... Its entirely normal to get angry, blame others and decline
to acknowledge any role in this tragic mess, but with time+distance,
many of us look back with hindsight and accept we made choices,
starting with our selection of a spouse, that led almost inexorably to
the results we now face.  Nothing can ever justify what she did, but
could you have been a better person?  Well, now's your chance.

When you're dealing with a selfish narcissist or a con artist,
the old joke about how &quot;no good deed goes unpunished&quot;
seems to apply.

Rog's advice about being a better person is good, although
an ex who is a toxic narcissistic con artist will see
every bit of niceness as an opportunity to attempt
guilt trips, manipulation or worse.

If you didn't have kids together I'd recommend
completely cutting off absolutely all contact.

As it is the con artist knows she has you by the tail
and will abuse that situation.

If you are in a &quot;one party&quot; state for telephone recording
I would advise you to record all phone calls
between you and this con artist.

Over time you will be able to document her
attempts at giving you a guilt trip or conning you.
If you can prove this manipulative crap you might
be able to get the court to order her into some
kind of psychotherapy or at least a psych eval
to look this over regarding custody.

Have you tried &quot;I'm not calling for you to try
to give me some guilt trip or for you to try to
con me out of more money.  I'm calling
about the kids, not you.&quot;

If this woman is so manipulative, have you
wondered what effect this will have on the kids?
Won't her &quot;con artist&quot; or manipulative side
make the kids a little psychologically &quot;bent&quot;?

Thanks brother - I appreciate the kinder softer approach but man. Divorce
and the aftermath takes getting used too.  The whole thing is a bitter pill
to swallow.  This group around here is adamet about DO EVERYTHING FOR THE
CHILDREN.  Do they not read that often men who may have access to their
children are driven away or let themselves be driven away by these
narcassists?  At some point your like - damb this is worse than the maraige
and kids or not - I'm about to off myself.  Its like survival mode kicks in.
So back to the original topic...

In shared parenting how do you from experience deal with your narcissist or
nightmarically difficult ex over the long haul?

First, have you told her your expecations regarding your
interactions?  For example,

1.  you will not come to each others homes but will rather meet on
neutral ground (i.e. a park where the kids can play, a place where you
can dine or a movie)

2.  you will not bail her out money wise - what she gets is all she
will get, she needs to budget and basically 'grow up and be held
accountable for her decisions as well as indecisions).

3.  her relationships are her business - and as such, you do not want
to be her best new friend and hear about it everytime you get
together.  If her relationships blow up, that is for her to handle -
not you.  You are again, NOT her new best buddy and that line needs to
be kept.

4.  if she cannot get and keep her life in order, financially and
emotionally, you do not feel she should have custody (does she?) - in
the event she continually finds herself in dire straits you will take
action to gain custody - (take a 'no prisoners approach).

Look its simple - the divorce means she goes to her corner and you go
to yours and she stay there.  Not continually drag you back to save
her from herself.  If she has the kids, this means the courts for some
reason feel she is the better parent, so do not bail her out, do not
save her butt because she's apparently not the better parent if you
have to keep doing this.  Then you do what needs to be done - not for
you and not for her but for the kids.  Regardless of what the kids
want - they are children, they have no idea what is best for them -
and they will recover.  But can they recover from being constantly
broke or at odds with money?

This is not about love, its about children - and an adult that
apparently cannot comply with the law and tend to her children.  Think
about this legally for once okay - take out the emotions.  I wish I
had.

About the arguing - question - why?  Are you married?  Does this
person have any real decision making authority in your life? Then why
allow it?  Don't want to hurt her feelings?  Did she think about
yours?  Feelings - they really mess up what needs to be done.

As mean as I sound, just trust me - take out the emotion, write it all
down - think it over - and tell her, on no uncertain terms that your
wallet is closed for business.  She gets sufficient support - make it
last or hand the kids over.

peace out
deb.

------------------------

Do what is within reason..... actually.

In the end of the custodial parent cannot get their act together, WHY
should you help them?  Really - are you helping the kids?

It is very very different if the child misses the bus, and you take
them to school or if they are sick and you take them to the doctor
because the person just cannot break away - but it is totally
different to give someone extra funds because they overspent or under
budgeted.

But at the same time - a dicussion should be held about 'THEM' having
some type of backup in place for these emergencies.  That is the
responsibility that comes with custody. And in this I mean it should
not become a habit.

To me, I would of loved it if my ex just took my kids out to eat,
spent some time with them maybe flying kites, or going to a movie or
just being there to talk to them.  That is what both parents should be
doing actually.

well peace out - good luck

Holy cow.  That is exactly what I needed to hear.  Thank you - solutions,
experience, answers to why it didn't feel right in my gut.

So I go away on business one night and she calls her lawyer last week.

today...

This am she is 30 min late picking up kids and they each get to walk into
their class late and stressed out.  Her excuse - I overslept.

Each kid got a royal tickling tonight and we all danced and got hyper before
bed.  Very important for dad's to do : )

Peace!

You realize that this is the woman you chose to make children with and
make the best of it.  If she is destructive or dangerous, fight for
custody.  If not, make nice so you can see your kids.

-----------------

I understand your advice to 'make nice' but why should he?

Why should he do anything for the benefit of being a parent to the
kids?

Because trust me, just when you figure out where the line is, she will
move it.

It is your right to see the kids - and I think in this, 'she' should
need to adjust or you should go see your lawyer.

This is not about him or her and what they had and where it went, it
is now about him being a father - having a 'court given right' to see
his kids, and her having a 'court appointed responsibility' to those
kids...

We keep seeing how men have to adhere to one end of the stick - so why
should not the women that are the custodial parent? (and vica versa).

In a perfect world where people do what they *should* do, there
would be a lot fewer divorces and a lot fewer messed up kids.  Since
that isn't the case, someone always has to be the mature one - the
bigger person- for the benefit of their kids in the long run.  Playing
the &quot;why should I&quot; game is childish and is of benefit to no one.

Playing
the &quot;why should I&quot; game is childish and is of benefit to no one.

-----------------

But this is not the marriage, it is the divorce stage.  Lines have
been drawn, the woman and man have gone their separate ways, and the
children have been placed in the custody by order of the court.

This is not a 'why should I' as much as it is a 'okay, you did not
carefully budget your money - what does that have to do with me?'.  If
she cannot budget her money, and the kids are constantly hurting
because of it - why should the dad run to her rescue?  Instead he
should be asking what most should - if she cannot budget her money,
and cannot handle her relationship issues - and constantly needs her
ex to bail her out of trouble, they why does she have custody?  Why
should someone that has no vested interest in her life, help her out?

Because of the kids?  Sorry that does not wash - because the courts
gave her the responsibility of the kids - so she needs to ensure that
they are taken care of.  Period.  If she cannot, then - well, seems as
the other parent it better geared to.

------------------

If this was a case where the mom was not so needy - sure.  But it
seems as if she is using her ex to help her out of every little mess
she is getting herself into.

It really is not the same thing.  In his letter, she seems to be
leaning on him as if they were still married.... unable to hold it all
together.

To me, that says he needs to weigh each request she makes.. I think if
it was real emergency, sure - help her but that is not 'oopppsss.. I
overspent and need money to get groceries'.  Because thats when you
advise she go back, find her receipts and return every little trinket
she 'just had to have'.

Yes - that should work both ways.  I certainly feel self rightous because *I
can* take the kids most any day or night where she cannot.  In hindsight I
am seeing how the court order kinda caters to her*.  Man I was tired and
broke and just wanted it over....  But as it was said this woman is very
needy - very childlike in her reasoning or lack thereof.  I apprecaite the
feedback.  I am cautious.  The line gets moved and I'm waiting for this one
to get moved.  We are on a record for civility - but It get's creepy to me
and I feel it intrudes on everything I've done to move on with my life and
who I am as a single dad.  peace -

*she works the nights I have kids.  She is underemployed significantly.  3
years honors college 4.0 - 1 yr to finish.  Good work history.  She makes
11.50 hr.  There are single moms out there that would give anything for her
qualifications.  Kids are in before and after school care every day. So she
could get a 9-5'r and yes could make more than $22k in this job market.  But
why? She is subsidized by me and her parents.  And she hides it but I'd say
she's an alky.  I can't help but feel some of my future freedom and sanity
is dependant on her improving her earning capability and work hours.  But
each day I try to accept that she may never change.
