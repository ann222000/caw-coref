LW says that there is no one thing linking all games but I wanted to try one
idea out on this group that could be a link. Participants in game have a
particular attitude to that activity. So the linking thing about games is
this 'its just a game' attitude. Obviously it could be said that
professional players do not have this attitude, but I would argue then it is
more than a game. It is a professional sport of tournment of some kind, and
it is the money and status which they care about, and this is not 'just a
game' in this sense. Some people say 'life is just a game' and this is where
I got the clue for this idea. For them everything seems to them to be less
than serious. To most of us only certain activities have this feature and
some of these we call games.

LW meant "game" to be broader than sporting events.  Any human
activity where there are rules for how the participants respond to
each other or to external events is a "game".  The rules may be overt,
written down or verbally agreed to, or they may be "understood".

Yes, but this is a negative definition, i.e. one that is based on what
something is-not
(Games = not-serious). It's the same thing with "emotion", which is defined
as, e.g.
"not rational", but encompasses moods, affects, sensations, attitudes,
"emotions proper" (like anger, fear, joy etc.), temperament ....
A positive definition needs to be based on traits; and as far as I
understand LW, he wishes to point out that there is no shared trait that
justifies our defining "game" in a positive manner ("something is a game if
it has ..... X").

If a child bursts into tears on losing a chess game then the parent is
likely to say "it's just a game". The parent may have the "it's just a
game" attitude, but the child most certainly does not. For the child,
it may be just like failing an exam (which is not a game). So the same
attitude can be found in a game and non-game context, therefore an
attitude cannot define a game.

That criterion doesn't give us any descripton whatsoever of any feature of
any activity that is encompassed by the attitude "it's only a game".  The
criterion concerns something which is _outside_ the activity, not in itself
part of the activity, it is not-about-the-activity, hence it is
not-the-activity. It is strictly non-game in content. If you define
something by way of what it is not - delineating it by stating what is
outside the limit - you still have not said anything about what is inside
the limit. And then you have a negative definition. And then, accorrding to
what you write, anything could be a game if only the attitude is right. And
then we end, I think, with the dictum de omni et de nullo.

It's not that the attitude criterion isn't in itself a postive criterion -
it is clearly "something that is"; it's just not concerned with the content
of games, and so, when seen against the content of games, is a negative
definition of games.

All of the above could be in quotation marks - its not that I want to lay
down the Ultimate Definition; it is just my paraphrase of how I believe JW's
argument is to be understood - that games vary too much to be able to find
even one common trait.

D. Hofstadter writes on this in his "Metamagical Thematas", in the
chapter(s?) about "essence"(?), where he muses on some futile attemps to
define the necessary parts for making a typographical form of the letter
"A", or even the attempt to specify necessary parts of a table. Trees and
forest and all that.

To be honest LW's use of 'games' as a theme in the PI is more of an
analogy than it is a hammered-out logical argument; there's a lot of
that kind of reasoning in the PI and IMO it contributes to it being an
interesting mix of the continental and analytic styles of philosophy.

I suspect he would object to your point on the following grounds:

Not all participants in a game need share the same attitude towards
the game - this fact alone does not turn the game from a game into a
sport (or something else) - think of those Christmas family games
where one partipant takes the game too seriously. And then think about
that phrase "taking the game too seriously" - does taking the game too
seriously stop the game being a game? Does it do this always, or just
sometimes?

I'd also go re-read remarks §14 and the 2nd half of §3 bearing your
comments in mind. Do you notice any similarities between what you're
trying to do, and LW's interlocutor (i.e. himself).

No, but LW's point isn't:

All games have rules
Therefore
Any rule-bound activity is a game

(which as a piece of deduction, would be utter bollocks)

It's just a convenient way into considering the nature of rule-bound
behaviour in general, and a means of breaking the hold of the general
reductionist views predominant in analytical philosophy mid-20th
century (and judging by this thread, in philosophy in general).

For sure - one way we might distinguish between games and other
activities is that games are often played lightheartedly, but (and
this is the important bit) they /need not/ be so. It's that logical
necessity that LW obsesesses over in his later philosophy, probably
because philosophers tend to obsess over necessary and sufficient
conditions, i.e. those things which are definitive of thing /
category / activity / &lt;insert categorising noun&gt; X and those things
which will bring about thing / category / activity / &lt;insert
categorising noun&gt; X.

Well we might classify these things as games in some circumstances,
but ordinarily they would not be so classified.

Personally I wouldn't say that any rule-bound behaviour is a game; I
would say that games form a subcategory of rule-bound behaviours.

As usual, I put my foot in my mouth when I tried to summarize LW, who
does not summarize easily. Marriage can be a game, so can business,
even war, if the participants treat it that way. If an activity is
"rule bound", that is the participants treat the situation as if it
made sense to say "you're not playing fair!"; then there is a clear
sense that you can view the situation as a game.  This certainly
happens in marriage and, in some marriages, represents a great deal of
the interaction.  It certainly happens in business, bosses and workers
often have a very rule-bound set of interaction, sometimes so much so
that the rules are incorporated in company policy or Union rules,
although that is not necessary.  There is a sense by all parties that
there's a right and expected way to behave in the situation, the
"game".  Which does not mean that some participants don't cheat, just
like some participants cheat in the more formal games like football or
poker.  There's a sense in which cheating is a part of a larger game
of which the supposed game rules are a subset of the rules of the
larger game.  In fact, shifting the game to the larger (or just
different) scope is a game of it's own.

&gt;&gt; Catching a train has &quot;rules for how the participants respond to each
&gt;&gt; other or to external events.&quot; But it's not a game.

&gt;&gt; Fred is sitting around with friends and says &quot;Let's play Gissitich!,
&gt;&gt; the game with no rules!&quot; Sheila says, &quot;How do you play that?&quot; Fred
&gt;&gt; just sits there sipping beer and says nothing. Joe says, &quot;is that like
&gt;&gt; from Harry Potter, man&quot;. Fred says nothing. The questions continue.
&gt;&gt; Fred says nothing. Paul eventually says, &quot;I get it! Good game. Now
&gt;&gt; let's play something else....&quot;

&gt; No, but LW's point isn't:

&gt; All games have rules
&gt; Therefore
&gt; Any rule-bound activity is a game

&gt; (which as a piece of deduction, would be utter bollocks)

&gt; It's just a convenient way into considering the nature of rule-bound
&gt; behaviour in general, and a means of breaking the hold of the general
&gt; reductionist views predominant in analytical philosophy mid-20th
&gt; century (and judging by this thread, in philosophy in general).
">

Rules may be a common feature to all games (though I seem to remeber that
there may be examples of ones without rules like Paul has suggested) however
so is the fact that they are played by life-forms, that they take a certain
amout of time etc. However these things could be said about many activities
that are not games, as you yourself point out for the element of rules in
games. This means such features will not serve to differentiate games from
other activities that have rules, participants or take time. In other words
a feature is sought that all games and only games have in common and I am
proposing the attitude of the participants that this is JUST a game (not
shouting, just for emphasis on this word).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; LW says that there is no one thing linking all games but I wanted to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; try
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one idea out on this group that could be a link. Participants in game
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have a particular attitude to that activity. So the linking thing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; games is this 'its just a game' attitude. Obviously it could be said

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seems
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to them to be less than serious. To most of us only certain activities
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have this feature and some of these we call games.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, but this is a negative definition, i.e. one that is based on what
&gt;&gt; &gt; something is-not
&gt;&gt; &gt; (Games = not-serious). It's the same thing with &quot;emotion&quot;, which is
&gt;&gt; &gt; defined as, e.g.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;not rational&quot;, but encompasses moods, affects, sensations, attitudes,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;emotions proper&quot; (like anger, fear, joy etc.), temperament ....
&gt;&gt; &gt; A positive definition needs to be based on traits; and as far as I
&gt;&gt; &gt; understand LW, he wishes to point out that there is no shared trait
&gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt; justifies our defining &quot;game&quot; in a positive manner (&quot;something is a
&gt;&gt; &gt; game
&gt;&gt; &gt; if it has ..... X&quot;).

&gt;&gt; &gt; T

&gt;&gt; Well it is a positive definition in that it says that participants have a
&gt;&gt; particular attitude. I have descibed that attitude in negative terms but
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; is itself not a lack of something but a positive way of approaching an
&gt;&gt; activity.

&gt; For sure - one way we might distinguish between games and other
&gt; activities is that games are often played lightheartedly,
">

The attitude of its Just A Game is not necessarily lighthearted but it
distinguishes games from other activities. At least thats what I'm arguing.

&gt; If a child bursts into tears on losing a chess game then the parent is

&gt; game&quot; attitude, but the child most certainly does not. For the child,
&gt; it may be just like failing an exam (which is not a game). So the same

&gt; attitude cannot define a game.

I could say that the child is a bit like the professional chess player in
that more was at stake for them over and above the activity, and so it
wasn't Just A Game to them. Or to give another example someone, perhaps who
is dellusional, may beleive that the chess game they are playing represents
a real battle in another dimension, say. Again for them it is not Just A
Game because it is not a game, it has real consequences albeit in another
dimension.

To be honest LW's use of 'games' as a theme in the PI is more of an
analogy than it is a hammered-out logical argument; there's a lot of
that kind of reasoning in the PI and IMO it contributes to it being an
interesting mix of the continental and analytic styles of philosophy.

I suspect he would object to your point on the following grounds:

Not all participants in a game need share the same attitude towards
the game - this fact alone does not turn the game from a game into a
sport (or something else) - think of those Christmas family games
where one partipant takes the game too seriously. And then think about
that phrase "taking the game too seriously" - does taking the game too
seriously stop the game being a game? Does it do this always, or just
sometimes?

I'd have to say always, at least for that participant. I've noticed that it
can add to the fun for the others!

I'd also go re-read remarks §14 and the 2nd half of §3 bearing your
comments in mind. Do you notice any similarities between what you're
trying to do, and LW's interlocutor (i.e. himself).

Do I have to...my copy doesn't seem to be split into sections. I don't
suppose you have the 50th anniversary edition? The silver cover? And could
tell me the page numbers? Or just tell me what you mean?

&gt; It's an interesting book, although the Jungian overtones can get a

&gt; the game, though - I never noticed that we never find out anything
&gt; about them!

You're not supposed to notice, really. The grand old style
presentation
distracts from your caring about how the game is played, at least
until
you finish the book and reflect on it. Intellectual slight-of-hand!

As has been mentioned, LW used the world "game" in the
broadest, most abstract sense of the word. Whenever you
have a set of rules and goals, you have a game. Mathematics
is a game where you manipulate symbols. The goal is to do
it correctly or add something new to the game.

Your idea that one's attitude is the determining factor will work
with something like art: art is what is looked at as art. But a
game is always a game, even if you think it's not. You can't
escape it the same sense the nurse selling poppies in the
Beatles song can't escape: realizing you are in a play is just
another part of the play.

I believe the point was that the key to analyzing language was
to focus on how it was being used, not what it means.
Analyzing a proposition linguistically is like trying to figure out
why a $100 bill is worth more than a $1 bill based solely on
what the bills cost to produce.

This solved an enormous number of problems in philosophy,

The major problem with the above definition you offer is
activities like chess or poker are no longer games when played

By itself, additive identity just states a rule of algebra.

Honestly, though, if solving flashcards with basic
arithmetic on them do not constitute a game, then we
have completely different concepts of what a game

Symbol manipulation is a basic game concept. There
is no aspect of math or logic that has not been pursued

Recreation and games are clearly different concepts. Watching telly, yoga or
picking your nose are not games.

Also clearly maths can be part of a game. Sudoku, solitaire, maths
competitions, I'm sure there are others. I was just saying that mathematics
as a whole is not a game.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Catching a train has &quot;rules for how the participants respond to each

&gt; &gt;&gt; Fred is sitting around with friends and says &quot;Let's play Gissitich!,

&gt; &gt;&gt; just sits there sipping beer and says nothing. Joe says, &quot;is that like

&gt; &gt;&gt; Fred says nothing. Paul eventually says, &quot;I get it! Good game. Now
&gt; &gt;&gt; let's play something else....&quot;

&gt; &gt; No, but LW's point isn't:

&gt; &gt; All games have rules
&gt; &gt; Therefore
&gt; &gt; Any rule-bound activity is a game

&gt; &gt; (which as a piece of deduction, would be utter bollocks)

&gt; &gt; It's just a convenient way into considering the nature of rule-bound
&gt; &gt; behaviour in general, and a means of breaking the hold of the general
&gt; &gt; reductionist views predominant in analytical philosophy mid-20th
&gt; &gt; century (and judging by this thread, in philosophy in general).

&gt; Rules may be a common feature to all games (though I seem to remeber that
&gt; there may be examples of ones without rules like Paul has suggested)
">

cf remarks §66f and somewhere (I don't have a copy of the book to
hand) there's a remark about playing a game and making the rules up as
you go along.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; however so is the fact that they are played by life-forms, that they take a certain

&gt; games. This means such features will not serve to differentiate games from
&gt; other activities that have rules, participants or take time.
">

Indeed not, but it wasn't intention to provide a watertight definition
of the concept 'game' (I doubt one could do this anyway cf. remark §68
- "For how is the concept of a game bounded?" - well it's bounded by
us and our use of the word, thus unless one can make all users of the
word adopt exactly the same use the meaning will fluctuate regardless
of our efforts to make it sit still).

If I wanted to differentiate games from other rule-bound activities I
would have to use features of games which do not invoke a game's rules
- the element of skill, or that of chance, perhaps that of enjoyment
too.

No definition of a word serves for all circumstances!

I simply raised the point about rules because his point about games
and his points concerning rules are interrelated, language-games have
rules and the PI can be viewed as an extended working out of these two
ideas - games and rules.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; LW says that there is no one thing linking all games but I wanted to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; try
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one idea out on this group that could be a link. Participants in game
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have a particular attitude to that activity. So the linking thing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; games is this 'its just a game' attitude. Obviously it could be said
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; professional players do not have this attitude, but I would argue then
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is more than a game. It is a professional sport of tournment of some
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; kind, and it is the money and status which they care about, and this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not 'just a game' in this sense. Some people say 'life is just a game'
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and this is where I got the clue for this idea. For them everything
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seems
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to them to be less than serious. To most of us only certain activities
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have this feature and some of these we call games.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, but this is a negative definition, i.e. one that is based on what
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something is-not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (Games = not-serious). It's the same thing with &quot;emotion&quot;, which is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; defined as, e.g.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;not rational&quot;, but encompasses moods, affects, sensations, attitudes,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;emotions proper&quot; (like anger, fear, joy etc.), temperament ....
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A positive definition needs to be based on traits; and as far as I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understand LW, he wishes to point out that there is no shared trait
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; justifies our defining &quot;game&quot; in a positive manner (&quot;something is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; game
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if it has ..... X&quot;).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; T

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well it is a positive definition in that it says that participants have a
&gt; &gt;&gt; particular attitude. I have descibed that attitude in negative terms but
&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt; &gt;&gt; is itself not a lack of something but a positive way of approaching an
&gt; &gt;&gt; activity.

&gt; &gt; For sure - one way we might distinguish between games and other
&gt; &gt; activities is that games are often played lightheartedly,

&gt; The attitude of its Just A Game is not necessarily lighthearted but it
&gt; distinguishes games from other activities. At least thats what I'm arguing.
">

What if I approach non-games with the same attitude? Or will you adopt
the view that "My definition is correct thus this thing which is not
normally considered a game really is a game"? (This is the standard
philosophical reductionist's tack!). Do you consider ordinary usage or
ad-hoc (or even dictionary) definitions the determining factor?

LW's use of the word 'game' in the phrase 'language-game' is a
specialised use of the word 'game'. It doesn't indicate that he
subscribes to the view that everything is a game - what it's supposed
to bring home is the idea that language and life are interrelated -
learned activities and learned language are connected.

While one would probably want to say that mathematics has a great many
rules (although this in itself is an assertion which might require
explanation), this does not mean that on the whole mathematics is
categorised as a game.

&gt; I suspect he would object to your point on the following grounds:

&gt; Not all participants in a game need share the same attitude towards
&gt; the game - this fact alone does not turn the game from a game into a
&gt; sport (or something else) - think of those Christmas family games
&gt; where one partipant takes the game too seriously. And then think about
&gt; that phrase &quot;taking the game too seriously&quot; - does taking the game too
&gt; seriously stop the game being a game? Does it do this always, or just
&gt; sometimes?

rathbone/lwtocc.htm, although this only provides the first 80 remarks.

Anyway, the remarks are as follows:

"§3. It is as if someone were to say: "A game consists in moving
objects about on a surface according to certain rules..." --and we
replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are
others.  You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting
it to those games.

...

"§14.   Imagine someone's saying: "All tools serve to modify
something. Thus the hammer modifies the position of the nail, the saw
the shape of the board, and so on."---And what is modified by the
rule, the glue-pot, the nails?---"Our knowledge of thing's length, the
temperature of the glue, and the solidity
of the box."-----Would anything be gained by this assimilation of
expressions?---"

The current discussion resembles the latter half of §3 because you've
adopted precisely the viewpoint of LW's interlocutor (the person who
says "A game consists ...") because you've adopted the view that your
definition will accurately capture all uses of the word game.
Meanwhile others on this thread have tried to show, by providing
examples of games which don't fit your definition, that your view is
incorrect.

The discussion also resembles §14 for more-or-less the same reasons,
except that LW's comments in this remark are aimed at a more
philosophical version of the same view - that definitions are the
things which determine what words mean and that (if I might be allowed
a moment of parody) "all shall fall before them". Except that
redefining words never quite seems to solve philosophical issues -
people still insist on using words in ways that don't fit the
dictionary, or philosphical useage, or common usage, or whatever.

You could argue that there's an element of fun in all games, and all
this amounts to is saying that for you the element of fun defines the
idea of 'game'. Except that (a) you can have fun without necessarily
playing a game, and (b) some games are played seriously. Of course
your definition isn't necessarily incorrect, it's just that it's not
appropriate to all circumstances - there will be times when your
definition will serve merely to muddy already muddy waters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Absorbed as part of the social conditioning we all receive.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Read Herman Hesse's *The Glass Bead Game*. It's a magisterial tale of
&gt; &gt; &gt; intellectual gaming, even though the specifics of the actual games are
&gt; &gt; &gt; never
&gt; &gt; &gt; disclosed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; W : )

&gt; &gt; It's an interesting book, although the Jungian overtones can get a
&gt; &gt; little overwhelming at times. It's funny you mention the mechanics of
&gt; &gt; the game, though - I never noticed that we never find out anything
&gt; &gt; about them!

&gt; You're not supposed to notice, really. The grand old style
&gt; presentation
&gt; distracts from your caring about how the game is played, at least
&gt; until
&gt; you finish the book and reflect on it. Intellectual slight-of-hand!

&gt; W : )

Sleight of hand indeed!

The thing I remember noticing most was how transparently he plays the
metaphor between Playing The Game and Life.

Plus the ending's a complete downer.

But then all life ends in death so in that respect he's simply being
true to the issues he's choosing to explore.

Why not stick to what Wittgenstein was all about, language. Games have
in common that they can be called "games". This may be trivial.

On the other hand it is very logical that a basic sentence in language
is not something like "this is blue", because "blue" implies other
colors you can contrast with, and so the sentence is not basic enough. A
basic sentence would be somthing like "This is called blue". The process
of defining things by giving them a name, calling them something, is
what defines it to be basic.

"This is called a game", is a basic sentence, so the theory of
Wittgenstein 1 is not completely lost.

It is a question however if all other sentences can be deducted from
these kind of sentences. I think you will have to give a closer look to
the meaning of the word "validity".

Validity in sentences depends on the process of using certain words,
f.i. "game".

There seem to be a great many usages for the word "game".  Some of the
posts here appear to be about the conflict between different usages.

One usage, invented by Dr Berne in the book "Games People Play" has
infuenced our perception of what a game can be.  According to Dr.
Berne, games are ritualistic transactions or behavior patterns between
individuals that can indicate hidden feelings or emotions.  Here we
can discuss games like the flirting game or the ritualized bickering
between husbands and wives.

To define "game" rigorously would require a definition that included
all the common usages. The on-line dictionary lists 10 discrete
meaning, I suspect there are more.

Well if LW's right about "for a large class of words, though not
necessarily for all - the meaning of a word is its use", then - seeing
as there are an infinite number of uses to which one may put a word -
there are an infinite number of definitions one might supply for the
meaning of that word.

LW's Tractatus Logico Philosophicum (TLP) deals with logical atoms of
language. In LW's Philosophische Untersuchungen(PU) he shows that
logical atoms of language may not be possible because of the many
meanings of words like "game". He also refutes his former theory.

jusholm now tried to find a description for a word like "game" that
would again make the idea of logical atoms of language possible.

My answer was to have the process of calling something as logical atom
for language. LW refers to this action in PU. So the logical atom of
language is the process of "calling" something (using concepts). Like in
"This is called a game." You will not need all meanings of the word
game. Just the specific setting will do to make this sentence valid.

As you might know in the TLP LW invented the truth-value tables. These
deal with validity. A logical atom of language like "This is called a
game" will be just the right proposition to apply truth-value tables on.
You nee not know about other games, so the sente4nce is independent and
can act as logical atom.

The problem LW had was finding the logical atoms. He didn't think about
the "call"-process. He thought about sentences like "This is blue".
These sentences couldn't function as logical atoms, because when you
wanted to apply truth-value tables you needed contrasting colors to find
out if the sentence was true or not. If something depends on something
else, it can't be called logical atom.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Fred says nothing. Paul eventually says, &quot;I get it! Good game. Now
&gt; &gt;&gt; let's play something else....&quot;

&gt; &gt; No, but LW's point isn't:

&gt; &gt; All games have rules
&gt; &gt; Therefore
&gt; &gt; Any rule-bound activity is a game

&gt; &gt; (which as a piece of deduction, would be utter bollocks)

&gt; &gt; It's just a convenient way into considering the nature of rule-bound
&gt; &gt; behaviour in general, and a means of breaking the hold of the general
&gt; &gt; reductionist views predominant in analytical philosophy mid-20th
&gt; &gt; century (and judging by this thread, in philosophy in general).

&gt; Rules may be a common feature to all games (though I seem to remeber that
&gt; there may be examples of ones without rules like Paul has suggested)

cf remarks §66f and somewhere (I don't have a copy of the book to

&gt; games. This means such features will not serve to differentiate games from

Indeed not, but it wasn't intention to provide a watertight definition
of the concept 'game' (I doubt one could do this anyway cf. remark §68
- "For how is the concept of a game bounded?" - well it's bounded by
us and our use of the word, thus unless one can make all users of the
word adopt exactly the same use the meaning will fluctuate regardless
of our efforts to make it sit still).

If I wanted to differentiate games from other rule-bound activities I
would have to use features of games which do not invoke a game's rules
- the element of skill, or that of chance, perhaps that of enjoyment
too.

No definition of a word serves for all circumstances!

I simply raised the point about rules because his point about games
and his points concerning rules are interrelated, language-games have
rules and the PI can be viewed as an extended working out of these two
ideas - games and rules.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; For sure - one way we might distinguish between games and other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; activities is that games are often played lightheartedly,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The attitude of its Just A Game is not necessarily lighthearted but it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; distinguishes games from other activities. At least thats what I'm
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; arguing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; As has been mentioned, LW used the world &quot;game&quot; in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; broadest, most abstract sense of the word. Whenever you
&gt;&gt; &gt; have a set of rules and goals, you have a game. Mathematics
&gt;&gt; &gt; is a game where you manipulate symbols. The goal is to do
&gt;&gt; &gt; it correctly or add something new to the game.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Your idea that one's attitude is the determining factor will work
&gt;&gt; &gt; with something like art: art is what is looked at as art. But a
&gt;&gt; &gt; game is always a game, even if you think it's not. You can't
&gt;&gt; &gt; escape it the same sense the nurse selling poppies in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Beatles song can't escape: realizing you are in a play is just
&gt;&gt; &gt; another part of the play.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe the point was that the key to analyzing language was
&gt;&gt; &gt; to focus on how it was being used, not what it means.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Analyzing a proposition linguistically is like trying to figure out
&gt;&gt; &gt; why a $100 bill is worth more than a $1 bill based solely on
&gt;&gt; &gt; what the bills cost to produce.

&gt;&gt; All of mathematics does not come under the category of game. For example
&gt;&gt; 0+1=1. That was no game and yet is the basis of the whole thing.

&gt; LW's use of the word 'game' in the phrase 'language-game' is a
&gt; specialised use of the word 'game'. It doesn't indicate that he
&gt; subscribes to the view that everything is a game - what it's supposed
&gt; to bring home is the idea that language and life are interrelated -
&gt; learned activities and learned language are connected.

&gt; While one would probably want to say that mathematics has a great many
&gt; rules (although this in itself is an assertion which might require
&gt; explanation), this does not mean that on the whole mathematics is
&gt; categorised as a game.
">

Exactly the pont I was trying to make. When I am discussing games and
Wittgenstein I am just discussing that there is a feature shared by all
games and only games which LW says there is not. Nothing to do with
language-games.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is more than a game. It is a professional sport of tournment of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; some
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; kind, and it is the money and status which they care about, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not 'just a game' in this sense. Some people say 'life is just a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; game'
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and this is where I got the clue for this idea. For them everything
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seems
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to them to be less than serious. To most of us only certain
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; activities
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have this feature and some of these we call games.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, but this is a negative definition, i.e. one that is based on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something is-not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (Games = not-serious). It's the same thing with &quot;emotion&quot;, which is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; defined as, e.g.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;not rational&quot;, but encompasses moods, affects, sensations,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; attitudes,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;emotions proper&quot; (like anger, fear, joy etc.), temperament ....
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A positive definition needs to be based on traits; and as far as I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understand LW, he wishes to point out that there is no shared trait
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; justifies our defining &quot;game&quot; in a positive manner (&quot;something is a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; game
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if it has ..... X&quot;).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; T

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Well it is a positive definition in that it says that participants
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; particular attitude. I have descibed that attitude in negative terms
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is itself not a lack of something but a positive way of approaching an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; activity.

&gt;&gt; &gt; For sure - one way we might distinguish between games and other
&gt;&gt; &gt; activities is that games are often played lightheartedly,

&gt;&gt; The attitude of its Just A Game is not necessarily lighthearted but it
&gt;&gt; distinguishes games from other activities. At least thats what I'm
&gt;&gt; arguing.

&gt; What if I approach non-games with the same attitude? Or will you adopt
&gt; the view that &quot;My definition is correct thus this thing which is not
&gt; normally considered a game really is a game&quot;?
">

That's exactly what I have said in other posts. That it is the internal
attitude that defines whether an activity is a game or not.

&gt; To be honest LW's use of 'games' as a theme in the PI is more of an

&gt; that kind of reasoning in the PI and IMO it contributes to it being an
&gt; interesting mix of the continental and analytic styles of philosophy.

&gt; I suspect he would object to your point on the following grounds:

&gt; Not all participants in a game need share the same attitude towards
&gt; the game - this fact alone does not turn the game from a game into a
&gt; sport (or something else) - think of those Christmas family games
&gt; where one partipant takes the game too seriously. And then think about
&gt; that phrase &quot;taking the game too seriously&quot; - does taking the game too
&gt; seriously stop the game being a game? Does it do this always, or just
&gt; sometimes?

&gt; I'd have to say always, at least for that participant. I've noticed that
&gt; it
&gt; can add to the fun for the others!

&gt; trying to do, and LW's interlocutor (i.e. himself).
&gt; Do I have to...my copy doesn't seem to be split into sections. I don't
&gt; suppose you have the 50th anniversary edition? The silver cover? And could
&gt; tell me the page numbers? Or just tell me what you mean?
">

*LOL*

No, you don't /have/ to! I just thought you might find it enjoyable.
If you're stuck for an online reference try http://users.rcn.com/
rathbone/lwtocc.htm, although this only provides the first 80 remarks.

Anyway, the remarks are as follows:

"§3. It is as if someone were to say: "A game consists in moving
objects about on a surface according to certain rules..." --and we
replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are
others.  You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting
it to those games.

...

"§14.   Imagine someone's saying: "All tools serve to modify
something. Thus the hammer modifies the position of the nail, the saw
the shape of the board, and so on."---And what is modified by the
rule, the glue-pot, the nails?---"Our knowledge of thing's length, the
temperature of the glue, and the solidity
of the box."-----Would anything be gained by this assimilation of
expressions?---"

The current discussion resembles the latter half of §3 because you've
adopted precisely the viewpoint of LW's interlocutor (the person who
says "A game consists ...") because you've adopted the view that your
definition will accurately capture all uses of the word game.
Meanwhile others on this thread have tried to show, by providing
examples of games which don't fit your definition, that your view is
incorrect.

The discussion also resembles §14 for more-or-less the same reasons,
except that LW's comments in this remark are aimed at a more
philosophical version of the same view - that definitions are the
things which determine what words mean and that (if I might be allowed
a moment of parody) "all shall fall before them". Except that
redefining words never quite seems to solve philosophical issues -
people still insist on using words in ways that don't fit the
dictionary, or philosphical useage, or common usage, or whatever.

You could argue that there's an element of fun in all games, and all
this amounts to is saying that for you the element of fun defines the
idea of 'game'. Except that (a) you can have fun without necessarily
playing a game, and (b) some games are played seriously. Of course
your definition isn't necessarily incorrect, it's just that it's not
appropriate to all circumstances - there will be times when your
definition will serve merely to muddy already muddy waters.

Thank you. However I haven't seen a convincing argument as yet that I
haven't found a feature that all games and only games have.

There seem to be a great many usages for the word "game".  Some of the
posts here appear to be about the conflict between different usages.

One usage, invented by Dr Berne in the book "Games People Play" has
infuenced our perception of what a game can be.  According to Dr.
Berne, games are ritualistic transactions or behavior patterns between
individuals that can indicate hidden feelings or emotions.  Here we
can discuss games like the flirting game or the ritualized bickering
between husbands and wives.

To define "game" rigorously would require a definition that included
all the common usages. The on-line dictionary lists 10 discrete
meaning, I suspect there are more.

I would say the word 'game' in such context (or language-games) is being
used in quite an unusual way. It is almost emphasising the fact that these
things are not games, just like 'war-games', or 'deadly game'.

Well if LW's right about "for a large class of words, though not
necessarily for all - the meaning of a word is its use", then - seeing
as there are an infinite number of uses to which one may put a word -
there are an infinite number of definitions one might supply for the
meaning of that word.

I suppose that is the bigger question.

&gt; LW's Tractatus Logico Philosophicum (TLP) deals with logical atoms of
&gt; language. In LW's Philosophische Untersuchungen(PU) he shows that logical
&gt; atoms of language may not be possible because of the many meanings of
&gt; words like &quot;game&quot;. He also refutes his former theory.

&gt; jusholm now tried to find a description for a word like &quot;game&quot; that would
&gt; again make the idea of logical atoms of language possible.

&gt; My answer was to have the process of calling something as logical atom for
&gt; language. LW refers to this action in PU. So the logical atom of language
&gt; is the process of &quot;calling&quot; something (using concepts). Like in &quot;This is
&gt; called a game.&quot; You will not need all meanings of the word game. Just the
&gt; specific setting will do to make this sentence valid.

&gt; As you might know in the TLP LW invented the truth-value tables. These
&gt; deal with validity. A logical atom of language like &quot;This is called a
&gt; game&quot; will be just the right proposition to apply truth-value tables on.
&gt; You nee not know about other games, so the sente4nce is independent and
&gt; can act as logical atom.

&gt; The problem LW had was finding the logical atoms. He didn't think about
&gt; the &quot;call&quot;-process. He thought about sentences like &quot;This is blue&quot;. These
&gt; sentences couldn't function as logical atoms, because when you wanted to
&gt; apply truth-value tables you needed contrasting colors to find out if the
&gt; sentence was true or not. If something depends on something else, it can't
&gt; be called logical atom.
">

I think you must be going beyond the fairly minor point I was trying to
investigate, just whether there is a common feature of all games and only
games.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LW meant &quot;game&quot; to be broader than sporting events.  Any human

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each other or to external events is a &quot;game&quot;.  The rules may be overt,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; written down or verbally agreed to, or they may be &quot;understood&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Absorbed as part of the social conditioning we all receive.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Read Herman Hesse's *The Glass Bead Game*. It's a magisterial tale of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intellectual gaming, even though the specifics of the actual games are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disclosed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W : )

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's an interesting book, although the Jungian overtones can get a
&gt; &gt; &gt; little overwhelming at times. It's funny you mention the mechanics of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the game, though - I never noticed that we never find out anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; about them!

&gt; &gt; You're not supposed to notice, really. The grand old style
&gt; &gt; presentation
&gt; &gt; distracts from your caring about how the game is played, at least
&gt; &gt; until
&gt; &gt; you finish the book and reflect on it. Intellectual slight-of-hand!

&gt; Sleight of hand indeed!

&gt; The thing I remember noticing most was how transparently he plays the
&gt; metaphor between Playing The Game and Life.

&gt; Plus the ending's a complete downer.

&gt; But then all life ends in death so in that respect he's simply being
&gt; true to the issues he's choosing to explore.

Who was it who said philosophy is just a way of learning to die?
*scratches head*

Jorge Luis Borges is a Latin American writer who tackled similar
issues, but he
never wrote novels; his style was as concise as HH's was expansive. If
you like
Hesse, you'll like Borges too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; LW says that there is no one thing linking all games but I wanted to try
&gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; idea out on this group that could be a link. Participants in game have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; particular attitude to that activity. So the linking thing about games
&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; this 'its just a game' attitude. Obviously it could be said that
&gt; &gt; &gt; professional players do not have this attitude, but I would argue then
&gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; more than a game. It is a professional sport of tournment of some kind,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is the money and status which they care about, and this is not 'just
&gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; game' in this sense. Some people say 'life is just a game' and this is
&gt; &gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt; &gt; I got the clue for this idea. For them everything seems to them to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; less
&gt; &gt; &gt; than serious. To most of us only certain activities have this feature
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; some of these we call games.

&gt; &gt; To be honest LW's use of 'games' as a theme in the PI is more of an
&gt; &gt; analogy than it is a hammered-out logical argument; there's a lot of
&gt; &gt; that kind of reasoning in the PI and IMO it contributes to it being an
&gt; &gt; interesting mix of the continental and analytic styles of philosophy.

&gt; &gt; I suspect he would object to your point on the following grounds:

&gt; &gt; Not all participants in a game need share the same attitude towards
&gt; &gt; the game - this fact alone does not turn the game from a game into a
&gt; &gt; sport (or something else) - think of those Christmas family games
&gt; &gt; where one partipant takes the game too seriously. And then think about
&gt; &gt; that phrase &quot;taking the game too seriously&quot; - does taking the game too
&gt; &gt; seriously stop the game being a game? Does it do this always, or just
&gt; &gt; sometimes?

&gt; &gt; I'd have to say always, at least for that participant. I've noticed that
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; can add to the fun for the others!

&gt; If you take chess seriously does it stops being chess?

&gt; &gt; I'd also go re-read remarks §14 and the 2nd half of §3 bearing your
&gt; &gt; comments in mind. Do you notice any similarities between what you're
&gt; &gt; trying to do, and LW's interlocutor (i.e. himself).
&gt; &gt; Do I have to...my copy doesn't seem to be split into sections. I don't
&gt; &gt; suppose you have the 50th anniversary edition? The silver cover? And could
&gt; &gt; tell me the page numbers? Or just tell me what you mean?

&gt; *LOL*

&gt; No, you don't /have/ to! I just thought you might find it enjoyable.
&gt; If you're stuck for an online reference try http://users.rcn.com/
&gt; rathbone/lwtocc.htm, although this only provides the first 80 remarks.

&gt; Anyway, the remarks are as follows:

&gt; &quot;§3. It is as if someone were to say: &quot;A game consists in moving
&gt; objects about on a surface according to certain rules...&quot; --and we
&gt; replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are
&gt; others.  You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting
&gt; it to those games.

&gt; ...

&gt; &quot;§14.   Imagine someone's saying: &quot;All tools serve to modify
&gt; something. Thus the hammer modifies the position of the nail, the saw
&gt; the shape of the board, and so on.&quot;---And what is modified by the
&gt; rule, the glue-pot, the nails?---&quot;Our knowledge of thing's length, the
&gt; temperature of the glue, and the solidity
&gt; of the box.&quot;-----Would anything be gained by this assimilation of
&gt; expressions?---&quot;

&gt; The current discussion resembles the latter half of §3 because you've
&gt; adopted precisely the viewpoint of LW's interlocutor (the person who
&gt; says &quot;A game consists ...&quot;) because you've adopted the view that your
&gt; definition will accurately capture all uses of the word game.
&gt; Meanwhile others on this thread have tried to show, by providing
&gt; examples of games which don't fit your definition, that your view is
&gt; incorrect.

&gt; The discussion also resembles §14 for more-or-less the same reasons,
&gt; except that LW's comments in this remark are aimed at a more
&gt; philosophical version of the same view - that definitions are the
&gt; things which determine what words mean and that (if I might be allowed
&gt; a moment of parody) &quot;all shall fall before them&quot;. Except that
&gt; redefining words never quite seems to solve philosophical issues -
&gt; people still insist on using words in ways that don't fit the
&gt; dictionary, or philosphical useage, or common usage, or whatever.

&gt; You could argue that there's an element of fun in all games, and all
&gt; this amounts to is saying that for you the element of fun defines the
&gt; idea of 'game'. Except that (a) you can have fun without necessarily
&gt; playing a game, and (b) some games are played seriously. Of course
&gt; your definition isn't necessarily incorrect, it's just that it's not
&gt; appropriate to all circumstances - there will be times when your
&gt; definition will serve merely to muddy already muddy waters.

&gt; Thank you. However I haven't seen a convincing argument as yet that I
&gt; haven't found a feature that all games and only games have.- Hide quoted text -

I believe that the common feature of games is the entertainment
implicit in  competing (win or lose) to achieve a specific objective
within the confines of specific rules.
It is not a game if rules ensure that all participents achieve the
objective. Any  entertainment then  derived is from the activity
itself and not from the achievement.
Life is not a game. There are no specific rules. Irrelevant to the
moves made by life's players,  ruleless catastrophies strike and
destroy  no matter who has the advantage.

Life *itself* is not a game; however, we partake of so many situations
which
involve gaming, be it LW's type or whatever, that life takes on the
aura of a
game. Glass beads, of course, are optional.
