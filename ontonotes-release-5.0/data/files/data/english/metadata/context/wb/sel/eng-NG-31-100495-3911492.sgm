...so anyway. Today was a bank holiday in the UK - a bright and sunny one
in Hampshire, at that. We took the 308 out. Picnic in the New Forest.
Very pleasant. Saw a 348 and a 308GT4... I think they're cool (yes, yes,
yes, I know).

Other cars spotted out on the road (total journey approx 100 miles):
(and BTW, this is a typical  list for a sunny English bank holiday)

MGB (chrome bumpers)
MG Midget
Austin Healey 3000
Triumph TR5
Ancient Bentley - possibly a Speed 6 (it was a fair way off)
AC Cobra (although admitedly too far away to see if it was genuine)
Fiat X19
Maserati Bora (OK, that one was in a garage, not actually on the road)
Ferrari 308GT4
Ferrari 348ts

(also god knows how many modern 911s, but who cares?)

In the past couple weeks I've spotted a couple 348s, one an older
red tb and the other a newer black ts. From some angles I like the
348, but others look very dated, and not in a "classic" way.

I like the 308GT4 too, but then I can understand why most people
(myself included) prefer the more flowing curves of Pininfarina over
the blocky edginess of Bertone. Still, I bet they're a fun drive what
with the webers behind your head and all. Shame it's so hard to find
a good one anymore.

As for the Bora, I'm still in love with that car (front engined), especially
in black. The creases and the taut lines just do it for me. That and the
growl of the exhaust note. The later mid-engined car was cool, but I'll
take the 60's model first.

There's my $.02...

Rubbing it in now, are you?

I was rather surprised at how many really nice, high end cars there
were laying about in England while we were there. Easily twice as many
as you would see in a typical trip to New York City, Los Angeles or
Paris. It was fun spotting the obscure ones. On the flip side, we did
see one London Taxi the last time we were in Las Vegas.

We probably should have got our backsides to AutoItalia at Brooklands
yesterday - then you'd have seen a positively huge collection of mouth
watering automobilia. As it turned out I couldn't have made it there anyway
owing to necessary visit to the Osteopath (see below) and a Ferrari with no
wheels on!! Oh, and  it was Mrs M's B'day so I'd actually ruled it out some
months ago!

However, I too was out &amp; about in my red car today - though only doing "test
laps" locally having finally got it down of the jack stands. I took it upon
myself to replace all the flexible brake hoses, clean up the calipers &amp;
change the brake fluid. Not that difficult &amp; no major snags except for them
initially sending me hoses for a non ABS 328 (which are shorter for the rear
brakes). I also got around to cleaning up the wheels properly inside &amp; out
which I've been meaning to do for like 3 years. Large amounts of Dinol
underbody sealant on the inside of the rims from when it was treated just
before I bought the car. Seems they were a bit careless with where it went!

Job got interupted for a few days owing to me having a very stiff neck
thanks to some moron running straight into the back of my VW on Thursday
when I was sat stationary waiting for oncoming traffic before turning off
the road into my own driveway!! Fortunatly a lightweight Peugeot thing -
destroyed the front end of it &amp; serves him right! He probably hit me at
somewhere around 15-20mph - another 5mph &amp; a bit heavier car &amp; it could have
been v. nasty. Poor Mr VW has about £2500 worth of dented backside -
fortunately matey was actually insured. I am now currently sporting a very
fine 1 litre Nissan Micra (in Rosso bleedin' Corsa!) as everyday transport!

Other than that, spent the day doing odd jobs round my car just sorting a
few things out I've been meaning to fix for ages. Cleaned the leather &amp; gave
it a good wash. I'm sure it feels better - went like the clappers on its
"drying out" run afterwards. Oh and my sqeaky brakes that no-one else has
been able to fix are gone :-)

Not a bad weekend all in!

I.

I went to AutoItalia at Brooklands a few years ago and loved it. Its a an
Italian car fans heaven! Met a great guy who had brought his Dino 246 to
show which was quite 'weathered' shall we say and had quite a few scratches
and dings on it. Most people seemed to wonder why he wasn't ashamed to show
it but it was great to see an 'earnest' Ferrari! He'd had the car from new
and used it as his daily driver for over twenty years, hence its condition.
He said he'd once driven it to Maranello on a 'pilgrimage' and had parked it
near the Cavallino restaurant. Enzo himself was on his way to lunch, saw it
and was intrigued by it! Apparently he had a beaming smile on his face and
congratulated him on driving one of his cars the way they should be, like a
Romany whore!

True for Paris. We do not see that many Ferraris here, except for that
silly experience I had a couple of weeks ago: I went for a ride in the
F355 with a friend who had been asking for it for long. As it was the
first time she sat in a Ferrari, she asked, at the end of the journey,
to drive up and down the Champs Elysées (our most famous and crowded
avenue), just for the show.

Just as we entered the avenue - and as my friend prepared to enjoy
showing off-, another F355 did the same thing, and we drove down the
whole Champs Elysees side by side.

The disappointment of my friend about being stolen the show made my day
;-)

The *real* frightening thing is the place at the end ('round the Arc de
Triomphe). After 20 years of driving in Paris, I still feel a little
anxious before entering it.

to remedy that by next year.
