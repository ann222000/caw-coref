Below are the top 50 cities that Sporting News named in it's top 500
sports towns in the US. The link to the other 450 is at the end of the
list&gt; Buffalo ranks 34th. Toronto edged the Queen city out at 27th. I
think that might be debatable, did the Jays fans boost them over Buffalo.

Anyway, 34 out of 500 ain't too shabby. FWIW, and quite predicable
judging from the participants in this group,..... Rochester, NY did not
make it in the top 500.

1. Detroit + Ann Arbor
2. New York
3. Dallas-Fort Worth
4. Chicago + Evanston
5. Los Angeles
6. Boston
7. Denver + Boulder
8. Phoenix + Tempe

there are some questions in this list:

Los Angeles and Anaheim are not areas that have supported their teams like
other cities.

Gainesville is a simple a one college team that was only football till
several years ago.

Atlanta - the braves can not give away tickets to reach a full house unless
the red sox or yankees are in town.

Indianapolis - a joke!

in fact this list is a joke - how can NYC, Boston, Chicago not be 1 - 3 is
some order!

I can vouch for that. None of the teams draw that consistently.

The Hawks are one of the most pathetic franchises. They haven't made the
playoffs since 1999 and since then have a combined record of 218-438. They
have never gotten past the second round of the playoffs since moving from
St. Louis.

The Falcons have a franchise record of (get this) 252-366-6. In 41 years,
they have had a grand total of 14 playoff games and have won six of those.
They have a winning record against only six other franchises, Buffalo among
them.

Forget about the Thrashers. They have sucked every year except this last one
and look what happened to them in the playoffs.

Atlanta does have the Yellowjackets though and they are usually pretty good
in hoops and baseball and generally hold their own in football. I don't
think UGA qualifies as an Atlanta team - Athens is about 100 miles away -
although most natives are Bulldog fans first, then Nascar.

Only the Braves have had any regular success. 15 straight division titles
may be a record that will stand forever in major league sports in North
America. The Braves generally draw between 2.5 and 3.5 million per season
and have been over the league average nearly every season since 1990.

Are you sure these are supposed to be &quot;top 500 sports towns in the
US&quot;?
Did Canada become the 51st state when I wasn't looking?

UGA - You are correct. I checked the link, and Athens, GA is listed down
in the 80's.

I tip my hat to Georgia Tech. As you pointed out, they usually are
competitive in the sports you listed. Not too shabby for a bunch
&quot;geeks&quot; and &quot;nerds&quot;. My only &quot;beef&quot; with GT is they seem to struggle to
beat UGA in their football rivalry. GT needs to kick the living shit out
of UGA every chance they get.

That's a good question.
In the Top 150, the following 3 cities are listed:

Niagara Falls, NY
Chattanooga, TN
Troy, AL.

Maybe if your alma mater competed in &quot;real&quot; sports, such as Rodeo, like
Troy University (AL) does, maybe we would see Troy, NY listed.

The problem is, your alma mater is not red neck enough. :)

So tell us Jack...where does your negative fixation on Rochester come from?
One can only assume it is envy based on the fact that there are so many
people living in Rochester that actually know something about digital
photography. Since your abilities are so minimal...you could always ask
someone there to help mentor and teach you something.
