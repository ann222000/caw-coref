I watched this last night. I'm going to have to watch it again. It was
so hard to follow
midway through and then really sped up at the end, I lost track of who
is the good guy and who was the bad....So many of them were killed I
couldn't tell

CHEECH,

COME on, CHEECH, give us a rating, five stars being the best, did you
hate it. WAS it too much action/adventure not enough plot, character
development and/or romance. ANY humor to it. I got a feeling you would
only give it three stars.

gee....a second round of reviews....didn't anyone see this? besides
Les, that is...
The lines separating good and evil are obliterated in this Scorcese
pic starring Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, A. Baldwin and Martin
Sheen....an astonishing kaleidoscope of violence and treachery in the
Boston Area with Nicholson as a Mob Bigshot and DiCaprio and Damon as
police officers....lots of head shots...a reliance on cell phone
technology...very much a man's gore flick...

some great music in the 'score'...
during the end credits...a song called "Sweet Dreams" played by the
late, great, Roy Buchanan...whom I once saw perform this piece at a
venue IN Boston...bitter sweet...

Nicholson and DiCaprio are really good in their parts...Damon's not
bad....all in all...the actors MAKE this watchable...the story line is
rather cliche...IMHO...

Les....as for humor....perhaps a bit, here and there....dark
humor...sick dark humor....what do you expect from Jack playing a
gangsta....?
3* on the performances.....only....the story is a bit
convoluted...just like 'real life'...in the informer/police
business....the moral of the story is "it doesn't matter who's holding
the gun pointed at you"....i.e. 'good' guy or 'bad' guy....it's still
a gun pointed at you....and I think it DOES....the cop's more likely
to kill ya....he's got 'the law' on his side....

I was the first in our group to buy a VHS at a ridiculous price. My
first rents were Raging Bull, Elephant Man and Dumbo for my young
children.//The unchartered ground between good and evil...Yes, it can
be unclear. One may have to trace to Intention- the roots. And sensing
the heart- cold or warm.// As immigrants plunged into America, there
was a often an understanding between both sides of the Law. They
mingled, in a strange way- but that was years ago.//

NEWBROOM,

IF that is the moral of the film it's one i never thought of, cops are
more likely to kill than criminals because they have the law behind
them, very important point. IT sure deals with the recent NYC cops' "54
shots" at an unarmed accused human being who they found out later was an
innocent bystander. SOMEHOW he survived.

RIGS,

SORRY, RIGS, but i'm a simpleton, i'm slow, could you restate you last
post. ARE you saying, no nation should hold a gun or especially the most
powerful gun to avoid what. A nuclear war. BUT wasn't it the main reason
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. didn't go to war because both had the big gun.

&gt; SORRY, RIGS, but i'm a simpleton, i'm slow, could you restate your last
&gt; post. ARE you saying, no nation should hold a gun or especially the most
&gt; powerful gun to avoid what. A nuclear war. BUT wasn't it the main reason
&gt; the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. didn't go to war because both had the big gun.

The big problem, when you are the last one on the top, is, there is
only one way left to go.

What is amazing to me is, there are a lot of people in the US that
can't wait for us to sink to the level
of third world countries.

Well, I'm not on that list but I am very critical of certain policies.
But I also have empathy for third world nations. My heart sides with
underdogs even when they lose. I try to walk in their shoes. I wish
life was equitable but it is not. All the monies that have been spent
on wars and conquests throughout human history- just think of it-
could have been spent on equal distribution of necessities. And the
stuff. All is vanity, afterall.//The Top Dog mentality...why not raise
your fellow humans UP.

CHEECH,

DOn't you realize we can't control even a very close tiny nation and
neighbor we attacked and conquered militarily just a few years ago,
HATTI, politically. THEY had a democratic election and voted in a
dictator. AND NOREGA in NICARAGUA might be elected president soon. IF we
go into another country to break up a fight like in RWANDA, that's fine
but not to change governments.

Les, countries like Haiti are hopeless. Left alone they would
overgraze the place and nature would reduce the population to a
sustainable level.

We could control it by leaving it alone.

Rowanda is another mess that can't be fixed for the same reason Iraq
is such a mess and that reason is  tribalism.
Until we get it through our heads that the reason we have done so well
here in the US is because we are no longer living in tribes and
understand that nothing we can do will stop thousands of years of
tribal warfare, all we will be doing is putting a temporary stop to
the fighting.

CHEECH,

I'm sure you agree if IRAQ started to invade ITALY then the U.S.
citizenry wouldn't hesitate to defend ITALY ( though i don't like
ITALIANS:O), too macho) but we shouldn't go into IRAQ after ITALY is
freed from IRAQI's tyranny. COULD you image IRAQ invading and conquering
ITALY then moving into FRANCE to conquer that country too and the U.S.
doing nothing, of course not. FOR BUSH to invade IRAQ was pure
stupidity. THE reason again why BUSH is stupid is because he believes in
fear. HE thought if the U.S. scared the terrorists they would go away
but it's done the opposite. THE guy is a moron! LOOK at SPAIN since
their bombing of the train, they didn't attack IRAN or IRAQ and no more
bombings in SPAIN. ALL we have to do is just imagine how life today
would be if we didn't invade IRAQ, simple stuff and the answer is
self-evident. YET BUSH can't figure this out, he must be among yes
men/women. YOU can't work for BUSH and disagree with him. HE's an out
and out IDIOT and DUMBASS:O)say it ain't so. CHEECH, i want you to take
up BUSH's side on the invasion of IRAQ, you can't do it can you, it's
too embarrassing isn't it.

Bullshit Les, We went into Iraq, not because of weapons of Mass
Destruction, but because we needed a foot hold in the area. Also we
didn't need Saddam Hussein stirring up shit with his neighbors.

We got bogged down in the middle of a religious tribal war and the
only way out is to kill off all of them and you know that isn't going
to happen.

Spain might as well be run by US democrats, no need to say more.

France is a goner, Iraq didn't invade it, Morroco and North Africa
did. They are screwed.

Rigs, do you think James Dean may have suffered from depression, among
other things?

I loved him in "Rebel Without a Cause", "East of Eden", "Giant".
Depression? I think that's a recent umbrella. We had boundaries and
social conventions that were cast out by the 70's. In a way, they
protected us.They gave us structure. We certainly knew things but
carried on.

RIGS,

YOU sure placed an idea in my head, who is today's JAMES DEAN, JOHNNY
DEPP. WHO would be labeled as today's rebel. WOULD today's rebel be a
conservative actor. WHAT is there to rebel against. IS there an ultra
ultra LIBERAL actor out there, how about GEOFFREY RUSH, no he's too old.
I think today's films are the best that were ever made and getting
better. IT's getting harder to find a bad film.

http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/geoffrey_rush...

LAST night saw CATE BLANCHETT, who i don't particularly care for, in a
film on the satellite dish titled, "BANDITS", she was really funny,
crack me up to no end:o))))))), Billy Bob Thornton and BRUCE WILLIS were
modern day bank robbers, Billy Bob needed a car real fast, so he
carjacks CATE's, "GET OUT OF THE CAR, RIGHT NOW!!" shouts Billy Bob
pointing a gun in her face, "I'm not getting out of this car.", "SAY
WHAT!!!", "I AM NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS CAR!!", Billy Bob, "WELL,
will you please move over."....."NO!!!!!"....."GOD DAMN IT LADY!!!!", so
Billy Bob runs around the front of the car and she opens the passenger
side door for him, he gets in, she speeds off driving. "LADY WHAT IS
YOUR PROBLEM!!!"...."ARE you a bank robber.".....Billy Bob places the
nozzle of the gun up her nose, "LADY, ARE YOU TRYING TO BE FUNNY."
IT was really funny stuff but only saw half the film. GREAT complex plot
and script. HE ends up taking her to the hideout and of course WILLIS is
wondering why he brought her and who the hell is she, he ends up falling
in love with her.............it was obvious CATE relished this role.
DIRECTED by Barry Levinson. WON 3 GOLDEN GLOBES.

That being sad is not the same as clinical depression. I haven't
watched Dean in anything for decades but I recall sensing this modern
melancholy in the roles I noted. But Nicholson is great in conveying
brutal mockery- a jaundiced view of life and relationships. Has he
played a sympathetic male?

Of course he has....at LEAST one...gawrsh...I can't recall the
title....but...he loses his job to age discrimination...then tries to
deal with his time..and his new life...then his wife dies...his
daughter rejects his attempts to connect...(I don't have time to
google this right now....sorry)...but, in this role Jack does play a
schlubb discovering life anew and w/o the signature scathing
sarcasm...he is quite adept at playing a sympathetic (emphasis
pathetic) character...

Sounds like "About Schmidt" with Kathy Bates. I didn't see it but I

RIGS,

GOOD question, RIGS, yes, one of his last films, forgot the
name.........here we go
http://imdb.com/title/tt0237572/

"THE PLEDGE",

he just retired as a detective, a woman friend wanted him to take a
case, he did while he was retired from the force. HE had a solid case,
called the cops, they came, staged a setup, it backfired. HAD to do with
a pedophile abusing little girls. THE pedophile was very smart saw it
was a trap long before the cops knew he knew. I did not give the ending
away:o), rigs. VERY good film.

THE ending will be stated from here on for those who don't care.

JACK's character even though correct about this case, the cops never
believed him, thought he was crackers, senile, JACK got depressed,
talked to himself constantly, sad ending, ended up alone with no one
willing to be his friend again. VERY good film, 8 and half stars out of
ten. WHY not ten, the other actors' acting gets a "B" rating and it
happened a lot. A better cast would have blown the socks off of a ten
rating.

I see you beat me to it, as you know i do the endings of films, from
here on i'll place the endings way below the rest of the review with
blank space inbetween and give the ratings on top.  I realize most don't
think this way but i like to know the ending so when i watch the whole
movie with the knowledge of the ending one can focus more on the rest of
the film.

Les- Do you also read the last page of book first? Neighbors gave me a
statue of a girl when I moved from a former home with a note, "Life is
a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solved." So is a book or a

RIGS,

RIGS, are you telling us when you have a problem you try not to solve
it. YOU must never have a dull life surrounded by problems. OR are you
saying you never have problems, if you never have problems how do you
learn. YOU learn about problems and that's how you prevent them.

WHEN it comes to reading the ending first, yes i love a mystery, fact is
when i see a film and i don't understand it that's the one i like best.
ESPECIALLY when it's very complex, it looks logical but i don't get it.
I like thrillers. ONE of my favorites and i mostly don't like the old
ones is NORTH BY NORHTWEST. THE film confused me the first time i saw it
and that's when  i enjoyed it the most.

THE way i look at it when i do the ending is the reader has plenty of
time to look away because each scene is being described unless s/he
reads the last three paragraphs first. ALSO if i read the ending and
then watch the film i'm spending less time trying to figure out who
killed whom, more time with the scenery, the expressions on the actors
face, see more of the plot. MOST people when they see the film twice get
more out of it, but i do love a mystery. COULD watch a film either way
and still be enriched. SINCE the greatest thriller i ever watched was
the one i couldn't figure out that tells me i prefer not knowing the
ending. SAW it around 20 years ago, don't even remember who was in it or
what it was about. I like to think there are people out there who read
the reviews knowing they will never see these films. WHO are shut-ins
and can't afford NETFLIX and can dream what the film would be like. BUT
you gave me the idea of placing the star rating system on the top of the
review. TIME to eat lunch take a nap for a half hour and watch the
ending of CHEECH's film, THE NEW WORLD, then do the review. IT's such an
epic film, with many different angles and subjects to deal with i can't
do a scene by scene description, it would take too many words, it will
be done in general terms. SEEN the first hour, already have in mind
exactly what i'm going to say, it's a very good film w/four major flaws
believe it or not. IT has a lot of positives, monster positives.
