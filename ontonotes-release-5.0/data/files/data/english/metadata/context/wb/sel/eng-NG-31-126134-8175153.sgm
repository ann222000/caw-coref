I've seen the &quot;Dr. Dre&quot; refill floating around the net.

I don't believe there is such a thing nor do I believe Dre uses
Reason.

I think someone came up with an approximation of what they thought
were Dre-type synths in Reason and now everyone thingks they are
actual &quot;Dre sounds&quot;

I've never heard of Primo using Reason either, do have any evidence of
any of these producers actually using Reason?

I read it somewhere that Primo still only uses an SP1200 and an MPC.
But that's probably just a preference thing.

Yes i know that they don't use reason but there are many wannabe producers
(like myself) that sample their drums, kicks, hats and stuff and pack it
into something that sounds as something these producers would use if they
would produce in reason (but they don't of course). It isn't dre's soundbank
infact but something soundalike. However... these packs are floating around
and i'm interested in gettin those soundbanks (for free of course) so if any
one knows a forum or maye a link i would be really thankful.

I believe he uses the MPC as his master sequencer, not for sampling.
The MPC triggers samples from his Akai S950

I got some &quot;dre sounds&quot; that I *think* is a Reason refill. Â I never
really peeped them out, but I will look if I still have it burned on
disc and send it up to you if I find it.
