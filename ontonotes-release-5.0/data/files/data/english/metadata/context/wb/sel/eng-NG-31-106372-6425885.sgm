I've been told that treaties constitute the highest level of American law.
Is this true?

Assuming it to be true, suppose that a US president were to enter into a
treaty with multiple foreign nations to form one large, combined country.
The goal being to create a large US based supernation (like the EU).

Would the US electorate have any recourse against such a treaty?  Would such
a treaty require ratification of Congress?

It depends.  Many parts of treaties are subject to multiple
interpretations and, as always, everything is a matter of
facts and circumstances.  Tax treaties, in particular, are
up for grabs all the time.

Isn't that what NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement)

Kick, scream, yell, swear, and write to their U.S. Senator

If it does not get a 2/3rds approval of the U.S. Senate it
is not a treaty.  Which is why NAFTA is NOT a treaty.  It
is simply an executive agreement and both Canada and Mexico
keep trying to get it enforced.

I'm not sure what "highest level" means here. The US is not famous for
honoring it's treaty agreements, so probably not. Pres. Jackson's
administration was sued in the Supreme Court for not honoring a treaty with
some indians. The indians won, Jackson ignored the court.

The executive branch negotiates treaties. The treaties then must be
ratified by Congress. This is part of the checks and balances system.
Since there is no court that really has the armies necessary to enforce
such treaties, the electorate can repudiate a treaty by electing people who
won't honor the treaty.
And this happens. So the US is not regarded as a country that can be
trusted to honor it's word.

Good luck,

*Any* treaty requires ratification by the Senate (not by Congress).

The recourse by the electorate would be to elect a new executive who
would denounce the treaty, that is formally give notice of US
withdrawal. What would happen if the treaty did not allow for
withdrawal is an interesting question.

Or it *would* be an interesting question if there were any
possibility of the situation arising The possibility of the President
negotiating, and the Senate ratifying, such a treaty in the first
place is about the same as the possibility of you going up Niagara
Falls in a barrel.

The US Constitution at Article VI Section 2 states that "the laws of
the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all
Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law of the land..."

The Constitution at Article II Section 2 states that "He [the
President] shall have Power, by and with the the Advice and Consent of
the Senate to make Treaties, provided that two thirds of the Senators
present concur..."

The Constitution at Article V states that " The Congress, whenever two
thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose
Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the
Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a
Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either case, shall be
valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this constitution..." To
date, there has not been a constitutional convention in the US since
1787, and all amendments have been the result of the congress
proposing them and the states ratifying them.

The question that you present, in essence, is what happened
historically with the United States after the Revolutionary War was
over in 1781 and before the present Constitution was adopted in 1789.
Each of the former colonies -- Virginia, Maryland, New York, etc. --
was a separate country with separate money, customs duties, weights
and measures, etc. and organized in a loose confederation of states
with a weak "national" government. The system proved unworkable and a
constitutional convention was called to tweak the system. The result
was the adoption of the present constitution.

Many of the questions that you ask were debated in the 1780's in the
United States with parties for and against the present constitution.
The fears were the same (of a strong central government crushing the
rights of the states). Ultimately our founders adopted the model that
we have today. Other instances in US history which parallel your
question occurred when the US made the Louisiana Purchase, the War
with Mexico, the purchase of Alaska and the Annexation of Hawaii, each
of which involved the use of treaties to add territory that was either
purchased or conquered from a foreign power. The people of the United
States embraced these moves through the actions of Congress.

There are many good resources on this period of US history which may
be useful -- google "Articles of Confederation", "US Constitution
history", "US Constitution". The book "The Federalist Papers" is also
a good resource.

Good Luck.

Not just "such a treaty" and, instead, all treaties (that are that)
are subject for their effectiveness to an affirmative vote agreeing to
and implementing them of two thirds of the U.S. senate:

" [The president] shall have Power, by and

The answers to this question depend on whether the question uses the
word "electorate" as if a synonym merely/solely for (in effect if not
in these exact words) "persons eligible to and/but acting only by a
vote" as distinguished from voters and would-be voters in general (the
"electorate"?) acting in what might be a variety of political
organizing and speech related and other political ways (e.g., "Lets
vote the S.O.B.s out if they agree to this!" radio call-in talk show
campaigns and political rallies, etc.), also on whether (as has of
course occurred in U.S. history) the electorate will have persuaded a
substantial number of senators to use the senate's constitutionally
granted "advice and consent" prerogative to persuade the president not
to negotiate the treaty in question in the first instance or, at
least, not to approve it by the required two-thirds vote if the
president negotiates and provisionally agrees to the treaty in
question anyway, and, in any event, what one would regard as
"recourse" in other ways (e.g., the electorate influencing congress to
use its power of the purse as a means not to fund activities otherwise
required by a treaty).

There are numerous examples in the history of the United States
including comparatively recently in which, presumably in response to
perceived electorate opposition, the U.S. senate convinced a president
not to try to enter into a contemplated treaty and also refused to
vote to approve a treaty after having been presidentially negotiated.

The poster is of course correct that, as a significant matter of U.S.
constitutional history, the reference to Reid v. Covert (and, for that
matter, Reid's progeny) ought not be overlooked.  But this ought not
prevent the analytically minded from also recalling that, as a matter
of basic logic, the quoted excerpt from Reid is a classic example of
circular question begging:  The U.S. constitution's  Art. VI, which
expresses that constitution's "all Treaties made, or which shall be
made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
Law of the Land" requirement, is of course itself a key part of that
instrument and, as such, it also contains its own qualification
addressed exactly to what might be otherwise claimed to be "restraints
of the Constitution" found elsewhere in that instrument - i.e., that
otherwise validly entered into and U.S. senate voted treaties are to
be "supreme" in law "anything in the Constitution or laws of any State
to the contrary notwithstanding."

I though NAFTA was a treaty and had been ratified. I see after Dick
Adams' comment and a little googling of my own that I was wrong.

Instead it seems to have been an executive agreement implemented by
Federal law. This takes a majority vote in both houses, rather than a
two-thirds vote in the Senate. Since the Senate vote was 61-38, it
seems likely that a ratification vote would have failed to get the
required two thirds.

(Does anyone know how to find out from a US Government Web site which
treaties have been ratified and which have not? I tried
thomas.loc.gov and state.gov without success.)

Not relevant to the OP's question, but there's a fascinating
discussion on the Canadian government Web site of the Canadian
ratification process and its implication for the division of power
between the federal government and the provinces.

This article is a limitation on the rights of the *States*.  It provides
that no State may repudiate a treaty entered into by the federal
government.  It is not intended to imply any hierarchy of federal
legislation.

The right of the *people* to approve or reject federal treaty agreements
is elsewhere explicitly invested in the Senate.

As for judicial revue, though the Supreme Court has never ruled an
entire treaty unconstitutional, most scholars accept that it would have
the same power over treaties that it exercises over statutes -- that the
two are equal in that regard.

In what case was the United States sued?  In _Worcester v. Georgia_
the Supreme Court overturned the state convictions of several people
for living in Indian country without a state permit.  President Jackson
famously noted that Chief Justice Marshall would have a harder time
enforcing the decision -- against the state of Georgia -- than making
it.  The Wikipedia page on the case claims, with citation, that Jackson's
actual statement was "The decision of the supreme court has fell still
born, and they find that they cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its
mandate."

The 19th century Indian cases are probably obscure to foreigners
and of negligible concern to 21st century negotiators.  A more
famous treaty that was made in the lifetime of some people still
living established the League of Nations.  President Wilson was
the driving force behind the League but the Senate repudiated
his agreement.

Not sure if you're using it in the following sense but..........

When did "congress" become synonymous with "house of representatives"
and congressman=representative? That's always bugged me when folks use
the word in that way. A congressman can be either a senator OR a
representative and the two groups (Senate and House of Representatives)
become, collectively, "The Congress."

Now you may have been meaning it in the correct sense (in that only the
Senate ratifies treaties and not both sections) so don't take the above

The US was not a party to that treaty, because the Senate refused to
ratify it.  The Constitution specifies that the Senate has that
power.

This is not the same as "repudiating" a treaty, which would be the
international equivalent of "anticipatory breach of contract," where
you announce that you will no longer abide by the terms of a treaty
you have agreed to in the past.  The US had not "agreed to" the LoN
