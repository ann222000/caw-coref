Cultivation can't purge all accumulated habits,
social and genetic. It can help rework some of
them to alleviate suffering, but some will remain.
There are habits of, e. g., fear and anger that are
hard to clean out completely. However what
matters is how one responds to them, if they
arise (that some will arise is unavoidable). If,
once they arise, one quickly becomes aware of
them and responds appropriately to them to
lessen or nullify the suffering caused by them,
they can't do much harm, and one has the chance
to observe them (oneself) and learn from such
occurrences; in light of such learning they may
or may not arise again, and if they still arise they
will be less virulent and cause less suffering and
one knows how to deal with them quicker and
better. On the other hand, if they arise and one
refuses to acknowledge them, even more to deal
with them, then they continue to arise and cause
suffering, as if no cultivation occurred.

Buddhism comes down to being honest and
getting real. If the compositions (such as fear
and anger) arise, they arise, and if they cease,
they cease. One shows one's mettle by dealing
with them. One is thrown into some situation or
another, internal or external, from birth to death,
inclusively, and that part is involuntary. How one
deals with it is voluntary, and that is where
cultivation is worth it and earns its keep.

If you track the suffering caused by the judgements of anger and fear
you can find what is really causal here and it is not the anger and
the fear, it is precisely judgements of emotions and emotional
reactions.

Emotions are taken as reactions to what is outside.  They are not
called bad, but the judgement is there anyway.  So we shift from what
seems to be judging what is outside - reacting sometimes with fear and
anger - and turn a judgement inward.  Oh that must be nullified and
reduced, controlled and disidentified with, not allowed expression.  A
dualism, or a double standard forms where what is outside must be
accepted adn what is inside can and is rejected - emotions in general,
urge and desires, but especially sexual urges and especially the so
called negative emotions.  These are seen as bad.  Often when this is
brought up the adherent of eastern religions says that these things
are not bad.  But if you feel the dynamic effects of the adherents
reactions to these emotions and urges in themselves adn in others, you
can feel that they damn well do think they are bad.

and where do these emotions go now judged to be bad, not having had
acceptance, but actually getting a good smack in the face?
They do not simply disappear.  Like injured and damaged children some
leave home and become victims, some leave and become perpetrators.

In cultivation one calms further and further, cleans up
further and further, assumes (takes up) further and
further and cleans up further and further what one
assumes. The repressed, alienated stuff (the swamp
stuff) will emerge, and it is assumed (taken up),
responsibility is taken for it, and it gets cleaned up and
pacified accordingly. When unacknowledged and even
repressed it festers, multiplies and gets obscenely active,
but when acknowledged and accepted it gets deactivated
and disarmed. Detachment and equanimity, levity,
humour and irony have a nice way of dealing with it and
putting it out of action. Even when it is not completely
put out of action, it is put in its place, with balance and
perspective, and there it cannot run rampant and out of
control.

The repressed, alienated stuff often is portrayed
horizontally, as some layer that gets pushed down by
consciousness, but it can operate also vertically, by
breaking the mind into parts that float independently of
each other and that serially grab control, one after the
other, with only one part in control at any one time, the
balance being pushed out of consciousness. This situation
comes from the repressed, alienated stuff taking revenge,
and it takes revenge by assuming (taking up) the tactic
used to repress it and merely pushing it further and further.
It merely plays Judo on its owner, in flipping him with his
own method, but in exacerbated, magnified, stultified
form. If one lives in bad faith with oneself, if one fools
oneself into believing that one is other than who one is and
what one does, one in effect represses who one is and what
one does and substitutes a false facade to make oneself
happy. The repressed, alienated stuff will assume (take up)
such a tactic and pushes it further, in that it will fortify and
ramify that self-blocking and self-partitioning, so that in
effect it breaks one into parts that float independently of
each other and that serially grab control, one after the
other, with only one part in control at any one time, the
balance being pushed out of consciousness. One wants to
not know oneself as one is but wants to know oneself as
one is not, and the repressed, alienated stuff takes revenge
by simply pushing such a tactic further and further, and by
breaking one up into serial slices that don't know each other
and that grab control serially, one at a time, so that when
one slice gets control, it doesn't know the other slices and
is in effect shielded from (the knowledge of) the other
slices. One thus is in effect shielded from (the knowledge
of) oneself.

but don't you see how you've divided this 'one' that
you speak of into fragmented partitions and then hold
common to its own exclusivity an engendered one-ness?
there is no 'one' to begin with.  a process with many fragmented
auspices deals in moment to moment convenience as to the
juicing enjoyments of that narcissistic core of the ego and
in any given specific patterning in the light of attempts to
satisfy security and survival addictions, the only true love
being the love of survival, there is an appearance of a 'one'
since each 'one' that arises moment after moment seems
to be similar to a previous 'one' and lack of clarity and
discernment packages these 'ones' as being the same
'one' over and over with slightly dissimilar encroaching
desires and wants. if that 'one' were the same one for even
a few seconds, desires would never sway from their base
formulations. the only true 'one' is the modulating vibratility
from that narcissistic core of the ego which seeks survival,
security and protection but veils it as many other desire factors.
during these veilings it is supposed that there is a central 'one'
that arises when they are actually countless and contiguous
and morphing to factors of survival and veiling that survival
addiction by means of other seemingly necessary desires.
