After a day at the water park the family and I stopped at a all you can eat
buffet place. I like this particular one because they have a good selection
of low/no carb dishes including deserts. I picked a cheese cake that I
normally dont have trouble with and when I got home and checked my BG it hit
170, this wa about an hour after eating, two hours later it was 95. Im glad
I responded so well to the carb load but also learned a lesson, these desers
can be mislabeled and I will only eat them at home from now on where I know
for sure what they are..

Thinking it over though the dessert may have been OK the numbers may have
been a result of dehydratin and they may have gone down because I drank
about 4 big glasses of water after getting home. Still eating desserts out
can be hazardous.

Being what I thought was a controlled type 2, I started allowing myself to
slip and have the odd dessert while out.

I started having higher numbers as well.

I am one that doesn't drink enough water but this summer but found my ankles
started swelling and had to be put on a water pill.

So, now I'm trying to find water to be a friend. I've cut down on the coffee
I was drinking and am drinking less Coke Zero.

My last A1C was apparently 6.1 which I don't consider to be terrible but the
doc called me in to talk about my blood work.

I have the appointment on the 27th, which I'm anticipating with bated
breath!

The only thing I seem to struggle with these days is &quot;dawn phenomenon&quot;.
Finding fasting numbers to range as high as nearly 9.5.

I know that a snack in the evening is supposed to alleviate that but I eat a
later dinner and go to bed early not really needing more food at that time.
So, I don't know the solution to that really.

Exercise would help too I suppose but as this is all new to me and I was
never one to exercise, I've not gotten into that routine yet.

about getting out more for walks but never seem to find time.

The exercise is really the big thing. It doesnt really take that much, a 30
minute wak will do wonders. Then as you get stronger do more. I started out
with my 30 minute walk winding me now my wife daughter and I climb a 600 ft
mountain twice a week. I try to walk with most of my meals, usally cant do
it with breakfast.

You dont find time you make it . The exercise is realy important so move it
to its proper priority.

it. Â You learned something so besides being delicious it was a good
lesson.

are you sure you took the sugar free one.

One lesson I learned while living in the desert southwest for 30 years -
if you're thirsty, drink. If you're really thisty, you waited too long. I
always keep my water intake up - even if it doesn't seem necessary - most
folks take in too little water. I've observed many older folks in a state
of perpetual dehydration - a diabetic can't afford that.

On several occassions I have enjoyed a dessert while out - usually one
small spoon or fork full from another person's portion - I'd never eat a
whole one.

Jimmie -
I feel for you, but I have a hard time seeing how there could be
such a thing as a &quot;no carb cheesecake&quot; or how dehydration could double
your bg.

I can tell you, I do enjoy the &quot;sugar-free&quot; Jello pudding (something
that they might make a low-carb cheesecake out of) but it is by no
means zero carb. Factor in the milk (lactose) and the crust (even
cardboard is a carbohydrate!) and the lowest-carb version I can
imagine would send my bg's into the 200's unless I account for it with
more insulin shots.

Incidentally, a slice of regular cheesecake has sent me into the
400's and 500's before.

My partner makes an incredible low carb cheesecake with an almond crust and
Splenda. It's also low fat, basically, I believe. Yummy. Better than the

Not no-carb, but low-carb is easy. Â Cheesecake is mostly cream cheese
after all, which is a perfectly good low-carb food. Â And you can make
the crust out of ground nuts and butter.

It'll still have a bazillion calories cause cream cheese and nuts are
very high fat foods, but it can be very low-carb.

Portion was pretty small, and it was the one that had the &quot;sugar free&quot; sign.
Dont know how you got the idea I was festering. Like I said in the origonal

being dehydrated.

After thinking about it I dont really think it was the dessert, I really
think it was a dehydration problem. The whole family seems to be suffering
from it today. Its something really easy to happen at a water park,
esspically one that only has water fountains at the main entrance and
charges $2.00 for a can of soda.

You can get free water(6oz cup) at the concession stands if you stand in
line for a half hour.

Yeah, cheese cake is mostly fat and added sugar. Take out the added sugar
and they are peetty low carb. You can even make them crustless.
What carb is left is pretty well moderated by all the fat.. Believe me after
spending a day at the water park I could use the fat.

I agree about the too much sugar, the regular cheese cake kind of leaves a
burning feeling in my throat. Since getting myself weened from sugar I am
finding I dont really likeit that much except in CHOCOLATE.

My recipe uses low fat cream cheese and cottage cheese whipped to a sour
cram texture in the food processor and some whle and some egg whites to
make a lower fat cake. Â it uses splenda in place of the sugar and is
flavored with lemon zestm lemon juice and some lemon yogurt. Â the crust is
ground walnuts with some Splenda andno butter or other fat as the walnuts
contain sufficient oil. Â It is delicious and tstes remarkably like the
real thing but is lower in fat, lower in carbs and lower in calories than
regular cheesecake. Â Not much additional protein in grmas, just in
proportions of a smaller caloric base.

I am not willing to retype my whole recipe and relly don't know if I I can
cut and aste to a newsgroup. Â If I can, let me know and I will try to do
it.

I think you could google it as I have submitted it before and to other
groups. Â It is a lower fat, lower carb luscious lemon cheesecake.

Sounds great. Lemon yoghurt sounds an inspired addition to what's a

It is the overeating (eating until stomach stretched thereby killing
the hunger) that is hazardous:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From this cite:

&quot;...the most important way to deal with it is to lose weight.&quot;

Comment:

The most important way to deal with type-2 diabetes is to lose the bad
&quot;inside&quot; fat (visceral adipose tissue or VAT) because this very
possibly could lead to curing type-2 diabetes.

If your waist-to-hip ratio is greater than 0.75 (female) or 0.85
(male) then you have VAT to lose.

It is only when we are hungry (stomachs laughing and singing) that our
bodies get rid of the VAT, which is the source of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines that are hurting us by causing systemic inflammation
throughout the body resulting in insulin resistance (IR/MetS),
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and arthritis.

I used to make a full fat and sugar cheese cake with no crust.
I served it on a layer of lady fingers soaked in Grand Mariner and topped it
with rasberry jam or rasberry puree.
My wife took one to a Girl Scout leaders meeting last year and I understand
it was enjoyed by all.

She has a leaders meeting next week, maybe I will make one Â to take

Hey Wendy,

I actually did google for it and found many posts all the way back to
2004 talking about how yummy and delicious it sounds, but no receipe
yet.....I had to stop looking because I haven't eaten and all the talk
of cheese cake was making my mouth water. Â It sounds wonderful. Â I
would just experiment myself, but I'm a lousy cook and need guidance,
LOL. Â I will look again another day and maybe try over on the alt.food

Nicky,
thanks for getting that url. Â I can find the recipe but don't know how to
forward the url (or even find it on the website).

I am going to try it th enext time with a different baking technique I
learded form the TV program America's Test Kitchen. Â Instead of the water
bath, which ofen results in wet feet for the cake, they recommend strting
init in a 500F oven for the first 10 minutes and then, WTIHOUT OPENING THE
DOOR, reduce the temperature to 200F for the next 1-1 1/2 hours until a
thermometer reads 150 in the center (I usually guage it by fir outer adn
jiggly center. Â  Remove from oven a, runparing knife around the edge and
let cool for 2-2 1/2 hours and refrigerate for 3 hours beoer trying to
remove it from the pan. Â This is a good cake to make the day before you
want to use it:-)

She found the URL again, where she originally found a recipe she wanted to
begin with. Then, she wrote it up as a recipe, including the changes she
makes. She didn't include directions for the almond crust she makes, saying
anyone could use any nut crust of their choosing.

(based on recipe here
http://www.lowcarbluxury.com/recipes/recipe-cheesecake11.html )

* Â 4 Â 8-ounce packages cream cheese (I use 2 low fat &amp; 2 fat free), at room temperature
* 1 2/3 cups Splenda
* 1 Tablespoon cornstarch
* 1 Tablespoon sugarfree pure vanilla extract
* 2 extra-large eggs
* Low fat sour cream mixed with milk to equal 3/4 cup (maybe 3/4 sour cream to 1/4 milk)

Place one 8-ounce package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the Splenda, and
the cornstarch in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low until
creamy, about 3 minutes, then beat in the remaining 3 packages of cream
cheese.

Increase the mixer speed to high and beat in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of the
Splenda, then beat in the vanilla and the heavy cream. Blend in the eggs,
one at a time, beating the batter well after adding each one. At this point,
mix the filling only until completely blended. Be careful not to over-mix
the batter.

Gently spoon the cheese filling into springform pan and place in a large
shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the sides of the
pan. Bake the cheesecake until the center barely jiggles when you shake the
pan, about 1 hour in a 350 degree oven.

Cool the cake on a wire rack for 1 hour. Then cover the cake with plastic
wrap and refrigerate until it's completely cold, at least 4 hours or
overnight. Remove the sides of the springform pan. Slide the cake off the
bottom of the pan onto a serving plate. Or if you wish, simply leave the
cake on the removable bottom of the pan and place it on a serving plate. If
any cake is left over, cover it with plastic wrap and store in the
refrigerator.

&gt; Donna, many thanks and pass along my thanks to your partner. Â The
&gt; recipe sounds delicious. Â I&quot;m planning on a birthday cake for a
&gt; combined partay for 3 Virgos in my life, all cheesecake lovers, and
&gt; will be making 3 cakes altogether, and this will be one.

You're very welcome &amp; I will tell her. It is delicious. And, even people who
don't intentionally eat low or lower carb agree! It's good without the
crust, too, but I am one who likes contrasting tastes so the almond nut
crust provides that. Meanwhile, hey, can we come? I'm an Aquarian &amp; she's a
Leo but my mother was a Virgo!! &lt;G&gt;

LOL
