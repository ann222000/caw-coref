July 27, 1956 - A B-47 crashed into a storage igloo containing three Mark 6
nuclear bombs at RAF Lakenheath, exploding and spreading burning fuel over the
bombs. A bomb disposal expert stated it was a miracle exposed detonators on one
bomb did not fire, which presumably would have released nuclear material into

February 5, 1958 - see the Tybee bomb. A B-47 carrying a Mark 15 Mod 0 nuclear
bomb on a simulated combat mission from Homestead Air Force Base collided with
an F-86 Sabre. The F-86's pilot ejected and parachuted to safety. The B-47 tried
landing at Hunter Air Force Base three times before the decision was made to
jettison the bomb at 7200 ft into the Atlantic Ocean near Savannah and Tybee
Island, Georgia. A 3 square mile area near Wassaw Sound was searched for 9 weeks
before the search was called off. The bomb was searched for in 2001 and not
found. A new group in 2004 claims to have found an underwater object which it
thinks is the bomb.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sources: B - 52 Mistakenly Carried Nukes
&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
&gt;&gt;&gt; Filed at 10:13 a.m. ET

&gt;&gt;&gt; BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A B-52 bomber was mistakenly loaded with five
&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear warheads during a flight from North Dakota to Louisiana, a
&gt;&gt;&gt; newspaper reported Wednesday.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ===================

&gt;&gt; WOw Nukes on a B 52 !!!? HOw Shocking !   Libmaggots were hoping the
&gt;&gt; nUkes were loaded on a   Russian Mig and dropped on the US .

&gt; I think the point is that the military was lax enough to let nukes go
&gt; where they were not supposd to be. If they can be incorrectly put on
&gt; B-52's, then perhaps they could be &quot;diverted&quot; to other locales as
&gt; well.
">

January 24, 1961 - A B-52 bomber suffered a fire caused by a major leak in a
wing fuel cell and exploded in midair 12 miles (20 km) north of Seymour Johnson
Air Force Base, Goldsboro, North Carolina. The incident released the bomber's
two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs. Five crewmen parachuted to safety, but three
died-two in the aircraft and one on landing. Three of the four arming devices on
one of the bombs activated, causing it to carry out many of the steps needed to
arm itself, such as the charging of the firing capacitors and, critically, the
deployment of a 100 foot (30 m) diameter retardation parachute. The other bomb
plunged into a muddy field at around 700 miles per hour (300 m/s) and
disintegrated. Its tail was discovered about 20 feet (7 m) down and much of the
bomb recovered, including the tritium bottle and the plutonium. However,
excavation was abandoned because of uncontrollable flooding by ground water, and
most of the thermonuclear stage, containing uranium, was left in situ. It was
estimated to lie at around 180 feet (55 m). The Air Force purchased the land and
fenced it off to prevent its disturbance, and it is tested regularly for
contamination, although none has so far been found

">

Nuclear weapons are designed not to explode or rupture unless intended.  The
plane could have hit a mountain at full cruise speed, and
the bombs would not go off.  The plane could burn itself into nothing, and
the bombs would not detonate.  The &quot;detonators&quot; are small charges
designed to drive an internal mechanism into position so that a sequence of
timed electrical charges can initiate compression of the nuclear
material.  If the detonators explode without the bomb being sequenced,
nothing at all happens....no nuclear material is exposed.  The casing of the
nuclear material can withstand anything short of....are you ready....a
nuclear detonation.  These devices travel by rail, by road and by air, and
are built
to survive the worst crash imaginable.

The nuclear material cannot be released unless the containment is breached,
and that is very near impossible to do.  Generally, the containment is
only breached when the payload is detonated.

All the bullshit and paranoia about these bombs going off in a crash are
completely unfounded.

The missile could literally be dropped into an active volcano and it would
not detonate...it cannot detonate unless a precise, complicated and exact
sequence of events occur.  Those events would not occur even if it fell into
a volcano.

You may ask how I know such things...I was with the 522nd Combat Support at
Grand Forks, ND.  We flew the B-52s during the cold war, and yes we
flew some of them armed with nuclear weapons.  Those were the cold war
years...when LRBs were kept in the air 24/7, waiting for a &quot;go order&quot; to
deliver
their payloads.

A B52 carrying non-nuclear munitions is a far greater threat flying over
populated airspace than any plane carrying nuclear weapons.

The nuclear weapons will survive the crash without releasing any radiation,
whereas the standard munitions would detonate on impact or
during the subsequent fire.

Norm, let us not fall to the same level of name calling here. The Dems are a
bit confused these days. They want to condemn Craig since he was an (R) but
are beholden to the homosexual lobby, thier primitive processors are locked
in an illogic loop. Note some of the anti-gun, anti-consercative folks have
been referring to right wing cocksukers, fags, etc. hardly seems very
&quot;liberal&quot; of them does it. As I understand it those words are offically
prohibited unless oyu are actually a homosexual speaking to another
homosexual. Any other use, as in the Lone Weasel's or Al (My Pal) Gonzales'
lately would seem to constitute &quot;hate speech&quot; as least according to my PC
handbook.

Let's try and be a better example.

&gt;&gt; detonators on one bomb did not fire, which presumably would have released
&gt;&gt; nuclear material into the environment.

&gt; Nuclear weapons are designed not to explode or rupture unless intended.
&gt; The plane could have hit a mountain at full cruise speed, and
&gt; the bombs would not go off.  The plane could burn itself into nothing, and
&gt; the bombs would not detonate.  The &quot;detonators&quot; are small charges
&gt; designed to drive an internal mechanism into position so that a sequence
&gt; of timed electrical charges can initiate compression of the nuclear
&gt; material.  If the detonators explode without the bomb being sequenced,
&gt; nothing at all happens....no nuclear material is exposed.  The casing of
&gt; the
&gt; nuclear material can withstand anything short of....are you ready....a
&gt; nuclear detonation.  These devices travel by rail, by road and by air, and
&gt; are built
&gt; to survive the worst crash imaginable.

&gt; The nuclear material cannot be released unless the containment is
&gt; breached, and that is very near impossible to do.

Apparently not, given the articales reporting a release of nucler material
ion impact.

Generally, the containment is

&gt; only breached when the payload is detonated.

&gt; All the bullshit and paranoia about these bombs going off in a crash are

&gt; The missile could literally be dropped into an active volcano and it would
&gt; not detonate...it cannot detonate unless a precise, complicated and exact
&gt; sequence of events occur.  Those events would not occur even if it fell

&gt; You may ask how I know such things...I was with the 522nd Combat Support
&gt; at Grand Forks, ND.  We flew the B-52s during the cold war, and yes we
&gt; flew some of them armed with nuclear weapons.  Those were the cold war
&gt; years...when LRBs were kept in the air 24/7, waiting for a &quot;go order&quot; to
&gt; deliver
&gt; their payloads.

&gt; A B52 carrying non-nuclear munitions is a far greater threat flying over
&gt; populated airspace than any plane carrying nuclear weapons.

&gt; The nuclear weapons will survive the crash without releasing any
&gt; radiation, whereas the standard munitions would detonate on impact or
&gt; during the subsequent fire.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; September 5, 2007
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sources: B - 52 Mistakenly Carried Nukes
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filed at 10:13 a.m. ET

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A B-52 bomber was mistakenly loaded with five
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear warheads during a flight from North Dakota to Louisiana, a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newspaper reported Wednesday.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ===================

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; WOw Nukes on a B 52 !!!? HOw Shocking !   Libmaggots were hoping the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nUkes were loaded on a   Russian Mig and dropped on the US .

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the point is that the military was lax enough to let nukes go
&gt; &gt;&gt; where they were not supposd to be. If they can be incorrectly put on
&gt; &gt;&gt; B-52's, then perhaps they could be &quot;diverted&quot; to other locales as
&gt; &gt;&gt; well.

&gt; &gt;January 24, 1961 - A B-52 bomber suffered a fire caused by a major leak in a
&gt; &gt;wing fuel cell and exploded in midair 12 miles (20 km) north of Seymour Johnson
&gt; &gt;Air Force Base, Goldsboro, North Carolina. The incident released the bomber's
&gt; &gt;two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs. Five crewmen parachuted to safety, but three
&gt; &gt;died-two in the aircraft and one on landing. Three of the four arming devices on
&gt; &gt;one of the bombs activated, causing it to carry out many of the steps needed to
&gt; &gt;arm itself, such as the charging of the firing capacitors and, critically, the
&gt; &gt;deployment of a 100 foot (30 m) diameter retardation parachute. The other bomb
&gt; &gt;plunged into a muddy field at around 700 miles per hour (300 m/s) and
&gt; &gt;disintegrated. Its tail was discovered about 20 feet (7 m) down and much of the
&gt; &gt;bomb recovered, including the tritium bottle and the plutonium. However,
&gt; &gt;excavation was abandoned because of uncontrollable flooding by ground water, and
&gt; &gt;most of the thermonuclear stage, containing uranium, was left in situ. It was
&gt; &gt;estimated to lie at around 180 feet (55 m). The Air Force purchased the land and
&gt; &gt;fenced it off to prevent its disturbance, and it is tested regularly for
&gt; &gt;contamination, although none has so far been found

&gt; And you expect us to take your anti-American word on all these made up
&gt; incidents?

Contamination

The conventional explosive of two of the bombs which fell on land detonated,
causing contamination with uranium and plutonium of 2 square kilometres of land.
1,750 tons of contaminated material were excavated and sent for disposal at the
Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, USA.

The recovered hydrogen bomb was displayed by U.S. Navy officials on the fantail
of the submarine rescue ship U.S.S. Petrel after it was located in the
Mediterranean sea off the coast of Spain at a depth of 2,500 feet and recovered
in April 1966

To defuse alarm of contamination, the Spanish minister for information and
tourism Manuel Fraga and the US ambassador Angie P. Duke swam on a nearby beach
in front of press[3]. There were actually two swims, first the ambassador and
some companions at Mojácar (a resort 15 km away) and a second one with Duke and
Fraga at the Quitapellejos beach in Palomares.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sources: B - 52 Mistakenly Carried Nukes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filed at 10:13 a.m. ET

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A B-52 bomber was mistakenly loaded with five
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear warheads during a flight from North Dakota to Louisiana, a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newspaper reported Wednesday.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ===================

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; WOw Nukes on a B 52 !!!? HOw Shocking !   Libmaggots were hoping the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nUkes were loaded on a   Russian Mig and dropped on the US .

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the point is that the military was lax enough to let nukes go
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where they were not supposd to be. If they can be incorrectly put on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; B-52's, then perhaps they could be &quot;diverted&quot; to other locales as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; well.

&gt;&gt; &gt;January 24, 1961 - A B-52 bomber suffered a fire caused by a major leak
&gt;&gt; &gt;in a
&gt;&gt; &gt;wing fuel cell and exploded in midair 12 miles (20 km) north of Seymour
&gt;&gt; &gt;Johnson
&gt;&gt; &gt;Air Force Base, Goldsboro, North Carolina. The incident released the
&gt;&gt; &gt;bomber's
&gt;&gt; &gt;two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs. Five crewmen parachuted to safety, but three
&gt;&gt; &gt;died-two in the aircraft and one on landing. Three of the four arming
&gt;&gt; &gt;devices on
&gt;&gt; &gt;one of the bombs activated, causing it to carry out many of the steps
&gt;&gt; &gt;needed to
&gt;&gt; &gt;arm itself, such as the charging of the firing capacitors and,
&gt;&gt; &gt;critically, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;deployment of a 100 foot (30 m) diameter retardation parachute. The
&gt;&gt; &gt;other bomb
&gt;&gt; &gt;plunged into a muddy field at around 700 miles per hour (300 m/s) and
&gt;&gt; &gt;disintegrated. Its tail was discovered about 20 feet (7 m) down and much
&gt;&gt; &gt;of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;bomb recovered, including the tritium bottle and the plutonium. However,
&gt;&gt; &gt;excavation was abandoned because of uncontrollable flooding by ground
&gt;&gt; &gt;water, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;most of the thermonuclear stage, containing uranium, was left in situ.
&gt;&gt; &gt;It was
&gt;&gt; &gt;estimated to lie at around 180 feet (55 m). The Air Force purchased the
&gt;&gt; &gt;land and
&gt;&gt; &gt;fenced it off to prevent its disturbance, and it is tested regularly for
&gt;&gt; &gt;contamination, although none has so far been found

&gt;&gt; And you expect us to take your anti-American word on all these made up
&gt;&gt; incidents?

&gt; Sigh. Rightards. Too stupid to use Google...

The problem with your response is that none of the military or civilian
accidents resulted in a criticality that continued
through detonation.  The aircraft crashes are the most telling...the planes
are destroyed, the weapons detonators explode, yet the
nuclear warheads remained intact.

Nuclear weapons are far safer than conventional, HE or incendiary munitions.
When I was in Vietnam, I witnessed the crash site of
a B52 that crashed with a full load of Mk8's.  The fire caused all of the
munitions to explode, wreaking devastation.  The single largest piece of
aircraft that remained was about the size of a silver dollar.  Had that same
plane been carrying nuclear weapons, there would have been dramatically less
destruction; most of the aircraft would have survived the fire and the
detonators exploding.

Those of you that think a plane carrying nukes is more dangerous than all
the planes that fly every day with conventional weapons need to
wake up!

&gt;&gt; The nuclear material cannot be released unless the containment is

&gt; Apparently not, given the articales reporting a release of nucler material
&gt; ion impact.

&gt; Larry

&gt; Generally, the containment is
&gt;&gt; only breached when the payload is detonated.

&gt;&gt; All the bullshit and paranoia about these bombs going off in a crash are
&gt;&gt; completely unfounded.

&gt;&gt; The missile could literally be dropped into an active volcano and it
&gt;&gt; would not detonate...it cannot detonate unless a precise, complicated and
&gt;&gt; exact
&gt;&gt; sequence of events occur.  Those events would not occur even if it fell
&gt;&gt; into a volcano.

&gt;&gt; You may ask how I know such things...I was with the 522nd Combat Support
&gt;&gt; at Grand Forks, ND.  We flew the B-52s during the cold war, and yes we
&gt;&gt; flew some of them armed with nuclear weapons.  Those were the cold war
&gt;&gt; years...when LRBs were kept in the air 24/7, waiting for a &quot;go order&quot; to
&gt;&gt; deliver
&gt;&gt; their payloads.

&gt;&gt; A B52 carrying non-nuclear munitions is a far greater threat flying over
&gt;&gt; populated airspace than any plane carrying nuclear weapons.

&gt;&gt; The nuclear weapons will survive the crash without releasing any
&gt;&gt; radiation, whereas the standard munitions would detonate on impact or
&gt;&gt; during the subsequent fire.

&gt;&gt; Can't handle the truth, eh?

&gt; Stupid stupid Ardy ...

&gt; Contamination

&gt; The conventional explosive of two of the bombs which fell on land
&gt; detonated,
&gt; causing contamination with uranium and plutonium of 2 square kilometres of
&gt; land.
&gt; 1,750 tons of contaminated material were excavated and sent for disposal
&gt; at the
&gt; Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, USA.

&gt; The recovered hydrogen bomb was displayed by U.S. Navy officials on the
&gt; fantail
&gt; of the submarine rescue ship U.S.S. Petrel after it was located in the
&gt; Mediterranean sea off the coast of Spain at a depth of 2,500 feet and
&gt; recovered
&gt; in April 1966

&gt; To defuse alarm of contamination, the Spanish minister for information and
&gt; tourism Manuel Fraga and the US ambassador Angie P. Duke swam on a nearby
&gt; beach
&gt; in front of press[3]. There were actually two swims, first the ambassador
&gt; and
&gt; some companions at Mojácar (a resort 15 km away) and a second one with
&gt; Duke and
&gt; Fraga at the Quitapellejos beach in Palomares.

Complete and utter bullshit....

The detonators exploded.  The nuclear warheads did not detonate.  There
would have been
multiple nuclear explosions...which obviously did not happen.
Both warheads remained intact, without a breach, which is stated multiple
times in the report.
There was no radiological contamination left after the warheads were
removed.

You seem to have the intellectual capacity of a 3 year old.  You read the
word &quot;detonated&quot; and
assume it means the MRV's went off...

You only make yourself look even more foolish than normal when you post such
ignorant interpretations
of a news story.

Hope you get help for your cognitive issues...

&gt;&gt; Generally, the containment is

&gt;&gt;&gt; All the bullshit and paranoia about these bombs going off in a crash are
&gt;&gt;&gt; completely unfounded.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The missile could literally be dropped into an active volcano and it
&gt;&gt;&gt; would not detonate...it cannot detonate unless a precise, complicated
&gt;&gt;&gt; and exact
&gt;&gt;&gt; sequence of events occur.  Those events would not occur even if it fell
&gt;&gt;&gt; into a volcano.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You may ask how I know such things...I was with the 522nd Combat Support
&gt;&gt;&gt; at Grand Forks, ND.  We flew the B-52s during the cold war, and yes we
&gt;&gt;&gt; flew some of them armed with nuclear weapons.  Those were the cold war
&gt;&gt;&gt; years...when LRBs were kept in the air 24/7, waiting for a &quot;go order&quot; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; deliver
&gt;&gt;&gt; their payloads.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A B52 carrying non-nuclear munitions is a far greater threat flying over
&gt;&gt;&gt; populated airspace than any plane carrying nuclear weapons.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The nuclear weapons will survive the crash without releasing any
&gt;&gt;&gt; radiation, whereas the standard munitions would detonate on impact or
&gt;&gt;&gt; during the subsequent fire.

Several cites have been provided in hits thread, some in posts that you have
directly replied to.

You also are moving the goalposts. It started with you claiming that no
radiation leaked. when shown that it incontrovertibly has leaked when bombs
are in accidents you change your claim to nuclear detonation.

Still no citations for a single one of your claims...and

Not a single one of your citations is valid, and most do not support your

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filed at 10:13 a.m. ET

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A B-52 bomber was mistakenly loaded with five
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear warheads during a flight from North Dakota to Louisiana, a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newspaper reported Wednesday.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ===================

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; WOw Nukes on a B 52 !!!? HOw Shocking !   Libmaggots were hoping the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nUkes were loaded on a   Russian Mig and dropped on the US .

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the point is that the military was lax enough to let nukes go
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where they were not supposd to be. If they can be incorrectly put on
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; B-52's, then perhaps they could be &quot;diverted&quot; to other locales as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; well.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;January 24, 1961 - A B-52 bomber suffered a fire caused by a major leak
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;wing fuel cell and exploded in midair 12 miles (20 km) north of Seymour
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Johnson
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Air Force Base, Goldsboro, North Carolina. The incident released the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bomber's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs. Five crewmen parachuted to safety, but three
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;died-two in the aircraft and one on landing. Three of the four arming
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;devices on
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;one of the bombs activated, causing it to carry out many of the steps
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;needed to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;arm itself, such as the charging of the firing capacitors and,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;critically, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;deployment of a 100 foot (30 m) diameter retardation parachute. The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;other bomb
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;plunged into a muddy field at around 700 miles per hour (300 m/s) and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;disintegrated. Its tail was discovered about 20 feet (7 m) down and much
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bomb recovered, including the tritium bottle and the plutonium. However,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;excavation was abandoned because of uncontrollable flooding by ground
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;water, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;most of the thermonuclear stage, containing uranium, was left in situ.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;estimated to lie at around 180 feet (55 m). The Air Force purchased the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;land and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fenced it off to prevent its disturbance, and it is tested regularly for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;contamination, although none has so far been found

&gt; &gt;&gt; And you expect us to take your anti-American word on all these made up
&gt; &gt;&gt; incidents?

&gt; through detonation.  The aircraft crashes are the most telling...the planes

&gt; Nuclear weapons are far safer than conventional, HE or incendiary munitions.
&gt; When I was in Vietnam, I witnessed the crash site of
&gt; a B52 that crashed with a full load of Mk8's.  The fire caused all of the
&gt; munitions to explode, wreaking devastation.  The single largest piece of
&gt; aircraft that remained was about the size of a silver dollar.  Had that same
&gt; plane been carrying nuclear weapons, there would have been dramatically less
&gt; destruction; most of the aircraft would have survived the fire and the

Here's one of Prof's posted materials about radioactive material being exposed

(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_nuclear_accidents )

November 10, 1950 - A B-50 returning one of several US Mark 4 nuclear bombs
secretly deployed in Canada had engine trouble and jettisoned the weapon at
10,500 feet (3,200 m). The bomb, carrying the depleted uranium tamper but not
its plutonium core (&quot;pit&quot;), was set to self-destruct at 2500' (750 m) and
dropped over the St. Lawrence River off Rivière du Loup, Québec. The explosion
shook area residents and scattered nearly 100 pounds (45 kg) of depleted
uranium.

and another

January 31, 1958 - During a simulated takeoff in Morocco a U.S. Air Force B-47
carrying an armed nuclear weapon caught fire when a wheel failure led to its
tail hitting the runway and a fuel tank rupture. Some contamination was detected
immediately following the accident.

and another

March 11, 1958 - A B-47 bomber flying from Savannah, Georgia on a routine
exercise with a nuclear warhead experienced a malfunction. The bomb lock failed
and released a nuclear warhead which fell and detonated the chemical portion in
the suburban neighborhood of Florence, South Carolina. The nuclear part did not
detonate but radioactive substances were flung across the area. Several minor
injuries resulted and the destruction of the house it fell on.

And here's a nice claim of yours

There has never been a documented case of any of the weapons leaking
radioactive material.

with, of course, no cite whatsoever to back it up.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filed at 10:13 a.m. ET

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A B-52 bomber was mistakenly loaded with five
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear warheads during a flight from North Dakota to Louisiana, a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newspaper reported Wednesday.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ===================

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; WOw Nukes on a B 52 !!!? HOw Shocking !   Libmaggots were hoping the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nUkes were loaded on a   Russian Mig and dropped on the US .

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the point is that the military was lax enough to let nukes go
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where they were not supposd to be. If they can be incorrectly put on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; B-52's, then perhaps they could be &quot;diverted&quot; to other locales as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; well.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;January 24, 1961 - A B-52 bomber suffered a fire caused by a major leak
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;wing fuel cell and exploded in midair 12 miles (20 km) north of Seymour
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Johnson
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Air Force Base, Goldsboro, North Carolina. The incident released the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bomber's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs. Five crewmen parachuted to safety, but three
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;died-two in the aircraft and one on landing. Three of the four arming
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;devices on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;one of the bombs activated, causing it to carry out many of the steps
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;needed to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;arm itself, such as the charging of the firing capacitors and,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;critically, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;deployment of a 100 foot (30 m) diameter retardation parachute. The
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;other bomb
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;plunged into a muddy field at around 700 miles per hour (300 m/s) and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;disintegrated. Its tail was discovered about 20 feet (7 m) down and much
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bomb recovered, including the tritium bottle and the plutonium. However,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;excavation was abandoned because of uncontrollable flooding by ground
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;water, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;most of the thermonuclear stage, containing uranium, was left in situ.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;estimated to lie at around 180 feet (55 m). The Air Force purchased the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;land and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fenced it off to prevent its disturbance, and it is tested regularly for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;contamination, although none has so far been found

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And you expect us to take your anti-American word on all these made up
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; incidents?

&gt;&gt; Nuclear weapons are far safer than conventional, HE or incendiary munitions.
&gt;&gt; When I was in Vietnam, I witnessed the crash site of
&gt;&gt; a B52 that crashed with a full load of Mk8's.  The fire caused all of the
&gt;&gt; munitions to explode, wreaking devastation.  The single largest piece of
&gt;&gt; aircraft that remained was about the size of a silver dollar.  Had that same
&gt;&gt; plane been carrying nuclear weapons, there would have been dramatically less
&gt;&gt; destruction; most of the aircraft would have survived the fire and the
&gt;&gt; detonators exploding.

&gt;&gt; Those of you that think a plane carrying nukes is more dangerous than all

&gt;&gt; nuclear detonation.  These devices travel by rail, by road and by air,

&gt;&gt; The nuclear material cannot be released unless the containment is

&gt; Apparently not.

&gt; Here's one of Prof's posted materials about radioactive material being
&gt; exposed

&gt; (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_nuclear_accidents )

&gt; November 10, 1950 - A B-50 returning one of several US Mark 4 nuclear
&gt; bombs
&gt; secretly deployed in Canada had engine trouble and jettisoned the weapon
&gt; at
&gt; 10,500 feet (3,200 m). The bomb, carrying the depleted uranium tamper but
&gt; not
&gt; its plutonium core (&quot;pit&quot;), was set to self-destruct at 2500' (750 m) and
&gt; dropped over the St. Lawrence River off Rivière du Loup, Québec. The
&gt; explosion
&gt; shook area residents and scattered nearly 100 pounds (45 kg) of depleted
&gt; uranium.

I see that you, like many others in this newsgroup, are ignorant as to what
depleted uranium is.

&gt; and another

&gt; January 31, 1958 - During a simulated takeoff in Morocco a U.S. Air Force
&gt; B-47
&gt; carrying an armed nuclear weapon caught fire when a wheel failure led to
&gt; its
&gt; tail hitting the runway and a fuel tank rupture. Some contamination was
&gt; detected
&gt; immediately following the accident.
">

Contamination of what?  Aviation fuel?  It says the tank was ruptured,
causing a fire.
The weapon could sit for hours in burning JP and not detonate. You just
can't seem to
understand that.  The citation does not say what the contamination was, not
the degree.

&gt; and another

&gt; March 11, 1958 - A B-47 bomber flying from Savannah, Georgia on a routine
&gt; exercise with a nuclear warhead experienced a malfunction. The bomb lock
&gt; failed
&gt; and released a nuclear warhead which fell and detonated the chemical
&gt; portion in
&gt; the suburban neighborhood of Florence, South Carolina. The nuclear part
&gt; did not
&gt; detonate but radioactive substances were flung across the area. Several
&gt; minor
&gt; injuries resulted and the destruction of the house it fell on.
">

This one is the most suspicious of the lot.  I cannot find any reference to
this anywhere.
The article states that &quot;radioactive substances&quot; were flung across the area.
This ambiguous
statement means nothing....it could have been paint chips with detectable
levels of residual
radiation....had the isotope been dispersed, and there is only one
radioactive isotope, then
the wording makes no sense.

&gt;&gt; A B52 carrying non-nuclear munitions is a far greater threat flying over

&gt;&gt; The nuclear weapons will survive the crash without releasing any

&gt;&gt; whereas the standard munitions would detonate on impact or

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filed at 10:13 a.m. ET

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A B-52 bomber was mistakenly loaded with
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; five
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear warheads during a flight from North Dakota to Louisiana,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newspaper reported Wednesday.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ===================

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; WOw Nukes on a B 52 !!!? HOw Shocking !   Libmaggots were hoping
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nUkes were loaded on a   Russian Mig and dropped on the US .

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the point is that the military was lax enough to let nukes
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; go
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where they were not supposd to be. If they can be incorrectly put
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; B-52's, then perhaps they could be &quot;diverted&quot; to other locales as
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;January 24, 1961 - A B-52 bomber suffered a fire caused by a major
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;leak
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;wing fuel cell and exploded in midair 12 miles (20 km) north of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Seymour
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Johnson
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Air Force Base, Goldsboro, North Carolina. The incident released the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bomber's
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs. Five crewmen parachuted to safety, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;three
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;died-two in the aircraft and one on landing. Three of the four
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;arming
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;devices on
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;one of the bombs activated, causing it to carry out many of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;steps
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;needed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;arm itself, such as the charging of the firing capacitors and,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;critically, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;deployment of a 100 foot (30 m) diameter retardation parachute. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;other bomb
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;plunged into a muddy field at around 700 miles per hour (300 m/s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;disintegrated. Its tail was discovered about 20 feet (7 m) down and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;much
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bomb recovered, including the tritium bottle and the plutonium.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;However,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;excavation was abandoned because of uncontrollable flooding by
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ground
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;water, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;most of the thermonuclear stage, containing uranium, was left in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;situ.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It was
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;estimated to lie at around 180 feet (55 m). The Air Force purchased
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;land and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fenced it off to prevent its disturbance, and it is tested regularly
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;for
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;contamination, although none has so far been found

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And you expect us to take your anti-American word on all these made
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; incidents?

&gt; BTW, I spent 23 years in the Army...1 year in Iraq...wounded twice.

Bullshit. You're a proven chronic liar and a gutless chickenhawk coward.
You fail to support your claims, you are once again reduced to being

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filed at 10:13 a.m. ET

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A B-52 bomber was mistakenly loaded
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with five
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear warheads during a flight from North Dakota to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Louisiana, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newspaper reported Wednesday.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ===================

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WOw Nukes on a B 52 !!!? HOw Shocking !   Libmaggots were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hoping the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nUkes were loaded on a   Russian Mig and dropped on the US .

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the point is that the military was lax enough to let
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nukes go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where they were not supposd to be. If they can be incorrectly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; put on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B-52's, then perhaps they could be &quot;diverted&quot; to other locales
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; January 24, 1961 - A B-52 bomber suffered a fire caused by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; major leak
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wing fuel cell and exploded in midair 12 miles (20 km) north of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Seymour
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Johnson
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Air Force Base, Goldsboro, North Carolina. The incident
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; released the bomber's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs. Five crewmen parachuted to safety,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but three
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; died-two in the aircraft and one on landing. Three of the four
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; devices on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one of the bombs activated, causing it to carry out many of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; steps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needed to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arm itself, such as the charging of the firing capacitors and,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; critically, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deployment of a 100 foot (30 m) diameter retardation parachute.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other bomb
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plunged into a muddy field at around 700 miles per hour (300
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; m/s) and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disintegrated. Its tail was discovered about 20 feet (7 m) down
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bomb recovered, including the tritium bottle and the plutonium.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; excavation was abandoned because of uncontrollable flooding by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ground
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; water, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most of the thermonuclear stage, containing uranium, was left in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; situ.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; estimated to lie at around 180 feet (55 m). The Air Force
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; purchased the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; land and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fenced it off to prevent its disturbance, and it is tested
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regularly for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contamination, although none has so far been found

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And you expect us to take your anti-American word on all these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; made up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; incidents?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's one of Prof's posted materials about radioactive material
&gt;&gt;&gt; being exposed

&gt;&gt;&gt; (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_nuclear_accidents )
&gt;&gt;&gt; November 10, 1950 - A B-50 returning one of several US Mark 4 nuclear
&gt;&gt;&gt; bombs
&gt;&gt;&gt; secretly deployed in Canada had engine trouble and jettisoned the
&gt;&gt;&gt; weapon at
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10,500 feet (3,200 m). The bomb, carrying the depleted uranium
&gt;&gt;&gt; tamper but not
&gt;&gt;&gt; its plutonium core (&quot;pit&quot;), was set to self-destruct at 2500' (750
&gt;&gt;&gt; m) and dropped over the St. Lawrence River off Rivière du Loup,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Québec. The explosion
&gt;&gt;&gt; shook area residents and scattered nearly 100 pounds (45 kg) of
&gt;&gt;&gt; depleted uranium.

&gt;&gt; I see that ...

&gt; Hey honu hurt donut, you've been proven time and time again to
&gt; be nothing but a habitual liar, gutless war-mongering chickenhawk,
