&gt; Hollywood has a thing for Al Gore and his three-alarm film on global
&gt; warming, ³An Inconvenient Truth,² which won an Academy Award for best
&gt; documentary. So do many environmentalists, who praise him as a
&gt; visionary, and many scientists, who laud him for raising public
&gt; awareness of climate change.
&gt; But part of his scientific audience is uneasy. In talks, articles and
&gt; blog entries that have appeared since his film and accompanying book
&gt; came out last year, these scientists argue that some of Mr. Gores
&gt; central points are exaggerated and erroneous. They are alarmed, some
&gt; say, at what they call his alarmism.
&gt; I dont want to pick on Al Gore, Don J. Easterbrook, an emeritus
&gt; professor of geology at Western Washington University, told hundreds of
&gt; experts at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. But
&gt; there are a lot of inaccuracies in the statements we are seeing, and we
&gt; have to temper that with real data.

Probably the most significant question is whether or not Al Gore's movie
represents a consensus.  One of the people interviewd in the article, Benny
Peiser, makes just that charge.  Here's the lowdown on Peiser:

http://www.desmogblog.com/node/1056

Prior to 1850 and the beginning of large-scale fossil fuel consumption,
atmospheric CO2 had not risen above 280 for at least 800K years.  Now it's
at 380.  Volcanoes?  No.  It's us.

Imagine a Kansas that is too hot and dry to grow wheat.  Work your way up
from there.  Does it make sense to take risks with the environment?  Do you
have a backup planet to live on?

The "flat earth" model was supplanted by - surprise - science.

Milli Vanilli was thought to be capable of sining but it tured out to be
fraud - much like industry shills parading as "climate scientists."

You won't get any consensus of astronomers to agree to that AND you still
have the 100ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 to deal with.  That's a fact.

Actually, from the facts in the story, there's almost no proof that Mars is
heating up and there's less proof that, if such Martian heating exists, that
it's due to an increase in insolation.

The one bare fact cited is that the Martian "ice" caps are disappearing.
This could be happening for several reasons.  Mars *could* be warming, so
they're sublimating.  Or they could be getting covered with dust and are
still there but rendered invisible.  Or the CO2 that makes up the Martian
"ice" caps is no outgassnig noticeably from the Martian atmosphere (this
happens all the time anyway).  Or there could be other factors at work which
we don't undestand.  I don't see anywhere in this article that direct
Martian temperature measurements (which we can probably do) or direct
radiation measurements bear any of that "solar heating" theory out (and we
have had satellites in space for some time, quite capable of direct
measurement of solar radiation).

Jumping from "The Martian 'ice' caps are disappearing" to "therefore the sun
is heating up" could be called "convenient" science.  It's convenient for
those who feel threatened by current theories of global warming.  But it's
better to call it junk science.

If the Martian 'ice' caps are disappearning, it would be nice to know why.
I think we should investigate that.

I can't be held responsible for your inability to communicate clearly.  You
clipped my post down to a reference about Mars and then referred to a UN
report without other context.

I suggest you take a writing or communications class.  Also, classes in
logic would probably help you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The &quot;consensus&quot; was once that the earth was flat and Milli Vannilli
&gt;&gt;&gt; could sing.

&gt;&gt; The &quot;flat earth&quot; model was supplanted by - surprise - science.

&gt; No, it was supplanted by Christopher Columbus.

&gt; And there is NO science linking human activity to &quot;global warming&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Milli Vanilli was thought to be capable of sining but it tured out to
&gt;&gt; be fraud - much like communists and socialists posing as
&gt;&gt; &quot;environmentalists.&quot;

&gt; IFYPFY

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prior to 1850 and the beginning of large-scale fossil fuel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consumption, atmospheric CO2 had not risen above 280 for at least
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 800K years.  Now it's at 380.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.  It is 100% impossible to know what atmospheric CO2 was in 1850,
&gt;&gt;&gt; much less 800,000 years ago.

&gt;&gt; Ice cores provide a good record and can be calibrated to match the
&gt;&gt; Mauna Loa readings.  We have very good information about prehistoric
&gt;&gt; CO2 levels.

&gt; No, we have very good information about ice cores.  They're cold.  Beyond
&gt; that, we know little.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.  Even if CO2 levels have risen, there is no way to show such a
&gt;&gt;&gt; condition
&gt;&gt;&gt; is due to human activity.

&gt;&gt; So, where else did it come from?

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3.  For the past 120 years, so-called &quot;scientists&quot; have alternated
&gt;&gt;&gt; about every 30 years between predicting an Ice Age and predicting
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;global warming&quot;.

&gt; An August 9, 1923 front page article in the Chicago Tribune declared:
&gt; &quot;Scientist Says Arctic Ice Will Wipe Out Canada.&quot; The article quoted a

And all those things antedate a considerable body of information and

We have another difference - measurable change that is in line with

&gt; &quot;global warming&quot;.

&gt; &quot;Bull&quot;.  You were wrong.  Admit it.

OK.  There have been chicken little reports in the press periodically.  I
was wrong about that.

To what extent is this relevant?  Are you saying the science of 1895 is as
good as 2005?  Are you saying that publications in regular newspapers always
reflect scientific consensus and state of the art?  Would you like your
heart disease, cancer, broken bones, appendicitis, etc, to be  treated by
people with the medical knowledge and equipment of 1895?  Of even 1974?

And, the latest science appears to be correct:

That remains to be seen.  Most scientists in a position to know think we do
have that capability and that we are using it.  Something has driven the CO2
levels to something that is 1/3 beyond historic highs.  You explain it.
We're digging up the dead plants of prehistoric times and burning them at
industrial rates.  The atmospher does well with 280ppm.  Can you guarantee
it will do as well with 380ppm?  Next year, we'll be at 381.  The rate of
increase has increased, of late, to 1ppm/year.  Will it increase faster?
How is it removed from the atmosphere?  Why aren't these mechanisms keeping
up?

Which experts will you be listening to?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;less 800,000 years ago.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It's the sun.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Agreed.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mars is heating up and Al Bore's movie and his idiotic carbon
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; footprint isn't there....

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Scott in  Florida

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually, from the facts in the story, there's almost no proof that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mars
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; heating up and there's less proof that, if such Martian heating
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exists,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it's due to an increase in insolation.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The one bare fact cited is that the Martian &quot;ice&quot; caps are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; disappearing.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This could be happening for several reasons.  Mars *could* be warming,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; so
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they're sublimating.  Or they could be getting covered with dust and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; still there but rendered invisible.  Or the CO2 that makes up the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Martian
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;ice&quot; caps is no outgassnig noticeably from the Martian atmosphere
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; happens all the time anyway).  Or there could be other factors at work
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we don't undestand.  I don't see anywhere in this article that direct
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Martian temperature measurements (which we can probably do) or direct
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; radiation measurements bear any of that &quot;solar heating&quot; theory out
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have had satellites in space for some time, quite capable of direct
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; measurement of solar radiation).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jumping from &quot;The Martian 'ice' caps are disappearing&quot; to &quot;therefore
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sun
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is heating up&quot; could be called &quot;convenient&quot; science.  It's convenient
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; those who feel threatened by current theories of global warming.  But
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; better to call it junk science.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the Martian 'ice' caps are disappearning, it would be nice to know
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; why.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think we should investigate that.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It's the SUN, SUN, SUN!!!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sheeeezzzzz!!

&gt;&gt; You'd make a lousy scientist.  Provide evidence that disappearing ice
&gt;&gt; caps
&gt;&gt; are not a result of the other two explanations I offered.

&gt; did you watch the video?  It's all there.  Many scientists all agree
&gt; with it.  The sun is causing the cyclic temperature changes of the earth
&gt; and has been going on for billions of years.  It will continue until the
&gt; sun becomes a red giant at which time the earth will perish.

&gt; Your version puts man more powerful than the sun, which is absurd.
">

We can engineer vehicles which can escape the Sun's gravity.  Does that make
us more powerful than the sun?

We have caused species to go extinct.  The buffalo, for example, nearly went
extinct due to our hunting of it.  We have tremendous influence over the
biosphere.

And it's not one-way.  I used to live within spitting distance of rivers
that were dead and poisoned.  I'm not sure about swimming but you can fish
in them now (uncertain if you should actually eat the fish).

used to look 'back' they do not 'see' or predict the last ice age.   LOL

What's amusing is that first the dittoheads denied that the warming
was occuring at all. When they were proven wrong the changed their
story and claimed that while global warming was occurring, it was not
affected by the burning of fossil fuel. When they were proven wrong on
this, they did the only thing they knew how to do, attack the
scientists. See " http://www.salon.com/comics/tomo/2007/02/26/tomo/
index1.html"

The Atlantic Monthly cover story for April is "Global Warming: Who
Loses -- and Who Wins." According to the article, the benefiaries of
global warming, which will include Russia, Canada, Greenland, Alaska,
and other cold climates that will become more temperate. Already the
growing season in Greenland has become two weeks longer in just the
past 20 years.

The problem with people like dbu is that they've never been taught any
critical thinking skills, they actually believe people like Limbaugh,
Hannity and O'Reilly. It's a sad state of affairs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sprach forth the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably the most significant question is whether or not Al
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gore's movie represents a consensus.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The &quot;consensus&quot; was once that the earth was flat and Milli
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vannilli could sing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The &quot;flat earth&quot; model was supplanted by - surprise - science.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it was supplanted by Christopher Columbus.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And there is NO science linking human activity to &quot;global warming&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Milli Vanilli was thought to be capable of sining but it tured out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be fraud - much like communists and socialists posing as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;environmentalists.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IFYPFY

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prior to 1850 and the beginning of large-scale fossil fuel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consumption, atmospheric CO2 had not risen above 280 for at least
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 800K years.  Now it's at 380.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.  It is 100% impossible to know what atmospheric CO2 was in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1850, much less 800,000 years ago.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ice cores provide a good record and can be calibrated to match the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mauna Loa readings.  We have very good information about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prehistoric CO2 levels.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, we have very good information about ice cores.  They're cold.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beyond that, we know little.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.  Even if CO2 levels have risen, there is no way to show such a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; condition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is due to human activity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, where else did it come from?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3.  For the past 120 years, so-called &quot;scientists&quot; have alternated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about every 30 years between predicting an Ice Age and predicting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;global warming&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bull.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Geologists Think the World May be Frozen Up Again.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Headline in February 24, 1895 New York Times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1895, not 1995.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A front page article in the October 7, 1912 New York Times, just a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; few months after the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, declared
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that a prominent professor &quot;Warns Us of an Encroaching Ice Age.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In 1912, the Los Angeles Times ran an article warning that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Human race will have to fight for its existence against cold.&quot; An
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; August 10, 1923 Washington Post article declared: &quot;Ice Age Coming
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;America in Longest Warm Spell Since 1776; Temperature Line Records
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a 25- year Rise&quot; stated an article in the New York Times on March
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 27, 1933. The media of yesteryear was also not above injecting large
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amounts of fear and alarmism into their climate articles.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An August 9, 1923 front page article in the Chicago Tribune
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declared: &quot;Scientist Says Arctic Ice Will Wipe Out Canada.&quot; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; article quoted a Yale
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; University professor who predicted that large parts of Europe and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Asia would be &quot;wiped out&quot; and Switzerland would be &quot;entirely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obliterated.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A December 29, 1974 New York Times article on global cooling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reported that climatologists believed &quot;the facts of the present
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; climate change are such that the most optimistic experts would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assign near certainty to major crop failure in a decade.&quot;   The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; article also warned that unless government officials reacted to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coming catastrophe, &quot;mass deaths by starvation and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably in anarchy and violence&quot; would result.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In 1975, the New York Times reported that &quot;A major cooling [was]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; widely considered to be inevitable.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And all those things antedate a considerable body of information and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.  You called my statement:

&gt;&gt;&gt; For the past 120 years, so-called &quot;scientists&quot; have alternated about
&gt;&gt;&gt; every 30 years between predicting an Ice Age and predicting
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;global warming&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Bull&quot;.  You were wrong.  Admit it.

&gt;&gt; OK.  There have been chicken little reports in the press periodically.
&gt;&gt; I was wrong about that.

&gt; Not &quot;periodically&quot;.  Consistently.  Including today.

&gt;&gt; To what extent is this relevant?  Are you saying the science of 1895 is
&gt;&gt; as good as 2005?

&gt; No, I'm saying the politically-motivated so-called &quot;scientists&quot; of 2007
&gt; have not demonstrated a single link between human activity and so-called
&gt; &quot;global warming&quot;.
">

Politically motivated?  What do they expect to gain?  They might oppose
policies that they think are hazardous to our long-term health but they're
not running for office (they've already got fun jobs) and they don't seem to
be hitting the hustings for candidates or seeking patronage jobs or product
endorsements.

The goal of scientists is to be right.  First, to learn the truth and then
to be recognized for it.  Secondarily, to let the air out of something
that's wrong is probably very satisfying.

If you're thinking the "skeptics" are those particular knights in shining
armor, you might notice that they don't actually do much research or publish
very often.  Mostly, they just shill for foundations that report to fossil
fuel companies or, in Fred Singer's case, the Reverend Sun Myung Moon (a
laugh in itself).

WORD ONE..." ranting.

The link is there.  Apparently, you overlooked the bit about the isotopes
identifying fossil CO2?

That's what I like about science, the clues are all there, you just have to
be willing to look and think.

Speaking of "Global Warming - the Swindle TV Hack Job," I watched a part of
it - and may yet finish.  But I have other things to do and my motivation is
low, because I was able to readily identify, out of the first 12 minutes or
so, several instances of the show misrepresenting someone's point of view or
enthusiastic skeptics who are actually in the pay of fossil energy
companies.  OK, indirectly in the pay thereof.  Their stink tanks get

&gt; I watched gore's move yesterday.  It is highly political, it is all
&gt; about gore.  When watching it you have to assume gore is an expert,
&gt; (he's not) and you have to be a gore fan, otherwise forget it.

&gt; About the only thing I can agree with him on is all the cars, we've got
&gt; too many and that's because we have a growing population and everybody
&gt; wants a car.  As for global warming, it's the sun stupid.
">

I am fairly certain that Al mentions, right at the outset, that he's not an
expert.  He relies on experts.  He is conveying to us what he has learned
from experts.

And it's pointless to criticize the movie, as the paid skeptics do, as
though it were a scientific paper.  It is not and is not intended to be and
it's pointless to judge it in that way.  It's a documentary, making a case
for and calling our attention to a problem.

If you believe that, then I can't be nearly as stupid as you.  With the
clowns currently in the Administartion, you can expect that the merest whiff
of denial "science" should result in a fat grant.

Does the name Phil Cooney ring a bell?  He used to run a department up
there.  See what he's doing now - and before he joined the Administration.

NOAA or NASA (can't remember for sure which - and really don't care) had
some kid who flunked out of journalism school doing the final edit on papers
actual researchers had written. He couldn't understand pages 2 through 165
but he knew how to redline key phrases that oil companies wouldn't like to

&gt;&gt; That's what I like about science, the clues are all there, you just
&gt;&gt; have to be willing to look and think.

&gt;&gt; Speaking of &quot;Global Warming - the Swindle TV Hack Job,&quot; I watched a
&gt;&gt; part of it - and may yet finish.  But I have other things to do and my
&gt;&gt; motivation is low, because I was able to readily identify, out of the
&gt;&gt; first 12 minutes or so, several instances of the show misrepresenting
&gt;&gt; someone's point of view or enthusiastic skeptics who are actually in
&gt;&gt; the pay of fossil energy companies.  OK, indirectly in the pay thereof.
&gt;&gt;  Their stink tanks get dino-dollar funding.

&gt; More baseless smears from a compulsive liar.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, because of a period of unusual activity on our PRIMARY SOURCE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OF HEAT.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And your source for this is?

&gt;&gt;&gt; NOAA.

&gt;&gt; Cite?

&gt; Already gave it to you.  Further proof that your mind is totally closed,
&gt; since you obviously didn't look at it.
">

Then I must have inadvertently overlooked it.  What's the date and time on
the note that contains it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That remains to be seen.  Most scientists in a position to know think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we do have that capability and that we are using it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then let them demonstrate it.

&gt;&gt; What would you like them to do?  Dig up an extremely large quantity of
&gt;&gt; coal and burn it?

&gt; No - show a connect-the-dots like I describe below.  They haven't because
&gt; they can't.
">

You're talking about an experiment, then.  The only "lab" available for a
full-scale experiment is the one we're standing on.

Although, in effect, we ARE running the experiment.  Involuntarily and
without the consent of all the potentially affected parties.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; driven the CO2 levels to something that is 1/3 beyond historic highs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You explain it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not arrogant enough.

You're not educated enough to explain it, you're unwilling to get educated
enough to explain it and you're unwilling to give credit to people who work
very hard to understand and explain it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Heat is energy.  Einstein demonstrated that
&gt;&gt;&gt; energy is a constant.

Now the light begins to dawn... I should have realized this earlier, you
don't have a clue.  What you're referring to was figured out before
Einstein.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The simplest examples make that easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt; understand: a brake disc heats up (positive heat energy) when a car
&gt;&gt;&gt; slows down (negative kinetic energy).  Your skin cools off (negative
&gt;&gt;&gt; heat energy) when
&gt;&gt;&gt; sweat evaporates (positive kinetic energy).

Evaporative cooling, genius.

And waste heat, Mr. Rocket Scientist.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; So where is the formula, the science, the example, to show that one or
&gt;&gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt;&gt; kinds of energy are being converted to heat?
">

That's the Global Warming model, Mr. Science Person.  It's a shitload of
equations, referred to as a model and people who understand physics,
chemistry, math and a lot of other stuff that you probably can't spell,
argue incessantly about the exact nature of the formulas, the parameters
involved and the weights to be given to the individual phenomena that
they're trying to describe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Well, there's your problem.  It's not heat conversion, it's heat
&gt;&gt; entrapment or reflection and reradiation.

&gt; OK, so let me get this straight - first there was a crisis because of a
&gt; hole in the ozone layer (a hole being an avenue through which heat could
&gt; escape), but now heat's being trapped, despite there being a hole in the
&gt; ozone?  Please get your delusional fantasies straight, fella.
">

And now we have reached the part where I have to laugh.  The Ozone hole has
very little effect on global warming.  It's certainly the case taht people
who are interested in one are interested in the other (in learning about
one, they gather a lot of information useful to the other).

Now, at the risk of confusing you further (which seems terribly easy), I ran
across a paper where people described looking at that because there's some
concern that changes in the ozone layer may mask or alter readings.  It is
possible this is why the tropospheric temperature measurements don't conform
more closely to the models.  Or it could be other effects.

That's right - all these closed-minded, conspiratorial scientists are
looking for additional information and coming up with new ideas all the
time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;  Kinetic energy is not
&gt;&gt; involved.

&gt; Uh, the kinetic energy examples were just that - EXAMPLES.  Obviously
&gt; there
&gt; are other transfers of energy, and our technology CAN make SOME of those
&gt; transfers more efficient - for example the incandescant light bulb
&gt; converts
&gt; electric energy into light energy but some of that electricity is wasted
&gt; and heat is instead produced; the fluorescent bulb converts electric to
&gt; light without wasted heat and thus runs both cooler and more efficiently.
">

Have you actually read anything on Global Warming or do you just listen to
ignoramuses on talk radio spouting off about it?  Kinetic energy is not the
issue.  I'm quite sure that winds are studied (and they do carry kinetic
energy) but the bulk of the model has to do with heat radiation, transfer
and absorption at the Earth's surface and various levels of the atmosphere.

Energy efficiency will certainly make a difference - but not in the way you
think.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The point is, all of these actions can be MEASURED.  If human activity
&gt; caused global warming, it would be an elementary exercise to say that a
&gt; factory burning X tons of coal a year produces Y therms of heat and when
&gt; multiplied by 5,000 similar factories that causes Z degrees change in the
&gt; climate.  The reason scientists haven't done so is that one could then
&gt; demonstrate that the heat from the sun, or a volcano, or any other number
&gt; of things, dwarfs the heat created by all the factories combined.
">

Are you trolling?  I can hardly believe you're this confused.  Global
warming models are not about the effects of immediate heat release (your "Y
therms" and to put it into your confused transfer terms, the transfer of
chemical
potential into different kinds of heat energy).  If that were the only
effect, it would be, as you say, fairly insignificant.  The problem is that
the sun's natural radiation and the earth's residual heat, principally in
the form of IR are being

&gt; &quot;Experts&quot; who rely on government funding (which increased from $170

&gt;&gt; And it's pointless to criticize the movie, as the paid skeptics do

&gt; The &quot;paid&quot; people here are the GW cultists, such as James Hansen, who got

&gt; A problem that doesn't exist.

Then, to reach 380ppm CO2 concentration, we've got, what?  A volcano in
every back yard?
