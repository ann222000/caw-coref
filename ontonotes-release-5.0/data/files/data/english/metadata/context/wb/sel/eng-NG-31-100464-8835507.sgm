PURPO5E STATEMENT

This little manual was written in order to help the RTRRT users, that
is Real Time Reality Rendering initiates, in their first steps. Its
purpose is to serve as live personal guide. For further guidance,
please mail klaudio_ ... @yahoo.com

REBOOT

The last package issued is entitled Reboot. The packages are variously
entitled Wishwheel, Majik Wand or Instant Magick. One should be
careful not to confuse the RTRRT packages with astrological stuffi. In
order to do so it is best to follow the latest editorialii, which is
free for download.

The basic techniques that are bundled within your RTRRT package are
Cascade (a simple cut-through), O5 (five-step clearing) and the PCS
(Personal Cosmic Secretary). Installing the PCS requires time and
effort much like in taming a black panther, but of course what is
really tamed1 as well as discreated is false ego, the false image one
was forced to adopt about oneself &quot;in order to survive&quot; in this &quot;real
world&quot;. Everybody sees falsities at every corner still we are all told
this is our world and the &quot;real world&quot;. Well, let it be so for a
while, while we inspect some points that will help you perform better
with the RTRRT.

LOCAL2 CHRISTENDOM

Since Christendom3 is most probably the default (and therefore basic)
operating system in use within your own environment (however pagan you
might be), we decided to dedicate our special publications to the
study of Christendom. The Bible Works is a compilation dealing with
the variegated4 aspects of the Christian religion as pro or contra
personal freedom, astrology and magick5. As Christendom is derived
mostly from a book, the Holy Bible, and seldom from firsthand
experience, locally it may adopt strange habits that have nothing to
do with the pure program as set by the Father and the Son.

YOUR TRUE WISH

It is clear from inspection that most of our wishes are not genuinely
our own at all. Wishes are generated and imposed on us by society. In
the marketing society, one hardly knows one's true wish. We are being
told we will be happy with such and such a partner in such and such a
way as we pick that suggestion and try to implant it into our lives.
Sometimes it just does not fit. It did not work for your idol either.
Meaning there was no idol. Let us consider Paris6 Hilton, due to her
bombastic name. One wants to be rich and famous like Paris Hilton,
which entails... One wants to feel empty like her. One wants to drink
like her. One wants to go to jail like she did. Nice heroes do we have
here. Even following a religion that is on the market such as in the
case of Madonna who probably genuinely does not know that her p$eudo-
religion has nothing to do with Hebrew tradition at all. Self-worship
perhaps reaches the apex in the cult of Elvis the Great. Those people
are not guilty much since Rome taught idol worshiping to the pagans.

CENTRAL WISHiii

Providing that your wish was not in the shopping screen as suggested
by the motley devil, you can proceed with absolute certainty that your
life is your own and not owned by the industry. This is hardly said of
people who live to display trademarks to the paparazzi. Once that some
&quot;viveka7&quot; has set in, one will enjoy separating one's true wishes from
the garbage as imposed by the market. The wish in the shopping screen
can also be a true wish, especially if it is a magick sword that helps
you discerning what you want from what you really would do without.
Cinderella has some heavy separation to do between the chaff and the
wheat. Time will tell you your central wish. People who have a
mission  or central goal are concentrated people who hardly dissipate
energy as they live 24 hours a day, enthusiastically following their
cherished destiny. Their destination is known to them as they approach
it; they feel near to God and their own selves. Their life has a
purpose. They are moreover probably not at all approaching uncertainty
in afterlife8.

REQUESTiv

In order to make a request from infinity one is welcome to purify9
oneself first. Purifying of course polishes the edge of your true
wish, too. Our suggestion was to formally introduce oneself to
infinity10. After the introduction, one immediately proceeds at
nagging and complaining to one's heart content. Hours will do. The
technique can happen spontaneously over a cliff as dramatic
environment adds to the pathos11.

MUSIC

Music can be integrated within the RTRR environment; in fact, it has
to be integrated to make it all safe and sound. Sound ideas sound well
within a sound musical environment. As lyrics is important chose your
own lyrics well above subliminal tapes. Make it personal. Subliminal
tapes are for the average victim, your music is only yours. Compose,
make a mix, remix, that is what reality rendering is about. Integrate
music into your life. Whistle out from any boring music jam. Have your
own music! A special sound sometimes happen in Bogeyman as one is led
by this special sound in active dreaming. The &quot;brahmari mudra12&quot; can
also be inspiring. Mantras abound even in Hebrew form. Behold! The
creator of the RTRRT is a composer and musician. It is within our
plans to sustain musical production as the natural sequel to our
latest work.

TIME TRACKv

There is a definite way to overcome the worst astrological transit in
its own future when it happens13. The trick is to use a timeline. The
road ahead may look gloomy and broken bridges may appear in the
apocalyptic dusk. Such a road has to be repaired. One may have clouds
ahead that need sunshine to dispel. The first thing to do as concerns
timeline is to do some repairing for the benefit of the road ahead as
well as the one beyond us One may stand aside from the road or even
look back. Living in the past produces the opposite effect from going
ahead of one's time. Moreover, time can spiral, follow an elliptic
orbit14, and remain strictly circular15, or even speed along a Möbius
track16.

NOW

Instead of entering a timeline, deadline, or working with time at all,
try using the moment of now17. Imagine your wish come true now.

FORMULATING SENTENCES

The alpha sentences are never formulated in the future tense. &quot;I will
be happy&quot; becomes &quot;I AM happy&quot;. This is according to the &quot;I AM&quot;18
formula as known through Vedic literature and the Holy Bible as well.
To formulate one's affirmations in the now is nothing new, but here
comes the surprise. If a &quot;not-now&quot; formula slips into the letter to
your RTRR administrator, the admin will correct it. However, what
about all the other suggestions that you affirm, that is, accept
during the day? What? Do I have to stay in vigilance for the whole of
the 24 hours? Of course, yes! The RTRRT must overflow the whole of
your essence, otherwise life will be a half an hour isle in the sea of
things you do not want. What you really want must become your day, all
24 hours time! So, don't let negative or imperfect suggestions slip
under the carpet of the limbo of your mind. Sweep all the rooms,
especially the entrance. This means a careful inspection of close
friendsvi as well as major clearing of just acquaintances. This is
precisely what al saints have done. Now you do not want to become
saint but you do want to have a good life. That is possible. Our
suggestions work towards your whole investment into your life,
progressively that is, otherwise you might have half an hour with your
wife, half a hour with your children and half a hour with yourself!

BREATHING

A student asked if breathing is important during the O5 routine19. It
is!

VIVIDNESS

Visualization seems to be a problem to many in our allegedly visual
world. We suggested a good 3D program in order to practice
perspective. Reality rendering is otherwise independent from
visualization20, as the feel is more important than the blueprint.

A HOLE IN THE MATRIX

We must admit that drilling a hole in the matrix has somewhat of a
predator's knack as one actually enjoys intruding into the allegedly
harmonious flow of events by planting one's own &quot;poisonous seeds&quot; into
the structure of the matrix, like some rowdy matrix hacker. The idea
came from Cry for Dawn, a cult comic. The hero is confronted with
society in the form of a dragon. Every tiny victory is one scale less
on the dragon's armor. The matrix can be represented as a dragon
(precisely what we read in the Revelation). This dragonvii is to be
discreated (by God, but why not give Him a hand?).

Rev 20:14  and death and hades were cast into the lake of fire. This
is the second death, even the lake of fire.
