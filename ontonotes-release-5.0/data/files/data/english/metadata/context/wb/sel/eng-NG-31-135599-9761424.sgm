I'd like to have more than one computer hosted on the same UPS, since
they'll share a monitor and the load is acceptable.

APC provides software that shuts down the machine in the event a power
failure lasts more than a certain time. In order to have other
machines on that battery unit also shut down, I was thinking of
writing a little app that runs on all machines, such that if any one
of them is shut down due to a power failure, the others would be
informed automatically so they could shut down.

Actually, &quot;hibernate&quot; is the better term here.

I enjoy writing apps in VB6, so that's why I'm asking here. So, is
this simple? TCP/IP? Or even, has this been done already?

Thanks
tbone

Might have been done, but it's easy to do it yourself. Use UDP to
broadcast a message from the APC-connected machine. A listener on each
other machine responds to the broadcast.

Plunk down a winsock control, set it to UDP, and pick a port (above,
say, 50000). UDP is connectionless, just set it and go.

This assumes that the VB program responding to the UDP broadcast has
the needed rights and privileges to shut down the machine.
