Greetings and salutations.

Many of the &quot;50 days that changed history&quot; are, of course, no such
things: merely results of previous decisive events, such as the
Confederation getting the tar whupped out of it for two years
straight.

But let's take this one - Lee surrenders at Appotomax courthouse - and
see what we can do with it.

First, in the spirit of Dozois's &quot;Counterfactual&quot; (some spoilers
ahead), we have &quot;Lee fights on&quot; , with the Civil war devolving into a
long, messy, drawn out guerilla war. I suspect this may not be
possible, even if we have *Lee [1] instead of Lee: the south was
battered and war-weary at this point. Dozois's story has Lincoln
assasinated earlier than OTL and a &quot;merciless president Johnson&quot;
pursuing the war, but even with such stacking of the deck, I'm
doubtful.

The other option is no Lee to surrender - say, Lee gets a really good
cook, and several years of fattening food plus the rigors of
campaigning bring on a lethal heart attack early in the war. Does the
war end earlier? In which case, a less thoroughly ground-into-the-dirt
south might actually try &quot;informal&quot; means of resistance - or perhaps
even try again a couple decades later, especially if a winninger
Lincoln doesn't feel the need to make the the Emancipation
Proclamation. Or is Lee overrated? In any case, who do southerners
find sufficiently brilliant and untainted to serve as a national idol
in his absence? A south whose greatest military hero is Nathan Bedford
Forrest will have some image problems worse than OTL...perhaps
&quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson will survive in this TL.

IIRC The Missouri version of the Civil War so sickened the Southern
leadership that they decided that the honorable course was surrender.
This decision was made very close to the actual end of the war and had
no effect on the outcome. Even Nathan Bedford Forrest counseled
surrender.

However, if the leadership had said every man is on his own and the
locally based officers had taken the initiative you might have seen a
very hit and run guerilla on the order of Missouri where the enemy was
anyone you picked out and personal revenge was a much an element as
patriotism.

Gather the James and Qantrills into the hills of Virginia, Tennessee,
Kentucky and North Carolina, have &quot;cells&quot; in places like Richmond and
New Orleans, Reconstruction leaders assassinated, the KKK a group with
a mission and the end of the Civil War could have dribbled out for ten
years. Lots of AH on the subject.

Part of what made Lee so admired was just why he didn't take
to the hills...he was as close as the South ever got to the
mythical Virginia Cavalier Gentleman. He saw no point
in an ugly war for the sake of it (although his subordinates did,
and begged him). For this reason, I think that if he had
called for guerilla war, most of the Army of Northern Virginia
(what was left of it) would follow him. The soldiers still in
the field with him were the real fanatics, who either admired
him personally or believed in the cause. Everybody else
had deserted.

So if Lee takes to the hills -- let the Hatfields and McCoys
be unleashed. (To an extent, that was OTL, but not with
official sanction.)

Giving how unsanitary his camp was, an illness could have
gotten him (he had bad diarrhea during Gettysburg,
and it killed more soldiers than the fighting did).

He also could have been killed during one of the Grant
attrition battles, easily -- he kept exposing himself,
and his soldiers begged him to fall back: &quot;Lee to the
rear.&quot; Easy for an artillery shell to get him.

Does the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; war end earlier?
">

Depends on when he's dead. Early on, the Union
generals were so bad that the remnants of his
dream team could hold them off. Later, the Union
generals were sharper but still weak...maybe, maybe
not. (Hooker was mostly incompetent, but he had
some skills...and part of why he lost was that Lee
was his old poker buddy, and knew him well.) In
the late war, post-Grant, I'm not sure. Could Grant
actually besiege Richmond early without Lee, or
would it just be the same old war of attrition?

I'm not sure which of his corps commanders would
be picked on his death -- does Davis pick, or was
there a formal rule? Depends on who's still alive,
of course. While Jackson is the obvious choice,
he didn't really have a temperament for overall
command, and most people knew it.

Whoever it is, they get to decide whether to take
to the hills or surrender. Longstreet? Hill?

That's kind of what the Klan was, only to prevent black
rights rather than for independence. Forrest could found
a *Klan for undermining the Union if the South hasn't
been reconciled.

Well, his myth will be greater in death than in life, just
like Stonewall's. I suspect it will be considered scientific
fact in the South (and much of the North) for decades
that Lee would have won it if he'd lived.

A question: while Forrest was hated in the North during
the war, was he that hated in the North during the Gilded
Age and Belle Epoque? AFAIK, the Fort Pillow Massacre
was almost forgotten for years, and given Northern
indifference to black rights, his main sins weren't
too important to them

perhaps

He'd make a much worse idol than Lee, especially
if he's alive. He was a crank, so religious that it
turned people off, and utterly brutal to his men
(who never loved him as much as Lee). But this
is mythmaking, and the Lost Cause could edit
that out.

Well, a lot of southerners thought it possible. Had the rebels resorted to
guerilla violence the north would probably have taken radical steps to
surpress them. Probable effects might have been a more permanent
alientation of southern whites from the rest of the country, but proably a
noticable improvement of status for southern blacks (consider a
reconstruction policy that was permanent, and many southern whites
subjected to policies similar to those the British used after the Jacobite
rebellions to permanently &quot;break&quot; thier opponents).

What major battles did he win?

None, AFAIK.

He bombarded Fort Sumter. Not a real battle.

He was in joint command with Joe Johnston
at First Manassas.

He was A. S. Johnston's 2ic at Shiloh, and
commanded the retreat.

He evacuated Corinth.

He commanded the defenses of Charleston in 1863,
but that was siege warfare. (Boring.)

He commanded around Petersburg in 1864, defeating
Butler at Drewry's Bluff, and later holding
Petersburg with a small force till Lee got there.

Creditable, but all very secondary.

Let's say Lee was taken out in the Wilderness.
There were a couple of moments when he was

Longstreet would assume command. I don't see
any great variance in the campaign. Grant
would sidestep to the south and east, Longstreet
would conform, and the armies would move toward
Richmond. There's no reason to think that Grant
would be any more successful at Cold Harbor, or
that he would not then strike at Petersburg.

Of course butterflies are possible: the Union
nearly took Petersburg in the initial attack;
the &quot;Crater&quot; attack might have succeeded if
Meade hadn't interfered.

The only definite change I could see is that
the loss of Lee would demoralize the AoNV,

There were large areas of the CSA where
over half the population were ex-slaves.

There were large areas of the CSA where
most of the white population were Unionists.

These areas did not overlap.

There were also large numbers of white
southerners who hadn't been hot secessionists,
and had had a bellyfull of war. They had homes
and families to provide for.

The only areas where there could be on-going
resistance were areas like Missouri and Texas,
where there was wild country to hide out in,
not too many blacks, and a lot of people who
were bitter at the Union.

Who's going to serve in guerrilla forces
in VA, SC, GA, MS? The big planters? They
have their land to lose. The poor whites?
They have nothing to gain.

There is always the fringe group that just likes to shoot people and
then make any survivors cower at the prospect of being next. Much of
the Missouri killing (see Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in
Missouri During the American Civil War by Michael Fellman ) was over
personal grudges or to show the locals who was running things. Union
and Confederate no difference.

POD July 2, 1863, Lee appeared to be not well. Instead of the
debatebale situation OTL, Lee has a massive coronary late in the
afternoon of the 2nd. By sundown Lee is dead.

Word would spread like wildfire. The immediate result is that
Longstreet is in charge of the Confederate forces. Given Lee's
sentiments thon the 2nd, Longstreet is caught, even more than
historically, in a bind. Lee wanted an attack. The troops are
probably fired up (small chance they are depressed) wanting to
give the old man one last victory. But Longstreet has a good idea
what hitting the Union will cost.

I see two possibilities. First, Longstreet goes ahead with an attack,
pobably sliding aroung the SW end of the Union line, with probably
little success due to Union reserves. The other is that Longstreet
falls back, Ths is complicated by the probale actions of the other of
Lee's corp commanders.

NC in the days immediately after Appomattox, found it
extremely difficult to get accommodation. Basically,
no one there wanted to be seen with him.

Doesn't sound like anyone in those parts being eager
to support a guerilla war. You can't &quot;take to the

&gt; &gt; A few harcases might _try_ guerrilla
&gt; &gt; warfare, but it wouldn't last very long.

&gt; &gt; There were large areas of the CSA where
&gt; &gt; over half the population were ex-slaves.

&gt; &gt; There were large areas of the CSA where
&gt; &gt; most of the white population were Unionists.

&gt; &gt; These areas did not overlap.

&gt; Thomas and Debra Goodrich  _The Day Dixie Died_ [1]
&gt; mentions that Jefferson Davis, passing through Western
&gt; NC in the days immediately after Appomattox, found it
&gt; extremely difficult to get accommodation. Basically,
&gt; no one there wanted to be seen with him.

&gt; Doesn't sound like anyone in those parts being eager
&gt; to support a guerilla war. You can't &quot;take to the
&gt; hills&quot; when the hill folks aren't on your side .

&gt; [1] BTW has anyone else read that book and got an
&gt; opinion on its reliability? It seems solidly based on
&gt; the statements of contemporaries, but a lot of it is
&gt; annoyingly &quot;anecdotal&quot; and often not making clear
&gt; whether the things described went on all over the
&gt; South or just in this or that particular spot.

The people of Missouri were not actively volunteering to help either
side during and after the Civil War. The persuasive nature of ten
armed men asking for food and shelter is always underestimated.
Especially when there might just be twelve armed men seeking those ten
coming along the road.

I'd call it major, considering its consequences, but I give you that
he didn't win a battle in that engagement- just forced the
capitulation of a near-defenseless fort.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;He was in joint command with Joe Johnston
&gt;at First Manassas.

And, between the two of them, they managed to exercise no more command
than to shift troops back and forth, winning more by good luck than by
good generalship. Nevertheless, luck is a good quality for a general
to have...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;He commanded the defenses of Charleston in 1863,
&gt;but that was siege warfare. (Boring.)

In which he showed reasonably good generalship and exceptional
engineering skill, but agreed that it wasn't major.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;He commanded around Petersburg in 1864, defeating
&gt;Butler at Drewry's Bluff, and later holding
&gt;Petersburg with a small force till Lee got there.
">

Now, here I have to disagree. Bermuda Hundred and the opening of the
Petersburg siege are very important engagements indeed. Bermuda
Hundred bottled up Butler's army, closed off a definite threat to
Richmond, and most importantly enabled Beauregard to ship off half his
force to reinforce Lee.

As for Petersburg, Beauregard, through bluff and improvisation,
managed to stop a vastly superior Union force from taking Petersburg
until Lee's main army could enter the trenches. It could fairly be
said that Beauregard, through this action, extended the Confederacy's
life by between six to ten months, depending on how swift its collapse
would have been had Richmond fallen in July 1864.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Creditable, but all very secondary.
">

And this- and my own comments- are both beside the point.

Beauregard was a Confederate war hero from First Sumter onwards, in
Confederate eyes. His lack of major battle victories is directly due
to the antipathy between him and Jefferson Davis, who kept assigning
him first to &quot;second in command&quot; posts, then to minor defensive
positions. The public, thanks to the anti-Davis press, was well aware
of this, and cries of &quot;Give us Beauregard&quot; could be held up to the end
of the war, especially in the Western theater.

After the war Beauregard was definitely a celebrated war hero, at
least up to the Louisiana lottery scandal. (Beauregard was not himself
corrupt, but he made the blunder of lending his name to a notoriously
corrupt public lottery. When the scandal broke it spelled the end of
government lotteries in the South for nearly a century- and,
incidentally, of Beauregard's personal reputation.

Not, of course, that his advocacy of freedmen's rights helped it
either...

It all seems to depend on how he reacts on taking over
from Lee. Would he be a Joseph E Johnston or a John B
Hood?

If he fights a defensive war the best way he can, then
things may not be a lot different from OTL. The most
important thing is whether he is more tempted than Lee
to &quot;take to the hills&quot; rather than surrrender, he
seems a sensible character so my guess is he decides
the same way Lee did. Whether his decision gets the
same universal acceptance that Lee's did isn't
absolutely certain, but my impression is that most
Confederates hd &quot;had a bellyful&quot; by 1865 and were
ready to call it a day. [1]

If, OTOH, he feels (like Hood) that offensive action
is the only way, that could &quot;fast forward&quot; thinhgs and
maybe end the war in 1864.

The Wiki article on him has a most curious paragraph
&quot;After the war, Beauregard spoke in favor of civil
rights and voting for the recently freed slaves, an
opinion uncommon among high-ranking Confederates.
Beauregard was a Democrat who worked to end Republican
rule during Reconstruction.&quot;

Is it just me, or do those two statements seem a
little bit hard to reconcile? Were both of them true
at different times, or was Beauregard in some way able
to reconcile them? Or is it just Wiki getting things
wrong? Anyway, if I turn anything up I'll pass it on.

[1] I was interested to read that General Kirby Smith,
in the Trans-Mississippi, wanted to _continue_ the war
after Appomattox, but was frustrated when most of his
men, on learning the news, took matters into their own
hands and lit out for home. It is hard to prove a
negative, but it all sounds to me as if any attempt at
guerilla war would have been abortive and probably
confined to a very few units.
