I'm Dick Sutphen and this text is a version of the talk I delivered at
the World Congress of Professional Hypnotists Convention in Las Vegas,
Nevada. Although this carries a copyright to protect it from unlawful
duplication for sale by other companies, in this case, I invite
individuals to make copies and give them to friends or anyone in a
position to communicate this information.

Although I've been interviewed about the subject on many local and
regional radio and TV talk shows, large-scale mass communication
appears to be blocked, since it could result in suspicion or
investigation of the very media presenting it or the sponsors that
support the media. Some government agencies do not want this
information generally known. Nor do the Born-Again Christian movement,
cults, and many human-potential trainings.

Everything I will relate only exposes the surface of the problem. I
don't know how the misuse of these techniques can be stopped. I don't
think it is possible to legislate against that which often cannot be
detected; and if those who legislate are using these techniques, there
is little hope of affecting laws to govern usage. I do know that the
first step to initiate change is to generate interest. In this case,
that will probably only result from an underground effort.

In talking about this subject, I am talking about my own business. I
know it, and I know how effective it can be. I produce hypnosis and
subliminal tapes and, in some of my seminars, I use conversion tactics
to assist participants to become independent and self-sufficient. But,
anytime I use these techniques, I point out that I am using them, and
those attending have a choice to participate or not. They also know
what the desired result of participation will be.

So, to begin, I want to state the most basic of all facts about
brainwashing: In the entire history of man, no one has ever been
brainwashed and realized, or believed, that he had been brainwashed.
Those who have been brainwashed will usually passionately defend their
manipulators, claiming they have simply been &quot;shown the light&quot; . . .
or have been transformed in miraculous ways.

The Birth of Conversion
CONVERSION is a &quot;nice&quot; word for BRAINWASHING . . . and any study of
brainwashing has to begin with a study of Christian revivalism in
eighteenth century America. Apparently, Jonathan Edwards accidentally
discovered the techniques during a religious crusade in 1735 in
Northampton, Massachusetts. By inducing guilt and acute apprehension
and by increasing the tension, the &quot;sinners&quot; attending his revival
meetings would break down and completely submit. Technically, what
Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe the brain slate
clean so that the mind accepts new programming. The problem was that
the new input was negative. He would tell them, &quot;You're a sinner!
You're destined for hell!&quot;

As a result, one person committed suicide and another attempted
suicide. And the neighbors of the suicidal converts related that they,
too, were affected so deeply that, although they had found &quot;eternal
salvation,&quot; they were obsessed with a diabolical temptation to end
their own lives.

Once a preacher, cult leader, manipulator or authority figure creates
the brain phase to wipe the brain-slate clean, his subjects are wide
open. New input, in the form of suggestion, can be substituted for
their previous ideas. Because Edwards didn't turn his message positive
until the end of the revival, many accepted the negative suggestions
and acted, or desired to act, upon them.

Charles J. Finney was another Christian revivalist who used the same
techniques four years later in mass religious conversions in New York.
The techniques are still being used today by Christian revivalists,
cults, human-potential trainings, some business rallies, and the
United States Armed Services . . . to name just a few.

Let me point out here that I don't think most revivalist preachers
realize or know they are using brainwashing techniques. Edwards simply
stumbled upon a technique that really worked, and others copied it and
have continued to copy it for over two hundred years. And the more
sophisticated our knowledge and technology become, the more effective
the conversion. I feel strongly that this is one of the major reasons
for the increasing rise in Christian fundamentalism, especially the
televised variety, while most of the orthodox religions are declining.

Pavlov &amp; Conditioning
The Christians may have been the first to successfully formulate
brainwashing, but we have to look to Pavlov, the Russian scientist,
for a technical explanation. In the early 1900s, his work with animals
opened the door to further investigations with humans, to discover how
the use of rewards and punishments can &quot;condition&quot; human behavior.
After the revolution in Russia, Lenin was quick to see the potential
of applying Pavlov's research to his own ends.

The ways to achieve conversion (i.e. conditioned acceptance of an idea
or belief) are many and varied, but the usual first step in religious
or political brainwashing is to work on the emotions of an individual
or group until they reach an abnormal level of anger, fear,
excitement, or nervous tension.

The progressive result of this cathartic mental condition is to impair
judgment and increase suggestibility. The more this condition can be
maintained or intensified, the more it compounds. Once catharsis is
reached, the complete mental take-over becomes easier. As the painful
emotions are discharged, the mind is ready to accept new solutions,
especially if they offer safety, rightness and rewards. Existing
mental programming can be replaced with new patterns of thinking and
behavior.

Other often-used physiological weapons to modify normal brain
functions are fasting, radical or high sugar diets, physical
discomforts, regulation of breathing, mantra chanting in meditation,
the disclosure of awesome mysteries, special lighting and sound
effects, programmed response to incense, or intoxicating drugs.

The same results can be obtained in contemporary psychiatric treatment
by electric shock treatments and even by purposely lowering a person's
blood sugar level with insulin injections.

Before I talk about exactly how some of the techniques are applied, I
want to point out that hypnosis and conversion tactics are two
distinctly different things--and that conversion techniques are far
more powerful. However, the two are often mixed . . . with even more
powerful results.

How Revivalist Preachers Work
If you'd like to see a revivalist preacher at work, there are probably
several in your city. Go to the church or hall early and sit in the
rear, about three-quarters of the way back. Most likely repetitive
music will be played while the people come in for the service. A
repetitive beat, ideally ranging from 45 to 72 beats per minute (a
rhythm close to the beat of the human heart), is very hypnotic and can
generate an eyes-open altered state of consciousness in a very high
percentage of people. And, once you are in a relaxed &quot;alpha&quot; state,
you are at least 25 times as suggestible as you would be in alert
&quot;beta&quot; consciousness. The music is probably the same for every
service, or incorporates the same beat, and many of the people will go
into an altered state almost immediately upon entering the sanctuary.
Subconsciously, they recall their state of mind from previous services
and respond according to the post-hypnotic programming.

Watch the people waiting for the service to begin. Many will exhibit
external signs of trance--body relaxation and slightly dilated eyes.
Often, they begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air
while sitting in their chairs. Next, the assistant pastor will
probably come out. He usually speaks with a pretty good &quot;voice roll.&quot;

The Voice Roll Technique
A &quot;voice roll&quot; is a patterned, paced style used by hypnotists when
inducing a trance. It is also used by many lawyers, several of whom
are highly trained hypnotists, when they desire to entrench a point
firmly in the minds of the jurors. A voice roll can sound as if the
speaker were talking to the beat of a metronome or it may sound as
though he were emphasizing every word in a monotonous, patterned
style. The words will usually be delivered at the rate of 45 to 60
beats per minute, maximizing the hypnotic effect.

Now the assistant pastor begins the &quot;build-up&quot; process. He induces an
altered state of consciousness and/or begins to generate the
excitement and the expectations of the audience. Next, a group of
young women in &quot;sweet and pure&quot; chiffon dresses might come out to sing
a song. Gospel songs are great for building excitement and
INVOLVEMENT. In the middle of the song, one of the girls might be
&quot;smitten by the spirit&quot; and fall down or react as if possessed by the
Holy Spirit. This very effectively increases the intensity in the
room. At this point, hypnosis and conversion tactics are being mixed,
i.e. a message is introduced. And the result is the audience's
attention span is now totally focused upon the communication while the
environment becomes more exciting or tense.

Right about this time, when an eyes-open mass-induced alpha mental
state has been achieved, they will usually pass the collection plate
or basket. In the background, a 45-beat-per-minute voice roll from the
assistant preacher might exhort, &quot;Give to God . . . Give to God . . .
Give to God . . .&quot; And the audience does give. God may not get

I remember Dick Sutphen, met him at Celebrity Centre. He was full of
himself then, and he is now.

He's a guru of sorts himself right now. If you want to see a crazy
face- http://www.dicksutphen.com/

An example of his bullshit is below about revivals. I grew up in Texas
and went to a number of different revivals. They are not nearly the
same, the music ALWAYS vary, is NOT hypnotic. Some preachers (in tents)
get worked up but I never saw one that was Elmer Gantry like.

I did, however, meet an Olympic gold medalist who was one of the
speakers, and he was one of the friendliest and most genteel people I'd
ever met. And he didn't look like a frickin warlock like Sutphen does
on that webpage mentioned above.

So if that's you posting Dick, fuck off, your bullshit ain't working.

Sedona, Arizona! Oh, Sedona! If I had the motivation, skill, and - most
importantly - the pathology, to become a guru, Sedona would be my first
five of ten choices of location.

I like Sedona, at least the geographical and geological Sedona.  I and
my wife have had a great deal of enjoyment in Sedona.  Well, up to the
time we come into contact with the grifters like Sutphen and his ilk who
seem to populate every corner office in the town.  These criminals are
doing well, without the overhead of the SO, OSA, Registrars, and all of
the other Hubbardite sticky fingers.

Hey, for a chuckle, go the the vortices of understanding and power and
talk with those who are true believers! They make Scientologists appear
more or less normal.

There surely is no shortage of moneyed fools for the Hubbards and
Sutphens (and his chicky wife) of the world to prey on!  Davie might
open an Ideal Org in Sedona.  It might be the only Ideal Org to make a
clear profit!
