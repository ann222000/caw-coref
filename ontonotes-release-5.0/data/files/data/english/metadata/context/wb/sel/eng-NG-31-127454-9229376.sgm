I was shocked. Indeed. ANd I didn't know they were talking about the
SAME Website that JKRowling herself once claimed to use:

&quot;A book billed as an unofficial encyclopedic companion to the &quot;Harry
Potter&quot; series infringes copyright and attempts to cash in on the
successful brand, author J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. said when they
filed a lawsuit on Wednesday.

The 400-page book -- &quot;The Harry Potter Lexicon&quot; due to be released by
RDR Books on November 28 in the United States -- had inappropriately
referenced Rowling's fictional characters and universe, Rowling and
Warner Bros. said.

RDR Books said the author of the reference book, Steve Vander Ark, based
it on his fan Web site, www.hp-lexicon.org , that was used by 25 million
visitors and had been called &quot;a great site&quot; by Rowling herself.

In a statement on Wednesday, Rowling said even though she loved fan
sites, she hoped to write &quot;the definitive Harry Potter encyclopedia,
which will include all the material that never made it into the novels&quot;
and donate the proceeds to charity.

&quot;I cannot, therefore, approve of 'companion books' or 'encyclopedias'
that seek to pre-empt my definitive Potter reference book for their
authors' own personal gain,&quot; she said. &quot;The losers in such a situation
would be the charities that I hope, eventually, to benefit.&quot;&quot;

&quot;USA Today contains further information including a comment from RDR
books publisher Roger Rappaport, who said the book was a &quot;critical
reference work&quot; and &quot;dismissed any notion that it could compete with any
official encyclopedia written by Rowling.&quot; He also said that Vander Ark
&quot;cannot understand why she wouldn't be supportive now.'

The article also says the suit &quot;doesn't seek action against the Web
version of the Lexicon, but criticizes it for numerous sections that it
said 'regurgitate Ms. Rowling's original creative expression with
minimal additional commentary.'&quot; &quot;

Her action (and Warner's) is more likely to prevent sales.
I know it's already highly likely to prevent me from buying the
damned encyclopedia, if she ever does write it.  Not that I had
very high expectations of it, since she's still incapable of making
any of her follow-up comments make sense.  When she can prove that
she can add 2 and 2 and get 4, I might become interested again.

Her statement sounds like a lawyer wrote it.  Probably one of Warner's
mouthpieces.  Funny nobody sued all the books of speculations, most of
which quoted huge chunks of her novels.  And why is she only now
criticizing the website?  Could it be because now there's no more need
for free advertising?

Warner's is afraid nobody will bother to go to their movies now that
they know the plot.  As usual, they are taking exactly the wrong action.
If anything could cause a backlash that would cause a boycott, this could.

Not having seen the book, I don't know if she has legal grounds, but if
no one is allowed to write a book about a series of copyrighted books,
then MANY of the works of literary criticism would be in violation.  I
suspect that this is a case where money won't win the day.

That is disappointing news.  Warner Brothers is just a bunch of greedy

expect better of JKR.

Wow, for an author who has to date been pretty generous with the online
fandom this is a surprising move.  I'd suspect this may be more down to the
publishers and WB rather than Jo herself but I could be wrong about that.

One thing about this that is questionable is the difference between an
online fansite created for entertainment purposes only and a book produced
for sale which is obviously intended to make the author money, presumably
the 'suits' are looking at this from that point of view.

I'm curious to see how this goes.

Yeah right.

Anyway the thing that different in this case is apparently the
commercial nature of Steve's book. Previous books by fans were
apparently solely for enjoyment, while Steve here is trying to cash in.

Even so I really don't see how a small offering by such a devoted fan
can really compete against Rowling's encyclopaedia if and when it comes
out.

One also wonders if she'd have dared to do this before all the books
were out, just like this business of DD's sexuality.

Nope, being a Harry Potter fan doesn't mean we have to support
charities that she picks out.  I give her money for Harry Potter
books.  It totally breaks my heart when she turns around and gives
money to parents who use the loss of a child as a fundraising event,
but, that is her business.  She has personal issues with Portugal that
blind her to common sense.

Steve has been one of Rowling's fans for a very long time.  He is a
children's reference librarian for Christ's sake, and this is a
natural extension of his primary job.  He has brought so many kids to
Harry, that he is probably personally responsible for more of
Rowling's wealth than any person other than Rowling herself.  the fact
that he waited so long to bring out a print version is testament to
the fact the he is responding to requests, not out to steal from
Rowling and her favorite &quot;charities&quot;.

I keep telling myself she's getting bad legal advice.  Sure, she's got
something valuable to protect, but this contrasts greatly with the IP
commentary many people see in her discussion of goblin made armor and
swords.  We are not renting our books, once they are published, they
are no longer hers.  She gets royalties, not rent.  She is still the
author, but, she no longer is the sole possessor the the product she
made.  The fundamental truth of the business of ideas is that ideas
improve when they go public.  This is because readers aren't simply
consumers of ideas, they are the building blocks that more ideas come
from.  This is easier to see in the sciences, technology, and even
legal professions.  What would lawyers do without their precedents?
That is why so many of these bad IP ideas migrate in from the
entertainment industry where the naive see no problem in having one
individual control a whole raft of popular culture.  The ironic thing,
actually, another ironic thing, the Rowling as Goblin was the first,
is that Rowling borrows so much from previous authors such as Tolkein
and Malory.

Clearly, many of you people are taken advantage of the fact the
Rowling HAS been so supportive of fan work in the past.  With just one
word she could have shut down the vast majority of websites, but she
hasn't.  She is supportive of fan fiction, which she could have easily
had sued over as well.

The difference between those fan books we see in bookstores now and
the Lexicon are very different.  The fan books available now are
critical interpretations, analysis and speculation, none of which
violate copyright laws.  All those books clearly were not written by
JKR and do not take money away from her.  The Lexicon, on the
otherhand, is essentially an abridged version of the encyclopedia JKR
plans to write.  This would be a very clear violation of U.S. and
international copyright laws, as it would be using her works and
writings, and would most likely cut into sales of the official book.
You people are acting like spoiled brats.  She is under no obligation
to even allow the online Lexicon to exist, yet some of you act like it
is your right to use her characters.  It is not.

You are so far off that you aren't even wrong. A reference work to a
work of fiction, while not the kind of thing that is done every day,
is not in violation of copyright. It _can't_ absent mindreading
skills, be &quot;an abridged version of the encyclopedia JKR plans to
write&quot; as the author would have no way of knowing what is going to be
in her encyclopedia beyond the bare bones. Not having seen the online
lexicon, I don't know that some parts of it aren't copywrite
violations but the idea that one cannot put together a reference for a
fictional world is just wrong.

How? Does Steve have access to Rowling's private drafts for the

access to.

This is a subjective matter. Practically _any_ work using Rowling ideas
could be interpreted as violating copyrights. The usual criteria is
whether the work in question is purely for appreciation and enjoyment
of fans or is for personal monetary gain. It's the latter case that
usually has some chance of standing up in a court of law.

Now granted Steve appears to be selling his work, but as others pointed
out, this has been done previously by Mugglenet, Leaky Cauldron etc.
Why didn't Rowling complain then? Why did she wait until the series has
been published to come down with brass knuckles?

Besides I seriously doubt that Steve's book will affect the sales of
Rowling's encyclopaedia when it comes out, just as commercially sold HP
fanfiction is unlikely to affect the sales of the canonical books.

No one has commercially ripped off Rowling and no one, AFAIK, has
planned to do so too. And Rowling keeps getting richer by the day.

Oh, poor charities, I get so sick of Halloween Galas for charity, the

Lawsuits can be free advertising, but not if the fans take the other
side.  Steve looks like the victim here, not Jo.

Drawing the line between fair use and infringement is tricky, and the
lawyers are paid to defend her rights, any use  they don't defend
becomes &quot;fair use&quot;, so this is what they do.  It is up to Jo to take
their advice until such time as she thinks it through herself and
chooses to draw the line somewhere.  Until then, they need to draw the
line as aggressively as they can.  But, the smart thing to do is let
them be aggressive, be very careful about reading statements written
by lawyers, make sure that the lawyers look like the bad guys, not Jo,
etc.  She's been in the business long enough to know this, so what I'm
saying may simply be for the benefit of the fans.   After all, the
goblins work for her, safeguarding her property with dragons, but, she
can at any time open the vault.

JKR has been MORE than generous with those who have been fans of the
books. However - this is still a business. JKR has already publicly
stated her intension to publish a Harry Potter Encyclopedia of sorts -
with proceeds going to charity. The lexicon has no right to use the
characters and plot lines for any reason without JKR's permission - or
license.  THe lexicon has crossed the line from a fan based FREE
endeavor to a business entity trying to make money off of JKR's
copyrighted possessions. That would create a precedent that infringes
not only on JKR but probably also Warner Bros - and the Publishing
houses. Based on her contracts with the Companies that have bought the
rights to her characters for various reasons - she probably has no

Then why Emmerson has not been sued because of his book? Or Galadriel
Waters? They use HER characters and make money of them: &quot;In 2006, in
advance of the arrival of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, five
MuggleNet staff members co-authored the reference book Mugglenet.Com's
What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7: Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Falls in
Love and How Will the Adventure Finally End, a published collection of
unofficial fan predictions. The book included the controversial (but, as
it turned out, correct) theory of Harry Potter being a Horcrux.

As of July 21, 2007, What Will Happen sold 335,000 copies, totaling $5
million in sales, $2 million of which went to Ulysses Press of South
Berkeley, California. [10]Spartz and his co-authors launched an
aggressive marketing campaign in June 2007 to promote their work. [11]
Authors of the best-selling book are Emerson Spartz, Ben Schoen, Andy
Gordon, Gretchen Stull, and Jamie Lawrence.&quot;

Mugglenet itself is commercial, they have ads on the site and this is a
quote by Emmerson: &quot;I plan to use the _significant amount of money I
have earned through my e-business, MuggleNet.com_ , as investment
capital, as both an entrepreneur and an investor.&quot; They used to sell
merchandising and they only stopped when WB told him to do it.

And Emerson has Fanfiction in mugglenet, which is a very important part
of the site. He might not be writing it BUT he allows it to be written
in HIS site and he makes indirectly profit of it.

So, why is the difference between Emerson and Steven?

Unfortunately, that involves coming down like a ton of bricks on what

Copyright is copyright.  The HP Lexicon people are trying to make money

Yeah, that's what happens when you use lawyers to communicate.  They
tend to sound harsh, no initial politeness.  They do prefer to settle
out of court, that's why they like to sound so scarey, but it's a
shame.  I can't blame Rowing for hiding behind her lawyers, she really
can't be expected to negotiate all this stuff herself.  I might have
to reready that timeline, but it seems lawyers were emailing Steve,
and rather than responding personally, he refered them to his
publisher.  So, there was no contact between Steve and Jo, not that
there must be, but lawyers do get confrontational much faster than
&quot;normal&quot; people.

She can sue anyone who infringe on her copyright, that is her right.
But having to right to do something doesn't necessarily mean it is right
to do it.  She comes across as mean bitch and nasty to people who have

&gt; Then why Emmerson has not been sued because of his book? Or Galadriel

The book is a collection of unofficial fan predictions - it never
presents itself as true - nor was it something JKR planned to produce.
&quot;What will happen&quot; is really a news story expanded - with SPECULATION
about the books. While the USE of the characters are not public domain -
the stories and characters are a news story - much like a politician or
a movie star is.

Mugglenet stopped selling merchandise based on WB's contract with JKR -
which gave them the right to those profits.

While all fanfiction, based on the use of the characters, infringes - it
is non-commercial - not sold for profit - and most important - does not
represent itself as &quot;real&quot;(At least in the scheme of Harry Potter). This
new book would represent itself as an authority on the subject - which
is NOT TRUE - as well as being something that JKR has already stated
publicly that she would produce for the series.

AS far as the time line - there is no question that it belongs to JKR -
she wrote the books. THe timeline from Mugglenet is derived from the
books - they have no inside information to develop it otherwise.

This is not just Rowling hiding behind her characters - that is too
simplistic. There are lots of contracts involved here - with publishers
- with WG - and others.

AS far as contact between Steve and JKR, a good lawyer would not want
that to happen - since  JKR might say something that could be wrong -
from a legal standpoint.

Sorry - but it does indeed mean that it is right to do it. If it was
wrong - she would be unable to sue.

AS far as your next statement - what YOU think is right has nothing to
do with it - there are lots of laws that some people think are wrong -
and others think are right. AS long as they are law - they are right. If
you do not think so - then get the law changed.

Only the simple minded who don't understand that this is a BUSINESS -
not a friendship - would say that. In business - what you do and say can
set a precedent. By not protecting her intellectual rights now - she
could jeopardize them in the future.

More important to me - no one mentions the fact that she was not asked
permission to use the copyrighted material. She was not given the option
of granting the use - this is after the fact. The law works the way it
works - she now has little choice.

&gt;quote by Emmerson: &quot;I plan to use the _significant amount of money I
&gt;have earned through my e-business, MuggleNet.com_ , as investment
&gt;capital, as both an entrepreneur and an investor.&quot; They used to sell
&gt;merchandising and they only stopped when WB told him to do it.

&gt;And Emerson has Fanfiction in mugglenet, which is a very important part
&gt;of the site. He might not be writing it BUT he allows it to be written
&gt;in HIS site and he makes indirectly profit of it.

&gt;So, why is the difference between Emerson and Steven?

Nope.  The law covers all kinds of areas so it can mediate or punish

Yup.  It is a business, and she comes across not as a person, but a

It also occurs to me that JKR, or more likely her lawyers, have
concluded that allowing any non-JKR person to write more HP material
will lead to a loss of control over the product.

One idiot could put crazy ideas into their work, call it a part of her
universe, and splatter her with the Dungbomb he'd set off.  It could be
ideas diametrically opposed to hers, or ideas that are towards her end
of the spectrum, but taken to an extreme that she does not agree with.

The only real way to prevent this is to be very assertive in the realm
of artistic control, and as much as we may not like it, it does mean
coming down like a heap of anvils on the people who toe the line too much.

Part of the problem is the tendency of some people to regard the truth
as always existing between the two opposing viewpoints, and failing to
recognize that sometimes, yes, the one party is 100% right and the other
guy is 100% wrong; as a response, people are so accustomed to being
forced into a compromise (one that robs them of what is legitimately
theirs), and so in order to actually keep what's rightfully theirs (or
get it back), they have to overstate their case.

Hence the current legal climate.

But their whole argument, as I understand it, is that the Lexicon is
*not* adding any original content. And since they are not adding
anything, they are simply using JKR's characters for profit.

But the real issue is that the publisher doesn't want The HP
Encyclopedia to have to compete with the Lexicon. Understandable. But

No - justice lies with the original author - and that is JKR.

The Lexicon has no right to use JKR's characters or stories.

Regardless of what the law says - the Lexicon cannot claim High ground.
They never ASKED JKR for the the ability to use the her copyrighted
works. Regardless of the law - THAT would have been the appropriate
thing to do. They didn't do it. That is the equivalent of your neighbor

You do not have to have permission for fair use.  You do not have to
hand over a preview copy for fair use.  In reality, authors frequently
do run their ideas past each other, but they aren't required to.  The
whole idea of permissions and previews is to avoid lawsuits of this
sort.

This is not a pleasant subject.  Steve has contributed a lot to fandom
and their wouldn't be a fandom at all without Jo.  I hate to see these
two communicating through lawyers.  But, we are not a jury and none of
us has seen evidence allowing for us to decide who is right.  So, I''m
not comfortable with speculatons.

But, apparently, WB and Little lawyers haven't seen the book either
and they are assuming the worst case scenario.  It could be that the
book is very warm to Rowling and doesn't encroach on her domain at
all.  But, if that's the case, why not hand over a copy?  That is the
logic behind the lawsuit.

&gt; &gt; forced into a compromise (one that robs them of what is legitimately
&gt; &gt; theirs), and so in order to actually keep what's rightfully theirs (or
&gt; &gt; get it back), they have to overstate their case.

&gt; &gt; Hence the current legal climate.

&gt; But their whole argument, as I understand it, is that the Lexicon is
&gt; *not* adding any original content. And since they are not adding
&gt; anything, they are simply using JKR's characters for profit.

&gt; But the real issue is that the publisher doesn't want The HP
&gt; Encyclopedia to have to compete with the Lexicon. Understandable. But
&gt; their plight hardly moves me to tears. I think justice lies on the
&gt; side of the Lexicon, whatever the law may say.

You are wrong. JKR's characters are hers and hers alone and she is
entitled to use them, sell the rights to them and to stop those without
those rights from using them.

This person who has decided to take her work, without permission, and
use it for profit is so in the wrong there can be no defence to their
behaviour. It is little short of theft.
