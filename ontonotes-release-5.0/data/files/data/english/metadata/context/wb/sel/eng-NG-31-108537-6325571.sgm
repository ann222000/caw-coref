The expression "random walk" has a special meaning for statisticians.  I'd
like to speak of it in a more general way.

What if we were to take a three dimensional game court and divide it into a
3-D grid of, say, a hundred billion little cubicles (none would be a perfect
cube, as each would be expanded in direction away from center, to avoid
leaving any unfilled spaces.  And let us agree on a little rule, that no
more than one pixel could migrate into any one cubicle, EXCEPT that in the
center cubicle we begin with 8 game pieces, one the color of each of the die
(singular of dice) we will mention momentarily.

In betwixt the frontal, sagital and horizontal planes we would have eight
subdivisions.  Let there be no negative value of any cubicle, but merely
something fundamentally different from the cubicle directly opposite it.
Let each subdivision be a large class of critters; and let any cubicle
represent a different species from another if there are, let us say, 12
cubicles separating them.

We could have nine die (singular for dice), colored red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, white, black and ivory.  (You thought I was going to say indigo
and violet somewhere in there, didn't you :&gt;)?.  And there would be a game
piece to match each differently colored (or shaded) die EXCEPT the ivory
one.

Each "move" of a colored game piece represents one MUTATION.  And the object
of the game is to see just how far apart from one another the pieces get as
the game progresses, and which of the eight quadrants the pieces end up
in... just to get an idea what kinds of constellations of game pieces we
get, representing random mutations (within constraints of the rules we set
up).

The first move consists in our throwing the colored die (holding back the
ivory one).  Each game piece can move only to an adjacent cubicle and, we
know that each cubicle -- having six sides -- is adjacent to exactly six
neighboring cubicles.  Each direction to a neighbor is represented by a
number from one... to ...six (we would have to assign each of the axes a
number, such that, for example, the north pole would be one, the south pole
two, the east pole three, the west pole four... etc.  Hence, the number
rolled would tell us which direction to move the game piece.

What is the ivory die for?  Well if two pieces try to occupy the same
cubicle in a single move, then the ivory die is case once for each of the
two game pieces, to determine which get to move into that cubicle.  In case
of a tie, the ivory die is rolled for each of the two "competing" game
pieces again, and the same again if necessary, until two different numbers
are rolled for the two "competing" game pieces, at which time the one
getting the larger number of the two on the ivory die gets to take the
cubicle being competed over.

(Now obviously this is GROSSLY less complex than a real life situation.   We
just want to see how far we get with randomized mutational directions.  If
it were a real world situation we would have to allow for reproduction,
predation, starvation ...etc.  But we just want to see what randomization
does.)

In this little game, a piece can move right back to a cubicle it has
occupied previously.  Statistically all the pieces could end up going
outward and outward and outward or could all end up competing for the center
of the spherical game world.  More likely, however, they would zig and zag
all over the place.

What do you suppose would be the most likely patterning of the game pieces
after, say, 1,000 moves?

Would at least one of the game pieces move in a fairly straight line by the
shortest possible route to the outer limit of the sphere?  Not very likely,
is it?

We might want to simplify the game even further, by doing it on a flat game
board, using squares.

Modifications are needed to make the "competition" more meaningful, aren't
they?

Without that, it seems that there would not be much "change" in the sense of
getting more and more complex (as represented in moving out toward the outer
limits of the game board.

How might something similar to "natural selection" be introduced into this
game?

Could it be improved until it provides anything even remotely resembling
what may have happened in the history of living things on Earth?

Any suggestions?

ADDENDUM:

Sorry I failed to mention that the 3-D game court is SPHERICAL, and all game
pieces start from "origin" which is center of sphere.  The dimensions of
this "origin" would be zero so, until the first move, the game pieces would
not even be in the game.

The "expanded away from center" shape of each cubicle applies because of the
3-D game court's being spherical and, hence, the lines of the "cubicles" are
radiating outward, and getting farther apart.  The cubicles' concentric
sides are not flat, but rounded.  But, for all practicle purposes, each
cubicle is just a "place" for a game piece to end up, after any given move.

Why a spherical game court?  We would want to give a game piece approaching
an outer boundary of the sphere an equal chance, and not have one gain any
advantage by heading for a corner, which would occur if the game court were
a large cube (rendering all cubicles inside it perfect cubes).

Well, if the boundaries are far enough away, they will approximately
have a 3D normal distribution: proof from central limit theorem.

If the boundaries are close enough, it will be a bit different, but
exactly what happens depends on the type of boundary.

Isn't that what Gavrilets is doing (I really ought to read his book!)?
Certainly, with no selection, what will happen is obvious from the
theories of stochastic processes, but is also the obvious place to start
building the theory from.  With selection, the shape of the fitness
landscape is probably more important.

There are certainly models for this sort of evolution, on phylogenetic
trees.  I can do no better than suggest that you read the chapter in
Felsenstein's Inferring Phylogenies on Brownian motion on trees (round
here we have to promote his book.  :-)).

Er...  If there are nine of them, why do you use the singular 'die'?  Does
it have something to do with the reason you only supplied 8 colors?

Quite right.  When I visualize something like that, am much inclined to make
errors in simple arithmatic.  Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, PURPLE,
black, white, and ivory would make nine.  And purple is more easily imagined
by many that indigo and violet... which I find hard to distinguish from one
another unless they are side by side.

The actual number of game pieces is not critical.  In fact more would (as I
intuit only) just result in a better "sampling" of clusters.

If I gave you the impression I was trying to come up with a new theory, I
really, really blew it.  My purpose was to convey to you and others that
random mutations would tend to move progeny around RANDOMLY, and I was (and
am) desiring input from others far more knowledgeable than I) as to how in
hell it could provide, as it were, the WHATEVER upon which "natural
selection" could EXERCISE  ITS  ALLEGED  POWER to make sense out of
nonsense.

If anybody has worked out a theory of how natural selection has PERFORMED
its selection at the genetic, cellular and molecular level, then I shall
want to read it, after I have finished about forty others that lie waiting.
However, if they have formed any theory based on nothing other than  POST
HOC  analysis of paleontological evidence, then that is not going to tell me
ANYTHING that I want to know.

The intuitive problems I have with NSDI (natural selection did it) are AT
LEAST as meaningless to me as those based upon GDI (Gd did it)... by which I
mean that neither, so far as I know, has done more than take some
before-and-after snapshots, as it were, and given a name to something NOBODY
YET  UNDERSTANDS  whereby something occurred IN  BETWEEN.

If I am not making this clear, then mark it down to naivete.  However, I
know of no theory that more than GUESSES as to any details of what happens
whereby any viable life form evolves, rather than mutates in ways totally
out of control.  Or, to put it another way, it just seems to this old fart
that natural selection could not make a super bowl winning team (a viable
species) if it has nothing but a hit or miss chance of getting enough USEFUL
mutations to work with, when the statistical odds of any given mutation's
being other than deleterious is enormously rare.

There just has to be more to it, I think.  And that "something" needs to
take into account how all the little interim increments click into place.

Having taken quite a few university credits in accounting, I tend to think
that any business... be it a mom and pop shop or a mega-corporation, has to
account for the way transactions interplay between the beginning and the end
of a fiscal period.  A chart of accounts, acted upon by, say, the standard
procedures in force by the AICPA, fairly well dictates how money FLOWS
through hundred, thousands, millions... of interim transactions.

I feel that change (including speciation) has to occur in accordance with
some genetic, intra-cellular, inter-cellular and molecular "transactions"
that are not yet known.

It does NOT satisfy me for someone to simply deomonstrate that change
occurs, and to say "NSID" (i.e., natural selection did it).

But, as always, I bow to your superior knowledge to mine.  Maybe you have it
all figured out, already.

Bob, I have not read Gavrilets.

Please understand that I am a layman who gets strong intuitive feelings that
there are flys in some ointments, involving not mathematics but the nature
of the mechanism whereby what is called "natural selection" physiologically
does its things.  Spookily often, such intuitions of mine turn out to have
some actual basis ultimately, if I pursue and learn enough to confirm that.

My current intuition (which could be totally wrong) is that there are
numberous assumptions made by biologists and paleontologits on basis of a
simplistic view of "natural selection" which has never (so far) been borne
out at the DNA level.  The details are BEGINNING to be mapped, which is
wonderful; but molecular biology impresses me as being in its infancy.

Perhaps you would be willing to help me get an accurate picture in my mind
of how distribution of mutations would radiate over time
in a spherical grid.  The picture I intuit would tend to be ratable, that is
to simply expand out into the sphere fairly equably in all directions.

On the other hand, what little I have understood clearly from reading about
mutations indicates to me that most mutations, by far, are
deleterious.

Follow my reasoning here, and correct me if you can... but I envision a lot
of mutations *RANDOM  IN  MORPHOLOGICAL  IMPACT, AS  WELL IN CAPABILITY  OF
SUCCESS vs FAILURE  POTENTIAL" to be enormously unlikely to produce lines of
genetic change that lead anywhere in particular.

Let me pick the example of the evolution into contemporary horses from a
dog-like creature.  It is a popular misconception  (I have read) that the
progression was a linear one or a smooth one.)  The illusion it might have
been so is nothing more than what I might (with a weak attempt at humor)
term "paleontological  selection," i.e., selection of specimins to connect
the dots, as it were, from a quadripedally five-toed, dog-like creature to a
creature with one toe contacting the ground, and running only on the toe
nail of that... which we call a "hoof."  Actually (I have read) there were
many other variations and branchings off in the process which were somewhat
random... and which failed.  To this extent, random mutation and the
possibility *realized* of four hooves do seem to have followed a course of
*PASSIVE* trials of different things MOST of which did not work.

Okay, but what I intuit to be a fly in the ointment of a clear random
distribution of mutations, selected for by various natural factors (not
merely survival of the fleetist of foot but, also, survival as "screened" by
an enormous number of other factors... predation, disease, not having the
area one had to run on cut off from a main continental shelf and sink below
sea level, and at least a hundred more...

.... is that if most mutations are deleterious... then what are the odds that
anything -- even POST  HOC capable of appearing to be linear or ratable over
time -- occur *AT  ALL* ?

For one thing, if a creature were experiencing *RANDOM  MUTATIONS*,  then it
is unlikely that it would have progressed from five toes being used on each
foot, to three in back and four in front, etc., etc., etc., to a hoof.
Random would not be simply foot mutations.  It would be mutations ANYWHERE
in the morphology of descendants.  How could so many *RANDOM* mutations have
a focus on the feet?

Now, mind you, I am not saying they COULDN'T.  My point is to say that the
statistical odds would seem to me to be enormously against it.  Yet the
horse's overall conformation (among those progressing to hooves, at least,
did not change that drastically generally over the entire morphology of the
horse.  A *RANDOM* mutation, even if it is not linear, would have had to
have a *FOCUS* upon a given body part, it would seem, for something to
progress even in the one line of progressions out of many which disappeared,
leaving the one we now know as having the characteristics of "horseness."

My intuition tells me there had to have been something more going on than
*RANDOM* mutations and *selection by external influences, only*.  (And rest
assured I am not even THINKING about any GDI (Gd did it) scenario any MORE
than I am thinking about any NSDI (natural selection did it) scenario.
NEITHER fills in the blanks as to what mechanisms, in detail, enabled a
sufficient number of
*FOCUSED* mutations and *FOC8UED* selection events even to enable the
development of one or more four-hoofed species.

What I am inclined to intuit is that there has to have been some "feedback"
impact (not... repeat... not of a Lamarckian nature), whereby
the gametic cells received some "positive reinforcement" toward a "focus" on
a particular organ or body part... as opposed to a completely *RANDOMIZED*
mishaps outnumbering fortunate 'haps' to arrive at anything even capable of
APPEARING to have been linear over time.

Now let me ADD to this intuited issue I have with genetic causality (in
absence of SOME kind of feedback to guide the germline cells, the impact of
*PURELY  SOMATIC  DESELECTION*.  (Forgive me for just coining terms for
purposes of making a point.)

In the March issue fo SciAm, I have just read about a kind of cancer that is
rapidly decimating Tasmanian devils.  Research so far has found no virus nor
bacterium as the etiologic agent.  Neither has any genetic predisposition
toward the particular kind of cancer beeen found.  What HAS been found is a
single mutated cell which is short one chromosome.  (If I have read and
understood correctly...) the way some of the abnormal cells are transmitted
from one individual devil to another has to do with the way the Tasmanian
devils fight over food.  They snap at each other furiously, it seems,
nicking one another mostly about the FACE.

Right off the bat, as I read about this, I thought of host vs. graft
rejection, and the question occurred to me, "Why do not the individual
devil's immune systems simply reject any of the abnormal cells transmitted
to them in the saliva of individuals who are developing this
unique kind of cancer?"

Yet no mention is made of this issue in the article.

The Tasmanian devils develop the cancer of the face, and it invariably is
fatal.  Also, no individual (if I have read correctly) is immune.
If we were talking about an etiological agent which is a virus, or a
bacterium, or even a prion... we might expect there to be what is called an
"incubation period."  In the case of the mutated (short-one-chromosome) cell
(which does not seem to be rejected by any individual) it would seem likely
that something equivalent to an incubation period would elapse before a
newly "infected" individual would express symptoms.  No doubt game
biologists in the area have determined this period -- in view of the fact
that they have trapped and then quarantined for a time some 47 individuals
and have (or are planning to) put them on another island for sake of saving
the species from total eventual disappearance.

As you can see, what this situation presents is a way that a deleterious
mutation can SPREAD without impacting the germline cells (OTHER  THAN, of
course, the fact that the origin of the chromosomally deficient cell...
waxed etiological agent... must have occurred in a germline cell).

DESPITE the circumstance that the mutation does not seem to flow via
germline processes (assuming I got this right), it has an even more rapid
spread rate than that would have provided.  (My understanding is that the
game biologists are UNABLE to test an organism and determine whether it has
been "exposed" to this atypical pathogenic cell.)

For all this layman knows, or might guess, this might even be a way that
some of the know one-celled pathogens may have originated over these many
millions of years of biological evolution on Earth.  But... let me
emphasize... it does not seem at all possible to this layman's intuition,
that NS is likely to have operated upon totally *RANDOM* mutations, to
arrive at any "advantaged" species.

This layman's impression is that some individuals seem to think random
mutation with NS is a very simple and obvious process, and that HOW it can
have occurred at the genetic reproduction level is not all that important.
This layman, on the contrary, has a strong gut feeling that microbiology and
molecular biology are bound to discover some INTERNAL signaling whereby germ
cells can get feedback from "successful" selective opportunistic
experiences.

THANKS  AGAIN, Bob.  This old layman is just curious as can be, and sort of
trying to make sense of some things that do not -- based upon anything he
has read and understood so far -- yet contain enough "results" at the
genetic, cellular or molecular levels to MAKE  ANY  ACTUAL  SENSE  of the
mechanism whereby bio-evo-devo has brought Earth life forms to their present
states.

Random mutation, it would seem to me, would not without some internailizable
feedback mechanism(s) quite do the job.

&gt;&gt; exactly what happens depends on the type of boundary.

&gt; (snipped my words to leave, and respond to,  your, Bob)
&gt;&gt; Isn't that what Gavrilets is doing (I really ought to read his book!)?
&gt;&gt; Certainly, with no selection, what will happen is obvious from the
&gt;&gt; theories of stochastic processes, but is also the obvious place to start
&gt;&gt; building the theory from.  With selection, the shape of the fitness
&gt;&gt; landscape is probably more important.

&gt; Bob, I have not read Gavrilets.

&gt; Please understand that I am a layman who gets strong intuitive feelings that
&gt; there are flys in some ointments, involving not mathematics but the nature
&gt; of the mechanism whereby what is called &quot;natural selection&quot; physiologically
&gt; does its things.  Spookily often, such intuitions of mine turn out to have
&gt; some actual basis ultimately, if I pursue and learn enough to confirm that.

&gt; My current intuition (which could be totally wrong) is that there are
&gt; numberous assumptions made by biologists and paleontologits on basis of a
&gt; simplistic view of &quot;natural selection&quot; which has never (so far) been borne
&gt; out at the DNA level.  The details are BEGINNING to be mapped, which is
&gt; wonderful; but molecular biology impresses me as being in its infancy.

&gt; Perhaps you would be willing to help me get an accurate picture in my mind
&gt; of how distribution of mutations would radiate over time
&gt; in a spherical grid.  The picture I intuit would tend to be ratable, that is
&gt; to simply expand out into the sphere fairly equably in all directions.
">

Indeed, that would be true under neutrality, hence my references to 3D
normals: they would imply diffuse through the space.  if you want some
intuition on your model, then look into diffusion and stochastic processes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand, what little I have understood clearly from reading about
&gt; mutations indicates to me that most mutations, by far, are
&gt; deleterious.
">

Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Follow my reasoning here, and correct me if you can... but I envision a lot
&gt; of mutations *RANDOM  IN  MORPHOLOGICAL  IMPACT, AS  WELL IN CAPABILITY  OF
&gt; SUCCESS vs FAILURE  POTENTIAL&quot; to be enormously unlikely to produce lines of
&gt; genetic change that lead anywhere in particular.
">

A lot would just lead to the grave, yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Let me pick the example of the evolution into contemporary horses from a
&gt; dog-like creature.  It is a popular misconception  (I have read) that the
&gt; progression was a linear one or a smooth one.)  The illusion it might have
&gt; been so is nothing more than what I might (with a weak attempt at humor)
&gt; term &quot;paleontological  selection,&quot; i.e., selection of specimins to connect
&gt; the dots, as it were, from a quadripedally five-toed, dog-like creature to a
&gt; creature with one toe contacting the ground, and running only on the toe
&gt; nail of that... which we call a &quot;hoof.&quot;  Actually (I have read) there were
&gt; many other variations and branchings off in the process which were somewhat
&gt; random... and which failed.  To this extent, random mutation and the
&gt; possibility *realized* of four hooves do seem to have followed a course of
&gt; *PASSIVE* trials of different things MOST of which did not work.
">

It's more complex than that: the branches that survived did work
(otherwise they would have died out straight away).  However, they might
have survived less well than others which appeared subsequently, and
hence went extinct due to competition, or the environment changed, and
they survived less well in the new environment.

Note that we're not talking about selection.  Although the initial
mutations may be random, what we see after selection will not be.  The
cloud of mutants diffusing through morphospace will become lumpier, as
there are regions where they are not fit, and others where they are fitter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Okay, but what I intuit to be a fly in the ointment of a clear random
&gt; distribution of mutations, selected for by various natural factors (not
&gt; merely survival of the fleetist of foot but, also, survival as &quot;screened&quot; by
&gt; an enormous number of other factors... predation, disease, not having the
&gt; area one had to run on cut off from a main continental shelf and sink below
&gt; sea level, and at least a hundred more...

&gt; .... is that if most mutations are deleterious... then what are the odds that
&gt; anything -- even POST  HOC capable of appearing to be linear or ratable over
&gt; time -- occur *AT  ALL* ?
">

"Most" is not the same as "all".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For one thing, if a creature were experiencing *RANDOM  MUTATIONS*,  then it
&gt; is unlikely that it would have progressed from five toes being used on each
&gt; foot, to three in back and four in front, etc., etc., etc., to a hoof.
&gt; Random would not be simply foot mutations.  It would be mutations ANYWHERE
&gt; in the morphology of descendants.  How could so many *RANDOM* mutations have
&gt; a focus on the feet?
">

If you play the lottery, it's unlikely that you will win.  BUT that does
not mean that nobody wins the lottery.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, mind you, I am not saying they COULDN'T.  My point is to say that the
&gt; statistical odds would seem to me to be enormously against it.
">

Not if you have enough horses!  The time scales that evolution occurs
over are large, and the populations sizes are much large than one or two
individuals.  I think your problem is caused by not appreciating the
scales that you need to look over: it's not one individual, but many
over a long time.

BOB,

Rest assured that I have NOT  DISMISSED your valuable comments (above).  In
fact, these comments are ENORMOUSLY  appreciated and are this very moment
fermenting away at the back of my thinking on the
matter of my urgent desire MAKE  SENSE  TO  MYSELF of  the issues that
strike me as fallacious about
the legend surrounding natural mutation and natural selection.

Mind you that I am not protesting against the overall necessity of there
having to be a mechanism dynamic for
mutation and selection.

What strikes me as grossly absurd is the fickle, naive, pseudo-scientific
LEGEND whereby evolution has progressed by virtue of a simplistic
"advantagistic pressure" or "advantagistic vacuum," as it were.

THAT it has progressed into species is not at all an issue for me.  What
seems to me totally absurd is the way
many -- if not most -- of those who discuss the subject seem capable of
leaping deftly over HUGE gaps of
HOW one thing let to another and ended up, as it were, first on one side of
an ocean (the absence of a complex trait) right easily over to the other
(the existence of a complex trait) without realizing they are doing so.

To FURTHER delineate this seeming-to-me gross absurdity of logic, I have
attempted to coin a word for it:  *ADVANTAGISM*, and have attempted to break
down the defining of that into some discrete parts.

I have noted that subjects come up for discussion in this forum and simply
get "buried" under clutter of other subjects... which is quite democratic
and proper, in my humble opinion... so, to keep this issue alive, I must
present it in ever-new contexts (vis a vis the message titled
NSAdvantagism), which I sent a moment ago.  PLEASE  READ  THAT  MESSAGE
as -- for a change -- I went back over that one and edited a bit (to keep it
from coming out as gibbered  as the bulk of my rapidly typed and sent
messages).

I believe one of your intelligence knows full well that I have no agenda to
my participation in this forum EXCEPT to bounce my overwhelming curiosity
and efforts to make sense TO  MYSELF of some things that strike me as
being, as it were, an ointment that is more flies than ointment.

I COULD simply write to you directly.  However, I desire more than one
source of feedback, as I attempt to progress toward some clarity of thought,
and ability to articulate that thought... which is interminably TENTATIVE,
and not the work of a closed mind, nor the fuming of a promoter of anything
even remotely akin to an entrenched stance on anything.

What I can make sense of, I communicate; and what I CANNOT make sense of, I
communicate.  Jim's input is valuable to me, too.  Although I cannot help
but wonder how one so well informed could tend to interpret what I am trying
to do as trying to persuade anybody of anything, or create any new model to
offer...  But he provides me
ideas that ADVANCE my thinking, regardless; so I eagerly read for THAT in
his every response to me or to anybody else.  (Also, perhaps, it could be my
own fault that my writing style may provoke Jim.  But, then, if that were
the only way I could elicit one of his responses, then I might even learn to
do it deliberately... (:&gt;)... because of how much I value his informed
rebuttals.

YOUR input makes tons of sense... so PLEASE continue to help where you see
the need or opportunity to do so.

Big thanks.  And now let me settle back into fermentation mode... which MAY
lead to my ordering a copy of that book you cited...

But, bottom line, if only just for now, if nothing else PLEASE  read the
start of the thread titled "NSAdvantagism."
I may need, for example, to draw some clear distinctions between what I
would mean by the term "advantagism" as distinguished from what I would wish
to mean when I use the term "opportunism," and to set very clear
distinctions between what I would wish to mean by THAT, and "opportunity
availance."

Much, much, much ambiguity consists in most any discussion of NS as a direct
result of the incapability (or unwillingness???) of many discussers to
distinguish between opportunity availance" as a passive and hence viable
phenomenon to be found in nature, "opportunism" as a proactive or aggressive
seizing of advantage, of which genes are (or have never been empirically
established otherwise) are INCAPABLE.  (Let me not launch into that here...
else this one message might start to resemble a whole book.)

Would WELCOME input from you (any anyone else) on the definition, pro or
con.

Again, THANK  YOU.  It is flattering to hear from one of your credentials,
anytime, on any subject... but especially on this one.

&lt;more stuff snipped&gt;

Well Gil, we have a lot in common. I'm also an old fart and have, for
a long
time, been sceptical of the type of "Just So" stories that have been
used to
explain the features of organisms. There is a long tradition of
thinking that
there needs to be more than, as you put it: "*RANDOM*" mutations. The
most recent
book touching on this subject, written for the layman, that I know of
is
"Darwin in the Genome", by Lynn Caporale. She has also edited a
collection of papers,
"The Implicit Genome" (2006, Oxford U. Press).

The idea in the Darwin in the Genome book is that there are evolved
mechanisms that
generate variability in those features that are most likely to be
undergoing strong
selective pressure. These ideas are somewhat controversial, to say the
least -- especially in their more extreme forms. Anyway, you might
find some stimulating food for thought in
that book.

Also, you were right on target when you said that we don't know how
mutational changes
produce the kinds of characters that paleontologists study. The study
of that is in
its infancy, but shows great promise. Where there is more known (but
probably not to
your _complete_ satisfaction) is in the evolution of molecular
characteristics of things
like influenza and HIV viruses. Because there is a shorter path
between the genes and
the molecular characteristics they control it is a lot easier to
convince oneself that
natural selection shapes viral evolution.
