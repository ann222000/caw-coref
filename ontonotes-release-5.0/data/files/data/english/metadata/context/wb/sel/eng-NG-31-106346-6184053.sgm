The whole funeral industry is absurd for many people.  Why throw
thousands of dollars into a hole in the ground, when that money could
be important to those who are still living.

It is silly to put an expensive wooden or metal box into the hole. The
body is SUPPOSED to decompose. It is pointless to try to 'protect' it.
Even putting a burial suit on the body is a waste, as long as you
avoid an open-casket funeral.

When I go, they can put me in a big, biodegradable trash bag. I can
wear a cheap T-Shirt and skivvies, just for modesty's sake. Total
cost: a few hundred dollars, including the plot, the labor of the
gravedigger, the biodegradable bag, a couple of days of cold storage,
the hearse, and the minister. No embalming is necessary, if they get
me into the ground soon enough. If they use a wooden grave marker,
then the marker will decompose around the same time that the body
does. Then, the plot will be available for the next person.

Anything beyond that is for the benefit of the surviving family and
friends, and they can spend the insurance money any way they like.

Mourners?  Who needs 'em?

I totally agree, I want to be cremated in whatever I'm wearing when I
die. Told my wife have my ashes put in a small cardboard box and she
intends to spread my ashes on the Gulf of Mexico. I've already made the
deal with a local crematorium and paid the fees. All they've got to do
is throw me in the back of the pickup and haul me down there. If the
family and friends want a memorial service they can do it in my fruit
orchard. Why poop away money on dead meat. Either that or they can hire
Bob's Professional Mourners. &lt;VBG&gt;

I didn't know that professional mourners had disappeared.
I thought you could find someone to do just about anything

If you want to go with a themed funeral, I think it would

I remember years ago, seeing a funeral procession, with a brass
band, and an open limo carrying a big picture of the deceased.
Marching/driving through Chinatown in San Francisco.

I had seen exactly the same deal a few times previously.

There was a break, and I asked one of the musicians what was up.
He said, "Same funeral, different body."

Anyway, I just got an idea for my own funeral.  Instead of a
bunch of self-serving arse-kissers, I could arrange ahead for a
Rent-A-Mob.  They could string my body up on a gallows, chanting,
"Down with the evil dictator!  The years of oppression are over!"
Then machine-gunning my already-cold corpse.

At least it would be more dramatic than the usual funeral.  And
would make it seem like I was important.

Now THAT's creative!  And if the family wanted some sort of permanent
memorial it should be possible to observe when the deceased was passed out
of the animal's digestive tract, collect the deposit and spread it around a
rosebush to nourish the plant and scare away lesser predators.  A new twist
on "zoo poo".

==================================

There is a lot more to traditional Chinese funerals.  You won't see
this in the mainland anymore (and not in SE Asia either as they can
cost the family fortune - the whole point- or the local police no
longer issue the necessary permits).  The wake can last up to a week
with a large  tent set up curbside complete with several round tables
of snacks, mostly copious supply of melon seeds, peanuts, tea and soda
pop.  Vegetarian meals may be served if the deceased is rich.  My
memory fails me but I think in the cool of the evening there was music
provided by a string quartet (oriental instruments and music) deep
into the night. Somewhere a Daoist priest would do the daily  funeral
rituals.

The funeral procession is as you described but far grander with the
equivalent of a man drawn gun carriage this "gun carriage" being a
decorated truck festooned with floral wreaths.  This truck was
symbolically drawn by Chinese (mutual assistance) association members
dressed  in military style uniforms "pulling" on a pair of ropes
attached to the carriage.  The honor guard would be preceded by as
many marching bands and brass gong bands as the deceased's family
could afford.  The funeral cortege would be led a long line of
mourners bawling their eyes out as loud as they could.

To get back to the professional mourners idea this had around for
centuries in Chinese funerals.  That is to give the impression that
the deceased had a large number of relatives who deeeply mourned his
death.  I even learned how they  how they could manage to turn on
their tears on demand.  The trick was to soak a handkerchief with
onion juice.  One wipe and viola, the ducts open up!

Hmm... This claim generates several responses.

1) All coffins eventually leak and fall apart. Is an old corpse better
for the groundwater?

2) What specific laws are you talking about?

3) Dead animals, dog crap and giraffe urine go into the groundwater
all the time (if you have a local zoo). Why aren't we all dead now?

The basic point of all of this is that humans, animals and their
by-products are generally natural substances that have been entering
our groundwater on a regular basis for a very long time. You don't
want a cemetery too close to your well, but if you give a cemetery
enough distance from water supply intakes, decomposing human bodies
pose very little risk to the population.

The time that it takes for a body to break down, the action of some
industrious insects and the filtration capacity of a few dozen tons of
soil do miraculous things to purify groundwater.

some places require you to be buried with a metal liner (the place in nj

Not everywhere. Here's a quote from:

http://www.psats.org/cemeteries.doc

The role of the Pa. Department of Health (DOH) is somewhat narrow in
this subject area. In all cases of human death, there must be a proper
death certificate filed with DOH within 96 hours of death (except when
the coroner is still investigating the cause of death). [35 P.S.
450.501.] The body cannot be disposed of until DOH, through a local
registrar, issues a burial (disposition) permit. [35 P.S. 450.504.] The
death certificate and the burial (disposition) permit should indicate
the location of the burial or final disposition, with at least with the
name of the cemetery (as opposed to the exact location within the
cemetery) or the address of the private property in the case of a "home"
burial...

The burial, regardless of whether in an established cemetery, the
backyard, or the family farm, must comply with the state depth-of-grave
requirements. If there is an outer case around the coffin, the uppermost
part of the outer case must be deeper than 1.5 feet from the natural
surface. [28 Pa. Code 1.21(a).] If there is not an outer case, and
there is just a coffin or just the body with no coffin, then the item
buried must be deeper than 2 feet from the natural surface of the ground
[28 Pa. Code 1.21(b).]...

If the death was not from a contagious disease, no state law requires
a casket or a vault. Most cemeteries on their own do require a vault,
and most cemeteries dig the grave deeper than DOH regulations. There are
numerous reasons for this. If the cemetery uses heavy machinery to dig
graves or cut grass, etc., a vault will keep the machinery from damaging
the remains. Also as time passes, the remains and wooden coffins
disintegrate, which will cause the ground above the grave to sink such
that there will be a large depression in the ground. Also, by reason of
our geographic location, the ground in Pa. freezes and unfreezes several
times throughout the winter season. This tends to push anything in the
ground up towards the ground surface. A vault will also protect the
remains from scavenging animals. Depending on soil conditions and flood
plains the remains could also work their way to surface. During the 1972
hurricane and resulting floods in Pa., coffins floated down the
Susquehanna River. A vault tends to hold everything in place.

In the case of a body not dead of a contagious disease, burial is to
occur within 24 hours of death. Otherwise the body must be embalmed or
placed in a hermetically sealed container. [28 Pa. Code 1.23(a).] The
Pa. Department of State’s Board of Funeral Directors has a similar
regulation (funeral directors may also use refrigeration under strict
legal standards for bodies not disposed of within 24 hours of death).
[49 Pa. Code 13.201(6).]

Nothing in state law requires a family to use a funeral director.
However, a funeral director is licensed by the state, is generally
insured, is generally knowledgeable about the various laws regarding
dead bodies, and knows how to handle dead bodies so as to prevent the
spread of disease, especially when the body is dead of a contagious
disease. If the family does not engage a funeral director, the family is
responsible for complying with all laws and for any problems if the
family's handling of the body causes any harm to neighbors or others...

In the case of a death in an hospital, and the family does not use a
funeral director but wishes to remove the body through a family member,
DOH will advise the hospital not to release the body until the family
files the death certificate with a local registrar and returns to the
hospital with the burial (disposition) permit in hand as evidence of the
family's having filed the death certificate. This assumes the body is
not dead of a contagious disease. If the body is dead of a contagious
disease, the Department likely would advise the hospital as a matter of
public health to not release the body to anyone but a licensed funeral
director.

If the body is dead of a contagious disease, current law would require
the person handling the body to embalm and disinfect it. [28 Pa. Code
27.203]  Bear in mind, there are some disease organisms that will not
survive long once the body loses heat.  In other cases there are disease
organisms that could survive hours or days without body heat before
losing the ability to spread the disease. In yet other cases there are a
few disease organisms that can survive decades in the remains and the
soil surrounding the remains and still maintain their potency and
potential risk. I note also that there is at least one disease organism
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which is the human version of mad cow
disease) that is probably able to survive the heat of cremation and live
on in the remaining ashes and pose a risk to anyone who might happen to
come in contact with the cremated remains...

The Cemetery Law at 9 P.S. 10 (Pollution of water by use of land for
burial purposes prohibited) provides as follows:

It is unlawful to use for the burial of the dead any land the drainage
from which passes into any stream furnishing the whole or any portion of
the water supply of any city, except beyond the distance of one mile
from such city: Provided, however, That the prohibitions of this act
shall not be enforceable against any land now devoted to burial purposes
in which there shall have heretofore been burials and sales of burial lots.

Bear in mind this statute dates to 1895 and is not a statute under the
jurisdiction of DOH. Also bear in mind the water supply for many
Pennsylvanians consists of well water. In regard to a "backyard" burial,
the family wants to make certain the burial does not affect the family's
water supply or that of a neighbor. The only suggestion here is to check
with the local sewage enforcement office as to the distance a septic
system must be from a well and apply similar distance between the well
and the gravesite.

I like the Swedish option.  Instant freeze the body in liquid air.
This makes the body very brittle and can be ground up into itsy bitsy
pieces very easily.  It becomes protein powder to be disposed of.

Now have you considered 'burial at sea'? It can get involved, too. Mary

According to http://www.health.state.ny.us/professionals/funeral_director/diseases...

So somebody could take a huge hammer and whack it?  Smashing it
