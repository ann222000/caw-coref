I apologize in advance if this issue has been addressed elsewhere in this
group, already.

After eBay's Adword's tiff with Google over Google's &quot;Google checkout
party&quot;. Has anybody else seen their eBay sales volume affected dramatically
as ours has been?

Since eBay pulled the plug on all adwords, our business fell off (slowly,
but surely) by 35% or so. We have an eBay store and sales have been
remarkably consistent (in fact, mostly, steadily rising) for the last year
or so.

eBay says they buried the hatchet with Google but they have also mystically
said that they aren't going to use adwords as pervasively, or, words to that
affect.

What I do know is that our eBay business has yet to recover since the eBay's
temper tantrum.

Can anybody else weigh in on this?

I am sure not happy about eBay's actions and it's effects on THEIR customers
like you and me. Did they not take this into consideration? Hard to think
they couldn't or didn't. Is proving a point worth the degradation of their
clientele's business?

If anything my Ebay business has literally gone through the roof in the last
6 weeks. Almost to an extent that I am having trouble coping and have had to
cut back on my Buy Now listings and just stick to normal auctions such was
the amount of people taking up my Buy Now prices that I struggled to cope
with the additonal buisness they suddenly started generating..

Thanks for weighing in, Neil.

Your monthly feedback score bears out your assertion as well.

Your feedback score is astounding for someone with only 91 items in their
store. Our store:

http://stores.ebay.com/N-State-Packaging

Before the pissing contest, our monthly feedback score was pretty
consistently in the 375 range.

I have 4 full time employees that deal with our eBay store(s), (this is not
our only store), and, I may have to lay one of them off Â as a result of this
nonsense, which pains me a great deal.

I am not a happy camper. Glad that this did not have a deleterious effect on
YOUR business like it has ours.
