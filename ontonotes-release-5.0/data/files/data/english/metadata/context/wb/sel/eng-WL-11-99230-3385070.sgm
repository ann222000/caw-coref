A new post from Riverbend , always worth reading but on this occasion especially saddening. What a tremendous improvement we have wrought in the lives of the Iraqis to make up for bombing them to bits.

That Muqtada can be such a clown as not to have noticed that actually football is quite popular in the West, and hasn't been abandoned to the Arabs (who last won the World Cup in, er..., er...) would be funny if he wasn't one of the Great Improvements On Saddam. And if he imagines that Israelis are uninterested in football, might I suggest that he decks himself in the colours of Hapoel and sit at the Maccabi end in a Tel Aviv derby. I can assure him that his being an Arab would be of no interest whatsoever to the Maccabi supporters, who would cheerfully eviscerate him even if he were a ringletted rabbi in a big black hat.

Yet in some way handing the government of Iraq over to buffoons like Muqtada is seen by Blair and his apparatchiks as progress. Well, I suppose for Bush and Blair any government based on religion must be better than Saddam's wicked secularism.

If opposition to this arrant hypocrisy debars me from membership of what supporters of the war call the "decent" left (Orwell thou shouldst be living at this time...), then I spit on its decency.
