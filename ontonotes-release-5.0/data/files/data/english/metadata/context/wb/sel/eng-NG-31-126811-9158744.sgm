Language  Body Says Ban Will Fail

Irish language advocates have said they are  confident a
move to stop assembly ministers using Irish will fail.

UUP  MLA David McNarry has tabled a motion seeking to stop
ministers making  addresses in the chamber in Irish.

Janet Muller of Pobal, the umbrella  organisation for Irish
speakers, said there was widespread anger at the  move.

&quot;Demanding Irish speakers cease to use the language in
public is  the language equivalent of telling black people
to sit at the back of the  bus,&quot; she said.

&quot;It can only tarnish the north's image at home and  abroad.&quot;

She said banning Irish would set the institutions outside
of  the other devolved assemblies in the British Isles and
the government of the  Republic of Ireland.

Mr McNarry said there was plenty of recognition  already for
the language. His motion also opposes proposed legislation
for  an Irish Language Act.

Loyalist  Warning On UDA Arms Move

The deadline for decommissioning of Ulster  Defence
Association weapons could derail the peace process, a
loyalist  spokesman has claimed.

The 60-day deadline set by Social Development  Minister
Margaret Ritchie for the beginning of UDA arms
decommissioning  expires on Tuesday.

Frankie Gallagher, of the Ulster Political Research  Group,
said her move could lead to a &quot;disastrous place&quot;.

Margaret  Ritchie has admitted she has come under pressure
to  compromise.

Pressure on her came after it emerged the UDA had  begun
&quot;meaningful engagement&quot; with the body that  oversees
decommissioning.

Weapons

The minister said the final  decision on whether to redirect
œ1.2m from the Conflict Transformation  Initiative to other
loyalist projects was hers.

The UDA, however, said  it was adhering to its own timetable
for getting rid of its weapons, despite  Tuesday's deadline.

Speaking on BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme,  Frankie
Gallagher from the UPRG, which advises the UDA, said the
timing  should not be dictated.

&quot;People have gone an extra mile,&quot; he  said.

&quot;Everybody is trying to double their efforts to maintain
the  peace process and if this derails the peace process
because a minister  connects social need with
decommissioning, then we are in a disastrous  place.&quot;

NI Secretary Shaun Woodward said the paramilitaries had
begun  &quot;meaningful&quot; talks with the decommissioning body.

The funding was  intended to help move the UDA away from
violence.

Flynn's  Court Battle With RTE To Come To End Today

08/10/2007 -  08:02:14

Independent TD Beverly Flynn should move a step closer  to
re-joining Fianna F il today, with her legal battle against
RTE  expected to be formally struck out in the High Court.

Ms Flynn was  expelled from the party in April 2001 after
losing her infamous libel action  against the state
broadcaster.

She was subsequently ordered to pay  almost ?3m in costs to
RTE, but the two sides agreed a settlement of just  over
?1.2m earlier this year.

The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, has already  indicated that he
would be happy to welcome Ms Flynn back into Fianna F  il
once she had settled her outstanding legal issues.

The party's  general secretary, Sean Dorgan, is due to hold
talks about the matter over  the coming weeks with Fianna
F il members and supporters of Ms Flynn in Co  Mayo.

Opin:  Irish Language Being Used As Political Football

The Thursday Column
By  Jim Gibney

In November 1987 the DUP's Sammy Wilson used the  racist
slur `leprechaun language' to protest against the use of
Irish in  the chamber of Belfast city council.

At the behest of Wilson, the then  lord mayor, backed by
unionist colleagues, it was insisted that a Sinn  Fein
member, M irt¡n O' Muilleoir, should be evicted from the
meeting for  speaking in Irish.

Two weeks ago, this time in the Assembly, Wilson again  led
a cross-party unionist offensive against the Irish language
which was  intemperate, irrational and at times hysterical,
as the Assembly's Hansard  tellingly records.

The 20-year time gap has not mellowed Wilson's  bitter
opposition to the sound of the Irish language being spoken
within  his earshot.

Even those unionists who like to style themselves  as
`liberals' could not resist attacking the Irish language.
