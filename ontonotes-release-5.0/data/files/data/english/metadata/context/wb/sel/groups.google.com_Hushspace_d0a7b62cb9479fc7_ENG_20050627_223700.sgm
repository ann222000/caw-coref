I have to admit to ashamedly not knowing any off-by-heard (my memory is
awful), but just looked these up
from
This is from The Red Fort:
Bloodnok: What's the matter with you this morning, Seagoon? Why have you
got such a long face?
Seagoon: Heavy dentures, sir.
Bloodnok: I see. Well, have you seen a doctor?
Seagoon: Yes, I just saw one walking down the road

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------
And this is probably my favourite bit of Goonery off all-time (I had to
google to get the complete thing):
Episode - What Time Is It Eccles -
Bluebottle What time is it Eccles? Eccles Err, just a minute. I, I've got
it written down 'ere on a piece of paper. A nice man wrote the time down for
me this morning. Bluebottle Ooooh, then why do you carry it around with you
Eccles? Eccles Well, umm, if a anybody asks me the ti-ime, I ca-can show it
to dem. Bluebottle Wait a minute Eccles, my good man... Eccles What is it
fellow? Bluebottle It's writted on this bit of paper, what is eight o'clock,
is writted. Eccles I know that my good fellow. That's right, um, when I
asked the fella to write it down, it was eight o'clock. Bluebottle Well
then. Supposing when somebody asks you the time, it isn't eight o'clock?
Eccles Ah, den I don't show it to dem. Bluebottle Ooohhh... Eccles [Smacks
lips] Yeah. Bluebottle Well how do you know when it's eight o'clock?
Eccles I've
got it written down on a piece of paper! Bluebottle Oh, I wish I could
afford a piece of paper with the time written on. Eccles Oohhhh.
Bluebottle 'Ere
Eccles? Eccles Yah. Bluebottle Let me hold that piece of paper to my ear
would you? - 'Ere. This piece of paper ain't goin'. Eccles What? I've been
sold a forgery! Bluebottle No wonder it stopped at eight o'clock. Eccles Oh
dear. Bluebottle You should get one of them tings my grandad's got. Eccles
Oooohhh? Bluebottle His firm give it to him when he retired. Eccles Oooohhh.
Bluebottle It's one of dem tings what it is that wakes you up at eight
o'clock, boils the kettil, and pours a cuppa tea. Eccles Ohhh yeah! What's
it called? Um. Bluebottle My granma. Eccles Ohh... Ohh, ah wait a minute.
How does she know when it's eight o'clock? Bluebottle She's got it written
down on a piece of paper!

The main reason why their is nothing about &quot;attachment not stored&quot; is that when the show was written computers,never mind attachments were not invented,it would be more of a case of &quot;the wick in the engines gone out,but I know they are a load of thickies and a bloody nuisance but for all you who do not know what it means,NOW_LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY_I WILL SAY THIS ONLY ONCE!,up to about 18 months ago Yahoo used to allow pictures to be stored in messages,then they stopped allowing this and replaced it with message,know one knows what happened to all the pics so now I have tried to explain it DON'T ASK AGAIN,all pics now have to be in the photos are files section but they do seem to be allowing pics to be posted in messages again.

Er......... correct me if I'm wrong, but to my understanding all people
*have* to do is
a) Read the Welcome Page/File
because in there it tells you to
b) Switch to Individual Emails, as that's how most pics are posted to the
group.
c) I apologise if I've got the wrong end of the wrong stick here.

Sorry. Are you saying that Spike Peter Sellers and Michael Bentine didn't
write? That the Python Team didn't write? I know you didn't just say that.
Sellers was notorious for going off-script into his own little world and everyone
just let him get on with it because what he produced was so good. Ronny
Barker wrote sometimes as Gerald Wiley and performed his own material, but he
mostly wrote as part of a team which included Peter Caulfield a pseudonym for
Alan Ayckbourn, who was employed as a BBC radio drama producer at the time and
was not supposed to work elsewhere. While there were acts that performed
writer's work alot of these teams produced their own material either on their own
as part of a team. Even if they did perform other people's writing it
doesn't diminish their comic genius. That is like saying Jeremy Irons is a shit
actor because he doesn't write his own films.

Annoys you? You should try being Jeri and/or Wasteknott.
I agree to a point, but I think the main this is that Jeri &amp; co have got
pretty fed up (and I cleaned that up a bit) of telling people.
I've not been here all that long, and it even bugs me some days.

Totally agree with you Jeri.
And something I didn't know till fairly recently - although I admit I don't
know how true this is - but apparantly Denis Norden (he of It'll Be Alright
On The Night 'fame) used to be a fairly prolific scriptwriter. I've no idea
who he wrote for though (without googling of course).
And I think I'm right in saying that some of the Goon Shows, because they
were aired live, were broadcast as they were, with Sellers - and sometimes
others - going way off script, but nobody could bring him back &quot;on-script&quot;
either - mind you sometimes I don't think they'd want to, and if you listen
to the shows sometimes you can hear the likes of Seagoon (Harry Secombe)
trying to stifle his laughter iin the background ;o)
And slightly off-topic, apparantly Ray Stubbs is one of the main writers
for A Question Of Sport, which surprised me a little, although it obv makes
sense).

Dennis Norden was one of the cornerstones of British comedy writing and his
partnership with Frank Muir is legendary. They were brought together by Ted
Kavanagh in about 1947 I think and over the course of a 30 year partnership
wrote for Python and the Goons The Frost Report greats like Jimmy Edwards and
many episodes of The Peter Ustinov Show. The university of Sussex has an
archive of all their work and is well worth avisit if you are really interested
in comedy.

Totally agree with you Jeri.
And something I didn't know till fairly recently - although I admit I
don't
know how true this is - but apparantly Denis Norden (he of It'll Be Alright
On The Night 'fame) used to be a fairly prolific scriptwriter. I've no idea
who he wrote for though (without googling of course).
And I think I'm right in saying that some of the Goon Shows, because they
were aired live, were broadcast as they were, with Sellers - and sometimes
others - going way off script, but nobody could bring him back &quot;on-script&quot;
either - mind you sometimes I don't think they'd want to, and if you listen
to the shows sometimes you can hear the likes of Seagoon (Harry Secombe)
trying to stifle his laughter iin the background ;o)
And slightly off-topic, apparantly Ray Stubbs is one of the main writers
for A Question Of Sport, which surprised me a little, although it obv makes
sense).

M8 if you think Tony Hancock had no input into the creative process then you
have just proved how little you know. As well as altering much of the work
done by Galton and Simpson, Sykes etc to suit his delivery he also wrote The
Punch and Judy Man, all his stand up shows up to and including Hancock at The
Royal Albert Hall and The Rebel which is regarded as one of the best British
comedy films of the sixties.
Sorry m8. You are clueless.

You lost me at Chris Tarrant. He's had his moments but generally is humour
is a blunt tool. Reeves and Mortimer you either get or you don't. I don't. find
French and Saunders that interesting though they have had a few moments. Ab
Fab was good fun and The Vica of Dibley excellent at times.
Spike was a surreal genius He looked at life through a warped lens and the
world was better for it imo.

Denis Nordan is responsible for some of the greatest classics of British
comedy m8. You don't write material for the consistently best comic performers
of three decades without knowing what you are doing. His work for The Goons
Pyton and Ustinov made he and Frank Muir world reknowned.

If you think Tony Hancock was just a bloke saying lines it proves how little
you know and also makes mewonder why you aren't a star. It is true that he
worked extensively with Galton and Simpson, and the likes of Eric Sykes, but
Tony Hancock is rightly recognised as one of the giants of British comedy, and
as Paul Merton proved when he recently re-recorded some of G&amp;H's scripts,
not anyone can just do it.

Try the Imdb,but have you ever read any of Spike Milligans,now this man was a genius hiding in a lunatics body,anybody else remember the &quot;Q&quot; series,at one time at London zoo they had tape recorders,you put a token in and it played a tape about the animal you were looking at,Spike took a recorder along with a tape he had made,pretended to put a token in then started the tape,it went something like this,Hello I am a giraffe,I have a leg on each corner are I would fall over,it went on finishing by saying how when the zoo closed they all went to the cafe for tea and cakes,another very clever man was Bob Monkhouse as is Chris Tarrant and Reeves and Mortimer and I must not forget French and Saunders

Ive just got a dvd recorder

I usually surf the tv and sat channels and record bits and pieces

I thought now I could do the same but this time

with disc

I recorded for about 10 days and then a notice came up disc full

I was on sp so I thought i d get 2 hours

but if felt like i d recorded about 1 hour

what happens is the software seems to make little files each time you record

I d used up my 50 files or titles and that was it

the software came up with disc full

yet there was still about 45 mins on disc

are all dvds recorders like this ? anyone else hitting this problem

if i was on long play 4 hours it would be worse as

it would say disc full with about 3 hours left

it seems absurd

Denis Nordan is responsible for some of the greatest classics of British
comedy m8. You don't write material for the consistently best comic
performers
of three decades without knowing what you are doing. His work for The Goons
Pyton and Ustinov made he and Frank Muir world reknowned.

Totally agree with you Jeri.
And something I didn't know till fairly recently - although I admit I
don't
know how true this is - but apparantly Denis Norden (he of It'll Be Alright
On The Night 'fame) used to be a fairly prolific scriptwriter. I've no idea
who he wrote for though (without googling of course).
And I think I'm right in saying that some of the Goon Shows, because they
were aired live, were broadcast as they were, with Sellers - and sometimes
others - going way off script, but nobody could bring him back &quot;on-script&quot;
either - mind you sometimes I don't think they'd want to, and if you listen
to the shows sometimes you can hear the likes of Seagoon (Harry Secombe)
trying to stifle his laughter iin the background ;o)
And slightly off-topic, apparantly Ray Stubbs is one of the main writers
for A Question Of Sport, which surprised me a little, although it obv makes
sense).

&gt; Sorry. Are you saying that Spike Peter Sellers and Michael Bentine

that.
&gt; Sellers was notorious for going off-script into his own little world and
&gt; everyone just let him get on with it because what he produced was so
good.
&gt; Ronny Barker wrote sometimes as Gerald Wiley and performed his own
material,
&gt; but he mostly wrote as part of a team which included Peter Caulfield a
&gt; pseudonym for Alan Ayckbourn, who was employed as a BBC radio drama
producer
&gt; at the time and was not supposed to work elsewhere. While there were
acts
&gt; that performed writer's work alot of these teams produced their own
material
&gt; either on their own as part of a team. Even if they did perform other
&gt; people's writing it doesn't diminish their comic genius. That is like
saying
&gt; Jeremy Irons is a shit actor because he doesn't write his own films.

Is it the type that you put a disc in the drawer or does it have a built in hard drive,the one I got was one of the dvd-rw types and it depended on the capacity of the disc and it only would allow me to record from main line channels (not sattelite),so I never got it fixed up properley,I bought a normal DVD player and has soon as you switched on it took over the tv,I should reckon the best thing you could get (if you can afford it) is a Skybox,that seems to be what the proffesional cappers (such as Bombscan) uses

If you want the banana on its own you have to pay a non-YILK charge of
£10. On top of the £14.99 of course.

ITS a panasonic dvd recorder theres no hard drive or anything
I can hook it up and take caps thats no problem

its just the way I use it is to tape bits and pieces from tv

for eg it might be adele silva on emmerdale

but my prob is that every time you record

and then stop it puts a little file onto the disc

and it seems that your limited to do this 50 times

then a notice comes up disc full you ve used up all
the titles

it seems absurd its like your limited by some kind of

software

there might be 3 hours left on the disc but if you ve made 50 seperate recordings of 1 minute each

the notice will come up disc full

I just wondered if someone else had come up against this

problem

im feelin well miffed as i bought it from One TV on satellite its not as though I can pop round to Comet and
exchange it

Is it the type that you put a disc in the drawer or does it have a built in hard drive,the one I got was one of the dvd-rw types and it depended on the capacity of the disc and it only would allow me to record from main line channels (not sattelite),so I never got it fixed up properley,I bought a normal DVD player and has soon as you switched on it took over the tv,I should reckon the best thing you could get (if you can afford it) is a Skybox,that seems to be what the proffesional cappers (such as Bombscan) uses

Sometimes, in fact very often, it's how the material is delivered now where
it came from. Otherwise, wouldn't all the scriptwriters be performing their
own work?

Chris Tarrant has a ver natural humour and was very good and very
influential with Tizwaz (the best &quot;kids program&quot; there's ever been IMO,
except maybe for Dangermouse which of course featured another genius in
David Jason).
Chris Tarrant also had that other 'late' show of which the title escapes me
atm, but I don't think that was as widely excepted as was hoped.
Sally Wotserface was cute too ;op
Jeri, I gotta stop agreeing with you mate, or people will think I'm
brown-nosing when I'm not ;op The only thing I don't really agree with you
on is AbFab and/or French and Saunders. For some reason I've just never
found either of them funny for some reason, but yet Vicar of Dibley is/was
funny.

I refer the honourable gentleman..........no stop that! ...*ahem*
sorry....... I was with you until I just read what Jeri told me/us.
I also agree about Hancock. While I don't personally find him *that* funny
- say in comparison to Milligan and/or The Goons - I appreciate what a giant
of comedy he is/was, and how a lot of comedy wouldn't have progressed to
what it is today without him.

The late version of TISWAS was called OTT. It ran for about three years.
Sally James was the first real kids TV babe and she always dressed in little
skirts and leather boots got her tshirt wet and had big peanuts. I actually said
I don't find French and Saunders that interesting though they have had their
moments though I typed that badly. My interest in ABFab was for Patsy whom I
thought hilarious and Saffy who made me dribble.

Chris Tarrant has a ver natural humour and was very good and very
influential with Tizwaz (the best &quot;kids program&quot; there's ever been IMO, except maybe
for Dangermouse which of course featured another genius in David Jason).

Chris Tarrant also had that other 'late' show of which the title escapes me
atm, but I don't think that was as widely excepted as was hoped.

Sally Wotserface was cute too ;op

Jeri, I gotta stop agreeing with you mate, or people will think I'm
brown-nosing when I'm not ;op The only thing I don't really agree with you on is
AbFab and/or French and Saunders. For some reason I've just never found either of
them funny for some reason, but yet Vicar of Dibley is/was funny.

find French and Saunders that interesting though they have had a few moments. Ab
Fab was good fun and The Vica of Dibley excellent at times.
Spike was a surreal genius He looked at life through a warped lens and the

Sorry but who is/was &quot;lmdb&quot;?
And if you want to know what Spike Milligan books I have (read) look at my
bookcrossing shelf

(apologies to those who think I may be using this to promote BC - I'm not,
just using it to show how many Spike books I've read. I'm trying to collect
em all but I've a way to go yet methinks).
btw guys, probably the best site re Spike Milligan (and no it's nothing to

There is also a Spike Milligan Yahoo Group which I am a member of.

months ago
&gt;&gt; Yahoo used
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to allow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pictures to be stored in messages,then
they stopped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allowing this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and

what

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now I have tried to explain it DON'T ASK

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be

do seem
&gt;&gt; to be

The only times I find banana's sexy are when when a sexy lady is

If you're talking to me, then I'm the owner of 2 other Yahoo groups, and
a moderator here, (though I don't actually do an awful lot of moderating
because jeri &amp; waste have it all more than covered. I just manage the
Hushspace googlegroups archive).

You talk about going mad finding pictures but I don't actually see any
pictures you've contributed to the group; only your ill-informed rants.
As I said before, you really aren't creating the best impression here.

£ is real money, as opposed to $ which is for monopoly.

The late version of TISWAS was called OTT. It ran for about three years.
Sally James was the first real kids TV babe and she always dressed in little
skirts and leather boots got her tshirt wet and had big peanuts. I actually
said
I don't find French and Saunders that interesting though they have had their
moments though I typed that badly. My interest in ABFab was for Patsy whom I
thought hilarious and Saffy who made me dribble.

Sally Wotserface was cute too ;op

Jeri, I gotta stop agreeing with you mate, or people will think I'm

AbFab and/or French and Saunders. For some reason I've just never found

No he wasn't funny, he had to get Sid James off one his series as Sid was getting all the laughs. Tony was not very funny, I am 57 and remember his stuff and it was average. He topped himself and went in to Hall of Fame.

If you think Tony Hancock was just a bloke saying lines it proves how little you know and also makes mewonder why you aren't a star. It is true that he worked extensively with Galton and Simpson, and the likes of Eric Sykes, but Tony Hancock is rightly recognised as one of the giants of British comedy, and as Paul Merton proved when he recently re-recorded some of G&amp;H's scripts, not anyone can just do it.

IMDB is pretty much your first port of call if you want to know about fil or
TV. Be wary of taing everything as gospel though. I have found one or two
mistakes and I often hear knowledgable people contradicting it.

(apologies to those who think I may be using this to promote BC - I'm not,
just using it to show how many Spike books I've read. I'm trying to collect em
all but I've a way to go yet methinks).

btw guys, probably the best site re Spike Milligan (and no it's nothing to
do with me, though I wish it was) is

I disagree. Sketches like The Blood Doner are recognised classics and that
one is widely recognised as possibly the best thirty minutes of British Comedy
ever filmed. I may not be hitting 60 but I have watched most of his stuff
again and again and read around the subject very widely.
The getting rid of Sidney James was a symptom of his general paranoia and a
aprt of his very public very painful self destruction.

If you think Tony Hancock was just a bloke saying lines it proves how little
you know and also makes mewonder why you aren't a star. It is true that he
worked extensively with Galton and Simpson, and the likes of Eric Sykes, but
Tony Hancock is rightly recognised as one of the giants of British comedy, and
as Paul Merton proved when he recently re-recorded some of G&amp;H's scripts,
not anyone can just do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you want the banana on its own you have to pay a non-YILK

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; £10. On top of the £14.99 of course.

I think he is trying to be nice to someone. I tried that for a while, but really they are not worth the time. If they can't read the front page, or the file sent to them, then we usually say nasty stuff about them, then they disappear from the group. If they have finally figured things out then they can rejoin. It is kind of like driving off of a cliff. The signs were all there, they were just too stupid to read them, and the human gene pool is better off without them in it.

Where on earth do you find time to be involved with that many groups? I am in more than I can contribute to. Apart from this group, and the other Hushspace, I part own and mod at only one other, and am a member of about 50 or so groups. Most are for individual celebs, or music or politics.

If you're talking to me, then I'm the owner of 2 other Yahoo groups, and
a moderator here, (though I don't actually do an awful lot of moderating
because jeri &amp; waste have it all more than covered. I just manage the
Hushspace googlegroups archive).

You talk about going mad finding pictures but I don't actually see any
pictures you've contributed to the group; only your ill-informed rants.
As I said before, you really aren't creating the best impression here.

It is a huge site, loaded with information. It would be impossible not to have a few mistakes. I have found a few. They have missed a few movies as well. I agree fully. It is the best place to start.

IMDB is pretty much your first port of call if you want to know about fil or TV. Be wary of taing everything as gospel though. I have found one or two mistakes and I often hear knowledgable people contradicting it.

(apologies to those who think I may be using this to promote BC - I'm not, just using it to show how many Spike books I've read. I'm trying to collect em all but I've a way to go yet methinks).

btw guys, probably the best site re Spike Milligan (and no it's nothing to do with me, though I wish it was) is

http://www.spikemilligan.co.uk

There is also a Spike Milligan Yahoo Group which I am a member of.

I was just giving him the 1+1, I was kind of hoping he would do the math. It is a question I think I would pose to everyone who is a member of so many groups, is why? These groups and the service that Yahoo provides is great. A nice place to meet people, and have fun on the net. Join groups, see if the group is for you. If not, leave, and find ones that are, where you can atleast get something out of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you want the banana on its own you have to pay a non-

I have a coupon for a free banana. Actually, it's just a coupon for 50 cents off any produce item, but I plan on using it to acquire a banana for free.

You need the secret Yahoo Image Locker Key (tm). Yours for a very
reasonable £14.99/month. First month comes with a FREE complimentary
banana.

&gt;&gt; Who are you talking to exactly? The morons who need the

&gt;&gt; look at posts with pictures and the rest of us are bored by
&gt; the whole

I have to admit to ashamedly not knowing any off-by-heard (my memory is awful), but just looked these up
from  http://www.thegoonshow.net/index.asp

This is from The Red Fort:

Bloodnok: What's the matter with you this morning, Seagoon? Why have you got such a long face?
Seagoon: Heavy dentures, sir.
Bloodnok: I see. Well, have you seen a doctor?
Seagoon: Yes, I just saw one walking down the road

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------

And this is probably my favourite bit of Goonery off all-time (I had to google to get the complete thing):

Episode - What Time Is It Eccles -

Bluebottle What time is it Eccles?
Eccles Err, just a minute. I, I've got it written down 'ere on a piece of paper. A nice man wrote the time down for me this morning.
Bluebottle Ooooh, then why do you carry it around with you Eccles?
Eccles Well, umm, if a anybody asks me the ti-ime, I ca-can show it to dem.
Bluebottle Wait a minute Eccles, my good man...
Eccles What is it fellow?
Bluebottle It's writted on this bit of paper, what is eight o'clock, is writted.
Eccles I know that my good fellow. That's right, um, when I asked the fella to write it down, it was eight o'clock.
Bluebottle Well then. Supposing when somebody asks you the time, it isn't eight o'clock?
Eccles Ah, den I don't show it to dem.
Bluebottle Ooohhh...
Eccles [Smacks lips] Yeah.
Bluebottle Well how do you know when it's eight o'clock?
Eccles I've got it written down on a piece of paper!
Bluebottle Oh, I wish I could afford a piece of paper with the time written on.
Eccles Oohhhh.
Bluebottle 'Ere Eccles?
Eccles Yah.
Bluebottle Let me hold that piece of paper to my ear would you? - 'Ere. This piece of paper ain't goin'.
Eccles What? I've been sold a forgery!
Bluebottle No wonder it stopped at eight o'clock.
Eccles Oh dear.
Bluebottle You should get one of them tings my grandad's got.
Eccles Oooohhh?
Bluebottle His firm give it to him when he retired.
Eccles Oooohhh.
Bluebottle It's one of dem tings what it is that wakes you up at eight o'clock, boils the kettil, and pours a cuppa tea.
Eccles Ohhh yeah! What's it called? Um.
Bluebottle My granma.
Eccles Ohh... Ohh, ah wait a minute. How does she know when it's eight o'clock?
Bluebottle She's got it written down on a piece of paper!

You wouldn't believe, and they're not just here. I work in a tax office and today a guy brought me a form that I mailed to him over 14 months ago and pretended like he just got it yesterday. I'm sitting there trying not to say &quot;look fucktard, it says April 2004 right on the top of this letter! Can you please cut the shit!&quot; Finally I told him he was hopelessly past deadline and told him to just leave my office.

I didn't much care about the comments I could see where he was coming from
even if I just cannot agree with spoonfeeding the deficient and the lazy but
posting in contravention of clearly defined group rules is just taking the
piss.

He must of he moderates at 8 groups. He knows his stuff. (I am being

I have to agree. While I'm a member of 42 groups, only 4 or 6 actually have messages on a daily basis and I only contribute in 3 regularly. I have a hard time keeping up with the few active groups I'm in. I'd have to quit my job and dump my girlfriend to participate in more, not to even mention own or moderate them.

We were at Olive Garden and they had these little sugar packets for your coffee that were shaped like tiny tubes. They were color coded so you could tell what was sugar, Equal, Sweet &amp; Low, etc. I took one of the sugar packets and opened it just because I was curious. I don't know why. I know that it was just sugar inside and I could even tell from the air bubble in the tube how much sugar was there. Anyway, it wasn't a well thought out plan. Now I had an open sugar packet, but nowhere to put the sugar. I took a sly look around the restaurant to make sure nobody was looking, and quickly poured all the sugar into my mouth and hid the wrapper under my plate. She kicked me about 10 or 12 times, but was laughing so hard throughout she almost fell out of the booth.

I'm not a girl, I'm a guy you know? But at the same time, I tell ya how you can solve this abortion issue right now. Ready? Those unwanted babies that single moms leave in alleys and in dumpsters? Leave about 12 of those on the steps of The Supreme Court. This is over. Like that. &quot;You guys said we had to have them? Then you guys...FUCKING RAISE 'EM.&quot;&quot;Raise 'em then, you fucking fucking raise 'em. YOU raise 'em. You said I had to have it? Then it's yours. Fuck. It's yours..Take it&quot;

- Bill Hicks

How come people always flip and think they're Jesus? Why not Buddha? Particularly in America, where more people resemble Buddha than Jesus. 'Ah'm BUDDHA!' 'You're Bubba!' 'Ah'm Buddha now..All I gotta do is change 3 letters on ma belt...'

- Bill Hicks

See I think drugs have done some good things for us. If you don't think drugs have done good things for us then do me a favor. Go home tonight and take all of your records,tapes and all your CD's and burn them. Because, you know all those musicians who made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years? Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreal fucking high on drugs, man.

- Bill Hicks

You know all that money we spend on the military ever year - trillions of dollars? Instead, if we use this money to feed and clothe the poor of this world, which it would do many times over, then we can explore space, inner and outer, together, as one race.

A lot of Christians wear crosses around their necks. Do you think when Jesus comes back he ever wants to see a fuckin' cross? It's kind of like going up to Jackie Onassis with a rifle pendant on.&quot;

My final point about alchohol, about drugs, about Pornography...What business is it of your's what I do, read, buy, see or take into my body as long as I don't harm another human being whilst on this planet? And for those of you having a little moral dilemna on how to answer this, I'll answer for you. NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS Take that to the bank, cash it and take it on a vacation outta my fucking life. And stop bringing shotguns to UFO sightings, they might be here to pick me up and take me with 'em.

Obnoxious , self-righteous, whining little fucks. My biggest fear is that if I quit smoking, I'll become on of you...Don't take that wrong. I have something to tell you non-smokers that I know for a fact that you don't know, and I feel it's my duty to pass on information at all times. Ready?.......Non-smokers die every day...Enjoy your evening. See, I know that you entertain this eternal life fantasy because you've chosen not to smoke, but let me be the 1st to POP that bubble and bring you hurtling back to reality....You're dead too.

- Bill Hicks

I generally love my job. You know what the great thing about being a comic is? I have no boss. That's a definate lifestyle plus isnt it?..Aren't bosses something?.....They're like gnats at a picnic man....Get the fuck out of here buddy, it's just a job, doesn't mean a thing.

The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to go on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question, is this real, or is this just a ride? And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, &quot;Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because, this is just a ride... And we... kill those people.

Did you know that if you play the New Kids On The Block record backwards, it actually sounds better.

- Bill Hicks

I was told when I grew up I could be anything I wanted: a fireman, a policeman, a doctor - even president, it seemed. And for the first time in the history of mankind, something new, called an astronaut. But like so many kids brought up on a steady diet of westerns, I always wanted to be the avenging cowboy hero - that lone voice in the wilderness, fighting corruption and evil wherever I fount it, and standing for freedom, truth, and justice. And in my heart of hearts I still track the remnants of that dream wherever I go, in my endless ride into the setting sun.

Alot of the ones I am at are there for just one celeb, so there is not that much going on until the lady it is about does something. Also a few that are by good scanners, that only allow for comments, when they post their scans, or caps. Still once a month I try to go through them to see which ones are still worth it.

I have to agree. While I'm a member of 42 groups, only 4 or 6 actually have messages on a daily basis and I only contribute in 3 regularly. I have a hard time keeping up with the few active groups I'm in. I'd have to quit my job and dump my girlfriend to participate in more, not to even mention own or moderate them.

Pretty funny, though it's hard to get the feel for the comedy without seeing how he delievers it. I recognized the war on drugs quote from a Denis Leary routine I have. I wonder if it was a miquote, or maybe just &quot;borrowed&quot; by Denis.

See, I know that you entertain this eternal life fantasy because you've chosen not to smoke, but let me be the 1st to POP that bubble and bring you hurtling back to reality....You're dead too.

I generally love my job. You know what the great thing about being a comic is? I have no boss. That's a definate lifestyle plus isnt it?..Aren't bosses something?.....They're like gnats at a picnic man....Get the fuck out of here buddy, it's just a job, doesn't mean a thing. I smoked a joint this morning, you're lucky I showed...My bed was like a womb man...

Think of me as Chomsky with dick jokes.

Ever noticed that people who believe in Creationism look really unevolved?

When Jesus comes back to earth the last thing he wants to see is a cross.

The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to go on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question, is this real, or is this just a ride? And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, &quot;Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because, this is just a ride... And we... kill those people.

- Bill Hicks

What did moths bump into before the electric light bulb was invented? Boy, the lightbulb really screwed the moth up didn't it? Are there moths on their way to the sun now going, &quot;It's gonna be worth it!&quot;

- Bill Hicks

Did you know that if you play the New Kids On The Block record backwards, it actually sounds better.

- Bill Hicks

I was told when I grew up I could be anything I wanted: a fireman, a policeman, a doctor - even president, it seemed. And for the first time in the history of mankind, something new, called an astronaut. But like so many kids brought up on a steady diet of westerns, I always wanted to be the avenging cowboy hero - that lone voice in the wilderness, fighting corruption and evil wherever I fount it, and standing for freedom, truth, and justice. And in my heart of hearts I still track the remnants of that dream wherever I go, in my endless ride into the setting sun.

I've just left several groups because I couldn't keep up with the traffic
and I didn't want thousands of unread emails. Most people on the group system
confuse me when I see how many groups they belong to.

My take on the matter is to shoot first and ask questions never. In a group of 3000 one idiot will not be noticed if he's shown the door. Then again, I tend to be a sadistic bastard to strangers online.

I think he is trying to be nice to someone. I tried that for a while, but really they are not worth the time. If they can't read the front page, or the file sent to them, then we usually say nasty stuff about them, then they disappear from the group. If they have finally figured things out then they can rejoin. It is kind of like driving off of a cliff. The signs were all there, they were just too stupid to read them, and the human gene pool is better off without them in it.

very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some
people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question, is this
real, or is this just a ride? And other people have remembered, and they

I was told when I grew up I could be anything I wanted: a fireman, a
policeman, a doctor - even president, it seemed. And for the first time in the
history of mankind, something new, called an astronaut. But like so many kids
brought up on a steady diet of westerns, I always wanted to be the avenging
cowboy hero - that lone voice in the wilderness, fighting corruption and evil
wherever I fount it, and standing for freedom, truth, and justice. And in my
heart of hearts I still track the remnants of that dream wherever I go, in my
endless ride into the setting sun.

I don't really care as long as they stay within group rules. They don't seem
to understand those rules are there for really good reasons. As for the rest
of it - things like &quot;attachments not stored&quot; - I don't tollerate that kind
of laziness and stupidity from 12 year olds I teach I'll be mullahed if I'm
going to take it here from people who are &quot;supposed&quot; to be 18+.
Then again I've been hanging around in groups run by har bastards so it's
not really surprising

It wasn't hard to spot him. His name written entirely in capitals combined

He must of he moderates at 8 groups. He knows his stuff. (I am being
sarcastic). I kind of thought he was on the way out shortly after he started his
comments. I think I am getting good at seeing who is going to screw up.

Look, this group is about (insert what *I* think this group is about here) and who the hell cares how old they are, (insert obligatory insult here). It's not up to YOU what's appropriate and inappropriate (note the end of the sentence without any reference to the ACTUAL moderators of the group, implying that I am somehow a close personal buddy of the moderators).

So go (insert instructive insult here) yourself with your (insert random genitalia here) and a (insert farm animal here), you (insert extremely lame finishing epithet).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Who are you talking to exactly? The morons who need the
&gt;&gt; advice only
&gt;&gt;&gt; look at posts with pictures and the rest of us are bored by
&gt;&gt; the whole
&gt;&gt;&gt; subject. If I can offer you some advice it would be to limit
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt; replies to things you know about and leave the group
&gt;&gt; administration to
&gt;&gt;&gt; others more suited. You seem like a well meaning guy but I
&gt;&gt; can't see
&gt;&gt;&gt; you lasting too long in here if you keep it up with posts

Metal thing then no wonder).
I believe there's a band called Acacia Avenue (and I only knew that cos it
was the first hit on google)

&gt; This is from The Red Fort:
&gt; Bloodnok: What's the matter with you this morning, Seagoon? Why have you
&gt; got such a long face?
&gt; Seagoon: Heavy dentures, sir.
&gt; Bloodnok: I see. Well, have you seen a doctor?
&gt; Seagoon: Yes, I just saw one walking down the road

&gt; Episode - What Time Is It Eccles -
&gt; Bluebottle What time is it Eccles? Eccles Err, just a minute. I, I've

&gt;&gt; I've no idea what either of you are on about (and if it is a

&gt;&gt; I believe there's a band called Acacia Avenue (and I only knew

&gt; I was just giving him the 1+1, I was kind of hoping he would do
the math. It
&gt; is a question I think I would pose to everyone who is a member of
so many
&gt; groups, is why? These groups and the service that Yahoo provides
is great. A
&gt; nice place to meet people, and have fun on the net. Join groups,
see if the
&gt; group is for you. If not, leave, and find ones that are, where you
can atleast
&gt; get something out of it.

&gt; messages on a daily basis and I only contribute in 3 regularly. I
have a
&gt; hard time keeping up with the few active groups I'm in. I'd have
to quit my
&gt; job and dump my girlfriend to participate in more, not to even
mention own or
&gt; moderate them.

&gt; I was just giving him the 1+1, I was kind of hoping he would do
the math. It
&gt; is a question I think I would pose to everyone who is a member of
so many
&gt; groups, is why? These groups and the service that Yahoo provides
is great. A
&gt; nice place to meet people, and have fun on the net. Join groups,
see if the
&gt; group is for you. If not, leave, and find ones that are, where you
can atleast
&gt; get something out of it.

&gt; If you're talking to me, then I'm the owner of 2 other Yahoo groups,
&gt; and
&gt; a moderator here, (though I don't actually do an awful lot of
&gt; moderating
&gt; because jeri &amp; waste have it all more than covered. I just manage the
&gt; Hushspace googlegroups archive).
&gt;
&gt; You talk about going mad finding pictures but I don't actually see any
&gt; pictures you've contributed to the group; only your ill-informed rants.
&gt; As I said before, you really aren't creating the best impression here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was just giving him the 1+1, I was kind of hoping he
would do
&gt;&gt; the math. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a question I think I would pose to everyone who is a

groups,
&gt;&gt; see if the

where you
&gt;&gt; can atleast
&gt;&gt;&gt; get something out of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He doesn't. Amazing also how with all this posting
for &quot;pics for a
&gt;&gt; load of
&gt;&gt;&gt; idle bastards who never contribute a bloody thing to the
groups&quot;
&gt;&gt; the only
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing he has given us is gyp.

Just think of having sex with Roseanne. That'll sober you up fast.
It also works for getting rid of unwanted erections. Of course, at
my age, I want most of my erections. But that is both too much
information and irrelevant. Just stop laughing, okay?

By the way, I was referring to Roseanne Barr, not Roseanne Arquette.
She has the exact opposite effect when it comes to erections for me.

By the way, I was referring to Roseanne Barr, not Roseanne Arquette.
She has the exact opposite effect when it comes to erections for me.

Speaking of Different Strokes, I recently found some pics of Dana
Plato. They were hardcore stuff and I don't know if they were fakes of
not. Does anyone know if she did a HC vid before her suicide? If this
is a fake, this girl is an incredible look-a-like.

She did playboy so don't post them. There has been some stuff bouncing

best ask more knowledgable people. I know the so called lez movie she did was
just a mainstream video flick

Yeah, I knew not to post the Playboy stuff. The lez action was froma
movie titled, hmmm...&quot;Different Strokes and isn't really hot in my
thinking. LOL The stuff I am trying to figure out whether it is a
fake is TRUE hardcore MMF stuff, so I wouldn't post it anyway. Hope
someone knows the facts on this. I think I got it off Robb's if
anyone wants to check it out.

&gt; If you're talking to me, then I'm the owner of 2 other Yahoo groups,
&gt; and
&gt; a moderator here, (though I don't actually do an awful lot of
&gt; moderating
&gt; because jeri &amp; waste have it all more than covered. I just manage the
&gt; Hushspace googlegroups archive).

&gt; You talk about going mad finding pictures but I don't actually see any
&gt; pictures you've contributed to the group; only your ill-informed rants.
&gt; As I said before, you really aren't creating the best impression here.

Oops I thought you said Roseanna. Thinking of her could do the opposite. You mean the one with the e on the end and married Tom Arnold. That makes some sense now. I misread, and for a moment I thought you were daft. It is good to know that you are not daft.

Just think of having sex with Roseanne. That'll sober you up fast.
It also works for getting rid of unwanted erections. Of course, at
my age, I want most of my erections. But that is both too much
information and irrelevant. Just stop laughing, okay?

By the way, I was referring to Roseanne Barr, not Roseanne Arquette.
She has the exact opposite effect when it comes to erections for me.

Who says I am not daft? True, my penchant for hot women would seem
to make me sane, but that is hardly a qualifying factor, is it? Most
people that know would say that I am quite mad, but fun to be around
anyway.

OOooh...with the type of pictures on this board, I think it might be
a little icky to say I &quot;spilled something&quot; on my keyboard. Nasty.
Couldn't say it was hair gel, could I? That has been used too.

She did a T&amp;A movie called Different Strokes. I saw it, it was hardly hardcore. It had some women who did alot of these movies in them. If they are caps from this movie they should be okay. Any nude scans would be from Playboy. Don't post these ones of course.

Here are a few of caps I have from the movie.

Yeah, I knew not to post the Playboy stuff. The lez action was froma
movie titled, hmmm...&quot;Different Strokes and isn't really hot in my
thinking. LOL The stuff I am trying to figure out whether it is a
fake is TRUE hardcore MMF stuff, so I wouldn't post it anyway. Hope
someone knows the facts on this. I think I got it off Robb's if
anyone wants to check it out.

&gt; If you're talking to me, then I'm the owner of 2 other Yahoo
groups,

&gt; a moderator here, (though I don't actually do an awful lot of

&gt; because jeri &amp; waste have it all more than covered. I just
manage
the

&gt;
&gt; You talk about going mad finding pictures but I don't actually see
any

&gt; As I said before, you really aren't creating the best impression

Oops I thought you said Roseanna. Thinking of her could do the opposite. You mean the one with the e on the end and married Tom Arnold. That makes some sense now. I misread, and for a moment I thought you were daft. It is good to know that you are not daft.

Just think of having sex with Roseanne. That'll sober you up fast.
It also works for getting rid of unwanted erections. Of course, at
my age, I want most of my erections. But that is both too much
information and irrelevant. Just stop laughing, okay?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was just giving him the 1+1, I was kind of
&gt;&gt; hoping he would do
&gt;&gt;&gt; the math. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a question I think I would pose to
&gt;&gt; everyone who is a member of
&gt;&gt;&gt; so many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; groups, is why? These groups and the service
&gt;&gt; that Yahoo provides
&gt;&gt;&gt; is great. A
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nice place to meet people, and have fun on
&gt;&gt; the net. Join groups,
&gt;&gt;&gt; see if the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group is for you. If not, leave, and find ones
&gt;&gt; that are, where you
&gt;&gt;&gt; can atleast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get something out of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was just giving him the 1+1, I was kind of
&gt;&gt;&gt; hoping he would do

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a question I think I would pose to
&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone who is a member of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; groups, is why? These groups and the service
&gt;&gt;&gt; that Yahoo provides
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is great. A
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nice place to meet people, and have fun on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the net. Join groups,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see if the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group is for you. If not, leave, and find ones
&gt;&gt;&gt; that are, where you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can atleast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get something out of it.

&gt; Humor:Bill Hicks
&gt; I'm not a girl, I'm a guy you know? But at the same time, I tell ya how
&gt; you can solve this abortion issue right now. Ready? Those unwanted babies
&gt; that single moms leave in alleys and in dumpsters? Leave about 12 of those
&gt; on the steps of The Supreme Court. This is over. Like that. &quot;You guys said
&gt; we had to have them? Then you guys...FUCKING RAISE 'EM.&quot;&quot;Raise 'em then,
&gt; you fucking fucking raise 'em. YOU raise 'em. You said I had to have it?
&gt; Then it's yours. Fuck. It's yours..Take it&quot;

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; How come people always flip and think they're Jesus? Why not Buddha?
&gt; Particularly in America, where more people resemble Buddha than Jesus. 'Ah'm
&gt; BUDDHA!' 'You're Bubba!' 'Ah'm Buddha now..All I gotta do is change 3
&gt; letters on ma belt...'

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; See I think drugs have done some good things for us. If you don't think
&gt; drugs have done good things for us then do me a favor. Go home tonight and
&gt; take all of your records,tapes and all your CD's and burn them. Because, you
&gt; know all those musicians who made all that great music that's enhanced your
&gt; lives throughout the years? Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreal fucking high on
&gt; drugs, man.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; You know all that money we spend on the military ever year - trillions of
&gt; dollars? Instead, if we use this money to feed and clothe the poor of this
&gt; world, which it would do many times over, then we can explore space, inner
&gt; and outer, together, as one race.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; What do atheists scream when they come?&quot;

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; A lot of Christians wear crosses around their necks. Do you think when
&gt; Jesus comes back he ever wants to see a fuckin' cross? It's kind of like
&gt; going up to Jackie Onassis with a rifle pendant on.&quot;

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is mearly energy
&gt; condensed through a slow vibration, we are all one consciousness
&gt; experiencing itself subjectively, life is only a dream and we are the
&gt; imaginations of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; If you don't think drugs have done good things for us then take all of
&gt; your records,tapes and CD's and burn them.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; My final point about alchohol, about drugs, about Pornography...What
&gt; business is it of your's what I do, read, buy, see or take into my body as
&gt; long as I don't harm another human being whilst on this planet? And for
&gt; those of you having a little moral dilemna on how to answer this, I'll
&gt; answer for you. NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS Take that to the bank, cash it
&gt; and take it on a vacation outta my fucking life. And stop bringing shotguns
&gt; to UFO sightings, they might be here to pick me up and take me with 'em.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; Obnoxious , self-righteous, whining little fucks. My biggest fear is that
&gt; if I quit smoking, I'll become on of you...Don't take that wrong. I have
&gt; something to tell you non-smokers that I know for a fact that you don't
&gt; know, and I feel it's my duty to pass on information at all times.
&gt; Ready?.......Non-smokers die every day...Enjoy your evening. See, I know
&gt; that you entertain this eternal life fantasy because you've chosen not to
&gt; smoke, but let me be the 1st to POP that bubble and bring you hurtling back
&gt; to reality....You're dead too.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; I generally love my job. You know what the great thing about being a comic
&gt; is? I have no boss. That's a definate lifestyle plus isnt it?..Aren't bosses
&gt; something?.....They're like gnats at a picnic man....Get the fuck out of
&gt; here buddy, it's just a job, doesn't mean a thing. I smoked a joint this
&gt; morning, you're lucky I showed...My bed was like a womb man...

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; Think of me as Chomsky with dick jokes.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; Ever noticed that people who believe in Creationism look really unevolved?

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; When Jesus comes back to earth the last thing he wants to see is a cross.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to go
&gt; on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And
&gt; the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and
&gt; it's very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while.
&gt; Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to
&gt; question, is this real, or is this just a ride? And other people have
&gt; remembered, and they come back to us, they say, &quot;Hey - don't worry, don't be
&gt; afraid, ever, because, this is just a ride... And we... kill those people.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; What did moths bump into before the electric light bulb was invented? Boy,
&gt; the lightbulb really screwed the moth up didn't it? Are there moths on their
&gt; way to the sun now going, &quot;It's gonna be worth it!&quot;

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; Did you know that if you play the New Kids On The Block record backwards,
&gt; it actually sounds better.

&gt; - Bill Hicks

&gt; I was told when I grew up I could be anything I wanted: a fireman, a
&gt; policeman, a doctor - even president, it seemed. And for the first time in
&gt; the history of mankind, something new, called an astronaut. But like so many
&gt; kids brought up on a steady diet of westerns, I always wanted to be the
&gt; avenging cowboy hero - that lone voice in the wilderness, fighting
&gt; corruption and evil wherever I fount it, and standing for freedom, truth,
&gt; and justice. And in my heart of hearts I still track the remnants of that
&gt; dream wherever I go, in my endless ride into the setting sun.

&gt;&gt; That'll sober you up

&gt;&gt;&gt; It also works for getting rid of unwanted

When Jesus comes back to earth the last thing he wants to see is a cross.

The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to go on
it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the
ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's
very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some
people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question, is this
real, or is this just a ride? And other people have remembered, and they
come back to us, they say, &quot;Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because,
this is just a ride... And we... kill those people.

What did moths bump into before the electric light bulb was invented? Boy,
the lightbulb really screwed the moth up didn't it? Are there moths on their
way to the sun now going, &quot;It's gonna be worth it!&quot;

Did you know that if you play the New Kids On The Block record backwards, it
actually sounds better.

- Bill Hicks

I was told when I grew up I could be anything I wanted: a fireman, a
policeman, a doctor - even president, it seemed. And for the first time in the
history of mankind, something new, called an astronaut. But like so many kids
brought up on a steady diet of westerns, I always wanted to be the avenging
cowboy hero - that lone voice in the wilderness, fighting corruption and evil
wherever I fount it, and standing for freedom, truth, and justice. And in my
heart of hearts I still track the remnants of that dream wherever I go, in my
endless ride into the setting sun.

I figured that since Robb's link is listed here it
would be cooler to just tell people to visit his site
anyway. :) I really like his site. Lots of stuff there
you can't find elsewhere.

&gt; I don't think Robb likes his stuff posted here. He
&gt; would rather see the link
&gt; posted.
&gt; Or atleast that's the way it use to be.

&gt; not sure it wasn't

&gt;&gt; not. Does anyone know if she did a HC vid before

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oops I thought you said Roseanna.
&gt; Thinking
&gt;&gt; of her could do the
&gt;&gt; opposite. You mean the one with the e on the end
&gt;&gt; and married Tom
&gt;&gt; Arnold. That makes some sense now. I misread,
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; for a moment I
&gt;&gt; thought you were daft. It is good to know that
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; are not daft.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just think of having sex with Roseanne.
&gt;&gt; That'll sober you up
&gt;&gt; fast.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It also works for getting rid of
&gt; unwanted
&gt;&gt; erections. Of
&gt;&gt; course, at
&gt;&gt;&gt; my age, I want most of my erections. But
&gt;&gt; that is both too
&gt;&gt; much
&gt;&gt;&gt; information and irrelevant. Just stop
&gt;&gt; laughing, okay?
