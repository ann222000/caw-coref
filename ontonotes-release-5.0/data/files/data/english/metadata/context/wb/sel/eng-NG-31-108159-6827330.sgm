Hi,

I am getting a new computer.  I am looking at HP or Dell workstation
with the Nvidia FX3500, 4GB RAM, 1 500GB HD, (2) Xeon Dual core 2.66
CPUs. The two computer are about the same money.  I am going to run
Adobe software on it. ie: Premiere Pro 2.0, PS CS, and eventually the
other products in the Suite.

I am currently running Premiere & PS on a Sony VIO notebook with 1GB
RAM 300GB USB HD and 2.8 P4 CPU and FX GO 5600 Nvidia graphics.  It
works OK only a little slow in each of the following areas...

1) CPU
2) HD Boarder line in speed it is mainly in the encoding process, I
think. Not 100% sure. I don't know if it is the DVD I am using or the
HD speed.
3) RAM is a little low when running PS & Premiere together Which I do
a lot designing my own DVD custom menus.

Overall it works but a little slow all around.  Adobe Premiere does
scale back the preview view that runs off of the time line to less
quality.  Some times if I add a lot of heavy transitions it slows down
running the HD and will not play the transition. No errors or
anything.  I want to run Adobe Prmiere in the highest quality display
100% of the time. With a lot of ilters/video effects, etc. running at
the same time.

Is the above computer specs, overkill? Epecially the Graphics card?
Which is better HP or Dell?  Does anyone know what motherboard is in
each computer? I wonder if the HP has the Nvidia board or it's own
make?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts,

John
