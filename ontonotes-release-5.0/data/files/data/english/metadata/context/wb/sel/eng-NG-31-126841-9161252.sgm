_White House Embraces Right-Wing Blog That Called For ‘Destroying’  Graeme
Frost_ ( http://thinkprogress.org/2007/10/12/white-house-redstate/ )
Much of _far right’s smear campaign_
( http://thinkprogress.org/2007/10/08/attacking-graeme-frost/ )  against 12-year old SCHIP  recipient Graeme Frost was
driven by the right-wing blogosphere. One blog in  particular, _Redstate_
( http://www.redstate.com/ ) , featured particularly _vitriolic comments_
( http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/health/bal-te.frosts10oct10,0,445999... ) . A poster
there wrote of the Frost  family:
If federal funds were required [they] could die for all I  care. Let the
parents get second jobs, let their state foot the bill  or let them seek help from
private charities. […]
I would hire a team of PIs and find out exactly how much their parents made
and where they spent every nickel. Then I’d do everything possible to  destroy
their lives with that info.
Rather than distancing themselves from the smear campaign, the White House
today decided to embrace RedState and reward the blog with an official _White
House posting_
( http://www.redstate.com/blogs/nthompsonwhitehouse/2007/oct/12/democra... ) .
In a post entitled “Democrats’ SCHIP Budget Gimmick,” Nicholas Thompson, a
staffer in the White House’s Office of Strategic Intiatives, _rallied the
conservative troops_
( http://www.redstate.com/blogs/nthompsonwhitehouse/2007/oct/12/democra... )  around Bush’ hard-line  stance, reminding
them that “we are less than one week” from Congress’ veto  override vote.
In today’s New York Times, _columnist Paul Krugman writes_
( http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/opinion/12krugman.html?_r=1&amp;hp;&amp;oref...; ) :
All in all, the Graeme Frost case is a perfect illustration of the  modern
right-wing political machine at work, and in particular its  routine reliance on
character assassination in place of honest debate. […]  Leading conservative
politicians, far from trying to distance themselves from  these smears, rush
to embrace them.
The White House’s tacit endorsement of a blog that promoted baseless attacks
against a 12-year old boy serves as a perfect illustration of Krugman’s
point.

Pay attention to what the rightwingers claim we are doing, because  that's
exactly what they are up to. - Randi  Rhodes

What stupidity...   Democrats accepted the offer of the Frosts as a
poster case...  That they are already elible and that he has $500,000
equitity in his house does NOT make the case...

As to what some posters post, who cares...  Nutcases on both side go
to the extreme, but they don't make the case for a generality here...
This is just another case of Lefties complaining that they are a mytar
by self inflected wounds...

jgg,

Damn, hell of a house marKet out there. Twenty-four hours ago that
house had a resale VALUE of $300K, then in a couple of hours it was up
to,$400K and now the EQUITITY in the house is $500K. How do i get a
peace of that action? In another couple of days they will have it up
to $1 million easily.

&gt;From reports I read, the mortgage was around $200,000...  If a 2,000
">

sq foot house is $500,000 then go figure a 3,000 sq foot house...
Even if their equity was only $250,000 this doesn't make them lower
middle class...  That both children were going to a private school
with a tuition of $20,000 each (not including scholarships or
discounts) tells me the parents have made some choices private schools
instead of insurance, a 3,000 foot house instead of insurance...

Are there no consequences to choices on how you spend your money???
Or is the deal here that the Frost's can spend there money for a 3,000
foot house and private schooling and then DEMAND that government give
them health insurance???  At what point does free health insurance
end???  Should any old Rockerfeller or Mellon expect free
insurance???

There are other issues here, example defining what a child is...  Is a
28 year old to be considered a child for SCHIP???  Of course these
questions are all ignored by the PR spin, pressure, and propaganda
that the Democrats are mounting to sign the bill now or be label a
&quot;child hater&quot;...  This is not unlike Katrina...  The Media scandalizes
the nation by claiming murder when there was none...  There was a
chance to fix a broken city, NO...  Claiming &quot;racism, partisanship,
and murder&quot; ignored the failing structure of NO BEFORE Katrina...  Has
the Press focused on this???  NO...  That is an ordinary dog bites man
story...  The made up news of murder is what the ran with and
prefered...

&gt;From reports I read, the mortgage was around $200,000...  If a 2,000

sq foot house is $500,000 then go figure a 3,000 sq foot house...
Even if their equity was only $250,000 this doesn't make them lower
middle class...  That both children were going to a private school
with a tuition of $20,000 each (not including scholarships or
discounts) tells me the parents have made some choices private schools
instead of insurance, a 3,000 foot house instead of insurance...

Are there no consequences to choices on how you spend your money???
Or is the deal here that the Frost's can spend there money for a 3,000
foot house and private schooling and then DEMAND that government give
them health insurance???  At what point does free health insurance
end???  Should any old Rockerfeller or Mellon expect free
insurance???

There are other issues here, example defining what a child is...  Is a
28 year old to be considered a child for SCHIP???  Of course these
questions are all ignored by the PR spin, pressure, and propaganda
that the Democrats are mounting to sign the bill now or be label a
&quot;child hater&quot;...  This is not unlike Katrina...  The Media scandalizes
the nation by claiming murder when there was none...  There was a
chance to fix a broken city, NO...  Claiming &quot;racism, partisanship,
and murder&quot; ignored the failing structure of NO BEFORE Katrina...  Has
the Press focused on this???  NO...  That is an ordinary dog bites man
story...  The made up news of murder is what the ran with and

The amount of the mortgage paid does have direct bearing to the loan
on the house...  I recall it was $1,200...  Now equity in a house is
value less the bank loan...  What a neighboring house sold for is an
indicator of home valuation --- it is the stock and trade of
appraisals...

And you ignore the larger point, the Frosts have choosen to have a
very large house, costly private education for two kids...  And then
they complain they also can not buy insurance...  They made their
choices...  Now if they lived in a smaller house or sent their kids to
public school, don't you think they could afford insurance???

The amount of the mortgage paid does have direct bearing to the loan
on the house...  I recall it was $1,200...  Now equity in a house is
value less the bank loan...  What a neighboring house sold for is an
indicator of home valuation --- it is the stock and trade of
appraisals...

Jgg,

Then just get to the simple, truthful God-Damn facts will you? Don't
inflate the value of the house by $200K in 24 hours, play games with
the words &quot;value&quot; and &quot;equity.&quot; Don't pretend to not understand what
the word &quot;scholarship&quot; means. Do you think they knew in advance when
they bought the damn house their kids would be injured or get sick?
What, they shoul;d turn down a fucking scholarship in order to send
their kids to a public school? WTF is wrong with you, use your head.

No matte, that is your DNC talking point...  You confuse truth,
debate, and spin, and then think it is the other side that is
confused...  Look for the confusion in yourself...

That I challedge your ignorance with fact and reason just makes you go

&gt; The amount of the mortgage paid does have direct bearing to the loan
&gt; on the house...  I recall it was $1,200...  Now equity in a house is

If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
or discounts...

You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)...  That is the point...
They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
insurance policies...

As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
choices, who is responsible???

Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt; the word &quot;scholarship&quot; means. Do you think they knew in advance when

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if their equity was only $250,000 this doesn't make them lower

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are there no consequences to choices on how you spend your money???
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is the deal here that the Frost's can spend there money for a 3,000

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are other issues here, example defining what a child is...  Is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 28 year old to be considered a child for SCHIP???  Of course these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions are all ignored by the PR spin, pressure, and propaganda
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the Democrats are mounting to sign the bill now or be label a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the nation by claiming murder when there was none...  There was a

If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
or discounts...

You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

...  That is the point...
They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
insurance policies...
Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago. There is
no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus health
insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these facts.

As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???
According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have gotten full
scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This isn't unusual for
this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to mention.

The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
choices, who is responsible???

Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do not qualify for
Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they have been denied
for pre-existing conditions twice) for other coverage. If they could get coverage (&amp; they
tried on their own, they would, as would many working class families. This is a safety net for
working families, not for the poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a family has insurance
through their employer or is covered in some other way, they would not qualify for this.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; today decided to embrace RedState and reward the blog with an

Jgg,

You know, or should at least, that the number of sf in a home is only
a factor in determining the value of a home. HOW is that square
footage used? How old is the house, how modern and up to date are the
electical, HVAC, plumbing systems? How big is the lot, how nice the
landscaping? Pool in the backyard? How many, how big and how modern
the bathrooms?  Same goes for bedrooms? Full basement, and is it
finished? And on and on.

No, I do not know the exact terms of the school scholarships. And
apparantly, neither do you.

&gt; If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&gt; &quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
&gt; cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
&gt; or discounts...

&gt; You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
&gt; sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
&gt; house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)...  That is the point...
&gt; They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
&gt; done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
&gt; obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
&gt; insurance policies...

&gt; As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt; scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt; tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt; The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt; available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt; choices, who is responsible???

&gt; Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
&gt; in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if their equity was only $250,000 this doesn't make them lower
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; middle class...  That both children were going to a private school
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a tuition of $20,000 each (not including scholarships or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discounts) tells me the parents have made some choices private schools
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of insurance, a 3,000 foot house instead of insurance...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are there no consequences to choices on how you spend your money???
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is the deal here that the Frost's can spend there money for a 3,000
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foot house and private schooling and then DEMAND that government give
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them health insurance???  At what point does free health insurance
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end???  Should any old Rockerfeller or Mellon expect free

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are other issues here, example defining what a child is...  Is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 28 year old to be considered a child for SCHIP???  Of course these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions are all ignored by the PR spin, pressure, and propaganda
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the Democrats are mounting to sign the bill now or be label a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;child hater&quot;...  This is not unlike Katrina...  The Media scandalizes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the nation by claiming murder when there was none...  There was a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chance to fix a broken city, NO...  Claiming &quot;racism, partisanship,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and murder&quot; ignored the failing structure of NO BEFORE Katrina...  Has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Press focused on this???  NO...  That is an ordinary dog bites man

1) Yes, sq footage is only one factor...  But in a neighborhoods where
$500,000 2,000 sq foot house, one can predict the value of a 3,000 sq
foot home...  So to you is there a difference if he has 250,000 equity
or 500,000 equity as it applies to the question I raised???  It should
NOT...

2) As to school tuition, even if 80% of the tuition has been by
scholarship or grant, that still leaves $8,000 -- which is sufficent
to buy insurance...  It is a matter of priorities...  Now of course if
you favor a free health care system for all, the answer to my question
is obvious...

3) The further you dig your heals in in defending the particilars of
the Frost's case, you of course ignore the main issue -- Should the
government pay for health insurance for those who could afford it but
choose to spend their money on a very large house or a private school
instead???  This quickly is not about need or compassion for the less
fortunate, but one of greed...

&gt; Jgg,

&gt; You know, or should at least, that the number of sf in a home is only
&gt; a factor in determining the value of a home. HOW is that square
&gt; footage used? How old is the house, how modern and up to date are the
&gt; electical, HVAC, plumbing systems? How big is the lot, how nice the
&gt; landscaping? Pool in the backyard? How many, how big and how modern
&gt; the bathrooms?  Same goes for bedrooms? Full basement, and is it
&gt; finished? And on and on.

&gt; No, I do not know the exact terms of the school scholarships. And
&gt; apparantly, neither do you.

&gt; &gt; If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&gt; &gt; &quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
&gt; &gt; cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
&gt; &gt; or discounts...

&gt; &gt; You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
&gt; &gt; sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
&gt; &gt; house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)...  That is the point...
&gt; &gt; They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
&gt; &gt; done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
&gt; &gt; obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
&gt; &gt; insurance policies...

&gt; &gt; As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt; &gt; scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt; &gt; tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt; &gt; The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt; &gt; available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt; &gt; choices, who is responsible???

&gt; &gt; Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
&gt; &gt; in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt; Jgg,

&gt; You know, or should at least, that the number of sf in a home is only
&gt; a factor in determining the value of a home. HOW is that square
&gt; footage used? How old is the house, how modern and up to date are the
&gt; electical, HVAC, plumbing systems? How big is the lot, how nice the
&gt; landscaping? Pool in the backyard? How many, how big and how modern
&gt; the bathrooms?  Same goes for bedrooms? Full basement, and is it
&gt; finished? And on and on.

&gt; No, I do not know the exact terms of the school scholarships. And
&gt; apparantly, neither do you.

If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
or discounts...

You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

...  That is the point...
They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
insurance policies...

Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago. There is

no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus health

insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these facts.

As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have gotten full

scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This isn't unusual for

this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to mention.

The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
choices, who is responsible???

Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do not qualify for

Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they have been denied

for pre-existing conditions twice) for other coverage. If they could get coverage (&amp; they

tried on their own, they would, as would many working class families. This is a safety net for

working families, not for the poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a family has insurance

through their employer or is covered in some other way, they would not qualify for this.

Insurance is a much abused system by all players -- the government,

are best discussed with the poster examples of abuse by all
sides...

Look, most everyone seeks to game the system --- the rich, the poor,
the middleclass, most everyone...  I have done taxes for 30 years and
have seen all type game the system-- it is human nature...  Political
poster cases are no different...  Still basic questions remain
unanswered...  Why???  The &quot;public debate&quot; often isn't over facts or
policy by emotive narative...

Still my basic question remains --  Who should get free health
insurance???

&gt; If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&gt; &quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
&gt; cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
&gt; or discounts...

&gt; You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
&gt; sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
&gt; house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

&gt; ...  That is the point...
&gt; They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
&gt; done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
&gt; obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
&gt; insurance policies...

&gt; Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago. There is

&gt; no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus health

&gt; insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these facts.

&gt; As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt; scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt; tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt; According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have gotten full

&gt; scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This isn't unusual for

&gt; this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to mention.

&gt; The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt; available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt; choices, who is responsible???

&gt; Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
&gt; in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt; No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do not qualify for

&gt; Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they have been denied

&gt; for pre-existing conditions twice) for other coverage. If they could get coverage (&amp; they

&gt; tried on their own, they would, as would many working class families. This is a safety net for

jgg,

Greed? Why are you apparantly a lot more concerned about the profits
of insurance companies than the health and welfare of all Americans?
Fuck the insurance companies, we should have a single payer
nationalized health care program such as the majority of &quot;1st world&quot;
modern countries. Are you trying to say that American are just too
stupid to figure it out and make it work? That our government is
simply dumber, more corrupt and ineffecient than most other countries?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would hire a team of PIs and find out exactly how much their parents made

Still my basic question remains --  Who should get free health

he system doesn't provide AFFORDABLE health insurance to everyone. THAT is the
problem. If it did, you wouldn't have cases of working families who can't afford coverage.

If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
or discounts...

You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

...  That is the point...
They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
insurance policies...

Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.
here is

no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus
ealth

insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these
acts.

As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have
otten full

scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This
sn't unusual for

this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to
ention.

The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
choices, who is responsible???

Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do not
ualify for

Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they have
een denied

for pre-existing conditions twice) for other coverage. If they could get
overage (&amp; they

tried on their own, they would, as would many working class families. This is
safety net for

working families, not for the poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a family
as insurance

through their employer or is covered in some other way, they would not qualify
or this.

Look, there is alot of greed in the system...  Greed of profits is
just one...  Greed to overuse free services by individuals is
another...  Greed to overbill by doctors is a third...  Greed of power
to &quot;control&quot; the system by the government is a fourth...  Greed of
money and fame by lawyers filing false or baseless claims is a
fifth...

You focus on just one of the &quot;greeds&quot;...  I have seen abusive behavior

health care--  then address all the greeds within the system..

&gt; &gt; sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
&gt; &gt; house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)...  That is the point...
&gt; &gt; They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
&gt; &gt; done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
&gt; &gt; obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
&gt; &gt; insurance policies...

&gt; &gt; As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt; &gt; scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt; &gt; tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt; &gt; The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt; &gt; available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt; &gt; choices, who is responsible???

&gt; &gt; Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
&gt; &gt; in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt; &gt;&gt; Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.

&gt; here is no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage
&gt; ersus health insurance.
&gt; What is the mortgage??? I read $1,200 a month...  If so, the current
&gt; ortgage on the house is far more than $55,000...  Was there a
&gt; efinancing???  What was the refinancing for???  Business??? to fix up
&gt; he house???  Medical???  Vacations???&gt;&gt;&gt; This is healthcare for those who do not qualify for Medicaid &amp; who do not

&gt; ualify (as is the case in this family, where they have been denied for
&gt; re-existing conditions twice) for other coverage.
&gt; When did they try???  After the accident when preexisting conditions
&gt; xisted or before the fact???  How does the auto insurance fit in
&gt; ere???  Was the pre-existing condition due to health insurance
&gt; efinations (relating to new borns) or was it due to the Frosts not
&gt; eeking coverage befre the fact???&gt;&gt;&gt; If they could get coverage (&amp; they tried on their own, they would, as would

&gt; any working class families. This is a safety net for working families, not for
&gt; he poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a family has insurance through their
&gt; mployer or is covered in some other way, they would not qualify for this.
&gt; Insurance is a much abused system by all players -- the government,
&gt; he doctors, the insurance companies, and individuals...  These issues
&gt; re best discussed with the poster examples of abuse by all
&gt; ides...
&gt; Look, most everyone seeks to game the system --- the rich, the poor,
&gt; he middleclass, most everyone...  I have done taxes for 30 years and
&gt; ave seen all type game the system-- it is human nature...  Political
&gt; oster cases are no different...  Still basic questions remain
&gt; nanswered...  Why???  The &quot;public debate&quot; often isn't over facts or
&gt; olicy by emotive narative...
&gt; Still my basic question remains --  Who should get free health
&gt; nsurance???
&gt; he system doesn't provide AFFORDABLE health insurance to everyone. THAT is the
&gt; problem. If it did, you wouldn't have cases of working families who can't afford coverage.

&gt;  If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&gt;  &quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
&gt;  cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
&gt;  or discounts...

&gt;  You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
&gt;  sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000

&gt; here is

&gt;  no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus
&gt; ealth

&gt;  insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these
&gt; acts.

&gt;  As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt;  scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt;  tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt;  According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have
&gt; otten full

&gt;  scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This
&gt; sn't unusual for

&gt;  this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to
&gt; ention.

&gt;  The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt;  available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt;  choices, who is responsible???

&gt;  Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone

&gt;  No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do not

Look, there is alot of greed in the system...  Greed of profits is
just one...  Greed to overuse free services by individuals is
another...  Greed to overbill by doctors is a third...  Greed of power
to &quot;control&quot; the system by the government is a fourth...  Greed of
money and fame by lawyers filing false or baseless claims is a
fifth...

You focus on just one of the &quot;greeds&quot;...  I have seen abusive behavior
by all the players within the health care system...  You want better
health care--  then address all the greeds within the system..

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you trying to say that American are just too stupid to figure it out and
make it work? That our government is simply dumber, more corrupt and ineffecient
than most other countries?

Socialized medicine has its own set of major problems and issues...
Bad or delayed health care is one of these...
And yet, those countries with so-called &quot;socialized medicine&quot; have better quality outcomes
than we do in the USA, with all of our high-tech bells &amp; whistles. Care to try to explain that?

&gt;&gt; Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.

here is no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage
ersus health insurance.
What is the mortgage??? I read $1,200 a month...  If so, the current
ortgage on the house is far more than $55,000...  Was there a
efinancing???  What was the refinancing for???  Business??? to fix up
he house???  Medical???  Vacations???&gt;&gt;&gt; This is healthcare for those who do
ot qualify for Medicaid &amp; who do not

ualify (as is the case in this family, where they have been denied for
re-existing conditions twice) for other coverage.
When did they try???  After the accident when preexisting conditions
xisted or before the fact???  How does the auto insurance fit in
ere???  Was the pre-existing condition due to health insurance
efinations (relating to new borns) or was it due to the Frosts not
eeking coverage befre the fact???&gt;&gt;&gt; If they could get coverage (&amp; they tried
n their own, they would, as would

any working class families. This is a safety net for working families, not for
he poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a family has insurance through
heir
mployer or is covered in some other way, they would not qualify for this.
Insurance is a much abused system by all players -- the government,
he doctors, the insurance companies, and individuals...  These issues
re best discussed with the poster examples of abuse by all
ides...
Look, most everyone seeks to game the system --- the rich, the poor,
he middleclass, most everyone...  I have done taxes for 30 years and
ave seen all type game the system-- it is human nature...  Political
oster cases are no different...  Still basic questions remain
nanswered...  Why???  The &quot;public debate&quot; often isn't over facts or
olicy by emotive narative...
Still my basic question remains --  Who should get free health
nsurance???
he system doesn't provide AFFORDABLE health insurance to everyone. THAT is the
problem. If it did, you wouldn't have cases of working families who can't
fford coverage.

If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
or discounts...

You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

...  That is the point...
They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is

Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.
here is

no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus
ealth

insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these
acts.

As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have
otten full

scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This
sn't unusual for

this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to
ention.

The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
choices, who is responsible???

Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone

No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do not

Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they have

overage (&amp; they

safety net for

working families, not for the poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a
amily
as insurance

through their employer or is covered in some other way, they would not
ualify
or this.

jgg,

Yes, I agree that there is plenty of greed to go around, didn't
realize I was required to list ALL of them.
Bad care? Many of the countries that have &quot;socialized&quot; medical care.
have better health care in any way that you would care to measure it.
Better longevity, lesser infant mortality rates, less a lot of things.
How would you like to measure &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse?&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; we should have a single payer nationalized health care program

And this is the lens you see the debate through.   The problem here is
in seeking for a solution, your are ignoring part of the root problem
-- greed and gaming the system by individuals, government officals,
politicans, doctors, non-profits, among others...  Take nursing home
costs -- a rising cost item...  There would be several ways to reduce
costs by over 75%...  Why is it not done???  Which families are
willing to have their parents stay at home when it become costly or
inconvenient???  Especially when Medicare will pay for it...

Or take drug research...  It is true that much of the research costs
is being paid for by higher drug prices in the US...  Go to Canada you
say???  Except Canada buys them from the Manufacturers and if Canada
makes that their policy, Canadan prices  go up...  So who is to pay
for new drugs???

Or take the over prescription of antiboitics...  A serious issue that
will result in some micros to become drug resistent...  Simple
solution is keep the kids home for the common flu or cold...  But both
parents and the schools have a vested interest in NOT keeping the kids
home when they are sick, and so the parents DEMAND medication and
drugs, have an office visit just so someone else's non medical vested
interest is given prioority...  And this costs the system billions...

There are other cases, as the law in Tennessee which forces the
insurance companies to pay a hospital bill (before discounts) even if
the bill is discounted (this easily runs into thousands in each
case)...

Or the case where a Medicare employee or regulation demands a patient
be released from the hospital only to be readmitted a day later (when
all know the patient would recover faster if left in the hospital)...

than we do in the USA, with all of our high-tech bells &amp; whistles.
Care to try to explain that?

I believe one study showed &quot;witch doctors&quot; had a better rate of sucess
than most head doctors...  Shall we import them???

One reason is that when lawyers sue, they demand &quot;best medical
practice&quot;...  If it is not used than the patient gets more money...
It is cheaper to use more &quot;bells and whistles&quot; than to go to court...
So more &quot;bells and whisles&quot; are used...

And I do question you claim of better outcomes...  Now we do need to
focus more on preventive care in our system...

&gt; Look, there is alot of greed in the system...  Greed of profits is
&gt; just one...  Greed to overuse free services by individuals is
&gt; another...  Greed to overbill by doctors is a third...  Greed of power
&gt; to &quot;control&quot; the system by the government is a fourth...  Greed of
&gt; money and fame by lawyers filing false or baseless claims is a
&gt; fifth...

&gt; You focus on just one of the &quot;greeds&quot;...  I have seen abusive behavior
&gt; by all the players within the health care system...  You want better
&gt; health care--  then address all the greeds within the system..

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Are you trying to say that American are just too stupid to figure it out and
&gt; make it work? That our government is simply dumber, more corrupt and ineffecient
&gt; than most other countries?

&gt; Socialized medicine has its own set of major problems and issues...
&gt; Bad or delayed health care is one of these...
&gt; And yet, those countries with so-called &quot;socialized medicine&quot; have better quality outcomes

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
&gt; &gt; &gt; cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
&gt; &gt; &gt; or discounts...

&gt; &gt; &gt; You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
&gt; &gt; &gt; sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
&gt; &gt; &gt; house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)...  That is the point...
&gt; &gt; &gt; They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
&gt; &gt; &gt; done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
&gt; &gt; &gt; insurance policies...

&gt; &gt; &gt; As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt; &gt; &gt; scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt; &gt; &gt; tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt; &gt; &gt; The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt; &gt; &gt; available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt; &gt; &gt; choices, who is responsible???

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt; ilary solutin is requiring all to be insured...  is that what you

&gt;  &gt;&gt; Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.

&gt;  here is no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage
&gt;  ersus health insurance.
&gt;  What is the mortgage??? I read $1,200 a month...  If so, the current
&gt;  ortgage on the house is far more than $55,000...  Was there a

&gt;  he house???  Medical???  Vacations???&gt;&gt;&gt; This is healthcare for those who do
&gt; ot qualify for Medicaid &amp; who do not

&gt;  ualify (as is the case in this family, where they have been denied for
&gt;  re-existing conditions twice) for other coverage.
&gt;  When did they try???  After the accident when preexisting conditions
&gt;  xisted or before the fact???  How does the auto insurance fit in
&gt;  ere???  Was the pre-existing condition due to health insurance
&gt;  efinations (relating to new borns) or was it due to the Frosts not
&gt;  eeking coverage befre the fact???&gt;&gt;&gt; If they could get coverage (&amp; they tried
&gt; n their own, they would, as would

&gt;  any working class families. This is a safety net for working families, not for
&gt;  he poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a family has insurance through
&gt; heir
&gt;  mployer or is covered in some other way, they would not qualify for this.
&gt;  Insurance is a much abused system by all players -- the government,
&gt;  he doctors, the insurance companies, and individuals...  These issues
&gt;  re best discussed with the poster examples of abuse by all
&gt;  ides...
&gt;  Look, most everyone seeks to game the system --- the rich, the poor,
&gt;  he middleclass, most everyone...  I have done taxes for 30 years and
&gt;  ave seen all type game the system-- it is human nature...  Political
&gt;  oster cases are no different...  Still basic questions remain
&gt;  nanswered...  Why???  The &quot;public debate&quot; often isn't over facts or
&gt;  olicy by emotive narative...
&gt;  Still my basic question remains --  Who should get free health
&gt;  nsurance???
&gt;  he system doesn't provide AFFORDABLE health insurance to everyone. THAT is the
&gt;  problem. If it did, you wouldn't have cases of working families who can't
&gt; fford coverage.

&gt;   If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&gt;   &quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
&gt;   cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
&gt;   or discounts...

&gt;   You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
&gt;   sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
&gt;   house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

&gt;   ...  That is the point...
&gt;   They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
&gt;   done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
&gt;   obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
&gt;   insurance policies...

&gt;   Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.
&gt;  here is

&gt;   no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus
&gt;  ealth

&gt;   insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these
&gt;  acts.

&gt;   As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt;   scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt;   tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt;   According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have
&gt;  otten full

&gt;   scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This
&gt;  sn't unusual for

&gt;   this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to
&gt;  ention.

&gt;   The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt;   available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt;   choices, who is responsible???

&gt;   Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
&gt;   in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt;   No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do not
&gt;  ualify for

&gt;   Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they have
&gt;  een denied

&gt;   for pre-existing conditions twice) for other coverage. If they could get
&gt;  overage (&amp; they

&gt;   tried on their own, they would, as would many working class families. This is
&gt;   safety net for

&gt;   working families, not for the poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a
&gt; amily

&gt;&gt;&gt; we should have a single payer nationalized health care program
">

And this is the lens you see the debate through.   The problem here is
in seeking for a solution, your are ignoring part of the root problem
-- greed and gaming the system by individuals, government officals,
politicans, doctors, non-profits, among others...  Take nursing home
costs -- a rising cost item...  There would be several ways to reduce
costs by over 75%...  Why is it not done???  Which families are
willing to have their parents stay at home when it become costly or
inconvenient???  Especially when Medicare will pay for it...
Are you saying that Medicare will pay for a family member to stay @ home? If so,
you are VERY MISTAKEN. As for what Medicare pays for in the nursing home, it pays
for REHAB ONLY. Once the patient has completed REHAB, Medicare will NOT PAY.

Or take drug research...  It is true that much of the research costs
is being paid for by higher drug prices in the US...  Go to Canada you
say???  Except Canada buys them from the Manufacturers and if Canada
makes that their policy, Canadan prices  go up...  So who is to pay
for new drugs???
Ask yourself how much of the cost of drugs is for ADVERSTISEMENT.

Or take the over prescription of antiboitics...  A serious issue that
will result in some micros to become drug resistent...  Simple
solution is keep the kids home for the common flu or cold...  But both
parents and the schools have a vested interest in NOT keeping the kids
home when they are sick,
Parents have a &quot;vested interest&quot;? In many, many families, BOTH parents work out of
necessity. What do you propose?
and so the parents DEMAND medication and drugs, have an office visit just so someone else's
non medical vested interest is given prioority...  And this costs the system billions...
It's not just parents &quot;demanding medications&quot; that is a problem. Americans DEMAND
medications for everything that ails them, from antibiotics for virus infections (which won't
work - they only work on bacterial infections, &amp; now, due to over-utilization, we have
&quot;super-bugs&quot;) to drugs for enhanced sexual performance (sure, all of the men using Viagra,
Cialis, etc., are impotence - &amp; I was born just yesterday).

There are other cases, as the law in Tennessee which forces the
insurance companies to pay a hospital bill (before discounts) even if
the bill is discounted (this easily runs into thousands in each
case)...
What law is this? Is it Medicaid? Because the law can't force private insurance companies
to pay in any particular way. They pay based on contracts negotiated with hospitals.

Or the case where a Medicare employee or regulation demands a patient
be released from the hospital only to be readmitted a day later (when
all know the patient would recover faster if left in the hospital)...
A Medicare employee cannot demand that a patient be discharged from the hospital. That is
against Medicare law. Even if the DRG states it allows 3 days, if the patient requires 5
days, they get 5 days. The hospital &quot;eats&quot; the extra days. Medicare cannot DEMAND
that the patient be discharged early. Same thing works in the PPS (Prospective Payment
System).

One reason is that when lawyers sue, they demand &quot;best medical
ractice&quot;...  If it is not used than the patient gets more money...
t is cheaper to use more &quot;bells and whistles&quot; than to go to court...
o more &quot;bells and whisles&quot; are used...
And I do question you claim of better outcomes...  Now we do need to
ocus more on preventive care in our system...

Question my claim all you want. I'm a BSN &amp; I've worked in CQI for nearly all of my
25+ year career as an RN. I'm willing to wager that I've done much more research into
this than you have.

Look, there is alot of greed in the system...  Greed of profits is
just one...  Greed to overuse free services by individuals is
another...  Greed to overbill by doctors is a third...  Greed of power
to &quot;control&quot; the system by the government is a fourth...  Greed of
money and fame by lawyers filing false or baseless claims is a
fifth...

You focus on just one of the &quot;greeds&quot;...  I have seen abusive behavior
by all the players within the health care system...  You want better
health care--  then address all the greeds within the system..

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you trying to say that American are just too stupid to figure it out
nd
make it work? That our government is simply dumber, more corrupt and
neffecient
than most other countries?

Socialized medicine has its own set of major problems and issues...
Bad or delayed health care is one of these...
And yet, those countries with so-called &quot;socialized medicine&quot; have better
uality outcomes
than we do in the USA, with all of our high-tech bells &amp; whistles. Care to try
o explain that?

&gt;&gt; Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.

here is no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage
ersus health insurance.
What is the mortgage??? I read $1,200 a month...  If so, the current
ortgage on the house is far more than $55,000...  Was there a
efinancing???  What was the refinancing for???  Business??? to fix up
he house???  Medical???  Vacations???&gt;&gt;&gt; This is healthcare for those who do
ot qualify for Medicaid &amp; who do not

ualify (as is the case in this family, where they have been denied for
re-existing conditions twice) for other coverage.
When did they try???  After the accident when preexisting conditions
xisted or before the fact???  How does the auto insurance fit in
ere???  Was the pre-existing condition due to health insurance
efinations (relating to new borns) or was it due to the Frosts not
eeking coverage befre the fact???&gt;&gt;&gt; If they could get coverage (&amp; they tried
n their own, they would, as would

any working class families. This is a safety net for working families, not
or
he poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a family has insurance through
heir
mployer or is covered in some other way, they would not qualify for this.
Insurance is a much abused system by all players -- the government,
he doctors, the insurance companies, and individuals...  These issues
re best discussed with the poster examples of abuse by all
ides...
Look, most everyone seeks to game the system --- the rich, the poor,
he middleclass, most everyone...  I have done taxes for 30 years and
ave seen all type game the system-- it is human nature...  Political
oster cases are no different...  Still basic questions remain
nanswered...  Why???  The &quot;public debate&quot; often isn't over facts or
olicy by emotive narative...
Still my basic question remains --  Who should get free health
nsurance???
he system doesn't provide AFFORDABLE health insurance to everyone. THAT is
he
problem. If it did, you wouldn't have cases of working families who can't
fford coverage.

If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
or discounts...

You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

...  That is the point...
They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
insurance policies...

Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.
here is

no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus
ealth

insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these
acts.

As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have
otten full

scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This
sn't unusual for

this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to
ention.

The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
choices, who is responsible???

Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do
ot
ualify for

Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they
ave
een denied

overage (&amp; they

tried on their own, they would, as would many working class families. This
s
safety net for

working families, not for the poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a
amily

through their employer or is covered in some other way, they would not
ualify
or this.

And what about these folks who choose not to buy insurance, and then
have a catastropic injury or folks who choose to spend money first our
big houses and then complain they can't afford insurance???

The average size of a home home has grown by leaps and bounds since
the 1960's...

So affordable in what context???  Afford insurance is a great slogan
but until you clearly define what affordable means (what does a fellow
have to give up) it means little...  Clearly basic food requirements
is NOT what you should have to give up...  But to ask someone to live
in a 1400 sq house instead of a 2000 sq foot house is another issue...

&gt;    If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&gt;    &quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
&gt;    cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
&gt;    or discounts...

&gt;    You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
&gt;    sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
&gt;    house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

&gt;    ...  That is the point...
&gt;    They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
&gt;    done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
&gt;    obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
&gt;    insurance policies...

&gt;    Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.
&gt;   here is

&gt;    no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus
&gt;   ealth

&gt;    insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these
&gt;   acts.

&gt;    As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt;    scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt;    tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt;    According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have
&gt;   otten full

&gt;    scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This
&gt;   sn't unusual for

&gt;    this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to
&gt;   ention.

&gt;    The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt;    available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt;    choices, who is responsible???

&gt;    Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
&gt;    in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt;    No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do
&gt; ot
&gt;   ualify for

&gt;    Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they
&gt; ave

No you did...  There are working poor who can afford insurance (or to
afford it, they have to give food or heat or rent)...  The issues here
are not just about them but the structure of health care...

1) Insurance works when risk is spread out.  For health insurance this
means among the healthy and sick...  A significant percentage of the
healthy &quot;save money&quot; by not getting insurance...  This is why Hillary
devised her plan to mandidate health insurance...

2) The cost of medicine springs from many causes, some we can
influence -- doctor fraud, HMO fraud, ill advised Medicare
regulations, misuse of medical resources by individuals, the entire
&quot;Medical Records&quot; issues, out of control lawyers who sue so their
income can be higher when there is no serious suit, and lack of focus
on preventive medicine  are among those fixable...

3) Unless you seek a comprehensive fix, medical costs will still go
up...  If it is government or HMO run and it starts to cost to much,
services and availibility will be cut (as in all countries with
government run programs)

But the Democrats here want to do a piecemeal government run plan step
by step  and in doing so create a far worse monster than we have
today...

&gt;   ilary solutin is requiring all to be insured...  is that what you
&gt;   ropose???
&gt;   AFFORDABLE, not FREE. There is a difference. Health insurance should be
&gt;  FFORDABLE
&gt;   for everyone. Why is that so awful???

&gt;    &gt;&gt; Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.

&gt;    here is no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage
&gt;    ersus health insurance.
&gt;    What is the mortgage??? I read $1,200 a month...  If so, the current
&gt;    ortgage on the house is far more than $55,000...  Was there a
&gt;    efinancing???  What was the refinancing for???  Business??? to fix up
&gt;    he house???  Medical???  Vacations???&gt;&gt;&gt; This is healthcare for those who do
&gt;   ot qualify for Medicaid &amp; who do not

&gt;    ualify (as is the case in this family, where they have been denied for
&gt;    re-existing conditions twice) for other coverage.
&gt;    When did they try???  After the accident when preexisting conditions
&gt;    xisted or before the fact???  How does the auto insurance fit in
&gt;    ere???  Was the pre-existing condition due to health insurance
&gt;    efinations (relating to new borns) or was it due to the Frosts not
&gt;    eeking coverage befre the fact???&gt;&gt;&gt; If they could get coverage (&amp; they
&gt; ried
&gt;   n their own, they would, as would

&gt;    any working class families. This is a safety net for working families, not
&gt;  or
&gt;    he poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a family has insurance through
&gt;   heir
&gt;    mployer or is covered in some other way, they would not qualify for this.
&gt;    Insurance is a much abused system by all players -- the government,
&gt;    he doctors, the insurance companies, and individuals...  These issues
&gt;    re best discussed with the poster examples of abuse by all
&gt;    ides...
&gt;    Look, most everyone seeks to game the system --- the rich, the poor,
&gt;    he middleclass, most everyone...  I have done taxes for 30 years and
&gt;    ave seen all type game the system-- it is human nature...  Political
&gt;    oster cases are no different...  Still basic questions remain
&gt;    nanswered...  Why???  The &quot;public debate&quot; often isn't over facts or
&gt;    olicy by emotive narative...
&gt;    Still my basic question remains --  Who should get free health
&gt;    nsurance???
&gt;    he system doesn't provide AFFORDABLE health insurance to everyone. THAT is
&gt;  he
&gt;    problem. If it did, you wouldn't have cases of working families who can't
&gt;   fford coverage.

&gt;     If you go back to my first post on this issue, I pointed out the
&gt;     &quot;facts&quot;...  The 2,000 sq foot house for $500,000...  I pointed out the
&gt;     cost of the private school acknowledgeing there might be scholarships
&gt;     or discounts...

&gt;     You buy insurance for the very possibility someone is injured or gets
&gt;     sick...  Why did NOT the buy insurance instead of a $700,000- 500,000
&gt;     house (taking out about a $200,000 mortgage)

&gt;     ...  That is the point...
&gt;     They made a choice...  Not buying insurance when you are healthy is
&gt;     done all the time...  Only after illness does one think the
&gt;     obvious...  Which is why they have the pre-existing clause in
&gt;     insurance policies...

&gt;     Fact is that they bought the house for around $55K quite a few years ago.
&gt;    here is

&gt;     no mortgage ofr $200K. So, there was no decision made for a mortgage versus
&gt;    ealth

&gt;     insurance. Those trashing this family conveniently forget to mention these
&gt;    acts.

&gt;     As to the school, did both kids get full scholarships or partial
&gt;     scholarships????  If partial, was the Frost's share of the $40,000
&gt;     tuition $30,000, $20,000, $15,000, $5,000???  Do you know???

&gt;     According to the research that was done &amp; that I have read, both kids have
&gt;    otten full

&gt;     scholarships, because of their injuries &amp; their financial situations. This
&gt;    sn't unusual for

&gt;     this particular school. Another thing those trashing the family forget to
&gt;    ention.

&gt;     The point again is the Frost made choices on how to spend their
&gt;     available money...  When a kid gets sicks after parents make bad
&gt;     choices, who is responsible???

&gt;     Now if you favor free medical, the answer is clear...  Should someone
&gt;     in the upper middle class have free medical insurance???

&gt;     No one is advocating free healthcare. This is healthcare for those who do
&gt;  ot
&gt;    ualify for

&gt;     Medicaid &amp; who do not qualify (as is the case in this family, where they
&gt;  ave
&gt;    een denied

&gt;     for pre-existing conditions twice) for other coverage. If they could get
&gt;    overage (&amp; they

&gt;     tried on their own, they would, as would many working class families. This
&gt;  s
&gt;     safety net for

&gt;     working families, not for the poor, as Bush has mistakenly stated. If a
&gt;   amily
&gt;    as insurance

&gt;     through their employer or is covered in some other way, they would not
&gt;   ualify
&gt;    or this.
