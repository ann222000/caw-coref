Recently someone called me from one of the &quot;Out on the Floor Offices&quot;,
an ethereal place rumored to exist only in hyperspace, populated by
mysterious beings called Users.

She was quite frantic.  She was having trouble running a program
through the computer, and her message was clear enough, although rather
ill-conceived:  &quot;MY FILES ARE FULL!&quot;

I furrowed my brow, lit a smoke, and explained to her, &quot;Really now,
Miss Butterman, I don't have time for this.&quot;  I slowly exhaled the
menthol vapors as I stopped her process, crushing any hopes she may
have had of ever again seeing that document she had spent three hours
slaving over.

&quot;I was typing this REALLY important letter, and it HAS to be ready in
an hour...  there's all this stuff on my screen that I didn't type...
it says something about an error, should I read it to you?&quot;

&quot;No point.  Just press return.&quot;

&quot;Oh my, it wants my username.  Can I restart that where I left off?&quot;

&quot;Not a chance.&quot;  I drew another puff and tossed the phone aside.  It
occurred to me that if I had to hear one more of those whining
complaint sessions, heads were going to roll.  Where do you people GET
this stuff?  I'm going to tell you what's really going on here.  Now
LISTEN UP.  I'm not going over this a second time:

{point Computer} The black box that does your work for you.
That's all you need to know.

{point Response Time} Usually measured in nanoseconds;
sometimes measured in calendar months.  The general rule is:
Shut up your complaining about response time.

{point Hardware }  See &quot;Computer.&quot;  Again, not your concern.

{point Software} If we want you to know, we'll tell you about
it, otherwise, leave us alone.

{point Network} Don't worry about it, we'll take care of it.
Use it to send mail among your half-wit selves, and don't
think we won't read it all.  What do you think we do all day?
By the way, Butterman...  shame about your mother's pancreas.

{point Data} The general rule is:  Don't use any data files
and if you find any, delete them before I find out about
them.  In fact, just stay off the computer.  (See &quot;Response
Time&quot;)

{point System Crash} Don't ever call the system manager to
tell him you think the computer is down.  Don't call him to
ask him when it will be up again.  The more you bother him,
the longer it takes.

{point Downtime} Like I said, don't ask.

{point Uptime} Be thankful for it, use it wisely, and get out
of my face.

{point Overtime} Don't be ridiculous.

{point Vacation} A time during which I don't have to put up
with your sniveling.  Don't try calling.  There's no point.

{point Computer Room} Keep out, you're not invited.  Don't
knock on the door -- don't even think about it.  I broke the
phone last time one of you jerks called me, and I'm not about
to replace it.  And keep your greasy fingers off the windows.

{point My Office} The name says it all...  it's mine; stay
out.

{point Your Problems} The name says it all...

{point Deadlines} The general rule is:  Deadlines are not
acknowledged by me; they're not my responsibility.  Go tell
someone who cares.
{point Maintenance} a) A valid reason for shutting down the system at any time.
b) Much more important than anything any of you bozos do.
c) Anything I choose to call &quot;maintenance&quot; is maintenance.

{point Software Upgrades} Far too complex for you to
comprehend.  If I tell you I'm upgrading the system, just be
quietly thankful.  It's for your own good, even if it does
mean extensive downtime during peak hours.

{point Electronic Mail} I delete it before it's read, so
don't bother sending any to me.

{point Defaults} We like them just like they are; we chose
them for a reason.  Don't mess with them; consider them
mandatory.

{point Error Messages} I'm not interested.  I'm going to kill
your process anyway, so keep them to yourself.
{point Killing your Process} a) Don't ever ask why.
b) Beyond your control.
c) No warnings are given.
d) The highlight of my day.
e) If you call, it's going to happen.  No exceptions.

{point Passwords} I reserve the right to change them without
notice at any time.  I choose them, and the more you bother
me, the more degrading yours will be.  (Example:  BUTTERMAN:
SNOTFACE)
{point Users} a) They slow down the computer.
b) They waste my time.
c) A general nuisance.
d) Worse than that, actually.

{point Software Modifications} You don't know what you want
-- we'll tell you what you want.  It stays like it is.
Period.

{point Privileges} I've got them, you don't need them.  Enough
said.

{point Priority} Mine is higher than yours, accept it.  That's
the reason my games run faster than your lousy accounting
package (See &quot;Response Time&quot;).
{point Terminals} Before calling me with a terminal problem, consider this:
a) Are you prepared to do without one for weeks?
b) Do you REALLY want your process killed?
c) Did you just trip over the cord again?
d) Of course you did.

{point Disk Space} I set the quotas, you live with them.  If
you need more space, check &quot;Data Files&quot;.

{point Operator} I hired him and I trained him.  He does what
I tell him to.  Usually armed; always dangerous.

{point Backups} A good idea if I gave a shit, which of course
I don't.

{point Lunch} The only time that calling my office won't
result in the killing of your process.

{point Data Security} That's your problem.  I'm certainly not
going to lose any sleep over it.  My files are locked up
tight.  I feel secure.

{point Jiffy} Length of time it takes me to resolve your
problem by killing your process.

{point Eternity} Length of time it takes me to give a shit
about any problem that can't be resolved by killing your
process.
{point Impossible} a) It can't be done (as far as you know).
b) I can't be bothered.
c) You're starting to annoy me.

{point Inevitable} a) Couldn't have been avoided.
b) Not my fault (as far as you know).
c) The result of annoying me.

{point Menus} If it's not on the menu, don't ask for it.  It's
not available.  If it is on the menu, it's probably of no use
or it doesn't work.  We're working on it (See &quot;Eternity&quot;).

{point Utilities} I find them quite useful, you'll find them
quite inaccessible.  Besides, they're not on your menu, are
they.  What did I tell you about that?

{point Nuisance} You.

Of course, I reserve the right to add, change, or remove anything from
the above list.  I'm not asking you to accept these matters without
question, I'm telling you.

Now that we all know where we stand, I'm sure there'll be no future
problems.  If you have any questions or comments please feel free to
keep them to yourself.  If you feel the need for more information, I
highly recommend that you ask someone else.
Sincerely,
The System Manager

P.S.  The new disk quota of 30 blocks per user became effective
yesterday.  Anyone caught exceeding the quota will lose their accounts
(this means you, Butterman!).
