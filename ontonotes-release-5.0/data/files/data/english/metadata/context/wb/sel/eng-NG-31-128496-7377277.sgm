This is an excerpt of the above noted writing of a frenchman who wrote
this 450 years ago.

How true this is even today.

Poor, wretched, and stupid peoples, nations determined on your own
misfortune and blind to your own good! You let yourselves be deprived
before your own eyes of the best part of your revenues; your fields
are plundered, your homes robbed, your family heirlooms taken away.
You live in such a way that you cannot claim a single thing as your
own; and it would seem that you consider yourselves lucky to be loaned
your property, your families, and your very lives. All this havoc,
this misfortune, this ruin, descends upon you not from alien foes, but
from the one enemy whom you yourselves render as powerful as he is,
for whom you go bravely to war, for whose "greatness" you do not
refuse to offer your own bodies unto death. He who thus domineers over
you has only two eyes, only two hands, only one body, no more than is
possessed by the least man among the infinite numbers dwelling in your
cities; he has indeed nothing more than the power that you confer upon
him to destroy you. Where has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you,
if you do not provide them yourselves? How can he have so many arms to
beat you with, if he does not borrow them from you? The feet that
trample down your cities, where does he get them if they are not your
own? How does he have any power over you except through you? How would
he dare assail you if he had no cooperation from you? What could he do
to you if you yourselves did not connive with the thief who plunders
you, if you were not accomplices of the murderer who kills you, if you
were not traitors to yourselves? You sow your crops in order that he
may ravage them, you install and furnish your homes to give him goods
to pillage; you rear your daughters that he may gratify his lust; you
bring up your children in order that he may confer upon them the
greatest "privilege" he knows - to be led into his battles, to be
delivered to butchery, to be made the servants of his greed and the
instruments of his vengeance; you yield your bodies unto hard labor in
order that he may indulge in his delights and wallow in his filthy
pleasures; you weaken yourselves in order to make him the stronger and
the mightier to hold you in check. From all these indignities, such as
the very beasts of the field would not endure, you can deliver
yourselves if you try, not by taking action, but merely by willing to
be free. Resolve to serve no more, and you are at once freed. I do not
ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but
simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like
a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own
weight and break into pieces.
