EZNEC is now able to run under Linux using the wine emulator. EZNEC
version 4.0.34 (the current version) or later is required.

Wonderful!  Thanks Roy.

Is there a faq on your site or anyone elses?

Now only if Pegasus mail had a linux version I could dump this crummy OS

That's great news. Now does anyone know whether it will run under
CrossOver (the CodeWeavers implementation of WINE for Intel Macs)? That
would give me an excuse for upgrading from a year 2001 G4 PowerPC
Macintosh to a year 2007 Intel Macintosh. Mac OS X is to a large extent
based on the BSD variety of UNIX.

I know that the CodeWeavers people have mainly concentrated on getting
things like the Windows versions of the Micro$loth Office suite of
programs to run under CrossOver, the point of which escapes me since
Office has been around for Macs even longer than it has for Windows
machines and thus Mac users are under no pressure to be able to use the
Windows versions of the Office programs. (Word and Excel files are, for
the most part, platform-independent, or at least are easily translatable
between Windows and Mac formats. I frequently turn Mac Word 5.1a files
into Windows XP Word files to give to my daughter, and do the reverse
when she sends me Word files. Such translation is easily done on a Mac,
and with some difficulty can be done on a Windows machine.)

Ironically if I were to get an Intel Mac, one of the programs I could no
longer use is the lean, mean 1992 Mac version of MS Word 5.1a, still
working nicely after 15 years on my year 2001 computer. This program
runs faster and better under Classic (i.e. Mac OS 9) within Mac OS X
than it ever did in the old days. Two layers of emulation are going on
here -- OS X is emulating OS 9, and the PowerPC version of OS 9 is
emulating a 680x0 CPU on a PPC chip (G5, G4, G3, or earlier) -- Word 5
was written before the days of the PPC chips. Classic is not readily
available for Intel Macs (there are semi-satisfactory hacks which make
it sort of work).

Not anything regarding use on Linux. The version that's capable of
running on a Linux emulator has been available only about one day, and
as far as I know only one person has tested it on that system.

Hello, Roy, and all.  I have used a g77-compiled version of NEC-4 on a
Linux platform and it worked fine.  The GNU compiler works with FORTRAN-77
source code as well as C.  I assume a g77 compilation of the NEC-2 source
code would also work.  Of course this is just number-crunching NEC that
does not provide the other bells and whistles of EZNEC.  Sincerely, and

Ya know, older Pentiums can be had for a song at flea markets,
Salvation army, church donation sites, etc.. And are free from trash
bins, and curbsides - especially near the local college at the end of
every semester...

An older pentium may take a few more seconds to crunch your Eznec
design compared to some 3GHZ screamer, but that gives you time to
think (and scratch) whilst waiting...

So as opposed to spending thousands on a new Mac, how about getting an
Eznec box for cheap...

What I need is an operating system that will run all the software that
XP does without my spending much time tinkering with it.

I revisit Linux every few years with a fresh release and an identical
machine to my Windows system. SUSE 10 has come close but some of the
simplest things elude me. Since retirement 15 years ago I have become
isolated from other users except on the Internet. When I seek answers
to simple questions I an usually overwhelmed with a flood of answers
of varying usefulness.

I would like to run my windows and dos software on my Linux machine
with NTFS support, attached to my LAN. I want to be able to install &amp;
delete hardware and software with processes that behave in a
consistent manner. I should be able to use my PIC programmers and my
ham radio software with out tinkering.

Until that happens with Linux I am locked into  an XP machine and a
Win 98 machine in the configuration. I don't want to discourage the
Linux community but at this time it is best suited to the business
user where a few applications on a number of systems will get the job
done.

Recompiling Fortran code which has no interaction with the user other
than getting text input from one file and writing text output to another
is a vastly different problem than re-writing a 60,000 line Visual Basic
interactive graphical user interface in another language then
recompiling for Linux while retaining full functionality of all
features. The difference between the two problems seems to escape a lot
of people, but problems do always look easier to solve when it's someone
else's job to solve them.

Understood, Roy.

Besides being an emulator/program loader, Wine also has winelib which is
intended as a way to recompile Windows applications for Linux (and other Free
Unix systems like BSD, etc.) so they can run natively.  This would avoid a
complete porting effort.

OK. So the demo at http://www.eznec.com/DemoEXE/EZWDemo40Inst.exe
which I downloaded at 2007-02-22 12:43 UTC includes those latest
changes? If so, I have to report that it would not run on either of
Ubuntu Dapper (April 2006 release) or Ubuntu Edgy (October 2006).

In both cases, I removed wine and its config files from my system,
removed my .wine directory and did a fresh install of wine before
installing the EZNEC demo.

With Dapper, I got "EZNEC can't be run on a network from a
workstation". I wasn't, but the home directory is network mounted
using NFS. The wine pacakge was wine_0.9.9-0ubuntu2_i386.deb.

With Edgy, I got "Run-time error '13': Type mismatch. The wine pacakge
was wine_0.9.22-0ubuntu3_i386.deb.

I'll try Debian Sid later. They have wine 0.9.30.

Please don't interpret this as a complaint. Rather, take it as the
beginning of a compatibility list. And I'm still hoping that the demo
I tested was out of date :-)

I'm sure it tries to, but I've never tested.

I have WordStar 6.0 running on linux (under dosemu.)  The last time I
ran WordStar in a micro$oft environment was probably around 1991.
That's when I cut over to OS/2.  Starting around 2002, I started making
the transition to linux.  All linux now.  I keep the OS2 box for
nostalgia.

Thanks for the info. Since there's apparently no version control or
"standard" version of Linux or wine, I guess it's not really appropriate
to claim that "EZNEC runs on Linux using wine". My statement was based
on a single report, from someone using wine 0.9.2 with linux kernel
2.4.20-42.9. But even no two Windows installations are the same, so I'm
sure this is true for Linux also.

I've never purposefully set out to make EZNEC run under Linux -- the
market is much too small to justify any but the most minimal of effort.
The current state is, as I said, a result of a change made to make it
work under Vista, plus one small change to get around an apparent wine
bug (it handles the Windows API call WaitForInputIdle incorrectly). I'll
continue to make very minor changes if necessary to accommodate various
bugs in wine, but nothing major I'm afraid.

&gt; Ubuntu Dapper (April 2006 release) or Ubuntu Edgy (October 2006).

&gt; In both cases, I removed wine and its config files from my system,
&gt; removed my .wine directory and did a fresh install of wine before
&gt; installing the EZNEC demo.

&gt; With Dapper, I got &quot;EZNEC can't be run on a network from a

&gt; With Edgy, I got &quot;Run-time error '13': Type mismatch. The wine pacakge
&gt; was wine_0.9.22-0ubuntu3_i386.deb.

&gt; I'll try Debian Sid later. They have wine 0.9.30.

That's fine.  I was just trying to clarify the position of Linux in relation

Good clue there Roy.  The -42.9 would probably indicate that it is
Redhat or Redhat clone.  I don't think anyone else uses that extended
kernel numbering format.  The official kernels are almost always x.y.z,
with the rare special minor fix as x.y.z.a.  The 42.9 signifies the
Redhat patch set applied, which often has nothing to do with official
releases, or sometimes it upgrades one kernel partially or completely to
another, unspecified, kernel.  Redhat kernels are very confusing,
misleading, and have there own special bugs.  This 2.4.20-42.9 may
actually mostly be 2.4.27, 7 versions newer.  But you'll never know.

The "standard" in Linux is actually the kernel itself.  The
distributions are the packages that surround the kernel.  This includes
the desktop and all the other software that comes with the distribution
you install.  Kind of like the VW bug engine and chassis and tons of
parts kits available.  Except Redhat insists on changing random parts on
the engine, boring a 1600 out to 1950, and still calling it a 1.6 liter.

Before I am attacked, I am NOT running down Redhat here.  I use Fedora
Core 6 at work, and am quite happy with it.  As a desktop.  As a server
platform however, their silly kernel numbering system often makes it
very hard to know how their kernel features map to the Linux standard
kernels.  And when I need to be sure a piece of hardware such as a
particular SATA controller or SCSI RAID is supported, I am forced to
build a new kernel from scratch from a standard kernel source release.
Not hard, just a pain that would be alleviated by Redhat sticking to the
rules the rest of the distros (most) stick to.

Recompiling Visual Basic code in Linux is simpler now as Mono is VB

So if someone sits on the VB code for EZNEC, just rebuild it .Mono on Linux

No. A patent must disclose enough of the method so that someone
"versed in the art" of programing could reproduce it. That's pretty
vague. I might be able to look at the patent and reproduce or better
the process easily, while you look at it and scratch your head. Or vice
versa.

Obviously the more complete a patent application is and the simpler it
is to understand, the more likely it is to be granted and the easier it
will be to explain to a jury in an infringment case. It does not
need to be simple or easy to understand and most are not.

Then as you alluded to later in your comments, there is the whole problem
of implementation. Without a lot of effort, a home computer version of
most scientific  programs will produce meaningless results due to
lack of precision.

Experienced scientific and engineering programers know this and compensate.
"Teach yourself Visual whatever in a week" programmers don't.

The biggest problem with visual whatever programmers is they tend to
be seduced by the flashy interface and ignore the substance under it.

Caveat Emptor.

As an experienced scientific / engineering software developer, I suggest
that much the same issues exist in a conventional 3GL language as in the
"Visual xxx" environment. Good software doesn't just happen, it takes
(aside of the relatively trivial task of writing the functional
elements), huge effort in dealing with exceptions, and testing, testing,
testing.

If you dig deep into the source of Fortran programs, you will often find
the heritage of small memory and slow processors in days gone by, where
implementers used COMMON for variables to reduce memory use, and used
COMMON for passing parameters to avoid the overhead of parameter passing
function calls. This practice was, IMHO, the greatest risk to accuracy in
such programs, and the area that demanded the greatest attention to
design and documentation. The public NEC2 code uses COMMON, and the last
bug that I demonstrated in a C port of the code was related to messed up
parameter passing in COMMON.

So, the old 3GL world wasn't that good anyway!

don't like the results, don't use the program.  If you find a bug, you
report it to the mfr, and usually they roll out a new version sooner or
later that fixes the problem.  This is the advantage of using a provider
that has been in business a while.. they've gone through the release
cycle more than once, and they've got lots of eyes looking at the product.

While looking at source code sounds nice, I suspect that very, very few
of the people who use modeling codes would be willing to take the time
needed to go through them and understand how it works, much less try to
find bugs.

But it does happen.  Every few years, you see Jerry Burke at LLNL
announce some minor change in the NEC code base to address some bizarre
corner case.

If it has a patent then all would or should be revealed

">

Or, even better, they could reveal all in a peer reviewed paper in the
technical literature or in a technical report.  Gosh... isn't that what
the NEC folks did.  There's hundreds of pages of documentation
explaining the theoretical underpinnings of NEC, how it was validated,
etc..

If you're interested in the optimizers....well, there's a raft of papers
and books on the virtues and problems with various optimizers, both in
general and in combination with NEC or other modeling codes.   Yes, in
most cases, you have to wonder if the implementation of the algorithm
was properly done, e.g. Excel uses the Nelder-Mead algorithm in it's
"solver".. and MS doesn't tell you how they exactly did it.. so it's up
to you to find some good test cases and see if it works like you think
it should.  Or, do reasonableness checks on the output.. but that's
something you should do with an optimizer in any case.

You betcha... You gets to pay yer money and you gets to take yer chances.

But in practice, the reputable mfrs of modeling codes tend to provide
validation examples, if only because that's how they do their own
internal testing.  For example, everybody runs the examples in the NEC
manual, because those have been extensively validated, so if your code
gives the same result as the NEC output (subject to the limitations of
NEC and your code), then you say, "yes indeedy, my program works ok!"

Among EZNEC users are aerospace companies, U.S. and foreign government
agencies, universities, domestic and international broadcasters, cell
phone providers, space agencies, telecommunications companies, and a
very wide range of others. They are designing antennas which you make
use of daily.

The purchaser truly is in the position of caveat emptor, and the legal
notice included with EZNEC carefully spells this out in legalese. But
EZNEC also has an unconditional full money back satisfaction guarantee,
and none of the above users have asked for a refund.

I agree completely. Maybe the future will learn that we were fooled by

Hmm is it so ?. I don't know. If you ask me, every person does have
it's own motives to decide if he buys or uses one program or the

... and many other things exist to frustrate accurate computing.   Long,
long ago when translating antenna modeling (written in FORTRAN) that had
given reasonable results on a 60 bit/word CDC computer to an IBM 32 bit/word
computer, I found the code for one antenna type to be unsalvageable.  No
matter what was done with concatenating words together, garbage resulted.  A
close look found that the algorithms used were much too sensitive to
significant figures.
I experienced another case where supposedly identical IBM computers
produced different results using the same code.
I echo:  work reasonable examples by hand and compare their results to
what the computer produces.

Believable engineering programs earn respect just as people do.

Though the 60 bit CDC machines were regarded as the ants pants by
engineers and scientists, the IBM 370 machines (and later) using double
precision were better. The tricky bit was (IIRC) that the representation
of reals on CDC machines used a base of 2 for the exponent, whereas the
IBM format used 2^16, and obviously the two macines allocated a different
number of bits to the mantissa and exponent. It was hard to state the
extent of improvmenet in precision in the IBM format due to the use of
the larger number for the exponent base.

On occasions, this gave rise to different results from programs ported
from  on to other. It might have seemed like splitting hairs, but it
showed how close to the wind some of the programs ran in terms of
numerical stability.

I recall in the early days of Excel (V2???) when Microsoft first allowed
user developed add-ins (DLL only, they hadn't thought of VBA), I wrote a
function library for Erlang functions (and some other traffic funcitons).
A chap I was doing some work for asked for a spreadsheet to resemble a
set of printed Erlang tables, and he went through checking them.

When challenged about small differences, I offered "well see, the
engineer who probably developed that set of tables as a major project,
probably used a CDC machine with a mere 60 bit real representation (which
was thought to be the ducks guts in its heyday), but I have used the
Intel 80 bit reals inside the routines, and although Excel only uses 64
bit reals, accumulated rounding errors inside the function library are
reduced (Erlang is an iteritive calculation, but can be optimised to
reduce effects of rounding and overflow)". He was convinced, but I think
somewhat dissapointed to see a low cost desktop computer providing a more
accurate solution than the iconic CDC.

Our mobile phones have probably got more powerful processors now than the
386/SX16 that I used to develop that library!
