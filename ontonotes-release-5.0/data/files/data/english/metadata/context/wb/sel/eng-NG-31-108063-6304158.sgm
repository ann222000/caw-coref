Begin with an attack with the kitchen sink sprayer, or a spray nozzle on the
outside hose. If they come back, put 2-3 drops of dish soap in a quart of
water and soak the plant completely with it. Always use poison as your last
resort. Always.

Just hose the plant off every day from the undersides of the leaves.
It will wash the mites off and no pesticide is necessary.  Proper
watering and fertilization for having a healthy plant is also a way to
prevent insect damage.  For some reason, the plants attract insects,
mites, etc. when the plant is not healthy.

Will try the soap. Just hosing plants don't get rid of them, they come rigt
back. Plants are in small greenhouse and mites are problem all winter long.

They were healthy when put in greenhouse but soon spider mites were on them
all. I spray with water and systemic but the mites are still in there. Now
are spreding to the impatience seedlings. I would like to get rid of them
completely.

Spider mites hate water spray.  If you spray/mist the plant daily for
a week they will leave.  Cover the pot soil with aluminum foil while
spraying so you don't saturate the plant's roots.   Then you can mist
the plant 2x a week.  A plant in a south or west window is most
vulnerable to spider mite attack.

Ortho Systemic Insect Killer, says controls insects and mites.  It worked
good for small green worms on geraniums but the mites are still there. There
was one call Kelthane that killed them all. They don't sell it anyplace
anymore.

Especially on spider mites.  There have natural predators that poison
sprays kill.  Most spider mite problems are caused by spraying.

If the mites are indoors you have some different options.  Read this:

Thank you both. I took them out this evening and sprayed real thorough with
water from hose three times. Will spray them every day it's warm enough. I
sprayed seedlings with hand sprayer and clean water.  The greenhouse air is
dry.Humidity will not stay in there.

Sometimes humidity is very low here where I live and what I do is line
the entire greenhouse (10 x20 foot) with open milk jugs filled with
water.  I put them on the south side so the sun heats the water and
during very mild seasons they actually heat the greenhouse at night.

If your greenhouse is not holding humidity, you may not be watering
properly.

I to have the black spray paint milk jugs of water but tops are on them on
south side for heat.  I got idea from a site on net.  I think I should have
wet down gravel floor very well in the fall. Water properly? I check and
water every day so how do you mean?

Great! Get a humidifier with a tank you can refill. Problem solved. Check a
site like www.epinions.com before buying. Last time I looked, there were
some nicely written reviews there from consumers. You can ignore any
negative comments about noisy units, since you probably won't be sleeping in
the greenhouse.

I find the old one from the childrens room in the shed. It still works after
so many years so will squeze it in there somehow.
