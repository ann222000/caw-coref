The far left (in many cases, Communist/Marxist organizations within
the USA) have for many years tried to destroy the United States by
flooding it with illegal immigrants &amp; demanding rights for these
illegal immigrants (eg. social services, education, health care,
etc).  The far left justifies it's &quot;destroy the USA&quot; agenda by
perversly interpretting the U.S. Constitution to meet their goals.
A common tactic of the far left is to erase the very idea of U.S.
citizenship and hence erase the rights and priveledges which ONLY come
from citizenship.  The far left argues that rights enjoyed by U.S.
citizens is discriminatory towards illegal aliens.  The far left is
exploiting an anomaly in the 14th ammendment of the U.S. Constitution.
http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am14.html (click link for full
text of 14th ammendment)

The following is the part of the 14th ammendment which the far left is
trying to exploit in hope of getting full equal rights for illegal
aliens:
&quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall
any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without
due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws&quot;.

Groups like the ACLU use the words, &quot;any person&quot; in the 14th
ammendment to mean even illegal aliens.  Clearly though, the intent is
not to include people criminally present in the USA, but that's a moot
point to the far left.  They'll ram their lawsuits and know that
leftist judges will, in most cases, side with them.  Incidentally, the
14th ammendment was written for former slaves, and former slaves ONLY.

We saw a recent example of this U.S. Constitution deliberate
misinterpretation tactic in the Hazelton, PA case in which the city of
Hazelton tried to prohibit illegal aliens from getting jobs and
renting apartments.  The ACLU sued Hazelton and the leftist judge
ruled on the side of the ACLU by stating, &quot;the Hazelton ordinance is
unconstitional in that it discriminates against people in the United
States illegally... laws shall be applied equally to all people,
whether they are in the country legally or illegally&quot;.  So then, we
see that in this case, U.S. citizenship or legal permanant residency
in the United States means nothing.  Mere physical presence in the
United States is all that matters to these judges and groups like the
ACLU.  Of course, by continuing down this path, the United States will
surely rot from within &amp; collapse on itself, but this is precisely
what the far left hopes to achieve -----&gt; destroy the USA, because in
their eyes, the USA is the main obstacle to global socialism and
global government which the ACLU feels will be utopia.

SUMMARY: The far left has an army of people on their side, working
long hours towards destroying this country (examples: ACLU, Southern
Poverty Law Center, ADL, National Lawyers Guild, LA Raza, LULAC,
NAACP).  The far left also has literally thousands of liberal activist
judges who work lockstep with subversive organizations like the ACLU
by making rulings which are always harmful to America.  On our side,
we have a fall smaller force which fights against these far left
groups.  One exmaple is &quot;Jucicial Watch&quot;.  I suggest everyone make a
donation to this pro-America organization today...

If this is an example of Judicial watches Constitutional interpretations they
should try going back to law school.

The Constitution does not give rights to anyone, not even citizens.  Instead, it
restricts Governmental actions save for those enumerated powers listed in the
Constitution.

The 14th Amendment applies most of these restrictions to the States. The scope
of these restrictions is limited only by the jurisdictional reach of the
Constitution itself.

There is not one set of rules for citizens and another for everyone else.  There
are just rules on what the Government, (Federal, State or Local), can or cannot
do.  WHO they are doing it to just doesn't matter.  They either have the
authority for the actions taken or they don't, simple as that.

Anyone familiar with the Constitution knows this, so why is Judicial watch
lieing?  Do you think having their hand out for money might have something to do
with it?
