2002 Mustang, intermitten wiper problem

My mother owns a 2002 Mustang convertible, 3.8L, close to 75,000 kms.  She
took it to a local mechanic for the yearly inspection and they found only
one problem, but put a sticker on the car nonetheless.  The problem, the
wipers do not work when set on any intermitten setting on the MF switch.  If
you select either Hi or Low speed, or spray the washer fluid, they work
fine.  The mechanic told her that the wiper motor needed replacement, which
I disagree with, because of the fact that the wipers still work on the hi
and low settings.  That and I believe that if the motor were to fail, it
would not slowly die, it would more than likely all of a sudden just stop
working.  I listened to the motor myself and watched the wipers move back
and forth, it seems as though it is still working fine.  No funny sounds or
no erratic wiper movement.

I have not worked on this particular car myself but I'm sure that whichever
part is at fault, I should be able to replace it myself.  Possibly someone
has run into the same problem before and any insight would be greatly
appreciated.  There may be another electrical part that I'm overlooking and
would rather be certain before she orders any replacement parts.

Thanks

The 'switching' is part of the motor.

Wipers are controlled by a GEM (generic electronic module)... I would run
away from the mechanic as fast as my old man legs could carry me and find a
reputable shop.

For any inspections I have ever done, the wipers and washer need to work....
there is no mention of interval operation....

Well Jim, the reason I question the mechanic is the same reason I questioned
the same shop after they did front brake work on my '98 Malibu, which are
well known for front brake problems. After only 2 months, one of the
calipers started seizing up and I could not understand how this had not been
detected when the original work was done.  I was also really puzzled as to
why they couldn't tell me what condition the opposite caliper was in, seeing
as how I didn't want it sticking as well.   Needless to say, I haven't taken
my car back to that shop.  At one time, this used to be a reputable shop.
But now that most of his mechanics are young &quot;kids&quot; that are half my age, I
just don't trust them anymore.

With that aside, I'm not sure what you mean when you say interval operation.
If you mean, do they wipe, stop for a set time and then wipe again, then
yes, but only on the Hi or Low speeds.  The wipers will not function at all
on any of the intermittent settings, I tried this yesterday.  I waited up to
a minute on the fastest setting before it clicks to Low and there was no
wiper movement at all.  I also tried all of the intermittent settings in
between (probably about 10 in total), nothing.  I agree, any inspection I
did as an Apprentice (more than 11 years ago), the wipers and the sprayer
had to be working as part of the MVI.

So my question now, is the GEM part of the wiper motor assembly, as Mike
suggested, or is this a small module located somewhere else?  Mom has
already priced up a new wiper motor @ $110 from the dealer, and she was
going to call around for prices for the MF switch on the steering column,
which I suspected.  But, as I admitted earlier, my wrenching experience with
cars newer than 2000 is limited, so I would rather ask someone more
knowledgable than I.

Suggestions are still welcome, and thanks for the replies.

I believe the problem might lie inside the MFS itself.  I had a Grand
Marquis that did this very same thing until I opened up the MFS from the
end, cleaned it out, (amazing how much crap builds up in there) re-greased
it, put it back together, and voila! everything worked as it used to.  Might
be worth a try!

I'm even more confused now.... there is some drivel about not trusting the
tech before.... and now we are not trusting the tech again.....

Where the brakes on a Malibu enter in to this discussion is beyond me... and
I hope it stays there.....

For the Mustang... the wiper motor works... you have said so.... Why replace
something that works?

Interval wipers - intermittent (please notice the spelling... some of us
grade 8 drop-outs have a hard time with mis-spelled words) wipers.... we
should be able to make an association here.....

What is obvious.... your &quot;tech&quot; is trying to fix something without adequate
documentation... After nearly 40 years in this business, I refuse to attempt
this kind of stuff without adequate documentation. The modern automobile is
far too complex for this kind of cavalier shit....

The GEM is NOT part of the wiper motor... As another reply indicated, the
multifunction switch has been a cause for concern, but without proper
testing... well, if we replace enough parts, we are bound to replace the
right one eventually....

If it was easy, I wouldn't have a job....

You know what Jim?  I don't know if you're trying to be funny, or if you're
just being a smartass.  Up until you replied to this last post, I used to
respect you and the information you gave out to the people needing help on
this group.  Who suddenly made you king of this group, just because you have
a bit more experience and knowledge than others?  Like others (and NO, I am
not a newbie to this group, do a search), I came in here looking for help
and suggestions, because I am unfamiliar with this model car, not to be
talked down to like a 6 year old.  What you obviously haven't realized is
that I have wrenched on many other vehicles, but usually not newer than
2000.  When I see a post that refers to a problem I may have had with one of
my vehicles, I try to reply and help out best I can.

I guess you couldn't make the association that I took my Chevrolet vehicle
to the same shop and was questionable about his work.  Which is the reason
I'm questioning the same shop about telling my mother to replace what seems
to be a normally working wiper motor.  I don't know if I can make that any
clearer for you, but if you are still confused, I'm sorry.

Yes the wiper motor works.  What I was asking is whether the GEM module you
are talking about is inside that wiper motor or not.  You answered no, so
now I'll focus my attention on the other parts of the wiper system.  I don't
have the time or the money to go replacing every part of the wiper system
until the intermittent wipers start working again,  and even if I did, I
wouldn't.  Yeah, I already made the association between interval and
intermittent wipers, in my last post.  We're both talking about the same
thing, just using different definitions.  As far as testing the MF switch, I
wasn't sure if it was possible to do so, aside from a visual inspection of
the electrical contacts.

Anyone else who has information, replies are still greatly appreciated.
Jim, unless you change your attitude, I don't expect a reply from you, nor
will I read one.  I'm sick and tired of people who are supposed to be
helping out and instead make it a point to degrade others if they don't
happen to be quite as knowledgeable or experienced.

I'm certainly not king of this NG... never pretended to be...

But I'm &quot;supposed&quot; to do what??? &quot;Supposed&quot;???? What, you'll have my pay
cut???

Sharky... the help that I give is &quot;supposed&quot; to make you think for
yourself.... I will describe how a system works... but I ain't going to lead
anyone to the promised land.... There will be some thought process involved
on your part... give a man a fish - teach a man to fish....What's important?

Listen to yourself... &quot;I had a bad experience with this mechanic and now
here I am on his doorstep again.... &quot; And you are asking for people to do
HIS diagnosing FOR FUCKING FREE!!!!! You're unfamiliar with the car... boo
fucking hoo.... I'm unfamiliar with the car so I did what sane people do....
I looked in the fucking manual.... Perhaps your mechanic might attempt the
same....

Look, boys and girls, in Canada I am required by law to possess a
journeymans automotive certificate to work on cars in a paid professional
situation. This certificate means I have at LEAST A MINIMUM predetermined
level of proficiency... In the US, some asshole with 40 bucks worth of tools
and a pair of bib overalls can call himself a mechanic.... WTF is that? And
that brings us to ....

The cost of &quot;doing business&quot;. Every adventure in the retail and service
industries comes with &quot;overhead&quot;.... In my business, that overhead includes
tools AND documentation. I don't work on Chevrolets or any other makes... so
I don't worry about documentation for those.... If I did work on these, it
would be factory service manuals or no workee.... Your tech needs to do the
same... no skin off my ass but he will cost YOU and your MOM a lot of
needless expense without them.... Life, for me, will continue as normal.

Lastly.... free shit is free shit... don't get pissy over it. &quot;Suck it up,
Nancy&quot;....

What pisses me off the most, is someone that visits some cheapy hole in the
wall shop (especially one they don't trust any more) and winds up having to
do the mechanics research for him.... It gives good, honest techs a bad name
and the customer will rarely be satisfied with the experience....

Damn... it's people like you that shake my faith in humanity....

When did I ask you to go out and tear apart your own personal Mustang (if
you owned one, that is), figure out the info I need, come back on here and
explain it in text, step by step?  Or go and buy a 2002 Mustang shop manual,
find out the info I need, and reply back to me?  I didn't.  What I was
hoping for was someone who may have come across the same situation and say
&quot;Hey, try this.  I did this to my own Mustang and it solved my problem with
my wipers.&quot;  That's it.  Fact is, I don't have a service manual, nor does my
mother, because she has never needed one for this car yet.  Frankly, the
ONLY question I asked you in the last post was whether the GEM module you
mentioned was part of the wiper motor or not.  Now that I know it isn't,
I'll start looking at other parts of the wiper system.  As far as the MF
switch, I didn't know it could be tested, aside from a visual inspection of
the electrical contacts.  And do you know how I got all of this information?
That's right, I did the reasearch all by myself.  Unfortunately, the info I
found wasn't quite enough to help.

FYI, my mother took the car into this shop, not me.  If I had known she was
taking her car to get it inspected, I would have told her, based on my bad
experience with my own car, to stay away from this shop.  And again, who
asked you to diagnose anything?  Like I said, if you had worked on one of
these cars before with the exact same problem, or similar, and had some
useful info, than great and I thank you for that.  If you don't have
anything to add, don't reply.

First off, I am by far, not the only person who does not have a Journeyman
or Master Mechanic Certificate posted on my wall in this newsgroup, and
works on my own vehicle.  I am, in fact, a first year apprentice who worked
at a Ford dealership nearly 12 years ago.  Unfortunately, I opted to leave
the trade because the shop foreman was a total prick because I was young and
couldn't be bothered to teach me anything.  That aside,  I don't believe
that I need to be a Journeyman Mechanic to pick up a wrench and work on my
own or my families vehicles.  At the same time, when it needs to be taken to
a shop for MVI, tire changes, stuff that I can't do, then I take it in.
Secondly, you make it sound like you are working on an online mechanical
forum and that you should be paid an hourly rate to answer peoples questions
on here.  Do you really think that anyone on this newsgroup is being paid to
answer any of our questions?  I certainly don't think so.  Aside from that,
as I said before, I don't expect ANYONE to go out of their way to find out
info for me.  But if they feel obliged to reply with some helpful
information, then I appreciate it and thank them for it.

Read above.  As I said before, I am not the person who took the vehicle to
this shop.  I am, by far, not the only person living on this planet who does
not trust a particular mechanic/shop.  As we all know, there are some shady
shops out there.  In this case, it isn't the shop or the shop owner that I
don't trust, it is the diagnosis that the younger mechanics are relaying to
their boss.  That info is passed onto me via my mother, and from my own
personal experience, I believe the diagnosis to be untrue.  All I am trying
to do is help figure out what the problem is and fix it.  How this topic
turned into an argument is beyond me, but it didn't help by insulting me.

I used to respect you and the information you gave out.
Who made you king of this group....
What you obviously haven't realized.....
Just because you have a bit more experience....
I guess you couldn't make the association....
I don't know if I can make that any clearer for you.....
If you are still confused .....
Unless you change your attitude ....
I don't expect a reply from you, nor will I read one....
I'm sick and tired of people who make it a point to degrade others....
Stop nit-picking peoples posts to death.
Stop being sarcastic.
I didn't come here to be treated like some stupid 5 year old.
WTF are you smoking?
You can log off your computer and go jerk off in the corner for all I care.
FYI, my mother took the car into this shop, not me.
Again, who asked you to diagnose anything?
If you don't have anything to add, don't reply.
You must think you should be paid to answer peoples questions here.
Its Canadians such as yourself that give us a bad name.

I hope the rude diatribe above does not discourage others
from continuing to take the time to offer helpful suggestions.

At alt.autos.ford, people can get free advice on car problems,
sometimes saving thousands of dollars.     Most of the advice is
from others who have experienced and solved the same problems.
Some is from master mechanics, without charge.    The help is
truly appreciated by everyone, with very few exceptions.

Best regards and good luck to all,

Rodan.

Barney, my next step is likely to remove the MF switch, do a visual
inspection of it and possibly give it a good dose of contact cleaner.  I
know in an older Escort I owned, the contacts became so wore that the
high/low switch stopped working and the switch had to be replaced.  I just
wish I knew if there were any other electrical devices wired into the wiper
system that may be at fault.  Unfortunately, I don't have a manual and
didn't really want to invest in one unless I had to.

Thanks for your input.

What is your advice Rodan?  I should just listen to every word Jim says,
whether it helps me or not, and not defend myself when someone starts acting
sarcastic when I did nothing but ask a question looking for help?

I appreciate the help I get on this newsgroup, and I'm sure the few people
who I've helped out over the years appreciate the help I've given them.  I
am not a registered mechanic, although, when it comes to specific vehicles
and their problems, there are areas where I am quite knowledgeable and add
in to the topic when appropriate.  I don't feel obliged to answer any posts,
nor do I feel like I am owed anything when I reply.  I reply because I feel
that I can help out.

I'm sorry this post ended up where it did, and I also agree that this
newsgroup is not the place for bickering and arguing.  However, hopefully
this will blow over and the newsgroup can continue to progress forward in
helping those who need it.

BTW, I find it funny how you singled out everything that I said and not even
one word added by Jim.  Oh well.

Give it a shot of DeoxIT, the best contact cleaner/enhancer I ever
used.  Actually rejuvenates the contacts.

I'm not sure that I was clear enough in my discription, so let me try again.
I removed the end of the MFS, not the entire MFS.  Cleaned the contacts
inside and re-greased them.  Made a world of difference.  Every now and then
I would still have a 'hiccup' in the operation of the delay wipers, but for
the most part it worked perfectly.  You can find directions on the net for
how to do it specifically.

Barney, I see what you mean now.  You're talking about the actual wiring
harness.  I'm talking about the contacts inside of the switch.  Nonetheless,
I will probably dose the whole switch with contact cleaner, the connector
and put dielectric grease on whatever needs it. If it looks too wore out,
I'll just replace it.

BTW, Shaq, I've never heard of that cleaner, but I'll take a look for it,
thanks for the tip.

Thanks for the clarification.
