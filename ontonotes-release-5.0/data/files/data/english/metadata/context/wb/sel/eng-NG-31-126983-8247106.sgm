I used to live with a woman who was a serious guitar player.

She'd been a semi-professional wunsta pawna time and had wonderful
stories about the evening she got to back up Mississippi John Hurt at
the Newport Folk Festival. . .

I'm not a musician.

But I used to pick at the autoharp, one of those &quot;idiot instruments&quot;
_anybody_ can play.  (Another idiot instrument is the mountain
dulcimer.)

Anyway, this woman and I used to occasionally pick stuff out together.

And one night, during a visit to this house when I folks still lived
here, we were working out way through a hymn about &quot;Give me the roses
while I live.&quot;

My mother came onto the porch, sat down to listen a while and when we
were done told me that old song was one of my grandmother's favorites.

Tonight the local college radio station, which does &quot;Americana&quot; music of
an evening, played the Wilma Lee and Stoney Cooper version of &quot;Roses.&quot;

And it struck me it's something we all oughta think about from time to
time:

Give Me the Roses While I Live
By R. H. Cornelius

Wonderful things of folks are said
When they have passed away
Roses adorn the narrow bed
Over the sleeping clay
Give me the roses while I live
Trying to cheer me on
Useless are flowers that you give
After the soul is gone
Let us not wait to do good deeds
Till they have passed away
Now is the time to sow good seeds
While here on earth we stay
Kind words are useless when folks lie
Cold in a narrow bed
Don't wait till death to speak kind words
Now should the words be said.

Think about it. . .

Got any roses you oughta be passing out?

--
I have heard of a land on a far away strand.
‘Tis a beautiful home of the soul.
Built by Jesus on high where we never shall die
It's a land where we'll never grow old.
--&quot;Never Grow Old,&quot; James C. Moore, c. 1914

Hell, yes.  When Robert smites his bloomin' lyre he makes some mighty
good music.

I think we'll have him declared a national treasure.
