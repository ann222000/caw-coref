Charles Spurgeon's sermon concerning the Holy Spirit is an uplifting and
enlightening lesson and I urge my Christian brethren to read it when they
get the opportunity.

May God bless,

The Spirit's Work in the New Creation - Gen. 1:2
by C.H. SPURGEON

&quot;And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of
the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&quot;-Gen 1:2
We cannot tell how the Spirit of God brooded over that vast watery mass. It
is a mystery, but it is also a fact, and it is here revealed as having
happened at the very commencement of the creation, even before God had said,
&quot;Let there be light.&quot; The first divine act in fitting up this planet for the
habitation of man was for the Spirit of God to move upon the face of the
waters. Till that time, all was formless, empty, out of order, and in
confusion. In a word, it was chaos; and to make it into that thing of beauty
which the world is at the present moment, even though it is a fallen world,
it was needful that the movement of the Spirit of God should take place upon
it. How the Spirit works upon matter, we do not know; but we do know that
God, who is a Spirit, created matter, and fashioned matter, and sustained
matter, and that He will yet deliver matter from the stain of sin which is
upon it. We shall see new heavens and a new earth in which materialism
itself shall be lifted up from its present state of ruin, and shall glorify
God; but without the Spirit of God the materialism of this world must have
remained for ever in chaos. Only as the Spirit came did the work of creation
begin.

That fact I intend to use this evening, spiritualizing it. It is a literal
fact, and we are not to regard this chapter of Genesis or any other part of
Genesis as being a mere parable; but having so said, we think we may now say
that these real facts may illustrate the work of God in the new creation,
and our main thought just now is that the work of the Holy Spirit in the
soul of man is comparable to his work in creation. As in various books by
the same author you can trace the writer's idioms, and as in many paintings
by one great artist there are certain touches which betray the same hand, so
in the great book of nature we see traces of the same hand as in the book of
grace; and in this great picture of material beauty we may see the handiwork
of that same Master-Artist who has drawn lines and curves of spiritual
beauty upon the souls of the redeemed.

I. I am going, first, to try to draw A PARALLEL BETWEEN SPIRIT'S WORK IN THE
OLD AND NEW CREATION.

And first I want to remind you that, as the movement of the Holy Spirit upon
the waters was the first act in the six days' work, so the work of the Holy
Spirit in the soul is the first work of grace in that soul. There may have
been a thousand sermons heard, but there has been no effectual work within
the soul until the Spirit of God comes there. Sabbaths may have passed over
the man's head for fifty years, and during every one of those Sabbaths that
man may have been a regular attendant at the house of God; but there has
been nothing savingly done for him unless the Spirit of God has entered into
him, and begun to work upon his soul. He may have been baptized, and joined
the church, and partaken of the communion; but, for all that, his heart is
still without any sort of form or fashion which God would have it to bear.
It is void; there is no life of God within it, no faith in Christ, no true
hope for the future. It is emptiness itself, notwithstanding all that has
been done, if the Spirit of God has not been at work in it.

It is a very humbling truth, but a truth notwithstanding its humiliating
form, that the best man that mere morality ever produced is still &quot;without
form and void&quot; if the Spirit of God has not come upon him. All the efforts
of men which they make by nature, when stirred up by the example of others
or by godly precepts, produce nothing but chaos in another shape; some of
the mountains may have been levelled, but valleys have been elevated into
other mountains; some vices have been discarded, but only to be replaced by
other vices that are, perhaps, even worse; or certain transgressions have
been forsaken for a while, only to be followed by a return to the selfsame
sins, so that it has happened unto them, as Peter writes, &quot;according to the
true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was
washed to her wallowing in the mire&quot; 2 Peter 2:22. Unless the Spirit of God
has been at work within him, the man is still, in the sight of God, &quot;without
form and void&quot; as to everything which God can look upon with pleasure. What!
is it so when a man has made great efforts, and has really done his best?
Yes; for &quot;that which is born of the flesh is flesh&quot; John 3:6, even when the
flesh does its best; its fairest offspring is still only flesh. Water will
naturally rise as high as its own source, but without extraneous pressure it
will never rise any higher; and humanity may rise as high as humanity can
rise, but it can never get any higher until the Spirit of God imparts a
supernatural force to it. &quot;Except a man be born again (born from above), he
cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot; The very first act in the great work of the
new creation is that the Spirit of God moves upon the soul as he moved upon
the face of the waters.

The second thing I ask you to note is that to this work nothing whatever is
contributed by the man himself. &quot;The earth was without form and void&quot; Gen
1:2, so it could not do anything to help the Spirit. &quot;Darkness was upon the
face of the deep.&quot; The Spirit found no light there, it had to be created.
There was nothing whatever there to help the Spirit of God, no agencies at
work to say to him, &quot;We have been preparing the way for your coming; we
needed your assistance; we were waiting for you, and we rejoice that you
have come to finish the work that we have begun.&quot; There was nothing of the
kind; and sad as the truth is, in unregenerate man there is nothing
whatsoever that can help the Spirit of God. The heart of man promises help,
but &quot;the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked&quot; Jer
17:9. The will has great influence over the man, but the will is itself
depraved, so it tries to play the tyrant over all the other powers of the
man, and it refuses to become the servant of the eternal Spirit of truth.

If I am never to preach the gospel to a sinner till I see something in him
that will help the Holy Ghost to save him, I shall never be able to preach
the gospel at all; and if Jesus Christ never saves a man till he sees
something in that man that cries to Christ to save him, then no man will
ever be saved. We are, by nature, not merely like the man who was wounded on
his way from Jerusalem to Jericho, and who was left on the road half dead,
but we are wholly &quot;dead in trespasses and sins,&quot; and in the dead sinner
there is nothing that can help his own resurrection. There is not a hand
there to be lifted, nor even an ear to hear, nor an eye to see, nor a pulse
that can beat. We do not exaggerate nor go beyond the truth when we say
this; and every man is thus dead till the Spirit of God comes to him; and
when the Spirit comes to him, he finds nothing in him that can co-operate
with the Spirit of God, but everything that is to be good must be created in
him, and be brought to him, and be infused into him. What is needed is not
the fanning of sparks that have almost expired, not the strengthening of a
life that was almost dead through faintness; the Spirit has to deal with
death, and rottenness, and corruption. Man's nature is a charnel-house, and
a sepulchre, and a little hell; and God's Spirit must bring to it that which
is living, and good, and pleasing in God's sight if it is ever to be there.

But more than that, in the old creation, not only was there nothing whatever
that could help the Holy Spirit, but there seemed nothing at all congruous
to the Spirit. I mean, for instance, that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of
order, but there was disorder. He is the Spirit of light, but there was
darkness. Does it not seem a strange thing that the Spirit of God should
have come there at all? Adored in his excellent glory in the heaven where
all is order and all is light, why should he come to brood over that watery
deep, and to begin the great work of bringing order out of chaos? And, in a
similar fashion, often and often have we asked,-Why should the Spirit of God
ever have come into our hearts? What was there in us to induce the Spirit of
God to begin a work of grace in us? We admire the condescension of Jesus in
leaving heaven to dwell upon earth; but do we not equally admire the
condescension of the Holy Spirit in coming to dwell in such poor hearts as
ours? Jesus dwelt with sinners, but the Holy Ghost dwells in us. If it were
possible for the condescension of the incarnation to be outdone, it would be
in the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men. This is a miracle
of mercy indeed, for, I say again, there is nothing in the heart by nature
that can at all please the Holy Spirit, but there is everything there that
can grieve him. The Spirit would beget in us repentance for sin, but the
heart is hard as a stone. The Spirit would work in us faith, but the heart
is full of unbelief. The Spirit would make us pure, but the heart is fond of
sin. The Spirit would lead us towards God, but all our passions incline us
to run away from Him, and to run to everything that is contrary to him. Yet
doth the Spirit of God come and work in us while our heart is nothing but
chaos, and our nature is full of darkness. For this wonderful mercy, let us
bless and love the Spirit of God.

Notice, also, that the Spirit of God is as mysterious in his coming into
human hearts as he was in his working in the old creation. I said before
that we cannot explain how the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the
waters. Some try to fetch a meaning out of the Hebrew word, but I believe it
helps them very little. It is one of the deep mysteries of Scripture. Ever
must the contact of the Spirit with materialism remain a marvel; and can we
ever tell how the Spirit of God comes and deals with sinful men? We know
that our Saviour himself said to Nicodemus, &quot;The wind bloweth where it
listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it
cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit&quot;
John 3:8.

But mysterious as it is, it is real, as those know who have experienced it,
and as those may see who will watch the effects which the Spirit produces
upon the hearts of men. I would like to ask all in this present assembly
whether they know anything about the mysterious working of the Holy Spirit
in their souls. Beloved hearers, there may be many things of which you may
be ignorant, and yet you may be none the worse for that ignorance; but if
you are ignorant of the working of the Holy Spirit in your spirit, then you
are ignorant of eternal life, ignorant of the one thing needful to deliver
you from hell and lift you up to heaven. Have you ever experienced within
your spirit a power divine that turned you from your old habits and old
ways, and that made such a radical change in you that you are no longer what
you once were, a change that was practically to you a new birth, a new
creation? I pray you not to deceive yourselves about this matter. Sinners
had to be born again in the apostles' time, and they must be born again now
if they are ever to see or to enter the kingdom of God. It was necessary
that they should be regenerated in the days of Christ, but it is equally
necessary now; and it is not merely necessary for people who have been to
prison or who have been thieves and drunkards, it is equally needful for
you, the children of godly parents, for you respectable people, for you who
have never done a dishonourable action in all your lives. You are not yet
partakers of the divine nature unless the Spirit of God, in the deep mystery
of his almighty power, has wrought that new life in your soul. Solemnly have
I asked myself this question, &quot;Have I been born again?&quot; and I urge each one
of you earnestly to examine yourselves upon this all-important matter. Do
you know that this new life has been put within you? Let none of us be
satisfied unless we do know that it is so. What an awful thing it would be
to be in doubt whether I am a child of God or not,-whether I am on the road
to heaven or not! May God grant that none of us may be in such doubt, even
for an hour, but may we have absolute certainty upon this point, mysterious
though it be!

We have so far noted that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters as the first act of the six days' work, and that to this movement
nothing on the earth contributed or was congruous, that this movement was a
mystery, and yet very real. Note, next, that this movement was most
effectual. &quot;The earth was without form, and void&quot; Gen 1:2, but that did not
defeat the purpose of the Spirit of God. &quot;Darkness was upon the face of the
deep,&quot; but he could work in the dark. The darkness did not hinder him; and,
blessed be God, the deep depravity of our nature does not prevent the Holy
Ghost from creating it anew in Christ Jesus. Without God, the turning of a
heart of stone into flesh would surely be impossible; and if there had ever
been an impossibility of impossibilities, I feel that the changing of my
nature would have been that impossibility, and each Christian here may feel
the same with regard to himself or herself. But nothing is too hard for the
Lord; though a man may have had no knowledge of the gospel up to the time
when the Spirit of God comes upon him, or though he may have been as
violently opposed to that gospel as he possibly could be, yet led the Spirit
of God savingly deal with that man, and all hindrances disappear, all
opposition gives way, and the work of grace is effectually accomplished.
Light came when God said, &quot;Let there be light;&quot; the waters were separated,
the dry land appeared, and the winged fowl, and the fish that swim in the
deep, and the cattle that crowd the fields, and man himself in the image of
God,-all these came at the Lord's command; chaos had become a garden, and
death blossomed into life.

It only needed the Spirit of God to come, and then the work was effectually
done, and this is a point I want to mention as good cheer to some who are
here. You may be dead in sin, but the Spirit of God can quicken you. Dear
brother, you may be preaching to times who are dead in sin, but preach the
gospel to them all the same. It is your business to preach the gospel to
dead sinners, for it is the gospel that makes the dead to live. If we had to
look for some natural goodness in the sinner before we preached the gospel
to him, we should never preach to him at all; but we have to go to him where
he is, with darkness over his soul, and ruin and confusion all around; and
while we preach the Word, the Spirit of God accompanies it with saving
power, and the man is made to live, and he is fashioned in the image of God.
Blessed be God, the Spirit's work is always effectual. It is possible to
grieve and to resist the Holy Ghost; but when he puts forth his almighty
power, then he is irresistible; the will is sweetly inclined, and the man
cries, &quot;Great, God, I yield, constrained by mighty love. I throw down my
weapons of rebellion, and I willingly go as thy gracious Spirit leads me.&quot;

I want you also to notice that, where the Spirit came, the work was carried
on to completion. This work of creation did not end with the first day, but
went on till it was finished on the sixth day. God did not say, &quot;I have made
the light, and now I will leave the earth as it is;&quot; and when he had begun
to divide the waters, and to separate the land from the sea, he did not say,
&quot;New I will have no more to do with the world.&quot; He did not take the
newly-fashioned earth in his hands, and fling it back into chaos; but He
went on with His work until, on the seventh day, when it was completed, He
rested from all His work; and, glory be to God, He will not leave unfinished
the work which He has commenced in our souls. Where the Spirit of God has
begun to move, he continues to move until the work is done; and he will not
fail or turn aside until all is accomplished. How we ought to bless his name
for this! If the Spirit of God ever did utterly leave his work in any man's
soul undone, then each one here might feel, &quot;He may leave it unfinished in
me,&quot; and there would remain no solid comfort for any one of us. If a child
of God could ever fall from grace, then you and I might be among the first
to fall; but Jesus said, &quot;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they
follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
neither shall any pluck them out of my hand&quot; John 10:27. Rightly do we sing:

&quot;The work which wisdom undertakes
Eternal mercy ne'er forsakes.&quot;

As surely as there is a first day, there will come a seventh day in which
God will rest because His work will be completed; and as surely as the
Spirit of God has moved upon our soul, and there has some to us light
instead of darkness, so shall there be a day of rest in which we shall keep
the Sabbath of God with Him for ever, because the Spirit's work has been
completed in us even as the work of Christ has been finished on our behalf.

II. Now, having thus tried to draw a parallel between the Spirit's work in
the old and the new creation, let me go on to the practical part of this
evening's meditation, and try to show you, in the second place, that THE
PARALLEL WE HAVE DRAWN FURNISHES MANY ENCOURAGEMENTS.

And, first, it furnishes encouragement to those distressed sinners who fear
that they are utterly beyond the possibility of salvation. &quot;I,&quot; says one,
&quot;am conscious that there is no good in me of any sort whatever, but that I
am so wicked that grim despair has settled down upon my heart.&quot; Listen to
the text, my brother: &quot;The each was without form, and void; and darkness was
upon the face of the deep&quot; Gen 1:2. Is not that an exact description of your
heart? &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; you say, &quot;that is a terribly true picture of myself.&quot;
Well, what comes next? &quot;And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.&quot; While there was confusion, while there was darkness, before there
was any sort of preparation for the coming of the Spirit, any kindling of
flambeaux with which to break the darkness, or anything that would have
seemed like the beginning of order, the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters. Then why should he not move in your soul? Others who were in
just as sad a condition as you are now in, have been saved; then why should
not you also be saved? You have been a gross sinner, but other equally gross
sinner's have received the Spirit of God, who has brought Christ to them, so
why should not you? If thou hast been the vilest of the vile, there is one
text that still gives thee good cheer; it is that one where Paul speaks of
himself as the chief of sinners, and yet declares that he was saved. Thou
canst not be a greater sinner than the chief of sinners; the chief is first
of all, and thou canst only be second to the chief; or if thou art even
equal to him, God has proved His power to save thee by saving Saul of
Tarsus. Think of what Saul's case was like when he was on the road to
Damascus. Why, if that were possible, it was more chaotic than chaos itself,
and darker than the primeval darkness. He was exceedingly mad against the
people of God, and was bent upon their destruction; yet the Spirit of God
came upon him, and within a few minutes he was crying out, &quot;Lord, what wilt
thou have me to do?&quot; Acts 9:6.

Let me further say to thee, poor despairing soul, suppose such an one as
thou art should be saved, would it not be a wonder of grace? &quot;Yes,&quot; you say,
&quot;it, would indeed.&quot; Well, God is the great Wonder-Worker; it is His delight
to do things which are very wonderful, for these bring Him the most glory.
Men can do commonplace things, but wonders are wrought by God. If He were to
save thee, wouldst thou not for ever feel indebted to His grace? &quot;Ay,&quot;
sayest thou, &quot;that I should, if he would take such a black and sinful one as
I am, and save me.&quot; Very well; this is just what He wants in His children,
that they should for ever love Him and praise Him, and feel that they are
under gracious obligations of love to Him. When God means to make a great
saint, He often uses a great sinner as the raw material. It is the man who
is greatly in debt who loves the friend who discharges his debt. If I were a
physician, and I wanted to establish my fame, do you think that I should
trouble about you who have the finger-ache or some other trifling complaint?
No; if I wanted London to ring with the story of my cures, I should try to
find out the man who is nearest to the gates of death, or one who is
afflicted with many diseases at once, for if I healed him, all would be
amazed, and it would be reported everywhere, &quot;This man hath wrought this
great marvel.&quot; Now, Christ is the Physician, and thou art the patient; and
the worse thou art the more glory can he get out of thee. He is certainly
able to save thee, had as thou art, and so he will glorify his name as a
Saviour. &quot;It shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that
shall not be cut off&quot; Isa 55:13. Thus I say unto thee, O soul, though thou
art empty of evening but sin, the Spirit of God can fill thee with grace;
and though darkness enshrouds thee, the Spirit of God can come upon thee,
and make thee light in the Lord. So thou needest not despair, but rather
give thine ear attentively to this word of the Lord Jesus Christ, &quot;He that
believeth and is baptized shall be saved&quot; Mark 16:16; or this, &quot;God so loved
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life&quot; John 3:16. May the Spirit
of God lead thee to believe in Jesus!
There is an equal encouragement in this text for those who are the people of
God, or who once thought that they were, but who have fallen into a very sad
and miserable condition. There are some who have walked in the light of God,
and enjoyed sweet fellowship with Him, but they have been very careless, or
they have neglected private prayer, or perhaps they have fallen into sin,
and now they have got into such a state of heart that they cannot see
anything gracious in themselves. &quot;Oh!&quot; saith such an one, &quot;I am worse than
the sinner who never knew Christ. I feel as if I had played the apostate,
like Judas, or as if I had turned aside, like Demas, loving the present
world, or as if I were a tree without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the
roots. I do feel that, in myself, there is no order of grace, and no light
of love.&quot; Hearken, dear friend, to my text: &quot;And the earth was without form,
and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters&quot; Gen 1:2.

I bless God that I have many a time known what it is, when I felt most
barren, to be made to blossom, and bring forth fruit; and when apparently
most dead, suddenly to be quickened into ecstatic life; and when I have, in
my own estimation, lain at hell's door, yet by one promise applied with
power, by one flash of the divine energy, to be lifted up, and made to say,
even in that place wherein my soul slept, like Jacob did at Bethel, &quot;This is
none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven&quot; Gen 28:17.
Has not the Spirit of God often dealt so with you, experienced saints who
know what the ups and downs of the Christian life are? Has he not made you
strong when you have been weak, and made you to sing just after you had been
sighing, and made the waters to be calmest just after the fiercest storm,
and your brightest days to follow just after the hurricane? Then have you
rejoiced in the clear shining after rain, when the winter was over and gone,
and when the voice of the singing of birds was heard in your land. I know
thou hast found it so; then dost thou now think that the Lord waits to find
some good thing in thee before he will bless thee? Did he not love thee when
thou wast in thy blood, like an infant cast out into the field unwashed and
unswaddled? Dost thou think that his arm is shortened, or that his love is
diminished? You say that you have been unfaithful to him, but he abideth
faithful. Your faith may seem to be dead, but &quot;your life is hid with Christ
in God&quot; Col 3:3. You feel so foul, but:

&quot;There is a fountain, fill'd with blood,
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains?

Do not despair, dear friends; look again to the cross, begin again where you
began before. Remember the simple story that I told you long ago of poor
Jack the Huckster, who used to sing:
&quot;I am a poor sinner, and nothing at all,
But Jesus Christ is my All-in-all.

Get back to that point, dear brother or sister, and so you will get back to
light again, and once more you will realize that the Spirit of God is
working within your spirit.

I think our text also gives encouragement to those who are working for God.
You are not now thinking about yourself; you have, by divine grace, advanced
beyond that stage; and you are thinking about others. You are going to take
a district, and visit it, and there are courts there that swarm with the
worst of characters. You do not know any good people there who are at all
likely to welcome and assist you. Go there, my dear brother, venture there,
my dear sister, without any fear, remembering that, although &quot;the earth was
without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, the
Spirit of God moved upon the waters&quot; Gen 1:2. Go to that dark spot, for the
Spirit of God will go with you. He will guide you through the darkness and
through the chaos, and will help and bless you. Missionaries have gone to
lands where the people were all cannibals, but they have not been
unsuccessful. The gospel has been carried to people who were so degraded
that they did not seem to have any sense of possessing even a soul, yet the
gospel has not been without fruit among them. No race of men has ever been
discovered that has been sunk too low for the Spirit of God to work upon
them, and to save them. Let us never despair of any, or think that they are
beyond the Spirit's power.
&quot;But,&quot; saith one, &quot;I should like to speak to those who are willing to hear
me, and who are anxious to be saved.&quot; No doubt you would, for most people
like easy work; but if the Lord sends you to those who do not wish to be
saved, and who have no care at all about religion, you must not pick and
choose your work, but you must go where God sends you. Would you not like to
go where God would get the most glory? Of course you would. Well, He gets
the most glory when big sinners are saved, when those who hated Him most
begin to love Him, when those who were most opposed to His truth gladly
receive it. Then there is the greatest triumph of His grace, and the
greatest glory to His holy name. I have sometimes thought that I would like
to have lived in England in the days of the Puritans. It must have been a
great privilege to have heard some of those old masters of theology
preaching the gospel, and to have mingled with the holy multitudes that
worshipped God in those days when this land was a very Paradise. But there
is more need of the preacher of the gospel now than ever there was, and
therefore he ought to be glad to be where he is most needed. A good servant
would rather that his master put him where there is plenty for him to do
than let him be where there are more workers than work. I see the thick
clouds of Popery spreading over the land in every direction, and I see
scarcely anything in the signs of the times that tends to cheer one's heart.
I see plenty of comfort in the Scriptures, I have abundant joy in the Lord,
and rest in him; but as for the way in which things are going in all the
churches,-ah, Lord God, how has thy Spirit been restrained, and how little
work does he appear to be doing in these evil times! But because the times
are dark, shall we despair? No, but still remember that when &quot;the earth was
without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep&quot; Gen 1:2;
then &quot;the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&quot;

Was it not so in Christ's own day and in the time of the apostles? The world
was sunk in sin, and superstition, and cruelty; but after Pentecost
thousands were converted. Was it not so in Luther's day? The professing
church, like another Samson, was lulled to sleep upon the lap of the Delilah
of Rome, and the church's locks were utterly shorn, and its strength was
gone, and it was delivered over to the Philistines. But, in due time, the
Spirit of God came into the darkness, and the great truth that we are
justified by faith, and not by the works of the law, was like a repetition
of the ancient command and its sequel, &quot;Let there be light, and there was
light&quot; Gen 1:3. Blessed be God, the darkness of those days could not keep
back the light of Luther's preaching, and Calvin's clear transparent
teaching, and Zwingle's burning words; and if all England should become
black as night, and things grow worse, and worse, and worse, and worse,
until they come to the worst, and Satan lords it over all, there would be no
cause for fear even then. Fearlessly should the soldiers of Christ still go
on, for the Spirit of God will again move when chaos and darkness reign. Be
of good cheer, brethren and sisters in Christ. Pray on, work on, trust on,
and God will indeed bless you.

I earnestly pray that those to whom I have spoken may receive whatever of
truth I have uttered, and especially do I pray this for the seeking sinner.
How I long that he may realize that the only power that can save him lies
outside himself! If you are ever to be accepted before God, you will never
be accepted through anything that you are in yourself. You will have to be
accepted in Christ Jesus; and, in order to be accepted in Christ Jesus, you
must have faith in Jesus. If you are ever to be a living child of the living
God, the Spirit of God must quicken you. There is in you nothing whatever
that can recommend you to God; He and He alone must save you if you are ever
to be saved. &quot;Why,&quot; says one, &quot;you drive me to despair by talking like
that.&quot; I wish I could drive you to such despair as would make you cease from
your own works, and leave off all idea of self-salvation, and make you fall,
as one dead, before the throne of mercy, and cry, &quot;Lord, save me, or I
perish!&quot; We cannot too plainly preach that salvation is of the Lord alone.
Everything that is of nature's spinning will have to be unravelled, and the
soul must be clothed in the spotless robe of the righteousness of Christ.
You may build on the sandy foundation of creature-merit; but all you build
will surely come down. Oh, that you may cease from such foolish building,
and that you may build upon what Jesus Christ has done; then, you will build
upon the rock, the real foundation. If the Spirit of God will enable you to
build there, you will have built for eternity. May grace, mercy, and peace
be with you in so doing, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Amen.
