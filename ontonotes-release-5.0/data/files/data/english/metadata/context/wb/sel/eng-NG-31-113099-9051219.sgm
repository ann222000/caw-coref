So Lugovoi was right and Litvinenko did worked for MI6. Now it's going
to be real fun:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_arti...

Britain is going to walk through harsh times now, I just wonder why they
broke down and confessed. Have Russians corned them with blackmail with
facts about what operation with Polonium really was?

That is apart from now on every Putin's opponent will have to prove that
s/he doesn't work for MI6.

&quot;The former Russian spy poisoned in a London hotel was an MI6 agent,
the Daily Mail can reveal.

Alexander Litvinenko was receiving a retainer of around £2,000 a month
from the British security services at the time he was murdered.

The disclosure, by diplomatic and intelligence sources,
is the latest twist in the Litvinenko affair, &quot;

O.k.! That's the daily mail's claim.
Now where's their evidence?
And even IF.
What exculpatory evidence does it provide to exonerate Lugovoi
from being the agent who commited the murder of Litvinenko?

Or are you suggesting somehow that it justifies it?

It doesn't mater where you go in the Anglo-Saxon world

Well,
I am not about to shed any crocodile tears for an agent that

If Lugovoy was disgusted and found it necesary to kill that
cheap SOW, that is magnitudes less of an ethical issue
than the entire MI6 working for the Iraqi slaughter-house of

You are totally confused what from now will be the problem for Britain:
it is not any longer death of their secret agent - this is normal around
the world. It is that this agent, why in Her Majesty service was
involved in planning to illegally (and violently) overthrow Russian
government.
As you understand *every* government in the world is very hostile to
such activities and will fully support *any* kind of retaliation action
on the part of Russian government. Indeed not long ago such game would
have ended up in the declaration of war.
EU will be very upset with Britain again, the ex-empire basically
denigrated itself to the status of a country which is not to be taken
seriously and one has now to contact to its supervisor to demand to talk
sense in the delinquent.

All Neocon &quot;governments&quot; are now run by the Mafiosos of the War Industrial
Complex. Litvinenko was deeply involved in the monkey business with Mafia,
and knew too much. He was considering defecting back to Russia. Even the
slightest suspicion of Russians learning the Navzlin-Boris-Semyon Mogilevich
connection in arms diamonds and drugs, would be a disaster for them. They
had to get rid of him!

There is no smoking gun in Kremlin, ergo no confirmation. Besides, the
suspect Lugovoy claims (and UK keeps silent on his claims) that he was
invited to London by Litivinenko and his masters form a security firm
in London (ergo MI6 &amp; Co), and Polonium traces originated from London,
not Moscow. Apparently Lugovoy was clean before he met those security
gentlemen (who tried to hire him to spy on Putin - so sez Lugovoy). I
would say London is behind the assassination, not Moscow.

Reportedly he wanted to also betray MI6 and Berezovsky. So they had
even more reasons, given that the guy was a schizo supplying their
masters with plain fictions and (presumably) selling Polonium to
Chechen mafia... and hey, we learned that he converted to Islamism!

It doesn't prove it since the MI6 had more of a reason to kill useless
to them agent
and make it look like Lugovoy did it.

Just look at lousy sums they were paying him for the charcter smear
against Putin.

Obviously the MI6 was not satisfied with his poor work performance and
decided
to kill two birds with one stone, terminating Litvinenko's contract by
killing him
and then blaming it on Russia.

They should have used a less exotic poison but they wanted him to die
slow
to make a long Anti-Russian media coverage possible.

Elementary, Watson!:)

If Lugovoy was disgusted and found it necesary to kill that
cheap SOW, that is magnitudes less of an ethical issue
than the entire MI6 working for the Iraqi slaughter-house of
the private global bank of Rothschilds.

- dude, noone cares about that &quot;rothschilds&quot; crap. if the man was only
getting paid 2000/month he must not have been much of an agent. it seems
more like some sort of pension. hardly the caliber of agent befitting a fate

1814: With regard to the $3,000,000 Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau
had entrusted to Mayer Amschel Rothschild for safekeeping, for an
account of what happened next we turn to the Jewish Encyclopaedia,
1905 edition, Volume 10, page 494, which states,

&quot;According to legend this money was hidden away in wine casks, and,
escaping the search of Napoleon's soldiers when they entered
Frankfurt, was restored intact in the same casks in 1814, when the
elector (Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau) returned to the electorate
(Germany). The facts are somewhat less romantic, and more
businesslike.&quot;

This last line indicates the money was never returned by Rothschild to
Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau. The encyclopaedia goes on to state,

&quot;Nathan Mayer Rothschild invested this $3,000,000 in, gold from the
East India Company knowing that it would be needed for Wellington's
peninsula campaign.&quot;

On the stolen money Nathan made, &quot;no less than four profits:

i) On the sale of Wellington's paper which he bought at 50 cents on
the dollar and collected at par;
ii) on the sale of gold to Wellington;
iii) on its repurchase; and
iv) on forwarding it to Portugal.&quot;

1815: The five Rothschild brothers work to supply gold to both
Wellington's army (through Nathan in England) and Napoleon's army
(through Jacob in France), and begin their policy of funding both
sides in wars.

Due to the fact that these brothers had banks spread out across Europe
this also gave them the opportunity to set up an unrivalled postal
service network of secret routes and fast couriers, and the post they
carried could be opened up by these couriers and their details given
to the Rothschilds so they always were one step ahead of current
events.

Furthermore, these Rothschild couriers were the only merchants allowed
to pass through the English and French blockades. It was these
couriers who also kept Nathan Mayer Rothschild up to date with how the
war was going so he could use that intelligence to buy and sell from
his position on the stock exchange in accordance with that
intelligence.

At that time British bonds were called consuls and they were traded on
the floor of the stock exchange. Nathan Mayer Rothschild instructed
all his workers on the floor to start selling consuls. The made all
the other traders believe that the British had lost the war so they
started selling frantically.

Therefore the consuls plummeted in value which was when Nathan Mayer
Rothschild discreetly instructed his workers to purchase all the
consuls they could lay their hands on.

When news came through that the British had actually won the war, the
consuls went up to a level even higher than before the war ended
leaving Nathan Mayer Rothschild with a return of approximately 20 to 1
on his investment.

This gave the Rothschild family complete control of the British
economy, now the financial centre of the world following Napolean's
defeat, and forced England to set up a new Bank of England, which
Nathan Mayer Rothschild controlled. Nathan Mayer Rothschild would
later state,

&quot;I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule
the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain's
money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British
money supply.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Good job, Makarenko. Ergo logic rules. Now back to MI6 &amp; Co, looking
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; from German perspective the Brits just got poor and stupid. They are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; being clueless pawn in big guys' game these days.

&gt; &gt;&gt; which &quot;big guys&quot;? are you going to try to connect him to the CIA or
&gt; &gt;&gt; somesuch
&gt; &gt;&gt; entity? like it or not, britain still carries mucho clout on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; international stage.

&gt; &gt; 1814: With regard to the $3,000,000 Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau
&gt; &gt; had entrusted to Mayer Amschel Rothschild for safekeeping, for an
&gt; &gt; account of what happened next we turn to the Jewish Encyclopaedia,
&gt; &gt; 1905 edition, Volume 10, page 494, which states,

&gt; &gt; &quot;According to legend this money was hidden away in wine casks, and,
&gt; &gt; escaping the search of Napoleon's soldiers when they entered
&gt; &gt; Frankfurt, was restored intact in the same casks in 1814, when the
&gt; &gt; elector (Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau) returned to the electorate
&gt; &gt; (Germany). The facts are somewhat less romantic, and more
&gt; &gt; businesslike.&quot;

&gt; &gt; This last line indicates the money was never returned by Rothschild to
&gt; &gt; Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau. The encyclopaedia goes on to state,

&gt; &gt; &quot;Nathan Mayer Rothschild invested this $3,000,000 in, gold from the
&gt; &gt; East India Company knowing that it would be needed for Wellington's
&gt; &gt; peninsula campaign.&quot;

&gt; &gt; On the stolen money Nathan made, &quot;no less than four profits:

&gt; &gt; i) On the sale of Wellington's paper which he bought at 50 cents on
&gt; &gt; the dollar and collected at par;
&gt; &gt; ii) on the sale of gold to Wellington;
&gt; &gt; iii) on its repurchase; and
&gt; &gt; iv) on forwarding it to Portugal.&quot;

&gt; &gt; 1815: The five Rothschild brothers work to supply gold to both
&gt; &gt; Wellington's army (through Nathan in England) and Napoleon's army
&gt; &gt; (through Jacob in France), and begin their policy of funding both
&gt; &gt; sides in wars.

&gt; &gt; Due to the fact that these brothers had banks spread out across Europe
&gt; &gt; this also gave them the opportunity to set up an unrivalled postal
&gt; &gt; service network of secret routes and fast couriers, and the post they
&gt; &gt; carried could be opened up by these couriers and their details given
&gt; &gt; to the Rothschilds so they always were one step ahead of current
&gt; &gt; events.

&gt; &gt; Furthermore, these Rothschild couriers were the only merchants allowed
&gt; &gt; to pass through the English and French blockades. It was these
&gt; &gt; couriers who also kept Nathan Mayer Rothschild up to date with how the
&gt; &gt; war was going so he could use that intelligence to buy and sell from
&gt; &gt; his position on the stock exchange in accordance with that
&gt; &gt; intelligence.

&gt; &gt; At that time British bonds were called consuls and they were traded on
&gt; &gt; the floor of the stock exchange. Nathan Mayer Rothschild instructed
&gt; &gt; all his workers on the floor to start selling consuls. The made all
&gt; &gt; the other traders believe that the British had lost the war so they
&gt; &gt; started selling frantically.

&gt; &gt; Therefore the consuls plummeted in value which was when Nathan Mayer
&gt; &gt; Rothschild discreetly instructed his workers to purchase all the
&gt; &gt; consuls they could lay their hands on.

&gt; &gt; When news came through that the British had actually won the war, the
&gt; &gt; consuls went up to a level even higher than before the war ended
&gt; &gt; leaving Nathan Mayer Rothschild with a return of approximately 20 to 1
&gt; &gt; on his investment.

&gt; &gt; This gave the Rothschild family complete control of the British
&gt; &gt; economy, now the financial centre of the world following Napolean's
&gt; &gt; defeat, and forced England to set up a new Bank of England, which
&gt; &gt; Nathan Mayer Rothschild controlled. Nathan Mayer Rothschild would
&gt; &gt; later state,

&gt; &gt; &quot;I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule
&gt; &gt; the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain's
&gt; &gt; money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British
&gt; &gt; money supply.&quot;

Conspiracy theorist &quot;captain&quot; doesn't care for facts.  Litvinenko was a self-discredited

Putin staged the 1999 apartment bombings as a pretext to invade Chechnya that he
NEVER produced. Like Russia needed a pretext after Chechen forces invaded Russia first,
perhaps we'll see NATO condemnation of Turkey soon over its response to the PKK...not).
Nobody stopped Politkovskaya during all the years of the Chechen war when her voice mattered

The Polonium story is the most inane conspiracy theory ever.  It shows the

Stupid Russians would use a weapon that advertises itself and would leave

LOL. I'm not an Argentinian, that's for sure. Now Germany's military
strong neighbors are Russia and France .... and Israel down there ...

Germans are pussies. They say they have troops in Afghan but no one can find
them because they are all hiding in caves.

Putin couldn't care less about Germany other than receiving payments for
oil. The Deutsche-dopes pay better than the Ukes and Byelorusskis.

The only thing keeping Germany alive is the fact that the Russian army is
totally disfunctional and corrupt. Ever hear of the Putin-Putin secret
conventions treaty?

- this isn't just about germany. if it was i would have said something like,
&quot; the UK's economic dominance over germany&quot;. of course i'd never say that.

the UK's economic might dominates the individual economies of most nations
on earth percentage-wise.

-lol, yeah, okay.. we'd fight either russia or the usa... why not both at
the same time even? that would be like denmark going to war with germany
times 10. last drop of blood alright.... ours! besides, it's just
speculation on your part. what will most likely happen is that the usa,
norway,denmark(greenland), russia, and canada will carve up the territory in
relative slices or reach a cooperative open market agreement of some sort. i
prefer the second option. relations between canada/usa and canada/russia are
both good... and i'm glad for that :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Britain is going to walk through harsh times now, I just wonder why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they broke down and confessed. Have Russians corned them with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blackmail with facts about what operation with Polonium really was?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The former Russian spy poisoned in a London hotel was an MI6 agent,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Daily Mail can reveal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Alexander Litvinenko was receiving a retainer of around £2,000 a month
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the British security services at the time he was murdered.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The disclosure, by diplomatic and intelligence sources,
&gt;&gt;&gt; is the latest twist in the Litvinenko affair, &quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; O.k.! That's the daily mail's claim.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now where's their evidence?
&gt;&gt;&gt; And even IF.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What exculpatory evidence does it provide to exonerate Lugovoi
&gt;&gt;&gt; from being the agent who commited the murder of Litvinenko?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Or are you suggesting somehow that it justifies it?

&gt;&gt; You are totally confused what from now will be the problem for
&gt;&gt; Britain: it is not any longer death of their secret agent - this is
&gt;&gt; normal around the world. It is that this agent, why in Her Majesty
&gt;&gt; service was involved in planning to illegally (and violently)
&gt;&gt; overthrow Russian government.
&gt;&gt; As you understand *every* government in the world is very hostile to
&gt;&gt; such activities and will fully support *any* kind of retaliation
&gt;&gt; action on the part of Russian government. Indeed not long ago such
&gt;&gt; game would have ended up in the declaration of war.
&gt;&gt; EU will be very upset with Britain again, the ex-empire basically
&gt;&gt; denigrated itself to the status of a country which is not to be taken
&gt;&gt; seriously and one has now to contact to its supervisor to demand to

Rostyk, what is your pathos about? DM said it - sources are anonymous.
If you do not like it - write a complain to NYT. Or give me A SINGLE
DATE when I can read NYT without reference to &quot;anonymous&quot;.

Now, your concern is legitimate, but - I have two reasons to think
otherwise: one formal, one informal.

Formal: DM refers to TWO independent sources - foreign office and secret
service.
Informal: among Russophobes the DM is a Roitweller, and if they throw in
such supposedly &quot;pro Russian&quot; news it may mean only one thing: they know
it is going public with them or without them.
