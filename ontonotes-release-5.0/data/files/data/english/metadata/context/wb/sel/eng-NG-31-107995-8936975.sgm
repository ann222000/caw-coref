&quot;Childrens do learn,&quot; Bush tells school kids

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Offering a grammar lesson guaranteed to make any English
teacher cringe, President George W. Bush told a group of New York school kids on
Wednesday: &quot;Childrens do learn.&quot;

Bush made his latest grammatical slip-up at a made-for-TV event where he urged
Congress to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act, the centerpiece of his
education policy, as he touted a new national report card on improved test
scores.

The event drew New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Education Secretary Margaret
Spellings plus teachers and about 20 fourth and fifth graders from P.S. 76.

During his first presidential campaign, Bush -- who promised to be the
&quot;education president&quot; -- once asked: &quot;Is our children learning?&quot;

On Wednesday, Bush seemed to answer his own question with the same kind of
grammatical twist.

&quot;As yesterday's positive report card shows, childrens do learn when standards
are high and results are measured,&quot; he said.

The White House opted to clean up Bush's diction in the official transcript.

Bush is no stranger to verbal gaffes. He often acknowledges he was no more than
an average student in school and jokes about his habit of mangling the English
language.

Just a day earlier, the White House inadvertently showed how it tries to prevent
Bush from making even more slips of the tongue than he already does.

As Bush addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, a marked-up draft of his
speech briefly popped up on the U.N. Web site, complete with a phonetic
pronunciation guide to get him past troublesome names of countries and world
leaders.

I can't imagine how Einstein and George Bush would ever wind up in the same
sentence unless is was to compare genius to retardation.

All the evidence amassed over the years showing the average intelligence
(being generous) and poor education of president Bush is now overwhelming.
Despite attending the best educational facilities and having come from
parents of above average intelligence it's clear that George Bush is only
average. His education has also been shown to be deficient even though he
went to the finest schools. None of this is in dispute any more.
When campaigning for the presidency Bush was touted as being someone you
would want to have a beer with. The idea being that he fit in with &quot;regular&quot;
folks and that he wasn't part of the elite or the egg head class of
intellectuals, as if this was a positive attribute. After seeing how someone
of average intelligence and less than average ability does at running the
United States I can only hope that Americans have learned their lesson.
Being ordinary isn't a good thing in a president. What we need for the job
is extraordinary. Being president is a hard job and it takes a lot of brains
and education. Hopefully, we will never pick someone average again now that
we know how poorly an average man does as president. At least one named
Bush.

Not only did they know them they were proud of them. Not being superior was
actually a positive for them, which is really scary. It was as if they
didn't want someone with high skills as president because that would mean he
was not of the common class like them. They wanted someone like them even
though that meant he wouldn't be up to the job.

I think it says more about how bad the two party system is so that no matter
who the other party runs for president people won't vote for him because
he's not a member of their party. By any standard John Kerry had it all over
Bush. He had a real military record as a combat veteran, he was a lawyer, he
was a repeatedly reelected senator, and he could actually speak with a high
degree of articulation. Yet they chose Bush instead. Really only because of
his party and family name. That's pretty sad. But not uncommon. It's why
they came up with the phrase &quot;throwing pearls before swine&quot; so long ago. It
applied then as now. There is a lot of things wrong with the election system

Please remember that Kerry got slightly poorer grades at Yale.  Plus
he was a lawyer.  Not a plus in my opinion.  Bush on the other hand
went to Business School.

Also Kerry has a long record of being a senator, but almost no record
of creating laws that were good.  In other words a senator with a
record of having done very little original thinking.  And while he can
speak well, he seems to  have no thoughts.  And no experience in
administrating anything.   And had Edwards, another lawyer and senator
(who was not reelected) as his running mate.

Bush has not done well, but Kerry would have been a worse disaster.
We may have to hold our noses when we vote for the next president.

Although I agree with your observations on Kerry, I doubt he would have been

You're right that Kerry's grades were not good in college either, which did
surprise me. But he did graduate from law school and passed the bar exam,
which I would say is considerably more difficult than simply getting a
business degree. Especially when whe know Bush did poorly in college. You
can't do that poorly in law school and still graduate and passing the bar
exam is not easy. JFK junior had to take it several times before he passed
and he was no dummy. Kerry also worked as a prosecutor as well. The fact is
Kerry's resume is far superior to Bush's.

You can say Kerry has no original thinking but I see no support for that.
The point was that Kerry ran and was reelected to the Senate more than once.
That in itself is nothing to sneeze at. The senate is a collaborative body.
Few individuals dominate there. Just being one of the 100 is enough of a
political accomplishment. It's a lot harder than winning the governorship
for two terms in Texas, which was my point. Bush's political career was one
term as governor and the second term all he did was run for president while
Kerry is a legitimate senator and a long standing one.

Bush has the record as the most unpopular president in the polls. He's set
to go down as the worst president ever. By any stretch he's going to be in
the group of worst presidents in our history. I seriously doubt that would
be the case for either Gore or Kerry. Neither one of them may have been
great but the odds are they would not have been the disaster as president
Bush is. Face it, we would have been far better off if Bush had lost. If you
are a multimillionaire or business big shot that isn't the case but I
suspect you are not either of those. Pretty much the whole world would have
been better off with Kerry in the White House and I say that as someone who
never like him that much myself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Einstein often forgot his shoes and/or socks.

&gt;&gt; I can't imagine how Einstein and George Bush would ever wind up in the
&gt;&gt; same
&gt;&gt; sentence unless is was to compare genius to retardation.

&gt;&gt; All the evidence amassed over the years showing the average intelligence
&gt;&gt; (being generous) and poor education of president Bush is now overwhelming.
&gt;&gt; Despite attending the best educational facilities and having come from
&gt;&gt; parents of above average intelligence it's clear that George Bush is only
&gt;&gt; average. His education has also been shown to be deficient even though he
&gt;&gt; went to the finest schools. None of this is in dispute any more.
&gt;&gt; When campaigning for the presidency Bush was touted as being someone you
&gt;&gt; would want to have a beer with. The idea being that he fit in with
&gt;&gt; &quot;regular&quot;
&gt;&gt; folks and that he wasn't part of the elite or the egg head class of
&gt;&gt; intellectuals, as if this was a positive attribute. After seeing how
&gt;&gt; someone
&gt;&gt; of average intelligence and less than average ability does at running the
&gt;&gt; United States I can only hope that Americans have learned their lesson.
&gt;&gt; Being ordinary isn't a good thing in a president. What we need for the job
&gt;&gt; is extraordinary. Being president is a hard job and it takes a lot of
&gt;&gt; brains
&gt;&gt; and education. Hopefully, we will never pick someone average again now
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; we know how poorly an average man does as president. At least one named
&gt;&gt; Bush.

&gt;&gt; Hawke

&gt;I think he has slightly above average intelligence but he's not Ivy League
&gt;material. The real problem is he's lazy, a dry drunk, a misguided zealot and
&gt;neocon dupe.

&gt;&gt; Please remember that Kerry got slightly poorer grades at Yale.  Plus
&gt;&gt; he was a lawyer.  Not a plus in my opinion.  Bush on the other hand
&gt;&gt; went to Business School.

&gt;&gt; Also Kerry has a long record of being a senator, but almost no record
&gt;&gt; of creating laws that were good.  In other words a senator with a
&gt;&gt; record of having done very little original thinking.  And while he can
&gt;&gt; speak well, he seems to  have no thoughts.  And no experience in
&gt;&gt; administrating anything.   And had Edwards, another lawyer and senator
&gt;&gt; (who was not reelected) as his running mate.

&gt;&gt; Bush has not done well, but Kerry would have been a worse disaster.

&gt;Although I agree with your observations on Kerry, I doubt he would have been
&gt;a worse disaster. I think Bush is an outlier in that regard. He still has
&gt;time to leave an even worse legacy  by starting a war with Iran.

It may be true that all assholes stink. But that is not something I know
anything about and will leave that to your expertise on the subject.
Opinions are another matter. Unlike assholes all opinions do not stink. Some
people actually have fine and well thought out opinions. Yours, on the other
hand, do fit in the category with assholes. They do indeed stink; a lot!
