It's not often that results of herbal clinical trials are published in
a peer-reviewed medical journal. One herb, Rhodiola rosea, has just
had such an honor, and came out as very powerful support for those
with mild-to-moderate depression. The abstract for this double-blind,
placebo controlled study is show below. But first, a bit of general
information about Rhodiola.

This tonic herb dates back to the early history of Scandinavia. Viking
kings passed laws that prohibited taking more than a certain amount of
root out of the ground, as the plant was valuable as a medicine and in
demand by their trading partners. In 1943, this herb was discovered to
be one of a category called &quot;adaptogens&quot; by scientists working under
top-secret &quot;Order #4654P of the People's Commissar's Council of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot;

This secret research was being conducted to improve the stamina and
performance of soldiers and Olympic athletes.

As originally defined by the Soviets, an adaptogen was a substance
that had to 1) show some non-specific effect, such as increasing
bodily resistance to physical stress, chemical stress, or biologically
noxious agents, 2) have a normalizing effect on the pathology, and 3)
be innocuous and not disturb bodily functions at normal levels. In
other words, adaptogens help the body resist the effects of stress of
all kinds and help to normalize the workings of the body. These plants
identified by Soviet scientists were indeed special tonics.

Rhodiola was one of the original adaptogens identified in this early
work, which also included Eleutherococcus senticosus, Schizandra
chinensis and several other botanicals -- each of which had the common
effects of the adaptogen category, along with specific advantages for
each herb in a given area. For Rhodiola, it was energy and mood
elevation.

Much of the Vikings early use of Rhodiola would later be substantiated
by clinical trials performed by a variety of academic researchers in
Russia, Sweden and other parts of the world where these plants grow.
Those benefits include protection against stress, support of a
positive mood, mental clarity, and assistance in bringing the body
back to its normal level of energy. Most of the modern clinical trials
(non-Russian) on Rhodiola have been done with a variant of the herb
called SHR-5. Here's the abstract for this research from the September
2007 issue of the Nordic Journal of Psychiatry (V. 61, No. 5):

SHR-5 Rhodiola rosea and the Treatment of Depression

Abstract: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and
safety of standardized extract SHR-5 (Arctic RootÂ®) of rhizomes of
Rhodiola rosea L. in patients suffering from a current episode of mild/
moderate depression. The phase III clinical trial was carried out as a
randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study with parallel groups
over 6 weeks. Participants, males and females aged 18-70 years, were
selected according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for depression, the
severity of which was determined by scores gained in Beck Depression
Inventory and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD)
questionnaires. Patients with initial HAMD scores between 21-31 were
randomised into three groups, one of which (group A: 30 patients)
received two tablets daily of SHR-5 (340 mg/day), a second (group B:
29 patients) received two tablets twice-per-day of SHR-5 (680 mg/day),
and a third (group C: 29 patients) received two placebo tablets daily.
The efficacy of SHR-5 extract with respect to depressive complaints
was assessed on days 0 and 42 of the study period from total and
specific subgroup HAMD scores. For individuals in groups A and B,
overall depression together with insomnia, emotional instability and
somatisation, but not self-esteem, improved significantly following
medication, whilst the placebo group did not show such improvements.
No serious side effects were reported in any of the groups A-C. It is
concluded that the standardized extract SHR-5 shows anti-depressive
potency in patients with mild to moderate depression when administered
in dosages of either 340 or 680 mg/day over a 6 week period.
