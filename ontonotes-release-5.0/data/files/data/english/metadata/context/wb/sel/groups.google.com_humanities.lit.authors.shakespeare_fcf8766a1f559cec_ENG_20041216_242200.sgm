Edmund Spenser The Man on the Stair
by MATHER WALKER November 2000

&lt;&lt;A handsome folio edition of the works of Spenser published in
1679 had a picture of Spenser's tombstone in Westminster Abbey.

HEARE LYES (EXPECTING THE SECOND
COMMINGE OF OUR SAVIOVR CHRIST
IESVS) THE BODY OF EDMOND SPENCER
THE PRINCE OF POETS IN HIS TYME
WHOSE DIVINE SPIRIT NEEDS NOE
OTHIR WITNESS THEN THE WORKS
WHICH HE LEFT BEHIND HIM
HE WAS BORNE IN LONDON
IN THE YEARE 1510 AND
DIED IN THE YEARE
1596

In 1778 (when his tablet in Westminster Abbey
was restored) the dates were altered to read:

&quot;He was born in London in the yeare 1553
and died in the yeare 1598&quot;.

NO-E O-THIR WITNESS: &quot;SIEH ALL&quot; =&gt;&quot;HEIMDALL&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------------
HEIMDALL by Micha F. Lindemans

&lt;&lt;HEIMDALL is the god of light, the son of nine mothers. He was born
at the end of the world and raised by the force of the earth, seawater
&amp; the blood of a BOAR. Because of his shining, golden teeth he is also
called Gullintani (&quot;gold tooth&quot;). His hall is Himinbjorg, The Cliffs
of Heaven, and his horse is Gulltop. HEIMDALL carries the horn Gjallar.

He is the watchman of the gods and guards Bifrost, the only entrance
to Asgard, the realm of the gods. It is HEIMDALL's duty to prevent the
giants from forcing their way into Asgard. He requires less sleep than
a bird &amp; can see a hundred miles around him, by night as well as by day.
His hearing is so accurate that no sound escapes him: he can even hear
the grass grow or the wool on a sheep's back. At the final conflict
of Ragnarok he will kill his age-old enemy, the evil god Loki,
but will die himself from his wounds.

As the god Rig (&quot;ruler&quot;), HEIMDALL created the 3 races of mankind:
the SERFs, the peasants, and the warriors. It is interesting to note
why HEIMDALL fathered them, and not Odin as might be expected.
(Furthermore, HEIMDALL is in many attributes identical with Tyr.)
--------------------------------------------------------------
NO-E O-THIR WITNESS: &quot;SIEH ALL&quot; =&gt;&quot;THRALL&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------------
THRALL by Micha F. Lindemans

&lt;&lt;On his first of 3 travels, the god Rig (who is actually HEIMDALL)
came upon a farmstead. In the kitchen sat AI and his wife EDDA,
Great Grandfather &amp; Great Grandmother. They were friendly people and
offered Rig shelter and food, although the latter was of poor quality.
At night, Rig slept between the farmer and his wife, and nine months
later Edda gave birth to a son. They named him THRALL (&quot;SERF&quot;).

THRALL grew up a strong, but very ugly man who was capable of doing hard
labor. He married THIR (&quot;drudge&quot;), and they had twelve sons and nine
daughters. Their children all received ordinary names and were raised
to do the heavy work of farming. Thus the race of SERFs was created.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------
THRALL(&quot;SERF&quot;) &amp; THIR(&quot;drudge&quot;)

Snorre Sturlasson's Elder Edda

&quot;Came to his cot a crook-legged wench--
were her soles dirty, and sunburnt her arms,
her nose bent downward; her name was THIR.&quot;

The name VAVASOR means literally &quot;A CHIEF OF VASSALS.&quot;

Sonnet 58

That god forbid that made me first your slave,
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
Being your VASSAL, bound to stay your leisure.

Sonnet 141

But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee.
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart's slave and VASSAL wretch to be.
------------------------------------------------------
Sonnet 154

The little Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of TRUE hearts had warmed,
And so the general of hot desire
Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.
This brand she QUENCHED in a cool well by,
Which from love's fire took heat perpetual,
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' THRALL,
Came there there for cure, and this by that I prove:
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
-------------------------------------------------------
good Mistress' THRALL
----------------------------------------------------------
Witty above her sex, but that's not all,
Wise to salvation was good Mistress HALL;
Something of Shakespeare was in that, but this
Wholly of him with whom she's now in bliss.
-----------------------------------------------------------
&quot;On 15 July, 1613, Susanna sued John Lane, Jr., for slander
in the consistory court at Worcester Cathedral, because
'about 5 weeks past the defendent reported that the plaintiff had
the running of the reins and had been naught with Rafe Smith at John
Palmer'. (To have 'the running of the reins' was to suffer from
gonorrhea ('reins=kidneys or loins); but gonorrhoea did not then
necessarily denote venereal infection, although in this context that
appears to be what is meant.*)&quot; (Schoenbaum _William Shakespeare).
---------------------------------------------------------------
_Connecticut Yankee_ by Mark Twain

&lt;&lt;&quot;It is well and TRULY said! How wonderful is TRUTH,
come it in whatsoEVER unexpected form it may!
Yes, he must bring out seats and food for both, and
in serving us present not EWER and NAPKIN with
more show of respect to the one than to the other.&quot;

&quot;And there is even yet a detail that needs correcting.
He must bring nothing outside; we will go in --
in among the dirt, and possibly other repulsive things,
-- and take the food with the household, and after the
fashion of the house, and all on equal terms, except the
man be of the SERF class; and finally, there will be
no EWER and no NAPKIN, whether he be SERF or free.&quot;&gt;&gt;

Alexander Porphyrievich Borodin
http:/webserver.rcds.rye.ny.us/id/Music/Borodin%20page/Borodin.html

&lt;&lt;Alexander Porfir'yevich Borodin was born Tuesday, November 12, 1833
in Georgia, the illegitimate son of a SERF and a Georgian prince. His
mother later married a retired doctor, and Alexander was brought up
in St. Petersburg with a good education. He got into the Academy of
Medicine in St. Petersburg in 1850 where he studied to become a
scientist. From 1864 until his death in 1887, he was a professor of
chemistry at the St. Petersburg Military Academy; he both taught and
did research. He worked hard to establish a medical school for women
in Russia. Women were not admitted to the Academy, although there was
some relaxation of the restrictions during the more liberal 1860's.
Borodin's laboratory became the first place women were legally
allowed to study medicine, but the right was eventually revoked
by order of the repressive regime of Tsar Alexander III.

Borodin dropped dead of a stroke at a party
Monday, February 28, 1887 in St. Petersburg, Russia.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The man known as Kvasir wandered the world teaching wisdom
to those he met. He once came to feast with some dwarves,
Fjalar &amp; Galar. These two called him aside for a private
word and killed him, letting his blood run into two crocks
&amp; one kettle. The kettle was called Odrorir and the crocks
were known as Son &amp; Bodhn. The dwarves mixed this blood
with HONEY and this mixture became the MEAD which makes
whoever drinks of it a poet or scholar. The dwarves told
the Ã†sir that Kvasir had choked with learning because
there was no one who could compete with him in knowledge.

Odhinn left Asgard one day and happened upon nine SERFs
mowing hay. He offered to sharpen their scythes and they
agreed. Odhinn took a hone and edged their tools and the
SERFs thought the tools cut much better and wanted to buy
the hone. Odhinn said the one who bought it should pay
by giving a banquet. The SERFs replied they were all
willing to do this and asked him to hand over the hone.
Odhinn threw the hone into the air and in their
efforts to catch it the SERFs killed one another.

Odhinn sought lodging that night with the giant Baugi.
Baugi said things were not going well for him
since he had found nine of his SERFs killed and had
no hope of finding other labourers. Odhinn, using
the name Bolverk, offered to do the work of nine men
for the rest of the season in exchange for one drink
of Suttung's MEAD... At the end of the summer Bolverk
presented himself to his master and asked for his reward.

Odhinn flew to the vessels that had been prepared and
spat the MEAD into the crocks with such force and
urgency that A FEW DROPS OF THE MEAD fell and
this became the poetasters' share. Anyone tasting this MEAD
would gain the ability to compose world renown poetry.&gt;&gt;

GULLI-VER's Travels - by Jonathan Swift
[A further account of Glubbdubdrib.
Ancient and modern history corrected.]

I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.
I saw most of the first Roman emperors. I prevailed on the governor
to call up Heliogabalus's cooks to dress us a dinner, but they
could not show us much of their skill, for want of materials.
A HELOT of Agesilaus made us a dish of Spartan broth,
but I was not able to get down a second spoonful.
------------------------------------------------------
&quot;HELOT / MASON JOY&quot;
&quot;J.THOMAS LOONEY&quot;
------------------------------------------------------
HELOTS: the SERFs of the ancient Spartans. The word was derived
in antiquity from the town of Helos in Laconia, but is more probably
connected with ~Xos, a fen, or with the root of ~XeIv, to capture.
After the second Messenian war the conquered Messenians were reduced
to the status of HELOTs, from which Epaminondas liberated them
three centuries later after the battle of Leuctra (371 B.c.).

The HELOTs were state slaves bound to the soil assigned to
individual Spartiates to till their holdings; their masters could
neither emancipate them nor sell them off the land, and they were under
an oath not to raise the rent payable yearly in kind by the HELOTs. In
time of war they served as light-armed troops or as rowers in the fleet;
from the Peloponnesian War onwards they were occasionally employed as
heavy infantry, distinguished bravery being rewarded by emancipation.
That the general attitude of the Spartans towards them was one of
distrust and cruelty cannot be doubted. Aristotle says that the ephors
of each year on entering office declared war on the HELOTs so that they
might be put to death at any time without violating religious scruple
(Plutarch, Lycurgus 28), and we have a well-attested record of 2000
HELOTs being freed for service in war and then secretly assassinated
(Thuc. iv. 8o). But when we remember the value of the HELOTs from
a military and agricultural point of view we shall not readily believe
that the crypteia was really, as some authors represent it, an organized
system of massacre; we shall see in it a good police training,
inculcating hardihood and vigour in the young, while at the same time
getting rid of any HELOT found to be plotting against the state.
------------------------------------------------------

Frey: God of weather, generation and fertility. He was more popular and
more genuine then Balder. He ruled over the land of the light elves,
Alfheim. He received Alfheim as a gift from the Aesir when he as a child
had his first tooth. He was the son of Njord and Njord's sister Nerthus,
and the brother of Freya. His stepmother was Skadi. To make peace, the
Aesir and Vanir exchanged hostages. He, along with Njord and Freya, were
sent by the Vanir to dwell with the Aesir. He owned the ship Skidbladnir
which was made for him by dwarfs. It could sail on the land, sea,
or through the air. It was large enough to hold all the gods,
yet it could be folded up and fit into a pocket.

He also owned a chariot drawn by two boars,Slidrugtanni and Gullinbursti
(golden-bristled). It was made by dwarfs for Loki to give to Frey.

His name means &quot;Lord&quot; and it is thought that he at one time was the
consort of his sister Freya (Lady). His wife was Gerd, a beautiful
giantess who he fell in love with when he espied her from
Odin's throne. He sent his servant, Skirnir, to win her for him.
After Skirnir had threatened her, she agreed to
give herself to Frey in nine nights at the forest Barri.

At the RagnarÃ¶k, Frey will be killed by the fire giant Surt.
------------------------------------------------------

Ragnarok (&quot;Doom of the Gods&quot;), also called Gotterdammerung, means the
end of the cosmos in Norse mythology. It will be preceded by Fimbulvetr,
the winter of winters. Three such winters will follow each other with no
summers in between. Conflicts and feuds will break out, even between
families, and all morality will disappear. This is the beginning of the
end. The wolf Skoll will finally devour the sun, and his brother Hati
will eat the moon, plunging the earth [into] darkness. The stars will
vanish from the sky. The cock Fjalar will crow to the giants and
the golden cock Gullinkambi will crow to the gods.
A THIRd cock will raise the dead.

The earth will shudder with earthquakes, and every bond and fetter will
burst, freeing the terrible wolf Fenrir. The sea will rear up because
Jormungand, the Midgard Serpent, is twisting and writhing in fury as he
makes his way toward the land. With every breath, Jormungand will stain
the soil and the sky with his poison. The waves caused by the serpent's
emerging will set free the ship Naglfar, and with the giant Hymir
as their commander, the giants will sail towards the battlefield.
From the realm of the dead a second ship will set sail, and this
ship carries the inhabitants of hell, with Loki as their helmsman.
The fire giants, led by the giant Surt, will leave Muspell
in the south to join against the gods. Surt, carrying
a sword that blazes like the sun itself, will scorch the earth.

Meanwhile, HEIMDALL will sound his horn, calling the sons of Odin
and the heroes to the battlefield. From all the corners of the world,
gods, giants, dwarves, demons and elves will ride towards the huge
plain of Vigrid (&quot;battle shaker&quot;) where the last battle will be fought.

Odin will engage Fenrir in battle, and Thor will attack Jormungand.
Thor will victorious, but the serpent's poison will gradually kill
the god of thunder. Surt will seek out the swordless Freyr, who
will quickly succumb to the giant. The one-handed Tyr will fight
the monstrous hound Garm and they will kill each other.

Loki and HEIMDALL, age-old enemies, will meet for a final time, and
neither will survive their encounter. The fight between Odin and Fenrir
will rage for a long time, but finally Fenrir will seize Odin and
swallow him. Odin's son Vidar will at once leap towards the wolf
and kill him with his bare hands, ripping the wolf's jaws apart.

Then Surt will fling fire in every direction. The nine worlds will burn,
and friends and foes alike will perish. The earth will sink into the
sea. After the destruction, a new and idyllic world will arise from the
sea and will be filled with abundant supplies. Some of the gods will
survive, others will be reborn. Wickedness and misery will no longer
exist and gods and men will live happily together. The descendants
of Lif and Lifthrasir will inhabit this earth.

&quot;RagnarÃ¶kr&quot; or &quot;RagnarÃ¸kr&quot; means &quot;doom of the powers&quot; or
&quot;destruction of the powers&quot; (where &quot;powers&quot; means &quot;gods&quot;).
---------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Norns are the demi-goddesses of destiny.
They control the destinies of both gods &amp; men,
as well as the unchanging laws of the cosmos.

They are represented as three sisters:

Urd (&quot;fate&quot;),
VERDANDI (&quot;necessity&quot;) and
Skuld (&quot;being&quot;).

They live at the base of the World Tree Yggdrasil in the realm of
Asgard. Nothing lasts forever, and even the mighty Yggdrasil is subject
to decay. The Norns try to stop this process, or at least slow it down,
by pouring mud and water from the Well of Fate over its branches.
This MAGICAL LIQUID stops the rotting process for the time being.

Rigsthula (from: Snorre Sturlasson's Elder Edda translated by
Robert Hollander)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is told by men in olden tales that one of the gods whose name was
Heimdal, fared forth along the seashore until he came to a farm.
There he called himself Rig. The following poem treats of this tale.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. In old times, say they, on earth-paths green
there wended his way a wise god ancient,
rugged and mighty-- Rig was he hight.
2. Walked unwearied (in middle ways),
to a dwelling he came, was the door bolted.
In gan he go, on the ground was a fire,
at the hearth, hoary, sat husband and wife--
Ai and Edda, in old headgear.

3. Well knew Rig wisely to counsel;
on middle seat he sat him down,
betwixt the twain of the toft benched him.

4. Then took Edda a thick loaf heavy
of bread hard-baked and full of bran;
a bowl then bore on the board, Edda,
filled with the broth of boiled calf-meat.

5. Well knew Rig wisely to counsel;
he rose up thence, ready for sleep;
in middle bedstead his berth he made,
betwixt the twain of the toft laid him.

6. And there stayed he three days together,
and walked unwearied in middle ways.
Nine moons full went meanwhile by.

7. Gave Edda birth to a boy child then,
(in clouts she swathed) the swarthy-skinned one.
THRALL they called him, and cast on him water,
(dark was his hair and dull his eyes).

8. On his hand the skin was scraggy and wrinkled,
(nasty his nails), his knuckles gnarled,
his fingernails thick, his face ugly,
his back hulky, his heels were long.

9. He gan to grow and gain in strength,
betimes took him to try his might;
to bind bast ropes, burdens to pack,
to bear faggots home the whole day long.

10. Came to his cot a crook-legged wench--
were her soles dirty, and sunburnt her arms,
her nose bent downward; her name was THIR.

11. On middle seat she sat her down,
by her side did sit the son of the house;
whispered and laughed and lay together
THRALL and THIR whole days through.

12. In their hut, happy, they had a brood;
I ween they were hight: Hay Giver, Howler,
Bastard, Sluggard, Bent-Back and Paunch,
Stumpy, Stinker, Stableboy, Swarthy,
Longshanks and Lout; they laid fences,
put dung on fields, fattened the swine,
herded the goats, and grubbed up peat.

13. Their daughters were DRUDGE and Daggle-Tail,
Slattern, Serving-Maid, and Cinder-Wench,
Stout-Leg, Shorty, Stumpy and Dumpy,
Spindleshanks and Sputterer;
thence are sprung the breed of THRALLs.

14. At his staff Rig strode, and straight forth fared;
to a dwelling he came, was the door ajar.
In gan he go, on the ground was a fire,
sat husband and wife there with their work busy.

15. A weaver's beam out of wood he shaped--
his beard was brushed, and banged, his hair--
in kirtle tight-fitting, were pland on the floor.

16. The good wife sat and swayed her distaff,
braided the yarn to use for weaving,
with a hood on her head and a smock on her breast,
on her neck, a kerchief, and ornaments on her shoulders,
Afi and Amma owned that house.

17. Well knew Rig, wisely to counsel,
(on middle seat he sat him down,
betwixt the twain of the toft benched him).

18. (Then took Amma. . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
(a full trencher on the table she put
with boiled calf-meat, the best she had.)

19. (Well Knew Rig, wisely to counsel),
he rose up thence, ready for sleep;
on middle bedstead his berth he made,
betwixt the twain of the toft laid him.

20. And there stayed he three days together
(then walked unwearied in middle ways),
Moons full nine went meanwhile by.

21. Gave Amma birth to a boy child then.
Karl they called him, clothed him in linen;
ruddy his hue, and rapid his eyes.

22. Then gan he grow and gain in strength,
tamed the oxen and tempered ploughshares,
timbered houses, and barns for the hay,
fashioned carts, and followed the plough.

23. A bride they brought him with bunch of keys dangling,
in goatskin kirtle, gave her to Karl.
Snor was she hight and sat under veil,
[a house they reared them and rings bestowed.]
their linen they spread, and the larder stocked.

24. In their homestead, happy, they had a brood,
hight Man and Yeoman, Master, Goodman,
Husbandman, Farmer, Franklin, Crofter,
Bound-Beard, Steep-Beard, Broad, Swain and Smith.

25. By other names were known their daughters;
Woman, Gentlewoman, Wife, Bride, Lady,
Haught, Maiden, Hussif and Dame;
thence are come the kin of the Karls.

26. At his staff Rig strode steadfastly on;
a hall he saw then, was southward the door,
raised on high, with a ring in the doorpost.

27. He stode in straightway, was straw on the floor.
Sat there the good folk, gazed at each other,
Father and Mother, with their fingers playing.

28. On the bench he sat, a bowstring twining,
bent the elmwood, and arrows shafted.
Sat the lady, looked at her arms,
stroked the line, straightened her sleeves.

29. With a brooch on her breast, and a bonnet on her head,
a long train of [silk], and sark all blue.
Was her brow brighter, her breast lighter,
her neck whiter, than whitest snow.

30. Well knew Rig wisely to counsel,
on middle seat he sat him down,
betwixt the twain of the toft he benched him.

31. Of bleached flax then a broidered cloth,
did Mother take, and the table covered;
a light-baked loaf she laid on the table,
of wheaten meal, white and thin.

32. A full trencher on the table she put,
silver-plated, and set forth then
flitches of bacon and steaked fowl also;
there was wine in a crock, were the cups gold-plated;
they drank and chatted til the day was ended.

33. Well could Rig wisely counsel;
he rose up thence, ready for sleep;
(on middle bedstead his berth he made,
betwixt the twain of the toft he laid him.)

34. And there stayed he three days together;
then walked unwearied in middle ways.
Full nine months went meanwhile by.

35. A son bore Mother, in silk they swather him,
sprinkled water on him and called him Jarl.
Was his hair flaxen, and fair-hued his cheek,
his eyes very quick like adder's, blazed.

36. Up grew Jarl within the Hall,
gan bucklers wield and the bowstring fasten,
gan the elmwood bend and arrows shaft;
gan hurl the spear and speed the lance,
gan hund with hounds, and horses ride,
gan brandish swords and swim in the sea.

37. Out of woodlands came Rig walking,
came Rig walking, and taught him runes;
his own name gave him as heir and son,
bade him make his own, the udal lands,
the udal lands and olden manors.

38. He dauntless rode through darking woods,
over frostey fells, to a faraway hall.
Shields he shattered and shafts he hurled,
brandished his sword and swiftly rode;
he wakened war and warriours slew,
with wound-red weapons he won his land.

39. He made himself master of manors eighteen,
gan share his wealth and shower it on all;
silver and gold and slender steeds;
squanderdd arm rings and scattered gold.

40. His heralds drove on dew-wet paths,
and came to the hall where Hersir dwelled;
a daughter had he, dainty-fingered,
fair-haired and wise, was she hight Erna.

41. For her hand he asked, and home drove her,
gave her to Jarl, gowned in linenk;
they lived together and loved each other,
had many children, and lived cheerfully.

42. Boy was the oldest, Bairn the second,
then Issue and Child, Heir, Youth, and Squire,
Offspring and Lad--they sports did learn--
Son and Scion-- swimming and &quot;tables,&quot;
Kund one was called, was Kon the youngest.

43. Up within hall grew Jarl's children;
spearshafts they shook, with shields they fended,
swift steeds bestrode, and straightened arrows.

44. But Kon only could carve runes,
runes lasting ay, life-keeping runes;
to bring forth babes, birth runes he knew,
to dull sword edges, and to calm the sea.

45. Fowls' speech he knew, and quenched fires,
could sooth (sorrows) and the sick mind heal;
in his arms the strength of eight men had.

46. In runes he rivaled Rig the Jarl;
with wiles he warred, outwitting him;
thus got for himself, and gained to have,
the name of Rig and runic lore.

47. Rode Kon the young through copse and woods,
birds he snared, used bow and arrow.

48. Then quoth a crow, croaking on branch;
&quot;Why snarest thou birds, scion of kings?
Rather shouldst thou ride swift horse,
(brandish swords) and slay foemen.

49. &quot;Have Dan and Danp a dwelling richer,
and lands larger, than are left to thee:
are they skilled in steering on stormy seas,
in trying swords and slaying heroes?&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The poem ends abruptly. From the tenor of the poem it is likely Kon
followed the advice of the Bird--as Sigurd does in FÃ¡fnismÃ¡l--and wins
the lands of Dan and Danp [Denmark?]. According to the synoptic account
of the lost Skjoldungasaga given by the Icelander Arngrim Jonsson
(1597), King Rig married Dana, the daughter of Danpr of Danpstad, and
their son Dan was the mythical king who united Denmark under his rule.
--R. Hollander
-----------------------------------------------------------
John Barbour. d. 1395

A! Fredome is a noble thing!
Fredome mays man to haiff liking;
Fredome all solace to man giffis,
He levys at ese that frely levys!
A noble hart may haiff nane ese,
Na ellys nocht that may him plese,
Gyff fredome fail; for fre liking
Is yarnyt our all OTHIR thing.
Na he that ay has levyt fre
May nocht knaw weill the propyrtÃ¨,
The angyr, na the wretchyt dome
That is couplyt to foule thyrldome.
Bot gyff he had assayit it,
Than all perquer he suld it wyt;
And suld think fredome mar to prise
Than all the gold in warld that is.
Thus contrar thingis evirmar
Discoweryngis off the tOTHIR ar.
