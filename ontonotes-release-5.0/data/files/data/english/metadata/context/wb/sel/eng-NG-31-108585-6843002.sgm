Imagine my surprise when a recent search of the regulatory T-cell
literature turned up a vein of research on histones shortly after I
started taking sodium butyrate.  The vein is about a year old.  I could
kick myself for missing it.

Butyrate is an HDAC inhibitor formed from the digestion of fiber by
friendly microflora in the gut.  In addition to supplying healthy fuel
for intestinal cells, butyrate also inhibits the removal of acetyl
groups from histones by blocking the enzyme which removes them - histone
deacetylase (HDAC).  This potently inhibits the formation of colon
cancer.  When histones are properly acetylated, the FoxP3 gene works.  A
working FoxP3 gene turns on regulatory T-cells which then block the
body's autoimmune reactions - theoretically preventing everything from
allergy to multiple sclerosis.  This means HDAC inhibitors promote
immunotolerance by increasing the number/function of regulatory T-cells
(Tregs).  Sodium butyrate, then, may have broad application against
everything from autoimmunity to the rejection of transplanted organs.  A
proper dose in prior studies was on the order of 4g daily [PMID
16225487] but might require carnitine with it.

Butyrate also promotes prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in certain
cells [PMID 9733608].  PGE2 is an essential activation signal for Tregs.
This prostaglandin also mediates stem cell repair/growth in hair
follicles, cartilage and bone.  Blocking COX-2 function not only leads
to autoimmunity but also joint erosion (two things never told to
arthritis patients taking Vioxx, Celebrex or other NSAIDs which block
COX-2).

Butyrate is more than a mere immunosuppressant.  Along with vitamin D3,
butyrate appears to prompt the production of antimicrobial innate
defenses [PMID 16895558].  A loss of butyrate might account for the
chronic intestinal infections seen in Crohn's patients.  Without
butyrate, innate intestinal defenses protecting the gut lining from
infection could collapse.

For those of you familiar with the helminth hypothesis of autoimmunity
(see
< http://www.discover.com/issues/sep-93/features/ofparasitesandpo264/ >,
< http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/695 > and < http://www.ovamed.de/ >),
butyrate may be synergistic with helminth therapy or may be one means by
which helminths calm the immune system and activate Tregs.  The
literature mentions at least one helminth infection which alters gut
microflora and increases butyrate production.  Whether intestinal
parasites do this generally or not I don't know.  If generally true,
this would directly connect helminths, butyrate and Tregs to each other.

I can't yet find a direct connection with butyrate, IgG4 and mast cell
inhibition.  Helminths crank up production of IgG4 which then blocks
mast cell-degranulation, thus preventing allergic symptoms.  It does
appear to be the case that butyrate generally inhibits mast cell
inflammatory responses, thus 86'ing allergy symptoms [PMID 16949031].
However, it also seems to enhance certain aspects of the remaining mast
cell response [PMID 8026597].  It may make mast cells less likely to go
off but more potent when they do.  The literature is thin on the matter
and I'm speculating with what little is available.

Clearly butyrate is an important regulator of the body's inflammatory
response and important to the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
Carnitine, in turn, is central to butyrate metabolism.  Carnitine is
needed for butyrate uptake in the gut.  When cells can't get enough
carnitine, they can't make use of butyrate.  In the type of inflammatory
bowel injury commonly seen in Crohn's and I.B.D., carnitine transporters
OCTN2 and Atb0+ can be disabled [PMID 17065219].  Knock out carnitine
transport in the gut with an inflammatory toxin (like mercury, in my
case) or perhaps through a genetic defect and you lose butyrate uptake,
HDAC inhibition, FoxP3 and then, ultimately, immunotolerance (along with
innate defenses and mast cell sanity).  Although this hypothesis has yet
to be tested in a human biopsy, the metabolic chain of events is clear.

Mercury poisoning, known to cause autoimmunity, knocks out this exact
same carnitine transporter (reported in the literature as OCT-2) in
other types of cells like nerves.  Mercury goes on to deplete betaine,
molybdenum and histidine over time by overtaxing production of the
natural chelator, metallothionein.  (This leads into the mu
opioid/protein kinase C/cannabinoid networks and a host of other things
I've discussed before.)  There is an OCT-2 receptor on B-cells, although
I'm unaware of its exact function.  I suspect it might play an
antiproliferative role similar to one of the cannabinoid receptors.  (If
true, then carnitine might have an anticancer effect against certain
leukemias.  Is anyone aware of a connection?)

OCTN1 is another carnitine transporter.  Besides carnitine, it ferries
the potent antioxidant ergothioneine, which is also the precursor for
metallothionein [PMID 15795384].  It's not quite clear why yet but OCTN1
is abnormally expressed in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients
[PMID 17142562] and certain mutations in OCTN1 and OCTN2 increase
genetic susceptibility to Crohn's disease [PMID 16961737] and other
autoimmune conditions.  I have suspected before that carnitine played
some direct role in preventing autoimmunity since men have naturally
higher carnitine levels than women and are less susceptible to
autoimmunity.  The recent research on butyrate and FoxP3 clarifies why
this should be the case.  Carnitine is the key that lets butyrate into
cells for beta oxidation.  These mutations in carnitine transporters
could result in less butyrate uptake, less HDAC inhibition and lower
FoxP3 expression.

Notice the close chemical relationships among

+    betaine (trimethylglycine)
+    carnitine (gamma-trimethyl-beta-hydroxybutyrobetaine aka
4-N-trimethylammonium-3-hydroxybutyric acid)
+    ergothioneine (2-thiol-L-histidine-betaine)
+    metallothionein (ergothioneine plus a molybdenum-containing
prosthetic group)
+    methionine (2-amino-4-(methylthio)butyric acid)

Methionine is used to synthesize SAMe (s-adenosylmethionine) and
homocysteine.  It's a principle figure in the methyl cycle, something
mercury is known to disturb.  On the positive side, methionine
restriction tends to slow the aging process in lower organisms.
Methylation and histone acetylation are two of the main epigenetic
regulators.  By putting methyl groups on sections of DNA or adding
acetyl groups to histones in the DNA, the body changes how active or
inactive genes become.  Methylating an oncogene, for instance, muffles
it and inhibits the development of cancer.  Demethylating it frees it to
promote cancer.  While it's a lot more complicated than I can explain in
a paragraph, you can see how mercury or any defect in the
carnitine/butyrate dance would throw havoc into the entire epigenetic
cycle.

As an aside, the non-intuitive ability of HDAC inhibitors to promote
Tregs might limit their usefulness as solitary anticancer agents.
Cancer cells often employ Treg umbrellas to evade immune system attack
by secreting PGE2 [PMID 15958566].  While HDAC inhibitors do have
anticancer effects of their own, blocking Treg function through another
pathway with something like, say, a COX-2 inhibitor might enhance the
chemotherapeutic properties of sodium butyrate and trichostatin A.

Notes:

FOXP3 interactions with histone acetyltransferase and class II histone
deacetylases are required for repression; FOXP3 acts as a repressor of
transcription and is both an essential and sufficient regulator of the
development and function of regulatory T cells; transcriptional
repression by FOXP3 involves a histone acetyltransferase-deacetylase
complex that includes histone acetyltransferase TIP60 (Tat-interactive
protein, 60 kDa) and class II histone deacetylases HDAC7 and HDAC9; the
N-terminal 106-190 aa of FOXP3 are required for TIP60-FOXP3, HDAC7-FOXP3
association, as well as for the transcriptional repression of FOXP3 via
its forkhead domain; FOXP3 can be acetylated in primary human regulatory
T cells and TIP60 promotes FOXP3 acetylation in vivo; overexpression of
TIP60 but not its histone acetyltransferase-deficient mutant promotes,
whereas knockdown of endogenous TIP60 relieved, FOXP3-mediated
transcriptional repression; a minimum FOXP3 ensemble containing native
TIP60 and HDAC7 is necessary for IL-2 production regulation in T cells;
FOXP3 association with HDAC9 is antagonized by T cell stimulation and
can be restored by the protein deacetylation inhibitor trichostatin A
[PMID 17360565]; transcriptional control of Foxp3 expression itself
contributes to development of a stable Treg lineage; an evolutionarily
conserved region within the foxp3 locus upstream of exon-1 possesses
transcriptional activity; complete demethylation of CpG motifs as well
as histone modifications within the conserved region in ex vivo isolated
Foxp3+CD25+CD4+ Tregs takes place, but not in naive CD25-CD4+ T cells;
partial DNA demethylation is already found in developing Foxp3+
thymocytes; however, Tregs induced by TGF-beta in vitro display only
incomplete demethylation despite high Foxp3 expression; in contrast to
natural Tregs, TGF-beta-induced Foxp3+ Tregs lose both Foxp3 expression
and suppressive activity upon restimulation in the absence of TGF-beta;
this suggests expression of Foxp3 must be stabilized by epigenetic
modification to allow the development of a permanent suppressor cell
lineage [PMID 17298177]; ectopic expression of Foxp3 in non-Tregs leads
to repression of the IL-2 and IFN-gamma genes, gain of suppressor
function and induction of genes like CD25, GITR, and CTLA-4; Foxp3 binds
to the endogenous IL-2 and IFNgamma loci in T cells but only after T
cell receptor (TCR) stimulation; the

Wouldn't a combination of fiber supplement & high grade probiotic
produce butyrate in the gut naturally? I take VSL#3 mixed with milk
along with psyllium husk powder every morning.

Possibly, as long as you're ingesting sufficient quantities.  Nobody's
done work establishing the therapeutic dose of fiber.  If you've got
carnitine transporter mutations or an injury which knocks out carnitine
transport, you would need to take sufficient amounts of carnitine with
any fiber or butyrate to see the benefit.  In the past, they've
experimented with butyrate on inflammatory bowel conditions and had
mixed success.  A recent paper about four or five months back
established carnitine was a missing factor.
