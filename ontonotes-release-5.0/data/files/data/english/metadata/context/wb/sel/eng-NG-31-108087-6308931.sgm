Are you saying that charging the battery makes it start
right up after sitting for a few days ?

Normally, I'd attribute hard starting to a carburetion
problem rather than to battery charge. How cold is it
when you try to start it ? Is this a new problem or don't
you know ?

You might as well give it some new plugs if you haven't
allready done so.

One thing you also should check is your cables. I just found
my starting and running problems were being caused by
a fraying cable that was preventing one carb from closing
right. Because of this, the choke wasn't working right, it
was too lean for cold starting and tended to race when it
was warmed up.

If you really think the battery influences the starting, then
you should look at the ignition system. Could also be some
water from condensation in the fuel system I guess.

Pull out the plugs and ground the plug bodies. Observe the spark
while cranking. Make sure you have grounded the plugs and are
not in contact with them or you will get really nasty shocks and/or
possibly damage ignition components.

You might just replace the plugs while you're at it. Worst case,
you've got a set of spares.

The problem has been around since the 1980's, when the Environmental
Protection Agency
mandated lean idle mixtures as a solution to the air pollution problem.

Motorcycles began to arrive on our shores fitted with mysterious
devices called "constant vacuum" or "constant velocity" carburetors.

The vacuum piston is lifted by a rubber diaphragm when there is enough
air flow through the engine to justify lifting the mid-range jet needle
out of its hole, and not before. This eliminated the
problem of riders with frisky wrists bogging their engines with a whole
dollop of fuel that was far more than the engine could digest.

And, the carburetor manufacturers began hiding the pilot screws under
anti-tamper plugs. If you look at the carburetor parts diagram for the
America model, you'll see that #12 is a plug, pilot screw. #10 is the
pilot screw itself, it has a needle shaped end to very accurately meter
out a miserly amount of fuel to the idle circuit.

Pilot screws like that can get plugged up with the tiniest amount of
dirt and gum, and the rider doesn't know what's happening, besides the
fact that his engine stalls instead of idling smoothly.

He turns the #17 stop screw clockwise a turn or two and the engine will
idle again.

Or, maybe the owner isn't the culprit, maybe it's an ignorant mechanic
at the $tealer$hip who doesn't understand that turning the stop screw
opens the throttle butterflies a little too much and this affects the
operation of the "choke".

Your Keihin carbs don't have a real choke, they have a starting
enrichener. When you pull that knob on the side of the carburetor,
you're actually opening a little valve that allows the engine to suck
fuel straight out of the float bowl, bypassing the throttle
butterflies.

If the throttle butterflies aren't fully closed, the starting
enrichener doesn't work right. You can help the engine start easier by
turning the stop screw counterclockwise a few turns, and nursing the
throttle to keep the engine running until the motorcycle warms up.

But don't turn the throttle butterfly when you are pushing the starter
button until the engine acts like it's going to start. Opening the
throttle butterfly defeats the starting enrichener valve by reducing
vacuum downstream of the butterfly.

Another possibility is that there isn't enough "play" in the throttle
cables, and that keeps the throttle butterflies from closing. Be sure
you have about 1.0 to 1.5 millimeters free play in the cables.

You should use a clear carburetor cleaner to keep the tiny jets and
ports in your carburetors clean.

I use Berryman B-12 Chemtool Choke and Carburetor Cleaner. I like B-12
because it comes in liquid form, in a pint can for about $3.00

STP or GumOut works too. But they are in aerosol cans.

About 4 or 5 ounces of carburetor cleaner that contains benzene,
acetone, toluene, methyl alchol, etc. in a full tank of gasoline three
or four times a year keeps everything cleaned out.

Fuel system cleaners that say they contain "petroleum distillates" are
for fuel injectors. They do as much to lubricate a fuel injector as
they do to actually clean it.

Might be that your starter is pulling so much current that there's
not enough left to fire the plugs. If you've got a multimeter, you
could check the voltage while it's cranking.

You might also try cranking first with the throttle wide open,
then shutting it down as soon as the starter's begun to
turn the engine. This seems to reduce the vacuum that
the starter's having to pump. When it's cranked for a
turn or so, the flywheel's helping you and you can close the
throttle.

You can buy a multimeter for under $25 and it's a useful
tool to have.

If you've really got a dealer who wants to take you to the cleaners,

You've got some kind of fuel shutoff valve on the tank don't you ?
Shut it off.

Anyway, try to find a Haynes or Clymers or some other aftermarket

You can't shut off vacuum taps. No idea if that's what the BA has, but
I'd expect so. They just shut off themselves. So no worries either way.
This is juist so he doesn't turn it to "PRIME" or something.

Oh, wonderful. Some mechanic in a $tealer$hip or $peed $hop who really
doesn't know jack shit about carburetors puts a jet kit into your
motorcycle and pockets your money and you're left with a can of worms.

He put the largest jets in the kit in your machine and you probably
ride on the street or highways 99% of the time. You probably never ride
at full throttle for more than 10 seconds at a time.

Maybe you never go out for a track day either, but you have the
humongous racing jets in there. Aftermarket jet kits are a drug on the
market. Everybody who has extra money to throw into useless
"performance modifications" buys a jet kit even though they aren't
quite sure what it does for them.

Their buddies tell them, "Oh, yeah, man. I threw a jet kit in there and
now my bike kicks ass." Their buddies never admit that they have a lot
of problems starting their motorcycle now.

Well, the humongous racing jets don't have anything to do with
starting.

But what did the racketeer do to your idle jets and pilot mixture
screws?

Look underneath your carbs and you'll see a cylindrical casting in
front of the float bowl. You'll need a mirror to look up under the
carbs.

There should be a blind plug in that casting, concealing the pilot
screws.

If you see a slot headed brass screw in the hole, the mechanic has
tampered with your pilot screws. Most mechanics haven't got a clue
about the correct setting for pilot screws, they always turn them too
far out, expecting the idle speed to increase.

When the idle speed slows down instead because they've opened the pilot
screws too far, the next mistake the amateur mechanic does is to turn
the idle speed knob
up.

This opens the throttle butterflies too much, and the starting
enrichener ("choke") won't work right because the vacuum downstream of
the butterfly is too low when the butterflies are open too far.

And, to complicate matters, the rich idle mixture does tend to foul
your spark plugs.

Fluffy black carbon on the spark plugs allows the high voltage to leak
away to ground as fast as the voltage builds on the plug.

Once you have cleaned your spark plugs (or installed new ones), you can
work on your pilot jet settings. The drill is to turn them all the way
closed, counting the full turns and the fractions of turns.

Then turn them back out, except for the last quarter of half a turn.
Try to start the engine.

Your engine should start from cold without turning the throttle. The
starting enrichener ("choke") should supply enough fuel and air to
start the engine without touching the throttle.

Using the thottle just defeats the starting enrichener's operation.

You should be able to get back to the original factory setting on the
pilot screws if the mechanic who installed the jet kit didn't also
install larger idle jets.

With standard idle jets, the pilot screws will probably be turned out
somewhere between 1.5 and 2.5 full turns from fully closed.

With really large idle jets, the pilot screws may be turned out as
little as 1/4 of a turn.

You can tell the pilot screws are open too far if the engine won't idle
down when it's hot and you "blip" the throttle....
