Here is a question that needs to be asked a couple of times a year because
the old answers become obsolete so quickly...

What is the current best kanji OCR to run about 100 pages of an adobe
acrobat graphics file through, while running on an English XP system, with
additional requirement that I have to be able to purchase it online
(downloadable) in the next 24 hours or so?

Thank you...

Warren

If you only need Japanese and English OCR,
http://e-shop.crosslanguage.co.jp/item_detail.html?item_cd=09329-A-CL...
should be OK.
If you also need OCR for German, French, etc,
http://e-shop.crosslanguage.co.jp/item_detail.html?item_cd=09330-A-CL...
is recommended.

I can't say anything about running on an English XP system, but
assume that if your system is set up to handle kanji, this
should be OK.

I am using the multilingual version, and I am very happy with it.

Have fun (and OCR),

Roland
