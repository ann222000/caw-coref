What Future for Haiti?

An Interview with Patrick Elie

by Reed Lindsay for NACLA

In February 2004, U.S. Marines whisked away then-President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide from Haiti amid an armed rebellion led by disgruntled former
soldiers and paramilitary actors. Despite the presence of a United Nations
peacekeeping force, violence and poverty increased under the U.S.-backed
interim government led by Interim Prime Minister Gérard Latortue, which
courted the elite and its international backers while alienating Haiti's
overwhelming poor majority. The crisis hit a low point last December and
January, with daily shootings in the poor neighborhood of Cité Soleil and
an outbreak of kidnappings.

President René Préval's electoral victory on February 7 suddenly brought
peace and hope to Haiti for the first time in two years. Haiti's poor
flooded the polls to vote, and one week later they blockaded nearly every
major road in the country to demand that the electoral council name Préval
the victor in the first round. Préval has formed a coalition government and
has courted all sides of the political spectrum, including both
pro-Aristide militants from Cité Soleil as well as light-skinned elites. He
has taken a similar approach in his foreign policy, seeking help from the
United States and France but also Cuba and Venezuela. It is uncertain how
long he will be able to juggle these different interests, and more than six
months into his presidency, Préval continues to remain largely an enigma.

Patrick Elie has been an activist in Haiti since 1986, when the nation's
popular movements drove former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier from the
country. In the late 1980s, he participated in these movements alongside
René Préval, Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Antoine Izmery, among other
pro-democracy activists struggling against the military governments that
assumed power after Duvalier's ouster. Elie was head of Aristide's security
detail during his first presidential campaign in 1990. When the former
priest became the country's first democratically elected leader, Elie
assumed the position of anti-narcotics chief. He went into exile after the
military coup and returned to become secretary of state for defense when
Aristide was restored to power in 1994. Since 1995, he has not served in
government but has remained politically active, and is a founding member of
SOS (Citizens' Watchdog Center), a group that seeks to promote the creation
of a national network of grassroots organizations.

Interview with Patrick Elie and introduction by Reed Lindsay.

Reed Lindsay: How accurate is the characterization of Haiti as a country
with a history or a culture of violence?

Patrick Elie: It is an image of Haiti that is grossly distorted. The
so-called level of violence in Haiti pales in comparison with violence in
at least half the countries in the world. Compare the history of Haiti with
that of England, France and the U.S. and Germany. Don't go back to the
1200s. Look back to 1804 and you have more violence in those countries than
in Haiti. So the characterization of Haiti as a violent country is a bunch
of hogwash. Why is there tension and instability in Haiti? It is simply
because in Haiti you have 5 percent of the population controlling 60
percent of the national wealth, while 80 percent live in poverty. If you
had such a situation in any other country you'd have a massacre or a civil
war but that hasn't happened in Haiti, which speaks to the self-restraint
of the Haitian population. The instability of the last 20 to 25 years has
been caused essentially by this elite as well as their foreign allies who
cannot truly accept the principal of one citizen-one vote because it would
mean that they would lose their privileges and influence. They have tried
to quench the will of the poor majority of Haiti and tried to change the
rules of the game because they've lost in elections. If it were up to the
Haitian people (and when I say Haitian people I'm talking about the vast
majority of Haitians who are poor) there would be both democracy and
stability. If you look at recent history, the Haitian people have chosen to
vote rather than to riot. They voted four times in a row for the same
political family, the same political leaning, the same agenda. They
consistently have picked both democracy and stability.

RL: How does the United States government's role in Haiti compare to its
role in other countries in Latin America?

PE: The role of the U.S. in Haiti is no different than what it is in other
countries in Latin America in that the U.S. is interested in dominating
Haiti and dictating its policy. That's the reason why they cannot stand the
idea of somebody being elected with a large majority because that means the
government will not be easy to manipulate as one that has very little
popular legitimacy and from the get-go this was the United States' problem
with Aristide and Lavalas. The role of the U.S. in all of Haitian history
has been egregious. The U.S. occupied the country for 20 years from 1915 to
1934 and left us with a repressive army. But this pattern was not
particular to Haiti. Go to the DR, and they did the same thing with
Trujillo, and the same thing in Nicaragua with Somoza. When the U.S. said
it would support democracies rather than military dictatorships, the
Haitians did not play along because they did not want the type of democracy
that the U.S. wanted to impose. The Haitians, that is, the 80 percent of
Haitians who have been excluded for two centuries, wanted a true democracy,
where they would define the agenda and get to pick who they wanted rather
than be forced to choose between candidates they don't like. Why has the
U.S. occupied the country three times? There are many reasons. There are
economic reasons, but even if you don't concede to that, Haiti has been a
powerful symbol for having overthrown slavery and becoming independent and
for what it's doing now, which is proving that the poorest people in the
hemisphere, mostly illiterate, can know more about democracy than the
people who are pretending to be beacons of civilization. And they can stand
up to the will of the U.S. The movement that you see now in Latin America,
the new large social movements that are sweeping away the traditional
political parties, that also started in a way in Haiti. For the U.S., Haiti
is an example that must be crushed, that must be made to fail. That's the
principal interest of the U.S. in Haiti.

RL: But the U.S. hasn't been the only first world country to play a major
role in Haiti in recent years. What about France and Canada?

PE: France's role in Haiti is a direct result of the demand for reparation
that President Aristide put forward. Also, I think France could never get
over the defeat of 1804. In all of Haitian history, never has a French
president set foot in Haiti. And Santo Domingue is probably the French
colony that played the greatest role in French history. It was the richest
colony by far, and caused them to lose Louisiana.
With Canada, I can point to a number of reasons why they have switched
directions in Haitian policy. One is that Canada is aligning its policy
with that of the U.S. more and more after Iraq where they refused to
participate because the Chretien government would have been defeated if
Canada had gone into Iraq. Haiti was an easy way to please the U.S. Haiti's
a country with no army and no possibility to resist regime change.

RL: How would you characterize the role of Brazil, Argentina and Chile in
the UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti?

PE: The Latin American countries had their own reasons and interests.
Brazil wants to be recognized as an emerging power and wanted a seat in the
UN Security Council. For countries like Argentina and Chile, they wanted to
show that they are countries that count. Despite the fact that I'm against
the occupation, if I had to choose to be occupied by U.S. Marines, the
French Legionnaires or the Latin American countries and the UN, I'd pick
the latter, but the positive thing that could emerge from this crisis is
that Latin America will discover Haiti and remember that Haiti is at the
origin of their own independence. Also, I believe that Haiti will have the
possibility of reorienting its diplomacy toward the Caribbean and Latin
America rather than be prisoner of its destructive relationship with the
United States.

RL: What about the allegations that UN troops tolerated and sometimes
committed abuses in the poor neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince?

PE: I think there were some people within the UN that were truly
sympathetic to the Haitian people. We cannot forget the excesses of the UN,
especially in the popular neighborhoods like Cite Soleil. But we also must
recognize that the UN troops did not go all out in military operations in
poor neighborhoods as they were being encouraged to do by the Haitian elite
and the governments of the U.S., France and Canada. As President Préval has
said, I would like to see the UN mission continue. But we don't need all
those men with guns. We'd rather see doctors and technicians helping us.

RL: Can you evaluate the last two years of rule by the interim government
of Primer Minister Gérard Latortue?

PE: I prefer to call it a de facto regime or puppet regime because that's
truly what it was. It was forced upon the Haitian people by the
intervention of February 29, 2004, and it was formed with hostility. It was
a government that was to be hostile to Lavalas and to help eliminate the
movement from the political scene. It was a government that was a model of
the kind of government that the three countries that intervened in Haiti
would like to see at the helm of the country: a government that answers not
to the population of the country but to foreign interests and international
organizations like the IMF. As for an assessment of the last two years, I'm
56 years old, and these have easily been the most difficult and terrible
years for the country I've ever seen.

First of all, there's the level of repression against the poor people,
against Lavalas. This government has allowed ex killers and killers from
the army to integrate into the police into units that were nothing else but
death squads and go into popular neighborhoods and assassinate people. And
the economy has been a disaster. The thing the government did was fire
4,000 to 5000 people in a country with 70 percent unemployment. Of course
this is not the type of government the Haitian people would like to see at
the helm of the country.

RL: How does Haiti's popular movement compare to those in other countries
in Latin America?

PE: When Jean-Claude Duvalier was forced to leave the country in 1986,
nobody expected that after 30 years of repression, the first 15 of which
were sheer terror, that there would be this profound movement within the
Haitian population that would turn into thousands of grassroots
organizations. It was this movement that was the origin of the Haitian saga
of the last 20 years. It was this movement rather than the political
parties that stood up against the return of dictatorship. It was this
movement that confronted the military government when it tried to control
the election in 1987 and this movement that swept Aristide into power in
1990. And it was not the political parties, but again this movement that
elected René Préval. Don't believe for one minute that Lespwa [the
coalition of political parties and organizations on whose ticket Préval ran
for president] has been anything but a label that has been used for the
election and a nice slogan, but it was that vast social movement that swept
Préval into power. And I think that this movement that literally exploded
onto the scene in 1986 preceded what we've seen in Venezuela, in Bolivia,
and what may be appearing in Mexico and maybe it is the wave of the future
for countries like Haiti in Latin America. Instead of trying to mimic
countries of Europe, maybe we can forge regional tools for regional
democracies. And I think that is what Haitians are trying to do.

RL: Has this popular movement grown stronger or weaker in the last 20
years?

PE: The popular movement in Haiti is very much alive, but it is already a
bit better organized because it is battle scarred but battle hardened also.
I've seen the crowds in 1986 and 1987, and the ones I've seen out lately
are different. It's already starting to resemble an army. There is more
organization, there is more discipline, and I think there is more ability
to stay the course. Of course, much remains to be done, for example, there
is no substitute for a national coordination for such a movement. It should
exist. For the moment, it is a very loose coordination. That's where the
new political leadership will emerge from. If anything, the last election
signals the end of Haiti's traditional political class. When I say
traditional, I mean both those who come from the traditional right and the
traditional left. You've seen the electoral results of the so-called
socialists such as Paul Denis and Serge Gilles. They have been rejected by
the Haitian people.

RL: What is the future of Aristide and his Fanmi Lavalas party in Haiti?

PE: Aristide has played a key historical role in the struggle of the
Haitian people to define their own democracy, and I'm sure he will continue
to be an influence in the future. Fanmi Lavalas is a political
organization. But I don't think it will be able to survive as a political
organization simply because it really has no real autonomy. You could see
how it became totally in disarray after president Aristide was kidnapped.
It was what I would describe as a charismatic organization, one that
depends strictly on its leader and after that you have nothing in terms of
structure and in terms of capacity to formulate a political strategy.
A new grassroots movement will have to form that comes from the street and
grassroots mobilizations. Lavalas is this movement, but Lavalas and Fanmi
Lavalas, although related, are different things. Fanmi Lavalas is a
political organization. Lavalas is a political philosophy, not a party.
Lavalas and the popular movement are one in the same. It was the name
coined for it by President Aristide. But he did not invent the reality of
it, he just put a name on it. He doesn't own it. It owns him.

RL: What lessons can be drawn from the overthrow of Aristide in February
2004 and the ensuing two years?

PE: The lesson to be drawn is that it's not enough to vote for somebody who
is sympathetic to your cause. If you do not stay mobilized and define your
political agenda and support that political agenda, what will happen is
that either the president or the senators you elected are going to be
extremely vulnerable to pressure exerted on them from the powers that be or
they'll start drifting to a more traditional type of power and start having
their own agenda. And of course both things can happen. It's obvious when
you look at the last years of President Aristide, all the senators and
deputies had their own personal agenda and were completely removed from
what the people themselves wanted. So politicians, no matter what label
they are under, have to be kept on a leash. And the leash is the grassroots
movements permanently mobilized. That is one thing that the popular
movement has learned.

RL: Would you include René Préval among the new group of leaders in Latin
America who are pushing for regional integration and challenging U.S.
hegemony in the region?

PE: Préval is a branch from the same tree. Préval started out like all of
us, a Marxist, but he's been really forged or transformed by the popular
movement itself. He was very close to it. We went to school in the popular
movement at the same time. He has a good feel for what the people of Haiti
want and need. As a leader he does not have the charisma of Aristide, nor
is he inclined or able to communicate with them the same way that President
Aristide could. But I think that he has the trust of the Haitian people,
which is very important. But if the Haitian people do not keep up their
mobilization and continue to build it as a structured movement, he will
fail. That is a certainty. He will fail because it is the fate of any
leadership that is left by itself and does not have behind it a strong an
organized people. He might be pushed so far away from the original agenda
and what the people want that it would be the equivalent of him being
overthrown.

RL: What will Préval be able to accomplish?

PE: From what Préval has indicated, he will address the problems of the
poor majority of Haiti, including the most urgent issues such as
terminating that exclusion, that quasi-apartheid that predominates in this
country. His biggest obstacle might come from those within the Haitian
elite and the traditional politicians, who will try to embrace him after
failing to block his way. A president only has so much power, and he's not
the one actually doing everything. He depends on a team, and he depends on
popular support.

The members of the elite and political parties could have too much
influence. What they couldn't win in the election, they could win by
buddying up to Préval. I've heard that everywhere he's gone, he's gone with
members of the moneyed elite. That's all fine and dandy, he cannot actually
govern against the elite all out, but he cannot govern for the elite
either. I hope they won't try to destabilize in the same way they tried to
destabilize Aristide. The last two years have been such a fiasco, I don't
know if they have the stomach for something as terrible and disastrous. But
Préval will certainly be facing a lot of pressure. And I think somehow the
Haitian people know that. All I expect from his presidency is to have the
space to organize rather than facing a truly hostile government. But he
will be under a lot of constraints.

RL: How can Préval push through reforms that benefit the poor majority
without the elite sabotaging his effort?

PE: We start maybe by having the kind of dialogue with the moneyed elite
that the people of the South African majority had with the white minority
when the one person-one vote principal was being adopted. Obviously the
elite want some protection, but they will only have it by exchanging their
privileges for rights. It is obvious that things cannot continue as they
are, so if there are people who are reasonable within this elite, some
compromise might be reached between them and the vast majority of people
who have been excluded. The priorities should be set right. Education,
health care, production. These should be the priorities. We must have a
country that produces. The elite must be engaged in production of wealth
rather than being truly parasites. Laws must be voted by the new parliament
and be acted upon to close progressively that horrible gap that exists
between the tiny elite and the huge majority. That's the only way to go.
And if the elite persist in trying to stand in the way of progress I think
they will have to go the way of the Cuban elites that had a field day until
Fidel came along. Maybe they are more ready to be persuaded after the last
two years. It was the last desperate attempt to stem the flow of history.
The last two years have not been particularly happy for the Haitian elites
either. The Haitian people as a whole have suffered the consequences of
Aristide's overthrow.
