1 GB2RS NEWS Sunday 14 October

The news headlines

* JOTA golden jubilee

* Sputnik celebrates 50th birthday

* GB2RS drops MT63 JOTA will be celebrating its golden jubilee over the
weekend of 20 and 21 October. The theme for scouts this year is 'around
the world in 50 hours'. Many special event stations are planned in the
UK and worldwide. Around 130 UK special event callsigns have been
issued.

As announced in the September RadCom, the RSGB is actively supporting
JOTA with promotional materials. Packs containing leaflets, posters and
associated resources, are available free of charge from RSGB HQ. To
order a pack, please send a large stamped self-addressed envelope to
the amateur radio department as soon as possible. Packs will be
dispatched by return but delivery times cannot be guaranteed due to the
current postal disruption.

As you may have read in the October issue of RadCom, Sputnik 1
celebrated its 50th anniversary on October 4. AMSAT heralded the event
on the morning of 4 October by using AO-51 to retransmit the original
Sputnik-1 telemetry. Once again listeners could hear the haunting
beep-beep-beep from space.

For the last five years the GB2RS news has been transmitted using the
MT63 data mode. It was transmitted on Sunday evenings at 2015 local
time on 3600kHz and again at 2045 on 1840kHz. This proved popular
initially, but a survey carried out recently has found that few people
are now making use of it. This is probably because PC users are
downloading the news from the RSGB web site at their convenience. It
has therefore been decided that the MT63 data news bulletins will
terminate after the transmissions on Sunday 28 October. Some
experimental data bulletins will continue to be made on 5279kHz as part
of the ongoing 5MHz Experiment. Any enquiries should be directed to the
GB2RS News Manager Gordon, G3LEQ, on 01 565 652652.

In World War 2 the Colossus computer was created to help break Enigma
coded messages. The originals were destroyed after the War, but a
working example has recently been rebuilt. The work took 10 years, #1.2
million, and immense efforts from volunteers. To mark the completion of
the rebuild, a special celebration will be held on 15 and 16 November
at Bletchley Park. A series of messages will be enciphered on a WWII
Lorenz cipher machine. It is planned that the codes will be transmitted
using six tone RTTY from the Heinz Nixdorf Computer Museum in Germany,
in the same format transmitted in WWII. The signals will be received by
a replica 'Y' station and fed to Colossus for decoding. The RSGB hope
to bring you a report on the Colossus Mk 2 in a future issue of RadCom.

The November issue of RadCom will be posted during the week commencing
15 October. Due to the current disruptions within the postal service,
deliveries may be delayed. Members are asked to be patient and allow
extra time before contacting the RSGB to query non-delivery.

2 Members of the Wythall Amateur Radio Club and Contest Group will be
taking part in the CQ World Wide DX SSB Contest. They will be on the
air from the Pembrokeshire coast on October 27 and 28. The group will
be using the club's callsign MW5W and enter the contest as a
Multi-Multi entry with three stations. Some of the operators will be on
the air before the contest, signing their own callsign. For more
information log onto www.wythallradioclub.co.uk/ .

October to 1459 on 21 October, on 3.5 to 28MHz bands, on CW and SSB.
The exchange takes the form of RST and serial number. Now the solar
factual data for the period from 1 October to 7 October, compiled by
Neil Clarke, G0CAS For another week solar activity was once again very
low. Like last week another small sunspot group appeared but nothing
came of it. Solar flux levels varied little day to day and averaged 68
units. The 90 day solar flux on the 7th was 69 units, that's the same
level as last week. X-ray flux levels remained yet again remained below
the minimum level. Geomagnetic activity started at quiet levels but on
the 3rd a coronal hole disturbance arrived and lasted through to the
4th. The 3rd was the most disturbed day with an Ap index of 18units.
The rest of the period the geomagnetic field was quiet and the average
was Ap 8 units. The ACE spacecraft saw solar wind speeds increase from
400 kilometres per second on the 2nd to 600 by the 4th. Particle
densities were low throughout. Bz varied between minus 3 and plus 2
nanoTeslas on the quiet days and between minus 7 and plus 8 nanoTeslas
during the disturbance. The increase in geomagnetic levels was enough
to take the edge off HF propagation but not sufficiently for aurora at
VHF. However, although there were very few signals on 28MHz, there were
occasional openings to Africa on 21 and 24MHz and to the Pacific and
the Far East on 14MHz. Australia and New Zealand were

4 again workable on the lower bands by well-equipped stations around
about 0600 to 0700UTC. And finally the solar forecast. This week solar
activity is expected to continue at very low levels with no sign of an
end to the present period of inactivity. When activity does increase it
will happen without any warning and is almost impossible to forecast.
Solar flux levels should be in the high 60's all week. Geomagnetic
activity is expected to be quiet until around Wednesday when a coronal
hole disturbance should arrive. Even though the disturbance is not
expected to be strong, it should last until the weekend. MUFs during
daylight hours at equal latitudes should be around 19MHz for the south
and 16MHz for the north. The darkness hour lows should be about 8MHz.
Levels could be slightly lower during the second half of the week.
Paths this week to Japan should have a maximum usable frequency with a
50 per cent success rate of about 18MHz. The optimum working frequency
with a 90 per cent success rate will be around 14MHz. The best time to
try this path will be between 0800 and 1100 hours UTC. And that's all
for this week from the propagation team.
