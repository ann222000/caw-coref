I just finished 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare by
James Shapiro which is excellent. The book begins with the tearing
down of The Theatre, putting everything in storage to be used in
building The Globe, continues with the Lord Chamberlain's Men getting
rid of Will Kemp, and then Shaprio focuses on Shakespeare's writing
Hnery V, Julius Ceaser, As You Like It, and Hamlet. Shaprio also
focuses on Essex's ill-fated campaign in Ireland and how this is echoed
in the four plays. Shapiro makes a strong case that 1599 was a pivotal
year in Shakespeare's playwriting career and how a new theatre, a
different clown (Robert Armin), talented boy actors, and current events
resulted in Shakepeare reaching new heights in his plays. It is clear
that Shakespeare made new demands of his audiences at court and at the
Globe and of his fellow actors. In the chapters on Hamlet, Sharpio
makes a strong case for Shakespeare as a working playwright making
changes in the script to improve it. He explains why all four hours of
Hamlet was probably never performed during Shakespeare's lifetime.
Shaprio quotes from letters, private diaries and books of the period to
bring this year to life. The scholarship is strong and sound, the
writing style is a pleasure to read. The book is well worth the time.

........................................................
_The two angry women of ABINGTON_
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;HENRY PORTER's 1st work for Henslowe is dated May, 1598; in about
eleven months, he took part in five plays, producing three alone, and

co-operating in the other with Chettle &amp; Jonson. Of these, there is
extant only PORTER's 1599 play _The two angry women of ABINGTON._&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;It would, indeed, be hard to believe that PORTER wrote
_The two angry women of ABINGTON_ as his first piece
of dramatic work. It is a comedy of such full-blooded gusto and
such strength &amp; decision of style that it lifts its author out of
the ranks of lesser dramatists. &quot;ABINGTON&quot; is the village of ABINGDON
near OXFORD, and the play is a strong &amp; sturdy picture of rural life;
it smacks of the soil, and has in it something of the vigour and
virility which stamp Jonson's best work. The two angry mothers of the
play are not altogether pleasing characters, but they are alive and
life-like; and the husbands are delineated firmly and naturally,
without any fumbling or exaggeration. The daughter MALL, no doubt,
is an &quot;animal&quot;; she is without the romantic charm of Juliet,
but is an honest English lass for all that,..&gt;&gt;

The differences appear to me to be stylistic choices. Caesar is full of
(pretty dense, it seems to me) formal speeches, almost in imitation of Roman
rhetoric. Hamlet is freer flowing. But this could easily be the result of
an artistic choice rather than of style changes over time. Your suggestion
is also possible, so on stylistic grounds, let's call it a toss-up. Then
you have to go back to the external evidence, which indicates they were both
written about the same time.

Ken - I have checked several highly respected sources and they all list
Henry V, Julius CAESAR, As You Like It, and Hamlet one after the other.
In the standard introduction found in the Signet Classics Shakespeare,
the dates are as follows: Henry V 1598-99, Julius Caesar 1599, As You
Like It 1599-1600, Hamlet 1600-1601. I double checked, James Shaprio
says that Shakespeare was working on Hamlet late in 1599.

I bought my copy of the book in Borders. It's listed on amazon.com and
bn.com. I bet you could find a copy in one of your local bookstores or
they could order a copy. Read it with an open mind!

I hope you don't mind that I use only ken when addressing you. When I
type you full name here, I always find myself wanting to but a &quot;r&quot;

I don't think it's possible, Ken. I also think that there's plenty of
evidence that Hamlet at least was around much earlier. The evidence has
been ignored because it isn't a good fit with WS of Stratford's dates,
just as the wealth of Tempest dating evidence has been ignored.

Most writers I know--and I know many, being a writer myself--tend to
work on one major opus at a time. A few work on more than one, usually
in different genres. Shakespeare, being a genius and possibly hypomanic
like so many other brilliant artists, might have had the energy to work
on several, but as I said, I doubt he could have penned all those plays
in such a short period.

That said, I admire Shapiro's other work a lot, and will try to read
his book when I have a minute or ten to spare.

Four plays in one year! Why, that's almost the wordage of a typical
young adult novel. How could any human being have coped with the
gigantic labor of writing the equivalent of a novelette every three
months?

Seriously, many first rate writers have produced a greater volume of
work, year after year, than Shakespeare managed, according to Mr.
Shapiro, in 1599. The only riddle is why this particular period was
more productive than the Shakespearean average, to which there is a
plausible answer: that the Lord Chamberlain's Men wanted new material
for the newly opened Globe.

Regarding the &quot;earlier Hamlet&quot;: Since the evidence for its existence is
discussed in every history of the Elizabethan stage, it can hardly be
said to be &quot;ignored&quot;. Rather, anti-Stratfordians who ignore the
indications, such as Nash's quotation of line that isn't in our Hamlet,
that it was a different play.

And if I put a--hole after your name it would fit perfectly. I opened
up to you quite sincerely originally, not realizing the jerk you are.
That said:

This timeline, if one accepts traditional dating would be more
acceptable, although there is a lot to look into. Again I I see a huge
jump between Caesar and Hamlet. I recently saw it (Caesar) again in
Baltimore after many years and was struck at how spare and primitive it
seemed compared to Hamlet and I thought, these two plays just don't
belong developmentally in the same period, much less year. The woman
next to me disagreed saying she thought Shakespeare deliberately wanted
to show Jonson he could write a &quot;classical&quot; tragedy. So who knows?

BTW, if Shapiro believes the four hour version was never meant to be
played, why was it written? Q2 contradicts his assertion, and Harvey's
&quot;The Wiser Sort&quot; also would indicate the fuller version was aimed at a
select audience.

Lynne - Shakespeare probably spent his days, rehearsing, acting and
writing. Perhaps, he knew how to focus his mind and energy on one task
at a time. Perhaps, his fellow company members gave him time off to
write.

Shakespeare was a genius, but he worked hard at writing.

As for the earlier Hamlet, most repected scholars, support the idea
that an earlier version of the Hamlet story was written by Kyd. They do
not claim it was written by Shakespeare. No respected scholar would
take a title from a list and claim it was an earlier version of The
Tempest. If The Spanish Maze was published, it would be possible to
compare it to The Tempest. Most respected scholars know it is
impossible to discuss two plays when one has been published and one is
just a title.

Ken - I have no idea what you mean by calling Julius C spare and
primitive. Is it spare because there are no subplots? What in the play
is primitive?

It appears that the woman next to you doesn't know what a &quot;classical&quot;
tragedy is. There are exceptions, but most Greek tragedies have a
unity of time, place and action. These are the kind of tragedies
favored by Aristotle. Compared to the number of tragedies written,
only a handful of Greek tragedies are extent. Perhaps many of them did
not use the three unities. Along come the neo-classiicists who turned
Aristotle into a rule book for writing plays. Shakespeare did not
follow the unities. The only time he came close is in The Tempest. Of
the Jonson plays I'm familiar with, he followed the unities. Perhaps he
and Shakespeare had friendly or heated discussions about the unities.

Are you familiar with Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra? It goes all
over the place, covers a great period of time, and has all kinds of
action.
This must have made John Dryden crazy because he wrote his own version
of the play called All for Love; or, The World Well Lost. It follows
the unities to the letter.

As for your BTW, read Shapiro and find out for yourself. In short,
Shaprio believes that in the writing, Hamlet got away from Shakespeare.
No other Shakespeare play is as long and except for King Lear, no other
play has as many versions.

Exactly what I said. The evidence for it has largely been ignored. But
there is plenty although there are people far more knowledgeable about
it and better able to discuss it than I. My feeling is that when the
dating for The Tempest falls--as I believe, judging from the response
we're getting to our essays, that it will--it will then be acknowledged
that many other plays were also written much earlier than previously
supposed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No respected scholar would

"/>

And neither did we. We have so much evidence that Tempest is an earlier
play--much of it from respected traditional scholars who have finally
woken up and smelled the coffee--that the name is merely one little
island in an entire sea of evidence. In other words, take the name
Spanish Maze entirely away, and we still have enough and more to show
that Tempest was written much earlier than 1610. The latest traditional
scholar to tackle the date suggests in a new essay that it had to
predate 1599. That is several years before even we dared to date it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This is simply not so if the name is a perfect fit, and this name is
close to perfect. Nevertheless, as I said, we have far more evidence
than simply the name of an earlier play. We've quite convincingly
knocked out Strachey, replaced him with earlier and far better sources,
and pushed the date back for many and varied reasons. Spanish Maze is
simply the shrimp in the paella.

And just think, Tom, when I'm fit and not messing around with
Shakespeare, I write two young adult novels a year. Maybe 100-150,000
words. Why, that means Shakespeare could easily have written eight damn
fine plays between January and December. I expect he could polish off
an act between breakfast and lunch. ;)

Seriously though, Hamlet (to take just one example) is so brilliant. It
is a multi-faceted jewel. One can hold it up to the light and turn and
turn it, look at it from a hundred different angles, and always get
something new and sparkling from it. It's nothing to do with the length
of the play. It's more the density, how so much stunning poetry,
intriguing material about law, about astronomy, about religion, etc.,
etc., can be packed into &quot;the equivalent of a novelette.&quot; I cannot
imagine even a manic genius, possibly the greatest the world has ever
seen, writing four like that in a year.

There is much more evidence for it than against it. That's what's been

&gt;&gt; I don't think it's possible, Ken. I also think that there's plenty of
&gt;&gt; evidence that Hamlet at least was around much earlier. The evidence has
&gt;&gt; been ignored because it isn't a good fit with WS of Stratford's dates,
&gt;&gt; just as the wealth of Tempest dating evidence has been ignored.

&gt;&gt; Most writers I know--and I know many, being a writer myself--tend to
&gt;&gt; work on one major opus at a time. A few work on more than one, usually
&gt;&gt; in different genres. Shakespeare, being a genius and possibly hypomanic
&gt;&gt; like so many other brilliant artists, might have had the energy to work
&gt;&gt; on several, but as I said, I doubt he could have penned all those plays
&gt;&gt; in such a short period.

&gt;&gt; That said, I admire Shapiro's other work a lot, and will try to read
&gt;&gt; his book when I have a minute or ten to spare.

Well, Lope De Vega (1562-1635) used to say he could write a play in 24
hours, whether that is true, who knows, but what we do know is that he
wrote over 1800 dramtic works, in addition to non-dramtic works that
run to 21 volumes.

We might also observe that Shakespeare's sometime collaborator, Tho.
Heywood claimed to have had &quot;at least a main finger&quot; in over 220 plays
over 40 years- which is over five plays per year for an extended
period.

I'm sure there are many other examples that make shakespeare's work
ethic pale in comparison.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Shakespeare was a genius, but he worked hard at writing.

&gt; As for the earlier Hamlet, most repected scholars, support the idea
&gt; that an earlier version of the Hamlet story was written by Kyd. They do
&gt; not claim it was written by Shakespeare. No respected scholar would
&gt; take a title from a list and claim it was an earlier version of The
&gt; Tempest. If The Spanish Maze was published, it would be possible to
&gt; compare it to The Tempest. Most respected scholars know it is
&gt; impossible to discuss two plays when one has been published and one is
&gt; just a title.

Why 1599? Perhaps much earlier. In fact, if the latest scholar is

I'm not sure what you're saying. Seeing something through the press and
having something staged are very different from actually writing a
novel or play--or perhaps that's not what you mean. But on one occasion
I had four novels all in edit at the same time. I could do that, but I
couldn't have *written* them all at the same time. Nor could most

Not at all. But prose is very different from verse, which is far more
spare and condensed. The output of poets is usually much lower than
that of prose writers for obvious reasons. Shakespeare wrote in some
kind of verse, usually iambic pentameter, most of the time.

Not sure what place Holinshed has in this discussion. Perhaps you could

four plays that included Hamlet in one year. Hamlet was his masterpiece
in the opinion of most scholars. Not only that. I'm sure he couldn't
have written Hamlet in 1599. It had to be earlier. And imo it had to be
written and rewritten over several years. In fact we have some evidence

Stratford served any kind of apprenticeship. On the contrary, the story
goes that V and A emerged like a full-blown rose from the spade of a
gardener who had never in his life before eared the previously barren
land. That was in 1593. Didn't give him much time to write all those
plays and all that poetry. No wonder he had to write four plays in

If you seriously believe that four plays in one year is an incredible
output and aren't shaken in that view by the plethora of more
productive writers in all realms of literature, there isn't much point
in arguing further. I'll limit myself to a secondary issue:

Don't you think that Stratfordians might regard, say, &quot;The Two

&quot;Henry VI&quot; as apprentice works? Or do you think that &quot;apprentice&quot; is a

By standard chronological notions, Shakespeare averaged about two plays
a year, hardly a killing pace or inconsistent with four in a
particularly fruitful season.

According to Stratfordians, Shakespeare sprang full grown

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; out of the sea and composed (according to Shapiro and others) zillions
&gt; of works in a very short space of time.

"/>

Lynne - Your above quote is sheer nonsense. That was the Romantics view
of Shakespeare. That is NOT the view of Stephen Greenblatt, Michael
Wood, Marjorie Garber, or James Shapiro. I agree with them. Early
plays like &quot;Two Gents,&quot;&quot;Titus,&quot;&quot;Comedy of Errors,&quot; and &quot;Henry VI&quot; all
have good things to offer in performance, on the other hand,
Shakespeare wrote better plays in his career.

I don't know first hand, but writing plays in prose might be easier
than writing them in poetry. I hope you are aware that Shakespeare
wrote in both in almost all of his plays. It became a habit with habit,
so he didn't have to relearn this skill from play to play.

James Shaprio makes it clear that four plays in a year happened only
once in Shakespeare's career. Hamlet is a masterpiece, although some
might disagree, but it is different from Heney V, Julius C, and As You
Like It. The three are good plays, but they aren't masterpieces.

As for your Tempest essays, PERHAPS you and Dr. Stritmatter are too
busy to post essays on The Fellowship site. What I see there is just a
power point presentation. I'm sure your fellow Oxfordians have praised
your work to the sky. I would like to hear what others think or do you
have to keep this all hush hush. Have you shown your work to
Greenblatt, Garber, Shapiro, Frank Kermode, Stanley Wells, David Scott
Kastan, or Jonathan Bate?

Lynne, if you weren't so busy posting here, at the Fellowship, or
snooping around the web, PERHAPS you too could write four books, short
stories, whatever in a year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; makes sense to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Examples would help of great writers who _finished_major masterpieces,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; including one of their master works, simultaneously, or in the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; season.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you will discount Dickens' performance in 1837, juggling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oliver Twist and Pickwick Papers while editing a magazine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dickens' writing covered a great number of years. He more often than
&gt;&gt;&gt; not progressed from one novel to another. Show me when he ever had four
&gt;&gt;&gt; novels published in a year.

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.perryweb.com/Dickens/life_events.shtml

&gt;&gt; Oddly enough, you are not answering my point that Dickens had two
&gt;&gt; novels appearing (in monthly installements)

&gt; Neil, they seem to me to be published beginning in different years. In
&gt; addition, are we sure he was writing them as the installments were
&gt; being published?

"/>

Are you suggesting that Dickens had Oliver Twist and Pickwick Papers
completely written prior to their serialization?

I honestly don't know the answer to this, although I

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; do know he sometimes had to struggle to keep up with the publishing
&gt; sched. But yes, you have a point. He was very prolific.

&gt; in the same year while he
&gt;&gt; also was editing a magazine. If we go back to 1836 Mr. Dickens was
&gt;&gt; seeing Sketches by Boz through the press, having two plays staged, and
&gt;&gt; writing Pickwick Papers.

&gt; I'm not sure what you're saying. Seeing something through the press and
&gt; having something staged are very different from actually writing a
&gt; novel or play--or perhaps that's not what you mean.

"/>

A dramatist would often participate in the staging of his play,
particularly if it was a premiere. I find it hard to believe a theater
addict like Dickens would just send off a playscript and forget it.
Likewise, do you think Dickens never bothered with proofs, etc, for
Sketches by Boz?

But on one occasion

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I had four novels all in edit at the same time. I could do that, but I
&gt; couldn't have *written* them all at the same time. Nor could most
&gt; literary writers.

"/>

As shown, Dickens was writing two novels at once. I've cited Pickwick
Papers and Oliver Twist; I could also cite Oliver Twist and Nicholas
Nickleby, both of which where appearing in magazines in 1838.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Just from the standpoint of word-count,
&gt;&gt; Dickens outdoes Shakespeare in 1599. But perhaps you think a
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare play runs 500-600 pages....

&gt; Not at all. But prose is very different from verse, which is far more
&gt; spare and condensed. The output of poets is usually much lower than
&gt; that of prose writers for obvious reasons.

"/>

I'm sure that's the primary reason for the small quantity of ancient
Greek drama we possess, Lynne. Those reports of 90 and 100 plays from
noted dramatists must be part of a conspiracy.

Shakespeare wrote in some

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; kind of verse, usually iambic pentameter, most of the time.

"/>

I seem to recall an awful lot of prose in As You Like It and Henry V.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In music, Mozart and Handel come to mind. Mozart's final year saw the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last two piano concertos, the unfinished Requiem, the clarinet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concerto, Die Zaberflote, and various smaller-scale pieces.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a good point and to my mind Mozart is the other great genius of
&gt;&gt;&gt; all time; however, we are comparing apples with oranges for many
&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Mozart wrote music, Shakespeare literature (Duh).

&gt;&gt; Yes, everyone knows writing a symphony or piano concerto is far easier
&gt;&gt; than writing a play or novel.

&gt; No, it is just different. Therefore it is hard to compare the two.

"/>

Not really. But it probably is for you, since you are losing this
argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Mozart apparently composed everything in his head first.

&gt;&gt; Isn't that where a writer composes?

&gt; Ha ha. I meant Mozart apparently composed the entire work in his head
&gt; before committing it to paper. He *really* blotted nothing. We have no
&gt; idea what Shakespeare did.

&gt;&gt; So he may
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually have composed those pieces over many years. We have no idea
&gt;&gt;&gt; how Shakespeare wrote.

&gt;&gt; And since we have &quot;no idea&quot; how Shakespeare wrote (all those cribs from
&gt;&gt; Holinshed must have been an accident, Lynne?) we have to assume
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare could not have written four plays in one year?

&gt; Not sure what place Holinshed has in this discussion. Perhaps you could
&gt; explain.

"/>

You stated we have &quot;no idea&quot; how Shakespeare wrote. One of the plays
that sparked this discussion was Henry V, which is largely based on
Holinshed. If you can't get the connection between cribbing from a book
and &quot;how Shakespeare wrote&quot;, I fear your argument is beyond saving.

My personal feeling is that Shakespeare could not have written

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; four plays that included Hamlet in one year.

"/>

Tom Veal has stated it's useless to argue with your personal feelings,
and so I will take my leave here.

Hamlet was his masterpiece

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; in the opinion of most scholars. Not only that. I'm sure he couldn't
&gt; have written Hamlet in 1599. It had to be earlier. And imo it had to be
&gt; written and rewritten over several years. In fact we have some evidence
&gt; of that, even excluding the Ur-Hamlet.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Mozart served a long apprenticeship, which is what we normally see
&gt;&gt;&gt; with artists. According to Stratfordians, Shakespeare sprang full grown
&gt;&gt;&gt; out of the sea and composed (according to Shapiro and others) zillions
&gt;&gt;&gt; of works in a very short space of time.

&gt;&gt; Pile enough straw, Lynne, and you could start a fire. I'm not aware of
&gt;&gt; any &quot;Stratfordian&quot; that fits your description.

&gt; I don't know any *Stratfordian* who suggests that Shakespeare of
&gt; Stratford served any kind of apprenticeship.

"/>

I seem to recall several of the early plays show signs of &quot;learning the
trade&quot;.

On the contrary, the story

&gt; gardener who had never in his life before eared the previously barren

Are you suggesting that to be known as a poet, Shakespeare had to have
*published* his juvinalia?

Didn't give him much time to write all those

I often have the odd sensation watching many Shakespeare plays (and other
Renaissance drama) that they take place in the time allotted on stage. For
some reason, even in something like &quot;Titus&quot; which obviously has to span

&gt; I don't think it's possible, Ken. I also think that there's plenty of
&gt; evidence that Hamlet at least was around much earlier. The evidence has
&gt; been ignored because it isn't a good fit with WS of Stratford's dates,
&gt; just as the wealth of Tempest dating evidence has been ignored.

&gt; Most writers I know--and I know many, being a writer myself--tend to
&gt; work on one major opus at a time. A few work on more than one, usually
&gt; in different genres. Shakespeare, being a genius and possibly hypomanic
&gt; like so many other brilliant artists, might have had the energy to work
&gt; on several, but as I said, I doubt he could have penned all those plays
&gt; in such a short period.

&gt; That said, I admire Shapiro's other work a lot, and will try to read
&gt; his book when I have a minute or ten to spare.

&gt; L.

"/>

For the record ...

(and for what it's worth: I don't think I've ever seen a chronology of the
plays that didn't have some version of the disclaimer &quot;based to some extent
on guesswork&quot;.)

For an analysis I did a few years ago, I picked up the &quot;orthodox&quot; dates for
Shakespeare's plays from multiple sources. Shapiro's placement of all four
plays in 1599 is slightly unorthodox (none of my sources placed Hamlet so
early, for example).

I'm including here the four plays we're discussing and a few others
plausibly from the same period. I wasn't doing scholarly research, so I
didn't take careful notes about the sources, but I think the Oxford is
probably from an &quot;Oxford Companion ...&quot;. The Signet is from the 60's
(Sylvan Barnet, general editor), and the Yale is even older, from Tucker
Brooke's &quot;Shakespeare of Stratford&quot;, first published in the 20's.

Because the conversation turned to &quot;how hard is it to write verse?&quot; at one
point, I've included in parentheses the total number of lines, and the
percent of those lines which are blank verse, rhymed verse, and prose
(reprinted in the Bedford Companion, from Harbage's &quot;Complete Pelican&quot;).
The number of lines of prose is always dicey, since it depends on the
margins, so to speak, but these should be roughly accurate.

Title - Oxford, Signet, Yale (lines, blank verse, rhymed verse, prose)

Merry Wives of Windsor - 1597, 1597-1601, 1599-1600, (2,598, 9.6, 3.8, 86.6)
Much Ado About Nothing - 1598-1599, 1598-1600, 1600, (2,549, 25.3, 3, 71.7)
Julius Caesar - 1599, 1599, 1599, (2,453, 92.5, 1.3, 6.2)
Henry V - 1599, 1598-1599, 1599, (3,176, 57.2, 3.2, 39.6)
As You Like It - 1599-1600, 1599-1600, 1600, (2,636, 35.2, 10.3, 54.5)
Hamlet - 1600-1601, 1600-1601, 1601, (3,776, 66.3, 5.7, 28.0)
Twelfth Night - 1601-1602, 1599-1600, 1601, (2,423, 31.4, 7.3, 61.3)

(no strong opinion on the matter myself; just trying to put the conversation
in context.)

I don't write short stories, seaker, although I did get a commission

Tempest and posting here, although I have begun another novel (twice,
actually. I've abandoned my work on the first but now have a fantastic
idea). And I'm working with Roger to prepare an edition of Tempest for
an academic publisher. You seem so despairing about my work. Why don't
you read something of mine, or some of the reviews I've had before
condemning me? At least then there would be some weight to your
comments.

And while we're talking about it, how many books do you publish in a

one has to hold oneself up as an example of what's desirable.

They are a kind of apprenticeship, yes, I agree, especially Comedy of

acknowledged to be his masterpiece. So I don't buy it, especially as

I have great respect for Shapiro. His book on the Jews is fascinating,
although according to one Jewish expert on the period that I know he
made a few mistakes. So I'll try to find time (ha ha) to read his new
book before commenting further.

Now I must really do some work. seaker has already taken me to task for

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that Shakespeare was probably working on several plays at the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time. From what I've read and know about other writers, this idea
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; makes sense to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Examples would help of great writers who _finished_major masterpieces,
&gt;&gt;&gt; including one of their master works, simultaneously, or in the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; season.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt; I don't think it's possible, Ken. I also think that there's plenty of
&gt;&gt; evidence that Hamlet at least was around much earlier. The evidence has
&gt;&gt; been ignored because it isn't a good fit with WS of Stratford's dates,
&gt;&gt; just as the wealth of Tempest dating evidence has been ignored.

&gt;&gt; Most writers I know--and I know many, being a writer myself--tend to
&gt;&gt; work on one major opus at a time. A few work on more than one, usually
&gt;&gt; in different genres. Shakespeare, being a genius and possibly hypomanic
&gt;&gt; like so many other brilliant artists, might have had the energy to work
&gt;&gt; on several, but as I said, I doubt he could have penned all those plays
&gt;&gt; in such a short period.

&gt;&gt; That said, I admire Shapiro's other work a lot, and will try to read
&gt;&gt; his book when I have a minute or ten to spare.

&gt;&gt; L.

&gt; For the record ...

&gt; (and for what it's worth: I don't think I've ever seen a chronology of the
&gt; plays that didn't have some version of the disclaimer &quot;based to some extent
&gt; on guesswork&quot;.)

&gt; For an analysis I did a few years ago, I picked up the &quot;orthodox&quot; dates for
&gt; Shakespeare's plays from multiple sources. Shapiro's placement of all four
&gt; plays in 1599 is slightly unorthodox (none of my sources placed Hamlet so
&gt; early, for example).

&gt; I'm including here the four plays we're discussing and a few others
&gt; plausibly from the same period. I wasn't doing scholarly research, so I
&gt; didn't take careful notes about the sources, but I think the Oxford is
&gt; probably from an &quot;Oxford Companion ...&quot;. The Signet is from the 60's
&gt; (Sylvan Barnet, general editor), and the Yale is even older, from Tucker
&gt; Brooke's &quot;Shakespeare of Stratford&quot;, first published in the 20's.

&gt; Because the conversation turned to &quot;how hard is it to write verse?&quot; at one
&gt; point, I've included in parentheses the total number of lines, and the
&gt; percent of those lines which are blank verse, rhymed verse, and prose
&gt; (reprinted in the Bedford Companion, from Harbage's &quot;Complete Pelican&quot;).
&gt; The number of lines of prose is always dicey, since it depends on the
&gt; margins, so to speak, but these should be roughly accurate.

&gt; Title - Oxford, Signet, Yale (lines, blank verse, rhymed verse, prose)

&gt; Merry Wives of Windsor - 1597, 1597-1601, 1599-1600, (2,598, 9.6, 3.8, 86.6)
&gt; Much Ado About Nothing - 1598-1599, 1598-1600, 1600, (2,549, 25.3, 3, 71.7)
&gt; Julius Caesar - 1599, 1599, 1599, (2,453, 92.5, 1.3, 6.2)
&gt; Henry V - 1599, 1598-1599, 1599, (3,176, 57.2, 3.2, 39.6)
&gt; As You Like It - 1599-1600, 1599-1600, 1600, (2,636, 35.2, 10.3, 54.5)
&gt; Hamlet - 1600-1601, 1600-1601, 1601, (3,776, 66.3, 5.7, 28.0)
&gt; Twelfth Night - 1601-1602, 1599-1600, 1601, (2,423, 31.4, 7.3, 61.3)

Thanks, Mark. The proportion of verse to prose is very interesting.

L.

Dear Kenkap - this productivity in terms of quantity is nothing
exceptional - look at Dickens' speed, albeit in a different genre but with
perhaps similar pressures in terms of exigency of delivery. Look at Mozart
in the 1790's - multiple works of the greatest genius produced one on top of
the other in different genres whilst suffering intense pressure of poverty
and ill-health. There are many many examples of artists of genius hitting a
rich vein and producing masterpiece after masterpiece in a short time. There
are even more examples of lesser writers writing enormous quantities of
middling work much faster than Shakespeare - Arnold Bennet or Anthony
Trollope, for example. With Shakespeare, too, he was working with material
he had probably been long familar with and part of his task was as much
adaptation as ab ovo creativity. Only doubt it if you want to, there's no
proof there. And at least Shakespeare was a full-time, dedicated man of the
theatre without all the other things to occupy him that De Vere had (I'm
reading Mark Anderson's interesting biography) those 37 plays had to be
written sometime by someone. (Don't get me started on Bacon...)

Yours

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; including one of their master works, simultaneously, or in the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; season.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you will discount Dickens' performance in 1837, juggling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oliver Twist and Pickwick Papers while editing a magazine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dickens' writing covered a great number of years. He more often than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not progressed from one novel to another. Show me when he ever had four
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; novels published in a year.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.perryweb.com/Dickens/life_events.shtml

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oddly enough, you are not answering my point that Dickens had two
&gt;&gt;&gt; novels appearing (in monthly installements)

&gt;&gt; Neil, they seem to me to be published beginning in different years. In
&gt;&gt; addition, are we sure he was writing them as the installments were
&gt;&gt; being published?

&gt; Are you suggesting that Dickens had Oliver Twist and Pickwick Papers
&gt; completely written prior to their serialization?

"/>

Not at all. My guess is that he didn't. But it's not something I've
researched so I was asking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I honestly don't know the answer to this, although I
&gt;&gt; do know he sometimes had to struggle to keep up with the publishing
&gt;&gt; sched. But yes, you have a point. He was very prolific.

&gt;&gt; in the same year while he
&gt;&gt;&gt; also was editing a magazine. If we go back to 1836 Mr. Dickens was
&gt;&gt;&gt; seeing Sketches by Boz through the press, having two plays staged, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; writing Pickwick Papers.

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what you're saying. Seeing something through the press and
&gt;&gt; having something staged are very different from actually writing a
&gt;&gt; novel or play--or perhaps that's not what you mean.

&gt; A dramatist would often participate in the staging of his play,
&gt; particularly if it was a premiere.

"/>

And how much work did he do regarding the staging of the plays when
they were actually in production? Again, a question to which I don't
know the answer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I find it hard to believe a theater
&gt; addict like Dickens would just send off a playscript and forget it.

"/>

Me too, but that's not an answer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Likewise, do you think Dickens never bothered with proofs, etc, for
&gt; Sketches by Boz?

"/>

On the contrary, I'm sure he did, but as I said, proofing is not in the
least like creating.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But on one occasion
&gt;&gt; I had four novels all in edit at the same time. I could do that, but I
&gt;&gt; couldn't have *written* them all at the same time. Nor could most
&gt;&gt; literary writers.

&gt; As shown, Dickens was writing two novels at once. I've cited Pickwick
&gt; Papers and Oliver Twist; I could also cite Oliver Twist and Nicholas
&gt; Nickleby, both of which where appearing in magazines in 1838.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just from the standpoint of word-count,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dickens outdoes Shakespeare in 1599. But perhaps you think a
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare play runs 500-600 pages....

&gt;&gt; Not at all. But prose is very different from verse, which is far more
&gt;&gt; spare and condensed. The output of poets is usually much lower than
&gt;&gt; that of prose writers for obvious reasons.

&gt; I'm sure that's the primary reason for the small quantity of ancient
&gt; Greek drama we possess, Lynne. Those reports of 90 and 100 plays from
&gt; noted dramatists must be part of a conspiracy.

"/>

I have no opinion on that, Neil, because I haven't studied the
question.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Shakespeare wrote in some
&gt;&gt; kind of verse, usually iambic pentameter, most of the time.

&gt; I seem to recall an awful lot of prose in As You Like It and Henry V.

"/>

Well, Mark has given us a few figures. It seems to me that the
tragedies and perhaps the histories contained much more verse than the
comedies, which makes some sense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In music, Mozart and Handel come to mind. Mozart's final year saw the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last two piano concertos, the unfinished Requiem, the clarinet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concerto, Die Zaberflote, and various smaller-scale pieces.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a good point and to my mind Mozart is the other great genius of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all time; however, we are comparing apples with oranges for many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Mozart wrote music, Shakespeare literature (Duh).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, everyone knows writing a symphony or piano concerto is far easier
&gt;&gt;&gt; than writing a play or novel.

&gt;&gt; No, it is just different. Therefore it is hard to compare the two.

&gt; Not really. But it probably is for you, since you are losing this
&gt; argument.

"/>

No, actually I got that opinion from my husband, who is a musician and
composer. So he must be the one losing the argument. I'll let him know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Mozart apparently composed everything in his head first.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't that where a writer composes?

&gt;&gt; Ha ha. I meant Mozart apparently composed the entire work in his head
&gt;&gt; before committing it to paper. He *really* blotted nothing. We have no
&gt;&gt; idea what Shakespeare did.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So he may
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually have composed those pieces over many years. We have no idea
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how Shakespeare wrote.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And since we have &quot;no idea&quot; how Shakespeare wrote (all those cribs from
&gt;&gt;&gt; Holinshed must have been an accident, Lynne?) we have to assume
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare could not have written four plays in one year?

&gt;&gt; Not sure what place Holinshed has in this discussion. Perhaps you could
&gt;&gt; explain.

&gt; You stated we have &quot;no idea&quot; how Shakespeare wrote. One of the plays
&gt; that sparked this discussion was Henry V, which is largely based on
&gt; Holinshed. If you can't get the connection between cribbing from a book
&gt; and &quot;how Shakespeare wrote&quot;, I fear your argument is beyond saving.

"/>

My argument has nothing to do with what Shakespeare took from others,
which is a different matter entirely from how he composed creatively
*what was his own* or whether he did so in his head so it could all be
laid out in one go without crossings-out, or whether he took a year or
ten to write a play. But I'm glad you realise that Shakespeare took
from Holinshed. It shouldn't be too far a stretch for you to get to
Strachey taking from Eden and Erasmus from there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; My personal feeling is that Shakespeare could not have written
&gt;&gt; four plays that included Hamlet in one year.

&gt; Tom Veal has stated it's useless to argue with your personal feelings,
&gt; and so I will take my leave here.

"/>

Phew. Good. Because all most traditionalists have on the dating of the
plays is personal feelings, those feelings having much to do with their
timeline as it fits the life of WS of Stratford.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Hamlet was his masterpiece
&gt;&gt; in the opinion of most scholars. Not only that. I'm sure he couldn't
&gt;&gt; have written Hamlet in 1599. It had to be earlier. And imo it had to be
&gt;&gt; written and rewritten over several years. In fact we have some evidence
&gt;&gt; of that, even excluding the Ur-Hamlet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Mozart served a long apprenticeship, which is what we normally see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with artists. According to Stratfordians, Shakespeare sprang full grown
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out of the sea and composed (according to Shapiro and others) zillions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of works in a very short space of time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pile enough straw, Lynne, and you could start a fire. I'm not aware of
&gt;&gt;&gt; any &quot;Stratfordian&quot; that fits your description.

&gt;&gt; I don't know any *Stratfordian* who suggests that Shakespeare of
&gt;&gt; Stratford served any kind of apprenticeship.

&gt; I seem to recall several of the early plays show signs of &quot;learning the
&gt; trade&quot;.

"/>

I seem to recall that you've taken your leave.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; On the contrary, the story
&gt;&gt; goes that V and A emerged like a full-blown rose from the spade of a
&gt;&gt; gardener who had never in his life before eared the previously barren
&gt;&gt; land. That was in 1593.

&gt; Are you suggesting that to be known as a poet, Shakespeare had to have
&gt; *published* his juvinalia?

"/>

Nope. But I would think that there would be something somewhere, even a
letter. Please dear God, send us something from this author in addition
to &quot;by me&quot; to show he was literate enough to write Hamlet.

Here's &quot;the works&quot; so to speak. This is in order by the earliest date

Complete Shakespeare, as reprinted in The Bedford Companion to Shakespeare

Not responsible for typos (well, actually I *am* responsible for any typos,
I'm just not going to *take* responsibility for them.)

Interesting that the Roman plays all have a high percentage of blank verse

strikes me as a fairly formal one.)

Lynne - Sorry that you've been ill.

At the time Dickens was writing plays, there were no directors in the
modern sense, there were still &quot;rules&quot; about how characters should be
played and how a play was stage. I don't know for sure, but given these
facts, Dickens probably had a hand in staging his plays.

I am not a writer, so how many books I have or haven't written in a
year isn't an issue. BTW, I read David Kathman's review of your little
Shakepeare/Oxford opus on amazon.com. My, my!

Why should I join the Fellowship. I don't believe that Oxford wrote the
plays, sonnets and narrative poems, so why waste my money. The current
postings by gonzalo are very funny. Poor, Dr. Stritmatter, oops, I mean
Bassanio, seems to be having a difficult time controling gonzalo. I
notice your posting saying that this was not the place comment about
Mark Anderson's little opus. Why not? It's a public site. Are you and
Bassanio trying to shield poor Mark from the fact that not everyone has
acclaimed his book? You and your fellow Oxfordians appear to have no
problem with commenting on other books on your public site!

BTW, I checked The Case for Shakespeare The End of the Authorship
Question. Scott McCrea clearly endnotes his writing. If you are going
to attack him, please give specific examples.

You write, &quot;Because all most traditionalists have on the dating of the

plays is personal feelings, those feelings having much to do with their

timeline as it fits the life of WS of Stratford.&quot; THIS IS MORE
NONSENSE LYNNE! You are repeating the Oxford Party line.

What quotation are you talking about I assume for 1589? But in 1594, in
the epistle to Christ's Tears he _does_quote a line from &quot;our Hamlet&quot;,
plus making references to the graveyard scene in which the line occurs
in attacking Harvey.

I got the book. I'll read it.

Read Sams on Hamlet before being so sure. Katherine Duncan Jones (no

many to assigning Hamlet in 1589 to Shakespeare.

Yes, I imagine he probably did, especially as he was so in love with

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mark. The proportion of verse to prose is very interesting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In particular I'd never thought about how heavily verse JC is.

&gt;&gt; Me neither, although I taught it a couple of times. But of course it
&gt;&gt; makes sense. Do you have a breakdown of verse in proportion to prose
&gt;&gt; for Titus Andronicus, by any chance?

&gt; Here's &quot;the works&quot; so to speak. This is in order by the earliest date
&gt; listed by my Oxford source. Source for the data is Alfred Harbage's Penguin

&gt; (Russ McDonald, editor).

&gt; Not responsible for typos (well, actually I *am* responsible for any typos,
&gt; I'm just not going to *take* responsibility for them.)

&gt; Interesting that the Roman plays all have a high percentage of blank verse
&gt; (except Coriolanus, which has no significant &quot;low&quot; characters and also
&gt; strikes me as a fairly formal one.)

Two minor comments, LynnE.

(1) I'm a Stratfordian and I've stated that Shakespeare served an
informal apprentice many, many times here and elsewhere. I've stated
that I don't think any writer of the time wrote worse plays than the
HENRY VI trilogy (though that's an exaggeration); how they lack every
conceivable earmark of apprentice-plays, I can't imagine. But OF
COURSE we don't have his earlier, possibly worse plays. Why should we?
Where are Marlowe's or Jonson's juvenilia? You can watch him learn
by observing his histories, which didn't make it to journeyman level in
my opinion till the Falstaff scenes allowed him to skip that level
(though he came back down to it with HENRY V). TITUS was also an
obvious apprenticework. Ditto 2 GENTLEMEN. ERRORS was a much much
better play, but carefully modeled on a classic, which is what
apprentices do. V&amp;A was not published till years after Shakespeare had
begun writing, and it's not a great poem. It shows high workmanship,
something apprentices specialize in, but poor organization, no
characterization, and little of the much greater diction raising
MACBETH and other later plays to so much higher a level. I'd say it
and LUCRECE are late apprentice works.

Meanwhile, he was obviously serving an apprenticeship in THEATRE ARTS.
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From Greene, we know he was an actor before he was a known playwright.

"/>

I would add that he undoubtedly served what was in effect a
mini-apprenticeship when he went to school, for he would have be
required to write, and I believe students of the time read and even
acted in plays. They did exercises in oratory, too.

(2) Doesn't anyone realize that Shapiro may have consciously or
unconsciously assumed Shakespeare composed four very interesting plays
during the single year his book is about (if indeed he did claim all
those plays were written during that year rather than merely finished
or worked on) to make that year a magic one?

&gt; And just think, Tom, when I'm fit and not messing around with
&gt; Shakespeare, I write two young adult novels a year. Maybe 100-150,000
&gt; words. Why, that means Shakespeare could easily have written eight damn

&gt; Seriously though, Hamlet (to take just one example) is so brilliant. It

&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you will discount Dickens' performance in 1837, juggling
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oliver Twist and Pickwick Papers while editing a magazine.

&gt;&gt; Dickens' writing covered a great number of years. He more often than
&gt;&gt; not progressed from one novel to another. Show me when he ever had four
&gt;&gt; novels published in a year.

&gt;&gt; http://www.perryweb.com/Dickens/life_events.shtml

&gt; Oddly enough, you are not answering my point that Dickens had two
&gt; novels appearing (in monthly installements) in the same year while he
&gt; also was editing a magazine. If we go back to 1836 Mr. Dickens was
&gt; seeing Sketches by Boz through the press, having two plays staged, and
&gt; writing Pickwick Papers. Just from the standpoint of word-count,
&gt; Dickens outdoes Shakespeare in 1599.

Dickens also wrote hurriedly, right up to the deadline. Of course,
Shakespeare was never accused of doing that!

But perhaps you think a

&gt; Yes, everyone knows writing a symphony or piano concerto is far easier

Of course! That's why there are so many more great symphonies and piano
concertos than there are great plays or novels!

&gt;&gt; Those who know me understand I'm having a bit of trouble with creative
&gt;&gt; material at the moment as I've been so ill. That's why I'm working on
&gt;&gt; Tempest and posting here, although I have begun another novel (twice,
&gt;&gt; actually. I've abandoned my work on the first but now have a fantastic
&gt;&gt; idea). And I'm working with Roger to prepare an edition of Tempest for
&gt;&gt; an academic publisher.

&gt; So you can work on several projects simultaneously (even while you're ill),
&gt; but Shakespeare couldn't?

No, I can't really, that's why the novel has not progressed. But I hope
to do much of the work on Tempest with Rog over Christmas, and then
write my novel, or at least some part of it, between Jan and March,
because I only have two events I have to attend and speak at. Then
everything goes crazy until May.

&gt; You seem so despairing about my work. Why don't
&gt;&gt; you read something of mine, or some of the reviews I've had before
&gt;&gt; condemning me? At least then there would be some weight to your

&gt;&gt; And while we're talking about it, how many books do you publish in a

1. I wasn't aware that &quot;we&quot; had &quot;ascertained&quot; that Mr. Shapiro spreads
the four plays in question over &quot;three to four years&quot;. I haven't read
his book but was under the impression that he placed all four in 1599.
They total about 60,000 words. I doubt that you really believe that
60,000 words a year of first rate English literature is an unbelievable
output (unless, that is, you refuse to grant that anyone but
Shakespeare is first rate).

2. Through lapsus mentis, I wrote &quot;Nashe&quot; where I meant &quot;Lodge&quot;. It is
the latter who quotes the line &quot;Hamlet, revenge!&quot; from the earlier
Hamlet. Those words do not, of course, appear in the play that has come
down to us.

Can you furnish a citation for the allusion to Hamlet in Nashe's
&quot;Christ's Teares&quot;? I don't recall it, and no reference book that I have
at hand mentions it.

1. We have several Hamlets by Shakespeare. The texts are different.
There are variations in character names. Many explanations are given
for the differences.

2. In Lodge's version we have a Ghost urging Hamlet to revenge.

3. In the version we usually use today, the Ghost says to Hamlet: &quot;So
art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear...&quot; and &quot;Revenge his foul and
most unnatural murder.&quot;

4. But you think this &quot;other&quot; play, talked of in 1594 and 96, is likely
not by Shakespeare though there are three different versions that we
accept as his in which a ghost tells Hamlet to avenge his death? Why do
you feel this version couldn't be by Shakespeare, Tom? Because it's too
early?

Reasons for thinking that the unknown Hamlet isn't the one that we know
today:

1. Nashe's comment in his preface to Greene's &quot;Menaphon&quot; (1589)
associates the play particularly with Senecan tragedy, which doesn't
fit the known Hamlet very well. The latter has none of Seneca's
gruesome features and would be an odd example for Nashe to select to
make his point (viz., the negative influence of Seneca on contemporary
drama).

2. The line that Lodge quotes, seemingly verbatim, does not occur in
the known Hamlet. All that it proves is that, as one would expect, both
plays featured a ghost and a revenge motif.

3. It is clear from Nashe's and Lodge's allusions that the unknown
Hamlet was a popular, well known work. If it was written by
Shakespeare, its absence from the list of his plays in Meres is
surprising.

4. If the known Hamlet was written before 1589, it is contemporary
with, or perhaps earlier than, Henry VI (almost certainly written in
1587 or later, as it uses material from the 1587 edition of Holinshed
that does not appear in the first (1577) edition). That the same man
wrote Henry VI and Hamlet almost simultaneously stands not within the
prospect of belief.

It's possible, of course, that young Shakespeare wrote a version of
Hamlet, then revisited the subject in his mature years. What isn't
possible is that his hypothetical apprentice piece bore any strong
resemblance to the Hamlet that we know today.

There's nothing odd about the existence of more than one Hamlet on the
Elizabethan stage. We have two Henry V's, two Taming of the Shrews, two
King Johns and three King Lears.

I take it that you, too, know nothing of the allusion in Nashe's
&quot;Christ's Teares&quot; to which Ken Kaplan refers.

Bob - Have you ever seen any of the Henry VI plays onstage? I have,
twice, and while I wouldn't claim any of them are great in terms of
literature, I will claim that with a talent cast and director, all
three make for good theatre. I have read and seen the cannon. Yes, some
plays are better than others, but I find interesting things in all of
them.

As for Venus and Adonis, it was published in 1593 which is early in
Shakespeare's writing career. A case can be made that Shakespeare began
his theatrical career as an actor and then added playwriting.

Instead of guessing about or commenting on James Shaprio's book, read
it first!

I'm not an expert on most of these so I can't comment. But I wouldn't
be at all surprised if the two King Johns were both by the same person,
one rather later than the other. I saw a rather interesting

No, I only know about the preface to Greene's Menaphon, Lodge, and the
other early mention in, I believe, Henslowe. But I'm not a Hamlet
expert by any means.

&gt;&gt;&gt; his book but was under the impression that he placed all four in 1599.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They total about 60,000 words. I doubt that you really believe that
&gt;&gt;&gt; 60,000 words a year of first rate English literature is an unbelievable
&gt;&gt;&gt; output (unless, that is, you refuse to grant that anyone but
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare is first rate).

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Through lapsus mentis, I wrote &quot;Nashe&quot; where I meant &quot;Lodge&quot;. It is
&gt;&gt;&gt; the latter who quotes the line &quot;Hamlet, revenge!&quot; from the earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hamlet. Those words do not, of course, appear in the play that has come
&gt;&gt;&gt; down to us.

&gt;&gt; 1. We have several Hamlets by Shakespeare. The texts are different.
&gt;&gt; There are variations in character names. Many explanations are given
&gt;&gt; for the differences.

&gt;&gt; 2. In Lodge's version we have a Ghost urging Hamlet to revenge.

&gt;&gt; 3. In the version we usually use today, the Ghost says to Hamlet: &quot;So
&gt;&gt; art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear...&quot; and &quot;Revenge his foul and
&gt;&gt; most unnatural murder.&quot;

&gt;&gt; 4. But you think this &quot;other&quot; play, talked of in 1594 and 96, is likely
&gt;&gt; not by Shakespeare though there are three different versions that we
&gt;&gt; accept as his in which a ghost tells Hamlet to avenge his death? Why do
&gt;&gt; you feel this version couldn't be by Shakespeare, Tom? Because it's too
&gt;&gt; early?

&gt;&gt; Lynne

&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you furnish a citation for the allusion to Hamlet in Nashe's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Christ's Teares&quot;? I don't recall it, and no reference book that I have
&gt;&gt;&gt; at hand mentions it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Seriously, many first rate writers have produced a greater volume of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work, year after year, than Shakespeare managed, according to Mr.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shapiro, in 1599.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First off we've ascertained that the period in question is really three
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to four years, not one, so its moot. But I'd love it if you can name a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; few &quot;first rate&quot; writers who managed that type of output at that level
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in one year. Even Dylan, who was moving very fast, was nowhere near
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that pace.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only riddle is why this particular period was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more productive than the Shakespearean average, to which there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plausible answer: that the Lord Chamberlain's Men wanted new material
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for the newly opened Globe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding the &quot;earlier Hamlet&quot;: Since the evidence for its existence is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discussed in every history of the Elizabethan stage, it can hardly be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said to be &quot;ignored&quot;. Rather, anti-Stratfordians who ignore the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indications, such as Nash's quotation of line that isn't in our Hamlet,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that it was a different play.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What quotation are you talking about I assume for 1589? But in 1594, in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the epistle to Christ's Tears he _does_quote a line from &quot;our Hamlet&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plus making references to the graveyard scene in which the line occurs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in attacking Harvey.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I got the book. I'll read it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think it's possible, Ken. I also think that there's plenty of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence that Hamlet at least was around much earlier. The evidence has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been ignored because it isn't a good fit with WS of Stratford's dates,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just as the wealth of Tempest dating evidence has been ignored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most writers I know--and I know many, being a writer myself--tend to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work on one major opus at a time. A few work on more than one, usually
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in different genres. Shakespeare, being a genius and possibly hypomanic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like so many other brilliant artists, might have had the energy to work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on several, but as I said, I doubt he could have penned all those plays
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in such a short period.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, I admire Shapiro's other work a lot, and will try to read
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his book when I have a minute or ten to spare.

Lynne and Tom - I don't what the big deal is with two Hamlets by two
different authors. It's way past Shakespeare's day, but when Racine's
Phaedra was playing in Paris there was another play called Phaedra
playing at another theatre. A few years ago, there were two musicals
based on the 1920s poem, The Wild Party, which played in New York
during the same season.

As for the different versions of Hamlet, I quote from Shaprio's book.
&quot;...since the 18th century the play has existed in multiple, hybrid
versions -- some editors relying more heavily on the Second Quarto,
others on the Folio text, and still others promiscuously drawing on
both as well as on lines from the First Quarto. One reason why no two
readers' or actors' Hamlets are alike is that no two modern versions of
Hamlet are either. Combining
different parts of these texts, editors have cobbled together an
incoherent Hamlet that Shakespeare neither wrote not imagined. It's
not the excision of motive nut it duplication that makes the conflated
versions of Hamlet that are now taught and staged so puzzling: Hamlet
is nboth resigned and determined, caught between knowing and having,
damned if he does and damned if he doesn't kill Claudius. We're left
with a Hamlet who is confused -- but not the confusion that Shakespeare
intended.
Some recent editors have come to regret their decisions to fall
into line and produce a conflated Hamlet they didn't believe in; others
have dug in their heels, preferring what's familiar. The only major
edition to break with tradition and choose an unconflated text is the
Oxford Shakespeare -- though its editors went with Shakespeare's
revised version rather than his first draft, basing their edition on
the Folio text. The long-awaited publication of the new Arden edition
of Hamlet promises to change this situation. In offering each of the
three surviving early versions of Hamlet separately, its editors will
encourage others to follow their lead. In a generation or two, I
suspect, soon, only scholars interested in the history of the play's
reception will still be reading a conflated Hamlet.&quot; (p. 318-319)

This is what Ron Rosenbaum wrote about a few years ago in the New
Yorker and what he mentioned in his New York Observer article, &quot;The
Shakespeare Code: Is Times Guy Kind of Bard 'Creationist'?&quot; Sept. 9,
2005. This is what people are going to be talking about long after Mark
Anderson's book ends up on the remainder table. If Anderson's book is
so important, why hasn't any major newspaper or journal reviewed it?

Just got Shapiro's book. He's not the only critic who feels Hamlet got
away from the author. Caesar felt to me too much &quot;step by step&quot;, too
simply structured and bare compared with the density of Hamlet. There
were flashes in Caesar, but nothing close to the sustained brilliance,
complexity, and intensity of Hamlet. If Dylan is an analogy, Caesar is
&quot;Tines They Are A Changing&quot;, Hamlet is &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;.

I found Henry V more pulsing, engaging, complex than Caesar.

&gt; It appears that the woman next to you doesn't know what a &quot;classical&quot;

&gt; only a handful of Greek tragedies are extent. Perhaps many of them did
&gt; not use the three unities. Along come the neo-classiicists who turned
&gt; Aristotle into a rule book for writing plays. Shakespeare did not
&gt; follow the unities. The only time he came close is in The Tempest. Of
&gt; the Jonson plays I'm familiar with, he followed the unities. Perhaps he
&gt; and Shakespeare had friendly or heated discussions about the unities.

&gt; Are you familiar with Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra? It goes all
&gt; over the place, covers a great period of time, and has all kinds of
&gt; action.
&gt; This must have made John Dryden crazy because he wrote his own version
&gt; of the play called All for Love; or, The World Well Lost. It follows
&gt; the unities to the letter.

&gt; As for your BTW, read Shapiro and find out for yourself. In short,
&gt; Shaprio believes that in the writing, Hamlet got away from Shakespeare.
&gt; No other Shakespeare play is as long and except for King Lear, no other
&gt; play has as many versions.

I'd call what you're seeing in Caesar &quot;clean-ness&quot;, perhaps, but I don't
find the depth of character and density of individual speeches out of step
with the plays we are assuming are contemporary. (I don't care too much
whether or not these four plays were all actually written in 1599; I do find
it plausible that they were all written during the same period.)

I agree, though, that Henry V has a more sprawly nature, which makes it more
fun. (Like you, perhaps, I tend to prefer the big sprawly plays; they're so
full of every kind of life.) Shakespeare had set the bar pretty high with
the Henry IVs; probably he couldn't disappoint the audience, even if he
*had* wanted to write a &quot;cleaner&quot; play than the IVs.

(AYLI is pretty clean, too, in a way, although as a comedy it superficially
appears to be structurally sloppier. The tales of the multiple
lovers/lusters and the city/country scenes are beautifully intertwined.
And, like the other three plays, its poetry is as good as it gets.)

In short, I think that the great variety we see in the four plays can be
explained as the result of the stories, sources, and genres he was working
with.

It's interesting that Henry V, Caesar and Hamlet are three of Shakespeare's
most ambiguous plays. They have supported drastically different
interpretations over the years, more so than many other of Shakespeare's
plays*, and it's my sense that this is inherent in the plays, not imposed by
us. Is Henry V pro-war or anti-war (or both)? Is Caesar about principles
triumpant over tyranny, or principles out of control (or both)? Hamlet ...
well you know about Hamlet. You don't hear many arguments on &quot;What is
Macbeth really about?&quot; I'm not one of those who tries too hard to build a
biography of the author out of his works, but it makes me think.

(Whew. Thinking is hard. Enough of that!)

* (Merchant of Venice is another, but I think more because our times are
different than because of intrinsic qualities.)

(And ... I don't mean this as a left-handed compliment ... I'm surprised to
find that I'm enjoying this conversation with you.)

&gt; 3. Mozart served a long apprenticeship, which is what we normally see

&gt; zillions of works in a very short space of time.

"/>

Such hyperbole ill-suits someone who bristles so often at perceived
misrepresentations of alter-Shakespeareanism. I think you will find that
those of us who believe Shakespeare wrote his own works limit him to two
long poems, a collection of sonnets, 37 extant plays (and possibly one
or two non-extant plays), and a few miscellaneous short poems. It's an
impressive quantity of work, but hardly staggering. Moreover, he had at
least twenty years to compose said works. Twenty years doesn't seem like
&quot;a very short space of time&quot; to me.

It is in any case a strange complaint coming from someone who believes
that some other writer wrote Shakespeare's works. I am aware of no other
proposed alternative Shakespeare who would have had significantly more
time to compose the works, and all of them would have been additionally
burdened by composing the works now attributed to them under their own
names -- which seems to enlarge the miracle rather than lessen it. It
becomes even more staggering when one considers that these alternative
Shakespeares somehow composed the works without anyone's being aware of
it. How they must have envied their front man, sitting around doing
nothing for weeks on end while they tried to find a spare hour or two to
complete another masterpiece without getting caught.

...
Shakespeare's Roman plays (meaning Coriolanus, Julius
Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra) are Roman in more ways than
one. The plot has an antique simplicity and clarity, as well
as being set in antiquity. There are no comic scenes, except
for the (Welsh ?) rustic who brings the asp. (Why was he so
necessary? Does it tell us anything about other comic scenes
like the Porter in Macbeth?)

That follows the model of Seneca, though Shakespeare is
careful to avoid Senecan rant (except for Bully Bottom's
'raging rocks'). Someone mentioned lately that the Comedy of
Errors keeps the Unities of Time and Place; that follows
another model, Plautus, who in turn followed Greek models.

The kind of writer Shakespeare was, he could take on any
constraint and win. But most of the time, there was no need
to take on the constraints of the ancients; only sometimes,
when he deliberately recalled their work or wrote about
them. (Maybe Ben would have satirised him.)

Mm, interesting question. There's been much written on it, of course,
from both sides of the argument, but I would say (and this is just an
opinion of course) that the language is so stunningly careful in
places, yet so ambiguous, and so difficult sometimes to unscramble,
that it would probably not reveal itself entirely through performance,
which takes place in a flash. One cannot cogitate on meaning or beauty
of language in any lengthy way because the actors are already onto the
next scene.

There are passages that I imagine even in the sixteenth century would
have clarified themselves only through study. They are so dense and
rich. One gets tremendous pleasure from watching a Shakespeare play,
but an additional and different kind of pleasure from reading/studying
one. I have to believe that Shakespeare took so much care because he
knew that eventually people would sit down and read, as well as
perform, what he'd written.

It has to be early. I'm rushing out today in the Christmas crush to buy

If Meres wasn't infallible, he could easily have left out Hamlet.

I think that Oxford's name on the list does advance the Oxfordian case,
as we realise that Meres knew that certain plays were written by him. I
agree that Shakespeare's name on the list is a conundrum, though it has
been unpuzzled in various ways by various Oxfordians--not sure if
there's a definitive answer. I find it interesting that Shakespeare's
name was entirely left off Peacham's list, which appears to be in part
copied from Meres. Perhaps Peacham was in on the secret.

No, Oxford wrote very little under his own name, I imagine when he was

No one, of course, regards Meres as &quot;infallible&quot;, but he shows greater
acquaintance with Shakespeare than with any other playwright, so he
pretty clearly had first-hand knowledge of the man's work. If
Shakespeare wrote the early &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which was, judging by Nashe's and
Lodge's statements, a widely popular play, its omission from the list
in Palladis Tamia is very surprising, though not conclusive.

OTOH, Meres says nothing about Oxenford that isn't in &quot;The Art of
English Poesy&quot;. There's no way to tell whether he had independent
acquaintance with Oxenford's writings. That he was capable of simply
copying from Puttenham is proven by his inclusion of the non-existent
Edward Feris among English tragedians. See

No, I wasn't thinking of his being burdened by his correspondence to

&gt; Riverside, which I don't have. Many of the chronologies I've seen have
&gt; the bulk of the work falling between about 1590-92 and 1604 or 5, with
&gt; a few later plays such as the romances.

Here's the chronology according to Oxford, Yale and Signet. This is in
Oxford's order; so note, for example, that Comedy of Errors would have been
first in the Signet or Yale order. Even excepting the romances, the
&quot;pessimistic&quot; ranges are

Oxford: 1591-1607
Signet: 1591-1607
Yale: 1590-1608

The &quot;optimistic&quot; ranges are:

Oxford: 1589-1608
Signet: 1588-1609
Yale: 1588-1609

The miminum &quot;pessimistic&quot; range is more than 15 years for the first 32 plays
(including Edward III). The &quot;optimistic&quot; ranges are about 19 years.
Excluding the Romances, as I said.

The output was slightly lower (more like one play per year) after 1605 (but
hardly negligable, in my opinion, especially considering many of these are
his masterpieces). Including them would add 2-4 years to the ranges.

Hi Mark,

Perhaps we should also note that some of these are only partly by
Shakespeare; the Oxford lists Shakespeare as co-author for Timon,
Macbeth, Henry VIII and Kinsmen. Also, Pericles may be a dramatazation
of a 'novel'.

I checked a copy of The Riverside Shakesepeare today and the dates
listed agree for the most part with Oxford, Yale and Signet. When
looking at Shakespeare writing career, the Romances should be included.

I also checked Harold Bloom's Shakespeare book. Yes, he believes that
Shaksepeare wrote the ur-Hamlet. He says that most Shakespeare scholars
disagree but he agrees with Peter Alexander who believes the same
thing. Bloom doesn't explain why he thinks this is the case.

Given that Bloom writes ex cathedra, his book has no notes or a
bibliography. It might be worth finding a copy of Alexander's book to
find more details. Bloom's belief gives no comfort to the Oxfordian
crowd because he is firm in his belief that William Shakespeare wrote
William Shakespeare. Bloom would attend a feminist cirtic's meeting
before he would change his mind

I agree, although the lower output makes it reasonable to say he was slowing
down or even in semi-retirement. The original argument between Mark
(Steese, not me) and Lynne was sort of quibbling about a career of &quot;rather
less than 20 years&quot;. This looks like a career of a couple decades to me.

Here's a plausible reconstruction of the career. For the most part, I
selected the dates in the middle of the various ranges, but I admit some
choices were a little arbitrary (it seemed reasonable, given how speculative
some of this dating is anyway). I left the original Oxford, Signet, Yale
dates, and added a notation FAD - Full Authorship Disputed - to indicate
possible collaboration, unfinished works, etc. I so notated Macbeth,
although I think Middleton's contribution is usually thought to be small,
and it seems to me to be predominantly Shakespeare's.

Two points:

1) Shapiro notwithstanding, only in his early years do we need to assume
even three plays written solo in a single year.

2) Solo output really drops off after *1600*, then even more after 1608.
(Is 18 years &quot;rather less&quot; than 20? I'll let Mark and Lynne sort that one
out.)

I haven't read Alexander so I don't know. But there's an interesting
discussion about dating Hamlet going on in another forum at present.
And looking back at old Fellowship postings, I found Ken talking about
Christ's Tears, which Tom Veal asked about. This is what Ken said or
quoted (not sure which):

It's interesting that Nashe again refers to Hamlet a few years later,
in the epistle to the Reader in Christs Tears Over Jerusalem (1594). In
it, Nashe says of Gabriel Harvey:
Was neuer whore of Babylon so betrapt with abhominations as his stile
(like the dog house in the fields) is pestred with stinking filth. His
vaineglorie (which some take to be his gentlwoman) he hath** new
painted
ouer an inch thicke.** Some fewe crummes of my booke he hath confuted,
all
the rest of his inuention is nothing but an oxe with a pudding in his
bellie, not fit for any thing els, saue only to feast the dull eares of

ironmongers, ploughmen, carpenters, and porters. Maister Lillie, poore
deceassed Kit Marlow, reuerent Doctor Perne, with a hundred other quiet

senslesse carkasses before the conquest departed, in the same worke he
hath most notoriously &amp; vilely dealt with; and to conclude, he hath
proued
him selfe to be the only** Gabriel Graue-digger** vnder heauen.&lt;

Joseph W. DeMent notes in this passage:
[A] parallel . . . between Nashe's phrase &quot;new painted ouer an inch
thick&quot;
and Hamlet's rhetorical injuction to the skull of Yorick:

Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch

thick, to this favour must she come. Make her laugh at that.&lt; (DeMent,
Joseph W., &quot;A Possible 1594 Reference to Hamlet&quot;, Shakespeare
Quarterly,
vol. xv, 1964, pp.446-7 at p. 446)

Not so sure. However, doesn't really matter. It's the dating that's
important here. Nashe seems to make many early allusions to
Shakespeare's plays. For example, according to Penny McCarthy, he
alluded to Tempest in Lenten Stuffe, 1599. That was a shocker for us.

Well, I think I said most of the canon was written in less than twenty
years according to traditionalists, or words to that effect. You've
proven this below, by showing that even in the traditional timeline,
output drops off substantially after 1600, and even further after 1608.
In addition, we're going to date Tempest much earlier, which might
affect the other romances also. If Tempest was before 1605, and two
Gentlemen was 1589-93 according to most traditional dating, the time
frame grows ever smaller for the bulk of the works.

That's very interesting, ignoto. First of all, the before 1599 date
comes from a traditionalist, whose work was published in a prestigious
journal. Second, I imagine you haven't seen the scholarship concerned
so you have no idea how cracked it is. To my mind it's just a possible
piece of evidence that shows that The Tempest, often regarded as
Shakespeare's farewell to the theatre, was written much earlier than

Actually the drop off in output can be reasonably imputed to have been

&gt;&gt; 1611 - Tempest - 1610-1611, 1611, 1611-1612
&gt;&gt; 1613 - Henry VIII - 1613, 1613, 1612-1613 (FAD)
&gt;&gt; 1613 - Two Noble Kinsmen - 1613-1615, none , none (FAD)

&gt;&gt; Two points:

&gt;&gt; 1) Shapiro notwithstanding, only in his early years do we need to assume
&gt;&gt; even three plays written solo in a single year.

&gt;&gt; 2) Solo output really drops off after *1600*, then even more after 1608.
&gt;&gt; (Is 18 years &quot;rather less&quot; than 20? I'll let Mark and Lynne sort that one
&gt;&gt; out.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I also checked Harold Bloom's Shakespeare book. Yes, he believes that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shaksepeare wrote the ur-Hamlet. He says that most Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; scholars disagree but he agrees with Peter Alexander who believes the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same thing. Bloom doesn't explain why he thinks this is the case.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Given that Bloom writes ex cathedra, his book has no notes or a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bibliography. It might be worth finding a copy of Alexander's book to
&gt;&gt;&gt; find more details. Bloom's belief gives no comfort to the Oxfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt; crowd because he is firm in his belief that William Shakespeare wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare. Bloom would attend a feminist cirtic's meeting
&gt;&gt;&gt; before he would change his mind

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lots and lots, Mark. I'm not going to go into it here. But Tempest has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just been dated back before 1599 by one scholar, and most scholars

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paul Crowley showed how most traditionalists in the past dated the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thankfully, this is now beginning to change. Several scholars put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hamlet, for example, much earlier.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. Several orthodox scholars put an immature, lost hamlet much
&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier.

&gt;&gt; I would agree it's probably an immature version, possibly rather like
&gt;&gt; the first quarto. Possibly was the first quarto...

&gt; IS the first quarto full of senecan bombast?

I can see the revenge tragedy aspect being rather Senecan. Bombast is
in the eye of the beholder. But certainly Greene or whoever wrote
Groatsworth thought that Shakescene could bombast out a blank verse
with the best of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the tempest dating of 1599, that one belongs to the 'I smoked

&gt;&gt; That's very interesting, ignoto. First of all, the before 1599 date
&gt;&gt; comes from a traditionalist, whose work was published in a prestigious

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree, although the lower output makes it reasonable to say he was slowing

&gt;&gt;&gt; less than 20 years&quot;. This looks like a career of a couple decades to me.

&gt;&gt; Well, I think I said most of the canon was written in less than twenty
&gt;&gt; years according to traditionalists, or words to that effect. You've
&gt;&gt; proven this below, by showing that even in the traditional timeline,
&gt;&gt; output drops off substantially after 1600, and even further after 1608.
&gt;&gt; In addition, we're going to date Tempest much earlier, which might
&gt;&gt; affect the other romances also. If Tempest was before 1605, and two
&gt;&gt; Gentlemen was 1589-93 according to most traditional dating, the time
&gt;&gt; frame grows ever smaller for the bulk of the works.

&gt; Actually the drop off in output can be reasonably imputed to have been
&gt; caused (jnter alia) by a change in writing style (From a typically
&gt; elizabethan ornamental style to a more complex metaphorical style)

And which plays towards the end of Shakespeare's career would you say
exhibit a &quot;complex metaphorical style&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Lynne, getting back to work.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's a plausible reconstruction of the career. For the most part, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; selected the dates in the middle of the various ranges, but I admit some
&gt;&gt;&gt; choices were a little arbitrary (it seemed reasonable, given how speculative
&gt;&gt;&gt; some of this dating is anyway). I left the original Oxford, Signet, Yale
&gt;&gt;&gt; dates, and added a notation FAD - Full Authorship Disputed - to indicate
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible collaboration, unfinished works, etc. I so notated Macbeth,
&gt;&gt;&gt; although I think Middleton's contribution is usually thought to be small,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and it seems to me to be predominantly Shakespeare's.

In that case you are correct, as always. :) Unfortunately, so was he.
Steese said, &quot;he had at least 20 years to compose [the canon]&quot;; true. You
replied &quot;Most of his work, according to traditional dating, was accomplished
in rather less than 20 years&quot;, which, depending on the meaning of &quot;rather
less&quot; and &quot;most&quot; is also true. You could also have said he composed &quot;most&quot;
(19) of his works in rather less than 10 years.

In any case, I believe the original argument was &quot;was this a staggering
amount of work?&quot; Two plays per year, once in a while three, is certainly
staggering compared to my literary output (0 plays per milennium), but
doesn't seem out of the question for someone whose job it was to turn out
plays. Four of the stature of JC, AYLI, H-V and Hamlet seems like a lot,
but he was clearly at the top of his game during that period.

Does Professor McCarthy hypothesize (i) that Nashe quoted in 1599 from
a then-existing &quot;Tempest&quot; or (ii) that &quot;The Tempest&quot;, whenever written,
made use of something that Nashe wrote in 1599?

I don't have the article right here, Tom, but from what I remember she
waffles a bit as to who influenced whom, but in the main (she speaks of
other plays also) comes out for Shakespeare influencing Nashe. The
quote is very interesting, a take on Miranda and Ferdinand playing
chess, and Ariel's speech about Ferdinand's father being dead at the
bottom of the sea. As I said, this would put Tempest way earlier than
we would have dared to suggest. It's iffy on its own (as to who
influenced whom, you're quite correct), but together with a whole pile
of other allusions to the play by other writers becomes more
convincing.

When I see the article again, I'll quote that bit here for you.

Of course you have. Oxfordians, in constructing their apology are
always apt to find such things as suit their fancies, so we have, for
example, &quot;the spanish maze&quot; as an allusion to the tempest and &quot;A

Assuming you are correct (big assumption), and without seeing any of
the 'evidence' you have (a considerable liability) one could postulate
eg that the references to an earlier tempest are a reference to a lost
play upon which shakespeare based his own tempest, thus neatly doing
away with the question about the narrative source of the tempest.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lots and lots, Mark. I'm not going to go into it here. But Tempest has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just been dated back before 1599 by one scholar, and most scholars
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agree it's a late play. On another forum (I don't think it was here)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paul Crowley showed how most traditionalists in the past dated the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing of the plays immediately before our first record of them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thankfully, this is now beginning to change. Several scholars put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hamlet, for example, much earlier.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. Several orthodox scholars put an immature, lost hamlet much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would agree it's probably an immature version, possibly rather like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first quarto. Possibly was the first quarto...

&gt;&gt;&gt; IS the first quarto full of senecan bombast?

&gt;&gt; I can see the revenge tragedy aspect being rather Senecan. Bombast is
&gt;&gt; in the eye of the beholder. But certainly Greene or whoever wrote
&gt;&gt; Groatsworth thought that Shakescene could bombast out a blank verse
&gt;&gt; with the best of them.

&gt; So, did shakespeare also bombast out the spanish tragedy?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the tempest dating of 1599, that one belongs to the 'I smoked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too much crack at university and now can't tell predilection from fact'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; school of scholarship.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's very interesting, ignoto. First of all, the before 1599 date
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comes from a traditionalist, whose work was published in a prestigious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; journal. Second, I imagine you haven't seen the scholarship concerned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so you have no idea how cracked it is. To my mind it's just a possible
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; piece of evidence that shows that The Tempest, often regarded as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's farewell to the theatre, was written much earlier than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; previously thought.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Right then, what's the reference.

&gt;&gt; Not even a please? Where are your manners, Mr. Professor?

&gt; Of course you have. Oxfordians, in constructing their apology are

&gt; example, &quot;the spanish maze&quot; as an allusion to the tempest and &quot;A

&gt;&gt;&gt; I haven't seen the article that you cite but know from other reading

&gt;&gt; I don't have the article right here, Tom, but from what I remember she

Wow, that's quite a theory. You *are* working hard at trying to find a
loophole. Of course, if you're right, Shakespeare certainly wouldn't
have needed Strachey, so he could have written The Tempest long before
1611. ;)

One other factor is the probability that Shakespeare wrote a few plays
at the beginning of his career that were so bad they disappeared.

The chronology you give is similar to what mine would be except that I
might put some plays a year or two earlier, and I can't believe King
John was among his first.

Actually, I'm pretty sure it is logically coherent. But time will tell
if you're outgunned or if we are. Since three major traditional
scholars have already said they're impressed with what we've done, I'm
assuming it will be you.

One could easily argue anything--and you frequently do--but in this
case the arguments are getting sillier and sillier. All the elements in
Strachey were available in earlier sources that we can prove
Shakespeare (and Strachey) used. Thank you for giving me the
opportunity to state that again. In addition, if there were an earlier
Tempest by someone else (ha ha) that had all the elements in it that
other early allusions to Tempest show, Shakespeare wouldn't have needed
to go to Strachey. But do carry on.

First things first!

Who's Will I Am! Shake Speare!?

1. A mythical figure?

2. The fellow whose baptismal and burial dates (April 26, 1564 and
April 25, 1616) just happen to mirror Pythagorean Number Play on Jesus
Christ, 7284, as Light of the World, 1000 as in 7284 + 1000 = 8284 and
2602 + 1564 + 2502 + 1616 = 8284?

3. Alias Christopher Marlowe, 11384, as in 8284 - 1000 + 4000 = 11384,
where Light of the World's passage through the Darkness, - 1000, of
Ignorance concludes with a Speare Shaken, 4000, at the &quot;eyes of
Ignorance&quot;?

4. Alias the World's First Flying Saucer Ace?

Perhaps &quot;traditionalist&quot; is not the right moniker for Penny
McCarthy. Here is the publisher's description of her forthcoming
book, &quot;Pseudonymous Shakespeare: Rioting Language in the Sidney
Circle&quot;:
----------
In the course of unmasking &quot;R.L.,&quot; McCarthy scrutinizes devices
employed by writers in the Sidney coterie. Among McCarthy's
stunning-but solidly underpinned-conclusions are: Shakespeare used the
pseudonym &quot;R.L.&quot; among other pseudonyms; one, &quot;William Smith,&quot;
was also his &quot;alias&quot; in life; Shakespeare was at the heart of the
Sidney circle, whose literary program was hostile to Elizabeth I; and
his work, composed mainly from the late 1570s to the early 90s,
occasionally &quot;embedded&quot; in the work of others, was covertly alluded
to more often than has been recognized.

Contents: List of illustrations; List of tables; Acknowledgements;
Preface; List of abbreviations; Introduction-Highways and labyrinths;
First candidate-Robert Langham, 'El Prencipe Negro;' Supposes;
Second candidate-Dom Diego; More supposes; Third candidate-friend
of Richard Barnfield; Further supposes; Fourth candidate-Dick of
Lichfield; Last supposes; R.L.'s biography; Envoi; Bibliography;
Index.
----------
Source:
[p.
18]

If this blurb is accurate, Miss McCarthy can scarcely be a Stratfordian
(nor an Oxenford booster, as he was distinctly removed from the Sidney
circle). Her views are dubious evidence for the direction of the
scholarly mainstream.

&quot;R.L.&quot;, in case anyone is wondering, is conventionally identified
as Richard Linche, the author of two books of translations from the
Italian. According to the Oxford DNB (a &quot;literary blog&quot;, as the
Great Gangleri terms it, but nonetheless occasionally useful),

&quot;Similarities in style and the unusual use of Italian tags and
mottoes have led critics to identify the initials R. L. on the
title-page of Diella, Certain Sonnets (1596) with Linche. . . . The
only other contemporary reference to Linche, if it is to Linche, occurs
in the dedication of Richard Barnfield's sonnet 'If music and sweet
poetry agree' to his 'friend, Maister R. L.'. . . . Although this
identification remains hypothetical, an interesting piece of indirect
but substantiating evidence can be found in a short note dated 1598 and
addressed by Sir Robert Sidney to the earl of Essex. It reads as
follows: 'Sir Robert Sydney ... renews his suit on behalf of
Lieutenant Linch for a company to be bestowed upon him' (Salisbury
MSS, vol. 14, 176.26). There is reason to believe that Linche might be
the lieutenant mentioned by Robert Sidney in this note. In his sonnet
Barnfield claims that Spenser and Dowland shared a patron, a certain
'knight', whose identity remains unknown. If the unnamed knight in
Barnfield's sonnet dedicated to R. L. is Sir Robert Sidney, the most
likely candidate given his strong personal connection with Spenser and
Dowland, it would be reasonable to assume that Richard Linche, poet and
translator, and Lieutenant Linch are the same person.&quot;

But there is no need to discuss or discover anything Tom, since other people
are already prescribed their role in any conversation, and the activity has
nothing to do with exploration, and all to do with an hierarchial

This was Knight's comment on the Brit Lit System, and he said its Product of

Nothing that you have written supports your characterization of the
Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as a &quot;literary blog&quot;. Your
larger point seems (I stress &quot;seems&quot;, for who can tell with your
effusions?) to be that standard authorities are unreliable. They may,
of course, be wrong in particular instances, but we won't see very far
if we refuse to stand on anyone else's shoulders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so you have no idea how cracked it is. To my mind it's just a possible
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; piece of evidence that shows that The Tempest, often regarded as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's farewell to the theatre, was written much earlier than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; previously thought.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Right then, what's the reference.

&gt;&gt; Shakespeare Yearbook, 2004. Article by Penny McCarthy of Glasgow
&gt;&gt; University. I believe the correct title is &quot;Some Quises and Quems:
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's True Debt to Nashe.&quot; But as I said, it's just a
&gt;&gt; possible. It's when one adds it to other early allusions to The Tempest
&gt;&gt; that it becomes interesting. And we've found quite a few.

For those who are wondering, &quot;her&quot; in the I.I.'s post refers to Madame

&gt;&gt; Please cite any traditional dating of Shakespeare's works that has

&gt;&gt; traditional account I'm familiar with gives him more than twenty
&gt;&gt; years: the Riverside Shakespeare's chronology, for example, has him
&gt;&gt; composing *1 Henry VI* in 1589-90 and *The Two Noble Kinsmen* (in
&gt;&gt; collaboration with Fletcher) in 1613.

&gt; Perhaps you could give us the whole chronology according to the
&gt; Riverside, which I don't have.

"/>

I'll see if I can find the time to copy it out. How are you coming with the
cites for the traditional datings?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Many of the chronologies I've seen have the bulk of the work falling
&gt; between about 1590-92 and 1604 or 5, with a few later plays such as
&gt; the romances.

Checking those cites will be fascinating.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; But even twenty years, wow. I find his output staggering,
&gt;&gt;&gt; considering that he had so many other things to do.

&gt;&gt; Are you under the impression that the Elizabethan stage was
&gt;&gt; comparable to Broadway or the West End, with virtually incessant
&gt;&gt; productions running all year round?

&gt; Nope, but I'm under the impression that Shakespeare was supposed to
&gt; act in them, help run the company, and also had various business
&gt; affairs. He was clearly a busy man. The newer biographies such as
&gt; Wood's seem to assume he was very very busy.

"/>

Well, yes, he was very very busy, what with his writing plays and all.
Quite an industrious fellow, that William.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is in any case a strange complaint coming from someone who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believes that some other writer wrote Shakespeare's works. I am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aware of no other proposed alternative Shakespeare who would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had significantly more time to compose the works, and all of them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have been additionally burdened by composing the works now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to them under their own names -- which seems to enlarge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the miracle rather than lessen it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, Oxford wrote very little under his own name, I imagine when he
&gt;&gt;&gt; was much younger.

&gt;&gt; You don't consider his correspondence to have been written under his
&gt;&gt; own name? Or do you not consider it as part of his literary output?

&gt; No, I wasn't thinking of his being burdened by his correspondence to
&gt; the point that he couldn't write the canon. Or including it in his
&gt; literary output proper. One must assume, after all, that if
&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the canon, he also corresponded with
&gt; various people, although goodness only knows what happened to his
&gt; letters.

"/>

Why must one assume that? I'm not being facetious here, I'm genuinely
curious: what is there about his having written his own works that leads to
the conclusion that he must have corresponded with anyone?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes, I know, the pat answer is that they were ephemera and he was only
&gt; middle class, so they disappeared. Unlike Jonson's ephemera.

"/>

And yet exactly like Marlowe's ephemera. And John Webster's. And George
Chapman's, et cetera, et cetera.

[snip]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford, in addition, was not burdened by several jobs, at least one
&gt;&gt;&gt; of them full-time,

&gt;&gt; What was Shakespeare's full-time job again? Oh yes, he worked for the
&gt;&gt; theater. Wow, it must have been almost impossible for him to find
&gt;&gt; time to compose plays while he was working for the theater. Who ever
&gt;&gt; heard of a playwright doing theater work?

&gt; Sarcasm doesn't suit you.

"/>

Lighten up, Lynne.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; WS of Stratford wasn't only an actor.

"/>

I didn't say he was. I said he worked for the theater. And by a strange
coincidence, the majority of his work was meant to be performed in the
theater. It's almost as though he realized he could put his talent for
writing to good use by providing his company with plays so they wouldn't
have to buy them from others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He was a sharer and a business man. He had several jobs that had to be
&gt; attended to. I'm not ruling him out on that account. I am simply
&gt; saying you cannot rule out Oxford for writing his own works and
&gt; letters if you don't rule out WS, who had a much more arduous
&gt; every-day job, one way and another, and a living to make.

"/>

Who said anything about ruling out Oxford's having written his *own* works?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; and has a much longer run-in to the canon, because scholars are
&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning to date material much earlier. That's difficult to do with
&gt;&gt;&gt; WS of Strat, because he would have been too young.

&gt;&gt; It's also difficult to believe. What scholars are beginning to date
&gt;&gt; material much earlier? And which material?

&gt; Lots and lots, Mark. I'm not going to go into it here.

"/>

I see by your other posts that &quot;lots and lots&quot; has dwindled into &quot;one,
maybe.&quot;

[snip]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On another forum (I don't think it was here) Paul Crowley showed how

Please forgive me for my unwillingness to accept Paul Crowley as an
authority on what traditionalists think or have thought.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thankfully, this is now beginning to change. Several scholars put
&gt; Hamlet, for example, much earlier.

"/>

Which ones?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It becomes even more staggering when one considers that these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alternative Shakespeares somehow composed the works without

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not they. He.

&gt;&gt; I was referring to all the proposed alternative Bards, hence the plural.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And I'm sure others were aware of it.

&gt;&gt; I'm impressed by your ability to be sure about something for which
&gt;&gt; there is not the slightest trace of evidence, especially in light of
&gt;&gt; your mournful wish for evidence of Shakespeare's literacy. You're
&gt;&gt; sure that others were aware that Oxford was Shakespeare...based on
&gt;&gt; what?

&gt; Based on the same certainty you have that WS of Stratford went to
&gt; school.

"/>

I've never expressed any certainty that William Shakespeare of Stratford
went to school. I'm not even certain that he wrote his own works. If anyone
could produce evidence to the contrary, I'd be happy to consider it. But as
it stands, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that Shakespeare
wrote his own works, and there is not the slightest fragment of evidence
suggesting that he was incapable of doing so, or that anyone else did.

&gt; Regards,
&gt; Lynne, getting back to work.

&gt;&gt; Here's a plausible reconstruction of the career. For the most part, I
&gt;&gt; selected the dates in the middle of the various ranges, but I admit some
&gt;&gt; choices were a little arbitrary (it seemed reasonable, given how
&gt;&gt; speculative
&gt;&gt; some of this dating is anyway). I left the original Oxford, Signet, Yale
&gt;&gt; dates, and added a notation FAD - Full Authorship Disputed - to indicate
&gt;&gt; possible collaboration, unfinished works, etc. I so notated Macbeth,
&gt;&gt; although I think Middleton's contribution is usually thought to be small,
&gt;&gt; and it seems to me to be predominantly Shakespeare's.

&gt;&gt; 1613 - Two Noble Kinsmen - 1613-1615, none , none (FAD)

&gt;&gt; Two points:

&gt;&gt; 1) Shapiro notwithstanding, only in his early years do we need to assume
&gt;&gt; even three plays written solo in a single year.

&gt;&gt; 2) Solo output really drops off after *1600*, then even more after 1608.
&gt;&gt; (Is 18 years &quot;rather less&quot; than 20? I'll let Mark and Lynne sort that
&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt; out.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I also checked Harold Bloom's Shakespeare book. Yes, he believes that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shaksepeare wrote the ur-Hamlet. He says that most Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; scholars disagree but he agrees with Peter Alexander who believes the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same thing. Bloom doesn't explain why he thinks this is the case.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Given that Bloom writes ex cathedra, his book has no notes or a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bibliography. It might be worth finding a copy of Alexander's book to
&gt;&gt;&gt; find more details. Bloom's belief gives no comfort to the Oxfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt; crowd because he is firm in his belief that William Shakespeare wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare. Bloom would attend a feminist cirtic's meeting
&gt;&gt;&gt; before he would change his mind

As a Stratfordian theory, I can see that flying.
One or two minor technical problems, of course,
but -- Hey -- genius is genius, and he'd have
found some way of getting them out.

Ah, yes, Mr. Crowley, you're repeating the same old Oxfordian standard
line on the subject. Lynne says much the same thing here, the same
thing is repeated on the Fellowship site, and Mark Anderson repeated
this in his letter to the New Yorker Observer last September.

I read that in the old days when someone became a Oxfordian, a little
piece of the brain was removed. These days, a microchip is implanted
and in a few short hours, the standard Oxfordian piffle comes pouring
out.

Mr. Crowley, why don't you read some current Shaksepeare scholars to
see what's new in the field. If you go slow, it might not strain your
brain too much.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing that you have written supports your characterization of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as a &quot;literary blog&quot;. Your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; larger point seems (I stress &quot;seems&quot;, for who can tell with your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effusions?) to be that standard authorities are unreliable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Within the specific context of Blavatsky - which I did not 'seem' to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about at all. What's your problem with this issue Tom? You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; characterise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing of others as 'effusions' when what is written in an authority
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plainly inadequate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I might also say that unless there is enough 'effusion' that words
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entirely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lose their flavour any context. Quite substantial writers have noted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fowles said their worth was precisely because that they are not exact,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only in a materialistic machine-age could we expect them to be so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They may,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of course, be wrong in particular instances, but we won't see very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if we refuse to stand on anyone else's shoulders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the subject is creativity, then you will pardon me for mentioning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the librarians and bibliophiles among us have an insufficient view.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My metaphor actually invoked leaving the library altogether and going
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no books are. It's a semiotic consideration, you see, that the label
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot evoke an understanding of what it describes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; characterized
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a &quot;literary blog&quot;, blogs have a higher status

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Author-ity' key: &quot;It is written', say the fundamentalists in both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; senses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that word.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intellectual world than I had supposed! Next the I.I. will inform
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the Britannica is a wikipedia and PMLA a newsgroup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But there is no need to discuss or discover anything Tom, since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are already prescribed their role in any conversation, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; activity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing to do with exploration, and all to do with an hierarchial
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; association with Greats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was Knight's comment on the Brit Lit System, and he said its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Product
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself does not even recognise genius - no matter the quality

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plath,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hughes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So beware any too-singular attention to what is writ in libraries,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be truths of examined life that have not found there way indoors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from

Arguing from the general to the particular is less useful here than it is

Who is comparing the Author with 'most writers?'

The only English writer to be seriously compared with William Shakespeare by
a serious Shakespearean writer is Powys, and Powys had hardly started

&gt; Quite an industrious fellow, that William.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is in any case a strange complaint coming from someone who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believes that some other writer wrote Shakespeare's works. I am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aware of no other proposed alternative Shakespeare who would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had significantly more time to compose the works, and all of them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have been additionally burdened by composing the works now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to them under their own names -- which seems to enlarge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the miracle rather than lessen it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, Oxford wrote very little under his own name, I imagine when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was much younger.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You don't consider his correspondence to have been written under his
&gt;&gt;&gt; own name? Or do you not consider it as part of his literary output?

&gt;&gt; No, I wasn't thinking of his being burdened by his correspondence to
&gt;&gt; the point that he couldn't write the canon. Or including it in his
&gt;&gt; literary output proper. One must assume, after all, that if
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the canon, he also corresponded with
&gt;&gt; various people, although goodness only knows what happened to his
&gt;&gt; letters.

&gt; Why must one assume that? I'm not being facetious here, I'm genuinely
&gt; curious: what is there about his having written his own works that leads to
&gt; the conclusion that he must have corresponded with anyone?

"/>

I cannot imagine any literate person of the time, especially someone as
brilliant as Shakespeare the author, not writing notes or letters to
anyone. It was after all the only way of communicating if one wasn't in
the same area as the person one wished to speak to. Authors, in
addition, are often addicted to letter writing, or perhaps now email
writing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Yes, I know, the pat answer is that they were ephemera and he was only
&gt;&gt; middle class, so they disappeared. Unlike Jonson's ephemera.

&gt; And yet exactly like Marlowe's ephemera. And John Webster's. And George
&gt; Chapman's, et cetera, et cetera.

"/>

Shakespeare, if you're correct, had a long career, as did Jonson. We'd
have to look back at Diana Price's book to see who left what in the way
of a literary paper trail. I think I have the book upstairs somewhere
if you wish me to comment further. But it'll need to wait a while.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford, in addition, was not burdened by several jobs, at least one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of them full-time,

&gt;&gt;&gt; What was Shakespeare's full-time job again? Oh yes, he worked for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; theater. Wow, it must have been almost impossible for him to find
&gt;&gt;&gt; time to compose plays while he was working for the theater. Who ever
&gt;&gt;&gt; heard of a playwright doing theater work?

&gt;&gt; Sarcasm doesn't suit you.

&gt; Lighten up, Lynne.

"/>

I'm very light, Mark, in fact forty pounds lighter than just after I
finished medical treatment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; WS of Stratford wasn't only an actor.

&gt; I didn't say he was. I said he worked for the theater. And by a strange
&gt; coincidence, the majority of his work was meant to be performed in the
&gt; theater. It's almost as though he realized he could put his talent for
&gt; writing to good use by providing his company with plays so they wouldn't
&gt; have to buy them from others.

"/>

Yes, that's the strongest point in his favour, I think. Of course, the
vast majority of actors did not write plays, and perhaps it would be
interesting to see how many playwrights of the time were actually
actors. I haven't studied this so I really have no idea. Dave Kathman
probably has something on it. But then, of course, we'd have to figure
out how many of these actor/playwrights were front men. ;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; He was a sharer and a business man. He had several jobs that had to be
&gt;&gt; attended to. I'm not ruling him out on that account. I am simply
&gt;&gt; saying you cannot rule out Oxford for writing his own works and
&gt;&gt; letters if you don't rule out WS, who had a much more arduous
&gt;&gt; every-day job, one way and another, and a living to make.

&gt; Who said anything about ruling out Oxford's having written his *own* works?

"/>

You misunderstand. I probably didn't put it well. I meant that you
can't rule Oxford out as the author of the canon simply because he had
the &quot;burden&quot; of writing his &quot;own&quot; works and letters, if you don't rule
out WS of Stratford, who had a much more arduous job.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and has a much longer run-in to the canon, because scholars are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning to date material much earlier. That's difficult to do with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WS of Strat, because he would have been too young.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's also difficult to believe. What scholars are beginning to date
&gt;&gt;&gt; material much earlier? And which material?

&gt;&gt; Lots and lots, Mark. I'm not going to go into it here.

&gt; I see by your other posts that &quot;lots and lots&quot; has dwindled into &quot;one,
&gt; maybe.&quot;

"/>

Nope. Many plays are beginning to be dated earlier by certain scholars.
Read McCarthy's article. Read Bloom on Hamlet. Read all the secondary
sources on Tempest. Some of them come in much earlier than 1611.
Eventually, read our material on Tempest, where we pull everything
together. The problem with much traditional scholarship is that it
dates the plays very soon or immediately before the first mention of
them. First, the first mention isn't necessarily the first performance
or publication, as our records aren't complete. Second, the date we
have of first publication or performance is only a date before which
the work had to be written--almost any time before depending on source
material. Third, many of these plays seem to be alluded to much
earlier, but these allusions are almost always explained away, usually
not very satisfactorily.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt; On another forum (I don't think it was here) Paul Crowley showed how
&gt;&gt; most traditionalists in the past dated the writing of the plays
&gt;&gt; immediately before our first record of them.

&gt; Please forgive me for my unwillingness to accept Paul Crowley as an
&gt; authority on what traditionalists think or have thought.

"/>

He's spot on here, although I'm not keen on his interpretations of the
sonnets.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Thankfully, this is now beginning to change. Several scholars put
&gt;&gt; Hamlet, for example, much earlier.

&gt; Which ones?

"/>

We've been talking about it elsewhere, Mark. Do try to keep up. ;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It becomes even more staggering when one considers that these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alternative Shakespeares somehow composed the works without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone's being aware of it. How they

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not they. He.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was referring to all the proposed alternative Bards, hence the plural.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I'm sure others were aware of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm impressed by your ability to be sure about something for which
&gt;&gt;&gt; there is not the slightest trace of evidence, especially in light of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your mournful wish for evidence of Shakespeare's literacy. You're
&gt;&gt;&gt; sure that others were aware that Oxford was Shakespeare...based on
&gt;&gt;&gt; what?

&gt;&gt; Based on the same certainty you have that WS of Stratford went to
&gt;&gt; school.

&gt; I've never expressed any certainty that William Shakespeare of Stratford
&gt; went to school. I'm not even certain that he wrote his own works. If anyone
&gt; could produce evidence to the contrary, I'd be happy to consider it. But as
&gt; it stands, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that Shakespeare
&gt; wrote his own works, and there is not the slightest fragment of evidence
&gt; suggesting that he was incapable of doing so, or that anyone else did.

Trapped me, did you :) ?

Even Henry V is structurally clunky and that seems to date from the start of
his peak period. Henry VIII - probably not his structure, I guess - is even
worse. But I think King John is somewhat underrated. I found it very
enjoyable in performance.
