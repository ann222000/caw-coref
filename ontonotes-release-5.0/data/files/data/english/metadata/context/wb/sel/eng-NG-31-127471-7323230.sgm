A Tale for You
("Then before he (Cu Chulainn) went, he twisted a withy into a ring and
wrote an ogham inscription on its peg (menoc), and cast it over the top
of a pillar stone.")
http://www.uwo.ca/english/florilegium/vol2/sayers.html

A tale for you,
A time or two
Amidst the parting sorrows.

A hero's choice,
A flame burned brightly,
A raven on an Ogham stone..

A withy bound round
A menoc in the middle,
A message of meaning.

A challenge issued,
A boundary bounded,
A crossing at the ford.

A brown and a white,
A battle of bedsheets,
A king and a queen.

A sword unsheathed.
A sword is lost,
A sword is regained.

A father and son.
A foster and a friend,
A teacher and a student.

A country is made,
A battle is joined,
A god becomes a man.

A man has man fathers,
A man stands against many,
A man's wounds are tended in sleep.

A driver goads the horses,
A driver goads the hero,
A driver alerts to danger.

A host is defeated,
A host are slain,
A host take a head.

A love is spurned,
A love is impossible
A love becomes the ending.

A wife is beauty,
A goddess is death,
A hero is the bright son.

A tale for you,
A time or two,
Amidst the parting sorrows.
