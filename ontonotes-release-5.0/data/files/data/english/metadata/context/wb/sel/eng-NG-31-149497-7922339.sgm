Studies have shown that atheists are less afraid of death than
religious people are.

Very beautiful.Seeing reality for what it is makes it that much more
powerful too. The &quot;afterlife&quot; is just a cop-out on everything in this
life.&quot;They're all together now, right?&quot; i.e. &quot;they're not really dead
right? they just took a trip to heaven-land, and they're all playing
baseball&quot;It's some bizarre Disney-esque method of discounting the fear
of death. It reeks of cowardice and self-flattery.We all come and we
all go.

I'm sorry you had to go through that, for real... It's always tough to
watch the hypnotized &quot;we know what the truth is, because it's always
what's nicest&quot; responses of many Christians to death/pain/etc... It's
good that you were able to keep a clear, stable head throughout this.
That should say a lot to your family! Should get them thinking...But,
speaking of all of this, the timing of your post is actually quite
relevant to something I've been thinking about recently.What are some
good responses when people start talking about brief-death/near-death
experiences that include visions of lights/flames, peace/fear, etc? A
Christian friend of mine and I were talking about that recently, and he
even gave me a book that talks about it, with &quot;testimonies&quot; and such
from people that have supposedly had these experiences...I'm trying to
think of good responses, preferably some that address the idea itself,
and not just &quot;religion&quot; as a whole, but I don't know how... It seems to
always come back to that, for him. So far, all of my responses sound
something like: &quot;They were delirious/confused.&quot; &quot;They were practically
DEAD, for cryin' out loud... how can we expect a clear testimony from
that?&quot;&quot;They're lying.&quot; &quot;That in no way proves God, much less a specific
God.&quot;Does this kind of sum it up, or can you help me out with some
better responses?(By the way, anyone can feel free to chime in on this,
just please don't give any pat &quot;Sunday school&quot; answers... been there,
done that.)Thanks all!Peace... - DoesItFlowP.S. The name of the book
is &quot;One Heartbeat Away,&quot; by Mark Cahill... He's a traveling Christian
evangelist, and gives out the book for free)

There is a doctor in Canada, (sorry I don't have the link, but I think
you can find it using Google), who can reproduce &quot;near-death&quot;
experiences at will by stimulating areas in the brain with electrodes.
It is just more evidence that all we are and all we experience is a
function of the brain's activity. You might find this useful to bring
up when people claim otherwise. There is also a study I saw somewhere
that indicated that epileptics have more &quot;religious&quot; experiences than
others; this is consistent with other findings. I have always been an
atheist, and I do not have any exaggerated fear of being dead - but I
hope when it happens, I shall not linger, as my dear husband is most
likely to do. He has ALS, which is one of the more unpleasant ways to
die, but he is facing his future with remarkable grace. But whether it
is because he is an atheist, or because he is no longer young and we
have had decent lives and have no unfinished business, I cannot say.

doesitflow,I'm an atheist but my husband is not. This subject about the
NDE or OBE are some of the reasons why he still believes as a &quot;theist&quot;
and the &quot;supernatural&quot; thingy. I found a site that has some interesting
info on the subject, here's the
link: http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/keith_augustine/HNDEs.htmlRega...

I'm sorry for your loss, for I too have lost someone I loved dearly
less than two weeks ago. I have faith that I will see her again, that
is my shield.Yes, faith can be broken, tear down and defeat but it can
also mend, rebuild, and prevail. It depends upon how you look at it,
half full, or half empty?I have no evidence to prove my faith, nor can
I disprove it. The evidence presented by our power to comprehend what
we percieve as reality can be changed, and that what was viewed as
preposterous is now viewed as mundane fact.The earth is flat! Humans
will never fly! Microbes, electrons, neurons, personal computers?
Balderdash! See what I mean?Having said all of that, let me close by
wishing you peace and solace. It was an online search for those very
things that led me here to your thoughts, and I felt compelled to share
with you my own views as well.Peace!

I would like to respond to this. I am sure you have heard the
saying, &quot;I would rather live my life as if there is a God, and die to
find out there isn't, than live my life as if there isn't, and die to
find out there is.&quot; I take this saying to heart because I wouldn't want
to disappoint an all-loving god. I mean, if he really sent his son to
die for us, if what he has to say is that important, then we should
probably listen.I am not afraid of death either. In fact before I
became saved I often thought of suicide. No one can say for sure
exactly what the next life will be like, and if the greatest being to
ever exist will meet me when I cross over, why not take the trip now?
Then I would know for sure how I was suppose to live, and what was
true, and what was not.However once you cross over you can't come back.
And if there really is a God, and The Bible really holds his
instructions, then me going against his will, when he has the ability
to destroy me, is not a real good idea. God has a plan for every human
being. And when you follow Him and listen to his Word then you will
find out what that plan is; and trust me, his plan for you is
wonderful! He is an all loving god, and wants you to live a wonderful
life. He will take you away when your life is complete, and if you have
followed Him to the best of your ability then you are rewarded in
heaven. Let me make that clear- Heaven is not the reward, you get
rewarded in heaven.The Bible says that God is pure and he is light.
Light cannot abide with darkness. Sin brings darkness. So if you have
sin you cannot be with God. A+B=C Water and Oil don't mix, and God
can't mix with sin. SooooIf you are not cleansed by Jesus' blood, you
cannot enter into heaven. And where do you go if you do not go to
heaven..... yes, hell. It is also a real place, where real torment goes
on.The things is, everyone comes into this world dirty. One, no not
one, is righteous. And the only way to get rid of the dirt, the only
way to bring light into your life, and thereby make you acceptable to
God, is to pray for Jesus to make you clean. You have to admit that you
are a sinner (you are dirty) and that Jesus died for you on the cross,
then arose 3 days later defeating death, and that without him you won't
make it.Otherwise you can't go into heaven. Not because God isn't
loving, not because God wants to punish you, not because God thinks you
didn't try hard enough; but because it simply can't be. God is pure and
all that is holy, while we are dirty and unrighteous. But because God
loves us (you and me) so much, he let his only son be beat and killed
for you and me. And if you can accept that, and believe that with all
of your heart, then you get to go to heaven and be with God and all of
the rest of us that have been made clean.

To anonymous: *Yawn*A-nony-nony, in case you didn't notice, we've all
heard that rhetoric about a million times. Now, here's a question for
you: WHY you believe any of that nonsense you just typed? What evidence
do you have that anything you've just written is true?
