And here's a little more simple a dish to cook, but still delicious...

Ingredients

2 pounds crawfish tails
1/4 pound butter
1 cup minced onion
1/2 cup minced bell pepper
1/2 cup minced celery
2 tablespoons crawfish fat
2 cups cold water
1 tablespoon corn starch
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup chopped parsley
Creole seasoning blend, to taste
Salt, to taste
Pinch dried thyme
Pinch dried oregano
1 bay leaf

Season the crawfish tails with salt, plus a little black and cayenne pepper.
Heat the butter in a saute pan and saute the onion, bell pepper and celery
until the translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the crawfish fat (or extra
butter if you don't have any), plus 1-1/2 cups water. Add the Creole
seasoning, thyme, oregano, bay leaf and crawfish tails. Bring to a boil,
then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. Dissolve the corn starch
in the remaining 1/2 cup water and add to the mixture. Add the green onions
and parsley, and cook an additional 5 minutes. Serve over hot long grain
rice.

YIELD: Dinner for 8, with leftovers.

I like birdwatching here in my garden.  There are some lovely birds to see.

Our UK robin is not the same as the US robin and our blackbird is not the
same either.

I like to feed the wild birds here in the winter. My friend said she has
adopted my idea of canary seed plus sunflower hearts to get the birds there,
against the wheat based stuff that she was buying from the shops which had
not much result.
Now she is thrilled at the amount of birds she is getting at her feeder.

I've been surprised in the difference between birds seen in the western US
and in the north-central US.

In California robins are little tiny things, and it's easy to miss their
orange fronts. Here in Iowa when the weather gets cold they seem to
develop heavier feathers, to the point that they look to be almost twice
the diameter of their summer-size selves! And their orange fronts are
quite spectacular.

The photo in Wikipedia is beautiful. I'll have to keep an eye out for them.

Since we're in a decent house with a nice yard and frequent wildlife
visits (we get squirrels frequently, including an occasional melanistic
European Grey, bunnys, and birds) we're going to set out feed for them
over the winter. The squirrels we see are mostly in the front yard trees,
but I suspect they have stored enough food for the winter. Just in case,
though, we'll leave some appropriate food out in the front yard.

When we get bunnies visiting it's usually outside our back fence. I should
be able to put a decent feeder out there.

And of course bird feeders we can put right outside the windows, to amuse
both us and the cats.

for entertainment value, you need a squirrel feeder that you put an ear of
corn on a nail.  I am told watching them get the corn off the cob is worth
the work.  Here, the buggers just steal the whole ear but even then they
have to work to get it!

My aunt had a pet bunny who was litterbox trained :)

I feed the birds and the squirrels.  There are lots of finches.  House
finches, red finches and the occasional purple finches.  Also lots of
Carolina chickadees that dart about faster than a speeding bullet!  I've
also got Carolina wrens but not until it gets cold outside.

Oh, and woodpeckers.  Had a red bellied one that hammered on my metal
chimney when I first moved in here and drove me nuts.  The small downy
woodpeckers are adorable.  I feed them suet and I also feed the squirrels -
cracked corn, sunflower seeds and peanuts.

Don't worry.  Squirrels don't apparently see much connection between the
food they store and what they actually eat in the winter.  They will be more
than happy to be fed.  Their tiny little squirrel brains aren't all that
great at searching out stored food.

Isn't it amazing how quickly a tiny little woodpecker can go from adorable
to driving you completely out of your mind?  And they can be very hard to
distract from something they like, such as the noise from a metal chimney.

The squirrels around my apartment are quite adept at seeking out food.  They
eat just about anything you set out for them.  They are fond of peanuts in
the shell and also cracked dried corn.  And the suet for the chickadees and
woodpeckers.  And sunflower seeds.

I have an enclosed storage built into my patio.  I used to keep bird seed in
there.  A woman from work gave me a big plastic bin to store it in.
Squirrels would sneak in, chewed through the plastic lid and ate all the
food.

I didn't realize I had squirrels.  I thought I had rats and who wants rats?
I bought poison.  The moment I saw a squirrel sliding under the storage room
door I removed the poison.  I don't want to poison squirrels!  They may be
annoying to some people but I didn't want to kill them.  I started storing
all the bird (and squirrel) food inside my apartment.

I put the left over dry cat food out for strays, but it's usually eaten by
squirrels - in fact they sit on the deck *waiting* for us to put the food
out.  It entertains the cats to watch the squirrels that close up, so it's a
form of kitty TV.  Jessie even uses my door curtains as a hammock so she can
be comfortable while she watches!  ;&gt;

LOL  What have I not posted?  Ah, the holidays are coming up!  Got this as a
gift (along with the recipe) from a co-worker back around 1990.

Spiked Egg Nog

18 eggs
1-1/2 lbs. white (castor) sugar
2 quarts milk
1 quart heavy cream
one fifth bottle rye whiskey
1/2 pint brandy
1/2 pint light rum

Separate 18 eggs.  Using a 2 gallon plastic bucket and a wooden spoon (don't
use metal!) mix the egg yolks and sugar together until you have a creamy
batter.  Add the whiskey, brandy and rum and stir constantly to avoid
curdling the yolks.  Stir in the milk and cream until blended.  Use a
blender to beat the egg whites to a thick froth.  Add to mixture in bucket
and fold under gently until mixed.  Chill immediately and pour into jars.
Makes 7 quarts.

&gt;&gt; What, are you guys too full to post a recipe or something? :)

&gt;&gt; Joyce

&gt; LOL  What have I not posted?  Ah, the holidays are coming up!  Got this as
&gt; a
&gt; gift (along with the recipe) from a co-worker back around 1990.

&gt; Spiked Egg Nog

&gt; 18 eggs
&gt; 1-1/2 lbs. white (castor) sugar
&gt; 2 quarts milk
&gt; 1 quart heavy cream
&gt; one fifth bottle rye whiskey
&gt; 1/2 pint brandy
&gt; 1/2 pint light rum

&gt; Separate 18 eggs.  Using a 2 gallon plastic bucket and a wooden spoon
&gt; (don't
&gt; use metal!) mix the egg yolks and sugar together until you have a creamy
&gt; batter.  Add the whiskey, brandy and rum and stir constantly to avoid
&gt; curdling the yolks.  Stir in the milk and cream until blended.  Use a
&gt; blender to beat the egg whites to a thick froth.  Add to mixture in bucket
&gt; and fold under gently until mixed.  Chill immediately and pour into jars.
&gt; Makes 7 quarts.

You folks remember when Lee called me a heifer the other night?  Well, I
have a storey to tell you about her and the &quot;firewater&quot;.  She knows I am
telling but since she is on the other side of the state, little she can do!

Ok, so we are at a convention of mostly partially sighted and blind people.
One of our friends got a real good location and  he agreed to buy  drinks at
the bar.  He KNOWS not to give her whiskey, she is really alergic and with
her heritage, &quot;firewater&quot; should never cross her lips.  So after we had a
few adult beverages (enough as we say to give the expression &quot;blind drunk&quot;
an whole new meaning) he gave her a shot of whiskey and after about three
minutes, the race was ON!  She gave him such a dressing down I bet it took
him six months to get over it.  Furrey and I both left the room.  Not
embarressed, just didn't want to enter the fracus when she decided to belt
him one.  Thankfully she didn't but, that man learned a lesson that night
and bet he won't do that again.  Now, thie is Lee, usually calm and thinks
things through before she says anything.  Now, call me names again!!!
