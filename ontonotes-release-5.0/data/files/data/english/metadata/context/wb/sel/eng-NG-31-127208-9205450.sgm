The injury list is quite full this week, with 13 players listed:
Donovan McNabb           Ankle/Right Thumb(O)
Quintin Mikell           Knee(O)
William Thomas           Illness(Q)
Jason Avant              Groin(P)
Brian Dawkins            Thigh(P)
Jon Dorenbos             Abdomen
Omar Gaither             Back
Todd Herremans           Knee(P)
William James            Foot(P)
Mike Patterson           Ankle
Brian Westbrook          Knee
Kevin Curtis             Thigh(P)
Takeo Spikes             Hamstring(P)

Obviously McNabb is the most noteworthy and AJ Feeley gets to start.  Wow,
what an opportunity for AJ.  National TV against the best team in the NFL.
Mikell is being replaced by JR Reed which is a big downgrade especially
since Mikell has been the best safety, this season.  Thomas listed as
questionable might mean that Winston Justice could start, which could get AJ
killed.

I am really curious to see the Eagles game plan against the Patriots.  I
think the game plan will incorporate 40% running plays, Westbrook as a
frequent decoy for the passing game, high percentage dinks and dumps by
Feeley, ball control to keep NE's offense off the field.  On defense, they
might play with 5 or 6 DBs with frequent safety and corner blitzes or 5 DL
to attempt to hurry Brady.  Jim Johnson will be mixing up the personnel, and
I think we will see some unusual groupings.

If the Eagles can effectively control possession, that is the best way to
slow down NE.  If they can actually score, once in a while, it might be a
closer game than expected.

I anticipate the Patriots D will focus on stopping Westbrook's running and
stopping Curtis from catching the ball.  If they accomplish these goals the
outcome is a foregone conclusion.  It would seem Vegas agrees.  Look
for Kyle Eckel (who?) to get several carries.

I believe you are stating how you would execute the game plan.  Since
you're not coaching and Reid is, I expect to see 90% pass plays 50% of
those will all be behind the line of scrimmage.  Feeley will set a new
NFL record for most sacks and Reid will appear in a press conference and
declare that he accepts full responsibity for the team.  Look for some
new and unusual ways for Reid to look stupid.

I hope the Eagles are a little more optimistic than you are, but I doubt
it.
