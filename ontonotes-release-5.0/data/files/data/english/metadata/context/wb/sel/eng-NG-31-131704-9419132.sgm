A very great pianist by anyone's standards....his grasp of the entire
keyboard was heroic,  I thought. Lucky enough to hear him live several
times, a man of real musical intelligence.

RIP indeed.

That makes me somewhat fortunate as well.  Living in Chicago allowed
me to hear this great Jazz artist a number of times.  He along with
Erroll Garner, George Shearing, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington and Count
Basie are at the top of who I listen to on a regular basis as they
tickle the ivories.  RIP.

Hi Jon,

No Art Tatum?  Chicago is a great city for music, especially for Blues
and Soul...

Of course Art Tatum...I just didn't want to make an endless list of
piano jazz greats.  I could have also mentioned Marian MacPartland &amp;
'Jelly Roll' Morton as well as a number of others.  I was very
fortunate to have sung in a concert with the Dave Brubeck Quartet at
Chicago's Grant Park festival...some decades ago...in the original
Petrillo Band Shell right in front of the Museum of Natural History.
We performed his Jazz Canta 'The Gates of Justice'...it was a great
experience.

Peterson was a pure musical joy which to watch and listen.

Hopefully Joe Morello was on drums for Brubeck I hope.  What a very
great player.  And nicked from McCartland as I understand.

Eg Thigpen, another great player, and another happy improviser for the
Peterson Trio for a while I believe.

Kind regards,

Peterson recorded a couple of LPs with the inestimable Herbie Ellis on
guitar.
He ( OP ) was a great show in his own self, but I preferred him with small
groups.
Would anyone happen to know about Peterson/Ellis CDs?
Thx,
