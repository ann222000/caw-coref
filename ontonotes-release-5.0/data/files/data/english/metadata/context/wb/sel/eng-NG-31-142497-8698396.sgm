Not reported in the MSM: What Ahmadinejad did on Monday afternoon

Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Monday afternoon met with a
group of Jewish rabbis who gave him a silver grail as a sign of
friendship. The president is currently in New York to address the
United Nations General Assembly.The rabbis carried a placard which
read, &quot;I am Jewish not a Zionist.&quot; A senior rabbi of the group said
that they considered the visit to New York of President Ahmadinejad as
an exceptional opportunity and would never forget it. He referred to
the Iranian president as a person who made a distinction between Jews
and Zionists. &quot;You understand us and make a distinction between the
violent behavior of Zionists and the religious beliefs of Jews,&quot; said
the senior rabbi who called President Ahmadinejad &quot;a pious man who is
seeking to restore peace in the world and has humanitarian plans.&quot;
Appreciating the rabbis for their gift, President Ahmadinejad said he
was happy to visit them.&quot;All people in the world have now understood
that Judaism is different from Zionism,&quot; said the president. He added,
&quot;Zionists are a political group looking for taking advantage of the
opportunities while Jews are the followers of the Moses who promoted
peace and friendship.&quot;President Ahmadinejad stressed that there was no
disagreement between the followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam
as they all pray the same God and are brothers.

The reason for ignoring these events is that it so widely viewed that
this a publicity tour. He is feeling pressure from within his country
to normalize relations with the West, and Iran-at-large wants the
various sanctions to end and they do not want to be invaded by U.S.
This is understandable. But to suggest that his propaganda is not
being reported accurately or fully is ludacrious.

I just can not understand the fascination some people have with
dictatorships. What one person views as an enemy, you may think of as
a champion or a hero. Being intellectually honest: When the U.S.
bombed Serbia (for protecting the cradle of their civilization,
Kosovo, by Albanian Muslims), I opposed the policy, but did not have
such a hatred toward Clinton as many today express toward Bush.

I often wonder how Americans can so bitterly hate the leader of their
country.

Maybe you can explain.

He's a disgraceful, dishonest, and hateful man, not any better than
Ahmadinejad.

Now, the interesting thing about this story is that Ahmadinejad knows
something that few Americans know:  Moslems don't generally hate Jews,
but they can't stand Zionists.  And the vast majority of Jews are not
Zionists.

I can give you an example of how it is that Ahmadinejad would consider
cultivating friendships among American Jews:  earlier this year, a
Zionist group in Israel offered $50,000US to any Jewish family that
would pack up and move to Israel.  There are roughly 1.5 million Jews
living in Iran.  (There were 600,000 in Saddam's Iraq, too, but it's
not certain how many have stayed in the mess of the chaotic American
occupation).

Of the 1.5 million, there were exactly no takers.
