WASHINGTON, Aug. 26, 2007 - Recent strides in Iraq's economic
development, including the reopening of a flour mill last week, are
occurring as Iraqi and coalition forces disrupt al Qaeda and other
terrorist elements, a senior military spokesman in Iraq said today.
&quot;Local production of flour in a previously dormant mill is a small but
meaningful step in Baqubah that demonstrates that as al Qaeda in Iraq
is driven out, economic growth emerges,&quot; Navy Rear Adm. Mark I. Fox,
deputy spokesman for Multinational Force Iraq, said at a news
conference.

The flour mill in Baqubah, closed for nearly a year, is capable of
producing 200 tons of finished flour per day and will employ about 100
mill workers and several truck drivers. The reopening of the mill was
the result of a collaborative partnership between the 3rd Brigade, 2nd
Infantry Division, Stryker Brigade Combat Team, and Diyala provincial
leadership, Fox said.

&quot;As we focus on pressuring al Qaeda, we gain tactical momentum and
economic developments and reconstruction are now possible,&quot; Fox added.
&quot;As al Qaeda is driven out, normal activities like banking and
commerce flourish.&quot;

Disrupting al Qaeda while trying to develop an economy and a democracy
takes a dose of diplomacy.

On the diplomatic front, the State Department's Provincial
Reconstruction Teams, interagency expeditionary teams designed to
develop stable economic and political environments at the provincial
level, are also making meaningful strides, according to the State
Department's counselor for public affairs, another featured speaker at
today's news conference.

&quot;The role of the Provincial Reconstructions Teams is to help
provincial governments develop a transparent and sustained capability
not only to govern, but to increase security, rule of law, promote
political and economic development, and provide the administration
necessary to meet the basic needs of the local population,&quot; said
Philip Reeker.

There are now 29 Provincial Reconstruction Teams at work throughout
Iraq's 18 provinces. A conference that begins tomorrow in Baghdad will
gather provincial governors from the four northern provinces, Reeker
added.

&quot;A great example of the progress we're making is the conference of
northern province governors. It is an opportunity for delegations to
share issues that affect the four northern provinces and discuss
solutions,&quot; Reeker said.

Turning to operations, Fox told the Baghdad press corps that joint
operations between coalition and Iraqi security forces have doubled
compared to this time last year. He added the total number of attacks
against civilians and security forces are at the lowest level since
August 2006.

&quot;Although we have made progress, we know we face a tough fight against
an enemy that is willing to indiscriminately kill innocent men, women
and children,&quot; Fox said. &quot;We will continue to work closely with the
government of Iraq and Iraqi security forces to pursue the enemy and
build on our tactical momentum.&quot;
