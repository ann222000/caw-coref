The more pain Turkey gets from the international community about its
past and present human rights issues, the better. I think it's more
important than particular interests within the US. I'm surprised but
gratified that US lawmakers are prepared to put human rights issues
above more parochial interests.

It's only tangentially a Jewish issue though I think, unless these
lawmakers voted the way they did because they are Jewish.

I don't think they voted for it because they're Jewish -- after all, there
is an overwhelming majority for this in the House of Reps (over 50% of the
congressmen are co-sponsors). I think that, at least in the case of good
people like Tom Lantos, there is a line in the sand that you cannot cross.
After all, if today we need to ignore the  Armenian genocide for politics,
tomorrow it may well be good politics to ignore the shoah or agree with
shoah deniers because of politics.

Just as an example, there was a time when Israel had this kind of motion,
which was quickly quashed, because the Turks were helping Israel with
matters pertaining to the Jews of Syria. So which is more important, helping
Jews today or ascertaining historical truths for posterity? I tend to go
with the truth, but I can see the immense problem.

We should allow their threatened removal of support for Israel or the US to

was no Holocaust as a condition of their support.  Phrased like that, I
would assume any ratioanl person would make the right decision.  It's only
because it's so long ago and seems so alien (Turks and Armenians) to so many
people that it's even open to debate.

I often wonder about that. I like to read about Ottoman history, and
recently, due to some reading I've done (about the way Ataturk secularized
the country) , I've begun to follow the Turkish daily press.  The Armenian
genocide took place before Turkey became a Republic, under the &quot;ancien
regime&quot;,  and while there may be legal repercussions (such as demands for
reparations, or lawsuits for lost property)  I cannot fathom why ther Turks
don't just put this behind them. It was probably more difficult for the
Nazis to admit the Holocaust. So admit it, declare it off limits for
reparations (was before our regime)  and get on with your life.

Instead, the Turks wage a constant war against  anyone who so much as
mentions it,  prosecute any Turk who so much as mentions or writes about it,
and are fighting to rewrite history in an age where it is increasingly
difficult to do so.  Recalling their ambassador from Washington  and
threatening to stop cooperation with the US over Iraq is not the adult thing
to do.

Then again, in an age when the leaders of Iran, North Korea, and Burma (not
to mention Russia)  seem to top any possible outrage, maybe the Turks are
the normal ones.

I don't pretend to be an expert on diplomacy, but I do wonder why
Congress is doing this now.  Perhaps there's another agenda?  Such
as trying to undermine Bush?

As for the issue itself, I can understand a country's leaders being
annoyed by this sort of resolution, even leaders who are well-intentioned
and not intent on denying the past.  Nobody wants outsiders to badger
them into making &quot;mea culpas&quot;, especially about events they had nothing

&gt;&gt;&gt; The more pain Turkey gets from the international community about its
&gt;&gt;&gt; past and present human rights issues, the better. I think it's more
&gt;&gt;&gt; important than particular interests within the US. I'm surprised but
&gt;&gt;&gt; gratified that US lawmakers are prepared to put human rights issues
&gt;&gt;&gt; above more parochial interests.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's only tangentially a Jewish issue though I think, unless these
&gt;&gt;&gt; lawmakers voted the way they did because they are Jewish.

&gt;&gt;I don't think they voted for it because they're Jewish -- after all, there
&gt;&gt;is an overwhelming majority for this in the House of Reps (over 50% of the
&gt;&gt;congressmen are co-sponsors). I think that, at least in the case of good
&gt;&gt;people like Tom Lantos, there is a line in the sand that you cannot cross.
&gt;&gt;After all, if today we need to ignore the  Armenian genocide for politics,
&gt;&gt;tomorrow it may well be good politics to ignore the shoah or agree with
&gt;&gt;shoah deniers because of politics.

&gt;&gt;Just as an example, there was a time when Israel had this kind of motion,
&gt;&gt;which was quickly quashed, because the Turks were helping Israel with
&gt;&gt;matters pertaining to the Jews of Syria. So which is more important,
&gt;&gt;helping
&gt;&gt;Jews today or ascertaining historical truths for posterity? I tend to go
&gt;&gt;with the truth, but I can see the immense problem.

&gt; I don't pretend to be an expert on diplomacy, but I do wonder why
&gt; Congress is doing this now.  Perhaps there's another agenda?  Such
&gt; as trying to undermine Bush?

&gt; As for the issue itself, I can understand a country's leaders being
&gt; annoyed by this sort of resolution, even leaders who are well-intentioned
&gt; and not intent on denying the past.  Nobody wants outsiders to badger
&gt; them into making &quot;mea culpas&quot;, especially about events they had nothing
&gt; to do with.  It's usually not an effective way to make progress.

I understand that twice before the House wanted to pass this. Once, Clinton
stopped them, and once Speaker Hastert refused to bring it to the floor.
This issue does not seem to be anti-Bush. Rather, it seems to be
pro-Armenian.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There are arguments on both sides, but in the end, great nations
&gt; &gt; confront
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the evils in their past.  The US has.  Germany has.  Turkey has not.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; think the Turkish *people* are ready to do so.  It is their leaders
&gt; &gt; acting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; like petulant children who cannot.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We should allow their threatened removal of support for Israel or the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; US
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be a factor.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Dan, you probably meant to say that we should NOT allow...

&gt; &gt; Indeed.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Jay

&gt; &gt;&gt; That would be like Germany insisting that we must agree there
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was no Holocaust as a condition of their support.  Phrased like that, I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would assume any ratioanl person would make the right decision.  It's
&gt; &gt; only
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because it's so long ago and seems so alien (Turks and Armenians) to so
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; many
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; people that it's even open to debate.

&gt; I often wonder about that. I like to read about Ottoman history, and
&gt; recently, due to some reading I've done (about the way Ataturk secularized
&gt; the country) , I've begun to follow the Turkish daily press.  The Armenian
&gt; genocide took place before Turkey became a Republic, under the &quot;ancien
&gt; regime&quot;,  and while there may be legal repercussions (such as demands for
&gt; reparations, or lawsuits for lost property)  I cannot fathom why ther Turks
&gt; don't just put this behind them. It was probably more difficult for the
&gt; Nazis to admit the Holocaust. So admit it, declare it off limits for
&gt; reparations (was before our regime)  and get on with your life.
">

The big difference is that the Germans were &quot;caught in the act&quot; so to
speak and had to deal publicly with the immediate consequences rather
than letting the facts and the memories be filtered by time and
distance prior to coming to grips with it.  Look at the problems that
Japan is having in dealing with the use of Korean women as forced
prostitutes for their soldiers during WW2... They were allowed to let
it lie for so many decades that it's much harder to deal with it
properly now. Also, Turkey isn't dealing with it from the POV of a
totally defeated and occupied nation, forced to face facts and come to
grips with them.  Their current position is much more akin to the US
position vis a-vis the internment of Japanese-Americans.  Look how
long it took to get any sort of recompense and an official apology
from the US government for what we did to them...

Everyone posts on subjects he likes or finds important. I don't think I'm
unique in this regard.

Glance at some of the stuff posted in this ng in the last 72 hours. I'm sure
you'll find some right wing nuts.

I am tired of posting news articles about haredim and other Israeli subjects
and being labeled anti-haredi even if the article is neutral, or when I have
not expressed an opinion other than to post the item.  More than one poster
here has publicly labeled me erroneously because of a quote, or a header,
without bothering to even glance at the story.

If you're one of those people, I would welcome your killfiling me and saving
us both the headaches.  If you are a fair minded person who can judge others
(if you must) based on what they say or express, and not merely by the
subject they post, then I welcome your comments and perhaps we can have a
fruitful dialogue such as I have had with many good people here.

As to WANTING to be killfiled -- do you know of a lot of people who post to
groups HOPING that their posts will not be read by anyone because everybody
has already killfiled them ?

True, and I'm not meaning to use it as an excuse -- just an
explanation of why it's taken so long.  And let's not forget that even
with our free press and court system, it took decades to get the
internment issues resolved.  Different social systems will make a huge
difference in how a society deals with unpleasant facts from its
history.  The old Soviet Union dealt with them by making the people -
and all references to them in books and magazines -- disappear. Japan
deals with them by simple denial and a society that doesn't refer to
such things in public. I'm not familiar enough with the social system
in Turkey to even guess as to what's interfering with the acceptance
of reality and dealing with it.

Well, no, not really, not with that intention.  There are, however,
those in the unmoderated groups who purposefully troll the NG, knowing
they will be kill-filed, so they can change their nym to creep out of
said killfiles and continue to troll away.  Susan and I both know them
all too well.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I often wonder about that. I like to read about Ottoman history, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recently, due to some reading I've done (about the way Ataturk
&gt;&gt; secularized
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the country) , I've begun to follow the Turkish daily press.  The
&gt;&gt; Armenian
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; genocide took place before Turkey became a Republic, under the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ancien
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; regime&quot;,  and while there may be legal repercussions (such as demands
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reparations, or lawsuits for lost property)  I cannot fathom why ther
&gt;&gt; Turks
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; don't just put this behind them. It was probably more difficult for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nazis to admit the Holocaust. So admit it, declare it off limits for
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reparations (was before our regime)  and get on with your life.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The big difference is that the Germans were &quot;caught in the act&quot; so to
&gt;&gt; &gt; speak and had to deal publicly with the immediate consequences rather
&gt;&gt; &gt; than letting the facts and the memories be filtered by time and
&gt;&gt; &gt; distance prior to coming to grips with it.  Look at the problems that
&gt;&gt; &gt; Japan is having in dealing with the use of Korean women as forced
&gt;&gt; &gt; prostitutes for their soldiers during WW2... They were allowed to let
&gt;&gt; &gt; it lie for so many decades that it's much harder to deal with it
&gt;&gt; &gt; properly now. Also, Turkey isn't dealing with it from the POV of a
&gt;&gt; &gt; totally defeated and occupied nation, forced to face facts and come to
&gt;&gt; &gt; grips with them.  Their current position is much more akin to the US
&gt;&gt; &gt; position vis a-vis the internment of Japanese-Americans.  Look how
&gt;&gt; &gt; long it took to get any sort of recompense and an official apology
&gt;&gt; &gt; from the US government for what we did to them...

&gt;&gt; True, but it's a difference, not an excuse.  Look at how we DID finally
&gt;&gt; address the crime of Japanese-American internment, wheras look at how
&gt;&gt; Japan
&gt;&gt; is still castigated for refusing to deal with their crimes towards Korea.

&gt; True, and I'm not meaning to use it as an excuse -- just an
&gt; explanation of why it's taken so long.  And let's not forget that even
&gt; with our free press and court system, it took decades to get the
&gt; internment issues resolved.  Different social systems will make a huge
&gt; difference in how a society deals with unpleasant facts from its
&gt; history.  The old Soviet Union dealt with them by making the people -
&gt; and all references to them in books and magazines -- disappear. Japan
&gt; deals with them by simple denial and a society that doesn't refer to
&gt; such things in public. I'm not familiar enough with the social system
&gt; in Turkey to even guess as to what's interfering with the acceptance
&gt; of reality and dealing with it.

&gt; Eliyahu
">

To the best of my knowledge, what's interfering is education. These people
have had it drummed into their heads, since 1923, that the Armenian genocide
never happened. That's what they learn in school, and it is against the law
to refer to it in writing, in the press, etc. Orhan Pamuk, the Nobel Prize
winner, is a Turkish author who referred to it and was almost jailed.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4205708.stm

Imagine a school system where a holocaust denier is allowed free rein. The
kids have no access to a free press or &quot;forbidden&quot; books until they are much
older, and then they have to access the material in stealth. Referring to
the holocaust is considered a crime. How many generations of school children
would it take until the population at large &quot;knows&quot;  that the holocaust
never happened?

Just about all sources, including Congress and the Supreme
Court, have agreed it was a crime.  It seems that the real
motive was to grab their land.

Those of Japanese descent on Hawaii were not interned, and
Hawaii was the center of the Pacific Fleet then as now,
and had a greater Japanese-related population, at all levels,
than any part of the continental US.

I'm primarily interested in the logic here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It was a crime.  Your prejudiced suspicions are baseless.  In fact, the
&gt;Japanese-American soldiers were among the most decorated of our troops.
">

You say &quot;In fact&quot; as if this contradicts his suspicions.  Plainly,
when several people are involved, some could be among the most
decorated troops and some others could be disloyal.

When Bush wanted to contract management of American ports to Dubai,
the reason he said it was ok was that Dubai was our ally.  But
Americans understood how that proved nothing, that even though some
Dubains might be our allies, others might be the opposite. Do you
think GWB was correct in what he said?

Someone else in the White House must have also thought his words were
not reasonable, because just a week or two later he flew to Pakistan
and Afghanistan, landing in the middle of the night in both places for
security reasons.  Even though both countries were allies of the US,
at least those running his schedule didn't assume that everyone in
those countries were also our allies.

And is it really prejudice to imagine that *some* Japanese would have
greater loyalties to the home of their ancestors than to where they
happen to be living now, where they may have moved only for financial
reasons.  To be prejudice, wouldn't Abe have to feel differently about
those from other countries, and we know he thinks some
German-Americans should have been interned.

I would expect loyalty to one's original country from at least some
people of ANY country in the world, living in any other country of the
world.  So it's clearly not prejudice on my part.  It's a difference
in my attitude about people, and how people work.

When Diane Fosse or someone moves to Africa and spends 20 years there,
do you think she has abandoned her loyalty to the US?  Or Albert
Schweitzer or Louis? Leakey to the UK or US, whereever he was from?
Or Che Guevara who lived for a decade or 2 in Coloumbia iirc, did he
give up his loyalty to Cuba?   Or Branson of Virgin Airlines: He's
lived in the US for a long time, has he abandoned his loyalty to the
UK?   Or all the Canadians who live here and are citizens.  Do you
think none would spy for Canada if they were in a position to and
there was a serious dispute between us and the Canadians?

And a lot of spying doesn't require cloak and dagger.  It can be as
little as keeping one's eyes open, watching construction at harbors,
or on government-owned land, noting when army convoys drive through
town, how many vehicles, what are on any flatbed trucks.  Etc.

And I would say the same thing about the children and grandchildren of
the people of any country living in any other country.   Which
particular people would be more loyal to the original country would
depend on how they were raised and how they were treated in the new
country.

I think Abe would have settled for rounding up the Bund members, not
everyone of German descent.  You too must think they were more likely
to be disloyal than Japanese who hadn't done anything to support one
of the US's enemies, or even to support a policy such as active
aggressive antisemitism that was unique to those we were at war with.

There are more German-Americans than any other kind. There were tens?
of millions of Italian-Americans too. If we had been in a serious war
with Portugal OTOH, do you think we would not have interned Portuguese
Americans?

AIUI, the US did do something to Italian-Americans during the war, but
it was a short reference, less than a sentence, and I don't even
remember that.  Does anyone know or have the time to look it up?
