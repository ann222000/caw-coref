The Rights of Animals
October 11, 2006 09:00 AM EST

According to MSNBC, in a May 2005 Senate hearing, John Lewis, the FBI's
deputy assistant director for counterterrorism, asserted that "environmental
and animal rights extremists who have turned to arson and explosives are the
nation's top domestic terrorism threat...Groups such as the Animal
Liberation Front, the Earth Liberation Front and the Britain-based SHAC, or
Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, are 'way out in front' in terms of damage
and number of crimes ..." Lewis averred that "...(t)here is nothing else
going on in this country over the last several years that is racking up the
high number of violent crimes and terrorist actions".

MSNBC notes that "(t)he Animal Liberation Front says on its Web site that
its small, autonomous groups of people take 'direct action' against animal
abuse by rescuing animals and causing financial loss to animal exploiters,
usually through damage and destruction of property."

"Animal rights" is a catchphrase akin to "human rights". It involves,
however, a few pitfalls. First, animals exist only as a concept. Otherwise,
they are cuddly cats, curly dogs, cute monkeys. A rat and a puppy are both
animals but our emotional reaction to them is so different that we cannot
really lump them together. Moreover: what rights are we talking about? The
right to life? The right to be free of pain? The right to food? Except the
right to free speech - all other rights could be applied to animals.

Law professor Steven Wise, argues in his book, "Drawing the Line: Science
and the Case for Animal Rights", for the extension to animals of legal
rights accorded to infants. Many animal species exhibit awareness,
cognizance and communication skills typical of human toddlers and of humans
with arrested development. Yet, the latter enjoy rights denied the former.

According to Wise, there are four categories of practical autonomy - a legal
standard for granting "personhood" and the rights it entails. Practical
autonomy involves the ability to be desirous, to intend to fulfill and
pursue one's desires, a sense of self-awareness, and self-sufficiency. Most
animals, says Wise, qualify. This may be going too far. It is easier to
justify the moral rights of animals than their legal rights.

But when we say "animals", what we really mean is non-human organisms. This
is such a wide definition that it easily pertains to extraterrestrial
aliens. Will we witness an Alien Rights movement soon? Unlikely. Thus, we
are forced to narrow our field of enquiry to non-human organisms reminiscent
of humans, the ones that provoke in us empathy.

Even this is way too fuzzy. Many people love snakes, for instance, and
deeply empathize with them. Could we accept the assertion (avidly propounded
by these people) that snakes ought to have rights - or should we consider
only organisms with extremities and the ability to feel pain?

Historically, philosophers like Kant (and Descartes, Malebranche, and
Aquinas) rejected the idea of animal rights. They regarded animals as the
organic equivalents of machines, driven by coarse instincts, unable to
experience pain (though their behavior sometimes deceives us into
erroneously believing that they do).

Thus, any ethical obligation that we have towards animals is a derivative of
our primary obligation towards our fellow humans (the only ones possessed of
moral significance). These are called the theories of indirect moral
obligations. Thus, it is wrong to torture animals only because it
desensitizes us to human suffering and makes us more prone to using violence
on humans. Malebranche augmented this line of thinking by "proving" that
animals cannot suffer pain because they are not descended from Adam. Pain
and suffering, as we all know, are the exclusive outcomes of Adam's sins.

Kant and Malebranche may have been wrong. Animals may be able to suffer and
agonize. But how can we tell whether another Being is truly suffering pain
or not? Through empathy. We postulate that - since that Being resembles us -
it must have the same experiences and, therefore, it deserves our pity.

Yet, the principle of resemblance has many drawbacks.

One, it leads to moral relativism.

Consider this maxim from the Jewish Talmud: "Do not do unto thy friend that
which you hate". An analysis of this sentence renders it less altruistic
than it appears. We are encouraged to refrain from doing only those things
that WE find hateful. This is the quiddity of moral relativism.

The saying implies that it is the individual who is the source of moral
authority. Each and every one of us is allowed to spin his own moral system,
independent of others. The Talmudic dictum establishes a privileged moral
club (very similar to later day social contractarianism) comprised of
oneself and one's friend(s). One is encouraged not to visit evil upon one's
friends, all others seemingly excluded. Even the broadest interpretation of
the word "friend" could only read: "someone like you" and substantially
excludes strangers.

Two, similarity is a structural, not an essential, trait.

Empathy as a differentiating principle is structural: if X looks like me and
behaves like me - then he is privileged. Moreover, similarity is not
necessarily identity. Monkeys, dogs and dolphins are very much like us, both
structurally and behaviorally. Even according to Wise, it is quantity (the
degree of observed resemblance), not quality (identity, essence), that is
used in determining whether an animal is worthy of holding rights, whether
is it a morally significant person. The degree of figurative and functional
likenesses decide whether one deserves to live, pain-free and happy.

The quantitative test includes the ability to communicate (manipulate
vocal-verbal-written symbols within structured symbol systems). Yet, we
ignore the fact that using the same symbols does not guarantee that we
attach to them the same cognitive interpretations and the same emotional
resonance ('private languages"). The same words, or symbols, often have
different meanings.

Meaning is dependent upon historical, cultural, and personal contexts. There
is no telling whether two people mean the same things when they say "red",
or "sad", or "I", or "love". That another organism looks like us, behaves
like us and communicates like us is no guarantee that it is - in its essence
- like us. This is the subject of the famous Turing Test: there is no
effective way to distinguish a machine from a human when we rely exclusively
on symbol manipulation.

Consider pain once more.

To say that something does not experience pain cannot be rigorously
defended. Pain is a subjective experience. There is no way to prove or to
disprove that someone is or is not in pain. Here, we can rely only on the
subject's reports. Moreover, even if we were to have an analgometer (pain
gauge), there would have been no way to show that the phenomenon that
activates the meter is one and the same for all subjects, SUBJECTIVELY,
i.e., that it is experienced in the same way by all the subjects examined.

Even more basic questions regarding pain are impossible to answer: What is
the connection between the piercing needle and the pain REPORTED and between
these two and electrochemical patterns of activity in the brain? A
correlation between these three phenomena can be established - but not their
identity or the existence of a causative process. We cannot prove that the
waves in the subject's brain when he reports pain - ARE that pain. Nor can
we show that they CAUSED the pain, or that the pain caused them.

It is also not clear whether our moral percepts are conditioned on the
objective existence of pain, on the reported existence of pain, on the
purported existence of pain (whether experienced or not, whether reported or
not), or on some independent laws.

If it were painless, would it be moral to torture someone? Is the very act
of sticking needles into someone immoral - or is it immoral because of the
pain it causes, or supposed to inflict? Are all three components (needle
sticking, a sensation of pain, brain activity) morally equivalent? If so, is
it as immoral to merely generate the same patterns of brain activity,
without inducing any sensation of pain and without sticking needles in the
subject?

If these three phenomena are not morally equivalent - why aren't they? They
are, after all, different facets of the very same pain - shouldn't we
condemn all of them equally? Or should one aspect of pain (the subject's
report of pain) be accorded a privileged treatment and status?

Yet, the subject's report is the weakest proof of pain! It cannot be
verified. And if we cling to this descriptive-behavioural-phenomenological
definition of pain than animals qualify as well. They also exhibit all the
behaviours normally ascribed to humans in pain and they report feeling pain
(though they do tend to use a more limited and non-verbal vocabulary).

Pain is, therefore, a value judgment and the reaction to it is culturally
dependent. In some cases, pain is perceived as positive and is sought. In
the Aztec cultures, being chosen to be sacrificed to the Gods was a high
honour. How would we judge animal rights in such historical and cultural
contexts? Are there any "universal" values or does it all really depend on
interpretation?

If we, humans, cannot separate the objective from the subjective and the
cultural - what gives us the right or ability to decide for other organisms?
We have no way of knowing whether pigs suffer pain. We cannot decide right
and wrong, good and evil for those with whom we can communicate, let alone
for organisms with which we fail to do even this.

Is it GENERALLY immoral to kill, to torture, to pain? The answer seems
obvious and it automatically applies to animals. Is it generally immoral to
destroy? Yes, it is and this answer pertains to the inanimate as well. There
are exceptions: it is permissible to kill and to inflict pain in order to
prevent a (quantitatively or qualitatively) greater evil, to protect life,
and when no reasonable and feasible alternative is available.

The chain of food in nature is morally neutral and so are death and disease.
Any act which is intended to sustain life of a higher order (and a higher
order in life) - is morally positive or, at least neutral. Nature decreed
so. Animals do it to other animals - though, admittedly, they optimize their
consumption and avoid waste and unnecessary pain. Waste and pain are morally
wrong. This is not a question of hierarchy of more or less important Beings
(an outcome of the fallacy of anthropomorphesizing Nature).

The distinction between what is (essentially) US - and what just looks and
behaves like us (but is NOT us) is false, superfluous and superficial.
Sociobiology is already blurring these lines. Quantum Mechanics has taught
us that we can say nothing about what the world really IS. If things look
the same and behave the same, we better assume that they are the same.

The attempt to claim that moral responsibility is reserved to the human
species is self defeating. If it is so, then we definitely have a moral
obligation towards the weaker and meeker. If it isn't, what right do we have
to decide who shall live and who shall die (in pain)?

The increasingly shaky "fact" that species do not interbreed "proves" that
species are distinct, say some. But who can deny that we share most of our
genetic material with the fly and the mouse? We are not as dissimilar as we
wish we were. And ever-escalating cruelty towards other species will not
establish our genetic supremacy - merely our moral inferiority.
