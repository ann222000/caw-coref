Inca S-iritual Messenger, Willaru Huayta
A lecture given in Peru, September, 1997

THIS IS A SMALL PART OF A TRANSCRIPTION OF LECTURES GIVEN BY WILLARU AND
TRANSLATED BY ALUNA JOY YAXKIN DURING HER VISIT TO PERU  SEPTEMBER 1997.

The masters sent me to the U-ited States three times. When I finished my
last trip I said, &quot;Oh, finally, I finished my mission&quot;. But that was my ego
talking. When I got home, there came another invitation to the U-A. I said
&quot;What do I do with this? I thought I would have to say no, because I have
already finished the three trips. So I went into meditation and I said to
the m-sters. &quot;I have already finished my trips. What can I do with these
letters. I'm not supposed to go to any more countries in the world.&quot; But the
ma-ters said, that sometimes we have to keep going once we have started. The
three trips were a test. Along the way were many, many tests. I worked with
temptation with many different things. Like food, cheeseburgers, hamburgers,
banana splits, good American food. I had to come to my inner Father/Mother
to really work hard to receive help in these and other things. But at the
end it was good, because my Father/Mother was always helping me.

When I came back from the US-, I said, &quot;Now I don't want to travel
anyplace
on planet Earth. Now I will p-ay to go to the other planets. But I was too
greedy and too ambitious. I am a simple student, who's just beginning. All
my desires are just ego. Only great mas-ers can be taken to other planets
for interplanetary initiations. But I started working hard to go to the
planet Venus. I was eating less meat and all that. I worked a lot with the
three steps. I asked them (Venusians) to give me the opportunity to see. I
didn't want to go to stay there, because my work is not on Venus. What can I
do there? They don't need me there. I have to finish my work here on this
planet Earth, not on Venus. This is very important. I only wanted to know,
to experience Venus, to compare that civilization with our civilization
here. I wanted to bring a little bit of insight for humanity, a little bit.
So a test was given.

First Impression of Venus... After going past the astral plane, I arrived
on
Venus at a sea port. Many cosmic ships were there in the ocean. It was very,
very alive, like in the sixth dimension. Everything has life, brilliant
vibration, very, very delicious life. You feel good. Your sp-ritual body
feels really good. It feels like home. It is something that I do not feel
here on Earth. But when I got there, they were waiting for me, the celestial
marines. All the boys there were young, because they live eternal life. They
have a physical body like us, but live eternal life. They are very young
looking, like the age 22, wearing white uniforms like American Marines. They
have a blue light, a celestial cape over them. It was very, very nice when I
got there. I said &quot;Wow&quot;! I got very emotional. &quot;Wow&quot;! &quot;Finally I'm here&quot;!
But it was no good, because it was an inferior type of happiness. So I
didn't pass the test of the emotional body. I looked to them like a monkey
you give a banana to and they jump with happiness. (Willaru jumps around the
room to demonstrates how an excited monkey looks) Something like that. (The
group breaks out in laughter) My happiness was still a little bit of an
animal nature, but which is natural on planet Earth, being human. They (the
Venusians) understand this, so they showed me a little bit more.

Go-ernment... The first thing, there is no gov-rnment. There are no
palaces
or gover-ment buildings like the W-ite House, embassies, ministries or
anything like that. They have no p-esident. Everyone is their own
govern-ent. There are no separate countries. Planet Venus is one country.
There are no passports, separate flags, separate nationalities, frontiers,
borders, all these things. They do not have courts because they are their
own judges, their own governm-nt, their own lawyers, even their own
architects, everything. They have liberated their consciousness from all
that. There is no monetary system either. They work for the Father/Mother to
build their temple of the Father (points to the mind) and to build the
temple of the Mother (points to the heart). Wherever they go, they are home.
There is no division between them. Everybody is the a-my, because everyone
is guardian of the planet. There's no Court of Justice there, because
there's no ego. Nobody has ego. If there is ego, of course, there is karma.
If there's karma, then there are the police, there are judges, and jails.
They don't know those things. They have liberated their consciousness a long
time ago, and they don't need it. They have no weapons, like machine guns,
tanks, airplanes to f-ght or attack. That is based in fear, and fear is ego.
They have finished a long time ago with this.

Most of the people on planet Earth say &quot;Perfect c-mmunist doesn't exist&quot;.
But on Venus they say, &quot;To have perfect co-munism, we have to eliminate the
egos&quot;. So you see they don't need any pol-tical parties to take
responsibility for all the material things. The only question is the action
of the consciousness. Everyone on Venus is rich spi-itually. It was only
with the elimination of the egos that they became the perfect society.
There's no fi-hting present because everybody is their own governm-nt.
Everybody speaks only a little bit, but also every one knows they are
mas-ers with different perspectives.

The Venusians... They are intelligent. They have created a solar system in
their brain. It is different than ours. It is more intelligent and has a
larger capacity and is wiser, enlightened, and a higher vibration. They have
an aura of love, because all the egos have been transmuted. You know that to
be an alchemist brings much privilege. This is why they have a lot of
electricity. They can fly also, of course, because they have total control
over their vital body, astral body, mental body, causal body and their
physical body. They are authentic man with all their faculties and powers.
We can call this the kingdom of the supermen. They still have a little of
the animal in them, but there is a difference. They are authentic man.

RE-IGION... The rel-gion is the same as light. It is the light of the
life,
of the universal cosmic C-rist. They see that light everywhere, in the
Father/Mother, in the s-xual energy. Even when they see the most beautiful
woman, they have another mentality, not erotic, like the people on planet
Earth. When we see a very attractive girl.... we are a little bit like an
animal, you know. But on Venus there is much respect, a respect based in
consciousness. This is very important to understand, because life is
everywhere, the universal cosmic Ch-ist. The light of the Creation, this is
their reli-ion. Relig-on for them is to be united with the Father/Mother,
and to be always in the inner temple. So, they don't need any organized
religi-n. Their life is more solar cosmic universal culture, the culture of
Go-s. Everyone has all their faculties and powers. They have intuition and
tel-pathic communication. They have the faculties of clairaudiance and
clairvoyance. They don't speak so much, like we do here.

Their planet is ruled only by 24 laws, not as many laws as on Earth. It is
governed by less laws because they have liberated their consciousness
totally. Their religio- is the three steps of r-volution of consciousness.
The first step is the elimination of the ego. Although they don't have ego,
they still have the root of ego and they are aware of this all the time.
They are always cleansing themselves. Their mind is illuminated. Their mind
is in service to the Father/Mother, not in the service of the ego anymore.

In the second step, every marriage on Venus is based in alchemy. All the
marriages are conscious. There is no d-vorce there, because they are with
the Father/Mother. They don't experience those things over there. Everybody
knows how to make love. This is the biggest step. A long time ago the
Venusians used to live like we do on the planet Earth, but they have grown
up psychologically. Only a few people at first began working with the three
steps and then there were more, more, more, more, and then at the end,
everybody was taking these three steps. Soon everybody was an alchemist.
That's why they have skin that is very transparent, shining like a baby's,
because they have never wasted their (sexual) energy. (The third step is
sacred service and unconditional love).

JW  Don't be surprised if you go to Venus in the third dimension like we
are
now living in, you might just see a bunch of rocks and land like we have on
Earth in the very driest of deserts.

This talks about the third, fourth and fifth dimensions.

........................................................................... .

On Medicine... Everyone is a doctor also, a medicine man. And as they
walk,
they h-al their planet. Everyone is a mas-er, and they say &quot;My physical body
is not my m-ster. My Father is my master&quot;. They are very humble. They are
very simple. They have no negative ego. &quot;My Father is the one who knows, I
am serving my Father, so I am an eternal servant of my Father/Mother. He/she
is the one who is the ma-ter, not me&quot;. They have no pride. They do not show
off. There are no universities, like we have University of Miami, University
of London etc. They say these universities are mental only, &quot;Poor people,
they suffer so much to learn a little bit, and still it is not useful&quot;. It
is not complete. There are d-ctors on Earth that don't know how to he-l.
Everybody on Venus is a medicine man. They don't need any medicine, because
they ARE medicine. Of course, they eat the three foods, the organic foods,
food from the air, also food from the impressions of the life, the Cosmic
C-rist which is there. They radiate with the hands of light, which comes
from their Father/Mother that are connected to the superior dimensions. They
can hea- any kind of illness. So in their sp-ritual path, they don't have to
go to a doctor. As they grow, they are given all the faculties, even to -eal
the blind, the deaf, and c-ncer. But there is no illness and there are no
hospitals. There's no contamination, because they never use any g-soline, or
electricity, or petroleum like on the planet Earth. They have everything
there, but they use solar energy. So this is a totally different system.

Birth control and family... They know how to make love, so it is not
necessary to be taking all those pills, or to use c-ndoms to control the
population. These are for when we are not civilized. They know how to make
love in the h-ly way, in the sacred spir-tual way. They ask the inner Mother
not to have a baby. They ask to have a spiri-ual baby. That's the most
important, not the physical baby. If they want a baby, a physical baby, they
ask the inner Mother to have a physical baby and then the physical baby
comes. They ask the great mas-er who's in charge of the ray of creation,
who's giving that baby the spirit-al essence, to connect in the moment to
conceive the baby. They don't know a-ortion.

On Earth's modern technology... I asked, &quot;What about the technology on the
planet Earth with their machines, computers, airplanes and other
technology?&quot; One ma-ter said to me &quot;The technology on the planet Earth is
mentally retarded technology. You think you are civilized. You think you are
on top of the world. What are you thinking when you make trips to the moon?
This is a violation of cosmic law. When beings live in the sp-ritual
culture, as they grow in the initiations, they are given the keys, the
se-rets, to make their own cosmic ships, but this technology is only learned
in the s-iritual culture. Interplanetary trips that are made are ho-y and
totally s-cred. In this way we shall travel. Everybody can travel in the
universe. But traveling on only a mental/intellectual level is dangerous.
That's all they said.

Cosmic Ships... They can make cosmic ships and there's a big, mother ship,
very, very giant. There they have no weapons like tanks, machine g-ns,
airplanes to attack or a-omic bombs or anything like this because they say
it is not necessary. They know another way to control, a superior way. They
are the kingdom of the supermen. They are G-ds and the Go-desses. They have
a better way to control because they know electromagnetic science. The only
weapon they have is a little spray. When they spray a little bit, for
example before landing in New York, let's say, only with a little spray they
can paralyze all of New York State, even many states, three, four states. It
paralyzes all machines, all the human beings without k-lling, without making
damage to the machines, without making any noises, or without destroying
anything, buildings or anything, paralyzes everything. In that moment they
can control everything. Anytime if they want, they can take over the planet
Earth. They don't do it, because if they do, they will lose their
initiation. Why would they lose their initiation? Because they will be
violating the law of free will. We fight all these w-rs with each other
among countries. This is our free will. This is our reality. We cannot
complain, because we want the easy life. The easy life is not meditating,
not practicing the sp-ritual culture. We want to dominate the material first
before the sp-rit. It doesn't work that way. We need to be spir-tual first,
then dominate the material.

Control of nature and the material worlds... This is the way they work to
dominate nature. They are the kings and queens, so like a king they dominate
nature. Whenever they want rain, they make it rain. Whenever they want it
cloudy, they make it cloudy. Whenever they want it sunny, they put away the
clouds and then it is sunny. They live in the Fourth Dimension. In the
ancient times their planet used to be a Third Dimensional world and the
Fourth Dimensional world. These two are in the physical. The Third
Dimensional world is the subconscious, because it is not a conscious world.
Now many conscious people are living in paradise on this planet Earth. There
are some mas-ers already living consciously in this Third Dimension. Most of
the conscious people are in the Fourth Dimension. On Venus they have united,
they have become one. They are living in paradise, so it is protected. It's
an enchanted planet, almost un-touchable, because it is ruled by less laws.
If they come here it is because they want to share wisdom. They want to give
a message, a warning to humanity, to show us another way.

There are other civilizations, more developed, more enlightened, in the
spi-itual path. it is very important to know their life, to compare our
civilization with the civilizations of other planets in this solar system.
They feel sorry for us because we are not growing enough, but they are also
very glad because we are working. We are understanding little by little.
Their guidance says not to look for connection with ETs, because sometimes
when we invoke this, we want to be taken, not to come back and that's no
good, because we are running away from our responsibilities. We have done
almost no work here, and we want to be s-ved. That doesn't work. Also from
the other solar systems comes negative entities, cosmic ships, etc. The gray
men don't come from other planets. They come from the planet Earth. There is
the Fourth Dimension light side and the Fourth Dimension dark side. In the
dark side are living those gray people. Humanity believes that they come
from other planets. Also in our planet, living in the dark side are other
kinds of m-nsters, and big animals also. Dimension by dimension there is
life, different forms of life. Only in the Third Dimension and the Fourth
Dimension can we live with a physical body. To go to the other dimensions,
fifth, sixth, and seventh, we need other bodies, astral body, mental body,
causal body, a-omic body, and other bodies. (end)

Subject: What Is A Sun Cruiser?                                   Aug. 20,
2007.

I will have to admit that the Sun Cruiser sounds like a name you would
put on a 1950 Ford Convertable, but that is not what we are talking about in
this case.  On with the explanation.

Lady Kadjina August 6, 2000
Wayne: Based upon some information I had gathered from various sources
that
seemed to link recent photos of what has been described as a Sun Cruiser
with
a crop circle that appeared to resemble the same shape, I had asked Lady
Kadjina to see if she could pick up anything related to the Sun Cruiser.
This
morning Kay began verbalizing to me the initial results of a remote viewing
experience with the Sun Cruiser, among other things, and we decided that it
would be best if I transcribed the information she was getting, as it is
easy
to forget the details and put things off. This seemed like very relevant and
important information to let slip by, so we have spent the last couple of
hours
in a transcription and question-answer mode. Here are the results of the
first
visit.
Lady Kadjina:
First of all, I want to explain something to you, that it is Kay and her
consciousness that desired to remote view the Sun Cruiser. I am here at this
time only to jar her memory and make this communication as clear as
possible.
Part of her training has been to think for herself and to use her skills and
abilities that have been acquired over the many centuries of our
association.
Therefore, this report is going to be a dual effort on both of our parts.
Kay:
I first became aware of the Sun Cruiser on a website that showed a series
of
photographs and then later I saw a crop circle that Wayne had shown me that
he
felt was a diagram of the Sun Cruiser when compared to an earlier version of
a previously-posted photo of what was purported to be the Sun Cruiser. When
I
showed this information to my friend Sean, he exclaimed enthusiastically Oh
my
G-d, we’re going home! I could sense his elation and felt that a great
discovery
had been made.
I also want to explain at this point my work with remote viewing. Some
years
ago, I was asked by my friend Larry, who believed in my ability to remote
view,
to see what I could find out about the comet Hale-Bopp and to find out any
information of any asteroids or objects around and about it. When I did
this,
I saw what I have come to call Tetros.
Tetros, I was told, is a dead planet four times the size of Earth. It has
been
refurbished to serve as a great ship. It is powered from within rather than
powered from some external source. It is divided into 4 quadrants with
atmosphere and topography and geophysical aspects very much like planet
Earth. I
was taken on tour of this great ship by a Captian who calls himself La
Quido. He
showed me many technologies that will soon be given to earth. In fact, some
of
them have already been offered and rejected, the fear being that it would
shut
down certain industries. Some of these were new fuels and energies and
medical
devices that could bring about instant cures. These were rejected. There was
much more given at that time but the point of this all is that Larry already
had
access to information given through Courtney Brown and his group of remote
viewers. I had been given all of the information that they had attained, and
additional information as well, some of which was affirmed by these remote
viewers in future sessions.
When I first attempted to approach the Sun Cruiser, I was stopped by a
guard
at a gate, for lack of a better word, that was an entranceway through an
energy
field placed around the Sun to prevent intrusions by remote viewers such as
myself as well as other forms of energies that might not be of good and
peaceful intent. I stated my purpose as being desirous of knowing further
information about the Sun Cruiser. I explained the crop circle and certain
photographs and asked if there were any way that I could do this work. I was
then escorted into something similar to a guard shack that we have at the
entrances to our factories. Other beings were then summoned who began to
question me as to my motives. The chief interrogator had a name that I
will try to spell phonetically: Shan-ush-karah (that’s the best I can do).
He
told me, after speaking with me a few moments, that he was very proficient
at
reading my fields of energy in order to determine the real essences of who
and
what I am. He told me that I was guileless. I understood this to mean
without
agenda. He then asked me to tell him in my own words who I am and by what
authority I might make my request. I told him of my long association with
planet
Earth and my ways of service to the people of Earth. I spoke to him of my
love
for Lady Gaia and how through my service I had made many friends in many
places.
He responded, I can read that so clearly within you. I also stated that,
since
the crop circle had been manifested and the Sun Cruiser had been
photographed,
that it was reasonable to assume that information would be forthcoming. I
also
spoke to him of my association with Lord Michael, whom he knew, and that
Michael
had told me two things which I revealed to him. First, that I was a jewel in
the eye of Go-, and second, that I was to Planet Earth like unto a key
energy. I also spoke of my association with the Mar-ek group, to which he
responded, Who? I said, that is the best I can do with that name, as my
language does not have all the sounds available, but this group is named
after
the second brightest star in the bowl of the big dipper, to which he
explained, Oh, you mean and proceeded to pronounce the name that I could
not.
He then said, You are referring to the Council of Twenty-Four and I said,
That is correct. He informed me that he would present this information to
see
if approval might be obtained for me to enter into a deeper remote viewing
of
this area.
