Do you agree or disagree and if so why with the following from a new
book "The wages of Destruction by Adam Tooze" p602.

"...by contrast with the Ruhr, which was Germany's chief supplier of the
most basic inputs of coal and steel. Shutting down the Ruhr and the
transport links that connected it to the rest of Germany had the
potential to disrupt production throughout the entire country. The
repeated raids on the Ruhr in 1943 had exacted a terrible toll from RAF
Bomber Command. Nearly 4,000 crew were killed or taken prisoner, and 640
bombers were shot down or crashed. Terrible as this attrition was,
however, thanks to the mounting output of the British aircraft
factories, the RAF's bomber strength actually increased between February
and August T943. The Ruhr was the choke point and in 1943 it was within
the RAF's grip. The failure to maintain that hold and to tighten it was
a tragic operational error. The ongoing disaster that Speer and his
cohorts clearly expected in the summer of 1943 was put off for another
year."

Difficult to disagree with very much of the extract. But the issue is
whether the RAF deliberately eased up on the Ruhr towards the end of
1943 in favour of other targets, or whether it simply could not mount
and sustain the level of effort (and bombing accuracy)required to
obliterate German production capacity in the area. I do not recall
reading anywhere that there was a change of tactics in late 1943 to
divert RAF effort from the Ruhr; on the other hand, 3cm radar (H2S)
which enabled greater bombing accuracy only became available from
November 1943. So it was not so much a "failure" or "error" here as much
as a lack of technology and tools.

First thing, it's not as if Bomber Command suddenly ceased taking losses in
the second half of 1943. It took plenty of losses, so that is and wasn't
reason to stop that series of raids.

The Hamburg series was reasonably justified. The switch to Berlin, not so,
for a variety of reasons. Of course we can judge that from our comfortable
hindsight positions.

A continuation of the Ruhr raids in the second half of 1943 would probably
not have been as decisive as this short excerpt seems to indicate, however.
The effectiveness of the raids was bound to diminish in the autumn and
winter, when compared to summer, regardless of the target area chosen,
because of two reasons Bomber Command could do little about: the weather and
the see-saw nature of the EM-ECM-ECCM war, which was headed, briefly, for
the German side.

There are other factors that would make a continuation of that strategy less
effective.
If you keep hitting the same area, you become predictable - allowing the
enemy an ideal set-up of their area defenses (night fighters, FlAK, radar
siting etc.).
The two main trends set in motion by Speer and his cohorts would take place
anyway, and would lessen the impact of this strategy. De-centralization
would bring production lines away from obvious targets, and a concentration
on obvious target would have left the de-centralized lines completely
undisturbed.
The other trend is putting the German economy on a war footing, which would
have countered at least partially whatever target choice priorities
implemented by the Allies.

Of course, no damage done without actual occupation is ever permanent, as
long as the enemy does not enter that overall system failure (as in 1945)
when they cannot repair the damage. So, hitting again and again the same
high-value targets is a good choice, because the enemy will keep repairing
them.

All in all, I think that going for the Ruhr, instead of for the Battle of
Berlin, in the winter of 1943 would have been a good idea for the Allied
effort, though not a decisive improvement.
Of course, out of this, another question remains to be answered: "which
Allied effort?" Which one of the Allies, in the fall/winter of 1943, was
barely being held at bay with little more than those last 50 tanks that
Hitler promised as a Christmas gift to one of his commanders? A possible
critical shortage in deliveries to the front lines in the last few months of
1943 would be felt more severely - where? On the short, mountainous Southern
Italian front? I don't think so.

While raids continued against the Ruhr it was at a lower tempo as
there was a switch to Berlin as the main focus of the campaign in
Nov 1943. Between November 1943 and March 1944 Bomber
Command made 16 massed attacks on Berlin. Losses were heavy
with the  RAF losing more than 1,000 bombers, with a further 1,700
damaged, and well over 7,000 aircrew becoming casualties.

After the end of the Battle of Berlin the heavies were switched to bombing
infrastructure targets in France and Germany as part of the preparation
for Overlord. It wasnt until late summer of 1944 that they renewed the
attacks on industrial targets in full force and the oil campaign in
particular
was devastating for the Germans.

Absolutely, and they might have started it 6 months sooner at least.
Harris called it "panacea bombing", but his own failed campaign of area
bombing might now be called "faith-based bombing".

Which is interesting, in view of how the British surely realized that
the Germans had made a huge blunder in switching from airfields to
cities during the BoB? Or was that switch seen as of so little
importance to the winning of that battle, that it did not enter the
minds of the Bomber Command leaders that they could be in a similar
position in 1943?

It may have been seen as a matter of scale. The Nazis never really
could put the numbers over the U.K. that the U.S. and U.K. could put
over the continent. There are some who feel if a 6 ounce hammer couldn't
do it maybe a 9 pound one will. That may be true of rocks, but not of
people. That should gave been abundantly clear after Stalingrad and the
trenches of WW1.

Indeed!

Going to Berlin was a mistake.

However the writer's claim is the Ruhr was a *choke* point to Germany in
1943 and the RAF could have shut it down in 1943.

The United States Strategic Bombing Survey which I looked up shows the
1943 bombing did have some effect. Steel  production in the Ruhr
declined by about 10 percent during the attack and did not fully recover
during the rest of the year. Interesting the main problem was the
air-raid alerts rather then the damage from the raids. Maybe more but
smaller raids would have been more effective.

By late 1944 both the loss of German territory and air bombing resulted
in a dramatic German decline in steel production of about 60% yet German
industries still had large inventories of steel.

Also I am not sure if the RAF could have mounted such large raids as
they did in late 1944 on the Ruhr in 1943.

Area bombing failed to bring about a defeat of the enemy through mroale
collapse alone, and in that, it was a failed campaign. Of course the "now"
you correctly use points out that it's quite easy to see that - for us, in
hindsight.

OTOH, area bombing did not just hit the enemy morale. That series of raids
against the Ruhr that Tooze seems to consider so effective, well - they
largely _were_ area bombing. The British contribution to the oil campaign
was, in part, carried out through area bombing procedures.

&gt; After the end of the Battle of Berlin the heavies were switched to bombing
&gt; infrastructure targets in France and Germany as part of the preparation

&gt; attacks on industrial targets in full force and the oil campaign in
&gt; particular
&gt; was devastating for the Germans.

It was, though on August 30, the single most important contribution to the
oil campaign was carried out by ground forces. Thus the bombings were
devastating because the biggest supply source was no longer available to
Germans, thanks to someone else.

&gt; &gt; First thing, it's not as if Bomber Command suddenly ceased taking losses
in
&gt; &gt; the second half of 1943. It took plenty of losses, so that is and wasn't
&gt; &gt; reason to stop that series of raids.

&gt; The reason was at the time the RAF felt for what they lost it was not
&gt; worth continuing to bomb the Ruhr. I suspect they were right.
">

To a point. As I have pointed out, the Germans might have concentrated their
area defenses around the Ruhr and on the approaches to it, and thus the
British might have been right in thinking that, at least at first, switching
to another target would give them less opposition to face.
OTOH, as I wrote, as soon as you stop hitting a target, an enemy that is not
completely resourceless will start repairing it. So stopping completely is
never a good idea.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The Hamburg series was reasonably justified. The switch to Berlin, not
so,
&gt; &gt; for a variety of reasons. Of course we can judge that from our
comfortable
&gt; &gt; hindsight positions.

&gt; To continue with Berlin for so long can it be criticized only in
&gt; hindsight?
">

No. We can be _sure_ of that from here, but there were reasons not to switch
to Berlin, and in particular not to make it a long-winded campaign, that
were already known at the time. I have not listed them in the previous
message, but here they are:
- Berlin was too far beyond the Earth's curve for Oboe to be accurate;
- Berlin was too large a built-up area, with too many interspersed,
difficult-to-distinguish bodies of water for H2S to be accurate;
- Berlin was just plain too far, with some 1,800 kms to go for the round
trip, many of them deep into Germany - easier work for the night fighters;
- Berlin was just plain too far for the fully foreseeable worsening of the
weather conditions in autumn and winter - electrical storms, icing on the
wings, bad visibility etc. These would have affected any raids, but shorter
flights would have reduced their consequences.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The effectiveness of the raids was bound to diminish in the autumn and
&gt; &gt; winter, when compared to summer, regardless of the target area chosen,
&gt; &gt; because of two reasons Bomber Command could do little about: the weather
and
&gt; &gt; the see-saw nature of the EM-ECM-ECCM war, which was headed, briefly,
for
&gt; &gt; the German side.

&gt; Well they could have done what they did later and bombed targets in
&gt; Western Europe eg France.
">

Yes. You could switch to an air version of what the Soviets were doing on
the ground. Shorter series of large-medium raids against a group of
industrial cities, accompanied by minor, diversionary actions against other
widely dispersed targets. After, say, 3-5 raids against Hamburg and nearby
targets (during which you keep sending smaller attacks on the Ruhr), return
with 3-5 main raids against the Ruhr, but at the same time you keep sending
smaller raids over Hamburg; that forces the night fighters to disperse and
at the same time harasses the repair works. Then 3-5 raids against targets
in Southern Germany - but you still send smaller raids on the Ruhr. Then
back to the Ruhr with the main force, etc.

Of course, such a choice definitely gives up the hope that a continuous
pounding on the enemy capital will bring the enemy leaders to sense. I.e.,
it gives up the morale objective.

Additionally, it was, and still is, difficult to define the ideal size of
the attacking force and the right balance between dispersion and
concentration. Sometimes, smaller raids seemed to be easy targets for the
enemy, suffering a disproportionate percentage of losses. Other times, the
big big raid attracted seemingly every night fighter in Germany, making the
German controllers' work easier, and it also suffered heavy losses.
Personally, I believe that the 1,000-bomber raids were not a good idea save
as a propaganda tool. They put all the eggs into one basket, and many of the
eggs had to be not fully trained OTU crews, Coastal Command contributors
etc. A largish but well trained main force per night, helped by a secondary
smallish harassment force against a target that has recently been bombed, a
handful of Mosquito-only diversionary missions, and intruder sweeps would
probably be the right balance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; All in all, I think that going for the Ruhr, instead of for the Battle
of
&gt; &gt; Berlin, in the winter of 1943 would have been a good idea for the Allied
&gt; &gt; effort, though not a decisive improvement.

&gt; Which is my question.

&gt; &gt; Of course, out of this, another question remains to be answered: &quot;which
&gt; &gt; Allied effort?&quot; Which one of the Allies, in the fall/winter of 1943, was
&gt; &gt; barely being held at bay with little more than those last 50 tanks that
&gt; &gt; Hitler promised as a Christmas gift to one of his commanders? A possible
&gt; &gt; critical shortage in deliveries to the front lines in the last few
months of
&gt; &gt; 1943 would be felt more severely - where? On the short, mountainous
Southern
&gt; &gt; Italian front? I don't think so.

&gt; Russia, the Germans could use all they could get in the East.
">

Yes. It was a rhetorical question. Those 50 tanks were not headed for the
Apennines.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you agree or disagree and if so why with the following from a new
&gt; &gt; &gt; book &quot;The wages of Destruction by Adam Tooze&quot; p602.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;...by contrast with the Ruhr, which was Germany's chief supplier of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; most basic inputs of coal and steel. Shutting down the Ruhr and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; transport links that connected it to the rest of Germany had the
&gt; &gt; &gt; potential to disrupt production throughout the entire country. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; repeated raids on the Ruhr in 1943 had exacted a terrible toll from RAF
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bomber Command. Nearly 4,000 crew were killed or taken prisoner, and 640
&gt; &gt; &gt; bombers were shot down or crashed. Terrible as this attrition was,
&gt; &gt; &gt; however, thanks to the mounting output of the British aircraft
&gt; &gt; &gt; factories, the RAF's bomber strength actually increased between February
&gt; &gt; &gt; and August T943. The Ruhr was the choke point and in 1943 it was within
&gt; &gt; &gt; the RAF's grip. The failure to maintain that hold and to tighten it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; a tragic operational error. The ongoing disaster that Speer and his
&gt; &gt; &gt; cohorts clearly expected in the summer of 1943 was put off for another
&gt; &gt; &gt; year.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Yes, the switch to bombing Berlin was an undoubted error, of course
&gt; &gt; hindsight is always 20/20.

&gt; Indeed!

&gt; Going to Berlin was a mistake.

&gt; However the writer's claim is the Ruhr was a *choke* point to Germany in
&gt; 1943 and the RAF could have shut it down in 1943.

&gt; The United States Strategic Bombing Survey which I looked up shows the
&gt; 1943 bombing did have some effect. Steel  production in the Ruhr
&gt; declined by about 10 percent during the attack and did not fully recover
&gt; during the rest of the year. Interesting the main problem was the
&gt; air-raid alerts rather then the damage from the raids. Maybe more but
&gt; smaller raids would have been more effective.

&gt; By late 1944 both the loss of German territory and air bombing resulted
&gt; in a dramatic German decline in steel production of about 60% yet German
&gt; industries still had large inventories of steel.

&gt; Also I am not sure if the RAF could have mounted such large raids as
&gt; they did in late 1944 on the Ruhr in 1943.

&gt; --
&gt; Its amazing how many obscure relatives, that you met at funerals.

&gt; Observations of Bernard - No 108
">

Any loss of production or loss of one production site forces the
Germans, and Speer, to make decisions on what weapons to produce and
how many. The oil loss effected everyone and any one plant out of
production was not just a problem of selecting who gets what oil is
left but a reduced supply period.

The bombing started with oil and then switched off, anyone who has sat
in on a government body that tries to connect goals with achievements
knows this problem, no obvious result we have to reallocate resources
to something that gives us results. The "neat bombing pattern" of Catch
22 is an example of a goal that seemed to give results but didn't.

example:
Between '43 and '44, the 8th Air Force had made a number of successful
raids on a number of German oil facilities. These immediatley began to
have the crippling effects on the German war effort that Bomber Command
had been promising. Get this... Harris was unimpressed. He was by this
time a national hero, and with the end of the war so close, no one had
the guts, (nor the heart) to deter the man from his game of dispensing
the wrath of God upon the German populace. He could have easily been
dismissed for his refusal to accept the oil bombing plan approved by
the Chiefs of Staff. He wasn't.

BBC okay?

Long range fighters had given the Allies air superiority; the Normandy
landings had broken the Luftwaffe's radar network. The German armed
forces, everywhere in retreat, were suffering from fuel shortages
created by a US led bombing campaign against the oil industry. (Harris
had disparaged the oil campaign as a 'panacea', calling instead for
continued attacks on enemy
morale.) http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/timeline/factfiles/nonflash/a11383...

or a direct quote

One problem was his antipathy toward targeting German industry outside
of the city industrial areas. To Harris, it was a piecemeal approach
unlikely to yield results. "I do not believe in 'panacea'
targets, e.g., oil, rubber, ball bearings," Harris wrote in April
1943. "Specializing on one such [industry] means that the enemy
concentrates all his defenses, and nothing else in Germany, including
morale and housing, is likely to suffer."

I have no problem in accepting that Harris did not believe that targeting
one single industrial class of targets would be the right course of action.
That's undisputable.
I have problems with almost everything else in the excerpt you chose, as
well as on most of the rest of that source.

The whole page makes the double inference that Bomber Command only bombed
cities throughout the war, and that in German cities one only found
dwellings - not railway yards, not industries, not military complexes. Both
inferences are not openly stated, because when one states them openly, they
immediately appear for what they are.

Another lie is that Harris refused his orders. Of course he insisted on
carrying out his strategy - that is not to say that he did not devote part
of his force to strategies he did not agree with, and he did that because
ordered to. Just to make a couple of examples, Schweinfurt and its ball
bearings are famous for the US daylight raids - but they were visited by
over 700 British bombers on the night of Februrary 24, 1944. As to oil,
Leuna was visited 20 times by the Americans - and twice by the British.

It is interesting to observe that the US campaign against the synthetic oil
and high-octane production plants are defined as successful; then, the
increase of other industrial outputs are taken as a proof that the British
approach did not work. However, as late as the fall of 1944, the production
at those oil plants went up again - but apparently this is not to be
considered as evidence of anything with regard to the US attacks.

Surprisingly, the great success of the USAAF air force against German oil
production does not appear to have received any help. Such as, the thousands
of magnetic mines dropped into the Danube by the RAF, or the Soviets
occupying Ploesti in the summer of 1944, or the fact that in the last 18
months of the war, any German industry (including, therefore, oil) was
likely to experience 25% absenteism in the workforce on any given day (guess
somebody was bombing the workers, their houses, the public transport
services with which they reached the workplace...).

Going back to a what-if, let's suppose that all of the joint might of the
daylight and nighttime bomber forces of the Allies concentrated on no more
than 10 targets, and stayed concentrated there for as long as it took. Is
there anyone out there who can't see what would happen?

RAF in April 1944.

Schweinfurt contained five ball bearing factories essential to German
fighter production and it was believed that their destruction would
cause a bottleneck in the process. Air Chief Marshal Harris, C in C
British Bomber Command, called these potential bottlenecks 'panacea
targets'. He refused to bomb them. so the task fell to the Americans
whose daylight Precision bombing methods on German targets were still
unproven.
http://www.valourandhorror.com/BC/Raids/Scheinft.php

As with the first attack on Schweinfurt, he had hoped that Harris would
follow the 8th's attack with a night attack on Schweinfurt. Harris,
however, was adamant about not attacking what he deemed panacea, or
cure-all, targets. In his autobiography, Bomber Offensive, Harris
defended his position, saying that every time the Americans went to one
of these targets, their resources were so depleted as to not return for
a couple of months, giving the Germans ample time to rebuild or replace
everything that was destroyed. He also defended not attacking

Do you mean in terms of crippling production in these areas at the
expense of all others or do you mean that the Germans would
concentrate their fighters on these 10 targets with correspondingly
higher Allied losses?

My suspicion would be that initially Allied bomber losses would be
much higher BUT that would be short-term as the German fighters would
be shot down faster than reality. Once the defending fighters were
decimated faster than they could be replaced. Long-term that would
give the bombers a freer hand.

You try to show that Harris did not bomb what he did not want to - as long
as he was free to set up Bomber Command's policy. That's fine with me, and
it should be with anyone. He was the boss.
The point would be to show that Harris was ordered to do something - and ref
used to. As in, disobeying his orders. The page you quoted surmises that
Harris could and indeed should have been demoted, but he wasn't, because "so
late in the war" (the winter of 1943!) nobody dared to.
For somebody to be demoted, I suppose it would be useful to provide evidence
that he didn't just disagree with his allies' proposals and kept carrying
out his own policies. What would be needed is an order that Harris flatly
refused to comply with.

As to Schweinfurt, specifically, of course Bomber Command attacked it. Not
in the month the USAAF attacked it, yes.

I note that if you aren't careful you'll risk using a double standard.
The US attack on Schweinfurt in 1943 did not actually and definitively
cripple the German production of ball bearings (and, again, this is not
taken as proof that the idea was wrong, whereas the increase of German
industrial output in general has to show that Bomber Command's strategies
were wrong). So what's the solution? further attacks, to be carried out by
someone else, are demanded. If a given choice doesn't work, it's because
more of the same is needed.
But when Harris claimed exactly that: more of the same (of his own medicine,
of course) will carry the day, he's considered a lunatic.

Both considerations apply.

Of course, building aircraft in undisturbed factories isn't terribly useful,
if you have no fuel for them. On the other hand, supply trains run on fuel,
and they aren't being disturbed. Tanks and submarines run on less demanding
and expensive fuels than aircraft, and they are produced and sent out
without disturbance, and largely fueled directly from Ploesti. Without the
nationwide disruption caused by city raids, Germany can organize its
defense, production, and repair efforts to keep those 10 sites defended,
running, and quickly repaired when not running.

The assumption here is not only that the fighters are shot down faster than
reality, but also that they are shot down faster than bombers.
It's a certainly wrong assumption as to night operations. Night fighter
losses were low, and even if they increase with this scenario, they can be
sustained. On the other hand, quite often night operations entailed
excessive casualty rates in OTL - for the bombers.
As to daylight operations, I don't think it's a given that defending
fighters are shot down faster than bombers and escort fighters. Both sides
know where to find the other. In OTL, escort fighters might come back with
their full ammo load, and German fighters might be deployed out to areas not
under attack; but, more importantly, the bombers escorted by those fighters
which found no opposition stood very good chances of making it back. In this
ATL, every raid is met with opposition. Escort fighters may have a better
chance due to numbers and better training, but bombers will have a much
lousier chance than in OTL.

Bomber Command's Battle of Berlin was called off after 16 main raids (and
many minor ones), while other 12 main targets were also being bombed by
smaller (but still sizable) formations, and minor targets by small attacks.
The loss ratio for this period was 5.5%, widely considered as unsustainable.
Most losses were suffered on the flight to Berlin, and most by night
fighters, showing that the knowledge of what the intended target is greatly
favors the defender.
On the basis of these figures, I believe that a concentration on 10 targets
only would easily, on its own, increase the losses to, say, 7%, if not more.
Each increase in the loss ratio increases the chance of further losses,
because the solution to higher losses can only be to throw in the fray the
inexperienced crews of the OTUs - which obviously were more vulnerable. Thus
an increase of 1.5% could easily cause, on its own, a further increase, and
so on in a snowball effect. But let's say this stops at a steady 7%; every
14 missions you'd need a full replacement of all the crews and planes.

4. the German resistance on D-day was weak, and the Luftwaffe did not fly

Oh and on 8 and 18 October, the main night raids by Bomber Command suffered
losses in the order of 5.4 and 5%, mostly to night fighters. I don't know if
that rates as formidable, but anyway I'd say it's pretty good.

&gt;&gt; After the end of the Battle of Berlin the heavies were switched to
&gt;&gt; bombing
&gt;&gt; infrastructure targets in France and Germany as part of the preparation
&gt;&gt; for Overlord. It wasnt until late summer of 1944 that they renewed the
&gt;&gt; attacks on industrial targets in full force and the oil campaign in
&gt;&gt; particular
&gt;&gt; was devastating for the Germans.

&gt; It was, though on August 30, the single most important contribution to the
&gt; oil campaign was carried out by ground forces. Thus the bombings were
&gt; devastating because the biggest supply source was no longer available to
&gt; Germans, thanks to someone else.
">

By the time the Soviets overan Ploesti and the Rumanian
oilfields the amount of oil from that source reaching the Reich
had been cut by more than 60% and was a small fraction of
German oil production.

At its peak in 1941 the Germans received 13 million barrels
of oil from Rumania.  By May 1944 German domestic production
had reached over 300,000 tons per month (30 million barrels per year)
and Rumanian oil  production was down to a few thousand barrels per month .

After the first month of the oil campaign German synthetic production was
down to 100,000 tons and by Sept it had dropped to 5,000 tons.

This was a devastating blow to the German war machine.

The other side of the coin is that the raids on industrial cities such
as Coventry in the blitz that followed the BOB were VERY damaging.
The major raid in Nov 1940 destroyed thousands of homes and halted
industrial production in many vital war industries for several
months.

Forunately the Luftwaffe didnt have the capacity or the will to maintain the
attacks and the British were able to counter the German guidance beams
but its no surprise that the RAF adopted the mix of incendiaries and blast
bombs when attacked the Ruhr as had been used against Coventry.

Fair enough answer there. Sounds like if one wants to do indirect
damage (i.e., not destroying the aircraft that want to destroy one)
one needs to have plans to either accept the direct wounding one will
receive until the indirect damage has an effect. Not a nice policy for
the aircrew!

&gt; had reached over 300,000 tons per month (30 million barrels per year)
&gt; and Rumanian oil  production was down to a few thousand barrels per month
.
">

There is the small detail that in the first half of 1944, Ploesti still
produced 7 million barrels. Had this production rate continued, at the end
of 1944 it would have topped the 1941 peak. That "Rumanian oil  production
was down to a few thousand barrels per month ." is rather misleading if you
take the above in consideration.

Yes, Ploesti production did go down after that 7-million-barrels-in-6-months
record, not in May but later that year, and that was due to the bombing
campaign. Not by May, but by August, it was down to about 10%, yes.

However, what would have happened if the Soviets had not arrived? One of two
things:

- either the Allies would have kept the extremely high rate of bombing raids
up (making those aircraft unavailable elsewhere),
- or the Germans and Romanians would have repaired the plants, exactly as
they had done after the 1943 raid.
No damage done without ground occupation is permanent, unless the enemy has
entered that terminal system failure state when all of their resources are
so much depleted that further defense and repairs are impossible.

As a general remark, I don't believe it to be fair to assess the importance
of a given target on the basis of its reduced output after attacks. Its
actual output in ordinary conditions should be taken as a basis, if not its
potential output.
You are underestimating the importance of Ploesti in 1944 if, instead of
taking the average production per month, you take the August 1944 production
figure (after a 4-month bombing campaign) as the basis of your estimation.
By this token, I could say that Ploesti wasn't all that important in 1943,
either, look how low was the August 1943 production figure - after Tidal
Wave.

&gt; Yes. You could switch to an air version of what the Soviets were doing on

&gt; industrial cities, accompanied by minor, diversionary actions against other
&gt; widely dispersed targets. After, say, 3-5 raids against Hamburg and nearby
&gt; targets (during which you keep sending smaller attacks on the Ruhr), return
&gt; with 3-5 main raids against the Ruhr, but at the same time you keep sending
&gt; smaller raids over Hamburg; that forces the night fighters to disperse and
&gt; at the same time harasses the repair works. Then 3-5 raids against targets
&gt; in Southern Germany - but you still send smaller raids on the Ruhr. Then
&gt; back to the Ruhr with the main force, etc.

In retrospect this would be better but it world not win the war. Which
brings me back to my earlier point that Allied air power was unlikely in
this period choke Germany in 1943 as Adam Tooze in his book states.

Yes, I got that, but you should support it in some way.

It won't work with regard to night operations.
It also won't work in daylight until you have the Mustang in fairly large
numbers, because in order to defeat the daylight fighters you really need
long-range escorts.
Will it work, limited to daylight operations, once you have the Mustangs?
Not sure. 8th AF did defeat the Luftwaffe's daylight fighters, in the end,
but can the same happen in these different conditions?

Well the clearest discussion of this I have come across
is in Bomber Command by Max Hastings. In 1943 the
navigation aids were limited. Gee would put an aircraft
within about a mile of the aiming point, that is if it was
in range. It did not allow the targeting of individual
factories or for that matter something as small as an oil
refinery which for obvious reasons were not situated in
the middle of built up areas. Oboe was more accurate but
even so it was limited in that not all pilots could be
trained to use it so the main force had to depend on
master bombers and markers. The Germans quickly became
proficient at duplicating marker flares.

Next Harris did not refuse to attack the oil targets and
IIRC something like 20% of Bomber Command effort was
against them. However that was more a matter of weakness
of his superiors in that more effort was not applied.
Harris certainly diverted 100% of effort to the
Transportation plan and the Normandy preparations. Off
course the transportation plan had a far greater effect on
German industry than the oil bombing. By 1944 it was
massively dispersed and depended on efficient
transportation to function at all.

&gt; Berlin.
">

I'm sorry if I gave that impression. I'll state my point more clearly: I
believe that _any_ raid using more than some 600 bombers (a ball-park
figure) was more of an exercise in propaganda than anything else. The 600 is
a ball-park figure, because of course, later in the war, larger resources
eased some of the considerations below. "1,000-bomber raids" meant very
large raids like those so dubbed by propaganda.

There are several reasons for this:
1. in order to reach those very high figures, "freshmen" crews, OTUs,
second-line aircraft, Coastal Command units, and even Army Cooperation units
had to be press-ganged in. With the obvious consequences as to bombing
accuracy and casualty rates.
2. one target makes for easier work for the German defenses. You raise the
issue of diversionary missions; yes, they were used, and sometimes they
fooled the Germans and sometimes they didn't. Additionally, if you are using
99% of your available assets for that one strike, a 1% diversion isn't going
to be really significant.
3. Using so many bombers did not automatically mean more bombs within the
target area, where by target area we're absolutely not talking about
precision bombing. What with the less experienced crews mentioned above,
German decoy fires, and the difficulty of managing such a big stream of
bombers, larger raids stood a large chance of scattering bombs not just all
over the target city, not just all over the surrounding countryside, but
also on all towns and villages within 50 kms. This did happen more than
once.

A 600-bomber raid gives you a powerful tool, leaves inexperienced crews out
of it all, allows for at least a couple of smaller raids and a largish
diversionary force (you can use it to mine the coasts), and might give you
more bombs on the target than a 800/900-bomber raid.

Several of the raids to Berlin were close to the 1,000-figure, and in order
to push the number up, Bomber Command did have to employ what were, by the
end of 1943, second-line aircraft: for instance, the first raid of the
series, on 22 November, had 764 aircraft, but in order to reach this big
figure, Stirlings had to be used. That this was a poor decision is shown not
only by the fact that this was the last time the Stirlings were sent here,
but also by these percentages:
Lancasters loss rate in this raid: 2.3%
Halifaxes: 4.2%
Stirlings: 10% (!).

As another example not only of the size of the Berlin raids, but also of the
points I made above, one of the last raids, on 15 Februrary 1944, featured
891 bombers. It was accompanied by a puny diversionary move to Frankfurt,
with 24 bombers, and these completely failed to draw any German fighters at
all. Loss rate: 4.8%.

Where the RAF could bomb was dictated in part by

The point I was making was the Harris and the RAF didn't even try to do
Schweinfurt as a follow-up to the American raid.  Much of the target
timing of the two flights was designed to create a time lag so the
German fighters would have to land and refuel. Giving the second flight
a less opposed time over the target. As this flight was a "shuttle"
run, ie heading for North African fields, the Germans were unprepared
for following them.

and...on the second raid
"Inside German airspace rocket-launching twin-engined fighters,
including night fighters, joined the battle as more than 300 fighters
from 24 bases opposed the raid. The force diverged from the morning's
route at Mannheim, alerting the German defenders that the target was
Schweinfurt. Losses among the 57 B-17's of the lead wing were so severe
that many among its airmen considered the possibility that the wing
might be annihilated before reaching the target. However fifteen miles
from Schweinfurt the opposing fighters, after shooting down 22 bombers,
disengaged and landed to refuel and re-arm in order to attack the force
on its way out. Five miles from Schweinfurt German anti-aircraft guns
began firing an effective flak barrage into the path of the bomber
force."

"Destruction of both targets was severe. In Regensburg all six main
workshops of the Messerschmitt factory were destroyed or severely
damaged, as were many supporting structures including the final
assembly shop. In Schweinfurt the destruction was less severe but still
extensive. The two largest factories, Kugelfischer &amp; Company and
Vereinigte Kugellager Fabrik I, suffered 80 direct hits. 380,000 square
feet of buildings in the five factories were destroyed, and more than a
million square feet suffered fire damage. All the factories except
Kugelfischer had extensive fire damage to machinery when incendiaries
ignited the machine oil used in the manufacturing process. Albert Speer
reported an immediate 34 per cent loss of production, but both the
production shortfall and the actual loss of bearings were made up by
extensive surpluses found throughout Germany in the aftermath of the
raid.

***The industry's infrastructure, while vulnerable to a sustained
campaign, was not vulnerable to destruction by a single raid. Speer
indicated in 1974 that the two major flaws made by the USAAF in the
August strike were first in dividing their force instead of all
striking the ball-bearing plants, and second, failing to followup the
first strike for two months, by which time plans to disperse the
industry were well underway.***

On the contrary the importance was demonstrated by the bombing
campaign which had decimated its production. The reality remains
that by mid 1944 german synthetic production provided the
vast majority of its fuel resources and the bombing campaign
conducted against those plants robbed the reich of its last
source of fuel.

Berlin, pre war population 4,242,500
Schweinfurt, pre war population 36,500.

The idea day bombers could light fires to guide night bombers is
nice in theory, but see how often in worked in WWII.

Window/chaff dropped bomber command heavy bomber losses
for targets in Germany, from 5.5% in June 1943 to 3.5% in July,
the defences recovered to push the loss rate to around 4.8%
at the end of August before the next set of countermeasures
came into play.  The deeper the target the more chance the
defences have of finding the attacking bombers.

Harris was correct that Bomber Command could not be expected to
be able to knock out and keep knocked out small targets in Germany
when he stated his objections to the ball bearing plan in 1943.  You
only need to see the average bombing accuracy figures.  The average
figure for the second half of 1943 and early 1944 was 55% of bombs
within 3 miles of the aiming point for targets in Germany.  There was
a near linear rise in accuracy, from 60% in June 1944 to 88% in
December 1944.

The RAF attack on Schweinfurt in February 1944 did not do much
to production.

Harris was wrong in assuming the same bomb accuracy applied to
targets in France.  As the pre D-day strikes showed.  He raised
considerable objections to Bomber Command being used for these
strikes but it is interesting to note at the end of the war Eisenhower
seems to have rated Harris as more co-operative than the USAAF
Commanders.

Harris was wrong about oil, mainly out of conviction over the many
plans to "easily" stop German production, molybdenum, ball bearings,
aircraft industry for example.  Another reason for his error was he was
never shown the Ultra information in 1944 at least, and possibly not in
1945, he was not on the list.  All he received were intelligence reports
classified as "reliable".

On the other hand he should have appreciated the increase in accuracy
over France in mid 1944 translated to an increase in accuracy over
Germany once the radio guidance ground stations were set up on the
French border in the final quarter of 1944.  He seems to have decided
Germany was simply too big to be able to really hurt a key sector of the
economy.  What he missed was how much bigger, in effective bombing
capability terms, the allied air forces had become in the first 9 months
of 1944.

Having been through the efforts made by the 8th Air Force and Bomber
Command in the final year of the war my conclusion is if you want to
blame Harris for failing to hit specific targets you need to do the same
to the 8th Air Force.

Simply put the weather decided what sort of raid was done, the RAF
was open about calling the bad weather raids area attacks, the USAAF
was not.

Despite the well known disagreement between Harris and Portal over
oil attacks the reality is Harris did the raids, he did not expect them
to work but was not going to be blamed for not doing enough when,
as he expected, the plan failed.

Total 105,770.2 tons of bombs on oil targets out of 654,404.8 tons dropped
in
this period.  All up 16.4% of the bombs dropped June 1944 to April 1945.

It is clear, given the percentages of effort, the bombers based in England
in
particular could have mounted more attacks on oil targets.  Most of the
blame
attaches to Arthur Harris, who made no secret of his belief the oil campaign
would not achieve the results being claimed for it.  So how much did this
affect Bomber Command's choice of target?  One way to check is to compare
the effort of Bomber Command to that of the 8th Air Force.

Similarities are both forces used the same intelligence systems, both had to
cope with the same weather.

The differences are, the night defences were much stronger than the day
defences until around September 1944, and it was not until mid July 1944
the missing rate for night heavy bombers attacking German targets dropped
below the maximum acceptable, on average, the strength of the defences
denied the bombers the best, clear moonlight nights until later in the year.
In autumn weather, ignoring ground fog and haze, the night bombers had
around 1.8 times more chance of clear weather, in winter 2.6 times, in
summer the day bombers had 1.4 times the chance of clear weather than
the night bombers, in spring the night bombers had 2.7 times the chance of
clear weather.  Note one reason Bomber Command was allocated the oil
targets in the Ruhr was the persistent ground haze.   In high summer many
German targets were out of reach for the night bombers, the deep winter
similar rules applied to the day bombers.  SHAEF had control of target
allocation until mid September 1944 which meant only when attacking Germany
can we assume the majority of the targets selected were at the discretion of
the
Air Forces.  Bomber Command devoted a greater percentage of effort, along
with the better weather needed for such raids to invasion support until
November
1944. The 8th Air Force was initially allocated more oil targets than Bomber
Command, a situation that appears to have remained unchanged until November
1944.

Note the following data ignores the attacks made on Czechoslovakian oil
targets, by the 8th Air Force in May, August and September 1944 and
February 1945, 5 attacks 961.5 tons of bombs, and Bomber Command in
January 1945, 1 attack of 959.6 tons of bombs.  It is what happened when
the bombers struck targets in Germany, when the Air Forces had the most
discretion as to the choice of target during the SHAEF period of control.

Table is date, 8th Air Force bombs on Germany, tons / % of those bombs
on oil targets // Bomber Command bombs on Germany, tons / % of those
bombs on oil targets.

For the 8th the percentage of effort devoted to oil targets is higher if you
only consider targets in Germany, compared with the total effort figures.
For
Bomber Command there is one major exception to this, August 1944 when it put
in a major effort against oil targets in France, mainly storage and depot
targets.
While there were refineries in western Europe outside Germany the reality is
almost all German oil production reachable by the England based bombers was
within the 1937 German borders.  So the extra effort devoted to oil targets
is
not surprising.

I will ignore June 1944 as an aberration, since Bomber Command needed a very
good reason to go to Germany in June, the defences were at their peak and
the
targets that could be attacked were at a minimum.  In terms of percentage of
effort the two air forces matched each other in July and September 1944, the
8th took the lead in August,  October and November 1944, thereafter Bomber
Command took the lead.

8th Air Force, date, percentage of visual attacks for the month /
percentage
of visual attacks on targets in Germany / percentage of effort devoted to
targets
in Germany  // Bomber Command percentage of effort devoted to targets in
Germany

Jun-44  60.16  /  59.38  /  22.52  //  8.5
Jul-44  58.52  /  44.43  /  66.00  //  22.84
Aug-44  92.42  /  89.41  /  49.18  //  21.69
Sep-44  44.13  /  37.29  /  86.30  //  39.24
Oct-44  22.83  /  22.81  /  99.96  //  84.20
Nov-44  12.49  /  12.64  /  93.43  //  99.38
Dec-44  34.78  /  34.65  /  99.68  //  93.45
Jan-45  32.13  /  32.50  /  98.84  //  90.65
Feb-45  25.18  /  24.61  /  99.25  //  98.93
Mar-45  43.47  /  43.01  /  98.96  //  100.00
Apr-45  78.74  /  72.17  /  75.93  //  98.63

Note that in the initial months the percentage of effort devoted to oil
attacks
on German targets by the 8th Air Force is roughly half the percentage of
visual bombing of Germany.  It can be seen for June, July and September
1944 the amount of Bomber Command attacks outside Germany, which
were run requiring the better weather, is greater than the amount of visual
bombing the 8th Air Force achieved.  August 1944 is an exception and it
appears part of the reason oil targets were not hit harder is SHAEF
requesting a series of strikes on Motor Transport targets in Germany, Bomber
Command devoted 1,758.1 tons of bombs to these targets compared with
1,852.6 tons to oil targets in Germany.  The 8th had a similar request made,
resulting in 8 attacks of 1,720.9 tons on AFV and Motor Transport targets,
compared with 6,151.4 tons devoted to oil targets.  The 8th continued the
AFV and Motor transport strikes in September 5,766.7 tons of bombs versus
7,352 on oil targets in Germany and again in October 7,110.8 tons of bombs
versus 5,112.2 tons on oil targets in Germany.

This makes it sound as if the USAAF had a choice (to renew the attack, or
not).

There actually was no choice. Somehow, the text you quote does not contain
an account of the US losses.

The US employed 291 bombers on that day. 138 were damaged, and 60 shot down.
Loss rate: 20.6% (!!) counting the shot down bombers only.

Harris said that when the Americans attempted one of these missions, they'd
then be out of action for a couple of months. And in fact, that's what
happened.

So it's a Catch 22. In order to achieve the desired result, you have to
carry out two missions in a short time; but carrying out one mission will
put you in the position of being unable to carry out the second one in a
short time.

Attempting this at night with Bomber Command, of course, would have been
pointless.

What you said is (complete quote, as opposed to the one above that leaves
out the first line):
"By May 1944 German domestic production
had reached over 300,000 tons per month (30 million barrels per year)
and Rumanian oil  production was down to a few thousand barrels per month ."

"By May 1944" seems to apply to the Romanian oil production, too.

The first strike against Ploesti was in May, but serious damage was not done
until the series of raids (including night bombing by the British) of 17, 18
and 19 August - some mere 10 days before the arrival of the Soviets! I'd
have to check, but I wouldn't be surprised if the daylight fighter cover
over Ploesti, that was reported as much less effective at this point, had
deteriorated because the fighters were by now being diverted to the very
close and advancing ground frontline.

This only means you are voting for option 1 above, which could certainly be

Was it? I'd vote for early 1945, actually, and as you know, the oil
production in Germany went up again in October 1944. Certainly, it never
recovered, but the trend was definitely up again by November. This shows
that the Germans had the will and resources to start repair work and garner
some small improvement. Had they still been in control of Ploesti, some of
those resources would have been expended there. They would not have been
able to reach the July 1944 output levels, of course, but this upturn in the
trend shows they weren't in that state of final collapse yet.

Surely true. Yet potential production has its merits. For an example that
remains close to this subject, one of the reasons why Tidal Wave was a
failure is that Ploesti had about a 40% excess of refining and cracking
capacities; plants that were damaged in the attack could be replaced by
plants that weren't working at full rate before. So potential output
provides an important buffer.

&gt; &gt; either, look how low was the August 1943 production figure - after Tidal
&gt; &gt; Wave.

&gt; On the contrary the importance was demonstrated by the bombing
&gt; campaign which had decimated its production. The reality remains
&gt; that by mid 1944 german synthetic production provided the
&gt; vast majority of its fuel resources and the bombing campaign
&gt; conducted against those plants robbed the reich of its last
&gt; source of fuel.

By this token, the Luftwaffe "robbed" Fighter Command of Manston and Lympne
in 1940, having forced these air bases to cease operations for some time. I
think that "robbery" is too strong a term.

Right.

&gt; &gt; German night fighters were shown up over Hamburg in July 1943, why
&gt; &gt; would they be so formidable in a chaff environment within a few weeks?

&gt; Oh and on 8 and 18 October, the main night raids by Bomber Command suffered
&gt; losses in the order of 5.4 and 5%, mostly to night fighters. I don't know if
&gt; that rates as formidable, but anyway I'd say it's pretty good.

It is too high.

Bomber command could not take losses of 5% for very long.

If you are upset with my comments then some way you must care what I

AFAIK, the Germans started with the Wilde Sau system in the summer of 1943.
The raids we're talking about took place in October. The loss rates in two
major night raids that month (around 5%) don't seem to show that the German
night fighter force was ineffective that month.
