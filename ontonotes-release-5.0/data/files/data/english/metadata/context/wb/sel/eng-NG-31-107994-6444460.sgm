Hi  I am an experienced wine and beer maker and am trying my first mead ( a
cyser). the recipe for this 3 gal batch is as follows:
2 gal apple cider ( from a local cider mill)
5# Golden Blossom Honey
1.5tsp Ground Cinnamon
Lavin Pasteur Champagne Yeast

Procedure:
1)Dissolvd honey in 3/4 gal of cider and heated to 175 deg F for 15 min.
2) Skimmed, added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2tsp Irish Moss and heated and
additional 15 min.
3) Removed from heat , added remaining cider and forced cooled to 70 deg F
4) Pitched yeast, rehydrated in 1/3 cup , 100 deg F water for 15 min.
OG 1112

The cyser fermented well and hit SG =0.997 after two weeks. The problem is
that it has a very "hot" acidic teaste. I can definitely taste the honey and
apple notes.The pH = 3.55

Will this smooth out over time or do I need to add some chalk to de-acidify
it?

Of course it is hot.  It is probably over 15% alcohol!  With that high of
alcohol content you may want to smooth the acidity out by sweetening it
making a desert mead rather than reducing the alcohol.  It may turn out very
nice that way.  It is never going to make a good table mead with that much
alcohol so I would not try to.  It is probably gong to take a loooog time to
smooth out.  I would expect 2 to 3 years minimum with this one and maybe
longer.  the general rule if you want a smooth drink is - the higher the
alcohol, the longer it must age.

I make a cyser with a similar gravity (12 pounds honey, up
to 4 gallons of cider for a 5-gallon batch).  In order to keep
it from being bone dry I use a neutral beer yeast rather than
the champagne yeast, and to keep the fusel alcohols (that "hot"
taste) under control make sure to ferment it at the cool end of
the range.  I've had cysers that were drinkable after a few
months, though a year of aging doesn't hurt them.
At any rate, fusels will smooth out into esters with time,
especially in the acidic environment of your cyser.

Ray   I have made wines at this gravity without this problem. I fermented
the cyser at around 70 deg F. Are the fusel's more prevalent in Mead??

Also how exactly would you sweeten it?? I have already racked onto Campden
tablets.

Some texts I have read suggest using wine conditioner at the final racking
to sweeten.

100% on-target!

You can make a 15% ABV wine and not get the fusel tastes.  Why I
am not certain.  Having never made wine, I can only presume the
flavor/aroma of the grapes masks the high alcohol aroma/taste.
My strongest ale was an Arrogant Bastard clone with an ABV just
over 9%.  It's FG was 1.02 and it really didn't taste that good
to me until it was 10 weeks old.

Ray's aging estimate might be high and then again it might be
low.  But that is a way of life with high ABV meads.

My rough estimate of the effect of blending two gallons of
unfermented Cider with 3 gallons of a 15% Cyser is a 9%
semi-sweet cyser.  So you might consider racking some of the
Cyser and blending it with varying amounts of unfermented
Cider until you find an acceptable combination.

The cinnamon would have added to any peppery taste. An attempt at a
spiced/mulled cider I tried once taught me that spices like cinnamon and
cloves need to be used very sparingly otherwise they'll totally dominate
whatever it is you're making.

The gravity of the situraton does not come from the starting gravity alone,
it also comes from the mix of ingredients.  If you are making peach/apricot
wine, you cannot expect to uses enough peaches for a galon of wine and
enough apricots for a galon of ine all in the same gallon.  You have to many
ingredients.  You used pure apple juice and pure honey and then added
cinimon to it.  This is way to concentrated of flavors.  It is going to take
some serious time for them to mellow out if they ever do.  You probably have
way to much acid for anything less than a sweet wine but that is the way you
made it.  Apple juice has enough acid to make a sweet apple drink
interesting.  If you take the sugar out of it, it is going to be very
acidic.  Then honey has acid also.  You added that on top of the apple
juice.  You mixed the two together and then used yeast to take the sugar
out, leaving the acid in, and then filling it up with a very high alcohol
level which is going to make it hot on top of being acidic.  Then you added
cinnamon on top of all that.  A very rich blend.

How would I sweeten it.  Normally I advise using the honey it was made with
to bring out the honey character, but in your case, I would recomend using
common white sugar so you do not add any more acid or flavor.

There is one other possibility that might work.  I used it once when I ended
up with too much stuf in a batch.  You have a lot of alcohol and probably
too much acid from too much ingredients.  So, water it down to 12% alcohol.
Add 1/4 the volume of water.  Try this first.  Draw off 4/5's of a bottle of
mead.  fill it the rest of the way with water.  Cork it,  shack it good, and
set it back for at least one month for everything to blend together and for
it to get over bottle shock.  Then try it.  Just a thought.  It may still
need a bit of sweetening.

Oh, I would never recomend using conditioner.  Comercial conditioners are
basically a blend of sorbate and sugar.  Using it will give you too much or
too litle sorbate.  Too little is unsafe.  Too much can ruin the wine.  A
volume of wine needs a given amount of sulfite, no mater how much or how
little sweetener you use.

But remember, for all of my coments, you are crafting wine for yourself, not
me.
