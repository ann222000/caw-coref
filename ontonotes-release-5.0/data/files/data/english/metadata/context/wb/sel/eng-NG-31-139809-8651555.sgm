I wanted to paddle from Bete Grise to the point of the Keweenaw and
back on Labor Day, before school starts.  I think it would be a great
way to end the summer.  Let me know if you or anyone is interested in
doing so.  I have the whole day open.  Thanks!

Being over a twenty five mile round trip that might be an ambitious day
trip unless conditions are dead calm.  But if the weather holds I would be
interested in giving it a try. If you are at the Breakers on Wednesday
evening we can talk about it.
