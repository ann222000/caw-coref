Sorry folks, I just posted a personal E-mail I thought was going to my

Welcome to the party.   You aren't the first, and you won't be the last.

Now, for your penance you must send chocolate to every ASA member.

Note to Dee Tee.  Make sure you tell your SSDI attorney about fibro fog and
chemo fog.  Newer studies not only confirm chemo fog but say it doesn't
necessarily go away with time.

&quot;I can't concentrate&quot; was high on my list of reasons why I can't work
anymore.  &quot;You wouldn't want me doing your taxes&quot; was up there too.
