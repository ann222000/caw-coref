I just got a hold of a 119 gal. air tank and I wanted to cut it in
half. Can I just weld a flat plate of steel on the end or does it have
to be cylindrical shape for the pressure.

It has to be spherical shape.

Can you explain why it has to be a spherical shape?

That's easy.  The molecules are spherical, and will get jammed in a regular
tank.

You can buy these pre-formed and they dont cost that much.  Go with the
spherical type, you can get them from pipe suppliers.

It doesn't. But if you think about it, any piece of flat stock you put on
there is going to want to blow out like a balloon, so if you want to use
flat stock, it will have to be much heavier material. Which is wasteful.

If you want two hemispherical ends, all you have to do is to cut a slice
out of the middle of the tank and join the ends.

Could you be a little more specific?  What shape is it now?  And is it
pressure rated?  Is it designed for compressed gases?  How good of a welder
are you?  What shape would the final two tanks be?  Why do you want to take
a good tank and do this?  Why not just buy what you need?

The only 119 gallon &quot;air tanks&quot; that I am aware of are for
water systems.  Just
exactly what is it you are trying to do?     What is the
application of your
cut-in-half tank, and what kind of pressure are you going to
be putting in it?

Water system &quot;air tanks&quot; are usually pretty thin
stuff----pressures are somewhere
on the low side of 60 psi.

It DOESN't have to be spherical.  It could be semi-elliptical or
torispherical.  Don't do this until you understand this question better.
Are you a good enough welder to do pressure vessels?  None of the welders I
have met would  have to ask this question.

Ayup, they get hung up in the corners and sit there vibrating, like
little tiny grinders. Pretty soon the flat plate blows off and killed
the neighbor who was simply reading War and Peace on the terlet.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Not likely, Gunner.  Those molecules are not going to cut through the corner
weld all at the same time.  What is more likely is that they will causen a
leak at one spot, causing the molecules to come streaming out, like machine
gun bullets.  Unless the neighbor happens to be s***ting in the line of
fire, he will survive.  However, he may suddenly think he is reading &quot;War
not Peace.&quot;

If you have a steel sphere holding pressure, every bit of the steel is
in tension.
If you have a cylindrical tank with sphere ends, every bit of steel is
in tension.
If you have a cylindrical tank with flat ends , some of the steel is
in compression and the rest in tension.  And you will have bending
monments.  If you pressurize this tank and depressurize the tank, it
will flex and if not made very strong will fatique and crack.
