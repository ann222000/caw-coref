The New Message from God
A Message for the Religious Leaders of the World
by Marshall Vian Summers
May 28, 2006
http://www.newmessage.org/message-for-religious-leaders.php

This is a message for the religious leaders of the world. It is part of
the New Message from God, which has been sent into the world for the
protection and advancement of humanity.

This New Message is needed now to bring the great spiritual teachings
that have already been provided for humanity into greater union and
harmony with one another, for they were never meant to compete with one
another.

Humanity is facing a great set of trials in the future. It is facing the
prospect of living in a world of diminishing resources and increasing
competition, conflict and risk of war. It is facing environmental
disruption and breakdown. And it is facing intervention from forces from
beyond the world who are here to take advantage of human weakness and
conflict for their own ends.

At this moment, there are very few people in the world who can see all
of these things. Yet like great waves of change, they are approaching
your shores, and they will affect the lives, the future and the destiny
of all the peoples of the world.

The New Message is here, in part, to affirm the importance of all the
world's religions and to proclaim that they are all initiated by God.
However far they may have wandered or deviated from the original intent,
they are still important for humanity's future and well being.

God is very wise in knowing what will work for the human family. As
author of the human family, this certainly makes sense. Therefore, the
first thing that should be stated and made clear is that all the world's
religions were initiated by God. They are all building blocks given to
different peoples at critical times in history. They have all pointed to
change in the overall evolution of the human family.

It is not that one religion is right and the rest are wrong. This cannot
be, for God knows that not every person in the world can follow one
teaching, one teacher, one prophet or one messenger. People still make
this mistake all the time, thinking that their faith is the real faith
or the only faith, the truest faith or the latest revelation. Yet they
are all part of a great series of gifts and messages to the human
family.

Unfortunately, the Divine intent in these messages, in all the religious
traditions of the world, both great and small, has been altered,
forgotten, overshadowed and overlaid by the intentions of those people
who have been the stewards and representatives of these traditions.
Something pure cannot remain in the world for very long before it seems
to become corrupted or used for personal and political advantages.

However, God understands this. God realizes that without Knowledge,
without an awareness of the greater intelligence that the Creator has
placed within all human minds and hearts, people will act selfishly,
foolishly and destructively. They will act without wisdom, without
foresight and without accountability. Yet there is no condemnation here.
If God knows that humanity is not developed enough, is not wise enough
and is not advanced enough to be able to purely maintain the intent of
each of the world's great traditions, then the idea of punishment has no
basis here.

It must be accepted that a certain amount of misappropriation and
misunderstanding occurs all the time. People will use religion for their
own ends and for their own purposes, whether these ends and purposes be
true to their Divine nature or not. The Creator of all life knows this
and understands this.

The first important thing to understand here is that all religions,
though they compete with one another, though they demean one another,
and though they may proclaim that they themselves are the one true
faith, have in fact and in reality been initiated by God. God has given
rise to them all. Like many rivers flowing into the sea, they are meant
to nourish all the lands and all the peoples of the world.

Only one who is truly mature in their own faith can see this. Otherwise,
they feel they must defend their faith against other faiths, setting in
motion competition, denial, criticism, mistrust and hatred. Certainly
this has happened in all cases. Yet the truth remains that God initiated
all the religions. And they are all meant to serve in bringing the
Divine presence, will and purpose into the minds and the hearts of
people everywhere, in different cultures, in different climates, to
people with very different social patterns and behaviors in all the eras
of history

The second thing to understand is that all the world's religions are
here to serve humanity, not to compete with one another, but to serve
humanity. To understand this statement, one must go to the very heart
and essence of what religion is and the difference between religion and
spirituality.

Spirituality is the spiritual reality and intelligence living within
each person. It is what the Creator of all life has given to each
person. In the New Message, spirituality is called Knowledge because it
is related to the ability to use this deeper intelligence, this deeper
awareness to see, to know and to act with integrity.

Religion is what has been created to give spirituality an opportunity to
be expressed and to be shared and to create an environment where
spirituality can be experienced and applied. It is like a house within
which spirituality can live-a structure, a pathway, a context, an
orientation. That is the purpose of religion.

Of course, people do not understand this very well at all. They think
religion and spirituality are one and the same. Yet they are really
different because spirituality is created by God. Religions are
introduced by God but are brought into form and organization by people
and are maintained by people whose knowledge of God is far from
developed or perfect. Therefore, spirituality remains infallible;
religion will always be fallible. God understands this. Yet people do
not.

However religion may have been altered, changed or misused, it is still
vitally important, for it must be the vehicle through which spirituality
finds its truest and greatest expression. In this, the religious
traditions of the world, despite their many errors, despite whatever
corruption and misapplication may have occurred, still remain vitally
important for the human family as vehicles through which spirituality
can be expressed and shared. It is through these traditions that God's
wisdom, the wisdom of Knowledge, can be applied to the practical and
personal needs of people everywhere.

The New Message from God is here to proclaim the unity and importance of
all religions and to make it very clear that any competition or conflict
that may exist between them is born of human ignorance and lack of
awareness of God's true intent in initiating these avenues of
expression. It would indeed be a great tragedy if humanity were to
continue to use these great avenues of expression to compete with each
other as weapons of war, as weapons of advantage, as leverage used by
one nation and tribe over another.

Religion absorbs the cultural traditions, the general attitudes, the
customs and the language of people wherever it is applied, wherever it
has been established. This muddies the stream even further. Now you have
religions mixed with culture, with politics, with economics, with family
ties and with tribal allegiances, As a result, the essence of religion
and the harmony between religions become lost.

Part of the purpose of the New Message from God is to give the clarity
of the original intent of religion back to humanity as a significant
reminder. However, this clarity is given not simply as a moral
prerogative, but as a vital necessity for humanity to be able to
navigate the difficult times ahead and the great waves of change that
are coming. Humanity must find its strength and its unity, for it is
only a united humanity that will be able to survive the great challenges
that are coming. This does not mean that everyone has the same religion,
the same culture, the same language, the same customs or the same
society or social structure. Yet it does mean that everyone recognizes
that by working together, they can succeed and by being in conflict with
each other, they will fail. Religion is meant to play a very important
part in bringing this greater unity about. Therefore, be very clear that
any group or any person that claims that God hates another religion or
another group of people studying another religion is ignorant of God's
will and purpose in the world.

Now it is necessary to speak of a third point that is important, that
must be emphasized and that is part of the New Message from God. This
has to do with error, sin and punishment. As it has been stated, God is
aware that humanity will make mistakes and will continue to make
mistakes and that some of these mistakes will be very grievous and
tragic. God understands that without Knowledge, without an awareness of
one's real spirituality unalloyed with political ambition and
uncorrupted by personal motives, people will make mistakes. They will
err; they will miss the mark; they will sin. So how could it be then
that God would punish those who make the very mistakes that God knows
that they will make?

This would make God out to be cruel, a God that takes pleasure in
punishment. Unfortunately, many people believe that God is revengeful
and angry and will punish the wicked in eternal damnation. Yet how can
an all-merciful God do this? It does not make sense. It does not make
sense because it is not real, it is not true.

Bible verses for today
http://www.landoverbaptist.org/bible-verses.gif
How can you apply these biblical truths to your life?

Children Punished for Their Father's Sins
Please, Lord, prove that your power is as great as you have claimed
it to be.  For you said, &quot;The LORD is slow to anger and rich in
unfailing love, forgiving every kind of sin and rebellion.  Even so he
does not leave sin unpunished, but he punishes the children for the sins
of their parents to the third and fourth generations.&quot;
(Numbers 14:17-18 NLT)

--------------------

Certainly those who commit crimes against others, whose destructive
behavior causes pain, suffering and injustice, must be restrained within
their cultures and even confined if necessary. But never think that this
makes God angry. Indeed, if God were really angry, God would be most
angry with religious leaders who misuse the great traditions that God
has inspired and set in motion. Yet even this is not the case For how
can God hate part of God's creation? God can only love God's creation,
and that part of God's creation that does not love God just misses out
on the whole experience.

This brings us now to the next point of clarification: you do not return
to the Creator because you have claimed allegiance or belief. You do not
return to the Creator because you say the right words. You do not return
to the Creator because you have sacrificed yourself, though sometimes
that may be necessary. You do not return to God because you have adhered
to all the right thinking, because you have accepted all the religious
teachings or because you have followed all of the guidelines.

If your heart is not open, if your mind is not free of hatred, envy and
prejudice, how can you return to your Heavenly state? You cannot return
to your Heavenly state with a mind that is full of conflict, anger and
revenge. There is no place in Heaven for that.

Therefore, you have to wait until you can discover the greater Knowledge
that God placed within you and allow it to guide your actions, give you
direction and bridge the gap between your mind and your spirit.

If you think that you are going to Heaven because you were a good boy or
a good girl, you are mistaken. You will not find a way to Heaven with
that attitude, simply because that is not the state of mind that allows
you to be in Heaven.

You can only be where you really are in life, and if where you are is a
place of anger, discord and resentment, then you are living in your own
hell already.

You come to God because you follow what God has given you, what God has
put inside of you, what God has created within you-your spirituality,
your Knowledge, which is not merely some ephemeral spirit, but instead a
greater intelligence. The Creator of all life has given this greater
intelligence to all who have come into the world.

Each person has a destiny in being here. If you can find this destiny,
if you can follow Knowledge, if you can honor what God has put within
you-even if it seems inexplicable, even if it doesn't conform to
religious principles, practices or beliefs of your local culture, tribe
or nation-then you are beginning to honor your sacred relationship with
the Divine.

Now you are expressing your spirituality, and if this expression is
authentic and true, you will inspire others. You will inspire
compassion. You will inspire contribution. You will inspire awareness of
the needs of others. You will develop empathy for others. These are
aspects of the true expression of spirituality.

Here you will not use your spirituality to generate war, to kill or to
maim. These purposes are generated by political forces and entities.

This is what brings you to God. However far you advance in regaining
your ancient relationship with Knowledge, that is how close you will
come to God and to your Heavenly state.

Many people think that if you have adequate belief, then it will bring
you to God. Yet belief is only of the mind. It is fallible. It is
subject to manipulation. It is arrogant. It is supercilious. Belief here
is a substitute for Knowledge. You will need some degree of belief to
hold to the truth that Knowledge is within you. This is appropriate.
However, never think that belief alone will bring you back to God or
honor your Divine relationship with God.

This brings us back to the issue of sin and punishment. As it has been
said, God is all-merciful, and God knows all the mistakes you have made
and will make. So how can there be punishment from God? And what is hell
but living in the nightmare of your own imagination, your own cruel
self-punishment and the punishment of others. Many people believe that
if you are true to your religion, you will go to Heaven. And if you are
not, you will go to hell. But this is not accurate. It is a denial of
the mercy and wisdom of God.

What redemption truly means is that if you find and follow the greater
intelligence within yourself, which in the New Message is called
Knowledge, you will be moving towards Heaven, you will be moving towards
God and you will be moving towards re-establishing your own personal
integrity and inner harmony.

However, if you move away from Knowledge within yourself, then you will
be further away from that which is here to redeem you. Here you will
just stay where you are-lost, alone, forlorn, afraid of death, afraid of
life, afraid of everything around you. If you stay in this state of
existence, then you are living in your own hell. You are in hell
already. You could create a worse hell for yourself, certainly. There
seems to be no end to which people will promote suffering within
themselves and others. If you choose to remain in hell, you cannot
return to the Heavenly state. There is no place in Heaven for the angry,
the vengeful, the conflicted, the self-denying or the self-hating-states
of mind which are so prevalent in the world today.

It is not God who metes out the punishment. It is people using
punishment in the name of God, who punish in the name of God. The New
Message proclaims that the wicked are not punished but are prepared for
Heaven. How different this is from the teachings of the world.

Some people cannot accept this because their hearts are full of anger
and they want God to take revenge, to exercise the revenge that they
themselves want to see brought about. However, the New Message says no,
God does not punish. You are simply left out of the graces of God and
the guidance of God. Your misbehavior, your errors, your sins, if you
will, keep you apart. They leave you out.

This is important to understand, for the times ahead will be very
difficult. People will be under tremendous stress. There will be loss
and deprivation. The risk of competition, conflict and war will be very
great.

How will the religions of the world treat this? Will they merely be
tools of the state, giving moral or religious approval to the political
forces who govern them? Or will they be moderating forces working
against injustice, intolerance, conflict and war?

The New Message from God is not here to compete with other religions as
if it were just another horse in the horse race. It is to be a blessing
for all the world's religions and to emphasize what is at the very core
of them all. The core of all religions is the truth and the reality of
God's creation of your spirituality and of the intelligence of your
spirituality. The Creator has given you this gift of Knowledge to guide
you, to correct your errors and to lead you in a positive direction so
that you may find your true purpose and contribution in life.

The truth is that there is only One Spirituality in the human family,
created by God. Any competition surrounding this is a human invention
and not a Divine invention. The truth is that God has been
misrepresented in the sacred texts. Promoting war and destruction cannot
come from a merciful God. However, the emphasis on human unity,
compassion, contribution and the need to share with others is timeless
and is part of all the religious traditions.

This is the essence of what the Creator has given all religious
traditions, along with a simple pathway to follow in order to find this
deeper spirituality, this deeper Knowledge within one's self and within
others.

These pathways will all be greatly needed in the future, for humanity
cannot afford competition, conflict and war now.

There will be no winners if the world is further depleted. If
competition and conflict continue, then everyone will suffer. Everyone
everywhere will be deprived, and the human family will undergo a greater
travail than it has ever known. In such a situation, the human family
will be vulnerable to intervention, such as is happening at this time,
from forces from beyond the world.

The New Message from God is not meant to compete with other religions,
but to bless them all and to amplify what has been placed within them
all, that unites them all and that allows them to resonate with one
another so that they may enrich one another. In this way, they may be in
harmony rather than competing for dominance within a spiritual
marketplace.

How will you know that there is a New Message from God in the world? You
will know because of what it teaches. You will know by its fruits. And
you will know at a deeper level within yourself. Whether the New Message
conforms to your beliefs, assumptions and ideals or not, there is a
deeper resonance to be found.

God wills that humanity now unite in order to prepare for the difficult
times ahead, to prepare for great travail, to prepare for a Greater
Darkness that is in the world. God wills that unity and cooperation, the
sharing of resources and the mutual assistance between nations be wisely
establish in order to maintain stability and to avoid war. God wills
that the world's resources be preserved so that humanity may have a
future. And God wills that humanity begin its preparation for its
destined contact with intelligent life from beyond the world and to take
the steps to establish its future as a free and sovereign race within a
Greater Community of intelligent life.

These are the great needs that have brought a New Message from God into
the world. As things stand at this moment, what else but a New Message
from God can give a new direction and greater unity to human
understanding and human affairs?

Throughout the world, throughout the human family, there are individuals
who understand these things. However, at present everything is moving
towards breakdown and chaos. This has brought a New Message from God
into the world.

This short message is for the religious leaders of the world, and for
anyone else who seeks to understand the will of the Divine and what God
has created already.

There is a vast demonstration of wisdom, compassion, selflessness,
contribution and forgiveness-everything that the Creator has already
given into the world to give humanity a greater chance and a greater
promise. Now all humanity stands at the threshold of success or
failure-success or failure living in the world and success or failure
dealing with intelligent life from beyond the world. That is why a New
Message from God has been sent into the world.

If you are mature within your own faith tradition, you will be able to
read the New Message and to consider it. It is here to honor you and to
honor all that has been given to your tradition, to give it greater
amplification, greater focus and new direction in preparation for a
future that will be unlike the past.

Math: Gift from God or Work of Man?
Mathematics, Religion and Evolution in School Curricula
By John Allen Paulos
Sept. 2, 2007
http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/story?id=3543453&amp;page;=1

School begins again, and we read more about the intrusion of
pseudoscience into school science curricula in this country,
particularly into the study of biology and evolution.

The motive, despite the claims of proponents of intelligent design and
other bogus &quot;disciplines,&quot; has been religious. Although some of the
creation scientists' arguments presented have a probabilistic flavor,
the mathematics curriculum has seemed somewhat resistant to this trend.
Recently a number of readers have sent me course descriptions from
various schools that suggest otherwise, however.

The issue is complicated (perhaps too complicated for a column), but
I'll also briefly discuss the relevance of evolution to a more
defensible, but still flawed argument relating religion and mathematics.

Religion in the Math Curriculum

Consider first a Baptist school in Texas whose description of a geometry
course begins:
Students will examine the nature of God as they progress in their
understanding of mathematics. Students will understand the absolute
consistency of mathematical principles and know that God was the
inventor of that consistency. They will see God's nature revealed in the
order and precision they review foundational concepts while being able
to demonstrate geometric thinking and spatial reasoning. The study of
the basics of geometry through making and testing conjectures regarding
mathematical and real-world patterns will allow the students to
understand the absolute consistency of God as seen in the geometric
principles he created.

I wonder if the school teaches that non-Euclidean geometry is the work
of the devil or at least of non-Christians.

The Web site's account goes on like this for a while and then is
followed by similar descriptions for algebra and pre-calculus. The blurb
for the calculus course states:

Students will examine the nature of God as they progress in their
understanding of mathematics. Students will understand the absolute
consistency of mathematical principles and know that God was the
inventor of that consistency. Mathematical study will result in a
greater appreciation of God and His works in creation. The students will
understand the basic ideas of both differential and integral calculus
and its importance and historical applications. The students will
recognize that God created our minds to be able to see that the universe
can be calculated by mental methods.

I don't know what books this particular school uses, but I should
mention such risible texts such as &quot;Precalculus for Christian Schools.&quot;
The latter attempts to draw parallels between the fundamental theorem of
calculus and the fundamentals of Christianity, between infinity and life
after death, et cetera.

Everyone's heard of church schools and Madrassas, but another example of
this phenomenon from a quite different religious perspective is the
Maharishi University in Iowa, whose course titles and descriptions are
similarly bizarre. Here are some on their Web site:

Infinity: From the Empty Set to the Boundless Universe of All Sets --
Exploring the Full Range of Mathematics and Seeing its Source in Your
Self
Intermediate Algebra: Using Variables to Manage the Total Possibility of
Numbers and Solve Practical Problems

Its New Age calculus sequence is described thus:
Calculus 1: Derivatives as the Mathematics of Transcending, Used to
Handle Changing Quantities
Calculus 2: Integrals as the Mathematics of Unification, Used to Handle
Wholeness
Calculus 3: Unified Management of Change in All Possible Directions
Calculus 4: Locating Silence within Dynamism

Evolution, a Counterargument to the Divine Nature of Mathematics

Of course, there are more sophisticated ideas that are vaguely similar,
and there have been first-rate scientists who have taken mathematics to
be some sort of divine manifestation. One of the most well-known such
arguments is due to physicist Eugene Wigner. In his famous 1960 paper,
&quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,&quot;
he maintained that ability of mathematics to describe and predict the
physical world is no accident, but rather is evidence of a deep and
mysterious harmony.

But is the usefulness of mathematics really so mysterious? There is a
quite compelling alternative explanation why mathematics is so useful.
We count, we measure, we employ basic logic, and these activities are
stimulated by ubiquitous aspects of the physical world. The size of a
collection (of stones, grapes, animals), for example, is associated with
the size of a number and keeping track of it leads to counting. Putting
collections together is associated with adding numbers, and so on.

Another metaphor associates the familiar realm of measuring sticks
(small branches, say, or pieces of string) with the more abstract one of
geometry, The length of a stick is associated with the size of a number
(once some segment is associated with the number one), and relations
between the numbers associated with a triangle, say, are noted. (Scores
of such metaphors underlying more advanced mathematical disciplines have
been developed by linguist George Lakoff and psychologist Rafael Nunez
in their book, &quot;Where Mathematics Comes From.&quot;)

Once part of human practice, these various notions are abstracted,
idealized and formalized to create basic mathematics, and the deductive
nature of mathematics then makes this formalization useful in realms to
which it is only indirectly related.

The universe acts on us, we adapt to it, and the notions that we develop
as a result, including the mathematical ones, are in a sense taught us
by the universe. That great bugbear of creationists, evolution has
selected those of our ancestors (both human and not) whose behavior and
thought are consistent with the workings of the universe. The usefulness
of mathematics is thus not so unreasonable.

There are, of course, many other views of mathematics (Platonism,
formalism, et cetera), but whatever one's philosophy of the subject, the
curricula cited above and others like them are a bit absurd, even funny.
In private schools they're none of our business. This is not so if
aspects of these &quot;creation math&quot; curricula slip into the public schools,
a prospect no doubt devoutly wished for by some.

The devine beauty of math

Brilliant, isn't it?
And look at this symmetry:

111111111 x 111111111=123456789 87654321

Now, take a look at this.
101%
From a strictly mathematical viewpoint:
What Equals 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%?
Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more
than 100%?
We have all been in situations where someone wants you to GIVE
OVER 100%.
How about ACHIEVING 101%?
What equals 100% in life?
Here's a little mathematical formula that might help answer
these questions:

If:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Is represented as:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
25 26.
If:
H-A-R-D-W-O- R- K
8+1+18+4+23+ 15+18+11 = 98%
And:
K-N-O-W-L-E- D-G-E
11+14+15+23+ 12+5+4+7+ 5 = 96%
But:
A-T-T-I-T-U- D-E
1+20+20+9+20+ 21+4+5 = 100%

THEN, look how far the love of God will take you:
L-O-V-E-O-F- G-O-D
12+15+22+5+15+ 6+7+15+4 = 101%

Therefore, one can conclude with mathematical certainty that:
While Hard Work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get
you there, It's the Love of God that will put you over the top!

Ultimate God FAQ
After centuries of study, a compilation of everything which
is known about god has been compiled in this ultimate God FAQ:
http://www.400monkeys.com/God/index.html

That means there is no demonstrable cognative evidence.
If you have better information, report it here:

&quot;But just what is the core of (the atheist or god-free) radical message?
Well, it goes something like this: If you claim that something is true,
I will examine the evidence which supports your claim; if you have no
evidence, I will not accept that what you say is true and I will think
you a foolish and gullible person for believing it so.&quot;
--Dan Gardner

Faith = belief with NO evidence
Reason: evidence required for belief
Evolution = natural selection
Intelligent design = supernatural selection

Why does it take so long for people to evolve into the world of reason,
where evidence is required for belief? Agnostics and atheists need not
apply for public office in the United States. Public office applicants
must appear to believe in imaginary supernatural beings, and live in the
world of faith, where no evidence is required for belief. Would you want
a President who was a born-again fundamentalist evangelical Christian
who believes he is doing the will of his favorite imaginary supernatural
being? When no evidence is required for the most improbable of beliefs,
that seems like a poor way to run a family, business or a country. Yet
people who live in the world of reason are disrespected and the subject
of scorn in the USA while those who profess to do the will of imaginary
supernatural beings are respected. It seems backwards to me. I want my
leaders to live in the world of reason.
