Unlike in my language (Danish) you often see headlines in book
chapters and in newspapers which have almost all words in
capital letters. Is there any rule for this in English, e.g.

An Introduction to Applied Linguistics - or: An introduction
to applied linguistics or An Introduction To Applied
Linguistics ?

If there are any rules for this, please inform me about it, if
possible

The only rule on this that I'm aware of is the rule of consistency:
whatever is done with the heading on Chapter One should be done with
the heading on all subsequent chapters.

There are several rules; pick one set and be consistent.

A lot of technical or learned writing does not do the capitalization
thing for titles or headings, capitalizing only the first word and
proper nouns.  The same way that capitalization is done in ordinary
running text.

The method common to books and magazine articles for popular
consumption is called &quot;headline style.&quot;
1. Capitalize the first word, as one would for a sentence.
2. Do not capitalize the articles (a, an, the).
3. Do not capitalize short prepositions (on, off, in...four letters or
fewer).  Long prepositions are usually capitalized (around, through...
six letters or more).  Yes, that leaves prepositions having five
letters out; &quot;about&quot; is capitalized by some and not capitalized by
others.

An Introduction to Applied Linguistics (if mentioned in running text:
italicized if that is the title of the book; in quotation marks if
that is the title of an article in a magazine or journal or the title
of a chapter in a book) would be very common.

An introduction to applied linguistics would not be unusual in a
journal (&quot;journal&quot; meaning a magazine that has articles of interest to
scholars of a particular field, a magazine for specialists) as the
title of the article, or in running text in an article that refers to
the book or article that has that title.

An Introduction To Applied Linguistics is incorrect.

Those are really conventions, not rules.  They become rules when they
are specified in a style manual, but only rules for that publication.

">

In Denmark we have a certain &quot;office&quot; which controll how the
language is used and which publish dictionaries about the
correct way of spelling Danish. I don't think you have a
similar institution in England or in the USA. This may lead to
some different opinions about what is correct English and what
is not.

You'll probably remember a heatedly discussion between some
English native speakers and one American native speaker, both
claiming that you could /could not say this sentence in
English:

He must have been being interviewed.

The English claimed that this was grammatical and the American
said that it was ungrammatical.

It is therefore very difficult to tell who is right when
talking about English grammar and conventions.

What I just wanted was to find out whether the definite
articles and the prepositions in general were written with
capitals in headlines, which I have seen several times, and
which are not - and when.

I have a book with the title: &quot;Foreign Language Acquistition
Research and the Classroom&quot;

Here I can see that all the words are written with capital
letters except for the conjunction and the definite article.

What I wanted to understand was /when/ or /if/ these
observations were general in headlines.

I am satisfied with the rules I have learned, but I am aware
of the fact that the rule differ sometimes, and a certain
conventional canon might not exist.

It is´interesting, however, that the headline :

&quot;Foreign Language Acquisition Research And The Classroom&quot; is
not correct, so some conventions or rules still prevail in my
way of thinking.

On the other hand it might also be wrong! :-0

The opinion that conjunctions, definte/indefinite articles and
some prepositions with letters less than or equal with 4
letters do not demand capital letters, and that prepositions
with 5 or more letters usually demands capitals - but words as
e.g. about can be used with both capital letter and without in
a headline.

The New York Times capitalises all the words in its headlines and is the
only newspaper I know of that does so. Presumably this is a tradition whose

Not so. It does not capitalize &quot;a&quot;,&quot;in&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, and a whole bunch of
others (except when they begin the headline).  It does capitalize
*most* words in headlines.  I'm sure its stylebook covers the

You're right, of course - I shot from the hip without checking. But they do
capitalise a lot of small words which others do not, and that is what
misled me.

There are lots of style manuals online.

The APA style manual is, I think, the one from the American
Psychological Association.  Unless it's the one of similar name that
is used by newspapers; newspapers do not use italic type and
streamline typesetting in other ways too. http://apastyle.apa.org/

One of the most revered is the Chicago Manual of Style, which was
originally the house style of some company or other.  It is online
here: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html

Another of the most revered is the MLA Formatting and Style Guide.  I
don't know why people think highly of it, unless the bits of it I have
been told are the informants' misunderstandings.  Here it is:
http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/557/01/

Then there is Strunk &amp; White, but I don't find a current edition
online, only the original 1918 edition.

Yes, we can answer questions of this type.  But be careful with the
answers!

There really isn't a difference as far as what type of discussions go

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
alt.usage.english and alt.english.usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We are sometimes asked why there are two newsgroups with
similar names. We don't know; it may have been an error.
We are also asked what the difference is between the two
groups. We are not aware of any official policy
differences; participants of both groups report that
alt.usage.english has significantly more traffic. Beyond
that, you can make your own judgements about atmosphere,
attitudes, personalities of current contributors, etc.

I read both newsgroups. When I start a new thread I will
usually post the message to alt.usage.english. If I think
that it would be useful to get the opinions of people in
alt.english.usage I will crosspost the message to both
groups. I will not send separate messages to the two groups.

&gt; &gt;Thank you - but one thing bothers me: I have asked in an
&gt; &gt;earlier text what the difference is between alt. english.usage
&gt; &gt;and alt. usage. english and have only got an answer telling
&gt; &gt;that there is no difference at all. At least this is what I
&gt; &gt;have understood.

&gt; &gt;I would very much like to know the difference so I shall be
&gt; &gt;able to post future texts in the right group.

&gt; There really isn't a difference as far as what type of discussions go
&gt; on in each group.  Alt.usage.english has more readers, and that's
&gt; about it.  Some readers read both groups.
">

Alt.usage.english doesn't just have &quot;more readers.&quot;  It has, on a
typical day, more than ten times the volume of alt.english.usage.  Any
given question posted to AUE is likely to get far more answers than
the same question posted to AEU, and in general you'll also find a
much greater depth of knowledge at AUE.  If your purpose in posting is
to get useful answers to questions about English, I recommend AUE over
AEU.

You could also post the same inquiry simultaneously to both groups.
(Not one post each; a single post with both as addressees.)  This will
get you responses from participants in both.

I guess I should have italicized &quot;ten times,&quot; which IMO is a little
more than just &quot;more.&quot;  That was my principal point.  I guess I'm not
the rhetorician I used to be (if I ever was).

Yeah, but that figure includes (nameless person who might come back if
summoned) and several others who are seldom of help to anyone.  You
may or may not include me in that count.

I'll be watching your posts to see if you exhibit greater depth of
knowledge when posting to aue.  Write in simple sentences, though, on
uncomplicated issues.  My ability to discern depth of knowledge is
limited.  Note that I have no sheep to my credit.

&gt;v&gt;&gt; And; in this group there are many native speakers who
&gt;might
&gt;&gt;&gt; know something about it - it is not forbidden to ask, is
&gt;&gt;&gt; it?

&gt;&gt; You are absolutely right . There is no reason on earth why
&gt;&gt; you should not ask this sort of question here (though you
&gt;&gt; might find alt.usage.english better). Nearly everything that
&gt;&gt; people ask could be answered with a silly suggestion to
&gt;&gt; consult a manual, but when the question has a general
&gt;&gt; interest and has potential for dicussion then it's entirely
&gt;&gt; appropriate.

&gt;Thank you - but one thing bothers me: I have asked in an
&gt;earlier text what the difference is between alt. english.usage
&gt;and alt. usage. english and have only got an answer telling
&gt;that there is no difference at all. At least this is what I

The difference is mainly in the feel of the two groups.

AUE has more prolific posters, more in-jokes, and more likelyhood that
a question or post will spin off into digressions on linguistic
history, he relative merits of various language theories, or a
completely off-topic  topic, like manual transmissions in cars. It
also has much more traffic (more posts each day.)

AEU has fewer posters, and more likely that the queston will be
answered by people saying &quot;This is the way I've always heard it used,&quot;
or &quot;No, you want a subjunctive there, so use &lt;foo&gt; instead of &lt;bar&gt;,&quot;
without quoting chapter and verse of 6 different grammar books.
