AUTUMN RANGERS: A Conservative Novel With a Classic American Hero,
Rhyming Poetry, Words That Mean Things, and a Plot

AUTUMN RANGERS

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Elliot,
&gt; Thanks again for doing this e-mail interview. Please
&gt; answer the questions and then e-mail them back to me
&gt; by Saturday! Thanks.
&gt; 1. What is the main idea of your book?

"/>

A renaissance. Our generation has grown up in an era
wherein higher ideals and classic truths have been all
but banished. Autumn and Ranger come to realize this
as they drive cross country on the run, and they
decide to fight for the renaissance as &quot;Autumn
Rangers.&quot; An Autumn Ranger is someone who calls the
contemporary consumeristic bluff and lives for the
higher ideals. An Autumn Ranger is a romantic
striving for a renaissance, wherein words mean things
and promises last forever, and this is the book's
subplot.

The plot is more tangible. US Marine Ranger McCoy
invented APRIL, an advanced computer with artificial
intelligence. While he's serving overseas as a
fighter pilot, Silicon Virtue Inc. steals APRIL from
his MIT lab and takes her to Doom Mountain in Death
Valley, where she is put to work creating WMD's. To
save her, Ranger must activate her deeper moral soul
named Beatrice. Ranger wears the ring with the codes
to Beatrice.

He is shot down over Afghanistan, and like Odysseus,
Ranger surmounts impossible obstacles to journey on
back home. But once back in the US, he's on the run
again, as Silicon Virtue agents come for his ring.

As he journeys across America, he meets Autumn, a
mysterious folk singer with knowledge ranging from
classical art to the martial arts. She helps him
elude agents, and they fall for one-another. But love
ain't easy, and in addition to activitating Beatrice
in APRIL, he must win Autumn's heart by resurrecting
her forgotten faith.

And a classic twist in the book unites the plot and
subplot in a head-on collision. Winnining Autumn's
heart and saving APRIL's soul turn out to be one and
the same.

&gt; 2. How long did it take to write the book?

"/>

About four years.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. This is your first book, correct? Will you be
&gt; writing more? Is this your true calling?

"/>

This is actually my fourth book. I have previously
published a novel, a poetry book, and a collection of
essays. They're all available in major bookstores
such as amazon.com, powells.com, and bn.com.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. Why is it important for college students to read
&gt; your book? Does it connect with them at some level?

"/>

This generation needs a renaissance. We need to move
beyond postmodernism in our art and literature, in our
relationships and lives.

Hollywood is in decline. NY publishing is in decline.
The traditional family is in decline. As Aristotle
observed thousands of years ago, when storytelling
goes bad, the result is decadence.

Autumn Rangers is a journey into the realm of the
Great Books and Classics, but it's set in the
contemporary context, complete with hiphop,
text-messaging, and Avril Lavigne. It performs the
eternal ideals in the living language, and invites
students to live the classical principles.

Autumn Rangers is meant to inspire and exalt.
Students own the future, and it's up to you to build a
Hollywood renaissance. Head west and become a
director, a producer, or screenwriter, and revive the
classic myths in the living language. Or journey up
to NY and become an editor, agent, writer, or
publisher.

Less and less people are reading literary books, but
we can change that, by letting literature live once
again, by letting her reach for immortality via
classical stories. Resurrect the ideals and classic
values that remind us of what it is to live on a
higher plain. Become an Autumn Ranger!

We, as a society, have forgotten how to tell stories,
as we've dismissed the eternal ideals common to the
great books and classics. The Hollywood boxoffice
just suffered its worst year in this era, and the
literary novel has long ago gone out of vogue--both
have been affected by postmodernism--the nihilistic
idea that higher truths and values don't exist. The
eternal ideals must be perpetually performed in the
living language, and that's what Autumn Rangers does.

Autumn Rangers is a contemporary portal on out to that
community of eternal souls. Written in a rich context
with themes borrowed from Dante's Inferno, the
Odyssey, and the Count of Monte Christo, Autumn
Rangers is the education that was once given at the
university.

If you're going to work in Hollywood and build a
renaissance out there, you're going to need to know
the classics, such as Aristotle, Shakespeare, and the
Bible--just like Cecil B. Demille, Mel Gibson, and
George Lucas did. If you're going to become a
lawyer, and strive for justice, you're going to need
to know the classics, such as Shakespeare, Aristotle,
and the Bible--just like Lincoln, Jefferson, and
Madison did.

Autumn Rangers is written within this rich context.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5. What is the most important lesson learned from
&gt; the book?

"/>

Call the bluff and follow your dreams--you are the one
chance your dreams have of becoming real. Truth is
beauty and beauty truth. People might try to tell you
otherwise, but call their bluff. Become that Autumn
Ranger, win Autumn's heart, and save APRIL's soul.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 6. Where did you go to college? What did you major
&gt; in?

"/>

I went to Princeton. I majored in physics but took a
creative writing class each semester. I had Joyce
Carol Oates, Russell Banks, and Toni Morrison as
professors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 7. Any other comments or quotes you would like in
&gt; the article?

"/>

The renaissance is yours for the taking.

Best,

Dr. E
