I have two questions that are unrelated one from the other and have
little to do with BF, but since you are all great and experienced
mothers (and fathers) I want your opinion and your expertise.

DD Ilona is not 17mths,  she still BF early morning and before bedtime
and very seldom at nap time, only when she is really tired and stuburn
about going to bed.  Until about 2 months ago she was very consistant
with her naps,  she fell asleep at noon and would sleep for an hour or
two, then would wake up for lunch.  All of the sudden she started going
to sleep later at 3pm until 5pm which changed her bedtime to a later
hour.  I was OK with this, even though I did not like the fact that she
was going to sleep at night a around 9:30, as before she would be in
bed by 8:30.  I usually had time to catch a movie or go to the
groceries store after she fell asleep, but not anymore, (no 24hr store
where I live).   She now  seems to be changing her sleeping habbits
again, it has been two days that she has not napped, and therefore has
fallen asleep at night at arround 8pm.   Is it OK at this age for her
not to nap?  Are naps really important at this age,  Ilona has had a
very consistan life with all her schedules, such as feeding, naps,
bathing etc.  Would it be OK for some days to nap and not others and
not continue with such strict patterns.  I don't mind her not taking a
nap, in fact if it will make her go to bed sooner I woudl prefer, but I
am not sure she is old enough to not nap.

My other question is that Ilona is not speaking much.  We live in a
Spanish speaking country and we only speak Spanish in the house,
although all of TV watching is in English.  But her only words are teta
(boob), agua (water) mama (mommy) papa (daddy and she also reffers to
french fries).  And that is pretty much it.  everything else she
communicates by pointing and I am starting to get worried on her
limited vocabulary.  She understands a lot however and she follows
instructions pretty well, Is this OK, how extensive should her
vocabulary be at this age???

Thank you in advance for your suggestions and your previouas experince.

Hi --

When kids start to need fewer naps, they often have nap days and no-nap
days.  Not a problem as long as she's not cranky.  If she IS cranky on
no-nap days, try giving her shorter naps.  Wake her after 90 minutes, or
60 minutes.  (She'll hate it the first few times and be hard to rouse,
but then she'll get used to it and wake on her own  if the shorter nap
is a good idea for her.)

Language ... if she understands what's said, then speaking little is
fine at 17 months.  Many kids don't speak much until after 24 months of
age.  She understands, follows simple instructions (when she feels like
it) and speaks a little.  Sounds normal.

On the other hand, if you want her to speak English as well as Spanish,
I'd start speaking English to her pretty soon.  Kids can handle two
different languages in the home.  But to learn, the languages have so be
spoken to her by people. TV won''t help her.

I hope this helps,

it doesn't matter much. but if she is cranky try giving her some thing
to cure gas.is she active. my kid sleeps well when i let him do a lot
of phsical workout like moving about. trying new things. if she is
happy and not passive its ok.
child may not speak till too old. try getting her to play with kids in
lang u want her to learn. she will learn faster.
bye

re: Language - how much TV is watched/listened to? Enough that it's
like a second language in the house? I ask because it's pretty normal
for a child in a bilingual household to not speak either language well
until later than their peers, but they understand both. It's much
easier to understand than to speak (so says she who has learned 4 other
languages enough to moderatel understand, but speaking is much
harder!).

My 'bilingual' DD is far too young still, but many of my friends are
raising their kids in a bilingual house, and this has been their
experience.

That said, TV is certainly not necessary to reinforce a language,
obviously, but perhaps it's just enough of an introduction to English
that she's got the two in her head. Not a problem, really. It's clear
she *can* speak, since she's got some words.  Eventually her Spanish
will become more dominant: the more she interacts with Spanish speaking
people, the more she'll speak. You might try to encourage it by telling
her the word when she points at something, encourage her to repeat it,
before you get it for her.

ANd if you want her to be bilingual, start speaking English to her as
well. People differ on how they think this is best done. IMO, I think
having one parent speak only in one language while the other speaks in
another language is best for limiting confusion. Locally, nearly
everyone is bilingual, but for many who grew up here (Texas) with
parents who also grew up here and were bilingual, it's this weird form
of Spanglish that is fluent in neither language mainly because the
parents spoke both all the time and mixed it up. The kids of immigrants
whose parents only spoke one language but grew up in an English
speaking area, speak both fluently.

I've hear a rule of thumb:

During their second year (while they are one) they should speak one word
at a time.
During their third year they should speak in two word sentences.
During their fourth year they should speak so the family understands them
And during their fifth year they should speak so other people understand
them.

And your mileage may vary.

it would be unusual for a baby her age to not need to nap, I would probably
continue to attempt to get her to nap for a while longer, it's possible you
are actually putting her down too late for a nap, once they get overtired,
they tend to resist much more!

different doctors expect slightly different things at this age, ranging from
about 5-20 words at 18mths, so she'll probably be at the bottom end of that
by 18mths, there is an enormous variation so doctors are more concerned
about something being a flag for a problem then most babies will still not
actually have a problem and just be slow. My daughter is 19mths, at her
18mths check she had basically no words, she now has 2, but they are much
more mimiced than actually spoken, but all other indications are that she is
fine, her hearing is normal, she understands stuff, possibly even exhibits
good understanding for her age, she communicates a lot non verbally, she
just happens to be a slow talker, we'll have to keep an eye on things etc.
but once hearing and other development has been checked, speech alone is not
a cause for concern and from all the things you are saying, it sounds like
she is fine, just on the lower end of normal for number of words and it's
not really predictive about anything in the future, my DS was technically
behind at age 2, but at 2.5 was way ahead, because that was when he had is
language explosion.

and it may vary a lot, my son went in the space of six months from when he
turned 2, through all of those, being late at the start because he only did
one word at a time, then wham bam, right through them all. Late for one
milestone does not imply late for all milestones.
