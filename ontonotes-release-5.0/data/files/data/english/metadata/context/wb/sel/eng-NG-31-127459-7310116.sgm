* MOSES AND THE EXODUS *
************************

On Passover, millions of Jews throughout the world will be
sitting with family and guests around brightly lit, festive tables,
eating matzah and bitter herbs, drinking four cups of wine and
reminding each other about the miracles G-d did for the Jews.

They will be celebrating the holiday of Passover for the 3,319th
time in history.

Every year since the exodus from Egypt, millions of Jews have
never missed a year of Passover Seder.

One of the most basic commandments of the Passover Seder is to
tell the story of going out of Egypt. In addition to this being an
integral part of the Seder night, remembering that G-d took us out
of Egypt is obligatory not only on Passover, but on every day of
the year. It is a foundation of Judaism, being the first of the Ten
Commandments.

The Sages compiled the Haggadah in order to facilitate this
vital commandment. Throughout the text of the Haggadah, G-d is
mentioned continuously for the incredible miracles that He did for
the Jews. In fact, G-d did everything; he was the "star" of the
Exodus.

Strangely, however, the main protagonist of the Exodus, Moses,
is mentioned only once in the entire Haggadah!

Had it not been for Moses, the Jewish people would have never
left Egypt at all. And even after they left, were it not for Moses,
they would have returned to Egypt.

While it was G-d Who wrought all of the miracles of the plagues,
the splitting of the sea, the manna and more, it was Moses who kept
the Jewish people inspired. In fact, when the Jews thought that
Moses had left them at Mount Sinai, they worshiped the Golden Calf,
despite G-d's Omniscience and omnipresence.

So why isn't Moses given more credit in the Haggadah? Because it
was Moses' job to do only one thing; to interpret the miracles that
G-d wrought in a way that brought the Jews to serve G-d on their
own.

It was not Moses' job to do everything, but only one thing: to
connect the Jews to G-d.

That is why, when Moses' name is mentioned in the Haggadah it is
in the verse, "They believed in G-d and in Moses His servant."

In other words, the Torah equates the belief in Moses with the
belief in G-d, because there cannot be one without the other.

The Zohar (1:253a) equates Moses with Moshiach, because Moshiach
-- the final redeemer of the Jewish people, will complete the task
begun by Moses -- the first redeemer of the Jewish people.

In fact, Moshiach will bring the entire world to serve the
Creator (through His Torah) with all their talents, skills and
abilities.

At that time will be fulfilled, "And they (the entire world)
will believe in G-d and Moses His servant." And, the world will be
filled with peace, prosperity and brotherhood.

*************
* PSALM 106 *
*************

It is a custom to say daily the chapter of Psalms associated
with the number of one's years. Many also have the custom to recite
daily the Rebbe's chapter. The 11th of Nissan, Friday, March 30,
marks the Rebbe's 105th birthday, and so we begin reciting chapter
106.

This chapter continues the theme of chapter 105, praising G-d
for many more miracles not mentioned previously. Both of these
chapters also speak of redemption. However, the previous chapter
spoke of the redemption from Egypt while chapter 106 speaks of the
future Redemption.

The chapter begins, "Praise the L-rd, offer praise to the L-rd
for He is good, for His kindness is everlasting." It continues,
"Who can express the mighty acts of the L-rd, who can proclaim all
His praises."

According to the famed Maharal of Prague, from these two verses
we learn the very important trait of "Hakarot HaTov," showing
gratitude. The first verse encourages us to praise G-d and the
second verse explains that we must praise G-d even if we are
lacking in our ability to express G-d's praises qualitatively or
quantitatively.

The Rebbe explains that when a Jew is helped by G-d to perform
his service in exile despite its difficulties, he has a special
obligation to give thanks to G-d.

In verse 44, it says, "But He regarded their affliction, when He
heard their Rina -- exaltation." The Divrei Yisrael wonders, "This
is strange; when someone is in distress, one would expect him to
cry. However, it can be explained: G-d saw when the Jewish People
were in the very midst of distress, He still heard their exultation
and singing to Him, so He saved them. From here we learn that
whenever a Jew is, G-d forbid, in a difficult situation, if he
sings about his salvation which is to come, G-d will help him.

The exodus from Egypt (as well as the miracles performed in the
exodus from Egypt and the times of exile that followed), mentioned
throughout chapter 106, is the preparation and strength for the
future redemption. Thus, the chapter concludes with verses that
speak powerfully of the future redemption and ends with the word
"amen, halelukah" affirming that the future redemption will be
eternal.

* MOSHIACH MATTERS *
********************

(1)

In the Haggadah we read the words, " 'All the days of your life'
including the Era of Moshiach." Le'havi translated as "including"
literally means "to bring." Thus, this Talmudic passage, quoted in
the Haggadah, can be interpreted as a directive: All the days of
your life should be permeated by a single intention: to bring about
the coming of the Era of Moshiach.
(The Previous Rebbe)

******************************
* IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE *
******************************

By Rae Ekman Shagalov [1]

"What's this? I don't believe it! It's not fair!"

I looked at the photo-enforced citation I had just received in
the mail. There was a photo of me sitting in the car showing I had
run a red light. "I was only one second too late and it's a $350
fine!" If I had been pulled over by a police officer maybe I could
have talked him out of it, but how can you argue with a photo?
Should I just pay it and get it over with, or should I take a day
off from work and go through all of the hassle of going to court to
try to get out of it?

I decided to go to court. A few months later I was sitting in
the courtroom. I was very nervous. I had never been to traffic
court before. I wished there was something familiar in the
courtroom. Half an hour later, the judge walked in. Uh oh, I
thought, the judge looks very stern.

The judge began: "You should know that the fine on your citation
is only the beginning of what your citation will cost. There is an
additional mandatory state penalty of two to three times the fine."
Oh, NO! My one second mistake might end up costing me over $1,000!

The Deputy called up the first five cases. I was the fifth. The
case before mine was "Synagogue Chabad." What Divine Providence!
Here was something familiar; a representative of a Chabad House.
Surely the Rebbe's presence was here with his emissary. The
Lubavitcher started to say, "I'm here for Synagogue Chabad. It's an
organiz--."

The judge interrupted him sternly, but with a smile: "Just
answer yes or no -- Is your name Synagogue Chabad?"

"No," the young man responded.

"Case dismissed!" said the judge. The young man's jaw dropped
open in shock. "I said your citation is dismissed," repeated the
judge. "You may go." He left and I was next.

"What do you plead," said the judge, "Guilty, not guilty or no
contest?"

"Your honor, I've prepared a letter describing my circumstances.
Could you please read it?"

I handed her the following letter:

To the Honorable Judge:

I would like to ask the mercy of the court in
dismissing this ticket for the following reasons:

1. As a school librarian, I am normally a very
cautious driver (even old ladies feel safe when I
drive!). As the photo shows I reached the intersection
just as the light turned red and was through the
intersection only one second past the red light.
This ticket has made me much more careful to avoid
entering intersections on a yellow light.

2. Two weeks ago my dear mother died which has
distressed me immensely and I have over $9,000 in
unexpected funeral expenses. As this ticket would
cause additional hardship to me, I would like to
ask the mercy of the court to dismiss this ticket.

Thank you very much for your kindness.

The judge read my letter carefully, examined the photo, then
spent five minutes carefully explaining how a camera attached to a
traffic light works and why it can never be wrong. "This citation
is completely justified," she concluded. My heart sank.

"However," the judge continued, "I have read your letter and in
the interest of justice, the court dismisses your citation. You may
go."

"Hallelu Et Hash-m -- Praise G-d for He is good; His kindness
lasts forever!" I sang to myself as I left the courtroom. Then I
began to wonder, what am I supposed to learn from this?

I realized this experience had answered a spiritual question
that had been troubling me for many years. It was a question that
made me tremble on Yom Kippur, made me fear death, and sometimes
even made me dread the long-awaited Messianic Era. The question
was, "How is it possible that when we will be judged by the
Heavenly Court we may escape the severe punishments that could be
completely justified by our sins?

This judge showed me that even in this world, where G-dliness is
generally concealed, kindness is "in the interest of justice." My
citation was completely justified, but because of my repentance and
the intense suffering of losing my mother so recently, the judge
saw that justice could only be truly served with an extra measure
of kindness. Imagine, I thought, how much greater will be the extra
measure of kindness G-d will show us when we leave the immense
suffering we have experienced in this world by being so distant
from G-d, and arrive with our hearts filled with the tremendous
repentance we will feel in G-d's presence!

Now, without reservation, I eagerly await the imminent
revelation of Moshiach and am comforted by the words I discovered,
after my mother's death, in a letter that my grandfather wrote to
my mother on the day I was born:

"Divine Providence... ordained that for a little
while I have to be away from you at this time. I
realize, of course, these poor words of mine
cannot take the place of my being there, especially
to one who from the time you were a baby -- whether
you went to a doctor or dentist, you would yell,
'Daddy, hold my hand!' In spirit I am right there
beside you and always have been and always will be.
Do you have to see the flowers when you smell
perfume? Do you have to see G-d to know there is
One who watches over you in my absence? You know
He is there and so am I and it won't be long now
before I shall be with you all again."

May "it won't be long" become "now" with the actual arrival of
Moshiach, in this moment, right now!

* IT HAPPENED ONCE *
********************

The Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS is at the
forefront of the renaissance of Jewish life currently taking place
in the former Soviet Union. Over 1,000 emissaries of the
Lubavitcher Rebbe staff the 454 JCCs located in 454 cities
throughout fifteen countries in the former Soviet Union.

*

A teenage girl showed up in the office of Rabbi Shmuel
Kaminetzky, the Rebbe's emissary and Chief Rabbi of Dnepropetrovsk.
Her great-grandmother was requesting that he visit her in the
village of Pridnipropsk, nearly two-hours away. "Is your
grandmother Jewish?" the rabbi asked. "No." "Is anyone in your
family Jewish?" continued the rabbi. "No," answered the teen once
again.

Rabbi Kaminetzky looked at his overcrowded calendar and said
that he would visit in two weeks. A week later the girl returned to
Rabbi Kaminetzky. "Grandma is too frail to travel. She needs to
speak with you right away." Rabbi Kaminetzky accompanied the girl
back to her tiny village.

As soon as Irina saw the rabbi, she began to cry. When she
calmed down, she started to speak in broken Yiddish. "I grew up in
a religious Jewish home. During a pogrom in my hometown of
Yekatrinislav (now called Dnepropetrovsk) in 1911, I saw my parents
killed before my eyes."

Irina switched to Russian and her children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren listened as she recounted how gentile neighbors
had taken her in and cared for her. They had made only one
condition: that she never tell anyone that she was Jewish as they
feared it might endanger her life.

Irina told the rabbi that she had always hoped that the day
would come when she would be able to reveal her secret. But, at the
very least, she wanted to receive a Jewish burial. Rabbi Kaminetzky
spent a number of hours with Irina. Before leaving he explained to
her descendants that they, too, are Jewish. The rabbi told the
family that he or some of his colleagues would be in touch with
them, to introduce them to their Jewish roots.

The next day, the great-granddaughter returned to the rabbi's
office. "Grandma died soon after you left. We need you to give her
a Jewish burial."

It was after the funeral that one of Irina's daughters told
Rabbi Kaminetzky, "Now I understand why my mother fasted for an
entire day each autumn and did not eat bread for a whole week each
spring."

Today, all of Irina's children, grandchildren and even
great-grandchildren know what it means to live as a Jew, thanks to
the Rebbe's emissaries in the former Soviet Union.

*************************
* THE STORY OF THE OMER *
*************************

During [2] the days of the Omer, we eagerly count the days from
Pesach until Shavuot, looking forward to receiving the Torah anew.

The Torah says, "And you shall count seven full weeks, from the
day after your festival, when you bring the Omer as a wave
offering...." (Leviticus 23:15).

What is the Omer? Why is it connected with counting these days?
Here is the answer.

In the Holy Land, barley ripens in the spring, in the month of
Nissan.

In the time of the Beis HaMikdosh, the new crop could not be
used until an amount of barley, called an "Omer," was offered on
the Great Altar in the Sanctuary. This is how it took place:

Right after the first day of Pesach, on the eve of the 16th of
Nissan, prominent Torah scholars and members of the Supreme Court
(Bet-Din) would go out into a field of barley near Jerusalem that
had been prepared before Yom Tov.

All the neighboring villagers would gather to watch the
ceremony.

Three men using three sickles would cut three measures of
barley, which they would put in three boxes.

Once it was dark, the head of the reapers would say, "Has the
sun set?"

"Yes," everyone would reply.

"Has the sun set?" he would ask again.

"Yes."

"Has the sun set?"

A third time they would answer, "Yes."

Then he would point to the sickle and ask three times, "Is this
the sickle?"

"Yes."

"Is this the sickle?" -- "Yes."

"Is this the sickle?" -- "Yes."

In the same way, he would ask three times, "Is this the box?" --
"Yes."

"Is this the box?" -- "Yes."

"Is this the box?" -- "Yes."

If it was Shabbat, he would also ask three times, "Is it Shabbat
today?"

This showed everybody that the mitzvah of cutting the Omer
pushes off the Shabbat.

Finally he would ask, "Shall I reap?"

"Yes," they would answer.

"Shall I reap?" -- "Yes."

"Shall I reap?" -- "Yes."

This whole ceremony was very awesome. What was it all for?

Unfortunately, there were people at that time who rebelled
against the Sages. They were called Beitusim. They tried to get
people not to listen to the teachings of the Sages.

One of their arguments was that the Omer should only be cut on a
Saturday night, after Shabbat.

In fact, in the Torah it says that the time for cutting the Omer
is "the day after Shabbat." The Beitusim said this meant the day
after Shabbat itself. But the Sages had the tradition from Mt.
Sinai, that Yom Tov is also called Shabbat, and the Omer should be
cut the day after Yom Tov!

They made a big ceremony out of it, so that it would be clear to
everyone that the Beitusim were not correct. The Omer had to be cut
the day after Yom Tov, even on Shabbat!

After the barley had been cut, it was placed in the three boxes
and brought to the Beis HaMikdosh. Since it was still green and
soft, it was dried and roasted in such a way that the fire touched
every grain. Then it was spread out in the courtyard for the wind
to blow through it. Finally it was ground up with millstones into
flour.

Of the three measures (se'ah) of barley that had been reaped in
the field, only one tenth was taken for the offering. This quantity
is called an Omer.

This Omer was then sieved thirteen times, over and over again,
until it was fine and pure.

The next day, the barley flour was burned as an offering on the
Mizbayach, the Great Altar. Before burning it, the kohen would wave
it in every direction in honor of the One to Whom the whole world
belongs. It was as if he were saying, "Thank you, G-d, for the
harvest. Thank you for the very bread we eat."

* * *

In the Midrash it says that the Omer shows us how kind G-d is to
His people. When the Jews were in the wilderness, G-d gave every
single one of them an Omer of manna every day. Now that the Jewish
people had come into the Holy Land, all G-d asked in return was a
single Omer from the whole Jewish people. Nor did they need to
bring it every day. Once a year was enough. And barley, a poor
man's grain, was all G-d required.

Our Sages also taught that Pesach is the time when the crops are
ripening. At this time, G-d judges the world in regard to food,
particularly grain.

At such a moment G-d says to us, "Bring me an Omer of barley on
Pesach, and I will bless the grain in your fields for the whole
year."

By counting these days, we remember that the world is being
judged. Will there be hunger or plenty? At this time we should
return to G-d with a complete heart, and beg Him to have mercy on
us and on all His creatures, and on the land, so that the harvest
may grow as required.

Nowadays, we do not have the Beis HaMikdosh, and we cannot bring
the Omer offering, but we pray that by doing G-d's mitzvah of
Counting the Omer with joy in our hearts, we may merit His ultimate
blessing, that He should speedily restore the Beis HaMikdosh, and
reestablish His Kingship throughout the world, with the revelation
of Moshiach, Now.

* S'FIRAT HA'OMER *
*******************

On the second night of Pesach, we begin S'firat Ha'omer,
counting forty-nine days between Pesach and Shavuot, the day when
the Torah was given to the children of Israel. This is done every
night following the evening prayer leading up to the night before
Shavuot.

We use this time to prepare ourselves to receive the Torah, just
as our ancestors did at Mt. Sinai.

*  It is most proper to count the Omer at the beginning of the
night, immediately following the evening prayer. However, it is
permissible to count the Omer throughout the night.

*  If you forget to count at nightfall, but have reminded yourself
before dawn, you may count then, with the blessing.

*  If you forget to count at night; you can count throughout the
next day (WITHOUT SAYING THE BLESSING). The following evening
you can count again WITH the blessing.

*  If you forget to count for a whole day, you should still keep on
counting the days until Shavuot, BUT YOU DO NOT SAY THE BLESSING
ANY MORE.

*  If you are in doubt whether you counted the previous night, even
though you definitely did not count during the day, you may
recite the blessing when counting on the subsequent nights.

****************************
* S'FIRAT HA'OMER BLESSING *
****************************

*  Every night, after nightfall, after having recited the evening
prayer, say the following blessing, and then count the proper day:

BO-RUCH A-TOH ADO-NOI E-LO-HEI-NU ME-LECH HO-OLOM
A-SHER KI-DE-SHO-NU BE-MITZ-VO-SOV VE-TZI-VO-NU
AL SE-FI-RAS HO-OMER.

Translation:

Blessed are You, L-rd our G-d, King of the universe,
who has sanctified us with His commandments, and
commanded us concerning the counting of the Omer.

* Then we count the day, saying:

"Today is one day (or two days, or three days, etc.) of the
Omer."

* MOSHIACH MATTERS *

"This is my G-d and I shall glorify Him,
my father's G-d and I shall exalt Him"
(Exodus 15:2)

The Midrash states that at the splitting of the Reed Sea, every
Jew pointed with his finger and said, "This," for there was such a
prophetic manifestation of G-dliness at that time that they were
able to actually point to it.

The Midrash also notes that the children born under Egyptian
servitude were the first to perceive and recognize the Divine
manifestation.

"As in the days of your going out from Egypt, I will show
wondrous things" we read in Michah. In fact, the Divine revelation
of the Messianic Redemption will be even greater than the one in
Egypt.

Furthermore, just as at the time of the Egyptian exodus it
was the children born in exile who recognized G-d first, so it
will also be with Moshiach: the children born in the harshness
of this bitter exile will be the first to recognize the Divine
manifestation.                                          (The Rebbe)

********************
* FROM SEA TO LAND *
********************

By Rabbi Berel Bell

In the account of the splitting of the Reed Sea, the Torah
relates that "the sea was transformed into dry land." We are also
taught that this transformation took place not only in this world,
but in the spiritual worlds as well.

Obviously, there is neither sea nor land in the spiritual
realms. What, then, is the meaning of this statement?

See Any Fish?

We can understand this by first looking into the difference
between the physical land and sea. When one looks at the sea, one
sees nothing but the water that covers the life within it. This is
not the case with the land, which has various kinds of animals,
plants, and minerals that are clearly visible to the naked eye.

Another difference between sea and land is that water creatures
are, in general, totally dependent on the water for their
existence. A fish can only live out of the water for a short time.
Land creatures, however, do not need constant contact with the
land, and can therefore live in the air or elsewhere off the
ground.

These two factors are in a way connected. Since a fish
depends totally on the water for its existence, it is virtually
part of the water. This idea is reflected in Jewish law regarding
immersion in a mikvah. Although the entire body being immersed
must simultaneously come in contact with the water, there is
nevertheless an opinion that if one immerses in the ocean and bumps
into a fish the immersion is still valid, as the fish is considered
to be part of the water. The fact that, to our eyes, fish within
the ocean cannot be distinguished from the water further
establishes this point.

The converse applies to the land. Since animals are not so
dependent on the land, they are considered separate from it. This
is reflected in their appearance: that they are clearly visible and
distinct from the land.

Although we are speaking in physical terms, these concepts -- of
being united with one's life-source and of appearing to have an
independent existence -- are also applicable in the spiritual
sense.

There are planes of spiritual existence, which are compared to
the sea. In these realms there is a greater measure of revealed
G-dliness. The beings in this realm feel closer to G-d, to the
extent that they have no feeling of independent existence.

Just as fish must be in the water to live, beings on this level
feel that their very existence is dependent on the G-dly spark that
keeps them alive. The only revealed existence is that of G-d, just
as only the water is visible in the sea.

On lower levels, though, G-dliness is not so revealed. There is
not such a feeling of total dependence on G-d; rather there is a
feeling of self-reliance and individuality. This corresponds to the
independent nature of creatures on land.

When "the sea was transformed into dry land," these two levels
came together. The closeness and nullification to G-d ("sea") was
sensed even by the lower worlds ("dry land").

This does not mean that after the sea was split, the spiritual
effect then followed. Since everything in the physical world
derives from the spiritual, the opposite is true. First there was
the spiritual transformation, when the lower levels were engulfed
by the G-dly revelation of the "sea." Then, in response, the
physical realm experienced the splitting of the sea.

The Sea Within

Within the Jewish soul there are also deeper levels that are
united with G-d and rarely revealed ("sea") and lower levels in
which the bond with G-d is not as visible ("land").

When the Jewish people came to the Reed Sea, it did not split
right away. Only Nachshon ben Aminadav had the complete faith and
self-sacrifice to jump into the water. He was in fact almost
completely under the water before it split.

In order to bring himself to this level of self-sacrifice,
Nachshon had to "split the sea" within himself; to reveal the
inner, hidden dimensions of his soul and bring them out into the
realm of action. By accomplishing this within himself, he effected
a transformation of all the spiritual worlds and the physical world
as well. So, too, every individual has this ability latent within,
and by releasing it can effect miracles here in the physical world.

***************************************
*       RIGHTEOUS JEWISH WOMEN        *
* Adapted from the Works of the Rebbe *
***************************************

After the miraculous Splitting of the Reed Sea, as related in
the Torah portion that is read on the seventh day of Pesach,
Moses leads the Jewish men in singing their praises of G-d, and
Miriam, the prophetess, leads the women in their song of thanks.

The Torah tells us that the joy experienced by the women was far
greater than that of the men. "And all the women went out...with
tambourines and dances."

In fact, the Midrash relates that when the heavenly angels
wanted to add their voices to the "Song of the Splitting of the
Reed Sea," G-d told them that they must wait until the women had
finished.

The exile in Egypt was much harsher for the Jewish women than
for their husbands. Of all Pharaoh's decrees against the Children
of Israel, the most pitiless was the one that broke every Jewish
mother's heart: "Every son that is born you shall throw into the
river." The pain and suffering experienced by the Jewish women was
more intense than the hardships the men were forced to endure, and
when salvation came, the joy they felt was therefore greater as
well.

The stories in the Torah teach us lessons that apply in all
generations. Pharaoh's decrees against the Jewish people have
appeared again and again, throughout history, in various forms.
Their aim, however, has never changed. The Egyptian Pharaoh sought
to kill Jewish babies by drowning them in the Nile; later despots
sought to destroy Jewish souls in ways equally dangerous, although
not always as obvious.

In our days, when most Jews, thank G-d, live in relative safety
and security, the decrees of Pharaoh imperil the spiritual
existence of the Jewish people. "Pharaoh" rears his head in the
guise of popular culture and the winds of arbitrary and capricious
conventional wisdom, which threaten to sever the Jewish people from
the eternal and timeless values of the Torah. "Pharaoh" seeks to
immerse and drown the minds of impressionable Jewish children in
the waters of whatever is, at the moment, trendy and fashionable.

The threat is not all that different from the one faced in
Egypt, because Jews cannot exist for long without their faith in
G-d and the study of Torah. Jewish children need a solid Jewish
education to ensure the continuation of our people.

Today, just as in Egypt, the main responsibility -- to safeguard
our greatest national treasure, our children, from negative
influences -- lies with the Jewish mother. Jewish women have,
throughout the generations, been granted the power to set the
proper tone in the home and make it a place where their children
will flourish and grow up to be good Jews.

In this way Jewish women will see true satisfaction from their
children and merit to sing G-d's praises at the Final Redemption,
speedily in our days.

"Splitting of the Reed Sea," which completed the Redemption
from Egypt.

* On the eighth day of Pesach, Yizkor is recited after the Torah
reading.

* Late afternoon, eat a Special Pesach Meal -- Moshiach's
Seudah.

* PESACH ENDS AFTER NIGHTFALL ON TUESDAY, APRIL 10. THE ACTUAL
TIME IS INDICATED ON THE PESACH CALENDAR - Below.

* WAIT ONE HOUR BEFORE EATING CHOMETZ TO ALLOW TIME FOR THE
RABBI TO BUY IT BACK FOR YOU.

* UNTIL THAT TIME NO CHOMETZ SHOULD BE BOUGHT OR EATEN.

*****************************
* A TASTE OF THINGS TO COME *
*****************************

MOSHIACH'S SEUDAH

The Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Chassidism, instituted the
custom of eating a special third meal on the last day of Pesach
late in the afternoon, after Minchah, complete with matzah and
wine.

This meal is known as the "Festive Meal of Moshiach," or
Moshiach's Seudah, for on this day the radiance of Moshiach is
openly revealed. Also, it is intended to deepen our awareness of
the imminence of the final Redemption.

On this day, he said, one can actually feel the approach of
Moshiach. "Behold," says the verse in Song of Songs, "he is
standing behind our wall, watching through the windows, peering
through the crevices . . .".

*

Beginning in the year 5666/1906, it became customary in
Lubavitch for the students of the Lubavitcher yeshivah to eat their
Pesach meals together in the study hall. That year, the fifth
Chabad-Lubavitch Rebbe, Rabbi Sholom Dov Ber, known as the Rebbe
Rashab, joined the students for the third festive meal of the last
day of Pesach, and directed that each of them be given four cups of
wine.

The Rebbe once commented, that this was obviously intended to
become an annual custom.

*

Moshiach's Seudah was instituted on the eighth day of Pesach, as
the number eight is connected to the Redemption (being one more
than seven -- symbolic of the natural order) and the Haftorah read
on the eighth day of Pesach contains many of the Messianic
prophecies.

One might ask, what is the point of eating an actual, physical
meal that relates to the subject of Moshiach? This festive meal
causes the image and the feeling of the future Redemption to
penetrate not only all the faculties of a person's soul, including
his capacity for action, but his physical body as well -- by means
of the physical food that becomes part of his very flesh and blood.
Partaking of this festive meal is intended to draw down the
radiance of Moshiach into every aspect of one's daily life
throughout the year.

This simply means -- as an anticipatory echo of how the world
will appear after the Redemption -- that holiness should permeate
all of a person's activities, including his physical activities, to
the point that he is prepared to sacrifice the innermost core of
his soul. This is the yechida within his soul, the element of
Moshiach in his soul.

The Rebbe once explained, "The four cups of wine on the Seder
night are the cups of Moses our teacher; the four cups of wine at
Seudat Moshiach on the last day of Pesach are the cups of our
righteous Moshiach."

* * *

Hundreds of Chabad-Lubavitch Centers around the world will be
hosting the traditional, mystical Moshiach's Seudah, on the last
day of Pesach.

To find out about a Moshiach's Seudah near you, call your local
Chabad-Lubavitch Center.

* TIME FOR UNITY; TIME FOR STRENGTH! *
**************************************

The most important principle in the Torah is the protection of
Jewish life.

It's more important than Shabbat, more important than holidays,
even fasting on Yom Kippur.

Right now, in Israel, and everywhere, Jews must stand together
in unity and do whatever possible to protect Jewish life.

The Rebbe teaches that there are TEN important MITZVOT we can do
to protect life. See what you can do:

1) AHAVAT YISROEL: Behave with love towards another Jew.

2) LEARN TORAH: Join a Torah class.

3) Make sure that Jewish children get a TORAH TRUE EDUCATION.

4) Affix kosher MEZUZOT on all doorways of the house.

5) For men and boys over 13: Put on TEFILLIN every weekday.

6) Give CHARITY.

7) Buy JEWISH HOLY BOOKS and learn them.

8) LIGHT SHABBAT & YOM TOV candles. A Mitzvah for women and
girls.

9) Eat and drink only KOSHER FOOD.

10) Observe the laws of JEWISH FAMILY PURITY.

In addition the Rebbe urges that:

Every Jewish man, woman and child should have a letter written
for them in a SEFER TORAH.*

Every person should study either the Rambam's Yad Hachazakah --
Code of Jewish Law -- or the Sefer HaMitzvos.

Concerning Moshiach, the Rebbe stated, "The time for our
redemption has arrived!" Everyone should prepare themselves for
Moshiach's coming by doing random acts of goodness and kindness,
and by studying about what the future redemption will be like. May
we merit to see the fulfillment of the Rebbe's prophecy now!
