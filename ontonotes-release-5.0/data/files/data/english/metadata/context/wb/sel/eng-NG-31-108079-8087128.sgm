Just got my Spitfire today.  I was thinking of taking off the prop and
tossing it for a few short glides to get the feel of it.  How do these
things glide?

I don't think gliding is going to give you the skills
you need.

And tossing it hard enough to reach a good gliding speed
may get you set up for a stall and crash--or a throw
directly into the ground, which sometimes happens.

If you're ready to fly, go fly the plane the way
it was designed to fly.

DON'T DO THAT! It will not survive believe me. They are very very fragile
and it will definately nose in. They are not easy to hand launch on your
own. Please get a friend to give a good level throw.

We are following this story with interest and are waitng for your report on
how the first flight goes.

OK, no gliding!  I'm probably going to have to do it myself, my buddies
won't get up at 6 AM to come help me.  I live in the desert near Phoenix,
and it is way too hot after that time, and the wind picks up to.
How hard do I need to toss it?  In the video on Parkzone's website, it
looks like it picks up and goes pretty fast.

Any tips wold be appreciated.

Best kept secret: CellPro Revolution LiPo packs

If you are flying electrics take a look at CellPro Revolution packs - great
performance, great prices and work directly with the CellPro charger without
any adapters.  Just about all the guys in our club are using them and the
CellPro charger/balancer.  A 3S4800 sells for over $20 less than popular
3S4600.  And the have a 60 day no questions asked return policy.  Now that
is confidence.

Hey, if _I_ can toss one hard enough, you can :) As others have already
said elsewhere, a level toss is probably best. Since it has the prop up
front, you might make your life a lot easier by launching it on full
throttle. Just be careful that when you toss it you don't touch the
blades with anything. It hurts, trust me ;)

The general procedure is this:
- Stand so the sun is at your back, and the flying field in front of you
If thats not possible, try to get the sun at least to your side.
- Turn on TX
- Make sure you've got zero throttle
- Make sure the TX is set to use LOW rates (switch on the upper right)
- Plug in battery (stay away from the prop just in case)
- Check that elevator works as intended, i.e.:
* Stick UP pushes the elevator DOWN
* Stick DOWN pushes the elevator UP
- Make sure the elevator is reasonably level when stick's centered.
A teeny tiny bit of up trim might make it easier to launch, but thats
personal preference. Level should work just fine.
- Check rudder, and use the trims to center it
- Hold the plane so the prop is safely away, and hit the throttle to
make sure the engine works as it should
- If you can find a buddy, do a range check. If not... gotta skip it :/
- Grab the plane firmly (the manual actually has a picture how to grab
it and where)
- Go full throttle if you dare (manual recommends against it, and I
don't particularly feel comfy with a full-throttle toss either)
- If there is a noticeable breeze, aim the plane into the breeze.
- Toss the plane levelly away from you. Toss it firmly, but not like
your life depends on force. Level is more important than force.
- Try not to pull the stick all the way back, just maybe 1/3rd max. The
plane should pretty much pick up speed quickly and start to climb.
- Keep your eyes on the plane. Do NOT look away from it, not even a
second. If someone tries to talk to you, ignore them.

Likely, on the first flight the trims might be just a hair off. Do not
try and adjust them in-flight yet, bring the plane down before trying
any trim adustments.

During flight, try to keep the plane in front of you, i.e. so you do not
have to physically turn your body left/right. Also, try to keep it at a
bit of altitude, and for your first flight, keep it at maybe 2/3rd
throttle, that should keep it comfortably in the air without stalls and
with a nice manageable speed.

And the bad news: Launching and flying is relatively easy. Landing is
where new pilots seem to stuff it most often :) So... here's a simple
way to land as long as you've got enough field available:

- During flight, figure out how slow you can go before the nose drops,
just try to fly level, and slowly reduce power. If you have to pull up
to keep the plane on altitude, you're getting too slow.
- Figure out where the wind comes from, if any. If there's wind, you'd
want to land with the nose facing into the wind.
- Gently ease the plane into final approach and line it up as good as
you can. If you're flying in a reasonably big park/field you don't
have to worry about hitting any runway, which makes things easier.
- Just cut the power and let it glide in. Don't pull up. Don't push
down. Keep the nose level and let it glide to the ground. Stick
movements should be minor, else the plane will probably stall.
- If you feel something going wrong (plane overshooting the landing for
example), just hit the throttle and try again.
- As long as it comes down on your flying field and as long as the plane
isn't damaged, it's a successful landing :) The plane can take quite a
&quot;hot&quot; landing as long as the grass is soft, somewhat short, and the
plane lands nice and level on its belly. If the wing tip hits the
ground at any speed, you're most likely going to do some repairs. Flat
and level landing is the key with these foamies.
- Unplug the planes battery before retracting the TX antenna, and
definitely before turning off the TX.

Since I've seen videos with people doing it: Do NOT try to catch the
plane. That takes a lot of practice, and IMO it's silly anyway.

Mind, this is the lazy &quot;oh my it's a NOOB!&quot; way to land. Later you might
want to make sure you can somewhat land spot-on, from any direction.
Since your plane does not have a landing gear you HAVE to make sure you
have cut power to zero before landing, else you'll strip the prop.

Sounds complicated, but really isn't. It's basically:
1. Pre-flight check
2. Finding a good place to fly (in relation to sun and wind)
3. Launch
4. Fly around
5. Glide in for a nice, soft landing
6. Proper power down

Good luck, and have fun at the first flight. It's a rush.

Bummer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  How hard do I need to toss it?
">

Not hard at all.

No need for a windup or follow-through.

Hold the TX in your weak hand.  Practice finding
the sticks WITHOUT looking at the TX.  Keep your
eyes on the airplane when you throw it so that
you know what it needs by the time you get your
hands on the sticks.

The first day you go flying should not be the
first time that you practice your &quot;quick draw.&quot;
Five or ten minutes of repetition should help
you figure out what works for you.

You might fold a paper airplane and use it for
tossing practice.  Toss the plane with your
strong hand, keep your eye on it, and get
your hands on the controls.

Don't panic.  Smooth and sure is better than
hasty and off-balance.  People do this all the
time and the odds are in your favor.

Hold the airplane comfortably above your
head and shoulder.

Rev the engine to maximum.  This may be just
a bit awkward depending on which hand is
holding the TX.  You can practice this
sequence, too, the night before you plan
to fly.  HANG ON TIGHT.  Letting an electric
plane loose in the house is a classic beginner's
mistake.  You don't need to practice this a lot
to get the feel of holding the plane with the
motor running at full tilt.

After charging your batteries as needed and
appropriate for your system, it's time to fly.

No running.

No lunging.

Push the aircraft forward like a dart aimed
at a target in front of its nose.

Do not throw it like a football or baseball.

Do not throw it with your shoulders and legs.

Throw into the wind, if any.

It doesn't take much of a shove to reach flying
speed.  As soon as you let go of it, the motor
and prop will take care of the rest of the
acceleration needed to fly.

Watching my hand go through the air, I estimate
that maybe my hand can travel 2-3 feet in a
straight line.  Probably 18&quot; is all the little
planes need.

In years past when our field was badly tended,
I've thrown .40- and .60-sized trainers.  They
weigh 5 to 7 pounds and do need a little trot
and a little more persuasion in the final toss.
None of the trainers I threw crashed on takeoff.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In the video on Parkzone's website, it
&gt;looks like it picks up and goes pretty fast.
">

Yes.  It's not that big a deal.  The trouble is
that it's the first flight of your life and
the first flight of the airplane's life.
Although I think the odds are in your favor,
strange and bad things do happen.  Do your
best to make sure that the wings and control
surfaces are straight.

Make sure that the control surfaces go in the
right direction.

Left rudder makes the rudder swing to the
left as you look at the plane from behind.

Pulling the elevator stick toward you
(or toward the tail of the airplane,
or &quot;back&quot;) should make the elevator come
up.

Left aileron makes the left aileron go up.

Pulling the elevator back towards you will
make the airplane go up if you have the power
on.  If the airplane stalls or has the power
off, pulling the elevator back may keep the
airplane stalled (not too likely with light
park flyers).

Have fun and let us know how it all turns out!

Jen,

The instructions for the Spitfire do call for max throttle on launch.
Thanks for all the great advice!!

From what altitude do you cut power and glide it in?

Correct, full throttle until it gathers enough airspeed. I suspect that
it's a lot safer to start out with full throttle on a &quot;regular&quot; plane
with the prop on the nose, as opposed to the pushers I fly.

Depends on overall altitude above sealevel. At 5000ft I think I come in
at maybe 20ft above ground, maybe 75ft out from where I want to touch
down. At 9000ft, the final approach is a lot steeper. It depends on the
glide ratio of the plane, and yours quite certainly differs. Best bet is
to do a few approaches and see what altitude you need. The plane will
glide just fine as long as you allow it to - i.e. no pulling nose up. If
nothing else, the Parkzone planes are well balanced.

Sorry about that.  No, I have not tried them.  I don't buy batteries to
test. If they want a review they have to provide the packs. Why would one
want to pay $20+ more from an off the wall vendor you never heard of using
cells from an unknow source?

If you want to advance the understanding of the technogy offered by Air
Thunder I'm sure they will accomodate you. . . . for $69.99 plus shipping.
While you are at it, please ask them if they can post some performance
curves on their web site and give us a clue as to who their cell supplier
is.

BTW,  CellPro Evolution packs are made by Worley Parsons in your country.

hi
You did not bother to read the page If you did you would have see the
performane curver...please read

Among the key features of AirThunder batteries is the ability to withstand
over-discharging. Over-discharging has been a major issue with conventional
Li-poly technology as it leads to over-heating, deformation, and degradation
of the battery. Model aircraft owners are often advised to time their
operation to avoid detrimental effects. Our proprietary formulation and
packaging technology has circumvented such problems, allowing the battery to
be safely discharged to low volt. This is an industrial-first; a true
breakthrough in Li-poly technology. In addition, our battery maintains its
voltage till the very end of the discharge cycle. This means you can fully
enjoy your flying experience worry-free.

Listen to the coments near the end of this video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQbOuQGjU-o

If there are no more low voltage worrys  then YES I would pay more.

Air Thunder is making some pretty wild claims on their site. If they have a
new 'mysterious' technology that accomplishes all of their claims, they
should tell us what that technology is. Otherwise, it's nothing more than
smoke and mirrors.

You did not bother to tell us how you achieve this MIRACLE of the ability to
withstand over-discharging. Are we to just take your word for it?

If you want a true test, send some batteries to Red Scholfield. He will tell
it like it is and if you indeed have a great battery, he will say so!

&gt; hi
&gt; You did not bother to read the page If you did you would have see the
&gt; performane curver...please read

&gt; Among the key features of AirThunder batteries is the ability to withstand
&gt; over-discharging. Over-discharging has been a major issue with
&gt; conventional Li-poly technology as it leads to over-heating, deformation,
&gt; and degradation of the battery. Model aircraft owners are often advised to
&gt; time their operation to avoid detrimental effects. Our proprietary
&gt; formulation and packaging technology has circumvented such problems,
&gt; allowing the battery to be safely discharged to low volt. This is an
&gt; industrial-first; a true breakthrough in Li-poly technology. In addition,
&gt; our battery maintains its voltage till the very end of the discharge
&gt; cycle. This means you can fully enjoy your flying experience worry-free.

&gt; Listen to the coments near the end of this video
&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQbOuQGjU-o

&gt; If there are no more low voltage worrys  then YES I would pay more.

Why should they bother?  Sell a few thousand packs at an inflated premium
and then when things fall apart come back tomorrow under another name with
more unsubstantiated claims and peddle a few more thousand.  Never reveal
your manufacturing source otherwise people can check directly with the
manufacturer on the claims being made.

Hey Guys,

I have heard about these Air-Thunder packs a few months back and was
curious if they live up to their claim. I am a data geek and decided it
might be interesting to start logging some flight data because lab data
is just that, besides, I doubt lab testing has ever treated Lipo's to
the wonderful ways us modelers can torture a battery.  :p
I'm shooting to log 100 flights on this pack but between working OT and
crappy weather this may take a while.  :censored:

The data is posted in standard excel format so just look for a file
called Airthunder--.xls. Be advised the last two numbers change every
time I update the file.

http://www.hroads.net/~wadesrc/Batteries/

Frankly, I have been reasonably impressed with the performance of the
Air-Thunder pack I purchased. The best part is I can fly this pack
until it &quot;Dies in the Sky&quot; and I don't have to end my flight with the
recommended 20% of unused and wasted capacity remaining in the pack.
The pack does have its quirks, especially if you discharge the pack too
low. There have been occasions when I had to briefly charge the pack in
the Ni-Cad mode  :eek:  long enough to get the pack above 3V per cell
before switching over to the Lipo Charge mode.

That about it for my 2-cents on the subject.

Wade

Oh, You have some experience with EVO packs?   :-0
They were/are Enerland - an honest battery (at that time), but the UK
distributor  (Julian) took a few liberties in promoting them.

Yeah, I remember the initial hype about the EVO's. It was rediculous. The UK
distributor was totally discredited but people still sell and buy the packs
and they are still hyped.

My guess is the cells are manufactured in  Korea,  they are probably
assembled into packs in Australia by Worley Parsons.
