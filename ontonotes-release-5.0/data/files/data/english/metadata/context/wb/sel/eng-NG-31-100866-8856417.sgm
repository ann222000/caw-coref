Hi,

I am not a regular reader of this group, but I wanted to tell a
story.  I was walking my dog this evening (on a leash), an Amerian
Eskimo standard 20lbs (9 kilos), when a loose Pit attacked.  I quick
picked up my dog and the pit left, I put him back down and it ran back
and I tried to get my dog back up but I couldn't, so I lifted the
leash straight up and his Collar broke.  The Pit attacked and
immediately went for my dogs neck.  The Pitt was completely on top of
my dog and put his mouth on his neck.  I kicked the dog and beat him
with the leash and a passer by hit him with a metal trash can and he
got off and my dog got away, almost getting hit by a car in the chase.
Another second or 2 and my dog would have been dead.  My dog is like
one of the familly.  I love h im every bit as much as you love your
pit.  I cried when I got home (I havn't cried in years) because I
thought he was hurt (he ran home (but wasn't running right) and got
there before I did, he was shaking on my porch bench).  Loosing my dog
would be like loosing a familly member.  He does appear to be ok now,
he was just really shaken up.

Pit Bulls need to be at minimum, baned from cities, probably suburbs
as well and just be country/farm dogs where the only people and
animals they can attack and kill is their owners and their owners
other pets.  Pit Bull lovers stress how important it is to raise these
things in the right environment, but people just aren't doing that.
The reality is, people get the dogs, don't socialize them, mistreat
them, walk them off the leash etc, etc and most of the time, it's
someone else who pays the price, not the dog owner (sometimes it's the
owner or the owners familly, but most of the time it's a neighbor or
neighbors animal).  Pit Bulls are too strong and too capable of
killing to be in a city where you have thousands of people in a square
mile, like philadelphia (where this happened).  Had this been any
other dog I would have jumped on it and pulled it off my dog, but I
didn't want to loose an arm in the process.
You can't understand how I feel until this happens to you or
someone you love.  I always thought Pits were a bit much, but never
thought about it past that, but now that I am a victim (and damn near
the death of my dog) because of other people not raising their dog
right I can see it from a prospective that you can not.

Dogs living in the city/suburbs need to be relocated or killed.  That
is the only realistic option.  The city can not possibly go out and
inspect every Pit Bull home and be sure that it is being raised
properly and remove the ones that are not.  And it's unfair to give
every one the benifit of the doubt and just wait until the dogs kills
someone or some pet before removing/killing.  I do believe that every
familly needs to be given the opportunity to relocate their pets, but
within a reasonable time, say 30-60 days.  You can always move to the
country if your Pit means that much to you.  But in the end, these
dogs are killers and need to be away from people and pets.  People
should have the right to own a dog that might turn on them or their
children or other pets, but the general public shouldn't have to share
the risk.

And just like I said, people are not raising their Pits right and the
result is what happened to me last night.  You can't change human
behaivor, so the next best thing is to ban the animal (in densely
populated areas).  Particularly in cities, the people who want the
dogs most are the people that shouldn't have them.  I live in a pretty
good part of the city, but travel frequently through the bad parts and
I see over and over, young men with these dogs wearing gang colors.
One personal example I can tell you is my wifes friends husband just
got a pit puppy and he is deliberately trying to raise the dog to be
mean.  He is not socializing the dog.  He will not let anybody pet
him, play with him...  He hits him and hardly ever walks him (then
hits him for going to the bathroom on his carpet).  This man thinks of
himself as some sort of tough guy and wants a dog that fits his image.
This dog will grow into a killer (it already weighs 40+ punds and is
still a puppy).  This is just one example of thousands and thousands
in philadelphia and cities all over the country.  Drug dealers use
these dogs to slow police down so they can get the drugs down the
toilet in time, they don't even care if their dog gets killed or kills
in the process.  They view them as a tool in the drug trade.  I am not
asking to kill them all, just put them out of the city where they can
only hurt the people most responsible for their behaivor.

I think it's also worth noting that last night this dog was by all
accounts, acting friendly and no danger, until he saw my dog and
something in him snapped and he attacked.  My dog was looking the
other way and was not even aware of the pits presence until he was up
in my arms (the first attack), so my dog did NOTHING to provoke this
killer.

how is that going to fix the problem? all dogs are capable of
attacking, and all dogs are capable of biting. dog-aggression is
hardly limited to pit bulls. so if your dog is attacked by a non-pit
bull owned by an idiot because pit bulls have been banned, how is that
better?

&gt;&gt; my dog has not been the same since. he wasn't hurt badly,
&gt;&gt; but he did go on antibiotics to prevent infection from the
&gt;&gt;  bite wounds on his face and neck. he's still extremely
&gt;&gt; reactive toward dogs who approach him when he's on a
&gt;&gt; leash, even if the dogs are friendly.

That's right. The breed don't matter. ALL aggression is

&quot;I thought I was told that the way to get the dog to go

That was awkward and didn't seem to work.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I advised you to use a prong collar, not give firm
&gt; yanks on a chain choke collar. I hate the things.
">

&quot;I had to give him corrections every few seconds,
and also just about kick him, to keep him at my
left side.

Muttley is really a very sweet and loving dog, but
he needs more socialization with other dogs. However,
it is very likely that I will have him put down in a week.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; She was able to get his attention with
&gt;&gt; just a quick tug, but I had to yank on it
&gt;&gt; hard enough to lift him off his feet to get
&gt;&gt; him to respond. Looking back now, I think
&gt;&gt; it was based on his fear, which he had for
&gt;&gt;  her (as an unknown), but not for me
&gt;&gt; (whom he had learned to trust).
&gt; He wasn't afraid of me. He knew I was a
&gt; confident trainer. Fear has no place in dog
&gt; training, as I told you THEN.
&gt; Janet
">

It seems to me that applying stern corrections, by
popping a choker chain, prong collar, or whatever,
is a way to ensure compliance by instilling a fear
of further punishment.

Sure, if it is administered very consistently
by a confident trainer, the dog soon learns
to obey. There was no positive reinforcement,
so what remains is negative.

Also, I recall the time you were going to show me
how I could get Muttley to take his rawhide treat
from me without lunging for it. When you offered
it to him, he refused to take it. This IMHO is likely
a fear behavior.

Things have changed a lot since then, and I have
learned a lot, and Muttley has settled down quite
a bit. I probably still give him too much freedom
to think on his own, but that's just my way of
doing things, and that's probably not going to
change much. He may never win an obedience
medal, but I don't think he is dangerously out
of control, either.

&quot;Paul E. Schoen&quot; &lt;pst ... @smart.net&gt; wrote

Hello everyone:

If you have followed some of my posts, you know
something about the ongoing story of Muttley, the
large GSD/Chow dog I have been trying to adopt
or place in a better home.

I will add a bit more history later in this post.

Last Tuesday, toward the end of Janet's obedience
class, Muttley and I had just finished fairly successfully
performing a sit/stay/come routine, and then he was
sitting by my side.

The final routine was to be a &quot;down&quot;, which Muttley
has had some difficulty with, and frankly I have not
had the time to work with him much on that.

I was kneeling at his side, trying to hold his collar
while pushing his front legs down to the position,
while he resisted. Suddenly he lunged, knocking
me over onto the parking lot, and I lost grip of the
leash as I reflexively broke my fall.

Muttley took the opportunity to attack a young black
male Lab to my left, and it was a very brutal attack.
Janet and the instructors tried to gain control, and as
soon as I could get to my feet I grabbed the leash and
pulled him off.

That was  the end of the class, and the other dog,
Bernie, was taken to an animal hospital for treatment.

When everyone had left, Janet counseled me about
what should be done about Muttley.

She said this was more than ordinary aggression,
and only intensive (and expensive) one on one
training would have any chance at working, and
in any case, he was not suited to group training.

She advised me that Muttley could be dangerous,
and she recommended that he be euthanized.

&quot;They can't all be saved&quot;.

&lt;snip&gt;

&lt;snip&gt;

If I did not have to worry about my cat, I would
probably keep him, and I am certain I could avoid
any more dangerous episodes. I probably would
not have taken him to obedience classes at this time
if that was not such a difficult issue, and if people
here had not essentially shamed me into doing so.

Then he would only be a bratty dog with a mind of
his own, but he would not have been identified as
dangerous.

&quot;Muttley is really a very sweet and loving dog, but
he needs more socialization with other dogs. However,
it is very likely that I will have him put down in a week.&quot;

Please remember, I am not proposing banning the breed altogether,
just out of the city and suburbs. I would probably extend it if I
could to all large dogs, especially dogs bred to fight.  Something has
to happen.  While human deaths are relatively rare, animal deaths are
not and non fatal attacks are not as well.  And just because an attack
is non-fatal, doesn't mean the victim is ok.  The victim could be
walking with a limp or lost use or partial use of one of their arms or
hands...  Scarred faces, especially kids.  Imagine being a kid growing
up permanently scarred on your face.  How would you feel if it was
your child.  How would you feel if your nice well trained Pit was
attacked while on a leash and killed by a bigger meaner stronger Pit
then yours and killed?  How would you feel if your kids witnessed it?
There were at least 10 children around last night.  And I found out
this morning that the dog had been chasing the kids and they had to
run up on a porch with a gate to get away.  Had the dog been between
the steps and the kids and not on the other side, this story might
have been quite different.

Since owner refuse to handle these animals responsibly, they have to
go.  I should not have to suffer because some asshole down the street
gets a dog and can't raise it right or control it.

you have got to be kidding me. you really believe this crap?

if that pit bull had really meant to kill your 20 lb dog, your dog
would be dead or at least seriously injured, especially since you were
so busy freaking out about the dog being a pit bull to do anything
about it.

pit bulls cannot lock their jaws. pit bulls do not have the strongest
bite. that would go to either rottweilers or german shepherd dogs
(though i don't know if anybody's tested any of the serious mastiff
breeds).

Chris,
While I truly am sorry about your bad experience, you are certainly
preaching to the wrong group.  The folks who post here are the
responsible owners.  Many of the dogs here are Canine Good Citizens. My
dog is 8 years old and has never been outdoors without being on a leash.
We all support training, socialization, and positive education (not
for the dogs, for the humans who believe the breed should be banned).

Should the breed be banned to the farm?  Of course not.  Should a dog be
allowed to run loose in a neighborhood to threaten children and attack
other dogs?  Of course not.

You live in a city with leash laws and animal control officers.  If the
dog's owners are not responsible enough to protect him from situations
that can harm him, you are well within your rights to have the laws
enforced.

I personally feel sick every time I hear one of these stories.  It is
apparent the dog never had a chance to be the cared for, wonderful pets
we know.  And now the dog who doesn't choose its owner will most likely
be euthanized.

If freaking out includes kicking the dog, beating it with a leash with

steel trashcan by a passerby means &quot;freaking out&quot;, then yeah, I
freaked out.  This was mentioned in my original post.

While I am no expert on the subject, nor do I claim to be, EVERYTHING
i've ever heard to is to the contrary.  That Pit Bulls have the
strongest jaws of any dog and they can lock their jaws.  I don't know
how this is achieved, possibly by a forward shifting mechanism with a
bone lock, but that is just a guess.  And a rott, German Shepard or
great dane or any other massive dog would have had me do the same
thing and not attempt to grab the dog and throw it.  Just about any
other dog I would have done that to.

Chris,

First off, I'm very sorry to hear what happened to your dog.  Get him/her
checked over by a vet just in case.  There may be puncture wounds that are
hidden under the fur that could abcess and need draining and some
anti-biotics.

Next, call animal control if you haven't already.  File a report with as
much detail about the dog as you can.  And if you know who the passerby was
that also helped, get a statement from them too.  If you know who the owner
of this dog was, definitely make that known!  This owner is irresponsible
and doesn't deserve to own a dog at all regardless of breed.

You have clearly stated all along who the problem is...the people, the
owner, the human who chooses to not raise up a dog properly.  And THAT IS
the problem!!  Banning them from the cities and suburbs isn't going to help,
those irresponsible people will only get another breed or cross of dog.
Believe me, I have stats to back it up from more than one city.

I just come home from a 3 day conference on dangerous dogs and every expert
there was against banning a breed of dog.  The focus of the conference was
on how to deal with them, how to deal with lax dog owners and how to start
changing the way animal controls do their jobs so that people like you won't
have to be afraid to walk their dog.

Far too often animal control is inadequately funded and do not have the
officers available to respond quickly.  Nor do they have the time to follow
up on every call or complaint, and that's a shame.  Your dog may have only
been shaken up but it still warrants a call to animal control and that dog
owner must be found.  Chances are however that that owner has failed to
license the dog, failed to microchip the dog, and more obviously, failed to
contain the dog properly.  The dog owner needs to be punished and
unfortunately for that dog, it will likely die for it's owners' mishandling.

You sound like not only a responsible owner (and thank you for that) but a
reasonable person that can see logic and common sense.  Please realize that
the irresponsible owner you didn't get to encounter is the enemy here, not
the breed of dog.  Most of what the media prints on the &quot;pit bull&quot; is
nothing more than myths that have been spread since the early 1980's.
Locking jaw, bite strength, and vicious behaviour out of nowhere is all BS.
The irresponsible owner is also in the minority of dog owners.

I hope your dog is ok, and if you do find any puncture wounds and haven't
taken him to the vet, give me a holler, I can guide you through a fix.

I'm very sorry for your beautiful dog, but my concern for you when you
wrote, &quot;Pit Bulls need to be at minimum, baned from cities, ...Pit Bulls
are too strong and too capable of killing to be in a city...&quot;

Pit Bulls are not &quot;too&quot; anything, except misunderstood! If you're so
eager to have something banned, ban damned stupid, irresponsible pet
owners--especially those who own pit bulls.

&quot;At minimum...&quot;? Damn.

You have a nice day.

So you think a 60 KG rottie, grate dane, doberman or many other types of
dogs wouldn't have ripped your arm off and you could have picked it up and
throwen it or something? I know what your trying to say I had a cavilier
king charles spanniel &lt;tiny dog&gt; attaked by some inbreed idiots pit bull and
Know what it's like I had that dog since I was 9 years old it died when I
was about 21 when he died &lt;old age&gt;
But I now own a pit bull type dog who is super friendly, loves kids and is
only aggressive if the other dog is.
I would neverlet him wonder or walk him offleash now he's older.
