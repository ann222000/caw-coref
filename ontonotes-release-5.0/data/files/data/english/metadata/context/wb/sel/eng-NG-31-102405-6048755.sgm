Soggy,

I went to see Quo on the December 1990 tour at the NEC and support was
Dumpy's Rusty Nuts (one of the best names for a band ever!).

I remember seeing Dumpy's Rusty Nuts at the Cock Inn (Now the Robin  2) in
Bilston during the 80's. They were quite good if my memory serves me  right.

Maybe i can be of help on a couple of those gigs you listed:

UFO- MANCHESTER APOLLO 1982. Believe that would have been the Mechanix
tour i caught them on, if so then i'm sure it was Girl supporting with
Phil Lewis (LA Guns) on vocals and Phil Collen on guitar.

GILLAN - MANCHESTER APOLLO 1980 AND 1981. For the 1980 gid that would
have been for the Glory Road album, so if memory serves me correct it
was White Spirit (Janick Gers on the guitar) opening, followed by those
Brummies Quartz. As for 1981 no can help i'm afraid missed that tour.

Cheers TM.

Thanx for the info so far. It was indeed White Spirit and now I think
about it I think they may\have been support on following tour as well.
I remember Angel Witch and AIIZ now too. As for UFO., Im wondering if I
got the date wrong. It was the Wild the Willing and the innocent tour I
think.

I think the support on the 'Wild, Willing, and The Innocent' tour were  a
band called Fist. I'm not totally sure, although I know they supported UFO at
some point around that time.

Yes thats it! Its funny how when these names get mentioned I remember
them instantly. Thanks a lot Jacqui. Would the date be right for the
wild willing and innocent tour then?

Not sure really. I know the No Place To Run Tour was Dec79/Jan80. I think
the Wild Willing and The Innocent Tour was about a year or so later (Late
80/Early 81). I'm only guessing at this though.

You're right when you say how you remember these bands instantly when
somebody mentions them. I spent ages trying to remember who were the support act
for The Scorpions on the Animal Magnetism tour 1980, but just couldn't
remember. Then someone posted that it was Blackfoot and I could even picture  them on
stage after that.

I remember seeing Gillan in the early 80's, the support band when I saw
them was a Spanish band called Baron Rojo. Can't guarantee it was '81
though

Thanx for the help. Just thought Id update what Ive been able to
establish in case anyones interested.

SCORPIONS - MANCHESTER APOLLO 1980 - BLACKFOOT

UFO- MANCHESTER APOLLO 1982 - FIST
FOREIGNER - NEC 1982 - GAMMA
PETER GABRIEL - NEC 1987 - YOUSSOUF N'DOUR
GILLAN - MANCHESTER APOLLO 1980 AND 1981 1980 - WHITE SPIRIT AND QUARTZ
MARILLION - MANCHESTER APOLLO 1983 - PETER HAMILL
STATUS QUO GMEX 1990 - DUMPYS RUSTY NUTS
URIAH HEEP MANCHESTER APOLLO 1981 - ANGELWITCH AND AIIZ

Don't suppose anyone was at Jon Andersons song of seven tour. I seem to
think Chris Rainbow who played as part of the band may have done a solo
set to support. Can anyone confirm or deny this?

Sorry, if this duplicates what's already been said...

MAGNUM - MANCHESTER APOLLO 1989
I don't remember Magnum gigging in 1989???
In 1988 it was Kingdon Come in March. Can't remember who supported on
the December date.
In 1990 it was Dirty White Boy in September and Roko in December.

MARILLION - MANCHESTER APOLLO 1983 1985 1986
In Feb/March 1983 they were supported by Peter Hammill in Norwich
In January 1986 they were support by Beltane Fire in Norwich

MEAT LOAF - MANCHESTER APOLLO 1987 GMEX 1995
In 1987 he was supported by Shy at Wembley.
In 1994 or 1996 he was supported by a string quartet playing Meatloaf
songs!

I hope that helps.

I'll put up a list of my "gaps" sometime.
