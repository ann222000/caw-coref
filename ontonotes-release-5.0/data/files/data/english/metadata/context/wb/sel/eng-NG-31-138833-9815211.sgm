Hi everyone.  I'm forwarding a message from my friend Jenny (AKA Pigeon of
the VonFoxies burlesque troupe).  She organizing a show and is looking to
expand the diversity of her performers to round out the show.  So, please
ignore that she said the deadline was the 10th, but do be aware that you
need to submit your act idea ASAP!  Please forward this anyone who might
have an interest (and encourage them to participate).

Hey all. The Von Foxies had the privilege of performing in the Southwest
last summer in the Femmolition Derby. It was such a great experience I
wanted to recreate something like it here. A giant cabaret celebration of
Queer Femme art.
I've booked the Rainier Valley Cultural Center for Sat March 15th. I'm
looking for Burlesque, Drag, Draglesque, Spoken Word, Circus acts, Music,
Visual art, and Vending from people who choose the identity of Queer Femme
for all or most of their time.

Deadline to apply is February 10th
Please send a description of your act to vonfox ... @yahoo.com with attn.
Pidge in the subject line. I'll let everyone know Feb. 11th if your in. This
not a pick and choose process for me but a first come, I need your type of
act kind of thing.

Payment-
$25 per person per act is guaranteed and then a percentage of the door. Plus
one comp tickets.
I'll also give $25 and a comp ticket for anyone who can come up with a kick
ass name like Femmolition Derby. This is a carnival/circus type themed show.

And feel free to pass this on to any you feel would be interested. Thanks!
Pidge
