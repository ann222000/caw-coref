There's some cheezy music at the beginning...  Plus...it seems to go farther
than 110, so maybe they were shooting in a smaller jpeg size.  ??

They used a bargain flash card bought from eBay.  &lt;g&gt;

Ok, even if the camera is doing its own buffering, we can't be too

No.  The mirror is moving each time.  Otherwise, you couldn't track a moving
subject during the shoot.  It's pretty amazing, really.  Canon's Film body,
the 1NRS used to do 10fps (IIRC), but it had a pellicle mirror to accomplish
that.

Yes, but with manual focus only.  Familiarity with the innards of a DSLR's
focus system will explain why that is that way.  At the same time that the
mirrow is showing you the view, it's also guiding the image through the
focus system.  Once the mirror is flipped out of the way, the focus system
is inaccessible.

I think the flapping mirror approach is about to hit a wall.  Even with
the new 300,000 cycle shutter, that's only 8 hours at 10 fps.

But this means you have to rely on the LCD for manual focus...which is
woefully inadequate, especially for critical work.  There just aren't enough
pixels to really see.

For that reason, Canon came up with the ability to enlage a selected portion
of your live-view, manually-focussed frame and enlarge it either 5x or 10x.
This would at least give you a chance to check for critical focus on most
important point (I think this would be nice for macro work, which is usually
manual focus anyway).

The way they accomplish this noise reduction is this:

Normally, they use a magnet to release the mirror, and the spring-driven
motion slaps the mirror back into place.  During "silent mode" the mirror is
put down slowly (after the shot) using a low-voltage control of the
motor...so you avoid the slap.  After you're through shooting in this mode,
you have full control over when the cocking noise of the mirror occurs,
since it actually waits until you change modes to make the cocking "noise."
If you're standing near a bride...a golfer...or a President at a quiet,
critical moment...this mode could mean the difference between taking a shot
with...or without either getting kicked out, or at least getting an evil
scowl from Tiger Woods.

Why not have a dual focusing system: when using the LCD for framing, the
camera is autofocusing using some (local or global) characteristic of
the image on the sensor, and when framing through the viewfinder,
classical SLR focusing is used. Implementing this would just require
more integrated electronics, nothing mechanical.

I don't know the answer, but I'd wager they've determined that at this
point, it would require too many compromises.  Could it be done?  Sure.  I
just suspect it wouldn't cut muster with serious photo folks.

The requirements of clarity, sharpness, and resolution in video are MILES
lower than for still images.  Even the so-called high-def video's
definition/resolution/data would equate to only a relatively rudimentary

The reason why DSLRs use a separate focus system is for the speed.
One can't read out a large (multi-megapixel) array fast enough to
track focus.  The chips that do fast readout are using a different
mode of the electronics.  To take a picture, the live mode
must be stopped, the chip prepared for the real exposure,
then the exposure taken.  That is the method P&amp;S cameras
use and it is in general slower than moving a mirror out of the
way.  Shutter lag on the fast DSLRs is about 55 milliseconds,
many times faster than P&amp;S using live preview.  Also, the live
preview heats the chip adding noise to the image.  That heating
would hurt high ISO performance.

Also, when tracking fast moving subjects, optical viewfinders are
the fastest available: faster than live preview system.  While
viewing independent sensors and computers are monitoring
focus and even tracking the focus change, adjusting the lens
and when you press the shutter button, compute the best focus
and moving the focus of the lens to that point at the time
the shutter fires

So SLRs are not simply a holdover from film days: they
are a performance advantage.

Out in the wild, animals tend to notice your presence long before the sound
of your shutter would have a chance to bother them.  In the years that I've
photographed wildlife, I have yet to see a single time when the sound of my
shutter made any significant difference to the subject.ny wild creature.
And for that matter, it's not really much louder than 3 or 5 or 8fps...just
a more steady sound.  Think of it as a cricket.  They can chirp quickly or
slowly, but their chirping is about equally annoying, regardless.

If they're close enough to me for my shutter to matter...then *I* am close
enough to them that they care far more about my person...than teh sound fo
my shutter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Just about the same as what you see at 6 or 7 (which is plenty to keep
tracking a flying bird, or a running athelete)...maybe even more,
considering that they've reduced black-out times since I bought my 7fps EOS
3 in 1998 or so.

By delay, I mean the refresh/sampling rate on the LCD.  When it comes to
keeping up with action reality in 100% real time, then no.  None of them do,
and even those that come very close don'thave a refresh rate fast enough to
catch split-second timing, or a clarity fine enough to judge manual focus.
If you want to catch the ball as it comes off the bat, you can try to use
your non-viewfinder eye to keep track, but its nice to actually be able to
see it in the viewfinder, too.  When you're talking about small fractions of
a second, then even small EVF delays are a problem.

Or...suppose you're relying on EVF, and you turn your camera from a dark
scene--quickly to a very bright scene.  Most EVFs will take FAR longer to
readjust brightness than your eye can (through an optical), so you end up
looking at a blown out screen until it adjusts.  If you're folowing a player
or motorcycle or animal/bird as they're traveling from dark to light, or the
reverse of that, you run into problems.  The EVF will adjust, but not
necessarily in time to catch the shot, and even if it does, chances are
you'll become at least a little disoriented by the huge swings.

-If you've got a digital camera on hand, this is easy to test.  Point it
toward a fairly bright lamp, and then point it toward a part of the room in
shadow.  See it?  That's too slow.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but with manual focus only.  Familiarity with the innards of a
&gt;&gt; DSLR's focus system will explain why that is that way.  At the same time

&gt; This focusing method is an unnecessary carryover from the days of film.
&gt; One can directly use the image formed on the sensor to adjust focus--for
&gt; example, by trying to maximize the absolute differences between adjacent
&gt; pixels or some other  measure of sharpness. Maybe that's what P&amp;S cameras
&gt; use?
">

That is what P&amp;S cameras use - notice how P&amp;S cameras are slower and less
accurate than DSLR's? that is why!
Because DSLR a/f sensors are dedicated, and use a prism system, they are
able to not only measure how far out of focus the image is, but in what
direction. So the AF sensor looks at the image and tells the lens "your out
by this much, move by half a turn towards minimum focus and we'll be right".
The lens only "hunts" if the image is very low contrast or if the starting
point is a long way out of focus. This means they can move the lens to the
correct position very quickly, and even a moderately low contrast image can
still be focussed on, as long as there is sufficient contrast for the
sensors to be able to match the pattern on both sides of the prism.
If using the imaging sensor to do it, all you can look for is edge
contrast - move the lens until you have attained maximum edge contrast. The
focussing procedure goes something like this... I can't detect any edge
contrast, so I'll move the lens all the way to minimum focus. Ok, we're at
about 6 feet now and I can see some edge contrast. Keep moving toward
minimum focus. Edge contrast is improving so we know we are getting closer.
Ok, edge contrast just started getting worse, so move back a bit - there
it's improving again, good. Ok, that's the spot where it was at it's best,
so we'll stop there. In the case of a moderately low contrast image (that
the DSLR can still register), the camera goes "damn, can't see any contrast,
lets move the lens all the way out and see if we can find contrast. Nope,
still can't, lets go to hyperfocal distance and give up".
Because of the dedicated nature of the AF sensors in an SLR, and due to them
matching an image from both sides of a prism, they can handle much lower
contrast images than a P&amp;S can. The other issue comes in low light - the
noise in a P&amp;S can't be separated from the image, so it interferes with
their edge detection, as the camera tries to focus on the noise instead of
the image.
If a DSLR started to rely on the imaging sensor exclusively for focus, it
would lose one of the major benefits that DSLR technology has over DP&amp;S.

the fans are yelling and waving things to distract the shooter.

If the camera is well designed both limits are the same:

At lower fps rates you get pulses of the sound and shock (awesome)

might produce some interesting effects if sympathetic vibrations in
any of the camera's components, including the internal frame, have
any effect on the sensors or the filters above them.  At best the
sub-sonic to low audio freq. vibration might provide a poor man's
"Supersonic Wave Filter" to help displace pesky dust particles. &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think doing this with an SLR with mirror is stupid. It would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more effective and useful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if it was a live preview with electronic shutter. Kind of like a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;video camera with 10mp.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then does that mean, in your opinion, that 5fps with mirror is also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stupid? -Like the 30D or Nikon D200?  Or how about the D1
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;series...or 1 series at 8.5fps?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no substitute for an optical viewfinder when it comes to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fast action.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-At least not yet.   No EVF made to date is delay-free, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;most critical time you NEED zero viewing delay is in fast-moving
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;action. -That's why an EVF would not be helpful here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So how do people manage to shoot *video* of fast action?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh geez...  Apples to oranges.

&gt; The requirements of clarity, sharpness, and resolution in video are MILES
&gt; lower than for still images.  Even the so-called high-def video's
&gt; definition/resolution/data would equate to only a relatively rudimentary
&gt; sensor on a still camera.

I thought you were saying the delay of an EVF is the problem, in which
case my question is how videographers do it.

Are you instead saying the problem is that a mechanical shutter is
necessary to produce the best images?

It is sort of a one or the other thing, you can have a fast low res
sensor, or a slower hi-res sensor.
It is hard to make a hi-res fast sensor.  Video is all pretty low res
so the update rate can be very fast,
camera resolution being much higher slows the update rate way down.
Things are getting better in this regard and in 5-10 years hi-res +
fast frame rates might be the norm, but not for now.

&gt;&gt; If you're standing near a bride...a golfer...or a President at a

&gt; Aside from the camera stuff, this is something I've never understood.
&gt; Why are golf fans expected to be quiet? I can't think of another sport
&gt; (except chess; is that a sport?) where silence is required.
&gt; In baseball, the batter is expected to hit a ball with a bat while the
&gt; organ is playing and the fans are yelling like crazy; in football,
&gt; they are missing the organ, but the fans seem louder. In basketball,
&gt; the fans are yelling and waving things to distract the shooter.
&gt; What makes golf so much harder that silence is required?
">

These traditions have changed over the years for other sports.  When my
uncle played basketball in college, for example, the crowd behind the basket
would remain quiet during free-throws--even for the opposing team's
hots!  -It was considered common curtesy.  Now-a-days, you've got guys doing
everything they possibly can to distract players.  This would have been
considered totally unacceptable behavior back in "the day."

With golf, I suspect the tradition of silence may be more lasting partly
because the game of golf is normally played without a crowd...at least until
the pros.  People walk around a lovely grass field and tap a little ball
while enjoying the sunshine and little more noise than the breeze, birds and
water features.  I think part of it may have to do with this "norm" as
oppposed to other sports that typically have a cheering section all the way
from little league...to the pros.
Just my 2 cents, but it makes sense...

On the other hand...  Maybe golfers are just wimpy/  :)

On the third hand...  Golf is a game of sub-millimeter variances.  It takes
such a TINY amount of movement during a swing to alter the trajectory of the
ball, that golf may well be the most sensitive sport on Earth to even the
tiniest of flinches.  The only other sport I can think of that might be
similarly motion-sensitive is billiards/pool.

On the fourth hand...  I'm not much of a golfer, so who cares what I
think...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yipe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The mirror is locked throughout and what we hear is the shutter,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correct?

&gt;&gt;&gt; That would be the logical way of doing it.  So no.

&gt;&gt; Uh...logical only to you, Rich, as a guy with no experience using a
&gt;&gt; DSLR... ...If the mirror stayed lockd up through out, you'd be
&gt;&gt; shooting completely blind!  -Ever try tracking a flying bird without
&gt;&gt; looking at it??

&gt; Only if you are too dim to figure out a solution.  They could easily
&gt; use a small sensor (like the Olympus E-330 uses) as a &quot;pick off&quot;
&gt; sensor and allow an uniterrupted image to be seen during firing.  Give
&gt; Canon a couple years, then they'll adopt it like they do so many other
&gt; innovations not of their own.
">

But they don't need to.  You can already see just fine through the
viewfinder while shoot as it is.  Do you really want to track birds by
holding your camera out in front of you?  I wouldn't...
