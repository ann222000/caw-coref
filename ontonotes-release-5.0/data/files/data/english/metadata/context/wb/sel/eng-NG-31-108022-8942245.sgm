New Orleans French Toast (Pain Perdu)

(4 servings)

8 slices stale French bread (about 1-1/4 inches thick)
4 large eggs - beaten
1 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 dashes of fresh nutmeg
4 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons powdered sugar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

In a large bowl combine the milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla and nutmeg and mix
thoroughly. Soak the slices of bread in the custard mixture until they're
thorougly soaked. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy skillet and add the oil.
When the butter and oil mixture is very hot, fry the soaked bread slices one or
two at a time on each side, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and hold in
a warm oven until all the slices are prepared. To serve, sprinkle with cinnamon
and powdered sugar mixture just before serving. Serve with Louisiana cane syrup,
a strongly-flavored honey or any good syrup of your choice.
