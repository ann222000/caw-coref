Florentine Pasta Salad

4 servings

Sun dried tomato-pesto dressing
1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped (Not packed in oil)
1/3 cup water
1/2 garlic clove, chopped
1 tablespoon red onions, chopped (1/4 small onion)
1/2 (7 ounce) package pesto sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Pasta Salad
2 ounces dry linguine or fettuccine pasta or spaghetti
1/4 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced (.6 ounces)
1 cup fresh spinach, shredded
2 tablespoons pine nuts or slivered almonds, toasted

Place sun dried tomatoes in glass bowl with 1/3 cup water, and microwave
uncovered on HIGH for 2 minutes. Set aside until they have absorbed the
water and cooled (20 minutes). Cook pasta according to package directions
for al dente pasta (8-10 minutes); drain. Rinse with cold water, and drain
again. In a skillet or wok, over high heat, saute mushrooms. Blend garlic,
onions, cooled tomatoes, and pesto sauce. In a large mixing bowl, combine
pesto mixture and lemon juice. Add pasta; toss to coat. Add spinach and
mushrooms; mix well. Sprinkle with nuts; serve immediately.
