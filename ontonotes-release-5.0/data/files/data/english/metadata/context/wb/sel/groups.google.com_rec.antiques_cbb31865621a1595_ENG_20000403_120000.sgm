Is there any way to tell the difference
between these two metals? I'm sure
experience is the best teacher but I have none, is there an easy way
without damage to the pieces. TIA

"/> Hi Doris,

Pewter can sometimes look a bit like silver when it is highly
polished, but the resemblance soon fades with wear and tarnish.
Could you give a few more details about the pieces in question -
what they are, how old, details of wear and marks?

It should be relatively easy to distinguish between solid silver
and pewter, and also between EPNS and EPC and pewter. EPBM
(electroplated Britannia metal) could be more problematic,
especially if well worn. Britannia metal is actually type of
pewter.

Cheers,

Jane

Jane, Thanks for asking. This is the silent butler I asked about before.
I thought it was silver (I don't know why). But I have been in touch
with some silver web sites
and none can identify the maker. So I
thought , &quot;maybe it's not silver&quot;. Which is why I can't get an
identification. Any way
I've had this piece for almost 30 yrs., and
I promise I have never polished it. It has been hanging on the
fireplace. The inside is very bright, I'm pretty sure it is silver.
The outside has some tarnish , blackish
color. On the lid there is one section that has no tarnish but looks
pink,I think it must have been cleaned at sometime,
The high spots on the lid are the parts that look pink.(cleaning wear?)
There are no marks on the bottom except the initials
J possibly an L or fish hook S (JLS)
I can't seem to find this person unless
it's some other kind of mark. One man told me the fish standing on it's
tail was familiar to him but he coudn't place it.
I haven't heard any more from him. So
with all this info, is it silver, or pewter?
Thanks for your help Jane.

"/> If there are pinkish spots showing through, then it's almost certainly
silver plate over copper. Often happens on high spots or patterns
which have been cleaned a lot. I have never seen silent butlers in
pewter, most being silver plated. Not to say by any means that there
are/were none ever made. Have several silver plated ones of my own and
also a brass one with tortoishell lid and a very nice porcelain one
which is lovely. They make interesting and affordable collections.

Mike and Liz, Thank you. My original question was generic with this
piece in mind,but after Jane wanted to know more
I really looked close and took it to different light which is when I
noticed the pinkish color. Back to the original. I know you can use a
magnet to tell metals from ore, is there a way to differentiate(I don't
think I
ever wrote this word before sp?) silver from pewter if there are no
marks?

The magnet test tells ferrous metals from nonferrous metals, i.e. iron
and steel from everything else. Pewter always looks more grayish than
silverish to me, even if polished. I don't know of any nondestructive
test other than the appearance that can distinguish the two, maybe
someone else will.

Thanks Richard, I guess I'll have to go to
a shop and look at the difference for myself. I figured this must be a,&quot;

Doris,

Here's a quick trick I used to use before my eye got a little better
trained.

Try a little silver polish on an inconspicuous place. Silver (&amp; of course
silver plate) turns the cloth black a lot quicker than pewter will.... You
will expend a lot of energy before you darken your polishing cloth if you
are working on pewter. Try this on a piece that you know is pewter &amp; then on
one of silver &amp; you'll see what I mean.

The few times that silver did not transfer dark black tarnish immediately to
the polishing cloth, the objects were very old (150-185 years) coin silver.
I don't know why they were more resistant to polishing, but it took
prolonged gentle rubbing to begin the process, but once it began to happen,
the light cloth got very black in a hurry......

Fortunately, these pieces were simple teaspoons, of no significant design or
maker, so if I ruined them by working at polishing them, nothing great was
lost. (I guess if I had it to do over I would check with someone smarter
than I before I tackled them. &lt;G&gt;)

Thanks that is a very neat trick, I hope Richard sees this. I know
what you mean about getting something cleaned up, then wondering if you
just ruined it. But once you get it home you just have to see .

Doris and/or donnamel - no, I don't see the trick your referring to, as
my news server is wonderful about missing postings. The only post I've
seen from donnamel was in the thread on antique atheletic equipment.
Would you mind reposting it, or forwarding it by email? (You've got me
curious what I'm missing &lt;g&gt;)

Thanks, and thanks to Doris for emailing me with it. I don't know why
it is, but some posts just never seem to show up on the news service my
ISP uses. At times I end up trying to piece together the discussion
from the replies without ever seeing the main message.
