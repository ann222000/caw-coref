EMC/EMI are difficult tasks that many electronics engineers are
facing. Often due to space and cost constraints, some so called golden
rules can not be followed 100% and sometimes you just do not know
where the noise comes from. Experiences defintely count here.

I'd like to seek advice from the experienced engineers here on the
topics of immunity, in paticular, Electrical Fast Transient (also
called burst), Conducted Immunity (CI, sometimes called Current
Injection) and Radiated Immunity (RFI). ESD/Surge are a bit different.

There are quite some different standards covering different
requirement. Still IEC61000-4-x standards are often the base.

Wow.  Broad question, that.  Can you narrow it down a bit?

At any rate, I went to a seminar about 8 months ago by
Kimmel and Gerke, and I'd recommend it.  Covered SI in
circuits and all manner of noise and immunity issues.

The short answer is &quot;Understand the noise and provide
it with as low impedance a path to ground as possible.&quot;

The long answer can be summarized in two to three eight
hour lectures.

What I'd like to see is the sharing of experiences with EMI
(especically EFT/CI/RFI).

Let me start. My first job as a real electronics engineer
is to troubleshoot the EMI problem for a capacitive level
sensor in a metal housing. It failed EFT/CI/RFI as well as
ESD. After solving some other performance
related problems and two relayout, I managed to get the
sensor passed all the tests except RFI. Only then I started
to think about more on the design and I found out the problem
was related to a high bandwidth peak-dector. Adding a small
resistor solved the problem.

Oooooh!  I like that idea- get the experiences out there so
everyone can learn!

A customer was having difficulties on one machine with
&quot;every sensor&quot; they put on it.  After a long travel from here
to northern Japan and a couple of days of troubleshooting,
the problem was nailed down to a FireWire cable which
did not have the shield adequately grounded to the chassis.

&quot;Every sensor&quot; turned out to be BOTH of the sensors they
tried (in fairness, changing sensors is NOT trivial, so I
probably wouldn't have tried more than two, either), and
by some weird happenstance, those two happened to be
the only two of the several dozen they had with bad
shields.  Thus:

Proper connection of cable shields is critical- anytime
communications goes wonky that should be one of the
first things to get checked.

That's half of it IMHO. The other half is to encourage it to choose that path
by making your sensitive parts appear to have a high impedance.

My last real job was on a new generation of PLC type product. The previous
generation had a reputation of not being very robust. So the new one had to
be super tough. We probably put a couple of man-years into studying what
worked and what didn't in our lab. We built NEMA and IEC standard test
gear, had scopes in faraday cages, built ESD guns and so on.

What came out of it for me, was an intuitive feel for how to solve or rather,
prevent noise issues.

A few general sweeping statements -
What works for ESD will also be effective for RFI. What works for RF
coming in will also be effective for RF going out.
Keep currents out. A static discharge is a current pulse. Current
magnetically couples and a magnetic field is very hard to suppress. Distance
is your best defence against magnetic coupling.

Consider everything from a high frequency electric field's perspective. What
does it 'see' as being high impedance and what is low impedance ?
Keep thinking &quot;voltage division&quot;. It is the key that everyone misses.

If you have a voltage divider with a high impedance in the top and a low
impedance in the bottom, the result is a low voltage on the output. If you just
have a high impedance and no low impedance to ground, you haven't
achieved anything.
Putting that into the context of noise reduction - A wire with a ferrite bead or
a track over a ground plane are not very effective on their own. Put the two
together and you get a result.

We got a pretty good result with the controller too. It had memory mirroring
(each word/byte compared at each fetch) and a latching watchdog that
required a manual reset to clear, so it would be pretty hard for a glitch to go
undetected.
We could run a 6&quot; spark down the outside of the case and blew up the
CPU's serial port (with no optos) by putting 240VAC on it and it never
missed a beat. We performed countless other attrocities too. EMC can be
fun.

Nearly all of that was from layout techniques and simple components like
R's and C's. It can be done.
