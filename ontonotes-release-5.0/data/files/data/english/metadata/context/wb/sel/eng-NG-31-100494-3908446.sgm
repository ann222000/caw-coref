Hi,
Newbie to the group and look forward to participating.

I have a 1998 Eagle Talon TSi AWD.  I would like to change the fuel
filter, but do not know if this is a do-it-yourself job or a garage
job.  I have heard that some fuel filters are in the gas tanks on some
cars.  Where is my fuel filter and is it easy to change?  I think I
read somewhere that people use pencils to plug the hoses during the
change to slow gas leaking out.  I look forward to any helpful
suggestions; I'm sure I'll have more questions...Thanks.

On the 2g's, it's underneath the battery, back by the firewall.  Can be
quite difficult to reach.  If you go ahead and do it yourself, be sure to
allow PLENTY of time and just take it easy.  Don't get frustrated.  It's
very hard to reach...  Personally, I had a shop do it (I'm close to
Buxchurs, so I had them do it since they're DSM pros).

Thanks for the info.  I'm still on the fence about whether I'm going to
give it a try myself.  Not sure how much parts and labor would be...I
appreciate the response.
