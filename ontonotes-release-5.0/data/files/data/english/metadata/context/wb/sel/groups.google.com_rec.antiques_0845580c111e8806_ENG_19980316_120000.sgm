My late mother's collection of over 2,000 owl antiques &amp; collectables is
going to be auctioned and I am doing what I can to put the word out to
potentially interested collectors. If you like owls, or specific types
of collectables, please read on. Apologies in advance if this is in
improper format for your NG.

The items have been sorted and cataloged. The variety is astonishing
(everything from jewelry to salt'n'pepper shakers, secret society pins
and memorabilia to fine crystal, red glass to pewter to stone, paintings
to carvings, bottles, brickabrac, etc. You name it, she probably had
it.). The person handling the sale has cataloged over 750 items as
&quot;superior quality,&quot; and there are many more that are cute, unique, or
rare, or that might suit collectors of specific or unusual items.
Several of the smaller pins are in an online auction now

(if you wish to see the pins go to
&lt;http://cayman.ebay.com/aw/search.html&gt; and look for dmweich ... @aol.com
using the portion of the search engine for finding seller's addresses.
Then follow the links to the owl pins).

If you are interested in finding out if there is an owl collectable
you'd like to add to your collection, or are looking for a specific type
of collectable or antique and wish to inquire if there are any in this
sale, please feel free to contact &lt;dmweich ... @aol.com&gt;. I myself will be
happy to answer what questions I can, but am unfamiliar with the full
detail of all the items. As I said, there are over 2,000. Last time I
tried to just count them, I gave up after 450!

Thanks for your interest and patience, and again - apologies if this
does not fit the usual format for your NG.

Matt
