Barry Bonds pursuit of the home run record is the only reason the
sports media has desperately tried to keep the steroid controversy
alive. The general public does not care about steroids in baseball.
Baseball fans are attending games in record numbers. Baseball revenues
are higher than ever. Baseball franchises are worth more than ever.
Baseball owners profits are at record levels. Baseball players
salaries are higher than ever. Steroids scandals have not dampened fan
interest or enthusiasm one iota. Bonds is now the all time home run
king. It is a fait accompli. Even the most maniacal rabble rousing
sport talk show host will face an impossible mission trying to
generate any more anti Bonds hysteria now that he has hit 756.

What is the reason for this vast conspiracy?  Do you think it might
have something to do with keeping Pete Rose out of the Hall of Fame?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The general public does not care about steroids in baseball.

Why does the media &quot;desperately&quot; want to keep the steroid conspiracy
alive?  Is it because they know that people won't buy the magazines
and newspapers that talk about steroids?  Is it because they know
that people will switch the channel when talking heads discuss
steroid use?

One of the things never discussed is how the steroid scandal has
affected Baby Bonds marketability in the endorsement world.  Perhaps
that's because Baby Bonds doesn't have any marketability?  He
doesn't have any huge endorsement deals.  We submit that it is not
the steroid scandal that people have turned away from - it's Baby
Bonds that everyone is bored with.

You certainly have not thought things through and we are somewhat
disappointed you have chosen this forum to troll.  Your submission
is far, far, below the intellectual standard that the regulars of
this newsgroup have, for a long time, demanded.

You are invited to bugger off.

cordially, as always,

------ NO WAY!  ONLY IN YOUR TEENY MIND, DOOF!  ----

ASTONISHINGLY, like the millions of U.S.citizens who still believe
Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attacks, many benighted fans of
BALCO Barry still believe he would have reached 756 home runs without
using illegal, banned, proscribed, unfair, cheatful-chemical
performance-enhancement drugs!

Considering he was on a pace to hit 630 HRs, or less, when he started
taking undetectable steroidic supplements as he reached age 36, one's
intelligence and powers of reasoning would have to be low to even
consider such a notion.

And to weakly, limp-wristedly accept that his weight soared from 200
pounds to 265 inside of one calendar year due to &quot;conditioning&quot; is
beyond credulity.

Funny, anal-vents call Big-Head the &quot;greatest player ever,&quot; while
conveniently forgetting that during BALCO's highly unlikely batting-
binge years -- HIS FIELDING DURING THAT TIME WAS ATROCIOUS!

(Two-hundred versus 265 pounds!)

But, some sphincter-fissures are simply unable to analyze and make
connections, aren't they?

The explosion of power hitting in the late 90s saved MLB from
oblivion. Sosa, McQwire and Bonds put up astounding numbers that had
fans, TV networks, advertisers and Baseball owners in ecstasy. After
Canseco wrote his book and the Congress took an interest in the
steroids issue, the sanctimonious hypocritical Lords of Baseball
suddenly turned into Casablanca's Captain Renault; shocked, shocked
that there is widespread steroid use going on in baseball. Chicks love
the long ball and steroids were the salvation of MLB over the past ten
years.

Of course, the difference between Bonds and Ruth is that Ruth didn't use
performance enhancing drugs.  Neither did Aaron.  Bonds is home run king,
but only on a technicality.

You're right this whole steroid 'controversy' is media driven led by
ESPN.  ESPN talking heads pretend to speak for the fans but they only
speak for the fans that buy ESPN's villification of Bonds. By always
associating steroids with the daily story of Bonds chasing the home
run record, ESPN can talk about steroids everyday. The last 3 years of
this media driven controversy should be the subject of a textbook
study on how the media tries to shape  public opinion. Eugene McCarthy
once said the media are like birds on a telephoph wire, they fly off
and on in unison. On steroids, sports reporters seemed to vie with
each other to see who could make the cheapest hit on Bonds. Cheap hit
artists on a moral high horse are insufferable.  The media works hand
in glove as PR people for the law and order powers like Police, DAs
and the War on Drugs bureaucracy, a beast that needs new substances
i.e. steroids to get fatter.  The view of the media on steroids is
distorted by the media's agenda, the general public has a more
realistic view of the situation than the one that the media is feeding
them.

This isn't 100% true at all.
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/john_donovan/04/19/vinc...
Fay Vincent, as commissioner, put steroids on baseball's list of
banned substances. The union never agreed to it, which means
technically the players didn't have to adhere to it, but if the
commissioner puts it on a list of banned substances, it's there for
all to see and value. Just because Bonds and others didn't adhere to
this commissioner's edict doesn't mean it wasn't against MLB rules.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Greg Anderson, a convicted steroid trafficker and Bonds' personal
trainer who gave Bonds steroid substances by Bonds' own admission, has
seen Bonds take steroids; why else is he refusing to testify?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not true. While he may never have failed a steroids test, did he not
fail another drug test last year?
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/01/11/bonds.amphet...

Furthermore, &quot;never failed&quot; a steroid test is irrelevant; I don't
think Flo-Jo ever failed one, either. Nor did many (or all?) of the
East German female athletes in the Olympics, etc. Cheaters always have
to stay ahead of testing technology; hence, the &quot;cream&quot; and the

to cheat?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

he will spend the rest of his life in jail -- or he will eventually

&gt; So lack of being caught is evidence of guilt?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bonds has never been convicted of taking steroids.

&gt;&gt;Yet. Greg Anderson again is refusing to testify on this. Why? If he
&gt;&gt;could clear Bonds, he would. Since all he can do is implicate Bonds,
&gt;&gt;he will spend the rest of his life in jail -- or he will eventually talk.

&gt; Again, it doesn't work that way.  It's nobody's job to &quot;clear&quot; Bonds.

The commissioner has the power to act in the best interests of
baseball; the player's union only acts in their own best interests,
obviously -- and even in this case, not so much.

The memo was circulated to all organizations; the players knew what it
meant, and if they felt they could do it and get away with it anyway,
that doesn't change the intention of the commissioner's action
whatsoever. The commissioner put it on the banned substances list.

It might be a nice loophole for a Bonds/Sosa/McGwire apologist,
however.

Bonds admitted taking substances that are steroids; he can label them
whatever he wants to in attempt to protect himself legally, but he
took the steroids Anderson gave him. That is as much of an admission
Bonds will ever give: a legal half-truth, at best. He took steroids;
he admitted he took substances Anderson gave him. Those substances
were steroids.

In this country, even with testimony, we don't convict the guilty --
ask O.J. And again, if Anderson could clear Bonds with his knowledge,
he would. His choice to not testify can only be based on one thing:
why else would he choose to sit in jail away from his daughter? If he
could get out of jail, he would.

Furthermore, this Internet discussion is not a court of law; please
don't treat it like one. That's the feds' job, and they'll handle it
without your posturing.

No, they said they couldn't confirm nor deny, etc.: privacy issues,
thanks to the player's union, etc. If it was a &quot;false&quot; story, Bonds
would/should have sued the New York Daily News. Just like he should
have sued the two Chronicle writers if they had published &quot;lies&quot;.

- When asked last night whether Bonds had an explanation for why he
failed the test or if he wanted to issue a denial, Bonds' agent, Jeff
Borris, said, &quot;I have no comment on that.&quot;
- Giants officials did not return calls seeking comment last night.
- Sweeney declined comment, but his agent, Barry Axelrod, told the
News, &quot;Mark was made aware of the fact that his name had been brought
up, but he did not give Barry Bonds anything and there was nothing he
could have given Barry Bonds.&quot;
- &quot;We're not in a position to confirm or deny, obviously,&quot; MLB
spokesman Rich Levin said.
- Axelrod would not comment on the conversation between Orza and
Sweeney.
- Orza also refused to comment on what he said to Sweeney or about
Bonds' failed test.

No one is denying its veracity; they are just going the &quot;no comment&quot;
route.

By itself, certainly not. But when there's a BALCO paper trail big
enough to wallpaper my 5,000-sq. ft. house in Belmont, you don't need
a positive test to figure out the truth. Bonds apologists can cite the
lack of a positive test all they want, but it's irrelevant to the feds
and the public. However, that in itself may be the only reason Bonds
was still allowed to play baseball after the publication of _Game of
Shadows_.

There are many examples of Olympic athletes we all know were cheating,
but no one could ever catch them doing it. The lack of a positive test
doesn't mean innocence.

You don't know federal procedure very well then: the government is
only going to pursue this when they have irrefutable evidence. Since
Greg Anderson won't talk (yet) and they have all the BALCO documents,
they are finding other ways to verify the information. If and when
they indict, it's as good as a conviction. This kind of high profile
case is not going to be blundered by the feds. The fact they keep
extended the grand jury and keeping Anderson behind bars tells us two
things: 1) They know Bonds is guilty of perjury, and they are finding
other witnesses besides Anderson to prove it; 2) Even with those other
witnesses, they still want Anderson's testimony to show the public you
do not stonewall the feds.

The heart of this case (which is not relevant to baseball) is about
Bonds' public life; just like Martha Stewart and Al Capone (and every
famous person in between), the feds will nail you if they really want
to.

Dude, I am not trying the case. Stop making this personal. The feds

his HGH/steroid parties.

really want to ignore it:

- Everyone else is doing it, too!
- Technically, it wasn't illegal!
- He never tested positive!
- Conspiracy!
- Racism!
- Envy!

What ever happened to good, old American honesty and integrity,
people? Just because the U.S. President lies to us doesn't mean our
sports icons should do so as well.

Yes, perhaps that's an off-base comparison, but seriously -- Bonds is

Barry Bonds haters cite the pile of hearsay garbage written in Game of
Shadows as absolute, incontrovertible, 100% proof that he took
steroids. According to the anti Bonds koolaid drinkers, Wada &amp;
Williams presented tons of smoking gun evidence sufficient to convict
Bonds in the eyes of any judge and jury in the universe. 18 months
after the book's publication, prosecutors still don't have enough to
get the Grand Jury to even deliver an indictment; never mind a
conviction. Keep in mind that the cliche about a Grand Jury's
willingness to indict a ham sandwich is no canard. Game of Shadows,
for all its hype and bombastic promotion in the sports media, did not
present enough tangible evidence to prove a gattdam thing. The book
was nothing more than sensationalized over hyped horseshit that
enabled the authors to laugh all the way to the bank..

And lots of people dealt with Flo-Jo and Carl Lewis and Lance
Armstrong and all kinds of other folks, and nobody ever &quot;proved&quot;
that they did steroids either.  In fact, the only &quot;proof&quot; that has
ever been accepted is a failed drug test.

If anyone came out and stated that they actually saw these people do
steroids, they would likely be sued, unless they happened to be
Canseco.

And since nobody has come out and won the Pulitzer by proving
steroid use, your argument must be that nobody, except those with
failed tests, have ever done steroids.

Stick with the Real Estate stuff.  Or you could try Family Law.

And Babe Ruth also did not have the luxury of being pitched to by
lousy Taiwanese journeymen.  Your point is stupid.  There is no proof
whatsoever that the black players of Ruth's time would've been able to
diminish his numbers.  You could equally well argue that the larger
number of teams now, many of which are vastly outspent by the titans,
results in lots of subpar pitching for Bonds to crush, a luxury not

">

The commissioner may have the power to act in the best interests but has
often against the best interests of baseball. Consider:

1) Kenesaw Mountain Landis prevented Bill Veeck from buying the Phillies
since Veeck intended to hire Negro League players. The guy who bought
the team, William D. Cox, only owned the team for one year after betting
on the Phillies. Landis, a racist, prevented Negro League players to
join the &quot;majors&quot; as long as he lived.
2) Landis also unilaterally ruled that Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker and Smoky
Joe Wood did not with Dutch Leonard on the final day of the 1919 season.
3) A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler suspended Leo Durocher for the 1947 season,
largely to support Larry McPhail.
4) Peter Ueberroth was instrumental in the owners' collusion of 1984-86
when owners deliberately fought against the best interests of baseball.
Owners had to pay nearly $330 million to players to compensate the
players for deliberately holding down salaries.
5) The owners fired Faye Vincent since he was deemed unwilling to work
in their best interest and replaced him with Bud Selig, the stooge, who
essentially continued to own the Brewers for years while also
Commissioner.

If the players' union only acted in their best interest, then a Ronald
Reagan judicial appointee would have ruled in favor of the owners after
the 1994 season instead of the players.

Horrific news for Barry Bonds haters:

Barry just hit 757 tonight. This one was a monster blast that landed
in the middle of McCovey Cove. At this rate, Bonds may well play
another year or two and go for a mind-boggling, astounding 800 Home
Runs. Even A-Rod would have one hell of a mountain to climb if he ever

Look back at various points of his career, too, and not just once he
became a Giant. Even as a Pirate, he hit a fair number of home runs in
numerical order. And since he came to the Giants, you could close your
eyes and throw a dart at a list of his home runs, and, assuming you hit
the list, chances are excellent that whatever home run the dart hit
would've been hit in numerical order. In fact, as of last night Bonds
set the career record for home runs hit in numerical order.

Compare and contrast to Duane Kuiper, who hit *his* home runs in reverse
