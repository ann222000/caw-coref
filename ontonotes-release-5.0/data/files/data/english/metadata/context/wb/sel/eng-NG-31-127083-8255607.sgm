Two (one being my ex-husband who was The Asshole and the other a
former co-worker).  That's why May 21st is International Assholes Day.
Funny thing was that several years ago I was getting information on an
absent father (I work in welfare) and the woman commented that he was
a real asshole.  I jokingly asked if he was born on May 21st at which
her jaw dropped and she asked me how I knew.

Many years ago, I started a new job.  There was a woman there who
intially hated me at sight.  It took quite some time for things to be
civil enough for me to find out that I looked a lot like her
ex-asshole husband.  It had nothing to do with me otherwise.
&quot;Asshole&quot; does not always have to be a bad word.  I suspect what you
had was a &quot;Flaming, Roaring Asshole&quot;, a special variant that tends to
be malicious, petty, overbearing, and undergifted.
Most of the rest of us are likeable fools who are not obsessed about
what people think, and go our merry disasterous ways fucking up
everything without bothering people all that much, other than making
them laugh.
Many comedians are likable assholes, for example. Consider Rodney
Dangerfield, who portrays the Loser variety of asshole.

Actually, my ex-husband's *friends* dubbed him The Asshole.  You'd
think I'd have paid attention.  Turned out they were right.  On
another NG in which I used to participate that was cross posted to
some outfit called soc.men the members there of the He-Man Woman
Haters Club assumed that I was a bitter ex-wife when I referred to my
ex as The Asshole.  They simply would not believe me that he was
dubbed such by his friends.  'Tis true.
I love your &quot;asshole&quot; descriptions.  You do make me laugh and that's
one of my top three favorite things to do.  Thanks.

The Coveted Oak Leaf Cluster is awarded for a lifetime of disasterous,
horrible faux pas events, showing a monumental, colossal lack of
social skills with irrecoverable consequences.  Not ANY asshole can
get one.  You have to be a &quot;Born Again Asshole&quot;!

The Supreme Queen Bitch Cluster is similar, but is based on Poison Oak
Leaves.
The following are some of  Qualifying Events.

1) Being overcome with uncontrollabe laughter at funerals.  Extra
credit for singing &quot;The Worms Crawl In, the Works Crawl Out&quot; song.

Oak Leaf Cluster Award, Grade One.

2) Old friend shows up with new girlfriend.  Party proceeds, various
forms of intoxication.  Current event: Plane crash, short of runway,
many killed.  Rousing ridiculing comedy skits of pilot using Radar
Altimeter at low tide.
Friend calls next day: &quot;Her father was the FE on that flight and it
was his voice on the Cabin Area Microphone.&quot;

Instant Oak Leaf Cluster Award, Grade Two, With Two Puckered Stars.

3) Division President sends out memo, showing poor understanding of
English Language.  Correct it with red marker, grade it &quot;C-&quot;, put on
bulletin board in office. Forget all about it.
Year later: President appears, says, &quot;Can you make a copy of this
yearbook proof of my son with the Polaroid Copy Camera? I need it for
the newspaper&quot;.
(Son is dying of cancer).
Turn and see President staring at (forgotten) graded paper...

Please tell me all of this really didn't happen to you... I can
identify with the uncontrollable laughter at funerals, although I
didn't sing the worms song. I cleverly disguised it as a coughing
fit.

I will have to come up with some Qualifying Events to attain the
Poison Oak Leaf Cluster for the Supreme Queen Bitch award. There are
so many ... :)

Um.  Actually I did that once.  The soloist was, well, laughable.  Oh,
then again when a kid in my high school committed suicide.  Now, mind

Now, that has nothing to do with being a bitch or asshole.  I mean,
who knew?  I could qualify for the Grade Two then because I once (in

OK.  What do I get for this one?  My GMF, several years ago, was
seeing another woman at the same time that he was seeing me.  She was
&quot;just a friend&quot; of course.  Ahem.  Anyway, this one night I just
&quot;happened&quot; to be driving by his house and saw her car there.  For some
reason or other my courage was up so I parked my car, went up to the
front door and knocked.  GMF opened door and looked rather, um,
guilty, but invited me in.  There was &quot;the other woman&quot; sitting at the
dining room table with glass of wine.  Now, I wasn't supposed to know
this, but I did - that she'd had breast implants.  So, I gave her a
good look in the chest and then announced to her that she'd wasted her
money.  Oddly enough, I was asked to leave.  I always referred to the
woman as The Titmonster (from Designing Women).  She finally got
married and moved away - &quot;Ding Dong the bitch is gone, which old

HAHAHAHA. I'm glad that you are going to a Braves game. Will this be
your first? Or you just always wanted to go to one at Turner Field?
Was that it?

Yes, you get a stamp on your butt cheek when you're a USDA-Approved
Bitch. It's kind of like a tattoo but not really. You should get one,
too. That and our Poison Oak Leaf Clusters. We can match. :)

I'll be in Napa Valley (Windsor) Oct. 19-26. Is that near you, or are
you more in the southern half of the state?

It was supposed to be a trip with my mother, but my mother decided to
invite a bunch of her friends, some of whom I don't even like. Oh, and
don't forget one friend's daughter, who I won't, um, have much in
common with, given her predilection for marrying drug-using ex-
convicts and then taking out restraining orders and such against them
after they wave guns at her and kick in doors. Not that there's
anything wrong with that, you understand. It's just not an experience
I share, asshole though my ex was. My mother, however, is convinced
that we will have *loads* in common, simply because we are the same
age. Huh??

I was wondering how on earth I'd make it through a week with my mother
without smoking. Now, I'm wondering how I'm going to make it through
without heavy drugs. It's a good thing I'll be in Napa where the wine
floweth freely. My plan is to stay half-crocked the entire time. Let
me know if you're nearby and can provide an escape route.

My ex-husband qualifies on so many levels, but here's one prime

When our 4 children were small he said to me, &quot;If you don't quit
smoking you're going to die and stick me with these fucking kids.&quot;
There were also the innumerable times he told me that I had the

First, a Paid Storyteller stands there claiming &quot;He's not really

Then a  number go to watch the person dropped into a hole in the

Sue! That's a lovely story! Good for you! Ding dong the bitch is gone,
indeed.

Here's one for me: Perhaps you know this already, but my ex cheated on
me with a woman I considered to be a good friend -- one of my best
friends, actually. I haven't spoken a word to her since the day I
found out years ago, despite the letter she put in the mailbox just
afterward. (She was sorry. Like she'd broken a vase or something. Give
me a fucking break.)

Anyway, after I had divorced him and moved from Salt Lake City to
Atlanta, in late 2004, he sent me a commemorative Spode plate, like he
did every year, even though I didn't want them and gave them all to
the Salvation Army when I moved. Apparently he thought I'd want to
commemorate the worst year of my life.

So I wrapped it back up nicely and shipped it to my ex-friend -- who
was still seeing him at the time. On the gift card, where he wrote
something sappy, I wrote, &quot;This has my name on it but it apparently is
meant for you.&quot;

I hear it caused quite the stir, and she dumped him shortly
thereafter.

It's not quite having the balls to knock on the door, like you did.
But it's still one of my shining moments.

You should be proud for exhibiting such a stroke of genius and moxie.
What a great story.  The Asshole also screwed around behind my back
but I didn't know this until some, oh, 12 years later when he
confessed to our oldest daughter.  It wasn't exactly a confession -
more like a brag fest.  She's not talked to him voluntarily since then
(8 years ago).  I knew the woman (we all played cards together) but I
wouldn't say she was a friend. But her husband was actually a good
friend of The Asshole's.  He *did* feel guilty about that.

Yesterday's game in San Francisco was not exactly inspiring.  The
Braves lost.  Chipper Jones, Edgar Rentaria and Julio Franco didn't
play (except for Rentaria going in as a pinch hitter at the very end
to make the second to the last out and Chipper also as a pinch hitter
for the last out).  Bobby Cox (the manager) did not get into a snit
and get thrown out of the game as he so often is.  And, that damned
Barry Bonds did not have the gumption to hit a home run.  It was fun
anyway.
Sue - some year in Atlanta!!!
