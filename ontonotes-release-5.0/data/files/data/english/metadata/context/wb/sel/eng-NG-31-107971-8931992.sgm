Let's try this question in a separate thread away from the,
&quot;coins are smelly&quot; troll.

Seriously...

Why do you collect coins?  Why did you start?

My own recent interest in coins specifically, started from the
idea of silver (and gold) as a stable asset.  More reliable and
more private than fiat money represented as bits and bytes in a
bank's computer.

But, also, a more general issue.

I like money.

I like earning it, and having it, and spending it, and saving it.

But I also like studying it.  Reading about its history, its
behaviour, its cyclic nature, its different forms.  Trying to
understand the banking and credit industries (from today, alllll
the way back historically.)

So that leads to the now-defunct (but not very valuable) 2-cent
NZ coin I have here.  And the American Peace dollar, and the
stack of Mercury dimes.  Etc, etc.

Except for some small items (like that 2-cent coin), I am
inclined to stay with coins that have some intrinsic value (I.e.
actual silver or gold.)  Although the NZ Silver Dollar that I
recently bought was certainly more cost per ounce than some US
junk silver (which I also have.)

But I don't feel any desire to dis any other areas.  Some people
have the bucks to collect serious painting or sculpture.  Some
people like historic/cultural examples of lace, or quilting, or
rug weaving.  Some people like those ceramic thimbles.  Or those
tea spoons with the name of a town on them.  Or even &quot;Star Wars&quot;
figurines.  It's cool, as long as the people genuinely get a net
positive effect.  Different types of collectibles resonate in
different people.

And the contrast between coins and stamps?   There is my
inclination to have a floor on value.  A stamp's only assured
value is to mail a letter.  The only possible premium is
psychological.  You can't melt it down for industrial use.  Along
with durability hassles.  I live in a humid area that would
require more care and cost to protect gummed stamps, compared to
the low-to-average range of coins in which I am interested.

So, in a non-trolling way... Why do you like and collect coins?
As compared to some other type items?

Hehe.

This will forever get me branded as a heretic, but what the hey?  What you
read is what you get.

Like many of us, I kept a tin (can) of interesting coins collected from
change when I was a lad.  Nothing valuable, but some interesting (18th C.
English coppers, for instance)

My resurgence in collecting began when I, in my role as metalworker and
silversmith, needed a cheap source of sterling silver.  Flats and rounds
from the metal shops cost 3-4x melt price, but pre-1946 silver coins from
Australia were going for less than bullion value. Whacko!

That's where it started - a need to obtain silver for casting, rolling,
whatever.

The interest in coinage stemmed from there.  My primary interest remains the
coins of colonial Sydney - the so-called &quot;Proclamation&quot; coins.  I am now
just two coins shy of a complete set.

No hurry to complete it.

Parenthetically, I found (find) the history associated with the coinage
fascinating.  Never expected that, when I was shopping for bare metal.

I have a long-standing project on the back-burner: The metallugy of Roman
coins over a few centuries.  This will be backed up by photomicrographs of
the structure of a variety of many ancient coins.  That's one for
retirement, 'though.  Too busy now.

Great question.  For my husband and I: we were chosen to collect
coins.  hahaha

History: my husband's family are collectors.  So it would seem is my
family.  I think during the depression the habit of collecting started
among the lower classes in America.  Teapots and green glass and stuff
like that.  My grandmother collected anything that seemed to be
valuable - primarily glass beads, Venetian glass pieces, and the
like.  She filled a beautiful small cedar cabinet, crammed it to the
brim (my aunt grabbed it and the entire contents after my Grandma
died).  I inherited my grandmother's stamp collection, but it had gone
through some other family members hands and was butchered (envelopes
cut away from stamps, etc).  Plus I don't have the patience for
stamps.  They are too delicate, for one.  The old saliva factor
doesn't inspire me to dig in either.

My husband has always collected; sports cards primarily.  He financed
his college education selling cards he swore he'd replace someday but
are out of his reach now.  Like his dad, he collected coins, but
nothing serious...just filled some albums with pennies or whatever
kids filled back then.  He thinks the albums may still be in his room
back home (which makes me REALLY happy).

His dad is a collector of many many things, including coins.  He got a
bug in his butt and packed most of his coins in two boxes and shipped
them to my husband one day about three years ago.  My husband looked
them over, graded a few, I sold a few commemoratives on ebay and then
we decided to we didn't know what we were doing so we socked them
away, not really evaluating the collection as a whole.

I crashed my computer and lost the most recent list of the coins. So
being compulsively organized and out of curiosity, I decided to update
the list.  I systematically looked over the coins, catalogued them,
studied them, looked them up and completed a list.  And while I did
this, I really looked at them - I have never looked at coins in my
life before this. One by one.  And I'm still looking at them.  Right
now I'm obsessed with the Morgans and have some here now to study.  We
need 13 Morgans to complete the Morgan collection.  hahahha I know we
will never complete the Morgans, but there are some that are within
our grasp so we can conceivably take this pretty close to a remarkable
Morgan collection, possibly in mint or near mint condition.

They are exquisite coins, Morgans.  But then again we have this
perfect little 1860 dime.  It's absolutely like new, with luster and
clean and just something.  I can see why someone would fall in love
with dimes.  They're so perfect and tiny and delicate.  That one needs
to be graded.

So now I'm in love with coins. I don't know if we can afford to have
one of us in love with coins, but I'm making a case for it with my
husband. Its an investment but investing means selling and that could
be a heart breaker.  I'm reading Travers right now.  I need to sell
some to buy.  I need to sell some to grade some.  It's wild.  I'm
scared, I'm excited, I wish I were smarter, could read faster, had
better eyes and more resources. I don't want to fail my father in law,
my husband or these coins, which were systematically and lovingly put
together.  He gave us HIS collection and now they're our collection
and I want to improve it.  that's it in a nutshell.

I don't know why I started.  I rememeber when I was 11 or 12 a friend
found a Mercury dime in change and showed it to me.  A year later my
grandfather gave me a dozen Morgan dollars he had saved.  Seeing these
coins just struck a chord and I started collecting.  While I was doing
it I don't know that there was ever a reason, mostly curiosity about
coins I hadn't seen before and then later the hope that the coins
would appreciate in value.  That was the teenage years.

As an adult I collect because coins allow me to focus on history.
First, they are a tangible piece of times long gone.  One of the
easiest, most affordbale, and attractive ways to touch the past.  More
importantly each coin or set of coins opens a window into further
learning.  Why were these coins made, who made them, what were the
major events going on when the coisn were made.

I can honestly say that both nature and nurture played a role in my
coin collecting.

By nature, I mean Asperger's Syndrome, which has given me the tendancy
to
find intense satisfaction in the fine details of various hobbies and
interests: comic
books, Star Trek memorabilia, and, of course, coins.

By nurture, I mean my maternal grandmother, with whom I used to spend
hours
poring through stacks of Lincoln cents looking to fill holes in my
Whitman books.

Now, I have active collections of all circulating U.S. coins, and a
growing collection
of Morgans and Peace dollars.  In addition, I have a substantial
menagerie of foreign
coins, some acquired through my travels, some through the travel of
friends.  I have
entertained trades of casino tokens for silver quarters, rolls of
pre-1959 Lincoln cents
for pre-1965 half dollars, and the like.

When I was very young I was severely burned and spent many years in
and out of the hospital. For Chr For Christmas when I was 5, and in
the hospital, I was given a blank Whitman folder for &quot;Cents&quot; thaistmas
when I was 5, and in the hospital, I was given a blank Whitman folder
for &quot;Cents&quot; that I proceded to fill randomly, birth year coins for my
sisters, cousins etc. I still have that album BTW, after 53 years. It
occupied my time and became an obsession to fill in a 'real' album by
date and mintmark. Every day I would have a roll or two of 'pennies'
to go through, and I did a pretty good job, only missing about 10 or
12 coins (you know which ones!). I was later given higher denomination
folders which I also furiously tried to fill. I was permitted to go
through parents and grandparents pocket change, and allowed to keep
one coin of each date and mintmark that I was missing. ETHICS ALERT!!
Sometimes I would take a quarter or half dollar out of the album and
get another for my own use. I learned early on to keep only the best
quality coins I could find. I also thought it to be 'cheating' to buy
a coin, you HAD to get it from circulation. Of course, even with my
scheme, I was only a kid and didn't really have any money to buy a
coin.
In later years, as a teenager, I was allowed access to the 'family
coins', which were an assortment of obsolete design coins, and kept in
a canvas bag. I was again allowed to keep one of each date and
mintmark that I needed..but my ethics had improved by that time. I
broke down and bought a coin, an 1878-CC Morgan dollar. I HAD to have
a CC mintmark!
Two of my grandparents were active stamp collectors, and both tried to
get me interested in them, however, for some reason it never 'took'.
Oh, I enjoyed looking at them, but I never added 1 stamp to the
collections that were started for me. I ended up selling the stamps
about 20 years ago, and with no regrets. I can only wonder what
philatelic wonders I would have inheirited if I had shown any real
interest in them.
Now you know the dirty secret of an obsessed 8 year old coin collector!

I guess my interests started when I was about 7 or 8.  My father
decided to start filling a Whitman's Lincoln Cents Vol II.  After a
few months he had it almost completed (steelies were still somewhat
common in the late 50s and early 60s).  The 55-S was missing, as were
a few others, but it motivated him to get Vol I and start on those,
too.  I was somewhat intrigued and asked about getting a Jefferson
Nickels Vol I.  I had it about half filled when I reached puberty.
Then I joined the Navy.  I had collected (hoarded, actually) a few odd-
balls until 1975, when I discovered proof sets and got the special 3-
coin silver Bicentennial proofs.  I kept up with collecting from then
on.

Statehood quarters kind of kicked my butt into high-gear.  It wasn't
the quarters, per se, but finding out that you could talk about coins
with other collectors on a computer that really got me going.

I now collect SQs (like everyone else), proof sets, silver in any
denomination, occasional commems, Sacs (with special thanks to Jud)and
anything else that strikes my fancy.  I'm helping my son with his
Kennedy halves and others with collecting Prexibux.  If I can't afford
it, it doesn't matter; I can enjoy Stellas from the images on
Heritage.

I was given a tin of assorted foreign coins when I was about 10 years old,
non UK for me, and that kind of sparked an interest, the tin is probably
worth more than the coins and I still have both.

The UK changing to decimal coins in 1971 rekindled my interest in coins and
I bought my first one in 1968 for 30 bob, a 1953 coronation crown, I still
have it, I started buying coin magazines at that time.

I switched to Scottish banknotes in 1987 when I bought 3 at the York Coin
Fair.

I still buy the occasional coin.  Billy

Like many here, I started collecting coins as a child because I was
given some as a relative.  I think the first exposure was a little kit
I got for a birthday- it had folders for Lincoln cents and Jefferson
nickels, a book on coin collecting, and a small magnifier.  I must
have been about six years old then, c. 1978.  I started checking
change for dates and mintmarks and  received gifts of coins for
birthdays and Christmas.  My paternal grandfather did a bit of coin
collecting himself and would let me go through his accumulation of
wheat cents and pick out dates and mints I needed.  When he passed
away some years later his collection got sold off, but I did receive
two small bits of it- a holed large cent that I wear on my keychain,
and some empty older Whitman coin folders.  The Franklin folder has
the dates and mints from 1957 on hand-written by my grandfather- the
folder is older and was printed during the run of the Franklin series,
with unlabeled spaces for future issues!  I have since filled up the
Franklin folder with a complete circulated set, and I will never
upgrade to a fancier folder- the fact that my grandfather used it and
wrote in it makes it priceless to me.

At the time, I was collecting both US coins and world coins- mainly
leftover pocket change that friends of my parents brought back from
vacations, supplemented by occasional purchases from local coin
shops.  But I temporarily lost interest around the age of 12 or so,
and mostly forgot about coins.  This lasted until I started college
and found a coin store located close to campus.  I had little money,
but bought the occasional older foreign coin, whatever seemed
interesting.  Then they got in some late Roman bronze coins- this was
the early 90s, when large amounts of late Roman bronze started to come
out of Eastern Europe.  At $3 each, they were too tempting to pass up.
The college library didn't have a lot of reference material on coins,
but I managed to identify most of my purchases well enough until I
bought Sear's Roman book (just a single-volume edition then).  My
interest has been pretty steady since then, and now my main collecting
areas are Parthian and Roman coins, with a side project I am starting
up on Civil War tokens (I am finally getting the book and joining
CWTS, thanks to Jud.)

So, why do I collect coins?   For me, it is mostly about how coins are
tangible bits of places distant in time and/or space.  As a child, I
enjoyed the foreign coins and imagining what the lands that produced
them must be like.  With ancient coins, they are, to borrow a phrase,
&quot;history in your hands&quot;.  I enjoy reading about great figures in
history, and then holding a coin struck in their name, bearing their
portrait and proud titles.  When I saw the arch of Septimius Severus
in Rome, I  was struck by how the Parthian captives shown in the
reliefs resembled the prisoners shown on coins also issued by
Severus.  I can't have a huge marble arch in my living room (nor
should I, it belongs where it is on public display), but I can and do
have the comtemporaneous coins with similar images.  Similarly, with a
coin issued by Julius Caesar commemorating his victories in Gaul, or a
coin issued by Marc Antony to pay his legions- they are tangible bits
of the past, and in reasonable condition are within the means of most
collectors.  The flow of inspiration sometimes flows the other way,
too- a coin can make me look up a person, place or event depicted and
want to know more about the coin's reason for existence.  So my
interest in coins now is mainly historical, though I do make the
occasional exception.  I just bought a coin of the Comoros which
depicts a coelacanth, because I think it's an interesting fish, and it
sort of ties in with my interest in fossils.(But that's another story,
for another post...)

I started because I got something different in change from what I normally
received. US winged liberty dimes to be specific.  I guess at nine or so I
thought coins were universally the same since cavemen got what they wanted
by bonking others on the head with a club and taking it. And I wondered who
the heck ever had wings on the side of his head anyway.  That difference
sparked a curiosity plain and simple.  I have been exploring with that
curiosity every since.

Today, I collect stuff that still sparks that curiosity and not just coins.
So for me it is a spring-board into another time, another place, another
culture, another way of thinking, another way of doing things and that to me
is exciting, it gets me motivated to do......something, anything to feed
that desire to go and know about elsewhere.

Well I can't afford to go look....so I collect coins, books and information.
Not as good as being there, experiencing it first hand but as close as I can
get.

Coins are &quot;real&quot;.  Money can be a bill or a coin, but
the difference between a $20 bill and a double eagle
is the difference between pretend and reality.  Even
a #20 gold certificate is no but a piece of paper,
like a stamp.  But the coin!  REAL!

When I first started collecting, I wanted to put together a type

best coins I could afford.  Then I remember seeing a coin display
at the CNE.  It was a type set like I was putting together.  I
was impressed and disappointed.  My collection had already been
assembled, and better than I ever could have.

Since then, my motivation is to have a unique collection.  I
started collecting Royal Canadian Mint sets cutomized for
corporations and events (yeah, I know, collect the coin, not the
packaging - but to me, this is just a hobby) and Canadian
numismatic literature.

I guess part of it is the feeling that I'm preserving something
for future collectors. There are enough decimal coins and Bank of
Canada notes in collections today for that.

See ya ...

&gt;&gt; As compared to some other type items?

Customised sets is an interesting area, I watch for English £1 notes on ebay
that are in promotional packaging, most commonly Scotch Tape and Raffles
cigarettes.

I also watch out for Scottish £1 notes in the original &quot;Banknotes Of All
Nations&quot; envelopes.  Billy
