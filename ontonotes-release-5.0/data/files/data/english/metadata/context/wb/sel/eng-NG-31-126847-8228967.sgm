In front of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, N.Y., are
two busts on pedestals, one of Winston Churchill and the other of
Roosevelt. Carved into the marble beneath Roosevelt are three words:
&quot;The war president.&quot;

We are not encouraged to think of Roosevelt these days as a &quot;war
president&quot; - the moving FDR Memorial in Washington little mentions his
role as commander in chief of 12 million men, though it does quote his
prewar statement, &quot;I hate war,&quot; the sincerity of which I do not doubt
for a minute.

Roosevelt's radio broadcast on D-Day was, in its entirety, a prayer.
(Think of the uproar if the current incumbent did that) It was a
prayer for the hundreds of thousands of men he had ordered into
battle, thousands of whom he knew would die or be grievously wounded.
You can see in those wartime photographs how Roosevelt aged, how his
health was destroyed by the weight of the responsibilities he bore, a
weight the rest of us have a hard time imagining.

I was reminded of this last Friday when, in the Roosevelt Room of the
White House, I was one of nine opinion journalists interviewing George
W. Bush. He acknowledged that the conflict in Iraq is an unpopular war
and said he cannot make decisions about Iraq and have parents of the
men and women who volunteered to serve &quot;think I'm making decisions
based on the Gallup poll.&quot;
Then, with some fervor, he said, &quot;You don't know what it's like to be
commander in chief until you are one.&quot;

Mr. Bush, too, has visibly aged in his White House years, surely more
than he would have if his duties were limited to clearing brush in
Crawford, Texas.

The current debate about what we should do in Iraq is intellectually
far from satisfying. The surge of troops ordered by Mr. Bush last
January and completed June 15 and the new strategy of forward action
against al Qaeda forces has produced or accelerated encouraging
developments: the rout of al Qaeda in Anbar Province, which it seemed
to control six months ago; similar developments in Diyala Province
north of Baghdad; and a sharp decrease in sectarian violence in
Baghdad and elsewhere. Yet majorities in the House and Senate seem to
want to call the whole thing off, with not much care for the
consequences.

The New York Times, arguing for a pullout, admits the result may very
well be genocide. That is seen as somehow preferable to continuing a
conflict that has produced U.S. casualties of the magnitude of those
suffered in the first 24 hours after U.S. forces landed in Normandy.

Much of the domestic political debate, I think, revolves less about
what is happening or will happen in Iraq than about what kind of
nation we are. I want it to be my country again - that was one of the
themes of Howard Dean's campaign in the early days of our military
involvement in Iraq, and it is one of the themes, as best I can tell,
of candidates who call for a pullout from Iraq.

My country, this line of thought seems to go, is not a country that
tries to accomplish things by force or violence; my country is a
country willing to negotiate, that respects the feelings of those in
other countries, that tolerates differences of opinions among the
peoples of the world, that does not seek to dominate them or to impose
our own morality. After all, who is to say we're better than anyone
else?

All of which is fine, up to a point. Mr. Bush has said that he didn't
take office wanting to be a war president, and Franklin Roosevelt
certainly didn't, either. Nor did Harry Truman, though he was faced
soon with deciding whether to drop the atomic bomb and, five years
later, deciding whether to respond to the communist invasion of South
Korea.

Mr. Bush is surely correct in supposing that the Islamist terrorists
we are fighting in Iraq want to do grievous damage to us and that
their ability to do so will be increased if we leave Iraq in failure.
A Middle East in shambles is scarcely in our interest. Mr. Bush and
Gen. David Petraeus may or may not have come up with a winning
strategy and tactics. But the results in Anbar show that the twists
and turns of war can be unexpectedly good as well as unexpectedly bad.
Wouldn't it be better to see if the surge produces success than to
pull the plug now?

I think the American people have the stomach for the fight, what they
don't have the stomach for is idiocy, lunacy and incompetence. What
Bush, Cheney, and their fellow neo-facists perpetrated this war for is
oil, but grossly miscalculated what it takes to occupy and control a
foreign country, especially a ME country, never mind the morality of
such actions.
The supposed &quot;War on Terror&quot; is just a propaganda tool to get the
American people to go along with the idea, which more and more
Americans are realizing on a daily basis. The 36% who favor
impeachment is the lowest poll, many tend to be in the 45% range, a
good twenty points higher than ever favored Clinton being impeached.
We'll drum these criminals out of office in the shame they deserve,
even if it takes until January 2008.

War for oil?

Oil for whom?

George Bush storing Iraqi oil in huge undergound tanks on his
Crawford, TX ranch?

Oil for YOU to drive your car and/or heat your house?

Actually,  Oil is the primary source of income for Iraq - representing
90% of Iraq's income..

If we wanted oil, we would invade Canada, Mexcio or Venezuela.  It is
much  easier to get oil here in the America's than to ship iy half way
around the world.

We can pipe the oil in from Mexico and/or Canada and cause NO Global
Warming with all those tankers in the ocean.
