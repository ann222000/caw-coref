I've forgotten what you call them LCD??. I only do a small amount but
down at the local hardware store they have one @ $99 and one @$199. The
latter has a harder helmet and looks better quality all round.. the
electroniccs could be of equal quality however??
Thanks
John

Hey Underpants,

Go to eBay. There selection and prices are better.

Here is one I bought not long ago, and it is working great!

This is a difficult subject.  Many here swear by their cheap helmets.
Others swear at them.

If one is a professional, and it HAS to work all day every day, they can
afford the $300 for a good one.  For the hobbyist that uses it one half hour
every few months, the cheaper ones may last just as long.

Your question is very difficult to ask because it is impossible to know how
much you are going to use it, how hard you are on equipment, what the work
environment is (will it be laid on a table when not in use, or in a place
where it can get banged around).

For me, it came down to these things:  I had the money to buy a good one.  I
value my eyesight.  I like buying quality safety equipment and quality
essential tools.  I wanted something that I wouldn't be replacing very soon.
( I had to replace my first one after just a few months due to theft.
grrrr)  I wanted something that would stand up to heavy use.

You may use those criteria to decide for yourself, but remember this:  It
isn't a bargain if you're going to be back down to the store buying another
one soon.

HTH.  BTW, mine is a NexGen EQC, and other than it is a little on the heavy
side, I love it.

and some of us swear by non-auto helmets.

I don't like auto darkening helmets, it seems to me that they darken
too late. I like my cheap $9.95 heltmet. If i drop it, I spend $0.99
to replace the #11 lens.

I bought a cheap one $99NZ. I do detect a flash before it darkens. I
wondered if it was just the side flash(?). I tried adjusting the
darkness, the highest level made it easier to see but was a little hard
on my eyes.. Actually it was overcast outside, maybe that was partly the
issue. I might find a professional welder and ask them to test it.
Thanks

I've got an old saw bench. I wondered if I could get the right blade to
fit and clamped some pipe (for example, it would give an even cut.
