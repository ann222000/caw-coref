Dear everyone,

Many happy returns of Janmashtami, birth of lork krishna.

May the spirit and teachings of Lord Krishna imbibe in us. May he get born
today in our heart.
May we carry him from the prison of mind to vrindavan of heart inspite of
all difficultis and hurdles.
Surely, he will win and kill kamsa of lust(desire) and enchant us with his
flute. Then, he will reign all alone
in our hearts and fill it with bliss. When rain of illusion comes, he will
even lift mountain to protect us.
He will kill all evil tendencies, once just once if he gets birth in our
hearts.
Let us strive hard and show him that we love one else than him.

May equanimity and devotion become our legs, duty and discrimination becomes
our hands.
May meditation comes to our all senses including mind.

May we love thee truly from heart.

Let us pray and celebrate...

&quot;The supreme prayer contains full heart and no words, a mundane prayer
contain full words and no heart&quot;.

-Mahatama Gandhi
yours...
