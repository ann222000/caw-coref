DNI Turns to Private Sector to Adapt 2.0 Web Technology
http://www.intelligenceonline.com/detail/detail_articles/p_detail.asp...

Seeking for some years to develop collaborative tools for intelligence
analysts, the DNI is turning to the private sector to come up with
solutions.

The *Director of National Intelligence * , *Mike McConnell * , presented
his latest on-line collaborative tools ( * A-Space * , *Intellipedia *
, *Library
of National Intelligence * , see graph below) to representatives of the
private sector during the *Analytic Transformation* conference held in
Chicago between Sept. 4-6. For the occasion, McConnell even invited managers
of the *MySpace* and *FaceBook* social networking platforms, from which
A-Space is directly derived, to attend the conclave.

The DNI had the *Intelligence and National Security Alliance* (INSA, see IOL
546) organize the conference. McConnell himself used to direct INSA which
brings together the intelligence community's leading sub-contractors ( *SAIC
* , *SRA * , *CACI * , *Booz Allen Hamilton * , etc). INSA works with the
DNI to create an *Intelligence Advanced Research Project Activity* (IARPA)
through its innovative technologies working group.

Several private firms already work on the new intelligence-sharing tools,
and notably *Jasmah Consulting * , which advises *Mike Wertheimer * ,
assistant deputy director for analysis transformation and technology in the
DNI's analysis directorate; and *Tacit Software * , financed by
*In-Q-Tel*and which works on A-Space's collaborative component. A
first version of
A-Space will be up and running in December.

By the end of 2008 it will give intelligence analysts access, through a
single portal, to collaborative tools (instant messaging, research and
networking with experts) as well to an inter-active Intellipedia
encyclopaedia and data bases of a future Library of National Intelligence.

Consumer Innovations to Inform Web Site for Spies

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/24/AR200...

Government agents may soon find valuable information through an
online-recommendation system like the one on
Amazon.com&lt; http://financial.washingtonpost.com/custom/wpost/html-qcn.asp?dispnav... &gt;:
Spies who read this report, it might say, also found these reports useful.

That is one of several features the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Office+of+the+Directo... &gt;might
borrow from mainstream technology as it designs its new Web-based
information-sharing system.
The DNI is working on a new system intended to &quot;tunnel through&quot; the 16
different intelligence-gathering agencies in hopes of streamlining data
sharing, said Michael Wertheimer, DNI's assistant deputy director for
analytic transformation and technology.

The system, called A-Space, will only be open to those cleared to use it and
is scheduled to go live in December. The DNI said it was taking its cues
from social networking sites, Web-based mail, online maps and other commonly
used online tools. Next month, it will take its concepts to a conference in
Chicago&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Chicago?tid=informline &gt;,
where universities, tech companies and other government agencies will be
invited to scrutinize the project.

&quot;This is a revolutionary concept for us,&quot; Wertheimer said. &quot;This is unlike
any other technology we've created.&quot;

This is not the government's first attempt to imitate consumer technology.
Last year, inspired by the popular user-generated encyclopedia
Wikipedia&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Wikimedia+Foundation+... &gt;,
the government launched Intellipedia, an internal site aimed at information
exchange in the intelligence community.

A-Space, which will cost about $5 million to design, will operate like a
password-protected corporate intranet, where companies post important
documents, after-hours contact information or special skills of certain
employees. Moving such information online would allow employees to access it
from anywhere they can find a Internet-connected computer, whether that's at
home or at a coffee shop -- similar to the way someone might access their
free Yahoo&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Yahoo%21+Inc.?tid=inf... &gt;,
Hotmail&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/MSN+Hotmail?tid=infor... &gt;or
Gmail&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Google+Gmail?tid=info... &gt;account.
The Financial
Times&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Financial+Times+Ltd.?... &gt;reported
this week that the government was working on this project.

The government acknowledged that there are legitimate concerns about such an
undertaking, including the risk of hackers and other security breaches, but
Wertheimer said the DNI is soliciting input on those problems.

&quot;Obviously, security is a huge concern, and it's a valid concern that has to
be addressed,&quot; said Teresa Smetzer, chief executive of Jasmah Consulting, an
intelligence consulting firm in
Reston&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Reston?tid=informline &gt;.
&quot;It's very important, but there are ways to constructively address those
challenges.&quot;

Smetzer, who said she worked as a Central Intelligence
Agency&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Central+Intelligence+... &gt;analyst
for 17 years and is scheduled to be a panelist at the Chicago event,
said in designing A-Space, the government is trying to become more efficient
and responsive, just as businesses use technology to adapt quickly to
changing trends.

&quot;There's a huge amount of expertise distributed across a lot of agencies and
locations,&quot; she said. &quot;How do you quickly find people and pull them into a
collaborative environment so they can work on projects?&quot;

Traditional information-sharing involved a lot of phone calls to find
expertise in a specific field, she said. Now businesses are increasingly
using networking tools such as
LinkedIn&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/LinkedIn+Corporation?... &gt;and
Facebook&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Facebook+Inc.?tid=inf... &gt;to
identify those people with the click of a mouse.

One feature of the proposed government system will include a Web-based
library that can sift through similar reports and use a recommendation
system similar to those of Amazon,
iTunes&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Apple+iTunes?tid=info... &gt;and
other e-commerce sites, Wertheimer said.

Its system will also include tools to limit access according to users'
security clearance, similar to the way
MySpace&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/MySpace+Inc.?tid=info... &gt;uses
privacy settings so users can choose who sees their profiles, he said.
A-Space could also include programs that combine Google
Maps&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Google+Maps?tid=infor... &gt;with
government data so intelligence agencies can chart, for example, the
location of nuclear power plants or regions with recent epidemic outbreaks,
he said.

The government could draw a number of other features from the technology
community.

&quot;Some of your best technology ideas are not going to be found in government
labs or be on an intelligence community Listserv,&quot; said Jason Kello,
spokesman for the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, a nonprofit,
public-private intelligence group in
Arlington&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Arlington?tid=informline &gt;that
is sponsoring the conference.

&lt; http://www.latimes.com/business/ &gt; Classified social-networking system
promises to help U.S. spies talk, collaborate
http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spybook6sep06,1,4754284.story?c...
By Ashley M. Heher, The Associated Press
September 6, 2007
CHICAGO -- As spy gear goes, a social-networking Web site doesn't quite
have the same cachet as some of James Bond's high-tech gadgets.

But the U.S. intelligence community is taking a page from popular online
hangouts like Facebook and News Corp.'s MySpace to help encourage operatives
to share information. In December, agency leaders are launching a
social-networking site just for spooks.

The classified &quot;A-Space&quot; ultimately will grow to include blogs, searchable
databases, libraries of reports, collaborative word processing and other
tools to help analysts quickly trade, update and edit information.

It comes on the heels of the year-old Intellipedia, a Web site modeled after
the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Intellipedia has been gaining
traction among the intelligence agencies and already has nearly 30,000
posted articles and 4,800 edits added every workday.

Although A-Space will be built with commercially available software,
organizers are quick to dismiss any criticism about security, saying all
sensitive data will be stored behind a thicket of classified safeguards that
they are developing themselves.

The social-networking efforts, led by the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, are emerging as the nation's intelligence community comes
under renewed criticism for a lack of cooperation and communication --
something a new internal CIA report said contributed to the information
breakdown before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Aside from simply being able to share documents back and forth, experts who
are in the same field but work for different agencies could meet each other
virtually and swap ideas and information directly. Experts say the current
procedures for sharing information is so cumbersome that such communication
is now impossible.

&quot;It's just a better way to build and grow that network so that improved
analysis can come out the other end,&quot; said Robert Cardillo, deputy director
of analysis for the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Organizers acknowledge it may be difficult to erase generations of
territorial tendencies and prevent spats among the country's 16 intelligence
agencies, which often want credit for their own discoveries.

But they hope the influx of younger operatives -- half the intelligence
analysts employed by the U.S. government have been on the job for no more
than five years -- will help shelve old feuds and embrace Web tools already
in widespread use.

&quot;It's a way to build the social network for all analysts,&quot; said Mike
Wertheimer, assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analytic
transformation and technology, who is leading the initiative. &quot;We put more
eyes on more problems.&quot;

Development of the $5-million project began in June, and a pilot version
will be available in December, with features to be added over the next year.
Ultimately, the system may grow to include an unclassified network for use
by state and local law enforcement and even some foreign agencies.

Classified information will only be available to individuals with the right
security clearance and site minders will work to sniff out inappropriate
use, much the way credit card companies look for fraudulent charges.

For example, A-Space will be designed to detect if an expert in Southeast
Asian militaries is running inappropriate queries on Latin American drug
cartels.

&quot;We're hoping that people will give us the benefit of the doubt,&quot; Wertheimer
said.

But three months before A-Space is to go live, there's ample skepticism.

Richard L. Russell, a former CIA analyst who teaches at the National Defense
University, says the government needs to focus on building better analysis
and human intelligence, not fancy tools.

&quot;You may have a great technological infrastructure for managing information,
but if you put garbage into it, the output will be garbage,&quot; he said.

Others said the initiative is a giant leap for the three-letter agencies
that find themselves stumbling to share information through bureaucratic
channels and cumbersome firewalls.

&quot;A site that's open to all 16 intelligence agencies, that allows them to
chat more freely, I think is a darn good idea and may help them get around
some of these issues,&quot; said Donald C. Daniel, a security studies professor
at Georgetown University. &quot;But it may be hit or miss.&quot;

Experts say the service will only be as effective as those who use it. And
with many older workers puzzled by their younger colleagues' obsessive use
of Facebook and its ilk, full-blown use could take time.

Mark Lowenthal, president of the Intelligence &amp; Security Academy and the
government's former assistant director of central intelligence for analysis
and production, admits he's baffled by social-networking sites and isn't
sure if A-Space is the ultimate solution to fixing problems in the agencies.

But he believes the proposal has merit, especially as baby boomers retire
and are replaced by younger analysts.

&quot;Clearly, we don't always behave like a community so anything you can do to
help foster that to a degree is a good thing,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to do
better. Anybody who's dealt with adapting technology to the intelligence
community will tell you that the intelligence community has not been
brilliant in catching up.&quot;
Harnessing the Internet to reinvent democracy

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/11/AR200...

BERLIN (Reuters) - No one could accuse management guru Don Tapscott of
being unambitious. The co-author of best-seller &quot;Wikinomics&quot; wants to teach
governments to harness the power of the Internet to reinvent democracy.

Tapscott is an evangelist for Web 2.0, the second-generation Internet based
on participation through social communities such as Facebook (GOOG.O) and
MySpace (NWSa.N), participatory sites like free encyclopedia Wikipedia, and
blogs.
In &quot;Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything,&quot; published this
year, he and co-author Anthony Williams dared big companies to reveal their
trade secrets on the Web in a gamble to collect the ideas they need from
people outside the firm.

They cited unlikely success stories such as that of struggling gold miner
Goldcorp&lt; http://financial.washingtonpost.com/custom/wpost/html-qcn.asp?dispnav... &gt;(
G.TO) which published its secret geological data on the Web and invited
people around the world to help it find new goldfields -- a move that
transformed the company.

Now their thinktank, New Paradigm, is starting a project to involve
governments, non-governmental organizations and citizens around the world to
revitalize the public sector.

&quot;I want to change the world,&quot; said Tapscott, grinning, when asked what he
thinks his initiative can achieve.

Tapscott, who is in the middle of a multi-million-dollar international
project to research the attitudes and habits of 13 to 29-year-olds, reckons
young people want to take part in politics but don't like being preached to
by politicians.

&quot;My generation grew up watching TV so a broadcast model was OK,&quot; he says.
But hearing: &quot;I'm a politician, so listen to this 30-second ad where I slag
off my competition,&quot; is meaningless to what he dubs the &quot;N-Gen&quot; or Net
generation, Tapscott argues.

Tapscott's ideas are based on the premise that the new generation of
&quot;digital natives&quot; who grew up with the Internet is fundamentally different
from previous generations -- in a way that matters.

&quot;This is the first time in history that kids are an authority on something
important,&quot; he said in an interview on the fringes of a Web 2.0 conference
in Berlin. &quot;When I was a kid I was an authority on model trains.&quot;

New Paradigm plans to kick off its Government 2.0 project with a three-day
Web discussion in Tapscott's native Canada early next year, hosted by the
Governor-General and probably on the topic of global warming.

A working paper on the project says: &quot;With 85 percent of university students
on Facebook and MySpace growing at 300,000 new registrants per day, new
venues for online collaboration and social networking are a phenomenon that
no politician or public official can afford to ignore.&quot;

Tapscott says: &quot;When I was 19, I had six friends, and I was a pretty popular
guy. My daughter has 6,000.&quot;

The New Paradigm Government 2.0 project has &quot;a few governments&quot; on board so
far, but none officially in Europe, Tapscott says.

Other partners include former U.S. president Bill Clinton's Clinton Global
Initiative, and Tapscott says he is talking to the United Nations about
getting involved in the project.

New Paradigm actually attempted a similar project eight years ago, but the
time wasn't right, Tapscott said, without the filtering tools that are
available today that make the difference between conversation and babble.

Asked whether he believes such an initiative could bring democracy to
countries who don't currently have it, he says only: &quot;We're talking to some
countries who don't have elections about this project.&quot;

But his ambitions don't stretch to reinventing representative government.
&quot;We're not talking about nightly electronic voting or something like that --
a.k.a. the electronic mob,&quot; he said.
Washington Post: Fine Print
Contractors in Iraq Have Become U.S. Crutch

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR200...
By Walter Pincus
Monday, August 20, 2007; Page A13

When years from now historians and government officials reexamine
precedents set by the U.S. experience in
Iraq&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Iraq?tid=informline &gt;,
many &quot;firsts&quot; are likely to pop up.

One still playing out is the extraordinarily wide use of private
contractors. A Congressional Research
Service&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Congressional+Re... &gt;report
published last month titled &quot;Private Security Contractors in Iraq:
Background, Legal Status, and Other Issues,&quot; puts it this way: &quot;Iraq appears
to be the first case where the U.S. government has used private contractors
extensively for protecting persons and property in potentially hostile or
hostile situations where host country security forces are absent or
deficient.&quot;
Only estimates are available for the total employment by contractors in Iraq
that perform &quot;functions once carried by the U.S.
military&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Armed+Forces?tid... &gt;,&quot;
according to the study. Testimony at an April 2007 congressional hearing
gave the impressive figure of 127,000 as the number working in Iraq under
Defense Department contracts. Breakdowns don't exist, but one Pentagon
official said less than 20 percent were American.

CIA&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Central+Intelligence+... &gt;and
the
Pentagon&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+Pentagon?tid=info... &gt;intelligence
agencies have hired contractors in Iraq, but the tasks and the
funds involved are secret.

Surge or no surge, the work that contractors do there remains highly
dangerous. The study reports that private contractors risk death and injury
handling security for convoys that carry gasoline, oil and all sorts of
supplies and equipment into and around Iraq.

It quotes U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Army+Corps+of+En... &gt;data
that show &quot;an increasing proportion of registered supply convoys has
been attacked.&quot; In the first 18 weeks of 2007, 14.7 percent of the convoys
were struck, according to the data, while only 5.5 percent were hit in 2005.
Earlier this month, Rep. Jan
Schakowsky&lt; http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/s001145/ &gt;(D-Ill.)
reported that Labor Department figures show 1,001 civilian
contractors had died in Iraq as of June 30, 2007.

While U.S. contractors have provided personal security to officials in other
conflict zones, those in Iraq are now being used in all aspects of the
struggle because, as the CRS report says, doing otherwise would require
policymakers &quot;to contemplate an increase in the number of U.S. troops,
perhaps increasing incentives to attract volunteers or re-instituting the
draft.&quot;

But the expanded contractor use has evoked new attention to a 1995 criticism
of the practice. According to the study, a Defense Department Commission on
Roles and Missions found then that depending on contractors was detrimental
and that it kept the Pentagon &quot;from building and maintaining capacity needed
for strategic or other important missions.&quot;

An advertisement last week on IntelligenceCareers.com illustrates part of
the problem. It seeks an &quot;Intelligence Analyst&quot; to work in Iraq for a
Dayton&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Dayton?tid=informline &gt;,
Ohio &lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Ohio?tid=informline &gt;-based
outfit called MacAulay-Brown, or MacB, which in turn is a subcontractor to
the giant Lockheed
Martin&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Lockheed+Martin+Corpo... &gt;information
technology group. The
client is Counterintelligence Field Activity, the Defense
Department&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Department+of+De... &gt;'s
newest intelligence arm, which is responsible for coordinating force
protection for the military services inside the United States and abroad.

The capabilities required for the job include &quot;CI Analysis, related
Intelligence Analysis experience, or similar CI/Intelligence community
experience.&quot; The employee, the ad says, would work in
Baghdad&lt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Baghdad?tid=informline &gt;supporting
CIFA's participation in the Strategic Intelligence Directorate to
counter foreign intelligence and terrorist activities. That directorate,
which includes members of Navy, Air Force and Army security units, will
&quot;recruit informants, investigate terrorist attacks, process evidence from
raids, and interrogate detainees,&quot; according to the ad.

MacB analysts also support other major U.S. military outfits in Iraq, the ad
says, analyzing captured documents and supporting counterinsurgency and
counterterrorism operations while using &quot;our extensive understanding of
Iraqi former regime forces, current government elements, and insurgent and
terrorist factions affecting the present security situation into
intelligence products for national-level special projects.&quot;

MacB is needed now because the military did not foresee the need to do this
work itself 12 years ago.

When Matthew Burton arrived at the Defense Intelligence
Agency&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/d... &gt;in
January 2003, he was excited about getting to his computer. Burton,
who
was then 22, had long been interested in international relations: he had
studied Russian politics and interned at the U.S. consulate in Ukraine,
helping to speed refugee applications of politically persecuted Ukrainians.
But he was also a big high-tech geek fluent in Web-page engineering, and he
spent hours every day chatting online with friends and updating his own
blog. When he was hired by the D.I.A., he told me recently, his mind boggled
at the futuristic, secret spy technology he would get to play with: search
engines that can read minds, he figured. Desktop video conferencing with
colleagues around the world. If the everyday Internet was so awesome, just
imagine how much better the spy tools would be.

But when he got to his cubicle, his high-tech dreams collapsed. &quot;The
reality,&quot; he later wrote ruefully, &quot;was a colossal letdown.&quot;

The spy agencies were saddled with technology that might have seemed cutting
edge in 1995. When he went onto Intelink — the spy agencies' secure internal
computer network — the search engines were a pale shadow of Google, flooding
him with thousands of useless results. If Burton wanted to find an expert to
answer a question, the personnel directories were of no help. Worse, instant
messaging with colleagues, his favorite way to hack out a problem, was
impossible: every three-letter agency — from the Central Intelligence
Agency&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/c... &gt;to
the National
Security Agency&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/n... &gt;to
army commands — used different discussion groups and chat applications
that couldn't connect to one another. In a community of secret agents
supposedly devoted to quickly amassing information, nobody had even a simple
blog — that ubiquitous tool for broadly distributing your thoughts.

Something had gone horribly awry, Burton realized. Theoretically, the
intelligence world ought to revolve around information sharing. If
F.B.I.&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/f... &gt;agents
discover that Al
Qaeda&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/a... &gt;fund-raising
is going on in Brooklyn,
C.I.A. agents in Europe ought to be able to know that instantly. The
Internet flourished under the credo that information wants to be free; the
agencies, however, had created their online networks specifically to keep
secrets safe, locked away so only a few could see them. This control over
the flow of information, as the 9/11 Commission noted in its final report,
was a crucial reason American intelligence agencies failed to prevent those
attacks. All the clues were there — Al Qaeda associates studying aviation in
Arizona, the flight student Zacarias
Moussaoui&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/zacarias... &gt;arrested
in Minnesota, surveillance of a Qaeda plotting session in Malaysia
— but none of the agents knew about the existence of the other evidence. The
report concluded that the agencies failed to &quot;connect the dots.&quot;

By way of contrast, every night when Burton went home, he was reminded of
how good the everyday Internet had become at connecting dots. &quot;Web
2.0&quot;technologies that encourage people to share information — blogs,
photo-posting sites like Flickr or the reader-generated encyclopedia
Wikipedia — often made it easier to collaborate with others. When the Orange
Revolution erupted in Ukraine in late 2004, Burton went to Technorati, a
search engine that scours the &quot;blogosphere,&quot; to find the most authoritative
blog postings on the subject. Within minutes, he had found sites with
insightful commentary from American expatriates who were talking to locals
in Kiev and on-the-fly debates among political analysts over what it meant.
Because he and his fellow spies were stuck with outdated technology, they
had no comparable way to cooperate — to find colleagues with common
interests and brainstorm online.

Burton, who has since left the D.I.A., is not alone in his concern. Indeed,
throughout the intelligence community, spies are beginning to wonder why
their technology has fallen so far behind — and talk among themselves about
how to catch up. Some of the country's most senior intelligence thinkers
have joined the discussion, and surprisingly, many of them believe the
answer may lie in the interactive tools the world's teenagers are using to
pass around YouTube videos and bicker online about their favorite bands.
Billions of dollars' worth of ultrasecret data networks couldn't help spies
piece together the clues to the worst terrorist plot ever. So perhaps, they
argue, it' s time to try something radically different. Could blogs and
wikis prevent the next 9/11?

The job of an analyst used to be much more stable — even sedate. In the '70s
and '80s, during the cold war, an intelligence analyst would show up for
work at the C.I.A.'s headquarters in Langley, Va., or at the National
Security Agency compound in Fort Meade, Md., and face a mess of paper. All
day long, tips, memos and reports from field agents would arrive: cables
from a covert-ops spy in Moscow describing a secret Soviet meeting, or
perhaps fresh pictures of a missile silo. An analyst's job was to take these
raw pieces of intelligence and find patterns in the noise. In a crisis, his
superiors might need a quick explanation of current events to pass on to
their agency heads or to Congress. But mostly he was expected to perform
long-term &quot;strategic analysis&quot; — to detect entirely new threats that were
still forming.

And during the cold war, threats formed slowly. The Soviet Union was a
ponderous bureaucracy that moved at the glacial speed of the five-year plan.
Analysts studied the emergence of new tanks and missiles, pieces of hardware
that took years to develop. One year, an analyst might report that the keel
for a Soviet nuclear submarine had been laid; a few years later, a follow-up
report would describe the submarine's completion; even more years later, a
final report would detail the sea trials. Writing reports was thus a
leisurely affair, taking weeks or months; thousands of copies were printed
up and distributed via interoffice mail. If an analyst's report impressed
his superiors, they'd pass it on to their superiors, and they to theirs —
until, if the analyst was very lucky, it landed eventually in the
president's inner circle. But this sort of career achievement was rare. Of
the thousands of analyst reports produced each year, the majority sat
quietly gathering dust on agency shelves, unread by anyone.

Analysts also did not worry about anything other than their corners of the
world. Russia experts focused on Russia, Nicaragua ones on Nicaragua. Even
after the cold war ended, the major spy agencies divided up the world: the
F.B.I. analyzed domestic crime, the C.I.A. collected intelligence
internationally and military spy agencies, like the National Security Agency
and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, evaluated threats to the
national defense. If an analyst requested information from another agency,
that request traveled through elaborate formal channels. The walls between
the agencies were partly a matter of law. The charters of the C.I.A. and the
defense intelligence agencies prohibited them from spying on American
citizens, under the logic that the intrusive tactics needed to investigate
foreign threats would violate constitutional rights if applied at home. The
F.B.I. even had an internal separation: agents investigating terrorist
activity would not share information with those investigating crimes,
worried that secrets gleaned from tailing Al Qaeda operatives might wind up
publicly exposed in a criminal trial.

Then on Sept. 12, 2001, analysts showed up at their desks and faced a
radically altered job. Islamist terrorists, as 9/11 proved, behaved utterly
unlike the Soviet Union. They were rapid-moving, transnational and cellular.
A corner-store burglar in L.A. might turn out to be a Qaeda sympathizer
raising money for a plot being organized overseas. An imam in suburban
Detroit could be recruiting local youths to send to the Sudan for
paramilitary training. Al Qaeda operatives organized their plots in a
hivelike fashion, with collaborators from Afghanistan to London using
e-mail, instant messaging and Yahoo groups; rarely did a single mastermind
run the show. To disrupt these new plots, some intelligence officials
concluded, American agents and analysts would need to cooperate just as
fluidly — trading tips quickly among agents and agencies. Following the
usual chain of command could be fatal. &quot;To fight a network like Al Qaeda,
you need to behave like a network,&quot; John Arquilla, the influential professor
of defense at the Naval Postgraduate School, told me.

It was a fine vision. But analysts were saddled with technology that was
designed in the cold war. They now at least had computers, and intelligence
arrived as electronic messages instead of paper memos. But their computers
still communicated almost exclusively with people inside their agencies.
When the intelligence services were computerized in the '90s, they had
digitally replicated their cold-war divisions — each one building a
multimillion-dollar system that allowed the agency to share information
internally but not readily with anyone outside.

The computer systems were designed to be &quot;air gapped.&quot; The F.B.I. terminals
were connected to one another — but not to the computers at any other
agency, and vice versa. Messages written on the C.I.A.'s network (which they
still quaintly called &quot;cables&quot;) were purely internal. To get a message to
the F.B.I. required a special communication called a &quot;telegraphic
dissemination.&quot; Each agency had databases to amass intelligence, but because
of the air gap, other agencies could not easily search them. The divisions
were partly because of turf battles and partly because of legal restrictions
— but they were also technological. Mike Scheuer, an adviser to the C.I.A.'s
bin Laden unit until 2004, told me he had been frustrated by the inability
of the systems to interpenetrate. &quot;About 80 percent of C.I.A.-F.B.I.
difficulties came from the fact that we couldn't communicate with one
another,&quot; he said. Scheuer told me he would often send a document
electronically to the F.B.I., then call to make sure the agents got it. &quot;And
they'd say, 'We can't find it, can you fax it?' And then we'd call, and
they'd say, 'Well, the system said it came in, but we still can't find it —
so could you courier it over?' &quot; &quot;

These systems have served us very well for five decades,&quot; Dale Meyerrose
told me when I spoke with him recently. But now, he said, they're getting in
the way. &quot;The 16 intelligence organizations of the U.S. are without peer.
They are the best in the world. The trick is, are they collectively the
best?&quot;

Last year, Meyerrose, a retired Air Force major general, was named the chief
information officer — the head computer guy, as it were — for the office of
the director of national intelligence. Established by Congress in 2004, the
D.N.I.'s office has a controversial mandate: it is supposed to report
threats to the president and persuade the intelligence agencies to cooperate
more closely. Both tasks were formerly the role of the C.I.A. director, but
since the C.I.A. director had no budgetary power over the other agencies,
they rarely heeded his calls to pass along their secrets. So the new
elevated position of national-intelligence director was created; ever since,
it has been filled by John
Negroponte&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/john_d_n... &gt;.
Last December, Negroponte hired Meyerrose and gave him the daunting task of
developing mechanisms to allow the various agencies' aging and incompatible
systems to swap data. Right away, Meyerrose ordered some sweeping changes.
In the past, each agency chose its own outside contractor to build
customized software — creating proprietary systems, each of which stored
data in totally different file formats. From now on, Meyerrose said, each
agency would have to build new systems using cheaper, off-the-shelf software
so they all would be compatible. But bureaucratic obstacles were just a part
of the problem Meyerrose faced. He was also up against something deeper in
the DNA of the intelligence services. &quot;We've had this 'need to know' culture
for years,&quot; Meyerrose said. &quot;Well, we need to move to a 'need to share'
philosophy.&quot;

There was already one digital pipeline that joined the agencies (though it
had its own limitations): Intelink, which connects most offices in each
intelligence agency. It was created in 1994 after C.I.A. officials saw how
the Web was rapidly transforming the way private-sector companies shared
information. Intelink allows any agency to publish a Web page, or put a
document or a database online, secure in the knowledge that while other
agents and analysts can access it, the outside world cannot.

So why hasn't Intelink given young analysts instant access to all secrets
from every agency? Because each agency's databases, and the messages flowing
through their internal pipelines, are not automatically put onto Intelink.
Agency supervisors must actively decide what data they will publish on the
network — and their levels of openness vary. Some departments have created
slick, professional sites packed full of daily alerts and searchable
collections of their reports going back years. Others have put up little
more than a &quot;splash page&quot; announcing they exist. Operational information —
like details of a current covert action — is rarely posted, usually because
supervisors fear that a leak could jeopardize a delicate mission.

Nonetheless, Intelink has grown to the point that it contains thousands of
agency sites and several hundred databases. Analysts at the various agencies
generate 50,000 official reports a year, many of which are posted to the
network. The volume of material online is such that analysts now face a new
problem: data overload. Even if they suspect good information might exist on
Intelink, it is often impossible to find it. The system is poorly indexed,
and its internal search tools perform like the pre-Google search engines of
the '90s.&quot;

One of my daily searches is for words like 'Afghanistan' or
'Taliban&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/t... &gt;,'
&quot; I was told by one young military analyst who specializes in threats from
weapons of mass destruction. (He requested anonymity because he isn't
authorized to speak to reporters.) &quot;So I'm looking for reports from field
agents saying stuff like, 'I'm out here, and here's what I saw,' &quot; he
continued. &quot;But I get to my desk and I've got, like, thousands a day —
mountains of information, and no way to organize it.&quot;

Adding to the information glut, there's an increasingly large amount of data
to read outside of Intelink. Intelligence analysts are finding it more
important to keep up with &quot;open source&quot; information — nonclassified material
published in full public view, like newspapers, jihadist blogs and
discussion boards in foreign countries. This adds ever more calories to the
daily info diet. The W.M.D. analyst I spoke to regularly reads the blog of
Juan Cole, a University of
Michigan&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/u... &gt;professor
known for omnivorous linking to, and acerbic analysis of, news
from the Middle East. &quot;He's not someone spies would normally pay attention
to, but now he's out there — and he's a subject-matter expert, right?&quot; the
analyst said.

Intelligence hoarding presented one set of problems, but pouring it into a
common ocean, Meyerrose realized soon after moving into his office, is not
the answer either. &quot;Intelligence is about looking for needles in haystacks,
and we can't just keep putting more hay on the stack,&quot; he said. What the
agencies needed was a way to take the thousands of disparate, unorganized
pieces of intel they generate every day and somehow divine which are the
most important.

Intelligence heads wanted to try to find some new answers to this problem.
So the C.I.A. set up a competition, later taken over by the D.N.I., called
the Galileo Awards: any employee at any intelligence agency could submit an
essay describing a new idea to improve information sharing, and the best
ones would win a prize. The first essay selected was by Calvin Andrus, chief
technology officer of the Center for Mission Innovation at the C.I.A. In his
essay, &quot;The Wiki and the Blog: Toward a Complex Adaptive Intelligence
Community,&quot; Andrus posed a deceptively simple question: How did the Internet
become so useful in helping people find information?

Andrus argued that the real power of the Internet comes from the boom in
self-publishing: everyday people surging online to impart their thoughts and
views. He was particularly intrigued by Wikipedia, the &quot;reader-authored&quot;
encyclopedia, where anyone can edit an entry or create a new one without
seeking permission from Wikipedia's owners. This open-door policy, as Andrus
noted, allows Wikipedia to cover new subjects quickly. The day of the London
terrorist bombings, Andrus visited Wikipedia and noticed that barely minutes
after the attacks, someone had posted a page describing them. Over the next
hour, other contributors — some physically in London, with access to
on-the-spot details — began adding more information and correcting
inaccurate news reports. &quot;You could just sit there and hit refresh, refresh,
refresh, and get a sort of ticker-tape experience,&quot; Andrus told me. What
most impressed Andrus was Wikipedia's self-governing nature. No central
editor decreed what subjects would be covered. Individuals simply wrote
pages on subjects that interested them — and then like-minded readers would
add new facts or fix errors. Blogs, Andrus noted, had the same effect: they
leveraged the wisdom of the crowd. When a blogger finds an interesting
tidbit of news, he posts a link to it, along with a bit of commentary. Then
other bloggers find that link and, if they agree it's an interesting news
item, post their own links pointing to it. This produces a cascade effect.
Whatever the first blogger pointed toward can quickly amass so many links
pointing in its direction that it rockets to worldwide notoriety in a matter
of hours.

Spies, Andrus theorized, could take advantage of these rapid,
self-organizing effects. If analysts and agents were encouraged to post
personal blogs and wikis on Intelink — linking to their favorite analyst
reports or the news bulletins they considered important — then mob
intelligence would take over. In the traditional cold-war spy bureaucracy,
an analyst's report lived or died by the whims of the hierarchy. If he was
in the right place on the totem pole, his report on Soviet missiles could be
pushed up higher; if a supervisor chose to ignore it, the report essentially
vanished. Blogs and wikis, in contrast, work democratically. Pieces of intel
would receive attention merely because other analysts found them
interesting. This grass-roots process, Andrus argued, suited the modern
intelligence challenge of sifting through thousands of disparate clues: if a
fact or observation struck a chord with enough analysts, it would snowball
into popularity, no matter what their supervisors thought.

A profusion of spy blogs and wikis would have another, perhaps even more
beneficial impact. It would drastically improve the search engines of
Intelink. In a paper that won an honorable mention in the Galileo Awards,
Matthew Burton — the young former D.I.A. analyst — made this case. He
pointed out that the best Internet search engines, including Google, all use
&quot;link analysis&quot; to measure the authority of documents. When you type the
search &quot;Afghanistan&quot; into Google, it finds every page that includes that
word. Then it ranks the pages in part by how many links point to the page —
based on the idea that if many bloggers and sites have linked to a page, it
must be more useful than others. To do its job well, Google relies on the
links that millions of individuals post online every day.

This, Burton pointed out, is precisely the problem with Intelink. It has no
links, no social information to help sort out which intel is significant and
which isn't. When an analyst's report is posted online, it does not include
links to other reports, even ones it cites. There's no easy way for agents
to link to a report or post a comment about it. Searching Intelink thus
resembles searching the Internet before blogs and Google came along — a lot
of disconnected information, hard to sort through. If spies were encouraged
to blog on Intelink, Burton reasoned, their profuse linking could mend that
situation. &quot;

Imagine having tools that could spot emerging patterns for you and guide you
to documents that might be the missing pieces of evidence you're looking
for,&quot; Burton wrote in his Galileo paper. &quot;Analytical puzzles, like terror
plots, are often too piecemeal for individual brains to put together. Having
our documents aware of each other would be like hooking several brains up in
a line, so that each one knows what the others know, making the puzzle much
easier to solve.&quot;

With Andrus and Burton's vision in mind, you can almost imagine how 9/11
might have played out differently. In Phoenix, the F.B.I. agent Kenneth
Williams might have blogged his memo noting that Al Qaeda members were
engaging in flight-training activity. The agents observing a Qaeda planning
conference in Malaysia could have mentioned the attendance of a Saudi named
Khalid al-Midhar; another agent might have added that he held a multi-entry
American visa. The F.B.I. agents who snared Zacarias Moussaoui in Minnesota
might have written about their arrest of a flight student with violent
tendencies. Other agents and analysts who were regular readers of these
blogs would have found the material interesting, linked to it, pointed out
connections or perhaps entered snippets of it into a wiki page discussing
this new trend of young men from the Middle East enrolling in pilot
training.

As those four original clues collected more links pointing toward them, they
would have amassed more and more authority in the Intelink search engine.
Any analysts doing searches for &quot;Moussaoui&quot; or &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; or even &quot;flight
training&quot; would have found them. Indeed, the original agents would have been
considerably more likely to learn of one another's existence and perhaps to
piece together the topography of the 9/11 plot. No one was able to prevent
9/11 because nobody connected the dots. But in a system like this, as
Andrus's theory goes, the dots are inexorably drawn together. &quot;Once the
intelligence community has a robust and mature wiki and blog
knowledge-sharing Web space,&quot; Andrus concluded in his essay, &quot;the nature of
intelligence will change forever.&quot;

At first glance, the idea might seem slightly crazy. Outfit the C.I.A. and
the F.B.I. with blogs and wikis? In the civilian world, after all, these
online tools have not always amassed the most stellar reputations. There are
many valuable blogs and wikis, of course, but they are vastly outnumbered by
ones that exist to compile useless ephemera, celebrity gossip and flatly
unverifiable assertions. Nonetheless, Andrus's ideas struck a chord with
many very senior members of the office of the director of national
intelligence. This fall, I met with two of them: Thomas Fingar, the
patrician head of analysis for the D.N.I., and Mike Wertheimer, his chief
technology officer, whose badge clip sports a button that reads &quot;geek.&quot; If
it is Meyerrose's job to coax spy hardware to cooperate, it is Fingar's job
to do the same for analysts.

Fingar and Wertheimer are now testing whether a wiki could indeed help
analysts do their job. In the fall of 2005, they joined forces with C.I.A.
wiki experts to build a prototype of something called Intellipedia, a wiki
that any intelligence employee with classified clearance could read and
contribute to. To kick-start the content, C.I.A. analysts seeded it with
hundreds of articles from nonclassified documents like the C.I.A. World Fact
Book. In April, they sent out e-mail to other analysts inviting them to
contribute, and sat back to see what happened.

By this fall, more than 3,600 members of the intelligence services had
contributed a total of 28,000 pages. Chris Rasmussen, a 31-year-old
&quot;knowledge management&quot; engineer at the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency, spends part of every day writing or editing pages. Rasmussen is part
of the younger generation in the intelligence establishment that is
completely comfortable online; he regularly logs into a sprawling, 50-person
chat room with other Intellipedians, and he also blogs about his daily work
for all other spies to read. He told me the usefulness of Intellipedia
proved itself just a couple of months ago, when a small two-seater plane
crashed into a Manhattan building. An analyst created a page within 20
minutes, and over the next two hours it was edited 80 times by employees of
nine different spy agencies, as news trickled out. Together, they rapidly
concluded the crash was not a terrorist act. &quot;In the intelligence community,
there are so many 'Stay off the grass' signs,&quot; Rasmussen said. &quot;But here,
you're free to do what you want, and it works.&quot;

By the late summer, Fingar decided the Intellipedia experiment was
sufficiently successful that he would embark on an even more high-profile
project: using Intellipedia to produce a &quot;national intelligence estimate&quot;
for Nigeria. An N.I.E. is an authoritative snapshot of what the intelligence
community thinks about a particular state — and a guide for foreign and
military policy. Nigeria, Fingar said, is a complex country, with issues
ranging from energy to Islamic radicalism to polio outbreaks to a coming
election. Intellipedia's Nigeria page will harness the smarts of the dozen
or so analysts who specialize in the country. But it will also, Fingar
hopes, attract contributions from other intelligence employees who have
expertise Fingar isn't yet aware of — an analyst who served in the Peace
Corps&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/p/p... &gt;in
Nigeria, or a staff member who has recently traveled there. In the
traditional method of producing an intelligence estimate, Fingar said, he
would call every agency and ask to borrow their Africa expert for a week or
two of meetings. &quot;And they'd say: 'Well, I only got one guy who can spell
Nigeria, and he's traveling. So you lose.' &quot; In contrast, a wiki will
&quot;change the rules of who can play,&quot; Fingar said, since far-flung analysts
and agents around the world could contribute, day or night.

Yet Intellipedia also courts the many dangers of wikis — including the
possibility of error. What's to stop analysts from posting assertions that
turn out to be false? Fingar admits this will undoubtedly happen. But if
there are enough people looking at an entry, he says, there will always be
someone to catch any grave mistakes. Rasmussen notes that though there is
often strong disagreement and debate on Intellipedia, it has not yet
succumbed to the sort of vandalism that often plagues Wikipedia pages,
including the posting of outright lies. This is partly because, unlike with
Wikipedia, Intellipedia contributors are not anonymous. Whatever an analyst
writes on Intellipedia can be traced to him. &quot;If you demonstrate you've got
something to contribute, hey, the expectation is you're a valued member,&quot;
Fingar said. &quot;You demonstrate you're an idiot, that becomes known, too.&quot;

While the C.I.A. and Fingar's office set up their wiki, Meyerrose's office
was dabbling in the other half of Andrus's equation. In July, his staff
decided to create a test blog to collect intelligence. It would focus on
spotting and predicting possible avian-flu outbreaks and function as part of
a larger portal on the subject to collect information from hundreds of
sources around the world, inside and outside of the intelligence agencies.
Avian flu, Meyerrose reasoned, is a national-security problem uniquely
suited to an online-community effort, because information about the danger
is found all over the world. An agent in Southeast Asia might be the first
to hear news of dangerous farming practices; a medical expert in Chicago
could write a crucial paper on transmission that was never noticed by
analysts.

In August, one of Meyerrose's assistants sat me down to show me a very brief
glimpse of the results. In the months that it has been operational, the
portal has amassed 38,000 &quot;active&quot; participants, though not everyone posts
information. In one corner was the active-discussion area — the group blog
where the participants could post their latest thoughts about avian flu and
others could reply and debate. I noticed a posting, written by a university
academic, on whether the H5N1 virus could actually be transmitted to humans,
which had provoked a dozen comments. &quot;See, these people would never have
been talking before, and we certainly wouldn't have heard about it if they
did,&quot; the assistant said. By September, the site had become so loaded with
information and discussion that Rear Adm. Arthur Lawrence, a top official in
the health department, told Meyerrose it had become the government's most
crucial resource on avian flu.

The blog seemed like an awfully modest thing to me. But Meyerrose insists
that the future of spying will be revolutionized as much by these small-bore
projects as by billion-dollar high-tech systems. Indeed, he says that overly
ambitious projects often result in expensive disasters, the way the F.B.I.'s
$170 million attempt to overhaul its case-handling software died in 2005
after the software became so complex that the F.B.I. despaired of ever
fixing the bugs and shelved it. In contrast, the blog software took only a
day or two to get running. &quot;We need to think big, start small and scale
fast,&quot; Meyerrose said.

Moving quickly, in fact, is crucial to building up the sort of critical mass
necessary to make blogs and wikis succeed. Back in 2003, a Department of
Defense agency decided to train its analysts in the use of blog software, in
hopes that they would begin posting about their work, read one another's
blogs and engage in productive conversations. But the agency's officials
trained only small groups of perhaps five analysts a month. After they
finished their training, those analysts would go online, excited, and start
their blogs. But they'd quickly realize no one else was reading their posts
aside from the four other people they'd gone through the training with.
They'd get bored and quit blogging, just as the next trainees came online.

There was never a tipping point — &quot;never a moment when two people who never
knew each other could begin discussing something,&quot; as Clay Shirky, a
professor at New York
University&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/n... &gt;who
was hired to consult on the project, explained to me. For the
intelligence agencies to benefit from &quot;social software,&quot; he said, they need
to persuade thousands of employees to begin blogging and creating wikis all
at once. And that requires a cultural sea change: persuading analysts, who
for years have survived by holding their cards tightly to their chests, to
begin openly showing their hands online.

Is it possible to reconcile the needs of secrecy with such a radically open
model for sharing? Certainly, there would be merit in a system that lets
analysts quickly locate like-minded colleagues around the world to
brainstorm new ideas about how the Iraqi insurgency will evolve. But the
intelligence agencies also engage in covert operations that ferret out truly
incendiary secrets: the locations of Iranian nuclear facilities, say, or the
name of a Qaeda leader in Pakistan. Is this the sort of information that is
safe to share widely in an online network?

Many in the intelligence agencies suspect not. Indeed, they often refuse to
input sensitive intel into their own private, secure databases; they do not
trust even their own colleagues, inside their own agencies, to keep their
secrets safe. When the F.B.I. unveiled an automated case-support system in
1995, agents were supposed to begin entering all information from their
continuing cases into it, so that other F.B.I. agents could benefit from the
collected pool of tips. But many agents didn't. They worried that a hard-won
source might be accidentally exposed by an F.B.I. agent halfway across the
country. Worse, what would happen if a hacker or criminal found access to
the system?

These are legitimate concerns. After the F.B.I. agent Robert
Hanssen&lt; http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/robert_p... &gt;was
arrested for selling the identities of undercover agents to Russia, it
turned out he had found their names by trawling through records on the
case-support system. As a result, many F.B.I. agents opted to keep their
records on paper instead of trusting the database — even, occasionally,
storing files in shoeboxes shoved under their desks. &quot;When you have a
source, you go to extraordinary lengths to protect their identities,&quot; I. C.
Smith, a 25-year veteran of the bureau, told me. &quot;So agents never trusted
the system, and rightly so.&quot;

Worse, data errors that allow information to leak can often go undetected.
Five years ago, Zalmai Azmi — currently the chief information officer of the
F.B.I. — was working at the Department of Justice on a data-sharing project
with an intelligence agency. He requested data that the agency was supposed
to have scrubbed clean of all classified info. Yet when it arrived, it
contained secret information. What had gone wrong? The agency had passed it
through filters that removed any document marked &quot;secret&quot; — but many
documents were stamped &quot;SECRET,&quot; in uppercase, and the filter didn't catch
the difference. The next time Azmi requested documents, he found yet more
secret documents inadvertently leaked. This time it was because the
documents had &quot;S E C R E T&quot; typed with a space between each letter, and the
filter wasn't programmed to catch that either.

A spy blogosphere, even carefully secured against intruders, might be
fundamentally incompatible with the goal of keeping secrets. And the
converse is also true: blogs and wikis are unlikely to thrive in an
environment where people are guarded about sharing information. Social
software doesn't work if people aren't social.

Virtually all proponents of improved spy sharing are aware of this friction,
and they have few answers. Meyerrose has already strained at boundaries that
make other spies deeply uneasy. During the summer, he set up a completely
open chat board on the Internet and invited anyone interested to participate
in a two-week-long discussion of how to improve the spy agencies' policies
for acquiring new technology.

The chat room was unencrypted and unsecured, so anyone could drop in and
read the postings or mouth off. That way, Meyerrose figured, he'd be more
likely to get drop-ins by engineers from small, scrappy start-up software
firms who might have brilliant ideas but no other way to get an audience
with intelligence chiefs. The chat room provoked howls of outrage. &quot;People
were like, 'Hold it, can't the Chinese and North Koreans listen in?' &quot;
Meyerrose told me. &quot;And, sure, they could. But we weren't going to be
discussing state secrets. And the benefits of openness outweigh the risks.&quot;

For something like Intellipedia, though, which trafficks in genuinely
serious intelligence, hard decisions had to be made about what risks were
acceptable. Fingar says that deeply sensitive intel would never be allowed
onto Intellipedia — particularly if it was operational information about a
mission, like a planned raid on a terrorist compound. Indeed, Meyerrose's
office is building three completely separate versions of Intellipedia for
each of the three levels of secrecy: Top Secret, Secret and Unclassified.
Each will be placed on a data network configured so that only people with
the correct level of clearance can see them — and these networks are tightly
controlled, so sensitive information typed into the Top Secret Intellipedia
cannot accidentally leak into the Unclassified one.

But will this make the Intellipedia less useful? There are a few million
government employees who could look at the relatively unsecret Intellipedia.
In contrast, only a few thousand intelligence officials qualify for a Top
Secret clearance, and thus will be allowed into the elite version. This
presents a secrecy paradox. The Unclassified Intellipedia will have the
biggest readership and thus will grow the most rapidly; but if it's devoid
of truly sensitive secrets, will it be of any use?

Fingar says yes, for an interesting reason: top-secret information is
becoming less useful than it used to be. &quot;The intelligence business was
initially, if not inherently, about secrets — running risks and expending a
lot of money to acquire secrets,&quot; he said, with the idea that &quot;if you limit
how many people see it, it will be more secure, and you will be able to get
more of it. But that's now appropriate for a small and shrinking percentage
of information.&quot; The time is past for analysts to act like &quot;monastic
scholars in a cave someplace,&quot; he added, laboring for weeks or months in
isolation to produce a report.

Fingar says that more value can be generated by analysts sharing bits of
&quot;open source&quot; information — the nonclassified material in the broad world,
like foreign newspapers, newsletters and blogs. It used to be that
on-the-ground spies were the only ones who knew what was going on in a
foreign country. But now the average citizen sitting in her living room can
peer into the debates, news and lives of people in Iran. &quot;If you want to
know what the terrorists' long-term plans are, the best thing is to read
their propaganda — the stuff out there on the Internet,&quot; the W.M.D. analyst
told me. &quot;I mean, it's not secret. They're telling us.&quot;

Fingar and Andrus and other intelligence thinkers do not play down the
importance of covert ops or high-tech satellite surveillance in intercepting
specific jihadist plots. But in a world that is awash in information, it is
possible, they say, that the meaning of intelligence is shifting. Beat cops
in Indiana might be as likely to uncover evidence of a terror plot as
undercover C.I.A. agents in Pakistan. Fiery sermons printed on pamphlets in
the U.K. might be the most valuable tool in figuring out who's raising money
for a possible future London bombing. The most valuable spy system is one
that can quickly assemble disparate pieces that are already lying around —
information gathered by doctors, aid workers, police officers or security
guards at corporations.

The premise of spy-blogging is that a million connected amateurs will always
be smarter than a few experts collected in an elite star chamber; that
Wikipedia will always move more quickly than the Encyclopaedia Britannica;
that the country's thousand-odd political bloggers will always spot news
trends more quickly than slow-moving journalists in the mainstream media.
Yet one of the most successful new terrorism-busting spy organizations since
9/11 does in fact function like a star chamber. The National
Counterterrorism Center was established by Congress in 2004 and charged with
spotting the most important terrorism threats as they emerge. The
counterterrorism center is made up of representatives from every
intelligence agency — C.I.A., F.B.I., N.S.A. and others — who work together
under one roof. Each analyst has access to details particular to his or her
agency, and they simply share information face to face. The analysts check
their personal networks for the most dire daily threats and bring them to
the group. In three meetings a day, the officials assess all the intel that
has risen to their attention — and they jointly decide what the nation's
most serious threats are. &quot;We call it carbon-based integration,&quot; said
William Spalding, the center's chief information officer.

When I raised the idea of collaborative tools like blogs and wikis, Spalding
and Russ Travers, one of the center's deputy directors, were skeptical. The
whole reason the center works, they said, is that experts have a top-down
view that is essential to picking the important information out of the
surrounding chatter. The grass roots, they've found, are good at collecting
threats but not necessarily at analyzing them. If a lot of low-level
analysts are pointing to the same inaccurate posting, that doesn't make it
any less wrong.&quot;

The key is to have very smart people culling&quot; the daily tips, Travers told
me. In October, for example, nervous rumors that a football stadium in the
United States would be subject to a nuclear attack flooded the National
Counterterrorism Center; analysts there immediately suspected it was
spurious. &quot;The terrorist problem has the worst signal-to-noise ratio,&quot;
Travers said. Without the knowledge that comes from long experience, he
added, a fledgling analyst or spy cannot know what is important or not. The
counterterrorism center, he said, should decide which threats warrant
attention. &quot;That's our job,&quot; he said.

The Spying 2.0 vision has thus created a curious culture battle in
intelligence circles. Many of the officials at the very top, like Fingar,
Meyerrose and their colleagues at the office of the director of national
intelligence, are intrigued by the potential of a freewheeling,
smart-mobbing intelligence community. The newest, youngest analysts are in
favor of it, too. The resistance comes from the &quot;iron majors&quot; — career
officers who occupy the enormous middle bureaucracy of the spy agencies.
They might find the idea of an empowered grass roots to be foolhardy; they
might also worry that it threatens their turf.

And the critics might turn out to be right. As Clay Shirky of N.Y.U. points
out, most wikis and blogs flop. A wiki might never reach a critical mass of
contributors and remain anemic until eventually everyone drifts away; many
bloggers never attract any attention and, discouraged, eventually stop
posting. Wikipedia passed the critical-mass plateau a year ago, but it is a
rarity. &quot;The normal case for social software is failure,&quot; Shirky said. And
because Intellipedia is now a high-profile experiment with many skeptics,
its failure could permanently doom these sorts of collaborative spy
endeavors.

There is also the practical question of running a huge civil-service agency
where you have to assess the performance of your staff. It might be
difficult to measure contributions to a wiki; if a brilliant piece of
analysis emerges from the mob, who gets credit for it? &quot;A C.I.A. officer's
career is advanced by producing reports,&quot; notes David Weinberger, a fellow
at the Harvard Berkman Center for the Internet and Society, who consulted
briefly with the C.I.A. on its social software. &quot;His ability is judged by
those reports. And that gets in the way of developing knowledge socially,
where it becomes very difficult to know who added or revised what.&quot;

In addition, civil libertarians are alarmed by the idea of spies casually
passing sensitive information around from one agency to another. &quot;I don't
want the N.S.A. passing on information about innocent Americans to local
cops in San Diego,&quot; Weinberger said. &quot;Those laws exist for good reasons.&quot;

In many ways, the new generation of Web-savvy spies frames the same
troubling questions as the Patriot Act, which sought to break down the
barriers preventing military spy agencies from conducting operations inside
the United States, on American citizens, and then sharing that information
with domestic groups. On a sheerly practical level, it makes sense to get
rid of all barriers: why not let the N.S.A. wiretap American conversations?
Vice President Cheney has argued forcefully that these historical barriers
between agencies hobble the American military and intelligence forces; the
Patriot Act was designed in part to eliminate them. Terrorist groups like Al
Qaeda heed no such boundaries, which is precisely why they can move so
quickly and nimbly.

Then again, there's a limit to how much the United States ought to emulate
Al Qaeda's modus operandi. &quot;The problems the spies face are serious; I
sympathize with that,&quot; Shirky told me. &quot;But they shouldn't be wiping up
every bit of information about every American citizen.&quot; The Pentagon's
infamous Total Information Awareness program, which came to light in 2002,
was intended to scoop up information on citizens from a variety of sources —
commercial purchase databases, government records — and mine it for
suggestive terrorism connections. But to many Americans, this sort of
dot-connecting activity seemed like an outrageous violation of privacy, and
soon after it was exposed, the program was killed. James X. Dempsey,
director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, maintains that the laws
on spying and privacy need new clarity. The historic morass of legislation,
including the Patriot Act, has become too confusing, he says; both spies and
the public are unsure what walls exist. While Dempsey agrees that agencies
should probably be allowed to swap more information than they currently do,
he says that revamped rules must also respect privacy — &quot;otherwise, we'll
keep on producing programs that violate people's sense of what's right, and
they'll keep getting shut down.&quot;

For all the complaints about hardware, the challenges are only in part about
technology. They are also about political will and institutional culture —
and whether the spy agencies can be persuaded to change. Some former
intelligence officials have expressed skepticism about whether Meyerrose and
Fingar and their national-intelligence colleagues have the clout and power
to persuade the agencies to adopt this new paradigm. Though D.N.I. officials
say they have direct procurement authority over technology for all the
agencies, there's no evidence yet that Meyerrose will be able to make a
serious impact on the eight spy agencies in the Department of Defense, which
has its own annual $38 billion intelligence budget — the lion's share of all
the money the government spends on spying. When I spoke to Wilson P. Dizard
III, a writer with Government Computer News who has covered federal
technology issues for two decades, he said, &quot;You have all these little
barons at N.S.A. and C.I.A. and whatever, and a lot of people think they're
not going to do what the D.N.I. says, if push comes to shove.&quot;

Today's spies exist in an age of constant information exchange, in which
everyday citizens swap news, dial up satellite pictures of their houses and
collaborate on distant Web sites with strangers. As John Arquilla told me,
if the spies do not join the rest of the world, they risk growing to
resemble the rigid, unchanging bureaucracy that they once confronted during
the cold war. &quot;Fifteen years ago we were fighting the Soviet Union,&quot; he
said. &quot;Who knew it would be replicated today in the intelligence community?&quot;
