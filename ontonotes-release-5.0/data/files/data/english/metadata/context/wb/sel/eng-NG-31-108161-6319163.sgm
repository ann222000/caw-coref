Does anyone know of a simple - inexpensive software that would
separate the video an audio files in a AVI file into two separate
files

Thanks in advance

NanDub will strip out the audio as a wave file and I guess you could then
mute the original avi file in whatever editor you are using.

Check out MPEG Streamclip, I believe it will do what you want:

It's free, btw, and available for Mac and Windows systems.

Hope this helps...

It's a great program for mpeg files - I use it on my MAC and PC but it won't
demux AVI files. ASAIK only Nandub (free) will do it.

Hmm, I thought I remembered doing it with MPEG Streamclip and a quick
glance at their site seemed to confirm the capability, but a brief
test showed the demux options disabled for an AVI.

If Nandub just copies the audio out but leaves the audio data in the
AVI, then I wouldn't say that it's accomplishing the task either.

What about using VirtualDub to create separate audio and video files
(where the video file has no audio data)?  Three steps:  Save WAV, set
Audio to No audio, Save as AVI.  That seemed to work OK for me just
now.

NanDub is VirtualDub optimised for avi files.

It seems specific to DivX/XVID; not sure how that relates to being
optimized for AVI (compared to VirtualDub itself without respect to
codec).

Anyway, the NanDub page on SourceForge indicates the most recent
release dates back to July of 2001; the most recent release of
VirtualDub was just a few weeks ago.  I don't really buy that a 5+
year old hack of VirtualDub is a better choice than VirtualDub itself,
and given the apparently abandoned state of NanDub I wouldn't really
recommend it to others.

I think that the answer may be Avidemux. It's not perfect, but it's
free and may meet the OP's needs.

Download from ulead.com a free trial.  I use Media Studio Pro 8 and
know it will do this for any type file.  I'm not sure about Video
Studio 10.  Anyway, download the free trial of MSP8.  Insert your avi
clip.  Left click the video track to select it, then Right click and
choose Split.  this splits the audio from the video.  Works with mpg
or avi or HD mpg or ?? type files.  Then Files - Create - Audio File
and choose format wav.  If desired, when finished, right click again
and Unite; only works if you haven't moved either track so the synch
is still there.  Then you can continue moving tracks around after
creating your audio file.  The audio editor in MSP8 isn't very good.
Suggest a free program Audacity, then you can load the saved wav file
and manipulate it as desired.

If just for this one project, the free trial will work fine and is
free.  for future use, I'd check Video Studio 10 as it's under $100 to
see if it will do the same thing.

As we really don't what type of avi container the OP was talking about it's
all a bit of a guessing game - if it is DivX  or Xvid then NanDub despite
it's age handles the audio somewhat better than VirtualDub where you tend
to get  the  dreaded "Virtualdub has detected an improper vbr audio encoding
blah blah error" whilst Nandub handles these types of files smoothly as does
the mod of VirtualDub that AutoGK uses - however as the OP seems to have
abandoned the post and left us talking amongst ourselves it's fairly
academic as to what type of avi container he is talking about!!!

If it is from a DV camera then VirtualDub latest would be my first choice or
maybe AVImux.
