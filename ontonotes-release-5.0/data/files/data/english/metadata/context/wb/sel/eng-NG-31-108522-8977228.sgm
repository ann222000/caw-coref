I have just been given a goose/gander, the previous owner isn't sure what
sort.  It is said to be a gander, it is 3 years old.  It is a large bird,
about 25in high and 40in around.  It is mostly white but grey/brown on the
head and upper neck and the wings.  The bill is orange and the eyes blue.

Searching for internet images it looks most like a Normandy Goose.  The
gender is confusing as one site says males are all white and females white
and grey.  Another site says the reverse.

I would like to get some companions for him/her and end up with a gander and
say 3 geese.

Can anybody help me identify this bird.

David

to be honest I doubt it's a Normandy -- you have not mentioned a crest.

Many domestic geese end up with this patching of colouring. Its common of
many crosses.

Try www.waterfowl.org.uk
http://www.ashtonwaterfowl.net/ewsgeese.htm

Most geese are very difficult to sex, and if its mixed colour almost
impossible.
If you can find someone who has known geese, if they have laid eggs, then
you should be fine.
If you find next year that this bird also lays eggs you have the more simple
job of finding a gander.

Hi, David!
Everything Jill says is right-on.
As someone who has kept geese for a long time, I have noticed some
slight differences in adult birds that may also be of help.
In a GOOSE of three years, there may be a formation of the underbody
feathers into a sort-of defined keel right down the center of her true
keel.  In other words, her center is a bit pinched along that center
line.
Most GANDERS, on the other hand, either totally lack this sharpness on
the keel or actually have a pouchy area to one side that puffs against
one leg at body.
Mixed breed birds are still a pleasure, so don't get bent out of shape
if this is the case.  If you want offspring or to add certain
charactaristics to your flock, then just add that to your criteria
when you obtain his/her companions.
Hope you get hooked like I have.  Geese are beautiful.

Thankyou both.  I wasn't aiming for racial purity just to keep him/her happy
and maybe breed some if we were lucky.

I don't know about a crest, he has a small knob on his head., is that what
you mean?

He is also an excellent flier.   Given a slight downhill run he easily got
airborn and flew about 500m.

Thats more likely to have some chinese in it.
http://www.ashtonwaterfowl.net/ewsgeese.htm scroll down -- the Normandy's
have a crest of feathers.

Definately sounds like a chinese cross, they tend to be lighter and more
athletic, the physics works better. We have chinese/ grey back crosses and
they are great birds.

It could be a saddleback pomeranian goose..but the color scheme you
mention often crops up when you crossbreed toulouse geese with white
embdens or white chinese..
