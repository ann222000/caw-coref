Just before I was to start Remicade at the end of last month I
experienced congestive heart failure.  I feel good now but still have
a fibrillation problem to fix.
My RD won't put me on Remicade because of the heart problem so I'll be
trying Orencia in the near future.
Instead of a progress report on the Remicade it'll be on Orencia.

hi Thumper,
I found the orencia infusion to be a no brainer - didn't take very long.  I
did get the unfortunate side effect of major headaches at the end though so
they took me off (added to the fact that it didn't really do anything within
the time period for my joints. It did help with energy though which was
good).

Several people here have done well on it - seems to me that KJ is one and
she is not reporting in so still must be doing well.

Good luck to you!  Sorry to hear about the heart problems though - if it
isn't one thing it is another!  Darn. Will look forward to your progress
report though

Kelly

Thumper, my fibrillation and congestive heart failure led to an implanted
defibrillator.  Had that done in January and so far it is doing fine.

Great!  I believe that they are first going to go in with a catheter
and map the heart, then give problem areas an RF pulse to cause scar
tissue and block the erroneous pulses.  We'll see how it goes.  I have
to get past my stress test first.

Thank you all.

I actually had a very good time in the hospital.  They treated me
great and I met a 95 year old guy (on Halloween) in the next bed who
has given me a new outlook on life.  I'm only 61 and sometimes the RA
makes me cranky and feeling old.  This gentleman didn't have a cranky
bone in his body.  He also had atrial fibrillation.  He still drives,
tends his sizeable garden, eats out at local restaurants, is very
independent,  and on the whole is much more active than I.  Very
rarely do you meet someone that you just instantly like
wholeheartedly, but I did.  He got a pacemaker while he was there and
when I was about to have a cardioversion he was wheeled into the
atrium of the cardiac suite and called out my name asking if I was ok,
even though he was about to go under himself.
He had to go temporarily to a nursing home for a couple of weeks of
rehab and My wife and I visited several times.  He seemed like he was
on vacation as his wife spent a couple of years at the facility while
dying of cancer.  He knew all the staff and they fawned over him.

He lives alone in an upscale senior trailer park with many nearby
relatives and friends from the 2 churches he regularly attends.  One
would think that someone that belongs to 2 churches would talk about
religion but we talked about practically everything else and religion
only when he told me that someone or other was coming in to give him
communion.

My dilemma now is what do I get for a 95 year old man for his
birthday?  Knowing him, he probably wants to go trick or treating.

Meeting him has truly been a life changing event for me and I'm sure
we'll stay friends until one of us dies.
