I'm sure everyone here knows the kilogram is currently defined
as the amount of mass in this one particular lump of metal stored in
the outskirts of Paris.  What I didn't know is that for the past thirty
years its mass has been fluctuating relative to the duplicates made at
the same time to serve as secondary references.  Speaking precisely, of
course, its mass can't fluctuate, but that just means everything in the
universe is suffering from a gain in mass of about fifty parts in a
billion:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7084099.stm

Apparently it's not clear whether the other reference kilograms
or the Paris one is the problem.  But the General Conference on Weights
and Measures is meeting this week to discuss the problem.

Is that still the one true standard?  Haven't they gone to some
easily-reproducible standard by now?  I think the second is defined by
cesium, and the meter is defined by the speed of light in a vacuum;
from those (and some water) you can define the kg.

The kilogram is the only SI unit that is still defined by a specific
object. They've been thinking about redefining it in terms of
fundamental constants, but it hasn't happened yet.

You can't just redefine the kilogram as the mass of a litre of water,
because the lump of metal isn't exactly that mass. There are so many
units derived from the kilogram that they can't change it now.
Apparently, the leading contender for a new definition is to use the
force generated by a known current moving through a known magnetic flux
and measured by a Watt Balance.

The kg is the last unit defined by an artifact.  Scientific American IIRC,
had an article on the work being done to eliminate that, but it's
significantly non-trivial.

They were talking about mono-crystline Silicon spheres.  But finishing one
to -exactly- 1 decimeter (or something like that) is far trickyer than it
seems.

Remember that you want to end up with more accuracy than simply going off
to this arbitray things and saying &quot;A kilogram masses that much&quot;.  We're
talking about the weight of a fingerprint being significant.

They have to wait until they can find an easily-reproducible standard
that is actually reproducible (even if not easily).

You would need water that is extraordinarily pure--I suspect much purer
than anything actually obtainable.  It would also have to be isotopically
pure, or at least have a well-defined isotopic composition.  And then you
would need a vessel that is measurable with your world-class standard-meter
apparatus at every conceivable point.  (If the vessel is spherical, how
do you prove it is perfectly spherical?  If it is a cube, how you prove
all panels of the cube are absolutely flat over their entire surface?)
And the vessels needs to be rigorously cleaned, with something that leaves
no residue to dissolve into or displace your water.  And the vessel needs
to not deform under the weight of the water, or the gravitational
attraction of nearby apparatuses.

They aren't going to redefine the kilogram to be something which is even
less reliable than what they already have.

Shirley you've heard of Gravity Probe B, [now finished], &quot;the
relativity gyroscope experiment being developed by NASA and
Stanford University to test two extraordinary, unverified
predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.&quot;

[they made the perfectest spheres ever for the gyros, out of
quartz, IIRC]

&quot;The experiment will check, very precisely, tiny changes in the
direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth
satellite orbiting at 400-mile altitude directly over the poles.
So free are the gyroscopes from disturbance that they will
provide an almost perfect space-time reference system. They will
measure how space and time are warped by the presence of the
Earth, and, more profoundly, how the Earth's rotation drags
space-time around with it. These effects, though small for the
Earth, have far-reaching implications for the nature of matter
and the structure of the Universe. &quot;

There's more to it than that, since you have to tie in mass somehow,
but I don't remember the whole article.

Another approach is to create a silicon sphere and to nail down
Avogadro's Number at the same time.
