I have to wonder if you're getting this advice from truckers by any
chance?  I can understand where they're coming from if their antennas
aren't springloaded (so they're basically smashing the damn thing if
they drive under something shorter than the antenna is).

No. Fiberglass is a protection of the actual wire that makes up the
antenna. It is so thin with respect to the wavelength at CB
frequencies that is essentially lossless. It will not deteriate
reception or transmission.
