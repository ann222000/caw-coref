Perhaps Mr. Campos should hear from some of us, why the 9/11 event is
about justice, not (right wing) exploitation, and thus deserves
continued attention until justice is served. ~S

Paul F. CAMPOS 9/11: The most overblown event in U.S. history
: 08/16/2007 05:33:34 AM PDT
WHEN STU Bykofsky, a columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News, wrote
a column last week in which he openly hoped that America suffers
&quot;another 9/11,&quot; he merely had the poor judgment to say what many a
right-wing politician and pundit is thinking...
...
It didn't &quot;change everything,&quot; and it didn't (and doesn't) justify
the Iraq war, indiscriminate spying on Americans, extra-judicial
renditions, torture or any of the other immoral actions that continue
to be done in its name.
It's high time to stop wallowing in our obsession with what is
becoming the most overblown and shamelessly exploited event in
American history.

Paul F. Campos (Paul.Cam ... @Colorado.edu) is a law professor at the

Hi Scott,

I liked this piece by Paul Campos. He spells out how
Americans (and Iraqis and Afghanis) have been screwed
by 9/11. But you're right, he didn't get into the
question of 9/11 as a fraud. Maybe he knows it is a
fraud but to get published he decided to conveniently
avoid the issue.

I wrote him and told him that I liked his piece, but
recommended that we question the assumptions of who
actually carried out 9/11.

Thanks for sending!

Paul Campos did a piece about the Truth movement about a year ago that
some regarded as a hit piece. Â I didn't think it was that bad.
