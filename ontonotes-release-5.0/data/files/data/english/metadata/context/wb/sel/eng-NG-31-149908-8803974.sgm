This is quite a lengthy article, but it is certainly helpful to
understand your child's natural intelligence so that we can help them
learn better and communicate more effectively with them, don't you
think?

Multiple Intelligences
By
Jay Davidson

In Howard Gardner's &quot;Frames of Mind&quot;, he proposes that there are seven
main areas in which all people have special skills; he calls them
Intelligences. His research at Harvard University was in response to
the work that Alfred Binet had done in France around 1900. Binet's
work led to the formation of an intelligence test; we are all familiar
with the &quot;intelligence quotient,&quot; or &quot;IQ,&quot;  the way that intelligence
is measured on his test.

These tests look predominantly at two types of intelligences: verbal
and math. If a person does well on these, he/she is considered
&quot;intelligent,&quot; and is a candidate for one of the better colleges or
universities. But what about everyone else? How many of you who are
reading these words have used the phrase &quot;not good at taking tests,&quot;
when talking either about yourself or your child?

The Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory proposes that there are other
measures of intelligence beside these two. I offer this information to
you so that you can understand that while many teachers have some
knowledge of MI theory, most of our schools are not fully set up to
use it to the advantage of all students.

That being the case, perhaps you can either (1) be involved in helping
your child's teachers and school to provide a more balanced program
that develops his intelligences that are not more included in the
curriculum or (2) find activities outside of the school environment in
which your child can develop his dominant areas of intelligence.

You should also know that MI theory posits that each of us has, to
some degree or another, all of these intelligences. Some of them are
simply more developed than others. Furthermore, we are all able to
improve our ability in each of these areas.

Howard Gardner stresses that the intelligences are equal in their
importance. In alphabetical order, they are:

1. Bodily-kinesthetic:

Using one's body to solve problems and express ideas and feelings.
Actors, athletes, and dancers use their whole bodies in this way, much
the same way that craftspeople, sculptors, and mechanics use their
hands.

These questions can determine if an adult has a strength in Bodily-
Kinesthetic Intelligence:

* Do you regularly participate in a sport or some physical
activity?
* Is it difficult to sit still for long periods of time?
* Do you enjoy working with your hands in creating things?
* Do you find that ideas and solutions to problems come to you
while you are exercising or doing some sort
of physical activity?
* Do you enjoy spending your free time outdoors?
* Do you speak with your hands or other body gestures?
* Do you learn more about things by touching them?
* Do you enjoy thrilling amusement park rides such as the
roller coaster and other activities like this?
* Do you think of yourself as being well-coordinated?
* In order to learn a new skill, do you have to practice it to
learn it, rather than read about it or see it video?

These are some questions to see if children have a well-developing
Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence.

Does your child:
* excel in more than one sport?
* move various body parts when required to sit still for long
periods of time?
* have the ability to mimic others' body movements?
* enjoy taking things apart and putting them back together?
* have a hard time keeping hands off objects?
* enjoy running, jumping, or other physical activities?
* show skill in activities that require fine-motor
coordination, such as origami, making paper airplanes,
building models, finger-painting, clay, or knitting?
* use his body well to express himself?

2. Interpersonal:

Perceiving the moods, feelings, and needs of others. It includes
salespeople, teachers, counselors, and those we have come to call the
helping professions.

These questions can determine if an adult has a strength in
Interpersonal Intelligence:

* Have people always come to you for advice?
* Have you always preferred group sports to solo sports?
* Do you usually prefer talking to other people about a
problem, rather than figure it out on your own?
* Do you have at least three close friends?
* Do you prefer social activities over individual pursuits?
* Do you enjoy teaching others what you can do well?
* Are you considered to be a leader, either by yourself or
others?
* Do you feel comfortable in a crowd?
* Do you prefer to spend your time with others than alone?

These are some questions to determine if children may be exhibiting a
well-developing Interpersonal Intelligence.

Does your child:
* enjoy socializing with friends?
* seem to be a natural leader?
* empathize easily with others, which leads to his give advice
to friends who come to him with problems?
* seem to be street-smart?

3. Intrapersonal

Turning inward with a well-developed self-knowledge and using it
successfully to navigate oneself through the world.

These questions can determine if an adult has a strength in
Intrapersonal Intelligence:

* Have you set goals for yourself regularly?
* Do you have a realistic view of your strengths and
weaknesses?
* Would you prefer spending time by yourself rather than with
many people around you?
* Do you keep a diary or journal to record the events of your
inner life?

consideration to starting your own business?

These are some questions to determine if children may be exhibiting a
well-developing Intrapersonal Intelligence.

Does your child:
* show a sense or independence or a strong will?
* have a realistic sense of her abilities and weaknesses?

Intelligence:

studies, more than math and science?
