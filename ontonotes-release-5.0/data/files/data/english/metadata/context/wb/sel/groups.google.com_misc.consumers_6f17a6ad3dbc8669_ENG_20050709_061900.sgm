Over many years now, I've been complaining about how frustrating it is to
try to buy ANYTHING I want in a retail store. Most of the time, I find
whatever I'm looking for is sold out, or they don't carry it. I may be
slow, but I finally noticed a pattern. It goes like this. I've done my
research carefully to figure out what I want to buy. I want widget X. I
pull up the web sites of various stores like CompUSA, Best Buy, Circuit
City, etc. and see who carries it. Now I really want widget X quickly, so I
go to the local store to buy it. When I get there, widget X is sold out, or
&quot;Internet Only&quot; (when the web site doesn't specify &quot;Internet Only&quot;). But
they have gobs of widget Y on hand. Widget Y is invariably less useful
(worse specifications) AND a lot more expensive than widget X.

Now I'm living in an area where all the decent stores are a one hour drive
(one way) from home. And have you noticed the price of gas lately? So I'm
using the cell phone (free) to call ahead. Wouldn't you know it. I don't
even have to go to the store to get the bait and switch pitch. I called CC
to ask about a particular DVD recorder. It is listed on the CC web site.
No, it's not listed as Internet ONLY. But the salesman at CC told me that
it is Internet ONLY. Oh, but they have another brand that is less useful
for an extra hundred bucks, and they have plenty of THOSE in stock. How
helpful.

Now I don't mean to pick on Circuit City in particular. I generally like
them. But they are just the latest store that I've noticed is running this
particular scam. I think some stores (not just CC and BB) deliberately list
very good deals on their web site that are &quot;Internet ONLY&quot;, but not LABELLED
as such on the web site, just to get you into the retail store to buy
something at a much higher profit margin. Or, bait and switch.

Anybody else notice this? I think that there should be a law stating that
if you offer something for sale on your web site, then you must carry it in
your retail store, AND that you must make reasonable efforts to have it IN
STOCK, usually. -Dave

that CC and BB are real-time but with CompUSA their stock seems

"/> Don't listen to the high school kids who work at big box retailers.
They're more interested in avoiding work than they are in helping you
out.

I've related the story in the past of how I went to my local CompUSA
to pick up a laptop bag that the CompUSA web site listed as being in
stock at that store. There were none out on display, so I grabbed a
clerk and asked him to help me find them. He took a quick look on the
same shelves I had been looking at and said &quot;I've never seen that one
- we don't carry it.&quot; I pulled out my printout from the CompUSA web
site, proving that they DO carry it. His next lie was &quot;well, then,
we're out of stock.&quot; I pointed to the spot on the printout where it
said that his store had them in stock. His response: &quot;well, the web
site is wrong.&quot; I suggested that he check his own computer just to be
sure. He couldn't think of a reason not to, so he did (while I watched
over his shoulder to make sure he didn't lie and say they had none).
Sure enough, the computer showed 20 of them in stock. So he grudgingly
went back to the &quot;warehouse&quot; to look for one.

After about 5 mninutes he returned empty-handed, claiming he couldn't
find any. I asked if perhaps there was a MANAGER available who might
know where to find them. Realizing he wasn't going to get rid of me,
he once again disappeared into the &quot;warehouse,&quot; only this time he
returned with one of the laptop bags. Yes, just one - apparently he
wasn't interested in bringing out a few more to put out on the shelf
so maybe they could sell some.

To this day I have never seen a single one of those bags out on the
shelf (and I make it a point to look every time I go in, just to
check).

The moral of this story is you should never take a big box clerk's
word for it - especially if the web site shows the item in stock.
Escalate it to the manager if you have to - even if these kids aren't
motivated to sell you something, the manager sure ought to be.

If there was wording on the web site stating &quot;Internet ONLY&quot;, that would be

you visit or call the retail store. In the retail store, you will discover
that many of the items on the web site simply don't exist, but more
expensive (and usually lower quality) items are readily available. On a
side note . . . I recently found a power tool listed on the Home Depot web
site as not available online (meaning, only carried in retail stores). Now
the interesting thing about this was, I actually FOUND that exact same tool
in the local Home Depot store that same day that I saw it listed online.
But the price in Home Depot was higher than the price listed on the Home
Depot web site. And yes, I verified that the model numbers matched. So
IMHO, this is yet another form of bait and switch. After all, HD couldn't
claim that the lower price was Internet ONLY, if the item wasn't even

"/> My CompUSA seems to routinely loses a couple of each item, and
sadly they never update the stock count to show that they don't
actually have it. And remember that their website is only
current as of 9am or so, which means it is entirely possible
that it will claim that they have it and they don't anymore. Of
course, in your case where they claimed to have a whole case of
them, it's likely that they misplaced a case.

&gt; HUNDREDS of a more expensive (whatever) in stock. That's something else
&gt; I've noticed. I'll go to a store to buy X (which is supposed to be there,
&gt; according to the store's web site). They won't have X. But they will have
&gt; Y, which is more expensive. And if you look up, you will see entire pallets
&gt; (plural) of Y stacked up high above the display area. -Dave

&gt;&gt;&gt;Over many years now, I've been complaining about how frustrating it is to
&gt;&gt;&gt;try to buy ANYTHING I want in a retail store. Most of the time, I find
&gt;&gt;&gt;whatever I'm looking for is sold out, or they don't carry it. I may be
&gt;&gt;&gt;slow, but I finally noticed a pattern. It goes like this. I've done my
&gt;&gt;&gt;research carefully to figure out what I want to buy. I want widget X. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;pull up the web sites of various stores like CompUSA, Best Buy, Circuit
&gt;&gt;&gt;City, etc. and see who carries it. Now I really want widget X quickly, so
&gt;&gt;&gt;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;go to the local store to buy it. When I get there, widget X is sold out,
&gt;&gt;&gt;or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Internet Only&quot; (when the web site doesn't specify &quot;Internet Only&quot;). But
&gt;&gt;&gt;they have gobs of widget Y on hand. Widget Y is invariably less useful
&gt;&gt;&gt;(worse specifications) AND a lot more expensive than widget X.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now I'm living in an area where all the decent stores are a one hour drive
&gt;&gt;&gt;(one way) from home. And have you noticed the price of gas lately? So
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;using the cell phone (free) to call ahead. Wouldn't you know it. I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;even have to go to the store to get the bait and switch pitch. I called
&gt;&gt;&gt;CC
&gt;&gt;&gt;to ask about a particular DVD recorder. It is listed on the CC web site.
&gt;&gt;&gt;No, it's not listed as Internet ONLY. But the salesman at CC told me that
&gt;&gt;&gt;it is Internet ONLY. Oh, but they have another brand that is less useful
&gt;&gt;&gt;for an extra hundred bucks, and they have plenty of THOSE in stock. How
&gt;&gt;&gt;helpful.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now I don't mean to pick on Circuit City in particular. I generally like
&gt;&gt;&gt;them. But they are just the latest store that I've noticed is running
&gt;&gt;&gt;this
&gt;&gt;&gt;particular scam. I think some stores (not just CC and BB) deliberately
&gt;&gt;&gt;list
&gt;&gt;&gt;very good deals on their web site that are &quot;Internet ONLY&quot;, but not
&gt;&gt;&gt;LABELLED
&gt;&gt;&gt;as such on the web site, just to get you into the retail store to buy
&gt;&gt;&gt;something at a much higher profit margin. Or, bait and switch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Anybody else notice this? I think that there should be a law stating that
&gt;&gt;&gt;if you offer something for sale on your web site, then you must carry it
&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;your retail store, AND that you must make reasonable efforts to have it IN
&gt;&gt;&gt;STOCK, usually. -Dave

&gt;&gt; So buy it online and save the two hour drive. I don't understand the
&gt;&gt; problem.

&gt; What if you want to see widget X in person and haven't been able to see it
&gt; in person to get a &quot;hands on&quot; look to make absolutely sure it's what you
&gt; want. Also what if the venders who sell widget X on line want $$$ for
&gt; shipping? I can think of lots of reasons to want to see the various widgets
&gt; in a real store.

&gt;All of the stores you listed let you order for in-store pickup.
&gt;If I lived that far away I would most definitely order online,

&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;I think the more likely thing is that the price is only
&gt;available on the Internet. It's possible that it is sold out in
&gt;the stores, or a closeout item that they don't have. In any

&gt;&gt;The obvious question is, WHY NOT? I mean, if you see something listed on
&gt;&gt;the (for example) Circuit City web site, why would you assume that it's NOT
&gt;&gt;available for sale at a Circuit City store?

&gt; I wouldn't assume that the web site has even heard of the store,
&gt; or vice versa, unless it is indicated otherwise. While there is a
&gt; good chance the store and the web site are related, they may not
&gt; be (and one of them may have a good case for trademark infringement).
&gt; They may well be completely separate corporations under the same
&gt; parent and have completely different management and completely
&gt; different product lines. For example, the web site could be a
&gt; subcontractor for electrical construction work.

&gt;&gt;That is, unless it is clearly
&gt;&gt;marked as &quot;Internet ONLY&quot; or words to that effect. Note I'm not picking on
&gt;&gt;Circuit City, just using them as an example. -Dave

&gt; Does the web site even admit that there *IS* a store by the name
&gt; of &quot;Circuit City&quot;? If they've got a store locator on the web site,
&gt; that ties them together, but it still doesn't say they have the
&gt; same product lines. If it talks about ordering stuff on the web
&gt; site and picking it up at a store, THEN maybe it makes sense to
&gt; assume that it's the same products unless it says &quot;Internet ONLY&quot;.
&gt; But I still wouldn't assume the prices are the same.

"/> You used a really poor example to rant about, since at Circuit
City's website you can select up to 3 B&amp;M locations in your
profile and they show you on the product page whether the item
is in stock at those stores. They also have a pricing policy
that says that if their in-store price when you go to pick the
item up is cheaper, they automatically refund the difference. So
you get the cheaper price, no matter which one it is. And no, I
do not work for CC.

I don't mourn for Alexander's department store (now out of business)
because they had similar problems:
lack of staff causing out-of-stock conditions on the selling floor.

As to in-store merchandise vs. &quot;internet only&quot;,
I fear that's mostly test-marketing and teasing us.

For example: WalMart sells nice animal-paw shaped slippers
that I want to buy as gifts.
They're in the store only for Christmas,
but they're NOT on the internet site AT ALL.
Yea, how dare they sell them at other times!
Or get a clue that there's a high demand for the larger sizes.
But the web site sells Linux PCs that are NOT in any stores!

I found Ikea's web site as useless as their store-maze.
Many items have the same SKU (item number)
making it impossible to order online
(not that they're listed in the catalogue or web site anyway).

I dislike the artifical distinction between web site and store offerings.

"/> Wow, I have not seen a discussion of Alexander's on the Internet
in, well, I guess ever. My mother used to work there. I think
the problem with their stock wasn't that it wasn't on the floor
-- it was just that everything was thrown around and you
couldn't find it under the pile of crap.

&gt;Over many years now, I've been complaining about how frustrating it is to
&gt;try to buy ANYTHING I want in a retail store. Most of the time, I find
&gt;whatever I'm looking for is sold out, or they don't carry it. I may be
&gt;slow, but I finally noticed a pattern. It goes like this. I've done my
&gt;research carefully to figure out what I want to buy. I want widget X. I
&gt;pull up the web sites of various stores like CompUSA, Best Buy, Circuit
&gt;City, etc. and see who carries it. Now I really want widget X quickly, so I
&gt;go to the local store to buy it. When I get there, widget X is sold out, or
&gt;&quot;Internet Only&quot; (when the web site doesn't specify &quot;Internet Only&quot;). But
&gt;they have gobs of widget Y on hand. Widget Y is invariably less useful
&gt;(worse specifications) AND a lot more expensive than widget X.

"/> I guess you can add Home Despot to the list.

I went in looking for a specific type of hollow wall anchor that they
list on their web site:

Now, I may have missed it, but I didn't see the words &quot;Internet Only&quot;
anywhere on that web page. It even says &quot;STORE SKU&quot; on the page.
However, when I went into a Home Despot to pick up a pack of them, the
store employee said he didn't carry them. He looked up the SKU on his
computer and said &quot;that's an invalid SKU.&quot; He even checked several
other nearby stores and told me none of them had it, either.

Of course, this store DID have plenty of plain old toggle bolts on the
pegs.

I think you may be onto something...
