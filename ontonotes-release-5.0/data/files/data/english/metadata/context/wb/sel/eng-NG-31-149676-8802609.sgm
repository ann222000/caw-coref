Dear friends, family, and scattered acquaintances,

I realize it's been a while since I last wrote y'all.  Sorry about that.  I don't really have any great excuse except that I just haven't felt like typing so much lately.

Part of it was the backlog--I got so far behind in doing daily updates during the course of my time at the English/Theater camp that it seemed like a ludicrous task to try to catch up.  And then when I didn't get going after that, the backlog just became larger and larger.

The other part, though, is that I simply am losing interest in cataloging the days when I don't do anything new.  Part of the reason for writing such massive missives was to help organize my thoughts about all of the weird stuff happening around me while I tried to acclimate to Thai culture.  Now, though, while I'm by no means fully integrated into Thai society, there just aren't nearly as many moments of complete culture shock.

And so I've come to a decision: I will still try to write home with something resembling regularity, but I'm not going to write about every single day anymore.  Instead, I'll focus on writing about just the things that seem interesting and new.  Since &quot;interesting and new&quot; don't keep the most regular schedule, I'll probably also start to stray from this idea of a weekly scheduled update.

Changes

So what all have I been up to in the past few weeks, since I came back from the English/Theater camp and later marriage ceremony (both of which deserve to be written up in their own right one of these days)?

As you may recall, before my trip, I made arrangements with the Rong Nyoke for him to start taking me around to meet the community's occupational groups upon my return.  These visits were basically supposed to happen on Wednesday and Thursday mornings throughout September, and my understanding was that we would be meeting non-farming groups.  (It's not that I have anything against farming; I just don't have a whole lot of hope that I can teach a farming group anything.  Besides, it's far funner simply to bike around the back roads trying to meet the farmers separately and informally.)

Upon further review of the list of groups the Rong Nyoke had marked off for me to see, only 2 out of the 9 were actually unrelated to farming; the other seven involve some variation on either fertilizer production or farming efficiency.  With the farming efficiency groups especially, I suspect that the groups were actually formed just so that the farmers could collectively ask for funding assistance, and that they have done nothing much as a group since receiving the funding.

Such suspicions are relatively unfounded, because I've not actually talked with the members of these groups.  In fact, out of six mornings set aside for visiting groups, the Rong Nyoke and I have actually gone out just once, on the first scheduled day.  Since then, the groups have either cancelled or else the Rong Nyoke has been too busy to go; possibly both.  It's a minor improvement to know where two more groups are based, but the emphasis for me is on &quot;minor.&quot;  It's possibly even been a bit of a step backwards, since I've spent several sunshiney days sitting around the AwBawTaw waiting to go out when I would have otherwise hopped on my bike and gone people-hunting.

The visits that we actually made weren't all that terribly exciting, but I honestly had never really expected them to be.  The point of these excursions was simply to find out where the groups meet so that I can go back to see them later on and spend time actually building relationships with them.  Still, I think I was hoping for at least a little bit more out of the visits.

The first place we went was to the straw hat-making group.  They hadn't actually been making hats for several weeks when we stopped by; apparently they had been busy harvesting lamyai fruit.  Then it came out that they were also being kept from their work by a lack of some kind of machine involved in preparing their supplies.  They were telling all of this to the Rong Nyoke for him to share with me, and so the one positive outcome of the meeting was that he heard about their problem and promised to help them get the machine soon.  They also gave me a free hat, which is perfectly nice aside from the small detail that my head is too large for a lot of western sizes, let alone Thai sizing.  Maybe I'll see if I can commission a properly fitting one when I go back to see them in the future.

The other group we visited makes fertilizer, apparently by composting plant stalks.  Since the plants are still alive just now, the group can't exactly use them yet.  I was more or less told to come back for a day sometime in November to learn about their process.  It's exceedingly unlikely that I'll be able to help the group, but at least I'll learn something along the way.  And who knows--maybe they actually do have an issue I can help out with (beyond the Rong Nyoke promising that I would help them make a website--I'm not even sure I know what point he has in mind with that).

The end result of my disappointment with the groups is that I'm planning to start dramatically scaling back my time at the AwBawTaw in the near future.  The schools are going on semester break soon, so there's little reason why I can't just go spend the entirety of my days meandering around and talking to folks.  Okay, so there's the fact that most of the people here over the age of 35 speak a dialect (or two) that I can't really understand, but that's just a problematic detail, not an excursion-halting reason.

The beauty of doing this AwBawTaw independence thing now is that my official site visit is coming up.  If the folks at the AwBawTaw are upset about my absence, they'll have an opportunity to talk about it to my program manager.  My program manager, in return, will have the opportunity to explain to them that my job is not to sit around the AwBawTaw bored all day, and that it's disappointing I have to spend so much time randomly exploring instead of being properly introduced to the groups.

Of course, given the nonconfontational nature of Thais, it might very well never come up.  We'll see.

Meanwhile, classes at the schools have been going reasonably well.  The classes are working on creating powerpoint presentations about themselves this week, and next week will be a final review of everything and a time for sharing the presentations.  After that, the schools go on break for most of October.

After having been forced down the schools' collective throats at first, I'm trying for a new tactic for when the schools resume in November.  Namely, I've told all of the teachers (and the Rong Nyoke) that I have no other lessons planned, but will be happy to help out with computer-related projects of THEIR own planning.  I like working with the kids and the technology, but it's high time for the teachers to take a more interactive role in the lessons, and this is the best way I could think of to force the issue.

I'm not completely abdicated the role as lesson-planner here.  I actually wrote up a page-long proposal for the Rong Nyoke about several different project ideas that we could do at the schools.  These proposals, however, are a bit more complicated than I can really explain in Thai, let alone actually writing them out.  Thus, I've had to instruct all of the teachers to talk to the Rong Nyoke if they're interested in having me return after the break.  Hopefully he'll be able to translate out the possibilities to them.

A side-effect of all of this is that I'm starting to feel more uncertain about my work here again.  I have no grand illusions that my computer teaching was dramatically changing the students' lives, but at least it was something to do.  Soon my schedule will be completely up in the air again, and I will have no idea how long it will be until I next attach on to doing something marginally useful.  I don't like that kind of uncertainty.

&quot;Sightseeing&quot;

For the past couple of weekends, I've managed to take some almost touristy trips around my region.  On the 16th, I rode my bike out to Thoeng (the place 20 kilometers away) again.  I was hoping to get some more of the fabulous salad from the market, but apparently missed my opportunity there when I arrived in the late afternoon.  Instead, though, I was able to buy grapes for the first time in months.  I felt that was a fair trade-off.

The touristy bit happened as I was leaving the market.  I happened to look up at just the right time and saw that there's a giant Buddha statue on one of the nearby hillsides.  Timing is everything, I discovered as I set out in search of a road up to the statue.  Unlike westerners would be, the Thais are perfectly happy to let the trees grow up in front of the Buddha to such extent that there's only a narrow slice of town from which you can even see the statue.  It was only by pure chance that I happened to look up from the right place and notice the thing.

I was eventually able to find a road up to the Buddha, but I quickly gave up on trying to ride my bike up it.  For one thing, a pair of dogs got all antsy at me as I was passing by, so I had to give up my momentum in order to stop and defend myself from bites.  For another thing, the road was about a mile long, and maintained a not-insignificant grade the whole way.  Even if the dogs hadn't forced me to start walking early on, I probably would have had to give up on biking it sooner or later.

When I got to the statue, I stopped and took a couple of pictures to share with you its size, as well as a couple of shots to demonstrate the view-limiting factor of the trees.  Then, having decided that I had pushed my bike far enough already, I parked it and walked another few hundred meters up the road to see where it ended up going after the statue.

The answer was a hilltop parking lot attached to a wat and a fabulous view of the farmland to the northwest.  I quickly decided that if I ever get any visitors, I'm totally going to insist that we come up to check this out; it was terrific.  Unfortunately, it was also slightly hazy (the rain is diminishing lately, and I think folks are starting to burn things again) and nearing sunset, so my pictures don't really do the view justice.  Nor can my mere words properly describe how wondrous it was to stand on the hillside and see the endless fields of rice stretching out into the distance below.

I guess you'll just have to come see it for yourselves.

Unfortunately, I dallied a bit too long on the hillside, and so I ended up heading home a little later than I thought I should in order to get back by sunset.  As it turns out, the sunset was actually much earlier than I had even suspected (when the days stay so hot, you forget about the sun going toward the other side of the equator), so I ended up biking half of the return trip in the dark.  I have lights attached to my bicycle, but they don't really provide illumination so much as alert others to my presence so that motorists don't run into me.  These lights also serve quite nicely as a beacon for mosquito suicide squads and dogs that can't stand being passed by a bycicle at night.

Yeah, that was a long ride home.  The view was still totally worth it, though.

So that was two weekends ago.  Then last Saturday, I took a bus trip up to Mae Sai, a town in Chiang Rai at the border with Burma.  Everyone who I've asked about DVDs in my area has told me that it's possible to buy cheap DVDs on the Thai side of the border, but even cheaper on the Burmese side.  Since I can't cross to the Burmese side just now (there's a special form volunteers have to fill out for Thai re-entry), I largely ignored this until one of the other volunteers told me how easy it is to get to Mae Sai from Chiang Rai city.  I was actually able to get there and back as a simple day trip.

The first thing I noticed about Mae Sai was that it's bus station was miles from anywhere interesting.  The main mode of transportation from there into town are song-taews advertising that they'll take you to the customs house at the border.  Since I really didn't want to find myself accidentally crossing the border somehow (I didn't even have my passport on me), I spent several minutes assessing my (non-existant) options long and hard before deciding that I actually didn't have any choice but to hop in a song-taew and trust that everything would work out.

And it did.  A market lines the road for maybe a kilometer from the customs house, and the song-taew driver stopped (for unknown reasons) a few hundred meters from the building.  I got out and asked where I could buy DVDs, and he pointed vaguely in the direction of the market, so I handed over the 8 baht for the trip and went on my way.

One thing that bothers me about this is that I still don't know where the actual border is.  I assume it was represented by the customs house itself, which is quite sizeable and stradles the road.  But there seemed to be little to force foot traffic past border agents or whatever, so it's hard for me to know for sure.  It might be that such a U.S.-style official gate is undesired here because Thai citizens are free to cross the border even more easily than Americans used to be able to cross back and forth with Canada.  Or it's possible that I stopped miles and miles from wherever the border actually is.

Either way, the market on the Thai side was plenty interesting.  Unlike most markets I report on, however, the interest here was less about the ethnic crafts that were available than about the western goods on sale.  To take a random example, it's hard to know for sure whether the Hugo Boss wallets I saw on sale were complete knock-offs (which they probably were, albeit convincing ones) or simply extra products that were made in the region for export to the West.

Meanwhile, one store had a few products that were distinctly foreign.  I was able to buy about a pound of Sun-Maid raisins for 120 baht, and a variety pack of Van Houten chocolate bars for 50 baht.  I don't know about the chocolate bars, but the price on the raisins (especially for non-local ones) was quite good.  Really, though, it was incredible to me that they were even on sale.  I'll probably end up going back up to Mae Sai some time just to spend more time exploring the non-Thai goods.

As for my original purchase, the DVD hunt did not go well.  Try as I might, I was unable to find a familiar gray-market booth full of potential titles to be burned on demand.  Instead, I kept getting pointed to individuals who were discretely trying to sell off movies that they would pull from opaque plastic bags.  These movies were generally Thai films, so that was a no-go for me.  Nor do I see why anyone else would buy them, when most Thais would be able to buy a better selection from a VCD vendor or else cross the border and get cheap films from Burma.

At one point, I tried just telling one of the vendors that I was looking for the Heroes DVDs (I still haven't had a chance to go to a major city since the full season was released), and I ended up being jerked around.  First he tried giving me I-don't-know-what, labeled Disc 1 and Disc 2, and then when I made a point of writing out what I was looking for and he understood it was a television show, he disappeared for 10 minutes and then came back with a dozen discs stuffed into a plain plastic sleave, with the series name misspelled in marker.

Yeah; right.

In the meantime, his associates (ranging from 10-years-old through maybe late-20s) insisted that I stand still and wait.  And while I was waiting, they kept trying to sell me pornography and viagra (which the kid pronounced vee-uh-GRA, to much confusion on my part).  If it weren't so sad that this is how these kids are spending their time, I probably would have been outright offended.  The better target for my dismay, though, would be the other farang who consider southeast Asia a destination just for sex tourism.

See, this is why it's wise to try to look extra-respectable in Thailand whenever around people who might even be acquainted with the folks with whom you intend to work.

Once I realized that I wasn't going to be able to buy my desired DVDs in Mae Sai after all, I set off for home.  I hit Chiang Rai with enough time before my next bus that I was able to buy some basic groceries (cereal and bread) and a Swenson's ice cream cone before leaving town.

All in all, it was a pretty good trip.

&quot;The Local Orphanage&quot;

You may recall, I met a missionary way back in April, when I went to a local church for Easter.  As it turns out, Carol is helping out at a local (generally Thai-run and Thai-supported) orphanage.  The orphanage director suggested last month that I should come over and check it out, and I finally managed to visit it (with the other local PC volunteer) last Friday.

As far as the grounds go, the orphanage is downright impressive.  They have fish farms, a frog farm, chickens, rubber trees, fruit trees, hardwood trees and more all growing within a relatively limited space.  It reminded me of visiting the King's Agricultural Projects during training, except that this placed actually seemed more impressive for its relative density.  It gets even more points in my reckoning, since it's basically managed by a couple of Thai men, with only limited chores-level help from the orphans.

The buildings themselves were also fairly nice.  They're hardly state-of-the-art, but they're clearly well-maintained, and far better than I expected to see.  In addition to the standard dormitories, kitchen, offices and chapel (the place is supported by the Thai church after all), the orphanage also has a relatively decent library that's open to the public.  It's not a huge facility, but it's head and shoulders above the libraries at the schools where I teach.

We were not able to meet the orphans themselves (since we were visiting in the middle of the day on a Friday), but we got some basic information about them.  The orphanage was started about 10 years ago in support of children who lost their parents to the AIDS epidemic, and those kids are now in the equivolent of 11th grade in high school.  More recent arrivals are more due to family problems than disease, and the current population is of 26 kids, ranging from age 4 to 18 and split almost evenly across gender.

The children mostly go to local schools, but the orphanage tries to provide extra education for them as well.  Since the kids didn't come from the best of backgrounds, they need an extra boost to bring them up to speed academically.  If the logistics can be worked out, I might actually lend a hand to help the highschoolers learn how to make a proper powerpoint presentation (which, surprisingly, is apparently a regular homework assignment for them).

On the other end of the age spectrum, the orphanage is currently building a preschool for their local community.  My general impression is that they're unimpressed with the current government-provided options, but rather than focus just on their own kids, they're trying to make a place that can be used by everyone in the area.  It seems like that has to be something a little more complicated than they're making it out to be, but at first blush the building itself looks like it will be quite nice.

On the way home, the missionary drove me through town and showed me a store that sells pre-packaged frozen meats.  They don't offer hamburgers, alas, but I was able to buy some ground pork to toss into my spaghetti sauce, as well as some chicken pieces that I look forward to baking myself instead of constantly eating reheated chicken from the local stand.

Now if only the local Tesco-Lotus would finish being built, I could really up the quality of my self-prepared meals....

Anyway, that's pretty much all I have to write about for now.  I'm thinking back for anything else mention-worthy from the past few weeks, and the best I can come up with was the purchase of a Thai-translation of &quot;James and the Giant Peach,&quot; which I hope to use to improve my reading skills and general knowledge of the language.  But so far, I've not read much of it, so that's all the more mention the purchase really needs.

Thus, I'm wrapped up for the past few weeks.  Some day I'll get around to telling y'all about the English/Theater camp and the wedding I attended, but for now you'll just have to wait.  You're welcome to pass the time by sending updates of your own in my direction.
