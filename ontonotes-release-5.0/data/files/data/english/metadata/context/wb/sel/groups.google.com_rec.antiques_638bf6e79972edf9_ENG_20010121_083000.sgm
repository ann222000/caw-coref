FIRST CALL FOR VOTES (of 2)
unmoderated group misc.business.online-auctions.discuss

Newsgroups line:
misc.business.online-auctions.discuss Discussion of online auctions&amp;services.

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, 12 Feb 2001.

This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party. Questions
about the proposed group should be directed to the proponent.

Proponent: J.J. Pearce &lt;nitega ... @mindspring.com&gt;
Votetaker: Dave Cornejo &lt;d ... @dogwood.com&gt;

RATIONALE: misc.business.online-auctions.discuss

There are literally millions of online auctions running daily.
Discussion of these auctions and the services that provide them has
been shown to be desirable in the current alt.* Usenet group devoted
to the subject. However, this group is not sufficient; though it now
receives 200-250 posts per day and has a good signal to noise ratio,
it suffers from lack of propagation. This is due in part to rmgroup
messages sent shortly after its creation, reasons for which include
that the group does &quot;not meet current standards for alt group
creation&quot;.

Public web-based message boards for this subject do exist but finding
freedom of expression in such forums is difficult at best. These sites
are most often owned and operated by commercial auction-related
companies, who discourage any mention of their competition. Permission
to post or even discuss this RFD was denied by the board of one major
auction company.

Discussion in the aforementioned alt.* group suggests that a move to
the Big 8, to increase availability and lessen such restrictions,
would be useful and welcome.

CHARTER: misc.business.online-auctions.discuss

The newsgroup will be unmoderated and open to the discussion of all
topics directly related to online auctioning, such as:

-general information about auction methods
-seller/buyer tips and advice
-online payment services
-delivery &amp; packaging methods
-auction software &amp; services
-sales policies
-scam/con warnings

Commercial messages are inappropiate and unwelcome in this group.
This includes, but is not limited to, pointers to personal online
auctions and/or web sites with the intent to increase bidding.
Unwelcome commercial messages also include posts that attempt to
garner business for auctions services, payment services, and related
companies. Articles should be posted in plain text.

Also inappropiate in this newsgroup are excessively crossposted or
multiply posted messages (aka &quot;spam&quot;), as well as binaries (e.g.
pictures, compressed files, etc.), except for cryptographic signatures
(e.g. PGP). Those using misc.business.online-auctions.discuss are
asked to keep their messages on-topic and of interest to the majority
of the people reading the newsgroup. Flaming and blatantly offensive
language are discouraged in this group.

END CHARTER.

HOW TO VOTE:

Follow these instructions *exactly*! Votes are counted by computer.
You should send E-MAIL (posts to a newsgroup are invalid) to:

v ... @dogwood.com

Please do not assume that just replying to this message will work.
Check the address before you mail your vote. Your mail message
should contain one and only one of the following vote statements:

I vote YES on misc.business.online-auctions.discuss
I vote NO on misc.business.online-auctions.discuss

Voter name:

If your mail software does not indicate your real name (for example,
AOL does not), include _exactly_ the statement above on a _separate_
line and add your name after the colon. Having your name in your
signature line is NOT enough! Do NOT join the lines together or
remove the words &quot;Voter name&quot;!

You may also vote ABSTAIN (which records an empty vote) or CANCEL
(which removes any earlier votes). ABSTAIN does not affect the final
vote count in any way but is listed, whereas CANCEL is not.

IMPORTANT VOTING PROCEDURE NOTES:

Standard Guidelines for voting apply. One vote per person, one
account per voter. Votes must be mailed directly from the voter to
the votetaker. Anonymous, forwarded or proxy votes are not valid.
Votes mailed by WWW/HTML/CGI forms are considered to be anonymous
votes. Votes from non-existent email addresses are not valid.

Vote counting is automated. Failure to follow these directions may
mean that your vote does not get counted. If you do not receive an
acknowledgment of your vote within three days contact the votetaker
about the problem. It's your responsibility to make sure your vote is
registered correctly. Duplicate votes are resolved in favor of the
most recent valid vote. Addresses, names and votes of all voters will
be published in the final voting results post.

The purpose of a Usenet vote is to determine the genuine interest of
persons who would read a proposed newsgroup. Soliciting votes from
disinterested parties defeats this purpose. Please do not distribute
this CFV. If you must, direct people to the official CFV as posted to
news.announce.newgroups. Distributing pre-marked or otherwise edited
copies of this CFV is generally considered to be vote fraud. When in
doubt, ask the votetaker.

"/> The idea is to prevent creation of &quot;Big 8&quot; groups for topics that have
little interest, IOW, to avoid creating empty groups. In *theory*, getting
only 86 votes means there aren't enough people who want to discuss online
auctions to justify a &quot;Big 8&quot; group.

&gt; I think a better rule would be &quot;regular participants only
&gt; may vote&quot; - I don't EVEN recognize anyone on the
&gt;&quot;NO&quot; list (unless they're the &quot;anons&quot;).

"/>&quot;NO&quot; votes tend to be technical objections from news administrators and
other people interested in newsgroup creation generally, or who have some
other procedural complaint. (Some people vote NO just because they think
the 100 vote margin is too low, so they want to make it tougher.) Twenty NO
votes is pretty standard; it doesn't indicate a problem with the proposal.

It's a weird voting procedure, because &quot;yes&quot; is not the opposite of &quot;no&quot;.
YES means &quot;I'll read this group if it is created&quot;; NO means &quot;There's
something technically wrong with this proposal.&quot;

"/> Followups were set to news.groups, but I don't post to newsgroups I
don't read (longstanding policy).

I didn't vote for m.b.o-a.d because I thought misc.business was precisely
the wrong hierarchy for yet another discussion forum featuring amateur
sellers. The cold plain hard truth is that of the people participating
in the existing forums (boards on yaBe, AuctionWatch, Honesty, etc. and
the alt group whose full name I can't be bothered to quote) at MOST 2%
of those people are actually running businesses. I know, I've been to all.
98% have no more idea how to run a yaBe business (and are distinctly
uninterested in treating it as a *business*) than my mother has the
ability to code in C.

The existing boards are dominated by personalities who are supremely
unqualified to state informed opinions on auction selling because they
spend so much of their time online yakking.

No brag, just fact: I left behind a six-figure salary because I believed
the yaBe selling model could scale into serious money for a company that
could keep labor costs down by automating as many auction processes
as possible. I still believe this and am on the verge of committing
my life savings to this venture. I work 14 hours a day, seven days a
week, and I love it. I don't think there is anything as satisfying
as working for yourself.

So, no, I'm not interested in more wailing about the evils of Buy It Now
(&quot;what if I price the item too LOW?&quot;) or whether or not you should neg
someone for sending rude e-mail. A misc.business group devoted to the
*business* of online auctions would be just my cup of chai. I hope someone
proposes one.

"/>  It's been that way for years, and frankly, if you can't get 100 more
yesses then there isn't enough interest. Alt.* groups, on the other hand,
don't need a vote and can be created with the help of your ISP if they
know how to do it. I do recommend a discussion of even an alt.* group
creation on alt.config, though.

"/>  Some of them are alt.config regulars who have dealt with the formation
of the new groups for years. They are, admittedly, an uppity bunch of
bastards because they feel no new groups should be formed. In this case,
I imagine they thought there was a perfectly good group already and a new
one would be superfluous.
And, quite frankly, the extra 1-2 &quot;spams&quot; (which they're not, they're
ads, and there is a HUGE difference) which this group gets and which get
complained about are not enough to go running to a new group. True spam,
the kind which gets posted to hundreds of groups, go to every group that
exists on Usenet. If you're worried about the &quot;FA&quot; posts, then you need
to change the charter and perhaps the FAQ. alt.config might actually help
you do that, but right now, people who post &quot;FA&quot; posts are doing the same
they would do in, say, comp.sys.amiga.marketplace and rec.collecting.coins
for example.
A good idea might be to create a FAQ if one doesn't already exist, put
in the foreward of the FAQ &quot;No ads!&quot;, and post it every few days. If
someone posts an ad, refer them to the FAQ. If they post another ad, then
consider complaining to their ISP.
Usenet is a place for everyone, not just for the regulars in a group. If
you want to see how horrible a group can become when a handful of regulars
think they literally &quot;own&quot; the group, go to alt.folklore.urban and see for
yourself. It's a perfect example of why Usenet votes, creations, etc. are
done with everyone in mind, not just the self-appointed &quot;regulars&quot;. And
the work going into figuring out who is a regular and who isn't would be
enormous.

"/> Judging from my emails, I guess my comment about &quot;regulars&quot;
has been wildly misinterpreted.

I didn't mean that there was (or should be) any sort of
formal criteria; I'm defining regulars as those who *contribute*
to the newsgroup. Not the spammers. Not the flamers.
But the folks who do like to engage in serious (or semi-
serious) discussion.

And no, I don't have tickmarks on my wall ;)

lurkers, who fail to understand that it is only the participants who
keep ngs alive, and from the newsgroupies, who ask justifiably how can
you ascertain who qualifies as a regular - or more to the point, how a
votetaker could ascertain who is a regular.

&gt; Neither do I, really. I think it has something to do with measuring
&gt; how many people will actually use the group (and I could be wrong,
&gt; Gillam will correct me, I hope). I think that's a fallacy though;
&gt; I suspect that a lot of people would find the group, but didn't
&gt; vote.

"/> It's a matter of simplicity to figure out the groups average traffic.
This group more than qualifies. The vote process is hampered by the fact
people come and go to ngs - and whilst this sustains high traffic, it
means most people don't consider themselves long term enough to vote.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; may vote&quot; - I don't EVEN recognize anyone on the
&gt;&gt;&quot;NO&quot; list (unless they're the &quot;anons&quot;).

&gt; A few of them are news.groups regulars. I recall that at least two of
&gt; them were unhappy that the group wouldn't be moderated -- they seemed
&gt; to feel that we wanted to have our cake (unmoderation) and eat it too
&gt; (using &quot;.discuss&quot; to cut down on spam).

"/> Personally, I think newsgroupies shouldn't be voting unless they
participate in the group and understand the dynamics. They do vote, and
they bring all their personal prejudices to the vote with no
consideration of what the people who actually use the group want.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But the &quot;no&quot; votes were not the problem.

"/> In one way they were - if they'd been yes votes, it would've passed. And
if those people were not group users, then you could say it failed on
the say-so of non-users. Some people (read me) didn't vote because they
felt that what the group wanted was more important than what they
wanted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; AAMOF, I probably wouldn't
&gt; change anything about the proposal itself, including the name. The
&gt; problem is that we didn't generate enough interest, and I blame
&gt; myself for that.

"/> Don't - the fault lies with the system. People don't vote in high
numbers, period - the system should allow for that, look at the average
number of posts and take it on a straight vote that excludes the
newsgroupies.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The thing is, I'm not sure how else to /get/ people
&gt; interested enough to vote.

"/> This begs the question if they are not interested, should they be
encouraged to vote? I'd rather lose to people who cared than I would to
a bunch of warm bodies voting any which way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I couldn't find any big mailing lists to
&gt; discuss it on. A central web site is a news.groups no-no, the theory
&gt; being that people who read the web aren't likely to read news so they
&gt; shouldn't vote. Information in .sig files is fine, except that few
&gt; people really read them. I'm just not sure what else I should have
&gt; done. *Sigh*

"/> Nor me. Heated discussion will generate the most attention, but that
will only work in the short term and the whole process is so protracted
people just tune it out.

The blunt and sad truth is, and I've seen this done, is for ten
interested people to get ten friends each to vote their way.... Until
newsgroupies wake up and get themselves a system that works for the
users and not for a few geeks to play power games.

&gt; How so? A typical lurker can stand on the side through a dozen theads simply
