I added a line (_p('share/trac/htdocs/js/yui'), glob(_p('htdocs/js/yui/
*'))), in the setup.py of Trac 0.10.4, but when I run python setup.py
install, it said /htdocs/js/yui doesn`t exist or not a regular file.

What`s more, I even tried to develop a plugin with the Yahoo UI
library by adding package_data={'resource_usage': ['htdocs/js/yui',
'js/yui/*']}, it still gave the error information.

And I noticed that TinyMCE plugin maintained in Trac Hack also could
not auto-install the 3rd javascript library tinymce into /usr/share/
trac/js/*, but manual-install the tarball.

So is there some way to auto-install 3rd javascript library, please
someone give me advice, thanks a lot!

My advice is to ask your questions on the trac-users list rather than
trac-dev. trac-dev is only meant for Trac developers.

Cheers,

You don't &quot;install&quot; plugin data files anywhere. We use the pkg_resources
API from setuptools to just bundle the data files in the egg itself. I'm
also not sure why you would try to localize the filenames. Just include
the package data files the way other plugins do, and then implement
ITemplateProvider.
