We thought this Snuggle Sack would be a nice warm hut for our lovebird
George but this morning I came in and found him in there and he was
struggling and couldn't come out. His leg was caught in some fleece and
threads inside and he was freaking out and fighting it furiously. I had to
take down the snuggle sack from inside the cage with him in it, and he was
panicking and bit me so hard that I had to put a band aid on my finger
because the bleeding wouldn't stop.

I managed to get him outside of the hole with his banded leg still caught
in the threads inside, and had to use a scissor to cut him free, while he
was freaking out and biting me.

He's shaken up by this, and so am I! If I hadn't found him, he might have
been stuck in there all day and maybe died from it.

I now think this is a dangerous product for birds and shouldn't be sold.

I was complaining because one of them fell apart while still new, so
kiss my ass.

He isn't capable. When the house started dropping down to 60 at night in
the fall, he wasn't able to sleep and was on his perch shivering and
sqwawking some. That was when we got him the happy hut, which helped
some. But it occurred to me that something that was warm and enclosed
would help even more.

Why are you letting the temperature drop so low? Can't you put the
thermostat up a notch or two?  If you haven't already noticed, we're in
the middle of winter where most of the U.S. and Canada has been in a
deep freeze for weeks on end.  If I knew my birds were sitting in their
cages shivering and uncomfortable, that's what I'd do instead of letting
them freeze their butts off.

Can't you put a desk lamp with a low wattage bulb on top of his cage,
near a top perch, so he can huddle under it if necessary?    Or close
him in a room with a radiant heater set on low if you think he needs
more warmth?   Or cover his cage to keep some of the warmth in?
Frankly I think he'd be fine in a 60* room.  If he puffs up it's to
allow for more insulation.  If you notice backyard birds in the below
freezing temps of wintertime, they are also puffed up; it's how they
maximize their downy feathers.

Low income.

If it gets down below about 20 degrees outside, not only does that dry
the hell out of the house, but it becomes real expensive real fast.

We turn it up to 63 in the daytime, and if the sun is out and the temps
aren't too low, it gets up to 66 or so, like it did today. But when we
sleep at night, we cut it back to 60. The lovebird seems to feel the
cold the most, so he goes in the happy hut ( the one that didn't fall
apart when still new ). The budgie doesn't seem affected at all by it
and she sleeps out on the perch all the time, even though she has a
happy hut.

But I also put a 60 watt reptile black heat lamp on the outside of the
cage with a cone style drop-light socket facing down, above the
lovebird's happy hut, and turn it on at night. He seems to like that
too, it warms the happy hut up some.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh horrors, I don't use my real name when posting. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wait...neither do you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, I do so quite often. A simple read through of this thread
&gt;&gt;&gt; gives my name and a simple Google search of my email provides
&gt;&gt;&gt; additional information about me. On the other hand, we don't know
&gt;&gt;&gt; if you're Angela Marsh, Melanie Ford, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; devil's_advoc ... @devil.xxx. I know one thing is certain, I'm not
&gt;&gt;&gt; going to Denver anytime soon... what with gun-totin' members of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rainbow Dragon Society running around.

&gt;&gt; A little paranoid, are ya? Liberal?

&gt; Liberal? You betcha, Ms. Bear. And proud of it. Not that there's
&gt; anything wrong with that.

LOL! Course not, comrade.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I do. You and your filthy sockpuppet pseudonyms are foul and
&gt; &gt;&gt; demented. After that last sockpuppet post of yours, I hope that
&gt; &gt;&gt; folks here will treat you like the flatulent-filled, pustule-ridden
&gt; &gt;&gt; and necrotic skin-bag you really are.

&gt; &gt; LOLOL !!!!  Dave, you are too, too funny.  Talk about creative
&gt; &gt; writing.  Have you thought about writing novels ?!?!     ;0)

&gt; Posting from behind a computer really brings the trolls out of the
&gt; woodwork.

What the hell does that mean ... "posting from behind a computer"?
Don't YOU post behind a computer or do you use some kind of weird voodoo
to get your messages posted?  "Brings the trolls out" ... do you know
the real meaning of "troll"?  I think not.  You are one very strange
person.  Oh, and one last thing ... you should give away your birds to
people who can take care of them.  If you can't keep your poor lovebird
(and most likely your budgie as well) from shivering in its cage at
night because your house is freezing cold, do it a favour and find it a
new home where it can live a comfortable and safe life.

&gt; Somehow, Linda, I get the impression that we're dealing with a female Ted
&gt; Kaczynski, hunkering down in a shack somewhere outside Denver waiting for
&gt; the right moment to put on her gi and hunt down all the trolls.

I think you're right, Jerry.  LOL !  Are trolls tastier than possum?

Hell, the last time some one posted a pic or the link to the pic of a
scarlet macaw sitting on some ones woody(all you old timers know which pic
I'm refering too) didn't generate this much hoopla!
