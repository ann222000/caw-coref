The sign on the bathroom door read ABSOLUTELY NO MEN IN THE WOMEN'S
RESTROOM. Cydné Kimbrough couldn't believe her eyes. Wanting to
believe the best, she carefully peeled away the Scotch tape from the
corners and brought the sign to the front desk at Health Education
Resource Organization Inc. (HERO). The receptionist told her what she
didn't want to hear: The warning was probably meant for transwomen
using the women's bathroom.

"I thought, Does that mean me?" Kimbrough says a year later. She's
sipping hot tea at City Café, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans. Her
round, dark face is flawless, her hair perfectly coiffed.

Since August 2005, she had been working at HERO as the coordinator of
the AIDS service organization's transgender program. Her job was to
encourage African-American transwomen--some of whom were sex workers--
to take advantage of the center's services. And she was successful.
Her clients felt safe divulging personal information to Kimbrough,
who could understand where they were coming from.

But she says there were warning signs that HERO didn't really
appreciate the special needs of the transwomen community.

"My office was on a main corridor, so I felt like I was on display,
and I felt like my clients were on display," Kimbrough says. Not only
did she feel like a dog and pony show, but Kimbrough and her clients
had no privacy for assessments; she often asked to use her
supervisor's office.

After requesting for clarification about the bathrooms, Kimbrough
says she feels that her concerns were not properly addressed. She was
fired last fall in a dramatic episode of he-said, she-said, including
an accusation that she assaulted another HERO employee. (She
adamantly denies that this happened.)

Dr. Leonardo R. Ortega, HERO's executive director and CEO, would not
speak specifically about Kimbrough's firing, but in an interview he
says that the staff has received additional sensitivity training
regarding transgender clients and HERO has added gender identity and
expression to its non-discrimination clause. Meanwhile, he has hired
transgender employees and the city of Baltimore selected HERO to
administer its transgender outreach program. Kimbrough filed a
complaint with the Community Relations Committee in Baltimore, and on
March 5, she learned that they found no probable cause for
discrimination. She's appealing the decision.

One thing is clear: Kimbrough felt that HERO had no more
understanding of what it means to be transgender than the general
public--surprising for Baltimore City's oldest and largest community-
based HIV organization. Surprising perhaps, but not all that uncommon.

It was 1994, when I was first introduced to the transcommunity.
Volunteering and then working full-time for a non-profit organization
in Norfolk, Va., I became friends with Raenice, the receptionist, an
African-American transwoman and former sex worker with a gorgeous
husky voice and perfect skin, who had no plans for surgery, and
Jonothan, an African-American transman case worker who, when I met
him, had had "top surgery" to remove his breasts and would eventually
have "bottom surgery" to create a somewhat functioning penis.

Raenice told me stories of fooling johns--how she would fold her
penis down between her legs so that a customer wouldn't notice he was
having sex with a man--and giggled at my shock. I had no idea that
Jonothan was a transman until someone let the cat out of the bag. For
a few days after learning this, I watched him carefully, looking for
some clue that he was a genetic female. He was shorter than the other
men in the office and insisted on wearing a tie to work, but that was
it.

Perhaps it was easier for me to accept Raenice and Jonothan, because
they were completely accepted in the workplace. It was up to me to
conform, not them. Yet, when our brains receive mixed messages--an
Adam's apple and a rope of pearls, or a crew cut and a high voice--it
doesn't always know what to do. Because I respected Rae and Jonothan
as people, I learned to respect their identity, even though it was
different from mine. Turns out they represent only a tiny fraction of
the incredibly diverse transcommunity.

Countless--countless because no one has successfully tallied them
before--people in Baltimore are living life in the hazy middle of
gender, either because they haven't or won't have gender-reassignment
surgery. Many others have staked their claim and risked financial
stability and their health to have the body they believe they should
have been born with.

None of these transwomen and transmen was born with the luxury of the
one absolute that many of us take for granted moment by moment--their
gender identity.

Let's get the definition out of the way first. "Transgender people
are people who are going from column A to column B," says Deborah
Rudacille, author of The Riddle of Gender and former science writer
at Johns Hopkins University.

That's a pretty big tent, and it enfolds female impersonators, cross-
dressers, drag kings, androgynous individuals, queer youth, preop
transsexuals, and those who have had sexual-reassignment surgery.
Transsexuals usually desire to change their bodies--with hormones
and/or surgery--to physically become the opposite gender. Cross-
dressers are not transsexuals. And often drag kings and queens are in
it for the sheer entertainment value. Most transgender people are
born with normal genitals; those who are born with both female and
male genitals are considered intersex and may or may not identify as
transgender.

Got it? Now here's the catch. This is not a medical definition, and
it changes from time to time, person to person. Some transsexuals do
not consider cross-dressers as transgender. Some drag kings are also
transsexual. Some transsexuals are not at all interested in sex-
reassignment surgery.

Owen Smith, 24, dropped his female persona two and a half years ago,
after a serious accident forced him to quit work as an emergency
medical technician. "I was home alone for a long time--all that time
to think," he says from a corner booth at Evergreen Café, Elvis
Costello-like glasses framing his eyes and a baseball cap shoved down
over closely cropped hair. He's genetically female and has no plans
for bottom surgery but is considering top surgery.

But of course this transformation wasn't out of the blue. Smith knew
at a very young age that, despite his female body, he was not a girl.
He grew up in Milwaukee, attended Catholic schools, and came to
Baltimore in 2000 to attend Maryland Institute College of Art.

"I remember being in kindergarten and telling the person who took me
to Mass that I was going to have a sex change," Smith says. "People
teased me about it." He talked with his mom about it when he was
young and remembers that he realized early that he liked girls.

"I don't remember what happened first, liking girls or wanting to be
trans, a man," he says. But a masculine name doesn't tell the whole
story. "I don't really want to be a man," he says. "I'm comfortable
with the gray area. I believe in transcending gender. And I'm
comfortable with my parts--except my breasts."

Like many young transpeople, Smith considers himself gender queer--
neither male nor female--and perfectly happy living without strict
gender labels.

If that's not complicated enough, there's the whole sexuality piece.
Perhaps the most misunderstood fact about transwomen and transmen is
that their gender identity has nothing to do with their sexuality.
Transgender people identify as gay or straight or bi--regardless of
their sex or gender. This confuses gays and lesbians about as often
as it does straight people.

Kristina identifies as a straight woman, her boyfriend, Zak, as a
bisexual man. They met one another seven years ago, before each of
them transitioned--Kristina from male to female and Zak from female
to male. They've been a couple since soon after they met, negotiating
new gender roles.

"He wants me to be Edith Bunker," Kristina jokes about Zak's
preference for traditional male-female roles. She puffs away on a
cigarette, grins, and tosses her shoulder-length blond hair. Her
voice is husky from smoking.

"It's not so bad," Zak replies. The quiet, almost shy half of the
couple, he takes time answering questions. His hair is short, his
flannel shirt does a good job of concealing his genetic gender, and
he has a very traditionally masculine job doing restoration
work. "I'd work and work and work, because I prefer it that way."

Each of them has a child from previous marriages. Kristina's high
school-age son lives with his mother, though they share custody.
Zak's 11-year-old daughter, Zoila, lives with him part-time.

"I'm attracted to females," Zak explains. "But I'm not attracted to
the same type of females who are attracted to me." As a woman, he
tried lesbian relationships, but something was missing. "I wanted a
more masculine role."

"Sexuality and gender identity are separate issues," says Benita
Paschall, executive director of Baltimore Prevention Coalition. In
2002, Paschall, who is not transgender, received funding from the
Centers for Disease Control Prevention, the federal Center for
Substance Abuse and Prevention, the Baltimore City Health Department,
and the Maryland AIDS Administration to create a project for African-
American transwomen in Baltimore who were at risk for homelessness,
substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS.

Gender is between the ears and sex is between the legs, Paschall
says. "Genitalia does not define gender identity," she
continues. "Genitalia is incidental. I started to say to people, `So
you define me by my vagina?' I have to be more than my vagina."

Through Paschall's program, which included a support group called
TransAm, she got a thorough grounding in how misconceptions about
gender identity can endanger these women. Transwomen are often
required to live as men while in drug-treatment facilities, for
example. Thanks to a devastating cycle of poverty and job
discrimination, many are unemployable and turn to prostitution. Many
take black-market estrogen--a female hormone that reduces hair growth
and can cause transwomen to grow breasts--because they don't have
medical insurance or can't get their insurance to pay for their
treatments. And some are teenagers who have nowhere else to go.

"These teenagers are thrown away--parents are throwing these kids on
the street. We buried one child, and there was no family
participation at all. But they wanted the birth certificate so they
could get the insurance," she scoffs.

TransAm and Paschall helped get hormones for one client who went to
federal prison. And she hired many others to work at Baltimore
Prevention Coalition.

"We were a referral source for them," she says. "We buried them. We
did a lot of things for them. We also integrated them into other
parts of the [Baltimore Prevention Coalition] program" that were not
transgender specific.

What Paschall did most was normalize her transgender clients' lives--
at least within her offices. Cydné Kimbrough became the program's
facilitator in 2002, years before she went to work for HERO.

"I was the most unlikely rescuer," Paschall says. "I'm a Muslim."
Yet, she quotes, "`Oppression is worse than slaughter.' That came
directly from the Quran. I have a responsibility to them. They are my
responsibility."

Funding for the program ran out in 2006, and Paschall has not found
additional monies. "I don't know if I lost my magic touch or if it
was political," she says grimly.

But it's important to note that Paschall's girls were only one
segment of the transgender population in Baltimore. "You're not going
to meet the high-functioning ones, because they have fully
assimilated," she says.

While not many transgender people are living a "stealth" life,
Deborah Rudacille says, for some gender identity is not something
they advertise. "There are plenty of people these days who don't keep
it a secret," she says. "But they're not interested in being a
`professional transsexual.'" In other words, they don't do interviews
with the media or come out to everyone at their jobs. They pass
quietly through life.

"The most classically transgender--those who knew from birth--want to
live their lives as fully in the gender they identify with as they
can," says Dr. Eva Hersh, acting chief medical officer and director
of primary care for Chase Brexton Health Services, the city's gay,
lesbian, bisexual, and transgender medical center. She estimates that
her clinic is currently seeing around 95 transgender patients for
ordinary medical care, hormone treatment, and psychotherapy.

There are "transpeople among you who are completely invisible," she
says. "Either because they want to be or because they can't help it."

Lauren Stokeling, founder of the local support group TransWoman,
which will merge with TransAm in coming months, says she knows many
prominent people in Baltimore who also happen to be transgender. All
of them are private about their gender identity.

For Kimbrough and Stokeling, however, being transgender is as much of
an identity as their sense of womanhood. "My body is a work of art,"
Stokeling says. "If I have surgery, that will not make me any more of
a woman than I am now. I'm not a big advocate for sex-reassignment
surgery. I've lived long enough to know that if people love you, they
love you for who you are, not what you have."

But for those who are not intentionally flying under the radar,
there's pressure in coming out. Kimbrough is dating now, something
she calls "tricky." "It's more than whether he's emotionally
compatible," she says. "It's about whether he is emotionally stable
and can handle it."

More pressure lies in fitting into a society that sometimes
unknowingly dichotomizes gender, excluding those who don't follow the
simple and strict rules: penis = man, vagina = woman.

"I walked past my mother for the first time tonight." Sara Brown, who
is thin and tall in a black turtleneck sweater and long denim skirt,
tosses her straight blond hair over her shoulder.

Charlene's eyes narrow as she leans back in her chair. "What did she
say?"

"She just stared, and I left," Sara replies matter-of-factly.

The lights are dim at the Mount Vernon Stable. An eclectic crowd of
gay men, lesbians, and what seem like traditional families crowd the
small dining room. At the corner booth sit what's left of the
Washington Baltimore Alliance, the oldest transgender organization in
the region. They get together about once a month, some traveling long
distances for a safe night out.

Julie, Charlene, Carole, and Georgia Ann all identify as cross-
dressers. Sara considers herself transgender, though, like many
others, she started out cross-dressing. Charlene and Georgia Ann are
happily married to women. Carole, Julie, and Sara are divorced.

Gender pronouns are not absolute at this gathering. Occasionally,
Georgia Ann calls Carole "he," despite Carole's heavy eye makeup and
tight skirt. But it's clear, when dressed in women's clothes, they
are women, no matter who they are at home or work during the rest of
the week.

Over dinner, the girls catch up--who's drinking and who's not, how
Sara is recovering from her heart attack, Carole's escapades on eBay
restoring her jewelry collection, which was stolen on a trip to a
transgender conference.

"Some baggage handler in Atlanta is enjoying my jewelry," Carole
says. "I'll never fly AirTran again." By the looks of her fingers,
wrists, and neck--all embellished with silver--she's replaced enough
baubles to get dressed up for one evening. From fishnet tights to a
tousled blond wig, Carole--"I paid extra for a vowel"--is decked out
for a night on the town.

"We have life so much better," she jokes. "We can pick whatever hair
we like. We're not limited to the hair on our heads."

That's a good thing for Georgia Ann, who surreptitiously slides a
photo of herself in "male mode" under the table. There's no way
anyone would recognize the bald, ordinary-looking fellow in the photo
as the bawdy brown-wigged lady in a conservative but shapely floral
cotton dress.

"I'm comfortable in either mode," Georgia Ann says. She jokes about
the freedom of being both male and female. "Why not? I'm selfish."
She's been married for 37 years and out to her wife since six months
into the marriage, when her wife unexpectedly came home to retrieve a
forgotten book and found her husband in a dress. "That was more
terrifying than Vietnam," Georgia Ann says. (She is a veteran, as is
Charlene.) But gradually, the two learned how to have a happy
marriage, raise children, and give Georgia Ann space for her cross-
dressing.

Her children are now in their 30s. "They know about it," she
says. "They're comfortable enough to rib me about it."

Still, like most of the other women around the table, Georgia Ann is
not taking any chances with the rest of the world. She won't reveal
her real name and will only say that she is an entrepreneur in West
Virginia. When she goes out, she dresses at Carole's house in
Rockville before heading into Baltimore.

The 32-year-old Washington Baltimore Alliance is dying, these women
say. "Years ago, the transgender and cross-dresser community was not
out of the closet," Georgia Ann says. "So to meet someone without
[using] a computer was very hard. As cross-dressing became more
popular, the community had more connections."

These days, everyone knows what a cross-dresser is, she continues,
even if they are confused with transsexuals. Cross-dressers are
usually heterosexual men who occasionally or frequently dress in
women's clothing or "feminine mode."

Charlene--distinguished in a stylish leather suit and high-heeled
boots--is clear on the differences between transsexuals and cross-
dressers. "They want to be women, we want to wear the clothes."
Reportedly, her shoe collection rivals Imelda Marcos'.

Charlene was 32 and in her first marriage when she first gave cross-
dressing a try. She dressed for four years, and then took a 19-year
hiatus after having two children and then marrying her second wife.

"I thought I had gotten over it," she says.

"You never get over it," Georgia Ann and Julie say in unison and with
flicks of their wrists.

"If I had all the money from all the clothes I dumped in the trash,
we could all go on a trip," Georgia Ann says.

"We call them purges," Julie chimes in. These periodic attempts to
stop cross-dressing are about guilt, the girls say--guilt because
they aren't accepted.

"I was married for almost 18 years, and during that time I suppressed
the urges to dress," Julie says. "I fantasized about dressing and
would wear lingerie mostly at home. My ex-wife didn't know about my
`other world,' even though I hinted at it frequently. In retrospect,
I know that she would never have accepted a nonvanilla lifestyle. I
would dress at home when she was out, but I usually felt guilty about
it. Eventually I purged all of my `girlie' things, but the underlying
desire to explore my femme side was not as easy to purge. We got
divorced, and I moved on with my life and started to explore my femme
side."

Julie dresses three to four times a month, but when she attends
Southern Comfort--an annual national transgender conference--she's
Julie all the time. Carole is different. "I go out in femme mode one
to two times per week," she says, although, "in one form or another,
I dress in femme mode daily."

"For the majority of cross-dressers, this has nothing to do with
sex," Sara says. "Most cross-dressers are totally heterosexual and
don't want to be women."

Sara is not one of those cross-dressers. "I basically live and work
as a male," she says. She drives a delivery truck and lives in
Patterson Park with her brother, nephew, and 84-year-old mother, who
is suffering from Alzheimer's. She dresses up at home and talks to
men online, occasionally going out with them, but only as Sara.

"I don't consider myself as gay," she says. "If I wanted to date a
guy as a guy, that would be gay. But most of the guys I date wouldn't
date another guy."

All Aiden wanted for his 18th birthday was testosterone. The MICA
student turned legal age in November, but in September began seeing a
therapist who could OK the shots. Hormone therapy began Feb. 20, but
in early February, talking over a cup of coffee at City Café, Aiden
was still testosterone-free.

"I'm waiting--I'm anxious," he says. "I wasn't anxious until
yesterday, when a friend told me that she gave her ex-boyfriend shots
and the first one bounced off his leg."

It's a big needle. In order to reduce breast size, grow facial and
chest hair, and lower his voice, Aiden will have to give himself
shots at least once every two weeks. He's absolutely clear on the
decision to take hormones; it's the shots that make him nervous. His
slight build doesn't give much room for error; it's not like there's
a lot of flesh to push the needle into. "I'm not really too worried
about anything else," he says.

"I for sure decided that I was going to do this when I was 16," he
says. "I got to the point that [I thought] I can keep fighting myself
or be who I really am." The fighting included a period of time when
he was very effeminate. "Dresses, makeup, straight hair--mostly to
please my mom."

Aiden has heard from other transmen that the hormones will reduce the
static in his mind, a constant experience that is difficult for him
to express. "Every thought that processes through my head is also
processed through this gender dichotomy that I have," he
explains. "In my head, it's just thoughts, and then there's this
gender stuff that's bundled with it."

These thoughts are all-consuming and distract him from everyday
things. There's a constant evaluation: Am I being masculine enough to
pass? Was that person questioning my gender? Did she mean to call
me "she"? Aiden is betting that life will be much better on
testosterone, even with big needles.

But the hormones are not a solution for everyone. Sara Brown went
that route in 2003. For six months, she took anti-androgen pills to
block the testosterone she was naturally producing; for three months,
she was on hormone-replacement therapy. But on Feb. 28, 2004, all
that changed. After waking up and doing her morning crunches, she
suffered a heart attack that may have been brought on by the hormones
she was taking.

"It does happen, but it's not common," Brown says of the blood clot
caused by the four to six milligrams of estrogen she was taking every
day. "That's why I'm scared to try again. If I had the money and the
health, I would transition completely."

So, she lives her life straddling the gender fence. She's out to most
everyone she knows, including the guys at work, but her quiet
demeanor allows her to blend into the crowd. She carries a small
photo album in her purse to show people what she looks like in femme
mode.

"Everybody at work knows and has at least seen my photos, and a few
of them have seen me dressed," Brown says.

Some transwomen only want hormone-induced breasts. Some transmen are
only interested in growing a beard. For others hormone treatments are
the precursor to surgery.

Kristina talks quickly--with her voice and hands. She stops herself
midsentence from time to time. "I'll slow down," she says. Her
birdlike demeanor is not because she's nervous; it's the additional
estrogen pumping through her system. She's been on hormones for about
a year and a half--first on a dose that was far too low, now at a
more appropriate level.

"I have as much testosterone as an 11-year-old boy," Kristina
explains. That's thanks to a testosterone blocker, which she won't
need after her testes are removed.

She takes two times the amount of estrogen as an average woman has in
her body. Her menopausal neighbor is on .6 milligrams of supplemental
estrogen once per day. Kristina is taking eight milligrams of
estrogen plus five milligrams of progesterone (another female
hormone) every day.

"I go from kiss to kill to cry in 1.2 seconds," she jokes, but it's a
roller-coaster ride of emotions that is a challenge to stay on from
day to day.

Female hormones are not the only nonsurgical treatment for
transwomen. Some opt for silicone injections to plump up their cheeks
and lips. At illicit pump parties, some transwomen plunk down $300
for a shot of nonmedical silicone gel (similar to bathroom caulk),
Chase Brexton's Dr. Eva Hersh says: "I try to tell them they could
save all of their $300s and get good plastic surgery."

It's pretty easy to get estrogen, Hersh adds. Transwomen without
health insurance might delve into the black-market estrogen trade in
Baltimore. "If nothing else, it's easy to get birth-control pills,"
she notes. Some women get the pill, which is a synthetic estrogen, at
a free or reduced-rate clinic and give it to transwomen friends. But
testosterone is a Class IV controlled substance.

As a preop transman, Kristina's boyfriend, Zak, won't take
testosterone without having top surgery--surgery to remove his
breasts.

"Boobs and beard," Kristina chimes in. That's not the look Zak is
going for.

Wendy has a beautiful vagina. She is so proud of the new her that she
boots up her laptop to show digital before-and-after shots. It truly
is amazing--no one would ever guess it was less than a year old and
cost $16,500.

"I was scared to death," she says of her trip to Canada for the
surgery last April. "I was scared if I was doing the right thing."
But now she knows: "It gave me confidence."

Wendy was 6--two years younger than her son is now--when she
remembers first wanting to be a girl. "I went to bed praying to God
that I would wake up a girl," she says. "By the time I was 18, I
prayed to God that he would take this curse off me. For a long time,
I thought I was a freak of nature, a cross-dresser, a pervert."

She risked a great deal for this surgery, not the least of which the
possibility that she would never orgasm again: "It's made sex a lot
more difficult than I expected. It's also good." Anita, her
girlfriend of nearly two years, stuck through it all with her, but
Wendy is in danger of losing joint custody of her son.

"It's hard for me, because I see her as beautiful," Anita says. "I
don't see how people can look at her and second-guess, not know that
she's always been a woman." Wendy looks better in a pair of jeans
than many genetically born women do. And a black turtleneck sweater
sets off her California-blond hair.

"The simple fact is I am transgender," Wendy says. "I was born a
male. I am now physically female. My son--it's not fair, but that's
what he has to deal with."

Her transition from physically male to female has been a long one.
She began dressing as a woman on weekends in the late '90s. In 2001,
she had a motorcycle accident that shattered a bone in her foot.
That's when she first talked to her doctor about hormone treatment.

"At that point, I wanted to let my breasts grow," Wendy explains. She
took hormones for three years. Once she completed the required
therapy to be granted a referral for sex-reassignment surgery, things
went very quickly. Typically there is a waiting list, but the surgeon
had a cancellation.

"I had five weeks to prepare for surgery," Wendy says, which included
going off all hormone treatments. "Next thing we know, we're in an
airplane." Anita flew to Montreal with Wendy and stayed until after
the surgery.

"I couldn't sign my name, I was so nervous," Wendy continues. "But it
wasn't a choice. That's how serious it was."

She can't stress enough the severity of the decision. "People think
you just go out there and do this for fun," she says. "No. Cross-
dressers and drag queens do this for fun."

Kristina is so intent on surgery that she's going to Thailand for it
in August. Her procedures will cost $9,000 for castration and
vaginoplasty (building a new vagina), $1,200 for a skin graft, and
$3,000 for breast implants--that's a whole lot less than it would
cost in the U.S. or Canada. But Zak is not thrilled about Thailand.

"She'll be gone a month," he says. "I can't be gone from work that
long. And what if there are complications? I'm just worried that
she's going to go to Thailand and get hurt."

Kristina got her letter in January from her psychiatrist OKing the
surgery. "You've got to go to a shrink to prove you're crazy to get
surgery," she says with a laugh.

Relatively speaking, it's simple to make a vagina--the skin of the
penis is inverted to create the vaginal walls and the sex nerves are
clumped to create the clitoris--but a fully functioning penis
requires some compromises. With phalloplasty, skin from the forearm,
leg, or abdomen is grafted onto the groin area and the scrotum is
created from the labia. Additional surgeries are required to allow
the penis to get hard. Plus skin grafting causes major scarring.

"Looking into having the bottom surgery--it's not good right now,"
Zak says. "Of course, I want the surgery. Right now. Today. But I
want it to look good, and I want it to function." The price tag, at
between $70,000 and $100,000, is another barrier.

Yet, Zak feels that successful bottom surgery would improve his
relationship with Kristina. "It causes a lot of problems in the way
that I feel," he says. "Because I feel like a guy, but I don't have
all the body parts. It's sad, really."

Top surgery is not a question, though. "I don't want these at all,"
Zak says pointing to his breasts. "I don't care what they look like
[after surgery]. I just want them gone." Top surgery for transmen--
removing the breasts--is a bit more complicated than might be
expected. The breasts are in essence deflated in one surgery. After
several months of recovery, allowing the remaining skin and breast
tissue to retract, another surgery completes the process.

Zak admits that he's envious of smaller-framed transmen who can pass
without having major reconstructive surgery. To get a somewhat
similar effect, he must wear two chest binders, a sports bra, and
three shirts.

"My ribs feel bruised after wearing a binder and all those clothes,"
he says. He's considering a radical mastectomy, to speed the process
and because insurance might pay for it. Anyway, he's hoping that
chest hair would cover the scars.

The binders are also problematic for Owen Smith, who has asthma. He
can't wear them while he's working, because they restrict his
breathing--like a corset, ironically. "I've known people to pass
out," he says.

"It always seems to come down to the goddamn bathroom." Dr. Dana
Beyer rolls her eyes.

Beyer, a former eye surgeon who had sex-reassignment surgery in 2003,
ran for a state delegate seat in Montgomery County last fall and
lost; she is now senior policy and legislative adviser for health and
education to Councilwoman Duchy Trachtenberg of the Montgomery County
Council. But with all of that success, she still faces some of the
same every-day challenges of other transwomen and transmen. Still,
she offers a simple rule for the bathroom dilemma. "If you're
dressing as a man, you go to the men's room. Period," she says. "You
go to the one that relates to your gender expression."

Seems simple enough, but it's not that easy. And Beyer knows that.
Zak remembers coming home from a trans conference and visiting the
rest room at the airport. He wasn't in male mode, so he stepped into
the women's bathroom, where a woman told him to leave. He didn't feel
like he could go into the men's bathroom, so he waited until she left
and went back in.

"Bathrooms suck," Smith agrees. It's not about the bathroom, of
course--it's about passing. Bathrooms are the one place that everyone
visits on occasion that is all about gender.

"Yeah, that's an issue," Aiden says, although at MICA the dorm rooms
have private bathrooms. "That was a big thing for me when I was
looking at schools."

There's more, of course, especially for those who have not gone
through a complete social transformation. Although Smith has been
living as a man for more than two years, his driver's license is
still marked with an "F." "I'm often seen as a 12-year-old boy
instead of a 24-year-old transperson," he says.

Charlene carries a Washington Baltimore Alliance-created "transgender
identification card" with her, which includes a photo of her in femme
mode and a request to treat her respectfully. If she were pulled over
for speeding while in femme mode, for example, she would present the
card with her driver's license. She's never had to use it.

Legally speaking, Baltimore is a great place to live and work as a
transgender person. Since 2002, the city has included gender identity
and expression in its nondiscrimination laws for employment, housing,
and public access. State senators Lisa Gladden (D-41st District) and
Richard Madeleno (D-18th) have introduced a comparable bill in
Annapolis.

But none of that means diddley if discrimination cannot be proven.
The sad fact is that many transpeople find it extremely challenging
to find work. Wendy has been unemployed since just before she had her
surgery last April. Kristina has been looking for work for at least
as long. Neither of them have had any luck.

"I've been on many interviews," says Wendy, who before transitioning
was a highly qualified auto mechanic and extreme sportsperson. She
recently applied for a job at a ski shop. She could name four brands
of equipment, was qualified for ski patrol, and was able to answer
questions about packing for a ski trip. She was told a few weeks
later that the shop decided not to hire anyone due to the warm
weather. She says she's not buying it.

"You're more than qualified, until you get there in person," her
partner, Anita, remarks.

"Right now I have child support to pay," Wendy says. "I can't work,
and so I can't pay child support." Her ex-wife sent legal papers to a
former job--documents that used Wendy's male name. Days later, Wendy
says she was told that "things just weren't working out."

Kristina, who was once a licensed electrician, has had similar
experiences. She felt sure she would get a position she had applied
for teaching an electrician class. "I had a good, strong résumé for
that job," she says. She got a message from the employer and returned
the call. "I called the guy every day for a week. He never called me
back."

The job interview is not always about passing, either. Donna
Cartwright, outreach coordinator for transgender issues at Equality
Maryland, the state's largest GLBT civil-rights organization, says
that simple background checks will out a transgender person.

"In a way, the legislative battle is only the first step," Cartwright
says. "I don't think anyone believes that passing an anti-
discrimination law will solve all things." Legislation will give
transgender people legal recourse, but most importantly it changes
the discourse of the debate.

Simply being out in public is enough to put some transgender people
in danger. Gender identity and expression has been part of the
state's hate-crimes law since 2005, but safety is still a major
concern for most transgender people.

"I look presentable enough that I can go out, but I get spotted
enough that I know I'm not completely passable," Sara Brown says. "As
long as they're not hostile, I don't care."

When Owen Smith was a sophomore at MICA in 2001, two men attacked him
while he was walking home from a friend's house. He was sexually
assaulted and thrown into the fountains on Park Avenue, before he
managed to kick one of his assailants in the groin. They both took
off.

Smith quit school and began drinking a lot. He ended his relationship
with his girlfriend. And then two years later, he was assaulted again-
-this time after leaving his job at Gallagher's Bar for more plastic
cups from the supermarket. The assault began when a group of guys
thought he was someone else. When they discovered the binding around
his chest they beat him. He managed to drive back to the bar and call
the police.

"They never caught them," he says. "I never heard anything.

"I went through a period where I was totally paranoid," Smith
continues. "I didn't want to close the bar by myself. I didn't want
to go out if we ran out of anything."

In the absence of legal protections, family support definitely plays
a role in how transgender people feel about themselves, Baltimore
Prevention Coalition's Paschall says. Cydné Kimbrough is the perfect
example.

"She was given to me, and I thought, I must be a very special person
because I can handle it," says Kimbrough's mother, Sandra
Kimbrough. "I try to make her feel as comfortable as possible."

When she talks about her daughter's childhood, she slips into male
pronouns, but otherwise Sandra is clear that her daughter is a
transwoman. "When he came out to me [as a teenager], I was scared,"
she says. "I thought that meant he was going to leave me." Kimbrough
assured her mother that she wasn't going anywhere.

"I called her Cydné when she was in my womb," Sandra says. "Of
course, as a mother, I would have wanted her to have a wife and
children, but I've got to go with the flow."

Kimbrough gives her mother a lot of credit for her own sense of self-
awareness and esteem: "She's made it really easy. I don't think she
really gets that. I don't think she realizes how much she's
responsible [for the person I've become]."

"Your home is where you get your love and strength," Sandra says.
Pointing to the window, she adds, "It's a cruel world out there."

"The solutions are easy," Beyer says of the legal and social issues
that transpeople face on a daily basis. All it takes is some
inclusive language by legislators and attention to the golden rule.
But implementation is a challenge. Although the gay and lesbian civil-
rights movement added the "T" to GLBT in the mid-'90s, transpeople
have often been "thrown off the bus" by gays and lesbians, Beyer
says. That's turning around.

"The paradigm shifted in the LGBT community," Cartwright
says. "Sometime in 2003, it was no longer acceptable to leave people
out." That year, states began passing anti-discrimination and hate
crime laws that protected gays, lesbians, and transpeople.

States and municipalities that already offered protections for gays
and lesbians are now enacting "catch-up bills," adding gender
identity and expression to existing legislation. In 2001, Maryland
put in place anti-discrimination protection for sexual orientation
but left out transpeople. This year, the General Assembly is
considering legislation that will add gender identity and expression
to the existing law, and passage looks promising. (Baltimore City
enacted protections for transpeople in 2002.) Still "transgender
catch-up bills" are more difficult to implement, because there are
fewer transpeople to push for them.

"We think the time is ripe. Momentum is on our side," she continues.
More and more states and municipalities are considering protections
for gender identity and expression, and examples of discrimination--
like the firings of Largo, Fl.'s city manager and a faculty member at
Spring Arbor University in Michigan--are getting more press attention
and support from advocates.

In the meantime, transpeople in Baltimore fight personal battles and
celebrate individual accomplishments. Wendy testified in Annapolis in
support of the proposed anti-discrimination legislation. In mid-
February, Kristina learned that her surgery is a go--she'll
officially become a biological woman during the second week in
August. Meanwhile, Aiden was cleared to start hormone shots and is
already noticing a difference.

"I just want people to see me as I see myself in my head," he says.
