CHECK OUT THESE 9 FREE SAMPLE INTERVIEW ANSWERS PULLED STRAIGHT FROM
&quot;THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO JOB INTERVIEW ANSWERS.&quot; What did you like best
and least about your previous job?

DISCUSSION: This question reveals a lot about you. You want to
indicate that what you liked best about your last job are things that
will appeal to the Hiring Manager. Show that your last job allowed you
to demonstrate many of the desirable Behavioral Competencies that are
discussed at the beginning of this Guide. Give specific examples of
how your last job allowed you to flex your skills and show your
maturity. Never make statements like &quot;I like that my last company gave
me a lot of vacation days,&quot; or something similar. When answering about
what you liked least, keep it short, do not be negative, and relate
your answer to how your last job limited you in your ability to
exhibit positive Behavioral Competencies.

&quot;What I liked about my last job was the fact that there was good on
the job training. I was able to really develop my &quot;X&quot; skills, which I
know will help me succeed here if I am fortunate enough to be able to
join your team. What are the qualities and skills of the people who
have been most successful at this company?&quot;

&quot;One thing I liked about my last job was that it allowed me to develop
my leadership skills. FOR EXAMPLE, I was put in charge of a project
where I had to earn the &quot;buy-in&quot; of people from multiple different
departments -- including Marketing, IT, Product Development, and even
HR. I held all the responsibility for getting this project completed
on time, even though I had no real authority over my teammates since
they did not report to me. I was able to create a project vision that
the team agreed on, and then day-to-day I made sure that each team
member completed their work on time. I did this in most cases by
appealing to my teammates' own self-interests. FOR EXAMPLE ... &quot;

&quot;What I liked least about my last job was that the management style
was pretty hands off, and this was fine for me because I am self-
motivated and work hard to achieve. But but the lack of structure
sometimes allowed some of my teammates to slack off from time to time
-- and I often ended up having to pick up the extra work. I would not
mind that SOMETIMES, but it got old after a while. I had to
constructively approach my manager and let her know what was going on
WITHOUT creating any friction between me and the slacker teammates,
who I actually liked as people. In the end, it worked out well,
because I was pro-active. Have you ever run into that type of
situation as a manager?&quot;

&quot;... a full explanation of what you need to say to get you hired ...&quot;

What have you learned from your mistakes?

DISCUSSION: Show that you are able to learn from your mistakes, but
don't offer up any negative examples concerning your past performance.
Show that you have been successful, but that you have the maturity it
takes to examine your own behavior so that you can learn and grow and
be a better employee. Be brief.

&quot;Good question. Well, I have been successful at every job I have had,
but I have had the normal ups and downs. I'd say that I do actively
try to monitor my work habits and the quality of my work so that I can
constantly be improving myself. FOR EXAMPLE, I have had one or two
hiccups with customers where their satisfaction was not where I
thought it was. I learned that I have to really monitor certain
difficult customers closely and &quot;take their temperature&quot; so I can keep
their satisfaction level as high as possible. Have you had any
customers like that here?&quot;

&quot;... learn the 'mind-set' of successful interviewing ...&quot;

Give me an example of a problem you faced on the job, and tell me how
you solved it.

DISCUSSION: This is a problem solving question that tests your
critical thinking skills. This is a great question for showing that
you are a creative and capable problem solver. The problem you select
to use as an example should be as similar as possible to a problem
that you are likely to face at the job you are interviewing for.

&quot;I try to take a systematic approach to problem solving where I take
the time to gather the relevant data, clearly define the problem or
goal, then come up with possible solutions. I think it is important to
get the information and clarify the problem first before you start
coming up with possible solutions, or wasting other people's time. FOR
INSTANCE, when I was at Job &quot;X&quot; ...
What kinds of challenges are you currently facing in your department?
How tough a position does this put you in? What could the ideal
candidate do to help solve this problem in his or her first three
months on the job?&quot;

&quot;Hello Bob, it's me here again Teresa. I am so glad to have found
your Interview Answers! ... Your Guide truly opened my mind and not
just my eyes. It widened my knowledge -- and I got the job. Keep it up
people of wisdom!&quot;
-- Teresa Rotich, Controller

&quot;... will fill you with motivation and confidence ...&quot;

Describe a situation when working with a team produced more successful
results than if you had completed the project on your own.

DISCUSSION: This is a &quot;behavioral interviewing&quot; style of question. The
Hiring Manager wants to learn more about your thought process, and how
well you can form examples to answer this teamwork related question.
You will want to show your ability to solicit ideas from others,
listen carefully, and persuade people to your point of view.

&quot;Well, I have worked both independently and as a member of team,
throughout my career. I enjoy both, and can do both equally well. I
will have to say, though, that working with others has often yielded
great results for projects I have worked on -- specifically when it
comes to brainstorming. I try to get everyone involved in coming up
with new solutions by making time for sessions where &quot;there are no
wrong ideas or answers.&quot; The creativity of a group of people is always
going to be greater than that of one person, and thus the results will
be more successful. I did that a lot a Job &quot;Y&quot;. FOR EXAMPLE ...&quot;

&quot;Working with others allows you data-mine other people's skills and
experiences, get perspectives and ideas that you would not have on
your own, and check the quality of your own work before it goes out
the door. FOR EXAMPLE, at Job &quot;X&quot; I worked with many great people. I
was able to &quot;pick their brains&quot; -- so to speak -- about the
effectiveness of various techniques, estimates on how long it would
take to get various things done, etc. I would not have been able to do
my job as effectively with out them. Will there be the opportunity to
work in team situations at this job?&quot;

&quot;... don't let another day go by before you take action ...&quot;

Describe a time when you were faced with problems or stresses at work
that tested your coping skills. What did you do?

DISCUSSION: Workplace stress is an issue for everyone. Don't pretend
that you never get stressed out. You want to show that you can deal
with stress and cope with difficult situations. Show that you are calm
under pressure, and know how to avoid stress in the first place
through planning and time management.

&quot;Well I think it is important to remember that stress effects
everyone, and it is inevitable that sometimes people are going to have
bad days. That is why I try to give people the benefit of the doubt
when they seem to have a short fuse. What I do personally is try to
control my response to a situation. You can't necessarily control what
happens to you, but you can control your response. What I try to do is
lengthen the time between the stressful situation and my response --
so that I can identify the cause of the stress and decide what I can
do about it. FOR EXAMPLE, on several occasions I have had to deal with
very irate customers who actually yelled at me. What I did was stay
calm and not let them get under my skin. I really tried to listen and
decide exactly what it was that was at the root of their problem. Then
I provided solutions that could be completed within a specific time-
frame. I always find that it is best to face those types of situations
head-on and be objective about them. I do my best to be professional
and not get my emotions involved. Also, I try to avoid stress in the
first place by tackling difficult tasks or conversations sooner rather
than later. Does that make sense?&quot;

&quot;... if you fail to prepare, then you prepare to fail ...&quot;

&quot;Usually before job interviews I would get so nervous! I would just
study my resume before-hand and then nervously repeat what was on my
resume. I was not prepared for different types of questions.
Seriously, I would get so nervous that I would sweat, and I could feel
my heart beating faster! After downloading your Guide, I have learned
to take my experience and spin it in a positive way for almost any
kind of question. In my last interview I felt so much more confident
and prepared. Thanks again Bob! &quot;  -- Geoff Presley, Finance

What was your role in your department's most recent success?

DISCUSSION: You'll want to be very specific here, and frame your
answer in terms of how you saved time and money. The Hiring Manager is
looking for a pattern of success, and you need to describe recent
successes in detail. Use the S.T.A.R. Statement formula for your
examples. Be prepared with at least three examples concerning your
recent successes, and make sure at least one of them relates to
teamwork and something you accomplished as part of a group. Make sure
you address how your work made other people FEEL, as well as the time
you saved and the revenue or cost-savings you generated.

&quot;I guess that would be a recent project for client &quot;X.&quot; I handled all
of the communication with the client for our last project. It was a
three month long project where my team had to build a custom package
based on the needs of client. I was instrumental in translating the
client's business needs into detailed product features. I had to make
sure that my team understood what the client wanted, and then check
the quality to make sure that we were delivering a quality product
with the features that the client was expecting. This was an ongoing
process that required a lot of communication and teamwork with my team
as well as the client. I think my role really was to clarify the scope
of the project, and then &quot;manage the client's expectations.&quot; We were
able to deliver on time, and the client was thrilled! I was able to
make sure no time was wasted on adding unnecessary features, and since
we were working on a fixed bid price, we saved my company time and
money. My manager and everybody on my team felt great because the
project went so smoothly. Is that the kind of experience that would
help me be successful here?&quot;
