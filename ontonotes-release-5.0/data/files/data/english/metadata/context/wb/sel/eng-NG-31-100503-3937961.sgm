Anyone own a Focus automatic?
I want to know how much of the Focus drive is affected by the auto
transmission, as opposed to manuals which are well known to be a great
drive.
Any mechanical problems? I dont think Ford in general are great with
making automatics, although i might be mistaken.

I am presently renting a 2005 ZX4 with an automatic transmission
during this time, as my 2003 ZX3 is in the body shop.

The first think I noticed about this car was the difference in
fuel consumption compared to my 2003 ZX3 with a manual
transmission  The 2005 ZX4 automatic get fewer miles pre gallon
then does the 2003 ZX3 manual. The rentel has little over 13,000
miles on it my ZX3 has more then 187,000 miles on it. Most of
the miles I dirve are done at highway speed on my daily 370 mile
round trip between the eastern shore of Maryland and Baltimore.

I can't comment on the mechanical reliability of Ford automatics
transmission because I haven't owned a car of any make with an
automatics transmission sense I retired my 1986 Chevrolet Astro
Van back in the mid 1990s. Needless to say the 700 series GM
automatics transmissions in the Astro Van of that era were crap.

On a different note, My 2003 ZX3 has the transmission on the
right side. The engine in the 2005 ZX4 is turened 180 degrees
with the transmission on the left side.

The Focus automatic is designed by Mazda.

That's true, but Ford also seems to have a lot of trouble with
manual clutches too.  Unbelievable, the number of plastic parts
in a Ford transmission.

We've got a '00 Wagon with the auto.  Performance is adequate, if not
spunky when you put your foot in it.   Mileage isn't impressive as
already noted.  (Our engine is the 1.6L DOHC.)  We just got the car
back in October, but I'm pretty sure the transmission is original with
no major repairs and we are sitting at 65K miles.  No complaints yet.

I know I'm less than impressed with the clutch in my Ford Super Duty.
I'm on my second one with only 90K miles on the clock.  (And I drive
many highway miles and am very easy on clutches.)

I've always been a manual transmission person, but got the auto in our
2004 ZX5 with the 2.3 engine. I really like it, and don't miss the
manual at all, except that the fuel milage with the auto seems to be
lower thatn what I would expect with a manual trans. Incidentally, one
of the reasons my wife demanded automatic was due to the clutch
problems we had with our 2001 Ford Escape 2.0L manual. We always had
clutch "judder" even after Ford replaced the clutch and pressure plate
3 times. Other than that, we liked the Escape.
The auto in the ZX5 combined with the 2.3L engine is pretty sporty, and
shifts well. No mechanical problems at this stage, but we've only had
it for about 8 months.

I have the same car.. '01 wagon 1.6 liter with auto tranny.. So far so
good..knock on
wood! Not as quick as one with the manual transmission however. It is
somewhat thirsty when driven in city. It uses 10 liters / 100 kms in city
and 7 liters on highway.. What do you get with your car?

I have a 2001, 1.6L Automatic, 45K miles.

I recently queried the UK Telegraph Motoring Correspondent "Honest John" for
his opinion on the transmission, I value his opinions.

His comment was along the lines of - no known reliability problems with this
Mazda manufactured auto transmission - sealed unit and should be good for
75,000 miles.

As for driving, clearly acceleration and mpg are affected, but I am no boy
racer, and find it completely satisfactory for my needs.  Like the manual
box, the top gear is overgeared for economy, which means that major inclines
require the selection of a lower gear; there is a nice button on the side of
the selector, which switches overdrive off (i.e. limits the box to 3 speed)
which I occasionally find I have to use to get the right power out of the
system.  In terms of driving, steering, ride etc, it is just as good as a
manual.

I would highly recommend the 1.6L auto based on nearly 4 years from new -
with, as yet, no problems at all.

I've only checked it a couple of times and I recorded 26-27 mpg (US)
on the highway.  These weren't easy highway cruises as they did
include running up and over a mountain pass between my home and
Seattle, WA at 75 mph.  But the window sticker claimed a 30 mpg EPA
highway rating, and I've been able to come within 1 or 2 mpg of those
ratings on the last several vehicles I've owned.

The vehicle is my wife's daily driver and has now settled into a
routine commute running 75% highway, and I should check the mpg on it
now.

jphag has almost the same Foci that we do. ... My 2004 Focus (station wagon)
with
the 2.3 is my first automatic, also. I still feel a small shock -- I've only
had mine for about
half a year -- at every fill-up only because it "feels" as if it was gulping
gas. But I attribute that to having a 2.3L; I haven't owned one that big for
our last several cars. The 2004 wagon has plenty of pep when I need it, also
shifts well. And we've had no clutch problems with my
wife's manual 2001 (sedan) Focus either. Her problem with that one turned
out to be her (comparatively) short, slow, stop-and-go commutes in city
traffic. She's not even put 30K miles on her 2001 yet, but complained how
sluggish the response was. Much better, she says, since it was flushed out
at the dealership recently, plus whatever else they did to make it
"unsticky." Here's hoping for no clutch problems on that one -- although we
haven't had clutch problems on any of the half dozen small Fords we've owned
for more than a decade (knock wood?). "One's mileage may vary," I suppose
....

Damn.  I couldn't agree with you more.  I have a 2001 ZX3 and just had the
clutch repaired.  I noticed, while the service records were brought up, that
the clutch was repaired about this time last year.  I bought the car used in
June of 2004.  A plastic cylinder under the clutch pedal broke and that was
just the tip of the iceberg as the entire clutch assembly had to be
replaced.

Ah well, all I had to pay was $150.  Now, I am concerned about the future
with this Ford clutch "problem".
