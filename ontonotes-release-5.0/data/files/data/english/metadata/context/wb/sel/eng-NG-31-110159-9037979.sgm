Hi folks,

Was racking off my first pressing yesterday and in two of the containers (which were slow to start) there was a distinct layer forming on top of the must, about 50mm thick, brown, jelly-like consistency. I was worried it was something like Mother of Vinegar, but the juice underneath was clear, slightly sparkling and sweet.

Have I obtained an accidental partial keeve?

I racked off the clear juice until the brown jelly started to appear in the pipe, leaving behind around half a gallon (out of 6) of what looked like wobbly coffee custard. The now blended and under air-lock cider is going great guns.

Any thoughts?

Cheers,

Ray.

Ray, that does sound exactly like a keeve and you did well to separate the clear juice from the brown cap while the cap was intact.   My first keeve was also by accident and results were so nice I started looking into use of PME (pectin methyl esterase) as an aid to improve reliablility in obtaining one.

This is exactly what we aim for - the chapeau brun - when looking at the
first fermentation for a cidre bouche.  The second fermentation is in the  bottle
and as our cider is not sterilized, fermentation continues slowly with
gradual alteration to flavours and characteristics of the cider.  We are  enjoying
cider we have bottled 5 years ago as well as more recent  production.

On the subject of chapeau brun:

I have recently started brewing my first batch of cider (only two
gallons, a veritable guppy in the ukcider pond). Following juicing, I
threw in some pectolase and Campden tablets and left for 24 hours.
During this settling period, a brown head developed; I subsequently
pitched some yeast in and left to ferment.

There is not a huge volume of detailed information about keeving out
there: my question is, should I have racked off the juice prior to
starting fermentation, and have I spoiled my first batch by not doing
so?

I should point out at this point that my purpose to adding the enzyme
was purely to eliminate the pectin haze and increase the amount of
sugar available for fermentation, not to limit the nutrients available
to allow a sweet cider to be brewed. Over the past week of brewing I
have observed the sediment in the bottom of the demijohns slowly
disappearing, and the brown head slowly being replaced by a healthy
yeasty one. Once fermentation started, it has progressed at a steady
rate and shows no sign of slowing down (our house is quite cold at the
moment, so this may just be down to the lower temperature). I am keen
to known whether the taste will be anything like the smell coming out
the fermentation lock though!

If you go to my website and type 'keeving' into the search box you get
15 hits. Not a huge amount, but a start.

You will not achieve a proper keeve if you use Pectolase, because it is
a broad spectrum pectolytic enzyme with depolymerisisng activity which
will destroy the required gel. You need a special enzyme which contains
just pectin methyl esterase and not the depolymerising enzymes. (What
happened to Ray is that he had enough of this enzyme present naturally
in his fruit, hence his natural chapeau brun)

You have not done any harm by not racking, but you're not going to get a
naturally sweet cider this way even if you had racked (unless your
juice was stonkingly low in nutrients - and by adding a cultured yeast
you have rather offset that possibility anyway. The point of keeving is
to stress and starve the yeast so that it gives up before all the sugar
is consumed).

Thanks for that. I had previously looked over your presentation
before, I think the Fred Beech paper may keep me busy tonight though.
To be honest, most of the searching I've done internet-wise almost
always ends up linking back to your site, so I should have known it
would be in there somewhere...
