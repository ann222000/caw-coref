To make long story short they used their deception to sign stuff i
never agreed to or was deceived to. good thing i made some search on
google about them and came to find out they had a long list of angry
coustomers which had been lied in to signing a 3 year contract. so i
went to their headquarters and canceled all my envolvemnts with them
before the &quot;3 day calcelation&quot; was over, at least thats what i think.
my question is, are they going to come up with a different story to
extort money from me. for example the 30 day trial membership, if i
dont go for a maximum of 12 days are still going to continue on my
membership. please if you guys have any advice it will be very helpful.

"/> Only time will tell. Most of those who complained about Bally's could
have avoided the problem at the outset simply by reading the contract
before they signed, rather than relying on the word of the sales person.
The trouble with many people is they assume that just because a sales
droid smiles at them, that the sales droid is their new best friend.

Here's a consumers tip: Never assume that a sales person is your friend.
The job of a sales person is to sell, not make new friends. This applies
to all consumer transactions, not just health club memberships.

is work, they stop going.

A lot of people take it seriously and work out on a regular basis -- not
enough to support a &quot;nice&quot; facility, though.

"/> Many do just that. I suggest you not generalize. Bally's is known for
having membership contracts with a lot of fine print, but no one is ever
placed in a situation where a gun is held to their head to have them
sign a contract. I used to be a member of Bally's for many years and I
never had a problem and their gym in my area was fantastic. I only quit
because my employer opened up a gym right across from my office and, so
I simply didn't renew my membership at Bally's when my contract expired.
This is no different than any other situation where signing a contract
is involved. The consumer is always well advised to read the contract
carefully before signing.

"/>  My problem has always been that you end up paying alot for the
&quot;possibilities&quot; instead of paying for just what you need because of the way
they package their memberships. If there was a club that offered a kick-butt
water aerobics class twice a week, and forced me to pay for *only that*, I'd be
there in a heartbeat and I'd go consistently. Why should I pay for the
opportunity to use 50 stairclimbers, 20 bicycles, 100 free weights, basketball,
raquetball, day care, etc, when I *know* I don't want and will never use them?
The last time I had a club membership, they started out with a really
good deep-water class once a week and a &quot;social hour&quot; water aerobics class
several times a week, so it was almost worth the $100/month I was paying. When
they cancelled the deep-water class due to lack of interest*, I quit. I don't
want to socialize, I want to work out. Apparently I'm alone in that.

* Water aerobics has a terrible reputation for being classes for &quot;fat, lazy,
or old people&quot;, which simply shouldn't be true. So I couldn't figure out why
the deep-water class, which was a kick-butt workout, was scorned by everyone
but me and one other lady.
