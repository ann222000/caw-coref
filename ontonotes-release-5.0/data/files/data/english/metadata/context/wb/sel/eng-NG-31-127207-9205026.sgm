I don't know about that, because unless something very bazaar happens, the
Steelers would have to play on the road.
Also, they need to beat someone with a record better than 5-4. Oh, and stop
losing to teams like Denver and Arizona. Did I forget anything? Nope, that's
about it!!

The only reason the Stealers* got past the Bengals in the playoffs was Cowher put a hit out on Carson Palmer
via Kimo von Oelhoffen. If Carson never got hurt, it would have been curtains for the Stealers*.

Nope it's because the Steelers are a better team, proven time and time
again, you would think that if the bengals were so good that they would have
at least won a home game against the Steelers in their past 7 trips to PBS.
The sports guys in Ohio call Cincinnati the &quot;City of Losers&quot;, even the fans
at the Stadium are getting shit on by pigeons that no one can seem to get
rid of, can't wait to see Miami get their first win of the season against
the bungals. Office buildings everywhere are planning end of the season
parties so they don't have to suffer anymore and the local kroger stores are
selling off all Bengal items for 40% off.   Yeah i'm stuck in Ohio due to my
Job, but being a Steeler fan out here is just priceless, every Monday i'm
the only one in a good mood

Very true!

My Pats are going to have a tough time when the Steelers come to Foxboro.  They
already proved why they have the #1 defense in the NFL on Monday night with that
nice dismantling of the Ratbirds - GOOD JOB!  And we certainly proved we have
MANY weaknesses when faced with a tough D like Indy.  I get the bad feeling
Brady will be rattled pretty hard on Dec. 9th.

Pittsburgh will definitely be BRINGIN' IT......I just hope we can put up a
decent fight.  I think we'll lose though.  :-(

Your Pats? What total horseshit. You are an idiot Steelers troll,
probably TJM under another alias outed based on the fact that your
headers show a posting IP address is located in Pittsburgh PA.

Here is the truth about the Steelers: Good at home, can't beat even the
Donkeys or Cardinals on the road. They will have NO CHANCE in NE. They
will be the #3 seed in the AFC and thus will draw the Colts in Indy after
a wild card game. The Colts will eviscerate the Steelers in the RCA dome.
38-14.

I'm pretty sure the Pats will charter a 747 to get to Arizona.  If
they did have to take a bus they would avoid Pittsburgh completely
since it's too far out of the way.  They would be in Pennsylvania but
just for that small stretch to Ohio.

Check Google maps if you're not sure.  Thanks for playing.  You can go
back to your squeelers newsgroup now.

No, that's just not true... the road to the Super Bowl will go through Erie,
but you stay well north of Pittsburgh when you drive from Foxboro to
Glendale.

A quick Mapquest check shows the road to the Super Bowl will go through
Buffalo, Cleveland, Indianpolis, St. Louis, OKC, Tulsa and Albuquerque
before arriving in the greater Phoenix area.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pats - 17

&gt;&gt; You are so full of shit you pantywaist Squealer fan.  Nice try! ;).
&gt;&gt; Posing as a Patriots fan and trying to use subversion to lower the morale
&gt;&gt; of Patriot nation.  It won't work brah!!!  The Squealers are an AFC 2nd
&gt;&gt; tier team at best and you know it.   They certainly can not compete with
&gt;&gt; the AFC elite like the Patriots and Colts.  The Patriots will also BRING
&gt;&gt; it on 9 Dec.  You might want to invert that score Einstein, that is if
&gt;&gt; the Squealers lucky. LOL.

&gt;&gt; GO PATS!!!

It's also where the Steelers go to lose. They have all-time losing
