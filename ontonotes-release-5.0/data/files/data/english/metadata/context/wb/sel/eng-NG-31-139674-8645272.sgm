1S two rounds ago.  This hand isn't all that big.  The queen-jack in
the suit opened by the opponents isn't worth all that much on offense,
and the doubleton queen of clubs should be downgraded also.  It
doesn't meet my standards for a one-suited takeout double.

Now that I've shown a better hand than I actually have and partner has
still refused to make any noise, doing anything besides passing now
seems ridiculous.

I've told my story, ie. big hand with long spades.    This hand is not worth
as much as its raw HCP, due to minor suit values that have to be downgraded.
Pass now and see if partner makes any peep at his last chance to do so, but
I doubt it.

Bid 1S over 1D.  Most players have absorbed some of the lessons of Roth
and Kaplan but seem stuck with other sloppy ideas from the 1930s.
Doubling with this hand is a reflection of those sloppy ideas.  Even if
you insist on double followed by a new suit to show a good hand, this
ain't it.  Your D:QJx and C:Qx are perilously close to waste paper.

Having bid as you did, you have already shown every bit of value in your
hand if not more.  It is time to stop bidding.  Letting them play a
diamond partscore isn't such a bad thing here.  And your partner ought
not have as much as a 5/6 count with 3+ spades or 4+ clubs at this
point.  It doesn't take much, if you pass, for him to find a spark of
life over 2S. If he should bid 2S over 2D, it is not even clear that
that is a good thing: the opponents have not shown a hint that they have
found a fit.

I'm a passer.  It's quite likely that LHO has a small doubleton diamond and
RHO with AKxxx (given that LHO didn't bid 2D over 1S, and RHO didn't bid 2D
over 1H).  So that's a bad start for us in 2S.

And I don't like being vulnerable.  This could easily be 2 off in 2S.  Non-
vul, 2S would be more of a temptation.

Cheers ... Bill.

There's a lot to be said for that; I thought I'd be alone in endorsing
it, but I see it's got a lot of favor.

Let me try another choice if we start with double: 1N, one round ago.
It's the right orientation, it shows the 19-20 slow stuff I have, and
anything partner does is lovely. This sequence and passing now might
catch partner with just enough to give 3N a charming play (partner
with a stiff spade and what appears to be a zero-value diamond king is
not going to rush over to notrump, right?). Treating this as a very
strong notrump is totally reasonable; much, much better than as a
double-then-1S hand.

Well, in my world you've shown a big flexible hand. As much as Adam
doesn't like this sequence, I like it less. I also think pass is
right, but I'm much less comfortable.

I would bid 2S. You are not going to get doubled in 2S. The opponents
have nothing in spades to double you with and both opponents have
minimums. Also, the opponents don't have x-ray vision so they don't
know if you could be more distributional.

Partner is marked with a little something since RHO passed the 1H
response and LHO didn't take a bid over your reopening 1S bid.. There
is no reason why partner can't have something modest such as:
S 10x   H xxxx  D xx  C Kxxxx. You would love your chances to make 2S
on a diamond lead. Also, the opponents  might make a defensive mistake
such as RHO trying to cash his heart ace from H Ax trying to get a
heart ruff. Please note, partner is not going to play you for a 20
count and he is most likely going to pass 2D.

But even if 2S is not making there is no reason why some LHO's might
take the push to 3D as either a possible make or a good sacrifice
against 2S. If 3D makes you got an average.  If 3D goes down you
probably have close to a top.

Even if 2S is down one and you are left to play it there for -100  it
is possible 3D might make for -110.

And then there is the possibilty the defense is inaccurate.

With so many possibilities of  getting a better score, I can't
possibly imagine passing at pairs.
You don't win pairs events by being a mouse.

This is a precarious position - if partner is truly busted you can be
without a hope of eight tricks.  If oppo are getting lots of minor-suit
tricks plus the heart ace, they don't even need to double to get a good
score.

Sure, after the pass of 1H partner rates to have a card, but jumping to
2NT just looks like losing bridge.

I never use it while I am bidding a hand. I use it more as an
analytical tool to see if I overvalued or undervalued a hand more than
I expected. It has modified how I value hands. On this particular
hand, had I been the first player to make a call I would have tried
2NT but K&amp;R indicates the bidding plan for the hand should have been
1S with a 2NT rebid.(I guess 3NT if you refuse to open 1NT with a 5
card major and are forced to rebid 2NT over partner's 1NT response)

&gt; &gt; I held recently at MP's vul vs not:

&gt; &gt; LHO dealt
&gt; &gt; (P) P (1D) X

&gt; &gt; (P) P (2D) ?

&gt; &gt; What call do you make?

&gt; &gt; Rob

&gt; I'm a passer.  It's quite likely that LHO has a small doubleton diamond and
&gt; RHO with AKxxx (given that LHO didn't bid 2D over 1S, and RHO didn't bid 2D
&gt; over 1H).  So that's a bad start for us in 2S.

&gt; And I don't like being vulnerable.  This could easily be 2 off in 2S.  Non-
&gt; vul, 2S would be more of a temptation.

&gt; Cheers ... Bill.

Pass was right. I thought it was interesting that this hand should
give up. After all, I would have opened 2NT.

This misses the point. Of course nobody can reproduce the K&amp;R
algorithm at the table, nor do I think K&amp;R is perfect. Nevertheless it
is a much better approximation to the correct value of a hand for a
suit contract.
But it is sufficient to realize that this hand has too many quacks and
too few controls for an average 2NT opening.
My assessment is that this hand is worth about 18 HCP, at best 19 for
notrump play only.
Doubling, rebidding 1NT and possibly follow up with 2S (a slight bur
reasonable overbid) would do more than justice to the hand.

Huh?  It doesn't miss the point at all.  Great, there's a tool that can tell
you something useful about a hand after the fact, but if it's useless at
the table it's only good for resulting.

I was being somewhat facetious when I asked - the fact that every time I see
a K&amp;R value posted, it's done with all the text from a computer program,
which made me a little suspicious, but I have never seen the algorithm.

Well, it wasn't about opening 2N, anyway.  It was about doubling, followed
by NT - and my seat-of-the-pants conclusion had already been that I should
probably make the rebid 1N rather than 2N because of the club holding.

According to your first entry you stated that the hand would be
somewhat above the 17-19 HCP range, but you did not like doubling
followed by 2NT. In fact it is perfect for this range.

I suggest you have a look at

http://www.gg.caltech.edu/~jeff/#bridge

To cite from there:

``knr'' computes Edgar Kaplan and Jeff Rubens' (K&amp;R) complex computer
count, published in an article in The Bridge World
...
Reiterating some of Rubens' article, this evaluator is supposed to
represent Edgar Kaplan's (very fine) hand evaluation judgment.
...
I have found it useful in mediating evaluation disagreements, and for
tuning my hand evaluation skills.

End of quote.

You can also find a link to the K&amp;R evaluation algorithm there in
text.

So it is in fact the other way round. The computer program was created
to mimic Edgar Kaplan's judgment at the table.
It allows you to compare your judgement with his.

That's not what I said.  The prior poster said that his HCP range worked for
double followed by 1NT.  I agreed that double followed by NT was my
preference, but our agreed HCP doesn't strictly allow 1 NT.  So, I have a
decision to make - as I said: &quot;it's either 2N or shade it a little because
I'm not thrilled about the C Qx.&quot;  What the K&amp;R evaluation says isn't
really relevant.  My partner is expecting HCP.  She's flexible, but I'd
better be able to back up my decisions when I depart from the agreements,
and the agreements aren't 17-19HCP unless K&amp;R says otherwise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

So?  Deciding that, based on a complicated formula that needs a computer was
apparently no better than my own thinking.

Confirming my opinion that this isn't something I have time for at the
