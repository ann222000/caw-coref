Today's headline : "U.S. Quietly Issues Estimate of Iraqi Civilian Casualties." Ah, but is it true? No, not at all. The U.S. government isn't interested in estimating "Iraqi civilian casualties"; what they released were "rough figures for Iraqis who have been killed or wounded by insurgents." In other words, a figure they can use to "score points" against the Iraqi resistance and in particular against the American antiwar movement. How many civilians did they kill in the assault on Fallujah, or the assault on Tal Afar, or the countless other similar actions? They don't know, and they couldn't care less. Because actual Iraqis, dead or alive, mean nothing whatsoever to them. Harsh? Perhaps. But all the available evidence suggests that it's absolutely true.

Off topic:

Do you think President Ahmedinejad of Iran called for genocide against Israelis?

You might if you read anything in the NY Times except for the full text of Ahmedinejad's speech.

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/3...iew/
30iran.html

Shockingly, even the Times link to the full text describes it as a link to the full text of the speech where Ahmedinejad wants Israel (sic) "wiped off the map"

Our dear Imam said that the occupying regime must be wiped off the map and this was a very wise statement. We cannot compromise over the issue of Palestine. Is it possible to create a new front in the heart of an old front. This would be a defeat and whoever accepts the legitimacy of this regime [Israel] has in fact, signed the defeat of the Islamic world. Our dear Imam targeted the heart of the world oppressor in his struggle, meaning the occupying regime. I have no doubt that the new wave that has started in Palestine, and we witness it in the Islamic world too, will eliminate this disgraceful stain from the Islamic world. But we must be aware of tricks.

So it seems that what must be wiped off the map is the occupying regime.

To turn what Ahmedinejad said into a call for genocide first one has to mistranslate "occupying regime of Al Quds" into "Israel".

Then one has to take advantage of the fact that country names such as "Israel" are ambiguous. They can refer to a government or they can refer to a population. ("Occupying Regime" is not ambiguous in this way)

After mistranslating occupying regime as Israel and taking advantage of that ambiguity you can now claim that Ahmedinejad call for the occupying regime to be wiped off the map is a call for the population of Israel to be wiped off the map.

If Ahmedinejad had actually made the call falsely attributed to him, it would have been deplorable. But nobody who had access to the original text or a reasonable translation of that text can conclude that Ahmedinejad was talking about anything other than the regime.

This is the story of media sources throughout the world going outside of the bounds of non-deceptive news to whip up anti-Iran/pro-Israel hysteria.

So what does Ahmedinejad really want for Israel?

Also in the text:

The issue of Palestine is not over at all. It will be over the day a Palestinian government, which belongs to the Palestinian people, comes to power; the day that all refugees return to their homes; a democratic government elected by the people comes to power. Of course those who have come from far away to plunder this land have no right to choose for this nation.

Sounds to me like he'd be happy with one-person one-vote and a return of the refugees.

Does "those who have come from far away" apply to Jews born in Israel? There is no indication that it does to Ahmedinejad. But if it does, that is the one point where I, or anyone who is not bigoted in favor of Jews, might differ with him.

But if Ahmedine

Cut off, I don't feel like re-typing. I guess you can see where that was going.

It is easier to debate against a dishonestly concocted caricature of Ahmedinejad's view than with his real view.

Actually, I was going to (and still might) write something about that today, but I already wrote something along those lines in a comment at the Politics in the Zeros blog. I interpret "Israel must be wiped off the map" literally, i.e., a call for a single, non-sectarian state in "historic Palestine", and as a statement completely distinct from "Israelis (or Jews) must be wiped off the face of the earth." However, since I hadn't had a chance to read the full statement to see if that interpretation was correct, I had (and have) refrained from writing about it. Maybe later today.

Ah, well, Fallout here we come!

Lost hope on BI to make Fallout3 but I guess a real postapocalyptic world would be waaaay cooler...

On a serious note, if you could put a bug in Sharon's meeting rooms the result would be somewhat similar.

The difference is that the loudmouth mullahs have 25 yo conventional weapons while the giulandians have some 100 to 200 nukes...

From this perspective, only the giulandians can effectivly "wipe out of the map", while Iranians need to "scrub off the map"...

Semantics...
