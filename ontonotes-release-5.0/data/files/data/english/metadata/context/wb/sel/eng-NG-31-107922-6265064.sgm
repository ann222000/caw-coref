Carey's remarks with regards to JPM and NASCAR; so, Akin was wrong,
wrong, wrong. This continual buffoonery seems to be an occupational
hazard with Akin - he posts on any subject and errors of his own
manufacture occur.

As of this moment Carey is still correct. I hope you do not claim a
questionable win in a support series as a major league win? If you
combine the road racing experience of the entire field minus the few
ringers, they would have less road racing experience than JPM. It is
equivalent to a Cy Young winner pitching in AA baseball. If you take
in account how he won it was be like that same Cy Young winner
pitching in an AA game and using a spitball.

No, he's still wrong.  He said JPM wouldn't win.  He did win.  Now we
can see that you are making excuses for the portly maroon known as
CHIM-CHIM.  Your response is the equivalent of Scooter Libby claiming
he couldn't remember outing Ms. Plame, and besides everyone knew she
was a operative.  The jury saw through his fraudulence for the obvious
fabrication and as a immaterial and insincere hoax, just like your
duplicity is plainly obvious to all those reading this thread.

BTW, how many Busch races did Tony Stewart, Jimmy Johnson and Jeff
Gordon enter prior to posting a win?

Ok, lets try some facts:

Who wan the Busch race in Mexico Sunday 4 March 2007?

Were there any errors identified in scoring that will be expected to
change the results?

Did another driver win and was subaequently disqualified?

Were full points awarded for the win?

The Busch regulars were there.  Just not many of the cup regulars that
compete in a lot of Busch races.

So what.  The bottom line is that JPM won and Carey made another mistake.

But that's so hard to comprehend.  King Carey is such an important
leading figure and world's leading expert in racing.  Just ask him.  He
is soooo important that he runs a touring car racing series.

And you defend that?

I hope you do not claim a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; questionable win in a support series as a major league win?
">

Would would you call it?  A loss in a major series race?

JPM won.  Are you having a little trouble dealing with reality?

If you

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; combine the road racing experience of the entire field minus the few
&gt; ringers, they would have less road racing experience than JPM. It is
&gt; equivalent to a Cy Young winner pitching in AA baseball.
">

So you are admitting that JPM significantly outclassed the field.  I
agree.  And he should have won.  He was hands down the class of the
field.  Bettering the hot shoe cup and Busch regular Denny Hamlin and
road racing ringer Boris Said.  Competing evenly against these two guys
on a road course would be a great accomplishment.  But JPM easily walked
away from them.

That certainly contradicts your statements diminishing his performance.

This is my point exactly.  But Carey said JPM wouldn't win anything.  He
was proven wrong in the first month of racing.  No excuses can deny that
fact.

But being an IRL supporter, I would expect history to be rewritten.

If you take

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; in account how he won it was be like that same Cy Young winner
&gt; pitching in an AA game and using a spitball.
">

So you're claiming that JPM was cheating?  I missed that report.  Could
you provide a link?

The big problem with the irrational EARLers is that JPM (in CART at the
time) went to one and only one IRL race and embarrassed ALL the IRL
drivers badly.  He gave them a driving lesson and sent them home
stunned.  Pure shock and awe.  So all the IRL weenies want JPM to fail.
They can't stand the thought of a CART driver that trounced their
heroes making it in the other oval track series.

So face reality, have a good cry since you have been publicly
embarrassed by your own silly post and hide until the dust settles.
Because unless he gets hurt, this will not be the last impressive finish
by Montoya this season.

I see you are ignorant of more than just motorsports. Not only did
Libby not out Plame as an operative, she wasn't an operative. She was
an information analyst. She was not an operative and even if she was.
To be in violation of the law she would have had to be operating
outside the USA with in the past 5 years. Which she was not. If you
wish to learn something it was Richard Armitage, a hold over from the
Clinton administration, that gave her identify to Novack. This bit of
information was known to the FBI and to Fitzgerald BEFORE the
investigation began. So the information that the investigation was to
uncover was already known before the investigation began. Fitzgerald
ignored this information and went on a witch hunt trying to connect it
to the White House. Once he could not do it he created a crime where
none existed.

Sorry ignoramus, she was an operative.  Also, Judith Miller of the New
York Times was specifically told that Valerie Plame was a CIA
operative by Libby.  The information that was disclosed at Libby's
meeting with Judith Miller was not declassified until ten days AFTER
their meeting.  As such, Libby not only out-ed Valerie Plame, but
violated the terms of his own clearance.  Ever have a clearance,
idiot?  I'm sure you don't now and never will.

"In her Grand Jury testimony on October 12, 2005, Judith Miller
produced a notebook from a previously-undisclosed meeting with Libby
on June 23, 2003, several weeks before Wilson's New York Times
editorial was published. According to Miller's notes from that earlier
meeting, Libby disclosed that Joseph Wilson's wife was a CIA employee
involved in her husband's trip to Niger. Miller's notebook from her
July 8, 2003 meeting with Libby contains the name "Valerie Flame
[sic]".This reference occurred six days before Novak published Plame's
name and unmasked her as a CIA "operative."  -- Russ Baker (The
Nation, March 31, 2005).

As a point of reference:
"There is the claim that the law to protect intelligence identities
could not have been violated because Valerie Wilson had not lived
overseas for six years. Too bad this is not what the law stipulates.
The law actually requires that a covered person "served" overseas in
the last five years. Served does not mean lived. In the case of
Valerie Wilson, energy consultant for Brewster-Jennings, she traveled
overseas in 2003, 2002, and 2001, as part of her cover job. She met
with folks who worked in the nuclear industry, cultivated sources, and
managed spies. She was a national security asset until exposed."   --
Former CIA officer Larry C. Johnson

And by the way, ignoramus, the US Court of Appeals concurred with Mr.
Johnson's interpretation.    The reason Libby wasn't charged under
Title 18, United States Code, Section 793 [the Espionage Act] or Title
50, United States Code, Section 421 [the Intelligence Identities
Protection Act] that by the language in the referenced codes, he would
have to "knowingly" out her in order to be charged under these codes.
It's a near impossible task to prove his knowledge, as you obviously
don't know from your rambling erroneous diatribe.

Libby's a convicted liar (perjury and obstruction expressly) who out-
ed a CIA operative, whether you like it or not.   If he didn't out
her, he wouldn't have had the need to cover his tracks through illegal
lies and deception.  Would he?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;She was not an operative and even if she was
">

Thanks for the contradiction.  So you recommend that folks go blabbing
about CIA business, even if exact laws were not broken. In this case
laws were broken, and one of the persons who committed these crimes
has been justifiably convicted; although it has been widely reported
that the jurors want to know why Rove and Cheney aren't also being
tried for their participation.

The man's name is Novak. Armitage has claimed to be the 'primary
source' of the leak to Novak.  It has no bearing on Libby's meeting
with Judith Miller. Nice try at deception.   See above, as to why you
are entirely wrong on this point.   Stop listening to morons like drug
addled Rush Limbaugh and you won't ceaselessly make these types of
errors.

So Libby was convicted of crimes he didn't commit?  You are in actual
fact a moron, and Libby's a convicted felon.   It's comforting to know
that you and you fellow 'conservatives' support Libby's (along with
his superiors) dangerously perfidious behaviors.

&gt; about CIA business, even if exact laws were not broken. In this case
&gt; laws were broken, and one of the persons who committed these crimes
&gt; has been justifiably convicted; although it has been widely reported
&gt; that the jurors want to know why Rove and Cheney aren't also being
&gt; tried for their participation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; To be in violation of the law she would have had to be operating
&gt; &gt; outside the USA with in the past 5 years. Which she was not. If you
&gt; &gt; wish to learn something it was Richard Armitage, a hold over from the
&gt; &gt; Clinton administration, that gave her identify to Novack.   T

&gt; The man's name is Novak. Armitage has claimed to be the 'primary
&gt; source' of the leak to Novak.  It has no bearing on Libby's meeting
&gt; with Judith Miller. Nice try at deception.   See above, as to why you
&gt; are entirely wrong on this point.   Stop listening to morons like drug
&gt; addled Rush Limbaugh and you won't ceaselessly make these types of
&gt; errors.

&gt; &gt; This bit of
&gt; &gt; information was known to the FBI and to Fitzgerald BEFORE the
&gt; &gt; investigation began. So the information that the investigation was to
&gt; &gt; uncover was already known before the investigation began. Fitzgerald
&gt; &gt; ignored this information and went on a witch hunt trying to connect it
&gt; &gt; to the White House. Once he could not do it he created a crime where
&gt; &gt; none existed.

&gt; So Libby was convicted of crimes he didn't commit?  You are in actual
&gt; fact a moron, and Libby's a convicted felon.   It's comforting to know
&gt; that you and you fellow 'conservatives' support Libby's (along with
&gt; his superiors) dangerously perfidious behaviors.- Hide quoted text -

Do you mean those same notes that Judith Miller could not remember
having until a year after her testimony to the grand jury and then
suddenly found in a box. I find it interesting that she goes from not
being able to recall any details about the meeting to suddenly finding
very detailed notes. So did she lie to the grand jury herself when she
said she could not remember details or did she lie the second time
when she changed her story.

By the way there is no such company as Brewster-Jennings. Wilson/Plame
listed it as her employer in her campaign contribution to the Gore and
Kerry campaigns. CIA requires that operatives list ACTUAL companies in
their covers. Anyone foolish to list a ficticious company as a cover
is bound to have their cover blown.

&gt; &gt; I see you are ignorant of more than just motorsports. Not only did
&gt; &gt; Libby not out Plame as an operative, she wasn't an operative. She was
&gt; &gt; an information analyst.

&gt; Sorry ignoramus, she was an operative. Also, Judith Miller of the New
&gt; York Times was specifically told that Valerie Plame was a CIA
&gt; operative by Libby. The information that was disclosed at Libby's
&gt; meeting with Judith Miller was not declassified until ten days AFTER
&gt; their meeting. As such, Libby not only out-ed Valerie Plame, but
&gt; violated the terms of his own clearance. Ever have a clearance,
&gt; idiot? I'm sure you don't now and never will.

&gt; &quot;In her Grand Jury testimony on October 12, 2005, Judith Miller
&gt; produced a notebook from a previously-undisclosed meeting with Libby
&gt; on June 23, 2003, several weeks before Wilson's New York Times
&gt; editorial was published. According to Miller's notes from that earlier
&gt; meeting, Libby disclosed that Joseph Wilson's wife was a CIA employee
&gt; involved in her husband's trip to Niger. Miller's notebook from her
&gt; July 8, 2003 meeting with Libby contains the name &quot;Valerie Flame
&gt; [sic]&quot;.This reference occurred six days before Novak published Plame's
&gt; name and unmasked her as a CIA &quot;operative.&quot; -- Russ Baker (The
&gt; Nation, March 31, 2005).

&gt; As a point of reference:
&gt; &quot;There is the claim that the law to protect intelligence identities
&gt; could not have been violated because Valerie Wilson had not lived
&gt; overseas for six years. Too bad this is not what the law stipulates.
&gt; The law actually requires that a covered person &quot;served&quot; overseas in
&gt; the last five years. Served does not mean lived. In the case of
&gt; Valerie Wilson, energy consultant for Brewster-Jennings, she traveled
&gt; overseas in 2003, 2002, and 2001, as part of her cover job. She met
&gt; with folks who worked in the nuclear industry, cultivated sources, and
&gt; managed spies. She was a national security asset until exposed.&quot;  --
&gt; Former CIA officer Larry C. Johnson

&gt; And by the way, ignoramus, the US Court of Appeals concurred with Mr.
&gt; Johnson's interpretation.  The reason Libby wasn't charged under
&gt; Title 18, United States Code, Section 793 [the Espionage Act] or Title
&gt; 50, United States Code, Section 421 [the Intelligence Identities
&gt; Protection Act] that by the language in the referenced codes, he would
&gt; have to &quot;knowingly&quot; out her in order to be charged under these codes.
&gt; It's a near impossible task to prove his knowledge, as you obviously
&gt; don't know from your rambling erroneous diatribe.

&gt; Libby's a convicted liar (perjury and obstruction expressly) who out-
&gt; ed a CIA operative, whether you like it or not.  If he didn't out
&gt; her, he wouldn't have had the need to cover his tracks through illegal
&gt; lies and deception. Would he?

Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates was a front company set up
in the mid-1990s by the CIA for Valerie Plame, a classified
status employee for the Agency ...

It later turned out that BJ&amp;A did exist for all intents and
purposes, listed on the Dun &amp; Bradstreet database of
company names. A spokeswoman for Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a
New Jersey operator of commercial databases, said Brewster
Jennings was first entered into its records on May 22, 1994,
but wouldn't discuss the source of the filing. Its records list the
company ... as a "legal services office," which could mean a
law firm, with annual sales of $60,000, one employee, and a
chief executive identified as "Victor Brewster, Partner."

'When she was abroad she had a more viable cover.'"
- Knight Ridder reported (19 October 2003):

... the front company, Brewster-Jennings &amp; Associates, the
name of which has been reported previously, apparently also
was used by other CIA officers whose work now could be
at risk, according to Vince Cannistraro, former CIA chief of
counterterrorism operations and analysis. Now, Plame's
career as a covert operations officer in the CIA's Directorate
of Operations is over. Those she dealt with -- on business or
not -- may be in danger. The directorate is conducting an
extensive damage assessment. And Plame's exposure may
make it harder for American spies to persuade foreigners to
share important secrets with them, U.S. intelligence officials
said.

Libby was found guilty of obstruction of justice, perjury and lying to
the FBI about his role in revealing the name of CIA employee Valerie
Plame to reporters.  He was found guilty because he committed these
crimes. Maybe you should try to un-bunch your panties and face up to
the truth of Libby's perfidy.  Please allow yourself a heartfelt cry
replete with alligator tears for Libby and the rest of the treasonous
bastards you support.

Why do you suppose Libby was convicted by a jury for perjury and
obstruction if he didn't in actual fact lie?
