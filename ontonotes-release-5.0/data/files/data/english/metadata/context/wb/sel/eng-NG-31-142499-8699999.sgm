Controversial Osprey aircraft deployed to Iraq

WASHINGTON - The first combat squadron of tilt-rotor V-22 Ospreys has
been quietly deployed to Iraq, ushering a new form of aerial
technology into 21st Century warfare.

A Marine Corps aviation squadron and 10 Ospreys left for Iraq on
Monday aboard the U.S.S. Wasp, a small Navy aircraft carrier known as
an amphibious assault ship, said Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Eric
Dent.

The departure from the New River Marine Corps Air Station near
Jacksonville, N.C., was made under extremely tight security with no
advance notice to the news media and no ceremonial speeches by Marine
Corps officials. ``It was just another workday for the squadron,''
Dent said.

Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 263, nicknamed ``The Thunder
Chickens,'' will be based at the Al Asad Airbase in western Iraq for
at least seven months of combat operations. The Marine Corps Ospreys,
known as MV-22s, will be used to ferry Marines as well as cargo
throughout predominately Sunni Muslim Anbar province.

Dent, citing ``operational security,'' offered only limited details
about the deployment and said he was not allowed to discuss the
timetable of the trip or scheduled arrival in Iraq. The V-22s, which,
in military-speak can ``self-deploy'' into war zones, could
conceivably leave the Wasp en route and make the rest of the journey
by air.
