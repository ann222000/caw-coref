Hi All: We just got our 6 month old lab spayed about 24 hours ago. All
went well. We've been very pleased with our vet, however, she was very
firm about post surgery activity levels. She recommends &quot;leash walks
only to eliminate outside for 10-14 days.&quot;

No fetch in the house, no running.

We are already beginning to feel that this may be impossible! We had
two other dogs spayed and don't recall enduring these strict post-op
instructions.

Have things really changed that much in the 10 years since we had our
last dog spayed?

Does anyone have any clever suggestion for how to stimulate this pup,
so we don't all go crazy?

Many thanks for your time.
Karen

Keep the dog restrained like they say the last thing you want is an
abdominal hernia from too much activity or the stitches coming out.  It's
just common sense to not let them run and romp around.

Changed?  As of 15.5 and 12 years ago, my vet gave the same 10-14
day restriction instructions for my dogs.

Take the opportunity to have lots and lots of short sessions
teaching basic obedience and &quot;tricks.&quot;  It will keep her mentally
occupied without giving her a lot of exercise.  Also a good time
to introduce a clicker as a secondary reinforcer into the
training, so that you're not feeding her a lot while teaching the
tricks.

Always good to have more food for thought!

Material that includes research data from 2006, 2005
was presented at ACC&amp;D's Third International Symposium,
and part of the slideshows presentedare available here:
http://www.acc-d.org/2006%20Symposium%20Docs/Session%20I.pdf

Issues regarding previous assumptions on what neutering
does as a 'benefit' are pretty well challenged in this data above.

Alliance for Contraception in Cats and Dogs (ACC&amp;D) is a
nonprofit 501C(3) group involved in attempting to study, define
and resolve some of the problems that currently exist
internationally as they regard issues of animal population control.

&quot;More than 120 representatives from universities, animal welfare
organizations, foundations, companies, and government agencies
from 11 countries gathered to share information and plan for the
future&quot;. Main site: http://www.acc-d.org/

&quot;On the negative side, neutering male dogs if done before maturity,
increases the risk of osteosarcoma (bone cancer) by a factor of 3.8;
this is a common ancer in medium/large and larger breeds with a
poor prognosis.

increases the risk of cardiac hemangiosarcoma by a factor of 1.6;
this is a common cancer and major cause of death in some breeds

triples the risk of hypothyroidism

increases the risk of geriatric cognitive impairment

triples the risk of obesity, a common health problem in dogs with
it the many associated health problems associated with obesity

· quadruples the small risk (&lt;0.6%) of prostate cancer

· doubles the small risk (&lt;1%) of urinary tract cancers

· increases the risk of orthopedic disorders

· increases the risk of adverse reactions to vaccinations

Hemangiosarcoma is a common cancer in dogs. It is a major
cause of death in some breeds, such as Salukis, French Bulldogs,
Irish Water Spaniels, Flat Coated Retrievers, Golden Retrievers,
Boxers, Afghan Hounds, English Setter, Scottish Terrier, Boston
Terrier, Bulldogs, and German Shepherd Dogs24.

In an aged-matched case controlled study, spayed females were
found to have a 2.2 times higher risk of splenic hemangiosarcoma
compared to intact females24.

A retrospective study of cardiac hemangiosarcoma risk factors
found a &gt;5 times greater risk in spayed female dogs compared
to intact female dogs and a 1.6 times higher risk in neutered male
dogs compared to intact male dogs.25

The authors suggest a protective effect of sex hormones against
hemangiosarcoma, especially in females.

In breeds where hermangiosarcoma is an important cause of
death, the increased risk associated with spay/neuter is likely
one that should factor into decisions on whether or when to
sterilize a dog.

Hypothyroidism

Spay/neuter in dogs was found to be correlated with a three fold
increased risk of hypothyroidism  compared to intact dogs. The
researchers suggest  a cause-and-effect relationship26.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
They wrote: &quot;More important [than the mild direct impact on thyroid
">

function] in the association between [spaying and] neutering and
hypothyroidism may be the effect of sex hormones on the immune
system.

Castration increases the severity of autoimmune thyroiditis in mice&quot;
which may explain the link between spay/neuter and hypothyroidism
in dogs.

&quot;Dr. Spain, who has been recently involved in many studies assessing
the long-term risks and benefits of early-age neutering, presented
convincing data about the effects of spay/neuter on hip dysplasia,
cranial cruciate ligament rupture, long bone development, body weight,
diabetes, urinary tract infections, mammary cancer, and several other
conditions.&quot;

CONCLUSIONS

An objective reading of the veterinary medical literature reveals
a complex situation with respect to the longterm health impacts
of spay/neuter in dogs.

The evidence shows that spay/neuter correlates with both positive
AND adverse health effects in dogs. It also suggests how much we
really do not yet understand about this subject.

On balance, it appears that no compelling case can be made for
neutering most male dogs to prevent future health problems,
especially immature male dogs. The number of health problems
associated with neutering may exceed the associated health
benefits in most cases.

I may have been &quot;lucky&quot; with &quot;Lucky&quot; during her post-spay period. She was
kept fairly quiet during the first 24 hours after surgery, and I was not
there to observe. I took her to my home the next evening, accompanied by my
friend (who is a nurse), and we allowed her and my dog Muttley some
unleashed time in a fenced yard. We called them back when they started to
run and play, however.

For the next couple of days, I was fairly careful, but still allowed both
dogs free run of the house. She was in a kennel for one day, but then back
home, and I again allowed both dogs free run of the house, even while I was
away. Both of them seemed fairly sedate, however. I'm sure a Lab puppy is
much more active, and that could be a problem.

My trainer suggested that cutting back or eliminating the pain medication
might help keep her less active, so she would feel any pain and
automatically restrict her movements. Also, my friend has used Benedryl to
calm dogs down, and my vet confirmed that this was OK, at a dose of 1
mg/lb. I gave her one 25 mg gelcap (wrapped in cream cheese), and it may
have helped, even though three would have been about as recommended for her
70 lb. I would urge you to check with your vet before trying either of
these ideas. Please!

I think some vets are more cautious than others, and it also probably
depends on the size of the incision, the type of sutures, and the general
size and health of the dog. You can read some of the discussion about
Lucky's &quot;disintaction&quot; in the still active thread I posted 7/24/07. It is
important to examine the incision every day, looking for redness, swelling,
oozing, or sensitivity. I was also told that I should monitor her
temperature daily, looking for anything over a dog's normal 101-102. I did
not feel comfortable about sticking a probe in her butt, so I skipped this
precaution, but sometimes a spay can cause peritonitis, which is a
potentially deadly abdominal infection. Again, ask your vet.

Your trainer sounds pretty sadistic to me.  Have YOU tried
cutting back on your post-op pain meds, so that the pain informs
you when you're trying to do too much?  Please do try it the next

IME the 10-14 day restriction is standard, on printed post-op
forms that the vets hand out for every spay patient (e.g., for
the typical healthy young dogs who are spayed).  If the dog has
health problems, the vet will increase the restrictions.

Get over it.  You are responsible for monitoring the health of
the dogs in your care.  If you can't do what's necessary, you
shouldn't take on the responsibility.  At some time in the future
Muttley may have an illness that requires you to monitor his
temperature, or clean up his puke or diarrhea, or give him an
injection.  Will you refuse to take on these less-than-fun jobs
because you're not comfortable?

IMO, a little pain ain't so bad, if it helps to keep the animal
immobile (helping to avoid the potential for serious repercussions).

Presumably, that makes me a &quot;sadist,&quot; too.

Wouldn't the two go together?  In my experience, anything strong enough
to relieve pain is strong enough to make me drowsy to the point of immobile.

I agree that a little pain isn't so bad, but we don't know what an
animal is feeling to that fine a point.  Then there's the business of
how people and probably animals respond to pain and medications
differently.  I'll put up with quite a lot of pain because I hate the
stoned feeling of drugs more.  (I surprised my dentists when I said I
preferred to get my fillings replaced all at once and without novocaine.
It hurt, but I made the right decision.  Novocaine hurts worse.)

We know that post-op must hurt, and we know what a whimper means, but
we don't have the 1-10 scale that human hospital patients have.  It
makes sense to me to medicate for pain AND keep the dog from hurting
herself from trying to do too much.

It was so long ago that I don't remember what the veterinarian
recommended for Genny when she was spayed.  It couldn't have given me
too much trouble.  I would have remembered that.  Thinking about it now,
how hard could keeping a dog quiet and in a crate for 2 weeks be?  If
you need to walk the dog, you walk her slowly on a leash.  I guess there
are dogs who go ballistic in a crate so it might take some doing.

Not necessarily.  It's one thing to totally knock a dog out, and
something else to just knock the sharp edges off.  And keeping a dog
in a stupor doesn't usually bode well for recovery.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In my experience, anything strong enough

Do you get drowsy after taking a few aspirins, NSAIDS, etc?

I don't.

&gt;I agree that a little pain isn't so bad, but we don't know what an

I think we can make some fairly accurate assumptions, even keeping in

&gt;Then there's the business of

Chemotherapy, for example.  Dogs appear to tolerate it much better
than humans do.

But what we can't do is to just tell a dog to go slow, don't do any
running, jumping, etc.

We can either lock them up in a crate or basically knock them out.

Or let a little pain help do the talking for us.

Not the best choices, granted, but pretty much the only ones we have.

And dogs can still do some pretty stupid things (with respect to
further injuring themselves) while locked away in a crate, too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'll put up with quite a lot of pain because I hate the
&gt;stoned feeling of drugs more.  (I surprised my dentists when I said I

&gt;  It hurt, but I made the right decision.  Novocaine hurts worse.)
">

I happen to enjoy that &quot;stoned feeling&quot; and don't have a hard time
wondering how so many people can become addicted to painkillers,
recreational drugs, etc.

I have an agreement with my dentist, for example:  No gas, no money.

Heh.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;   We know that post-op must hurt, and we know what a whimper means, but

&gt;herself from trying to do too much.
">

Well, that's kind of a balancing act, if you ask me.  You want the dog
to remain relatively immobile (but not too immobile).

Again, a dog can do some pretty dumb things in a crate.

Some movement is usually a &quot;good thing,&quot; to get those muscles and
joints working again, to help prevent the buildup of scar tissue, etc.
And that's where the leash comes in.  But a little pain will still
help to prevent the dog from doing something stupid while on a leash.

&gt;how hard could keeping a dog quiet and in a crate for 2 weeks be?

Have you ever tried it with a particularly hard-charging dog?

Well, I urge you to give it a go sometime and then let me know how it

Yes, absolutely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, it can take some doing.

Yes, it can be done.

And a *little* pain can only help, IMO.

I myself suffer daily pain (from old football and wrestling injuries),
and that pain helps to remind me that I'm not 25 anymore. And that I
should start acting my age. I usually only take painkillers at night,
to help me get to sleep.

But if I didn't know how addicted I could become to, say, morphine,
and I could get a doctor to write the script, I'd probably hook myself
up to a morphine drip each night.

Heh.

&lt;&lt; I may have been &quot;lucky&quot; with &quot;Lucky&quot; during her post-spay period.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

No maybes about it, you WERE lucky because you didn't follow ANY of
the commonsense precautions.

&lt;&lt; For the next couple of days, I was fairly careful &gt;&gt;

You say you were careful, and yet you allowed her free roam of the
house, allowed her to jump up and down on the bed, allowed her to play
offlead with Muttley, fed two strange dogs together, and so on.  Nope,
absolutely NOTHING careful about how you handled Lucky.

&lt;&lt; My trainer suggested that cutting back or eliminating the pain
medication might help keep her less active, so she would feel any pain
and automatically restrict her movements. &gt;&gt;

Some people do recommend this.  I don't buy into it.  Dogs and cats
don't have the same reasoning skills that we do and they don't relate
pain to activity like we do.  By the time they feel pain, the damage
may have already been done, particularly in dogs with very high
physical pain thresholds or that are very high drive.  (A dog with a
high prey drive will take off after the bunny or squirrel before the
pain registers).  The bottom line is that if the dog has been given
proper restrictions, there is no need to depend on them to restrict
themselves.

And there IS a good deal of evidence that lowered pain will help to
expedite heeling.

&lt;&lt; my friend has used Benedryl to calm dogs down &gt;&gt;

Again, there are better ways to handle this.  Teaching static
obedience exercises like stays or low activity skills like scent
discrimination or targeting are good ways to tire the dog out
mentally, which is usually what is needed far more than physical
activity.  No, it's no fun for dog or human to have the dog crated and
under leash restrictions, but being the responsible party isn't always
fun.

Here's a question for you.  When you catch cold or get hayfever type
allergies, what do you think of Sudafed?  The question comes from a
television special on methamphetamine.  Jim and I were watching it.  The
first part of the program made meth sound terrific.  It was practically
an ad.  When they got to the part about how it's the same basic
ingredient in a decongestant, Jim and I looked at each other and
admitted that we like antihistamines like Chlortrimeton and Benedryl,
but tried Sudafed in the distant past, hated it, and never tried it
again.  Maybe it dried us out, but it increased the sinus headache too
and made us feel all over icky.  I'd rather sneeze.  That made us wonder
if meth works for some people and doesn't do much for others.

I've been wondering about addiction for the longest time.  My father is
like you.  He likes gas at the dentist.  We worry about addiction when
he's hospitalized.  My mother and I keep turning down drugs.  It's not
from virtue, I don't think.  I'm wondering if there are some people who
could get addicted because their makeup is such that the potential for
addiction was there before exposure to the addictive drug.  Might others
be less prone to addiction because, even in the face of personality
traits and life events that would draw them to drugs, they don't
experience a high in the same way?

Or here's another example.  After Jim's emergency gall bladder surgery
in June, he was prescribed Percoset.  More than half of the prescription
remained unused until he asked the doctor what he should do with it.
After the pain was gone, he had no use for it.  He just didn't like the
way it made him feel.

There's a growing body of evidence for genetic factors playing a

In fact, there is a real possibility that Lucky is now acting out in her
recent behaviors as a result of this pain. It's all so soon post
surgery. The behavior changes occurred post surgery.

Reka has suddenly become a little snarky (no fights.. just snarky )
towards Tuck. This is an established relationship. I took Reka to the
vet. I couldn't find anything wrong. Reka and Tuck play hard together.
Reka has soreness in her shoulder that I never caught watching her move.
She probably hurt something playing with Tuck a few days ago. For the
next 10 days, Reka and Tuck may not play together.

When there is a change in behavior.. see the vet.
Lucky has a reason to be sore for months to come.
She had wreckless and poor post surgical care. She had major abdominal
surgery.
Paul is concerned about a change of behavior with Lucky.

2 + 2 = ?

This subject came up when Jim was hospitalized in Fort Lauderdale.
There was a sign in the rooms explaining how unlikely it is for people
to get addicted to opiates, even large amounts, over short periods of
time.  The danger is in smaller amounts for longer periods of time.  The
signs went on to tell patients to be sure to tell their doctors if they
had a history of drug addiction.  I believe the fear is in re-addicting
someone who has kicked the habit.

If one has a very low threshold of pain, then pain meds might be
appropriate, but I think many people expect to go through life pain-free
and freak out or shut down when there is some pain. It is possible to
acknowledge pain and then continue to function, but the discomfort serves
as a reality check. I have learned to live with some level of pain from my
arthritic bone-on-bone knee, and sciatica from congenital spinal stenosis,
and it just serves to limit my activity enough to know when to stop. I only
occasionally use NSAIDs; other people I know have ruined their stomachs by
eating lots of Ibuprofen every day so they could do further damage to their
bodies. I also sometimes have dental work done without novacaine, and I
have had colonoscopies without sedation (as they are often performed in
Europe). When I had major abdominal surgery, the nurse noticed that I was
not using my self-inflicted morphine button very much, and pressed it for
me. It hurt, but I expected it to.

I did regularly apply light pressure around the area of Lucky's incision to
see if there was any reaction. If it really hurt, I would think she would
have shown some sign of discomfort. But she only twitched a little bit when
I touched the actual sutures, which are just for the skin.

When my surgeon delayed the removal of the staples from my abdomen, I
remarked that I wouldn't want to be spilling my guts in the parking lot. He
said that the stitches inside, holding the muscle tissue were not the
problem, but just the external ones holding the skin together. I would
assume it is a similar situation with a dog.

Furpaw, I agree.  There *is* an optimum level of medication, and IMO,
that level is enough to take the edge off.

As in, a &quot;little pain ain't so bad.&quot;  And it isn't.

With emphasis on the word &quot;little.&quot;

Enough pain to help prevent foolish, dangerous acts while moving
around, etc., but not enough where the dog is actually suffering.

And most vets are pretty good at finding that point.

I think your use of the word sadistic is extremely inappropriate.
Unless, of course, you actually do think that this trainer, and many,
many veterinarians who would agree with him, and myself, actually

About pain meds and spay and neutering.  I don't recall being given pain
meds for those surgeries.  The last 2 were neuters via the
Neuter-Commuter.  You receive a chip, Rabies shot, and sterilization for

Lady was spayed 14 years ago at a regular Vet and I don't recall pain
meds.  I guess if they gave them to me I would give them to my dog, at
least at first.  Then I would try to eye-ball them and decide whether
and how much.  After all, a dog can't let me know whether they opt for
pain meds or not.  I would like to think I know a dog well enough to
know if they are in pain.  Hopefully, that is true.
Myself, I am no hero.  Give me the pain meds for abdominal surgery.

&gt; It's one thing to totally knock a dog out,

Kinda like HOWE you do when you HANG
a dog accordin to your koehler book, tommy?:

&quot;The Koehler Method of Dog Training (1962).  New York:
Howell Book Book House(p. 52-53).&quot;

Hanging

&quot;First, the trainer makes certain that the collar
and leash are more than adequate for any jerk
or strain that the dog's most frantic actions could
cause.  Then he starts to work the dog deliberately
and fairly to the point where the dog makes his grab.

Before the teeth have reached their target,
the dog, weight permitting, is jerked from
the ground.

As in coping with some of the afore-mentioned
problems the dog is suspended in mid-air.

However, to let the biting dog recover
his footing while he still had the strength
to renew the attack would be cruelty.

The only justifiable course is to hold him
suspended until he has neither the strength
nor inclination to renew the fight.

When finally it is obvious that he is
physically incapable of expressing his
resentment and is lowered to the ground,
he will probably stagger loop-legged for a
few steps, vomit once or twice, and roll
over on his side.

The sight of a dog lying, thick-tongued,
on his side, is not pleasant, but do not
let it alarm you

THE REAL &quot;HOOD&quot;

&quot;If your dog is a real &quot;hood&quot; who would
regard the foregoing types of protest as
&quot;kid stuff&quot; and would express his
resentment of your efforts by biting,
your problem is difficult -- and pressing.

&quot;Professional trainers often get these
extreme problems. Nearly always the
&quot;protest biter&quot; is the handiwork of a
person who, by avoiding situations that
the dog might resent, has nurtured the
seeds of rebellion and then  cultivated
the resultant growth with under correction.

When these people reap their inevitable
and oftentimes painful harvest, they are
ready to avail themselves of &quot;the cruel
trainer&quot; whose advice they may have
once rejected because it was incompatible
with the sugary droolings of mealy-
mouthed columnists, breed-ring biddies,
and dog psychologists who, by the
broken skins and broken hearts their
misinformation causes, can be proven guilty
of the greatest act of cruelty to animals
since the dawn of time.

&quot;With more genuine compassion for the
biting dog than would ever be demonstrated
by those who are &quot;too kind&quot; to make a
correction and certainly with more disregard
for his safety, the professional trainer
morally feels obligated to perform a &quot;major
operation.&quot;

&quot;Since we are presently concerned with
the dog that bites in resentment of the
demands of training, we will set our
example in that situation.  (In a later
chapter we will deal with the with the
much easier problem of the dog that
bites someone other than his master.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and something else to just knock the sharp edges off.
">

Oh, you mean kinda like HOWE you do when
you're trainin a dog not to jump on you?:

LIKE THIS:

&quot;I don't know how big you are, kiddo, so this may
not be as easy for you as it is for me, but use
a little &quot;knee action,&quot; that is, as the dog goes
charging by you, just give the dog a little bop
with your knee and shin.  Yep, really lean into it.

Even knock her over, if you can, but make sure to
make her think twice about rushing past you again -
- which is exactly what you want her to do.

Don't bother with scolding her, she'll get the message.

If it happens again, just REPEAT the knee action.

When she steps on your toes, just pick up your foot
abruptly and nudge her with your knee.  Again, no
scolding is necessary here, so you don't have to
worry about her &quot;over-reacting.&quot;

I don't think this is necessarily a lack of respect
for you, just a lack of training.  That is, she just
needs *more* of it.&quot;

&quot;My objective is always to find a way that WORKS.
And if it is DANGEROUS behavior that I'm trying
to modify, behavior than can get the dog KILLED,
I will resort to ANYTHING to save him.

A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.

Okay.  Call me a cruel, inhumane, abusive bastard
if you want to, but it doesn't affect me at all.
When you've saved the lives of as many dogs as I
have, you'll learn that that's the only thing that
really matters.  Saving lives and making dogs become
good citizens

At no time do the Monks *ever* advocate beating a
dog. A swat on the rump or a check to the chin does
*not* constitute a &quot;beating.&quot;

&gt; Neuter-Commuter.  You receive a chip, Rabies shot, and sterilization
&gt; for 25.00.
&gt; Lady was spayed 14 years ago at a regular Vet and I don't recall pain
&gt; meds.  I guess if they gave them to me I would give them to my dog, at
&gt; least at first.  Then I would try to eye-ball them and decide whether
&gt; and how much.  After all, a dog can't let me know whether they opt for
&gt; pain meds or not.  I would like to think I know a dog well enough to
&gt; know if they are in pain.  Hopefully, that is true.
&gt; Myself, I am no hero.  Give me the pain meds for abdominal surgery.

Scooter just got neutered.  He was a very different dog at first.  It
didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that he was in pain and
also exhausted from the procedure.  He came home with anti-inflammatory
pain meds, but even if he hadn't, I would have asked for some or given
him some of Faith's doggie aspirin.  It was heartbreaking to see him go
back to flop around morose state when he had grown into dervish dog.  I
must admit that the break from constantly worrying about what he might
get up to next was kind of nice.  Even when he was obviously not in as
much pain, he wasn't himself and did a lot better when on pain meds.  I
kept him on them until he was up to par and found other ways to keep him
from running around full tilt and wrestling with Sammie.  Even a fairly
new dog is easy to know, but knowing how dogs can hide pain and how
tempting it can be to go do a favorite activity now and pay the price in
pain later, I'd rather play it safe than be sorry.

&lt;&lt; In fact, there is a real possibility that Lucky is now acting out
in her recent behaviors as a result of this pain. &gt;&gt;

Gee, ya think?  (dripping sarcasm here)  Seems like he was already
warned about that a time or two, as part of the advice on how to
handle her post-surgery.

&lt;&lt; When there is a change in behavior.. see the vet. &gt;&gt;

Yup.

Interestingly enough, I discovered a few years ago that Shy is most
reactive to other animals just before and after a seizure.  Makes
perfect sense of course - she's not feeling well so is going to be
defensive, plus I suspect her vision gets a bit wonky right about then
making her feel even more vulnerable.  And now that I know, her
behavior can be another sign of impending seizure activity, so I know
to keep an eye on her.

&lt;&lt; It is possible to acknowledge pain and then continue to function,
but the discomfort serves as a reality check. I have learned to live
with some level of pain from my arthritic bone-on-bone knee, and
sciatica from congenital spinal stenosis, and it just serves to limit
my activity enough to know when to stop. &gt;&gt;

We are not talking about an ongoing condition such as HD, arthritis,
spondelosis, etc.  In something like that the dogs do learn to limit
themselves to some extent, but still need monitoring to see that they
don't overdo.  Dogs with high prey drives or toy drives will
frequently overextend themselves because when they're in drive,
physical pain doesn't register.  And when it does, it's too late.  In
general, dogs are programmed to be stoic.  Weak dogs, dogs showing
vulnerability (ie pain), are susceptible.

&lt;&lt; When I had major abdominal surgery, the nurse noticed that I was
not using my self-inflicted morphine button very much, and pressed it
for me. It hurt, but I expected it to. &gt;&gt;

As a human I would hope that you could reason that surgery = pain.
That isn't something dogs can pair together all that easily.

Did the nurses kick you out of bed the day after the surgery and have
you run up and down the hallways?  Did they have you climbing stairs?
Did they have you jump up and down off a really high bed?  Or did they
have you move slowly, and in limited amounts, with exercise increasing
at a slow, graduated pace?

In cases of surgery, by the time the dog would feel pain, the damage
has already been done.  The sutures have already ripped, the bloodclot
already released.  You can NOT rely on the dog to limit themselves.
That is pure foolishness, and frankly laziness as well.

&lt;&lt; I did regularly apply light pressure around the area of Lucky's
incision to see if there was any reaction. If it really hurt, I would
think she would have shown some sign of discomfort. But she only
twitched a little bit when I touched the actual sutures, which are
just for the skin. &gt;&gt;

What part of stoic don't you understand?  My oldest aussie had major
abdominal surgery and I can tell you that she was in pain, but when
touched didn't indicate pain to anyone but me.  Me, because I've had
her so long, worked so much with her, am so in tune, that I can pick
up on the most subtle clues in her behavior.  You don't have that with
Lucky, not even close.  And by your comments about how you like dogs
that aren't needy and don't want much time with you, you never will
have that relationship with any dog.  What a shame.

Besides which you are still MISSING THE POINT that keeping the dog
quiet (not running around) is not just for stitches, but also blood
clots.

&lt;&lt;  When my surgeon delayed the removal of the staples from my
abdomen, I remarked that I wouldn't want to be spilling my guts in the
parking lot. He said that the stitches inside, holding the muscle
tissue were not the problem, but just the external ones holding the
skin together. I would assume it is a similar situation with a dog. &gt;&gt;

And there you go ASSuming again.  It's dangerous to ASSume, and
sometimes deadly.

&lt;&lt;  One reason for pain meds following surgery in humans is to allow
the patient to move around enough to regain muscle strength and avoid
blood clots and pneumonia. &gt;&gt;

Absolutely.  And in dogs, some movement is necessary as they have to
move to potty and intake water &amp; food.  A little bit of quiet, slow
movement is good.  Fast, jerky, jumping, etc. is very bad.
