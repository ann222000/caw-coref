Prout Gems

An examination of the 4th principle of PROUT

If a particular person is endowed with all three potentialities
(physical, mental and spiritual) and if only their physical services
are utilized, then they may not be able to serve the society with their
intellectual or spiritual potentialities. So there should be proper
adjustment in the process of encouraging service from individuals or
collective bodies.

Here &quot;proper&quot; means progressive. According to PROUT's law of adjustment
one should utilize mostly that potential which is most subtle in a
person, and only secondarily the less subtle one. The utilization of
subtler and more rare potentials should always be preferred.

The 4th fundamental principle of Prout states:

&quot;There should be a proper adjustment amongst these physical,
metaphysical, mundane, supramundane and spiritual utilizations.&quot;

Purport: While promoting individual and collective welfare there should
be proper adjustment amongst the physical, mental and spiritual and the
crude, subtle and causal factors. For example, society has the
responsibility of meeting the minimum necessities of every individual
but if society arranges food and builds a house for everyone under the
impetus of this responsibility, individual initiative becomes retarded.
People will gradually become lethargic. Therefore society has to make
such arrangements so that people, in exchange for their labour
according to their capacity, can earn the money they require to
purchase the minimum necessities. In order to raise the level of
minimum necessities of people the best policy is to enhance their
purchasing capacity.

The law of adjustment further stipulates that while taking services
from a person who is physically, mentally and spiritually developed,
society should follow a balanced policy of adjustment. If only one of
these three capacities - physical, mental or spiritual - is developed
in a person, society should take the one that is developed. If both
physical and intellectual capacities are sufficiently developed in a
person, society should adopt the policy of adjustment, which takes more
intellectual service and less physical service, because intellectual
power is comparatively subtle and rare. If all three capacities -
physical, mental and spiritual - are found in one person, society
should make greatest use of their spiritual service and least of their
physical service.

The greatest service to the cause of social welfare can be rendered by
those who have acquired spiritual power, and the next service by those
having intellectual power. Those having physical power, though not
negligible, cannot do anything by themselves. Whatever they do is done
under the instructions of those with intellectual and spiritual power.
Hence the responsibility of social control should not be in the hands
of those who have great physical capacity, or in the hands of those
endowed with courage, or in the hands of those who are intellectually
developed, or in the hands of those with worldly skills. Social control
should be in the hands of those who are spiritual aspirants,
intelligent and brave all at the same time. (See Ananda Sutram 1962 by
Shrii Shrii Anandamurti / P R Sarkar)

In this regard one must ask, what can quench the human apiration?

If land is bountiful and per capita income is very high, does it mean
that the all-round micro-psychic conations or the all-round
micro-psychic aspirations of the people are fully quenched or not?
That is, taking the human entity as a microcosm, will their aspirations
be quenched by physical and then psychic longings and gains?

The answer must be no. To quench the all-round micro-psychic longings
of the people, there must be the following:
- Psycho-spiritual education. As there can be balkanization of society
if there is no psycho-spiritual education, eg this is evident by
fighting between religions.
- Rule by moralists and people of ethical calibre based on universal
cardinal human values.
- A balanced structure. Eg in the political structure at least the
three arms of government - legislature, executive, judicial.
- Ever-increasing purchasing power. If the per capita income is $500
and the price of acquiring food per year is $800, the condition of the
people will be very bad.

It is essential also that there be the availability of minimum
essentialities of life.

The availability of minimum essentialities of life plays a vital part
not only in achieving world fraternity but also in the development of
human personality. Every human being has certain minimum requirements,
which must be guaranteed to him or her. Guaranteed availability of
foodstuffs, clothing, medical assistance and housing or accommodation
should be arranged, so that people may be able to use their surplus
energy - energy up till now engaged in procuring the necessities of
life - in subtler pursuits. Side by side, there should be sufficient
scope for providing other amenities of the progressive age. To fulfill
the above responsibilities, sufficient purchasing capacity should be
created. If the supply of requirements be guaranteed without any
conditions of personal skill and labor, the individual may develop the
psychology of idleness.

The minimum requirements of every person are the same, but diversity is
also the nature of creation. Special amenities should therefore be
provided, so that diversity in skill and intelligence is fully utilized
and talent is encouraged to contribute its best for human development.
It will therefore be necessary to make provision for special
emoluments, which can cater for special amenities of life according to
the age and times. But at the same time there should be constant effort
to reduce the gap between the amount of special emoluments and the bare
minimum requirements of the average individual. The guaranteed supply
of minimum requirements must be liberalized by increasing the provision
of special amenities pertaining to the age and also simultaneously
bringing about a decrease in the provision of special emoluments given
to the few. The never-ending effort of proper economic adjustment must
ceaselessly continue at all times with a view to assisting the
spiritual, mental and physical evolution of humanity, and letting
humanity develop a Cosmic sentiment for a Cosmic ideal and world
fraternity.

In this socio-conomic set-up humanity is at full liberty in the
spiritual and mental spheres. This is possible because the spiritual
and psychic entities for which people can aspire are themselves
unlimited and the extent of possession in this sphere does not hamper
the progress of others in their quests. But supply in the physical
sphere is limited and hence any effort for disproportionate or
unrestricted acquisition of physical objects has every possibility of
creating a vast majority of have nots, thus hampering the spiritual,
mental and physical growth of the larger majority. So while dealing
with the problem of liberty in physical sphere, it must not be allowed
to cross a limit where it is instrumental in hampering the development
of the complete personality of humanity - and at the same time must not
be so drastically curtailed that the spiritual, mental and physical
growth of human beings is hampered.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From Idea and Ideology

"/> One pertinent question is whether both a ceiling on landed property and
a ceiling on bank balances have to be imposed. It goes without saying
that both methods have to be adopted, but the latter should precede the
former. This will bring immediate cash to the government to help
establish new industries on the one hand, and it will check the growth
of capitalism on the other. By enforcing land ceilings no direct
benefit can be expected to accrue to the nation because the available
arable land will not be increased, nor will production be increased,
since it is not the function of the government to cultivate land. Such
an approach would wound the public sentiment and the public would think
that the state had replaced the big landowners (zamindars). In the face
of food shortages it is not advisable to change land policies
immediately.
