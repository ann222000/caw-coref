For monetary reasons probably.  The country has shifted radically to the
right in the last few years, so she's targeting a larger audience, which
translates into more cha-ching.

Well, it's more like she went BACK... she was raised catholic and
decided to be devout again.

I heard that it was after her husband died, and then she had an
operation for intestinal blockage and SHE nearly died, that she had her
'conversion'.

I actually had that same operation last year. I didn't know at the time
how serious it was, but yeah, people have died from it. However, it
didn't have that effect on me. After reading the anne rice story in the
NY times, I had this image of myself jumping off the bed in the recovery
room and going "oy oy oy" and doing some sort of Hassidic dance.

She's already given another explanation, and I don't see any reason to doubt
her. It makes sense. Lots of people become more religious as they get older,
and she's been interested in religion for a long time anyway. And don't
forget how much Xianity she already put into Memnoch (which certainly would
turn off religious Xians for other reasons). I don't think that America has
shifted that much, and she has readers in other countries besides that
certainly have not become more religious. If she were really interested in
increasing sales she could start by getting an editor and accepting some
constructive criticism.

I wonder how this will affect her relationship with her son (who is
also a published author)
He's openly gay and has been out about his preferences since
highschool. He has to be disappointed that she's re-embraced the Roman
Catholic religion.

To all of you for whom this seems to be a big surprise....where have
you all been the last 10 years. Ever since Memnoch the Doorstop, we've
watch Rice throw more and more of her religious beliefs into the VC.
Blood Canticle was practically a homage to sainthood and Juan Diego.
This isn't new she just using it in a different vein...no pun
insteaded. Personally, I'm going to pass on this one. I don't have
issue with her religious renewal or the subject matter. I have a
problem with Rice's attitude torward her fan-base and her refusal to
employ an editor.
Take care,
Ashe

I don't think that her son being gay has affected there relationship.
She has never openly said anything negative about her son being gay.
Look at the characters she has written and how many of them at one
point or another are involved in same sex relationships.  And many
people who are in organised religion's disagree with the religion's
stance on certain issue's but they still worship.

I'm always fascinated by the RCC members.  I had an uncle who took a tumble
off of a roof and thought he was going to die.  What was one of the first
things he did.  Call in a priest to confess and last rights.  No matter that
he hadn't seen the inside of a church in 30 years and lived less than a xian
life style; drunkard, womanizer, gambler and lousy husband and father.

Guess what?  After he recovered he went right back to his old ways never
went back to church, etc.  Eventually, he dropped dead from a heart attack.
Wasn't time to confess and last rights.  Wonder were he resides today?
Cemetery just like everybody else!

I doubt her reconnection to her Catholic faith is for monetary
reasons. The broad is a frigging millionaire. She has a number of real
estate holdings in Florida and now lives in California-- and it sure
isn't a trailer park she's living in.

Perhaps her " converison" is legit, perhaps its a Bob Dylan publicity
conversion thing. After all she is selling a novel about Jesus as a
boy.

But if Rice becomes a damned fundy and denounces her vampire
chronicles books,  she better return all the money she's made off of
them.

Ohh, how I miss Nicholas, Lacroix and Janette.

Anyway, she did not convert she is  a born Catholic.  Through the years
all the chronicles have been chock full of religious symbolism starting
with Louis's brother being a religious fanatic in  Interview.   For
anyone who is interested much of the Old Testament(jewish) was referred
to in Memnoch as well as the New Testament. For instance, "sheol" is the
original Hell. Simply a place the dearly departed went to before the
Christians came along and added the fire and brimstone.

I'm Catholic and I find that it is the Southern Baptist and Pentecostal
types who are the least tolerant. Perhaps the Vatican is intolerant,
but the Church (meaning its members) is quite a wide varied group and
can be very accepting and understanding, as Jesus was with those who
lived less than perfect lives.

It's been a long time since I posted here and have somewhat been
lurking again for a lil while but I felt I must add in my 2 cents.

If you look on Anne's website you can find where she has stated why she
has returned to her faith and her personal views on the gays. Here's
some snippets. If you want the full versions just go to
www.annerice.com

::Snip, Snip::
"Regarding my return to the Catholic Church in 1998, this had nothing
to do with my husband's illness, as he did not become ill till four
years later. And it had nothing to do with my own illness in 1998 which
happened afterwards.
My return to faith is described in The Author's Note as well. It was
not something that happened over night. It came about over a period of
years.
I make these statements because as I check out the blogs at night, I'm
amazed at the momentum of false statements about me and the book and
the opinions generated by these false statements. There is something
frightening about seeing the same mistaken assumption repeated over and
over again from blog to blog. Of course this chatter will undoubtedly
die down at some point, and it may or may not affect the fate of the
book in the Public Square. Whatever the case, if you've followed me

If I were Rice, I wouldn't hold my breath. The RCC is about to put
forward a document stating that gays should be barred from attending
seminery as they are considered "unfit" for the priesthood. The RCC has
gone as far to say that gays are responsible for the sex sandal, as
well. There is no reason to believe that the RCC is going to be anymore
welcoming of gays in the future than they are now-whether it is the lay
person or one seeking to become clergy.
Take care,

Shadow Eagle,
The RCC hasn't allowed priests to marry since about the 5th century,
give or take, so it's been quite a while. Btw, this began has a
political/financial move on the part of the Church, not a theological
move. Simply put, the Church didn't want to support a priest's widow
and children in the event he died so they disallowed marriage for
priests. And lest anyone think the RCC cold and heartless they gave it
a theological veneer, but it was purely financial.
Of course, this didn't stop some from having families, Roderigo Borgia
aka Pope Alexander VI had three children with his mistress, but as long
as the relationship and any children that came out of it were
illegitimate the Church had no responsiblity towards any of them. Btw,
the Borgias were also one of the first crime families to exist.
Take care,
Ashe

You're probably right. The RCC wants to be a leader, not a follower. And
really, how much value is there in a religion if it changes its principles
to fit with the prevailing views of the day? I'll concede it can have some
value, as a social stabilizer, but in terms of real truth and morality? If
the Church changes its views now, then either

a) it was correct before and now it's just telling people what they want to
hear, in which case it shouldn't be trusted
b) It was wrong before and shouldn't have been trusted then and probably
still shouldn't
c) what's G-d wants from us changes over time

I can see this last option being true on a smaller scale, but probably not
on such a fundamental issue as this. Is this what Catholics think though? I
think though that even if they did it wouldn't explain their apologies for
their behavior during various past events, like the Crusades and the
Holocaust, to which we'd have to say a) or b).

thanks Ashe,
my mistake, i thought Roderigo was married, i knew he had all those
kids, as did quite of few of the other popes. (popes were better when
they were fighters and led the church like generals). i knew at some
point there was a change about the chasity issue that had nothing to do
with JC or GOD. thanks for the history lesson.
"be fruitful and multiply, all except the church leaders, and, oh yeah,
it's a sin, but i'll forgive you."

Actually there are some Protestant Christians who think Catholicism is
not Christian. It's pretty much the " pure religion" claim, which is
bogus and self serving. When I talk to one of these bozos I point out
that the Catholic Church kept their Bible safe for centuries.

Very few atheists are. We're anti- fundamentalists, anti- bigotry
against us, anti- discrimination against us, anti- slander against us,
anti- imposition of religion, anti - idiots who talk in the real world
as though their doctrines applied to everybody, etc.

Unfortunately too many believers see nothing wrong with doing these
themselves.

And interpret the reaction as "anti-Christianity" when it's all about
live and let live.

bogus and self serving.

You're right, there is no such thing as a "pure" religion. All
religions have developed from other ideas. Even Catholicism is a
mish-mesh of ideas that preceeded it. However, it is this type of
in-fighting that will finally destroy Christianity as it exists today.
They are destroying themselves from within and once the dust clears
they will probably end up with a very fundamentalist religion, which is
the last thing the world needs.
Bennie 16 has stated that if the RCC becomes a small organization as a
result of the weeding out of "cafeteria Catholics" (my words) so be it.
So Bennie wants nothing but fundamentalist, by-the-book Catholics in
his Church. Also, among the Protestant denominations, it's the
fundamentalists groups that are growing. The others are actually
getting smaller as members leave for other religions or, simply, no
longer belong to churches. Hence my prediction of the demise of
moderate, mainstream Christianity within the next century if the
moderates don't start speaking up for themselves.

When I talk to one of these bozos I point out that the Catholic Church
kept their Bible safe for centuries.

I'm afraid not. The Catholic Bible is not the same book as the
Protestant Bible; anymore than the To'rah is the same book as the Old
Testament. They share similiarities, but they aren't the same. When the
Protestants reinvented Christianity, they reinvented the Bible as well.
And given that there are, at least, 33 different versions of the
Protestant Bible, one can't even say there is a single Protestant
Bible. If you mean that Catholics kept the Catholic Bible safe for
centuries, that would be true.

BTW I am not Catholic or Christain for that matter, and while I have
some problems with the Catholic faith and other Christian faiths about
certian things, I am not anti-Christian.

There is no such thing as Christian "faiths" there is only one and this
includes Catholicism. I think you mean Christian denominations, there
are many of those. I will forever believe that Catholism is the only
Christian denomination that has any real mystism left in it and that it
is a powerful and beautiful spiritual system; however, the message has
gotten lost in the politics. Spiritual growth/enlightenment and a
boat-load of "thou shalt nots" don't mix.

Josh,
Very insightful post;

You're probably right. The RCC wants to be a leader, not a follower.
And
really, how much value is there in a religion if it changes its
principles
to fit with the prevailing views of the day? I'll concede it can have
some
value, as a social stabilizer, but in terms of real truth and morality?
If
the Church changes its views now, then either

I think it depends on how much a given religion has invested in being
"right".  If said religion doesn't claim to have cornered the market on
truth, but understand that it might have a piece of the truth then
there is room to move and make needed changes to its stance to reflect
the changes in human nature and society. If it is an organization like
the RCC, which has taken on the role of being the the embodiment of
"truth" it can't be wrong. There's too much invested in being "right".
Therefore, there is less wiggle-room and lots of accusations of "being
out of step" and "fossilizing" both of which the Church has been
accused of.

a) it was correct before and now it's just telling people what they
want to
hear, in which case it shouldn't be trusted
b) It was wrong before and shouldn't have been trusted then and
probably
still shouldn't
c) what's G-d wants from us changes over time

I can see this last option being true on a smaller scale, but probably
not
on such a fundamental issue as this. Is this what Catholics think
though? I
think though that even if they did it wouldn't explain their apologies
for
their behavior during various past events, like the Crusades and the
Holocaust, to which we'd have to say a) or b).

I agree.

I wonder what Anne thinks (I guess I could e-mail her). I imagine it's
b),
so I don't know why she'd grant the Church legitimacy at all. The way
she
describes it, it seems like the Church just keeps people down. So why
not
instead affiliate with a group that does the right thing in the first
place
or that corrects itself earlier? And if her views are just a product of
her
conscience, as she says, why should anyone else change? They've got
their
own consciences to please.

I'm wondering the same thing.
As an aside, I can't understand why any woman, given the Church's
inherent misogyne, would want to be a member. I would ask the same of a
gay or lesbian. If the organization outwardly takes a stance that is
demeaning, why would a person subject themselves to it?

I looked at the book last weekend - picked it up and paged through it - and
was slightly revolted...

It's not the subject matter, per say - I've got lots of books fiction and
non- about religion and Christianity - so of which I treasure...

But, I actually had a phyisical reaction - it's just WRONG for Anne Rice to
be writing about Jesus...  Memnoch didn't bother me - but this one -
brrrr....

So, I put it back.   Maybe I'll try to buy it this weekend.

But what you're describing sounds more like a philosophy or a
scientific
theory than a religion.

Josh,
There is a very thin line between religion and philosophy and most
religions are heavy on philosophy. The Act of Transubstantion, for
instance, is as much an act of faith as it is a philosophy. The way a
person sees it just depends on what side of the line they are standing.

If a religion is going to follow society, then why not just follow
society yourself without the go-between?

Many do just that. I think it's called Humanism, but I'm not certain.

I thought the whole point of religion was precisely to provide a truth
that stands above manmade
philosophies, scientific theories, and societal and individual
impulses.

It can't because religion itself is man-made. There isn't single thing
that a religion can prove as absolutely true when it comes to faith
because faith is just that, faith. When something that is held in faith
becomes a provable truth it stops being faith and becomes science and
fact.
As an aside, if you look at the definitions the word "religion" has had
over the centuries, this idea of religion providing "truth" gets very
interesting.  Religion in and of itself isn't supposed to be an end; it
isn't supposed to prove or disprove anything, which is what most people
want it to do. They have forgotten, or have been encouraged to forget,
that religion is supposed to be the servant and not the master of the
human soul and shouldn't provide anything more than a method by which
the a person/soul "re-links" with the divine. Mystics understand this
concept which is precisely why they are called "heretics" by mainstream
practitioners of their particular religion, ha ha.

True, but then, aren't religions generally, or always, said to stem
from
some degree of divine revelation, which is supposed to be reliable?

I believe that divine revelation happens all the time, the problem with
it is that regardless of how pure the revelation is when starts it's
journey it must move into a person's consciousness/ego to be preceived
and this is where things get screwed up. Few people, I think, can
interpreate a divine message without flawing it with their own baggage.
Fewer still understand that if a divine message is received it's
personal and applies only to the person who received it.

So any crack you make in a religion can easily become a crack in the
religion's
very foundation. The RCC's current stubborness might be understandable,
if
it hadn't backtracked so much already.

Absolutely. Literalists have an deep need to prove they are right
because, as you've pointed out above, their religion depends upon it.
These are the people that must make others wrong so they can be right
and protect the "rightness" and "truth" of their faith. It doesn't
enter their mind that no religion has all the truth, just small pieces
of it, and if they do make a change that change is also "true" whether
or not it creates a conflict. To makes this conflict "right" they get
busy trying to resolve the conflict. It's an interesting show to watch
in any religion.
But compare Buddism with Christianity in this regard. Let's say, if it
was proven tomorrow that the Buddha absolutely did not exist it
wouldn't make a bit of difference to the religion because the religion
places more value on experience of the divine that a person has
directly than on "revealed" truth from any book. You will find few, if
any, Literalist Buddhists. Christianity, on the otherhand, places much
more value on the "revealed" word and would collapse if Christ were
proven absolutely to have never have existed.

Well I can't speak for Catholicism but in general I'd say that people
usually overlook negative things if they find enough positives, and
that
people disagree over what's positive and negative in the first place.
Some
disagree based on their consciences, and some based on sweeping
philosophical arguments. I've met plenty of women who do not support
feminism (admittedly a fuzzy term) and homosexuals who don't support
homosexuality or the things associated with it. They've thought long
and
hard on the subjects and could probably argue lots of people into the
ground. Whether they're ultimately right or wrong, these things are not

simple at all.

I think that is very true. Nice insight.

Pentecostals tend to be a lot more conservative and less tolerant than
many others. Catholics tend to join the church at an early age and
those who remain often find their adult views not in agreement with the
Churchs teachings, some leave but some love the Church and stay despite
their qualms about some of its teachings. In denominations where one
joins formally as an adult, thats less likely as it makes little sense
to become a member of a group whose views you dont share. American
Catholics are pretty well known for their disregard of a lot of what
comes out of Rome, so there is a lot more tolerance on the individual
level for things the Church officially condemns.

Thats cool. My experience in GA, AL, SC, TX has shown me that a lot of
Southern Baptists are NOT on the same page as you. A lot of them are
pretty hard on ANY sin.
No biggie IMO. I expect people to frown on behavior they believe to be
wrong. I wasnt judging or insulting anyone, though I can see how it
seems that way.

Again, I will state, that I myself am a sinner, and at the risk of turning
this into a complete theological discussion (which is not my intent).  The
Bible does say that the wages of sin are death.  It does not say that if you
only lied once to your parents, about how your glasses got broken, you'll be
