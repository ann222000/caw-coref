Love in the Time of No Time
By JENNIFER EGAN

The city is full of people we can't reach. We pass them on sidewalks,
sit across from them in the subway and in restaurants; we glimpse
their lighted windows from our own lighted windows late at night.
That's in New York. In most of America, people float alongside one
another on freeways as they drive between the city and the places
where they live. To lock eyes with a stranger is to feel the gulf
between proximity and familiarity and to wish -- at least sometimes,
briefly, most of us -- that we could jump the hedges of our own narrow
lives and find those people again when they drift out of sight.

In a sense, the explosion of online personals speaks to the fervency
of that wish. In the first half of 2003, Americans spent $214.3
million on personals and dating sites -- almost triple what they spent
in all of 2001. Online dating is the most lucrative form of legal paid
online content. According to comScore Networks, which monitors
consumer behavior on the Internet, 40 million Americans visited at
least one online dating site in August -- 27 percent of all Internet
users for that month. The sites they visited range from behemoths like
Yahoo! Personals and Match.com, which boasts 12 million users
worldwide, to smaller niche sites catering to ethnic and religious
groups and to devotees of such things as pets, horoscopes and fitness.
In between are midsize companies like Spring Street Networks, which
pools the personals ads for some 200 publications nationwide,
including Salon.com, the Onion and Boston Magazine, and sites like
Emode and eHarmony, which specialize in personality tests and
algorithms for matching people. A recent entrant, Friendster,
conceived of as a site for dating and meeting new people through
mutual friends, has become a raging fad among the younger set and now
claims more than three million members.

The societal reasons for this fury of activity are so profound that
it's almost surprising that online dating didn't take off sooner:
Americans are marrying later and so are less likely to meet their
spouses in high school or college. They spend much of their lives at
work, but the rise in sexual harassment suits has made workplace
relationships tricky at best. Among a more secular and mobile
population, social institutions like churches and clubs have faded in
importance. That often leaves little more than the ''bar scene'' as a
source of potential mates. (Many single people I spoke to saw this as
their only option, aside from online dating.)

Improved technology -- namely, the proliferation of broadband and the
abrupt ubiquity of digital cameras -- partly explains online dating's
surge in popularity. More critical still is the fact that the first
generation of kids to come of age on the Internet are now young
adults, still mostly single, and for them, using the Web to find what
they need is as natural as using a lung to suck in air. They get jobs
and apartments and plane tickets online -- why not dates?

Still, a fair number of people continue to feel a stigma about dating
online, ranging from the waning belief that it's a dangerous refuge
for the desperate and unsavory to the milder but still unappealing
notion that it's a public bazaar for the sort of people who thrive on
selling themselves. The shopping metaphor is apt; online dating
involves browsing and choosing among a seemingly infinite array of
possible mates. But those who see a transactional approach to coupling
as something new and unseemly would do well to pick up a novel by Jane
Austen, where characters are introduced alongside their incomes. There
is nothing new about the idea of marriage as a business transaction.
Serendipitous love is what's new, love borne of chance, love like what
engulfed my grandparents after my grandfather, then a resident
physician at a Chicago hospital emergency room, happened to remove my
grandmother's appendix. Serendipitous love as a romantic ideal is a
paean to cities and their dislocations, the unlikely collisions that
result from thousands of strangers with discrete histories overlapping
briefly in time and space. And online dating is not the opposite of
this approach to love, but its radical extension; if cities erase
people's histories and cram them together in space, online dating
sites erase both cities and space, gathering people instead under the
virtual rubric of a brand.

The defining fact of online dating is that it begins outside any
context -- historical, temporal, physical. To compensate, dating sites
offer the old-fashioned comfort of facts: income, life goals, tastes
in music, attitudes toward having children -- the sorts of things you
might wonder about a stranger you locked eyes with. To ask whether
this lack of real-world context is ''good'' or ''bad'' is to
oversimplify; online personals are a natural outcropping of our
historical and technological landscape -- one more proof of the fact
that time and space are ceding their primacy as organizers of our
experience. Better questions might be, How do they work and how is the
way they work changing the nature of courtship?

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

Online dating profiles may begin as jokes or time wasters at work or
good deeds on behalf of single, lonely friends whose digital picture
you happen to have in your hard drive. But for the serious online
dater, the personal profile -- the page alloted to each client on
dating Web sites -- quickly assumes a pivotal importance. Whether
visible or hidden (meaning people can see it only if you contact them
first), profiles are as intrinsic to online dating as cards are to
poker. The profile does the legwork of materializing before potential
love interests and braving with a smile their contemplation,
dismissal, exegesis, mockery or the whiplash of being zapped among
friends as an e-mail attachment whose subject heading reads, ''Check
this one out.'' The profile never sleeps. It keeps vigil day and
night, dutifully holding your place in the queue of romantic prospects
drummed up by the thousands of searches all over the world whose
criteria you happen to meet. What this means is that tens of millions
of Americans, a great many of whom have never gone near a
virtual-reality game, find themselves employing ''avatars,'' or
digital embodiments of themselves, to make a first impression in their
absence.

Dating profiles are works in progress, continually edited and tweaked,
fortified with newer, more flattering pictures. If they were physical
documents, they would have the velvety, dogeared texture of beloved
children's books or 19th-century family Bibles. Often they're made
collaboratively, with friends, or at least vetted by someone of the
same sex as their target audience. Many online daters have more than
one profile, sometimes on the same dating site. (Before Spring Street
Networks limited the number of profiles a single person could post,
lone individuals were known to have a few dozen.)

Greg, a 23-year-old secretary and aspiring rock singer who lives in
Brooklyn, has two profiles on Nerve.com. Recently, his profile
answered the question ''Why you should get to know me'' with a short
paragraph ending: ''Because I have condoms in my back pocket but don't
hit on anyone. I'm quiet, complacent, pretty, and utterly
diabolical.'' Greg acknowledged in an e-mail message to me that his
approach was ''pretty risky'': ''The ad will attract fewer women, most
definitely, but the ones who respond will be very likely candidates
for a good date. . . . If I was bored and looking to go on a lot of
dates, I'd have a different picture and a funnier, more verbose ad.''
His earlier profile was indeed more expansive and earnest -- the
headline reads, ''Make sure she gets home safe.'' And as any online
dater will tell you, the picture is the most crucial profile
component. (Among the several cottage industries that have sprung up
around online dating is that of personal profile photography.) ''I'm
no photographer,'' Greg writes (my weeks of conversation with Greg
have occurred entirely by e-mail; we have never spoken or met), ''but
I've spent a lot of time trying to take sexy pictures of myself for
these ads, and the good ones have produced lots of responses.'' Greg
estimates that he has gone out with between 30 and 50 women he met
online since he first posted a profile nearly three years ago. His
second meeting, through amihot.com -- one of several dating sites
where members can rate one another's pictures -- led to a relationship
that lasted a year and a half.

Greg is 6-foot-4 and, judging by his pictures, possessed of a tousled
rock 'n' roller handsomeness. Like a lot of online daters I
corresponded with, he doesn't have Internet access at home; his online
activity occurs almost exclusively at work (he minimizes the screen
when his boss walks by) or at Internet cafes on weekends. ''It is
impossible to draw the line between my online social life and my
real-world social life,'' Greg says. ''Without online personals, there
is no telling where I would be living, who I'd be hanging out with,
what clothes I'd be wearing or how busy my nightlife and sex life
would be (believe me, they are busy).''

Notice that Greg refers to his profile as an ''ad.'' This is common
parlance and helps to explain why a lot of people -- especially those
older and less Web-inclined than Greg -- are squirmy about posting
one. Lorraine, a 39-year-old mortgage officer in Cherry Hill, N.J.,
and the divorced mother of three teenagers, had no photo posted on her
original profile with Match.com, and her descriptions of herself were
vague. A tepid response spurred her on. She uploaded a photo and wrote
a lengthy profile, whose ''about me'' section includes: ''My ideal man
is someone who respects a truly good woman and knows how to make her
feel special, important and loved. . . . A man who would give of
himself before he gives to himself. (Ouch! I bet that hurt).''

Lorraine was honest, she says, in her choice of picture and report of
her physical dimensions, but this isn't always the case; most online
daters have at least one cranky tale of meeting a date who was shorter
or fatter or balder or generally less comely than advertised. Small
lies may even be advisable; by dropping a year or two off her age, a
40-year-old woman will appear in many more men's searches, and the
same is true for a man shorter than 5-foot-11 who inflates his height
even slightly. But for all the fibbing and fudging that go on,
outright lying about who you are is generally regarded as uncool and
self-defeating. Think about it: if all goes well, the person will
ultimately agree to meet you, at which point they'll discover you're
not a race-car driver from Monaco who speaks five languages and owns
an island in the Caribbean. Evan Marc Katz, a screenwriter and veteran
online dater, has started a business called E-Cyrano.com that will
actually write someone's personal profile in his or her own voice
after a lengthy interview. Katz, 31, favors another popular metaphor
for online dating: job hunting. ''It is really a resume,'' he says of
the profile. ''You're taking the available facts, and you're cleaning
them up.''

But for all the metaphorical aptness of shopping and job hunting to
describe online personals generally, they neglect the most basic truth
of the profile itself: regardless of its tone -- hipster irony in
Greg's case, gushy sincerity in Lorraine's -- making and posting a
profile is an act of faith. Like throwing coins into a well, there is
an earnestness about doing it at all. Which is why even people with a
cynical view of personals tend to speak about their own profiles with
disconcerting pride. Yasmeen, a 26-year-old recent law-school
graduate, went on only one date in three years in Columbus, Ohio,
where she says her ethnicity (she is half Indian, half Filipino) made
her ''invisible.'' She posted a profile through Jane Magazine, but
chose not to meet any of her respondents for a year and a half. Still,
she said: ''When I'm lonely, it helps to know there is someone out
there who is looking for me. . . . And while my ad may not be 'the
real me,' at least there is potential for me to be that best version
of myself. Even for just a small part of a day.''

FLIRTING

Here is part of the expansive introductory e-mail message Greg wrote
to Sam, a 23-year-old graphic designer, in response to her profile:

''Subject: Hi.

''It's weird. I'm in the middle of noting to myself how you misused
'perceptively' (shoulda been perceptibly) when I get to a word I've
never seen before: 'ideationally.' Everyone always tells me I
shouldn't be so harsh when grading the grammar, spelling, etc. in
people's ads and responses, but I can't help it. . . . If you like to
go out to dirty rock shows and drink at bars from time to time, or if
you think you'd like to let my roommate cook for you while we all act
like retards, you and I could get along. Please respond.''

Sam did, in an e-mail that began:

''And here I was congratulating myself on my 170 I.Q. Dammit. . . . I
am all about dirty rock shows and bars.'' Referring to Greg's remark
in his profile that he carries condoms in his back pocket, Sam
concluded: ''P.S. You know, you have to use the condoms, or discard
and replace. . . . Just F.Y.I., so you can start hitting on bar skanks
before it's too late.''

There is no shortage of ways to flirt online. The most obvious are
codified right into the dating sites as nonverbal signals people can
click at each other: ''winks,'' ''smiles,'' ''breaking the ice,''
depending on the site. While women are generally more comfortable
approaching men online than in bars, men still tend to make the first
moves, and since women with attractive pictures (Sam is 5-foot-11 with
long blond hair) are usually besieged with responses -- she's had
several hundred since posting her first ad last spring -- it behooves
a man to think hard about his opening salvo. Greg's style has evolved
over time: ''It used to be: 'I like your ad. Check out mine. Hope to
hear from you.' . . . But I've found that long-winded and entertaining
messages get responses more than half the time, while boring,
mass-mailed messages can't beat a 1-to-5 response/message ratio.''

Online daters are constantly innovating ways to shanghai the
technology into flirtatious use: a 34-year-old opera singer and actor
created a new profile of himself, ''Brooklynboy,'' that was entirely a
response to a particular woman's profile, ''Brooklyngirl,'' that had
smitten him. But if flirting in the real world consists of no-strings
banter between two people who feel a mutual attraction, online
flirtation is its inverse -- it happens in the presence of everything
but physical attraction. Two people who have read each other's
profiles may know each other's hobbies, income, turn-ons, religious
affiliations, political views and whether or not they want children,
but they have no idea whether the frisson these avatars of themselves
manage to whip up in the void will translate into life. When
Brooklynboy met Brooklyngirl after a week of strenuous flirtation,
there was so little mutual attraction that they never made it to a
second date. Online flirting happens, then, in the conditional voice,
and there's a general sense that it shouldn't go on for too long.

The exact progression from first contact to in-the-flesh-meeting
varies among daters and age groups. For younger people, who grew up
with instant-messaging programs, e-mail will often lead to an
instant-message exchange (or several), followed by a meeting; those
over 30 tend to prefer the phone. David Ezell, 39, who is gay and runs
a rare-book business online, refuses to exchange more than two or
three e-mail messages before moving to the telephone. ''There's a lot
of men who are on the fence about their sexuality. . . . this is their
sexual outlet: writing personals ads,'' he says. ''They're never going
to meet anybody, and they don't want to. . . .That's the first step in
intimacy, swapping phone numbers.'' Ezell had a serious long-term
relationship with a physician he met online, and when that
relationship failed a year and a half ago, he returned to the
personals.

Making a timely segue from virtual to real-world flirtation is hardest
when two people are talking across a physical distance. Angel, a
42-year-old divorced father who lives in Boston, made contact with
Carmen, a 39-year-old divorced woman who had just moved from Puerto
Rico to Connecticut, on LatinSingles.com, where his profile is posted
in Spanish. Angel was skittish about relationships; after separating
from his wife of 18 years, he spent several months homeless, sleeping
in city shelters and in his car because his job at a printing company
didn't pay enough for him to afford an apartment of his own. He and
Carmen communicated by e-mail and then moved to the phone. ''I did not
go by the looks of her, because she had no photo posted on her
profile,'' Angel said. ''I was basically just going with what the
heart said.'' After a month of e-mail messages and phone calls, they
made a plan for Carmen to drive to Boston so they could meet.

''We met at South Bay shopping center in the parking lot, right in
front of Toys 'R' Us,'' Angel said. When he first saw her, he
recalled, ''I said: 'Wow. Damn, I'm good.' Because she is a very
attractive lady. I was definitely speechless. We were both shy, but
slowly we started to loosen up and get to the same type of
conversation we were having over the phone. We got a bite to eat, and
then we went to get a drink, and she stayed over that night.'' They
slept in separate rooms, and Carmen went back to Connecticut the next
day. She now visits every weekend and plans to move to Boston in
December.

CHEMISTRY

Angel and Carmen had it; Brooklynboy and Brooklyngirl didn't.
''Chemistry'' is a word you hear a lot among online daters: sine qua
non of the enterprise and the object of a fair bit of fetishization.
Here, for example, is an excerpt from a dating log kept by Regan, a
37-year-old technical writer in Atlanta, since she posted an ad a year
and a half ago on Salon.com. ''M: Sang in the car; zero chemistry;
started writing me poems and stories. A: Too young, too tiny, had
roommate problems and bored me. C: Zero chemistry; I was sure he was
gay. K: Great chemistry, but too straight for me. Lives in my
building, of all things. R: Had had a recent bankruptcy and actually
skipped out on his bar tab, appalling me. M.P: Came from California to
meet me. A waste of a few days -- there was zero attraction.''

The early stages of an online acquaintance happen on spec, with the
mutual understanding that chemistry will be required in order for
things to proceed. This puts a fair amount of pressure on that first
meeting -- both parties tend to arrive with chemistry sensors keyed to
a quivering state of alertness. When chemistry is absent, on both
sides or (more painfully) just one, a cut-your-losses mentality
prevails. ''Sorry but it just wasn't there for me'' e-mail messages
are the polite response to a chemically inert date; just as often, the
disappointed party will simply fade away, a conventional rudeness that
is especially jarring to newcomers.

Being on the receiving end of these rejections can be bruising,
because the rejection comes not from a total stranger but from a
person you've e-mailed and talked to and possibly become fond of. In
September, Lorraine, the New Jersey divorcee, had tea on a Sunday
afternoon with an attorney she had spoken with at some length on the
phone. She said that on first seeing him, ''My initial reaction was:
shorter than I like, he's not great looking but he's O.K. looking. I
would have given him a chance and gone out again.'' But the attorney
sent her an e-mail message that began, ''I think you're a wonderful
woman, but. . . .'' A week later, Lorraine was still trying to figure
it out. ''You think, what is wrong with me?'' she said. ''I'm 90
percent sure it's physical, that I'm just not the perfect body. I try.
I wear a small size, but I'm probably not what he's looking for.'' Or
was the problem that, as a way of making conversation, she had
mentioned a conflict she was having with a neighbor -- did the lawyer
think she was grubbing for free legal advice? Or could it have been
her personality? ''On a first date I laugh, I smile, but I don't crack
jokes,'' she reflected. ''So I was thinking, Maybe he wanted someone
who was fun immediately.'' Lorraine's failed marriage began with
love-at-first-sight, so she is wary of instant chemistry. ''A lot of
times that spark is just lust anyway,'' she said. She's looking for
something that will evolve and endure, but fears that in the
chemistry-fixated world of online dating, that sort of bond would
never have time to flourish.

And there are those who say that the culture of online dating is
itself inimical to the chemistry its practitioners crave. Someone
actively dating online may have as many as five or six dates in a week
(''serial dating'' is the term for this), which can make for some
fuzzy-headed folks beholding one another across tables. Just
organizing that much dating activity is a challenge; at one point,
David Ezell had his dates and prospective dates arranged on an Excel
spreadsheet. Leslie Hill, 34, who works in human resources in Silicon
Valley, estimates that she went on 100 online dates before meeting her
second husband on Match.com. She kept track of the multitude in a
dating binder, printing out the profiles of every man who contacted
her and filing them under different headings: ''Under Consideration,''
''Chatting Online,'' ''Chatting and Going to Meet,'' ''Met and Would
Like to See Again'' and, for men she didn't want to see again,
''NMF,'' or ''Not Moving Forward,'' a category borrowed from human
resources. During phone conversations with prospective dates, Hill
would scribble notes about their lives: ''I would write it down: 'has
two sisters and a brother,' 'worked there and there,' and if I went
out, I would go through my binder and refresh myself: 'O.K., this is
Bob. He went to Chico.' I hoped that when I got to meet the person, I
was real and genuine.''

For Greg, who isn't looking for a serious relationship, the chemistry
issue is less acute. In late July, he had a first date with a woman he
met online. ''I just don't spend much time trying to figure out where
the date will go,'' he said that afternoon, when I asked about his
expectations. ''I think she'll be attractive. I think she'll be just a
bit heavier than she looks in her pictures, since she did not list her
weight anywhere. I think we will get along very quickly. It would be
out of line to assume that we're going to have sex, but I think it's a
definite possibility. . . . She's told me that my e-mails make her
laugh, which might be good or bad, as it is difficult for me to be
funny in person before the conversation has gained momentum, and I've
actually had dates comment that I'm much quieter than they expected. .
. . The key is fun. Intense mutual attraction is optional. Playful
lust will do.''

SEX

The next day, Greg sent me this account of his date: ''Well, she was a
little on the heavy side, as I expected, but wearing it well. She was
well dressed and drank quickly at first. I wouldn't say there was an
immediate comfort level; she seemed maybe just a little nervous at
first.'' They hit a couple of bars on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
played pool and ate grilled-cheese sandwiches. The evening ended like
this: ''We took the cab to my place and made out during the entire
ride, except when I needed to direct the driver. My place is a wreck.
My bed is in the living room. It's a good thing that my roommate was
already asleep, because I have absolutely no privacy when he decides
to walk through the apartment. . . .We got naked, I left the light on,
we had some really good sex for around 40 minutes and passed out by
about 1:30.'' He concluded: ''I'd say she'd see me again. It will
probably happen at some point.''

I remarked to Greg that by virtually any standard, it sounded like a
successful date and asked for his evaluation. ''This was a
run-of-the-mill date, or maybe a notch better than that,'' he said.
''I liked her, but not enough to merit fireworks. Given the seemingly
endless selection, I get to be a little less forgiving.''

Until the late 1960's, marriage was the best guarantor of regular sex.
Thereafter, it was being in a steady relationship. But online dating
may be on its way to eliminating that particular incentive for
commitment. Sites like men4men4sex.com and adultfriendfinder.com or
the ''Casual Encounters'' area of Craig's List exist purely to
coordinate sex dates among interested parties with complimentary
tastes, often on very short notice. But even at the more mainstream
sites, one-night stands are commonplace and easy to arrange. L., a
31-year-old information-technology specialist, had several one-night
stands during the three years he lived in New York. (He moved to Paris
last August.) He let me log into one of his accounts and scour the old
e-mail exchanges, a typical one of which (to ''sexyangelina'') reads:
''Let me know if you're interested. . . . I think we could have fun.''
The woman's response: ''Where yah goin'?'' He: ''Moving to Paris.''
She: ''Whoa! Why is that? You're such a cutie! Good luck to you,
though.'' This time, ''sexyangelina'' included a private e-mail
address, so the communication could bypass the dating site. ''It
starts with a few e-mails,'' L. said, ''and goes to I.M. More pictures
are exchanged, then it goes to a phone call, and that's when the deal
is usually closed. Typically, it doesn't take very long if both people
are interested in the same thing. . . . On two occasions the women
have come to my place, had sex with me and we haven't had one
paragraph of conversation.''

The ability to prospect anonymously for lovers who have no overlap
with your actual life is something of a Valhalla for married people
inclined toward extramarital sex, and by all accounts, the dating
sites are teeming with them. Many are disguised as singles, while some
operate quite openly, usually -- though not always -- without a
picture. (Friendster and Spring Street Networks allow ''open
marriage'' and ''discreet,'' respectively, in their choices of
''relationship status.'') B., a 45-year-old woman who says her husband
is unable to perform sexually, has been using the personals for the
past two years to find ''playmates'' to consort with during her
husband's frequent business trips. She likes younger men, 25 to 35,
and usually corresponds with them for about a month before arranging a
30-minute coffee date -- in effect, a chemistry date -- which is the
only time she appears with them in public. ''Men are usually pretty
aggressive about talking about their sexual preferences, and I try to
match that,'' she said. ''After all, I'm not looking for companionship
or romantic love here. I want sex, and I want mutual orgasms, and then
I want to go home alone. . . . If he expresses reluctance about giving
oral sex or being 'scared' of vibrators, then I know he's not for
me.''

If the coffee date goes well, B. arranges a meeting either at a hotel
or at her date's home; she never ''entertains.'' Despite all the
screening, she has had her share of bad experiences, most often in the
form of men expecting to be serviced as if she were a prostitute. But
she has also found ''regulars'' -- others, similarly attached, who are
game for occasional, discreet sex dates.

Greg may not be looking for a serious relationship, but he's not after
no-strings sex, either. An ideal date for Greg is a woman he can see
casually, sleep with for as long as possible and stay friends with
when the sex ends. The lack of context around women he meets online
doesn't trouble him. ''We had enough in common, I guess,'' he said of
the woman he slept with on the first date the previous night. ''I tend
to focus more on the fun at hand -- I'm not preoccupied with matching
up with a person's life goals or hobbies or anything.'' By the end of
that week, he had gone on four dates with women he'd met online (one
indirectly; she was the friend of another online date) and had slept
with three of them -- a busy week, Greg said, though not
extraordinary. He practices safe sex. ''It's more or less understood
with everyone that condoms are mandatory,'' he explained. ''I even
have a brand. There is also a brand I hate. Also, it's extremely rare
for the girl not to have condoms. The one time I forgot mine because
of a last-minute pants change, my date had a whole box in her purse.''

One of Greg's dates that busy week was Sam, the woman whose grammar
he'd corrected in his introductory e-mail message, whom he'd already
been out with several times. Before that date, Greg said, ''she and I
are becoming good buds, so I'm not sure she'll still be wanting to
have sex.'' When I asked him to explain, he elaborated: ''It seems to
be the way things go: sexual desire either disappears or is repressed
(who am I to say which?) if the relationship isn't progressing. The
less frequently you meet, the longer it can last without getting
serious. If you hang out and have sex for a whole weekend, that might
well be the end of it.'' He was wrong about Sam, though. ''Sam and I
had wonderful, slow, deep sex last night,'' he told me the next day.
''I guess we are not in the buddy zone. Yet. I still think it lacks
any romantic interest.''

Around this time, Sam noticed my picture on Greg's Friendster page (I
had joined in hopes of finding interview subjects) and contacted me
independently. Wired New Yorkers under 30 seem to be universally
mesmerized by Friendster, which functions as much as a social
cross-referencing system as a dating site: a way of keeping track of,
and learning more about, people they have already met in real-world
contexts. Sam told me (by e-mail; we've never met or spoken) that she
moved to New York a year ago, having just graduated from college. Last
spring, after breaking up with her boyfriend of three years, she began
posting personals ads online through Time Out New York. As of this
writing, she has met 13 of her respondents and slept with 4, including
Greg. She said of Greg in August: ''He is inarguably interesting. I
can't quite figure him out. Which is one of the perils of online
dating -- no references. I have no one to ask whether Greg is a
man-whore but Greg himself.'' By ''man-whore,'' Sam meant a player, or
a guy who sleeps around and avoids commitment.

Sam's most recent profile is directed toward men and women both and
states that she's interested only in friendship. ''My intention was to
meet girls -- because I know basically no women in New York at all,''
she said. She received only two responses from women, one of whom,
Katherine, she met. ''Katherine proceeded to buy me far more drinks
than was sensible and then insisted that I come and hang out at her
apartment,'' Sam recalled. ''So the one time I went on an Internet
date and was drunkenly taken advantage of, it was by a woman.'' Sam
has no regrets, particularly since she and Katherine have no friends
in common. They haven't seen each other since. ''It is much easier to
sleep with people you meet online,'' Sam said, as opposed to friends
of friends. ''You don't have to think about whether so-and-so will get
mad because you rejected them. Also if it all goes terribly wrong, you
can honestly just disappear.'' For Sam, then, the existence of a
liminal zone outside the boundaries of her real life made sexual
experimentation possible.

Those disillusioned with online dating will tell you that its promise
of a no-muss relationship attracts people with intimacy and commitment
problems. This is probably true. A 50-year-old American magazine
editor who lives in Paris says that he has used online personals over
the past 10 years to orchestrate ''adventures'' -- rendezvous in
foreign locales with women from various European countries. ''There
are periods when a frenzy comes upon you,'' he said. ''You really feel
yourself in the grip of something that's kind of like a 'high.' The
problem comes when you try to make that happen again and the feeling
gets progressively more tepid and less exciting each time around. And
before you know it, you're looking for somebody new.'' This man calls
his present relationship, of one year, ''a record for me.'' Yet he
recently posted profiles on two French dating sites. ''This is kind of
made for people like me, who prefer fantasy to reality,'' he said of
online dating. For this man, though, the promise of a no-strings
attachment has often proved illusory. ''Whatever people say, they tend
to get involved,'' he told me. ''People tend to lose their hearts.''

JEALOUSY

Around the middle of August, a month or so after their first online
contact, Greg invited Sam on a camping trip to the Delaware Water Gap
with his father and some family friends. On returning to New York, Sam
said: ''It's extremely difficult to conceive of someone as a man-whore
when he's roasting marshmallows and passing around rum mixed with
Wal-Mart sour watermelon soda and joking with his dad. . . . As far as
I can tell, he's sweet, thoughtful, attentive, smart, funny and all
that stuff that people say when they're obviously falling for
someone.''

When I suggested to Greg that camping together was a rather couple-y
thing to do, given that he's not interested in a romantic relationship
with Sam, he answered: ''I guess I was knowingly taking the risk of
sending confusing signals with the invitation. After all, though, Sam
continues to give me tons of breathing room and seems to be enjoying
her own.''

But as the week wore on, all that breathing room started getting to
Sam. ''I haven't heard from Greg since Monday'' she said. ''Drama,
drama. It's driving me crazy, actually.''

For a person even vaguely inclined toward jealousy, online dating
serves up a weird mix of provocations, peepholes and blind alleys. The
very fact that a love interest has a profile posted is an invitation
to wonder what else he or she might be up to, and because that profile
is more absence than presence, it becomes a projection screen for
whatever narcissism or paranoia the beholder may be feeling. (I've had
several people tell me that former dates had revised their profiles to
include comments aimed specifically at them.) But for all the
ambiguity of profiles, the technology of dating sites also allows for
some fairly rigorous surveillance; it's hard to deny you've been
checking out profiles and answering mail when your own profile reads
''Active within 24 hours'' or, worse, ''Online!'' Marie, a 43-year-old
divorced apparel designer, recently became involved with an attractive
man her own age. ''We dated several times, and it seemed to be going
well,'' she told me. ''There were definite sparks on both sides. . . .
Then he got busy with work, and he'd e-mail me and say, 'Hang in
there.''' In the midst of waiting, Marie stumbled on a brand-new
profile (along with new pictures) that this same man had just posted
on the site where she'd met him. Peeved, she e-mailed him asking why
he'd had time to create a new profile and spend a good part of the day
online but not time to see her. His reply was vague, and it was the
last she heard from him. A few days later, she did a search for men on
a different dating site and discovered yet another profile of this
same man. In this one, he had written, ''If you're over 40, don't
waste my time or yours.''

''I check Greg's Friendster page compulsively, to tell the truth,''
Sam said. ''It lets me put faces into my vague notion of Greg sleeping
with other people.'' No wonder -- Greg's 93 ''friends'' on the site
include a preponderance of lovely, skimpily dressed women who have
left him testimonials like ''This boy is one of the smartest and
hottest cats out there ;-).'' Before the camping weekend, Sam said
about Greg: ''I feel all the time as though the other shoe is going to
drop -- like he's too good, and if he's actually not a man-whore, then
I really have no idea what he's doing with me. So I'm continually
expecting him to disappear . . . which I suppose all connects back to
online personals, because he really could pretty much totally
disappear.''

REJECTION

Sam isn't paranoid; she's realistic. Relationships begun online have a
tendency to end there too. This generally happens one of two ways: by
e-mail or by no e-mail -- i.e., someone disappears. Regan, the Atlanta
technical writer whose dating log I excerpted above, fell in love last
spring with a man she met online: a journalist living in Atlanta. ''We
e-mailed and talked on the phone for about a year before we met,'' she
told me. ''We set up a meeting two times. He stood me up both times.''
The reason was guilt: he had a live-in girlfriend. In April, Regan
happened to pass this man on the street, and they recognized each
other from the many digital photos they'd exchanged. ''We circled each
other, in slow motion, in disbelief,'' she remembered. ''Everything in
me relaxed, calmed, stilled. . . . It was IT. The thunderbolt. And he
was going through exactly the same thing.'' They began a relationship
that flourished despite the fact that the journalist kept postponing
the promised breakup with his girlfriend. On Regan's birthday, he sent
a gift and a love letter from Europe and left her three messages.
''His heart is completely open, visible at all times, this one,'' she
said.

Then silence. Days and then weeks began to pass. Because there was no
overlap in their work or social or daily lives, Regan had no idea
whether the man was still in Europe or had returned to Atlanta, and
they had no friends in common to ask. ''I feel like I'll never smile
again, let alone laugh,'' she told me. ''Everything weighs eight
million pounds. . . . I guess anyone can do anything to you at any
time.''

The journalist resurfaced several weeks later with an unsatisfying
explanation and hopes of resuming the relationship. Regan agreed to
see him and continues to, but repairing the gouge left by his sudden
absence has been difficult.

People in fledgling relationships begun online can vanish from one
another's lives with the same breathtaking efficiency as a line of
text deleted from a word processing document, leaving no hole, no gap
in one another's daily lives to mark the fact that they were ever
there. For some, an awareness of this exit strategy permeates the
enterprise, allowing them to skimp on the niceties they would more or
less have to extend toward a person they were likely to meet again.
Newcomers to online dating either acclimate themselves to these
occasional early evaporations or abandon the practice altogether.
''I'm totally irritated at how disrespectful it is to just
disappear,'' a 27-year-old TV producer fumed after the man she had
been dating for three weeks failed to call and then stopped answering
her e-mail messages. ''I really don't have the energy or the
self-esteem to continue to meet guys whose backgrounds I don't know.''
She was one of several people who renounced online dating in the
course of my interviewing them for this article, although the paucity
of alternatives soon drove her back and she has since become seriously
involved with a man she met on Friendster.

Because online relationships begin in a state of mutual absence,
''disappearance'' may be the wrong word for a sudden lack of contact
between two people who meet this way; more, these are failures to
reappear from the digital murk that came first. And because the
avatars who reside in that digital realm often hang about long after
their makers have ceased to communicate, it is possible for people to
keep distant, prolonged track of one another. Lynn Ross, a clothing
merchandiser in her 40's, was involved for three months with a married
man who deceived her into believing he was single. The relationship
ended nine months ago, but she still checks his profile, noting
recently that he continues to update it every week. And Marie, the
designer, takes comfort from the fact that a man she loved and was
rejected by is often logged into the dating site where they met.
''Sometimes when I see him online late at night,'' she said, ''I
think: Good. Another night he's home alone.''

Greg didn't disappear. He and Sam continued to see each other, and in
late September, they took a road trip to Ohio to do some renovation
work at the home of Greg's aunt and uncle. ''Greg is, in a word,
amazing,'' Sam told me after they got back. ''I think if I wasn't
being so insanely cautious, I would be head over heels. It's possible
that I am already, but am in denial.''

And Greg: ''The Sam thing is still strangely casual. We still talk
about Nerve and Friendster meetings (only in the most general terms)
as if they are ongoing, though I haven't been browsing the ads much
myself. . . . In my mind, it's becoming a good friendship, and in a
manner that is largely independent of the fact that we sleep
together.''

GETTING SERIOUS

Online dates that lead to love -- and they are legion -- are a little
like Tolstoy's happy families: for all their quirky particularity,
they end up sounding strangely alike. There's Kellie Smith, 33, from
outside Boston, an occupational therapist who whimsically clicked
''Love on AOL'' during her lunch break and found herself on Match.com,
where she dashed off e-mail messages to several men who interested
her. Michael DuGally, 35, a partner in a Massachusetts furniture
manufacturing company, was her first online date; they met for lunch
and never really parted. Last summer, the couple asked Match.com for a
logo banner so they could be photographed with it on their wedding
day.

They aren't the only ones making such requests, according to Trish
McDermott, vice president for romance at Match.com; the company has
forked over baseball caps and matchbooks to give away at weddings,
along with well wishes and toasts to be read aloud. One couple
designed their wedding cake in the shape of a computer, with the top
section decorated to look like the Match.com welcome page. Michael and
Kellie, whom I met for a drink in Manhattan just after their honeymoon
in Greece, call themselves lucky, as if a fluke of chance had brought
them together. There was no intersection at all between their worlds,
yet the connection they feel, they say, is ''spooky.'' Neither wants
children. Both practice Bikram yoga. They don't like making plans, but
are very neat. They love to shop. They even drink the same cocktail:
Grey Goose orange vodka on the rocks, with two wedges of lime.

There are scads of stories like this from every walk of life, so that
even the most jaundiced view of online personals must contend with the
fact that people manage to find one another this way -- again and
again and again. So far in 2003, McDermott says, more than 140,000
Match.com members said they were leaving the site ''because they found
the person they were seeking there.''

As of December, Angel and Carmen, the couple who met on
LatinSingles.com, plan to be living together in Boston. But removing
their profiles from the dating site -- the watermark of commitment in
a relationship begun online -- is something neither wants to do. A
community of sorts has sprung up among the single people posting on
the message boards, Angel says. ''My girlfriend and I, we did create a
lot of friendships on this board. We have created a ganglike type of
thing.'' There are even plans for ''gang'' members, many of whom have
never met, to convene in New York this winter. So rather than remove
their profiles, Angel and Carmen hope to bend the genre and create a
joint profile of some sort -- as Angel puts it, ''something that will
reflect both of us.''

The circularity here is intriguing: an absence of real-world community
fuels a schematic, inorganic online ritual that spawns a network of
online friendships that ultimately pushes back out into the real
world. No context becomes, in effect, a context all its own -- an
avatar, if you will, of the city itself. This is how the Internet was
supposed to work, and it suggests that the deep impulse behind the
success of online dating could reach well beyond dating itself.
Friendster lets people search for one another using book titles, band
names and TV shows, among other things, as keywords, and its
''interested in meeting people for'' category offers not only
''friends'' and ''dating'' but also ''activity partners'' and ''just
here to help.'' Greg used Nerve.com to research nightlife before a
weekend trip to San Francisco; he arrived with two prearranged dates
and a list of 19 bars he was interested in checking out. The chairman
of Spring Street Networks, Rufus Griscom, sees the company as not even
being in the business of online dating so much as ''purchasing access
to like-minded people.'' The long-term vision, here, looks like
something out of a Borges story: a virtual clearinghouse where
potential lovers, friends, business associates, audience members and
devotees of all forms of culture -- invisible to one another in the
shadowy cracks of cities around the world -- are registered, profiled
and findable. An alternate dimension where the randomness and
confusion of urban life are at last sorted out.

Sam and Greg continue to see a lot of each other. They've gone on
another road trip and have been spending most recent weekends
together. Sam told me: ''We've become a lot closer -- which is to be
expected seeing as we've spent so much time in the company only of
each other. . . . Everyone perceives us as a couple, actually. On the
other hand, I don't think anyone would describe us as boyfriend and
girlfriend.'' She enclosed part of an e-mail message Greg had sent her
that day: ''You possess an equanimity that is quickly leading me in
the direction of Sam worship. I always expect you to be supremely
cool, but I temper the expectation by acknowledging the unlikelihood
that anyone is as cool as I've come to believe you are, and then you
come around and meet the expectation anyway.''

For the moment, Greg is sticking to his story. ''Sam and I are
becoming famous friends,'' he said. ''My friends adore her. . . . Her
mood seems unchangeably good.''

Whatever kind of relationship Sam and Greg end up having, it's
unlikely that the online point of origin will ever fall away
completely. ''Online personals come up all the time because everyone
has one,'' Sam said, ''and they generate interesting stories through
responses or new pictures/writings, etc. When I meet anyone, I check
whether they're on Friendster. I discuss other people's profiles, if
it's common knowledge that they have one.''

And of course, Sam and Greg still have their own ads posted, signaling
to others while they sleep.
