Some Shoppers Find Fewer Happy Returns
Databases Limit 'Excessive' Exchanges
By Ariana Eunjung Cha
Washington Post Staff Writer

Darlene Salerno considers herself a loyal customer of the Express
clothing chain, shelling out roughly $2,000 for its trendy outfits
each year for the past decade. On a recent shopping trip, she bought a
tank top, a button-down shirt and some khaki pants, but realized when
she got home that she had similar items in her closet. So a few days
later she took them back to the store. She presented the items, the
receipt and waited for her money.

Instead, the saleswoman handed her a slip of paper that said &quot;RETURN
DECLINED&quot; and told her to call the toll-free number at the bottom for
more information. She phoned and was informed her account showed
&quot;excessive&quot; returns.

As the holiday shopping season gets into full swing, a number of major
retailers -- including KB Toys and Sports Authority, according to
store personnel -- are rolling out electronic systems that weigh the
number of returns and exchanges a person has made, the dollar value of
the items, and the dates of the transactions to decide whether a
consumer should be granted another. The systems are designed to catch
shoplifters and those who &quot;wardrobe,&quot; wearing clothes and then
returning them for a full refund.

But Salerno, 26, a receptionist at a Manhattan financial firm, said
she falls under neither category. She returns things often because she
buys things often. She said she feels she has done nothing wrong --
the clothes were never worn and the tags were still attached -- but
that she was treated like a criminal.

&quot;I'm embarrassed to go into the store,&quot; Salerno said. &quot;I love their
clothes, but I'm afraid to shop there now.&quot;

As more personal information is collected into databases, computers
have been handed increasing power to make decisions about our everyday
lives. The technological systems aim to solve costly and important
business problems, but the proliferation of these &quot;electronic
blacklists&quot; has alarmed consumer and privacy advocacy groups who say
many databases have incomplete, incorrect or misleading information.

&quot;Technology has made it cheap to do all kinds of surveillance and
watch over people and make sure they obey the rules. But when a system
makes a mistake, what can you do?&quot; said Richard Smith, an Internet
security and privacy consultant.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 gives consumers rights
concerning information used to make decisions about credit, insurance,
employment or other services. Other federal laws impose disclosure
requirements on information collected by the medical establishment or
the financial services industry. But increasingly, companies are
creating databases not envisioned by such regulations, and there is
debate about which laws, if any, apply.

Peggy Twohig, assistant director of the Division of Financial
Practices of the Federal Trade Commission, which administers the Fair
Credit Act, said whether a particular information system is covered by
it &quot;depends on the particular facts of each system, and can be a
complex legal question.&quot;

Among the databases being created is one for landlords that purports
to list renters who have been evicted. Others claim to identify
&quot;known&quot; spammers. St. Louis-based Talx Corp., meanwhile, has compiled
more than 100 million employee records that contain names of
companies, dates of employment and job titles. More than 1,000 firms,
including American Airlines, FedEx Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Kmart
Corp., Marriott International Inc., Microsoft Corp. and PepsiCo Inc.,
make use of the service to speed along the screening process for
potential new hires.

But workers worry that some companies, for instance, use the word
&quot;inactive&quot; to refer to people who have left the company for any
reason; other companies use &quot;terminated,&quot; a word that some employees
have argued has negative connotations. Perhaps the most common
complaint is that job titles are incorrect. One woman, Shelli
Isiminger of Dover, Del., said one of her former employers reported
that she was a &quot;supervisor&quot; rather than a &quot;call center manager,&quot; a big
distinction in her industry and one she worries has cost her jobs.

&quot;To have a discrepancy, to make it seem like I inflated my title, is a
kiss of death,&quot; she said.

Mike Smith, vice president for marketing at Talx, said that the
company tries to facilitate communication between employees and
employers but that it considers itself an agent for the employers and
that any changes to records must be made through them.

Another company, DoctorsKnowUs.com, created a database of people who
have filed malpractice claims as a resource for doctors. John S.
Jones, a radiologist from Kaufman, Tex., who spent seven years
compiling the information for the site, said he took it offline after
some patients complained that it was impossible to differentiate
between those with legitimate claims and those with frivolous ones,
and that all could be denied care by those using the list. Since then,
however, Jones has received hundreds of e-mails and phone calls from
doctors who want the site back online, and he said in an interview
that he is considering resurrecting it.

&quot;It was public information. . . . I was simply aggregating it,&quot; he
said. &quot;The site was mischaracterized as a blacklist.&quot;

A spokesman for Limited Brands Inc., which owns the Express stores,
declined to answer questions about its computerized return
authorization system. Mark R. Hilinski, a co-founder of the Return
Exchange Inc., an Irvine, Calif.-based company that provides
technology for the retail chain, said the computer denies returns to 1
to 2 percent of customers at most stores. He said even though the
database is not subject to the requirements of the Fair Credit Act,
his company provides consumers a free copy of their report when they
ask and it gives them an opportunity to correct inaccurate data. He
added that very few have disputed the information.

&quot;The system is often highly reliable. We have a very fair system to
make us aware of any discrepancies they think they found in their
report,&quot; said Hilinski, senior vice president of sales and marketing.

He said the company's privacy policy prevents him from commenting on
individual experiences. The company's criteria for judging returns
varies from retailer to retailer and is not disclosed because it might
inadvertently aid those who want to abuse the system. It's possible,
the company said, that a return rejected one day could come in the
next day and be approved.

Hilinski added that the company is not aggregating return data from
multiple retailers but that there has been interest from clients who
want to share return information with one another.

Return fraud has been a major drain on retailers' coffers. Richard
Hollinger, a professor of criminology at the University of Florida in
Gainesville, said retailers in 2003 lost nearly $30 billion, or 1.7
percent of sales, because of fraud and that about half of that may be
related to bad returns. In recent years, scammers have used the
Internet to launder the money -- people steal merchandise, return it
for credit slips at stores, then turn those credit slips into cash by
selling them at a discount on eBay or other online auction sites.

Retailers like the Limited are fighting back against such high-tech
fraud with high-tech defenses. Sometime in the spring, consumers and
Express workers say, the store began replacing the black placards
denoting its return policy to note that it was using the Return
Exchange service. The new signs advertise the &quot;Express Guarantee&quot; and
say consumers have up to 60 days to return items. However, the
company's return policy also notes that it uses an &quot;industry wide&quot;
system to authorize returns and that &quot;under certain circumstances we
reserve the right to deny returns.&quot;

Some consumer and privacy rights advocates say they sympathize with
retailers' desire to root out fraud but said they are worried that
disclosure about the electronic tracking system has been inadequate.
Jordana Beebe, a spokeswoman for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in
San Diego, said consumers should be told exactly why their return is
denied and warned before they hit that point.

Salerno said the report she got from the Return Exchange showed she
had made six returns from June to August for a total of about $375 but
that in at least four cases the transactions were exchanges and she
actually ended up spending more money on other clothes. She said she
contacted the company by phone and by mail to complain. In one letter,
Salerno wrote that she felt the computerized system impinges on
people's &quot;freedom on how they should or not spend their money.&quot; She
said she has not received a response.

Hollinger, who consults for the Limited, said that cases like
Salerno's represent the &quot;teeny tiny glitches&quot; in the system that he
feels will eventually be worked out. &quot;Over the decades, retailers
realized they were leaving the door wide open for fraud and a number
of the major ones realized that . . . there has to be some
technological solution to this,&quot; Hollinger said.

But for all the money and effort retailers have spent on this
high-tech system, there appears to be a low-tech loophole, Salerno
discovered. After giving up on trying to clear her record with the
company, she enlisted the help of a friend, who was able to return the
unwanted clothes without hassle.

"/> So, she buys so much shit that she doesn't even know what's in her closet.
I get the feeling she simply likes to shop and buys at a whim without
thinking about a purchase. She's the perfect consumer in a consumer driven
society. Except that she wants to return the shit after the &quot;shoppers high&quot;
is gone. That's not good for a consumer driven society, so it only figures
that companies will come up way to limit returned items. Perhaps she might
give a little more consideration to purchases in the future.

I'll second that rant. If I am buying hard goods from a supply house, either
mail order or walk-in, and I return an item for any reason other than it
being defective, I get hit with a 15 per cent restocking fee. I have &lt;no&gt;
problem with that- they have costs, and it gives me incentive to make sure I
am purchasing the correct items in the correct amount. Civilian stores
should maybe adopt the same principle. Unless defective or the wrong size,
in which case you get the correct item in exchange, you pay to return.

I &lt;hate&gt; shopping in stores aimed at impulse shoppers, especially clothing
stores. Takes forever to wade through the dreck to find what I want.
Somewhere out there must be a web vendor that only stocks basic stuff for
curmudgeons like me, at a decent price.

&gt; While generally true, this returns database is hardly a good example.
&gt; If you don't abuse the return privilege (and that's exactly what it
&gt; is, a PRIVILEGE) then you won't be affected by this particular
&gt; database at all.

"/> Returning items in BRAND NEW CONDITION is not a privilege. It is
a store policy, and one which can influence whether people shop
at a given store (for example, I would almost never buy at
Burlington Coat Factory because they do not give cash refunds --
store credit only). If the store is going to decide on a
case-by-case basis whether they will actually honor their posted
policy, then they need to post that information, and people can
make a decision whether to continue shopping there.

In the case of clothes shopping, maybe the person doesn't want
to bother trying on clothes at the store, and wants to take it
home instead. I really see no reason why there should be a
problem with that? In my case, maybe I see something a week or
two later than I like better, or that's cheaper.

Bottom line is the store has to follow their posted return
policy and can't start saying &quot;except for you&quot; when you try to
utilize it, even if it's for the tenth time that month.

"/> ideally, yes, but too many packages are &quot;welded&quot; shut, and the outer box includes only sham info. the store could arrange with
vendor or mrf rep to laminate to the display a copy of the instructoins, but i can't recall ever seeing that.

then when you open the box, you discover a couple of disclaimers, limitations in the literature. and/or you discover the actual

"/> I spend *a lot of time* researching as well as I can, in order to avoid buying the wrong item, because too many stores make you
go through an hour of rigmarole to return things. essentially these stores get a good percentage of free $10 or 15 sales, when
customers make the best guess as to suitability, and buy things that aren't worth the time to return.

those 'dollar stores' are a good example of stores that probably make most of their *profit* off of &quot;risky&quot; noname crap
merchandise. the quality items are infrequent among the store's stock, because they function as loss leaders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I almost never return things to the store. If I buy something, it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;because I *know* it's something I want. I don't buy things on impulse,
&gt;&gt;&gt;get buyer's remorse, and then try to return it.

&gt;&gt;Yeah, but there are plenty of situations in which it's not possible to
&gt;&gt;evaluate an item until you get it home.

&gt; It's fine if you return things once in a while; the retailers aren't
&gt; objecting to that. As long as you don't do it so often as to be
&gt; abusive, you'll be fine even with the new database.
&gt; Have you ever made a mail-order purchase? Even if the vendor allows
&gt; returns, you're often on the hook for return shipping charges - so
&gt; you're probably a lot more careful about making sure that you REALLY
&gt; want the item. Just use the same care when purchasing in a local
&gt; store. Easy!

"/> Not that easy. I normally do purchase stuff that there is
any doubt about how suitable it is from a store that has
a no questions asked free return system, just because
its hard to be sure that it is completely suitable without
actually getting it home and trying it etc. There's always
some possibility of a design problem that isnt obvious
until you try it for what you want to use it for.

Just another viable way of doing business.

Sure, some arseholes will certainly abuse it to get one
use out of something for free if thats all they need it for etc.

kids? If you did, you'd know that returning clothes is a fairly
commonplace thing. This is just a stupid policy on their part.
The story even says that the majority of the times that she
bought stuff, she ended up buying more stuff than she returned.
By all means, if you have someone who routinely returns over 90%
of what they buy, and there is evidence that it's worn, stop
letting them return it. But that does not seem to be the case
here.

Also, if you pay cash, and refuse to give them proof of who you
are when returning stuff, can they refuse to take the return?
Otherwise, they'd have no way of knowing who you are.

&gt; of profit the store has made on the customer, the losses they take on
&gt; the returned items, etc. For example, if a customer buys $100 worth of
&gt; merchandise, returns half of it, and then buys $75 worth of new stuff,
&gt; then that's a net win for the store - IFF that $50 worth of returned
&gt; merchandise can be resold for $50. If instead the returned merchandise
&gt; must be placed on the markdown table, and ultimately sold at a loss,
&gt; then thats a different story.

electronics (which appears to be what you are equating

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No, the only people who are going to be upset by this new return
&gt; policy are the people who abuse the system.

"/> Your definition of abuse is simply people who operate
differently than you think they should based on your narrow
minded view. You know what? For me, returning clothes is no big
deal either. I buy a shirt and pants every now and then and
rarely return stuff. But that's certainly not the case with my
wife and daughter. They buy stuff, they see it cheaper or else
see something they like better at another store, and return the
first one. And many other people do that as well. And if there
are stores that start considering what they do to be abuse, then
I can assure you they'll just stop shopping at those stores.
Maybe this woman was shopping on her lunch hour and had no time
to try on a bunch of stuff. So she bought more than she needed
and tried it on over the weekend and then returned what she
didn't want. What is so wrong with that? The article said
they're trying to stop people who wear something and then return
it. Great, do that. But they're going beyond that with this
policy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of course, I'm willing to bet that the majority of &quot;abusive&quot; shoppers
&gt; can't afford to pay cash for the things they buy - they charge all
&gt; those impulse purchases on their credit cards, and carry an
&gt; ever-growing balance from month to month. Or they stole the items in
&gt; the first place. ;)

"/> Again, more narrow-minded opinionated garbage. Who cares how
they are paying for it anyway, so long as they don't default on
the credit card? If anything, the company should be thrilled to
have this person paying the minimum payment. And remember that
since the interest is based on average daily balance, they'll be
paying for the time they had the clothes prior to returning it.
So it actually makes more money for the store.

The bottom line here is that just because you cannot imagine a
situation where what this woman was doing would make sense to
you, does not give you the right to accuse her (or anyone else
who does the same thing) of doing anything other than taking
advantage of a posted store policy.

BTW, do you want to hear &quot;abuse&quot;? A friend of mine used to buy
extra stuff for her kids every year, and at the end of the
season she'd return the things they did not wear. And if you
want to accuse me of &quot;abuse&quot;, last year, at a discount clothing
store I picked up a couple of suits for my son because I wasn't
sure which size he would need for his bar mitzvah and they were
having their semi-annual sale. I held onto both for a couple of
months and when we determined what size he actually needed, I
returned the other size. The store got use of my money for those
two months, and I was able to ensure that I got the suit at
their sale price. The store had no problem with my doing this
and I certainly had no saw nothing wrong with it.

They seem to think they are listed as spammers when their provider is

support the criminals oand orhte abusers in attacking the rest of the
internet. Some block lists (blacklists, if you like) list only the
spammers. SPEWS lists the providers. Those who choose to use SPEWS
are in effectboycotting those rogue providers, and block all traffic
from those providers' IP ranges, even emails from nonspamming
customers of the spam friendly ISP. Of course, some of those
nonspamming customers don't wantto shell out an extra dollar for
legitimate hosting, and get upset over the SPEWS listing, but all
SPEWS does is publish a list of IPs owned by ISPs who are harboring
spammers.

He had signs everywhere, AND on the receipt clearly stating &quot;NO

defective items, but there were constantly people breaking things and
trying to return them. I was there frequently to see it when I filled
in for him on occasions. On idiot attempted to return a lawn mower
after hitting something and breaking the crankshaft. Even though there
was grass caked on it and the blade was bent with a big chunk broken
out of it, he claimed it just stopped running right after he started
it. And he got seriously ticked off when refused a refund. A could
of other morons purchased a set of impact sockets and broght it back
after tearing one up, claiming it was defective. I noted the fact
they it was stripped in the inside because it was only barely on
whatever they were trying to turn on it, and they wanted to argue,
they even brought in the bolt. It was SAE and they purchased a metric
set. They thought it was all tyhe same sizes, just different lables.
They also thought impact sockets were harder metal than standard
sockets, which is opposite reality. But they claimed to have been
mechanics for over 20 years and challanged my credentials to dispute
them. So I mentioned my degrees and started explaining the difference
between the alloys and the tempering, etc. They wanted to fight, as
expected, but they didn't want a gun fight. Ah well... :)

"/> I'm 52, have bought a vast amount of stuff, in California (and Oregon,
Virginia, Texas, Florida, etc.) and I have NEVER been required to show
ID. Except in a very small number of situations, mainly involving
purchasing guns (and not always then). In the 1970s and early 80s, ammo
purchases required ID (though the minwage clerks barely glanced at ID).

In no other cases, buying a _lot_ of stuff, have I been ordered (!!)
to identify myself. I expect I would have told them to fuck off had
they &quot;demanded&quot; such proof.

I was ordered to prepare to report for jury duty a couple of years ago.
My plan was to arrive as myself, without any &quot;ID.&quot; (After all, neither
the U.S. nor my state of California has any &quot;official&quot; ID. Yes, they
have a Driver's License, but this is only required WHEN DRIVING. A
lawyer friend of mine, who has encountered such cases, says that the
Confused Deputies (TM) will &quot;order&quot; that one return home and retrieve
some Official ID, but since there is NO DEFINITION of &quot;OFFICIAL ID,&quot;
nothing can be done about a person who answers a court order and
appears without the official ID for which no definition exists. (Ask
yourself if those arrested are let go because they cannot produce ID.)

My personal belief is that if a court orders me to appear, I will make
reasonabe efforts to appear. But inasmuch as I refuse to carry the Mark
of the Beast, an ID number, this is the extent to which I will comply.
If a court officer or cop infringes on my freedom under the
Constitution as a result of not showing the Mark, then at least FOUR
(4) of his family members, possibly including himself, must be
liquidated as vengeance.

&gt;&gt; going to stop asking asinine questions and give me my refund, or do I
&gt;&gt; need to speak with your supervisor?&quot;

&gt;&quot;I'm the supervisor. As you can see, our posted store policy requires
&gt; ID to process a refund in order to provide an audit trail for our
&gt; accounting department. Have a nice day.&quot;
