I'm really sorry to bother you lot, and I may seem rather...simple in
asking this but...

Do you all use google to access afp, or is it just me?

You must excuse me. remember, I'm a member of a generation who's
entire computing ourse at school consisted of the evils of the
Software Development Cycle, and so had all love of the word &quot;digital&quot;
slowly drained from me.

I personally access afp from my ISP's local Usenet server.

&gt; Thunderbird?

A Mail and News reading program which runs on your own PC without using
the browser, which is how you used Google Groups. In my opinion,
specialized News Reading programs are better the Google Groups, and
Thunderbird is a pretty good one, and free. But in order to use them,
you need someone to supply a new feed. No need to know the details about
how this works, but you need a computer which will allow Thunderbird to
download news from it (the process is totally automatic). Some ISPs
offer a news feed to their customers as part of the basic internet
provision, in which case it is free. On the other hand, quite a lot of
people use  the paid for, but inexpensive, news service offered by
http://news.individual.net at EUR10 per annum.

You can download Thunderburd from
http://en.www.mozilla.com/en/thunderbird/ . Personally, I use
Thunderbird Portable from http://portableapps.com . This runs off a
memory stick, which I can plug into any Windows machine and keep my
entire Usenet experience the same as if I were at home. So when
traveling, I can plug it in my laptop and continue as usual. I don't
expect anybody noticed when I went to South Korea for five days about
two months ago, because I carried on reading and posting as normal.

It's not just you, but it's by no means all of us, either.  Not me, firs
a start.

A very unscientific scan[1]  of the headers of a page-worth of messages
entries indicates Google is a minority, but present.

My ISP provides a decent[2] Usenet feed which can be accessed by OE,
Thunderbird or any number of other Usenet or hybrid Usenet/eMail
clients.  Others without this privilege make use of such as
news.individual.net[3] or use the L-Space news-feed[4] with similar
applications or do as you have and go the Google route.

BTW, you see the subject up there, I've put a &quot;Googleproofed&quot; tag[5]
indicating that this is within the realms of [I]rrelevence (not directly
Pratchett-related, as [R]elevent posts are, but perfectly acceptable
found these 'ere parts as long as people want to talk about it).  I
considered labelling it [M]eta, but that would apply to only this
paragraph alone.  Somewhere (check lspace.org, or anywhere else you can
think of, for the appropriate newsgroup FAQs that include the &quot;Tagging&quot;
one) there is a complete explanation of this whole thing. ;)

&lt;hippyesque&gt;I feel your pain, man....&lt;/hippyesque&gt;

Anyway, a lot of words from me, welcome.  There is a mystic significance
in this group regarding the giving of gifts[6] and/or associated

parentages and the like.  I expect someone will be along to present
their own more 'tidy' representation of this ritual in a moment, upon

[2] No complaints from me, anyway, and I know there's definitely worse
out there...  Demon isn't the ISP it used to be, by all accounts, but
I've largely managed to avoid most of the associated issues.

[3] Other 3rd-party servers exist, but this seems to be a favourite,
more complete details of which I am sure are available from someone who
uses it

[4] Limited to a small number of groups, generally pratchetty in nature.
Again, someone else would have the full details available...

[5] Generally [X], for various values of 'X', but Google tends to forget
such tags without being adjoined to other non-whitespace characters, and
I like the -[X]- form.

[6] Or cold hard cash of arbitrarily related value on request? ;)

Since you use Google Groups, select &quot;More Options&quot; at the top right of a
post, then &quot;Show original&quot;.  If the post was made from Google Groups, quite
a few of the headers will allude to this (including a Message-ID that ends

Most of us use specialist Usenet software. It's the Unix mindset - one
protocol, one program, aka &quot;Do one thing and do it well.&quot;  An email
program for email, a web browser for the web, a newsreader for Usenet.

Yes, it's technically possible to do everything from almost any program
(with web browsers being the most likely to adopt the kitchen sink
approach). However, pre-Google Groups posters to Usenet tend to use one of
these:

First off I'm surprised that nobody has offered the usual:

So welcome to AFP, pull up a chair, have some chocolate, call the cat a
bar steward and don't stand on the alligator. [1]

Is the welcome email working?

I too am on Thunderbird onna news server.  I managed for quite  some
time with Outlook express, but will say that OE-quotefix helps a lot.
http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/oe-quotefix/

IF you don't know if your Internet Service Provider supports newsgroups,
if you let us know what your ISP is then I'm sure that someone on AFP
can help.

[1] My first one! I hope I got it right

I use both Thunderbird and Google Groups for complex and obscure
reasons.  If you set up the signatures right, it will give you one
apparent identity which ever route you post from.

Apart from the standard chocolate crocodile welcome, it is a good idea
to browse http://www.lspace.org/fandom/afp/ and http://www.lspace.org/fandom/abp-index.html
(accessed from http://www.lspace.org/fandom/index.html ) to see what
the etiquette of the groups are.

This may avoid the cardinal sin of you writing some thing like &quot;I
noticed in a book a reference to the Deamon Barber of Gleam Street -
TP* should write a book about printing set in that part of the City.&quot;
This would be SPECULATION and would get me well and truly SHOUTED
AT!!! except the book is published and so it becomes a case of
'Invisible writing at the time of the first book'.

(*short hand for Terry Pratchett himself, who has been known to
frequent these very newsgroups and has views on this issue, which I
understand and personally I am willingly forgo the thrill of 'S' for
this to continue.)

I forgot to say, the big plus in using a news reader, or similar such as
Thunderbird which can tackle your e-mail and much else, is that can
'thread' discussions. (I have not seen how to in Google so please tell
me if it can).

Threading discussions means that when several people are contributing
and replying to different people you can see the pattern more easily.
For instance if A starts a conversation and B and C get into a banter
whilst others contribute Google will give you the left column and
Newsreaders (set to show threads) the right.

It's the traditional welcome we give to new people. It mostly derives
from a line in Wyrd Sisters. The crocodile, (though we usually refer to
it as an alligator) just crept in one time - and stayed around

PMS is, IMHO, the only good reason for chocolate.

Other than that, it's greasy, sweet, gives people pimples, bulging fat
bodies and bad teeth, and in my opinion can't compete with, say, a juicy
leg of lamb as far as taste goes.  I'll never understand why people feel
so strongly about chocolate; sure it can taste good, but I just don't
get the worship.  It's not like people black out and need a cigarette
after eating one, but by the way they talk, you'd think so.

It's a rip-off IMO. Diabetics *can* eat ordinary chocolate (the higher
the %age the better, though). So-called 'diabetic' chocolate merely
replaces some of the sugar with artificial sweeteners which give you the
sh!ts. I found this out the hard way (1).

As a diabetic I can have chocolate (and eat it). What I can't have is the
brown sugary fatty milk that is misnamed chocolate here in the UK. Small
amounts of over 85% cocoa solids should be no problem.

To be fair, Thornton's diabetic chocolates are the nicest tasting
laxative I've ever consumed, as well as being very effective. Though I
would have preferred to find that out whilst constipated.

I have recently found a number of bars of 100% cocoa mass. Yes, _one
hundred_ percent. Not the 99% of Lindt. Oddly enough, they're not nearly
as dry as Lindt 99%, either. I find that I can't eat one or two
(flimsily thin) squares of Lindt without having to drink a mug of tea
with it. With the 100% ones I also have to take a drink, but the amount
of chocolate I can eat with that is much larger.
They're called Domori Cru 100%, and they come in a number of varieties,
each from a single origin. Most are Trinitario, one is a Nacional (which
I'd never heard of). It's amazing how much they differ in taste. One is
so tart that I don't actually like it; some are dark and earthy; some
smooth. Well worth trying a couple if you can find them.
