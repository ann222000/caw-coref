Thanks Steve for your reply.

Here's some pointers on the Ninth house that I have picked up so far
from the study of my chart. Saturn here also delays or gives you a hard
time if you were to try to pursue any education. Everything I know is
through my own efforts and not through an education system. If I had
money to spare, I would have gone through to get a PhD! All the things
I know I picked it up myself, and I have no difficulty if I had to pick
up a new skill on the spot. I have been thrown into the deep end of the
pool so many times and I came out of it well....provided the
opportunity was not in the country of my birth.

I was given the opportunity to manage a racing team in 2003 racing
Porsches. And like everything else that comes my way, I had never done
it before. We won the championship by just TWO points, at the end of
the racing season in Macau!

And when the events was held in Malaysia, I had so many problems! My
driver had to retire from one of the races as someone bumped him off
but once the events were overseas, we started winning four races in a
row! The Championship itself was held within Asia (note Uranus in third
house influence which rules short journeys and all things unusual).
There are other instances which this influence has kicked in but I
won't list them here.

Mars is in 4th, I think it's time zone you've keyed in. (use e7:00 ).
Below is the data used in Astrodienst.  Mars in 4th house also squares
my Sun, and to that, I have had problems with my father most of my
life. Mars Sq Sun also gives me a competitive spirit. This is also
something I realise too late in my life. Mars/Libra here denotes that I
do not like conflict. In fact, I stay away from conflict much of my
life as I refuse to deal with explosive situations at work or with
people most of my life until quite recently. I have no problems
deciding what I want when it comes to my career, and like I said, the
opportunities are just not there.

The astrological loop is what bothers me. I cannot succeed in life if I
do not have a partner to rely on or if I do not go overseas. And I
don't have the cash to do either!

Have I missed out on some other aspects which will be of help?  How big
a role does Chiron and Lillith plays in the chart? I've already done
the Vertex, Pallas, etc asteroid thingy and they don't really offer
much in terms of my career.

The timezone/birthtime issue really needs to be sorted out.

Assuming -7:30 is correct I'm seeing a person who needs to feel they
are
serving others and doing something really meaningful as opposed to just
making a dollar. With Mars in four ruling ten and Chiron in nine I'm
thinking perhaps something to do with healing (body, mind or spirit) is
where you might be happy.

Jupiter is in trine with the MC.  That would suggest that you may do
well
in areas related to spirituality, publishing, travel, law or education.

Saturn in nine would also support ministry or law.  It's also
interesting
that the ministry would be reinforcing the notion of healing.

Your Mars in Libra makes me think that perhaps you have had problems
making a decision on what to do and sticking with it or fully
committing
to a path.  Pluto opposed Saturn would indicate that you are going to
have to deal with that before rewards will come.  And don't take out
your frustrations out on your family - they can help you.

I think you are going to have to decide what you want to do and spend
(you
don't want to hear this) about 10-15 years in education, training and
apprenticeship to achieve your dreams.  It will be hard work and you'll
be
a late bloomer but I think with discipline and a postive attitude you
can
do it.

By the way, I use Meridian houses so others using the more common
systems might vary a bit on planet in house placements from mine.

Benard, Interesting and thanks for the feedback.  It helps to hone my
interpretation skills.

I should have associated the Aries MC with sport but although many
dream of it few are fortunate enough to even have had the experience
you did and many die hard fans would envy you for it.  Surgeons often
share a strong Aries influence which is what my mind was stuck on.  Of
course, the military would have been logical as well.

I understand Saturn in nine regarding restrictions in education as I
share the same placement, experience and feelings you do.  I was
fortunate enough to find an occupation where experience was accepted as a
substitute for education and have managed to do very well.  In hindsight
though, the limitations were not external but internal.  I did not have
the patience and discipline to pursue a degree.  It was easy to blame
lack of money (also true for me), time, etc but many poverty stricken
people have found the means to attend classes and over years acquire the
credential. It's all about how badly you want something.  Saturn in nine
is also found in the ministry and legal professions so somehow they manage
to get through school.  In today's world it is unfortunately the price of
admission into many occupation.  In the U.S. it is used mostly as a
culling factor for non-technical jobs. It's used more as a measure of a
person's ability to conform, play the game, etc. There are still
occupations where one can excel without a degree such as the sporting
world, military, trades, astrology and even Information Technology where
acquiring the right certifications means more than degrees.  If you
already know the technology you just take a test to prove it and voila - a
certification. Perhaps there are some connections you made in the motor
racing world that could be leveraged to continue to build on that.

Saturn is currently transiting the lower half of your chart.  Others have
written about the transit of Saturn and my experience tends to support the
conventional wisdom that it is difficult to make much headway in career
matters until it rises and crosses the natal horizon in the seventh house.
During the time it is in the lower half is when one should be preparing
for that eventual rise by mastering whatever trade or occupation they
are in. You'll get back what you put in and Pluto opposed Saturn will
ensure it.

Pluto aspects indicate an area where transformation is required.  Chiron
indicates where healing is required.  I submit the issues symbolized
by Saturn and Mars are key in your case. I would suggest doing some more
thinking, developing some strategies and plans and put your fears and
limiting beliefs aside and dedicate every fiber of your being into
achieving whatever it is that excites you.

Even though it may not be easy and may take a while, I know you can do it
and you know it too so attack, go to war, get it done!

Dear Steve,
Thank you so much for responding. Your feedback will be put to good use
as everything I find out here is used to verify things I have dug up so
far.

I've also noticed the Saturn transit aspect in the Astrodienst reports,
which kicked in the last quater of 2005 and opportunities have all but
dried up. This is something I agree with you but for me, I'm always
thinking of proving the stars wrong. I want to have the power to change
my own destiny. But time and again, the stars have won.

The waiting game is something I have been accustomed to but after ten
years of this erratic cycle, I can't help but feel that time is running
out.

Here's another observation I have noticed. There are certain things in
the chart which basically spells more opportunity, but the location has
got a lot to do with it. I have a friend who has a jupiter in the
second house but because he relocated to a city which was not good for
him, it takes away the opportunities.

I'm one of those who picked up Astrology to "beat" the system. I try to
probe and discover which area I have not considered going into and
maybe give that a shot. That is why I looked into so many charts of
successful people in the world, and find that they have at least one
planet in either the 2,6, 10 house. The 8th and 7th house can also be
fortunate planet placements provided they are in good aspects to
planets found in the 2, 6, 10 th houses. That is the reason I decided
to seek help from others in regard to this. I do not have such a
placement so success will probably be severly limited.

Having Jupiter in my first house makes me think big. I want to achieve
something big in life and the very thought that I can't do that on my
own can get pretty depressing.

Everything boils down to opportunity. If you are born a great general
and there are no wars to fight, then you can't be a great general can
you? Both Rommel and Patton sealed their reputation on the battle
field. Without wars, they would be nothing more than just sports
athletes or deskbound generals with plenty of extra pounds on the
belly.

I realise that the natal chart is actually the script of your entire
life. I've always argued that there is no such thing as freewill, it is
a myth. The moment you decide to do something, the destiny that lies
ahead is already decided for you. You can't achieve something that is
not already in your natal chart. Bummer.... isn't it?

Benard
