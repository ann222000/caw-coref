Car Buyers Flee SUVs, Prius Sales Triple
May 4, 2005

U.S. consumer interest in SUVs dropped sharply in April as people
turned to more fuel-efficient vehicles. Truck-based SUVs have become a
traditional profit center for U.S. automakers while fuel savers have
long been a strength of Japanese automakers, such as Toyota Motor
Corp. and Nissan Motor Co.

Large gains at Toyota, Nissan North America and American Honda fueled
an increase in April sales, while General Motors and Ford Motor Co.
posted declines.

Toyota, Nissan and Honda said sales in April were their best ever for
the month and in Toyota's case, the best month ever in its history in
the United States.

Sales of Toyota's Prius, the most popular gas-electric hybrid car on
the market, nearly tripled compared with April of last year, to
11,345.

General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. sales were down slightly,
while DaimlerChrysler AG showed a nearly 9-percent gain. Leading
Japanese and Korean automakers, however, posted big double-digit
increases.

Industrywide, passenger car sales were up 11 percent in April, while
light truck sales rose only 1.3 percent. SUVs, particularly large ones
like the Ford Expedition and GMC Yukon, seemed to be hardest hit. With
a 28-gallon tank, it can cost $60 or more to fill up an Expedition.

Toyota and Nissan also won customers by offering significantly larger
discounts last month. Rebates, low-interest loans and other come-ons
rose by 76 percent at Nissan to $1,800 and by 107 percent at Toyota to
$1,100.

Both continue to trail the traditional Detroit brands, which average
$3,400 in incentives.

towoards its workers and its consumers, and yet profitable, so much so
that Renault even bought Nissan, a Japanese carmerker, and sent one of
their guys to sort out that company and return it to profit, which he
did successfully, and very responsibly too.

The US is ill with an extremely overpaid executive culture that entails
little more than the managerial algebra of culling workers, increasing
their working hours, slashing their benefits, and campaigning against
corporate tax and overtime pay. Those incompetent nincompoops are
ripping off a nation, and rippring it apart, and are rewarded with
handsome compensations for their failure and venality.

WALL STREET JOURNAL / May 5, 2005
S&amp;P Cuts GM, Ford Debt to 'Junk'
Expected Move Still Stuns Market; GM, Ford Shares and Bonds Slump

Standard &amp; Poor's cut General Motors Corp.'s debt ratings to &quot;junk&quot;
status Thursday, a move that will reduce the auto maker's avenues for
raising funds as it struggles with global competition and rising
health-care costs.

The ratings agency said GM's management strategies may be ineffective
in addressing the company's competitive disadvantages, but that the
company should have no trouble meeting its cash requirements in the
near term. S&amp;P also lowered Ford Motor Co.'s ratings to junk status.

The ratings cuts, which includes General Motors Acceptance Corp., GM's
finance arm, could cause the companies' borrowing costs to rise.

&quot;We are disappointed with S&amp;P's decision to lower the credit rating of
both GM and GMAC,&quot; said Jerry Dubrowski, a GM spokesman. &quot;Clearly GM
has many challenges in North America but the company is moving
aggressively to address these challenges.&quot;...

Of particular concern, S&amp;P said, is the recent slide in sales of sport
utility vehicles -- an arena where GM and Ford have traditionally
dominated. S&amp;P used identical language in its statements accompanying
both companies' downgrades, noting that both Ford and GM have &quot;suffered
from the aging of SUV product line.&quot; Earlier this week, GM reported a
14% drop in sales of light trucks, which include SUVs. Ford's light
truck sales slid 2.4%. GM's overall sales fell 3.9%, while Ford's slid
1.5%.

Investors have dreaded a GM cut to junk, fearing it may cause turmoil
in both the high-grade and junk markets. Investment funds ineligible to
hold junk bonds could be forced to sell billions of dollars of GM debt.
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, two other major ratings
agencies, maintain barely investment-grade ratings on Ford and GM.

GM has about $300 billion of outstanding long-term debt, including
secured notes. S&amp;P cut GM's long-term credit ratings to double-B, the
second-highest junk rating. The outlook on the new rating is negative.

At the end of the first quarter, GM had $19.8 billion in cash, while
total debt outstanding at stood at $291.8 billion, S&amp;P said. Ford has
$161.3 billion in debt outstanding as of the end of March. A Ford
spokesman couldn't immediately be reached.

Recent earnings from both auto makers jarred markets and heightened the
specter of possible cuts to junk ratings. GM reported a $1.1 billion
first-quarter loss, which S&amp;P called &quot;alarming.&quot; Ford's net declined
38% in the first quarter to $1.21 billion from $1.95 billion a year
earlier.

GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner has come under growing pressure, and
the company suspended its earnings forecast for this year as it
struggles to reverse slumping sales and market share in North America,
GM's biggest market. GM, the biggest issuer of corporate bonds in the
U.S. behind Ford and General Electric Co. has taken steps ranging from
shuffling the top brass at its North American operations to pleading
with union officials about health-care costs.

Union contracts, though, make wholesale job cuts costly and trims to
health-care benefits difficult. Killing weak U.S. vehicle brands could
cost billions of dollars in payouts to dealers and cause GM to lose
more market share. Decoupling the auto business from the finance
business could cripple both. Nonetheless, Mr. Kerkorian's move appeared
to open up a door, making the once-implausible notion that a hostile
raider could force GM to overhaul or break itself up seem suddenly
plausible....

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR GM

For the near term, at least, the answer to appears to be: not much.
Traders said the downgrades themselves weren't surprising given the
well publicized financial woes at the auto maker.

A junk rating could make it more expensive for GM to borrow the
billions of dollars it needs to fund development of new cars. But it
wouldn't push the company into a sudden cash crisis. S&amp;P noted it
doesn't expect GM's borrowing costs to rise because of the downgrades.

Lower debt ratings means GM will have to pay higher interest rates on
the bonds it sells. Last year, GM and GMAC spent a total of $11.9
billion on interest payments, up 26% from the year before. GM already
is slashing costs where it can by closing a handful of plants and
pushing early retirement packages. The company also is aiming to reduce
its health-care costs.

The GM downgrade could cause disruptions in the market for junk bonds,
partially because many funds that are limited to investment-grade
assets will be forced to sell GM's bonds. To some extent, that risk
already has been worked into the price of junk bonds since GM lowered
earnings forecast in mid-March.

"/> 20 years ago, I had a small Renault sold by AMC, and it's still the
quietest and most comfortable small car I've ever driven. This car was
known for having cooling problems (15+ hose clamps), but it never
leaked or overheated on me, and I did a lot of driving between Phoenix
and Yuma in the summer.

On the other hand, the transmission failed at just 50,000 miles, and

AAMCO
8825 N. Black Canyon Highway
Phoenix, AZ 85021
(602) 997-6289)

could never get it to last more than 200 miles between subsequent
failures. I don't understand why they couldn't fix it because they
were experienced with this model transmission, and I know they didn't
lie to me about this. They also ruined the engine by forgetting to put
coolant in the radiator, but I'm sure that wasn't their fault either.
The AMC dealer finally fixed everything (transmission ruined, silicone
sealer found inside) and told me that some people from AAMCO had
visited them several weeks ago for photocopies of the transmission
manual.

not the average hybrid, which saves only 10% in fuel.

"/> A Prius is closer to a Corolla. Both cars have almost the same
dimensions, passenger room and comfort so your comparison should be
between the Corolla and the Prius.

Base price for a 2005 Corolla is $13,680. Base price for a 2005 Prius
is $20,875. That's a difference of $7195 BEFORE the dealer gouges you.
Buyers are paying anywhere from $4000 to $5000 over sticker for the
Prius. Annual fuel cost for a 2005 Corolla is $859, annual fuel cost
for a 2005 Prius is $562. So you'll pay between $7195 and $12,195 MORE
for a Prius and save a whopping $297 a year in fuel costs. No way a
Prius will pay for itself in 4 or 5 years. You'll have to drive a Prius
24 to 41 years before you'll save any money in fuel costs over the
Corolla.

As if that wasn't enough, some used Priuses are selling for more than
the list price for a new one.

You will pay more at the pump, that is until gas prices exceed the
current 3.10 per gallon cost of biodiesel. Out here on the west coast,
that could well be this summer.

On doing some research, I've also found that some of the newer
volkswagon diesels get really good milage.

There's a lot of info online about it and community groups are beginning
to sprout up in the usual places. Those who oppose it claim that the
resources we would need to exploit in order to grow that much grain
makes it as potentially ecologically damaging as petrol products. I
personally don't buy that argument, and as someone who doesn't eat grain
I think it's better used as fuel - and feeding livestock. Here are
some links to get you started:

http://proliberty.com/observer/20040212.htm
According to the best estimates of a number of respected international
geologists, including the French Petroleum Institute, Colorado School
of Mines, Uppsala University and Petroconsultants in Geneva, the world
will likely feel the impact of the peaking of most of the present
large oil fields and the dramatic fall in supply by 2010, or possibly
even several years sooner. At that point, the world economy will face
shocks which will make the oil price rises of the 1970s pale by
contrast.

In other words, we face a major global energy shortage for the prime
fuel of our entire economy within about seven years.

&gt; Car Buyers Flee SUVs, Prius Sales Triple
&gt; May 4, 2005

&gt; U.S. consumer interest in SUVs dropped sharply in April as people
&gt; turned to more fuel-efficient vehicles. Truck-based SUVs have become a
&gt; traditional profit center for U.S. automakers while fuel savers have
&gt; long been a strength of Japanese automakers, such as Toyota Motor
&gt; Corp. and Nissan Motor Co.

&gt; Large gains at Toyota, Nissan North America and American Honda fueled
&gt; an increase in April sales, while General Motors and Ford Motor Co.
&gt; posted declines.

&gt; Toyota, Nissan and Honda said sales in April were their best ever for
&gt; the month and in Toyota's case, the best month ever in its history in
&gt; the United States.

&gt; Sales of Toyota's Prius, the most popular gas-electric hybrid car on
&gt; the market, nearly tripled compared with April of last year, to
&gt; 11,345.

&gt; General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. sales were down slightly,
&gt; while DaimlerChrysler AG showed a nearly 9-percent gain. Leading
&gt; Japanese and Korean automakers, however, posted big double-digit
&gt; increases.

&gt; Industrywide, passenger car sales were up 11 percent in April, while
&gt; light truck sales rose only 1.3 percent. SUVs, particularly large ones
&gt; like the Ford Expedition and GMC Yukon, seemed to be hardest hit. With
&gt; a 28-gallon tank, it can cost $60 or more to fill up an Expedition.

&gt; Toyota and Nissan also won customers by offering significantly larger
&gt; discounts last month. Rebates, low-interest loans and other come-ons
&gt; rose by 76 percent at Nissan to $1,800 and by 107 percent at Toyota to
&gt; $1,100.

&gt; Both continue to trail the traditional Detroit brands, which average
&gt; $3,400 in incentives.

"/> So what's *new*?

After the price of oil comes down a bit, then those who can't wait to buy
these monsters will be lining up again at the dealers. This is 100%
predictable, and happens like clockwork.

&gt; A Prius is closer to a Corolla. Both cars have almost the same

&gt; Base price for a 2005 Corolla is $13,680. Base price for a 2005 Prius
&gt; is $20,875. That's a difference of $7195 BEFORE the dealer gouges you.
&gt; Buyers are paying anywhere from $4000 to $5000 over sticker for the
&gt; Prius. Annual fuel cost for a 2005 Corolla is $859, annual fuel cost
&gt; for a 2005 Prius is $562. So you'll pay between $7195 and $12,195 MORE
&gt; for a Prius and save a whopping $297 a year in fuel costs. No way a
&gt; Prius will pay for itself in 4 or 5 years. You'll have to drive a Prius
&gt; 24 to 41 years before you'll save any money in fuel costs over the
&gt; Corolla.

&gt; As if that wasn't enough, some used Priuses are selling for more than
&gt; the list price for a new one.

&gt;&lt;http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/11/Autos/used_prius/&gt;

"/> Interior volume Camry 101.8 cubic ft, Prius 96.2, Corolla 90.3. The
original Prius was smaller, the newer model is closer to a Camry.

Camry's mileage: 33/24
Prius Mileage: 51/59
MSRP Camry(Base model): $18045
MSRP Prius: $20875
Difference: $2,830

If we say 20,000 miles a year (city for comparison sake), that would be
338 Gallons for the Prius, 833 for the Camry. At $2 a gallon that works
out to $776 for the Prius, $1,666 for the Camry, for a difference of
$890 a year, leading to a payback of roughly 3.18 years.

Of course there are lots of assumptions, but its all there from
information from  www.automotive.com .

Now, if I was in that situation Id probably rather buy a second car,
something small, that I can drive in town, and keep the SUV for longer
trips.

I do have a truck, that sees maybe 3000-4000 miles a year, mostly when I
pull a trailer, expect bad weather (snow, ice), have to haul something or
want to go off-road. The mileage in these situations is not my primary
concern, arriving where I am going is. In town I avoid driving it unless I
have to haul something that doesn't fit into my sportscar.

&gt;&gt; A Prius is closer to a Corolla. Both cars have almost the same

&gt;&gt; Base price for a 2005 Corolla is $13,680. Base price for a 2005
Prius
&gt;&gt; is $20,875. That's a difference of $7195 BEFORE the dealer gouges
you.
&gt;&gt; Buyers are paying anywhere from $4000 to $5000 over sticker for the
&gt;&gt; Prius. Annual fuel cost for a 2005 Corolla is $859, annual fuel
cost
&gt;&gt; for a 2005 Prius is $562. So you'll pay between $7195 and $12,195
MORE
&gt;&gt; for a Prius and save a whopping $297 a year in fuel costs. No way a
&gt;&gt; Prius will pay for itself in 4 or 5 years. You'll have to drive a
Prius
&gt;&gt; 24 to 41 years before you'll save any money in fuel costs over the
&gt;&gt; Corolla.

&gt;&gt; As if that wasn't enough, some used Priuses are selling for more
than
&gt;&gt; the list price for a new one.

&gt;&gt;&lt;http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/11/Autos/used_prius/&gt;

&gt; Interior volume Camry 101.8 cubic ft, Prius 96.2, Corolla 90.3. The
&gt; original Prius was smaller, the newer model is closer to a Camry.

"/> Closer to the Camry where? That interior volume doesn't mean squat if
it's not used where it counts.

Prius front head room 39.1 &quot;. Corolla front head room 31.9&quot;. Camry
front head room 39.2.

Prius front hip room 51.0&quot;. Corolla front hip room 51.9&quot;. Camry front
hip room 54.4&quot;.

Prius front leg room 41.9&quot;. Corolla front leg room 41.3&quot;. Camry front
leg room 41.6&quot;.

The whole problem here is you're talking about a Prius providing you a
payback and trying to make it look like you'll get one sooner by buying
one instead of a Camry. If you were concerned with a payback and
saving money, the Camry wouldn't even be on your list. Buy a Corolla
and your payback starts from day one.

You'll also have just as much room in the Corolla's drivers seat as you
will the Prius.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Camry's mileage: 33/24
&gt; Prius Mileage: 51/59
&gt; MSRP Camry(Base model): $18045
&gt; MSRP Prius: $20875

"/> Who are you trying to kid? You won't find a Prius for MSRP. They are
$4,000 to $5000 over sticker, so right off the bat the difference is

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;At $2 a gallon that works
&gt; out to $776 for the Prius, $1,666 for the Camry, for a difference of
&gt; $890 a year, leading to a payback of roughly 3.18 years.

"/> You need to re-do your math now to account for what a Prius is really
going to cost, between $842-$972 per year AND add in the initial added
cost of $6,830-$7830 that the Prius has over the Camry.

No matter how you add it up, the Prius will not save you money. This
has been reported over and over in the national media. You need to face
this fact. Your so-called payback doesn't exist. The payback comes from
buying a Corolla to start with.

&quot;The Prius is rated 60/51 mpg City/Highway by the federal government's
Environmental Protection Agency, with a Combined rating of 55 mpg.
You're more likely to see 41 to 48 mpg, however, which may reduce your
annual gas purchases by a couple hundred bucks. That realization has
angered buyers who thought they'd save more money on fuel.&quot;

"/> Corn has a terrible rate of conversion to alcohol, it take almost as
much energy to produce as you get out of it as fuel. Soybeans are much
better, but as has been pointed out there is simply not enough total
land mass to replace even a small percentage of our current consumption.

For example, for just my own personal driving @ 20 gallons a week I
would need 20 gallons x 52 weeks = 1040 gallons a year. This means at a
oil production rate of 55 gallons per acre it would take 18.9 acres
to produce enough fuel for just one car. But this simple math doesn't
take into account the cost of production of this amount of oil, such as
labor, seeds, cultivation equipment, and fuel for the tractor etc..
So in reality more than 18.9 acres would be needed to fuel each car
after paying costs of production

Currently there are 83 people per sq. mile in the USA, and there is
640 acres in a sq. mile, which means roughly 8 people per sq. acre.
If you looked 8 people being two families of four you can see there is
no way any bio fuel is going to replace oil when you need at least 18.9
acres to fuel one car.

&quot;The biggest single cause of the companies' financial problems, S&amp;P

GM make much of their profits on SUVs and relied on the nation's
appetite for them to hold off overseas competition during the 1990s.
But high gasoline prices and consumer whims are turning the market
against large SUVs, and GM and Ford have been caught flat-footed, with
&quot;severe ramifications,&quot; S&amp;P said in its report.&quot;

&quot;March 27,1999: Renault and Nissan announce their strategic Alliance.
Renault takes a 36.8% stake in Nissan (consisting of shares and
securities with voting rights) for a total of JPY 643 billion (EUR 5
billion/USD 5.4 billion). The Alliance is intended to create a balanced
partnership which will boost performance.
June 1999: Structures are created to develop and set up common projects
promoting the profitable growth of both Alliance partners. The
structures cover all the activities of the two companies.
October 30, 2001: Renault and Nissan announce their decision to further
strengthen the Alliance, in accordance with the terms of the original
agreement, so that the two partners can implement common projects more
quickly. Renault-Nissan B.V. is founded on March 28, 2002.
March 1st, 2002: Renault increases its stake in Nissan from 36.8% to
44.4% (shares and securities with voting rights), representing an
investment of JPY 215.9 billion/EUR 1.35 billion.
March 28, 2002: Nissan acquires a 13.5% stake in Renault, for EUR 50.39
per share, through a reserved capital increase.
May 28, 2002: Nissan acquires a further 1.5% stake for EUR 52.91 per
share, raising its stake to 15% as previously agreed.
May 29, 2002: The Alliance Board meets for the first time.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Isn't 40 bushels better than 0 bushels? Since we the taxpayers are

&gt; Corn and soybeans can't be grown on land that gets only about 10&quot; rainfall

"/> It would be a lot more costly than gasoline, since the inefficiencies of
growing the crops for the vegetable oil are high. As long as it remains a

cents per gallon to refine used vegetable oil into bio-diesel, but th oil is
free (oil from a Japanese-owned, Japanese restaurant is the best, according
to him, because they use high quality oil, and change their oil very
frequently). Oil from restaurants where they use the same oil for a long
time, isn't as good.

Prius can stall at high speed: U.S. report

NEW YORK (Kyodo) The U.S. National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration has received 13 complaints about Toyota's Prius hybrid
cars shutting down at high speed, the Wall Street Journal reported
Sunday.
One complaint involved a Prius shutting down at 96 kph. Another owner
complained that his daughter's &quot;life was in danger&quot; when the Prius she
was driving shut down in fast traffic and police had to divert other
cars around the stalled vehicle.

No injuries or fatalities have been linked to the problem, and the
NHTSA has not launched a formal investigation, the paper said in its
online edition.

According to the paper, the problems being reported are related to
Prius cars from the 2004 model year and some early 2005 models.

Toyota Motor Corp. spokesman Sam Butto attributed the trouble,
according to the report, to a &quot;programming error&quot; in the car's computer
system.

The error was confirmed in 23,900 Prius cars last year.

The spokesman said Toyota sent warning letters to owners of the cars to
get the software upgraded at their dealerships.

The hybrid car combines a gas engine with an electric motor to increase
fuel efficiency while reducing emissions

&gt; I wonder how the hackers do it? I know the Prius has a Bluetooth
&gt; hands-free link for the driver's cell phone - I wonder if it can also
&gt; be used to wirelessly upload malicious firmware, or cause the car's
&gt; computer (and possibly the car itself) to crash?!!!!?!?!?!?!?! Maybe
&gt; there's a &quot;Bluetooth Packet o' Death&quot; similar to the malformed PING
&gt; packet that WinNuke used to use that will cause the Prius to
&gt; blue-screen?
