A pattern in rural school shootings: Girls-as-Targets

Monday's deadly shooting in Nickel Mines, Pa., was the fourth
such incident in five weeks.

By Gail Russell Chaddock and Mark Clayton

Staff writers of The Christian Science Monitor

NICKEL MINES, PA., AND BOSTON – The scene Monday at the buff-colored,
one-room schoolhouse in the gentle heart of Amish country was
wrenching, but also distressingly familiar.

One of four fatal school shootings to beset rural America in just over
a month, the rampage that killed five young girls raises anew a host
of old concerns - about campus security in countryside settings,
access to guns by unstable individuals, and "copycat" violence
advanced by media attention.

They are startling incidents against the backdrop of declining numbers
of school fatalities. But this premeditated attack, like another one
five days earlier in which a drifter corraled teenage girls, killing
one, at the high school in Bailey, Colo., have an unusual and
disturbing feature: girls as targets.

"The predominant pattern in school shootings of the past three decades
is that girls are the victims," says Katherine Newman, a Princeton
University sociologist whose recent book examines the roots of
"rampage" shootings in rural schools.

Dr. Newman has researched 21 school shootings since the 1970s. Though
it's impossible to know whether girls were randomly victimized in
those cases, she says, "in every case in the US since the early 1970s
we do note this pattern" of girls being the majority of victims.

The two cases are reminiscent of a 1989 shooting in Canada, when a
jobless hospital worker killed 14 female engineering students at the
University of Montreal, accusing them of stealing jobs from men, says
Martin Schwartz, an Ohio University sociologist and an expert on
violence against women. He sees such incidents as related to a culture
of violence against women, "a mutation - something beyond."

In Bailey, an armed drifter walked into Platte Canyon High School last
Wednesday, ordering men out and sexually assaulting some of the six
girls he held hostage, shooting one before killing himself. In this
week's tragedy in Pennsylvania's bucolic Lancaster County, the gunman
ordered boys and adults to leave, bound the 10 girls, and shot them,
then himself.

Small towns are no safeguard

Another similarity between the Pennsylvania and Colorado cases - as
well as two other recent school shootings in Vermont and Wisconsin -
is their rural settings. It is rare for mass school shootings to occur
in cities, Newman says. Despite their safe image, rural communities
can be an especially fertile breeding ground for revenge, she and
others agree.

"People think small towns are safer, but in a small community
grievances can fester," says Cheryl Meyer, a professor of psychology
at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, who has researched
similarities of school shootings in rural and small towns. "It's so
often about revenge. Even if something happened 20 years ago, it
doesn't mean it is gone. People talk about it and everybody remembers.
It just trails after you."

Such a motive may have factored into Monday's shootings in the tiny
hamlet of Nickel Mines, Pa., police say.

Flanked by corn fields and a few white oaks, the Amish schoolhouse
could have been lifted out of the 19th century. With no guards,
chain-link fence, or "drug-free zone" signs - or even a telephone - it
seemed a world apart.

The gunman, Charles Carl Roberts, lived just down the road with his
family in a double-wide trailer. He hauled milk from Amish farms at
night, usually before the next day's milking began about 4 a.m. A
co-worker says he might never have met the farmers he serviced. Then,
he would take his children to school.

On Monday, however, he left suicide notes for his family, then drove
his pickup truck to a school he no doubt passed many times on
late-night milk routes. He brought to the school a semi-automatic
pistol, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a
rifle - along with restraints, lumber to block the doors, and a change
of clothing.

In a scene that seemed to echo the Bailey shooting, the gunman ordered
boys and school aides out, then bound 10 girls ages 6 to 13. He called
his wife on his cellphone.

Police arrived after a teacher ran for help to a nearby farm. They
called him on his cellphone, but no answer. Then the gunman opened
fire, and police stormed the barricaded building, breaking through
windows.

Five of the girls died at the scene or at hospitals. At press time,
officials said five remained in critical condition.

Law-enforcement officials, working to unearth Roberts's motive, said
Tuesday that sexual assault seemed the most likely one. In a suicide
note, they said, Roberts recalled an incident 20 years ago when he, a
pre-teen at the time, molested younger children. The note indicated he
had been haunted by dreams about molesting young girls, police said.

"I don't think it was an attack on the Amish community, but a target
of opportunity," Col. Jeffrey Miller, commissioner of the Pennsylvania
State Police, said Monday. "It was almost impenetrable," he said of
the barricaded school. "His goal was to be in there for an extended
period of time. He was hunkering down for a hostage-related siege."

'Copycat' concerns

The apparent similarities between the Bailey and Nickel Mines
shootings - and their close proximity in time - raise experts'
concerns about "copycat" attacks.

News media bear some responsibility for this phenomenon, says James
Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. This is
especially the case when attackers' personalities and grudges are
exposed to high-profile public analysis - as when two teenage
attackers in the Columbine attack were featured on the cover of a news
magazine, he says.

"We've seen with school shootings and postal shootings that the
shooters can become role models for others," Dr. Fox says. "While most
sympathize with the victims, others empathize with the shooters. It's
the publicity they get that turns the shooter into a celebrity that
spawns more of them."

Some see in the latest school shootings echoes of the 1980s, when
there was a spate of carefully planned attacks on students by adults
from outside the schools.

Between 1988 to 1989, there were nine premeditated attacks by adults
targeting schoolchildren, says Fox. In those cases, however, there was
no pattern of girls being targets - a new wrinkle. To him, that year
stands out for its "contagion of adults who got even with society by
killing its most beloved members - schoolchildren."

While national crime statistics show a steady drop in the murder rate,
including violent school fatalities, there seems to be fewer incidents
but "more spectacular stuff going on," Dr. Schwartz says. "Splashy
violence is what's going up, even though crime as a whole going down.
The only thing not going down is fear engendered by these types of
high-profile events."

For grieving Amish families, driving past the crime scene late into
the night or talking quietly in small groups nearby, the fierce media
glare came as a shock to a community that resolutely avoids the
spotlight.

"I was irate when I first heard about the school, then the hurt
started," says an Amish fireman, who helped maintain a security
perimeter around the school late Monday night. He says local firemen
and policemen had expected a crush of news media, because of the
intense public interest in school shootings. But, he adds, "we never
expected to have to deal with it here."

"It's unbelievable. We never expected that anything like this would
happen," says Ruth, a Mennonite neighbor who wanted to give only her
first name.

"I don't understand it, but it's not from God," says Fannie Beiler,
another Mennonite. "He wants us to love one another."

There are scores of such schools in the quiet farming communities
around Lancaster County, a center for the Old Order Amish in the
United States. An estimated 28,000 Amish live in the area - of about
200,000 nationwide.

Amish families live simply - no cars, electricity, cellphones, or
iPods - and grieve quietly. A keystone of their faith is pacifism.
When a young Amish boy in the next town of Bart was killed on his way
to help a neighbor with the milking by a hit-and-run driver two weeks
ago, there was no talk of lawsuits. Nor did Amish families join their
"English" neighbors in calling for a new sign cautioning drivers to
slow down.

In Bart, Paula Flinn set up a hand-painted sign on her front lawn for
their Amish neighbors, who drove past the house in closed, black
buggies at a rate of 50 an hour, some late into the night, after the
shooting. Her sign reads: "Our prayers and thoughts are with you."

I see something even worse. When I mention at school
that we need to be more aware of "possibilities" .. to
soften my comments here ... the ladies treat my comments
as a joke. When I say something like don't leave a female
alone in this place late at night, the FEMALES act offended,
and treat my comments as if I were just not worthy of
saying them. Here's the gospel truth ... as a male in a
classroom, if someone came in with a gun and threatened
me and the students, about 10 seconds later either he
or I would be dead. If I were in a room with only male
students, we would jump that clown and kill him on the
spot. If it was a room of only female students, they would
not defend themselves at all. Regardless, I'll take the
insults, and if one of these creeps darkens my door, he
is going to wish he had not. I'm keeping watch.

&gt; &gt; The only thing not going down is fear engendered by these types of
&gt; &gt; high-profile events.&quot;

&gt; &gt; For grieving Amish families, driving past the crime scene late into
&gt; &gt; the night or talking quietly in small groups nearby, the fierce media
&gt; &gt; glare came as a shock to a community that resolutely avoids the
&gt; &gt; spotlight.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I was irate when I first heard about the school, then the hurt
&gt; &gt; started,&quot; says an Amish fireman, who helped maintain a security
&gt; &gt; perimeter around the school late Monday night. He says local firemen
&gt; &gt; and policemen had expected a crush of news media, because of the
&gt; &gt; intense public interest in school shootings. But, he adds, &quot;we never
&gt; &gt; expected to have to deal with it here.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &quot;It's unbelievable. We never expected that anything like this would
&gt; &gt; happen,&quot; says Ruth, a Mennonite neighbor who wanted to give only her
&gt; &gt; first name.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I don't understand it, but it's not from God,&quot; says Fannie Beiler,
&gt; &gt; another Mennonite. &quot;He wants us to love one another.&quot;

&gt; &gt; There are scores of such schools in the quiet farming communities
&gt; &gt; around Lancaster County, a center for the Old Order Amish in the
&gt; &gt; United States. An estimated 28,000 Amish live in the area - of about
&gt; &gt; 200,000 nationwide.

&gt; &gt; Amish families live simply - no cars, electricity, cellphones, or
&gt; &gt; iPods - and grieve quietly. A keystone of their faith is pacifism.
&gt; &gt; When a young Amish boy in the next town of Bart was killed on his way
&gt; &gt; to help a neighbor with the milking by a hit-and-run driver two weeks
&gt; &gt; ago, there was no talk of lawsuits. Nor did Amish families join their
&gt; &gt; &quot;English&quot; neighbors in calling for a new sign cautioning drivers to
&gt; &gt; slow down.

&gt; &gt; In Bart, Paula Flinn set up a hand-painted sign on her front lawn for
&gt; &gt; their Amish neighbors, who drove past the house in closed, black
&gt; &gt; buggies at a rate of 50 an hour, some late into the night, after the
&gt; &gt; shooting. Her sign reads: &quot;Our prayers and thoughts are with you.&quot;

If girls are being targeted, why don't the writers of this story make

everyone. This would

&gt; 'Copycat' concerns

&gt; The apparent similarities between the Bailey and Nickel Mines
&gt; shootings - and their close proximity in time - raise experts'
&gt; concerns about &quot;copycat&quot; attacks.

&gt; News media bear some responsibility for this phenomenon, says James
&gt; Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. This is
&gt; especially the case when attackers' personalities and grudges are
&gt; exposed to high-profile public analysis - as when two teenage
&gt; attackers in the Columbine attack were featured on the cover of a news
&gt; magazine, he says.

&gt; &quot;We've seen with school shootings and postal shootings that the
&gt; shooters can become role models for others,&quot; Dr. Fox says. &quot;While most
&gt; sympathize with the victims, others empathize with the shooters. It's
&gt; the publicity they get that turns the shooter into a celebrity that
&gt; spawns more of them.&quot;

&gt; Some see in the latest school shootings echoes of the 1980s, when
&gt; there was a spate of carefully planned attacks on students by adults
&gt; from outside the schools.

&gt; Between 1988 to 1989, there were nine premeditated attacks by adults
&gt; targeting schoolchildren, says Fox. In those cases, however, there was
&gt; no pattern of girls being targets - a new wrinkle. To him, that year
&gt; stands out for its &quot;contagion of adults who got even with society by
&gt; killing its most beloved members - schoolchildren.&quot;

&gt; While national crime statistics show a steady drop in the murder rate,
&gt; including violent school fatalities, there seems to be fewer incidents
&gt; but &quot;more spectacular stuff going on,&quot; Dr. Schwartz says. &quot;Splashy
&gt; violence is what's going up, even though crime as a whole going down.
&gt; The only thing not going down is fear engendered by these types of

These are truly horrible crimes -- so terrible that words can't really
describe it.  However, the Nickel Mines murders may not have been copycat,
at least not copycat of Bailey.  The Nickel Mines killer left a checklist,
and he purchased the items on that list *before* the Bailey killings.

Can you explain why the human female orgasm has evolved to be
pleasurable?

&gt; &gt; &gt; A pattern in rural school shootings: Girls-as-Targets

&gt; &gt; &gt; Monday's deadly shooting in Nickel Mines, Pa., was the fourth
&gt; &gt; &gt; such incident in five weeks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; By Gail Russell Chaddock and Mark Clayton

&gt; &gt; &gt; Staff writers of The Christian Science Monitor

&gt; &gt; &gt; NICKEL MINES, PA., AND BOSTON - The scene Monday at the buff-colored,
&gt; &gt; &gt; one-room schoolhouse in the gentle heart of Amish country was
&gt; &gt; &gt; wrenching, but also distressingly familiar.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One of four fatal school shootings to beset rural America in just over
&gt; &gt; &gt; a month, the rampage that killed five young girls raises anew a host
&gt; &gt; &gt; of old concerns - about campus security in countryside settings,
&gt; &gt; &gt; access to guns by unstable individuals, and &quot;copycat&quot; violence
&gt; &gt; &gt; advanced by media attention.

&gt; &gt; &gt; They are startling incidents against the backdrop of declining numbers
&gt; &gt; &gt; of school fatalities. But this premeditated attack, like another one
&gt; &gt; &gt; five days earlier in which a drifter corraled teenage girls, killing
&gt; &gt; &gt; one, at the high school in Bailey, Colo., have an unusual and
&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing feature: girls as targets.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The predominant pattern in school shootings of the past three decades
&gt; &gt; &gt; is that girls are the victims,&quot; says Katherine Newman, a Princeton
&gt; &gt; &gt; University sociologist whose recent book examines the roots of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;rampage&quot; shootings in rural schools.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dr. Newman has researched 21 school shootings since the 1970s. Though
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's impossible to know whether girls were randomly victimized in
&gt; &gt; &gt; those cases, she says, &quot;in every case in the US since the early 1970s
&gt; &gt; &gt; we do note this pattern&quot; of girls being the majority of victims.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The two cases are reminiscent of a 1989 shooting in Canada, when a
&gt; &gt; &gt; jobless hospital worker killed 14 female engineering students at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; University of Montreal, accusing them of stealing jobs from men, says
&gt; &gt; &gt; Martin Schwartz, an Ohio University sociologist and an expert on
&gt; &gt; &gt; violence against women. He sees such incidents as related to a culture
&gt; &gt; &gt; of violence against women, &quot;a mutation - something beyond.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; In Bailey, an armed drifter walked into Platte Canyon High School last
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wednesday, ordering men out and sexually assaulting some of the six
&gt; &gt; &gt; girls he held hostage, shooting one before killing himself. In this
&gt; &gt; &gt; week's tragedy in Pennsylvania's bucolic Lancaster County, the gunman
&gt; &gt; &gt; ordered boys and adults to leave, bound the 10 girls, and shot them,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then himself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Small towns are no safeguard

&gt; &gt; &gt; Another similarity between the Pennsylvania and Colorado cases - as
&gt; &gt; &gt; well as two other recent school shootings in Vermont and Wisconsin -
&gt; &gt; &gt; is their rural settings. It is rare for mass school shootings to occur
&gt; &gt; &gt; in cities, Newman says. Despite their safe image, rural communities
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be an especially fertile breeding ground for revenge, she and
&gt; &gt; &gt; others agree.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;People think small towns are safer, but in a small community
&gt; &gt; &gt; grievances can fester,&quot; says Cheryl Meyer, a professor of psychology
&gt; &gt; &gt; at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, who has researched
&gt; &gt; &gt; similarities of school shootings in rural and small towns. &quot;It's so
&gt; &gt; &gt; often about revenge. Even if something happened 20 years ago, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't mean it is gone. People talk about it and everybody remembers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It just trails after you.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Such a motive may have factored into Monday's shootings in the tiny
&gt; &gt; &gt; hamlet of Nickel Mines, Pa., police say.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Flanked by corn fields and a few white oaks, the Amish schoolhouse
&gt; &gt; &gt; could have been lifted out of the 19th century. With no guards,
&gt; &gt; &gt; chain-link fence, or &quot;drug-free zone&quot; signs - or even a telephone - it
&gt; &gt; &gt; seemed a world apart.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The gunman, Charles Carl Roberts, lived just down the road with his
&gt; &gt; &gt; family in a double-wide trailer. He hauled milk from Amish farms at
&gt; &gt; &gt; night, usually before the next day's milking began about 4 a.m. A
&gt; &gt; &gt; co-worker says he might never have met the farmers he serviced. Then,
&gt; &gt; &gt; he would take his children to school.

&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday, however, he left suicide notes for his family, then drove
&gt; &gt; &gt; his pickup truck to a school he no doubt passed many times on
&gt; &gt; &gt; late-night milk routes. He brought to the school a semi-automatic
&gt; &gt; &gt; pistol, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a
&gt; &gt; &gt; rifle - along with restraints, lumber to block the doors, and a change
&gt; &gt; &gt; of clothing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In a scene that seemed to echo the Bailey shooting, the gunman ordered
&gt; &gt; &gt; boys and school aides out, then bound 10 girls ages 6 to 13. He called
&gt; &gt; &gt; his wife on his cellphone.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Police arrived after a teacher ran for help to a nearby farm. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; called him on his cellphone, but no answer. Then the gunman opened
&gt; &gt; &gt; fire, and police stormed the barricaded building, breaking through
&gt; &gt; &gt; windows.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Five of the girls died at the scene or at hospitals. At press time,
&gt; &gt; &gt; officials said five remained in critical condition.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Law-enforcement officials, working to unearth Roberts's motive, said
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tuesday that sexual assault seemed the most likely one. In a suicide
&gt; &gt; &gt; note, they said, Roberts recalled an incident 20 years ago when he, a
&gt; &gt; &gt; pre-teen at the time, molested younger children. The note indicated he
&gt; &gt; &gt; had been haunted by dreams about molesting young girls, police said.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don't think it was an attack on the Amish community, but a target
&gt; &gt; &gt; of opportunity,&quot; Col. Jeffrey Miller, commissioner of the Pennsylvania
&gt; &gt; &gt; State Police, said Monday. &quot;It was almost impenetrable,&quot; he said of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the barricaded school. &quot;His goal was to be in there for an extended
&gt; &gt; &gt; period of time. He was hunkering down for a hostage-related siege.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; 'Copycat' concerns

&gt; &gt; &gt; The apparent similarities between the Bailey and Nickel Mines
&gt; &gt; &gt; shootings - and their close proximity in time - raise experts'
&gt; &gt; &gt; concerns about &quot;copycat&quot; attacks.

What's the point of it being pleasurable if men were "using violence to
control others", presumably also "controlling" women to have sex with
them?

If you havea rat in a Skinner Box and your plan is to grab it and push a
lever with it, you don't need to reward it with some foodies in order to
motivate it to do something in which it has no choice.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of school fatalities. But this premeditated attack, like another one
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; five days earlier in which a drifter corraled teenage girls, killing
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one, at the high school in Bailey, Colo., have an unusual and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing feature: girls as targets.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The predominant pattern in school shootings of the past three decades
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is that girls are the victims,&quot; says Katherine Newman, a Princeton
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; University sociologist whose recent book examines the roots of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;rampage&quot; shootings in rural schools.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dr. Newman has researched 21 school shootings since the 1970s. Though
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it's impossible to know whether girls were randomly victimized in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; those cases, she says, &quot;in every case in the US since the early 1970s
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; we do note this pattern&quot; of girls being the majority of victims.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The two cases are reminiscent of a 1989 shooting in Canada, when a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; jobless hospital worker killed 14 female engineering students at the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; University of Montreal, accusing them of stealing jobs from men, says
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Martin Schwartz, an Ohio University sociologist and an expert on
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; violence against women. He sees such incidents as related to a culture
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of violence against women, &quot;a mutation - something beyond.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In Bailey, an armed drifter walked into Platte Canyon High School last
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Wednesday, ordering men out and sexually assaulting some of the six
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; girls he held hostage, shooting one before killing himself. In this
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; week's tragedy in Pennsylvania's bucolic Lancaster County, the gunman
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ordered boys and adults to leave, bound the 10 girls, and shot them,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; then himself.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Small towns are no safeguard

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Another similarity between the Pennsylvania and Colorado cases - as
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; well as two other recent school shootings in Vermont and Wisconsin -
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is their rural settings. It is rare for mass school shootings to occur
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in cities, Newman says. Despite their safe image, rural communities
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; can be an especially fertile breeding ground for revenge, she and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; others agree.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;People think small towns are safer, but in a small community
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; grievances can fester,&quot; says Cheryl Meyer, a professor of psychology
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, who has researched
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; similarities of school shootings in rural and small towns. &quot;It's so
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; often about revenge. Even if something happened 20 years ago, it
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't mean it is gone. People talk about it and everybody remembers.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It just trails after you.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Such a motive may have factored into Monday's shootings in the tiny
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hamlet of Nickel Mines, Pa., police say.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Flanked by corn fields and a few white oaks, the Amish schoolhouse
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; could have been lifted out of the 19th century. With no guards,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; chain-link fence, or &quot;drug-free zone&quot; signs - or even a telephone - it
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; seemed a world apart.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The gunman, Charles Carl Roberts, lived just down the road with his
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; family in a double-wide trailer. He hauled milk from Amish farms at
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; night, usually before the next day's milking began about 4 a.m. A
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; co-worker says he might never have met the farmers he serviced. Then,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he would take his children to school.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday, however, he left suicide notes for his family, then drove
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his pickup truck to a school he no doubt passed many times on
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; late-night milk routes. He brought to the school a semi-automatic
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pistol, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rifle - along with restraints, lumber to block the doors, and a change
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of clothing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In a scene that seemed to echo the Bailey shooting, the gunman ordered
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; boys and school aides out, then bound 10 girls ages 6 to 13. He called
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his wife on his cellphone.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Police arrived after a teacher ran for help to a nearby farm. They
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; called him on his cellphone, but no answer. Then the gunman opened
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fire, and police stormed the barricaded building, breaking through
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; windows.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Five of the girls died at the scene or at hospitals. At press time,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; officials said five remained in critical condition.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Law-enforcement officials, working to unearth Roberts's motive, said
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Tuesday that sexual assault seemed the most likely one. In a suicide
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; note, they said, Roberts recalled an incident 20 years ago when he, a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pre-teen at the time, molested younger children. The note indicated he
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; had been haunted by dreams about molesting young girls, police said.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don't think it was an attack on the Amish community, but a target
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of opportunity,&quot; Col. Jeffrey Miller, commissioner of the Pennsylvania
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; State Police, said Monday. &quot;It was almost impenetrable,&quot; he said of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the barricaded school. &quot;His goal was to be in there for an extended
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; period of time. He was hunkering down for a hostage-related siege.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 'Copycat' concerns

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The apparent similarities between the Bailey and Nickel Mines
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shootings - and their close proximity in time - raise experts'
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; concerns about &quot;copycat&quot; attacks.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; News media bear some responsibility for this phenomenon, says James
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. This is
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; especially the case when attackers' personalities and grudges are
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; exposed to high-profile public analysis - as when two teenage
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attackers in the Columbine attack were featured on the cover of a news
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; magazine, he says.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We've seen with school shootings and postal shootings that the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shooters can become role models for others,&quot; Dr. Fox says. &quot;While most
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sympathize with the victims, others empathize with the shooters. It's
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the publicity they get that turns the shooter into a celebrity that
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; spawns more of them.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Some see in the latest school shootings echoes of the 1980s, when
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there was a spate of carefully planned attacks on students by adults
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; from outside the schools.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Between 1988 to 1989, there were nine premeditated attacks by adults
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; targeting schoolchildren, says Fox. In those cases, however, there was
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; no pattern of girls being targets - a new wrinkle. To him, that year
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; stands out for its &quot;contagion of adults who got even with society by
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; killing its most beloved members - schoolchildren.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; While national crime statistics show a steady drop in the murder rate,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; including violent school fatalities, there seems to be fewer incidents
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but &quot;more spectacular stuff going on,&quot; Dr. Schwartz says. &quot;Splashy
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; violence is what's going up, even though crime as a whole going down.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The only thing not going down is fear engendered by these types of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; high-profile events.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; For grieving Amish families, driving past the crime scene late into
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the night or talking quietly in small groups nearby, the fierce media
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; glare came as a shock to a community that resolutely avoids the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; spotlight.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I was irate when I first heard about the school, then the hurt
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; started,&quot; says an Amish fireman, who helped maintain a security
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; perimeter around the school late Monday night. He says local firemen
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and policemen had expected a crush of news media, because of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; intense public interest in school shootings. But, he adds, &quot;we never
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; expected to have to deal with it here.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It's unbelievable. We never expected that anything like this would
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; happen,&quot; says Ruth, a Mennonite neighbor who wanted to give only her
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; first name.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don't understand it, but it's not from God,&quot; says Fannie Beiler,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; another Mennonite. &quot;He wants us to love one another.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There are scores of such schools in the quiet farming communities
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; around Lancaster County, a center for the Old Order Amish in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; United States. An estimated 28,000 Amish live in the area - of about
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 200,000 nationwide.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Amish families live simply - no cars, electricity, cellphones, or
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; iPods - and grieve quietly. A keystone of their faith is pacifism.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When a young Amish boy in the next town of Bart was killed on his way
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to help a neighbor with the milking by a hit-and-run driver two weeks
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ago, there was no talk of lawsuits. Nor did Amish families join their
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;English&quot; neighbors in

There are a couple of reasons sex would have evolved to be potentially
pleasurable for a female.  For one thing, there is a certain biological symmetry
between the sexes - if that patch of skin is a primary erogenous zone on men,
it's almost sure to be one on women as well.  It's why men have nipples - some
things are just inherent to the human pattern regardless of gender simply
because it takes a selection pressure of some sort to weed it -out-.  Even if
most sex between men and women were non-consensual, that wouldn't be enough of a
selection pressure to make sex unpleasurable in -all- occasions.  Secondly, a
woman is much more likely to want and care for offspring which didn't result
from a violent rape - it's not the -biggest- selection pressure in the world,
but it's enough to probably be a factor.  As with men, women who find sex
pleasurable will be much more likely to consent to or even initiate it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A pattern in rural school shootings: Girls-as-Targets

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monday's deadly shooting in Nickel Mines, Pa., was the fourth
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such incident in five weeks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By Gail Russell Chaddock and Mark Clayton

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Staff writers of The Christian Science Monitor

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NICKEL MINES, PA., AND BOSTON - The scene Monday at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buff-colored, one-room schoolhouse in the gentle heart of Amish
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; country was wrenching, but also distressingly familiar.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of four fatal school shootings to beset rural America in just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over a month, the rampage that killed five young girls raises anew
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a host of old concerns - about campus security in countryside
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; settings, access to guns by unstable individuals, and &quot;copycat&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violence advanced by media attention.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They are startling incidents against the backdrop of declining
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; numbers of school fatalities. But this premeditated attack, like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another one five days earlier in which a drifter corraled teenage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girls, killing one, at the high school in Bailey, Colo., have an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unusual and disturbing feature: girls as targets.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The predominant pattern in school shootings of the past three
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decades is that girls are the victims,&quot; says Katherine Newman, a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Princeton University sociologist whose recent book examines the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; roots of &quot;rampage&quot; shootings in rural schools.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dr. Newman has researched 21 school shootings since the 1970s.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though it's impossible to know whether girls were randomly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; victimized in those cases, she says, &quot;in every case in the US since
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the early 1970s we do note this pattern&quot; of girls being the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; majority of victims.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The two cases are reminiscent of a 1989 shooting in Canada, when a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jobless hospital worker killed 14 female engineering students at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the University of Montreal, accusing them of stealing jobs from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; men, says Martin Schwartz, an Ohio University sociologist and an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expert on violence against women. He sees such incidents as related
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a culture of violence against women, &quot;a mutation - something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Bailey, an armed drifter walked into Platte Canyon High School
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last Wednesday, ordering men out and sexually assaulting some of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the six girls he held hostage, shooting one before killing himself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this week's tragedy in Pennsylvania's bucolic Lancaster County,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the gunman ordered boys and adults to leave, bound the 10 girls,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and shot them, then himself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Small towns are no safeguard

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another similarity between the Pennsylvania and Colorado cases - as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as two other recent school shootings in Vermont and Wisconsin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - is their rural settings. It is rare for mass school shootings to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occur in cities, Newman says. Despite their safe image, rural
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communities can be an especially fertile breeding ground for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revenge, she and others agree.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;People think small towns are safer, but in a small community
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grievances can fester,&quot; says Cheryl Meyer, a professor of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychology at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, who has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researched similarities of school shootings in rural and small
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; towns. &quot;It's so often about revenge. Even if something happened 20
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago, it doesn't mean it is gone. People talk about it and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everybody remembers. It just trails after you.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a motive may have factored into Monday's shootings in the tiny
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hamlet of Nickel Mines, Pa., police say.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Flanked by corn fields and a few white oaks, the Amish schoolhouse
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could have been lifted out of the 19th century. With no guards,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chain-link fence, or &quot;drug-free zone&quot; signs - or even a telephone -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it seemed a world apart.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The gunman, Charles Carl Roberts, lived just down the road with his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family in a double-wide trailer. He hauled milk from Amish farms at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; night, usually before the next day's milking began about 4 a.m. A
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; co-worker says he might never have met the farmers he serviced.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then, he would take his children to school.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday, however, he left suicide notes for his family, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove his pickup truck to a school he no doubt passed many times on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; late-night milk routes. He brought to the school a semi-automatic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pistol, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rifle - along with restraints, lumber to block the doors, and a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change of clothing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a scene that seemed to echo the Bailey shooting, the gunman
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ordered boys and school aides out, then bound 10 girls ages 6 to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 13. He called his wife on his cellphone.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Police arrived after a teacher ran for help to a nearby farm. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called him on his cellphone, but no answer. Then the gunman opened
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire, and police stormed the barricaded building, breaking through
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; windows.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Five of the girls died at the scene or at hospitals. At press time,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; officials said five remained in critical condition.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Law-enforcement officials, working to unearth Roberts's motive,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said Tuesday that sexual assault seemed the most likely one. In a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suicide note, they said, Roberts recalled an incident 20 years ago
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he, a pre-teen at the time, molested younger children. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; note indicated he had been haunted by dreams about molesting young
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girls, police said.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don't think it was an attack on the Amish community, but a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; target of opportunity,&quot; Col. Jeffrey Miller, commissioner of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pennsylvania State Police, said Monday. &quot;It was almost
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impenetrable,&quot; he said of the barricaded school. &quot;His goal was to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be in there for an extended period of time. He was hunkering down
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a hostage-related siege.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'Copycat' concerns

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The apparent similarities between the Bailey and Nickel Mines
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shootings - and their close proximity in time - raise experts'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerns about &quot;copycat&quot; attacks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; News media bear some responsibility for this phenomenon, says James
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially the case when attackers' personalities and grudges are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exposed to high-profile public analysis - as when two teenage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attackers in the Columbine attack were featured on the cover of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; news magazine, he says.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We've seen with school shootings and postal shootings that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shooters can become role models for others,&quot; Dr. Fox says. &quot;While
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most sympathize with the victims, others empathize with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shooters. It's the publicity they get that turns the shooter into a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; celebrity that spawns more of them.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some see in the latest school shootings echoes of the 1980s, when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was a spate of carefully planned attacks on students by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adults from outside the schools.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Between 1988 to 1989, there were nine premeditated attacks by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adults targeting schoolchildren, says Fox. In those cases, however,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was no pattern of girls being targets - a new wrinkle. To
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that year stands out for its &quot;contagion of adults who got even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with society by killing its most beloved members - schoolchildren.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While national crime statistics show a steady drop in the murder
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rate, including violent school fatalities, there seems to be fewer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incidents but &quot;more spectacular stuff going on,&quot; Dr. Schwartz says.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Splashy violence is what's going up, even though crime as a whole
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going down. The only thing not going down is fear engendered by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these types of high-profile events.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For grieving Amish families, driving past the crime scene late into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the night or talking quietly in small groups nearby, the fierce
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; media glare came as a shock to a community that resolutely avoids

So are men using violence to control others or not?  Not very

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A pattern in rural school shootings: Girls-as-Targets

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Monday's deadly shooting in Nickel Mines, Pa., was the fourth
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such incident in five weeks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By Gail Russell Chaddock and Mark Clayton

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Staff writers of The Christian Science Monitor

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NICKEL MINES, PA., AND BOSTON - The scene Monday at the buff-colored,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one-room schoolhouse in the gentle heart of Amish country was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrenching, but also distressingly familiar.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of four fatal school shootings to beset rural America in just over
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a month, the rampage that killed five young girls raises anew a host
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of old concerns - about campus security in countryside settings,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; access to guns by unstable individuals, and &quot;copycat&quot; violence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advanced by media attention.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They are startling incidents against the backdrop of declining numbers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of school fatalities. But this premeditated attack, like another one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; five days earlier in which a drifter corraled teenage girls, killing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one, at the high school in Bailey, Colo., have an unusual and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing feature: girls as targets.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The predominant pattern in school shootings of the past three decades
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is that girls are the victims,&quot; says Katherine Newman, a Princeton
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; University sociologist whose recent book examines the roots of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;rampage&quot; shootings in rural schools.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dr. Newman has researched 21 school shootings since the 1970s. Though
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's impossible to know whether girls were randomly victimized in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those cases, she says, &quot;in every case in the US since the early 1970s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we do note this pattern&quot; of girls being the majority of victims.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The two cases are reminiscent of a 1989 shooting in Canada, when a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jobless hospital worker killed 14 female engineering students at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; University of Montreal, accusing them of stealing jobs from men, says
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Martin Schwartz, an Ohio University sociologist and an expert on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violence against women. He sees such incidents as related to a culture
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of violence against women, &quot;a mutation - something beyond.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Bailey, an armed drifter walked into Platte Canyon High School last
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wednesday, ordering men out and sexually assaulting some of the six
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girls he held hostage, shooting one before killing himself. In this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; week's tragedy in Pennsylvania's bucolic Lancaster County, the gunman
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ordered boys and adults to leave, bound the 10 girls, and shot them,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then himself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Small towns are no safeguard

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another similarity between the Pennsylvania and Colorado cases - as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as two other recent school shootings in Vermont and Wisconsin -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is their rural settings. It is rare for mass school shootings to occur
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in cities, Newman says. Despite their safe image, rural communities
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be an especially fertile breeding ground for revenge, she and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others agree.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;People think small towns are safer, but in a small community
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grievances can fester,&quot; says Cheryl Meyer, a professor of psychology
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, who has researched
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; similarities of school shootings in rural and small towns. &quot;It's so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often about revenge. Even if something happened 20 years ago, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't mean it is gone. People talk about it and everybody remembers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It just trails after you.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a motive may have factored into Monday's shootings in the tiny
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hamlet of Nickel Mines, Pa., police say.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Flanked by corn fields and a few white oaks, the Amish schoolhouse
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could have been lifted out of the 19th century. With no guards,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chain-link fence, or &quot;drug-free zone&quot; signs - or even a telephone - it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seemed a world apart.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The gunman, Charles Carl Roberts, lived just down the road with his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family in a double-wide trailer. He hauled milk from Amish farms at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; night, usually before the next day's milking began about 4 a.m. A
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; co-worker says he might never have met the farmers he serviced. Then,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he would take his children to school.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday, however, he left suicide notes for his family, then drove
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his pickup truck to a school he no doubt passed many times on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; late-night milk routes. He brought to the school a semi-automatic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pistol, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rifle - along with restraints, lumber to block the doors, and a change
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of clothing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a scene that seemed to echo the Bailey shooting, the gunman ordered
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boys and school aides out, then bound 10 girls ages 6 to 13. He called
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his wife on his cellphone.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Police arrived after a teacher ran for help to a nearby farm. They
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called him on his cellphone, but no answer. Then the gunman opened
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire, and police stormed the barricaded building, breaking through
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; windows.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Five of the girls died at the scene or at hospitals. At press time,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; officials said five remained in critical condition.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Law-enforcement officials, working to unearth Roberts's motive, said
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tuesday that sexual assault seemed the most likely one. In a suicide
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; note, they said, Roberts recalled an incident 20 years ago when he, a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pre-teen at the time, molested younger children. The note indicated he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had been haunted by dreams about molesting young girls, police said.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don't think it was an attack on the Amish community, but a target
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of opportunity,&quot; Col. Jeffrey Miller, commissioner of the Pennsylvania
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; State Police, said Monday. &quot;It was almost impenetrable,&quot; he said of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the barricaded school. &quot;His goal was to be in there for an extended
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; period of time. He was hunkering down for a hostage-related siege.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'Copycat' concerns

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The apparent similarities between the Bailey and Nickel Mines
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shootings - and their close proximity in time - raise experts'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerns about &quot;copycat&quot; attacks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; News media bear some responsibility for this phenomenon, says James
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially the case when attackers' personalities and grudges are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exposed to high-profile public analysis - as when two teenage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attackers in the Columbine attack were featured on the cover of a news
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magazine, he says.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We've seen with school shootings and postal shootings that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shooters can become role models for others,&quot; Dr. Fox says. &quot;While most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sympathize with the victims, others empathize with the shooters. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the publicity they get that turns the shooter into a celebrity that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spawns more of them.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some see in the latest school shootings echoes of the 1980s, when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was a spate of carefully planned attacks on students by adults
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from outside the schools.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Between 1988 to 1989, there were nine premeditated attacks by adults
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; targeting schoolchildren, says Fox. In those cases, however, there was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no pattern of girls being targets - a new wrinkle. To him, that year
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stands out for its &quot;contagion of adults who got even with society by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing its most beloved members - schoolchildren.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While national crime statistics show a steady drop in the murder rate,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including violent school fatalities, there seems to be fewer incidents
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but &quot;more spectacular stuff going on,&quot; Dr. Schwartz says. &quot;Splashy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violence is what's going up, even though crime as a whole going down.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only thing not going down is fear engendered by these types of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high-profile events.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For grieving Amish families, driving past the crime scene late into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the night or talking quietly in small groups nearby, the fierce media
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glare came as a shock to a community that resolutely avoids the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spotlight.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I was irate when I first heard about the school, then the hurt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started,&quot; says an Amish fireman, who helped maintain a security
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perimeter around the school late Monday night. He says local firemen
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and policemen had expected a crush of news media, because of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intense public interest in school shootings. But, he adds, &quot;we never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expected to have to deal with it here.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It's unbelievable. We never expected that anything like this would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen,&quot; says Ruth, a Mennonite neighbor who wanted to give only her
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first name.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don't understand it, but it's not from God,&quot; says Fannie Beiler,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another Mennonite. &quot;He wants us to love one another.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are scores of such schools in the quiet farming communities
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around Lancaster County, a center for the Old Order Amish in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; United States. An estimated 28,000 Amish live in the area - of about

&gt;There are a couple of reasons sex would have evolved to be potentially
&gt;pleasurable for a female.  For one thing, there is a certain biological symmetry
&gt;between the sexes - if that patch of skin is a primary erogenous zone on men,
&gt;it's almost sure to be one on women as well.  It's why men have nipples - some
&gt;things are just inherent to the human pattern regardless of gender simply
&gt;because it takes a selection pressure of some sort to weed it -out-.  Even if
&gt;most sex between men and women were non-consensual, that wouldn't be enough of a
&gt;selection pressure to make sex unpleasurable in -all- occasions.  Secondly, a
&gt;woman is much more likely to want and care for offspring which didn't result
&gt;from a violent rape - it's not the -biggest- selection pressure in the world,
&gt;but it's enough to probably be a factor.  As with men, women who find sex
&gt;pleasurable will be much more likely to consent to or even initiate it.
">

If only women came with a dog-tag that said: "Best when used by (the
date).", sort of like a milk container does&lt;bg&gt;

Or at least admit to it when they don't really like sex, before a Man
becomes involved with them, in the first place.

Like that's _ever_ going to happen !!!

&gt; A pattern in rural school shootings: Girls-as-Targets

&gt; Monday's deadly shooting in Nickel Mines, Pa., was the fourth
&gt; such incident in five weeks.

&gt; By Gail Russell Chaddock and Mark Clayton

&gt; Staff writers of The Christian Science Monitor

&gt; NICKEL MINES, PA., AND BOSTON – The scene Monday at the buff-colored,
&gt; one-room schoolhouse in the gentle heart of Amish country was
&gt; wrenching, but also distressingly familiar.

&gt; One of four fatal school shootings to beset rural America in just over
&gt; a month, the rampage that killed five young girls raises anew a host
&gt; of old concerns - about campus security in countryside settings,
&gt; access to guns by unstable individuals, and &quot;copycat&quot; violence
&gt; advanced by media attention.

&gt; They are startling incidents against the backdrop of declining numbers
&gt; of school fatalities. But this premeditated attack, like another one
&gt; five days earlier in which a drifter corraled teenage girls, killing
&gt; one, at the high school in Bailey, Colo., have an unusual and
&gt; disturbing feature: girls as targets.

&gt; &quot;The predominant pattern in school shootings of the past three decades
&gt; is that girls are the victims,&quot; says Katherine Newman, a Princeton
&gt; University sociologist whose recent book examines the roots of
&gt; &quot;rampage&quot; shootings in rural schools.

&gt; Dr. Newman has researched 21 school shootings since the 1970s. Though
&gt; it's impossible to know whether girls were randomly victimized in
&gt; those cases, she says, &quot;in every case in the US since the early 1970s
&gt; we do note this pattern&quot; of girls being the majority of victims.

&gt; The two cases are reminiscent of a 1989 shooting in Canada, when a
&gt; jobless hospital worker killed 14 female engineering students at the
&gt; University of Montreal, accusing them of stealing jobs from men, says
&gt; Martin Schwartz, an Ohio University sociologist and an expert on
&gt; violence against women. He sees such incidents as related to a culture
&gt; of violence against women, &quot;a mutation - something beyond.&quot;

&gt; In Bailey, an armed drifter walked into Platte Canyon High School last
&gt; Wednesday, ordering men out and sexually assaulting some of the six
&gt; girls he held hostage, shooting one before killing himself. In this
&gt; week's tragedy in Pennsylvania's bucolic Lancaster County, the gunman
&gt; ordered boys and adults to leave, bound the 10 girls, and shot them,
&gt; then himself.

&gt; Small towns are no safeguard

&gt; Another similarity between the Pennsylvania and Colorado cases - as
&gt; well as two other recent school shootings in Vermont and Wisconsin -
&gt; is their rural settings. It is rare for mass school shootings to occur
&gt; in cities, Newman says. Despite their safe image, rural communities
&gt; can be an especially fertile breeding ground for revenge, she and
&gt; others agree.

&gt; &quot;People think small towns are safer, but in a small community
&gt; grievances can fester,&quot; says Cheryl Meyer, a professor of psychology
&gt; at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, who has researched
&gt; similarities of school shootings in rural and small towns. &quot;It's so
&gt; often about revenge. Even if something happened 20 years ago, it
&gt; doesn't mean it is gone. People talk about it and everybody remembers.
&gt; It just trails after you.&quot;

&gt; Such a motive may have factored into Monday's shootings in the tiny
&gt; hamlet of Nickel Mines, Pa., police say.

&gt; Flanked by corn fields and a few white oaks, the Amish schoolhouse
&gt; could have been lifted out of the 19th century. With no guards,
&gt; chain-link fence, or &quot;drug-free zone&quot; signs - or even a telephone - it
&gt; seemed a world apart.

&gt; The gunman, Charles Carl Roberts, lived just down the road with his
&gt; family in a double-wide trailer. He hauled milk from Amish farms at
&gt; night, usually before the next day's milking began about 4 a.m. A
&gt; co-worker says he might never have met the farmers he serviced. Then,
&gt; he would take his children to school.

&gt; On Monday, however, he left suicide notes for his family, then drove
&gt; his pickup truck to a school he no doubt passed many times on
&gt; late-night milk routes. He brought to the school a semi-automatic
&gt; pistol, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a
&gt; rifle - along with restraints, lumber to block the doors, and a change
&gt; of clothing.

&gt; In a scene that seemed to echo the Bailey shooting, the gunman ordered
&gt; boys and school aides out, then bound 10 girls ages 6 to 13. He called
&gt; his wife on his cellphone.

&gt; Police arrived after a teacher ran for help to a nearby farm. They
&gt; called him on his cellphone, but no answer. Then the gunman opened
&gt; fire, and police stormed the barricaded building, breaking through
&gt; windows.

&gt; Five of the girls died at the scene or at hospitals. At press time,
&gt; officials said five remained in critical condition.

&gt; Law-enforcement officials, working to unearth Roberts's motive, said
&gt; Tuesday that sexual assault seemed the most likely one. In a suicide
&gt; note, they said, Roberts recalled an incident 20 years ago when he, a
&gt; pre-teen at the time, molested younger children. The note indicated he
&gt; had been haunted by dreams about molesting young girls, police said.

&gt; &quot;I don't think it was an attack on the Amish community, but a target
&gt; of opportunity,&quot; Col. Jeffrey Miller, commissioner of the Pennsylvania
&gt; State Police, said Monday. &quot;It was almost impenetrable,&quot; he said of
&gt; the barricaded school. &quot;His goal was to be in there for an extended
&gt; period of time. He was hunkering down for a hostage-related siege.&quot;

&gt; 'Copycat' concerns

&gt; The apparent similarities between the Bailey and Nickel Mines
&gt; shootings - and their close proximity in time - raise experts'
&gt; concerns about &quot;copycat&quot; attacks.

&gt; News media bear some responsibility for this phenomenon, says James
&gt; Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. This is
&gt; especially the case when attackers' personalities and grudges are
&gt; exposed to high-profile public analysis - as when two teenage
&gt; attackers in the Columbine attack were featured on the cover of a news
&gt; magazine, he says.

&gt; &quot;We've seen with school shootings and postal shootings that the
&gt; shooters can become role models for others,&quot; Dr. Fox says. &quot;While most
&gt; sympathize with the victims, others empathize with the shooters. It's
&gt; the publicity they get that turns the shooter into a celebrity that
&gt; spawns more of them.&quot;

&gt; Some see in the latest school shootings echoes of the 1980s, when
&gt; there was a spate of carefully planned attacks on students by adults
&gt; from outside the schools.

&gt; Between 1988 to 1989, there were nine premeditated attacks by adults
&gt; targeting schoolchildren, says Fox. In those cases, however, there was
&gt; no pattern of girls being targets - a new wrinkle. To him, that year
&gt; stands out for its &quot;contagion of adults who got even with society by
&gt; killing its most beloved members - schoolchildren.&quot;

&gt; While national crime statistics show a steady drop in the murder rate,
&gt; including violent school fatalities, there seems to be fewer incidents
&gt; but &quot;more spectacular stuff going on,&quot; Dr. Schwartz says. &quot;Splashy
&gt; violence is what's going up, even though crime as a whole going down.
&gt; The only thing not going down is fear engendered by these types of
&gt; high-profile events.&quot;

&gt; For grieving Amish families, driving past the crime scene late into
&gt; the night or talking quietly in small groups nearby, the fierce media
&gt; glare came as a shock to a community that resolutely avoids the
&gt; spotlight.

&gt; &quot;I was irate when I first heard about the school, then the hurt
&gt; started,&quot; says an Amish fireman, who helped maintain a security
&gt; perimeter around the school late Monday night. He says local firemen
&gt; and policemen had expected a crush of news media, because of the
&gt; intense public interest in school shootings. But, he adds, &quot;we never
&gt; expected to have to deal with it here.&quot;

&gt; &quot;It's unbelievable. We never expected that anything like this would
&gt; happen,&quot; says Ruth, a Mennonite neighbor who wanted to give only her
&gt; first name.

&gt; &quot;I don't understand it, but it's not from God,&quot; says Fannie Beiler,
&gt; another Mennonite. &quot;He wants us to love one another.&quot;

&gt; There are scores of such schools in the quiet farming communities
&gt; around Lancaster County, a center for the Old Order Amish in the
&gt; United States. An estimated 28,000 Amish live in the area - of about
&gt; 200,000 nationwide.

&gt; Amish families live simply - no cars, electricity, cellphones, or
&gt; iPods - and grieve quietly. A keystone of their faith is pacifism.
&gt; When a young Amish boy in the next town of Bart was killed on his way
&gt; to help a neighbor with the milking by a hit-and-run driver two weeks
&gt; ago, there was no talk of lawsuits. Nor did Amish families join their
&gt; &quot;English&quot; neighbors in calling for a new sign cautioning drivers to
&gt; slow down.

&gt; In Bart, Paula Flinn set up a hand-painted sign on her front lawn for
&gt; their Amish neighbors, who drove past the house in closed, black
&gt; buggies at a rate of 50 an hour, some late into the night, after the
&gt; shooting. Her sign reads: &quot;Our prayers and thoughts are with you.&quot;

OH please, the only reason why those stories got so much publicity was
because it WAS women that did it, men do horrible gruesome things too,
adn are more prone to violence then women. This stems from the way
society allows men and women to express their emotions, women are
encouraged to express how we feel, and men are told at an early age
that only rage is appropriate. Unfortunatly there is too much pressure
on men these days, they can't express emotions in healthy ways alot of
the time, as the back lash form their friends would be worse then the
cause itself. High school especially is tough on young men, there is so
much pressure to fit in... As with women who are pressured more and
more by the media these days to appear sexy and more. I think the term
"feminist dumb cunt" is really insulting and shows what kind of man you
are when you get angry spewing violent angry words. ITs guys like you
that cause alot of this stuff, being closed minded and un resistant to
change. I find this very insulting as another "feminist dumb cunt" and
reccomend that maybe you should invest in a gym membership the next
time you get insulted by a female, instead of resorting to violence!
Take a look in the mirror, I hope you don't have children that may be
learning from you and might be the next ones that get angry.....

Women, in the work place, make up 80% of those responsible for
bullying.
I believe that the following is true, at least with regard to American
women.:
"Women, at least American women, have little tolerance for any man who
demonstrates
any character and/or self respect. Rather, they will denigrate,
discriminate against, and
oppress the same."
Those whose only experience with women is with women in the USA
will dismiss the same statement as extremist. The think that the same
is the norm
with all women through out the world. It isn't.
However, scientific logic in the form of inductive reason (from a
multitude of
personal experiences both private and public) form the basis of the
validity
of that statement, at least in the USA where gender relations are
probably worse than
in any other nation.
The horrendus personal, economic, and social discrimination faced by
returning
Vietnam veterans by women was generally caused by the same.
Psychologists state that this discrimination by women against returning
Vietnam veterans was the result of the feeling that these veterans
represented
"the strong male image".
I, personally, abhor any violence against any human being and can state
categorically
that I have lost employment for defending women from physical and
emotional abuse.
However, given the general oppressive attitude towards men by women and
their "metro male" allies, there is no question that the same has
promulgated violence towards women especially by men with mental
illness or severe mental stress associated with the same.

as I stated , because there is so much pressure on men, sometimes anger
is the only reaction they are allowed.... girls in the past of course
have done awful things too, and tend to get more publicity due to the
fact they are women, and we are "not supposed" to act that way.. sadely
its just not as surprising when it comes from a male than a female, its
not right or fair, its just the way it is.....

&gt; there was a spate of carefully planned attacks on students by adults
&gt; from outside the schools.

&gt; Between 1988 to 1989, there were nine premeditated attacks by adults
&gt; targeting schoolchildren, says Fox. In those cases, however, there was
&gt; no pattern of girls being targets - a new wrinkle. To him, that year
&gt; stands out for its &quot;contagion of adults who got even with society by
&gt; killing its most beloved members - schoolchildren.&quot;

&gt; While national crime statistics show a steady drop in the murder rate,
&gt; including violent school fatalities, there seems to be fewer incidents
&gt; but &quot;more spectacular stuff going on,&quot; Dr. Schwartz says. &quot;Splashy
&gt; violence is what's going up, even though crime as a whole going down.
&gt; The only thing not going down is fear engendered by these types of
&gt; high-profile events.&quot;

&gt; For grieving Amish families, driving past the crime scene late into
&gt; the night or talking quietly in small groups nearby, the fierce media
&gt; glare came as a shock to a community that resolutely avoids the
&gt; spotlight.

&gt; &quot;I was irate when I first heard about the school, then the hurt
&gt; started,&quot; says an Amish fireman, who helped maintain a security
&gt; perimeter around the school late Monday night. He says local firemen
&gt; and policemen had expected a crush of news media, because of the
&gt; intense public interest in school shootings. But, he adds, &quot;we never
&gt; expected to have to deal with it here.&quot;

&gt; &quot;It's unbelievable. We never expected that anything like this would
&gt; happen,&quot; says Ruth, a Mennonite neighbor who wanted to give only her
&gt; first name.

&gt; &quot;I don't understand it, but it's not from God,&quot; says Fannie Beiler,
&gt; another Mennonite. &quot;He wants us to love one another.&quot;

&gt; There are scores of such schools in the quiet farming communities
&gt; around Lancaster County, a center for the Old Order Amish in the
&gt; United States. An estimated 28,000 Amish live in the area - of about
&gt; 200,000 nationwide.

&gt; Amish families live simply - no cars, electricity, cellphones, or
&gt; iPods - and grieve quietly. A keystone of their faith is pacifism.
&gt; When a young Amish boy in the next town of Bart was killed on his way
&gt; to help a neighbor with the milking by a hit-and-run driver two weeks
&gt; ago, there was no talk of lawsuits. Nor did Amish families join their
&gt; &quot;English&quot; neighbors in calling for a new sign cautioning drivers to
&gt; slow down.

&gt; In Bart, Paula Flinn set up a hand-painted sign on her front lawn for
&gt; their Amish neighbors, who drove past the house in closed, black
&gt; buggies at a rate of 50 an hour, some late into the night, after the
&gt; shooting. Her sign reads: &quot;Our prayers and thoughts are with you.&quot;

Relative PC semantical dogma aside, violence has always been the most
acute/efficacious energy vector acting upon the substrate of human
agency - if you want to effect/alter human behavior/condition
dynamics, nothing is so expedient as forceful appeal.

Such incurred fallout of sex-antagonism(ex. selective killing of
females) can expidite the appeal of visceral determination in selection
culling - effectively liberating male sovereignty from behind a flaccid
tenure of codified proxy which sublimates male
sex/reproductive interest in the resolution of biological imperative.

Equality is a farce.

Anyone who subscribes to the whole *egalitarian* conceit is truly
delusional.

If nothing else, feminism further attests to how clique-affiliations
pragmatically campaign in favor of perceived status redressments rather
than utopian fantasy-interpretations of 'equality'(excepting
delusional, sublimated imbeciles).

Appeals to 'equality' are a monolithic pretense/euphemism for
fem-license, which men(governed by their effete mean) are loathe to
contravene(observed in its exempt status from taboo scrutiny, beneath
an impenetrable aegis of their most sacred-cow)for a tacit fear of
exposing fallout antagonisms in contesting a sovereignty of rival male
interests(through their often visceral determination).

Thus, prevailing infrastructures - which are mere monuments to this
grand pretext(derivative constructs) - cannot be appealed to(so to
speak) in their own deconstruction(nor assailed directly) until they
have been duly eroded through market-entropy.

The 'equality' which is frequently invoked as a sentimental idiom of
logic is expressed within stochastic media as a terminal cancellation
of energy - depriving selection of it's 'work' through entropy(which is
what west/euro civ has effected by encapsulating itself in a
closed-system of female-license, where entropy of it's selection
paradigm can propagate through the retrograde of it's reproductive
fitness).

A stasis of market equilibrium does not manifest in reality(where it's
constituent dynamics oscillate as a function of highly refractable
eneregy vectors on an emergent scale) outside the terminal cancellation
of energy.

Romantic idiots will achieve the starkest of equalities only through
the ineffable/inexorable respite of the void(which is hopefully not far
off).

When we begin to disseminate the nexus of informational demogoguey from
behind it's prism of equivocation, we will be tempering a lever for the
sovereignty of male interest(curbing female license is the only accord
males need abide).

&gt;&gt; &gt;Didn't evolve, it's always been pleasurable

&gt;&gt; What's the point of it being pleasurable if men were &quot;using violence

&gt;&gt; If you havea rat in a Skinner Box and your plan is to grab it and
