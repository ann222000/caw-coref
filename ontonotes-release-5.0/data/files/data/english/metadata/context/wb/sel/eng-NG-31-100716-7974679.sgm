FALSE FLAG TERROR DRILL PORTLAND OREGON - AUG 5 !!!!! &quot;a perfect storm
of terror, treason and totalitarianism.&quot;

This sounds VERY serious.
Please pass this information around to everyone you know

NOBLE RESOLVE - OPEN LETTER TO PETER DEFAZIO
author: fear no terror
http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2007/07/362706.shtml

NOBLE RESOLVE is too dangerous to allow in Oregon. This exercise,
drilling War of Terror scenarios in Oregon, comes just as the media is
filling up with warnings of a new 9/11 and the recent Presidential
Executive Orders: NSPD 51, 5/10/07, &quot;... allows the sitting president
to declare a &quot;national emergency&quot; without Congressional approval...&quot;

It's looking more and more like &quot;a perfect storm of terror, treason
and totalitarianism.&quot; Drills like these have a history of going live
(e.g. 09/11/01 &amp; 07/07/05) and now we have NSPD 51 - the equivalent of
Hitler's Article 48.

NO NOBLE RESOLVE FOR OREGON
July 24, 2007
Rep. Peter DeFazio
2134 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20515-3704

Eugene, OR 97401

Dear Congressman DeFazio:

The Oregonian recently reported on your investigation of President
Bush's &quot;continuity of government&quot; Executive Order, and on how the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) thwarted your request for
details. As I am sure you are aware, DHS will be leading two emergency
response drills in Portland over the next 3 months: &quot;Noble Resolve&quot; in
August and &quot;Top Off&quot; in October. Just as you rightly sought details on
the Bush Executive Order, Oregon citizens need and deserve information
about these military exercises.

We are concerned that federal, state and local agencies will not plan
and conduct these &quot;terrorism drills&quot; with sufficient transparency and
public oversight. To address this need for local awareness of,
agreement to, and participation in exercises ostensibly designed for
local security, safety and welfare, we propose the immediate formation
of a Portland Citizens' Oversight Committee to represent citizens'
interests.

We request your endorsement of this reasonable request and hope you
will assist us in establishing such an oversight committee. We hope
you will agree that when a Federal agency such as DHS seeks to conduct
exercises in Oregon, full transparency to the public and oversight by
Oregon citizens is essential.

Our initial research on the Top Off exercise revealed contradictory
statements and a disturbing lack of openness on the part of local
officials. We do know that Portland will receive $2 million for the
Top Off exercise alone. No such figure has been publicized regarding
Noble Resolve. The Top Off drill, which DHS calls a &quot;terrorism
drill&quot; (but local officials refer to as an &quot;emergency preparedness
exercise&quot;) will begin on approximately 10/5/07, to last for 9 to 10
days. Though Noble Resolve is scheduled for August, no similar details
or schedule have been released. We therefore have a series of
immediate concerns about this exercise:

* what will be the precipitating event?
* will there be enhanced police presence?
* will the National Guard be involved?
* will there be contractors involved (e.g., Blackwater)?
* and will either or both drills involve rehearsals of local and
federal response to a &quot;catastrophic emergency,&quot; as defined under NSPD
51, up to and including the declaration of martial law?

With the Bush track record on disaster response and media
manipulation, Oregonians are not naive enough to trust the Federal
government to adequately inform and interact with Portland residents
prior to these terrorism drills. Case in point, as of now, there has
not even been an announcement about Noble Resolve, and it is due to
take place in August, just days or weeks from now.

Another general concern is that the Mayor's office seemed almost
unaware of the recent Presidential Executive Orders: NSPD 51, 5/10/07,
&quot;... allows the sitting president to declare a &quot;national emergency&quot;
without Congressional approval, leading to the de facto closing down
of the Legislature and the militarization of justice and law
enforcement&quot;; and the amended International Emergency Economic Powers
Act, 7/17/07, &quot;allowing the US regime to seize the property of anyone
found to be interfering with the reconstruction of Iraq.&quot; In
correspondence with both the Mayor's office and Commissioner Sam
Adams' office, I have provided material to round out their knowledge
of these Presidential directives.

We would be glad to discuss this matter with you or your staff
further, and/or supply resources in addition to those referenced
below, that will corroborate the concerns expressed in this letter. We
will copy this letter to other Congresspersons, Senators Wyden and
Smith, Governor Kulongowski, Mayor Potter, members of City Council,
and a variety of local press and online media, to raise awareness of
these drills and our urgent proposal for enhanced transparency and
public involvement, given the current political climate. We hope to
receive your response this week, given the exigency of the August
drill. Please inform your staff that we will make a follow up call on
this matter if we do not hear back from you.

Thank you and we look forward to talking with you or a representative.

Best regards,
Informed Dissent

Noble Resolve 2007. What's it all about.

Let me start by saying, because I am writing on this subject does not
mean I think a false flag operation will happen during these drills.
Every year the government run drills but not this relativistic. One of
the last drills that even came close was the Drills ran on September
11, 2001.
NORAD's 9/11 wargames
http://www.oilempire.us/norad.html

Noble Resolve is a set of drills that will simulate nuclear attacks,
starting in Europe and moving to the United States. The simulations
will test the reaction of 2 million people in the event of such an
attack.

The drills are being run by Joint Task Force Command (JTFCOM),
Northern Command (NORTHCOM), J9 Joint Innovation and Experimentation
Directorate, FEMA's command bunker, the Department of Homeland
Security, and Virginia police.
The US Marines are also running &quot;Emerald Express 07&quot; in Virginia
on April 24 as part of their Urban Warrior 07 drill package.

Some of the data that will be looked at is;
1. Reaction to 2 million casualties.
2. Martial Law being invoked.
3. The resistance of people being rounded up and being put into camps.
4. Response time and coordination of Federal, State, and Local units.

A few things dealing with Noble Resolve 2007 are;
1. A Podcast at USJFCOM http://www.nowpublic.com/usjfcom_gears_up_for_noble_resolve_podcast

2. The news link, http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2007/pa033007.html

In an article by Global Research, it is stated that Vice President
Dick Cheney has been telling of how a threat like the one the drills
are patterned after are highly likely.

This week Dick Cheney has also been warning of the &quot;very real&quot;
threat of a nuclear attack on an American city. Could the Nobel
Resolve drills be used as a screen for a false-flag attack to be
blamed on Iran, Hezbollah, Al-Qaeda, or sheep-dipped Americans like
Adam Gadahn?

With the V.P running around using these scare tactics as he did before
the canceled drills in North Carolina, makes you leery of what this
government will do for a New World Order. The reason the test in North
Carolina was canceled was that it was leaked by a General that was
fearful of what might happen. He was immediately fired.

It is too late to try and stop it, but we can keep our eyes and ears
open for anything that might happen. It seems that the MSM is not
telling of these drills, so we must be the watchdogs.

Peter DeFazio and the Portland Nuke

By Captain Eric H. May
Military Correspondent
29 jul 2007
http://estrecho.indymedia.org/newswire/display/69726/index.php

&quot;Maybe the people who think there's a conspiracy out there are right.&quot;
Congressman Peter DeFazio, 7/20/07

False Flags

About a quarter hour into my half hour interview with her Wednesday,
Penny Dodge, chief of staff for Oregon's Congressman Peter DeFazio,
asked me what a &quot;false flag&quot; attack was. I explained it in a few
words.

A false flag attack is one in which you attack your own people, then
blame it on a group of people you want to attack. It's a radical
stratagem for instantly creating hatred, and it's common, historically
speaking, all the way from ancient to modern times. For example:

* The Roman Emperor Nero burned Rome, then blamed it on emerging
Christianity.
* The German Fuhrer Hitler burned the Reichstag, then blamed it on
communist Jewry.
* The American President Bush demolished the World Trade Center, then
blamed it on radical Islam.

At present, &quot;false flag&quot; is a highly relevant term, as Ms. Dodge and
her boss Rep. DeFazio have learned from their constituents back home
in Oregon. Folks in the Pacific Northwest, especially around Portland,
believe that they may be the victims of a false flag attack by the
Bush Administration under cover of an upcoming government terror
exercise, Operation Noble Resolve.

Atomic August

As I pointed out in my column last week, Next 9/11, Summer 2007?,
Operation Noble Resolve, to be conducted in August, will involve
extensive mobilization of Homeland Security and U.S. military forces
to simulate a wide range of catastrophic terror events in Oregon. The
grand finale will be the simulation of a ten kiloton atomic bomb in
Portland.

But what if they decide to use a real bomb rather than simulate it?

No doubt 99 percent of the participants in Noble Resolve believe it is
a mere readiness exercise, but what if one percent -- inserted by Bush
cronies -- believe it is the perfect cover for setting off a real
nuke? This is, after all, what happened on 9/11/01, when U.S. military
commands were simulating terror airline strikes on U.S. skyscrapers --
which is exactly what happened. It's also what happened on 7/7/05,
when London police were simulating terror subway strikes -- which is
exactly what happened. The criminal one percent effectively hijacked
those exercises while the 99 percent of honest participants were as
shocked as the general public, and simply carried on with the scenario
they had been practicing, which had now become &quot;live.&quot;

When the horrific events that government exercises are supposed to be
practicing against turn out to be the exact events that occur, then it
is insanity to continue to put blind faith in the motives of the
government. On the other hand, it is highest sanity to document,
organize, and protest against a possible false flag attack, as the
constituents and congressional folk of Oregon are now doing.

Prayers for Portland

An effective grassroots movement is growing in Oregon, and it has
pushed Congressman DeFazio in the right direction. Early summer
anxiety by his constituents concerned him little, as he then issued
assurances that all was on the level with pending federal terror
exercises, and the recently enacted National Security Presidential
Directive 51, which allows Bush to establish a dictatorship if there
is a catastrophic natural event or terror attack.

DeFazio's assurances didn't convince his constituents, though, and
soon they didn't even convince him. Just to make sure that everything
was on the level with NSPD-51, he asked to see the secret annexes of
the document. This was his right as a member of the House Homeland
Security Committee, and in his 20 years in Congress he had never been
refused access to classified documents.

There's a first time for everything, though. After initially granting
DeFazio permission to check into NSPD-51, the White House reversed
itself on 7/18/07, and refused to let him take a look. Friday,
DeFazio, along with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bernie
Thompson and Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Chris Carney, sent a
letter to the White House. In it, they demand the access so far denied
DeFazio -- or a written explanation as to why access has been refused
-- by Thursday. This is the day before Congress -- and Congressman
DeFazio -- recess and return to their home districts to answer
emphatic questions.

Portland has more than a prayer if it and the rest of Oregon keep up
the pressure on their local, state and national leaders. At this stage
of the Bush regime and its terror-driven global war, there's no shame
in conspiracy theory, since it's the only theory that offers
consistent, coherent answers to our growing secret government and its
terror policies.

Noble Resolve Press Release:

http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2007/pa053107.html
SUFFOLK, Va. - May 31, 2007) -- The initial experiment of U.S. Joint
Forces Command's (USJFCOM) Noble Resolve campaign designed to look at
ways of enhancing homeland defense and support in the event of a
natural or man-made disaster proved to yield promising results.

Designed with U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) as part of that
command's efforts to improve homeland security, this first experiment,
Noble Resolve 07-1, brought in more than 125 people from across the
United States and other countries to develop solutions for U.S.
agencies and organizations by providing the means to deter prevent,
and defeat threats and aggression aimed at the U.S., its territories,
and interests.

Navy Capt. John Kersh, Jr., who heads the Joint Innovation and
Experimentation Directorate's (J9) Joint Context and Homeland Defense
Department, said Noble Resolve gave participants an opportunity to
experiment with things and people they normally wouldn't have a chance
to work with.

&quot;As we get together with different organizations, if they can identify
things that they're interested in working on, we'll put together the
vignettes and scenarios that allow them to get at the research
objectives and work with folks that a lot of times they might not have
the chance to work with,&quot; he said.

Participants teamed up throughout the experiment to use a number of
modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools to get a read on what would happen
in two scenarios.

The first involved a hurricane, similar to Hurricane Katrina, coming
from western Africa hitting the Hampton Roads. The second dealt with a
terrorist attack coming from a ship that sailed from the western
African region.

The Virginia Fusion Center, located in Richmond, worked in conjunction
with Noble Resolve on the terrorist scenario. The center ran its own
annual exercise called the Virginia Emergency Response Team Exercise
at the same time. Noble Resolve personnel communicated with Virginia
officials and then shared information regarding a potential attack.

David Ozolek, executive director of the Joint Futures Laboratory in
Suffolk, Va., which held the experiment, said the sharing of
information amongst organizations proved to be critical throughout
both scenarios.

&quot;I think what we got was a reasonable assessment of our information
flow and knowledge building in support of decision making capabilities
as it stands today,&quot; he said. &quot;The next step now is to map out where
we need to make improvements.&quot;

Ozolek also said one area where he saw breakthrough production was in
the technical area of M&amp;S support for planning, mission rehearsal,
training and experimentation.

&quot;We did very effective demonstrations of some really powerful tools
that have emerged within the last two years that have great potential
to help us plan and respond to those types of situations,&quot; said
Ozolek.

He said Noble Resolve officials will meet with commonwealth of
Virginia officials including Governor Tim Kaine and mayors of the
cities in Hampton Roads over the next few weeks to discuss the
observations of the experiment in terms of information flow and
decision making.

Ozolek gave praise to the commonwealth saying they've agreed to help
out even more.
&quot;What we actually learned working with Virginia is they've graciously
agreed to work with us as we work with Oregon in August for Noble
Resolve 07-2,&quot; he said.

Kersh said the overall lessons learned from Noble Resolve 07-1 will be
brought to Noble Resolve 07-2. That experiment will consist of two
more scenarios, the first involving an earthquake to the Portland area
and the second dealing with a series of vignettes dealing with the
Global War on Terror.

By the time the Noble Resolve 07 campaign comes to a close in August,
USJFCOM and NORTHCOM will have partnered with the U.S. Transportation
Command, and other federal agencies such as the Dept. of Homeland
Security, the FBI and Customs and Border Protection.

It also will have teamed with individual states such as the
commonwealth of Virginia and state of Oregon, as well as multinational
participants to include Canada, Germany, Singapore, Finland and
Sweden, amongst others.

Noble Resolve 07: Four days of &quot;simulated&quot; nuclear terrorist scenarios
in the US &amp; Europe
by DL Abrahamson
Global Research, April 20, 2007
http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code;=ABR20...

It is important to note the &quot;Nobel Resolve&quot; drills are dominated by
NORTHCOM, the branch of &quot;homeland defense&quot; based in Colorado and
responsible for shutting down the United States under martial law, as
well as ushering in the merger of the US, Canada, and Mexico via the
SPP.

We must remember that CIA agent Philip Giraldi warned the American
Conservative magazine that STRATCOM would launch a nuclear attack on
Iran in the wake of a new WMD-style attack on American soil.

And the Russian media and former Russian military members continue to
warn that an American and Israeli strike on Iran is imminent.

While many drills are run every month, Nobel Resolve 07, with it's
&quot;realistic&quot; scenarios, comes at a time of increased geopolitical
tension. It is reminiscent of the drills in 2005, where a ten-kiloton
nuclear weapon was &quot;simulated&quot; to explode in South Carolina. Some
speculated that four-star Gen. Kevin Byrnes, of the Fort Meade TRADOC
command, was fired due to his exposure of the drill.

We should not live in a constant state of panic and fear, or make any
irresponsible predictions about Noble Resolve 07. But in the coming
days, we can email this information to blogs, media outlets, friends
and family. Congressmen, and others to help inoculate against any
possibility that rogue &quot;red teams&quot; inside the drills may be
activated.
Today is the deadline for DeFazio's response...call the #'s below and
pressure!!      27.Jul.2007 07:49
