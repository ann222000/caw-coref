Gargraves is the name or is that a spelling error?

&gt; I'd like to get some Gragraves Phantom track with wooden ties to play

&gt; I mean setting it up ad-hoc on the carpeting since I'm not prepared for a
&gt; permanent layout let.

&gt; So I'll start with just a big oval with a siding to park: 72&quot; curves, 37&quot;
&gt; straights, with a switch off the end of one curve to the siding ending at a
&gt; bumper. (In the future I'd like to put an elevated figure 8 within this.)

&gt; But I'm confused about hooking up the Gragraves terminal section. It's 6.5&quot;
&gt; long. The shortest piece of straight track is 6.2&quot;. It sounds like I'll be
&gt; .3&quot; off somewhere

&gt; What do you do, besides cutting a section of straight track to fit? Add an
&gt; uncoupler or operation section that are also 6.5&quot; to the opposite side?

&gt; I've also heard that it is best to ground both outer rails. I have a Lionel
&gt; CW-80 transformer with the FasTrack terminal section that has a plug-in. Is
&gt; there an adaptor to plug into to split the ground wire for the purpose of
&gt; grounding both outer rails? Or should I just dump the Lionel wire harness
&gt; and get one red, and two black wires with the copper &quot;U&quot; connectors on both
&gt; ends? I'll probably get a Lionel ZW transformer sooner than later anyway,
&gt; so I don't suppose some extra wire will break the bank...

&gt; I'm not an electrician (other then my skills at plugging things in...). I
&gt; was under the impression that you need a full circuit of track to have it
&gt; powered. So how does a siding along side of an oval function? It's just a
&gt; straight track ending at a bumper. So where is the full circuit?

&gt; I know, I need to a book... I have a bunch in my wish list at Amazon, but I
&gt; don't know which one to start with. Any suggestions? Here are two that I
&gt; have picked out (the rest deal with track plans.)

&gt; Getting Started With Lionel Trains: Your Introduction to Model Railroading
&gt; Fun - by Allan W. Miller

&gt; The Big Book of Lionel: The Complete Guide to Owning and Running America's
&gt; Favorite Toy Trains - by Robert Schleicher

&gt; I've passed on The Lionel FasTrack Book, by Robert Schleicher, because
&gt; FasTrack seems a little loud (according to my wife who hears it in her
&gt; sleep), which is why I am looking at Gargraves track.

The small difference in the length of the Gargraves sections shouldn't
be a problem but I'd add a second terminal section to assist in the
current flow so your train doesn't lose power. I always used two
terminals on my Lionel layouts. I like Gargraves track. I'm sure you'll
be pleased with it.

Can't have too many books! The two you picked are good ones to help you
get started. They will surely guide you as your railroad progresses!
Here are a couple more:

"Wiring Your Toy Train Layout" by Peter Riddell:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0897784774/qid%3D1073534896/sr...

"Build a Better Toy Train layout":

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0897784790/qid%3D1100317961/sr...

These books are up to 31% off list and usually include free shipping
and handling on orders over $25.

Gargraves is the name. As I recall, it was originally Gar-Graves. The
name was derived from the names of the founders, I believe. Gargraves
track has been around for about 50 years.

Some people will agree - others not.  Keeping one outer rail 'free'
makes it easier to use for track triggered devices, if you are likely to
use them.  You do not need to ground both rails - just remember which
outer rail is grounded :-)

The full circuit is the electricity going from the centre rail through
the loco and back via the outer rail - you do not need a circle/oval of
track to complete a circuit.

Both are good books - I would echo Bill's suggestion of the Peter Riddle
book.

No it's not.  Just a little capitalization issue.

Gardner &amp; Graves.  Neighbors on Dewey Avenue in Rochester.

Gardner, &amp; subsequently his widow, ran a Lionel / Rivarossi train shop
in the basement of their home, it's still in business in a storefront at
the GarGraves factory compound in upstate NY.  The whole operation is
now owned by a fellow who worked for Gardner &amp; Graves as a neighborhood
youngster, he bought the track business first, &amp; the shop, "Gardner, The
Train Doctor"  some years later.
