Hi, gang -

Scrounged a countetop from a Restaurant remodel &amp; turned it into a
cabinet for my benchtop Table Saw.

The countertop is laminate over particle, about 2&quot; thick - the rest of
the carcase is built out of 3/4&quot; ply, biscuited &amp; screwed, with a 2x4
framework for the base.

The drawers are also biscuited &amp; screwed 3/4&quot; ply, with
laminate/particle faces.  Face frame on both sides of the cabinet is
Red Oak, and I hung peg board panels on both ends.

Given the construction, I can confirm that it is one HEAVY beast.

Thanks for looking

There you go with your format again - they are jpg's, dagnabbit - what
the hell kind of photo file are you looking for?

Obviously, you're too dense to realize that they're yEnc encoded. Without
debating the merits of using yEnc or not, there are a number of people here
that use software that can't decode it. If someone is posting images for
other to see, it makes sense to post those images in the most popular format
available because you want people to see them. That's not yEnc. It's not as
if ABPW is so inundated with files that conserving a limited amount of
bandwidth or space is a necessary thing.

First and third came over mangled, middle one looked good, but a website

If you want us to look at your pictures post them as .jpg without Yenc and
we can all look at them. Most people don't have the ability to use Yenc
files (including me).

They didn't appear to be Yenc encoded to me.  It just looked like Kevin
has his news reader set to send large files as multi-part messages.

Oh look - somebody who finally figured it out - and wasn't nastily
RUDE about it.

1) They ARE jpg's
2) They are NOT posted in Yenc.
3) They are NOT 5 megabyte files - they are right around 1meg - but
there are 3 photos in each post.
4) The dratted thing WAS set to post in multi-part - oops.
5) and to the responder who summarily ORDERED me to re-post in under
100kb size - NO.  I despise tiny little postage stamp pics.  Can't see
anything in 'em.  I don't have a 20&quot; monotior and an 8 Megapixel DSLR
to look at thumbnails.  If you have a dila-up account &amp; don't like
large files - learn to kill-filter by size.  Otherwise, I'm going to
move to your neighborhood &amp; buy a Model T &amp; then DEMAND that y'all
absolutely HAVE to drive 20 mph at all times, because that's all that
I can manage.

To all you whiney rude jackasses that want to do nothing but bitch -
you have been &amp; will continue to be ignored.

Anyone who wishes to be polite &amp; human &amp; reasonable will find it easy
to get me to post a link to my Flickr page where all 11 of these
photos reside - along with some 2300 others, most un-related to
woodworking.

Kevin,

It doesn't require a rant and I didn't say anything to you that should
require that kind of reply. If you want us to look at your pictures, then
post them so it's easy for us to do so. It's that simple.

As far as I am concerned, your reply just guaranteed that I WON'T even try
to look at your pictures no matter how you post them because you have now
been blocked from my computer. I have no interest in corresponding with
people like you or even seeing any of your future posts.

Are you this much of an asshole when you aren't hiding behind a keyboard?
Don't bother answering, I can guess the answer.

I agree.  You posted to a binary group so band width is not an issue.
Anyone participating in a binary group should have the bandwidth needed
or should have to suffer the consequences rather than have everyone else
drop down to their level.  That's why we have binary groups instead of
all groups being binary.

I'd like to see them and I'm sure plenty of non-whiners would also like
to see them.  Either re-post them or post your Flickr info.

It's not easy for most people to complain in writing w/o sounding
bitchy.  For example, your complaint about the rudeness sounds just as
whiney and bitchy as the people complaining.  You should expect some
grumbles when you post multi-part pictures that most people see as code
instead of pictures.
