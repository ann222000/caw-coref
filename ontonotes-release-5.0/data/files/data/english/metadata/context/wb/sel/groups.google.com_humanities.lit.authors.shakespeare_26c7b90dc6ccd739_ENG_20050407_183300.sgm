Mr. W. H. - Stratfordian Shithouse M.C.

On the thread 'Skeptic Magazine Article', Phil advised as follows:

The Hermetic system utilises a vesica [pisces] as the base cosmological
map. When the central axis of the vesica is 666 [solar] then the long
vertical axis is 1080 [lunar]. These numbers combined, 1746, provide
the number of fusion.

Thanks, Phil.

In the context of Saga-Shakespeare Number Symbolism, the &quot;fusion&quot;
aspect would be represented by 100 as in 666 + 1080 + 100 = 1846 as in
&quot;T. T.&quot;, 1846, which &quot;the well-wishing adventurer [...] set[s]
forth&quot; at the end of the Dedication of Shakespeares Sonnets.

I prepared the following sketch on the subject matter this afternoon.

The identity of &quot;Mr. W. H.&quot; of the Dedication of Shakespeares
Sonnets remains a puzzle - William Hall is a favorite candidate by
virtue of having been employed by publisher Thomas Thorpe and, as such,
may have been instrumental in 'begetting' the Sonnets for
publication.

So 'reason' literary sleuths on the supposition that &quot;T. T.&quot; at
Dedication's end stands for Thomas Thorpe's initials and NOT
something SET FORTH by &quot;The Well-Wishing Adventurer.&quot;

In 'Will in the World', Stephen Greenblatt comments that &quot;It is
not clear whether [the Sonnets' Dedication] reveal something crucial
about Shakespeare or merely about the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose
initials seem to lay claim to the dedication as his own. And if it
were somehow established that Shakespeare, rather than Thorpe, wrote
the dedication, it would still not be known whether &quot;W. H.,&quot; the
initials of the &quot;only begetter,&quot; slyly reverse those of Henry
Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, or refer to someone else -
perhaps to William Herbert, the Earl of Pembroke [...] to whom (along
with his brother Philip) the 1623 folio edition of Shakespeare's
works was dedicated.&quot; (p. 232)

An alternative hypothesis is that &quot;T. T.&quot;, Cipher Value 1846,
relate the Sonnets to the Vesica imagery as reflected in the Cipher Sum
666 + 1080 + 100 = 1846, where 100 denotes The End of 'strife' -
&quot;a kind of fighting in [his] heart&quot; which wouldn't let Prince
Hamlet &quot;sleep&quot; (Act V, Sc. ii) - 'full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing,&quot; which marks the 'hour upon the stage' of
&quot;Mr. W. H.&quot; - JHWH's Rear End - alias A Poore Stratfordian
Idiot Player.

In the context, Stratford, 5627, would be Poore Player's birthplace
because the Cipher Value of its name is mirrored in 1000 + 2315 + 2312
= 5627, where 1000 = Light of the World or Spirit at the level of
Microcosmic MAN-Beast of Seventh Day - a concept which the ancients
equated to Creation in Time and Space alias The World/The Globe, with
2315 and 2312 being the Cipher Values of Tími and Rúm, which is
Icelandic for Time and Space.

In the context, also, Light of the World, 1000, would be 'The
Well-Wishing Adventurer', 15361, alias 'Our Ever-living Poet',
10347, manifested in Time and Space on 'reuels east and west'
(Prince Hamlet in Act I, Sc. v) - the Solar Axis - which conclude
with Light's metamorphosis - &quot;fusion&quot; with the Lunar Axis -
into World-Ending or Globe-Burning Flaming Sword, 4000 as in 1000 +
15361 + 10347 + 4000 = 30708.

At that, Idiot Hour ends - and Tom Reedy's Shithouse is, mercifully,
reduced to ashes.

In this respect, the Cipher Value 30708 DOES appear to &quot;reveal
something crucial about Shakespeare&quot;, for its mirror image 10230 +
11156 + 9322 = 30708, links William Shakespeare, 9322, to the Marlovian
'heresy' implicit in Thomas Thorpe's characterization of the late
'Christopher Marlow', 11156, as 'Pure Elementall Wit', 10230,
in his preface to Marlowe's translation of 'Lucans First Booke'
published in 1600.

What about &quot;Mr W. H.&quot;?

At Idiot Hour's end, 'he/she' - archetypes are BOTH male and
female - is 'fused' with the 'better half' such that the Holy
Name of JHWH (10-5-6-5 in Hebrew gematria) 'rises again'.

In Hebrew creation myth, where JHWH's Name is held to split into two
parts - Male/Female and Female/Male - at Seventh Day's dawn, THAT
is &quot;the purpose of our world&quot; and Man of Seventh Day's mission.
In Shakespeare's play, THAT is Prince Hamlet's 'revenge'.

The Myth's Alpha and Omega are summarized in the Dedication of
Shakespeares Sonnets, whose Cipher Value of 85535 is mirrored in the
Cipher Sum 1846 + 7 + 9322 + 10565 + 63795 = 85535, where

1846 = T. T.;

7 = MAN-Beast of Seventh Day;

9322 = William Shakespeare;

10565 = JHWH's Holy Name Risen Again; and

63795 = The Workes of William Shakespeare, Containing all his Comedies,
Histories, and Tragedies: Truely set forth, according to their first
Originall.

All this imagery concerns Cosmic Creative Power's manifestation as
spatio-temporal Microcosmic MAN-Beast and MAN-Beast's EVOLUTION
through historical time - a concept whose roots extend back into
pre-historic time and, when 'discovered' by Charles Darwin, was
imagined NOT to apply to MAN-Beast alias Homo Stratfordianus itself.

Such is the modesty of the species!

Hence Jonathan Swift's parting shot on Author's behalf in
'Gulliver's Travels':

&quot;My reconcilement to the Yahoo kind in general might not be so My
reconcilement to the Yahoo kind in general might not be so difficult,
if they would be content with those vices and follies only which nature
has entitled them to. I am not in the least provoked at the sight of a
lawyer, a pickpocket, a colonel, a fool, a lord, a gamester, a
politician, a whore-monger, a physician, an evidencer, a suborner, an
attorney, a traitor, or the like; this is all according to the due
course of things; but when I behold a lump of deformity and diseases,
both in body and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately breaks all
the measures of my patience; neither shall I be ever able to
comprehend how such an animal, and such a vice, could tally together.
The wise and virtuous Houyhnhnms, who abound in all excellencies that
can adorn a rational creature, have no name for this vice in their
language; which has no terms to express anything that is evil, except
those whereby they describe the detestable qualities of their Yahoos:
among which they were not able to distinguish this of pride, for want
of thoroughly understanding human nature, as it shews itself in other
countries, where that animal presides. But I, who had more experience,
could plainly observe some rudiments of it among the wild Yahoos. But
the Houyhnhnms, who live under the government of reason, are no more
proud of the good qualities they possess, than I should be for not
wanting a leg or an arm; which no man in his wits would boast of,
although he must be miserable without them. I dwell the longer upon
this subject, from the desire I have to make the society of an English
Yahoo by any means not insupportable; and therefore I here entreat
those, who have any tincture of this absurd vice, that they will not
presume to come in my sight.&quot;

If Ben Jonson were brought back to life to spill the beans on the
'real' William Shakespeare, the outcome for Stratfordian
Fundmentalists would be glorious vindication for having perceived the
truth all along OR abject humiliation for having been 'horribly
trick'd' into making real asses of themselves.

If Truth be the daughter of treacherous Time, then Truth will come to
light.

As it happens, Ben Jonson's Epigramme #LXXVII concerns the question
of identity of &quot;one that desired [him] not to name [the unidentified
one].&quot; The text and associated Cipher Values are as follows:

To One That Desired Me Not To Name Him. = 15643

Be safe, nor feare thy selfe so good a fame, = 14003
That, any way, my booke should speake thy name ; = 18141
For, if thou shame, ranck'd with my friends, to goe, = 20919
I'm more asham'd to haue thee thought my foe. = 17039 = 85745

Who might this ONE be?

In Augustan-Saga-Shakespeare Myth, 'he' is Monad, 1, manifested in
mythical Hebrew Man of Seventh Day, 7, as in 1 + 7 + 85745 = 85753.

Who's there?

On the frontispiece of the 1616 First Folio of Ben Jonson's works,
the following text reads AS IF it might allude to the frustration of
truth-seekers who lack the means of getting at the truth:

O could there be an art found out that might = 18932
Produce his shape soe lively as to Write. AB: Holl: = 21867 = 40799

I don't know what Stratfordian Fundamentalists make of Ben Jonson's
Epigramme #LXXVII - or if it has ever provoked them to unaccustomed
reflection.

But a possible ANSWER - albeit a 'horribly tricky' one - is indicated
by the Cipher Sum 40799 + 5385 + 39569 = 85753,

Where

5385 = Francis Bacon; and

39569 = IUDICIO PYLIUM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM
TERRA TEGIT, POPULUS MÆRET, OLYMPUS HABET

Ben Jonson, of course, was Francis Bacon's intimate friend and literary
collaborator.

Michel is a dodger. Like Price, he refuses to say who his candidate
for True Author is; but he's nowhere near as devious as she, for he
makes it pretty plain that he's a groupist, just making sure not to say
anything that will nail him when even he has to admit he's wrong. He
doesn't seem to think much of the cipher people--but did write a whole
book on the factuality of Atlantis and leys, which are magic
geographical lines that give people great powers at their crossings--or
something like that. (One thing they did for the ancients was allow
them to fly along them on magic carpets.) I can't follow this kind of
thing very well. But math gets into ley-analysis in a loony way simlar
to the way it does in Gangleri's investigations.

Bob,

There are two ways of getting to the bottom of the Shakespeare Mystery
- the one favored by Stratfordian Fundamentalists is the mirror image
of the Aristotelian orthodoxy favored by Galileo's Pisan peers who
REFUSED to look through his telescope because they had it on good
AUTHORITY that what the telescope revealed about the heavens just COULD
NOT be the case.

The other way is to LOOK through the telescope and SEE whatever it may
reveal.

The MATH thing has a pretty distinguished background - before the
Aristotelians came along, the SAGES - Hebrew, Greek, Roman etc. - who
left us Western Civilization were persuaded that the mathematical
precision of the physical realm discovered by Galileo was ALSO an
attribute of the intellectual attributes of Creation in Time and Space
which, in their vocabulary, was known as Microcosmic MAN-Beast.

In either case, it is NOT self-evident how the world is put together.

Hence the attachment to AUTHORITY challenged by Galileo - let's not
repeat the same spiel in the field of Shakespeare Studies.

Instead, let the chips fall where they may.

I don't know about magic carpets either. But the ley-system in Britain is
certainly susceptible to several kinds of analysis, one of which is
mathematical, or more specifically, statistical liklihood of certain
geometric alignments. I believe Professor Thom and others have undertaken
such a study (after Alfred Watkins.)

The other means of ley, and earth-energy fields, is to dowse them as a field
study.

Interpretations on the /facts/ of earth energies no doubt vary as widely as
interpretations of Shakespeare, and to confound your own argument Bob,
should you not like an Oxfordian point of view, does this mean that the
Works of the Author do not even exist !@ :)

Fair enough - but &quot;the evidence or [our] senses&quot; doesn't help us
resolve questions such as the one posed by Robert Greene's
&quot;upstart-crow&quot; passage.

If, that is, the passage in question was in fact penned by Greene and
not by Chettle, as some suspect - and, if not by Greene, what was the
point of ascribing it to him?

Be that as it may, we would still like to KNOW - rather than guess -
that the Stratfordian was in fact the one with &quot;tygers hart wrapt in a
players hyde.&quot; And what meaning are we to attach to his description
as &quot;Johannes fac totum&quot; or 'Jack of all trades'?

The cipher values of the two descriptions are 16160 and 8600, as in
1000 + 6468 + 4692 + 4000 = 16160, and 4600 + 4000 = 8600,
respectively.

In the context of Shakespeare Myth, the 'Jack of all trades' concerns
the twin attributes (polar opposites) of Archetypal or Marlovian
MAN-Beast of Seventh Day which were reflected in the Privy Council's
1587 letter to the administration of Cambridge University on behalf of
Christopher Marlowe, on the one hand, and Thomas Beard's 1593
good-riddance comments on Marlowe, on the other hand.

For Archetypal Stratfordian's beastly attribute is known as
Scialetheia, 4600, or 'A Shadow of Truth', the metamorphosis of whose
'dagger' into Flaming Sword, 4000 as in 4600 + 4000 = 8600, 'slays'
MAN-Beast at myth's end.

In the final scene of Julius Cæsar, Brutus runs on his own sword
(4000) thereby 'overcoming himself' (his Scialetheia or 4600 aspect).
In the 'official' inquest into the 'murder' of Christopher Marlowe,
this mythical imagery is dressed up as something which actually
happened in historical time.

The varied accounts of Marlowe's 'murder' - was he slain in Deptford or
London? - signal that SOMETHING may have been going on which cannot be
caught by (selective) literal reading of the record. &quot;Selective&quot; not
only because of the Deptford/London mixup, but also because of the
general disregard by scholars of John Aubrey's account that BEN JONSON
&quot;killed Mr Marlow, the poet&quot;.

All this as prelude to my comments on the first Cipher Value - that of
&quot;tygers hart wrapt in a players hyde&quot;. For Aubrey's tale is a
veritable RED FLAG waived for the benefit of future students of the
record - a flag, which underscores Clown Touchstone's remarks:

When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded
with the forward child Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made
thee poetical.

Other parts of the 'record' underscore the long-running 'rivalry'
between Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare - in the imagery of
Shakespeare Myth, the 'rivalry' is resolved at The End, when Light of
the World, 1000, emerges from the 'shadow' known as &quot;Earle of Oxford&quot;,
6468, in the heart of Ben Jonson, 4692, and, become Flaming Sword,
4000, &quot;kills Mr Marlow, the Poet&quot; - that is, Ben Jonson's shadow or
devil aspect.

And THAT concludes the Myth of &quot;tygers hart wrapt in a players hyde&quot;,
16160, as in 1000 + 6468 + 4692 + 4000 = 16160.

I think of mathematics as logical systems of notation that attempt to
describe reality, but really only measure with relative success.
Mathematicians can string together systems that don't relate to
reality at all and have no practical use. Nature has no straight
lines or arcs to measure, time or distance isn't constant, and there
is no known center or edge of the universe.

Physics can't integrate field theories like particles and waves.
Astronomy uses poetic expressions and lies about being able to see
farther into the future and greater distances with bigger telescopes,
when all it does is enlarge photographs and interpret color shifts.
At the other end of the telescope, physics continues to find different
particles and tries to imagine how they behave. Modern medicine
attempts to imitate/back-engineer nature, but it has never found a
cure for a disease.

All the scientific discoveries and proofs are changed continually.
The current popular version of evolution, Darwinism, does not
adequately explain development of new organs, species, etc., with its
mechanisms. The so-called scientific method is probably inaccurate,
given that discoveries seem to occur by accident, as in a dream of a
double helix, benzene rings, or the formula for aspirin. The
biography of Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner in physics, *Genius*,
reveals that Feynman had a measurable IQ of 129 and, though a math
whiz and problem solver at Oppenheimer's WW II camp, would find
solutions by leaping to conclusions. He did not have kind things to
say about methodical physicists, as I remember. Go figure.

Given all the inconsistencies in science and methods, gangleri's
system may be as logical and scientific as any. Have to be able to
demonstrate proof in pragmatic way, though, IMO. Too many ducks are
saying, If it walks like a duck . . . .

Gangleri,

I'm far from understanding what you're saying, but aren't you begging
the question by claiming there is a Shakespeare myth, then using
archetypes from it? In other words, I think you're trying to show
there's a Shakespeare myth by assuming one exists.

BTW, I'm a little sorry the outhouse is gone. Guess we'll have to use
the woods now.

Re. the following:

In other words, I think you're trying to show
there's a Shakespeare myth by assuming one exists.

Comment:

That is the modus operandi of empirical science - one advances
hypotheses and subjects them to empirical testing.

Stratfordian orthodoxy is predicated on the UNSPOKEN hypothesis that
what SEEMS to be the case is IN FACT the case - except when what SEEMS
to be the case cannot be squared with the orthodox consensus, as in the
case of Marlowe being killed in two places and by Frizer &amp; Co as well
as by Ben Jonson.

As for the overtly mythical aspects of Marlowe's 'murder' - the name of
'widow' Eleanor BULL and the (apparently) Marlovian motto QVOD ME
NUTRIT ME DESTRUIT, which is a variation on another motto whose
emblemic representation is a TORCH turned downward, are evocative of
the BULL-slaying core of Mithraic Myth and its association with a TORCH
turned downward to symbolize the Sun's waning power after Autumnal
Equinox - they fairly shout that what SEEMS may NOT in fact be the
case.

Considering also that the Cipher Value, 14144, of the Marlovian motto -
which means 'That which nourishes me also destroys me' - is mirrored in
the Stratfordian's 'destruction' as 'documented' in a purported COPY of
Holy Trinity Church 'records', which show that 'Will Shakspere gent',
10026, was 'buried' on April 25, 1616 as in 10026 + 2502 + 1616 =
14144, the HYPOTHESIS that Myth is involved AND that Number Symbolism
is an essential part thereof cannot be rejected out of hand.

I agree with the thrust of your argument - and, as it happens, I have
started a number of threads on the epistemological aspects of modern
physical science on the NKS Forum section at  .

As for the subject at hand, let me serve up two more &quot;ducks&quot; for
consideration.

The first concerns a suggestion which Stratfordian Fundamentalists
reject out of hand, namely, that there were/are still-to-be-discovered
links between the creation of the Shakespeare Opus/Myth and Cervantes'
masterpiece, Don Quixote - the 'fact' that Cervantes died on or around
the same day as Will Shakspere is viewed as mere accident and not an
indication of some literary hanky-panky.

My conclusion in this respect may be summarized in two Cipher Sums.

(i) 35662 + 10805 = 46467, and

(ii) 1000 + 3637 + 19129 + 22601 + 100 = 46467, where

35662 = The Stratfordian OF RECORD's 'hour upon the stage', and

10805 = Sweet Swan of Avon

1000 = Light of the World,

3637 = Mr. W. H.,

19129 = Forse altro cantera con miglior plettro,

22601 = Perhaps another will sing with a better voice, and

100 = The End.

The two sentences are appended without explanation at The End of Vol I.
of Don Quixote.

The second concerns my contention that the Stratfordian OF RECORD was a
fictional character representing Microcosmic MAN-Beast which ancient
myth equated to The World/Microcosm made in the image of the Macrocosm.

Again, my conclusion may be summarized through two Cipher Sums.

(i) 45319 = Macrocosm symbolized by the Twelve Houses of the Zodiac -
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces,
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer.

(ii) 1 + 5979 - 1000 + 35662 + 4000 + 677 = 45319, where

1 = Monad/God,

5979 = Girth House - a medieval circular (mirroring the Zodiac above)
stone church in the Orkneys built on the model of the Holy Sepulchre in
Jerusalem, mythical burial place of Jesus; symbol for Microcosmic
MAN-Beast as 'murderer' of Father's Spirit within,

- 1000 = Darkness,

35662 = The Stratfordian OF RECORD's 'hour upon the stage',

4000 = Flaming Sword, and

677 = EK - Icelandic for &quot;I&quot;, which the Kabbalah holds to be the final
stage of God's manifestation at the level of Microcosmic Man.

These are two mighty &quot;ducks&quot; - either as presumptive proofs of the
hypotheses under consideration OR hugely off-scale insofar as the
probability calculus is concerned.

Addendum.

After posting the preceding message, I had occasion to post the
following comment on another Forum:

I submit that Mind is, for the want of a better term, a UNITARY
continuum such that there exists NO genuine dividing line between
Mind's conscious and sub-conscious attributes.

Rather, ALL of us come into the world at one end of the continuum and,
at once, begin to move towards the other end.

MOST of us pass on before reaching the other end - a FEW do reach it.

We call them Prophets, Sages, etc.

If I understand it correctly, THAT is what the ancient Greeks termed
our &quot;race through life&quot; - a &quot;race&quot; undertaken by the Human Spirit to
free itself from the fetters of Time and Space.

In the final act of Shakespeare's play, 'The Tempest', when Miranda
exults over a Brave New World, her father Prospero responds: &quot;'Tis new
to thee.&quot;

As in: What else is new?

The continuum of Mind and Sex are alike in that, while at its immature
end, we cannot possibly envisage what lies at the other end.

No, no, no - don't go there. I hope I'm just reading you wrong, but you
seem to be trading one mildly looney idea (anti-Stratfordianism) for a
totally wacko concept (anti-Darwinism).

Modern evolutionary theory has *no* problems explaining the development of
new organs or species. As is true with all the sciences, there are plenty
of arguments on the fringes, and even on a couple of relatively central
issues as well. There are also many &quot;organs and species&quot; for which we don't
have a detailed process of development laid out - but there's no conceptual
problem. I know this isn't the place for this discussion, so I commend to
you the *libraries* full of detailed explanations.

&gt; biography of Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner in physics, *Genius*,
&gt; reveals that Feynman had a measurable IQ of 129 and, though a math
&gt; whiz and problem solver at Oppenheimer's WW II camp, would find
&gt; solutions by leaping to conclusions. He did not have kind things to
&gt; say about methodical physicists, as I remember. Go figure.

&gt; Given all the inconsistencies in science and methods, gangleri's

Typically, science tries to make adjustments in theories to account
for failures and new developments. With Darwinism, I think of the
problem about not allowing for adaptive change in one generation of
species. No provision for adaptive characters or anything going on at
cellular levels with chromosomes, etc.. Has no provision for
adaptations occurring based on individual experience. Then species
change by periodicity, when major developments take place suddenly.
Darwinism doesn't account for periodicity, I think.

What I'm doing, I think, is referring to a healthy skepticism
necessary to maintain perspective and keep science with a small &quot;S&quot;.

Well, in fairness to bookburn, these are all (rare) topics of discussion in
biology.

In fairness to me, I don't see how any of them bear on &quot;the development of
organs and species&quot;, but let's let it go.

What bugs me is that science continually resorts to poetic expressions
in describing the universe, but doesn't account for transmission of
experience by an individual to offspring.

Just think what it would mean to playwrights if we could believe
trauma experienced by a protagonist influences BEFORE regeneration.
History is full of examples of peoples who experience sudden traumas
that continue with them like a dent in their psyche. Literature is
full of examples of inherited proclivities and cycles of revisiting
the same archetypes. In Dr. Zhivago the suspected daughter carries
around a ballalika like her wandering mother. Melville and Faulkner
show us the personal effects of ancestors actions. In expressive-type
criticism and romanticism, all the stuff about individual personality
and spirit is paramount, and Shakespeare is a premier romanticist.

I think we should go back to the &quot;Two Cultures&quot; duel with academics
about tunnel vision and not communicating in the science and arts. I
suspect that people like Bloom and Bellow of the older generation who
deplore modern literary tendencies are basically reacting against
so-called scientific objectivity, wanting to return to romanticism and
the dignity of the individual.

Down the road, I expect science will declare something like specific
genes are modified by what goes on in chromosomes, so experience
weighs in as inherited. bb

But as you point out ... playwrights don't really need this encouragement,
do they? Unfortunately what you're looking for isn't very likely. Modern
biology is, almost by definition, the study of populations, primarily of
species; and dramatic literature is about the actions of individuals. There
are outliers in both groups - I've seen some writings by biologists who are
working on the direct transmission of &quot;experience&quot; and there are
experimental or short-lived movements of playwrights who are examining group
dynamics - but you're not going to see a major movement in either direction.

Anyway, one way biologists acknowledge the transmission of experience is via
culture, and many are exploring the genetic basis of culture.

Well of course, Bob. Complete dismissal of the Will-o-Strat critic proves
nothing about the facts surrounding the Work's existence, and certainly does
not 'prove' the opposite, even if established, case. Its too bad that there
is such complete and absolutely divisive established polity surrounding the
work. A few days ago I wrote this extract on a strange topic ...

This citation comes from the Hungarian psychologist and neurologist Dr.
Ervin Nagy:-

&quot;That's what I am talking about! In a fierce debate, everybody gets
closer to an extremist point of view! The utterances of the debate follow
from each other, but they are far from reflecting the original intention.
The ultimate goal will be to win the debate, not to convince the opponent.
In politics it can lead to, say, the bombing of civilian targets, like in
Vietnam. It is the 'He hit me first' syndrome.&quot;

Interestingly, this comment is written in a chess book! Psychology of chess
is a very rare animal to encounter, and, since chess is also a battle. The
speaker continues:-

&quot;Escalatory behavior is a kind of self-justification. In our case it
appears in the following way: the intention behind our moves is still there,
but it gets carried away from our original ideas, as well as from the inner
nature of the position.&quot;

But I have to go an crack open a new book - I've been looking forward to
reading Snow White and Russian Red, by an interesting Pole, Dorota
Maslowska. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung really liked it: &quot;Fast, heavily
abbreviated, full of color, bursting with idiosyncracy... Similarities are
immeditely apparent to the films Being John Malkovich and Trainspotting, but
also to Kafka, Gombrowicz and Gaddis.&quot;

Whereas the Buchreport says it is &quot;A melange of Salinger's Catcher in the
Rye, Burrough's Naked Lunch and Doblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz.&quot;

The author is just a kid, born 1983 and lives in Warsaw.

Don't you wish you could get away with that, and also with writing lit.
blurbs which feature idiosyncracies which burst.

Cordially, Phil

Phil, extremism doesn't only arise when two sides get emotional and/or
out to win at all costs. It also arises when all the facts are on one
side. The people who believe in facts HAVE to become extremists. The
other side, too, must become extremist--because to say the facts may
not count is an extremist position, if not quite the extremist position
that saying the facts do not count is. (An agnostic is just about as
much an extremist as a theist or an atheist---because he agrees with
the former that a reality not susceptible to sensory perception can
exist, an extremist position.)

series of publisher's blurbs you'd write for a Shakespeare title&quot;.

What the Hungarian gentleman seems to be pointing out is that extremism is
associated with rhetoric, or more precisely, with proselitysing.

The origin of the issue is not at all 'extreme' since it knows no scale -
only when it contacts the social environment and other, differring views,
does extremism arise if the parties wish to convince each other by varieties
of rhetorical means.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It also arises when all the facts are on one
&gt; side. The people who believe in facts HAVE to become extremists.

"/>

I understand that to present one's point of view above the clamour of other
views, or above sheer noise, forceful presentation is often necessary. But
it is difficult to talk about 'beliefs' in this manner since implicate in
any belief is a not-knowing. Perhaps faith is a better term? Faith is gained
by observing how all manner of thing work, a comprehension of their nature,
and this nature is extended to the subject under review.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The
&gt; other side, too, must become extremist--because to say the facts may
&gt; not count is an extremist position, if not quite the extremist position
&gt; that saying the facts do not count is.

"/>

From a methodological perspective, a 'fact' is a result of the method. And
to a certain degree less interesting than the method itself. What comes
under scrutiny is what method anyone has in producing their 'fact'. Without
method we have cold-fusion in a test-tube. I think most people own that if
they apply a method they determine a 'fact' by it - and such fact is 'their
truth'.

It may even be a profound truth - widely admitted and testable. But as the
scientist karl Popper noted, so often the oppositie of one profound truth is
not a lie, but another profound truth!

In arguments how common it is to attempt to undermine the other guy, as if
they were an enemy, as if their truth was a threat to ourselves.

I think its also true when encountering this paradox [and it is!] that it
cannot be resolved on the same level that it was formed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (An agnostic is just about as
&gt; much an extremist as a theist or an atheist---because he agrees with
&gt; the former that a reality not susceptible to sensory perception can
&gt; exist, an extremist position.)

Comment:

A few months before he died, Albert Einstein concluded a letter to his
friend Michel Besso on General Relativity by &quot;conced[ing] that it is
quite possible that physics cannot be founded on the concept of field -
that is to say, on continuous elements. But then,&quot; he continued, &quot;out
of my whole castle in the air - including the theory of gravitation,
but also most of current physics - there would remain almost NOTHING.&quot;

In other words, almost ALL the &quot;facts&quot; of theoretical physics are
CONTINGENT &quot;facts&quot; - drop ONE assumption, and the whole edifice is
reduced to smithereens!

Ditto for Stratfordian Orthodoxy - drop the ASSUMPTION that the COPY of
Holy Trinity Church 'records' containing the &quot;facts&quot; on baptisms and
burials in the Shakspere clan over half a century is GENUINE, and
almost NOTHING remains.

P.S. The following was addressed to issues in the field of theoretical
physics - but the like considerations apply in the field of Shakespeare
Studies.

That is to say, we don't KNOW what was going on 400 odd years ago in
England - hence, we can only SPECULATE - a point which is lost on Tom
Reedy and David Kathman, who presume to KNOW &quot;The Historical FACTS.&quot;

******

If one views the physically REAL as - in John Stuart Mill's phrase -
&quot;the permanent possibility of perception&quot;, then two things are clear up
front.

First. The physically REAL is something &quot;out there&quot; - a something, into
which we are born and perceive through our senses.

Second. We can let it be - or, if we have a &quot;scientific&quot; bent of mind,
we can speculate about the structure of that something.

That is what IDEALIZATION is about - it is a means of reducing the
unknowable to a structured something.

Idealization provides NO answers - it is a means whereby we come to
terms with the unknowable.

Yes - in either pillar of modern physics, relativity or quantum theory,
neither are resolvable at their own level. Pointedly Einstein did not
succeed with his unified field theory, and perhaps because he was unwilling
to engage quantum theory sufficiently to transcend both pillars?

Any Qabbalist could have told him the same, from a meta-methodolgical
perspective!

Nothing much outside of the texts themselves.

But I think this has to be an aside from what is indicated in this thread -
that a certain strong polarisation of opinion exists as result of
proselytizing rhetoric, supported by selected historical fact and inference.

--------

To either Stratfordians, or to any other Claimants, suggesting anything else
is detestable! I mean, if the subject changes to a collaboration then all
parties hate it, since collaborations cannot be polarised expressions of
one's own candidate.

Efforts by serious scholars to suggest collaboration are ignored in this
ng - since it is inconvenient to any singular author theorem.

I would be interested for example to learn why, from any usual method
discussed here, factual objections exist to the Poet William Shakespeare
writing the plays, while also being advised to their structure and content
by other parties.

I have just proposed a completely heretical amalgam, whose refutation by any
party from a factual basis is unlikely to be attempted.

But the force of my suggestion lies in a resolution of very many claims to
authorship. Since anyone proposing their candidate alone as the Author will
resent this intrusive device into their [usually only] rhetorical encounters
with each other, I might assume that the subject will be roundly ignored.

And while it may be ignored it yet stands equal, or rather better, to other
claims of authorship, as result of the distortions introduced by the
phenomenological rhetorical process leading to fanaticism (and
indistinguishable from aboriginal worship of a cargo cult), and as described
in the preceding post.

Comment:

I have not seen your &quot;amalgam&quot; - so let me sketch salient aspects of my
own composite and see how the two stack up against each other.

1. The Workes of Shakespeare are the product of many minds and hands.

2. As such, they are an outgrowth of John Dee's circle, with Francis
Bacon as de facto successor to Dee as leader of the circle's
collaboration on the Shakespeare Agenda.

3. Edward Oxenford - alias archetypal MAN-Beast &quot;Robert Greene&quot; - was
the key author of the &quot;early&quot; Shakespeare Plays, with Francis Bacon -
archetypal MAN - and Ben Jonson - archetypal Beast - being primarily
responsible for the &quot;late&quot; Shakespeare Plays, including changes in and
refinement of Oxenford's &quot;early&quot; works.

4. Christopher Marlowe - alias &quot;Pure Elementall Wit&quot; by Thomas
Thorpe's account - of whom we know next to nothing for certain, was
playcast as the MYTHICAL representation of Ghost of Hamlet's Father
who, as noted by Hamlet, &quot;may be the devil&quot; etc. Alias Spirit &quot;Doom'd
for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast
in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and
purg'd away.&quot;

5. Will Shakspere - alias &quot;Christopher Marlow&quot; of Thomas Thorpe's
account - of whom we know next to nothing for certain, was playcast as
the HISTORICAL embodiment of MYTHICAL Spirit.

6. As such, Will Shakspere is what Milton termed &quot;a liue-long
Monument&quot; - hence Christopher Marlowe's 'survival' of his reputed
'death' at Deptford on May 30, 1593.

7. There is much more - but the above conveys the essence of my
composite &quot;author&quot;.

Yes, there is no evidence in fact for anything much, that does not lean on
an initial predeliction for its interpretation. That is, there is no
historic evidence. So what exists is in the texts. Even Strat Rowse thought
so.

He says the evidence is lies in his reading of the texts, and noticeable
changes as the Author matures.

Other evidential material might be to suggest that no one else attained such
powerful writing as singular writers; in which case we must either assume
something about the Author which may be unique in all English literature, or
shall we instead think that the combination of an understanding of mythic
origins, wrapped in the clothes of the time, and written to charm and
entertain all comers for 400 years, is evidence of another sort?

&quot;Look, Phil, this is a very simple matter, rather like asking &quot;How

you would huff and puff for many paragraphs, perhaps rejecting the

claiming that the question loses all legitimacy because it omits other
vegetables. You would claim that the questioner has a hidden Legumist

&gt;&gt; Phil, do you really think Stratfordians have as little reason for
their
&gt;&gt; belief that Shakespeare wrote the plays contemporaries, books
published
&gt;&gt; during his lifetime and a monument say he did as cargo culters had
for
&gt;&gt; their beliefs?

&gt; As much as it makes sense to talk generally about any group of
people. There
&gt; are two sorts of Stratfordians after all, the vast majority who
simple
&gt; answer &quot;who wrote the Works?&quot; with William of Stratford, because that
is
&gt; what they have been assured.

&gt; Another kind of Strat is encountered in this newsgroup; and these are
people
&gt; who have studied varieties of source material to warrant their own
&gt; understanding of the Author, as well as also knowing that their are
other
&gt; claimants at all!

&gt; In highly rhetorical and heated exchanges with these other claimants,
there
&gt; is indeed great similarity to cargo-cult behavior as exhibited by its
&gt; priesthood. A self-enclosed and self-referencing world which cites
ludicrous
&gt; aspects of one's rhetorical opponents as reasonable excuse for one's

I think we are not perceiving the initial point of this message, which is to
the immediate effect that casting such analogies - however apt, but
sometimes spurious (plate tectonics!? &lt;g&gt;), and usually dismissive - stand
/in place/ of substantiating one's own 'fact'.

And the second point, [citing Popper's methodology], where facts are
developed as a result of one's own research, is to note that these are also
seen as refutations of other 'facts', whereas Popper suggests they several
perspectives may be equally valid and even equally profound, and
additionally, that several perspectives are necessary to form a full
understanding of the subject, so that partialities can be transcended.

Not only are differing perspectives valid and necessary to this process of
metagenesis, but also of different /forms/ of perspective, so that empirical
knowledge surrounding the history and circumstances of the subject, can be
met and joined by a priori metempirical perspectives as may be encountered
in the texts themselves.

Cordially, Phil Innes

Wegner proposed to explain the widely recognized fact that the Atlantic
continents appear to fit like pieces of a puzzle, and that the rock strata
on either side of the Atlantic (and other bodies of water) match up well.
His hypothesis was thought interesting, but didn't quite add up to being a
&quot;theory&quot; since he provided no mechanism for continents to float around.

For purposes of developing or rejecting this analogy, what is interesting is
that there really wasn't any other satisfactory explanation. I used to have
an old atlas (50's era, I believe) which showed a three-panel sequence of
the earth expanding like a balloon from a smallish primeval sphere of solid
ground to a larger sphere with some water filling the gaps in the surface,
to our current state. Today, the theoretical underpinnings seem very weak -
where did all that material come from? meteors, I suppose - but back then
*somebody* bought it (I was probably one of them).

Wegner's theory became widely accepted when enough of the earth's structure
was understood to propose a mechanism - plate tectonics. I think it was
only afterward that the physical drift of the continents was confirmed by
actual measurement.

I don't take offense at the term, I simply think it entirely invalid.
The cargo cultists had one fact--that airplanes brought food and other
good things. From this one fact, they irrationally assumed that a
totem made to look like an airplane would cause food and other good
things to arrive to them (or so my vague memory of the cargo cult has
it). Stratfordians have a large number of facts from which they draw,
very rationally, the conclusion that Shakespeare was Shakespeare.
Moreover, everyone in the cargo cult defected to a more realistic
understanding within a generation whereas the scholarly majority has
not lost a single member to anti-Stratfordianism after several
generations.

Also English established itself as, arguably, the world's leading
language. What would Shakespeare's reputation be had he written in
Romanian?

Here's Barzun on discussing your sixth point:

&quot;In the course of time, the admiration for Shakespeare became
conventional
rather than the expression of individual judgment. By then, it had
created
an industry. Innumerable books explained large meanings and difficult
passages; there were &quot;keys&quot; to Shakespeare; editions of the complete
works
with illustrations; single plays with notes for school use; scholarship
upon
the early folios and quartos of the plays; attempts at biography based
on
the meager evidence; speculation about the woman mentioned in the
Sonnets
and &quot;Mr. W. H.&quot; who shares the honor with her; comparisons with the
other
Elizabethan playwrights; finally, rival theories about the true
authorship
of the plays and solving of the &quot;ciphers&quot; supposedly hidden in the
text....
it is clear that the fuss and fret *around* Shakespeare is of greater
economic and cultural importance than the works themselves.

&quot;The plays are indeed produced, often and in many places.... but the
productions rarely last long or make money.... When he is put on, his
work
is cut, rearranged, and these days almost invariably altered in some
essentials to make it &quot;attractive&quot;...

&quot;Thus the &quot;greatest of poets hitherto&quot; stands between two worlds:
unlimited
praise and fame and study on the one hand, and on the other the works
on the
stage....

&quot;...What is not allowable for a serious literary mind is to .... remain
in
the conventional rut, saying out loud &quot;Shakespeare - oh, wonderful,
sublime!&quot;, and thinking &quot;what a bore!&quot;

- How the Romantics Invented Shakespeare, from A Jacques Barzun Reader.

&gt;&gt; detailed arguments based on a great deal more facts than
&gt;&gt; any cargo culter had for his superstition against their
&gt;&gt; opponents. The analogy is very poor. Probably the best
&gt;&gt; such negative analogy for Stratfordians would be to
&gt;&gt; opponents of plate techtonics. But they had facts on
&gt;&gt; their side, and gave in when the final facts came in.

&gt; This seems like a pretty good analogy to me, although it
&gt; does rather beg the question of what the &quot;final&quot; facts

There is more to it. He is one of the all-time two or three greatest

that Creepy and the Phul* and Cousin Dickie and all the rest become so

cannot, they stare and stare and stare until they begin to hallucinate.

He has also an almost preternatural ability to cast the most transparent
speech of his characters in exquisite verse that somehow still seems
like natural conversation. Few verse dramatists can accomplish the feat
more than once or twice in a play. For a non-Shakespearean example of
the sort of thing I mean, consider these few lines from Dunlap's &quot;André&quot;
(1798), which is rather on my mind just now, because I've been editing it.

Take thou these verses;
And, after my decease, send them to her
Whose name is woven in them; whose image,
Hath controul’d my destiny. Such tokens
Are rather out of date. Fashions
There are in love as in all else; they change
As variously. A gallant Knight, erewhile,
Of Coeur de Lion’s day, would, dying, send
His heart home to its mistress; degenerate

your 'exegeses' of the Sonnets. Neil Brennen in partic-
ular has in the past made remarks which I took to show
that he saw little difference between our complaints.

But he is wrong. There is a significant difference
between us. You offer only an *interpretation* which
you want to discuss, without giving any *reason* - other
than your own belief in it - for claiming that your
interpretation must have been one that the author put
there deliberately.

I, on the other hand, whilst being quite happy to talk
about whether the riddle is grammatical enough, or
meaningful enough, or Jacobean enough, or convincing
enough to have been intentional, need to make it clear
that this is not addressing my *main* reason for claim-
ing it to be *valid*, which has nothing to do with
these things, but with probability - pure and simple.

Given the range of wonderful excuses for people not
to deal with this, of which yours is just the latest, my
own belief is increasingly that, when it comes to
refuting this particular argument, you (and the others
who have offered these excuses) would if you could

Wegener did not seriously propose any.
He made a few tentative suggestions, fully
admitting that they were no more than that.
Likewise, those who put forward theories
for electricity, or lightning, and for HUGE
numbers of other natural phenomena, had
no idea what the underlying mechanism
was. Sometimes, like Wegener, they put
forward tentative theories. That did not get
in the way of their ideas being accepted.
No one refused to use telephones, or electric
light, or run trains, because they did not
really understand how it all worked.

Darwin had no idea how natural selection
worked, nor did anyone for some sixty years
or so, until Mendel's work on genes was
found. But then no one had any idea how
genes worked for another sixty or so years
until the structure of DNA was established.

The geologists refusal to accept Wegener on
the basis of the 'driving mechanism' is 100%
bullshit. How many have since gone down

What you fail to understand, Paul, is that Wegener's theory went
against common sense. As far as anyone knew, the position of the
continents had not changed in thousands of years. It would have been
quite moronic for any geologist to accept Wegener's theory before the
final facts came in--that showed the continents DID move.
At that point, most, but not all geologists, accepted Wegener's theory,
not because they were a new generation, but because the facts supported
it.

Note: five or more generations of Shakespeare scholars have surveyed
the theory that Shakespeare did not write the plays ascribed to him,
and pronounced it nonsense. Only one reacted similarly to Wegener's
theory.

will always be high, in the same way as the
odds against you having the name 'Peter
Farey' are high. But they mean nothing.

Is the message present AT ALL? Or did
you just grant yourself more than enough
freedom of ingenuity and flexibility and

I am sure you did. You are sure you didn't.

Despite your saying something which any other Brit
would assume to be irony, I am going to trust you,
Bob.

There are some words which in the original epigraph
have a larger initial letter than one might have
expected, and there are some with a smaller one
than one might have expected.

There are also some words which, if interpreted in
a way which is *different* to how one might usually
think they meant in the monument, lead to a totally
different meaning for the epigraph as a whole.

In each case there are seven words to which this
applies more than to any others and, out of a total of
seventy words, they just happen to be the same ones.
Two sets of seven words apparently occurring at
random, right?

Now this was what I said to Tom Reedy:

&quot;Please allow me to explain why I said that your
statement to Bob that it was &quot;about as impressive
as figuring the odds against your name being Bob
Grumman instead of the millions of other names that
are in use&quot; showed that you didn't understand my
argument. I'll use a typical textbook-type example.

We put 70 balls marked from 1 to 70 into a bag,
from which I ask you to pick 7 at random, without
looking. You happen to pick numbers 21, 30, 37,
45, 50, 53 and 68. What are the odds against you
picking that particular combination? 1,198,774,720
to 1. Is it in any way surprising that you picked
those numbers though? No, of course not, because
the same odds would have applied whichever of the
1,198,774,720 possible combinations you'd chosen.

Now, however, we put those balls back, mix them up
thoroughly, and you again pick 7. You get exactly
the same 7 balls as you did the first time. What
are the odds against you picking that particualar
combination? Still 1,198,774,720 to 1. Is it in
any way surprising that you picked exactly the
same combination a second time? Too right it is!
This time there was only *one* of the 1,198,774,720
possible combinations you could have chosen which
matched the first lot.

The odds I quote in support of the validity of the
riddle is, I claim, analogous to the second of these
situations, whereas the argument you gave against it
was analogous to the first.&quot;

If you do finally get it, Bob, explain it to Paul will
you? And if not, please get David Webb to explain
it to you. I give up!

Peter,

After reading your message, I spent half an hour trying to figure out
how to construe the Capitals/Missing Capitals etc. aspects of the
Latin/English inscription from the vantage point of number symbolic
'poetry'.

Here are the results:

Latin text Capitals = IPSMTO = 4129
English text Capitals = SFL TSH PDS = 5684
Elevated letters = STI = 2244
'Non-elevated' letters = RWQ = 3489
Ætatis etc. Capitals = Æ = 301 = 15847

As in 1 + 8477 + 216 + 7153 = 15847, where

1 = Monad,

8477 = Christofer Marley,

216 = Resurrection (Triangle 3:4:5 raised to the third power, as in 27
+ 64 + 125 = 216); and

7153 = Comma of Pythagoragas - ancient symbol of Man's Redemption.

This is Number Symbolic Language for the proposition that Christofer
Marley, 8477, stands for Monad, 1, incarnate as Stratfordian MAN-Beast
en route to Resurrection, 216, and Redemption, 7153.
