The question of whether the December 15 elections might contribute to
social peace in Iraq (always a chancy proposition) began to clarify on
Friday.

The guerrilla war raged with full fury , as two GIs were killed in
Baghdad by a roadside bomb. A suicide bomber on a bicycle killed 10
persons and wounded others at a Shiite mosque in Baladruz northeast of
Baghdad. The death toll from an attack on an Iraqi army base in the
north rose to 10. A bomber targeted a British convoy in Basra, but
missed.

First, Nancy Youssef and Huda Ahmed broke the story that the Iraqi
Supreme Court has ordered the high electoral commission to heed the
warning that several leading Sunni Arab candidates were high-ranking
Baathists and should be disqualified. The affected candidates are
largely from the Iraqiya list of Iyad Allawi and the National Dialogue
Council of Salih Mutlak, both of them hospitable to secular
ex-Baathists. Mutlak predicted turbulence in the streets, with perfect
accuracy (of course, he helped arrange for the turbulence).

Then, Al-Zaman/ AFP [Ar.] : and AP report that some 20,000 mainly
Sunni protesters (along with some secular Shiites) came out in several
cities to protest what they called election fraud. Demonstrations were
held in Baghdad, Mosul, Tikrit and Samarra, among other cities. The
crowds demanded that new elections be held, given the extent of
irregularities they maintained had occurred.

At one of the Baghdad rallies, Adnan Dulaimi of the Iraqi Accord
Front (Sunni Islamist) demanded that the results of the election be
abrogated in every province where any electoral fraud could be
demonstrated. He pledged to "follow all peaceful and legal means to
vindicate the truth and defeat falsehood." His coalition partner, Tariq
al-Hashimi, the secretary general of the Iraqi Islamic Party, said, "our
position of rejecting the results of the elections is reinforced daily,
and before us lies the difficult mission of altering the results and
achieving justice." He said, "The intention to commit fraud was present
even before the ballot boxes were opened." He added, "If we do not
receive an answere, we will rethink our participation in politics, for
we reject a political process that some desire, based on fraud and
lies." The Sunni Arabs, he said, "refuse to be second class citizens."

Shaikh Mahdi al-Sumaidaie, the preacher at the Umm al-Qura Mosque in
West Baghdad said in his sermon that "The Iraqi people, which had
anticipated the rise of national government that would include all
groups, has been shocked by the process of election fraud, and it is
something that the Iraqi people absolutely will not abide." Sumaidaie
had been among the few hard line members of the Association of Muslim
Scholars who had called for Sunnis to participate in the elections.

In Mosul, hundreds of demonstrators marched from the Khidr Mosque
toward the governor's mansion at the center of the city, carrying Iraqi
flags and placards with phrases like "The Electoral Commission is
Subordinating Iraq to its Neighbors" (i.e. Iran), and shouting "No, no!"
to the High Electoral Commission, which they called the "High Fraudulent
Commission."

The demonstrations were called by the Iraqi Accord Front, the Iraq
People's Congress, and the National Dialogue Council one day after 35
coalitions, parties and movements (including some consisting of secular
Shiites) rejected the early results being announced concerning the
outcome of the elections. In those results, the Shiite fundamentalist
coalition, the United Iraqi Alliance, won most of the seats in 9
southern provinces and in Baghdad. The demonstrators shouted that Iran
had intervened in the elections, and said that even a high American
official had complained about Tehran's interference (a reference to Gen.
George Casey.)

(The Bush administration's fear of Iran and of its reigning Iraqi
allies in Baghdad may be destabilizing Iraq by giving ammunition to
disgruntled Sunni Arabs. How many feet does the Bush administration have
left to shoot itself in??)

There was a story floating around last week that a "tanker" full of
"hundreds of thousands" of forged ballots coming from Iran was
discovered and confiscated at the border, with the names but not the
rest of the ballots filled in. This story, which has fed Sunni Arab
discontent, makes no sense. First of all, you can't get hundreds of
thousands of ballots on one truck, even a tanker. Paper is bulky. How
would Iran have a list of plausible Iraqi voters? Iranians mostly print
in nasta'liq script, not the naskh favored in the Arab world, and mostly
use Persian, not Arabic. While Iranian printers could pull off such a
thing, you have to ask, why? If you were going to print fake Arabic
ballots for Iraq, why not just do it in Basra? It is not as if the
United Iraqi Alliance, the presumed beneficiary of the alleged
forgeries, does not control Iraqi printing presses in areas secure
enough for it to commit fraud if it liked. I don't find the story
plausible, but it appears that the US military has actually arrested
Fazel "Abu Tayyib" Jasim , a provincial council member of Kut and a
member of the Shiite Badr Organization (the paramilitary of the Supreme
Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq), implicating him in the affair.
I'd like to see the truck and the ballots on television. One tanker, or
even a fleet of them, couldn't affect centrally an election with
millions of voters.

In any case, these actions and statements of the US military are
unlikely to overturn the election results, which probably give the
religious Shiites control of parliament. But they could further
destabilize Iraq, if that is possible.

Informed sources told al-Zaman that the new government won't be
formed until late February or early March.

SCIRI leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim visited Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani
Friday in Najaf. Afterwards, he issued a statement that he would not
allow the dissolution of the High Electoral Commission, as critics of
the eleciton demanded. He said the criticisms of the election results
were unwarranted, and he called the threats issued by some "a bad
thing." He said, "We have to honor the will of the people." He said that
criticisms of the High Electoral Commission were understandable, but
that to target the people itself was bizarre and unprecedented. He
insisted, "The United Iraqi Alliance too strong for any blocs to stand
before it, since it represents the will of the majority of the Iraqi
people."
