Deciphering some of these USENET X-TRace headers

USENET servers such as Giganews, AIOE, Motzarella, even Google,
encrypt what is probably the username, IP address and/or other
info in an X-Trace or other X-Header.

Is there any way to decipher some of these?

I know this isn't _completely_ on topic for either group, but I
think this would apply to readers of both groups die to it's
technical nature.

No. The user name/address is what you make it, and the IP listed
is the usenet provider's. /Supposedly/ a court order is required
to release the personal info you are referring to.

Bullshit.  Thanks for playing, though.

There are plenty of news servers that publish one or both of the
username and IP address of the sender.  Yes, some news servers
require you to post under the name of your login - provided they
even require logins at all.

It's completely up to the news admins if they want to hand out
that information or not.  Your info is not legally protected in
any way.

I don't have to. G. Morgan told you what it is, genius. Write it

You also said, oh wise one:
&quot;There are plenty of news servers that publish one or both of

Plenty? PUBLISH? Show me headers of ONE which gives the info you

And if it IS encrypted, then please decrypt it because it is
useless otherwise, and, unlike you or the NSA, I do not have
access to 3 weeks on a Cray (OR your brain &quot;power&quot;, see below)
to decrypt somebody's IP address and time of post.

&quot;Yes, some news servers require you to post under the name of

Interesting, not to mention self-contradictory. No log-in, huh?
Do you have to have a computer or do you just send them the
message via your brain waves?

Anyway... I am snipping headers which can not possibly contain
the imaginary data you  are obsessing about, IE : path, from,
date, subject, organization, reply-to, newsgroups, lines, DMCA
stuff, and X-complaints-*.

IOW, I am leaving in Message-ID and any other extra headers
except for things like X-No-Archive.

I am also using TWO different postings from the SAME poster.

This actually appears to contain some unencrypted info (along
with /encrypted/ info, get that Cray fired up!), except it has
/nothing/ to do with the post. Well, given GG is basically out
to a) spam and b) kill the real Usenet, it is somewhat
interesting.

It NEVER fails. Anytime there is a /specific/ question, the
members of this group mysteriously grow silent, backpedal, or
resort to name calling - as you did. Sigh.

I /am/ addressing the topic (&lt;dog knows why) but since you don't
like the truth, you resort to the standard &quot;ultimate defense&quot; of
this group of morons, calling a poster a troll. How original.

Congratulations. You win. Would you prefer a fluffy Shrek or a
fluffy Kermit?

As for the info provided by the other poster regarding
albasani.net, a FREE server, it is quite reasonable for FREE
servers to take such steps since they are FREE and tend to
(among other things) to get abused by spammers (even if only for
a few hours before their account is closed). Same applies to
motzarella.

Still, it IS encrypted (see above) and contains a LOT less info
than you seem to think.

From their FAQ:

&quot;Determining identity

/To file charges I need to know who exactly the author of a
posting is. How can I get this information?/

Relevant items are date, time and the IP address used to send
the posting to our server. With these specifications the
concerning internet service provider can determine the customer.
We store the IP address right in the postings, though
encrypted.&quot;

&quot;The concerning (sic) internet service provider can determine
the customer&quot;. See below. IOW, big fucking deal.

Otherwise, it's EXACTLY like every other Usenet provider in the
world. Just for the hell of it, why don't you contact /any/
premium Usenet provider or major ISP and ask for the full
personal info of one of their subscribers. See how far you get.
(But first, just for fun, decrypt the string. Let us know how
you do.)

Yeah, let's do that, because it *is* (a Usenet server). It's not

Exactly which part of &quot;posting-host=117.26.222.223&quot; don't you
understand? I.e. you have the unencrypted From: and the unencrypted IP
address, exactly as Rev. Newt Zest said.

Bottom line: Some servers generate an unencrypted NNTP-Posting-Host:
header, some don't and some generate *another* encrypted header.

And it acts as an outgoing peer with many other major Usenet
servers, which alone would define it as a Usenet server.  Some
peers are only that and are not accessible VIA NNTP or a GUI, but
that doesn't mean their not Usenet servers.

Google certainly qualifies as a Usenet server on many counts, as
you point out.  A Usenet Spam server, at least ;-)

Answering your original post: different servers use different software, and
even if they're using the same software they use different algorithms.

Here's a link to one:
http://www.albasani.net/technical/x-trace.html.en

So, if you know the algorithm, and they're only using IP address, and no
salt, you could pre-compute all IP addresses and compare your target with
the results.  This is, obviously, sub optimal.

An interesting question though.

are all of you, the difference being I admit it and none of you

&gt; Answering your original post: different servers use different software, and
&gt; even if they're using the same software they use different algorithms.

&gt; Here's a link to one:
&gt; http://www.albasani.net/technical/x-trace.html.en

&gt; So, if you know the algorithm, and they're only using IP address, and no
&gt; salt, you could pre-compute all IP addresses and compare your target with
&gt; the results.  This is, obviously, sub optimal.

Of course nowadays NNTP is the most commonly used protocol, both for
peer-to-peer and for client/newsreader-server. Besides Google Groups,
there are other service providers which offer 'web-news' and hence use
HTTP. Also some peer-to-peer connections are still using UUCP, but they
are a small minority.

My *point* however was that the transport protocol is basically
irrelevant. It only matters what a given system *does*. Google Groups
offers Usenet services, both to users and to its peers, so for all
intents and purposes it's a Usenet server.

A common analogy might help you see the light: Probably no-one in hir
right mind would consider a webmail service, not to be a mail service.
Service implies server, i.e. mail server and likewise Usenet server.

If &quot;public&quot; implies a private consumer - i.e. not a company,
institution, etc, - then as explained above NNTP is the most common/used
protocol, and HTTP is the second most common/used. Probably others are
used, but very seldomly.

But as I mentioned, Usenet/News predates the Internet and hence both
NNTP and HTTP, and hence doesn't *need* either. It just needs *a*
transport. In the past even (reel-to-reel) magtape was sometimes used
and I've presonally used diskettes. And when using a multi-user system -
like UNIX - newsreaders could (and some - like mine - still can) read
directly from the 'spool', i.e. they also didn't/don't need a transport
to read/post.

I know a lot of people aggressively disdain proper spelling but

&gt;&gt; &gt; Please feel free (to show your ignorance -&gt; stupidity).

&gt;&gt; Ignorance is not stupidity, it is lack of knowledge about

&gt;   Indeed. That's why I used the arrow. I.e. first you

&gt; which - as you say - is perfectly fine, but when you

Hope you don't mind, it's &quot;good /for/ you&quot;.

I have had so many fights in n.s.r. I really should never come

&gt;&gt; OK, I read up on UUCP etc. First time I ever heard of it.
&gt;&gt; I thought that even in those days anything going over
&gt;&gt; phone lines that was not voice was considered to be the
&gt;&gt; internet, however one chose to call it. But I have NO
&gt;&gt; problem admitting my ignorance when doing so is justified.
&gt;&gt; Still, GG uses http. Care to elaborate a bit on http vs.
&gt;&gt; /any/ accepted, or at least /commonly used/ **USENET**
&gt;&gt; protocols?

&gt;   Of course nowadays NNTP is the most commonly used
&gt;   protocol, both for
&gt; peer-to-peer and for client/newsreader-server. Besides
&gt; Google Groups, there are other service providers which
&gt; offer 'web-news' and hence use HTTP. Also some peer-to-peer
&gt; connections are still using UUCP, but they are a small
&gt; minority.

&gt;   My *point* however was that the transport protocol is
&gt;   basically
&gt; irrelevant. It only matters what a given system *does*.
&gt; Google Groups offers Usenet services, both to users and to
&gt; its peers, so for all intents and purposes it's a Usenet
&gt; server.
">

Well, that way of looking at things is actually quite reasonable
so I can not argue. I /think/ I previously posted under the
impression we were arguing about the tech side rather than the
&quot;user-experience&quot; side - such as it is with GG.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And last but not least Google Groups' peers happily

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, that's what I said (&quot;It's not *publically*

&gt;&gt; &quot;Publicly&quot;

Yeah, I read UUCP is still used by some large companies for
rather obscure business communications.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; magtape was sometimes used and I've presonally used

&gt; newsreaders could (and some - like mine - still can) read

Personally, I think publicly is both preferred and more logical than
publically.

'-ly' generally means for an adverb to modify a verb by causing the verb
to be in an x-manner.

Therefore it would be logical for 'publicly' to mean in a public manner,
or in public.  It isn't logical for the adverb to be publically or in a
publical manner.

Publicly sounds right.  Publically sounds wrong.  Some worthwhile
dictionaries don't recognize publically.  Some other dictionaries which
do recognize publically say that it means publicly and that publicly
'comes first' and that publically isn't used much.

And I especially think that it is a stupid argument to be carrying on in
this group and I especially think that the disagreement isn't something
that people should be getting annoyed about in any case.  It doesn't
make any sense to correct someone here over saying publicly instead of
publically when the correction could be considered to be in error.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; predates the Internet
