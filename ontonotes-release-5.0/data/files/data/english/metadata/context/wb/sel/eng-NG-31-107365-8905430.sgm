ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP 'HAS CONTAMINATED SAVLON'
By David Batty and agencies, Guardian Unlimited

Aug 30 - Hundreds of thousands of bottles and tubes of Savlon have
been removed from sale after animal rights activists claimed to have
contaminated them.

The Animal Rights Militia said it had tampered with 250 Savlon
antiseptic products as part of a campaign against an animal testing
laboratory. Savlon is primarily marketed as a treatment for
children's cuts and grazes.

The group did not say how the items had been tampered with, but it
also claimed to have contaminated Novartis contact lens solution, on
sale in France, by injecting bottles with bleach.

It said it had targeted Savlon because it believed the product's
Swiss manufacturer, Novartis, was a client of the Huntingdon Life
Sciences (HLS) research centre.

In a statement addressed to the Novartis chief executive, Daniel
Vasella, the group said the campaign against the firm would continue
unless it severed its ties with HLS.

It made the contamination claim in a statement posted on the website
of the US Animal Liberation Front magazine BiteBack on Tuesday.

&quot;Over the last five days, over 250 tubes and bottles of ... Savlon
have been tampered with in the north of England in stores such as
Superdrug, Boots and other well-known stores.

&quot;We don't want to kill living beings like Novartis, but the side
effects and the inevitable hospital stay will give people an idea of
what Novartis pays for inside Huntingdon Life Sciences.

&quot;The message is clear and uncompromising ... you must stop killing
animals inside Huntingdon Life Sciences or this will only be the
beginning of our campaign.&quot;

On the same day, the group issued a similar warning about
contaminated bottles of contact lens solution being sold in France.

&quot;On August 25-27, 85 bottles of Solo Care, Aqua made at Novartis
were infected across France,&quot; it said. &quot;We infected Vision
Origionale, Atol, Krys, Optical Center and Optique Jardin.&quot; It
claimed the contaminant was hydrogen peroxide.

In 1984, the Animal Rights Militia claimed to have poisoned supplies
of Mars bars, but later admitted this was a hoax. The group said the
action had caused huge financial losses for the chocolate
manufacturer.

There is no evidence that Savlon products have been contaminated,
but Novartis said it was taking the threat seriously and had
contacted police and the shops it supplies.

&quot;This appears to be part of the long-running campaign by animal
rights extremists which adversely affects both Novartis and our
consumers,&quot; a company spokesman said.

The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said it was working
with Novartis, retailers and the Medicines and Healthcare Products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to investigate.

An Acpo spokesman said: &quot;Our overriding priority is to ensure that
members of the public remain safe at all times.&quot;

The MHRA, which regulates the safety of medicines and medical
devices, said customers should check Savlon product packaging and
not use anything that may have been tampered with.

A spokeswoman for Boots said the company wanted to &quot;reassure
customers that their safety is our number one priority&quot; and had
withdrawn all Savlon products from its stores across the country
until investigations had been carried out.

SCIENTISTS' BLINDERS COST HUMAN AND ANIMAL LIVES
By Jessica Sandler and Kate Willett, Ph.D., www.opednews.com

Aug 15 - Is there any adult in America who is unaware that exposure
to asbestos is linked to certain cancers and respiratory diseases?
The cause and effect has been conclusively documented, yet our
government is now proposing to spend hundreds of thousands of
taxpayer dollars and use tens of thousands of animals to re-explore
this issue.

And that's just the tip of this illogical iceberg. The Department of
Health and Human Services' National Toxicology Program (NTP) also
wants to do more experiments on animals with such known dangerous
substances as methanol, ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and diacetyl,
an ingredient of microwave popcorn butter flavoring that
causes &quot;popcorn workers' lung disease&quot;—a sometimes fatal
deterioration of the lungs of factory workers who handle it.

When we have reams of studies involving people and we know that
something is just bad news, why would anyone suggest poisoning more
animals with it? The answer points to a larger problem: Our
government isn't keeping up with current science. The proof is in a
recently released report by the National Academy of Sciences, our
government's chief advisory body on all things scientific, which
calls for the use of more effective non-animal methods for testing
suspect substances.

According to &quot;Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a
Strategy,&quot; by the Academy's National Research Council (NRC),
toxicity experiments using animals are expensive, time-consuming and
don't reliably predict what happens to people exposed to the
chemicals. Asbestos and butter flavoring are perfect examples, as
neither one of these substances affects animals in the same way that
they do humans. There has been a revolution in our understanding of
biology since the 1950s and '60s, when many of the animal tests that
are now in use were devised. The NRC report describes the potential
effect of this revolution: &quot;Toxicity testing is approaching a
scientific pivot point .... It is poised to take advantage of the
revolutions in biology and biotechnology&quot; and largely replace animal
tests with cutting-edge non-animal methods.

Yet according to the report, many scientists are so comfortable with
the status quo that they won't welcome any change: &quot;[C]urrent
toxicity-testing practices are long established and deeply ingrained
in some sectors,&quot; the report warns. &quot;Thus, some resistance to the
vision proposed by this committee is expected.&quot; Rather than upset
its system, the government's current animal-testing programs
virtually ignore the new science and an entire era of scientific
progress.

PETA saw this first-hand recently, when we testified to NTP
representatives at the meeting of its Board of Scientific Counselors
at Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. They acknowledged the
truth of what we said—that animal tests are unpredictive—and then
confirmed the report's concern that some scientists will resist
change against all reason. When we pointed out that animals exposed
to butter flavoring don't show the same effects as humans, one
panelist acknowledged that, yes, &quot;it's not clear how one would
extrapolate findings from the animal studies to humans&quot; then went on
to state, in a shocking non sequitur, &quot;but that doesn't lessen my
enthusiasm for this study.&quot;

While our initial interest in toxicology was prompted by our desire
to protect animals from cruel, useless experiments, the fact that
these animal tests do not adequately protect public health or the
environment should be of the utmost concern to everyone.

Rather than maintaining this ineffective status quo, the government
should apply its resources to the use of human-relevant non-animal
methods to regulate toxic chemicals. The scientists whose mandate is
protecting the public health need to get a copy of the NRC report
and study it cover to cover. We have the information we need to
protect popcorn and asbestos workers—and many others—right now.
Giving a green light to this bottomless pit of animal tests delays
needed protections, wastes taxpayer funds, is cruel to animals and
represents just plain shoddy science.

PETA's science policy advisor, Dr. Kate Willett, holds a Ph.D. in
genetics; Jessica Sandler, director of PETA's regulatory testing
division, is a former government safety and health official.

ANIMAL RIGHTS GETS 'RIGHTEOUS'
By Mark Gould, The Guardian

Aug 15 - What with corpse-snatching and campaigns of intimidation
against scientists and animal breeders by extremists, the animal
rights lobby has of late toppled off the moral high ground. That is,
until last month when a small charity, the British Union for the
Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), scored a high court victory that
found the government guilty of turning a blind eye to the extent of
suffering of animals in licensed experiments.

BUAV supplied undercover video evidence that proved the Home Office
acted unlawfully by licensing brain experiments on marmosets at
Cambridge University as &quot;moderate&quot; rather than &quot;substantial&quot;
suffering.

It is the first success for BUAV's new chief executive Michelle
Thew. She hopes that fewer licences will be granted as experiments
now correctly categorised as &quot;substantial&quot; will no longer pass the
key cost-benefit test. It will also mean the public is made more
aware of the issue.

Thew, 42, returns to BUAV after three years as chief executive of a
US charity, Animal Protection Institute. Her career has included
spells as an education officer in Derbyshire and as chief executive
of the National Deaf Children's Society. Part of her new role is
distancing the movement from the thugs and zealots. &quot;Our supporters
are law-abiding people. We are against violence and intimidation.
Those people do the movement a disservice.&quot;

BUAV was founded in 1898 by suffragette Frances Power Cobbe, and
Thew says she wants to reinvigorate the organisation with the spirit
of a righteous struggle. But she also wants to tap into the new
appetite for environmentalism. She wants the &quot;bag-for-life brigade&quot;
to see animal rights as part of the wider agenda and to be aware
that tests that decades ago became synonymous with cruelty are still
done in UK.

&quot;There is a UK ban on cosmetics tested on animals and an EU ban BUAV
led on that will be coming into force shortly. But you can still buy
products in the UK whose ingredients are imported and have been
tested on animals. The EU needs to draw a line because only then
will companies step up to the challenge of alternatives to animal
tests.&quot;

But does she accept that in pioneering surgery or medical
experimentation, animals must suffer to save lives? &quot;Animal
experimentation should be consigned to the history books - there are
plenty of alternatives. A lot of research is simply carried out in
the race to get a paper printed in a scientific journal and is of no
practical use whatsoever.&quot;

TESTING OF PET-FOOD NOT KIND TO LAB ANIMALS

Sept 4 - I've never given much thought to how they test pet food. I
just presumed they mixed it in huge machines and it came out as
pellets or biscuits that dogs and cats could munch at their leisure.
But after reading The New York Times' magazine story on Sunday &quot;They
Eat What We Are&quot; by Frederick Kaufman, I'll never feel the same
again about about a bag of pet food. Kaufman interviews Dr. George
Fahey at the University of Illinois where dogs are kept in a
basement and forced to undergo surgical procedures, I can't even
describe here, to test how much of their foods are digested.
Needless to say it involved plastic tubing being inserted into their
bowels and lots of other things no animal should have to suffer.
Fahey's nutrition laboratories use the dogs as control groups to
test commercial pet foods. As Kaufman points out pet food is a $15
billion a year business and Fahey's research is intended to spare
pet-food manufacturers &quot;the negative publicity they might attract if
they ran their own experiements on surgically altered dogs.&quot; The
haunting ending to Kaufman's article with the lab dogs watching with
plaintive eyes &quot;clearly begging, but begging for what?&quot; then break
out howling and whining as the doors to their prison close, is heart
wrenching. &quot;What made them so upset?&quot; Kaufman says, only to be told
by Fahey: &quot;They thought you were going to take them out to play.
Look what you did.&quot;

THEY EAT WHAT WE ARE
By Frederick Kaufman, www.nytimes.com
Published: September 2, 2007

I had been told that in the basement of the animal-science
laboratory building at the University of Illinois, Dr. George Fahey
kept a colony of strange-looking dogs. At Fahey's orders, each of
the dogs had undergone a surgical procedure to string a length of
tubing from its intestinal tract to a clear plastic spout that stuck
out its side. Fahey, a professor of animal and nutritional sciences,
could open a spout by hand, fill a bag with whatever happened to
ooze out and calculate how much the dog had digested before whatever
it had not digested could move farther through its body. The plastic
tubing was inserted in the ileum — the exact spot where food
absorption ends and fermentation by the microflora and bacteria of
the lower bowel begins. Given a large enough sample of any dog food,
George Fahey could calculate how much vitamin or mineral or fat or
sugar would enter a dog's bloodstream and how much would be
irretrievably lost. Fahey has spent his career investigating the
metabolism of domestic animals, and his research has helped define
the nature of pet food.

In addition to his dog colony, Fahey supervised a number of other
nutrition laboratories in the university's department of animal
sciences, and for the most part his workaday hardware consisted of
the various contrivances necessary to measure how much food a pet
might or might not digest. Thus the baroque collections of
viscometers, desiccators and pulverizers, the vials brimming with
dog excreta laced with acid, the racks of test tubes filled with cat
urine, the containers of canine and feline gastric fluid and the
retorts of dog and cat blood. The largest of his labs contained a
walk-in refrigerator holding glass jars of secret-coded dog and cat
diets, experimental feeds of the future that in their present states
resembled nothing more than heaps of brown dust. Piled nearby were
stacks and stacks of the commercial pet foods the researchers give
to animals in the control groups of their experiments — brands Fahey
did not want specified in this article.

I had come to Urbana-Champaign to tour Fahey's nutrition
laboratories and to catch a glimpse behind the scenes of the canine-
and feline-nutrition business. I had geared myself up to see those
plugged dogs in the basement, but first we had to spend an hour or
so strolling the upper floors of offices and laboratories. As we
did, Fahey outlined the evolution of the canine habitat, from the
wild to the barnyard to the front yard to the front porch, then from
the front porch to the living room, from the living room to the
bedroom, and from the bedroom to the bed — and under the sheets. He
described how, to people who live alone or couples without children,
a dog or a cat becomes an object of love. And an object of love must
be civilized.

Civilized means different things to different people, and it does
not necessarily have anything to do with a pet's nutritional
requirements. Dogs can get along just fine on a daily ration of corn
and soybeans. &quot;That's about the cheapest diet you could put
together,&quot; Fahey said, and it provides all the vitamins, minerals,
protein, fat and carbohydrates a dog needs. But it wouldn't sell to
broad segments of the modern market.

&quot;People buy diets on the basis of two things,&quot; Fahey said. &quot;The
first is palatability. You put it on the floor and the dogs clean up
the bowl.&quot; He lifted a pencil from a desk and held it in the air.
The second thing, he explained, is the appearance of the stool. &quot;It
should be half as long as this pencil, picked up as easily as this
pencil, Ziplocked — and away we go.&quot; He added, &quot;We have to have that
if they're keeping the dog in the condo on the 34th floor and they
have a white carpet.&quot; All the more so if the dog is in bed, under
the sheets.

The reason Fahey has spent his scientific career investigating all
manner of starch, carbohydrate and fiber, the reason he has put
tubes inside dogs to analyze what they have digested before they
have finished digesting it — that reason suddenly became clear:
George Fahey has been confronting the myriad challenges of
controlling canine bowel movements. Premium dog foods contain at
least 30 percent protein and 20 percent fat, he said. &quot;Do we need to
feed that much? No. But this way, you have a total tract
digestibility of 88 percent, which is good if you don't want that
dog to go in your house when you're out for the day. A corn-soy diet
can't do that. The dog can't hold it.&quot;

For all the apparent variety — store shelves stocked with everything
from Alpo to ZiwiPeak — pet food is a business of behemoths and
bottom lines, with sales approaching $15 billion last year. Procter
&amp; Gamble acquired Iams for more than $2 billion in 1999, and two
years later Nestlé purchased Ralston Purina for $11 billion. A
single multinational, Mars Petcare, sells not only Whiskas and
Pedigree but also Royal Canin, Sheba, Kitekat, Frolic, Trill,
Aquarian and many other brands. In 2005, the big companies in the
industry spent nearly $300 million on advertising.

With his academic status and independent financing, George Fahey's
research spares pet-food manufacturers the negative publicity they
might attract if they ran their own experiments on surgically
altered dogs. Even so, the industry giants operate proprietary
research centers, like the 60,000-square-foot facility in St. Louis
where Nestlé Purina scientists conduct investigations into molecular
biology, immunology and aroma chemistry. But as the pet-food titans
pour millions into developing and mass-producing chow, biscuits and
treats, they have been challenged by manifold new marketers of high-
end animal diets that pride themselves on their organic suppliers,
sustainable packaging, human-food-grade ingredients and
revolutionary philosophy.

The recall this spring of 60 million packages of pet food
contaminated with melamine from China highlighted what was already
an obsessive focus on what our dogs and cats eat. In recent years,
the relative merits of low-cholesterol diets, high-protein diets,
low-fat diets and the BARF program of bones and raw food have
generated arguments among pet-food zealots as enduring and bitter as
Atkins versus Pritikin among human dieters. Web sites like
BalanceIt.com offer astounding arrays of pet food recipes that mimic
human cuisine and use human-grade ingredients: lasagna, spaghetti
and meatballs, lamb stew. Numerous sellers offer doggy doughnuts,
cannoli and even wedding cakes.

In fact, the lines of human and companion-animal nutrition have been
tightly interwoven ever since the domestication of the dog some
12,000 years ago. Our culinary ambitions for our pets have defined
something of a utopian project, and its refinements have mirrored
our own relationship with food. The increasing specialization of the
pet-food industry today may well reflect not just our desire to keep
our pets healthy but also our continuing urge to shape them in our
own image.

The first commercial dog comestible appeared soon after James
Spratt, a Cincinnati electrician, traveled to London in 1860 to
market lightning rods, then changed his mind and entered the
business of retailing a feed inspired by his own dog's diet of
discarded ship's biscuits. In the early 20th century, Chappel
Brothers of Rockford, Ill., supplied canned horse meat to the hungry
citizens of France, Holland and Italy — and exported the scraps back
to the United States as dog food. Chappel Brothers marketed Ken-L
Ration and at its apex slaughtered more than 50,000 horses a year.

But as the desire for purity and health spread to growing numbers of
Americans, it influenced their hopes and dreams for their pets. In
the book &quot;The Ralston Brain Regime,&quot; a turn-of-the-century human-
diet guru named Webster Edgerly presented &quot;a course of conduct,
exercises and study designed to develop perfect health in the
physical brain.&quot; The name Ralston was itself an acronym of Edgerly's
seven life principles: Regime, Activity, Light, Strength,
Temperation, Oxygen and Nature. One of the 800,000 &quot;Ralstonite&quot;
acolytes Edgerly eventually attracted happened to be William H.
Danforth, a young fitness fanatic and animal-feed entrepreneur who
had begun to shovel together a mix of grain, molasses and salt that
he sold under the brand name Purina, &quot;where purity is paramount.&quot;
When Danforth approached Edgerly, the diet celebrity granted Purina
an endorsement from &quot;Dr. Ralston,&quot; and the company took on a new
name.

Despite the emphasis on health, food for animals has long been prone
to potentially lethal adulteration. In the 1920s and '30s,
industrial processing generated a number of newfangled carbohydrate
byproducts that entered the food stream, and a terrible ailment
known as canine hysteria began to torment dogs. &quot;The animal behaves
in a thoroughly panic-stricken manner,&quot; noted a report by Food and
Drug Administration scientists in 1948, &quot;throwing itself against the
sides of the cage, clawing the air and howling piteously. If
unconfined, it will run wildly about bumping into all objects in its
path.&quot; In acute cases the disease culminated in convulsions and
death, and the culprit turned out to be a chemical wheat-bleaching
agent used in processing flour. Of course, there would have been no
panic-stricken dogs if there had been no processed flour in their
food, and no processed flour in their food if there had been no
processed flour in human food.

Notwithstanding such occasional defilements, research into pet food
and human food continued to follow parallel paths. In 1954, a pair
of Ralston Purina visionaries borrowed an extruder from the human
breakfast cereal group at Purina, where the apparatus was being used
to produce a variety of new breakfast cereals like Chex. The
investigators cleaned out the rice flour, salt and sugar, packed the
machine with emulsified livers, buttermilk, soy meal and other
ingredients, mixed everything together and let the slurry dry on an
asphalt lot. &quot;It tasted similar to popcorn,&quot; one of its creators
later wrote — and dogs loved it. When the marketing meetings began,
Purina executives decided that instead of distributing the product
to the company's nationwide web of feed stores, this new pet food,
code-named X-24, would go to supermarkets, where it could be bought
and sold next to human groceries. Within four years, Purina Dog Chow
had become the best-selling dry dog food in the world.

The vast majority of America's 75 million dogs and 88 million cats
continue to feed on scraps from the human food industry's table: pet-
food ingredients like ground chicken bones, pig blood and distillers
byproducts. Indeed, when an agriculture-processing company
encounters an industrial leftover — corn fiber, let's say, from its
production of ethanol — it might put in a call to George Fahey's
lab. Fahey has done a great deal of work with corn fiber and is
exploring its potential as a source of fiber in the canine diet.

Although pet nutrition has generally followed trends in human
nutrition, sometimes that order has been reversed. &quot;We will see corn
fiber in human foods like cereals and snacks,&quot; Fahey told
me. &quot;There's no reason that it should not be able to be used.&quot; Such
adaptations have occurred before. In the 1980s, for instance, the
experimental meals Fahey fed to the dogs in his lab sometimes
included hydrogen-peroxide-treated wheat straw. A major manufacturer
of baked goods for humans, he said, picked up on the idea of using
hydrogen-peroxide-treated fiber and experimented with mixing the
substance into some of its breads.

Experiments with cats and dogs have long been used as a key to the
scientific mysteries of the human diet. For obvious reasons,
scientists cannot test human digestion by delivering experimental
meals that lack vital nutriments. Dogs, however, have metabolism
similar to ours, they are widely available and their internal organs
are larger than those of rats, which makes them well suited to
examination. In 1816, a French physiologist, FranÃ§ois Magendie, fed
groups of dogs only a single food, like sugar or olive oil. The
animals died, but Magendie helped identify the dietary requirement
for protein. In 1921, Edward Mellanby, a British pharmacologist,
conducted an experiment in which he raised hundreds of puppies
indoors. In the total absence of sunlight, and eating nothing but
oats, the dogs developed skeletal deformities associated with
rickets, but Sir Mellanby laid the groundwork for the discovery of
vitamin D. In fact, some of the vitamins sold at your local
supermarket or health food store were discovered thanks to
deficiency studies that left experimental colonies of domesticated
animals emaciated or comatose.

Paradoxically, the same nutrition experiments that caused disease or
death have led to pioneering advances in animal health care. Because
nutritional biochemists have measured almost everything about the
canine and feline diets — from energy densities to intestinal
transit times — they know what to do when something goes wrong. The
latest word in digestibility studies may have cost lab animals a
score of nasty symptoms, but the data gathered will help save many
sick pets down the road.

The William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the
University of California, Davis, houses what was the first
therapeutic pet nutrition center in America when it opened in 2003.
Today the hospital treats more than 25,000 small animals every year,
and the nutrition center does much of its work on the clinical
frontier where sustenance meets medication. Here, on a wall outside
the Nutrition Support Service, I noted a plaque announcing that the
center had been backed by money from the Nestlé Purina PetCare
Company and Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc. &quot;There's virtually no national
funding out of the federal government for research on the health and
well-being of cats and dogs,&quot; said Bennie Osburn, the dean of the
university's School of Veterinary Medicine. &quot;We have not seen N.I.H.
show interest. The U.S.D.A. has not shown interest. The federal
government will provide basic funding for ornamental flowers, but
not companion animals.&quot;In the hospital's hallways, white-coated
doctors walked sick and bandaged pets, while weaker animals reclined
on low gurneys. Inside the nutrition center, staff members were
formulating individualized diets for the patients. Along one wall of
the room ran a line of more than 30 clear plastic dispensers of
various kibbles in every shade of ocher, and next to the standard
brands of cat food sat jumbo packs of GastroENteric Feline Formula,
Kidney Function Feline Formula and Diabetes Management Feline
Formula. There were jars of oral electrolyte solution, milk
replacers for neonates, protein supplements made from whey and
synthetic diets for critically ill animals on life support. Above
the provisions and extracts sat two rice steamers for those patients
whose gastrointestinal upset would allow them only bland foods like
white rice. In fact, human food pervaded the pet nutrition center,
from Chicken of the Sea tuna to Betty Crocker's Potato Buds, not to
mention Metamucil and Fibersure.

&quot;The clinical nutrition program will spread across the country,&quot;
Osburn predicted. Some of his confidence was surely an
administrator's pride in his university, but it didn't seem like a
stretch to imagine that the nutritional products and procedures
developed here — including cancer-care diets and high-fat regimens
for anorectic pets — could soon become successful on the mass
market. Dogs and cats are living longer and growing fatter and more
dyspeptic, and, like their owners, they have to watch the calories.

In 2003, scientists published the genome of a standard poodle named
Shadow, followed two years later by the full genetic sequence of a
boxer named Tasha. Today, as geneticists close in on the cat genome,
researchers and pet-food marketers are rushing to find ways to make
high-end pet diets even more customized.

&quot;This is part of a larger trend in nutrition: complexity and
individualization,&quot; says Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition,
food studies and public health at New York University. &quot;In the
future someone is likely to do a genetic profile of your animal and
prescribe accordingly. How accurate or useful this will be is an
open question.&quot; Genome-based animal feed may evolve into the
ultimate personalized diet for pets, or it may meet the same fate as
the unsuccessful collaboration by Carnation and Upjohn in 1985 to
market birth-control dog food.

Professor Nestle perceives two tracks for the future feeding of
America's cats and dogs, tracks that parallel the nutrition trends
of their owners: The wealthiest 5 to 8 percent of pet owners, those
with college educations, annual household incomes in excess of
$70,000 and an expanding human diet of organic, locally grown and
luxury food products, will provide ever better, fresher and more
delicious food for their pets. The other 92 to 95 percent of pets
compose a second track that will consume increasingly industrialized
diets. Even today these diets commonly consist of byproducts cooked
into sterile and viscous masses, sheared into the simulacrum of a
bone or a patty, and then, according to a report by the National
Research Council in Washington, spray-dried with minuscule beadlets
of fat, protein and calibrated savor. Kind of like the industrial,
increasingly synthetic and processed diets of their owners.

Nestle's research for her next book, &quot;What Pets Eat,&quot; has also
brought to her attention the enormous numbers of emerging pet-food
companies. (&quot;I just met with this guy in Colorado who's doing a high-
end bison pet food,&quot; she says.) As these pet-food start-ups edge
their way into the market, many entrepreneurs appear to have
concluded that there must be a way to feed dogs and cats without
relying on the rendering industry, the surgical procedures of
academic research or the detritus of alternative-fuel manufacturing.
They have begun to speak of a pet-food revolution.

According to Nestle, the push to reform pet food is part of the
broader movement to transform the way human beings eat. The pet-food
movement &quot;is grass roots, and it is a combination of the so-called
good, clean, fair movement, the slow-food movement, the locally
grown movement and the farm-animal welfare movement. These social
movements are about changing the industrialized food system,&quot; she
says. The latest trends in pet food emphasize not only natural and
organic ingredients but also an increased obligation to identify the
precise origins of those ingredients. Nestle says, &quot;This will place
enormous pressure on standard industrialized pet-food companies to
say where their stuff comes from.&quot;

Typical of the grass-roots, slow-food, socially responsible pet-food
campaign are Miya Gowdy and Vivian Outlaw, who cooked 5,000 pounds
of dog food in Gowdy's TriBeCa loft last year. They simmered the
stews of their Righteous Dog Food brand on a four-burner stove top
that, when I visited a few months ago, sat amid Gowdy's collection
of her own abstract paintings, bookshelves stocked with back issues
of the Buddhist magazine Tricycle and an array of other companies'
pet-food packaging that ranged from Buddy Biscuits to Chompions
Super Premium Breakfast Formula. &quot;Our artistic proclivities have
made us perfectly suited to lead this revolution,&quot; Gowdy said. Her
intense painter's gaze beamed from behind horn-rimmed
glasses. &quot;Artists think in process.&quot;

Righteous Dog Food retails for $7.50 a pound, compared with around
$1 a pound for an inexpensive commercial brand. Gowdy and Outlaw
envision a time when they will sell 12,000 pounds of food each month
in the New York metropolitan area, enough to feed 600 dogs — and to
make a profit. For now, demand has outstripped the capacity of
Gowdy's General Electric range, so the partners have begun to
prepare their products at an industrial kitchen called Hudson Valley
Foodworks, in upstate New York. Righteous Dog Food shares the
kitchen's 25,000 square feet with 40 other food companies, among
them the makers of Hot Dog Charlie's Chili Meat Sauce and Spacey
Tracy's Sweet Sunshine Pickles. A company manufacturing dog
biscuits, which, like Righteous Dog Food, only uses human-grade
ingredients, has also joined the roster.

On the sweltering morning the partners invited me to visit their
operation, Gowdy and Outlaw planned on cooking two 500-pound batches
of a chicken recipe and one 500-pound batch of beef-based fare.
Eight cooks in clear plastic gloves and hairnets met them when the
partners walked into the plant at 8:30. The crew members cored
apples, chopped parsnips and chattered in Spanish while one of them
fiddled with a CD remote wrapped in cellophane. Soon, the sweet
chords of ranchera music joined the whirring, the grinding and the
sudden bangs and crashes.

In the back of the kitchen stood two massive stainless-steel steam
kettles of seething ingredients hooked up to a byzantine arrangement
of pipes, pressure valves and a variable-speed transmission. Sweat
dripped down the outside of each 150-gallon kettle, while inside
revolved the 14 teeth of the mixing blade. Unlike standard
industrial pet-food operations, the cooking processes of Righteous
Dog Food involved no gelatinizing, no solubilizations, no extrusion
and no spray coating. Nor did Righteous Dog Food rely on
computerized spreadsheets to measure its ingredients. On a table
next to a steam kettle sat a handwritten production chart: Take 24
quarts of chicken broth and add carrots and garlic (mix 10 minutes);
add potatoes and yams (mix 15 minutes); add rosemary and apples,
then pour in the bone meal and the raw eggs, the certified organic
alfalfa, the red rose hips and the nettles, the safflower and salmon
oils, the barley and the chicken meat, the burdock and the parsley,
the dandelion greens, the cilantro and the liquefied beef hearts.

A heavyset production manager named Mike Perez stood next to the
tanks and checked items off the ingredient list. A former truck
driver from Brooklyn, Perez went into the commercial baking business
in 2000, when he joined a friend who was producing a line of
cookies, brownies, blondies and biscotti. &quot;And now dog food,&quot; he
said. He beamed a searchlight into a steam kettle. &quot;I never thought
I'd be cooking dog food.&quot;

Perez poked a stainless-steel shovel into the simmering mixture and
extracted some tidbits. Gowdy crushed the vegetables with her
fingers and popped the gray mass into her mouth. She chewed, nodded,
smiled and invited the rest of us to try it. Perez ripped open a 50-
pound bag of organic rolled oats and shook his head. &quot;It's probably
too healthy for me,&quot; he said.

If you are what you eat, is it also true that you are what your pet
eats? Tim Phillips, the editor of Petfood Industry magazine, says
that animal owners tend to think so, and even more often they tend
to think, This is what I like, so my dog or cat must like the same
things. If a cat owner wants takeout, her cat can have takeout, too;
if she watches TV while she dines, her cat can have its own TV
dinner. Vegetarians offer their animals vegetarian meals, and if you
happen to be allergic to beef, perhaps your pet should eat only
kibble based on protein from rabbit, venison or kangaroo. Observant
Jewish pet owners may select Evanger's Super Premium Gold Dinners,
which have been certified kosher by the Chicago Rabbinical Council.
The dogs and cats of athletes crunch energy bars. &quot;It's a quasi
religion,&quot; Phillips says.

Whether religion, science or business, pet food is booming. Today
about a third of the animal-science graduate students studying at
the University of Illinois with George Fahey and other professors
devote themselves to nutrition, and according to Fahey the industry
brims with job opportunities for them. &quot;It's as good a time as ever
in the 30 years I've been doing this,&quot; he told me.

As we neared the end of Fahey's tour of the laboratories at Urbana-
Champaign, I wasn't exactly eager to see the animals in the basement
that had been mutilated for the sake of science — however much their
surgically attached plugs may have contributed to the research Fahey
and his colleagues had published on the digestibility of beet pulp
and citrus pulp, potato starch and wood cellulose. But there seemed
to be little choice. &quot;Let's go out and see the dogs,&quot; he said.

When we came to the Authorized Access sign, the professor swept his
electronic pass card over a pad, and the metal door swung
open. &quot;This is a very secure building,&quot; he said. Accompanied by one
of his lab technicians, we passed a set of bright red cattle gates,
then continued down a long corridor of pink portals, behind which
resided colonies of rats, rabbits, hens, swine and cats. We passed a
disease quarantine room and a chamber marked Surgery.

Fahey stopped at a green door. Another swipe of the pass card and we
stood before seven immaculate kennels, each of which held a short-
haired, mixed-breed hound. From the side of each hound emerged a
clear, plastic spout.

&quot;Hello, girls,&quot; Fahey said. They looked at him with calm, bright
eyes and wagged their tails.

Wiggles came up to us and sniffed my fingers. She had a wet nose and
sleek white fur. Above her black-barred kennel hung a plastic
clipboard marked with a number, courtesy of the U.S.D.A. &quot;We get
inspected,&quot; Fahey said.

Wiggles's sign read:
USDA #348643
Canine, Hound Mix, Female DOB 8/25/00
Received 8/28/01 Butler Farms
Dr. Fahey Protocol 06222

Protocol 06222 turned out to be a test of something called an
oligosaccharide. Fahey would not reveal the precise origin and
nature of this particular carbohydrate, but given his record it was
possible to imagine that the mystery molecule might one day turn up
in Iams dog food, or perhaps your seven-grain bread.

We inspected Wiggles's cage, then the cages of Bo, Teeny, Dutchess,
Flick, Shai and Todd. Every floor sparkled, every stainless-steel
feed bowl shone. The hounds were gentle and sociable, Fahey
said, &quot;ideal animals to work with.&quot;

The dogs appeared content within their temperature-controlled
environment, where the lights go on at 6 every morning and off at 8
every evening, where regulated supplies of air enter and exit the
ventilation system, where they can play with their toys and listen
to AM radio all day. Fahey said that the kennels exceeded federal
guidelines for size and that the lab assistants took the dogs
outside twice a week to exercise, romp and catch some rays. &quot;If you
had this much money spent on you, you'd be happy, too,&quot; he said.

&quot;They're spoiled brats,&quot; the lab technician said.

Of course, the installation of plastic plumbing into a living hound
did not seem much like spoiling. And in fact there was another way —
a more precise way — to determine how much energy a dog or a cat had
acquired from its food. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a
research method called &quot;total carcass analysis,&quot; which, as the name
implies, required the animal to be dead. &quot;You need to have a darned
good reason to do a terminal case,&quot; Fahey said to me earlier. &quot;It's
too expensive.&quot; And it is not for the squeamish. &quot;It's a helluva
job,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to grind, you have to sieve, you have to
grind again. It's a good technique, but it's very labor-intensive.&quot;
I cringed.

Now Fahey pointed to the spout sticking out of Wiggles's
side. &quot;There,&quot; he said. &quot;You see the cannula.&quot;

The plugs did not seem to irritate the dogs. &quot;If it is put in
correctly, it becomes part of them,&quot; he said. &quot;It heals very nicely,
and becomes a part of their anatomy.&quot; The ports must be opened and
inspected at least once a week and flushed at least once a month,
and when Fahey or his colleagues collect samples they simply unplug
a stopper, attach a plastic bag and let the dogs run around, which
pushes out the digesta.

As Fahey described the lab's procedures, the room grew quiet, and by
the end of his monologue the dogs sat in total silence, their eyes
plaintive. Clearly, they were begging, but begging for what? Perhaps
they expected to be fed. Perhaps they longed for an end to their
captivity. Fahey grinned and said nothing, but the moment we left
the room and shut the green metal door, it sounded as if some evil
doctor had begun to torture the poor animals. They howled and
blubbered and brayed and whined, and their pathetic ululations
followed us as we traced our way back down the yellow cinder-block
hallway, past the cattle gates, through the final door and out to
the light of a hot Midwestern afternoon.

&quot;What made them so upset?&quot; I asked.

&quot;They thought you were going to take them out to play,&quot; Fahey
said. &quot;Look what you did.&quot;

BRITAIN TO ALLOW HUMAN-ANIMAL EMBRYOS

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From correspondents in London, www.news.com.au
">

Sept 6 - BRITAIN'S fertility regulator decided in principle
overnight to allow scientists to create human-animal hybrid embryos
for research purposes, as experts downplayed ethical concerns.

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) gave the go-
ahead to controversial plans to create &quot;cytoplasmic&quot; embryos, which
merge a tiny bit of human DNA with eggs from animals such as cattle
or rabbits.

Scientists argue such research could pave the way for therapies for
diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

Applications to proceed with such work from researchers at Newcastle
University in northeast England and King's College London can now be
appraised by a license committee in November.

An HFEA consultation out earlier this week found people were &quot;at
ease&quot; with the proposals once the possible implications had been
explained.

An HFEA spokeswoman accepted public opinion was divided and said
their decision was a tough one to make.

&quot;This is not a total green light for hybrid research, but
recognition that this area of research can, with caution and careful
scrutiny, be permitted,&quot; she said.

Some experts backed the decision.

&quot;It does seem a little abhorrent at first analysis,&quot; said Newcastle
University's Doctor Lyle Armstrong, who helped to create the world's
first cloned human embryo in 2005.

&quot;But you have to understand we are using very, very little
information from the cow in order to do this reprogramming idea.

&quot;It's not our intention to create any bizarre cow-human hybrid, we
want to use those cells to understand how to make human stem cells
better.&quot;

But not everyone was so pleased.

Anthony Ozimic, secretary of the Society for the Protection of
Unborn Children, said the &quot;pro-life&quot; group deplored the decision.

&quot;This is not just a case of the 'yuk' factor - there are grave
ethical and moral objections.

&quot;All the evidence suggests that these embryos are essentially human.
Yet they will be cannibalised and killed for their stem-cells.

&quot;These embryos may have some human characteristics, and some animal
traits. No-one can say what ethical status they will have.&quot;

Archbishop of Cardiff Peter Smith also voiced concern.

&quot;The decision as to whether or not our society allows the creation
of part-human and part-animal creatures for scientific research is
of profound significance,&quot; he said.

&quot;The profound ethical question is: Is it right to transgress that
species boundary and attempt to mix human and animal natures in
however limited a fashion?&quot;

The research involves transferring nuclei containing DNA from human
cells to animal eggs that have had nearly all their genetic
information removed.

The resulting embryos are therefore mostly human, with a small
animal component. Stem cells, which can grow into different kinds of
tissue, are then formed.

The hybrids would only be allowed to survive to a very early stage
so that they can be studied for therapeutic purposes, the scientists
say, stressing that their goal is not to create a living animal.

The embryos could give researchers a large supply of stem cells to
work with.

Scientists have had to rely on human eggs left over from fertility
treatment, which are in short supply and often poor quality.
