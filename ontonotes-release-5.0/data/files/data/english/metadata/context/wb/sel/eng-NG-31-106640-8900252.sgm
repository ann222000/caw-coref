OK, excuse my ignorance, but I do nip lifted ac if that seems to be the
easiest way to go. Otherwise, I might use e-file or hand file. Am I
wrong to nip the lifted ac?

Coco,
If you are nipping STOP IT NOW before you get used to it. Nipping only
creates more lifting. You need to file out the lifted areas. Anyone who
still nips lifted product has not kept up with their education. Just like
Diana Bonn said--&quot;old school.&quot;
Just a side note here: Entity is the ONLY acrylic product I have ever used
that I have NO lifting with. Any other product had issues. It was not me. I
had the dreaded &quot;pocket lifting&quot; that was supposed to be from either too dry
or too wet--whatever the soup du jour was that day... If your prep is
correct, there should be no need for nipping or time wasted filing out
lifted product.
Now toss those nippers away!
buenos dias,
Lynnette

3!!! Time flies!)

&gt;Oh Coco, this is not ignorance, this is just taking control of lifting. Believe me when I first heard about the no nipping thing, I said there is no way that I am going to file and file and file when it is easier to just nip that burger.
">

But I was wrong and they were right.  Nipping does cause more lifting like Lynnette said, will see it in two weeks. Also maybe more greenies because when you pull the ac, might be a tiny area where moisture might sink in.

So as your clients come in, try not to nip. Go slowly because you will get frustrated. Work on the product application and knowing that you &quot;can't&quot; nip, makes you more aware of the product application and may solve your problems.

And saves time, floor cleanup, your eyes, your clients eyes, your cup of coffee and you only need one pair occasionally!!!!!!!LOLOLO diana from indiana

Lynnette,

THANX for the fantastic explanation. I guess Tammy Taylor is old school
now? I got that nipping tip from one of her DVDs or online video. I've
watched her Nine Most Popular Procedures yesterday, and I noticed that
she touches models' skin with the brush A LOT. By the end of ac
application, all her fingers looked pretty wet around the cuticle by
the brush touching skin. I don't think that can't be a good thing in a
long term; it might even cause overexposure. Also her ac beads are
pretty damn wet, and sometimes it kinda ran down and touched the
sidewalls and cuticles, it seems like. Granted, she can whip out full
sets in a record time, but I'm not comfortable touching skins and
making the skin wet like that. Am I too paranoid?

I also don't like the very shallow (almost straight) smileline. I
prefer deep smileline although it's still difficult for me to do well
right now. (I'm practicing.) Also what do u think about her method of
using a 100-grid file to roughen up the natural nails and then
proceeding with a pterygium stone to push the cuticle? Isn't it too
rough on natural nails?

She primes twice for better adhesion. isn't that old school too? Then
the second time she primes, she applies ac while the primer is still
wet. Again, doesn't it cause overexposure over time? I'd love to hear
your opinions on these....

If the application is done right, u shouldn't be needing to nip. I
think it sums up and make sense. (I'll practice more.)

you will find that you will have some clients that will need double priming. but you still have to let it dry before you apply the acrylic.

Coco,
I have 3 who I double prime.  Two are on Topamax and one is on hormones,
thyroid meds and blood pressure meds.  I did not know what else to do, and decided
to go with the double priming.  It works like a charm.

Coco,
First, let me tell you that I absolutely LOVE your enthusiasm. It is so
refreshing!
Okay, forget most of the stuff you see in the TT videos. You are correct to
not want to smear the product all over the skin. I can only imagine the skin
problems clients have with techs who do nails like that. She is fun to watch
and you may learn a thing or two, but be careful.
I do not think TT would be able to do a high smile line in her record time.
I do not like straight smile lines either. It screams chop shop!!!
I also have no need to double prime. I use Nu Bond and I do not even have
acid primer anymore. I think acid primer smells worse than monomer!!!
As for nippers--I never use them for product that has lifted. Never. Not
since I learned on here to file, which was MANY years ago!! Even if I get
chop shop MMA nails--- no, I just use me electric file and file away. That
is where the barrel bit comes out. (as much as I hate that bit--like Pati
said--dangerous!) Just the thought of putting nippers under product hurts
me! I just do not do it. EVER.
I do not use a rough grit file to prep the nails. Most of the time it is
just my cone bit that I use in the cuticle area that is good enough. For
first time full sets I use a fine grit LIGHTLY on the nails in a North to
South fashion after I go in a circular motion around the cuticle. There is
NO need to scratch the nails and ruin them to get the product to adhere. If
a company is still recommending that, then they need to look at how old
their ways and products are. It is time to reformulate for a better way. I
never want to hurt the natural nail.
You will get some other opinions on all of this. You have to do what is
right for you.
Oh, I also found a fantastic cuticle pusher/remover. I got it from Nailite.
It is BETTER than the Pusher Plus. For years I could not ever be without the
PP, but I found this and my clients are telling me that they like this
better than the PP. Here is the link for the one I am using:
http://www.nailiteinc.com/cgi-bin/nailite/nailite.cgi?ACTION=ENTER&amp;OR...;
It is the pterygium 2. I plan on getting a couple more. It takes a while to
adjust, but once you do, this is the one you will love!
buenos dias,
Lynnette

Coco,
Tammy  Taylor's system works with 2 coats of primer, second one a  finger at
a time wet as product is applied.  Every system has their  own way and
following the company recommendations gets you the most success. I  used TT for 10+
years and it was the best. During that time I tried other  systems and always
went back. I am using Entity now and don't believe that I  could ever go back
now.
The issue of getting it on the skin was/is always something that  should be
avoided at all costs. The only time I ever had anyone with  problems like over
exposure or allergic to products, they had come  from NSS shops to start with.
I on the other hand had serious problems when I  used CND Retention. Thought
my hands were going to rot and fall off.
The stone for pushing cuticles is ok but I use a pusher plus now.( Personal
preference). I was worried that the stone couldn't be sanitized enough.
As for the 100 grit file they advise only taking the shine off so that is a
soft touch with the file. The whole thing here is to make sure that there is
no  cuticle on the nail that you are about to apply acrylic to.
I went to several TT classes and seminars over the years and they always
teach the health of the natural nail is our most important issue.
You will over time see so many different products and ways of doing things,
you have to glean every good idea or technique and will settle into your own
way.  There will always be things that don't quite fit like slopping  monomer
on skin that you will toss out. That is the learning and experience  process.
You don't know how blessed that you are to have this list and  message
boards. The rest of us flew by the seat of our pants in the beginning,  with no one
to ask. And we are still learning.  Good luck and keep the  questions coming.

Went to West Coast today and bought Let's Go Super Fast Glue Dry. Read
the direction and still doesn't get it. How exactly do u apply the
spray? I'm guessing u blush on glue (Entity Fuse) on client's nail
tip/free edge, spray the glue dry (Let's Go), and then put the tip on
the nail?

I'm tired of waiting around 10 sec each to glue on tips, and I'm hoping
this will speed things up a bit.

this will speed things up a bit.

Coco,
I spray the nail with the Let's Go/Hurry Up and put the Fuse on the tip.
Then apply the tip on the nail.
If you put the glue on the tip and spray the tip, you have just cured the
glue!!
Also, if you happen to get migraines, make sure you have a towel to cover
your nose when you spray this if you have a headache when using it. OMG....
it is awful.
buenos dias,
Lynnette

&gt; Went to West Coast today and bought Let's Go Super Fast Glue Dry. Read
&gt; the direction and still doesn't get it. How exactly do u apply the
&gt; spray? I'm guessing u blush on glue (Entity Fuse) on client's nail
&gt; tip/free edge, spray the glue dry (Let's Go), and then put the tip on
&gt; the nail?

I use the Hurry Up with the Entity tips. You have to be careful how much
glue you use with the Entity tips. Too much will melt the tip. :-(

COCO,

SO is FUSE like any other nail glue, I know sometimes when I have a old bottle of 5 sec. nail glue it gets a sticky residue hope you know what I'm talking about it sticks but takes a long time to stick solid, so if I spray hurry up then apply the glue then the tip it will stick instantly? I know with cheap glues they don't dry in an instant so this will work as well! Yes it smells YUCKY the HURRY UP to me like ROACH SPRAY I warn my clients if I go to spray when I fix a crack on natural nails to turn there head.

Jacki,
I think the Fuse is better than any other nail glue I have used for the simple fact that it does not gunk up at the base and then refuse to open! I have wasted more money on brush on glues that stick and then cannot open!!! Fuse does not do this!
Like you, I say bug spray, too. And the Backscratchers one--- it was bug spray with a dusting of baby powder!!! lol...
buenos dias,
Lynnette

That is what I thought!  The white tips can be a bit tricky.  Lynette's
suggestion is perfect for you.  Generally the white tips won't glue down if
you are using too much adhesive. With the Fuse, a little goes a long way.
Try putting the Fuse on the clients nail instead of on the tip.  This will
help.  You just need to moisten the nail with the adhesive!  :)

But right now, I need to use them up for practice as i'm not making any

LOL Actually, I have those same thoughts on white tips!!!!  I do have them.
When do I use them?  When a client is 20 minutes late for a full set of pink
and whites!  LOL  That is the only time  I can think of in the past 8  years
that I have used white tips.  They are great for those one time full sets
though, you know Prom, weddings, that type of stuff.  So they are always
nice to have on hand.

Yes, Tammy is old school. BUT she has a LOT of great info
and education if you're are able to sift the &quot;old school&quot;
from the good info.

I use TT product and try to use her method as much as comes
in handy for me, it really does improve your speed.

Just don't be sloppy and keep the product off the
sidewalls.

As for nipping-- yeah, we are NOT nipping anymore! Every
once in a while I have someone come in with the kind of
lifting where the ac is basically just stuck to the free
edge of the nail-- I get out the nippers and &quot;tsk tsk&quot; my
clients, saying, &quot;I can't believe you're making me get my

If my client has lifting issues I will prime twice.  Tammy Taylor's products
might be made to use on wet primer.  I use NSI's Attraction and really like
it.  I work it a bit wet, but don't get it on my client's cuticles if I can help
it.  Every system is a bit different, but you should avoid getting product on
your client's skin as much as possible because of the sensitivity issue.  I
too like a deep smile line and it does take alot of practice.

That's my 2 cents worth on this one, LOL.

Yes, all the time.  Usually I'll use white tips and then apply white AC over
them.  Sounds like cheating, but the white tips are thicker and stronger if
your client is hard on her nails or types alot or is a cashier.

I had my spa pedi done at a very nice day spa today. Every time i get a
pedi done, i learn something new: both something good to do or
something shouldn't be done. Today I paid $35 1-hr spa pedi done at a
very nice day spa (plus $7 tip on top of it). Angela, my nail tech with
2 years of experience, was very personable, but her polish application
was much to be desired. They had a cozy small pedi room in a victorian
house where u can get all your beauty needs met: hair, nail, facial,
and massage. She admitted that she is not very artistic and can't draw.
So she used that Konad nail stamping kit to stamp me a couple of
butterflies on my big thumbnails. I've been contemplating on whether I
should buy that kit or not for a few months. It was quick and
butterflies are beautiful. I'm now convinced that I need to get that
kit! it's around $300, and it's worth it. If they are at Nailpro in
October, I'm going to get it!

Coco,

Here is my opinion on the Konad thing, which I bought a smaller kit for less
than $50 in Vegas in a MALL!  It is useless to me.  Unless you are applying
the design to a bare nail or a nail that has CURED polish on it, you can't
use it, the stamper destroys the polish job or totally removes it from the
nail.

You would be better off purchasing a $2 brush and 88 cent paints at WalMart
and painting it on by hand.  This sets you apart from the other salons
providing &quot;cookie cutter&quot; designs like this.

Again, this is just my opinion, but that $50 kit was a waste of money.

Rhonda

put the white back on, and then if your not careful when filing the tip could

Genie,

You can either backfill a set of white tips and do a traditional backfill or
you can do a retip, where you remove the old white tip, thin the end, apply
a new white tip, overlay white tip with clear and fill regrowth with pink.
A number of people do this daily!

Genie,

I must say I agree. even if you use a French/white tip.. ultimately, you
are going to do a backfill/white fill on them anyway.  It has been my
experience that the white tips are NOT thicker.. and if anything.
weaker!  Of course, I have been using CND white French tips.. but.and it
could just be their product.

However, the only time I use white tips is if I am doing a temporary
nail not meant to ever be filled in anyways.  That speeds up your temp
nail sets quite a bit. although. I can sculpt a set of temps out of AC
in a little under an hour.. so, for me, its 6 of one-half dozen of the
other.  So.. I am getting away from white tips altogether now.. unless
someone wants a temp set of gels. which, usually I do not recommend
because at least you can soak off AC when they start coming off.

Love your signature joke in your emails! Haha! That is tooooo funny!

Genie, it actually takes no more time than a backfill.  I can do a retip or
a backfill in under an hour.  It is good to offer for your clients that
refuse to wear gloves and use oil and constantly curl at the free edge.
Repairing that every appointment is what takes too much time for me.

ok, i'll spend my hard-saved $ for something more useful. and keep
practicing on hand painting and airbrushing as well as cutting nice
smile lines with my brush instead of various metal instruments out
there no matter how tempting that is....

Coco,
I don't do acrylics, but that tool looks like it would be a challenge to use
without disturbing the white you just laid down.  You could probably use it
effectively with practice, but I think you are right...better to practice
free hand.   Personally, its more gratifying to me when I learn to master
something freehand.   I hear that Dashing Diva has some sort of machine that
paints on good designs.  I think they have an exclusive on it though and you
can only get a one if your are a DD franchisee.  It probably costs an arm
and leg!
