Huge Update On The Future Of Undertaker
07/09/2007 by Ryan Gray

Source - Wrestling Observer Newsletter

Mark Calaway (a/k/a Undertaker) just finished building a $2.7 million office
building in Loveland, Colorado along with his business partner, Scott
Everhart. The two have named the building The Calahart (Calaway &amp; Everhart)
Building, which is filled with upscale office space with a great location.

Undertaker is scheduled to return to wrestling in November, but is getting
into real estate since he knows his wrestling career isn't going to last
much longer. Calaway said that being a star on TV is something that will
help him with his future business. He was quoted as saying, &quot;by no means
does it seal the deal, but people do want to sit down and talk with you. It
helps us get to meet a lot of people and know what we're trying to get
accomplished.&quot;

WTF?  A wrestler investing his money wisely rather then blowing it on
drugs and hookers?  That's bullshit.  Undertaker must be one of those
greedy asshole republicans.

A man that had a good run in wrestling... and probably made good
investments. I wish
him well in whatever he does when he finally retires.
