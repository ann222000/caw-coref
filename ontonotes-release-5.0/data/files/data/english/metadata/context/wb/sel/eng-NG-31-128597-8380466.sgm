Hi Everyone
If anyone has an time to donate it would be much appreciated. This
year's conference looks excellent!

Subject: OSDC volunteers: photos, Brisbane info, shirts, bags, etc.

(please feel free to forward this to any local list you may deem
relevant -
for gigs that involve dealing with local providers of services, people
based around Brisbane would be preferred.)

Hi everybody,

As you might have read, the OSDC 2007 CfP yielded over 100 proposals
and
the program committee has been busy wading through it all. No
confirmations
yet, there's a lot of work there. Andrae has got his job cut out for
him!

In the coming months, there's a lot more that needs doing, and we're
looking to you for these tasks. If you want to volunteer of any of
these,
please write to me!

- high-res photos of the Bris skyline, city botanical gardens, other
general images
(URGENT - we have an offer to get some free printed advertising in
magazines)
Photos can also be used on the website, and naturally the
photographer
gets credited!

- Brisbane info... a general story on Bris, the area around the
conference
venue, alternative places to stay, places to eat, things to do before/
after
the conference, etc. For an idea on this, see the 2006 site (link on
the
left bar from 2007 site) which has info about Melbourne. So, if you
reckon
you can do some research and write this up (augmented by photos from
the
prior point) that would be grand.

- People to handle the conference bags, shirts and other things.
There are
ideas and known sources and in some cases quotes. You will need to
research
vendors based on this, get more quotes/samples, and follow through to
the
final delivery within our needed timeframe.
We'd prefer different people for each of these items, so you can focus
on
the one vendor in the end and see it through to completion.

- People with desktop publishing skills. The conference book will
need
assembling. You will need to be able to use Acrobat to merge PDFs and
do
other layout stuff. James Iseppi has offered QUT facilities (Macs with
Acrobat and other graphical tools) if necessary. This gig would also
involve dealing with a printing company, although that could be made a
separate task for another person.

- The existing web site is fairly simple, and uses some server-side
includes. If you reckon you can do some additional magic with it,
please
feel free to volunteer. Functional is more important than fancier
though...
it's a live site, with program and earlybird registrations before too
long.

- If you want to volunteer for something else specifically, please
drop me
a note!

Please note that although all of OSDC is a volunteer effort, it's
serious
stuff. If you take it on, you need to put in the effort and time and
work
with the others to make things happen. Everybody will be relying on
you.
With an event such as this, there are various things dependent on
others,
so deadlines are a necessity. For instance, if the conference bags
aren't
ready, they can't be &quot;stuffed&quot;. You get the idea.
You are not left on your own, but you'll have taken responsibility for
the
task and this it's considered &quot;done&quot;. They're all responsible jobs.

Thanks all!
On behalf of the OSDC 2007 organising gang,
Arjen.
