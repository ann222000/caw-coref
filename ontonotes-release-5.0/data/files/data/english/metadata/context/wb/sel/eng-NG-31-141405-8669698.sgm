USB 3 due from about 2009 on
Amongst it's many other capabilities it should utterly transform data
transfer rates to/from Flash memory cards.

http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=BUHGC...

&quot;SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — Intel Corp. announced it is working with
a handful of companies on a specification that could push the USB's
theoretical throughput beyond 4 Gbits/second, ten times its current
rate. The USB 3.0 spec aims to deliver 300 Mbytes/second of usable
data at the applications level and add new quality of service
capabilities that could challenge the 1394 interconnect also known as
Firewire.  ...

much more.

Apparently not. USB OTG is a supplement to USB 2.0.

I believe in Intel. Apple will switch to USB 3 once it is popular
in the Windows PC world. And it will once Intel comes out
chipsets with USB 3. AMD, Via and SIS will follow soon. And since
Apple is now using Intel CPUs and chipsets, Apple will have to
support USB 3 later.

Firewire might still survive in the consumer electronics
world.

Firewire is dead, Apple killed it when they changed to USB only on the iPod.
(FireWire never was a roaring success anyway (royalties))

Sure, it'll continue on in it's own little niche, maybe one day you be able
to connect your DAT to MiniDisc via Firewire.

I'm trying to remember the timing - I think USB came out first, with FireWire following very shortly afterwards, and being 30-odd times faster it was the winner on
performance until USB2 came out.  I have some Iomega &quot;Peerless&quot; drives (20GB removeable cartridges) which have interchangeable bases with Firewire or USB1 in
them, so they were obviously designed in the interim time, perhaps around the turn of the millenium?  These drives fly using FireWire, and dawdle using USB,
obviously, and it's sad that the product line was discontinued without them producing a USB2 base.  I don't know why they discontinued them - the cartridges are
basically a 2.5&quot; disk drive in a box, so there's no reason I can see why they couldn't have updated them by fitting larger capacity disks.  A 160GB removeable
cartridge system with USB2 would have been incredibly useful!

Firewire is a much &quot;nicer&quot; standard, IMHO, first for its performance, which is at least as good as USB2 despite the difference in headline speeds, and secondly
because it has daisy-chaining as standard so you only need one port on the machine and everything can hang from it.  And thirdly because there isn't this ludicrous
thing where Windows loads another set of drivers every time you plug it in in a way that's different from previously!  It just feels more like a proper standard,
rather than something where manufacturers (the cheap ones, anyway) get their product to the point where it just works on test, and stop developing there.  Hence
some products that only work when plugged straight into the machine, not via a hub, or draw more power than is allowed and hope that the machine is kind to
them, or the thing where you *must* load the manufacturer's drivers before plugging in the device, or else Windoze loads an incompatible driver which you then
have to jump through hoops to remove (ICD2, anyone? :-)

FireWire &quot;just works&quot;!

I wonder what USB3 would be used for?  External disks are already availble with SATA connectors, so I don't see the need for a faster interface there, and I can't
think of anything else that would need speeds above USB2 that doesn't already have a standard (Gigabit Ethernet, for example).

This does not really matter. A lot of the better standard just died
because of cost. Firewire is still more expensive.

USB standard puts a lot of burden to the developers and there
are many &quot;half-working&quot; USB devices. Many of them might work
under Windows but will not work under Linux or Mac. However USB
is still very popular than other connectivity solutions for PC.

USB is easier for the enduser than many other standards. And

I don't know if you can label removing firewire from the iPod as the

digital camcorders still use firewire, and it remains the interface with
less problems when trying to transfer video from a camcorder to a

That said, I do agree that firewire has no future beyond that. TTYL

I am always very worried when someone says &quot;what will this new thing be
used for&quot;. If you build it...

As for right now, what would USB3 be good for? Tons of stuff IMHO.
External storage is the big one, yes SATA is there, but you forget that
backwards compatibility has been a LARGE part of the success of many
things in the computer world.

As a manufacturer, what would you choose to include on your external
harddrive: a SATA port, that a consumer MIGHT have, or a USB3 port,
which while a consumer might not have a USB3 port, they pretty much are
guaranteed to have a USB2 port.

Ignoring that, yes, SATA is good for external storage, but what about
other high bandwidth things? What about uncompressed HD streams from
video capture hardware, or HD camcorders? A 1080i uncompressed stream
needs about: 1920x1080x1.3x30x3 ~= 240MB/s, the 4Gbps being discussed
all of a sudden doesn't seem fast enough any more if you consider that
1080i is pretty low if you look a few years in the future. 1080p is
already here, deep colour is coming, and I'm sure a newer higher res HD
standard isn't far off.

You mention gigabit ethernet, what about wireless ethernet adapters?
Current wireless standards are already in the ~300Mbps range, in a few
years time?

What about remote displays? That a technology with SO many uses, but has
been held back by interface technologies. Imagine having a computer
monitor with a USB3.0 interface. Need a second (or third, or fourth)
display but your video card doesn't have it? Just plug in your USB3
monitor. Heck, for many people who only do desktop stuff, why even have
a video card? Just boot up with a USB3.0 monitor?

And then, there are all the other apps that you or I haven't thought of,
that will appear when higher bandwidth options come available. Just
remember, around 10 years ago external hard drives were extremely
expensive and rare (SCSI based) before USB became big.

USB just works too.  Well, almost usually for almost all people.  Almost
good enough, really.  One day I shall succeed in installing a USB2 card and
actually having it work, and not swear at the 'ya know, if you plug it into
you USB2 port, it'll work faster' message.

Yeah, Firewire is nicer, but USB is cheaper and more widespread.  Sometimes
it's easier to start at the bottom and work up.  After all, how many USB
keyboards &amp; mice are there?  Doesn't help that Firewire has two different
plugs either.  I'd say Firewire is on about 1 in 3 machines these days.

Speed wasn't much of an issue, most devices (thumbdrives, cameras, MP3 etc)
didn't have much memory, so it didn't take long to transfer anyway.  Ok,
USB1 CD-ROMs &amp; DVDs sucked, but hardly anyone (nerds don't count) did that.

USB3 will be used on the same stuff we have today (just faster).  Your
webcam will do 60FPS, and your 500GB iPod won't take 'like just ages' to
copy to like it does on USB2.  All of those things that are currently
Firewire (camcorders etc) will switch to USB3.

The other standards typically do not:
* Provide power to the device
* Truly support plug and play
* Support all the various transfer modes (isochronous, bulk, etc)
* Support On the Go functionality - you can't hook two SATA devices
together and make a backup.  If you do this with ethernet you need a
special cable or adaptor, and will probably have to configure the
network yourself.

Further, would you rather have 20 ports of 5 different types on your
computer (probably in the back) and have to match the right peripheral
to the right port?  What if the intended port is full, do you unplug
something, add another card, or drop another port expander (if the
interface supports that) onto your already crowded desk?

In fact, if USB can do the things those other interfaces accomplish,
wouldn't you simply rather have one type of port on the computer which
supports pretty much anything you could want to plug in?

The reasons for faster transfer speed are obvious for existing
applications.  I have a 4GB CF card for my camera, and I'd like it to
download all my pictures faster than it now does.

But there are lots of applications you may not have considered simply
because 1) it's not available now and 2) _you_ wouldn't need it...
until you saw it

For instance, I expect to see high performance video cards plugging
into such a port.  Right now peripheral manufacturers have to sell
them to OEMs to install, or convince the end user to perform the
install.  On this list that isn't a problem, but for 80% of the
computer owning population they don't ever want to open up their
computer.  There are many products in this category.

In fact, I expect to see monitors come out that only attach to this
connector, and include high performance graphics engines.  Need
another monitor?  Don't count the number of monitor ports, just buy
one and plug it in, including the latest huge, high resolution
displays.  People don't want to worry about whether their graphics
card is dual link capable, they just want to buy a 30&quot; display and
plug it in.  This will become more of an issue as even the &quot;small and
cheap&quot; monitors become 1080p compatible and beyond.

High performance computing clusters come closer to home every year.
One might choose, for instance, to buy a computer and drop it on top
of their old one.  Plug the two together with such a fast connection
and you can treat it essentially like a single multi-core computer.
This is already something done for graphics cards in SLI
configurations, but imagine having a connection fast enough that
rather than upgrading your computer so you can do video work quickly,
you simply buy a video coprocessor to do your movie manipulation and
encoding at 10-100x realtime.  And you don't have to even move your
computer - just plug it in and go.  Although it'll require a separate
power supply - there's only so much you can do with 2.5W!

But I think that the ultimate useful reason is simply media transfer.
Soon 1080p camcorders will be on the prosumer market, and even with
MPEG4 you're looking at transferring 50GBytes for a clip.  No one
really wants to wait 13 minutes (best case USB2.0) to transfer that to
their computer.  When you start seeing that 1TB drives are common, and
10TB drives are readily available, you'll be wondering where this spec
is.

Firewire isn't suitable for common, cheap hardware - such as mice and
keyboards.  Primarily due to cost, I suspect.  There's a big
difference between 1 million royalty free keyboards and one million
royalty-to-apple-for-creating-firewire keyboards.  I don't think Apple
ever pushed it for that anyway - they use USB for keyboards now, did
they still use ADB when the first firewire ports came out standard on
Macs?

So no, firewire was never pushed.  It made great inroads into video
production, and early on external hard drives, but the cost difference
is still there.  The keyboard and mouse thing really shoved USB onto
every system everywhere.

One main reason firewire succeeds in video production is due to native
driver support for it.  You can put a firewire video port on a cable
box and just expect it to work - no drivers, or at least no
manufacturer specific drivers.

USB has a limited selection of standard protocols, and due to
extensions and conflicts with desired operation one almost always has
to load a driver.  Mass storage and most HID (keyboards, mice) are the
biggest exceptions.

So, in essence, firewire includes more pieces of the software stack
(some in hardware) as standard, while USB requires more driver
software.

Of course software is cheaper to mass produce than hardware, so USB
was ahead of the game on cost even without the royalty free advantage.

&gt; &gt; Firewire is dead, Apple killed it when they changed to USB

&gt; &gt; (FireWire never was a roaring success anyway (royalties))

&gt; I don't know if you can label removing firewire from the iPod
&gt; as the death of firewire. Firewire IMHO is not dead, but it
&gt; is dying. Many digital camcorders still use firewire, and it
&gt; remains the interface with less problems when trying to
&gt; transfer video from a camcorder to a computer.

&gt; That said, I do agree that firewire has no future beyond that. TTYL

Don't push your own spec on your flagship product?  Sounds like dead to me.

If Apple couldn't be bothered to push Firewire, why would anyone else?  It
could have been like the old days, instead of 'buy a scanner &amp; get a SCSI
card', you'd have 'buy an iPod and get a Firewire card'.

Firewire was always a 'high-end' product, USB was cheap &amp; nasty.  Now USB is
cheap &amp; nasty &amp; fast.

USB3 will take the camcorders, etc away from Firewire.  A lot of things have
an optical out these days, I wonder if USB3 will be compatible with that...

I'll believe it when I see it.  You start talking video products like
camcorders and you're talking about an awful lot of legacy product in
areas where two-year product lifetimes are not acceptable.

Or, look at it this way: USB2 was supposed to obviate the need for
firewire, and yet today I see many more computers ship with built-in
firewire support than ever before (as part of their multimedia support.)
I can see USB3 replacing SATA for external drives, but I can't really
see it replacing firewire.

They note that it will handle parallel streams.
At present flash memory cards are getting painfully slow to download.
At present its the memory speed that dictates this but with &quot;300X&quot; SD
cards in the works it won't be long before its interface limited.

I presently use 2 GB and 4 GB cards for my cameras. 8 GB are dearer
per GB and I don't want to risk too many photos on one card and the
download time is too long.  But if they placed multiple eg 1 GB chips
on one card (or one chip with true multiple access) and accessed them
in parallel with multiple streams, then we could see a 16 GB card
downloading in a minute or two.

I am presently more concerned about write speeds than read speeds so
at present the IC write speed is a limiting factor.

Macs got USB as standard before they got firewire as standard.

At the time USB was a lowish speed perhiperal bus, firewire was a high
speed perhipheral/video/networking bus. However USB-2 took over for
perhipherals due to cost reasons and 1000BASE-T took over for high speed
networking (firewire was always a pain to use for networking because you
couldn't use hugely long homemade cables)

You're right.  I expect to see low performance video cards plugging
into USB3 ports.  We've got _really_ low performance USB2.0 video
adaptors now, but at these speeds reasonable gaming and 3D would be
feasible.

But they only just announced it.  We won't see them as a regular
feature on most new computers for another 3-5 years.

I dunno.  I thought the current USB2 was pretty far from being
the limiting factor.  A disk-to-samedisk copy of a 10GB photo
subdirectory took 13+ minutes on my old-but-not ancient Mac,
for instance (hmm.  about 6 minutes thereafter for a
disk-to-otherdisk copy, but who knows what was cached by then.)

SATA-2 disks and a faster CPU/Bus might improve that, but it's
pretty clear that MERELY a faster version of USB wouldn't give
me the sort of transfer times you are looking for.

allowing card connectors to overhang the back of the slot.

I do not play games either. But the voice of those people who
love gaming is quite loud and is what Nvidia/ATI(now AMD) likes to
hear. And the popular websites like Tom's Hardware and Anandtech
still compare graphics cards based on gaming performance. I
still follow their articles from time to time.

Soundcard is a different story, many gamers do not really care
about sound. So Creative is not doing well since the core sound
card business is quite small now.

For professional CAD users, graphics cards are important. Software
like ProE is really intensive. So does those in the creative industry
like digital media content creation.

As I said, Firewire will stay in its little niche, and that will probably be

they'll buy the USB version.  Firewhat?

Gamers, programmers &amp; stock brokers for multi-monitor.  Possibly graphics
people, but I've never seen it.  They all seem to like bigger screens.

I'll take multi-monitor (I have 3) over a bigger screen any day.  I use the
on-board video, plus a dual-head card.  Screen 3 is also on a KVM, so I can
plug someone else's box in.

I don't need a cutting edge video card for my screens (an IDE doesn't have
all that many polygons) so even a USB one would work.  I've occasionally
used a TV as a secondary screen.

There are already assorted such &quot;niche&quot; adaptors that allow a second
monitor to operate over ethernet, USB, and perhaps other media.  They're
apparently quite adequate for &quot;moderate&quot; graphics activity (KDE

Xiaofan the problem is that you have an ATI card and you're trying to
use it in Linux! The drivers are notoriously bad. AMD just announced
that they're going to open the spec. for the ATI cards, so it may get
better in 6 months - 1 year. I just bought a new nvidia card and I'm
amazed by what it can do in linux.

While it sounds funny, I think there might be differences between several
serial busses in parallel and a parallel bus. One could be that the signal
lines on a parallel bus are synced with each other, whereas the several
parallel serial busses not necessarily are.

&gt; There is obviously some meaning of the word &quot;Serial&quot; with which I've been previously unfamiliar!  :-)
">

Actually a &quot;parallel-serial&quot; type of config is becoming very common
these days.

PCIE is basically this, each lane is a seperate serial channel, so
multiple lanes become parallel serial links.

This even extends to broadband internet, the most common methods these
days virtually split the spectrum into hundreds or even thousands of
seperate serial &quot;channels&quot; running in parallel.

The ATI9800SE graphic card works fine for me. I do not use the

I got the ones from nvidia and installed them but the whole thing was so

Actually the performance impact seems to be pretty minimal if you don't
pick insane &quot;animations&quot; All the heavy lifting is offloaded to the GPU
which is otherwise just sitting there chewing power. In some cases it
seems to improve performance. On my friends P4 1.2Ghz it made it seem
much &quot;snappier&quot; and the response you get when other people see the cube
or a &quot;burn&quot; minimize (which really isn't CPU friendly ;-&gt;) makes it
worth it. If you want to impress a client with your geekary compiz is
the way to do it (incidentally flipping desktops while you get that
&quot;Impress&quot; sideshow ready).

Ah similar experience with Ubuntu 6.06 64bit. It was not too bad
overall but just too troublesome to get some of the things to work.
So I went back to Ubuntu 6.06 32bit and it is still my main Linux
distribution to use. I have installed 7.04 but not used it so extensively.
Now I am using 7.04 because I want to diagnose the problem with
PICDEM FS USB bootloader. It is not working with the stock
kernel.
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=1189786321l....

So I build a vanilla kernel 2.6.22.7 with USB debugging on.
It is still not working. Probably I will ask in the linux-usb-user or
linux-usb-devel list. Alan Stern and Greg KH are quite helpful there.

This is highly dependent on the API and underlying protocol used for
the graphics.  Using project Athena type systems it would work quite
nicely to be blunt (X is an existing standard but I doubt anyone would
have the forethought or the insite to use something that exists and
works quite well when you can reinvent a wheel and create 'new
technology' that you can sell).  If you don't know what I'm referring
to try this http://www.x.org/wiki/ . The X protocol works well with low
or high bandwidth and with compression added on is quite impressive. It
worked fine on 10mbit heavily loaded Ethernet systems 15-18 years ago
when work stations were being connected to super computers and
'powerful' systems that current desktop systems now easily rival.

This just requires some mild effort in design to make a decent X server
for the other end of the USB cable.  In this case the Windows GDI calls
could be translated into X tokens and calls compressed and transmitted
across USB (heck full speed USB would work just fine instead of
480mbps). A lowly ARM9T processor with some DDRAM NAND flash and an LCD
interface would be quite sufficient to create X server attached
directly to a monitor. Need multiple monitors?  Have a bit of software
to split things up and the OS wouldn't be the wiser. X was SPECIFICALLY
designed for the application that's being discussed. However Microsoft
continues to reinvent wheels (think thin clients) when it comes to
graphics API's etc.  I find there use of technology rather pathetic
(Microsoft that is) considering these problems were considered in depth
almost 20 years ago.

There is an old saying &quot;There is nothing new under the sun&quot;.

Some references for multiprocessing OpenGL API information.
http://chromium.sourceforge.net/

Tungsten Graphics
http://www.tungstengraphics.com/services.htm
http://www.tungstengraphics.com/chromium/siframes.htm

This company is rather interesting I think the person who made MESA
In summary most if not all these concerns about turn around time for 3d
and 2d applications across USB are a tad unfounded, as technology has
long ago (say 10 or 15 years ago) been developed to deal with this
problem. Say thank you to Silicon Graphics and MIT already having done
all the pioneering work in 2d and more recently in 3d chromium has been
addressing this.

See
http://www.tungstengraphics.com/chromium/chromium.html
for a very interesting discussion of 2d and 3d API parallelism across
multiple processing elements. This all in existence while USB 2.0 spec
was being hammered out.

I remember discussing with my college professor 20 years ago about
using hardware for 3d acceleration and his words were &quot;You don't think
they were wanting to do the same when they came up with many of the
software algorithms for 3d graphics do you?&quot; He said this with a grin.
Something to consider is that these ideas are definitely NOT NEW and
someone already has thought of the solution long before the problem
needed to be addressed today.

Adapt improvise and over come. I don't see any of these actually being
a real technical problem to solve considering software has already been
written to address these. However in reality we all want to make the
next wheel it's our nature to make something 'ours' (I've done it so I
should know a bit about reinventing a wheel, just think you repeat ALL
the same mistakes they did before you as well).

To me their major problem in MP3 is not getting the right
industrial design people and they were too ambitious to take on Apple.

On the soundcard front, they are still dominate but the market is
too small.

As a company, Creative is too conservative and lack of foresight. If they
bought Nvidia last time (Creative was one of the major graphics card
vendor last time), either Nvidia would die (probably the case) or
Creative would dominate the discrete graphics card market along
with ATI/AMD.

By the way, the latest Creative MP3 players are not bad but it
is already too little and too late.

Thanks for the education. My maths is very good but my 3D imagination

engineering graphics) so I am not that into 3D graphics. But you are
certainly right that X is nice. Open GL is nice as well. But I hear
from my brother Direct X is not bad either for graphics.

But I have reservations about think clients. PC is still better
than thin clients IMHO. And PCs can be &quot;thinner&quot; than &quot;thin&quot; clients
in terms of cost...

I do not want to compile a kernel if I can. And in most cases I do

However in this case, I intend to ask the question in the linux-usb-devel

build the latest vanilla kernel and turn on USB Debug as well as build
usbmon as a module. By default these options are not on.

I do not know about Mr Sim's good deeds. But I know that many
engineers left Creative headquarter in Singapore last year and this year
due to several years of lack of promotion and salary increment. As a
direct result, I do not have much concerns of Creative now...

Back in year1998-2000, Creative employees enjoyed generous bonus and
stock options. After that, things became from bad to worse. Now they seem
to recover a bit. The bulk of the revenue is now from MP3 players.
I believe that this section is still losing money but I am not sure. I hear that
the speaker business is doing fine. The soundcard business is still
generating good returns but the revenue will continue to go down.
