From
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/01/01/bc.fbn.bronc... :

'Anthony Criss, Williams' high school football coach in Fort Worth, Texas,
spoke with the cornerback often, and as recently as two weeks ago.

' "When he was younger, he always gravitated to the wrong crowd," Criss
said. "I remember he went to church and the minister was talking to him ..."
'

Yupper, sounds like the wrong crowd for sure.
