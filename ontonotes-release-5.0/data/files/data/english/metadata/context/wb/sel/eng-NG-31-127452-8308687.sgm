Shame so many find nature inconvenient

For the past year, my family and I have been regular visitors to the
Buatong waterfall and Buatong Lae Namphu Chet Si forest park, which
lie in the wooded hills that surround our hometown of Chiang Mai. My
two young daughters love the short walk through the trees to the
spring, which reflects the beautiful colours of the fern fronds and
trees that fringe the bubbling waters.

A rustic notice board describes the legend of a princess who once
sought refuge in this magnificent forest, and how pure water sprang
from the seven-coloured fountain to quench her royal thirst. Well, not
any more!

This afternoon, we were dismayed to find that the trees that used to
shade the spring have been removed. The leafy ferns that surrounded
the once clear pool have been dug up and garden flowers have been
planted in their place. The entire area surrounding the seven-coloured
fountain has been cleared and fenced. What used to be a unique and
beautiful forest spring is now a monochrome pool in a muddy field.

My six-year-old daughter asked me who had taken all the trees away,
and so we went in search of answers. At the office of the National
Park Service, an attendant politely explained that the area had been
tidied up in order to make it more appealing to tour groups from
Bangkok, who had apparently complained about the inconvenience caused
by such a large number of trees in the forest.

May I respectfully suggest that if visitors from Bangkok (or anywhere
else) do not wish to see so many trees, that they keep away from
wooded areas?

It saddens me to see the senseless destruction of such a beautiful
place by the very people who are responsible for its protection. I
fear for the future of Thailand's natural treasures, which seem to be
disappearing rapidly for the sake of convenience and profit.

If things are as Martin states this is clearly stupidity of the
highest order.
After having seen what has been achieved in Europe, HM the Queen spent
much of her birthday address pleading for the preservation of forests
and waterways in LOS. The morons responsible for this particular piece
of environmental vandalism should be taken to the palace and made to
explain their actions and be given a right royal tongue lashing.

Hi  Geoff !

A real case of &quot;can't see the wood for the trees&quot; perhaps?

But it's reassuring that rank stupidity and local government
corruption aren't just confined to my local government. A few years
ago my council cut down a complete row of mature poplar trees so that
residents in a new expensive housing estate could glimpse the Thames.
(Needless to say certain council members had financial interests in
the estate) The trees were originally planted to hide the site from
people enjoying the river bank gardens!

Some places take this sort of vandalism very seriously.  In Australia
a year or so ago a man was fined $AU180,000 for cutting 50 trees down
without permission and those trees were on his own property!
