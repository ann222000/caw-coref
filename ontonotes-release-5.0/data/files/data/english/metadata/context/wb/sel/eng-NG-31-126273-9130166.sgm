Some claim the Protocols are forgery.
But even if they are, what does it change?
Does it somehow makes facts non factual?

They claim that the entire passages were taken from
some existing material. But they do not seem to bother
with the fact that the entire human knowledge is such
that you build on the existing material. Otherwise,
you would be reinventing the wheel forever.

Furthermore, the very fact that some passages were
&quot;lifted&quot; from some other material is simply an indication
of a long lasting plan, carried out for centuries.

So, what DOES it change even if some passages were taken
from something else? Do they even CARE of wether it
actually makes sense and corresponds to what is actually
happening? Just look at the world affairs, geopolitical
ambitions, at how your minds are being molded by the
media and all sorts of other things. Do you see anything?

Did they look at the very material to see if it makes
sense and whether things are happening just as outlined?

Interestingly enough, some people of the highest caliber
such as Henry Ford and Winston Churchill said
&quot;I don't know if they are real or not, but what I know
is that things seem to be happening EXACTLY is it is outlined
in the protocols&quot;.

And these are the people who know it all, in and out.
They have the power, influence and access to just about
anything imaginable. So, why would they say such a thing?
And they have said it nearly 100 years ago,
and things are STILL seem to be happening EXACTLY as it was
outlined in the Protocols.

Those &quot;forgers&quot; must have been pretty insightful to see hundreds
of years into the future.

But these accusers do not even seem to care whether
material corresponds to reality to the last dot and
comma. Nor do they have access to the information on
the highest level in governments, military and intelligence
communities, business and commerce on the highest level,
where things are actually decided,
to see whether things ARE in fact happening
EXACTLY as outline in these very protocols.

It all seems to be irrelevant to these propaganda
peddlers and assorted agents, foaming at the mouth and
shouting &quot;forgery! forgery! forgery!&quot;.

The entire mankind's heritage is nothing but &quot;forgery&quot;.
Otherwise, you'd be reinventing the wheel forever.
So, what if those ideas were indeed taken from
some known work? What does it change?
Does it make the very ideas somehow invalid?

What if Rothchild, as some believe to be the author,
has taken these ideas from ancient Romans and
modified them to correspond to modern views?

Why don't you read it for yourself and find out
if it makes any sense to you. Compare it to what you
see in your real life and that which makes sense,
you keep, and that which doesn't, you just throw away?

Is anybody saying that this is the word of God
and you MUST take it for what it says?
Read it as a novel. You don't go to the author
of a novel and accuse him of &quot;forgery&quot;, do you?

Just take is as mind stimulating experience
and see how much your real life is affected by
what it says in those protocols?

Why do you need to mix Russian Tzar into equasion
and try to prove something, you can not, by ANY
measure whatsoever.

Do YOU have ANY hard evidence on the very nature of it all?
Do YOU know what actually happened and what this is
all about?
Do YOU know what was the intent behind it?
Do you know WHO stands behind it all?
What DO you know of just about ANY value?

Can those people simply use their minds
instead of yelling their heads off
and foaming at the mouth?

Here is some interesting quotes on the subject of
&quot;it is all nothing but forgery&quot;:

Quote:

&quot;Every time we do something you tell me America will do this
and will do that . . . I want to tell you something very clear:

Don't worry about American pressure on Israel.
We, the Jewish people,
control America, and the Americans know it.&quot;

--- Israeli Prime Minister,
Ariel Sharon, October 3, 2001.

Quote:

Listen to the Jewish banker, Paul Warburg:

&quot;We will have a world government whether you like it or not.
The only question is whether that government will be achieved
by conquest or consent.&quot;

(February 17, 1950, as he testified before the US Senate).

Quote:

&quot;The difference between a Jewish soul and souls of non-Jews
is greater and deeper than the difference between a human
soul and the souls of cattle&quot;

Quote:

&quot;We have to kill all the Palestinians unless they are resigned
to live here as slaves.&quot;

--- Chairman Heilbrun
of the Committee for the Re-election of General Shlomo Lahat,
the mayor of Tel Aviv, October 1983.

Quote:

&quot;We need a program of psychosurgery and
political control of our society. The purpose is
physical control of the mind. Everyone who
deviates from the given norm can be surgically
mutilated.

The individual may think that the most important
reality is his own existence, but this is only his
personal point of view. This lacks historical perspective.

Man does not have the right to develop his own
mind. This kind of liberal orientation has great
appeal. We must electrically control the brain.
Some day armies and generals will be controlled
by electrical stimulation of the brain.&quot;

Quote:

&quot;The Palestinians&quot; would be crushed like grasshoppers ...
heads smashed against the boulders and walls.&quot;

(at the time) in a speech to Jewish settlers
New York Times April 1, 1988

[To say such a thing with such confidence
by no one less than the Prime Minister?
How is it possible?]

Quote:

&quot;When we have settled the land,
all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be
to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle.&quot;

--- Raphael Eitan,
Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defence Forces,
New York Times, 14 April 1983.

Quote:

&quot;The Palestinians are like crocodiles,
the more you give them meat,
they want more&quot;....

at the time - August 28, 2000.

Quote:

&quot;How can we return the occupied territories?
There is nobody to return them to.&quot;

--- Golda Meir,
March 8, 1969.

Quote:

&quot;There was no such thing as Palestinians,
they never existed.&quot;

--- Golda Meir,
Israeli Prime Minister, June 15, 1969

Quote:

&quot;The thesis that the danger of genocide was hanging over us
in June 1967 and that Israel was fighting for its physical
existence is only bluff, which was born and developed after
the war.&quot;

--- Israeli General Matityahu Peled,
Ha'aretz, 19 March 1972.

Quote:

&quot;There is a huge gap between us (Jews) and our enemies not just in
ability but in morality, culture, sanctity of life, and conscience.
They are our neighbors here, but it seems as if at a distance of a
few hundred meters away, there are people who do not belong to our
continent, to our world, but actually belong to a different galaxy.&quot;

--- Israeli president Moshe Katsav.
The Jerusalem Post, May 10, 2001

Quote:

Ben Gurion also warned in 1948:

&quot;We must do everything to insure they ( the Palestinians)
never do return.&quot;

Quote:

It outlines a plan for &quot;global governance,&quot; calling for an
international Conference on Global Governance in 1998
for the purpose of submitting to the world the necessary
treaties and agreements for ratification by the year 2000.

Assuring his fellow Zionists that Palestinians will never come
back to their homes.

&quot;The old will die and the young will forget.&quot;

Following are some direct quotes from the Protocols.

&quot;People's minds should be diverted (away from contemplation)
towards industry and trade, and then they will have no time to
think. The people will be consumed by the pursuit of gain. It
will be vain pursuit, for we shall put industry on a speculative
basis: what is withdrawn from the land by industry will slip
through the hands of workers and industrialists and pass into
the hands of financiers.

The intensified struggle for survival and superiority,
accompanied by crises and shocks will create cold and
heartless communities with strong aversion towards religion.
Their only guide is gain that is Mammon, which they will erect
into a veritable cult&quot;.

&quot;There is a great force that creates the movement of
thought in the people, and that is the media. It is in the media
that the triumph of freedom of speech finds its incarnation.
Through the Press we have gained the power to influence
minds while remaining unobserved. We shall erase from the
memory of men the historical facts we do not want them to
know, and leave only those we wish&quot;.

&quot;The race of armaments and the increase of police force will
bring forth society where are only the masses of the
proletariat, a few millionaires, police and soldiers&quot;.

&quot;Freedom might be harmless and have its place in the State
economy without injury to the well-being of the people if it
rested upon the foundation of faith in God, upon the
Brotherhood of humanity. This is the reason why it is
indispensable for us to undermine all faith, to tear out of the
people's mind the very principle of God and the Spirit, and to
put in its place arithmetical calculations and material needs&quot;.

&quot;politicians who, in case of disobedience to our instructions,
must face criminal charges or disappear. We shall arrange
elections in favour of candidates with some dark, undiscovered
stain in their past. They will be our trustworthy agents out of
fear of revelations&quot;

The master plan of Illuminati NWO

Re: Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion

This is a secret which has not been revealed.
They are the Hidden hand.
They are not the &quot;Board of Deputies&quot;
(the Jewish Parliament in England)
or the &quot;Universal Israelite Alliance&quot; which sits in Paris.

But the late Walter Rathenau of the Allgemeiner Electricitaets
Gesellschaft has thrown a little light on the subject and doubtless
he was in possession of their names, being, in all likelihood,
one of the chief leaders himself.

Writing in the WIENER FREIE PRESSE, December 24, 1912, he said:

&quot;Three hundred men, each of whom knows all the others,
govern the fate of the European continent, and they elect their
successors from their entourage.&quot;

In the year 1844, on the eve of the Jewish Revolution of 1848,
Benjamin Disraeli, whose real name was Israel, and who was a
&quot;damped,&quot; or baptized Jew, published his novel, CONINGSBY,
in which occurs this ominous passage:

&quot;The world is governed by very different personages from what
is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.&quot;

And he went on to show that these personages were all Jews.

Notes II - The Symbolic Snake of Judaism.

Protocol III opens with a reference to the Symbolic Snake of
Judaism. In his Epilogue to the 1905 Edition of the Protocols,
Nilus gives the following interesting account of this symbol:

&quot;According to the records of secret Jewish Zionism, Solomon
and other Jewish learned men already, in 929 B.C., thought out
a scheme in theory for a peaceful conquest of the whole universe
by Zion.

As history developed, this scheme was worked out in detail and
completed by men who were subsequently initiated in this question.

These learned men decided by peaceful means to conquer the world
for Zion with the slyness of the Symbolic Snake, whose head
was to represent those who have been initiated into the plans
of the Jewish administration, and the body of the Snake to represent
the Jewish people - the administration was always kept secret,
EVEN FROM THE JEWISH NATION ITSELF.

As this Snake penetrated into the hearts of the nations which it
encountered it undermined and devoured all the non-Jewish power
of these States.

It is foretold that the Snake has still to finish its work,
strictly adhering to the designed plan, until the course which
it has to run is closed by the return of its head to Zion and until,
by this means, the Snake has completed its round of Europe and has
encircled it - and until, by dint of enchaining Europe, it has
encompassed the whole world.

This it is to accomplish by using every endeavor to subdue the
other countries by an ECONOMICAL CONQUEST.

The return of the head of the Snake to Zion can only be accomplished
after the power of all the Sovereign of Europe has been laid low,
that is to say, when by means of economic crises and wholesale
destruction effected everywhere, there shall have been brought about
a spiritual demoralization and a moral corruption, chiefly with the
assistance of Jewish women masquerading as French, Italians, etc..

These are the surest spreaders of licentiousness into the lives of
the leading men at the heads of nations.

A map of the course of the Symbolic Snake is shown as follows:
- Its first stage in Europe was in 429 B.C. in Greece, where,
about the time of Pericles, the Snake first started eating into
the power of that country.

The second stage was in Rome in the time of Augustus, about 69 B.C..

The third in Madrid in the time of Charles V, in A.D. 1552.

The fourth in Paris about 1790, in the time of Louis XVI.

The fifth in London from 1814 onwards (after the downfall of Napoleon).

The sixth in Berlin in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian war.

The seventh in St. Petersburg, over which is drawn the head of
the Snake under the date of 1881.

[This &quot;Snake&quot; is now being drawn through the Americas and in the
United States of America, it is been partially identified as the
&quot;Counsel on Foreign Relations&quot; (C.F.R.) and
the &quot;Tri-Lateral Commission&quot;].

All these States which the Snake traversed have had the foundations
of their constitutions shaken, Germany, with its apparent power,
forming no exception to the rule.

In economic conditions, England and Germany are spared,
but only till the conquest of Russia is accomplished by the Snake,
on which at present [i.e., 1905] all its efforts are concentrated.

The further course of the Snake is not shown on this map,
but arrows indicate its next movement towards Moscow, Kiev and Odessa.

It is now well known to us to what extent the latter cities form the
centuries of the militant Jewish race. Constantinople is shown as the
last stage of the Snake's course before it reaches Jerusalem.

- i.e., Jewish - Revolution in Turkey). den.

Stauffer has taught at Harvard University and Georgetown University's
School of Foreign Service. Stauffer's findings were first presented at
an October 2002 conference sponsored by the U.S. Army College and the
University of Maine.

Stauffer's analysis is &quot;an estimate of the total cost to the
U.S. alone of instability and conflict in the region - which emanates
from the core Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&quot;

&quot;Total identifiable costs come to almost $3 trillion,&quot; Stauffer
says. &quot;About 60 percent, well over half, of those costs - about $1.7
trillion - arose from the U.S. defense of Israel, where most of that
amount has been incurred since 1973.&quot;

&quot;Support for Israel comes to $1.8 trillion, including special
trade advantages, preferential contracts, or aid buried in other
accounts. In addition to the financial outlay, U.S. aid to Israel costs
some 275,000 American jobs each year.&quot; The trade-aid imbalance alone
with Israel of between $6-10 billion costs about 125,000 American jobs
every year, Stauffer says.

The largest single element in the costs has been the series of
oil-supply crises that have accompanied the Israeli-Arab wars and the
construction of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. &quot;To date these have
cost the U.S. $1.5 trillion (2002 dollars), excluding the additional
costs incurred since 2001&quot;, Stauffer wrote.

Loans made to Israel by the U.S. government, like the recently
awarded $9 billion, invariably wind up being paid by the American
taxpayer. A recent Congressional Research Service report indicates that
Israel has received $42 billion in waived loans.
&quot;Therefore, it is reasonable to consider all government loans
to Israel the same as grants,&quot; McArthur says.
