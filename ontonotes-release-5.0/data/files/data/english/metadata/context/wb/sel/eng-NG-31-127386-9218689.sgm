The Aether... (where Physics meets Philosophy)

Can you be without existing? Can you be in a realm where neither time
nor space have any significance? Is there any useful, meaningful
information below the Planck scale?

The difference between being and existing is that - to be - you don't
need to be somewhere, while - to exist - you do. To exist your
location must be certain, you must exist above the Planck scale, to be
you don't need to be material, and all you need to be physical is to
be able to act as a force.

The aether is the physical, nonmaterial substance from where the whole
Universe emerged.

The aether must permeate everything, it is everywhere by its own
definition. You can't conceive a fragmentable aether, or it would not
be the aether as it was defined thousands of years ago. By definition,
everything is made from the aether, even the space that surrounds you.
This definition is what makes GTR (General Theory of Relativity) true,
since everything is related through and by the aether. Or how could it
be that, just because something is in an accelerated state, time and
length must change in relation to a stationary observer existing in
the same inertial frame as the accelerated object? Wasn't space
supposed to be absolute, primary, independent and non-derivable from
anything else (Newton)? The Universe is one single entity, one
process. Space... objects... Mankind... comes from one thing, which by
definition, we call the aether.

Any material substance will occupy space. This physical but
nonmaterial substance (aether) does not occupy any space. It doesn't
exist in spacetime, because it is spacetime. This physical nonmaterial
substance becomes matter as fields spin at very high speeds, creating
material properties like volume, extension, motion, time, mass,
gravity, solidity... and consequently... causing the formation of
objects in spacetime.

The aether gives the universe properties like wholeness,
interconnectedness, continuity, and, since the property of extension
doesn't apply to it, non-locality. There are no parts when you refer
to the aether. But you can look at electric fields, magnetic fields,
gravitational fields, or any kind of force field as different 'things'
or 'parts' of a greater whole made from the same continuos and
inseparable aether. Everything is connected to the aether because
everything is made from it.

You can measure the properties of fields, but you can't take a direct
measurement of the aether. The aether is not matter, therefore, not
directly observable. Things move, but not in relation to the aether,
things move in relation to other things at the classical level, but
that loses meaning at the sub-quantum level, the level at which the
aether is before it manifests itself as multiple entities. The aether
is indivisible... you could stretch fields and create the appearance
of separated volumes within it but you can't divide the aether into
separate entities. In that sense, the aether is apparently infinitely
divisible. This is why many say you could fit the whole universe in a
point.

You claim that aether predates the Universe.  On which theory /
hypothesis do you base this?  How can this be tested / disproven?

Self-interference effects will be expressed for any finite geometry.
This implies that no particle (moving or &quot;slit&quot;) is entirely local.
Addtionally, quantum mechanics requires that virtual exchanges follow
all possible paths and at all possible speeds (with no c upper
limit).  So if to some extent all that is, is everywhere, then no
aether is even required... since it becomes another name for &quot;how

Right, at the quantum level, or what I call hyperspace, sometimes the
whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

This is what I think. :)

The aether, consists of basic, changeless, motionless fixed values
(laws), from which everything else, including meaningful information,
is being created as spacetime.

When you think about the infinite capacity of EM waves to store and
propagate information, you have to ask yourself, why should we go sub-
quantum when the quantum level and spacetime provide us with such a
rich structure (Television, cell phones, radio, virtual particles and
all EMR).

How can information contained as all kinds of geometrical
relationships, ratios within ratios, that are evident or real only in
spacetime, be created, stored and accessed by process, at a sub-
quantum level?

The aether is what makes the magnetic, electric and gravitational
fields react to each other and other phenomena (charge, mass...) the
manner in which they do, as autopoiesis occurs.

Some of the information about the environment (about the universe)
comes from the aether, as it rules the whole universe, all at once,
with just a few fundamental laws (constants), but most of it is stored
in spacetime. Thanks to the wholeness of the aether this information
can be transmitted instantaneously as wave dimensions (through wave
superposition), allowing at the same time all kinds of emergent
informational systems to observe themselves in wholeness,
consequently, helping them to evolve.

Particle complementarity is due to an indivisible process which
originates in a common background, but the only necessary information
being transferred (through EMR in hyperspace) from the aether to the
particles is that concerning momentum and location in relation to that
inertial frame and the rest of Universe. There is no need for some
mega information storage system which must contain the history of the
universe, all the information needed for the evolution of the system
in spacetime is contained by the system itself - in spacetime.

I don't see all the information that comprises a material system
coming from the 'implicate order', every object exists as a solid body
coupled to a matter-wave, and its displacement through space must be
described by a wave-function. Information about the object's relation
to its surroundings and the rest of the Universe is picked and brought
in by each object's particular pilot-wave. I see Hiley's pre-space as
synonymous to the aether, but in my view the aether has no capacity to
hold any meaningfull information, just qualities which are turned into
quantities by matter in spacetime.

So Quantum Mechanics' big mystery was - why do I have to observe the
cat in order to know whether is dead or alive? And the answer is that
our brains are measuring devices, just like the rest of all matter. We
are the best measuring device that ever emerged from all the
information processing that has transcurred in our neighborhood to
this date. Interactions within the system (brain) depend on more than
the information it gets through the senses, there is an interaction
occurring at a deeper level between the system and its environment.

The medium in which any given self-organized system is developing is
full of information which the system needs and will use in order to
maintain itself. Matter is not different, it can be defined as a self-
organized system, and the medium in which it develops is full of
information in the form of EMR. Any given neutron will need to extract
from hyperspace only the information neutrons need to support their
structure. In other words, only information that is meaningfull to
neutrons.

The fact that this information is gathered in hyperspace makes it a
non-local function. This function was defined by Bohm's quantum
potential as a holistic awareness function of matter, as he explained
EPR type phenomena (entanglement, non-locality, FTL communication...).

If we allow for three different scales of reality with the aether as
an eternal substrate for hyperspace and spacetime, it can be done. We
could say that aether, hyperspace and spacetime are all different
states of the same entity, the difference between them being just a
matter of scale. At the aether scale (sub-quantum) there are no
reference points, no meaningful motion, no time, no wave fronts...
then at a larger scale it becomes hyperspace and we get EM waves,
strings/branes and the quantum, and finally, at an even larger scale,
we get Einstein's spacetime, the objective universe as we naturally
perceive it.

1) The Aether - (Sub-quantum level), dimensionless, eternal. A
Hawking's singularity or Hiley's 'pre-space'. Previously considered as
an entity, a medium for fields to propagate through, by great minds
like Maxwell, Lorentz, Einstein... and more recently treted as the
implicate order or pre-space by Bohm, Hiley and others.

2) Hyperspace - (Quantum level). Wheeler's pre-geometry, Kaku's
hyperspace, CBR, ZPF...

3) Spacetime - (Classical level). Gravity, spacetime... the objective
Universe.

When we rotate the plane of polarization in a beam of light the whole
beam changes at once, instantaneously, so what kind of medium is this
aether?

The aether is non-dimensional. Events occurring within the aether
occur without motion, but the manifestations we have in hyperspace,
and the objective reduction of matter-waves into spacetime are
ultimately ruled by laws coming from the aether's intrinsic
electromagnetic properties.

If we could conceive reality to have started with this non-material
(because neither time nor length apply to it) indivisible substance
(that makes the points that make the lines that make the strings that
make the quanta that makes the quarks...) from where hyperspace
emerged (sharing the properties of both - the aether's omnipresence,
and spacetime's linear time, motion and information processing), and
finally we got spacetime as reference points emerged, which contains
the properties of all three scales or realms. What else could we ask
for?

It is an indivisible, eternal singularity which has inflated and
stretched to what the universe is today. It has no parts and no
process within it, all process occurrs at spacetime level. Motion,
time, extension, order, size, a beginning with an ending... are
notions that do not apply, and yet everything is made from it, even
space.

If space were what Newton thought it was, non-locality would have been
a very hard thing to understand. That's why action at a distance
seemed like an absurd to Newton, since, in his view, there was no way
an object could exist in two different places at the same time.

To us (at spacetime scale) it seems as if it became a bunch of
unrelated separated entities, but in reality it's all connected
through the all pervading aether, even the most desolated regions of
the universe are part of the one single process that started it all,
it's all made from the same aether that gave birth to it. Everything
that changes will experience inertial forces, simply because in
reality there is only one process, a uni-verse, from where a myriad of
informational nodes (objects) evolved to become apparently separated
systems.

For any process to continue evolving there must be a function of
internal oversight as a whole, which is only possible if all the parts
are interconnected. We knew this had to be a non-local function, and
this function is only possible because of that oneness quality coming
from the aether scale.

Action at a distance appears to happen at spacetime level, where
objects exist embedded in a coordinate system (metric) defined by the
continuous functions of four independent variables (4D). Extension and
separation are properties of spacetime, but at the aether level action
at a distance does not make sense because there exists no separation,
the aether is one, it has no parts and it lacks the properties of time
and extension. In other words, at the aether scale there is no
distance between events happening in spacetime. Within the aether,
motion/information/momentum is reported instantaneously, distance
doesn't apply, the aether has no parts, no units, it is one. Within
hyperspace, and the ability for different objects within it to occupy
the same space, we have EMR, where information propagation is limited
to moving mass (process) at the speed of light. But hyperspace itself
is in a chaotic state, order is imparted from systems existing in
spacetime. Within spacetime most things obey Newton's motion laws, but
thanks to the non-material properties and holistic nature of the
aether, everything is non-locally interconnected to everything else in
its neighborhood and the rest of the observable universe. Information
processing, at the aether level, is instantaneous. The holographic
properties and the instantaneous state propagation properties of
momentum space are what make possible phenomena like inertia.

There is no process within the aether itself because it has no parts,
but there aren't separate processes going on within it either. The
aether is motionless therefore changeless. Everything is made from it,
from quanta to galaxies to space. All the

Wow!  Am I glad I happened on to this discussion.  If I may, I would
like to offer some comments.  For several years I have been bothered
by many of the *constants* used to help explain or amplify
cosmological and quantum phenomenae.  The one constant that has
bothered me the most was c.  It seems quite presumptive of us, as
predominately visual beings, to think that we have *seen* a limit to
the speed of light and therefore, to informational exchange.  If c is
truly a constant, then there is a multiplicative equivalence between
energy and mass as Einstein proposed.  I realized that the universe
must be a combination of either energy or mass and that their
relationship was directly intertwined.  I concluded that matter can be
explained as transformations of this universal energy (your aether).
I also think that there are some problems with our view of time.  Its
unidirectionality and liniarity present unique problems.  I am
wrestling with the notion that each particle/event has its own time
signature which makes that particle/event unique and that specific
time signature is needed to completely define it.  (I agree that
action at a distance is a non-problem when we consider the previously
defined properties of the aether as a whole.)  Quantum states,
strings, and galaxy clusters seem more easilly related when viewed in
the context of an all-permeating aether.  Magueijo's Variable Speed of
Light (VLS) theory, while innovative, becomes unnecessary in the
context of an aether.  Thanks for posting your thoughts.  I'm relieved
to find others thinking along the same track.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One that is not required.  Only one that is preferred as &quot;model

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and information processing), and finally we got
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spacetime as reference points emerged, which contains
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the properties of all three scales or realms. What else

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How could matter emerge out of nothingness?

&gt; &gt; &gt; It never did in the quantum realm.  Matter / mass is a

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is as much &quot;population mean&quot; as is spacetime.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Meaningless for a population of one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Energy whips the various properties into existence, just
&gt; &gt; &gt; like motion whips natural latex into a rubber film.

&gt; &gt; Wow!  Am I glad I happened on to this discussion.  If I
&gt; &gt; may, I would like to offer some comments.  For several
&gt; &gt; years I have been bothered by many of the *constants*
&gt; &gt; used to help explain or amplify cosmological and
&gt; &gt; quantum phenomenae.

&gt; As was Dirac ....

&gt; &gt; The one constant that has bothered me the most was c.
&gt; &gt; It seems quite presumptive of us, as predominately visual
&gt; &gt; beings, to think that we have *seen* a limit to the speed of
&gt; &gt; light and therefore, to informational exchange.

&gt; Been tested *locally* innumerable times.  Everything from simple
&gt; signalling, to ricocheting photons off of very high speed electrons.
&gt; No surprises.
">

Thanks for taking the time to read my junk and comment.  It was
educational.  I agree that the locality of light has been tested many
times and there are no suprises.  Absolutely everything we know about
the cosmos is substantially based on the *imutable* fact that no where
and under no conditions is the speed of anything faster than the speed
of light.  It also identifies the limit of informational exchange.
All on a *local* level.  We have already trapped a photon  I just
meant that I would not be surpised to learn that there are forces in
the cosmos that might have in the past,or still can, accelerate
light.  I would love to see some date on the red shift of the hydrogen
spectra during gravitational lensing.  It might be useful in this
matter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; If c is truly a constant, then there is a multiplicative

Actually I understand Einstein's derivation of c from L.  I was more
interested in the equivalence between energy and mass.  I don't
remember any physical experiments that precisely demonstrate this
relationship.  I suppose some radioactive decay processes come quite
close as long as we sort of look the other way when we invent ways to
describe missing energy.  Hence the use of the word proposed.  Oops,

Sorry about ascribing the aether to you!  I'll be happy to inflate as

I'm sort of confused when you site the second law of thermodynamics as
helpful in deriving the properties of time.  If memory servers, the
second law refers to the increasing entropy of an isolated system.  I
think there is substantial argument that the universe is not  an
isolated system.  And I think that when there is a statistical
analysis of microsystems that have very few particles, the process
almost completely breaks down.  This is part of the delima that led me
to try to consider the fact that each particle, especially in the
quantum realm, has its own specific time signature that makes it what
it is, so to speak.

&gt; I am wrestling with the notion that each particle/event has its

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; own time signature which makes that particle/event unique and
&gt; &gt; that specific time signature is needed to completely define it.

&gt; All the particles share a common *now*.  All measurements we can make
&gt; show they *report* a common, unified past.  Hard to have an &quot;all
&gt; pervading aether&quot; as a source for time and have what you posit.
">

Each particle's probability of position or wave function might have a
common *now* but it is a stretch to think that all particles are
linked to a universal now which drag along some past.  A past is
unique in the sense no two can be exactly alike.  I'm not fully aware
of Laurent's definition of aether and am not certainly ready to
proscribe to it the ability to *invent* time.

Right.  The problem is, we don't see any evidence that the laws
of physics are different elsewhere.  And we have no theoretical
basis to describe what those differences might be.  What is more,
&quot;distant physics&quot; = &quot;ancient physics&quot;, so consequently the fine

Lorentz invariant values originate at the aether level, they are real
but non-material ratios which often help determine geometrical
properties of objects in spacetime. It is where frame independent
constants like the propagation speed of fields are set. And thanks to
these frame independent constants the universe is isometric. Take the
fine structure constant for example, change its value and you get a
totally different universe.

We could take a pound of earth and turn into a pound of gold if we
could manipulate  and rearrange its parts, as long as we maintain and
continue to use the fundamental constants.

Empty space was, then came the universe. There can be empty space
without a universe, but not a universe without empty space... just
like there can't be matter without continuity, causality and process.
Reduce yourself to a size smaller than the smallest particle and what
do you get? More empty space.

Einstein's aether - which is the aether I mostly talk about - isn't
bound by time , but by topolgical properties, a set of ratios
determined at the aether scale; frame independent and fundamental
constants. A very small number of fixed laws by which all matter and
space must abide. Physical (real) but non-material quantities
(topological). Time independent continuity and connectedness. We can
also call it topological space, inertial space, or momentum space.

In relation to covariance and the twins paradox, there isn't a change
in the incoming flux of quantum matter (ZPR, material space, Guth's
'false vacuum') as much as there is a change in the information
processing amount. That's where inertia comes from, a change in the
amount of information being processed.

Because the speed of light is a frame independent constant, and
because the aether is physically finite, there is a need for the
principles of relativity and equivalency, we need to include
covariance and deformation in order to accurately describe reality.

Since the speed of light, hence, the propagation speed of fields, must
remain constant for all the other fundamental constants to continue to
be proportianally the same, process (mass) has to increase in order to
keep up... to a point, once you go over the speed limit and fields
can't keep up, matter disintegrates.

GTR is an aether theory. That everything is related through empty
space is the basis, the foundation, of the GTR. That everything exists
in a single field, in a matrix. It is a phylosophical necessity, if
not, how can anyone explain inertia, gravity or action-at-distance?

Lets take the Big Bang and inflation as facts, where would the super
dense particle or membrane, whatever, that started it all would be
sitting on?

Empty space has properties characteristic of a dimensionless point,
yet, it contains the universe.

This notion of a primordial substance is a very old one, it is also
known as Akasha or Brahman. It has been

No.  Aether fails to describe gravity, when you get down to

and even describes the behavior of black holes (which candidates have
been observed).

By the lack of total locality of individual particles.  GR
