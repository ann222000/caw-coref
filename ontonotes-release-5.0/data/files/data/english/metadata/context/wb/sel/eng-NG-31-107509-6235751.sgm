The reason Wampus's website doesn't have anything about this
networking is because it's new and we're just now making it.

The benefits to bloggers and podcasters alike would include:

- free and/or advance copies of Wampus releases for airplay and review
- co-marketing opportunities through Wampus media vehicles and outlets
- collaborations with Wampus (such as project partnerships)

The idea is to stay in touch with a media company that truly is
interested in what the podcasting and blogging communities do for
independent music.

The database is still being built.
The Wampus website is there for people to learn about the company
itself, that way you all can decide whether or not you would be
interested in working with us in the future.

Sorry about the confusion!

Stephanie,

You have to understand that the people on this list have seen every
new startup company under the sun selling some brave new concept on
here. And for their first post, they always post some cut-and-paste
one-size-fits-all marketing copy. We tend to jump on it. We're
podcasters. We want to talk about podcasting. And as for promotional
systems, we tend to gravitate to things put together by other
podcasters, or at least by people who understand it clearly.

Your system may have some good qualities, but if you're hyping it that
hard to get users before you have anything, it's all smoke and
mirrors. I looked at your site in depth, and at your marketing copy,
and I don't see anything on there that's going to rock my world.

A lot of us on this list are very computer- and media- and
marketing-savvy people, and we know what we're looking for. There
aren't a lot of things that blow podcasters away.
Here's the things that really help podcasters, and make us say "WOW! I
REALLY LIKE THIS!! I'M BLOWN AWAY!!":

--Good condenser microphones
--Good mixers
--iRiver recorders
--Giant Squid microphones
--Levelator
--Skype
--Audacity (the free robust audio editing program, though the
personality trait can also make for a more interesting show.)
--iTunes store.
--Maybe one or two of the podcasting directories. (There are hundreds.)

and not much else. So when someone's very first post is some marketing
hooey that we've heard dozens, if not hundreds, of times before, we
kinda giggle.

Rule one of marketing is "Tool your press material to your audience."
Otherwise you've got a shotgun pointed into a crowd. Use a laser,
Stephanie.

I don't mean this as a slam. If you're smart, you'll take it as advice
and retool your approach when you post on other sites.

As a recording engineer/producer, and Podcast producer I am interested in other things.  My recording rig is where I want it to be as is my DAW.

What I would first be interested in is hearing your music.  I do a lot (most) of the music programming on our podcast, and sometimes have a difficult time finding music of sufficient quality to put on our show. For me that means three things:

1) The music has to be good and interesting.  I'm sure that means different things to different people, but having been a musician for 30+ years I know the difference between someone who can play their instrument, and someone who can not.  The band should be tight,  and the song should have a mean groove.

2) I prefer the music to be well produced.  Sometimes a great song will make it onto the program if it isn't recorded well, but more often it will not.

3) Please release your podsafe music (or whatever license you plan to use) at a minimum of 192K MP3s.  There are too many low quality MP3's on the Podsafe Music Network.  I don't want to take a 128K MP3 (or lower) and then re-encode it at 128K when I encode the show, and make the song sound even worse.  On my program I like the input sounds (before finally encoding the show to MP3) to be as high quality as possible.  When we play music on our show, we either use 320K MP3s, or true CD quality at input.

Wassail,
Rich...

The first part of joining this 'new media network' is to give us
contact information so that we can send you music. We just need to
build up our database. If you're interested in that, please let me
know at stepha ... @wampus.com

I have to completely disagree with you, Michael.  This perspective
seems far too limiting and treehouseish.  Even in my apparent role as
List Ogre, I can't find any virtue in a list like yours saying "Here's
what we want to talk about, and if you come with something else in
hand, there's the door."

I thought her response was a good response.  There's nothing at all
wrong with an indie music label saying "Hi, we're an indie music
label, and we'd like to form some relationships with podcasters for
mutual benefit."  That's a Very Good Thing, and Wampus doing it now
puts them well ahead of the curve.  Her second message made it clear
that that was what they wanted to do.

The only thing wrong with her *first* message is that it didn't
clearly communicate who Wampus was and what they wanted.  It didn't
paint a picture of an indie music label -- it sounded like they wanted
to form a broad social network or...*something*...and that signing on
with them would somehow revolutionize the world.

Clarity was asked for, and it was supplied.  Let's not bare our teeth
by reflex at everyone who gives a straight answer to something.
