Some other things I've read compared the Chinese and
Japanese reaction to the introduction of trains from the
West.  Railroads were built be Westerners in both countries,
but the Chinese ripped theirs up because they didn't want
the non-traditional technologies.  By contrast, Japan
welcomed Western technologies after first trying to keep
them out.

Well when I took my history degree back in the 70's I deliberately
slanted it towards the history of Technology, especially from the 16th
to the 18th century. I did some study on China in that period and I
can't recall anything that showed a knowledge of air pressure in
enclosed spaces, whether positive or negative (vacuum).
Chinese philosophy probably predisposed thinking towards flowing or
moving things. hence good knowledge of canal building, practical wind
power, waterwheels etc. But this also led away from the idea of trapped
and enclosed spaces, a piston and cylinder for example.

Strangely enough because the Chinese must have come across the principle
of the "fire cylinder" in SE Asia, (compressing air in a bamboo tube
with a piston to heat it sufficiently to cause combustion of some tinder).
But they did nothing with the idea.
Something like Heron's turbine would have been within their concepts,
but of course it was inherently very inefficient.
Also they totally missed the idea of the pendulum, even though it was
used in geomancy in China, so western clocks were one of the most prized
exports in the 17th and 18th century.
Underlying the whole problem with China though, was of course the very
limited literacy of the artisan class.
A Chinese Newcomen or Watt would have to go through an official or
scribe just to put his ideas down on paper and thus come to the
attention of the (very conservative) Ming or Manchu officials.
The perfect example of this "ideas gap" is the fact that the Chinese
were making absolutely superb iron castings in the 13th century using
natural gas for fuel. By the 19th century their knowledge had been so
far lost that they had to use European expertise to cast cannons that
could withstand the much more powerful western gunpowder in the Opium
wars of the 1840's. Chinese made cannon were treated as a joke by the
Britsh navy after their lack of range and accuracy became clear from
experience.

This is a most interesting thought. It reminds me of a book by C.
Northcote Parkinson (yes, him of the Law) accounting for the recent (and
of course temporary) dominance of the West precisely on the grounds of the
literacy of the common people. The literate sergeant and the literate
boatswain, in his view, gave a huge advantage in war, since they could
understand complex things like guns. But the failure of any Newcomen or
Watt to get his ideas preserved

You said the magic words "Needham" and  "Newcomen" and the Newcomen
Society has a journal and it is partially on-line. This a partial
rendition of an article and there is a line drawing illustration at the
cite. Needham's original text "The Pre-Natal History of the Steam
Engine" runs to 67 pages and covers China, India, greece, etc.

Early influences on the steam engine, China AD 31
An excerpt from the Society's Transactions

The paper entitled "The Pre-natal History of the Steam Engine" by Dr
Joseph Needham is published in Transactions of the Newcomen Society,
1962-63 Vol 35.

In this paper the author proposes that many of the vital components of
Newcomen's steam engine were anticipated by others, very many centuries
earlier, and in quite different parts of the world. In this passage he
introduces us to the 2,000 year old Chinese water-power reciprocator:

"Having dealt with cylinders, pistons, and valves I now propose to
show that the other kinematic half of Newcomen's child, the
reciprocating steam-engine, was anticipated by, and even indirectly
derived from, a pattern which had arisen in medieval China for an
exactly inverse purpose.

Chinese water-power reciprocator, AD 31
The water-power reciprocator, or blowing-engine (shui phai)
© copyright

When we ask about the earliest water-wheel in Chinese history we
come upon the paradox that it was not used for turning simple cereal
grindstones, but for the more complicated job of blowing metallurgical
bellows. This must mean that there was a tradition of millwrights going
back some considerable time before even though we cannot trace it in
literary references. The essential text, the Hou Han Shu, tells us:

In AD 31, the seventh year of the Chien-Wu reign-period, Tu
Shih was posted to be Prefect of Nanyang. He was a generous man and his
politics were peaceful; he destroyed evil-doers and established the
dignity of his office. Good at planning, he loved the common people and
wished to save their labour. He invented a water-power reciprocator, or
blowing-engine (shui phai), for the casting of agricultural
implements."

The author concludes: "If Newcomen's work is taken as the turning
point, the hidden pre-natal history of the reciprocating steam-engine
played a remarkably large part in its 'post-natal' history. For in
order to go beyond the single-stroke stage and the non-rotary stage,
currents of design were required which went back many centuries before
Newcomen and Watt. No single man was 'father of the steam-engine'; no
single civilization either - yet no-one comes nearer to deserving the
title than Thomas Newcomen".

Catch me if I'm wrong, but my reading of Needham on this does not
equate with what Pomeranz was claiming.  The basic concept behind the
steam engine was the change in pressure caused by the expansion of
water into steam, and the reverse change by its condensation back into
water.  The root of this, as I understand, were the 17th century
experiments with vacuum and atmospheric pressure. If I read Needham
correctly, none of this scientific understanding, nor any
experimentation or mechanical devices related to it, were present in
China.  However, some of the mechanisms used to harness this
principal- for example, those used for the double-acting principle and
the interconversion of rotary and rectilinear motion, appear to have
Chinese antecedents.

The closest thing I could find in Needham to a Chinese understanding
of the principles behind the steam engine is a passage from an ancient
Chinese book of magic that says that if you put boiling water in a
metal container, seal it, and toss it in a well, you will hear a loud
bang.  This certainly could have led to an understanding of
atmospheric pressure, had the author attempted to understand *why* it
happened, but it doesn't indicate that such an understanding in fact
existed.

Pomeranz's assertion that "steam engines of a sort" were found in many
societies, including China, seems so far as I can figure out be a
reference to the steam jet (basically, a heated vessel emitting a jet
of steam- for blowing up fires and stuff), which existed in the
ancient Mediterranean and central Asia- but not China, although
Needham speculates that they *may* have had it although there is no
evidence. At any rate, its not a steam engine, although it probably
inspired speculation in that direction.

I can find no evidence that the Chinese were just as likely to invent
the steam engine as England, but didn't because they didn't have the
luck of coal and industry close together like England, which is
Pomeranz's assertion. On the other hand, I find that Newcomen's
invention of the first commercially viable steam engine had roots in a
line of experimentation going back to ancient and later Renaissance
times, and given a crucial assist by 17th century science.  Thus,
England's bit of geological good luck undoubtedly helped, but some
kind of breakthrough seems to me  inevitable, while it doesn't seem
evident that Qing China was on the track to inventing it, geological
luck or no.  Anyway, that's just my take on it.

Early modern Europe seems to have been on a roll, innovationwise-
whether its technology, science, philosophy, politics...China at that
time apparently wasn't to the same degree- its previous spate of
technological innovativeness culminating in the Sung era appears to
have slowed down.  Why this was...is an interesting question.

(Some other things seem amiss with Pomeranz's argument. Although
Britain's situation was obviously conducive to the use of Newcomen's
steam engine, it also rapidly became used in continental Europe, ie.
France, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Sweden. And its not like China
didn't have coal although it didn't require draining like English
mines.  He notes that most coal were far from the economic centers of
the country, but then mentions some that was near the Grand Canal, but
that was inefficiently utilized because the government officials
arranged for it to be exploited by small-scale, ineffective mining
operations. Hrm...)

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I've lately been reading &quot;the Great Divergence&quot; by Kenneth Pomeranz,

&gt; &gt;&gt; developed the steam engine andChinadidn't is because Britain had
&gt; &gt;&gt; coal close to industry and needed to pump water from mines, whereas
&gt; &gt;&gt;Chinadidnt.  He asserts that in other respectsChinawas just as
&gt; &gt;&gt; likely to develop steam power.  Among his assertions is that &quot;steam
&gt; &gt;&gt; engines of a sort&quot; were found in many non-western societies,
&gt; &gt;&gt; includingChina; that the Chinese understood the necesarry &quot;principle
&gt; &gt;&gt; of atmospheric pressure&quot;, and that Jesuits in 1600sChinabuilt
&gt; &gt;&gt; steam-powered toys influenced by Chinese examples.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've looked in numerous sources, including the ones he cites (ie
&gt; &gt;&gt; Needham), and the only steam-powered device outside modern Europe I
&gt; &gt;&gt; can find is Heron's from ancient Alexandria.  Nor do I find evidence
&gt; &gt;&gt; that the Chinese had anything but the practical knowledge that air
&gt; &gt;&gt; exerts pressure that lies behind bellows or sails.  So far as I know
&gt; &gt;&gt; they did not have the knowledge developed by 17th century European
&gt; &gt;&gt; scientists, understanding vacuum and the variability of air pressure,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and the fact that this can be done by turning water to gas. And the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Jesuit devices, so far as I could find out, seemed to have no Chinese
&gt; &gt;&gt; influences.  Meanwhile European dabbling in this seems to go back to
&gt; &gt;&gt; the 1500s, and of course earlier to Heron.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Does anyone here know anything about this? Is this guy's argument
&gt; &gt;&gt; based on anything at all?Some other things I've read compared the Chinese and
&gt; Japanese reaction to the introduction of trains from the
&gt; West.  Railroads were built be Westerners in both countries,
&gt; but the Chinese ripped theirs up because they didn't want
&gt; the non-traditional technologies.  By contrast, Japan
&gt; welcomed Western technologies after first trying to keep
&gt; them out.

Yeah, the mix of indifference and hostility displayed towards Western
devices by a significant portion of Chinese especially in the elite
does not especially make it hopeful that they would have invented them
themselves.  The late imperial Chinese elite seems to have been very
against any kind of disruption in the normal order, and the industrial
revolution certainly was that.

&gt; &gt; Early influences on the steam engine,ChinaAD 31
&gt; &gt; An excerpt from the Society's Transactions

&gt; &gt; The paper entitled &quot;The Pre-natal History of the Steam Engine&quot; by Dr
&gt; &gt; Joseph Needham is published in Transactions of the Newcomen Society,
&gt; &gt; 1962-63 Vol 35.

&gt; &gt; In this paper the author proposes that many of the vital components of
&gt; &gt; Newcomen's steam engine were anticipated by others, very many centuries
&gt; &gt; earlier, and in quite different parts of the world. In this passage he
&gt; &gt; introduces us to the 2,000 year old Chinese water-power reciprocator:

&gt; &gt;     &quot;Having dealt with cylinders, pistons, and valves I now propose to
&gt; &gt; show that the other kinematic half of Newcomen's child, the
&gt; &gt; reciprocating steam-engine, was anticipated by, and even indirectly
&gt; &gt; derived from, a pattern which had arisen in medievalChinafor an
&gt; &gt; exactly inverse purpose.

&gt; &gt;     Chinese water-power reciprocator, AD 31
&gt; &gt;     The water-power reciprocator, or blowing-engine (shui phai)
&gt; &gt;     © copyright

&gt; &gt;     When we ask about the earliest water-wheel in Chinese history we
&gt; &gt; come upon the paradox that it was not used for turning simple cereal
&gt; &gt; grindstones, but for the more complicated job of blowing metallurgical
&gt; &gt; bellows. This must mean that there was a tradition of millwrights going
&gt; &gt; back some considerable time before even though we cannot trace it in
&gt; &gt; literary references. The essential text, the Hou Han Shu, tells us:

&gt; &gt;         In AD 31, the seventh year of the Chien-Wu reign-period, Tu
&gt; &gt; Shih was posted to be Prefect of Nanyang. He was a generous man and his
&gt; &gt; politics were peaceful; he destroyed evil-doers and established the
&gt; &gt; dignity of his office. Good at planning, he loved the common people and
&gt; &gt; wished to save their labour. He invented a water-power reciprocator, or
&gt; &gt; blowing-engine (shui phai), for the casting of agricultural
&gt; &gt; implements.&quot;

&gt; &gt;     The author concludes: &quot;If Newcomen's work is taken as the turning
&gt; &gt; point, the hidden pre-natal history of the reciprocating steam-engine
&gt; &gt; played a remarkably large part in its 'post-natal' history. For in
&gt; &gt; order to go beyond the single-stroke stage and the non-rotary stage,
&gt; &gt; currents of design were required which went back many centuries before
&gt; &gt; Newcomen and Watt. No single man was 'father of the steam-engine'; no
&gt; &gt; single civilization either - yet no-one comes nearer to deserving the
&gt; &gt; title than Thomas Newcomen&quot;.

&gt; Catch me if I'm wrong, but my reading of Needham on this does not
&gt; equate with what Pomeranz was claiming.  The basic concept behind the
&gt; steam engine was the change in pressure caused by the expansion of
&gt; water into steam, and the reverse change by its condensation back into
&gt; water.  The root of this, as I understand, were the 17th century
&gt; experiments with vacuum and atmospheric pressure. If I read Needham
&gt; correctly, none of this scientific understanding, nor any
&gt; experimentation or mechanical devices related to it, were present in
&gt; China.  However, some of the mechanisms used to harness this
&gt; principal- for example, those used for the double-acting principle and
&gt; the interconversion of rotary and rectilinear motion, appear to have
&gt; Chinese antecedents.

&gt; The closest thing I could find in Needham to a Chinese understanding
&gt; of the principles behind the steam engine is a passage from an ancient
&gt; Chinese book of magic that says that if you put boiling water in a
&gt; metal container, seal it, and toss it in a well, you will hear a loud
&gt; bang.  This certainly could have led to an understanding of
&gt; atmospheric pressure, had the author attempted to understand *why* it
&gt; happened, but it doesn't indicate that such an understanding in fact
&gt; existed.

&gt; Pomeranz's assertion that &quot;steam engines of a sort&quot; were found in many
&gt; societies, including China, seems so far as I can figure out be a
&gt; reference to the steam jet (basically, a heated vessel emitting a jet
&gt; of steam- for blowing up fires and stuff), which existed in the
&gt; ancient Mediterranean and central Asia- but not China, although
&gt; Needham speculates that they *may* have had it although there is no
&gt; evidence. At any rate, its not a steam engine, although it probably
&gt; inspired speculation in that direction.

&gt; I can find no evidence that the Chinese were just as likely to invent
&gt; the steam engine as England, but didn't because they didn't have the
&gt; luck of coal and industry close together like England, which is
&gt; Pomeranz's assertion. On the other hand, I find that Newcomen's
&gt; invention of the first commercially viable steam engine had roots in a
&gt; line of experimentation going back to ancient and later Renaissance
&gt; times, and given a crucial assist by 17th century science.  Thus,
&gt; England's bit of geological good luck undoubtedly helped, but some
&gt; kind of breakthrough seems to me  inevitable, while it doesn't seem
&gt; evident that Qing China was on the track to inventing it, geological
&gt; luck or no.  Anyway, that's just my take on it.

&gt; Early modern Europe seems to have been on a roll, innovationwise-
&gt; whether its technology, science, philosophy, politics...China at that
&gt; time apparently wasn't to the same degree- its previous spate of
&gt; technological innovativeness culminating in the Sung era appears to
&gt; have slowed down.  Why this was...is an interesting question.

&gt; (Some other things seem amiss with Pomeranz's argument. Although
&gt; Britain's situation was obviously conducive to the use of Newcomen's
&gt; steam engine, it also rapidly became used in continental Europe, ie.
&gt; France, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Sweden. And its not like China
&gt; didn't have coal although it didn't require draining like English
&gt; mines.  He notes that most coal were far from the economic centers of
&gt; the country, but then mentions some that was near the Grand Canal, but
&gt; that was inefficiently utilized because the government officials
&gt; arranged for it to be exploited by small-scale, ineffective mining
&gt; operations. Hrm...)
">

I got my information from Temple's abridgement of Needham, in which he
says the sixth century Old Manual of Metalurgical Water-Power
Technology by Kao Lung Chih stated that a "reverse" of the steam
engine involved a water wheel driving the pistons to produce a steady
and strong blast of air for metal-working furnances. The operation was
double-acting, ie compressing air in both parts of the stroke. Instead
of an "input" of steam compressed the "output" is air compressed.

Simple answer, it takes more energy to compress air than it does to
make steam.

I saw a bit on the History Channel last night about cars, the long
history of personal vehicles. One character sort of stood out,
Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish Jesuit who corrected the Chinese
calendar, attained the status of head of the Imperial Mathematical
Board, invented a steam engine for ships and is reputed to have made
either a trolley, thereby anticipating the railroad, or a steam car.
All in the mid-17th century.

http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/verbiest.htm

According to the SAE Bookstore, there is an even older vehicle, the
Verbiest Steam Turbine Vehicle, a steam-turbine-powered model which
ran in the 1600s!  Per the SAE, "in the early 1670's, Ferdinand
Verbiest (1623-1688), a Flemish Jesuit missionary in China and head of
the observatory of Peking, built a small working model of steam
turbine-powered vehicle which he demonstrated at the Chinese imperial
court and which may be considered as the oldest precursor of the
automobile".  A 1995 book by Horst O. Hardenberg describes Verbiest's
model.

The concepts are different.  The Chinese device was just a more
sophisticated application of the same concept behind bellows used for
1000s of years. The concept behind the steam engine requires knowledge
of vacuum and of the differing volume of water in a gas vs. liquid
state.

Interesting. If I recall, Needham has an illustration of the original
device.  Needham didn't believe it was inspired by anything in China,
though, so I don't know where Pomeranz got that idea from- I should
check Temple.  The early steam turbines, such as Heron's and Branca's
early 1600s model (which was basically a steam jut pushing against fan
blades), were not as I understand efficient enough to be of practical
use, but as a toy to impress the emperor I imagine it was quite
successful.

&gt; &gt; the steam engine as England, but didn't because they didn't have the
&gt; &gt; luck of coal and industry close together like England, which is
&gt; &gt; Pomeranz's assertion. On the other hand, I find that Newcomen's
&gt; &gt; invention of the first commercially viable steam engine had roots in a
&gt; &gt; line of experimentation going back to ancient and later Renaissance
&gt; &gt; times, and given a crucial assist by 17th century science.  Thus,
&gt; &gt; England's bit of geological good luck undoubtedly helped, but some
&gt; &gt; kind of breakthrough seems to me  inevitable, while it doesn't seem
&gt; &gt; evident that Qing China was on the track to inventing it, geological
&gt; &gt; luck or no.  Anyway, that's just my take on it.

&gt; &gt; Early modern Europe seems to have been on a roll, innovationwise-
&gt; &gt; whether its technology, science, philosophy, politics...China at that
&gt; &gt; time apparently wasn't to the same degree- its previous spate of
&gt; &gt; technological innovativeness culminating in the Sung era appears to
&gt; &gt; have slowed down.  Why this was...is an interesting question.

&gt; &gt; (Some other things seem amiss with Pomeranz's argument. Although
&gt; &gt; Britain's situation was obviously conducive to the use of Newcomen's
&gt; &gt; steam engine, it also rapidly became used in continental Europe, ie.
&gt; &gt; France, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Sweden. And its not like China
&gt; &gt; didn't have coal although it didn't require draining like English
&gt; &gt; mines.  He notes that most coal were far from the economic centers of
&gt; &gt; the country, but then mentions some that was near the Grand Canal, but
&gt; &gt; that was inefficiently utilized because the government officials
&gt; &gt; arranged for it to be exploited by small-scale, ineffective mining
&gt; &gt; operations. Hrm...)

&gt; I got my information from Temple's abridgement of Needham, in which he
&gt; says the sixth century Old Manual of Metalurgical Water-Power
&gt; Technology by Kao Lung Chih stated that a &quot;reverse&quot; of the steam
&gt; engine involved a water wheel driving the pistons to produce a steady
&gt; and strong blast of air for metal-working furnances. The operation was
&gt; double-acting, ie compressing air in both parts of the stroke. Instead
&gt; of an &quot;input&quot; of steam compressed the &quot;output&quot; is air compressed.

Yeah, I read about the same thing in Needham. Basically, as I've said,
the Chinese device anticipated the double-acting principle and the
transformation of reciprocating into rotative motion, which were
useful concept for fully utilizing steam power although the earliest
steam engines didn't have them. However, the Chinese lacked the
concept of utilizing the vacuum and the change in volume caused by the
transformation of water from liquid to gas and back, which was of
course the crux of the matter.  To say they were close to the steam
engine would be a little like saying that because someone had metal
tubes mounted on tripods with alt-azimuth gears, but didn't have
lenses, they were close to inventing the telescope.

I looked at Temple's book some time ago, and my impression was that it
had a polemical edge to it and ought to be read with caution. At least
that was my impression, although admittedly I did just skim through it
a couple years ago. Needham had, as he admitted, a tendency to take
his admittedly impressive facts and stretch them as far as possible
interpretation-wise, but Temple seems to have taken this to a whole
other level. Hence misleading statements such as "The essential design
of the steam engine, lacking only the crank-shaft, was invented in
China before the steam engine existed".

Perhaps Pomeranz read Temple and then, to look better, cited Needham
without really reading the original work carefully.

Maybe this is a cheap shot, but the fact that Temple (I'm not making
this up) wrote a book about human civilization being jump-started by
fish aliens, strikes me as a bad sign.  I find it baffling that the
popularization of Needham was left up to such a fellow.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rendition of an article and there is a line drawing illustration at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cite. Needham's original text &quot;The Pre-Natal History of the Steam
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Engine&quot; runs to 67 pages and coversChina, India, greece, etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An excerpt from the Society's Transactions

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The paper entitled &quot;The Pre-natal History of the Steam Engine&quot; by Dr
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Joseph Needham is published in Transactions of the Newcomen Society,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1962-63 Vol 35.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this paper the author proposes that many of the vital components of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newcomen's steam engine were anticipated by others, very many centuries
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earlier, and in quite different parts of the world. In this passage he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduces us to the 2,000 year old Chinese water-power reciprocator:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;Having dealt with cylinders, pistons, and valves I now propose to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show that the other kinematic half of Newcomen's child, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reciprocating steam-engine, was anticipated by, and even indirectly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derived from, a pattern which had arisen in medievalChinafor an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly inverse purpose.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Chinese water-power reciprocator, AD 31
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     The water-power reciprocator, or blowing-engine (shui phai)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     © copyright

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     When we ask about the earliest water-wheel in Chinese history we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come upon the paradox that it was not used for turning simple cereal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grindstones, but for the more complicated job of blowing metallurgical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bellows. This must mean that there was a tradition of millwrights going
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back some considerable time before even though we cannot trace it in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; literary references. The essential text, the Hou Han Shu, tells us:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         In AD 31, the seventh year of the Chien-Wu reign-period, Tu
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shih was posted to be Prefect of Nanyang. He was a generous man and his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; politics were peaceful; he destroyed evil-doers and established the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dignity of his office. Good at planning, he loved the common people and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wished to save their labour. He invented a water-power reciprocator, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blowing-engine (shui phai), for the casting of agricultural
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implements.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     The author concludes: &quot;If Newcomen's work is taken as the turning
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point, the hidden pre-natal history of the reciprocating steam-engine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; played a remarkably large part in its 'post-natal' history. For in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; order to go beyond the single-stroke stage and the non-rotary stage,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; currents of design were required which went back many centuries before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Newcomen and Watt. No single man was 'father of the steam-engine'; no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single civilization either - yet no-one comes nearer to deserving the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; title than Thomas Newcomen&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Catch me if I'm wrong, but my reading of Needham on this does not
&gt; &gt; &gt; equate with what Pomeranz was claiming.  The basic concept behind the
&gt; &gt; &gt; steam engine was the change in pressure caused by the expansion of
&gt; &gt; &gt; water into steam, and the reverse change by its condensation back into
&gt; &gt; &gt; water.  The root of this, as I understand, were the 17th century
&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments with vacuum and atmospheric pressure. If I read Needham
&gt; &gt; &gt; correctly, none of this scientific understanding, nor any
&gt; &gt; &gt; experimentation or mechanical devices related to it, were present in
&gt; &gt; &gt; China.  However, some of the mechanisms used to harness this
&gt; &gt; &gt; principal- for example, those used for the double-acting principle and
&gt; &gt; &gt; the interconversion of rotary and rectilinear motion, appear to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chinese antecedents.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The closest thing I could find in Needham to a Chinese understanding
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the principles behind the steam engine is a passage from an ancient
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chinese book of magic that says that if you put boiling water in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; metal container, seal it, and toss it in a well, you will hear a loud
&gt; &gt; &gt; bang.  This certainly could have led to an understanding of
&gt; &gt; &gt; atmospheric pressure, had the author attempted to understand *why* it
&gt; &gt; &gt; happened, but it doesn't indicate that such an understanding in fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; existed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pomeranz's assertion that &quot;steam engines of a sort&quot; were found in many
&gt; &gt; &gt; societies, including China, seems so far as I can figure out be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; reference to the steam jet (basically, a heated vessel emitting a jet
&gt; &gt; &gt; of steam- for blowing up fires and stuff), which existed in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ancient Mediterranean and central Asia- but not China, although
&gt; &gt; &gt; Needham speculates that they *may* have had it although there is no
&gt; &gt; &gt; evidence. At any rate, its not a steam engine, although it probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; inspired speculation in that direction.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can find no evidence that the Chinese were just as likely to invent
&gt; &gt; &gt; the steam engine as England, but didn't because they didn't have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; luck of coal and industry close together like England, which is

Don't rap non-science science writers, it's a tough trade.

IIRC Newcomen had the same problem with steam and water.
The Fleming's little car is an example of the typical Chinese approach
and what Needham tries to inflate into real science, they were really
into toys. Give the emperor some gadget to play with and you were in.
I sometimes wonder how many times that earthquake reading machine
