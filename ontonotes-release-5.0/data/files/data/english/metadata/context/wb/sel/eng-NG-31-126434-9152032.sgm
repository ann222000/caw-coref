Gossip

Evil twists like a rope-burned arm
When she and I talk old times
It’s subtle, before I sense the alarm
We’ve veered into one of their crimes

“Did I tell you what my nephew did
When left alone with his son?”
My adrenaline leaps, why was it hid
From me, his mother, what had he done?

Not wanting to enter, yet afraid to not go
I tremble, this is not mine to know
Yet, I reason, I love him I’m not his foe
And the Pied Piper of gossip I do follow

“No, was it bad?” I speak soft and low
As though to cushion the hurtful word
“Well, his father told me today” so and so
And off we go into what she has heard

Although she is not part of my family now
Our history links us. I love her as a dear friend
But I have to remember that I cannot allow
The chaotic talk as my fences I must mend

Just For Today
October 12                                                Being Right

&quot;When we admit that our lives have become unmanageable,
we don't have to argue our point of view... We no longer have
to be right all the time.&quot;         Basic Text p. 56

Nothing isolates us more quickly from the warmth and
camaraderie of our fellow NA members than having to be
&quot;right&quot; Insecure, we pretend to be some kind of authority
figure. Suffering from low self-esteem, we try to build
ourselves up by putting others down. At best, such tactics
push others away from us; at worst, they draw attack. The
more we try to impress others with how &quot;right&quot; we are, the
more wrong we become.

We don't have to be &quot;right&quot; to be secure; we don't have to
pretend to have all the answers for others to love or respect us.
In fact, just the opposite is true. None of us have all the answers.
We depend upon one another to help bridge the gaps in our
understanding of things, and we depend upon a Power greater
than our own to make up for our personal powerlessness. We
live easily with others when we offer what we know, admit what
we don't, and seek to learn from our peers. We live securely in
ourselves when we cease relying on our own power and start
relying on the God we've come to understand in recovery.
We don't have to be &quot;right&quot; all the time, just recovering.

Just for today: God, I admit my powerlessness and the
unmanageability of my life. Help me live with others as an
equal, dependent upon you for direction and strength.

We Stand - or Fall - Together

need for continuous effectiveness and permanent unity.  We
alcoholics see that we must work together and hang together,
else most of us will finally die alone.
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 563

Just as the Twelve Steps of A.A. are written in a specific
sequence for a reason, so it is with the Twelve Traditions.  The
First Step and the First Tradition attempt to instill in me enough
humility to allow me a chance at survival.  Together they are
the basic foundation upon which the Steps and Traditions that
follow are built.  It is a process of ego deflation which allows me
to grow as an individual through the Steps, and as a contributing
member of a group through the Traditions.  Full acceptance of
the first Tradition allows me to set aside personal ambitions, fears,
and anger when they are in conflict with the common good, thus
permitting me to work with others for our mutual survival.
Without Tradition One I stand little chance of maintaining the
unity required to work with others effectively, and I also stand
to lose the remaining Traditions, the Fellowship, and my life.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day by Hazelden/ October 12th

A.A. Thought for the Day

Am I still on a &quot;free ride&quot; in A.A.? Am I all get and no give?
Do I go to meetings and always sit in the back row and let
the others do all the work? Do I think it's enough just
because I'm sober and can rest on my laurels? If so, I
haven't gone very far in the program, nor am I getting
nearly enough of what it has to offer. I will be a weak
member until I get in there and help carry the load. I
must eventually get off the bench and get into the game.
I'm not just a spectator; I'm supposed to be one of the
team. Do I go in them and carry the ball?

Meditation for the Day

Try to be thankful for whatever vision you have. Try to
perform, in the little things, faithful service to God and
others. Do your small part every day in the spirit of service
to God. Be a doer of God's word, not a hearer only. In your
daily life try to keep faith with God. Every day brings a
new opportunity to be of some use. Even when you are
tempted to rest or let things go or to evade the issue,
make it a habit to meet the issue squarely as a challenge
and not to hold back.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that I may perform each task faithfully. I pray that I
may meet each issue of life squarely and not hold back.

Today's Thought
OCTOBER 12

You are reading from the book The Language of Letting Go.

Being Gentle with Ourselves
During Times of Grief

The process of adapting to change and loss takes energy.
Grief is draining, sometimes exhausting. Some people need
to &quot;cocoon for transformation,&quot; in Pat Carnes's words, while
going through grief.

We may feel more tired than usual. Our ability to function
well in other areas of our life may be reduced, temporarily.
We may want to hide out in the safety of our bedroom.

Grief is heavy. It can wear us down.

It's okay to be gentle with ourselves when we're gong through
change and grief. Yes, we want to maintain the disciplines of
recovery. But we can be compassionate with ourselves. We
do not have to expect more from ourselves than we can
deliver during this time. We do not even have to expect as
much from ourselves as we would normally and reasonably
expect.

We may need more rest, more sleep, more comfort. We may
be more needy and have less to give. It is okay to accept
ourselves, and our changed needs, during times of grief,
stress, and change.

It is okay to allow ourselves to cocoon during times of
transformation. We can surrender to the process, and trust that
a new, exciting energy is being created within us.

Before long, we will take wings and fly.

God, help me accept my changed needs during times of grief,
change, and loss.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Keep It Simple*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Be An Original

by Robert K. Cooper

I began my school life on the wrong foot. But at least it was my own
foot. I
have always wanted to learn how life could be and how the world really
works. Those things are not always emphasized in school curricula.

One of the unwritten codes I came to believe in was, &quot;If everyone
else is
doing it, don't.&quot; Through the years I have learned that when using this
approach many individuals in all walks of life have been able to call
forth
more of their best.

When we suppress our originality, we lose touch with the source of our
vitality and initiative. The greatest learning and achievements come not
from standardized group work but from the unique efforts of
individuals. In
this regard, the human spirit has its own set of rules. In many ways,
it is
rebellious. The imperative to live life differently, on our own
terms, keeps
building until it breaks through the surface. It is then up to us not
to let
it fade away.

When Rosa Parks refused to do what everyone else was doing on a December
evening in 1955, American history was forever altered. She had been
returning home on the bus, at the end of a long day of working. &quot;I was
sitting in the front seat of the colored section,&quot; as she tells it,
&quot;and the
white people were sitting in the white section. More white people got
on,
and they filled up all the seats in the white section. When that
happened,
we black people were supposed to give up our seats to the whites. But I
didn't move. The white driver said, 'Let me have those seats.' I
didn't get
up.&quot; Her courageous refusal to accept an inhumane practice has been
hailed
as a defining moment of the American civil rights movement.

Thomas Edison is another example. On his first day of school, Edison was
brought home by his kindergarten teacher, who told his parents, &quot;He's an
imbecile and unteachable.&quot; Edison remembers, &quot;I was always at the
foot of
the class. I felt my teachers saw no potential in me and that my father
thought I was stupid.&quot;

Virtually deaf, fired from countless early jobs, Edison purposely
marched in
the opposite direction of conventional thinking -- and as a result he
played
a major role in inventing the twentieth century. He left us with 6,000
inventions that changed the world, three million pages of notes and
diagrams, and is credited with founding scientific teamwork.

Another person driven to go against what everyone else was doing was the
&quot;Lone Eagle,&quot; Charles Lindbergh. Most of us know of him as the pilot
of The
Spirit of St. Louis, the first person to fly solo across the
Atlantic. Few
of us know that as a researcher at the Rockefeller Institute, he
amazed the
medical profession by inventing the blood centrifuge and the artificial
heart and lung. These life-saving devices grew from his deeply felt
desire
to do what others weren't doing. When no one else would fly a supply of
pneumonia serum from Wisconsin to Quebec to save the life of one of his
closest friends, he did it himself.

When the Cooper family council met to discuss my truancy problem, I was
firmly reminded that reading, writing, and arithmetic are important
skills,
and that a five-year-old doesn't get to make the rules. But I could tell
from a certain twinkle in my grandfather's eye that no one thought I was
entirely at fault, and from a certain sternness in my mother's look
that the
school officials would be encouraged to create a more hospitable
learning
environment for newcomers. I returned determined to make the best of
my time
in school.

As I continued asking questions and showing that I was willing to
work hard
at the things that mattered, it seemed that many of my teachers --
even Miss
Robinson -- began to go out of their way to treat me as an individual
instead of just one of this year's students on a class roster.

In fifth and sixth grade, I served on the safety patrol. I helped
protect
the other kids from strangers and cars, but I never chased down
anyone who
was running home. When I could, I talked with them or ran beside
them. An
independent spirit is never something to take lightly. Without it, no
one
stands out from the crowd.

Another of the things I learned about originality is that you can't
take it
for granted. If you want to keep your independence, good intentions or
willpower alone won't do it. It takes something rare but very
practical: a
mechanism that makes it a reality.

One Good Mechanism Beats a Hundred Plans
A distinctive, learning-filled life results from a succession of small,
specific choices made each day. There's a world of difference between
imagining such a fulfilling life and actually living it. It is through
taking new actions that we learn to awaken and apply our hidden
capacity. If
you know by doing, there is no gap between what you know and what you
do.

There's something in the way, however. A powerful part of the brain, the
amygdala, wants the world to run on routine, not change. Located
within the
limbic system, an ancient area of the mind that deals with the way you
perceive and respond to the world, the amygdala relentlessly urges us to
favor the familiar and routine. It craves control and safety, which
at times
can be vital. Yet the amygdala's instincts, which have evolved over
thousands of years, tend to spill over into every aspect of life and
promote
a perpetual reluctance to embrace anything that involves risk,
change, or
growth. Your amygdala wants you to be what you have been and stay
just the
way you are.

Unless you choose to consciously override this brain tendency, you're
consigned to repeating the past. One of the most effective ways to
get past
this limitation is to devise simple mechanisms that help you stand apart
from the crowd and reach for what you can yet become. A plan is a fine
intention or faraway vision. It may be inspiring, but by itself it
usually
doesn't amount to much. But once you have a clear sense of what you
want, a
mechanism actually brings it to fruition.

For example, there's a simple mechanism that overcomes our natural
resistance to growth or change and helps us be our best. All that is
required is to regularly ask these two questions:

1. What's the most exceptional thing you've done this week?

2. What's the most exceptional thing you will do next week?

You can ask each member of a group to answer these questions or you
can do
it alone -- you can schedule a weekly meeting with yourself (every
Friday
morning in front of the bathroom mirror, for example). The word
&quot;exceptional&quot; is defined however you want. It simply means, &quot;What
stood out
for you?&quot; or &quot;How did you go against the crowd?&quot; or &quot;What real
difference
did you make to the people around you or the world at large?&quot; Perhaps
this
week it was something big. Or maybe it was a kind word or an
unnoticed task
at home or at work that made you proud. It is the intensity that counts.
Take a moment to reflect on your answer: Was this the best you could
give?
Is there any way you could have given something more?

I learned the essence of this mechanism from my grandfather Cooper. On
Saturday mornings, when I was visiting or working at odd jobs around his
house, he would ask, &quot;What did you do this week that made you the
proudest?&quot;
He would listen to my answer and we would talk about it. From time to
time,
he would also tell me about answers he got from asking the same
question of
recently arrived immigrants that he hired. What I heard was both
humbling
and inspiring.

&quot;I saved a dollar this week for my little girl's first dress,&quot; one
said. &quot;My
brother has polio and can't walk,&quot; said another. &quot;The other night I
carried
him up to the top of the hill at the end of our street and we watched
the
stars come out.&quot; One man said, &quot;My wife and I skipped a meal and
brought it
to our parents who have little. When they asked if we had eaten, we
said,
'Yes, of course, we have had more than enough to eat.' &quot;

That's the other thing this simple mechanism does: It provides a
direct and
unexpected way to notice and value the unseen but important efforts of
others. Most of us never realize the number of times people lend a
helping
hand, go the extra mile, or perform some other act of kindness or
initiative
in the course of a busy week. Day after day, every one of us is
capable of
small yet exceptional acts of initiative and caring. When we live our
lives
in original ways such as these, we also come to realize that positive
behaviors are a primary driver of positive attitudes, not the other way
around.

At the end of our weekly conversation, my grandfather would say,
&quot;Next week,
Robert, what can you do that no one else will expect from you?&quot; He
taught me
what had taken him a lifetime to learn: Although we may dream about our
future in splendid images, we must live our lives in practical everyday
actions, one after another.

In all the times I have used this mechanism, I have never once
encountered
anyone who answered the two questions by saying that he or she had done
nothing exceptional this week and would do nothing exceptional next
week. Of
course, no one wants to look stuck or unimaginative, but it's more than
that. This mechanism stimulates a simple yet significant shift in the
way we
look at ourselves. It gets past good intentions and proclamations. It
prompts a deeper way of recognizing the times you could reach for the
exceptional.

If you ask yourself right now what you did last week that was
exceptional,
you'll probably have to think a while. When you establish the asking
of the
two questions -- what did you do last week and what will you do next
week --
as an integral part of your life, it can change your approach to
everything
you do. It steadily raises your sights about what you are capable of.

On Tuesday, you may be thinking, &quot;But I haven't done anything really
exceptional yet this week.&quot; This may prompt an inner response, such as,
&quot;Then I'd better think of something exceptional to do!&quot; This heightens
curiosity about the possibilities for taking new actions. You'll be more
likely to find yourself actively seeking ways to give the world more
of your
best, instead of just hoping for them.

Although studies indicate that people who regularly think ahead tend to
experience more frequent leadership opportunities and career
advancement,
this mechanism is about something deeper than the external trappings of
success. It keeps overriding the don't-grow-or-change instincts of the
amygdala and clarifies what makes you original and sets you apart
from the
crowd. It serves as a reminder that it is up to each of us to keep
finding
practical and visible ways to leave a meaningful imprint on the world
around
us and on the lives of the people we care most about.

The Cat Lady

I have lived in my neighborhood for twenty years. It
seems to me that I've spent at least ten of those years
looking for a lost pet, either mine or one I'd seen listed
in the newspaper's lost pet column.

Recently, I was at it again, going door-to-door looking
for one of my own lost kitties, a little black cat named
Nicholas who'd slipped out the door before I could stop him.
I made my rounds, visiting with all the neighbors,
describing Nicholas.  Familiar with this routine, everyone
promised to keep an eye out and call me if they spotted him.

Two blocks from my house I noticed a gentleman raking
leaves in the yard of a home that had recently been sold. I
introduced myself and presented my new neighbor with the
plight of the missing Nicholas, asking if he had seen him.

&quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;I've not seen a little black kitty
around here.&quot; He thought for a moment, looked at me and
said, &quot;But I know who you should ask.    Several of my
neighbors have told me that there's a woman in the
neighborhood that's crazy about cats. They say she knows
every cat around here, probably has dozens herself.  They
call her `The Cat Lady.' Be sure and check with her.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; I said eagerly.    &quot;Do you know where
she lives?&quot;

He pointed a finger down the street, &quot;It's that one.&quot;
I followed his finger and started to laugh.
He was pointing at my house!

Hi Scott, this is Gail D. in Syracuse, NY.  I was roaming
through my &quot;baby boy's&quot; room and found this poem in memory
of his friend shot down in 2002 to the gang violence in
Syracuse, NY. So this child is the son of an recovering addict
and I wanted to share his pain as he so eloquently told it.
Thanks, always in service Gail D.

IN MEMORY OF MIKE R.  &quot;REST IN PEACE&quot; 10/12/2002

When you are deep in the Streets
Real pain starts to happen
And boys will run, when the automatics starts to clapping

So I sit back and anticipate about my life
trying to invest in things, trying to make things right
When I look in the sky I see &quot;my man&quot; is in sight
So I get the pen out and start to write.

I look at the pictures on my walls, with ya smile so bright
and I know you watch me, when I sleep at night
You would be the first one to bang, when it's time to fight
and that's messed up cause now I finally see the light
When we chilled together, we were so tight........word up

This life is messed up, and why did you have to leave
This life is messed up, cause it's hard to grieve
This life is messed up, was the words that you said
This life is messed up, so many tears shed.......

It don't really seem like you slid
it just seems like you doing a long bid
but we can't forget that Becca had your kid.....
and to your kid my life I'd give
Can't nobody do quite like I can
So I'm trying hard to work out this plan
and word to me Mike, my heart goes out to you
how I cut our your pictures and news articles
and living this life is so hard to do.

But word to me Mike, I was apart of you
that's why I have a part of you because of the tattoo
on my right arm remembering you....

You may be gone now,
and all of our friends are writing songs referring to you
I'm saying my farewell in this poem to you

It was October 12th, on a Saturday night
I was getting toasted and everything was all right
Until I got a call in the middle of the night
Saying some little boy tried to take your life
They thought they stabbed you once but they stabbed you twice.

It's misery going through this pain
It's hard to sleep just trying to maintain
sometime's I feel like I'm going insane

But you play the cards you get dealt in this game
and these little boys out here still smell like sugar cane
It's hard to believe they live their lives so lame
you get no respect for being in a gang.......

When your confused
Which way to go

When no ones home
To keep you from a fall
Say a prayer maybe two
Turn to God
He will help you
We all get weary somedays
Especially when we are trying
To change our old ways

It will not get better
If you return to using

Nothing is so powerful as an insight into human nature?
what compulsions drive a man,
what instincts dominate his action.
If you know these things about a person,
you can touch him at the core of his being.
William Bernbach

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Let God and Let Go*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Some of us treat life like a spectator sport,
never budging from the sidelines.
As children of God, we are destined for something greater.
You are the one through whom God can love and create magnificence.
Step onto the field of your own life.
Mary Manin Morrissey

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Come*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The aging process has you firmly in its grasp
if you never get the urge to throw a snowball.
Doug Larson

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Come To*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Things do not change: we change.
Henry David Thoreau

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Come To Believe*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Learning is an upward, ever-evolving process.
We will never reach the point where we've learned all we need to know.
Every aspect of life contains lessons.
We can choose to discard them or to embrace them.
Lessons embraced lead to wisdom.
Mary Manin Morrissey

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Look For The Beauty*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The program-it works if you work it.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Today Is A Gift*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Take the program seriously, not yourself

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Keep Stepping*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Work the program, not the problem.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Stay In The Light*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

It’s not easy to find happiness in ourselves....
It is impossible to find it elsewhere

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*One Promise, Many Gifts*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
