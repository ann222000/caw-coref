From the Office of the Fire Chief...

All of the recent cases bring attention to the challenges facing the
Fire Department and our need to be vigilant in addressing the issues
that are involved.

Since my appointment to the position of Fire Chief, I have focused my
efforts and the efforts of the entire Department towards improving the
work environment throughout the organization.

To that end:

- I am personally visiting every work location (40 thus far) to
emphasize the importance and the Department’s expectations of all
members in maintaining a positive, professional work environment.

- Ongoing Human Relations training for all Department members has been
made a top priority and has been expanded to four hours for the upcoming
quarter. This training is provided to all members, from recruits in the
academy to the most senior members of the Department.

- Investigations of work environment complaints are being reviewed
promptly by EEO professionals, and early intervention is being made to
mitigate the issues that appear to bring about litigation.

- A re-organization and enhancement of the Department’s disciplinary
system is underway that includes specific disciplinary guidelines for
consistent penalties, the creation of EEO and internal investigative
units, and enhanced complaint and disciplinary tracking, as well as a
risk management component to monitor and analyze trends for the
development of preventive measures.

The challenges facing our Department are not easily solved. However, we
remain committed towards making improvements that will be permanent and
will demonstrate our dedication to providing a workplace that values and
respects all employees.

Let me conclude by stating that the overwhelming majority of Fire
Department members work and live together everyday in a close,
family-like manner and faithfully serve the communities of Los Angeles
with the highest degree of professionalism. Their positive actions and
behaviors should not be minimized or overshadowed.
