Had your gin-soaked raisins today?
KAT BERGERON
McClatchy Newspapers

What do gin-soaked raisins and copper have in common?

Answer: Both are touted as natural or folk remedies for arthritis.

Forty-six million Americans have arthritis in some form or another,
and those who do know arthritis can be painful, slow you down, and in
some cases, be debilitating. The Centers for Disease Control reports
that in this country, arthritis limits the activities of more than 17
million adults.

No wonder so many "home cures" exist alongside more modern
pharmaceutical medications and pain relievers. In addition to copper
bracelets and golden raisins soaked in gin, there are such commonly
heard suggestions as magnets, drinking apple cider vinegar, eating
fresh pineapple, and taking gelatin and shark cartilage, to name a
few.

Such folk cures - nonconventional or alternative medicine as some call
it - persist through generations, despite the lack of supporting
medical studies to prove whether they actually work. You likely heard
about them from your grandparent, or a work colleague, or a neighbor,
or a tennis buddy. Some purported cures, like the gin-soaked raisins,
are cyclical in their popularity.

"They persist because on some level they do help because they have
anti-inflammatory properties and people will notice some modification
of inflammation and pain," said Jim Borden, a certified nutritionist
associated with Five Seasons, a health food market in Ocean Springs,
Miss.

"But what I tell people is that with such things as raisins they're
only getting a little bit of a piece of their puzzle, and they need to
look further into how to prevent their health problems and how to
maintain better heath by controlling diet. Proper nutrition for your
body type is important. You need to know about yourself."

Primer on arthritis

So here's a quick primer on arthritis, which literally means
"inflammation of a joint." The word comes from the Greek "arthron" for
joint, and "itis" for inflammation.

Inflammation is the natural swelling that is the body's response to an
injury or infection or irritation. But with arthritis, the body's
natural defense mechanisms run amok and the usual infection-repair
roles are reversed to attack the body instead. That's what causes the
pain of arthritis.

That said, there are more than 100 types of arthritic conditions,
including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis,
fibromyalgia, lupus, and Lyme disease, to name a few. The most common
is osteoarthritis, which the Arthritis Foundation says affects 21
million, and is often associated with aging and affects weight-bearing
areas such as knees.

Folk cures persist

Despite a slew of modern arthritis meds and despite naysayers of
nonconventional treatments, folk cures persist and continue to
intrigue the afflicted. Finding their origins is no easy task, with
raisins as a case in point.

In the 1990s when popular radio announcer Paul Harvey mentioned the
raisin, there was a run on golden raisins and gin, and it has returned
in several cycles of popularity, including in 2006. Political pundits
had fun in the last presidential election when Teresa Heinz Kerry,
wife of candidate John Kerry, reportedly mentioned the gin raisins.

Some people buy regular golden or white raisins in the grocery but
some also seek out health food shops, like the one where Borden works,
in search of organically grown raisins because they prefer to avoid
sulfites common in processed dried grapes.

Although the formula varies slightly according to what Web site you
check or what person you talk to, the basics are simple: Eat nine gin-
soaked raisins a day. Without that scientific placebo-controlled
double blind study, proving the efficacy of this folk cure is hard.
It's literally word of mouth, but that is the way of folk medicine.

Borden explains one possible reason for the persistence of the gin-
raisin remedy.

"It's like making an extract of resveratrol, a flavonoid found in
grape skins," Borden said. He points to a Harvard study that shows
mice with resveratrol in their diet are thinner and healthier and have
longer life span. He also points out that the substance is found in
grape juice, grape wine and other raisins, and that you can buy
resveratrol extracts.

That's the way of these folk cures. There's often more than one
source.

Folk cures at a glance

-In the fields of natural or folk medicines, here are a few commonly
cited remedies for arthritis pain and swelling. Each of them, over
time, has been tried, dropped, followed, scoffed at, poo-pooed and
yet, despite any medical evidence to support the validity of the
remedies, touted.

Special note: As in any non-traditional medicines, the user should use
common sense and his own research, including possible consultation
with a physician, before starting new treatments.

Gin and raisins: Take a box of golden raisins (sometimes called white
raisins); place in shallow container; cover raisins with distilled
gin; let soak for a few weeks until gin evaporates; place in jar; eat
nine raisins a day. (Note: nine is the number you see most often, but
you'll also see variations).

Apple cider vinegar: Two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in 8
ounces of water, three times a day. Some people sweeten with honey or
add baking soda for pH balance. (Note: EarthClinic.com says it if you
stop taking this remedy for a few days, the symptoms return.)

Gelatin: You can buy animal gelatin capsules or you can make gelatin
(the store variety like Jell-O) but instead of chilling it, drink it.
Some suggest drinking a cup a week, then more as you become accustomed
to it. Some people make concoctions with grape juice and pectin (a jam
thickener, such as Certo, that contains gelatin powders).

Fresh pineapple: Eat fresh pineapple frequently for the bromelain, an
enzyme found in fresh pineapple (freezing or canning is thought to
destroy the enzymes so eat fresh). Bromelain can also be purchased in
capsule form as a supplement.

Copper bracelet: Some believe that copper is absorbed by the skin to
relieve joint pain when wearing a copper bracelet but the results are
anecdotal and effects controversial. If you wear one, you might want
to avoid the ones with anti-tarnish coating.

Magnets: Static magnet therapy is believed to relieve pain by
increasing circulation, but that has not been proven by scientific
studies. About.com says magnetic treatment is generally considered
harmless unless it causes people to forgo other needed medical
treatments.

IN THE NEWS

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association
has found for the first time that brain exercise strengthens the
ability of seniors to think more clearly and perform everyday tasks
needed to continue living independently. Healthy seniors who had just
10 hours of classes to improve their reasoning powers reported having
significantly less trouble than others with cooking, shopping and
other activities, the study showed - and the benefits were still
present five years later.
