Another Alliance uniform chose that moment to enter the room, halting Armin at
the door. The newcomer wore a hassled expression and no insignia on a
simplified uniform that suggested an admin or intelligence role. From the
glimpse he caught through the door, it seemed there was something going on in
the corridors outside. Wash would've liked to call it a disturbance and imagine
it was his own gorgeous warrior wife leading the rescue operation, but it
seemed strictly more of a 'bustle' than a disturbance.

&quot;What's going on?&quot; Armin demanded.

&quot;Problem with waste disposal, lieutenant...&quot; The man took in Badger, Wash and
River disinterestedly, then his attention caught, and stayed, on Badger.

&quot;Problem?&quot; Armin prompted impatiently.

&quot;Sewers, sir. Seem to have backed up. With, er, gusto. Bit of a mess.&quot;

&quot;For God's sake, get it cleared by the time they get here.&quot; Armin looked a mite
on the hassled side, now, too.

&quot;Yes, sir, that was... They've signalled their expected arrival in ten
minutes.&quot; The officer's eyes had returned to Badger, who slunk down further
into the bench, and his forehead furrowed. &quot;These are the three prisoners, sir?
The fugitives? The brother and sister? Simon and River Tam? *These*?&quot;

&quot;*Yes*,&quot; Armin said. &quot;What's - ?&quot;

&quot;That - &quot; he pointed &quot; - isn't Simon Tam. His name's Badger - I processed him a
couple of years back on smuggling charges. He's one of the more colourful
pieces of the local lowlife.&quot;

***

His back slammed against the wall of the interrogation room, and he heard a
pistol drawn - a moment later, smooth metal pressed to the side of his head. &quot;I
won't ask you again,&quot; the lieutenant said. &quot;Your little stunt may just have
killed every man on this base, so don't think I'll hold back from pulling this
trigger. Now, *where*... is Simon Tam?&quot;

The girl's dark eyes rose up in his mind, looking through him. The pilot's
desperate, cracked voice replayed: &quot;*Don't tell them anything! They'll kill you
anyway*.&quot;

&quot;Don't!&quot; Badger gasped around the grip constricting his throat. &quot;It's Malcolm
Reynolds you want - captains this pile of *go se* firefly... *Serenity*!
*Serenity*, he calls it; laid up in docks right now, seeing as that's his
rutting pilot you got in there. Your fugie kids... they're on his gorram
*crew*.&quot;

_Chapter 4_

&quot;I reckon we're breaking, oh, about a hundred traffic laws here,&quot; Kaylee said
cheerfully, from where she was hunched over all kinds of mechanical and
chemical components, some of which Book recognised and some he didn't, &quot;But not
to worry. Persephone's Alliance air police force catch on, we can always ditch
the junk and say I was drivin', then that's just drunk in charge.&quot; She
cautiously placed a tray with a tiny pile of powder on it at arm's length, and
used a spoon to scatter an even smaller fraction of another powder over it. The
resulting conflagration, though he'd been expecting it, still made him jump.

&quot;Whoo! That one near took my eyebrows off. Yup, the stuff's still good.&quot; She
grinned up at him. &quot;Y' reckon Simon'll still think I'm pretty with no eyebrows?
There's a fair bit more going into the main feature than this little
explosion.&quot;

&quot;I'm sure he would,&quot; Book said. &quot;But right now, eyebrows are hardly the most
pressing matter.&quot; Whatever Simon had given Kaylee to wake her up, it had kicked
in with a vengeance. Trying to keep a girl who was high as a kite fixed to the
ground long enough to safely handle quantities of highly combustible
materials... well, it wasn't the best distraction for a man who hadn't flown
much of anything in years trying to guide an unfamiliar shuttle through a
tricky manoeuvre.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Kaylee swallowed, nodded with purpose and made an effort to at least ape
his gravity. &quot;Got to get River and Wash back. I know that. You - &quot; She waved a
pointing finger vaguely his way. &quot;You just keep hovering right where y' are.&quot;
She finished scraping together the components and stood up, wavering slightly
more than the shuttle was doing. She crossed to the hatch and flung it wide,
shouting something back that was lost into the night air and the suddenly much
louder engine roar. She pulled her head back inside to repeat it: &quot;Need to lose
just a little altitude - not too much, mind, 'less we want to be wedged in to
the wall of that 'scraper as a permanent feature. Fun for the tourists.&quot;

Book eased the little ship very gently down. &quot;Left a bit,&quot; Kaylee supplied. &quot;No -
no - whoo! Almost had us fried, there. That's good. Keep her... just... like...
that...&quot; She checked the silent comm clipped to her belt with a pout. &quot;Sure
hope the cap'n and the others are on schedule. I figure we got about fifteen
minutes tops hovering up here 'fore someone reports us.&quot;

She dipped her body out of the shuttle, reaching for the unseen jagged silver
towers of the power substation mounted atop its sculpted near-mile-high post.
Out of view, the structure was a mere scatter of digital information to Book.

They'd had to disable two hovering warning buoys to get this far, and any plan
involving Kaylee leaning out quite that far over quite that much nothing in her
current state was a plan made Book uneasy. Occupied with the controls as he
was, there wasn't anything he'd be able to do if she lost her balance. They'd
had to disable half the auto functions just to get up close to the substation.

Kaylee all but disappeared a moment, in which it took all his restraint to keep
the ship steady. But she bobbed up again breathing heavy and pulled herself
right back inside the shuttle. He was sure he breathed more a sigh of relief
than she did. &quot;Some good old-fashioned sabotage,&quot; she said, wiping off her
hands again. &quot;Can't stray far, I'm afraid. With this much energy around to be
causin' interference, we'll have to be all but on top of this little pop-bomb
to set it off remotely. Oh, don't worry, though - should have three or four
seconds to get clear 'fore it goes, and it ain't that big.&quot; She sank down on
her haunches next to the shuttle's open hatch. &quot;Now all we need is word from
the captain.&quot;

&quot;And soon,&quot; Book observed, as the shuttle juddered under his hands.

Kaylee agreed. &quot;This goes wrong and all those large, violent types the cap'n
brought back won't be thinking too well of me. Mind, considerin' if this goes
wrong there ain't none of us gonna see the light of day again long enough to
care 'bout things like that, I guess that's one thing at least I can quit
worryin' over.&quot;

***

&quot;Mr Grey, Mr Halloran,&quot; Lieutenant Armin greeted the two men respectfully. He
tried to remain unmoved by their flat stares and the distraction of their odd
gloves, though they always made his skin feel like it was being crawled over
inside by a thousand tiny, unsavoury things. &quot;I hope your journey went well. I
didn't expect to see you here so soon - &quot;

&quot;So we gather.&quot; The taller man on his left spoke, but their disapproving
expressions were the same, and it seemed to him it wouldn't matter which spoke,
in either case what emerged would be identical. &quot;Some trouble with the
plumbing.&quot; On anyone else, it would have been amusement. But it wasn't.

&quot;A programming glitch. The city's systems are automated.&quot; Armin made to turn
and lead the way. &quot;I'll take you to the prisoners.&quot;

A raised blue hand stalled him, made him swing back over-quickly and betray his
unease. &quot;Isn't there something else you want to tell us first, Lieutenant
Armin?&quot; The man he knew as Mr Grey was toying with something long and thin in
his hands.

&quot;We hear that isn't the only trouble you've been having,&quot; prompted the man he
knew as Mr Halloran.

Just like he'd known would be the case, the voice was slightly different, but
the words were exactly the same.

***

&quot;Thunder,&quot; River said, into the silence that followed the scream. Her head
turned not to the door beyond which it had originated, but raised to the
ceiling, as though her stare might penetrate right through it, and through the
buildings overhead, up into the empty sky beyond.

***

&quot;*It ain't like with the lassiter, or on Ariel,&quot; Kaylee had said, all of them
'round the table 'round her. &quot;We started out on those jobs with all the
details. Here what we have's just guesswork, though Shepherd Book helped fill
in some blanks.*&quot;

*Jayne snorted at that last, and the preacher avoided meeting anyone's eyes,
looking consummately neutral.*

*Kaylee continued, &quot;Most Alliance offices and installations are built to a
standard set of layouts and specifications - only way they could do it, speed
they whammed most of the things up during and after the war. Managed to get a
sense of the basic plans and layouts from off the cortex, figuring what space
and materials they've had to work with here on Persephone, but we can't count
on 'em too well...&quot; She lay the plans out anyhow, in front of Mal.*

&quot;*What about their security?&quot; he asked.*

*She grimaced, which was answer enough. &quot;Functions - power and water and the
like - we had more luck with. Can't get to their auxiliary power or into
security direct, but I can take down the power for the block. There should be a
few seconds while it makes the transition over to their emergency stores. We
figure the main part of the base is underground, beneath that little office
space on the surface, so if I hit their power at the right moment, we can use
that to get inside the outer security perimeter, at least. Like I say, we're
going in blind here. Gonna have to improvise.*&quot;

&quot;*Then we'll improvise,&quot; Mal said. &quot;You just get in place, and we'll figure a
time frame.*&quot;

&quot;*Oh,&quot; Kaylee added with a quick grin. &quot;And I... could also back up their
drains, if you like. Real easy, in fact.*&quot;

&quot;*Might distract them more'n a little in itself,&quot; Mal agreed neutrally.*

He gunned down the uniform blocking their path and ducked just in time as Zoe
threw a grenade on one hell of a short fuse. &quot;Who you tryin' to blow up?&quot; he
asked, coming to his feet in a sharp turn to get the man rising from behind a
desk.

&quot;Just keeping you on your toes.&quot; She smiled, and they made it through the end
of a corridor didn't seem to particularly lead anywhere, shooting the guard
stationed at the end and entering an oasis of calm as Badger's men put in a
good showing for themselves behind them. &quot;This should be it.&quot; She reloaded
quickly, her eyes staying on the corridor they'd just come down, while Mal
examined the door the dead man had been guarding. &quot;It's not like there's
anywhere else left to search if it isn't. Not an overly large building,
sir.&quot;

Mal searched the man's pockets, briefly attempting to decipher the purpose of
various keycards, but everything indicated that a more subtle entry would
require more figuring than they had time for. Jayne rebounded off the corner,
firing behind himself and cursing as a shot singed his T-shirt but left his
skin intact. Mal called him over.

&quot;This it?&quot;

&quot;It'll have to be.&quot;

&quot;Good doors. Reinforced. All that looks a fancy piece of work, too.&quot; He nodded
to the control pad at the doors' side.

&quot;All relies on power.&quot; Mal flashed him a forced smile. &quot;Guess the Alliance have
gotten complacent now the war's over and they ain't expecting any all-out
attacks.&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh. Easy as pie next to that fancy pad of Niska's. This place sure as hell
wasn't made for a war... What's complacent?&quot; Jayne dropped the bag he'd been
hauling along extra to the weight of his own portable armoury and Mal joined
him sifting through the contents 'til they both held wrenches, while Zoe
stepped aside and concentrated the rifle in her hands on the task of guarding
their backs.

Mal set the wrench in place, carefully, and lifted the comm to his mouth.
&quot;Kaylee? Now.&quot;

He heard her chirpy assent, &quot;Yessir!&quot; even as the comm was falling to bounce
among the overspilling contents of the bag on the floor.

There was a delay long enough to make them all feel a bit foolish and then to
catch them by surprise when the lights flickered and dimmed, and the ambient
hum of power from the many machines about the place died, never so noticeable
as when they were gone. Mal planted the wrench and hauled the doors wide,
matched by Jayne doing the same the other side. As the emergency power was
kicking in, Jayne was swapping his wrench for Vera. The mechanisms had been
blasted all to hell by the time the lights were back on full, just
nasty-smelling smoke in the air. Mal hung onto his side of the door as it
continued its attempt to shut automatically and Jayne swore and flung a
shoulder against his side. Then, as the connections finished frying and the
last of the power drained, the resistance choked up, doors hanging stuck in
place.

Zoe had Simon and a half dozen of Badger's people gathered with her. Only one
sported any injury of note, one of Badger's men who'd a bloody, charred patch
at his shoulder. He saw her ordering two of them in place to guard their
exit.

&quot;Jayne,&quot; Mal prompted.

The merc held up the grenade, which had been prepared with a little something
extra taped around it.

&quot;Heads down,&quot; he said, with a broad grin, as he hurled it into the shaft.

***

&quot;You told them, didn't you?&quot; He leaned in closer to Badger to hiss the words
while the guards were uneasily paying the larger portion of their attention to
the door. They hadn't seemed surprised by the scream, almost like it wasn't
anything they hadn't heard before, but it had made them jittery. Taking the
opportunity to vent some of his anger at Badger at least distracted his mind
from the cold chill that had snaked itself through him at what he'd heard in
that scream.

&quot;Of course I told 'em,&quot; Badger snapped. &quot;What the hell do you think?&quot;

&quot;Of course he told them,&quot; River said, with an odd patience, her voice all her
own again now there was no call for subterfuge. &quot;It's what he does. It's the
way the 'verse turns.&quot;

&quot;In his world, maybe - the world of the snivelling little big-talking lowlife
creep - &quot; Somehow, his fury descended into a brief shoving match composed
mainly of elbows, which ceased abruptly when one of the guards turned.

&quot;Some people juggle geese.&quot; River's lips moved slowly, and she stared straight
in front of her, but Wash would've laid good odds her gaze didn't fall on the
wall.

&quot;That's my l - &quot; he began, but she was talking again, her hands squirming
against the cuffs. &quot;They're here.&quot; A plummeting fear in her voice, that matched
the fear and pain in those screams. But then something else anew imbued the
words' quiet repeat, as her body calmed. &quot;They're here...&quot;

***

&quot;*Once we're inside,&quot; Mal said, &quot;We shoot to kill. Everything Alliance is a
target. No mercy - we can't afford it. They're stronger'n us and they won't be
hesitating. I want you all to understand that. Odds are bad enough as they are
without having to watch the wounded we leave at our backs, and what's more
anyone we leave can potentially identify at least Wash and Badger, and maybe
more of us.*&quot;

The words reverberated in his head, following Mal and Jayne down the narrow,
difficult access ladder set into the side of the elevator shaft. Simon tried to
bury any thoughts along the lines of how he should have gone with Kaylee and
Book that might - hypothetically - be trying to enter his mind. It didn't
matter that a gun still felt unwieldy and alien in his hand, because what he
was here for was River. When they found her, she might well need him. He'd seen
her panicked, seen her when the medication failed. He had no particular faith
in the ability of the captain or Jayne or even Zoe to coax her away with them
if things were bad. At least... not in any fashion it didn't make him wince to
contemplate.

He went a step too far on the ladder and trod on Jayne's fingers while Mal was
still disembarking at the bottom. The mercenary cursed him in imaginative
Chinese while he tried to stammer an apology.

&quot;*Bi zui*!&quot; Mal hissed up at them both.

There wasn't enough space for everyone on the floor of the shaft. Mal motioned
Simon back up onto the ladder, replacing him with a gunman from Badger's group.
&quot;Now I'm guessing,&quot; he said, &quot;that someone up there could've sent the alarm
down, even if they didn't hear us coming. Reckon we best reckon on one heck of
a welcoming committee waiting on the other side of these doors.&quot;

Jayne and Zoe moved like they read his mind and each other's, each taking up a
wrench and a position either side of the doors. Mal produced some grenades,
palmed one and handed the others to a tall, black-skinned gunman behind him for
safekeeping. &quot;Everyone keep clear the middle of the shaft.&quot; To Zoe and Jayne:
&quot;One... two...&quot; They wrenched open the doors the barest fraction, not more than
a hand's breadth. Mal activated the grenade and rolled it through. A shower of
bullets pinged off the doors and, a few, the back of the shaft. Soon as Mal's
hand was out of the way, Jayne and Zoe let the doors close. The explosion shook
them violently a second later.

&quot;Go!&quot; Mal said, and this time the two of them hauled back hard, forcing the
doors full open. Mal and those of Badger's gunmen on the ground poured through
and took position, while Simon was jostled by those wanting to get down from
the ladder.

&quot;Oh, damn, this place smells bad,&quot; Jayne said.

&quot;Think that might be Kaylee's doing,&quot; Mal called, already lost up ahead
somewhere in the shifting dust from the explosion.

Simon found himself sticking close to Jayne, the only familiar body anywhere in
his vicinity, proof enough that the world really had gone mad if that made him
feel safer, and belatedly drew the gun he'd holstered in order to climb.

&quot;Point that at somethin' in grey,&quot; Jayne growled, taking pause from shooting at
a flash of uniform to eye the gun in Simon's hand distrustfully.

&quot;I told you, you can trust me,&quot; Simon responded, annoyed. &quot;It doesn't mean I'm
not still angry with you, but I'm not about to shoot you.&quot;

&quot;It ain't what you'd do on purpose worryin' me,&quot; Jayne said, sourly.

&quot;Oh.&quot; There was no reply he could make to that.

The grenade had clearly done damage to masonry and men both, but in dealing
with the immediate threat it had also brought more attention running down on
them. Simon supposed there was nothing more like to catch the attention of
reinforcements than very loud explosions. He flinched as Jayne, grinning like a
kid in a toyshop, shot a man who'd ventured around the corner in front of them
square in the face. Jayne enjoyed his work.

Zoe on the other hand was a businesslike killer, no emotion in her face when
she pulled the trigger. Old soldier. Only Mal, against Simon's expectation,
displayed the odd glimpse of reluctance or disgust in his face, if that was
indeed what they were. Jayne and Zoe, he had seen go to war before, of
course... He grimaced, remembering his own negligible contribution to that
firefight, as well. Mal, he had seen only in scuffles and brawls.

Mal seemed to be noting with growing frustration the layout of the corridors he
pressed them onward through. Finally, he swore. &quot;Doesn't match the plans Kaylee
dragged up near enough. Don't know where the hell we are. Time for a new plan.&quot;
He called across to Jayne, &quot;We need us one still living.&quot;

Jayne nodded, and lowered his aim only to get a scrape across his shoulder for
his trouble. &quot;Gorram it, Mal, I sure hope you're lettin' me kill this one
later,&quot; he growled, advancing quickly to kick a gun out of a sprawled hand. The
downed man's other hand had fingers pressed tight against a hole in his thigh,
but it had missed shattering the bone and wasn't bleeding enough to have hit an
artery. Only painful. Simon's own leg twinged in sympathy.

&quot;We'll have to see about that.&quot; Mal hauled up the injured Alliance man and
slammed him back against the wall. &quot;Where are the prisoners? The girl and the
two others?&quot;

His answer was an unsurprising silence. Without hesitation, Mal blew a matching
hole in the man's other thigh, nothing betrayed in his face at all now. &quot;Where
are they?&quot; he demanded again, while the man hung gasping and Simon gaped. &quot;Got
no reason to kill you, you tell us straight. You don't... you still got two
fine and undamaged arms I ain't touched, not to mention other appendages.&quot;

&quot;Corridor C6, room 6B8,&quot; the man choked. Mal studied him a moment, gave him a
tight nod, then raised his pistol and shot the man in the head. Simon rocked on
his feet, feeling it like a physical punch. Nobody else reacted at all.

&quot;Why did - ?&quot; Simon began, angrily and more than a little self-consciously.

Mal's stare showed that dead something in his eyes that occasionally rose up to
make itself clear. &quot;He would've remembered me. Attention I don't need. Too easy
to trace, records the Alliance still have on anyone who fought in the war.
Would've left all of us in danger. No mercy, if you recall.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Simon said slowly. He avoided looking down at the gun he hadn't fired
yet.

***

Wash's heart all but *stopped* when he heard the distant gunfire. Sweet Jesus,
they hadn't run, they hadn't... Were they *insane*? You didn't go up against
the gorram Alliance armed with Jayne's fetishist gun collection and a box of
old grenades the captain kept bolted to the roof of one of *Serenity's*
crawlspaces. Not with their crew, less fighters than weren't. Not even if the
preacher was really a rutting ninja assassin killing machine in that big secret
past he'd been hiding from them all. There was just no way.

It had to be something else. It had to be.

Badger was watching the door, puzzled, and their guards' agitation was
increasing, though they held to their posts. River had crossed her ankles and
she gazed at the floor between them, her pursed lips exuding concentration.
Concentration in her case could mean anything - for all Wash knew, she could be
counting the molecules in the synthetic floor beneath their feet.

Her head jerked up sharply.

&quot;Wouldn't want to forget me, so far from home,&quot; she blurted, like coming in on
the middle of a speech, and her voice had a soft burr now that might've been
spawned somewhere like Bradley or Londinium. &quot;That's what she said, but you
did, didn't you? Lost the thing, because after all a thing was all it was,
wasn't it? A useless piece of a trinket and you could afford better yourself
even then, even in those last days kitting out for the war. Thinking of a glory
in body-counts like collecting scalps. She didn't mean anything, really, it was
all in her head, not any in yours. Stupid girl. She sent you letters to the
front, but the last one wasn't written by her. But sure, she didn't mean
anything anyway, it could only be something about the fighting that set it in
your thoughts and wouldn't let it leave. Why you took it out of that browncoat
bitch who looked a little like her. Let the feel of her dying under you as you
slit her throat after take all the memories away.&quot;

The guard her eyes pinned flinched and all but dropped the gun in his hands,
and the other looked at him uneasily.

&quot;What did you - ?&quot; The first moved a step forward, out of position.

&quot;Don't,&quot; the other said. &quot;It's some kind of trick. You know what the orders
are. No talking, no touching. You heard - &quot; His head tipped toward the door,
and he shuddered, a tiny convulsive judder that shook his shoulders.

&quot;She... you can't...&quot; Raw anguish and fury. He shook off his fellow's
restraining hand and caught up River by a fistful of her hair, making her
shriek and struggle and try to bite.

The bullet cut him down almost before the door had finished sliding back. The
second guard managed to half raise his gun before Jayne, a step behind Mal,
shot him in the head. The gun he was using didn't leave much of anything of the
head, and Wash ducked away from the splatter that speckled his hair. Crazily,
what came to his lips was &quot;Must you?&quot; in the same aggrieved sort of tone he'd
use when Jayne exercised his lack of table manners.

&quot;Well,&quot; the mercenary said, stroking his gun like he was telling it it was a
good girl. &quot;There's a nice thank-you. Think we should shut the door again and
turn right around, Mal?&quot;

Mal had a keycard dangling on a chain and what looked like someone's finger in
the hand that wasn't gripped around his pistol. He ignored Jayne, kneeling next
to a fallen guard to search for keys, finding them on the second guard. A
fighter Wash didn't recognise backpedalled past the open door shooting Alliance
men, and Simon scooted in after, bent over almost double, crossing straight to
his sister's side.

&quot;What's going on?&quot; Wash asked with some disbelief, his voice rising to a higher
pitch than he generally considered could pass as manly.

&quot;Cavalry, Wash,&quot; Mal said, matter-of-fact, jiggling the keys around to a
right-looking selection, hampered by the fact he kept a hold on his gun. He
hauled on Wash's shoulder to turn him around and worked on the cuffs a moment;
swore and had to switch keys twice before they finally fell loose. He moved on
to River, and Simon folded his sister into his side as soon as she was loose,
his body blocking her from the open door.

&quot;Your people... and my people,&quot; Badger said, incredulous, as Mal set him loose.
&quot;Shooting up the gorram Alliance? What the hell have you done?&quot;

&quot;Saved your sorry backside, among other things,&quot; Mal pointed out.

&quot;But why?&quot; Wash asked.

&quot;Needed the extra men - &quot; He broke off. &quot;Best of limited options. No time for
talkin'. Reckon we should start moving about now.&quot; A renewed frenzy of gunfire
and a warning shout - Zoe's voice, Wash recognised, and his heart jumped with
equal joy and fear - turned Mal's head toward the door.

&quot;Definitely about now,&quot; the captain amended.

***

&quot;Go!&quot; Mal pushed Zoe ahead of him, seeing as how the husband she was supporting
looked like he'd collected a bit of Alliance justice about the face. Ahead of
them, Jayne and one of Badger's folk led the way in a deadly partnership, Simon
and River hanging just behind along with Badger, who'd armed himself with a
dead fellow's gun.

&quot;Where the ruttin' hell are they all coming from?&quot; Jayne growled.

&quot;Must be more down here than we thought. Maybe another entrance somewhere,&quot; Zoe
said breathlessly, turning a moment to help return fire at those coming from
the corridor behind the cells. The henchman of Badger's who'd been helping out
at the rear was gurgling on the floor, shot through his throat. Most of the
rest of them were up ahead somewhere, probably halfway to the surface by
now.

&quot;You concentrate on getting Wash and River out,&quot; Mal said again to Zoe.

She nodded tightly, and turned and tried to hustle her husband along faster.
And it wasn't playing fair with her, Mal knew full well. But he needed them out
and safe to get everyone else flying free, and things were starting to get
themselves just a little bit too frantic.

He ducked as a hail of fire came at him from an unexpected direction; a
corridor they must've diverted 'round trying to cut them off, and come almost
too late. He sure wished he had a better idea 'bout the layout of the base. He
tried to return fire with no cover to speak of. A shot drew a fiery scrape
along his ribs. One, two, three more shots of his own, and two of the uniforms
on the ground, then the hollow note of an empty chamber he could least afford
right then.

&quot;Take him alive,&quot; ordered a voice that sent a chill through him, and while he
backed away like a fool with his empty gun in his hand, able to do precisely
nothing as they abandoned their cover and approached, someone fired an air
compression rifle. The impact knocked him into the wall and he rebounded off it
to roll over the floor, landing almost at their advancing feet.

Feet clad in black, and not Alliance grey. He blinked, trying to focus his eyes
to look upwards. Saw only the blur of a huge blue hand as it descended.

***

&quot;Nice flyin',&quot; Kaylee said, as Book finally managed to get the shuttle righted
and the floor and the ceiling resumed their more usual positions.

&quot;I lost them, didn't I?&quot; He could feel the sweat starting to dry on his brow.

&quot;Yep. That's... what I meant.&quot; She nodded encouragingly. &quot;Sure you don't want
me to take...&quot; She faltered, slumping in her seat, and her hair hung limply
around her suddenly pale face as she seemed to concentrate hard on breathing,
which she did in deep gasps. &quot;Not... feeling so well, preacher.&quot;

Book nodded grimly, and reached across to the passenger seat to gently pat her
arm, although he had to cut the gesture of comfort short to ensure they didn't
end up upside-down again - or, in fact, a pretty fireworks display and a burnt
smear on the side of a building. &quot;Simon mentioned that would happen. It'll
pass.&quot;

&quot;I sure hope he stuck a 'soon' on the end of that.&quot; Kaylee curled over
miserably, then jerked to one side and retched onto the shuttle floor. Book
winced at the noises. The smell wasn't the most pleasant in the confines of the
small shuttle, either. &quot;Sorry.&quot;

He sighed and smiled. &quot;Not to worry... I think Jayne pulled cleaning duties,
this week.&quot;

She managed a weak giggle, but it faded fast. &quot;Hope he's still alive to do
'em,&quot; she said.

&quot;Not working for nobody,&quot; Mal said, gasping against the grip the two feds had
on each of his arms. He surreptitiously studied the blue-gloved freaks' blank,
set faces. &quot;Just came in to spring the boss, is all.&quot;

The nearer of the two, the tall one - his lip twisted. Kinda dismissive of a
move, like he really didn't care. Like he knew he already had the answers.
&quot;Your boss, then?&quot;

Mal thought about it for all of a second, then shook his head fractionally, not
letting go the man's eye. Setting a trail to Badger would betray them all in
the end, anyway. Even if...

&quot;'Badger',&quot; the fellow said smugly. He drew something out of his coat; toyed
with it in his hand. It wasn't a gun. &quot;The man your 'boss' was working with.
Malcolm Reynolds. What do you know about him?&quot;

&quot;Reynolds? *Hun dan* Independent type with a giant-size stick up his *pigu*?
Boss used him the odd job here and there, is all. When he was hard up, you
know?&quot; His voice cracked as the man on his right twisted his arm harder. &quot;Why?
You got some trash you need to offload on the cheap?&quot;

&quot;As it happens,&quot; the second of the men said, amused.

His fellow freak raised the thing he'd been toying with, snapping it level in
his hand a few feet in front of Mal's face. The men holding his arms slammed
him back against the corridor wall hard enough to daze, then got clear fast.

&quot;What the hell - ?&quot; Mal began, staring at the thing, and coughing a bit of a
nervous laugh. It didn't look like any kind of a weapon. &quot;That s'posed to
frighten me?&quot;

There was something dribbling down his upper lip. He raised his fingers to it,
confused. Felt an odd pressure building inside his head as he brought them away
painted with blood.

***

&quot;No... no... *no*...&quot; Without warning, River began to struggle in his grasp, as
they waited tucked into the side of the elevator. Zoe and Wash were already on
the ladder and starting the climb. Badger crouched at the other side of the
door with his stolen gun. Jayne leaned against the wall a way down the
corridor, looking uneasily back where they'd just come from.

&quot;We're getting out of here,&quot; Simon told her, setting his hands to her
shoulders, trying to quiet her panic.

&quot;No!&quot; she screamed, shoving out of his grip entirely and falling to her knees
on the floor, in too-full view if anyone were to round the corner and get a
shot off before Jayne could drop them. Her eyes were so wide they all but
bugged out of her head, and her hands convulsed against the floor, fingers
scraping so hard he saw nails splinter. &quot;The captain...&quot;

&quot;What's up with her?&quot; Badger asked, jerking his head. Almost looking like he
wanted to go to her, but didn't dare.

&quot;I - &quot; They had no time to spare for Badger. &quot;River...?&quot;

She screamed, her hands reaching up to her face and twining, tugging, in her
hair.

&quot;Zoe!&quot; Simon spun, shouting up the ladder, changing tack. He could see her boot
heels in the dark shaft, above Wash's broader form. &quot;Zoe! Something's wrong. I
think Mal - &quot;

River's cry took on a raw note of furious antagonism, rising to drown him out.

***

Mal was slumped, sliding slowly down the wall and tasting blood, feeling it
thick and cloying 'gainst the back of his throat, when his tormentor wavered,
hands rising to his head, giving a rattling cry.

He had enough left in him to lash out with his foot, twisting it around the
man's leg and yanking it out from under him. He spun, falling, arching the
device over his blue-gloved partner and the Alliance men behind him.
Off-balance from the manoeuvre, and in the absence of the immobilising pressure
the weapon had seemed to induce in every cell in his body, Mal slid all the way
to the floor.

The Alliance folks were complaining mightily at getting a taste of their own
medicine, and Mal didn't feel sorry for them one bit. His vision was a kind of
hazy red-edged affair, and nerve-memory of the pain still lingered throughout
his body, but the overall weakness he felt was the only thing that threatened
to kill him now. He clawed his way along the floor as those behind really
started screaming, getting well clear before he tried to stand. Tried,
couldn't, glanced back to see that the faces of those he'd left behind him were
masks of blood, their bodies twitching in what sure as hell looked like the
last spasms of life... He scrubbed a hand over his own face, stared at the
blood that decorated it in small streaks... and continued clawing his way back
to the elevator, one hand-span's scrap of ground at a time.

Pressed himself into the floor and stilled as running feet approached, but
raised his head as he heard Jayne swear. Simon, coming out of the merc's
shadow, drew an audible breath.

&quot;Captain?&quot; The doctor was down at his side in an instant. &quot;What happened? River
wouldn't let - &quot;

Mal caught Jayne's ankle as he made to explore the way behind him. &quot;Don't go
back there.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Jayne agreed, looking freaked. He knelt down, shoving the doctor out of
the way in the process, then looked down at Mal and the gun in his hand, and
screwed up his face in reluctance before dumping the monstrosity - Vera - into
Simon's empty arms, clearing his own to gather up Mal.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Simon protested, casting the weapon one helpless frown then ignoring
it. &quot;He's hurt - I don't know that this is - Jayne, he's bleeding from his
*eyes* - &quot;

&quot;No time,&quot; Jayne said, voicing Mal's thoughts exactly. &quot;Take a good hold of
Vera, doctor. Cap'n's a heavy sumbitch. Won't be able to drag him and keep the
feds off us at the same time.&quot;

Simon nodded and gamely tried to set his hands correctly on the weapon and hold
it like he was threatening. Mal loosed a ragged laugh.

When he was hoisted over Jayne's shoulder, he curled his fingers convulsively
in the damp cloth of the merc's T-shirt, fighting the sensation of vertigo the
motion brought on, and didn't pass out.

_Chapter 5_

&quot;Come in, *Serenity*,&quot; Inara tried again, with growing impatience and - maybe -
just a touch of concern she would admit to. &quot;This is shuttle one, coming in to
dock... Request acknowledgement... Damn it, Mal, answer me.&quot;

But there was no answer. True enough, the dawn was still a clear band on the
horizon, but Mal usually kept a watch while on a world like Persephone, even if
he wasn't awake himself already. And she could see that shuttle 2 was missing.
Biting down on her lower lip, she punched in the automated docking codes and
guided the shuttle back to its familiar rest. *Serenity* accepted her, locking
them into place with a mechanical grind followed by a swift, sharp 'ker-chung'
that reverberated through the smaller ship. Inara finished powering down,
gathered her robe tighter around herself as she stood, and caught up a gold
rope-belt to tie around it. Then she headed purposefully through the door that
marked the boundary where her domain ended and Mal's began.

*Serenity* seemed to be sleeping soundly, her power on low. Inara trod the
walkway, bare feet casting a dull metallic ring down into the void of the cargo
bay below with every fall. She aimed for the passenger quarters first, and knew
there was something wrong when she found them dark and empty, doors gaping
open. Shepherd Book might conceivably have taken the time to visit the local
abbey, but there was no reason for Simon or River to leave the ship at all -
and every reason for them not to.

She found weapons laid out in the kitchen, but what was there looked like the
dregs someone had decided not to arm themselves with. &quot;Mal?&quot; she called, trying
anyway. &quot;Malcolm!&quot; Further on up the ship, the crew quarters were a match for
the passenger ones, and the bridge was silent and unoccupied.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Inara muttered, and gave a small sigh. &quot;What have you involved
yourself in now?&quot; She stood on the empty bridge, her robe no protection against
the shiver that seized her. Hesitating, she wondered what to do - if there was
anything she *could* do.

But even as she lingered, she heard a faint, familiar sound resonate throughout
the ship, and felt the equally faint vibration that partnered it travel up into
her bare feet. Shuttle 2 had just docked.

Taking a steadying breath, Inara returned along the length of the ship, and in
her haste almost bumped into Shepherd Book as he emerged from the shuttle port,
Kaylee supported at his shoulder.

&quot;What happened?&quot; was her instant shocked reaction, but Book was already shaking
his head against her initial fear.

&quot;She's not hurt. Only had a little too much to drink earlier tonight, and...
it's complicated.&quot;

&quot;Shh, sweetheart,&quot; Inara said, folding Kaylee into her arms as the girl moaned
unhappily. &quot;And the captain?&quot; she asked, already able to see the shuttle was
empty behind Book. &quot;Where's Mal? And everyone else?&quot;

The preacher smiled, grim worry underlying. &quot;There was some Alliance trouble.
River was spotted and taken. Captain's out springing her and Wash now.&quot;

&quot;Against the Alliance?&quot; She remembered the scatter of weapons on the table.
&quot;Has he lost his mind completely? You're surely not telling me that Mal's gone
into an Alliance enforcement station with all guns blazing?&quot;

&quot;Had to get River,&quot; Kaylee mumbled, trying to straighten. &quot;And Wash. Simon and
Zoe... well. And, hey, need to fly this thing, right? 'Sides, it woulda been
all of us, he said. Every one of us with a price on our heads sooner or later,
we didn't go. They'd tell 'em. Wouldn't be able to help it, in the end.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Inara agreed breathlessly, feeling very cold as the full danger crashed
over her. &quot;Yes, it would be. So Mal...&quot;

Book laid a hand gently on her shoulder. &quot;I'm sure they'll be - &quot;

The main door clanked below and Zoe's voice unmistakeably floated up, issuing
orders. Inara laughed weakly. &quot;Don't tell me, preacher... you have informers in
very high places.&quot;

He glanced innocently upward. &quot;Perhaps.&quot;

&quot;Oh, good.&quot; At her breast, Kaylee gave a little sigh of relief and relaxed so
much Inara thought for a moment she'd passed out, and struggled to stop her
ending up on the floor because little Kaylee was heavier than she looked.

&quot;Here.&quot; The shepherd awkwardly took Kaylee back, and inclined his head down
toward the growing commotion in the cargo bay. &quot;I'll get her to the kitchen and
pour some coffee into her. You go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

As she began to descend, she could see Simon and River dragging something dark
inside, pulling it into the shadows to the edge of the bay. They both looked
unusually animated, their voices hushed but clearly delivered with fervour.

&quot;It's necessary - &quot; Inara caught, as River tugged at whatever it was. Her face
pinched in annoyance, she glared up at her brother.

Simon spoke so quietly she heard only fragments. &quot;I don't see how... the
captain... we should at least...&quot; The doctor dropped their burden entirely and
halted, his open palms underlining his objections as he waved them in helpless
protest.

&quot;Simon!&quot; His sister continued to struggle alone until he reluctantly resumed
his aid.

Inara stepped off the ladder, staring over her shoulder at the pair and
wondering if she ought to intervene. Then Wash stomped in, complaining loudly
to Zoe over his shoulder, and she had to sidestep in fear of a collision. The
marks on his face momentarily wiped all else from her thoughts.

&quot;I mean, why? What is this? Is it me - you don't think it's something about me,
do you? What if I have... 'torture me' vibes? I'm just saying, it could be a
growing problem.&quot;

Zoe caught him at the base of the stairs. The smile on her face had anger
simmering not far beneath it. &quot;Their problem, when I catch up to them, dear.&quot;
She leaned in to him, faltering her purposeful stride to cup her husband's
bruised face and kiss him. She cut the gesture short and broke away
apologetically as he flinched.
