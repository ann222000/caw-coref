This is one of nearly a thousand substantially identical messages sent

While we (tinw) all know a particularly obnoxious sporger
(Mmpppffppfmpmffmpp) and there are some things about these posts that
look like his style, such as forged approvals for moderated groups, the
targeting of a specific service (in this case Supernews), and the use of
a different nonsense sentence for both the .sig and Organization header
for each message, which one would get from NewsAgent, the general
pattern doesn't look like him.  Instead, it reminds me of Gigatroll, who
would send customized articles to hundreds of groups, each crossposted
to a single target group in addition to the group for which it was
customized.

While this current crop of posts is more repetitive in its content yet
more sophisticated in its generation, it shares some key similarities to
previous Gigatroll floods, in particular the customization for the
target ostensible group, the inclusion of a real target group (in this
case, sci.crypt), and the flooding of hundreds of groups in a single
day.  None of these characterize the sporgeries of Mmpppffppfmpmffmpp.
Therefore, I don't suspect &quot;the usual suspect&quot;.  Instead, I suspect
Gigatroll.  If so, then he deserves recognition for being the busiest
(if prodigeously lame) troll on USENET.  However, I'm willing to wait
for other opinions before nominating the lamer.  Any other hypotheses?

BTW, the person who seems to have swallowed hardest on this troll is L.
Bill Hughes III of rec.autos.makers.jeep+willys, who is currently on the
AUK ballot for Kook of the Month and Goofy Azzed Babboon.

These are strafing runs, not prolonged trolls, so they last a week at
the longest.  Usually it's only a few days before the sockpuppet account
created for the purpose is shut down.  The the perpetrator lays low for
a few months to a year, morphs, and repeats the process.

Finding the prankster (trust me, it's really just a prankster, although
he seems to be escalating by targeting moderated groups and forging
approval headers) will be difficult because of the running away and

The &quot;subject&quot; lines, the &quot;content,&quot; and the &quot;senders&quot; are all

Somebody with an apparent name, crosspoasted in by our own Dear
George, threatened r.a.p. with such a spooge flood last week.
It might have been a swimmer, it might have been a pisswit, I
don't remember beyond the threat to &quot;shut down the froup&quot; (unusual)
with a &quot;flood.&quot;  The syntax of the &quot;threat&quot; indicated familiarity

&gt; &gt;&gt; day.  None of these characterize the sporgeries of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Mmpppffppfmpmffmpp.  Therefore, I don't suspect &quot;the usual suspect&quot;.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Instead, I suspectGigatroll.  If so, then he deserves recognition for
&gt; &gt;&gt; being the busiest (if prodigeously lame) troll on USENET.  However,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm willing to wait for other opinions before nominating the lamer.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Any other hypotheses?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi, Wild Bill!  How's that hook in your lip feel?

&gt; &gt; So how long does an attack generally last?

&gt; &gt; Whoever it is, it's now hit on rec.arts.poems - us rappers need to track
&gt; &gt; down this sucker so we can take our revenge on it in the traditional
&gt; &gt; manner - chaining it to a chair and playing endless recorded loops of
&gt; &gt; mediocre &quot;poems&quot; at it until it draws its last breath.

Certainly not this bit of fantasy from our &quot;Prof.&quot; Hammes:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Somebody with an apparent name, crosspoasted in by our own Dear
&gt; George, threatened r.a.p. with such a spooge flood last week.
&gt;    It might have been a swimmer, it might have been a pisswit, I
&gt; don't remember beyond the threat to &quot;shut down the froup&quot; (unusual)
&gt; with a &quot;flood.&quot;  The syntax of the &quot;threat&quot; indicated familiarity
&gt; with machine generation, or as least with spam remailers.

Not only is &quot;Prof.&quot; Hammes unable to remember any details, he's unable
to produce any such crossposted message.  For a good reason; there
wasn't any.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This is one of nearly a thousand substantially identical messages sent
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to nearly a thousand newsgroups so far.  All of them have followups to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sci.crypt.  Notice that the link below takes one to the 100th page of

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; While we (tinw) all know a particularly obnoxious sporger
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (Mmpppffppfmpmffmpp) and there are some things about these posts that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; look like his style, such as forged approvals for moderated groups,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the targeting of a specific service (in this case Supernews), and the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; use of a different nonsense sentence for both the .sig and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Organization header for each message, which one would get from
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; NewsAgent, the general pattern doesn't look like him.  Instead, it
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reminds me ofGigatroll, who would send customized articles to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hundreds of groups, each crossposted to a single target group in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; addition to the group for which it was customized.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; While this current crop of posts is more repetitive in its content yet
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more sophisticated in its generation, it shares some key similarities
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to previousGigatrollfloods, in particular the customization for the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; target ostensible group, the inclusion of a real target group (in this
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; case, sci.crypt), and the flooding of hundreds of groups in a single
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; day.  None of these characterize the sporgeries of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mmpppffppfmpmffmpp.  Therefore, I don't suspect &quot;the usual suspect&quot;.

Another of &quot;Litt D.&quot; Hammes' delusions... reminds me of when he was
sure that Barbie Cat was a creation of Tom Bishop's &quot;poetry
generator&quot;.

This was of course before Barbie was &quot;fixed&quot;, and became the biggest
slurper in r.a.p. history.

&quot;Perhaps I made it sound like I was complaining, however I was doing
just the opposite. This world would be a much better place if
everyone was just a little like Barbara. I am happy and grateful to
be solely owned and operated, declawed and neutered, and
house-broken by her. &quot; -Barbara's Cat
