I live in Florida, and the damp air seems to really speed up the tarnishing
process. I cannot keep ahead of it.
My particular concern is a large, ornate brass coffee table (with wrought
iron legs), that my dad &quot;up north&quot; used to polish weekly. It is really
dingy, and shows rings from people's glasses, etc. I've POURED brasso on it
and scrubbed and scrubbed but I cannot get that lovely look it had when I was
growing up.
I've thot of using muriatic acid - as that works real well with chrome, etc.,
outside - but don't know if it is ever used to clean brass, or copper for
that matter (yes, I have copper I can't get really clean as well...).
I need to find either an easy to use method of cleaning, or some way to have
it done commercially where they clean and lacquer (?).
I welcome any and all suggestions.
Thanks-
Mal in humid - but nice and warm (&lt;G&gt;) - Florida

You need to find a better polish than Brasso ... something like
&quot;simichrome&quot; or one of the other paste polishes. The other thing you might
try is a good paste wax, like Butchers Wax and using #0000 steel wool
polish it well. The wax finish may retard the tarnishing a bit. I
hesitate to recommend having it polished and lacquered, but if rapid
tarnishing continues to be a problem that may be a long(er) term solution.
Any metal polisher should be able to do that for you. The problem with the
Lacquer is that it darkens and eventually fails, especially in areas of
wear so that you end up with parts of it tarnishing and parts still shiney.
If lacquered, the old coating would have to be removed, the piece
repolished and then re-laquered.

BRASS &amp; COPPER

It is the specific cleaner for brass, copper, brass-plated and bronze.
It does not contain corroding or abrasive acids. We recommend to clean
very big surfaces.In fact, this chemical compound permits an almost
immediate cleansing through contact, less shining but easier to
obtain. It is very often convenient to use B &amp; C for a first cleaning
and then to use Look! to polish.
INSTRUCTIONS
Moisten the surfaces you need to clean with cotton wool.Wait for a few
seconds, and polish with a clean and soft cloth.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
LOOK

It is a scentless product based on very smooth abrasive pastes and
paraphin(ed) solvents. It comes from the rielaboration of an ancient
formula that in the past was probably used at the Celliniâ€™s shop. It
is able to remove any crust and oxidation, even the most resisting,
and to restore the original brightness of the object, as well as you
can obtain only by laborious mechanical brushing. It is very good for
gold, sterling silver (925%0), copper, brass, bronze, pewter,
chromium-plated surfaces and hard plastics such as perpex and
plexiglass. It is extraordinary to get rid of scratches from plastic
objects such as GUZZINI.
The product is recommended also for the maintenance and the
restoration of ancient coins, in fact, it does not contain either
acids or corroding substances. Coins just polished with Look! may
appear too bright, then, it will be enough to rinse them out with
water and to wipe them off. After a few days their patinas will
reappear. We recommend goldsmiths, silversmiths, dentists for use on
the polishing machine instead of other abrasive pastes.INSTRUCTIONS
Pour little of the product on a cloth and rub the object
energetically. It will immediately develop a dark residue. Keep on
rubbing for some seconds and then wipe it out and polish with a clean
cloth in order to remove released oxidations. Look! contains neither
acids nor ammonia, therefore you do not need to rinse out after
cleaning.

CARE
It is ideal for preparing the object for a perfect silver-plating. Do
not use Look! to polish silver-plated or gold-plated surfaces, because
its abrasive action could remove the thinnest platings. Apply it
safely on silver-plated Sambonet, whose thickness is of 36 microns.
