New York's lead consumer advocate is asking Sprint Nextel Corp. to
pay a penalty to wireless customers it is terminating because they
called customer service too often.

Reacting to news that Sprint has told about 1,000 customers they will
lose their wireless service on July 30, the New York State Consumer
Protection Board suggested the carrier pay those customers $200 each
- the amount the customers would have had to pay if they had
prematurely ended their two-year contracts with the company.

The Reston, Va.-based company, with operational headquarters in
Overland Park, Kan., said it will zero out the customers' accounts
and not charge any termination fees. But Mindy Bockstein, the board's
chairwoman and executive director, said that's not enough.

&quot;These former Sprint customers will have to purchase new phones and
incur other expenses and inconveniences if they want to continue
receiving wireless service,&quot; Bockstein said. &quot;Sprint Nextel should do
more to improve the quality of its customer service and this is a
good place to start.&quot;

Seems only fair that if Sprint elects to terminate early they should pay
the customer the same penalty that th customer would pay if they elected
to quit.  &quot;But that's not in the contract,&quot; you correctly point out. One
of the jobs of the Consumer Advocate is to level the playing field where
a single customer has no negotiating juice.  Let's see how they prevail.
I showed up for a dental appointment one Saturday and his office was
closed.  When I called them on Monday they were very apologetic. I
pointed out that had I been the no show they would have charged me so
since they were the no show they should clean my teeth for free. They
did.

They won't prevail- all Sprint has to do is point to a number of similar

Umm, Sprint _faced_ a class action suit when they
pulled that garbage.

There used to be an early GSM
offering by Sprint called &quot;Sprint Spectrum&quot;.

They shut it down. Customers sued. Sprint settled
and paid off. Don't recall teh amounts, but it
was still a cost to them.

See the recent conversion of ATT Wireless and Cingular conversions from
TDMA to GSM.  In that conversion, customers got letters very similar to the
ones being discussed here.  &quot;Dear Customer, we are shutting down the TDMA
network on &quot;x date&quot; and will no longer be providing service.&quot;  No action by
the State of New York.  While the Sprint Spectrum case could be considered,
the inaction by the State of New York in these other instances sets the
precedent.

A network conversion falls under &quot;assigns &amp; successors&quot; which most
contracts specify as being OK.  To unilaterally terminate a customer
who's accounts are current is very different.  If not liable for the
$200, which by the contract they are not, they maybe liable for other
damages.  What kind? Well, let's say you had a really good plan that was
maybe grandfathered from a long time ago. If switching forced you into
paying more for the same service they might be liable for the extra
costs.  Furthermore, if their plan included unlimited calling to other
Sprint customers and, because of that, they got all their friends and
family to sign up with Sprint, there may be damages for the increased
usage not just for the cancelled subscriber but for the friends and
family that now have to pay to call him.  The feature set offered by
Sprint is advertised as being unique and if that's true, the sub may
have a claim for damages because he can no longer obtain those unique
services from another services (i.e. push-to-talk walkie-talkie service
on the Nextel network).

My point is that if the subsciber is in good standing, meaning bills
are paid timely and there's been no violation of the contract terms or
other binding covenants, the carrier's early termination could certainly
lead to claims for damages and legal fees from lots of angry customers.
In fact, Sprint might find it advantageous to just pay the
$200/cancelled sub if it buys them immunities from other causes of
action related to termination.

No- that would be a merger or buyout.  The same company switching

Whose unilaterally terminating current customers?  Although Cingular and

markets.

Once the original contract expires, there is no agreement to break.  A

If you have signed a Verizon agreement (I haven't looked at the others)
what you signed says:

AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE WILL APPLY IF YOU CHOOSE TO END YOUR SERVICE
BEFORE BECOMING A MONTH-TO-MONTH CUSTOMER, OR IF WE TERMINATE IT EARLY
FOR GOOD CAUSE.

That is, the ETF may apply if they terminate you, not just if you
terminate them.  Verizon's &quot;good cause&quot; includes, but is not limited to,
the following:

You agree not to resell our service to someone else without our
prior written permission. You also agree your wireless phone won't
be used for any other purpose that isn't allowed by this agreement
or that's illegal. You agree that you won't install, deploy, or use
any regeneration equipment or similar mechanism (for example, a
repeater) to originate, amplify, enhance, retransmit or regenerate
a transmitted RF signal. WE CAN, WITHOUT NOTICE, LIMIT, SUSPEND, OR
END YOUR SERVICE OR ANY AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THIS OR ANY OTHER
GOOD CAUSE, including, but not limited to: (a) paying late more than
once in any 12 months; (b) incurring charges larger than a required
deposit or billing limit (even if we haven't yet billed the charges);
(c) harassing our employees or agents; (d) lying to us; (e) interfering
with our operations; (f) breaching this agreement; (g) &quot;spamming,&quot; or
other abusive messaging or calling; (h) modifying your wireless phone
from its manufacturer's specifications; (i) providing credit information
we can't verify; (j) using your service in a way that adversely affects
our network or other customers; or (k) allowing anyone to tamper with
your wireless phone number.

That covers just about everything.  The thing the Sprint customers are
being terminated for is probably covered by (c) or (e) (not that the
&quot;good cause&quot; they terminate you for needs to be listed).  (h) probably
covers the things people do to their Verizon phones to restore features
that Verizon removed.

Oh, and then there's

WE EACH AGREE TO SETTLE DISPUTES (EXCEPT CERTAIN SMALL CLAIMS) ONLY
BY ARBITRATION.

which kind of limits what your lawyer can threaten them with.  They've
covered themselves pretty well.

Perhaps, but to be fair, what about a Sprint Blackberry or Treo owner?
He might have paid $200-400 for his subsidized phone, and would have to
pay a similar amount to get essentially the same phone with a new carrier-
the Sprint CDMA model is incompatible with T-Mo's or Cingular's GSM, and
Verizon (like Sprint) refuses to activate phones sold by another carrier,
even if 100% compatible.

Now if Sprint is also willing to refund what a customer paid for their
high-end phone, fine, but I have a bit of a problem with this &quot;firing
customers&quot; idea when they're under contract.  Sprint was happy to sign
them up and never gave them a customer service call limit.  If they want
to terminate them after the contract is up, and/or stop them from renewing,

fine, but they didn't break any rules- CS is 24/7 and free according to
all the brochures.
I better way to handle the &quot;problem&quot; would've been to flag the accounts
so when they called CS about an often lodged complaint, the reps could
just explain &quot;we've already tried to satisfy your needs on this
particular issue and were unable to.  In the interests of customer
service we'd like to offer you the ability to end your contractual
commitment without any penalty should you choose to...&quot;

If CS &quot;stonewalled&quot; these 2000 customers with the above script, they'd
get the message and cancel on their own.

&gt;&gt; Shouldn't we as consumers be able, unilaterally, to say to Sprint et
&gt;&gt; al., &quot;You are a bad business to do business with, you've proven it
&gt;&gt; time and again, so our contract is null and void&quot;?

&gt; Of course not. If you want a contract that's written that way, start
&gt; your own wireless carrier and offer it.

&gt;&gt; Unilateral contracts are a nice concept for the corporation, but if
&gt;&gt; they push on that they'll get pushed back on.  &quot;We can do anything
&gt;&gt; we want, you just have to pay us money until we tell you you don't
&gt;&gt; have to&quot;--that's not a contract, that's crazy.

&gt; Agreed, but no one was forced to agree to it, were they? That goes for
&gt; any of the wireless companies.
">

I think that's why the NY Consumer Advocate is getting involved.  What
Sprint is doing is not in the contract and customers didn't agree to it
so it's just bullying.  Believe me, as a business owner myself I'm all
for keeping government out of my affairs but when a business that is a
public utility takes advantage of a group of customers who have no
voice, that's when a Consumer Advocate should step in to protect those
who have no voice.  Remember, judges can take any part of a contract
they feel is unfair and toss it out as &quot;against public policy&quot; and, by
law, any ambiguities are always interpreted against the party who wrote
the contract.

And now it will be up to the AG's and Consumer Advocates to decide if
there definition meets muster.

On the other hand, if I found it necessary to constantly call customer
service to resolve issues, I would probably be thrilled to get a free
early termination so I could hook up with a carrier more to my liking.

I like the idea a previous poster had where a constant caller could be
politely told, &quot;Sir/Ma'am, we just don't seem to be able to satisfy your
needs and expectations so we'd like to offer you the opportunity to
switch to another carrier with no early termination fee.&quot;

True, but they signed them up expecting to act somewhat close to a normal
industry customer.  Nobody would expect a customer that calls 40 times more
than average.  More than ten times a day (on average), month after month?
My take is that they are these folks a favor- they are obviously too stupid
to own a cell phone if they need that much help.

And costs the business about a dollar a minute. So, I see three options for
Sprint:

1.  Continue to take the loss month after month and lose millions of
dollars a month.

2.  Keep the customers and simply pass the costs of serving them to every
other subscriber through price increases.

3.  Get rid of the dead weight.

Only one of the three options has any benefit to the customer base.

Read the media articles again- they are bad customers because of their
inability to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer.  Asking for information off somebody
else's account, continuing to call after being told multiple times that
their issue was resolved, being told that there was nothing more that
Sprint could do for them and their problem... number of calls was simply a
flag and not the sole criteria for cancellation.

It wouldn't surpise me to find that a good number of the customers
cancelled were the type that continually hounded CS for two months of free
service to compensate them for the inconvenience of having to dispute a
$1.29 directory assistance charge or some other ridiculous request.

&gt;&gt;&gt; time and again, so our contract is null and void&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Of course not. If you want a contract that's written that way, start
&gt;&gt; your own wireless carrier and offer it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Unilateral contracts are a nice concept for the corporation, but if
&gt;&gt;&gt; they push on that they'll get pushed back on.  &quot;We can do anything
&gt;&gt;&gt; we want, you just have to pay us money until we tell you you don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to&quot;--that's not a contract, that's crazy.

&gt;&gt; Agreed, but no one was forced to agree to it, were they? That goes
&gt;&gt; for any of the wireless companies.

&gt; I think that's why the NY Consumer Advocate is getting involved.  What
&gt; Sprint is doing is not in the contract and customers didn't agree to

We're talking about less than .002% of their total customer base here-
about 1 out of every 50,000 customers.  An average of around 20
customers for every state in the union. Everybody is jumping on this as
if millions of customers are effected and that the behavior of this
handful of customers has to be close to normal.  Some of them were
calling an average of 15-20 times a day for months on end.  Sprint was
obviously not able to meet their needs or expectations- what would
expect Sprint to do?

Wanna bet that Verizon unilaterally cancels more customers than that in
a month for data use violations? Or that AT&amp;T will unilaterally cancel
more service than that as they shut down the remaining TDMA towers on
the network?

I'm actually a little disappointed in some here (including you, Elmo)
that have focused on the call volume and perverted it into the sole
reason these customers were cancelled.  Much more information has been
reported than that, but it goes unmentioned.  I wonder how long some of
you would survive if put into the situation of having to listen to the
same bitch from the same person 10-15 times a day for a couple of months
and having to just allow it to continue.  You'll notice that I hav emade
no attempt to defend Sprint's care mechanism- that would be absurd.  But
jeez- you all act like this business decision is the most heinous crime
committed against the flock of sheep known as today's consumer.

No, but letting it be the _customer's_ choice to leave, rather than being
forced by Sprint, would be a bettr outcome politically.  I suspect the
vast majority would've opted to leave voluntarily, and Sprint would have
the desired result with no negative press (heck, it would've been easy to
spin it positively- the story would be &quot;Sprint releases 2000 unsatisfied
customers without penalty&quot; instead of &quot;Sprint terminates 2000 customers

Again, like you, I agree that Sprint is making the right move.  I just
think they could've handled it better.

They're a &quot;bad&quot; customer because at that level they are obviously trying to
game the system. Let's be real. There's dozens of web sites out there
sharing techniques:

- how to get the &quot;employee referral&quot; pricing when the only employee you know
is the guy at the Sprint store who is trying to sell you a phone
- how to get the &quot;loyalty discount&quot; when you are a brand-new customer
- direct telephone extensions for the retention department and other
internal groups
- actual discount codes CSR reps can put into their system
- scripts to use to get reps to cave in
- ways to cause problems in order to have something to complain about
- how to get &quot;dropped call&quot; credits by the bushel

and so on and so forth. Every one of them tells you, &quot;Don't give up. Keep
calling until you find the one rep who will give you the credit.&quot;

It's not about customers trying to resolve legitimate problems. It's about
scam artists and the sport they have with each other to get the best
pricing. By all accounts, Sprint has mailed 1,000 of these letters. Let's
see, they have 20 million subscribers? That's firing the worst 0.005% of
customers. I have *no* trouble believing they deserved it.

And, on the off chance someone did have a legitimate reason to be calling so
much, they provided a telephone number where you could talk to a real human
being about it. Apparently -- read consumerist.com -- one guy did call in.
They didn't stonewall him; they looked up his record and reversed their
decision.

Mindy Bockstein, the NY agency director, is simply practicing demagoguery
here for her own selfish ends, not too different from that prosecutor in the

&gt; - how to get &quot;dropped call&quot; credits by the bushel

&gt; and so on and so forth. Every one of them tells you, &quot;Don't give up.
&gt; Keep calling until you find the one rep who will give you the credit.&quot;

&gt; It's not about customers trying to resolve legitimate problems. It's
&gt; about scam artists and the sport they have with each other to get the
&gt; best pricing. By all accounts, Sprint has mailed 1,000 of these
&gt; letters. Let's see, they have 20 million subscribers? That's firing
&gt; the worst 0.005% of customers. I have *no* trouble believing they
&gt; deserved it.
&gt; And, on the off chance someone did have a legitimate reason to be
&gt; calling so much, they provided a telephone number where you could
&gt; talk to a real human being about it. Apparently -- read
&gt; consumerist.com -- one guy did call in. They didn't stonewall him;
&gt; they looked up his record and reversed their decision.

&gt; Mindy Bockstein, the NY agency director, is simply practicing
&gt; demagoguery here for her own selfish ends, not too different from
&gt; that prosecutor in the unfortunate Duke incident.

All well and good but they could just drop them at the expiration of the
contract. A contract for 2 years is binding on both parties. Why should
only one party be laible for a penalty for early termination?
Regardless of the benefits to her carreer in this matter, there is an
unbalance in the contract that should be rectified.

If your point is that cell phone contracts in general should be abolished,
I'm all for that. But we have contracts. And people have plenty of options
for pay-as-you-go or prepaid. The contracts exist because the outlay is on
the carrier's side, subsidizing free RAZRs and (in my personal case) $600
Treos for an end-user cost of $75.

Contracts certainly can be voided in the case of fraud, which is what is
happening in this situation. People badgering the customer service center,
making up sob stories, manufacturing problems until they get every service
credit and discount available.

The relevant section of Sprint's Contract:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Our Right To Suspend Or Terminate Services

We can, without notice, suspend or terminate any Service at any time for any
reason, including, but not limited to: (a) late payment; (b) exceeding an
Account Spending Limit (“ASL”); (c) harassing/threatening our employees or
agents; (d) providing false information; (e) interfering with our
operations; (f) using/suspicion of using Services in any manner restricted
by or inconsistent with the Agreement; (g) breaching the Agreement,
including our Policies; (h) providing false, inaccurate, dated or
unverifiable identification or credit information, or becoming insolvent or
bankrupt; (i) modifying a Device from its manufacturer specifications; or
(j) if we believe the action protects our interests, any customer's
interests or our network.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

If New York's Ms. Bockstein wants to make a stand for the downtrodden
consumer, where is she when Verizon is disconnecting people (and charging
them ETF!) for using their so-called &quot;unlimited&quot; data plan to stream YouTube
videos? Gosh, could it be that Verizon's corporate headquarters is at 140
West St. in Manhatten? Nah. That would just be too transparent, wouldn't it?

Sprint is terminating the contracts of scam artists who are trying to
defraud them by gaming the system. These are the bottom 0.005% of
customers.... abusers who apparently think it's fun to compete with each
other for the most discounts. Fraud is a basis for cancelling a contract
(and worse) whether it's unilateral or not. I'm glad to see them go, as
they're the ones who are making it harder for honest customers with
legitimate gripes.

Just look at the guy in this newsgroup a couple months back whose daughter
clearly dropped her phone in the toilet and was trying to jerk them around
with not paying his bill EVEN WHEN THEY SENT HIM A FREE REPLACEMENT PHONE
and he did NOT have insurance! Some of the people are so pathetic they don't
even realize what they're doing is wrong. Not even when not a single person
in the newsgroup came to his defense. But you know what, I bet not even that
guy got a letter, because you had to call more than 90 TIMES in a six-month
period to get one. That's calling to complain EVERY OTHER DAY.

If your girlfriend was that high-maintenance, you'd dump her in a heartbeat,
engagement ring or not!

As for unilateral, I hope you're not suggesting that you should sit down and
negotiate each contract case-by-case with the teenager at your local Sprint
shop. You agree to &quot;unilateral&quot; contracts every time you use a computer,
install software, buy a video game, register for a web site, watch a DVD or
even visit Disneyland. Unless you're at an higher management level, you
really don't even have the ability to negotiate an employment contract. Sign
what they give you, take it or leave it.

As for Sprint's cell service, it's a standard agreement and you're free to
pick a company that doesn't require a contract or go with someone that
offers the terms you want. For example, Verizon with its $45 &quot;unlimited&quot;
data plan (as long is it's only email and web browsing with no MP3s or
streaming media and under 100MB any given day).

When I got my phone, the Sprint rep took me through the contract and I
clearly understood what I was getting into. Bottom line: I was getting a
$600 smartphone for just $75 in exchange for me promising to pay my bills
and stay with Sprint for 24 months. If you think about it, that's more than
$20/month &quot;invisible&quot; credit on my bill. If I didn't like that I could have
gone with an AT&amp;T GoPhone or any one of a number of other no-contract
alternatives. And look at it this way... if I DID cancel my service before
the time was up, and paid $150, Sprint would still be screwed out of $375
for the phone. That's not even accounting for the cost of acquiring me and
paying for people to answer all the calls I made to customer service trying
to scam discounts.

Sprint zero'd out their balance, gave them 30 days notice, didn't charge an
ETF, and didn't take their thieving butts to court for fraud. All consistent
with a terms of service contract that I think is the fairest of all the
cellular carriers. [Show me a TOS that is better] And if you called in and
had a legitimate reason for the calls you made, they reversed the decision.
I don't see what the fuss is about.

The only hogs here are the greedy crooks who weren't happy with the perks
they already scammed for their plans and had to call &quot;one more time&quot; for the
free ringtones. This will turn out like the woman who &quot;found&quot; the thumb in
her Wendy's chili. Dishonest people who are taking advantage of our innate
distrust of large companies for their personal financial gain.

&gt;&gt; Because that's what the customer agreed to.

&gt; Not every contract is legal.

&gt; Do the cell phone companies REALLY want their unilateral terms
&gt; scrutinized so carefully?

&gt; Especially when powerful politicians want to buy votes?

&gt; Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.  When you get outright hoggy with
&gt; your contract, you're inviting something--anything--to happen.
