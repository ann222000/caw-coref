I just got my running shoes, and I'm sure glad I went to  true running
store.  The shoes I ended up with are definitely not what I would have
chosen on my own.  They are Nike Bowerman series runners, and while I
normally wear a 7 1/2, he had me get size 9's, because of the swelling and
lengthening that occurs during running.  Plus, he had me try on 5 different
pairs, and while watching me jog the sidewalk, immediately recognized that
my right foot angles outward and has a pronation issue.  I always knew that
something was weird with my gait, but never knew quite what it was.  The man
told me that I may have one leg slightly shorter, and it can cause that.
But with the right pair of shoes, it now is not nearly as pronounced and I
can tell that it will feel much more natural.  Also, one of my feet is a 1/2
size bigger than the other, and he sized my shoes for the larger foot, which
I had not really ever noticed.

Anyways, it's time to go break them in, so I'm heading out for my run today!

Hey, congratulations! It's so important to have proper shoes for
exercising. I was at the Toronto Marathon a few months and did the 5km
run. There was a kiosk where they had a computer that would help those
experts to find the perfect shoe for me. I ran on a carpet with
electronic devices underneath. They gave me the results of the test and
sent me to another kiosk with the results. I stood in front of the guy,
and saw me leaning forward -I lost my balance for a second just! He saw
that I needed a shoe that gives me stability. I'm so glad I went there.
Now I feel more balanced on my feet. No more leaning forward.

Excellent!  Well done!  You'll be coming on in literal leaps and bounds now!
I'm a Nike girl too but I'm a neutral runner so boring old Air Pegasus for
me!  At the risk of obsessing, could I suggest you now keep a log of the
distance you do in them so you know when they need replacing?  Around the
350 mile mark is usual.

Well done! Next time you are in the market for running shoes take a
good look at Asics though. I believe that Asics Nimbus (neutral foot)
or Asics Kayano (for pronators) are quite simply as good as you can
get. I wear the Nimbus and swear by them. Having said that they do wear
extremely quickly and are very expensive so I also use a pair of Nike
Air Pegasus for more of the cross training and general wear sort of
stuff. Its all a matter of personal preferance really, once you've been
through a few pairs you'll pick a favourite.

Running shoes are such a personal thing, what works for me may not work
for others. I LOVE Asics!!! They fit my very narrow feet so well, I
bought two pairs of them. :)

I had a pair of Asics Cumulus.  Hated them and threw them out.  Don't get on
with New Balance either but my second pair are Saucony Trignon Neutral Ride.
Feet are strange things!

I like to obsess...I'm good at it ;-)

I have an excel spreadsheet where I track date, distance, location of run,
time, average heart rate and maximum heart rate.  I'm very anal...

OH, see, now I have narrow feet.  Of course, I figure I'll start out pretty
ignorant, but will learn my way around all this stuff over time.  After I
wear these out, I'll take a look at asics.  Thanks!

Ain't that the truth!   My husband and I both used to be total Nike fans,
but were frustrated about how quickly their support ran out.   We'd be
throwing out perfectly fine looking shoes that just were worn out and hurt
the feet to wear (or we'd be putting insoles in to make them last longer).

Then we found New Balance and their support lasts so much longer, we both
like them.   When I was running a few years ago I contemplated trying Asics,
but never did.  But just for my every day sneakers, workout shoes, etc I buy
new balance and avoid nike now.
