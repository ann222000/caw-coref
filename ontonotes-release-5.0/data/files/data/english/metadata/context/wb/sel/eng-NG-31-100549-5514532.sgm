Wing Mirror Glass Fitting Question
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

OK - my 9000 was attacked by vandals sometime in the night
So far i have managed to repair/replace all the damaged
parts except the drivers door wing mirror glass.
The outer housing is untouched, and all i see is the mechanism
etc. I have a "spare" glass, but have NO idea on fitting it.
Anyone here had experience of fitting one?
It seems to me to be a "fiddley" job, and could need a special
tool perhaps

Any help appreciated

Teleman

It's easy.

Stick a flat bladed screwdriver through the hole at the bottom of the
housing and you'll engage with a piece of plastic inside the housing.
Flick the screwdriver one way (sorry can't remember which way! and
you'll disengage the mirror and it will fall into your hand.

From that point onwards it's pretty obvious.  Just disconnect the heater
wires and replacement is a reversal.

Thanks for that, David - Pretty straightforward when you see the hole for screwdriver
(which i didnt, and "teased" it out of the holder)
What was concerning me was there are 2 "pegs" in the mirror housing that correspond
to 2 indents on the back of the glass bezel.
I had a HORRIBLE feeling that these needed to be lined up to engage

Again, thanks

Teleman

Can't remember now but as you've probably seen by now, it's easy once
you know how.  Replacement is a simple case of putting the mirror into
position and then flipping the catch with the screwdriver.

I can show you how this looks with the mirror and back removed -- thanks to a
flaming idiot who tried to run me over on the interstate today. Changed lanes
without looking to see if there was anyone else there. The only way I could
get away was to try swerve to the left, into the path of a semi. Thankfully,
the only damage was that the driver's side mirror, front and back, got ripped
off and I got some tire rub. Thank God I was driving a Saab.
I've ordered a replacement mirror but they only have black so I'll have to
have it repainted.
A year -- almost to the day -- from when my 9000 got hit. I'm no longer
leaving the house during the Ides of August!
What really burned me up about the accident was that the mini-van that tried
to run over me -- and didn't even stop or notice that he/she almost killed me
-- had FOP (Fraternal Order of Police) license plates. Means driver is a cop
or related to one.
A very nasty letter to the local police/sheriffs offices will be whipped of
tonight.

Glad you're ok. Of course if you're a fatalist you'll realise that staying
inside probably won't help, because some time next August a white van or a
Volvo will fall through the roof .... Cheers
