Circle jerking, gentlemen?

Perhaps KenK writes of his 'credentials' since this is preferable to
inventing names on newsgroups to support one's own point of view, or to
defame those of others - not once, but hundreds and hundreds of times.

But it is a natural thing to resent other people with whom we are unable to
discourse, isn't it? By the evidence of people's behavior here, this would
seem to be the standard offered by the Strat-club.

Ken Kaplan's views are indeed 'eccentric' in that they are not centered on
received opinion of a Stratford origin for the Author, but are of 'other
means.' If Bob Grumman's intent is to mock a standard of approach when he
wrote &quot;throwing his vast credentials&quot;, instead of admitting that the display
of a standard of approach is essential to investigators, this merely
explains why Bob Grumman is a typical club-Strat member.

[Incidentally: 'credentials' stem from 'credo' which means 'belief', which
is the On Topic subject under investigation. Or rather, alternatives to
'belief' are the subject.]

If Mr. Grumman would prefer some inverse corollary to this methodological
approach, as typified in the writings of attack-Strats such as Brennen and
Webb, then he might make a plain statement of his desire for such limits,
otherwise disabuse himself that that constitutes any standard of
investigation at all.

It indicates that people have invested their belief in an individual's
knowledge of a particular subject.

I resist the cant use of the word since it does not admit this relationship
of believing, and substitutes belief for a kind of meritocracy not
necessarily warranted.

Here is the distinction: Galileo had the merit of conducting individual
research and proposing his discovers to a public; whereas the Pope had the
credence of the people to authoritively suppress him.

When 95%+ of people's posts are ad hominem does this constitute fairness?
Well, let's say that it does for you, but that is does not define everyone's
standard of what constitutes fair discussion or investigation. Neither
should it go unmentioned as if it were an anomalous factor, randomly
associating with the topic.

What Ken's 'credentials' are really, has to do with abilities to do
something other than behave like a reactionary when confronted by barbarian
heretics. I don't know him at all, I am only commenting on his /behavior/
here in the group. I doubt I am the only reader to have read Rbt. Hughes'
/Shock of the New/.

Ken seems to be interested in the way we know things, rather than 'the
result' as we propose it. &quot;How we know what we know&quot;. This is a little
unusual, yet real methodology.

Thanks Bob for writing a calm response. I am writing this only in order that
you understand that to engage &quot;95%&quot; noise is not an attractive proposition,
and unless you are entirely content only hearing your confrere's Strat
persuasions, then, you might let a heretic into the pulpit now and again
without the raspberries.

Otherwise your club is, returning to the subject of belief, a fundamentalist
one, and rather tending to a little behavioral sado-facisme, no?

There are some who claim these collective behaviors are 'without meaning',
yet the typical way we have been introduced to our subject has been based on
the phenomena.

Hey Bob, careful!

Nil is so afraid you will abandom club mores and stray beyond the known
limits of the herd's communal dungpile, and react to what people write on
whatever merit it has.

His little note to you is really rather fearful isn't it, as if he can
intercede between two other peoples conversation with his usual shit,
implicitly not wishing you to think and respond for yourself.

Webb and a few others are merely better at disguising this sort of
sophistry, and can also make 99 consecutive posts without content, meanwhile
regreting the expressions of all who attempt it. Fascisme Club Alert! - Pass
the armbands! Repel Boarders!

Nil is an exact example of what I wrote in the previous post (which of
course he has snipped) - see, here it is:-

'Thanks Bob for writing a calm response. I am writing this only in

It is a word used by many people for public, social (and also legal)
purposes. You cannot choose whether or not to admit it into the
English vocabulary. You cannot arbitrarily replace a word by its
definition and expect to be understood -- even if you have the
definition correctly, as here you do not. If you do this once or
twice, or if you provide enough structure for an audience to be able
to see what you're talking about, perhaps you can get away with it.

Non sequitur. The proper contrast to Galileo is not the Pope but the
clerics (whose names I forget). They had &quot;credentials&quot; -- degrees and
positions given to them because they were seen to deserve those
positions for some reason; Galileo did not, he only had his
manuscripts, tools, and experiments. The clerics were able to say
that Galileo's argument did not convince them, according to the rules
they thought had to be followed, and they were also able, then, to say
that nobody else could say what Galileo had. I don't know whether
they said it was because of the Pope that they were right and that
Galileo was wrong. They were wrong, in any event, because the church
should not have been making itself the arbiter of all truth in all

I don't know what you think gives you the right to comment on people's
behavior. Even if you were qualified to analyze the behavior of
others, in all situations, you would need, in addition, either the
permission of the other participants or some kind of commission from
the government or the owner of the site, in order to have a &quot;right&quot; to
do this. And from what I've myself observed of your own behavior
here, you don't believe you have this kind of right, but are acting as
a participant, like any other, commenting on what you do and don't
like.

I've been beginning to find it easier, in some situations, to deal
with people who occasionally react badly when faced with something
that pushes their buttons, than to deal with people who feel they can
pass judgment on others whenever they feel like it. When the posts on
posting etiquette threaten to outnumber the posts with real content,
that's a danger sign.

My memory of what happened is that Ken Kaplan was challenged directly
to produce his credentials, and that when he complied, he was teased
for it.

It's not unusual in my own experience. What is unusual, is
&quot;methodology.&quot; I don't know how you think you can know whether Ken

easily back and forth between talking about &quot;collective behaviors&quot; and
talking about individual psychological dysfunction. Given that you
know that your own background and education differs from that of other

personal experience as normative for everyone, everywhere, at every

Any discussion must rest on what its words/signposts indicate. That is,
where they point, not the words/signposts themselves, which are in fact

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No no. They were appointees, party men. And should they have clerical
credentials it was not in Galileo's subject which was astronomy or 'physics'
or 'natural philosophy' ~ and even if they had, they did not act to rebuke
Galileo on astronomical credentials, but on religious/political credentials.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Galileo did not, he only had his

"/>

Yes, he had no credentials extended to him by popish authority.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Laugh. Why should clerics who never studied astronomy verify papers on that
subject ~ Why does it have to do with them? Galileo provided both his
empirical method and the results of his experiments.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't know whether
&gt; they said it was because of the Pope that they were right and that

"/>

You make my point for me. Whether a bunch of credentialed appointees say
that Galileo is right or wrong has nothing whatever to do with any actual
veracity in his experiments.

They are making political decisions, not scientific ones. Real veracity of
Galileo can only be achieved by a methodological approach, one entirely
indifferent to the resultant ease of the Pope, his representatives, the
church and the general public.

THEREFORE: when people speak of credentials, their is no implication that
they have more than an executive power, unless something else is also said.
In our expert-ridden times we wheel on our credentialed experts for almost
any subject. Whether that is in a court of law, or in government, or in
discussing the Authorship of the Works.

WITHOUT also saying something else, and that something being a displayed
method, such expertise is of little value to actually verify anything.

&gt;&gt; The clerics were able to say
&gt;&gt; that Galileo's argument did not convince them, according to the
rules
&gt;&gt; they thought had to be followed, and they were also able, then, to
say
&gt;&gt; that nobody else could say what Galileo had.

&gt; Laugh. Why should clerics who never studied astronomy verify papers on that
&gt; subject ~ Why does it have to do with them? Galileo provided both his
&gt; empirical method and the results of his experiments.

It was the empirical method that they rejected.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I don't know whether
&gt;&gt; they said it was because of the Pope that they were right and that
&gt;&gt; Galileo was wrong. They were wrong, in any event, because the
church
&gt;&gt; should not have been making itself the arbiter of all truth in all
&gt;&gt; fields (while at the same time excluding certain areas from any and
&gt;&gt; all consideration).

&gt; You make my point for me. Whether a bunch of credentialed appointees say
&gt; that Galileo is right or wrong has nothing whatever to do with any actual
&gt; veracity in his experiments.

&gt; They are making political decisions, not scientific ones. Real veracity of
&gt; Galileo can only be achieved by a methodological approach, one entirely
&gt; indifferent to the resultant ease of the Pope, his representatives, the
&gt; church and the general public.

&gt; THEREFORE: when people speak of credentials, their is no implication that
&gt; they have more than an executive power, unless something else is also said.
&gt; In our expert-ridden times we wheel on our credentialed experts for almost
&gt; any subject. Whether that is in a court of law, or in government, or in
&gt; discussing the Authorship of the Works.

It was precisely the executive power that was at issue in the
condemnation of Galileo and of his opinions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It indicates that people have invested their belief in an individual's
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge of a particular subject.

&gt;&gt; It indicates a request for information on the part of those
&gt;&gt; controlling admission, and an acceptable reply to that request: We
&gt;&gt; require such-and-such to be the case in order for us to consider a
&gt;&gt; person qualified to enter here -- Somebody has certified that for me,
&gt;&gt; such-and-such is the case. It is a sign that the individual bearing
&gt;&gt; the credentials possesses certain other attributes. Bob Grumman is
&gt;&gt; right.

&gt; Hi Bianca. I am differentiating between belief and veracity. I am saying
&gt; that people invested other people with 'credentials' but that this does
not
&gt; make them right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I resist the cant use of the word since it does not admit this
&gt; relationship
&gt;&gt;&gt; of believing, and substitutes belief for a kind of meritocracy not
&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily warranted.

&gt;&gt; It is a word used by many people for public, social (and also legal)
&gt;&gt; purposes. You cannot choose whether or not to admit it into the
&gt;&gt; English vocabulary. You cannot arbitrarily replace a word by its
&gt;&gt; definition and expect to be understood -- even if you have the
&gt;&gt; definition correctly, as here you do not. If you do this once or
&gt;&gt; twice, or if you provide enough structure for an audience to be able
&gt;&gt; to see what you're talking about, perhaps you can get away with it.

&gt; Yes, I can't replace a cant usage already in public use, and am not
&gt; attempting to do so as you falsely suggest is my intent.

&gt; However, I can establish what that use is, and what it is not. Any word is
a
&gt; label, or a signpost, in place of something else &lt;right?&gt; This subject is
&gt; called semiotics.

&gt; Isn't common usage of credential euphemistic? Does it make the
&gt; differentiation between authority and veracity? I think it does not. Your
&gt; criticism would be okay if there was such a distinction made in normal
&gt; speech, but there is not. I am making such a distinction, rather than
argue
&gt; on what common labels [words, phrases, tropes] are or 'should be' in use.

&gt; When we think it is in ideas, no? Not in words. I am addressing the ideas.

&gt;&gt; Past a certain point, your meaning becomes impossible to retrieve. Of
&gt;&gt; course, one can wait a while and post your own message back to you,
&gt;&gt; and see what you say in response.

&gt; Any discussion must rest on what its words/signposts indicate. That is,
&gt; where they point, not the words/signposts themselves, which are in fact
&gt; substitutions.

&gt; Below you try to dismiss my distinction - which you obviously can
&gt; understand, but are simply unwilling to accept:-

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is the distinction: Galileo had the merit of conducting
individual
&gt;&gt;&gt; research and proposing his discovers to a public; whereas the Pope had
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; credence of the people to authoritively suppress him.

&gt;&gt; Non sequitur. The proper contrast to Galileo is not the Pope but the
&gt;&gt; clerics (whose names I forget).

&gt; The clerics directed by the Pope, in any case.

&gt;&gt; They had &quot;credentials&quot; -- degrees and
&gt;&gt; positions given to them because they were seen to deserve those
&gt;&gt; positions for some reason;

&gt; No no. They were appointees, party men. And should they have clerical
&gt; credentials it was not in Galileo's subject which was astronomy or
'physics'
&gt; or 'natural philosophy' ~ and even if they had, they did not act to rebuke
&gt; Galileo on astronomical credentials, but on religious/political

"/>

credentials.

Not so. They questioned him on grounds of astronomy, about which they (the
Jesuits) knew quite a bit more than he did. At the time of the clash Galileo
hadn't looked through a telescope for about twenty years. The work he'd been
doing was in mechanics. But the Jesuits had been tracking the motion of the
heavenly bodies for decades. Also, contrary to carefully- constructed
legend, they did not reject out of hand the idea that the earth moved around
the sun, since it was something that many of the Jesuit astronomers
themselves suspected. Indeed all the careful work they had been doing gave
them better grounds for believing it than Galileo had. But they did not
advocate the belief or try to promote it because they couldn't prove it. And
all they demanded from Galileo was the same as they demanded from
themselves - proof. Without the proof, he could go on believing it, if he
chose, but he couldn't *teach* it. By the standards of the time, that was an
eminently reasonable position.

In fact they threatened to keep the old man locked up for the rest of his
life unless he recanted and sought mercy. Hardly the Proceedings of Royal
Society!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Galileo did not, he only had his
&gt;&gt;&gt; manuscripts, tools, and experiments.

&gt;&gt; Yes, he had no credentials extended to him by popish authority.

&gt; Wrong. He had no credentials extended to him by any institution of
&gt; the society in which he lived.

Which is the same thing. What sort of science do you imagine was not
audited?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Laugh. Why should clerics who never studied astronomy verify papers on
that
&gt;&gt; subject ~ Why does it have to do with them? Galileo provided both his
&gt;&gt; empirical method and the results of his experiments.

&gt; It was the empirical method that they rejected.

"/>

Yes! They refused to act from empirical observations, preferring polemical
Catholisicm as a method of determination.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; THEREFORE: when people speak of credentials, their is no implication
that
&gt;&gt; they have more than an executive power, unless something else is also
said.
&gt;&gt; In our expert-ridden times we wheel on our credentialed experts for
almost
&gt;&gt; any subject. Whether that is in a court of law, or in government, or in
&gt;&gt; discussing the Authorship of the Works.

&gt; It was precisely the executive power that was at issue in the
&gt; condemnation of Galileo and of his opinions.

Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; WITHOUT also saying something else, and that something being a displayed

&gt;&gt; Q.E.D.
&gt;&gt; And a second point is that I did NOT say that Bob was odd, as you write
&gt;&gt; above, I said that his assumption was odd. Remember, its behavior that I
am
&gt;&gt; addressing, not personalities, and certainly not making a-personal
jibes.

&gt; You cannot address &quot;behavior&quot; without presuming a &quot;personality,&quot; of
&gt; some type or other, behind it. Otherwise you are only addressing
&gt; words or texts, which is different.

Your definition is weaker than the thing you criticise.

It does not lower my respect for Bob the person of this example, if I
question an aspect of his behavior. You are making this into a criticism of
Bob the person, not me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I am unsure of what you intend by 'right', but certainly am a
participant
&gt;&gt; here.

&gt; I am merely confirming that you do not believe yourself specially
&gt; commissioned to make statements concerning the behavior of other
&gt; participants in this newsgroup.

"/>

???
You have made some dozen suppositions on what I must think or do/not
believe. What on earth can 'specially commissioned' mean?

Do you think there is a even such a thing as group process? That people play
roles in groups? Is this a new subject for you, or do you not think this
subject is relevant? In short, why are you writing?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; His method is what is demonstrated in his writing. It is not some
abstruse &amp;
&gt;&gt; metaphysical aspect of his mind and I am not acting as a seer to singly
&gt;&gt; determine that.

&gt; Then your definition of &quot;methodology&quot; is so loose as to be
&gt; meaningless.

"/>

I have never offered to 'define' methodology - once more you invent on what
I write as if I ever said, &quot;here is my definition of ...&quot;. All your
responses are heavy with these inventions. Why?

I did however use the word methodology in a context. That is not
'meaningless' and is in fact a specific case.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I mean that in a very brief interchange he addressed both the frame and
the
&gt;&gt; content together, pausing before proceeding to whatever results or
&gt;&gt; conclusions there might be in any case. This is a savvy approach by
someone
&gt;&gt; who values its necessity.

&gt; Perhaps you do know Ken Kaplan well enough to be certain that this is
&gt; the correct description of how he composes his posts to this
&gt; newsgroup. My observation suggests to me that he would be very
&gt; unusual if he could understand your &quot;meaning&quot; well enough to be able
&gt; to make objections to your evaluation of his behavior, if he wanted
&gt; to.

"/>

That has nothing to do with what I wrote. It is simply another bag full of
suppositions that YOU have inserted. But I am getting bored. Tell me: Are
you not familiar with 'frame and content' as key elements when talking of
method?

That's the subject addressed in that paragraph.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And you are the only one who has demonstrated any interested in &quot;how
&gt; people approach the topic under discussion,&quot; nor has anyone
&gt; reciprocated your interest, that has been visible to me.

"/>

Actually, this is the subject of a brief exchange with Ken Kaplan. The very
point at issue! The question is whether the method of people's approach has
an effect on people's determination of the authorship issue, and an
implication of that is if resolving authorship casts any light onto the text
itself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Is this a question or a form of rebuke for mentioning the subject? You
have
&gt;&gt; criticised my posts for asking 'how we know what we know' by writing in
a
&gt;&gt; censorious way about raising these issues.

&gt; It is a statement of two examples of the way in which your statement
&gt; is vague.

"/>

Why be so vague yourself? Are you interested in 'how we know what we know'
or not? You can answer that yes or no.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I am actually interested in the inverse, and in obtaining many points of

on
&gt;&gt; what you suppose are my ideas, but on what is actually written.

&gt; It is not my impression that &quot;club Strat&quot; has any meaning. Are you
&gt; talking about Bob Grumman's individual preferences? Are you talking
&gt; about some phantom that some &quot;Oxfordians&quot; (as some of them call

Trollery. Will you look at what I write, or continue to speculate if such

&gt; At the time of the clash Galileo
&gt; hadn't looked through a telescope for about twenty years. The work he'd
been
&gt; doing was in mechanics. But the Jesuits had been tracking the motion of
the

&gt; legend, they did not reject out of hand the idea that the earth moved
around
&gt; the sun, since it was something that many of the Jesuit astronomers
&gt; themselves suspected. Indeed all the careful work they had been doing gave
&gt; them better grounds for believing it than Galileo had. But they did not
&gt; advocate the belief or try to promote it because they couldn't prove it.
And
&gt; all they demanded from Galileo was the same as they demanded from
&gt; themselves - proof. Without the proof, he could go on believing it, if he

an

&gt;&gt; No, you cannot. &quot;Establishing&quot; and &quot;choosing&quot; are the same, in
this

&gt;&quot;Bianca&quot;, your responses do not address what I wrote.

My remarks do indeed address what you wrote. You have not shown that
my remarks do not address what you wrote. Your example, below, is
insufficient to demonstrate that my remarks, as you say, do not
address what you wrote. The insufficiency of your supposed
demonstration tells me that what you wrote is barely worth replying
to. I am trying to find a level low enough for you to comprehend; it
seems we have not yet reached that level.

Example: I added a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; question mark to the above sentence with an emphasis &quot;&lt;right?&gt;&quot; but you
&gt; reply with quotations marks around words I didn't use.

"/>

Here, you reply by making an evidently irrelevant observation
concerning the sentence after the one to which I responded. I had
stopped at the first sentence because it was so bad that there was not
any point in continuing to the second.

You then complain, incomprehensibly linking this thought to the
previous one, that I put &quot;quotation marks around words [you] didn't
use.&quot; Presumably you are complaining that I am quoting you as saying
something you did not in fact say. One of these words with quotation
marks around it is &quot;establishing.&quot; The other is &quot;choosing.&quot; It is
true that you did not use the word &quot;establishing.&quot; However, you did
indeed use the word &quot;establish,&quot; as can be easily seen from what you
left in the quoted post from yourself (&quot;However, I can establish what
that use is, and what it is not.&quot;) Similarly, in the previous
paragraph, the word &quot;choose&quot; had been used. You yourself linked these
two paragraphs (I had said that you cannot choose how a word may be
used in standard English, and you agreed, but countered that you can
establish how a word is used). Putting quotation marks around a word
is standard English usage to indicate that the word itself, rather
than the idea behind the word, is being discussed. (For example,
&quot;'Word' is a three-letter word,&quot; is a grammatical English sentence,
though not a true English sentence; whereas, &quot;Word is a four-letter
word,&quot; is not a strictly grammatical English sentence.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; You continue in the same vein throughout.

"/>

Given your evident problems with English usage, I do not think you can
be competent to evaluate the &quot;vein&quot; in which I am writing, much less
to evaluate my writing either positively or negatively (that is, to
say whether my writing is good or bad).

You see, here I provided you with an example of what, in your own
writing, I object to. I also provide, in the same post, and indeed in
the same place in the post, an explanation of how the example I
provide relates to what I think of your post. You have not done this.
You have apparently named this activity, but not in fact carried it
out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't common usage of credential euphemistic? Does it make the
&gt;&gt;&gt; differentiation between authority and veracity? I think it does
not.
&gt; Your
&gt;&gt;&gt; criticism would be okay if there was such a distinction made in
normal
&gt;&gt;&gt; speech, but there is not. I am making such a distinction, rather
than
&gt; argue
&gt;&gt;&gt; on what common labels [words, phrases, tropes] are or 'should be'
in
&gt; use.

&gt;&gt; No, the correct usage of the word &quot;credential&quot; or &quot;credentials&quot;
(which
&gt;&gt; is the same as the &quot;common&quot; usage) is not euphemistic.

&gt; This is a pale response. having raised the issue - your issue - and after I
&gt; write you an additional paragraph, you just say 'no' ;))

"/>

You were the one who raised the issue of &quot;credentials&quot; being normally
used &quot;euphemistically.&quot; Perhaps you really believe this. It is
evident that you are not competent to determine, for yourself or for
anyone else, what is and is not normal English usage. Thus I thought
it might be helpful to point out that you have the facts wrong in this
instance.

You evidently think that pointing out that an individual has his facts
wrong is a &quot;pale&quot; response. If it was some other fact concerning what
I wrote that caused you to say this, I don't think anybody other than
you is aware of what that fact might be.

You go on to say that the meaning of your first sentence is modified
by the &quot;additional paragraph&quot; that &quot;[you] wrote [me].&quot; You are wrong.
The meaning of the first sentence in a paragraph is not modified by
the second sentence of the paragraph in the way that you evidently
believe, when the grammar of those sentences is such as the grammar of
your sentences is.

If you believe that you have read something that states, explicitly,
that I am wrong on this point, I suspect that you have misread badly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; When we think it is in ideas, no? Not in words. I am addressing
the
&gt; ideas.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Past a certain point, your meaning becomes impossible to
retrieve.
&gt;&gt; Of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course, one can wait a while and post your own message back to
you,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and see what you say in response.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any discussion must rest on what its words/signposts indicate.
That is,
&gt;&gt;&gt; where they point, not the words/signposts themselves, which are in
fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; substitutions.

&gt;&gt; I don't think you understand what you are saying. Did you notice
that
&gt;&gt; you are contradicting yourself by saying that you are addressing
the
&gt;&gt; ideas and also that what we address in discussion must be the signs
&gt;&gt; and not the ideas? I think you didn't even notice that.

&gt; I did not say what you 'think' I said.

"/>

&quot;[W]hat [I] 'think' [you] said,&quot; as you describe it, is in my opinion
what any normal American, college-educated reader would construe out
of your post. It is certainly possible, given your evident problems
with English usage, that you did not intend to say what most people
would read you as having said.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I said specifically; what the sign/words INDICATE... not the words
&gt; themselves.

"/>

It is possible that I misunderstood. I thought you were speaking,
when you referred to &quot;ideas,&quot; about what a writer or reader is
_thinking of_; and then when you spoke of &quot;words/signposts,&quot; of what
the words signify regardless of what is &quot;in the mind of&quot; (as the
saying goes) any reader or writer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; The clerics directed by the Pope, in any case.

&gt;&gt; Wrong. They were the equivalent of university professors or
members
&gt;&gt; of the Royal Society.

&gt; ROFL! And are these offices at all seperate? And I think they can't be quite
&gt; equivalent to the RS :)

"/>

You are correct that they are not entirely equivalent to the Royal
Society. In fact, the Royal Society played a large role in the
ability of amateurs -- persons outside Oxford and Cambridge and the
government bureaucracies -- to engage successfully in scientific
activity. In other words, had there been something like a Royal
Society in Galileo's time and in his nation, he probably would have
belonged to it, and it would have provided a social backing and a
credibility that living where and when he did, he had lacked. (I am
not certain whether the Royal Society is still able to play that role,
and if not, it may well now play a role more similar to that of the
societies and bureaucracies that it had once counteracted.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But the point is that they were not suppressed for being incorrect
&gt; factually, or for poor methodology, or any number of academic reasons. they
&gt; were suppressed because they were inconvenient to the establishment whose
&gt; world view was that the Sun went around the earth; and they were suppressed
&gt; by direct actions instigated by a Pope [who incidentally, Galileo thought
&gt; would support him].

&gt; Do you in fact understand some different history than this? Maybe you don't
&gt; like this report because you are a Catholic. I don't know.

"/>

I am not Catholic. Nor do I appreciate being told by non-Jews that
probably I only believe some fact, which they believe to be a
falsehood, because I'm Jewish, whether or not they are correct in
their surmise that I do believe that fact. I would not like this any
more if the adjective used were &quot;Catholic&quot; or &quot;American&quot; or &quot;female&quot;
or &quot;a saxophone player.&quot; There are certainly so many cultural
differences separating you and me, not to mention more trivial
differences of cultural history, that there would seem to be little
justification for your having assumed that the reason we differ on
this point must be because I'm Catholic. I could list the various
sources from which my knowledge of Galileo and his case were drawn;
only some of them could be justly described as &quot;Catholic,&quot; and as a
whole (and they do form a coherent whole) they most certainly could
not be so described.

I don't know whether or not Buffalo is Catholic, but he is more
correct than you are. He seems to be able to describe the Jesuit side
of the dispute. You, on the other hand, seem to possess an
exceedingly simplistic &quot;theory&quot; of how one should explain what had
happened, and no interest at all in connecting your theory to the
facts. You seem to have read a political tract concerning &quot;how
politicians control the sciences,&quot; and another concerning &quot;Popery,&quot;
and concluded that you could now discuss the details of the history.

With all due respect, I think you are imagining an insufficiently
numerous variety of possible meanings for the words typed out by your
interlocutor here. I think I appreciate the value of restricting the
imagination somewhat, but how have you chosen which meanings you're
going to limit yourself to? By being especially predictable -- more
predictable than one would ordinarily be -- you may be undermining
your own objectives.

For example, what makes you think Phil Innes wishes not to pass false
coin, as you put it, or what you would believe to be such? What makes
you think he is more interested in what is true than in what you are
likely to say, or conversely, more interested in what you believe to
be true than in why you believe it true?

Another point you may want to consider: Most people learn a set of
&quot;phenomena,&quot; to choose a word that will inevitably confuse anyway, and
a set of vocabulary terms with which to address those phenomena, not
necessarily together; and then later are required to come to terms
with new phenomena and new terminology, sometimes &quot;on the run&quot; and
sometimes in a language they do not know very well. People get
confused. I would like to try _not_ to confirm them in their
confusion.

&gt;&gt; Hi Bianca. I am differentiating between belief and veracity. I am
saying

does
&gt; not

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I resist the cant use of the word since it does not admit this

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of believing, and substitutes belief for a kind of meritocracy
not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily warranted.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a word used by many people for public, social (and also
legal)
&gt;&gt;&gt; purposes. You cannot choose whether or not to admit it into the
&gt;&gt;&gt; English vocabulary. You cannot arbitrarily replace a word by its
&gt;&gt;&gt; definition and expect to be understood -- even if you have the

&gt;&gt;&gt; twice, or if you provide enough structure for an audience to be
able
&gt;&gt;&gt; to see what you're talking about, perhaps you can get away with
it.

&gt;&gt; Yes, I can't replace a cant usage already in public use, and am not
&gt;&gt; attempting to do so as you falsely suggest is my intent.

&gt;&gt; However, I can establish what that use is, and what it is not. Any
word is
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; label, or a signpost, in place of something else &lt;right?&gt; This
subject is
&gt;&gt; called semiotics.

&gt;&gt; Isn't common usage of credential euphemistic? Does it make the
&gt;&gt; differentiation between authority and veracity? I think it does
not. Your
&gt;&gt; criticism would be okay if there was such a distinction made in
normal
&gt;&gt; speech, but there is not. I am making such a distinction, rather
than
&gt; argue
&gt;&gt; on what common labels [words, phrases, tropes] are or 'should be'
in use.

&gt;&gt; When we think it is in ideas, no? Not in words. I am addressing the
ideas.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Past a certain point, your meaning becomes impossible to retrieve.
Of
&gt;&gt;&gt; course, one can wait a while and post your own message back to
you,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and see what you say in response.

&gt;&gt; Any discussion must rest on what its words/signposts indicate. That
is,
&gt;&gt; where they point, not the words/signposts themselves, which are in
fact
&gt;&gt; substitutions.

&gt;&gt; Below you try to dismiss my distinction - which you obviously can
&gt;&gt; understand, but are simply unwilling to accept:-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is the distinction: Galileo had the merit of conducting
&gt; individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; research and proposing his discovers to a public; whereas the
Pope had
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credence of the people to authoritively suppress him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Non sequitur. The proper contrast to Galileo is not the Pope but
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; clerics (whose names I forget).

&gt;&gt; The clerics directed by the Pope, in any case.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They had &quot;credentials&quot; -- degrees and
&gt;&gt;&gt; positions given to them because they were seen to deserve those
&gt;&gt;&gt; positions for some reason;

&gt;&gt; No no. They were appointees, party men. And should they have
clerical
&gt;&gt; credentials it was not in Galileo's subject which was astronomy or
&gt; 'physics'
&gt;&gt; or 'natural philosophy' ~ and even if they had, they did not act to
rebuke
&gt;&gt; Galileo on astronomical credentials, but on religious/political
&gt; credentials.

&gt; Not so. They questioned him on grounds of astronomy, about which they (the
&gt; Jesuits) knew quite a bit more than he did.

"/>

I'm sure they _were_ better able to defend the accepted view than
Galileo was able to argue against it.

At the time of the clash Galileo

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; hadn't looked through a telescope for about twenty years. The work he'd been
&gt; doing was in mechanics. But the Jesuits had been tracking the motion of the
&gt; heavenly bodies for decades. Also, contrary to carefully- constructed
&gt; legend, they did not reject out of hand the idea that the earth moved around
&gt; the sun, since it was something that many of the Jesuit astronomers
&gt; themselves suspected.

"/>

Is it also only legend that they refused even to look through the
telescope? Or is the actual historical fact &quot;only&quot; that they refused
to consider the evidence of the telescope, as they knew before looking
that it couldn't be correct unless it was in accordance with the
accepted view (and if it was, why bother looking?).

You leave out (carefully) that in fact Europeans had been tracking the
motions of the heavenly bodies, possibly without a break, for at least
1500 years, and that for some time prior to Galileo and this incident,
these observations had been getting more and more accurate; that the
accepted theories were failing to track these more accurate
observations more and more spectacularly; and that work on revamping
the theories had been going on, in a variety of quarters (this was
subsequent to Copernicus), for some time. The Jesuits, in other
words, were not, at this point, the only game in town, astronomy-wise.

You suggest that Galileo really didn't know what he was doing, and
that there were in fact no religious or theological questions at
issue, at all. In fact, the primary reason given (whether or not
accurately, in historical terms) for the accepted astronomical
theories, were that the accepted astronomical theories were (or could
be) derived from Scripture. Of course, real astronomers didn't really
do anything that most people would recognize as working from
Scripture, rather than doing astronomy. But that was the reason
given.

Indeed all the careful work they had been doing gave

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; them better grounds for believing it than Galileo had. But they did not
&gt; advocate the belief or try to promote it because they couldn't prove it. And
&gt; all they demanded from Galileo was the same as they demanded from
&gt; themselves - proof.

"/>

Are you saying that the Jesuits felt they had a method that (used in
conjunction with deductive reason) could given them the absolute
truth, all the time? That sounds a little like Gnosticism to me.
That is, presumably one would have to intuit one's first major
premise.

It sounds like you are saying that they would only accept Galileo's
theory as acceptable if he could convince them of it, or if he could
convince them that he was rationally convinced himself. Even though
they could not convince themselves, one way or the other, in other
words -- they forbade any theory they could not convince themselves
of.

Without the proof, he could go on believing it, if he

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; chose, but he couldn't *teach* it. By the standards of the time, that was an
&gt; eminently reasonable position.

"/>

I understand it to have been somewhat more than that. In fact, nobody
was permitted to teach it, is that right? And in fact, nobody was
permitted publicly to believe it at all, I thought, at least for some
time, as that would be equivalent to teaching it?

I don't think most American Catholics, at least, believe that the
church is authorized to decide which scientific theories are right and
which are wrong, but that _is_ the position of the church itself,
isn't it?

No, it isn't, except in cases where the so-called &quot;scientific theory&quot;
strays into theological territory, /e.g.,/ &quot;Evolution proves that there
is no such thing as a soul.&quot;

Cardinal Bellarmine, a contemporary of Galileo, wrote:

I say that if a real proof be found that the sun is fixed
and does not revolve round the earth, but the earth round
the sun, then it will be necessary, very carefully, to
proceed to the explanation of the passages of Scripture
which appear to be contrary, and we should rather say that
we have misunderstood these than pronounce that to be false
which is demonstrated.

A great deal of the popular &quot;knowledge&quot; concerning Galileo is urban
myth, just like the various urban myths about Columbus.

Ken, you listed &quot;Concert Promoter&quot; in answer to Tom Reedy, and 'given large

but it looks like more Oxfordian ego-padding, on the order of listing

Thank you Bianca. I now have a good sense of what your standard is and your
method of addressing a topic. No need to reply further on my acount.

Phil Innes

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Example: I added a
&gt;&gt; question mark to the above sentence with an emphasis &quot;&lt;right?&gt;&quot; but you
&gt;&gt; reply with quotations marks around words I didn't use.

&gt; Here, you reply by making an evidently irrelevant observation
&gt; concerning the sentence after the one to which I responded. I had
&gt; stopped at the first sentence because it was so bad that there was not
&gt; any point in continuing to the second.

&gt; You then complain, incomprehensibly linking this thought to the
&gt; previous one, that I put &quot;quotation marks around words [you] didn't
&gt; use.&quot; Presumably you are complaining that I am quoting you as saying
&gt; something you did not in fact say. One of these words with quotation
&gt; marks around it is &quot;establishing.&quot; The other is &quot;choosing.&quot; It is
&gt; true that you did not use the word &quot;establishing.&quot; However, you did
&gt; indeed use the word &quot;establish,&quot; as can be easily seen from what you
&gt; left in the quoted post from yourself (&quot;However, I can establish what
&gt; that use is, and what it is not.&quot;) Similarly, in the previous
&gt; paragraph, the word &quot;choose&quot; had been used. You yourself linked these
&gt; two paragraphs (I had said that you cannot choose how a word may be
&gt; used in standard English, and you agreed, but countered that you can
&gt; establish how a word is used). Putting quotation marks around a word
&gt; is standard English usage to indicate that the word itself, rather
&gt; than the idea behind the word, is being discussed. (For example,
&gt;&quot;'Word' is a three-letter word,&quot; is a grammatical English sentence,
&gt; though not a true English sentence; whereas, &quot;Word is a four-letter
&gt; word,&quot; is not a strictly grammatical English sentence.)

&gt;&gt; You continue in the same vein throughout.

&gt; Given your evident problems with English usage, I do not think you can
&gt; be competent to evaluate the &quot;vein&quot; in which I am writing, much less
&gt; to evaluate my writing either positively or negatively (that is, to
&gt; say whether my writing is good or bad).

&gt; You see, here I provided you with an example of what, in your own
&gt; writing, I object to. I also provide, in the same post, and indeed in
&gt; the same place in the post, an explanation of how the example I
&gt; provide relates to what I think of your post. You have not done this.
&gt; You have apparently named this activity, but not in fact carried it
&gt; out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't common usage of credential euphemistic? Does it make the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; differentiation between authority and veracity? I think it does
&gt; not.
&gt;&gt; Your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; criticism would be okay if there was such a distinction made in
&gt; normal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speech, but there is not. I am making such a distinction, rather
&gt; than
&gt;&gt; argue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on what common labels [words, phrases, tropes] are or 'should be'
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; use.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, the correct usage of the word &quot;credential&quot; or &quot;credentials&quot;
&gt; (which
&gt;&gt;&gt; is the same as the &quot;common&quot; usage) is not euphemistic.

&gt;&gt; This is a pale response. having raised the issue - your issue - and
after I
&gt;&gt; write you an additional paragraph, you just say 'no' ;))

&gt; You were the one who raised the issue of &quot;credentials&quot; being normally
&gt; used &quot;euphemistically.&quot; Perhaps you really believe this. It is
&gt; evident that you are not competent to determine, for yourself or for
&gt; anyone else, what is and is not normal English usage. Thus I thought
&gt; it might be helpful to point out that you have the facts wrong in this
&gt; instance.

&gt; You evidently think that pointing out that an individual has his facts
&gt; wrong is a &quot;pale&quot; response. If it was some other fact concerning what
&gt; I wrote that caused you to say this, I don't think anybody other than
&gt; you is aware of what that fact might be.

&gt; You go on to say that the meaning of your first sentence is modified
&gt; by the &quot;additional paragraph&quot; that &quot;[you] wrote [me].&quot; You are wrong.
&gt; The meaning of the first sentence in a paragraph is not modified by
&gt; the second sentence of the paragraph in the way that you evidently
&gt; believe, when the grammar of those sentences is such as the grammar of
&gt; your sentences is.

&gt; If you believe that you have read something that states, explicitly,
&gt; that I am wrong on this point, I suspect that you have misread badly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When we think it is in ideas, no? Not in words. I am addressing
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; ideas.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Past a certain point, your meaning becomes impossible to
&gt; retrieve.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course, one can wait a while and post your own message back to
&gt; you,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and see what you say in response.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any discussion must rest on what its words/signposts indicate.
&gt; That is,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where they point, not the words/signposts themselves, which are in
&gt; fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; substitutions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think you understand what you are saying. Did you notice
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you are contradicting yourself by saying that you are addressing
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; ideas and also that what we address in discussion must be the signs
&gt;&gt;&gt; and not the ideas? I think you didn't even notice that.

&gt;&gt; I did not say what you 'think' I said.

&gt;&quot;[W]hat [I] 'think' [you] said,&quot; as you describe it, is in my opinion
&gt; what any normal American, college-educated reader would construe out
&gt; of your post. It is certainly possible, given your evident problems
&gt; with English usage, that you did not intend to say what most people
&gt; would read you as having said.

&gt;&gt; I said specifically; what the sign/words INDICATE... not the words
&gt;&gt; themselves.

&gt; It is possible that I misunderstood. I thought you were speaking,
&gt; when you referred to &quot;ideas,&quot; about what a writer or reader is
&gt; _thinking of_; and then when you spoke of &quot;words/signposts,&quot; of what
&gt; the words signify regardless of what is &quot;in the mind of&quot; (as the
&gt; saying goes) any reader or writer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The clerics directed by the Pope, in any case.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong. They were the equivalent of university professors or
&gt; members
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the Royal Society.

&gt;&gt; ROFL! And are these offices at all seperate? And I think they can't be
quite
&gt;&gt; equivalent to the RS :)

&gt; You are correct that they are not entirely equivalent to the Royal
&gt; Society. In fact, the Royal Society played a large role in the
&gt; ability of amateurs -- persons outside Oxford and Cambridge and the
&gt; government bureaucracies -- to engage successfully in scientific
&gt; activity. In other words, had there been something like a Royal
&gt; Society in Galileo's time and in his nation, he probably would have
&gt; belonged to it, and it would have provided a social backing and a
&gt; credibility that living where and when he did, he had lacked. (I am
&gt; not certain whether the Royal Society is still able to play that role,
&gt; and if not, it may well now play a role more similar to that of the
&gt; societies and bureaucracies that it had once counteracted.)

&gt;&gt; But the point is that they were not suppressed for being incorrect
&gt;&gt; factually, or for poor methodology, or any number of academic reasons.
they
&gt;&gt; were suppressed because they were inconvenient to the establishment
whose
&gt;&gt; world view was that the Sun went around the earth; and they were
suppressed
&gt;&gt; by direct actions instigated by a Pope [who incidentally, Galileo
thought
&gt;&gt; would support him].

&gt;&gt; Do you in fact understand some different history than this? Maybe you
don't
&gt;&gt; like this report because you are a Catholic. I don't know.

&gt; I am not Catholic. Nor do I appreciate being told by non-Jews that
&gt; probably I only believe some fact, which they believe to be a
&gt; falsehood, because I'm Jewish, whether or not they are correct in
&gt; their surmise that I do believe that fact. I would not like this any
&gt; more if the adjective used were &quot;Catholic&quot; or &quot;American&quot; or &quot;female&quot;
&gt; or &quot;a saxophone player.&quot; There are certainly so many cultural
&gt; differences separating you and me, not to mention more trivial
&gt; differences of cultural history, that there would seem to be little
&gt; justification for your having assumed that the reason we differ on
&gt; this point must be because I'm Catholic. I could list the various
&gt; sources from which my knowledge of Galileo and his case were drawn;
&gt; only some of them could be justly described as &quot;Catholic,&quot; and as a
&gt; whole (and they do form a coherent whole) they most certainly could
&gt; not be so described.

&gt; I don't know whether or not Buffalo is Catholic, but he is more
&gt; correct than you are. He seems to be able to describe the Jesuit side
&gt; of the dispute. You, on the other hand, seem to possess an
&gt; exceedingly simplistic &quot;theory&quot; of how one should explain what had
&gt; happened, and no interest at all in connecting your theory to the
&gt; facts. You seem to have read a political tract concerning &quot;how
&gt; politicians control the sciences,&quot; and another concerning &quot;Popery,&quot;
&gt; and concluded that you could now discuss the details of the history.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They had &quot;credentials&quot; -- degrees and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; positions given to them because they were seen to deserve those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; positions for some reason;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No no. They were appointees, party men. And should they have

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Bianca&quot;, your responses do not address what I wrote.

&gt;&gt; My remarks do indeed address what you wrote. You have not shown that
&gt;&gt; my remarks do not address what you wrote. Your example, below, is
&gt;&gt; insufficient to demonstrate that my remarks, as you say, do not
&gt;&gt; address what you wrote. The insufficiency of your supposed

&gt;&gt; to. I am trying to find a level low enough for you to comprehend; it
&gt;&gt; seems we have not yet reached that level.

&gt; Thank you Bianca. I now have a good sense of what your standard is and
your
&gt; method of addressing a topic. No need to reply further on my acount.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Which also includes the differences between men and women; whether a
blastocyst is a living human being; economic theory; and psychology.
Not to mention the social sciences. Theology also encompasses any
area in which theological doctrines are seen as a good metaphor, good
enough to pass from metaphor to actual truth, for theories usually
expressed in other terms. (And if truth itself is part of theology,
then the ultimate arbiter of theology will also be the ultimate
arbiter of scientific truth.)

What you've described is what I understand to be the understanding of
the dividing line generally possessed by American liberals, most of
those I personally know being Jews, or persons with college educations
in science, and by at least some French writers, at least as I
understand them. Perhaps also by J.S. Mill, who isn't taken all that
seriously these days, especially outside the English-speaking world,
which means also _inside_ most of academia. What you've described is,
as I understand it, compatible with Jewish and with much Protestant
theology, but not with Catholic (unless the beliefs of most Catholics
are taken as prescribing what Catholic theology in fact is).

In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Catholic Church rejected
the Islamist solution of separate spheres for scientific and
theological reason. Thus, any solution would have to build on the
philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas. Most modern solutions depend,
basically, on the idea of separate spheres.

We secular humanists, on the other hand, take the opposite tack: if it
can be shown using scientific reason, there's no need for theology.
Theology can be permitted, rationally, so long as it doesn't stray
into the territory of what ought to be the domain of science.

You would seem to be dismissing all of scholarship in history of
science, as &quot;urban myth&quot; and merely &quot;popular.&quot; Is that your
intention? Because standard scholarship is closer to what you're
dismissing than it is to what you're saying is correct (and as it
happens, I've yet to see you come up with anything based on historical
scholarship, rather than on theology-derived polemics, of the sort
that an Oxbridge snob might typically produce).

You seem to be describing the &quot;double truth&quot; crisis of 1277. But the

the immortality of the soul, and of limits on God's freedom to act,

Augustine of Hippo. (The great achievement of St. Thomas Aquinas, in

You seem to have completely ignored the following, which I repeat:

Cardinal Bellarmine, a contemporary of Galileo, wrote:

I say that if a real proof be found that the sun is fixed
and does not revolve round the earth, but the earth round
the sun, then it will be necessary, very carefully, to
proceed to the explanation of the passages of Scripture
which appear to be contrary, and we should rather say that
we have misunderstood these than pronounce that to be false
which is demonstrated.

In other words, &quot;If Galileo can prove he's right, then the Church has to
get out his way.&quot; (But not until then.) The Church admitted that he
was right a long time ago. (No, that's not what the recent
reinvestigation of the Galileo affair was about; that was a
reexamination of his condemnation for getting up the Church's nose, of
which he was certainly guilty.)

Galileo's important work, by the way, was in mechanics, where he laid
most of the foundations for Newton. As the first astronomer to use a
telescope, he made a few important breakthroughs, but he was not a
systematic astronomer in any way. If he /had/ been, he probably would
have been able to convince the Church's men, and all the unpleasantness
would have been avoided. But instead, he marched in as an amateur
(brilliant, perhaps, but an amateur), insisting that he was right and
the professionals were all wrong, and consequently made himself and his
cause look foolish.

(Note that the /only/ restriction that had been placed on him was that
he not insist that Copernicus was true unless he could prove it. The
Church had allowed Copernicus to be taught as a theory for generations.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;A great deal of the popular &quot;knowledge&quot; concerning Galileo is urban
&gt;&gt;myth, just like the various urban myths about Columbus.
&gt; You would seem to be dismissing all of scholarship in history of

No, in my own private idiolect of English, claims are made by linking a
subject to a predicate.

&gt; Is that your

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; intention? Because standard scholarship is closer to what you're
&gt; dismissing than it is to what you're saying is correct (and as it
&gt; happens, I've yet to see you come up with anything based on historical

And precisely how much do you know about &quot;standard scholarship&quot; as
applying to 17th-century Italian history? Let me guess. You learned it
all from your 7th-grade science teacher?

to
&gt;&gt; rebuke
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Galileo on astronomical credentials, but on religious/political
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credentials.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not so. They questioned him on grounds of astronomy, about which
they
&gt;&gt; (the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jesuits) knew quite a bit more than he did.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah. Thank you! But what erudition! Now I understand what this writer's
&gt;&gt;&gt; standard of 'eminently reasonable'.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose that our Jesuit friends, or possibly Bianca's
universitarians,
&gt;&gt;&gt; threatening to lock the old guy up for the rest of his life was of no
&gt;&gt;&gt; consequence?

&gt;&gt; In terms of establishing whether they challenged him on scientific
grounds,
&gt;&gt; or on some other grounds? No, it's of no consequence, obviously.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I especially liked your &quot;all they demanded&quot; since presumably no
&gt;&gt;&gt; one had struck upon the method of investigation by hypothesis at this
&gt;&gt; time.

&gt;&gt; I believe investigation by hypothesis is about the only way of
investigating
&gt;&gt; anything - including the authorship of the Shakespeare canon. Galileo
had a
&gt;&gt; hypothesis; and the Jesuits had the same or similar hypothesis - but
nobody
&gt;&gt; had any proof. Where is this going?

&gt;&gt;&gt; And of course, since no one else had conducted the heretical activity
of
&gt;&gt;&gt; making empirical studies based on the hypothesis, why should they do
so
&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves?

&gt;&gt; You're trying to pass a false coin disguised as a rhetorical question.
The
&gt;&gt; Jesuit astronomers had been doing empirical research in their subject
for
&gt;&gt; decades. It was Galileo who hadn't been doing any.

That's all folks!

This is from the guy who snips comments in order to disgrace others. What a

doesn't acknowledge them, but who likes to write (sic) in other's writing.

Of course its all great fun for club-Strat members to speak of others'
inability to speak a natural language, however, this schtick should remain
here in this newsgroup since Nil just tried it in the chess newsgroup and
was handed his head for his own pathetic lack of comprehension, as usual.

Here we find David Webb demonSTRATing his standards with a typical

Mooooo!

David Webb - I made an error writing u not e. You have snipped the original
sequence to make your usual style of dismal commentary.

You rarely have anything to say which does not promote your own superiority
directly at the expense of someone else.

This is not the mark of a confident man, entirely the opposite. You
understand the psychology of the self-hater, no? Other people must be
reduced lower than your own self-esteem, as the only viable mechanism to
keep the personality going.

What is truly comic is that your obsessions here on authorship are so
serious, so vehement! Yet no one has written more than a few words to ever
state why that is so, and those words pedestrian.

But like a convocation of priest/curators assembled round the mystery of
the cargo-cult item left behind by the Creator, an object that no one is
able to re-create themselves, belief in its providence is a deadly serious
business, and justifies almost any behavior irrespective of what gospel is
contained within.

This is the subject of this thread.

Nil, why not tell the truth for once?

You have raised the subject of your chess award some 20 times now in a
Shakespeare newsgroup group, after //inventing// a comment by me purporting
to denigrate your article. A piece of writing which I have never read, never
mentioned in fact, nor expressed the slightest interest in doing so.

Mr. Kennedy of the chess newsgroup has independently pointed out to you that
you choose to confute this subject with comments on your slatternly public
writing on chess subjects.

But you do not relate other circumstances why you find it difficult to
become a //published// writer. Should I tell the people why that is? Or will
you?

Hint: This thread concerns how we go about studying Shakespearean subjects,
eg. It is a measure of your own comprehension if fact you can determine
this. Should you wish to advertise your award further, why not do so in a
thread dedicated to that subject in a newsgroup pertaining to chess writing,
histories and so on? I would suggest chess.misc as being the appropriate
forum.

I am drawing the logical conclusion from what you wrote. If what you
write does not successfully convey what you are thinking, as might be
the case at any time for anyone whose writing skills are less than
perfect, you will inadvertently create an effect similar to my having
set up a &quot;straw man&quot; -- but you will be the one at fault. What you
wrote was what someone would write who believed that (as I described
it) &quot;the lionization of Galileo by subsequent history [subsequent to
Galileo] is based on a fraud.&quot; If this is not what you believe, then
you either expressed your own belief poorly, or have misread the
authority on which you are relying, or are relying on an authority who
had expressed his or her own belief poorly.

&gt;&gt; you have any reason to say so, other than that this might be the

I do not believe that asking a person for the reason why he believes
something is uncivil. I do believe that if you were to answer that
what you said was (as I described it) &quot;the common opinion in the
circles in which you travel,&quot; you would have given a sufficient answer
to that question.

It would seem to be reasonable to assume that you had a reason for
what you said, and that the set of possible reasons can be assumed to
be exhausted by the following possibilities: you consider it common
knowledge, you read it in or were told it by a person or author you
consider reliable, you came to your own conclusion using a method of
reasoning you consider reliable.

It seems plausible to me that any of these might be the case, though
the first two seem most likely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Are you Catholic? If not, how do you know?

&gt; I can read.

"/>

I can read, also. I suspect that I have read more, in certain areas
relevant to the subject, than you have. Probably you have read more
in other areas than I have.

First, you, John W. Kennady, and I obviously differ on the question
&quot;what science says.&quot; If you believe that Roman Catholicism is in
agreement with science on some or all points, you and I are probably
not going to agree on this point, either. I don't know what you base
your belief on. I am aware of an argument that relies on the idea
that the Roman Catholic Church is an authority and as such would not
teach anything untrue. I don't accept this argument.

In addition, based on my reading, I believe that it would be rational
for the position taken by the Roman Catholic Church to be what you
described it to be. I do not believe it would be necessary for that
position to be what you described it to be. Based on some things you
posted, I think you might be likely to conclude, from the fact that
the position were rational, that the position must also be necessary.
I don't think such a conclusion on your part would be logically
correct.

arguments put forward by the Roman Catholic Church fail to overlap
with arguments that in the West are considered scientific or
scholarly. It is, in fact, clear that there are efforts being made to
reconcile these two sets of arguments. In my opinion, the arguments
relied on by the Catholic Church require, at some point, that a
Western adherent of the scientific worldview abandon that worldview,
in order to accept an argument that _might_ otherwise be capable of
being made consistent with that worldview.

As a non-Catholic, speaking now as an individual citizen and not on an
intellectual basis, I try to recognize that I am not able to know what
would seem to be required by a Catholic, in order to remain within the
bounds of his or her faith and of the requirements of that faith.
Many Catholics do seem, according to public statements made by them,
to find it difficult if not impossible to reconcile the beliefs they
have acquired from the scientific worldview with their faith and with
the requirements on them as Catholics.

I am drawing the logical conclusion from what you wrote. If what you
write does not successfully convey what you are thinking, as might be
the case at any time for anyone whose writing skills are less than
perfect, you will inadvertently create an effect similar to my having
set up a &quot;straw man&quot; -- but you will be the one at fault. What you
wrote was what someone would write who believed that (as I described
it) &quot;the lionization of Galileo by subsequent history [subsequent to
Galileo] is based on a fraud.&quot; If this is not what you believe, then
you either expressed your own belief poorly, or have misread the
authority on which you are relying, or are relying on an authority who
had expressed his or her own belief poorly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Do
&gt;&gt; you have any reason to say so, other than that this might be the
&gt;&gt; common opinion in the circles in which you travel?

&gt; If you can't keep a civil tongue in your head, kindly leave.

"/>

I do not believe that asking a person for the reason why he believes
something is uncivil. I do believe that if you were to answer that
what you said was (as I described it) &quot;the common opinion in the
circles in which you travel,&quot; you would have given a sufficient answer
to that question.

It would seem to be reasonable to assume that you had a reason for
what you said, and that the set of possible reasons can be assumed to
be exhausted by the following possibilities: you consider it common
knowledge, you read it in or were told it by a person or author you
consider reliable, you came to your own conclusion using a method of
reasoning you consider reliable.

It seems plausible to me that any of these might be the case, though
the first two seem most likely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Are you Catholic? If not, how do you know?

&gt; I can read.

"/>

I can read, also. I suspect that I have read more, in certain areas
relevant to the subject, than you have. Probably you have read more
in other areas than I have.

First, you, John W. Kennady, and I obviously differ on the question
&quot;what science says.&quot; If you believe that Roman Catholicism is in
agreement with science on some or all points, you and I are probably
not going to agree on this point, either. I don't know what you base
your belief on. I am aware of an argument that relies on the idea
that the Roman Catholic Church is an authority and as such would not
teach anything untrue. I don't accept this argument.

In addition, based on my reading, I believe that it would be rational
for the position taken by the Roman Catholic Church to be what you
described it to be. I do not believe it would be necessary for that
position to be what you described it to be. Based on some things you
posted, I think you might be likely to conclude, from the fact that
the position were rational, that the position must also be necessary.
I don't think such a conclusion on your part would be logically
correct.

Furthermore, and for me decisive, it is not in fact the case that the
arguments put forward by the Roman Catholic Church fail to overlap
with arguments that in the West are considered scientific or

Does it not occur to you, even for a moment, that as an atheist whose
ancestors were Jewish, living in a society of atheists whose ancestors
were Puritans, you just /might/ be a little bit ill-informed about Roman
Catholic doctrine? The sad fact is that your understanding of Roman
Catholicism is at a strictly comic-book level, as has been demonstrated
before this. But it is made worse by the fact that you have now twice
refused to acknowledge evidence that might disturb your bigoted little
