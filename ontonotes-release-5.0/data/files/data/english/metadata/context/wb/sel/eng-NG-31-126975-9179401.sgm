F. There were at least two different endings to &quot;Old Yeller&quot;.

By definition, a snuff film is one in which the film is the *purpose* of
(rather than incidental to) the murder and with some intent of commercial
distribution (i.e. if they ran out of film, the murder would be postponed
until someone could run down to the 7-11 &amp; get more). Paul Lanning, the
FBI's chief researcher into child pornography was quoted by _The Times_
of London:

&quot;In 20 years I have not seen any hard evidence that they have
commercially produced sexually explicit films of murders for the
gratification of other people.  Simulated snuff movies using
special effects are so realistic there is no point in risking life
in jail.&quot;

Note to the new reader: please don't send or post e-mail saying &quot;snuff movies
*could* exist, because people are naughty enough&quot; - this is not in dispute;
the point is that no examples have yet come to light.  Until someone shows
evidence of their existence, snuff films are in the same category as UFO's,
the Loch Ness monster, and Bruce Willis's hair -- i.e. &quot;believed false.&quot;
