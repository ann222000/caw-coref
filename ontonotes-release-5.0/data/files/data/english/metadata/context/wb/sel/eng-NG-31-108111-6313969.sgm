Maple tree bark

I think I had posted this to health once, but I'm perplexed.  All 3 of
my dogs are eating bark off of my maple tree.  Just one tree, none of
the others (only one other maple available to them, and it's a
different variety).  Lucy seems more voracious than the other two, but
perhaps that is just due to the fact that she is a more gluttonous dog
in general!

I can't detect any sap or such, and this only started this
fall/winter.

Does anyone have any experience with bark eating dogs?  I tell them to
stop, they do, no big deal, but I get the feeling that if I left them
out there, they would love to gorge themselves on the stuff!

I'm thinking of getting tree-wound-care-dressing to both deter them
and make sure the tree is not being damaged.  This is an enormous tree
- double the height of the 2 story house.  I really don't want
anything to happen to it!

Insects of any type?  Fungus?  Could be sap.

DH is out in the woods this afternoon or I could ask him now.  But as soon
as he gets back in, I'll see if he has any thoughts - either as a tree
person or as a maple person.

The sap is running strong up here in the further-northeast.  Sap season gets
earlier every year - and the early runs are the best.  The maple producers
are either tapping trees now or getting ready to or convinced that they are
going to wish that they had.  DH grew up in a family with sap in their veins
(225+ years in the same location here).  Even though he left the family
business, he loves to do the tapping in the spring.  Loves being outside and
in the woods, even if the weather is terrible.  Loves the physicalness of
the work.  Loves the actual purpose of it.

Okay, my maple tree guy says that his best guess is that there was some sort
of injury to the tree bark and the sap got started leaking out.  One dog
found it and worked it and the rest have followed, keeping the sap leaking
and rewarding the dogs.

He didn't know of any particular insect infestation that could be attacking
the tree and interesting the dogs.

His advice is to get the tree wrapped ASAP.

Not just a maple.  The hard (sugar) maple is used because it has the
sweetest sap - and therefore is the easiest (!) to boil down into syrup.
Other trees can be and are used to make syrup.  People make birch syrup, for
example.

But you must be very, very patient.  And the flavors do vary.

Probably, off the top of his head, he knows the sugar content of all those
other trees, but I don't.

St Lawrence Nurseries sells silver maples for syrup - they
say it's "productive of an excellent sap for syrup,"
although they don't mention a specific sugar content.  They
do have a (rather expensive) Sweet Sap Sugar Maple that has
sap with a sugar content of 3-5%, and that's the one I was
thinking of planting.

However, instead of skiing and mushing I've been working
through gardening plans for the year, and I think I'm going
to forgo putting in more trees this year in favor of getting
in some grapes as well as a vegetable garden and maybe some
strawberries.  The limiting factor here has always been
water/irrigation, but I think I'm going to put an outside
faucet on the west side of the house so that I'd be able to
put a garden out there and not have to haul buckets to keep
stuff wet, like I do with the fruit trees.

Trust me on this.  You do not want to plant any silver maples.  It has the
usual problem people experience with maples, which is that the surface roots
prevent just about anything from growing underneath it (I'm still trying to
figure out what works), and it has a strong proclivity towards throwing
limbs (brittle wood).

Strawberries are easy.  A bit on the invasive side, but easy enough to
remove if it becomes a pest.  There appears to be some art involved in
getting grapes to fruit (espallier and heavy pruning recommended; otherwise,
you'll need a sturdy arbor), and they attract yellowjackets.

Do you have any rain barrels?  That should help with the irrigation as well.
I've seen some that had spigots attached, so you may even be able to run a
hose instead of hauling buckets.

We've got maples all over the place up here and I've got a
few in the yard.  One old red maple gave up the ghost about
8 years ago but otherwise they're really not a problem.
Farm, 13 acres, etc.  Aside from being beautiful, I'd like
the syrup.  St Lawrence claims that the Silver Maple variety
they're selling will be ready to tap in 8-10 years, which
means by the time I'm 60.  I'm not getting any younger, and
boy, I am really not getting any younger in a hurry.

Right - I can move those around with the front end loader on
the tractor.  Right now I'm hauling 5 gallon buckets in a
trailer behind the quad and I really don't like using that
much gasoline for it.  Unfortunately it's about 300' out to
the back of the orchard.  Talking to Dr Well about putting a
hydrant out in the yard is on my "To do" list.

DH says - 3-5% isn't impossible.  It could be bred to do that.  To get that
kind of numbers, it should also be out in the open (maximum crown) and be
fertilized.  Typically hard maples would be from 1.5 - 4 %, depending on a
whole bunch of factors, including the genetics.

The silver maple would be substantially less.

That would be true of silver maples - they are susceptible to ice buildup

Again, my resident maple expert says that 10 years for silver maples is
reasonable.  But you are going to be doing a lot of boiling to get that
syrup.

If you're really determined to give it a try, are there any neighbors who
have trees that you could tap in return for a share of the syrup?  And if
you're looking for used equipment for a small (tiny) operation, I have
relatives who would know about such things.

And I'd still plant the trees.  But then that's true of me every year.
Always plant the trees.

Definitely don't do that.  Tapping the trees affects their timber value so
it's always a trade-off.  Either Gutchess or Cotton-Hanlin (I'm guessing
your back neighbor) will not want their trees tapped.  Most small operations
get started with some lawn trees - which is actually not a bad thing.  Lawn
trees don't make good timber.  And lawn trees have big crowns which make for
sweeter sap.

Not up there.  But one down here who handles syrup equipment over a very

Could you hold it off for just one more freaking day?  We drove up to Ithaca
this morning in fog and rain.  (And WHEN are they going to paint lines on

are non-existent under those conditions!)  And DH is out watching the

But the dogs both went 4 for 4 on their runs so we're riding a pretty good

Another thought is that now that the dogs are tearing at the bark that
you're leaving a damaged surface for other invaders.  That's why you'd wrap
