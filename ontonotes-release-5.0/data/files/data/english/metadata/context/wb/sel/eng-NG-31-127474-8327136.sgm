I'm worried about even reading the cover of the book. I might explode.
I can barely stomach a post by traveller.

If this was a study as you say, what was your null hypothesis or the
hypothetical construct that you were testing since we would have to
assume this is social scientific research...  What was the independent
variable?  The dependent variable?  Other variables?  Outliers?  What
were your results?  Any discussion?  If none of this applies, it was
not a study, sorry, best is that it was an illusion like most of what
you say.

Delusional? out!

Wow. Your posts have become much more entertaining over these months.
Seriously, I doubt he meant he was doing a &quot;study&quot; in the academic
sense. Have you read some of his posts? I'm sorry, but I cannot carry
that kind of faith....lol.

A novel based on miscontrual of any &quot;fact&quot; gleaned from a source is
poorly conceived.  Moreover your clear lack of wit during this pilot
phase of your creative misadventure and your demonstration of a rather
sophomoric grade of language does not bode well for whatever artistic
emanation with which you are going to vulgarize our presence should a
publisher ever have the gusto to sign such drivel - which I reasonably
doubt at this point.

Mike L.  Them that must Ask...cannot know. They which knows...has no
need of Question.

He who would lead must first follow.  He who would hear must first
listen.  He who would receive the spirit must first be emptied of the
self.

The night is dark that has no Star...how dark the heart when Love is
far.  Sometimes a Joy may be born out of much pain...as a Rose may
blossom amidst many thorns.

Unless we are made new again...we canot see....we cannot hear.  All
words are old words. All experience is old experience...the only truth
is NOW...in this instant!  The heart that awakens lives and changes.
The Heart that sleeps...comes again and again to learn the lesson it
has refused for so long to see.

The truest slavery is Avarice...no chain can bind us as completely as
our own Ambition.

The mind that dreams can also destroy...such Power has a thought!

Thanx anyway!!!!!

I prefer poems to say something that provokes thought. Failing that,
beauty of language alone will do. Trite, badly written, meaning-free

Are you aware that your post makes no sense? Perhaps you should
attempt a course in basic English before moving on to poetry or any
other art.

He's getting better. We're all at different places.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poetry is subjective.  however, it does appear that are thoughtfullly

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you aware that your post makes no sense? Perhaps you should
&gt; &gt; &gt; attempt a course in basic English before moving on to poetry or any
&gt; &gt; &gt; other art.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Look, you keep threatening to leave, and then you remain to come out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with more meaning-free crap. Stop it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I liked that poem.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer poems to say something that provokes thought. Failing that,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beauty of language alone will do. Trite, badly written, meaning-free
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crap with pretensions, I'll leave to you to enjoy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He who would lead must first follow.  He who would hear must first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listen.  He who would receive the spirit must first be emptied of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The night is dark that has no Star...how dark the heart when Love is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far.  Sometimes a Joy may be born out of much pain...as a Rose may
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blossom amidst many thorns.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless we are made new again...we canot see....we cannot hear.  All
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; words are old words. All experience is old experience...the only truth
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is NOW...in this instant!  The heart that awakens lives and changes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Heart that sleeps...comes again and again to learn the lesson it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has refused for so long to see.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The truest slavery is Avarice...no chain can bind us as completely as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own Ambition.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mind that dreams can also destroy...such Power has a thought!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanx anyway!!!!!
