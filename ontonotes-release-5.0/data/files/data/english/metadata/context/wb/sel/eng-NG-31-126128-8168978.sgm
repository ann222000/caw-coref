there seems to be nothing americans take more for granted  than
freedom. we feel that freedom comes naturally, that it is the way of
things. it's something we don't think about.  since freedom is so
abundant and boundless, we don't treat it as a precious commodity.  we
treat it as fish treat water. we consume it like air.   we think it
exists for us to use in whatever manner for the purpose of 'self-
fulfilment'.   we are blind to the ecology of freedom. we are also
blind to its origins and the requirements that make sustainable
freedom possible.

think of a fish tank. there may be plenty of water but it has to be
kept clean.  a water where the fish eat and shi* too much, which is
never filtered or replaced is dirty foul water indeed. in time, even
the fish die.  same could be said of our freedom.

it could be said that freedom is the most precious thing in modern
societies. but, we don't feel this way.  possibly, it's because it's
available to all, from richest man to the poorest man. we define
preciousness in terms of exclusivity, expensiveness, and rarity. we
say sapphire is precious.  but, how can something so available to all
be said to be precious?  that's like saying water is precious. yet, it
is precisely for this reason that it is the most precious thing we
have.  it is something that belongs to all and allows for endless
opportunities for good or evil.
actually, freedom is eyond precious.  it is priceless.  it is
priceless because it is so useful and essential to what we call
modernity.  there was a time when freedom was precious than priceless,
and there are many places like that in the world--places where freedom
is the privilege of only a few and powerful.   in such places,  most
people don't have freedom of movement, commerce, communication,
expression, opportunity, etc.  freedom is monopolized only by the
powerful.
yet, in the US, freedom is not monopolized by the powerful.  to be
sure, the intelligent and ambitious--as well as the ruthless and
unscrupulous--use freedom to gain great wealth and power.  even so,
freedom is available to us all.   any of us can use freedom to take on
the wealthy and powerful, or the popular and demagogic.

how freedom came about should remind us of how precious or priceless
freedom is for humanity at large. indeed, the idea of freedom didn't
even exist for the powerful until relatively recently.  freedom was
first gained by the elites and then spread throughout the masses. for
most of history, even the elites had to obey the sacred laws or time-
worn customs or traditions.  one may say freedom really began with the
ancient greeks when the educated elite sought free inquiry as to the
workings of the universe--previously the realm of gods--, human
affairs, arts, and so on.  for the ancient greeks, the arts weren't
merely traditional ritualism but individual expression by folks such
as sophocles.  but, this freedom reserved for the elite was shaky and
would be eclipsed by bigger political forces.  it rose again during
the renaissance with the rise of humanism. then, it reached another
milestone with the rise of the french bourgeoisie during the
enlightenment.  and, it was finally established as a system for all
men in the united states.
this process was long, arduous, uncertain, dangerous, and
painstaking.  freedom didn't come freely or came free.  mankind had to
pay a huge price for its triumph. yet, we treat freedom as though
we've naturally been born WITH it.  in fact, we are born INTO it, and
such condition exists only because of the progress of history.

we say that animals in the wild are free, and there is some truth to
this. but,this kind of freedom has little or nothing to do with modern
freedom that we prize much.  animals may be free to roam about but in
a world of endless dangers, it essentially means getting eaten by some
bigger animal. it mean free lunch and not for you but you yourself for
the bigger creature.  this kind of freedom exists in many parts of
subsaharan africa or in failed states where there is no rule of law.
the tough, ruthless, savage, and strong rob from, rape, or kill the
weak. if this is freedom, it's worse than slavery.  would you rather
be a black slave in the american south or some liberian savage whose
whole family is hacked to death by laughing, singing, and dancing
thugs with machetes and spears?
the animal world is very much like this.  for this reason, both the
animal world and primitive man distrusted freedom.  freedom meant
dangers all around you.  in order to survive, pack animals and
primitive human tribes established rigid and cohesive social units in
which every member had to play his part and respect the hierarchy.  it
was internal rigidity as a shield against external anarchy. a wolfpack
has a very strict sense of who's the top wolf and who's the bottom
wolf.  otherwise, the pack couldn't stick together; it would be too
busy fighting itself.
same was true of primitive human communities.  there was no sense of
individualism within the primitive tribe.  everyone knew what was
right, what was sacred, what was allowed and not allowed.  the
tribesmen stuck together and had great fear for animals and enemy
tribes.
in the world of nature, animals and men were captive to bigger animals
and/or stronger tribes. there was no freedom as in walking about
without worry, thinking one's own thoughts, asking questions about
what is true or not true.   such indulgences could get you killed or
eaten.  you had to stick together with your group against dangerous
animals and enemy tribes. you had to be constantly alert to the
dangers around you.

when man began to create civilization, he was more or less safe from
natural forces.   around great cities or settlements, there was far
less danger of being eaten by dangerous beasts.
civilized or settled man was no longer captive to animals or nature.
he was 'free' of nature to a great extent.  also, as a city or a large
settlement had many people, there was also greater trust for man as a
whole.   in primitive societies, a person may have total trust and
share total intimacy with members of that tribe yet feel total
distrust and hostility for members of other tribes.  in a city or
large settlement,  you felt neither total intimacy nor total hostility
with most of the people around you.  so, there was a greater sense of
freedom and independence; you could lose yourself in the crowd; you
could go about your own business.  yet, there were strict and complex
social hierarchies distinguishing kings from nobility, nobility from
merchants, merchants from traders, traders from peasants, peasants
from slaves, etc.
as those with power and those without power feared the other, there
was little sense of individual freedom.  kings and nobility were too
occupied with their power to think or experiment with new ideas.  they
feared that if any element of the system was changed, they would fall
and lose their power.  so, for the sake of their power and privilege,
they didn't encourage freedom for others nor practice it much for
themselves. the rich and powerful in such society surely had their
pleasures, luxury, and fun, but they didn't think it prudent to think
new ideas; new ideas could mean new possibilities, and new
possibilities could mean new social orders; and new social orders
could mean loss of the power for those with power.   so, the rich and
powerful were fearful of freedom not just for the masses but for
themselves.
as for the masses of lower classes, their lives were too hard and
ignorant to think intellectual stuff.  at most, an oppressed people
could think of 'freedom from' but not freedom as freedom. for example,
a conquerered people could dream of freedom from the conquerors or
enslavers; but this didn't mean freedom of conscience, freedom of
thought, freedom of possibilities.  this mentality is strong even
today in many parts of the world, even among the western elite.  when
the era of western colonialism was coming to an end, many enlightened
intellectuals celebrated how people of the third world were being
liberated and freed from imperialism.  problem was while they were
being liberated from imperialist rule, they were soon to be oppressed
by the internal forces of age-old tribalism, feudalism, and worse.
zimbabwe was freed from british rule in the 80s, yet it's obvious that
national freedom is not the same as social, political, or individual
freedom.
and consider the case of hong kong. unlike most of mainland china, it
was still under the rule of british colonialism until 1997.   china
was nationally free, hong kong wasn't. yet, which place was socially,
politically, and individually more free?  communist china or british
ruled hong kong?
and in iraq, being liberated from US occupation forces will not mean
liberation of the iraqi soul.  it could be iraq will come under the
rule of guys like mucktard al sadr.

to be sure, there were free spirits thru human history.  but, usually
these people were terribly alone, persecuted and killed, or lived in
exile or self-exile. think of jesus or buddha.  jesus was killed real
bad. and buddha had no place to call home. he constantly traveled and
preached to those who'd listen.  we have a tendency to condemn the
oppressive forces of pre-modern societies that persecuted heretics.
but, we must understand that maintaining order, peace, stability, and
security were no sure things in the past.  there was constant danger
posed to every fiefdom, kingdom, or such from both outside and inside
thru military attacks, conspiratorial plotting, and so on.  indeed,
freedom introduced to unstable societies often do more harm than
good.   modern or enlightened freedom could not arise without security
and law &amp; order. and, most pre-modern societies didn't feel safe,
secure, or confident enough to permit greater freedom. as far as the
rulers and people were concerned, more freedom would only mean greater
social chaos and weakness; indeed, even the masses weren't too keen on
freedom.  indeed, russians today love putin because he quelled many
freedoms and re-established order.   indeed, democracy has to grow out
of stability and security that exists, not plonked down amidst chaos.
you can only work for the social good when there is reasonable amount
of stability; indeed, look at iraq where US has tried to set up a
democratic government in the midst of social mayhem and warfare, or
consider the failure of the provisional government in russia during
WWII.   to be sure, too much law and order is antithetical to freedom
and democracy--look at cuba and north korea. but, even such is a
better foundation for future longterm freedom than places like haiti
or liberia where modern freedom is unlikely  ever to take root.

at any rate, power isn't necessarily the same as freedom. when the
basis for power and social stability is naked power or rule by fear,
then even the rulers are fearful of freedom.  fidel castro, mugabe,
and kim jong il may be powerful and live in great luxury, but they too
are prisoners of the system.  so are the immediate circle around them.
their power, privilege, and luxury are all dependent on strict social
order and stability.  within their enclosed circle, they are free to
indulge in fine cuisine, movies from all over the world, and other
goodies. but, they cannot freely express their personal views or ideas
in the public sphere.  if they did that, they could start an avalanche
of social change that will bring them down.  indeed, we saw just this
in the case of mikhail gorbachev.  gorby thought he could be top
communist leader and an openly free thinker/reformer.  yet, the very
example he set forth weakened the entire system.  so, for a tyrant to
maintain power, he must remember that his freedom too is very
limited.  there may be no limit to his luxury and privilege, but as he
must symbolize social/political unity and solidarity, he must be a
human statue--like the emperors of china had no choice but to be
emperor and do all the emperor-sy things.
same thing was true under communism.   a tyrant has the power to
oppress but not the power to be free. think of kurosawa's Ran where
the great lord hidetora, who established his territory thru bloodshed,
changes course and acts more humanely. what follows is chaos.
for there to be humane rule, there need to be more than a change in
leadership. there must be the establishment of a system of rule and
law which is more powerful than any individual or group.  and, this
system was developed only very slowly and painstakingly.  it was the
product of genius and accident.

it was with the enlightenment that mankind--in some parts of europe--
envisioned a system where rulers would not only have power but also
freedom.  since political system would be formulated thru reason,
political power would not be a matter of a tyrant's whim or
conspiratorial ruthlessness.  since the political system would
stabilize and govern society, freedom would be shared by all. leaders
need not fear the led, and the led need not fear the leaders.  reason
would rule mankind.   and reason was available to all men as a tool
for coordination, communication, consensus.
prior to reason, men ruled by an iron fist or with the blessing of
divinity.   iron fist had no justification beyond its ruthlessness. as
for divine mandate, there was no way to prove or disprove it, no way
to argue about it. ignorant people were made to believe in the king's
divine authority and bow down.
this was the great experimentation of the french revolution and the
american revolution.
why then did the french revolution fail while the american revolution
succeed?
the problem with the french revolution is it tried to do too much all
at once.  also, there was overconfidence in reason.  for all the talk
of reason, many french revolutionaries were radicals who thought they
monopolized Reason--just as some people think they have a direct line
to god, some people think their reason is Reason itself(just look at
al gore or richard dawkins; reason, as opposed to Reason, has as many
faces as there are people). Reason, as opposed to reason, was the new
god.  also, there was overconfidence in the masses.  it was the
extreme opposite of overconfidence in the king.   there was a time
when the king was entirely right.  after the king was deposed, there
was the sense that the people were entirely right. as most french
masses were ignorant illiterate slobs, this practically meant mobs
manipulated by demagogues and radicals.
also, french revolution taught us that emotions are just as important
as reason in the stability of societies. indeed, reason must serve the
matters of the heart. the idea of good or evil is really a matter of
the heart, not of the mind.  before we can rationally devise what is
good for mankind, we must feel it. and this feeling has been shaped
thru spiritualism and such.
because the french revolutionaries were so much into iron-fisted
Reason, they suppressed all matters of the heart. they felt that one
had to be cold, calculating, and ruthless in order to be a man of
Reason. otherwise, you were a mushy irrationalist.  robespierre and
jacobins epitomized cold-hearted, pure, and ruthless Reason.

in contrast, american social reality was less an experiment than a
work in progress. there was no overzealous trust in Reason,
Revolution, the People, or some such.  rather, the emphasis was on
establishing a system that would coordinate and negotiate all the
different groups, individuals, cultures, religions, and such within
the nation.
the founding fathers built an edifice upon which no one could stand at
top.  leaders and the led were all to remain on ground level. what
would tower over mankind would be the system of laws and justice.   in
contrast, the french political tower was about the leaders trying to
stand on top of the dome as the champion of Reason.  it was about
Reason, not reason.
the american founding fathers built a system and let the system work
according to its own rules.  the french pounding brothers believed
either in smashing all of the old or in building an absolutist state
of Reason, or both.  the logical product of this was napoleon.  french
had gotten rid of a king for an emperor.
still, the longterm impact of the enlightenment was freedom for all
men.  in time, both US and enlightened nations of europe developed the
concept and system of freedom for the people. this was no longer mere
fantasy because mankind had finally come upon a social, political, and
economic system that was strong enough, stable enough, and flexible
enough to accomodate and prosper from the freedom of the people.
the leaders were, more or less, enlightened and tolerant. and masses
were, more or less, respectful and disciplined.   in the old days, it
was thought that freedom for the masses would only lead to social
chaos, and these fears were not unfounded. indeed, even today, many
free peoples only bring ruin and social mayhem in many parts of the
world.   but, in the europe of the 19th century, there was great deal
of social stability. and the people who demanded freedom the loudest
were the bourgeoisie who were educated and responsible. it was not
like the rabble and mobs calling for more freedom. it was the people
best suited to handle freedom in the most productive way.  as the
economy grew, production grew. it meant there was more opportunity for
more people--workers and farmers--to get an education and learn about
society. so, in time, even the masses became educated and rational
enough to handle freedom when they earned it. also, centuries of
christian influence had made the average european relatively
civilized, more cohesive, and less prone to mindless violence.

since the system was stable and secure, more and more people could be
free.   they had less reason to fear that if they didn't play their
fixed role in society, everything would crumble.  in a tyranny, if a
ruler doesn't rule with an iron-fist, the system falls apart and leads
to social chaos. and if the people don't know how to maintain social
control--if there is no system of order based on rule and justice--,
there is widespread mayhem and panic.   this is why the fall of the
castro regime may not be pretty. as there is no tradition or system of
rule of law in cuba, end of castro may not mean stable democracy and
sane freedom. it may mean streets ruled by armed gangs, thugs, and
lunatics--like much of russia after the fall of communism.
indeed, such is the problem even in black parts of the US.  blacks who
are generally less educated, wilder, and more prone to violence, don't
know how to use freedom sensibly. and, their leaders are often the
biggest, worst crooks and idiots.  you have thugs led by morons like
al sharpton and charles rangel.
indeed, it is the paradox of a stable democracy that an orderly and
disciplined people do it better than a wild, unruly, and rebellious
people.   we often associate freedom with anarchy, youth rebellion,
acting crazy, and such.  yet, such kind of freedoms lead to social
chaos and mayhem. in time, only a tyranny can bring order to the
social landscape. it's no wonder that woodstock nation lasted no more
than 3 yrs. one more day and it would have erupted in mass riots.  as
for altamont, it couldn't even maintain peace for a single day.

anyway, it should be obvious to all that freedom didn't come for free.
and freedom doesn't just thrive on freedom but on discipline, order,
appreciation, respect, and self-restraint.  someone who wants to be
totally free is megalomaniac, a little hitler.  hitler was a visionary
and adventurer who wanted to do everything his way. it was his way or
the highway.  indeed, one could say nazi german was a one-man
democracy.  the thing that distinguished hitler from most other
tyrants is hitler really wanted to be totally free--and reckless.
most tyrants are afraid to act and think freely, lest they bring
instability to their lands. they just wanna carefully guard what they
have.  but, the likes of hitler, che guevara, and saddam hussein--when
he invaded kuwait--aren't satisfied with mere power and privilege.
they want to own the world or remake mankind according to their
blueprint.  they are like rock n roll rebel tyrants.

such people are dangerous to freedom.  to be sure, many free people
freely support such madmen, and why?  it's because freedom often
causes anxiety.   many people with freedom still feel or remain poor,
confused, lost, anxious, and such.  they begin to see their freedom as
a curse than a blessing. they wanna surrender their freedom to a Great
Man who, having collected the surrendered freedoms of countless
millions, freely act to create a new world order, a utopia, a better
future that will redeem the nation or all of mankind(the psychology of
this mass mindset can be found in the New Testament where the ultimate
hope of christians is to abandon their individual bodies and have
their souls fly to heaven in rapture and be one with god).
germans who'd suffered the anxious freedom of the weimar yrs wanted to
hand their freedoms over to hitler; they were afraid to be free. they
felt unworthy to be free. freedom only mean confusion and social
chaos.
and same mentality exists among many 'progressives' in the western
world.  they were so impressed by marx's theories that they were
willing to give up their 'bourgeois' individualist freedoms for the
collective good.  even today, this is why so many leftists in the west
make apologies for castro and hugo chavez.
similarly, this is why so many russians admire putin.
now, not every dictator is a hitler nor necessarily dangerous to the
world. i doubt if putin is gonna start WWIII.  but, it's obvious that
freedom cannot work unless there is a stable and impartial system of
governance and rule of law.   also, rule of law requires more than the
existence of the law. you need a national character, culture, and
temperament that respects the rule of law.  in this sense, italians
are less well suited for democracy than the english.  italians tend to
be hot-tempered, wild, unruly, bickersome, clannish, and vendetta
driven.  this is why, even with democracy in italy the practice of
democracy is not ideal.
and, mexicans are unfit to practice democracy in a sound way because
of the national character of sheepishness, timidity, and gomez-ness.
there are also the mexican characters of sloppiness, fiesta and
siesta, mindless machismo, and such.  throughout its history, the
average mexican was afraid to stand tall like an anglo-american.  they
were too much like the poor farmers in 'viva zapata' or 'magnificent
seven'.  at times, mexicans rose up against the tyrants but never as
proud confident individuals. even the rebels were obedient followers
of new leaders who, once they attained power, were just as rotten as
the old rulers or so inept that they soon found out that the only way
to maintain order was to use brutal methods.  instead of a culture
where every person stood tall, it was a culture where the masses
stooped below some great leader.  even with the new leader or regime,
most mexicans just did alot of stooping.  in a culture of such
subservience and stoopery, the only free spirits were bandits and
such, but since when do bandits create a stable social order?
so, we see that national character and temperament play important
roles in the functioning of democracies.  it's not just a matter of
the democratic blueprint but whether the people will be suited to put
it into good use. and this is difficult for many backward peoples who
are either used to ruling with an iron fist or bowing down before 'the
iron fist'. in a democracy, the people need the confidence to stand up
for their rights--and enough sense to respect the law--, and the
leaders need to accept their limited role in a system where the law is
king.  so, for democracy to work, you need to first shape the national
character of a people. you need people who are moderate in their
disposition and emotions.  one of the problems of democracy in black
areas in the US is that the people are easily swayed by emotions,
easily jive-ass and self-righteous, and childish.  also, black leaders
use the populist and demagogic card than the let's-all-be-of-cool-mind-
and-hearts-card.  black leaders may be more 'charismatic' but they are
also more childish and mindless.

imagine the following hypothesis.  suppose we come upon the swedes
prior to them knowing anything about democracy. and suppose we come
upon some african tribe also without knowledge of democracy. and
suppose we come upon a peruvian peasants of indian descent also
without knowledge of democracy.  now, all three groups know nothing of
democracy, and all three have distinct social charateristics and
'national characters'--even racial personality may play a role.   now,
which group would be most likely to make democracy work and which
least?    my guess is swedes first, peruvian peasants second, and
african tribalists third.
swedes are orderly and disciplined yet not slavish and submissive.
they are upright people but not too proud.   peruvian peasants would
be too slavish, timid, and such to stand up as individuals in a
democratic system.  as for african tribalists, they would be proud,
too jiveass, too jungle-boogie to sit down and make democracy work.
indeed, even among democracies, some work better than others. the best
is the american because there is the balance between rule of law and
cowboy individual spirit.   european democracy is stable and works
well, but there are still too many vestiges of european
authoritarianism in it--too many anti-free-speech laws that would
shock americans, too much government interference--to the point where
the state is the new religion among europeans.
as for the japanese, it's been a defacto one-party dictatorship since
WWII.  change and reform in japan have come slowly, often thru
external or international pressure. this isn't due to lack of
democracy in japan but deficiency of the democratic spirit in the
japanese national character.  too many jappers are afraid to speak
their minds or stand up to injustice, for reform, for free
expression.
japanese women have the freedom to gain greater power but as the
prevailing social more for women is to stay quiet and go along--which
most japanese women eagerly accept--, japanese women have fewer rights
and less power than women in the west.
there is nothing in the japanese constitution that says japan should
be less democratic than US or UK.  japan is simply less democratic
because its national character is less democratic.
indeed, due to japanese national character, democracy could not have
originated in japan on its own.

anyway, freedom--sustainable freedom guaranteed by law and social
institutions--came gradually thru history.  it took countless
philosphers and thinkers to argue about its possibilities and
details.  it took countless social experiments and enterprises--most
of which failed.  it took countless mistakes to come upon a right
formula which needed a 1000 other right formulas. it took wars,
revolts, repression, liberation, and so on and on.  throughout
history, most revolts and liberations soon led to another cycle of
oppression.  as The Who song said, 'meet the new boss, same as the old
boss'.   it was only relatively recently that man finally came upon a
system of political and social freedom that could sustain itself,
develop, prosper, and grow.  a system that paradoxically allowed
freedom but also maintained stability.  traditionally, all evidence
showed that freedom meant social dissolution. not that tyranny was any
better since it led to social stagnation.
so, freedom that we have is the product of all that man had done
wrong--and learned from mistakes--and all that man had done right--and
remembered the lessons.
then, it is distressing that so many among us today take freedom for
granted, see freedom as something that is as natural as the air we
breathe.

we are not born free in a nation like the US.  we are born safe.  safe
from wild animals and social violence--at least, most of us.   as
babies, we don't know what freedom is. we only care for milk and
warmth.  as we grow older, we come to recognize freedom and see its
value.  but, this is only because we live in a stable environment
where freedom can flourish. and freedom can flourish only if we
respect the freedoms of others and understand the limits of freedom as
defined by the law.
but, many of us are not made to appreciate anything. not the food, not
the housing, not the clothing that keep us safe and warm.  we take
them for granted too. and, when we become old enough to be free, we
think  freedom is about serving one's selfish interests and pleasure.
kids see their parents, society, government, businesses, etc. in this
way.  everything exists to satisfy the hedonistic freedom of youths.
as this is so fun, many people never emotionally mature into
adulthood.   all their lives, they look back upon their edenic youth
when they felt like the center of the world--materially, socially, and
morally.  this mentality especially took off in the 60s among the
boomers.  there was much good things about the 60s but there was such
vanity, self-importance, narcissism, self-interest, etc.   60s
generation is often called idealistic as opposed to materialistic, but
this very idealism was little more than materialism.  they were the
first generation to really take it easy, put off the future, not have
to worry about jobs, and so on. they could lie around, smoke pot,
listen to beatles, and dream of a 'better world'. some idealism. like
when lennon composed 'imagine' in his multi million dollar mansion.
how idealistic of him to dream of no possessions--he had plenty.

we need to think of the forces that threaten freedom today.  by
freedom, i mean modern freedom of stable advanced democracies, not the
freedom of armed gangs in nigeria or freedom of lunatic terrorists in
the middle east.

1. one of the threat to freedom is the violation of freedom itself.
we see this thru the rise of political correcntess, which in the name
of 'justice' and 'progress', forbid certain expressions. now, it's
natural for society to censure and frown upon certain ideas and views,
but when certain views are banned by the law it is a violation of
freedom. david irving is a loathsome figure but there is no reason why
he should be put behind bars for having a rotten opinion.
also, when brigit bardot was fined by french court for a book she
wrote about muslims, such action violated all democratic principles.
if there are ideas that are wrong or evil, then good people should
oppose or criticize openly, in the public sphere. to silence people
for having wrong ideas is dangerous to democracy.  to be sure, such
may be justified in a time of emergency when society seems to be
falling apart or when radicals or extremists or some unruly mob
threatens the existence of the state.  otherwise, there is no
justification for such actions. also, such actions set a bad
precedence for future generations.  it means dissenting voices may be
silenced for 'correct' policies.

2. there is also the freedom without limits.  the most obvious case is
criminality and street violence and such.  there is also hedonism of
wild sex and drug use. some of these actions are illegal, some are
not.   generally, freedom of expression isn't illegal but freedom of
violent acts. if someone expresses some rotten or dangerous ideas or
viewpoint, he's dangerously practicing freedom without limits but
still within the law. but, if someone commits acts of terrible
violence, uses certain drugs, or destroys property, he's practicing
freedom without limits.
now, certain acts of limitless freedom should be against the law.
democracy is not about total freedom to do as one pleases. but,
expression of limitless freedom shouldn't be against the law.  howard
stern should be free to say whatever he wishes.

what's really disturbing is the cultural attitude that freedom without
limits is cool, hip, desirable, or even respectful.   ugly rap culture
has entered the mainstream.  new yorker magazine seriously reviews the
music of R. Kelly.    thug morons like 50 cents are treated as
cultural icons. there is a connection between rap culture and actual
gangster culture, and this relationship is romanticized.
people like rudy giuliani have feted disgusting jerks like howard
stern. much of american comedy is a cesspool of filth and rot.
illegal 'immigrants' are treated as legal citizens, meaning that
american laws mean nothing.
when illegal 'immigrants' demand protection under american law when
they have violated american laws to enter illegally into the US, one
wonders about our concept of freedom.  it's not freedom within the law
but freedom outside the law that gets more respect.

our society will always be imperfect, and there will always be people
who break the rules. but, do we, as a people, have to romanticize and
idealize and idolize these law breakers?
to be sure, this problem with freedom is linked to another problem of
modern freedom.  it's because americans take freedom for granted and
don't appreciate it properly that they crave after more and more
outlandish forms of freedom.   as americans are satiated with law-n-
order freedom, they are excited--at least vicariously--with outlaw or
immoral freedom.  so, it makes sense that Sopranos would be the top tv
show for many yrs running. or why 'desperate housewives' would be such
a hit.  or, why so many well-bred white suburban kids would be into
gangsta rap.  all these people are bored with freedom with rules and
responsibility.  they also feel 'oppressed' by it since it means
working 9 to 5, being faithful to spouse, obeying traffic signals,
etc.  how fun to fantasize sleeping with anyone, shooting many people,
going 120 mph in a car. etc.    now, what is the problem if tv shows
and videogames serve as therapeutic outlets for such frustrations?
for one thing, it's childish and, as such, rather sad and pathetic
that mankind has come this far to indulge in such idiocy.
but, more importantly, such realities don't just happen in the bubble
world of movie fantasy or video game or music video.  there is a
growing social problem with crime, gangsterism, sexual disease, drug
use, failed schools, broken families, etc, etc.   what happens in
Sopranos is not mere fiction that's fun for everyone.  such things
really happen.  and there are real consequences to infidelity. and
there is a real face to ugly gangsterism and drug use, and it's not
glamorous as in the movies or pop music.
and, this ugly reality is growing bigger and bigger, not least because
the highest birthrates in the US happen among poor and/or criminal
negroes and troublesome illegals.

since the mainstream white society also indulges in such mindless fun
and irresponsibility--and since the liberal jews who run most of the
media and academia are only interested in making money off such lunacy
and in maintaining friendly ties with negroes and hispanics-- there is
no basic social model for responsible behavior in the US anymore.
even to speak of the importance of the family unit is deemed offensive
by many 'progressive' because it's 'patriarchal', 'anti-women', and
'homophobic'.   indeed, 'gay marriage' is more important to liberals
than marriage itself.  it wouldn't bother most liberals if divorce
rates climbed to 90% or if most kids were born out of wedlock, but
there is NOTHING more urgent to liberals  than the rights of gays to
be married.

outlaws, gangs, criminals, louts, and jerks will practice freedom
without limits. certain practices are illegal--selling drugs or
forming armed gangs--and certain are legal--farting in public, acting
ugly and vulgar.  and there will always be such people in whatever
kind of society.  but, do we have to celebrate this to the extent that
we do?  and why do we?
is it because US is a big country and most of us can move to safe
neighborhoods and can pretend that the social problems--consequences
of limitless freedom--don't exist?  indeed, notice how many many
whites took flight from the city or darker areas and settled in mostly
safe and white areas.  feeling safe and secure, they seem to think
that freedom is something that will be there. yet, if you see these
social problems up close, you see that freedom cannot be taken for
granted and one of its greatest enemy is limitless freedom.
indeed, NYers prided themselves on their liberal idea of limitless
freedom. but what happened to NY in the 70s and 80s? things got so bad
that they elected Big Bad Rudy to fix things up.
if the white middle class are callous about limitless freedom and
blind to its consequences, we may ask why so many white trash, black
underclass, and hispanic americans who see ugly reality up close
indulge in it so much?  surely, a black guy living in the inner city
has witnessed the lunacy of limitless freedom and its consequences--
violence, death, brutality, prison, etc.   why don't they realize the
moral deadend of this lifestyle and attitude?
it's because they were born into it and grew into it.  they don't know
of any other reality. this is especially true when the white or black
middle class no longer stands for anything positive or as a role model
for rest of society. indeed, most of our mainstream culture is not
defined by middle class values but by thuggish black attitudes and
smarmy jewish cynicism.
when a negro turns on the tv, he sees wild triumphant and thuggish
black athletes, movie stars, and music stars.  and even white folks
seem to bow down to the black masters of badassedness. even white
suburban boys listen to rap, jiveass music, and worship black athletes
who are often idiotic, savage, and thuggish.  also, liberal jewish
dominated media generally present blackness as the fountain of all
wisdom, nobility, and such. even a crooked black reverend is treated
as a prophet.  blacks are put upon the pedestal like no other.
muhammad ali was made into the hero of our age when his only talent
was for beating up people and bragging about it.  in this cultural
climate, blacks feel there is little to learn from whites who
themselves seem only to bow down to black beauty, black nobility,
black greatness. and black wonderfulness is no longer associated with
only good blacks but bad blacks.  in our wish to dispel the offensive
uncle tom stereotype forever, we often go out of our way to embrace
some uppity cocky arrogant black thug.  it's fashionable to prefer the
'threatening negro' over the 'non-threatening'.  a white guy who
prefers the 'non-threatening negro' is said to be subconsciously
'racist', someone who perpetuates the uncle tom stereotype.  only by
accepting the 'threatening negro' can white man truly and finally
accept the negro as he really is--a thug?

we wonder, is there a way to bring the masses of negroes out of their
thuggish gangsta paradise or are they stuck there forever? and will
this gangsta paradise grow wider and wider, both demographically due
to high birth rates and culturally thru dissemination via the media?
already, we have so many white kids who sing, dance, and act like thug
negroes in middle class neighborhoods. these kids are not into
blackness represented by the likes of colin powell. they are into
blackness as thuggery, jivery, and freedom-without-limits.

3. another threat to democratic freedom is the radical challenge.
often, radicalism is disguised as true freedom opposed to compromised
bourgeois freedom.  radicals will say that our freedom is really
illusory and dominated by corporations and such.  now, who would doubt
that corporations are very powerful--especially liberal jewish owned
media outlets and movie/tv/music industry?    since some people have
more power than others, it must mean they have more freedom than
others.  and, it must mean that people with power use us like sheep.
so, the people should be courageous to think new, bold, and dissenting
thoughts.  we shouldn't be apathetic and mind-controlled.    this is
all well and good.  but, radicals go an extra step and say they
represent True Freedom.
now, since radicals start out small and challenge the status quo, many
of us are likely to see radicals as uncompromised free thinkers and
freedom fighters. since radicals are often at the fringes of society,
we mainly see them as harmless--at least those on the left as those on
the right have been vilified mercilessly by the liberal jewish run
media(if far leftists hold a rally, the national media will dote on it
as what freedom and the spirit of dissent is all about.  but, if far
rightists hold a rally, the national media will denounce it and say
america has a long way to go before we no longer have any more of such
'hatred'.    class or anti-american hatred is okay, race hatred is
not).

but, radicals are inherently dangerous to democracy even though,
during stable times, radicals must be given the freedom to express
their views.  for radicals, 'justice' or a 'vision of society' is more
important than freedom.   if freedom stands in the way of 'justice' or
'vision of society', freedom must step aside or go entirely.  radicals
have a very rigid idea of justice based on dogmatic theory such as
marxism. or they have rigid vision of society such as held by the
nazis.  either in the name of 'fairness' or 'beauty', their ideal take
precedence over freedom.  democratic freedom means every individual or
group has the freedom to think, exercise, or champion his or its own
ideas while respecting the rights of others. radicals believe in their
own power but have no respect for the rights of others. since their
idea or vision is the ONLY right idea or vision, why should those with
other ideas or visions have any rights or freedom?

certain forms of radicalism may threaten a free people from the
outside.  consider when democratic france had to fight nazi germany.
but, sometimes, much of the radical threat comes from inside.
democracy can be alienating, anxiety ridden, and troublesome--
especially if there is too much limitless freedom and dysfunctionalism
due to deficiency of national character, corruption, hypocrisy, or
sudden economic downturn.  for these reasons, many people are drawn to
radical or extreme ideas or agendas. most radicals adopt such agendas
to do away with democracy for good while some anti-radicals adopt
extreme measures in the name of saving democracy or at least the
status quo of pluralism in the long run.
for example, many in chile supported pinochet because they thought
pinochet would save democracy in the long run from the marxist
allende.  this kind of allegiance is extreme but not radical.  indeed,
it may be called emergency anti-radicalism. but, some people really do
wish for a totally new order.   when nazis invaded france, not all
frenchmen were upset. some saw it as an opportunity to get rid of what
they deemed as more dangerous radicals--communists.  and some hoped
that it would lead to a new european order where germany and france
would be united and stronger.
anyway, the point is many people in democracies are not necessarily
committed to democracy. some want to use democratic freedoms to fight
for a radical order.  many jewish leftists did just that in the US.
there are also people who want democracy for themselves and for their
own nation but feel that a radical or extreme form of government will
be better for another nation.   most liberal and leftist jews in the
US would not want to live under castro but believe that castro's rule
have been good for cubans as a whole since democracy wouldn't work in
cuba anyway.  in the late 60s and early 70s, many american liberals
who appreciated american democracy and freedoms, nevertheless, had
nothing but praise for maoist china.  since chinese were so poor and
backward, it was thought that they needed an iron hand and the iron
rice bowl.   and among the right, there weer many americans who
thought guys like pinochet would be good, at least for the short run
since the alternative was marxist tyranny.

generally, extremism is less dangerous than radicalism in the long run
for a democracy.  extremists like pinochet or franco tend not to be
thinkers. they are emergency operators who grab dictatorial power in
order to maintain stability so as to develop the economy.  they have
no burning vision--like hitler--or some 'shining ideal'--like
communists.    they are about tactics, not some grand strategy.
radicals, on the other hand, have a full blueprint for a new society.
they cannot be deposed until the entire process plays out--as when
iron curtain nations rotted to the core--or unless they are brought
down by external forces--like nazis defeated by the allies.
the goal of radicals is to remake society and to hold power forever.

4. another obvious danger to freedom is enforced monoculturalism, a
problem in many parts of the world.  for example, turks have been
repressive of kurds, indonesians have been repressive of chinese, and
so on.   this is a matter of intolerance, but not always. sometimes,
the ruling culture fears that the minority cultures will refuse to
assimilate and cause social problems.

5. and, this brings us to the problem of tribal multiculturalism. the
danger of this form of multiculturalism is that it gives the freedom
to minority groups who don't want to assimiliate or to play by the
rules of democracy. as a result, certain hostile minorities use the
freedom and tolerance allowed by the majority in order to maintain a
repressive system within their minority community.  we see this
problem especially in europe.  multiculturalism in european nations
has been a one-way affair, not a mutualist agreement.  it's been about
whites tolerating and respecting non-whites but not vice versa. many
muslims in europe demand their right to be muslims but don't have any
respect for the majority culture. also, these people would never
support the right of christians to be freely christian in muslim
dominated countries.
this goes to show that one-sided tolerance is stupid and misguided.
one can only deal 'fairly' and 'rationally' with people who are fair
and rational.  it's like a game. you can't play by the rules if the
other side doesn't.    it's like the french-algerian soccer game where
the french-algerian spectators stormed the field when it seemed as
though france was gonna beat algeria.  french spectators had been
watching the event in good faith and in the spirit of fairness.  win
or lose, what mattered most was the rules of the game. the french-
algerian spectators, on the other hand, could only tolerate their side
winning.
also, consider how stupid it was for neville chamberlain to trust
hitler.

the problem of tribal multiculturalism is that under the protection of
the laws of the white majority, many non-white minorites set up
communities that do not respect the rights of individuals or the
concept of freedom.  many areas in france and UK are like parts of
muslim nations where women are not allowed any freedom and where young
people are raised to be hate-filled radicals.  this is a threat to
freedom.

but, this threat to freedom is linked with other threats to freedom.
first, one of the reasons why many muslims or non-white tribalists
reject western values is because the latter has grown decadent,
savage, and crazy.   indeed, is it better for a muslim child to
abandon his islamic values and take on rap culture values?   consider
that many children of muslim immigrants in france are no longer muslim
nor interested in islam but just as problematic socially. most of the
rioters and car-burners and stone throwers in the french riots were
not islamic youths but post-islamic youths.  these kids, though their
backgrounds were mostly islamic, had fully adopted american gangsta
rap culture.  they were into street violence, drug dealing and drug
use, gangsterism, macho thuggery, and so on.   much of western culture
isn't all that western(how many white kids in the US listen to
classical music or know much about western high culture?). it's afro-
savage, with the main emphasis being on ass-shaking, talking trash,
clucking necks, acting pimpish and thuggish or acting like a ho.   is
this what passes for becoming 'westernized' today? in this light,
there is some validity in dinesh d'souza's recent literary rant.
'western culture' has become essentially a cesspool of afro-savagery
and jewish nastiness.  it's flavor flav using women like toilet tissue
on his shows, and it's liberal jewish-run tv shows and movies which
delight in mindless cynicism, disrespect, and infantilism.
and, as exciting as modernism was in the art, it was not the sort of
stuff that did much to promote a sense of values and community;
indeed, modernism's main agenda was to undermine, subvert, and
challenge everything traditional, square, mainstream,
bourgeois(despite it being funded by the bourgeoisie), etc, etc.
modernism was essentially decadent outgrowth of bourgeois society.
people who made too much money, read too radical books, and had too
much comfort simply needed new thrills in terms of destruction and
innovation.   much of it was valuable and of great artistic and
intellectual worth, much of it was caca. but, for the average joe,
modernism meant little in terms of how to feed and raise a family,
what values to live by, and so on.   the rich bourgeoisie and the
bohemian folks had the financial means and/or the freedom--as the
latter forsook responsibilities such as family--to live outside normal
morality and burdens.  as such, they could indulge in freedom in all
its glory and madness. but, for most people, living was a matter of
working, buying a house, raising a family, paying tuition for kids,
and so on.  for such people, neither modernism--which is essentially
alienating and full of question marks with no answers--nor recent pop
culture-ism dominated by afro-savagery and jew-snidery-and-nastiness
offered or offers much in the way of lending meaning to life.  one may
say afro-savagery and jewish-snidery are fun, and they are. but, ass-
shaking/groin pumping or  venomous wit/sneering mockery doesn't do
much for the human soul.  as for modernism, one can defend it on the
grounds that it's great  to question everything and think new thoughts
and come up with new idea. true enough, but most people are not
inclined to be intellectualish or original or such.   europeans may
pride themselves on being more intellectual or cultural than
americans, but are they really?  european conceit of being more
liberated and more free is founded on a largely socialist model; they
are all taken care of by the nanny state. for all their yammering
about individualism, state is sacrosanct in europe; it is their
religion.   european freedom is founded on dependence on the state.
so much for bohemian courage and freedom! as for european
intellectualism, it's mostly a matter of few big name intellectuals
which the masses of wanna-be intellectuals sheepishly admire and try
to imitate.  european intellectualism rarely has meant free thought by
the ordinary person. it has meant the ordinary person slavishly
reading stuff by the likes of sartre, foucault, derrida, wittgenstein,
and etc and then spouting them in cafes.   paradoxically, the greater
intellectual orientation of europeans have, in some ways, made them
less free and independent than americans.  americans, less burdened by
intellectual ideas, are more common-sensical and self-reliant.
europeans may be better read but they are mental slaves of their
intellectual masters.  i heard that french girls fainted at a lecture
by sartre. sartre's ideas were to french girls what elvis's songs were
to american girls.
in any case, neither european intellectualism of modernist(or post-
modernist)school nor the american sensualism of the afro-savage kind
does much for the human soul nor for social values.  it's funny, but
as opposites european style intellectualism and american afro-savage
sensualism seem to serve one another in the recent politics of the
united states--think of the socio-political philosophy of michael
moore.   if masses fall under the sway of afro-savage sensualism, they
are likely to be less responsible as individuals and more dependent on
the state, which is just fine for intellectual types because they
favor state control over our lives.
in this sense, both modern intellectualism and afro-savage sensualism
are enemies of democratic freedom, which is necessarily primarily
founded upon individual freedom and acceptance of individual
responsibility.  as more and more kids grow under afro-savage
sensualism, they practice freedom without limits and without
responsibility.  they are likely to mess up their lives and those of
others.  in this growing chaos, we need the state to step in to a
greater degree to clean up the mess, take care of people who've messed
up their lives, and to protect us from crime.
indeed, we take it for granted that public school system is supposed
to fail for many kids. our attitude is that since kids should be kids,
why should they study? why not act jungle-boogie-ish and skip school
and use dope and have fun?  but, once you're an adult, what are you
qualified for? nothing! that's why and when the state should pay for
'continued education' and 'further education' and so on and on.  it's
almost a given in the black community that the kids in highschools
will almost all do poorly. they are expected to drop out or just
barely make the grade.  it's not their responsibility to study or
think of the future.  they are not to be held accountable. they are to
just have fun, fun, fun.  and when they finally have to find a job,
then what?   never mind that they wasted all their time and tax
payers' money in school.   it's the function of the government--thru
more of our tax dollars--to teach these adults with no-skills the
skills to find jobs. of course in many cases, they can't even take
such opportunities seriously. are they to be blamed? no.  no one is to
be blamed for having fun, fun, fun, and messing up their lives and
future.  if they mess up, it's the job of the government--thru our tax
dollars--to keep cleaning up the mess, fixing the damage.

tribal multiculturalism--and its threat to freedom--is also strangely
allied with radical leftism. even as radical leftists despise many
cultures around the world as being 'reactionary', 'feudalistic',
'patriarchal', and such, they also believe that the 'people of color'
have been and still are being oppressed and exploited by the neo-
imperialist global capitalist order. so, to the extent that tribal
multiculturalism is wreaking havoc in western capitalist societies,
radical leftists welcome it as the first step toward social chaos
which may lead to revolution or at least radical restructuring of
society and world economic order.
when radical leftists welcome illegals from mexico, it's not out of
love of mexican culture which most leftists deem as ignorant,
pigheaded, corrupt, stupid, backward, macho, patriarchal, anti-
feminist, and such.  it's in the hope that the 'wretched of the earth'
will shake the center of world capitalist-imperialism--USA--from
within.  according to leftist radicalism, many people are mired in
poverty, backwardness, and ignorance mainly because of the globalist
capitalist system dominated by the USA.   having more illegals or non-
white immigrants in the US means less power for white imperialists.
also, having been uprooted from their native cultural soil, the hope
is that the masses of non-white immigrants in the US will feel
alienated and in need of some unifying ideology... such as che guevara-
ism.
coming to the US will radicalize the masses of the world. first, by
removing them from their native soil of reactionary patriarchal
values. second, by being surrounded by modernity and urban alienation
which will push people for radical-political solutions.
of course, leftists fear that the new arrivals will, instead of
looking to leftism for answers, look for answers in neo-traditionalism
or even evangelical christianism of conservative america. indeed, many
hispanic americans have turned to evangelical protestantism to find
meaning  in their lives.  of these two rightwing options, leftist
radicals prefer that new arrivals maintain their native traditionalism
than opt for american conservative spiritualism. the latter--
evangelical christianism--will turn new arrivals into mainstream
political conservatives; the former, as ugly and reactionary as it may
be, pits the new arrivals against the american conservatives.  for
example, suppose there are a million chinese arrivals in the US.
leftists' main hope is that these chinese will turn to leftism.  but,
suppose most of them either opt for evangelical christianism or stick
to traditional chinese-ism.  now, why would the radical left--
dominated by jews--prefer that these people stick to chinese-ism than
adopt christian evangelicalism when chinese-ism is clearly more
reactionary, more conservative, more backward than any christian
ideology?   it's because leftists see the christian right as the main
enemy standing in their way to power.  in terms of values and
ideology, chinese-ism may be more offensive to radical leftists, but
as chinese-ism is, as yet, weak in the US leftists would prefer to use
chinese grievances against christian america than have chinese-ists go
over to or side with christian america. radical jews pride themselves
on sticking up for the little guy but this mostly bogus, merely a
means to subvert every power or nation that they don't like by using
proxies.  for example, there is some support among the jewish left for
muslims in the US but this is not due to any love for muslims but due
to sheer leftwing jewish hate for christian america.   leftwing jews
are merely using muslims against the US.  leftwing jews play this game
mostly in capitalist nations.  indeed, the only nations that are
exempt from this radical jewish gamesmanship are leftist nations.
radical leftist jews voiced very little support for all the oppressed
and mass-murdered minority groups in the soviet union or in communist
china.  when leftism finally prevails over a nation, then leftist jews
are mostly mum about the rights of minorities.  under the rule of
leftism, the idea is that all reactionary minorities must be forced to
adopt marxism.  indeed, remember how katha pollitt used to make
apologies for the communist regime in afghanistan.  when communists
ruthlessly and murderously suppress minorities and minority rights,
leftwing jews are mostly silent.  but, if we are dealing with a
capitalist or anti-communist regime, leftwing jews go on and on about
supporting and defending the little guy or the poor minority from big
bad majority or evil government.  to leftwing jews, american
interrogation of muslim suspects in a more grievous crime than soviet
murder of millions in the muslim parts of the empire.

anyway, to sum it up, freedom isn't for free. and for it to be sane,
sustainable, and functional, it can't be limitless. nor can we hand
over much of our freedom to the state.  abandoning much of our
economic and political freedom to the state in exchange for being
taken care of is not freedom. but, that's where we may be heading.
again, afro-savagery and jewish-snidery are related to this.  we grow
up believing in limitless freedom. we wanna be mindless consumers of
every worthless frivolous junk that makes us feel good, feel
orgasmic.  we are all like junkies or addicts.  we want fun, fun, fun,
thrill, thrill, thrill.  we don't wanna plan, we don't wanna save.
indeed, who saves anymore?  since we've become so irresponsible and
hedonistic, we don't trust ourselves anymore. so, we'd prefer that the
state tax us more and give us more services--we prefer the state save
us from ourselves whom we don't trust anymore; it's like a fat person
who can't control his eating hiring someone to control what he eats.
since we can't trust ourselves to be responsible or save, we have come
to substitute taxation for saving(this problem has gotten more serious
with the fading of the culture of shame. there is no more shame in
declaring bankruptcy, for instance).  since we can't save ourselves,
we might as well have the state 'save and spend' for us.  by taxing
us, the state withholds some of our income. and when we need basic
services and goods, the state will take care of us.   it made sense
with social security for the retired because old people cannot work
anymore. but, when young healthy people think this way, something is
wrong.  in this sense, milton friedman was wrong.  people are not
necessarily rational consumers, especially when our culture has become
so anti-family, anti-responsibility, anti-restraint, anti-self-
control.  our culture is addictive, orgasmic, and mindless(also, with
the welfare state, we know that no matter how we mess up, government
will take care of us so we don't fear consequences of irreponsibility
as much people of the past; government has made us less rational, less
fearful of wrong actions).     now, fun is good, but there is a time
and place for fun.  fun shouldn't be the core meaning of our lives.
the deepest meaning of people's lives come thru family, individual
responsibility, pride of work and accomplishment, etc.  but, those are
laborious and also mean obligations.
the popular culture that has such powerful control over us makes all
of us want to live and think like NBA athletes, paris hilton, rock
stars, tv celebrities, etc.   even the idea of having a career is
purely self-serving.  according to this concept of careerism, family
is always secondary.  we are told that career is important cuz it's
about power, money, showing off, being glamorous. it's narcissistic.
the kind of independence peddled by popular culture is nihlistic and
self-centered.  the message is be rich like oprah. of course, there is
an easy way to assuage your guilt about having so much money or
power.  just vote democratic--which means you care for the people--and
make donations to leftist causes. this way, you can be like hollywood
billionaries. live like pigs, be greedy and narcissistic AND pretend
that you're a social saint.
yes, you can have the cake and eat it too.
