happened, I speculate, when the cost of a new radio/TV was 1/10th of the
cost of repairing the old one, coupled with use of VLSI and micro machining
that put most repairs beyond the reach of all but industrial labs.  Just try
and repair a modern TV or PC with BGA packages and unavailable VLSI that was
produced only for 6 months - and when a new device is $200, how much labor
can you put into fixing an old one?

Also, you could call anywhere in the world and be connected in seconds for
peanuts. All the airlines ran on time, and flights were much cheaper than

might cost $100-, in 1970 they only cost $14-, which is less even adjusted

I'm sorry. I fail to see your point . . . Do you think all those big
tube testers were taking up all that valuable retail space because they
didn't sell tubes? Buying a $5 tube to fix the radio yourself sure beat
buying a new radio for $50.

I don't think anyone denies that the tube testers sold tubes.

But I think there is a judgement that in putting it into the hands
of a novice, many tubes were sold that didn't need replacing.  Vague
indicators, or someone not setting things right.  The tube testers
weren't there unless the place sold tubes, I gather.  So Joe Handy
would routinely test tubes, just because it could be done, and likely
buy replacements for &quot;marginal&quot; tubes that werne't really in need of
replacement.  Or they'd replace tubes because they could, only
to discover that the tubes weren't the problem, so they'd have
to send the set off (or have the repairman visit), and have the cost
of replacement tubes on top of the repair bill.

They were rigged to make okay tubes read &quot;REPLACE&quot; and tested only emission
which almost never makes a difference in how the set operates. Their SOLE
purpose was indeed to SELL tubes. Once in awhile they did indeed catch a
tube with an open filament and thereby a radio was fixed, but bad tubes are
and were very rarely the reason why an radio doesn't work.

Drugstore tube testers are certainly one thing that made the old days bad.

Mine, too. He *did* find a use for that big honkin' soldering iron he
had in the drawer, though.

He was incensed when he found out that he could buy a whole new cordless
drill w/battery pack for the same cost of a replacement battery pack for
it. Now he rebuilds all his old battery packs by using the big soldering
iron to &quot;weld&quot; the batteries together. Just a second or two is all it takes.

The Apex brand of electronics, TV, VCR, DVD- I think they're gone now-
had a warranty policy of replace, don't fix. No need for service info
if waranty fulfillment meant give 'em another. Most consumer
electronics these days are throw-away. Whether in six months or 2
years. I picked up a Harman Kardon AVR35 surround receiver at a yard
sale yesterday for $10. Seller said the volume wouldn't hold steady.
This unit retailed for around $500 in 1999. I haven't seen the problem
yet. Hard to believe HK would attach its name to an item made in
China. However, it did have a 2 year warranty.

but you needed to repair your radio or TV yearly if not more often - so one
might say the products were repairable because their reliabiilty was so
poor - I have old cars (see my web site), and plenty of old other stuff -
I'd never expect my 51 dodge to go 250,000 miles without an engine overhaul,
but every modern car will easily do that if you only change the oil
occasionally - I don't expect my computer monitor to break yearly (in fact
I've actually never had one of MY monitors break, though I have seen others
fail), and in general electronics becomes obsolete long before failure - in
fact the pace of obsolescence is a problem for any system with a long life
now, it was never a concern in 1921

But - don't forget - there were books, booklets and maybe I think - some
sort of reference card - anyone could buy - which alluded to fixing tv
sets - based &quot;solely&quot; on which tubes to suspect given a particular audio or
video issue. They didn't cover anything regarding resistors, caps, etc...
&quot;JUST TUBES&quot;. So - &quot;Joe Handy&quot; with one of those guides in hand - felt
almost like a true TV Tech - until he got in over his head.

Why don't you find out? Next time an expensive tube tester says a tube
is good, try it on your drugstore model and see if it says the tube
needs replacing. While I have no doubt that the $1,000 tester is more
accurate, I wonder if they were as bad as some people insisted they were.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's what I like about old radios, there's not much you can't repair
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on them. Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt; Back in the olden days, there was a &quot;tube tester&quot; in every drug store.
&gt;&gt;&gt; People would peek inside, see a dark tube, test it and replace it if it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was bad. That's all it took for 95% of the radio repairs.

&gt; Why don't you find out? Next time an expensive tube tester says a tube is
&gt; good, try it on your drugstore model and see if it says the tube needs
&gt; replacing. While I have no doubt that the $1,000 tester is more accurate,
&gt; I wonder if they were as bad as some people insisted they were.

Dog gone it - Vey stole my thunder :). I was going to suggest - since you do
happen to have one of those &quot;Drug Store&quot; Tube Testers, you're in a position
to examine it and compare notes. Letting us know for sure how close or far
off they were from being accurate - OR - &quot;rigged&quot; to make all tubes test
bad. I would be interested in hearing those results.

I've used those things myself - but damned, I can't recall what ratio of
times the tubes may have tested bad or good - or which bad ones I replaced
and actually got a unit working.

Okay, so drug store testers don't measure mutual transconductance. But most
tubes with low emission are &quot;bad&quot; and need to be replaced.

Lets see:

Most of them only stocked one or two each of the 100 most popular
tubes in the base of the cabinet. The U-Test-Um outfit where I lived
restocked them every two weeks.

Lots of blown filaments from people shoving a tube into the socket
before they did the setup.

Bad sockets that gave erratic readings, or no reading at all because
the filament pins were shot.

They charged two or three times the price of the TV shops, who
generally sold at MSRP.

Radios and TVs damaged by people putting the tubes back into the
wrong sockets.

Broken sockets, or tube pins from forcing a tube into a socket.

The 95% success figure came from the people selling the tubes, and
phony guidebooks.

OTOH, we had one that dd an excellent job at one of our shops. We
ripped out the original tube tester panel and replaced it with a B&amp;K.

Those tube testers were the greatest deal for anyone who wanted to sell
tubes.  Mr. Joe Blow would turn on his radio one day, only to find it didn't
work.  Of course in an effort to save money, he certainly wouldn't call the
serviceman -- no sir-ree!  He would pull out all the tubes, tote them down
to the local drug store or 7-Eleven, and check them out.  Invariably at
least one would test weak -- or if a real expert, he might set the filament
wrong and blow the previously good tube.  But whatever, he would gladly buy
whatever new tubes he needed.  Take them back home, only to find the radio
still doesn't work.

First off, weak tubes rarely caused a radio to fail.  Second off, those
testers were deliberately biased so as to make a marginal tube test weak.

In the case of TV sets, tubes indeed were a larger factor in set failures,
but you could still consider yourself lucky if you actually fixed the set by
replacing a tube from the drugstore.

Tubes did indeed fail, but so did capacitors, resistors, switches, and even
transistors.  Over the years components have gotten more reliable.  One
modern IC may contain the same number of components as an entire collection
of old radios, and often the only cause of failure is a static zap.  The
computer you're reading this on contains more electronics than the folks 50
years ago could have dreamed of, and chances are you will replace it
someday -- not because of failure, but because newer ones are more powerful
and have more features.  Yes, repair shops are becoming obsolete, but the
main reason is because they are no longer needed.

To carry this a tad further, consider my own business -- vintage car radios.
People have old cars whose radios don't work.  They send them to me for
rebuild.  For starters, I'm one in a million -- nobody else offers this
service.  Then, even if the original paper caps, electrolytics, and
vibrators test good (which they won't), it would be irresponsible for me NOT
to replace them anyway.  Why?  Paper caps failed back then.  Vibrators,
according to original service manuals, had an EXPECTED life of about 18
months.  If a 1950 car radio failed in 1952, it was considered normal.  But
if I rebuild a radio and it fails two years from now, I'll have a mad
customer on my hands.  Yes, we service radios today so that they're BETTER
than new, with better, more reliable components.  As for conversions, I've
been doing these for about 10 years.  How often does a customer call me to
fix a CONVERSION?  Oh, I've had two or three.  In one case, another dealer
did a very sloppy job and the problem was a solder blob in the wrong place.
In another, the fellow has a shorted speaker wire and fried the amp.  Last
week someone called me to ask about a conversion someone else did several
years ago -- problem sounds like an on-off switch.

Plain and simple, times change.

When I was 10, I decided to check out the insides of our brand new Juliette
table radio. It was so shiny and bright inside. I took out all the tubes and
examined them, then placed them back in the radio (in the wrong sockets).
IIRC, the 12BE6 and 12BA6 were reversed, and it burned out a resistor. My
step-dad took it to the shop to have it looked at. Of course, it was not
fixed under warranty because of the tube juxtaposition. It cost my step-dad
$9.48 to have it repaired (in 1965 dollars), and cost me a good butt

TV tubes are a different story- they are run much harder and closer to their

find marginal or even very marginal emission tubes work just fine. I replace

My experience is from working with literally thousands of car radios.

To be honest, after all this time I don't really &quot;troubleshoot&quot; these
things.  I replace all paper capacitors, electrolytics, vibrator, and
replace any tubes that are weak, and THEN test and align.  However in my
methods of rebuilding, I can generally determine what the radio was doing or
not doing, and figure out what the original cause of the failure was.  For
example, the first thing I do is remove the vibrator and rectifier, and hit
the B+ line with 230 volts and watch the current draw.  I would estimate
that a good 1/3 of these radios is pulling current, nearly always from bad
electrolytics.  If current is bad, my next step is to ohm out the power
transformer, to ensure the filter didn't take the transformer with it.  If
bad, and I can't find a replacement, there's not much use in taking it
further.  However the good news is that I've had very few transformer
failures.

Once current is minimal, I then light up the filaments and see what happens.
About 90% of the time the radio plays.  Maybe weak or noisy, but plays.
Now -- nobody, then or now, pulls out the radio and sends it for repair
because it's a little weak or noisy.  Either it's really bad, or doesn't
play at all.  So, what did I bypass?  The vibrator and rectifier.  Others on
this list have told horror stories of rectifiers shorting out and causing
problems with home radios.  I have not had such experience with car radios.
Sometimes the rectifier tests weak, but works anyway.  This leaves the
vibrator -- and one little forgotten component, the buffer.  Vibrators
simply wear out -- sometimes accelerated by a bad buffer.  Oh yes, you can
kick it, drop it, open it up and fiddle with the contacts, or you can be a
responsible technician and replace it with a solid state replacement.  Do
the solid state guys fail?  Yes.  However in EVERY case I've found the
reason.  Either the original buffer is still in there (or in a few cases,
missing!), or some expert mechanic recently worked on the car and
reconnected the battery backwards.  So -- out of most of that remaining
two-thirds where the filters didn't fail, the vibrator went south, either by
itself or by another cause.

I might interject here -- people replace the vibrator frequently but the
problem is elsewhere.  How many times has someone replaced the same tube in
a TV set, every month or so, over and over again?  Maybe the tube wasn't the
real problem?

Now -- out of the rest of those radios -- what fails?  Quite often a tube
SOCKET is dirty, and a silent radio comes to life with some jiggling.
Switches go bad, wires break, solder joints go, and yes -- somewhere in the
rest of the pile I've seen radios with bad tubes.  Often these are
curious -- I pull out a tube and it's got an open filament.  I pull out the
next and it's shorted.  Next one, another bad filament.  As I keep pulling
tubes I find I'm batting for a thousand.  I check and find the fellow bought
the radio really cheap at a swap meet.  Uh-huh!

On the vast majority of radios, I rebuild, recap, clean, tinker, adjust, and
THEN pull out the tubes to see if any are weak.  On the average I'll find
two weak ones and replace them.  Occasionally -- here's the scary part --
I'll put in an NOS tube right from the box and introduce a problem.
Reception goes bad, AVC acts up, wonderbar quits working, etc.  Turns out
the tube, even though it tests good on my B&amp;K 747B, is the culprit.  Go
figure -- fortunately it doesn't happen often.

There are a few radios that seem to be okay right from the start.  Yes, they
still get the recap and total treatment, but the customers usually get a
phone call asking about such things as the antenna, speaker, etc., as
something besides the radio itself prompted them to send it to me.  Indeed
we usually find another problem somewhere.

So -- while I'm not going to say that tubes never cause a radio to fail, I
can definitely tell you that tubes are not the likely cause.

As for your being &quot;full of it&quot;, I'm not going to say that.  What we
experienced in the past is just that; and what I've stated is based on my
experience of rebuilding these radios on the bench.  If you've had
experiences where tubes fixed the problems, congratulations.  However that
doesn't appear to be the norm.

I beg to differ... they were not &quot;rigged&quot; to show tubes bad, its that they
were such poor testers they were more likely to show a bad tube as &quot;good&quot;.
Anyone here knows the weakness of tube testers runs in this direction more
than the other.

I just did a 1960 era Maggybox stereo... it ran one 6BQ5 per channel... they
were the original tubes, both tested perfect on my Hickok Cardmatic...  and,
after 15mins or so of playing they would &quot;run away&quot;  up to 16v bias...into
distortion.   Even with the same amount of time in the tester, they didnt
show bad.   Another good pair did not do this, and the bias stayed rock
steady at 7.5v

Sams continues to issue new ones to this day, but the number has
definitely declined. There are several reasons:

1. The number of independent service outlets-Sams main bread-and-butter
source of revenue-has declined. Most of what's left are factory
authorized, which means they already have the service literature
directly from the manufacturer, so they have most/all of the data that
Sams would provide already.

2. There are less items being manufactured that are worth servicing,
even if parts are available. A case in point: I was given a Panasonic
5-disc DVD player with a bad spindle motor. A new motor cost $42.00. I
bought one, and spent about two hours installing it. It works fine now
and is a quite nice unit, but if I actually had to charge someone else
money for the labor plus the part cost, it would have come seriously
close to the cost of a brand new unit. Big screen TVs and professional
quality equipment are still worth it to fix due to their stiff retail
prices but there isn't all that much else that's worth a damn from a
repair standpoint.

3. The information that Sams provided-complete schematics of everything,
with parts diagrams and details ad nauseum, are less relevant now in a
world where component-level repair is nigh-on impossible due to surface
mount components and epoxy-potted sections. Board-level is more the norm
now, which limits the value of detailed service info somewhat.

4. Sams changed hands a number of times in the past 15 years or so, and
for awhile there was a huge emphasis on computer-related publishing,
with little related to actual repair. IIRC, It is now two separate
entities, with one publishing the service info and the other publishing
how-to books.

So, yes, it has broken down, but its breakdown correlates almost
precisely with that of the consumer electronic servicing industry in
general. Not very surprising, when you think about it.

I have an in-store tube tester designed for use in Sears-Roebuck stores.

pot inside, wired directly to the meter. I don't have the original
alignment instructions for it, but I reckon you could set that pot as

These units were intended to be as simple to use as possible, but they
still had plenty of control knobs and up to three of the same size

person could just walk up to the tester cold turkey and figure out how

HAPPENS - more than one might want to believe!
Back in the hey day of CB, I repaired many due to being hooked up reverse

think that if they didn't know the reason for red or black wire - the book
would tell them which was which - but apparently - they didn't bother to

&gt;&gt; Then call me Mr. Blow.

&gt;&gt; Sorry. Not my experience. Now, you can dispute my experience if you like,
&gt;&gt; but I can tell you that I had at least 3 different radios in the house
&gt;&gt; &quot;fixed&quot; by simply changing a tube.

&gt; My experience is from working with literally thousands of car radios.

&gt; To be honest, after all this time I don't really &quot;troubleshoot&quot; these
&gt; things.  I replace all paper capacitors, electrolytics, vibrator, and
&gt; replace any tubes that are weak, and THEN test and align.  However in my
&gt; methods of rebuilding, I can generally determine what the radio was doing or
&gt; not doing, and figure out what the original cause of the failure was.  For
&gt; example, the first thing I do is remove the vibrator and rectifier, and hit
&gt; the B+ line with 230 volts and watch the current draw.  I would estimate
&gt; that a good 1/3 of these radios is pulling current, nearly always from bad
&gt; electrolytics.  If current is bad, my next step is to ohm out the power
&gt; transformer, to ensure the filter didn't take the transformer with it.  If
&gt; bad, and I can't find a replacement, there's not much use in taking it
&gt; further.  However the good news is that I've had very few transformer
&gt; failures.

&gt; Once current is minimal, I then light up the filaments and see what happens.
&gt; About 90% of the time the radio plays.  Maybe weak or noisy, but plays.
&gt;  Now -- nobody, then or now, pulls out the radio and sends it for repair
&gt; because it's a little weak or noisy.  Either it's really bad, or doesn't
&gt; play at all.  So, what did I bypass?  The vibrator and rectifier.  Others on
&gt; this list have told horror stories of rectifiers shorting out and causing
&gt; problems with home radios.  I have not had such experience with car radios.
&gt; Sometimes the rectifier tests weak, but works anyway.  This leaves the
&gt; vibrator -- and one little forgotten component, the buffer.  Vibrators
&gt; simply wear out -- sometimes accelerated by a bad buffer.  Oh yes, you can
&gt; kick it, drop it, open it up and fiddle with the contacts, or you can be a
&gt; responsible technician and replace it with a solid state replacement.  Do
&gt; the solid state guys fail?  Yes.  However in EVERY case I've found the
&gt; reason.  Either the original buffer is still in there (or in a few cases,
&gt; missing!), or some expert mechanic recently worked on the car and
&gt; reconnected the battery backwards.  So -- out of most of that remaining
&gt; two-thirds where the filters didn't fail, the vibrator went south, either by
&gt; itself or by another cause.

&gt; I might interject here -- people replace the vibrator frequently but the
&gt; problem is elsewhere.  How many times has someone replaced the same tube in
&gt; a TV set, every month or so, over and over again?  Maybe the tube wasn't the
&gt; real problem?

&gt; Now -- out of the rest of those radios -- what fails?  Quite often a tube
&gt; SOCKET is dirty, and a silent radio comes to life with some jiggling.
&gt; Switches go bad, wires break, solder joints go, and yes -- somewhere in the
&gt; rest of the pile I've seen radios with bad tubes.  Often these are
&gt; curious -- I pull out a tube and it's got an open filament.  I pull out the
&gt; next and it's shorted.  Next one, another bad filament.  As I keep pulling
&gt; tubes I find I'm batting for a thousand.  I check and find the fellow bought
&gt; the radio really cheap at a swap meet.  Uh-huh!

&gt; On the vast majority of radios, I rebuild, recap, clean, tinker, adjust, and
&gt; THEN pull out the tubes to see if any are weak.  On the average I'll find
&gt; two weak ones and replace them.  Occasionally -- here's the scary part --
&gt; I'll put in an NOS tube right from the box and introduce a problem.
&gt; Reception goes bad, AVC acts up, wonderbar quits working, etc.  Turns out
&gt; the tube, even though it tests good on my B&amp;K 747B, is the culprit.  Go
&gt; figure -- fortunately it doesn't happen often.

&gt; There are a few radios that seem to be okay right from the start.  Yes, they
&gt; still get the recap and total treatment, but the customers usually get a
&gt; phone call asking about such things as the antenna, speaker, etc., as
&gt; something besides the radio itself prompted them to send it to me.  Indeed
&gt; we usually find another problem somewhere.

&gt; So -- while I'm not going to say that tubes never cause a radio to fail, I
&gt; can definitely tell you that tubes are not the likely cause.

&gt; As for your being &quot;full of it&quot;, I'm not going to say that.  What we
&gt; experienced in the past is just that; and what I've stated is based on my
&gt; experience of rebuilding these radios on the bench.  If you've had
&gt; experiences where tubes fixed the problems, congratulations.  However that
&gt; doesn't appear to be the norm.
">

I think that your experience working on antique car radios can't be used
accurately for the majority of the electronics industry. Certainly not
when these type of radios were still being manufactured.

I don't know much about them, but I would guess that most of the radios
you are likely to see are from cars that were scrapped. This was back in
the days when a 5 year-old car with 70,000 miles was considered &quot;old&quot;
and soon ready for replacement. So when the radio was pulled it probably
would have been ~10 years old and chances are good that the radio was
operational when the car was scrapped.

As I recall, large dealers had a man on staff who did nothing but fix
car radios. In smaller towns, car radios were a major piece of the
business to the ubiquitous Motorola dealers found in almost every town
in America. The explosion in two-way radio sales and service being the
other portion.

You also have to consider that car radios were considered a &quot;luxury
item&quot; and the more wealthy among us don't usually worry much about what
it costs to get something on their car fixed. They just take it to the
dealer.

I don't doubt that you don't see many bad tubes. Chances are excellent
that The parts you are talking about (except maybe the vibrator)
degrade, not from usage, as tubes do, but from age. Those lousy
paper/wax caps were still usually good for about ten to twenty years.
The tubes and caps were fine when the radio was taken out of service
because it wasn't taken out of service because it was busted.

Tubes do not degrade from age at all, they degrade when they are heated
up and cooled down over and over. This is also hard on the sockets.
Additionally, tubes don't like vibration, so they had an even harder
time surviving in an auto. I heard, but do not know, that some tubes
that went into cars, were &quot;special&quot; in that the normal tubes would not
last because of the vibration, so Delco and Moto, had tubes made just
for them. It was tubes as to why the car companies flocked to solid
state transistors, when they usually lagged behind (and often still do)
when it comes to electronics.

That said, a good technician, while any radio was in for a new tube,
would replace leaky or melting caps as a matter of course while he had
it apart.

I own a McIntosh MX115 and MC2105 which were both manufactured in the
Binghamton plant in 1971. Both are in daily use. I replaced the left
channel outputs on the MC2105 in 1993. Aside from occasionally changing
some light bulbs nothing else has been done to them. They sound great.

My first &quot;real&quot; job was as a technician repairing oscilloscoped and
other T &amp; M equipment for Philips. I agree that a lot of the stuff
turned out today is not repairable. But I always havemy eye out for
older stuff to fix up.

Sad to say, but I am seeing it, too. PC parts, such as CDRWs, made in
the last couple of years, don't last as long as ones made 5-7 years ago.
Those are still working.

Yesterday, I opened up a 6 CD player because the carousel and reader
motors had quit. It powered up normally and the drawer worked fine. Took
me about 2 seconds to fix it.

I don't know what they call it, but it is a really stiff plastic cable
that fits into I think it's called a zif socket is right on top. Knowing
these can be trouble, I unplug it and replug it and off she goes. I was
happy that it was an easy fix, because if it had been tough, those
things cost ~$200 to replace.

Date of manufacture: 1991. Gosh, I didn't think it was that old. &quot;Time
flies when you start getting older.&quot;

Years ago I got slapped in the face with that realization.  I had a

down the manufacturer -- actually just the folks who put their name on
imported fans --  and called:

Me: Do you have a motor for Model XYZ?

Lady: No, we don't keep or sell spare parts. You have to send us the
entire fan for repair replacement under warranty.

Me:  You're kidding.  But the rest of the fan is perfectly good.  I
repair these things, I can just install the motor on my own.
*pause*  Oh well, thanks.

I actually packed up the monster and sent it back to these folks,
thinking I'd maybe just get the same thing back with a new motor..  A
few weeks later an entirely brand new fan showed up in retail
packaging!

Sure it was neat, I got a new unit but still.  What a waste of
resources.  What happened to the old fan? I betcha it ended up in some
town dump.   :(

My mom's electric iron developed a leak in the hot water tank?  Any
luck of scoring a replacement tank?  Nope.  Just plunk down another 30
bucks for another iron. Screw the fact that the element, thermostat
and other parts were still good.    Nobody keeps any parts anymore.
Everything's brought in from abroad, so who's going to bother?

This may sound political, but -- well, that's where we are.

Over the years the good ol' USA has, in the interest of making things better
for us workers, enacted laws to improve working conditions, increase minimum
wages, and other things.  Each time we experience inflation and joblessness.
So we created welfare for the unemployed -- with the &quot;rich&quot; people (industry
and employers) covering the cost.  Bottom line, we have nicer offices and
are making money, but the products cost so much to produce that it's MUCH
cheaper to have them made overseas and ship them here.  Not only that, it's
less expensive in many cases to ship you a new unit than it is to pay
someone to troubleshoot and fix the old one.

If a fan costs $59.95 new, it probably costs Wal-Mart $25.  The manufacturer
probably paid less than 50 cents for the fan AND its packaging --
remembering they are doing this in massive quantities.  If they send you a
new fan, they're out 50 cents plus shipping.  If they try to service the old
one, they would have to order a new motor from China, pay an in-house
serviceman to install and test it, repackage it, and THEN ship it.  Either
they would have to stock new motors at a lower quantity rate than the fans
(making them more expensive!) or special-order the motor, which could take
months.

Big screen TV's and computers can be another matter (even then they replace
PCB's, not components), so service is provided.  However for items selling
for less than $100, chances are they'll toss it and give you a new one.

What will happen to the economy and labor in the future?  Nobody knows for
sure, but we can speculate.  Those who work for peanuts will save their
money and become richer (imagine that!), or at least more experienced, and
will seek better paying jobs.  Eventually the conditions in China will
improve in a similar manner to the US.  Will manufacturing move to Africa or
some other third world place?  Possibly.  Will US ingenuity come up with a
way to make domestic products for less?  Possibly.  Will politics screw up
the normal transition of things?  For sure.  But one thing's certain --
economy will continue to change.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think that your experience working on antique car radios can't be used
&gt; accurately for the majority of the electronics industry. Certainly not
&gt; when these type of radios were still being manufactured.

&gt; I don't know much about them, but I would guess that most of the radios
&gt; you are likely to see are from cars that were scrapped. This was back in
&gt; the days when a 5 year-old car with 70,000 miles was considered &quot;old&quot; and
&gt; soon ready for replacement. So when the radio was pulled it probably would
&gt; have been ~10 years old and chances are good that the radio was
&gt; operational when the car was scrapped.

&gt; As I recall, large dealers had a man on staff who did nothing but fix car
&gt; radios. In smaller towns, car radios were a major piece of the business to
&gt; the ubiquitous Motorola dealers found in almost every town in America. The
&gt; explosion in two-way radio sales and service being the other portion.
">

Looks like you've just contradicted yourself.  If radios were still working
when the car was scrapped, why did the dealers have full-time techs?

Indeed, paper caps fail because they are old, but they really fail because
they are paper.  They failed back then.  At the time, the problem was not so
bad that every cap had to be replaced -- only the bad ones, but then the
replacement was another paper cap.  Today we make our radios more reliable
by replacing ALL those caps with a better design.  Sure -- some still test
good, but why put them back in?

As I said earlier, vibrators had an expected life of only 18 months.  These,
and tubes, were user-replaceable, so you could indeed check and replace
these.  However, as I said, tubes usually don't cause radios to fail --
maybe weak reception, but not fail.  Capacitors, switches, controls, and
other parts were big factors, then as now.

By the way, I receive radio in all conditions, from museum pieces to
rustbuckets.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Met vriendelijke groet,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Maarten Bakker.

&gt;&gt; I've seen many items already that did just that - last &quot;about&quot; a year
&gt;&gt; (warranty period) - then die. Some didn't even make it that long - but
&gt;&gt; usually - with shipping and so on - not worth the aggrivation to ship off
&gt;&gt; to have repaired if no local shops. So your words are already coming to
&gt;&gt; pass.

&gt; Sad to say, but I am seeing it, too. PC parts, such as CDRWs, made in the
&gt; last couple of years, don't last as long as ones made 5-7 years ago. Those
&gt; are still working.

&gt; Yesterday, I opened up a 6 CD player because the carousel and reader
&gt; motors had quit. It powered up normally and the drawer worked fine. Took
&gt; me about 2 seconds to fix it.

&gt; I don't know what they call it, but it is a really stiff plastic cable
&gt; that fits into I think it's called a zif socket is right on top. Knowing
&gt; these can be trouble, I unplug it and replug it and off she goes. I was
&gt; happy that it was an easy fix, because if it had been tough, those things
&gt; cost ~$200 to replace.

&gt; Date of manufacture: 1991. Gosh, I didn't think it was that old. &quot;Time
&gt; flies when you start getting older.&quot;
">

I bought a desk top computer about a year ago - the DVD/CD ROM unit went
south - &quot;long&quot; ago. First it quit playing DVDs - then CDs, now anything. For
a while, it would do uploads of software and play music. It was cheaper for
me to go buy a unit to put in - than to ship it back for warranty work.

Yep - it's basically ALL junk - now.

Give me the old stuff - any day.

I know of a specialty speaker that sells for $49.95.  When the
&quot;manufacturer&quot; went to China to strike a deal with the company who was to
make them, they submitted plans -- and the people actually built such a
speaker and set it on the table within minutes!  In quantity I believe the
cost of the speaker is about 29 cents.  Add 15 cents for packaging, comes to
44 cents for the boxed product.

Electronic parts have always been this way, even when they were built in the
US.  You can go to Radio Shack and buy two resistors for $1.98, or go to a
wholesaler and get 1,000 for $5.  Of course the wholesaler is making money .
. . when it comes to manufacturing cost, even the big parts cost only
pennies out of the factory.  The real cost is in the design, shipping, and
marketing.

Why not be  more specific? What specialty speaker are you talking about? I
am in that business, and happen to know quite a bit about costs. The only
speakers that cost 29 cents would have to be complete and utter junk. A
decent sized magnet alone costs considerably more than that, even in China.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I fail to see your point . . . Do you think all those big tube
&gt; &gt;&gt; testers were taking up all that valuable retail space because they didn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; sell tubes?

&gt; &gt; They were rigged to make okay tubes read &quot;REPLACE&quot; and tested only
&gt; &gt; emission which almost never makes a difference in how the set operates.
&gt; &gt; Their SOLE purpose was indeed to SELL tubes. Once in awhile they did
&gt; &gt; indeed catch a tube with an open filament and thereby a radio was fixed,
&gt; &gt; but bad tubes are and were very rarely the reason why an radio doesn't
&gt; &gt; work.

&gt; &gt; http://antiqueradios.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=74463

&gt; &gt; Drugstore tube testers are certainly one thing that made the old days bad.

&gt; &gt; John H.

&gt; I recall several times (from my youth) where the drug store tester did
&gt; identify
&gt; a defective tube from a TV and the replacement solved the problem. Without
&gt; the call from a TV technician. The use of this saved many dollars for my
&gt; family.

&gt; -Mike
">

I agree as I made many trips to the local drug store (Sav-on) in my
youth and tested many tubes. Most times it did fix the problem.
Sometimes all checked good and I had to get help from my &quot;Elmer&quot; and
learned how to repair the problem.
As far as if they were accurate I always tested the new tube on the
same tester before leaving the store. Once in a while a socket would
go bad on the drug store testers and all tubes put into that one bad
socket would test bad even the replacement. When that happened I would
also double check the tube at a different location. I would also
double check the tube if it tested bad was not a symptom of the
problem. Example: bad audio output tube on a set with perfect sound.
I aways wondered if the people that claimed the testers were rigged
were the techs that lost money on them due to lost service calls?

Talking components like resistors makes sense.  The cost at Radio Shack is set at a
designed price point to take advantage of those people in a hurry to get one.

Talking about a $59.95 fan at Walmart being produced for under 50 cents is not even
slightly believable.

The speaker story is highly suspicious also.

It is amazing how durable this urban legend is about tube testers and the
&quot;good&quot; old days. I even posted documentary links, and myself have restored
hundreds of broken sets and perhaps three were made operable by replacing a
bad tube. But since the &quot;good&quot; old days are safely gone I guess you can say
anything you want about them. You can even create a further section of the
Drugstore Tester Days legend that disqualifies any negative publicity as the
work of jealous scheming techs trying to thwart the little guy from helping
himself.
