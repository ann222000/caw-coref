Kucinich Grills Rumsfeld at Tillman Hearing

Wednesday 01 August 2007

Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich accused Donald Rumsfeld on
Wednesday of participating in a widespread cover-up over the
circumstances in the death of Army Cpl. Pat Tillman.

Kucinich, a 2008 presidential candidate, questioned the former
secretary of defense during a Congressional investigation into
Tillman's death and expressed doubt about the veracity of Rumsfeld's
testimony.

The investigation turned to the senior military leadership at the
time of Tillman's death. The hearings left key questions unanswered,
despite testimony from former military leaders who were in charge of
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In his first public appearance since leaving the Bush
administration, former Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld testified
Wednesday that he could not recall how or when he learned of Cpl. Pat
Tillman's death. Kucinich accused Rumsfeld of being involved in a
string of cover-ups.

&quot;Well, you know, maybe it was good because you actually covered
up the Tillman case for awhile, you covered up the Jessica Lynch
case, you covered up Abu Ghraib, so something was working for you.&quot;

Rumsfeld asserted that he had not been involved in a cover-up or
any attempt to create a false narrative. Kucinich then inquired about
the involvement of the Rendon Group, a public relations firm that has
previously contracted with the Department of Defense and the CIA in
overseas propaganda efforts. Kucinich asked Rumsfeld if the Rendon
Group was involved with creating a &quot;press strategy,&quot; or media spin
for the Tillman incident. Rumsfeld denied the involvement of the
group in the Tillman case, but later said that &quot;entities within the
DOD&quot; have held contracts with the group. He did not specify whether
the contracts were ongoing.

Under oath, Rumsfeld testified that he could not recall when he
learned that the Tillman story being perpetuated by the White House
was false. He said that he tried to stay out of the investigation and
did not discuss the matter with the president. He repeatedly said
that his lack of involvement in the Tillman investigation was
intentional because he wanted to avoid &quot;command influence,&quot; later
adding that he learned of Tillman's death &quot;at a stage when
investigations were underway, so I wouldn't have told anyone to do
anything.&quot;

The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been examining
the cover-up of the death of Corporal Tillman, the former Arizona
Cardinals football star. On April 22, 2004 while on patrol in
Afghanistan, Tillman was shot in the head by an American soldier, an
incident often referred to as &quot;friendly fire.&quot; Public statements by
the military claimed Tillman was killed by Taliban fighters in
combat. This patently false explanation was not corrected for over a
month, and was only revealed as false after the official story began
to collapse. Military officials have been accused of trying to cover
up the fratricide by falsifying evidence, altering the statement made
by a soldier who witnessed the event, and by posthumously awarding
Tillman the Silver Star for valor, implying that he died at the hands
of the enemy.

The Army has officially placed the blame for the incident on
retired General Philip Kensinger Jr., who was censured Tuesday for a
failure of leadership. Kensinger refused to appear before the
committee Wednesday and said that he would not comply with a subpoena
for his testimony. US marshals have reportedly been unable to track
down Kensinger to serve him with the Congressional subpoena.

Wednesday's hearing focused on what the senior military and
civilian leadership knew about Tillman's death. Three top-ranking
retired generals - Richard Myers, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff; John Abizaid, former Central Command leader, and Bryan
Brown, former Special Operations commander - all blamed
communications breakdowns for their lack of action in the matter.
None took personal responsibility for allowing the fabricated story
of Tillman's death to be perpetuated.

In his opening remarks, the chairman of the committee, Henry
Waxman (D-California), said, &quot;The concealment of Corporal Tillman's
fratricide caused millions of Americans to question the integrity of
our government, yet no one will tell us when and how the White House
learned the truth.&quot;

Members of Tillman's family have accused the Bush administration
of covering up the fratricide, falsifying a heroic story about
Tillman's death in order to exploit his death to try to shore up
support for the war in Iraq.

According to the three retired generals who participated in the
hearing, none of them informed the White House that the public story
of Tillman's death was in doubt. All three generals were included in
a memo that specifically asked them to inform the White House that
the official story was in question. The memo was written by
Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal, commander of the Joint Task
Force for Afghanistan &quot;in order to preclude any unknowing statements
by our country's leaders which might cause public embarrassment if
the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death become public.&quot;

It is unclear when the White House learned that the fabricated
Tillman narrative was in question. The White House has refused to
turn over to Congress internal documents that relate to Tillman's
death, citing executive privilege.

Retired General John P. Abizaid, former commander of US Central
Command, testified that he did not relay the concerns about the
Tillman story because he did not receive the urgent memo from
McChrystal in time. Abizaid said the letter was delayed for at least
a week because of &quot;reasons of difficulties with our systems within
the headquarters,&quot; adding later that the memo was marked &quot;deliver
during normal duty hours.&quot; This explanation was not challenged by
members of the committee.

General Brown blamed his failure to bring the memo to the
attention of the White House on not being the primary addressee on
the memo. He said that he was a secondary addressee and that he
figured one of the primary recipients would follow up on the memo.

In the final minutes of the hearing, General Abizaid said, &quot;It is
difficult to come to grips with how we screwed this thing up, but we
screwed this thing up.&quot;

Waxman's closing statements criticized the explanations from
Rumsfeld and the generals and made clear that the investigation will
continue. &quot;'The system didn't work; errors were made;' that is too
passive. Somebody should be responsible and we are trying to figure
that out,&quot; Waxman said.
