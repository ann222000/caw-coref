The Dalai Lama: Nice Guy

The priestly class in Pre-Chinese intervention: Not So Nice Guys.

Conclusion: it's possible to get a Nice Guy out of a class of
people that perhaps deviate somewhat from nice.

IMHO the Dalai Lama is well-regarded by Westerners because his home
country is being oppressed by an occupying power. So to get a
Salafist Imam as well regarded as the Dalai Lama, have the Middle
East occupied by an oppressor; I'd bet on the USSR after a very
different outcome to WWII. It'd also help if alt-George Harrison
converted to Islam...

Salafi is a bit of a red herring here. While contemporaneously
identified with Usama bin Laden, the movement itself is a sort of
recurrant reformist base in Islamic history; the ideal of returning to
the pious communities of Mecca and Medina in the time of the Prophet,
much as Luther dreamed of bypassing Augustine to reach the original
intent of the church fathers, and certain parties in black robes grope
at the constitution.

The /founders/ of Salafism, while widely unknown outside of Near East
Studies, would be viewed as perfectly nice people.

Salafism, in its modern form, was created by Sayyid Jamāl al-Dīn al-
Afghānī and his students Muhammad Abduh and Muhammad Rashid Rida.

Al-Afghani was anti-colonial and advocated a sort of pan-Islamist
modernism that would unite the lands of Islam in order to expel the
foreigners. He was accused of being involved in a plot that killed the
Shah, and in exchange for being kept out of Persian hands, he wrote
much of the Sultan Abdul Hamid II's Pan-Islamist program.

Abduh, his student, created the form of what we'd now call Salafiyyeh.
While it retains the initial anti-colonialism, it added the idea of
the Salafiyyeh, the pious forebears. In Abduh's reading at al-Azhar,
he argued that the Islamic forefathers were rational and flexible in
their approach to faith, and that the strictures of later generations
had produced a rigid sort of Islam that was unresponsive to modernism.
Islamic jurisprudence, he argued, could easily keep its core values
while adapting to modern life.

Rashid al-Rida's interpretation of Al-Afghani was less flexible than
Abduh's. It suggested that renewal lay in rejecting all things Western
and abandoning Sufism for pure Islam of the forebears.

These fertile strands of thought were popularized by Hassan al-Banna,
who founded the Muslim Brotherhood, favoring a mixture of Abduh and
Ridda and popularizing it throughout the region. In Iran, the idea was
picked up by Jalal Al-e Ahmad to build his idea of "Westoxification."

The downside is that the founders of Salifiyyeh were apostates to the
western regimes that ruled their countries at the time; though Egypt
allowed publication, it ghettozed Abduh and limited his potential to
become populist like the Islamic Brotherhood.

Here ends the lesson.

One possibility for an appealing Salafist would be Mohammed Naguib's
Egypt--see
http://tinyurl.com/2p3c5p

Naguib is a Kemal model nationalist, though rather more pragmatic--Ben
Ali's Tunisia on steroids. Jonathan suggested that he'd split the
"silly" part of the Ikhwan from the "Serious."

This produces the tame, regime sponsored Islamism of Taha Hussein. It
takes its lead from Mohammed Abduh, calling itself "Modernist Islamic
Salafism" and speaks to a broad, flexible, modernist society that
neither rejects its Islamic traditions nor is destroyed by Western
industrialization.

The less popular, more vulgar, tame opposition Ikhwan offers a
populist variation on that line.

At present, the Muslim Brotherhood and other Salafist parties hold
seats in the lower houses of parliament of several Gulf States. Give
it a while, and that'll be respectable; a cannier Sheikh of Bahrain in
the first generation might have been able to co-opt the Muslim
Brotherhood against the Shi'a.

Another way to create palatable modern Salafists would be to short-
circuit the Yemeni Civil War, or give Saudi Arabia rather different
leadership. I'll get to that tomorrow in a separate post.

The Libyan Senussi had both Salafist and Sufi roots.

Senussi practice is austere but not extreme, supposedly.

The Senussi were the main part of the resistance to
Italian rule, and became allies with Britain during
WW II. If the Senussi chief Idris had been a charismatic

Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, not so nice person, but more concerned with
other Muslims being apostates than with slaughtering the infidels. The
Wahabbis call themselves Salafis, and see him as an important figure.

However if you want a nice guy from one of these communities here's a
thought of mine... have the Al-Saud clan lose /bad/ so that Arabia is
run by more Orthodox muslims. Then have them brutally persecute the
Wahabbis.

There's prescedents for both, after the Saudis' took Mecca in 1802
Mehmet Ali (the Albanian proto-Khedive of Egypt and also not a nice
person, though a very interesting Peter the Great sort) began waging war
on them. This all ended in 1818 with the leader of the Saudi's being
sent off to Constantinople to be hanged, and after that the Wahabbis
were considerably weakened.

So those poor Wahhabbis are being persecuted! Now remove Sayyid al-Qutb,
replace him with a more mellow figure who is far more concerned with
purifying Islam than he is with dealing with the Infidels. Better yet
have him lead some brave but futile resistance somewhere in Arabia, and
have some Europeans there too; nothing like that Arabian mystique.

Then after he's exiled have him organise charities, have some
celebrities fawn on him, and make a movie about his life... Maybe even
give him a line of Islamically sound Arabic medicine, after all people
love Ayurveda and Chinese medicine. Then whenever some terrorist group
strikes he says "This is due to the additions and impurities that these
&lt;insert group&gt; have added to Islam!" and condemns the act and the group.

I think that would just about cover it without any need for Communist
take overs of the Middle-East.

Khomeini = Islamic Communism. Fascism with Islamic roots has more in
common with Saddam Hussein's Baath party, the Iraqi equivalent of a
what one would call A National Socialist Party, not THE National
Socialist Party (Nazional-Sozialisches Deutsches Arbeiter Partei).
Hussein regarded himself as the modern Nasser. What we need is somone
like the Ismaili Aga Khan. A more liberal version of Abu Omar ibn Ali
Al-Khayyam, the leader of the Medieval Assassins. Perhaps an Afghan
warlord fighting the Soviets? Not Osama bin Laden, obviously. If Bin
Laden had been more pro-Western then maybe hatred of political
corruption and immorality does not have to mean the same as being anti-
Western. That kind of connection tends to be made by Fascist radicals,
since Christian conservatives in the West have a vested interest in
maintaining the status quo.

And given the nature of Shi'ia Islam a Salafist Khomeini even moreso.

Still a communist revolution in a territorialy intact Ottoman Empire
may give a sufficently charismatic Salafist Imam a decent platform.
Although said movement is more explicitly at odds with post-
enlightenment 'innovations' and unlikely to appeal to social liberals
on it's own merits at all.

Also, depending on circumstances, it might be convenient to
present as a nice guy someone who deviates somewhat from the Standard
Model of Niceness. Uncle Joe in WWII would be an example.

Speaking of Uncle Joe, he went to some lengths to avoid or
at delay a war with the Germans, prefering to fight opponents who
were far weaker than he was. Suppose, and I guess this requires
an alt-Stalin, he looks at the Munich Agreement and thinks "The West
are morons. This guy isn't going to be satisfied until Germany reaches
the Urals, if then," and arranges a prophelactic attack on Germany.

I was going to say that this kills the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
but maybe it doesn't: a joint invasion of Poland would make a decent
cover to get Soviet forces in position to attack Germany (That is,
if Germany expects the SU to attack Poland, then troop movements are
not as alarming).

In this TL, the Soviets are not caught off-guard by
war with Germany (since they are the ones starting it) and since
the invasion of Poland has isolated Germany, the war goes in favour
of the Soviets. At the end, a friendly puppet government is installed
in Berlin and Soviet troops are at the border with France.

Hitler escapes. He could choose suicide (as in OTL) but
he doesn't. His first flight takes him to Spain, where Franco puts
him up.

Britain and France are understandably alarmed at the Red Menace
poised on the border of France. Now, prior to the Russo-German War,
Hitler was clearly a greater menace than Stalin but Hitler has been
deposed and is no more threatening than Napoleon in 1814. Opposing
Stalin is more important than pre-War unpleasantness. Some method of
unifying support for the Anti-Red Effort is needed.

It would be handy if there was a person who the public could
see as the face of Free Germany and well, there's a candidate handy
in Spain, the guy who saved Germany's economy before his experiment
was so cruelly destroyed by Stalin's sneak attack. Poland is unfortunate
but every nation has the occasional lapse in judgement.

Stalin really doesn't have any interest in conquering the rest
of Europe because assimilating Germany and Poland (and whatever else
he picked up on the road to Berlin) is going to take time. The border
between Red Europe and Free Europe becomes extremely well fortified
and Europe settled down for decades of peering fiercely at each other
over the barracades.

Hitler in this TL gets better health care and somewhat less
stress, dying in 1953 (one week after Stalin). By this point, he has been
the face of Free Germany for about a decade and he has proven to be at least
somewhat flexible in filling this role (I mean, a guy who starts off as
a police spy and ends up running the organization he was supposed to
spy on has to be at least somewhat adpatable). Kindly Uncle Addie is
still a virulent anti-semite but without the Holocaust, this is far
more acceptable. In any case, most of his speeches talk about the Evils
of Communism, which makes him a valuable tool for the Allies. As well,
there is reason to think the timing of his death isn't totally a coincidence
and that Reds engineered his sudden death (Not true but handy).

Of course, once the Slow War is over, people will look at Hitler
and wonder if they really want action dolls of this guy* on the shelves
but with most of the worst actions of Nazis butterflied away, his
reputation won't be nearly as dark as in OTL.

* I joke: they'd be of Otto Skorzeny, Agent of Freedom. He even appears
in an issue of Captain America.

He only became a nice guy after he hired a public relations firm which

This idea comes up against internal Soviet problems. You would need a
POD that does not include Stalin purging most of his more talented
generals and reorganising the Red Army. In OTL 1940 Stalin was writing
to the relevant authorities ordering them not to provoke the Germans
under any circumstances. It was expected that it would be 1942 at the

Well, this is alt-Stalin James is talking about, so he may have not
screwed up the army anywhere nearly as much. OTOH, the purges gave the
Germans an impression of Soviet military weakness: if the Russian army
looks stronger, would Hitler be so quick to remove that buffer between
himself and the USSR while he still had enemies at the rear?

(There was a thread earlier looking at what a Soviet-German war in
1939 might look like: IIRC, concensus was that the Soviet army was in
too crappy a shape to win, although the German army was sufficiently
weaker in 1939 than 1941 that I don't think they take Moscow,
especially with the French at their backs. Probably less dead Soviets
overall than OTL 1941, but it wouldn't be pretty, and the Red Army
won't be rapidly sweeping into Berlin.).

German intelligence gives credence to the argument that military
intelligence is an oxymoron. The estimates of Russian strength used for
planning Barberossa underestimated Soviet forces by about 2/3 anyway. I
doubt they would do any better in this timeline. The Germans needed raw
materials and the OTL deal over Poland was critical.
