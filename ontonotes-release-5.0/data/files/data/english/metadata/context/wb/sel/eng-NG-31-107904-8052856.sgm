Hi. I have heard about shifting without a clutch for quite a while now
but it's only now that I am seeking more information about it. I had 5
cars so far and they were all manual. Since I know everything else
about it pretty much well about driving part I mean I thought I would
learn what I don't really know that well yet which is shifting without
the clutch. How does it exactly work? From what I heard and read is
that the RPM must be between 3 000 and 4 000 is that right? What I
have personally tried though is putting my car into let's say 2nd gear
then going at a specific speed of like 20 miles per hour look at how
many RPM the engine is running at at that specific 20 miles per hour
which is at about 2 000 then accelerate to like 25 miles, put the car
back in neutral, take my foot of the gas pedal and once the car's
speed decreases to about 20, still in neutral, I press the gas pedal
again in order to reach those 2 000 RPM manually and gently slide the
shifter back into 2nd gear without using the clutch. That way it was
pretty successful but because I don't want to have to buy a new
transmission is the reason I'm asking about it. If the way I did it is
the proper way and there are no other ways it means that you must
exactly know at how many RPM the engine is running at for each
specific speed and then again for each gear which is a lot to
memorize. So my real question I think would be the following... Is
there another way to shift without the clutch or is the way I tried
the only possible way to do it? I also heard it is bad for the
transmission. Would that be because if you miss it grinds? I mean if
you get it right and the timing is perfect it doesn't harm to
transmission does it? And I also heard that if it is in fact risky it
is only fro synchronized transmissions because that way you can screw
up the synchronization of it (Well I mean if you don't do ir properly
right?) while non-synchronized transmissions are good for clutchless
shifting.

Thanks.

By the way I still don't know if my car has a synchronized
transmission or not so would anyone know what is in a 91 Honda Accord?
Thanks

No, as long as the gear speeds are matched, the transmission will
shift.

Before I get into the details, do you understand the basics of a
manual transmission?  IF not, go to howitworks.com and look it up.

Hi. Thanks for replying. I guess  you meant www.howstuffworks.com and
yes I do have a certain idea about how it works. All I wanted to know
is how to do it properly so if you could specify whatyou mean by as
long as the gear speeds are matched I would appreciate it. Thanks.

The rotational velocity of the transmission output shaft (being spun
by the drive tires while the tranny is in neutral) must match that of
the shaft upon which the gear being shifted to resides, within roughly
25 rpm.  This is easier to do at lower rpm, obviously, and easier
downshifting than upshifting.

A synchronized tranny will suffer some damage during the learning
process, and probably even when performed just right next to
perfectly.  Synchronizers are &quot;soft&quot; metal, usually brass or bronze.

Unsynchronized trannys with which this shifting technique is required
are built so tough as to be practically indestructible.

I recommend you forget about it.  It offers no advantages, much risk
(depending on your financial situation) and distracts from the primary
mission of not hitting anything.

Other way around.

When downshifting, one must use the accelerator to speed up the engine
revs (and input shaft). When upshifting, the engine revs will naturally
fall and thus fall through the point at which the revs match. As long as
you know what that rpm is (which you can discover by simply doing a
normal upshift and looking at the tach) you can simply move the shifter
at the correct moment.

Within certain wide parameters, I suppose.

For instance, racing transmissions have no synchronizers, but don't
require the driver to match revs on upshifts. They do this by having a
lot of lash between the teeth of the dog clutchs.

Being able to shift without the clutch is a good skill to have in case
of a clutch failure.  They are rare but do happen.  I had my PU clutch
slave cylinder fail on me out in the boonies last year. Knowing how to
clutchless shift got me back to town.

Technique:  Forget about the tach.  It may be useful when first
learning but your eyes belong on the road, not on the instrument
panel.  You will never make smooth shifts trying to watch a tach
anyhow.  Just a little practice will let you shift smoothly by 'ear',
i.e., sound of engine/drive line.

Coming out of gear you need to take the load off the gear train.  On a
downgrade, just lifting your foot off the gas does it.  On and upgrade
you have step a bit on the gas and then let off while pulling the
shifter to neutral.  Going into gear you have to match input/output
shaft rpms.

Upshift.  Easiest to learn on a slight down hill grade:  Take foot off
of gas and pull shifter into neutral.  Let engine revs die off and
somewhere in the process the gears will mesh without clashing.  Where
is that &quot;somewhere&quot;?  When the output shaft (driven by wheels) exaclty
matches the input shaft rpms (driven by the engine) - a few rpm
difference doesn't cause a problem.  If you can feel the shifter
engage the 'balk ring' without going all the way into gear you can
feel the right time to pull it all the way.  Practice, practice and
practice.  Yes you will grind gears when learning.

Downshift:  Comes a bit harder.  Again pull shifter into neutral but
this time you have to increase the engine rpm to match input/output
shaft rpm for the gear selected.

If you could find a manual, non synchro, rig and learn to double
clutch that will teach you all you need to also clutchless shift.  You
would probably need to go to a big truck (don't even know if they have
those any more) or a very old car (late 30s).

I forgot:  Yes, your care is a synchro tranny.  They haven't built non-

course.

I guess I was thinking of it in the context of street cars; all the
ones I've driven with non-synchro transmissions (actually just non-
synchro first gears) didn't generally require anyt special effort in
matching revs on upshifts, but downshifting did require a good bit of
skill - especially so because generally such vehicles had column shift
three-speeds, which tend not to age well...

All 3-speed equipped Studebakers that I've driven had non-synchro
first gears, right up until the end, or at least '64 (we could go off
on a tangent as to whether a '65 or '66 Studebaker is a &quot;real&quot;
Studebaker, but that wouldn't really be relevant...) those would be
Borg-Warner T-85 or T-86 transmissions.  Of course, most of those, or
at least most surviving were also equipped with (or have had added) a
planetary overdrive and therefore a 4.xx:1 rear end, therefore first
gear is almost never used in normal driving except when pulling away
from a stop, so it's not the hardship that you'd think it was.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the shaft upon which the gear being shifted to resides, within
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; roughly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 25 rpm.  This is easier to do at lower rpm, obviously, and easier
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; downshifting than upshifting.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other way around.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When downshifting, one must use the accelerator to speed up the engine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revs (and input shaft). When upshifting, the engine revs will naturally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fall and thus fall through the point at which the revs match. As long
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you know what that rpm is (which you can discover by simply doing a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; normal upshift and looking at the tach) you can simply move the shifter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the correct moment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A synchronized tranny will suffer some damage during the learning

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unsynchronized trannys with which this shifting technique is required

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, but I think he was trying to imply that the technique of rev-
&gt; &gt; &gt; matching is required, whether or not you use the clutch, which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually a true statement.

&gt; &gt; Within certain wide parameters, I suppose.

&gt; &gt; For instance, racing transmissions have no synchronizers, but don't
&gt; &gt; require the driver to match revs on upshifts. They do this by having a
&gt; &gt; lot of lash between the teeth of the dog clutchs.

&gt; I guess I was thinking of it in the context of street cars; all the

&gt; synchro first gears) didn't generally require anyt special effort in
&gt; matching revs on upshifts, but downshifting did require a good bit of
&gt; skill - especially so because generally such vehicles had column shift

Which reinforces my point about upshifts being easier than downshifts.

well... it's hard to UPSHIFT into first gear :)

Well, they're both pretty easy (if somebody shows you how to do it
right), but downshifting is easier, because you can control the
throttle more precisely by raising rpm (and holding it, professional
style) at the match point, and shift more quickly, allowing the
vehicle less time to change velocity due to drag or slope.

Upshifting you have to catch the rpm as they fall past the match
point, requiring better timing.  As in your vehicle may be going up or
down hill (but is most often slowing) and -that- match point is in a
constant state of change, for a much longer length of time.

Downshifting is faster, giving the vehicle less time to change
velocity.  Upshifting takes longer since you can raise the rpm faster
to downshift than they will fall to upshift.

That applies to &quot;training&quot;.  Anyone, I suppose, may find one harder
than another, since it does require some practice to learn to control
the throttle for downshifting (even with good training), and pretty
much anyone can jam it into gear as the rpm fall past the match point
(if they only know it) so you may be right in most instances.

Of course knowing all your shift and idle matches makes it all a piece
of cake...

Right.  My last manual tranny US car was a 57 chev.  It also had non-
synchro 1st.  Of course all 4spd US full-sized PUs have 1st as non-

from 2nd to 1st in a 4sp PU smoothly they have the technique mastered
(I can't do it but once in several tries).

2nd this. Apart from the fact it may allow you to limp home on a broken
clutch cable or similar, it will only make your shift slower and
generate more wear.

If you want to spend time perfecting your shift, work on matching revs
on up- as well as downshifts, so you can clutch quickly withing making
the car jump or shudder. The trick to gain speed in shifting is not to
shift quickly, but to clutch quickly.

If you are used to reving to about the right RPM before letting out
the clutch,(which saves wear on the clutch) you are about ready to
start doing it.
Before syncros came along the drill was to declutch, change revs and
gears, and engage clutch. Drivers learned it and truck / lorry drivers
had to do it for a longer time.

Where useful:
I was just about to enter the gates for a Blue Angel show south of
Boston (Mass.) when my clutch linkage went.
I waited until the crowds thinned as the show began and drove back to
Newton/brighton without using the clutch, going through the center of
Boston. You can bet that I looked far ahead and timed it so the lights
were green in all but two cases. I went through a red on one and
stopped the car, turned off the engine, put it in first and hit the
starter when the light turned green for the second, going back to
clutchless shifting for the rest of the trip.

May as well practice now, perhaps with a $200 outlay for a beater, so
you won't be stuck when your clutch or linkage fails.
One more tool in your kit doesn't hurt.

&gt;&gt; Nearly free of charge when it comes to the mechanical bits, so - why

&gt; Does this snyncros-on-reverse mean you shift into reverse when giong
&gt; forward? Why else have synros there?

That setup (thinking at Audi A3's and A4's that use it) allows you to
shift into reserve when rolling forward very slowly or when you've just
come to stop where you declutched from a higher gear.

It isn't strong enough when you're at high revs (&gt;&gt;3000) in first,
declutch and shift into reverse.

The clutch needs to be engaged again during the rev match or there is

&gt;Hi. Thanks for replying. I guess  you meant www.howstuffworks.com and
&gt;yes I do have a certain idea about how it works. All I wanted to know
&gt;is how to do it properly so if you could specify whatyou mean by as
&gt;long as the gear speeds are matched I would appreciate it. Thanks.
">

If I was going 30 mph the engine speed might be something like 800 rpm
in 5th, 1000 rpm in 4th, 1300 rpm in 3rd, 1800 rpm in 2nd or 2400 rpm
in 1st.

With the clutch out (engaged) if I rev the engine to the respective
rpm I should be able to select that gear fairly smoothly.

Clutchless shifts or perfect rev matching at other speeds would be
mathematically proportional.  Note the rpm difference between gears is
not constant, since the difference in trans ratios tends to be wider
in lower gears and closer in higher gears.

Easier just to go a speed, and note the rpm.

Very Light pressure on the gearshift while gently varying engine
speeds may help make the shift, but the sychros probably hate it.
Plus you have tocomplete the shift quick once things are aligned to
avoid the grrrrrrraunch.

I was thinking more about normal driving when you shift from 2nd to
third and engage the clutch at just he right speed  automatically.
FYI, I replaced my clutch at 180K. A racing frinds of mine (good
mechanic, good driver, horrible doing both the same day.) was out of
work and, as I knew he would be hitting me up for a loan, worked uot a
deal that he install a hotter engine and clutch.

Sorry for not saying it properly, if you had problms
