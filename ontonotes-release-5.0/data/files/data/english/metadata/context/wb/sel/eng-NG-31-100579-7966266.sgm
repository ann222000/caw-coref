Chapter IV.
THE STRATAGEM.

How we watched the next day! Monsieur Louis from his window, I
from mine, and little Ma'amselle Pauline from the flat roof of,a part
of the château, to which she had ascended through a small window in
the roof. How we watched! How we listened to the slightest sound on
the road! But the time rolled on; noon, afternoon, evening came, and
there was no sign of soldiers near. The old château still stood
peacefully among, the unbroken stillness of the pine-woods.

M. Louis had been gloomier than ever all day; but to me and to
Ma'amselle Pauline he spoke once or twice in an almost kind manner. He
took nothing from dawn to dusk except a crust of bread and a large
glass of brandy; and I observed that he scarcely ever moved from his
standing position at the window. I had often seen him stern and
unsociable, but never in such a mood before.

When it was quite dusk he roused himself a little, and then,
precisely at nine o'clock, he put on a large cloak, and, calling me to
follow him, set off at a rapid pace through the wildest and most
secluded part of the grounds. We walked very fast, but it was dark
when we reached the confines; and there, under a tree, I could dimly
see the figures of two men, with some dark object lying at their feet.

My master walked on, and spoke for some minutes to these men; and
then they went away, leaving the dark object on the ground.

Monsieur waited till they were out of sight, and then he called
to me, and, pointing to the thing, said,

&quot;Antoine, I want you to help me carry this.&quot;

It was a large black coffin.

&quot;Is it heavy ?&quot; I asked, rather horrified, and raising up one
end.

&quot;Not so heavy as it will soon be,&quot; my master replied in his
fierce voice. &quot;Now then, move on!&quot;

While he spoke he had lifted up the other end, and there we both
stood in the dark night, with that hideous thing on our shoulders.

As we walked home, more slowly than we had come on account of our
burden, fearful thoughts filled my mind. What could monsieur want a
coffin for? Was there an occupant ready for it, or did he mean to
commit suicide? The last surmise seemed scarcely probable; suicides
seldom trouble themselves with funeral arrangements. When we reached
the château, who should meet us, creeping out of the great salon, but
Ma'amselle Pauline? She carried a candle in her hand, and I shall
never forget her white scared face as she held it up and let its light
fall on the great black coffin.

&quot;What is it for?&quot; she muttered between her clenched teeth. &quot; O
Louis, it is not Paul! Say it is not Paul!&quot;

But Monsieur Louis only lowered the coffin from his shoulder,
and, telling me to carry it up to his room, himself led the way.

Ma'amselle Pauline followed; and then, as we set our load down in
the centre of the polished floor, she dropped into her brother's large
chair, and exclaimed again, &quot;O Louis, say it isn't Paul!&quot;

He took no notice of her, but, taking the candle, knelt down by
the coffin and began examining it carefully, and I did the same. There
were small holes in the lid, and it was deeper than coffins usually
are; whilst at the back there was a large air-hole, carefully
concealed by the fringe of the lid. I began to understand its use, and
so did Ma'amselle Pauline.

&quot;Now then, Antoine, listen to me,&quot; monsieur said, as he looked up
with horrible satisfaction from his examination. &quot;I was not to be
deceived by that kind advice to fly from France. I knew well enough
what would happen; and I would rather face them all here with my sword
in my hand, than be fired at in flight. If I should be arrested by
order of the Convention, I also know my fate. This is what I propose
doing: if strangers come to the château, you must give out that I am
dead, and immediately close the coffin-lid on me and bury me in the
vault in the chapel. If Paul comes with them, you need only place me
in the coffin, and leave him and me to do the rest. You can let me
stay safely in the vault for twelve hours; but after that, Antoine,
Pauline, my blood will be upon your heads. There, now go; leave me
alone, for God's sake!&quot;

&quot;I cannot, I cannot hear of such a dreadful, wicked thing!&quot; Ma'am-
Belle Pauline began, clasping her little white hands entreatingly. &quot;O
Louis, listen to me: hide while there is time-hide!&quot;

&quot;And what hiding-place within ten leagues of the château does not
Paul know?&quot; fiercely interrupted her brother.

&quot;O Louis, he is not so bad!&quot; mademoiselle said piteously. &quot;Only
try, and I will watch, and pray him-&quot;

&quot;Be silent, and go to bed. Do not preach to me; my mind is made
up,&quot; monsieur answered sternly; and then he went out of the room; and
as neither I nor the poor young lady liked to be alone with that
hideous thing, we also went away to another part of the house.

&quot;O, that these awful days were over!&quot; ma'amselle murmured as she
went into her own room.

But they were not over yet; they were only beginning.

The sun rose the next morning as bright and glowing as if it rose
upon Paradise rather than great bloody France reeking like a slaughter-
house. I could scarcely bear to look out on the brightness; still, it
was some comfort to see that in the sunshine the country looked
peaceful and quiet as usual; that between the trees there was no sign
of glittering arms or terrible uniform.

I took a cup of coffee to monsieur's room as early as possible,
but found him occupied in writing, and could not induce him to take
it.

&quot;Keep it for twenty-four hours hence, Antoine,&quot; he said; &quot;I would
dare wager I shall want it then. Remember, Antoine,&quot; he added, &quot;
twelve hours at farthest-for your life remember that!&quot;

Monsieur looked at the black coffin lying at his feet as he
spoke, and I shuddered,

Just then Ma'amselle Pauline called me softly, and when I went to
her, she beckoned me to the window where she was standing.

&quot;Look out to the west, Antoine; do you see anything?&quot; she said,
in a quiet, frightened tune,

I did look, and I saw a faint glittering far away along the
Bourdeaux road.

&quot;Mademoiselle, they are coming!&quot; I said, feeling a great throb at
my heart.

She grasped my hand, and away we both flew to M. Louis's room.

I think he had seen the glittering too, for we found him hastily
arranging his room, shutting the jalousies, and giving it as much as
possible the trim, tidy look of a death-room.

Then with trembling hands we arrayed him in the death-clothes,
placed the coffin on the tressles in the centre of the floor, and him
in it.

He had a small vial in his hand, and as he lay there his face
looked so corpse-like, that I should scarcely have been afraid of M.
Paul himself seeing it. Then, calling in the other young ladies, to
whom mademoiselle had already explained the danger, I left the room to
watch for the approach of the soldiers, and give the alarm whether M.
Paul was with them or not.

I never shall forget the terrible anxiety of that watching. It
seemed as if they would never come, and yet they were moving, moving,
ever moving along the road.

Then I lost sight of them in the pine-wood, and that seemed an
awful moment when I again saw them-yes, absolutely Within the château
grounds.

Was Monsieur Paul with them? I looked attentively. Yes, riding a
little apart from the rest, there he was, not daring to look up with
his traitor-eyes on the home of his ancestors.

I left the window, and flew rather than ran upstairs.

&quot;Monsieur Paul is there!&quot; I exclaimed, rushing into the room, and
then with one hasty glance at the coffin-when I saw the occupant raise
the vial to his lips-I ran downstairs to the courtyard, where the
soldiers were already dismounting from their horses. As the captain
called out for Citoyen Louis Gaule, and the rest began entering the
house, M. Paul beckoned me aside, and whilst he pretended to follow
them, whispered,

&quot;Has he escaped?  God grant that he has!&quot;

&quot;He has, monsieur,&quot; I answered solemnly; &quot;he died not an hour ago
by his own hand. Rest his soul!&quot;

For an instant M. Paul started back in pale consternation; then
he seized my arm, exclaiming,

&quot;This is some trick! Louis is not the man to kill himself.
Confess the truth, Antoine, and I will do what I can to keep up the
deception.&quot;

I was taken aback by his soft sad tone, but I happened to look up
into his evil eyes at the moment--that was sufficient.

&quot;Go and look at him, monsieur,&quot; I replied sadly; &quot;you will not
doubt then. Arid what could he do? it was only a choice of deaths.
Poison is not worse than steel. But go and look at him.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; answered M. Paul in a hard tone.

The old man's voice quivered as he came to thin, and Josette was
obliged to give him another rather large +goutte.+

I shall never forget the sickening terror (he went on presently)
with which I followed the soldiers and that cruel man up the old
staircase to the Baron's room. I have gone through many dangers to
myself since then, but I never remember feeling such an agony of fear
as I did on entering that room, where Ma'amselle Pauline was sitting
like a pale ghost on the floor, and that group of wild-beasts were
crowding round the coffin in the centre. I went to the opposite side
to where M. Paul was standing, and then I peeped over the shoulders of
one of those wretches into the coffin.

I started; there was M. Louis, lying not in that forced stillness
which lie had first assumed, but dead: he could not but be dead, so
white, so utterly still, were his features, so motionless his body, so
breathless, pulseless. And then I looked up into M. Paul's face.

He was regarding the corpse with a gaze that was almost fiendish.
For a whole minute his eye watched the pale face with an intensity of
attention that, had the life-blood been flowing in its uncovered
temples, he must have discovered it. Then he stretched forth his hand
and took up th§ dead man's arm \ and for an instant it lay placidly in
his fingers, and then dropped with a dull lifeless thud on the breast.

After that he turned away, and putting his arm through one of the
officer's, drew him apart, and talked in a low grave tone with him for
some minutes.

Would they be satisfied? Would they go now, and leave us in
peace?

I caught little ma'amselle's eyes for a moment, and they seemed
asking me that.

Then Monsieur Paul and the officer came back to the rest, and the
captain told them that apparently their work was done for them, that
they might go down and rest themselves; and after a few savage words
they went, with their swords clanging down the great staircase,-a
horrid sound; and Monsieur Paul, the captain, mademoiselle, and myself
were left alone with the corpse.

M. Paul went and again bent over the coffin, and he heaved a
great sigh and murmured,

&quot;Poor Louis, if he had only been persuaded! Poor Louis!&quot; and then
the traitor stretched out his hand towards his little sister; but she
shrank away, and hid her face with her cold fingers.

The captain meanwhile had been standing at the window, but he
came back as he heard M. Paul's voice, and taking up the coffin-lid,
said gruffly,

&quot;Come, come, if you want us to help you with this, we must go to
work at once.&quot;

And then M. Paul sighed again, and with a hand that trembled, but
not from grief, took the lid and laid it on the coffin, and then two
of the soldiers were called, and I was sent for tools, and in a
terrible quarter of an hour, monsieur, we had screwed up a living man
in that hideous coffin. As we finished, the captain said quickly,

&quot;Now to the vault, and then to breakfast. You're master here now,
Paul Gaule, and we shall expect good wine;&quot; and then he laughed, and
M. Paul smiled with his lips, but his evil blue eyes remained
anxiously fixed on the coffin.

&quot;Let them dig a grave under the lime-trees,&quot; he said calmly.

&quot;Monsieur!&quot; I exclaimed in terror. &quot;There's the vault in the
chapel. The De Gaules were always buried there.&quot;

&quot;Paul!&quot; murmured the poor young lady.

But he answered, &quot;What, a suicide in the old vault! Let them dig
a grave under the lime-trees.&quot;

&quot;Dig the hard earth under this broiling sun?&quot; laughed the
captain; &quot;why the men would throw him to the dogs first!&quot;

M. Paul turned pale.

&quot;Well, then, to the vault!&quot; he exclaimed. And then the three
soldiers helped me to lift up the coffin, and we bore M. Louis down
out of the house, across the sunny courtyard, to the little chapel,
which had not been opened for many a day; and M. Paul, with his own
hands, helped to lift up the flagstone before the altar, and then, by
the light of a single candle snatched from one of the candelabra, we
lowered Baron Louis de Gaule among the remains of his ancestors. A
living man among the dead !

And there we left him; and as M. Paul put the key of the chapel
into his pocket and came out into the sunshine, he looked round at
everything with a smile.

O monsieur, there were fiends in those days!

All that day, till set of sun, the old château rang with obscene
merriment. The soldiers forced their way into the cellars and larder;
and those who were not lying under the pines dead drunk ransacked the
old château from roof to basement; then they lounged about the great
saloon, smoking, and swearing, and drinking, and singing ribald songs;
or hunted the young ladies from room to room, or insulted us servants;
whilst M. Paul sat at a little table, in the shade there of those
limes, with two or three of them, and sang republican songs; and kept
shouting to me to bring wine, to supply his friends with wine, the
best wine!

It seemed to me as if that great blazing sun would never go down;
and yet the hours were rolling on, and if more than twelve passed
whilst the Baron was in his living tomb, there would be blood on our
heads,-on poor little ma'amselle's, who sat there still on the floor
in the Baron's room, and on mine.

Chaptee V.
THE RESULT.

I cannot tell you the joy of my heart at, an hour before dark,
seeing signs that those drunken wretches were about to depart.  It
wanted but half an hour of the twelve that M. Louis might safely
remain in the vault; and Ma'amselle Pauline, having come down from the
room, stood in the dark shadow cast by the little chapel, waiting for
me.

I counted each minute as it passed, and there they rolled on, and
those wretches still lingered by their horses and wouldn't mount. My
God! that was the most terrible half-hour I have ever passed.

Mademoiselle was standing leaning against the hard wall of the
chapel, and wearying Heaven with her prayers; but Heaven was obdurate.
Ten o'clock struck, and they were still shouting with their drunken
voices in the château grounds.

I grew desperate, and in my desperation a thought flashed across
my mind,-the window over the altar! why not reach my unfortunate
master by that ? I fetched a flask of brandy, some tools, and a small
pistol, and then, accompanied by my young lady, I crept quietly round
to the back of the chapel.

There was a tree growing tolerably near; with a little exertion I
soon reached the window.

&quot;Holy Mary grant you may not be too late!&quot; whispered
mademoiselle. And then I opened the window gently, and let myself down
on to the ground behind the altar.

I was not nervous naturally; but still, there was something
awful in going down among the dead to wake up the living; and a cold
sweat ran down my face as I moved gently towards the altar to get a
candle before descending into the vault. But, to my surprise, the
flagstone lying on the altar-steps nearly threw me down; and from the
open vault came a faint light. Could the Baron have got out of the
coffin?

Almost numb with a ghastly kind of terror, I reached the edge,
then down a ladder-placed there into the vault. At the farther end,
where the coffin had been deposited, stood a man, stooping down and
watching something. Tools were scattered about, and the lid of the
coffin was standing against the wall. I made no noise. I did not see
the man's face; but I knew it was M. Paul.

&quot;Now,&quot; I thought, &quot;as M. Louis said himself, it is but a question
between their two lives.'' So I raised my pistol, and pointed it at
the stooping figure; just then a. feeble groan echoed through the
vault, and I fired. A maddening' moment followed. I saw a man turn on
me like an enraged beast, and as we closed together in a struggle that
was to be death to one of us, I caught sight of a ghastly face rising
from the coffin.

Then, monsieur, whether I fainted, or became insensible from a
blow, I am not certain, but it was dark for a long time.

I woke up lying on my back in the cool night-air, with the stars
of heaven peeping at me through the trees. Beside me was a tall figure
partially dressed in white, partially naked, busily employed in
digging. The hideous reality came back to me at once. But was it M.
Louis or M. Paul? Which life was gone?

I rose up faintly, and looked around; beside me lay the black
coffin with the lid covering it, and the moonlight was playing on the
white features of the Baron Louis digging in the earth. As I rose up,
M. Louis came up to me.

&quot;We must make haste,&quot; he said, &quot;and bury it out of sight. They'll
be back again before dawn.&quot;

He spoke huskily, and not altogether like a rational being;
whilst his features were awful to look on.

&quot;Where is Monsieur Paul?&quot; I asked in a low voice.

&quot;Dead,&quot; he answered; &quot;in there;&quot; and he pointed to the coffin.
&quot;Come and dig; I tell you they'll be back before dawn.&quot;

And I did dig; and the black coffin lay there beside us.

&quot;Did you kill him?&quot; I asked presently.

&quot;Dig,&quot; said the Baron; &quot; they'll be back, I tell you.&quot;

There was a faint glimmer of dawn in the eastern sky when that
grave was finished, and then I had to go into the chapel for ropes to
lower the coffin into it.
On the altar-steps sat Ma'amselle Pauline.   How she had got there, I
do not know. She did not speak a word as I entered; she did not even
raise her eyes from the gaping vault at her feet, but sat like one in
a trance,

I returned to M. Louis, and together we lowered the coffin into
the grave, and shovelled-in the earth.

&quot;We must make it flat, we must make it-flat!&quot; the Baron shouted
as he jumped into the grave from time to time, and trod down the earth
with his feet. &quot;Flat! flat! that they may not discover it.&quot;

He looked so awful, so fiendish, almost dancing there on his
brother's corpse, that at length I could stand the sight no longer,
and I rushed into the chapel.    The dawn was just struggling in
through the open window, and its light fell on the poor young lady's
bowed head. I went up to her and tried to speak, but my tongue would
not utter a sound; I was dumb as the dead. And there she sat and I
stood, while outside we could hear that husky voice shouting &quot;Flat!
flat!&quot;  Presently-he .came after me, calling my name; and then, as the
gray light fell on his dreadful face and figure, and his sister saw
him, she started up like one awakened from a dead sleep.   &quot;O,&quot; she
exclaimed; &quot;Louis, where is he ?&quot; and then she seemed suddenly to
remember something; she shrieked out, &quot;Buried alive! buried alive!&quot;
and she fell down like a stone at her brother's feet.

And those words of hers, monsieur, brought a terrible fear on me-
one that, as I hope for pardon, never had crossed my mind before.

I staggered like a drunken man, and was about to rush back to the
grave, when the maniac caught hold of me and flung me down into the
vault, and there, as I struggled in the darkness, I heard the
flagstone thrown over it.

(The centenarian paused as he came to this, and stretched out his
trembling hand towards the brandy-bottle.)

The horrors of that night, monsieur, you must think will never
end; and I thought the same. It was terrible to lie there among the
dead, and fancy you could hear the muffled cries of a man reaching you
through a wall of earth. If ever I got out of the place, I knew it
would be too late to save him. The deed was done. It had been a
struggle between their two lives, and Louis had won. I lay there for
hours; it seemed to me ages; and then, to my intense joy, I heard
footsteps overhead, and a gleam of light came struggling down, and a
flood of light-for so it seemed to my eyes wearied from the darkness-
and women's voices called my name.    I contrived to crawl out
somehow, and then I found Mademoiselles Marie and Clotilde, one
holding brandy, and the other bread, and both pale as death.

It was evening, they told me. Their brother Louis had ordered
them to wait until sunset before they released me. He had set off to
Orleans, they believed; at any rate, he was gone; and Pauline was
lying upstairs in a terrible fever, shouting out, &quot;Buried alive!
buried alive!&quot; they supposed in fear for me.

I let them think so.  I knew it was too late to do any good.

I went upstairs, dressed myself, and ate, and put things straight
a little after the drunken revels of the soldiers; and when it was
dark I took my spade and crept out to that dreadful place under the
lime-trees. It was sickening work; and when I came to the black
coffin, I dropped my spade and felt I could do no more.

No sound came from it. I took out my chisel, and set to work to
take the lid off, but it was firmly screwed on, and I had to work hard
for many minutes. At length, it was off, and then, holding my breath
with fear, I looked in.

It was a ghastly sight, monsieur. A face agonised and blackened,
with staring blue eyes, the forehead bruised and battered, and the
teeth clenched, absolutely closing-in the nether lip; hands grasping
each other with such force that one or two fingers were quite crushed.
There was no doubt of what death he had died.

Years and years passed away after that. The old château was
closed, for M. Louis went to Paris and showed that he was as stanch a
republican as M. Paul had been. I followed him; and more than once, as
I have heard of his ferocity and seen his white savage face, I have
felt certain that it was some fiend who took possession of the body of
the Baron when he rose from the dead that night, and that it was not
my old master-bad as he had been-who did that awful deed.

As for tho young ladies, Marie and Clotilde went to Italy, and
took up their abode in some convent; poor little ma'atnselle died of
the fever; and well it was so, for she would have had a cruel life,
haunted by the remembrance of that night.

When times grew more settled, M. Louis, or Baron de Gaule as he
then dared to call himself, went to England, and married an English
lady, the mother of the present Baron, and there he lived till, I
suppose inspired by a love of country, he returned to the château for
a few months' visit, and died suddenly.

He never forgot his promise to me, and not only gave me money
whilst living, but provided for me in his will.

But we rarely met; I think even his heartlessness could not bear
the sight of me. He saw no priest; and I believe the story of that
awful night-of how he got his brother into the coffin, of how he
overpowered him, or even of how he himself contrived to revive from
that deathlike trance--never passed his lips. He died as he had lived-
gloomy and unrepentant. The only allusion he ever made to the past was
on the evening of his death.

&quot;Antoine,&quot; he said, &quot;under my bed you will find the black coffin-
don't bury me in that. Remember, I won't be buried in that-I could not
rest.&quot;

And after his death, to my surprise, I found that coffin, empty
too, under the bed in his room, It looked strangely new, considering
it had been buried in the earth for, I thought, years and years.

How it was, how it got there, what became of the remains of M.
Paul, I cannot tell you. There lies the ugly thing as you saw it,
after having been buried twice, and having twice mysteriously got rid
of its occupant, ready for a third; and a third, monsieur, will soon
be ready for it, or rather, for one of its relations, for, like the
old Baron, I don't believe I could rest in it.

Shall we go into the château, monsieur? The air blows somewhat
keenly.
I rose up rather reluctant to enter the gloomy old place; but old
Antoine put his arm through mine and led me in.

&quot;Those times are passed and gone,&quot; he said; &quot; and thank the good
God they are. Ah, monsieur, if you like to hear stories, I can tell
you many a one of those times, that while you hear shall make you
forget your ennui. I can tell you something about myself which would
make your flesh creep;-tell you how I became the hideous object I am.&quot;

But I thought I had had enough horrors for some time; and I must
confess that instead of reconciling me to my solitude, that story of
the Baron's coffin made me pine after my London home more than ever.
It was with the greatest satisfaction that I received a letter from my
employer, saying that he had changed his mind concerning the
restoration of the old château, and he intended to employ the money in
building a gothic villa on the banks of the Thames instead, of which
he hoped I would immediately set about drawing the plans.

And so, in spite of the shady delicious old pine-woods, and the
sunny blue skies of Gascony, I was very glad to turn my back on the
old château.
