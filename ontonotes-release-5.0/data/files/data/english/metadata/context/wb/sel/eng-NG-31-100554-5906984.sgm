Hi,

I have a Lexus ES300 and took it into a Toyota dealer for a 30,000
mile service. Everything went O.K. there ... well except for the
wheel / tire rotation.

After about a month the weather forecast looked worse so I decided to
put the winter tires onto the car. Tire's 1, 2, and 3 where O.K. But
the Front right one would not budge. I was lusing an 18 inch lug bar
and a 1/2 inch to 3/8 inch converter to step the size down for my 21
mm socket. I was pushing and pusching untill snap, the converter right
where it drops down to 3/8 inches sears right off!

O.K. I think maybe something bad with that tool. Take another down
conversion 1/2inch to 3/8 inch, and after a few expletives and smashed
knucles, it again sheared off. Those idiots at the Toyota dealership,
TOYOTA Mt. Kisco had completely over torqued the bolts.

In the end I managed to get a 21 mm socket with a 1/2 inch drive. Put
it on the wheel and then standing on the breaker bar, pushed it slowly
with my foot until the nut lossened.

If I had to do this at the side of the road it would have been
impossible. Does anyone else have similar experiences with over
torqued wheel nuts?

Needless to say when I put the wheels on I use a torque wrench set to
76 lbs/ft. The proper torque from the Lexus ES300 user manual.

Best, Mike.

I've had that problem and amazing disregard for recommended tire
pressure.  Recently my wife got back from a quick-change place, and
they had put 45 to 63 pounds in tires that were supposed to have 32.

On removing the lug nuts, it helps if you retighten the nuts that are
not stuck.  This relieves some of the tension on the one that's
stuck.

Happens just about every time I have new tires put on. Lug nut torque
and air pressure are all over the place. First thing I do is check
tire pressure and torque. Both are then corrected to spec.

Buy your tires at Sam's Club.

They use a torque wrench on the wheel nuts and they do a good job
of matching the tire pressure.

Plus....included in the price is lifetime rotation and balance....

Actually I did twice at Sam's club and yes I agree they do a great
job. However I got the tires rotated when I had the car service done
at the dealer ... *sigh*
