&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was
a
&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same
thing
&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie
drink,
&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID
struggle
&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

"/> This is obvious with my kids (2 &amp;3 years old). I let them have a small
soda each from the drive through this afternoon (we're in Australia and
it was very hot) and they ate a bowl of grapes between them while they
were watching Nick jr this afternoon. They both ate about 2 bites of
chicken each for dinner and then they were done. We went for a long
walk after dinner (about an hour) and they had a popsicle each on the
way home. Although they ate poorly this afternoon/evening, their entire
calorie intake for this time would have been about the same as if they
had eaten no snack and a full, normal dinner. In line with this, if
they have airport McDonalds for breakfast, they are pretty much done for
the day, minus fruit snacks and drinks. If I had a McDonalds breakfast
there is no way my hunger mechanism would turn off for the entire day.
Obviously, their calorie counter works and mine does not. Somehow, I
think I got trained out of listening to mine.

"/> Cadie. I think there is very strong support for this as a possible cause of
some cases of obesity. I have read of some cases of parasites causing weight
gain. And in some cases parasites can cause weight loss.

For example there is a parasite, a worm actually, that penetrates the skin
and causes what I believe is called elephant legs. The legs swell up and
become fat and look like the legs of an elephant. I believe viruses are
forms of parasites that create inbalances in endocrine and other bodily
functions. I also think that it may be combination of factors including
possibly a virus along with chemical toxins or other toxins, along with how
these things interact with the genetic makeup of a family. I believe this is
why sometimes it appears that a family may all be obese and people to think
it is merely genetics.

I never knew Al Roker had gastric bypass surgery - maybe that explains why
he looks so bad. This has nothing to do with Roker but awhile back I read a
article about a unofficial &quot;support&quot; group in NYC and they would get
together and come up with new tricks to enable themselves to consume more
food even though they have had gastric bypass surgery. Stuff like that just

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;420-Pound Teen to Get Free Gastric Bypass

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors and Hospital Offer Free Gastric Bypass Surgery for 420-Pound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Teenager
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Associated Press

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HOUSTON Oct. 14, 2004 - Two doctors and a hospital offered a free gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center canceled the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure because his insurance would not pay for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors at Obesity Surgery Specialists said 16-year-old Brandon Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;needs the operation for a chance at a healthy life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon is often sent home from school because of high blood pressure and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an elevated heart rate, and he is too big to be allowed on rides at Six
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Flags Astroworld.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chronicle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the procedure will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;performed at Houston Community Hospital, which is also donating its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;services, said Laurie Cantrell, bariatric program director at Obesity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$25,000,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors create an egg-sized pouch in the upper stomach and attach it to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;section of intestine, reducing how much food patients can eat. Risks of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgery include malnutrition, stomach problems, infections and, rarely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful procedures by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie Wilson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity Surgery Specialists has performed about 230 gastric bypasses in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last two years, though none were on adolescents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon's father, Michael Bennett, said he has confidence in a surgical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;team experienced in adult surgery because his son, who is 6-foot-2, has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;physiology of a grown man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I can't believe this is finally going to happen,&quot; Michael Bennett said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating habits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are obese.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt; The feedback loop available is the scale, and the fit of one's clothes.

&gt;I'm talking about the internal, involuntary feedback mechanism -- the
&gt;one that works without you doing anything, that in some people
&gt;automatically tells them how much to eat to maintain a healthy weight.

"/> I know you are, but *I'm* talking about that carbon-based computer we're all
blessed to carry within our skulls. That provides some other feedback
mechanisms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt;&gt;struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt;&gt;shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt;&gt;others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie drink,
&gt;&gt;&gt;they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt;with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt;&gt;which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt;&gt;for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;&gt; Caloric needs to vary due to differences in metabolism. I'm one of those who
&gt;&gt; have struggled with weight, too. But it makes no more sense to point to
&gt;&gt; those
&gt;&gt; with highter caloric needs with envy than it does for me to resent short
&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt; because their clothes are cheaper.

&gt;But this wasn't about who ate more calories -- it was about the fact
&gt;that those who did not struggle with their weight seemed to have an
&gt;internal mechanism that let them know when they'd had enough. In
&gt;others, that doesn't seem to work -- they ate the same number of
&gt;calories for lunch regardless of the calories they'd had in the shake.

"/> OK, fine. But so what?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; There are also varying responses to carbohydrates. The medical profession
&gt;&gt;hasn't helped much in chasing the low-fat altar, blinders only allowing focus
&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt; cardio-vascular concerns (but, hey, it's just that it's the biggest killer)
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; promoting diets which dont' work for many. I'm insulin-resistant and
&gt;&gt; hypoglycemic myself since I was a teen, and figured out that I need a
&gt;&gt; *balanced*, not low-fat, diet fairly early on. Because the shakes in my hand
&gt;&gt; and the aches in my head told me so. And some doctors told me so.

&gt;&gt; But there is also the opulent Western expectation that every urge demands
&gt;&gt; satiation NOW. Why is a hungry feeling to be such an excuse for the result
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; its constant gratification? Surely that isn't stated as such an axiom for
&gt;&gt; sexual desire. Not by anyone responsible.

&gt;Well, I don't know anyone who is horny ALL the time...

"/> You don't??

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Plus, satsifying that urge in public is not usually considered
&gt;acceptable.

&gt;And you CAN get by without sex -- but getting by without food is
&gt;impossible, so

"/> One can get by without so much food as one wants for satiation and entertainment
value.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Well, it's just different.

"/> Not really.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Furthermore, we have fallen into a culture of eating for recreation, and
&gt;&gt; eating
&gt;&gt; at any gathering or un-entertained moment. Snacking. When I served on the
&gt;&gt; committe of a Cub Scout pack, it was a battle to serve only water to 6 - 11
&gt;&gt; year
&gt;&gt; old boys at a two-hour once-a-month 7:00 pm pack meeting. Oh, but where
&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt; are kids and people hanging around, there have to be COOKIES and KOOL-AID!
&gt;&gt; No??
&gt;&gt; Incomprehensible! A glance at those who on the committee resisted the Evil
&gt;&gt; Removal of the Cookies is pretty instructive on who is obese in our society,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; why.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a day
&gt;&gt;&gt;too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt;&gt;&gt;for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt;&gt;&gt;hungry?

&gt;&gt;&gt;It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt;&gt;&gt;simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt;&gt;&gt;is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt;&gt;&gt;modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number of
&gt;&gt;&gt;people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and others
&gt;&gt;&gt;who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt;&gt; I know men who don't lose their hair, too. How unfair to the rest of the
&gt;&gt; guys.

&gt;&gt; Yes, some of us can't eat recreationally. There were times we'd be the
&gt;&gt; survivors, or at least grateful that what we could scrap together for the
&gt;&gt; table
&gt;&gt; sustained us. This is an attitude of an opulent society, this jealousy of
&gt;&gt; those
&gt;&gt; with higher caloric needs.

&gt;Do I sound jealous of people who can eat a lot without getting fat? I'm
&gt;not. This isn't about how much I can eat -- it's about never being
&gt;satisfied, which is different.

"/> Yes, you do. MOST of the people talking about their weight do, don't take it
personally. :-)

But, look at thsi thread. Insteead of talking about what kind of life one leads
to a healthy, maintained weight, it's all about what the OOOOTHERR guy can eat
and not gain weight. What do you call that? It's either jealousy, excusifying,
or both.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;I WAS jealous of people who weren't hungry all the time -- who were not
&gt;fighting a constant battle.

&gt;I'm not any more.

&gt;Until I started eating this way, I'm not sure I believed that it was
&gt;possible to be satisfied with a reasonable amount of food, to not have
&gt;constant cravings for more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was right:
&gt;&gt;&gt;since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt;&gt;&gt;being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt;&gt;&gt;but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal, low-fat
&gt;&gt;&gt;stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt;&gt;&gt;assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt;&gt;&gt;that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt;&gt;&gt;mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.

&gt;&gt; I think the Atkins diet is on to something. But, typically of our society,
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; pendulum has swung, and we've gone whole-hog in the other direction. But,
&gt;&gt; like
&gt;&gt; you I think, I'm glad that the science has progressed, and look forward
&gt;&gt; hopefully to some sanity in the area of nutrition and diet recommendations.

&gt;&gt; But to blame All That Came Before Atkins for one's problems isn't quite
&gt;&gt; honest
&gt;&gt; to oneself, either.

&gt;OK -- I'm not perfect, and didn't exercise enough, and probably have
&gt;lots of other faults, too.

&gt;My point is that the sort of sanctamoneous &quot;it's just about self
&gt;control&quot; attitude that some folks have about obesity annoys the heck
&gt;out of me.

&gt;Weight is an incredibly complex issue -- and the more research that is
&gt;done, the more complexity seems to be revealed.

"/> It's not *just* about self control. But it's not about &quot;this is just how I am I
can't help it&quot;, either.

It's fundamentally a behavioral problem. Research into behavior problems are
finding complexity. But that does not mean individuals don't have
responsibility.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Since, I'm bored, I'll type out the &quot;article&quot; in my book about it. It does
&gt;admit that no one else is really convinced, but for me at least, it opens
&gt;another door into the causes of obesity...

&gt; It's far out, to be sure, but as of 1997, University of Wisconsin
&gt;researchers have linked a virus to obesity. And, they maintain, it may be
&gt;possible one day to eliminate the virus and slim down quickly by taking an
&gt;antiviral antibiotic.
&gt; The road to this starling conclusion becan in 1990 with a veterinarian's
&gt;chance remark that chickens infected with adenoviruses gain considerable
&gt;weight. The conversation took place in Bombay, India, where Nikhil V.
&gt;Dhurandhar, a nutritionist, was on his way to WIsconsin to do research. The
&gt;veterinarian's observation was intriguing, and Dhurandhar resolved to pursue
&gt;it.
&gt; At the medical school in Wisconsin, the fledgling researcher obtained a
&gt;lock of chickens and a culture of adenoviruses (respriatory viruses often
&gt;involved in the common cold). He soon confirmed that in chickens, the
&gt;viruses are pathogenic and bring on rapidmortality --- but not before the
&gt;chickens become unusually obese, just as the vet had said.
&gt; But did it work that way with people? Dhurandhar solicited volunteers
&gt;and got responses from 45 lean individuals and 154 obese people, each
&gt;weighing over 250 pounds. The investigator was working with adenovirus
&gt;strain 36 (AD-36) and antibodies against the virus would prove that it was
&gt;currently in the body or that it had once been there. Dhurandhar took blood
&gt;samples and analyzed them: 5 percent of the lean individuals had AD-36
&gt;antibodies, but 30 percent of the obese people had the telltale antibodies.
&gt; Dhurandhar, now a scientist at Wayne State University, also looked at a
&gt;pair of identical twins who had about the same weight before they went to
&gt;college. One twin gained considerable weight while the other did not.
&gt;Blood tests indicated the twin that gained weight had the AD-36 antibodies.
&gt; Despite Dr. Dhurandhar's determination to prove his theory, most experts
&gt;are not convinced. Most agree that lifestyle and eating habits are what
&gt;counts. Over eating is a complex disorder though and Dhurandhar believes
&gt;the virus may be important in some cases of obesity.
&gt; In the early 1980's, few people were willing to believe that gastric
&gt;ulcers are related to a bacterium, but the relationship is now an accepted
&gt;tenet of medicine. Linking obesity to a virus may seem like a stretch.
&gt;Stil....

"/> Since you're writing a book, you would have the original reference to this
study, published in a refereed, archival journal - right? So post it here,

The other question is - has this result been reproduced.

&gt; it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obesity though, I'm not sure how much she does weigh). There's gotta
&gt; be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different reason for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cadie. I think there is very strong support for this as a possible cause
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; some cases of obesity.

&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read of some cases of parasites causing weight gain.

&gt;&gt; Thats rare and easy to work out if those parasites are involved.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And in some cases parasites can cause weight loss.

&gt;&gt; In the bulk of cases where parasites have an effect on weight, actually.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For example there is a parasite, a worm actually, that penetrates the
&gt; skin and
&gt;&gt;&gt; causes what I believe is called elephant legs. The legs swell up and
&gt; become
&gt;&gt;&gt; fat and look like the legs of an elephant.

&gt;&gt; And its easy to check if that particular parasite is involved.

&gt;&gt; And it isnt in modern first world countrys.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe viruses are forms of parasites

&gt;&gt; Nope, completely different.

&gt;&gt;&gt; that create inbalances in endocrine and other bodily functions.

&gt;&gt; And there aint a shred of rigorous scientific evidence
&gt;&gt; to support that particular silly belief with obesity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I also think that it may be combination of factors including possibly a
&gt; virus
&gt;&gt;&gt; along with chemical toxins or other toxins,

&gt;&gt; Mindless stuff.

&gt;&gt;&gt; along with how these things interact with the genetic makeup of a
&gt; family.

&gt;&gt; And there aint a shred of rigorous scientific evidence

&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe this is why sometimes it appears that a family may all be

&gt; Sure; but if you don't have sex for a month, you won't die. If you

&gt; eat when hungry - it's the normal expectation of every living
&gt; creature, because otherwise it won't remain alive for long.

&gt; In fact, I would argue that *not* eating when hungry slows down your
&gt; metabolism and causes you to gain weight later. Your body knows how
&gt; much energy you need. If you ignore its signals, however, you will
&gt; give it too little or too much - and it will hoard that extra energy
&gt; for future starvation.

&gt; I am of slim-to-average size (size 6 or so). My roommate is seriously
&gt; overweight. Our lifestyles are not much different, we are fairly
&gt; similar people, with one major difference - my roommate cannot,
&gt; physically, recognize when she's hungry. If she misses lunch, it
&gt; doesn't bother her any. She forgets to eat, sometimes. If I miss
&gt; lunch, I feel like I'm starving to death, and my first priority
&gt; becomes getting something to eat. I can't &quot;forget&quot; to eat - my body
&gt; would remind me. I think this is why my roommate is overweight, and I
&gt; am not - I listen to my body and she does not.

&gt;You guys are really lacking in imagination if you cannot conceive of a
&gt;virus that would somehow intefere with normal metabolism to such an
&gt;extent that, without changing your eating habits, you would become obese.

"/> IMPOSSIBLE! ~ 2nd Law of Thermodynamics!

All living things (viruses are not living by the way) obtain energy
from some external source.

Plants, containing chlorophyll use the sun as ENERGY to build
cellulose, carbohydrates, etc., from CO2 and H2O.

Animals, lacking chlorophyll, engulf carbohydrates, proteins, fats,
and break them down to obtain energy. Other times, the CHOs are stored
as fat.

VIRUSES, by definition cannot do either!

&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot; --
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I bet that 420lb monster ate like a bird and ran marathons

&gt; A 420lb 6'2&quot; 16 year old. Lets say about 220 excess pounds gained
&gt; over 14 years. That is about 170 excess calories per day. Looks like
&gt; you're right, gluttony is the only possible explanation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a theory that some cases of obesity are caused by a virus
&gt;&gt;A virus that creates energy out of nowhere? Someone tell Stephen
&gt;&gt;Hawking he might be interested!

&gt; No, a virus that interferes, possibly only slightly, with one or more
&gt; of the bodies built-in feedback loops that regulate energy intake or
&gt; expenditure.

&gt; (While the viral cause is interesting and may be a partial explanation,
&gt; I'm not directly addressing it in the remainder of this article.)

&gt; With no conscious effort at all, many people maintain a near perfect
&gt; balance between calories consumed and calories expended. This isn't
&gt; out of some uncannily accurate sense for how many calories were in their
&gt; sandwich, or how many calories they burned walking in from the parking
&gt; lot. The body has some way of keeping caloric input and output in
&gt; balance.

&gt; For some, the balancing mechanism is slightly out of whack. Being off
&gt; by only 2% is &gt;4 pounds/yr.

&gt; An extra apple a day is small enough to be imperceptible to most diets,
&gt; yet it works out to about 10 pounds of added fat per year based on
&gt; excess calories. But very few people could actually manage to gain 10
&gt; pounds a year by just eating an extra apple a day. Without trying,
&gt; their bodies would automatically adjust. Perhaps they would just eat
&gt; less at other times, perhaps they would be a little more active; but
&gt; much of it would happen without any effort or willpower.

&gt; If you're someone who was able to maintain a stable weight before, an
&gt; apple a day probably won't change that. Even if your weight has been
&gt; going up you'll likely only gain a small portion of the &quot;expected&quot; 10
&gt; pounds since your body still regulates calories in and out, it just
&gt; does so imperfectly.

&gt;&gt;[someone else re: the efficacy of concentration camps in weightloss]

&gt; Just because obesity can be controlled via behavior, that doesn't mean
&gt; it is primarily a behavioral problem or that behavioral modification
&gt; is the best approach to treating it. If there is something wrong with
&gt; your body it isn't unreasonable to want to be able to correct it, rather
&gt; than just trying to work around the problem for the rest of your life.

&gt; I found the article &quot;Fat mice, eating machines, and biochemical treason&quot;
&gt; by Richard A. Lovett, Ph.D. in the November 2004 issue of Analog very
&gt; interesting (Analog is mainly Science Fiction but also has one &quot;Science
&gt; Fact&quot; article per month, usually dealing with current research). I'd
&gt; always felt that the biochemical excuse for obesity was largely wishful
&gt; thinking, but the research this article cites has me thinking there
&gt; really is something to it.

"/> That's the article I was trying to refer to -- but DH has that copy of
Analog at work, so I couldn't find the title or author! Thanks.

It really was eye opening.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt;&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt;&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt;&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same
&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie
&gt;&gt; drink,
&gt;&gt;&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID
&gt;&gt; struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt;&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt;&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;&gt; This is obvious with my kids (2 &amp;3 years old). I let them have a small
&gt;&gt; soda each from the drive through this afternoon (we're in Australia and
&gt;&gt; it was very hot) and they ate a bowl of grapes between them while they
&gt;&gt; were watching Nick jr this afternoon. They both ate about 2 bites of
&gt;&gt; chicken each for dinner and then they were done. We went for a long
&gt;&gt; walk after dinner (about an hour) and they had a popsicle each on the
&gt;&gt; way home. Although they ate poorly this afternoon/evening, their entire
&gt;&gt; calorie intake for this time would have been about the same as if they
&gt;&gt; had eaten no snack and a full, normal dinner. In line with this, if
&gt;&gt; they have airport McDonalds for breakfast, they are pretty much done for
&gt;&gt; the day, minus fruit snacks and drinks. If I had a McDonalds breakfast
&gt;&gt; there is no way my hunger mechanism would turn off for the entire day.
&gt;&gt; Obviously, their calorie counter works and mine does not. Somehow, I
&gt;&gt; think I got trained out of listening to mine.

I could get up from a large meal and half an hour later be starving. It
seemed to have nothing to do with whether my STOMACH was full -- in
fact, I could be uncomfortable, and still feel hungry. (I know now that
that was most likely to happen if I ate a carb-heavy meal -- pancakes

out my body was telling me to eat because of the way insulin behaves in
me, NOT because I really needed the calories.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt;&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt;&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt;&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same
&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie
&gt;&gt; drink,
&gt;&gt;&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID
&gt;&gt; struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt;&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt;&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;&gt; This is obvious with my kids (2 &amp;3 years old). I let them have a small
&gt;&gt; soda each from the drive through this afternoon (we're in Australia and
&gt;&gt; it was very hot) and they ate a bowl of grapes between them while they
&gt;&gt; were watching Nick jr this afternoon. They both ate about 2 bites of
&gt;&gt; chicken each for dinner and then they were done. We went for a long
&gt;&gt; walk after dinner (about an hour) and they had a popsicle each on the
&gt;&gt; way home. Although they ate poorly this afternoon/evening, their entire
&gt;&gt; calorie intake for this time would have been about the same as if they
&gt;&gt; had eaten no snack and a full, normal dinner. In line with this, if
&gt;&gt; they have airport McDonalds for breakfast, they are pretty much done for
&gt;&gt; the day, minus fruit snacks and drinks. If I had a McDonalds breakfast
&gt;&gt; there is no way my hunger mechanism would turn off for the entire day.
&gt;&gt; Obviously, their calorie counter works and mine does not. Somehow, I
&gt;&gt; think I got trained out of listening to mine.

&gt;&gt;420-Pound Teen to Get Free Gastric Bypass

&gt;&gt;Doctors and Hospital Offer Free Gastric Bypass Surgery for 420-Pound
&gt;&gt;Teenager
&gt;&gt;The Associated Press

&gt;&gt;HOUSTON Oct. 14, 2004 - Two doctors and a hospital offered a free gastric
&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center canceled the
&gt;&gt;procedure because his insurance would not pay for it.

&gt;&gt;Doctors at Obesity Surgery Specialists said 16-year-old Brandon Bennett
&gt;&gt;needs the operation for a chance at a healthy life.

&gt;&gt;Brandon is often sent home from school because of high blood pressure and
&gt;&gt;an elevated heart rate, and he is too big to be allowed on rides at Six
&gt;&gt;Flags Astroworld.

&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital in
Houston
&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
Chronicle
&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his family
&gt;&gt;this week.

&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the procedure will
be
&gt;&gt;performed at Houston Community Hospital, which is also donating its
&gt;&gt;services, said Laurie Cantrell, bariatric program director at Obesity
&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
$25,000,
&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;Doctors create an egg-sized pouch in the upper stomach and attach it to a
&gt;&gt;section of intestine, reducing how much food patients can eat. Risks of
&gt;&gt;surgery include malnutrition, stomach problems, infections and, rarely,
&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful procedures by
&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie Wilson.

&gt;&gt;Obesity Surgery Specialists has performed about 230 gastric bypasses in
the
&gt;&gt;last two years, though none were on adolescents.

&gt;&gt;Brandon's father, Michael Bennett, said he has confidence in a surgical
&gt;&gt;team experienced in adult surgery because his son, who is 6-foot-2, has
the
&gt;&gt;physiology of a grown man.

&gt;&gt;&quot;I can't believe this is finally going to happen,&quot; Michael Bennett said.
&quot;I
&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating habits
&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are obese.
&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

"/> But you know better than that - right? And the other living creatures are
either expending energy or getting fat too. Culture is what we have over
instinct. Our culture tells us not to indulge in sexual desires whenever we
want (but tells us it's OK to indulge with a recognized mate). Our culture
isnt' telling us not to eat whenever we want. Even though *that* may kill us.

You aren't arguing that, since we must eat, we must totally eat what we want all
the time, I hope.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;In fact, I would argue that *not* eating when hungry slows down your
&gt;metabolism and causes you to gain weight later. Your body knows how
&gt;much energy you need. If you ignore its signals, however, you will
&gt;give it too little or too much - and it will hoard that extra energy
&gt;for future starvation.

&gt;I am of slim-to-average size (size 6 or so). My roommate is seriously
&gt;overweight. Our lifestyles are not much different, we are fairly
&gt;similar people, with one major difference - my roommate cannot,
&gt;physically, recognize when she's hungry. If she misses lunch, it
&gt;doesn't bother her any. She forgets to eat, sometimes. If I miss
&gt;lunch, I feel like I'm starving to death, and my first priority
&gt;becomes getting something to eat. I can't &quot;forget&quot; to eat - my body
&gt;would remind me. I think this is why my roommate is overweight, and I
&gt;am not - I listen to my body and she does not.

"/> I'm tired of reading these &quot;but they OTHER guy eat as much as I do that's why
it's not MY fault I'm fat&quot; statements, even from the 'other guy'. A pinch of
the waistband tells us what we as individuals can do. We may have to do
different things, but if your roomie is very fat, she's doing the wrong things.
Maybe she needs to build a routine for herself. But this &quot;I'm different that's
why I'm fat&quot; excuse just doesn't fly.

&gt;&gt;My body tells me to eat all the time. I'm always hungry. I used to be

&gt;&gt;pounds. My dh eats food just so he doesn't keel over. He is apparenlty
&gt;&gt;never hungry. He's also quite thin. It isn't from overly healthy food. He
&gt;&gt;loves McDonalds and I haven't seen him eat a peice of fruit in the over 10
&gt;&gt;years I've known him. He eats a tiny amount and quits. I have to actually
&gt;&gt;leave the table or I just want to keep eating because it all tastes so good.

&gt;&gt;I just need to start some kind of excercise program because not eating when
&gt;&gt;I'm hungry makes me cranky!

&gt;&gt;Nikki

&gt; My body tells me to eat frequently, and feels sick if I go much over 4 hours
&gt; without eating.

&gt; So I eat small amounts each time.

&gt; It's that people expect that a certain amount of food is &quot;reasonable&quot;, or
&gt; expect
&gt; to eat to satiation each time, that gets them into trouble.

&gt;&gt;You guys are really lacking in imagination if you cannot conceive of a
&gt;&gt;virus that would somehow intefere with normal metabolism to such an
&gt;&gt;extent that, without changing your eating habits, you would become obese.

&gt; My dad (actually it was due to my mom) bred mice that were fat (and
&gt; also had diabetes). They weren't like the Bar Harbor fat mice which
&gt; had loose flabby fat. These were dense pear shaped mice. They ate
&gt; all the time (I did a Skinner box experiment with them to record their
&gt; eating habits when I was in college).

&gt; The fact that this was an obese strain that my mom developed while
&gt; trying to get a pretty black and white mouse was discovered when three
&gt; weeks in a row one of the mice was marked as pg, and then it was
&gt; discovered it was a male.

&gt; If these mice were put under stress (like if they became dehydrated)
&gt; they became tailbiters - that is they were continually biting each
&gt; other on the tail and they lost weight.

&gt; He did also have a strain of cancer susceptible mice which he
&gt; suspected might have a viral element to it. And ulcers have been
&gt; found to be due to viruses. So a virus that acts on the pituitary in
&gt; the brain by some mechanism isn't completely out of the question.

&gt; I do not think that anyone knows everything there is to know about
&gt; weight control. It's not as simple as that.

&gt; grandma Rosalie

"/> INteresting experiment. Bout all I have to say there :-)

I wouldn't doubt that the cancer susceptible mice was due to a virus, since
a decent percentage of cancers are caused by viruses (something I found
interesting, and didn't know before this class). but ulcers are due to
bacteria, not viruses, or at least, that I know of. Heliobacter pylori,
responsible for 90% of duodenal ulcers, and 80% of peptic ulcers.

*grin* sorry, odd that my favorite class so far is on
bacteria/viruses/fungi, but I guess I kind of enjoy knowing something that
can actually be related to the real world LOL

&gt;&gt;Since, I'm bored, I'll type out the &quot;article&quot; in my book about it. It
does
&gt;&gt;admit that no one else is really convinced, but for me at least, it opens
&gt;&gt;another door into the causes of obesity...

&gt;&gt; It's far out, to be sure, but as of 1997, University of Wisconsin
&gt;&gt;researchers have linked a virus to obesity. And, they maintain, it may
be
&gt;&gt;possible one day to eliminate the virus and slim down quickly by taking
an
&gt;&gt;antiviral antibiotic.
&gt;&gt; The road to this starling conclusion becan in 1990 with a
veterinarian's
&gt;&gt;chance remark that chickens infected with adenoviruses gain considerable
&gt;&gt;weight. The conversation took place in Bombay, India, where Nikhil V.
&gt;&gt;Dhurandhar, a nutritionist, was on his way to WIsconsin to do research.
The
&gt;&gt;veterinarian's observation was intriguing, and Dhurandhar resolved to
pursue
&gt;&gt;it.
&gt;&gt; At the medical school in Wisconsin, the fledgling researcher obtained
a
&gt;&gt;lock of chickens and a culture of adenoviruses (respriatory viruses often
&gt;&gt;involved in the common cold). He soon confirmed that in chickens, the
&gt;&gt;viruses are pathogenic and bring on rapidmortality --- but not before the
&gt;&gt;chickens become unusually obese, just as the vet had said.
&gt;&gt; But did it work that way with people? Dhurandhar solicited
volunteers
&gt;&gt;and got responses from 45 lean individuals and 154 obese people, each
&gt;&gt;weighing over 250 pounds. The investigator was working with adenovirus
&gt;&gt;strain 36 (AD-36) and antibodies against the virus would prove that it
was
&gt;&gt;currently in the body or that it had once been there. Dhurandhar took
blood
&gt;&gt;samples and analyzed them: 5 percent of the lean individuals had AD-36
&gt;&gt;antibodies, but 30 percent of the obese people had the telltale
antibodies.
&gt;&gt; Dhurandhar, now a scientist at Wayne State University, also looked at
a
&gt;&gt;pair of identical twins who had about the same weight before they went to
&gt;&gt;college. One twin gained considerable weight while the other did not.
&gt;&gt;Blood tests indicated the twin that gained weight had the AD-36
antibodies.
&gt;&gt; Despite Dr. Dhurandhar's determination to prove his theory, most
experts
&gt;&gt;are not convinced. Most agree that lifestyle and eating habits are what
&gt;&gt;counts. Over eating is a complex disorder though and Dhurandhar believes
&gt;&gt;the virus may be important in some cases of obesity.
&gt;&gt; In the early 1980's, few people were willing to believe that gastric
&gt;&gt;ulcers are related to a bacterium, but the relationship is now an
accepted
&gt;&gt;tenet of medicine. Linking obesity to a virus may seem like a stretch.
&gt;&gt;Stil....

&gt; Since you're writing a book, you would have the original reference to this
&gt; study, published in a refereed, archival journal - right? So post it
here,
&gt; folks here can check it out.

&gt; The other question is - has this result been reproduced.

&gt; Banty

"/> I'm not writing a book. I think there's been confusion. It's in my text
book, my microbiology text book, I'm a nursing student. It doesn't give a
reference for that information, but it's from Alcamo's Fundamentals of
Microbiology 7th edition, not that that will probably make a difference.

It's not *my* information, I just read it, so I mentioned it since it was
interesting to me. Sorry for the confusion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; dragonlady says...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The feedback loop available is the scale, and the fit of one's clothes.

&gt;&gt;I'm talking about the internal, involuntary feedback mechanism -- the
&gt;&gt;one that works without you doing anything, that in some people
&gt;&gt;automatically tells them how much to eat to maintain a healthy weight.

&gt; I know you are, but *I'm* talking about that carbon-based computer we're all
&gt; blessed to carry within our skulls. That provides some other feedback
&gt; mechanisms.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie drink,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Caloric needs to vary due to differences in metabolism. I'm one of those
&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt; have struggled with weight, too. But it makes no more sense to point to
&gt;&gt;&gt; those
&gt;&gt;&gt; with highter caloric needs with envy than it does for me to resent short
&gt;&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt;&gt; because their clothes are cheaper.

&gt;&gt;But this wasn't about who ate more calories -- it was about the fact
&gt;&gt;that those who did not struggle with their weight seemed to have an
&gt;&gt;internal mechanism that let them know when they'd had enough. In
&gt;&gt;others, that doesn't seem to work -- they ate the same number of
&gt;&gt;calories for lunch regardless of the calories they'd had in the shake.

&gt; OK, fine. But so what?

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are also varying responses to carbohydrates. The medical profession
&gt;&gt;&gt;hasn't helped much in chasing the low-fat altar, blinders only allowing
&gt;&gt;&gt;focus
&gt;&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt; cardio-vascular concerns (but, hey, it's just that it's the biggest
&gt;&gt;&gt; killer)
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; promoting diets which dont' work for many. I'm insulin-resistant and
&gt;&gt;&gt; hypoglycemic myself since I was a teen, and figured out that I need a
&gt;&gt;&gt; *balanced*, not low-fat, diet fairly early on. Because the shakes in my
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the aches in my head told me so. And some doctors told me so.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But there is also the opulent Western expectation that every urge demands
&gt;&gt;&gt; satiation NOW. Why is a hungry feeling to be such an excuse for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; result
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; its constant gratification? Surely that isn't stated as such an axiom for
&gt;&gt;&gt; sexual desire. Not by anyone responsible.

&gt;&gt;Well, I don't know anyone who is horny ALL the time...

&gt; You don't??

&gt;&gt;Plus, satsifying that urge in public is not usually considered
&gt;&gt;acceptable.

&gt;&gt;And you CAN get by without sex -- but getting by without food is
&gt;&gt;impossible, so

&gt; One can get by without so much food as one wants for satiation and
&gt; entertainment
&gt; value.

&gt;&gt;Well, it's just different.

&gt; Not really.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Furthermore, we have fallen into a culture of eating for recreation, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; eating
&gt;&gt;&gt; at any gathering or un-entertained moment. Snacking. When I served on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; committe of a Cub Scout pack, it was a battle to serve only water to 6 -
&gt;&gt;&gt; 11
&gt;&gt;&gt; year
&gt;&gt;&gt; old boys at a two-hour once-a-month 7:00 pm pack meeting. Oh, but where
&gt;&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt;&gt; are kids and people hanging around, there have to be COOKIES and KOOL-AID!

&gt;&gt;&gt; No??
&gt;&gt;&gt; Incomprehensible! A glance at those who on the committee resisted the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Evil
&gt;&gt;&gt; Removal of the Cookies is pretty instructive on who is obese in our
&gt;&gt;&gt; society,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; why.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a day
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hungry?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know men who don't lose their hair, too. How unfair to the rest of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; guys.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, some of us can't eat recreationally. There were times we'd be the
&gt;&gt;&gt; survivors, or at least grateful that what we could scrap together for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; table
&gt;&gt;&gt; sustained us. This is an attitude of an opulent society, this jealousy of
&gt;&gt;&gt; those
&gt;&gt;&gt; with higher caloric needs.

&gt;&gt;Do I sound jealous of people who can eat a lot without getting fat? I'm
&gt;&gt;not. This isn't about how much I can eat -- it's about never being
&gt;&gt;satisfied, which is different.

&gt; Yes, you do. MOST of the people talking about their weight do, don't take it
&gt; personally. :-)

&gt; But, look at thsi thread. Insteead of talking about what kind of life one
&gt; leads
&gt; to a healthy, maintained weight, it's all about what the OOOOTHERR guy can
&gt; eat
&gt; and not gain weight. What do you call that? It's either jealousy,
&gt; excusifying,
&gt; or both.

"/> Actually, no I'm not: I'm talking about the fact that I've finally
found out what it feels like to NOT be hungry all the time. I'm not
&quot;excusifying&quot; (great word) -- I am, however, hoping to educate and
perhaps encourage a little more compassion for those of us whose bodies
apparently don't work the way most people's do.

I almost feel guilty over the positive comments I'm getting from people
about my weight loss, like this is some sort of Hard Work. It isn't --
I just eat when I need to. No more cravings, no more feeling constantly
hungry in order to keep from gaining weight. Am I jealous that some
people are able to do this and still have bagels? Not really. I'm
just glad to finally know what THEY felt like all along. Do I sometimes
miss mashed potatos, a bun for my burger, fries, carrots? Sure -- a
little. But I don't have the cravings I used to, and if a plate of
cookies is put in front of me it no longer takes phenominal will to not
eat one (or several).

Until now, losing weight -- or even just not gaining weight -- was
something that took phenominal will and concentration -- it's HARD to be
hungry all the time, and around people who are eating more than you are
and not gaining weight.

Since all it took was a shift in what I was eating -- and a shift that
many people think is just WRONG, since I have a fairly high-fat diet now
-- I feel like I can honestly say that my weight is more a reflection of
an out-of-whack body chemistry than an out-of-whack personality!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;I WAS jealous of people who weren't hungry all the time -- who were not
&gt;&gt;fighting a constant battle.

&gt;&gt;I'm not any more.

&gt;&gt;Until I started eating this way, I'm not sure I believed that it was
&gt;&gt;possible to be satisfied with a reasonable amount of food, to not have
&gt;&gt;constant cravings for more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was right:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal, low-fat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the Atkins diet is on to something. But, typically of our
&gt;&gt;&gt; society,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pendulum has swung, and we've gone whole-hog in the other direction. But,
&gt;&gt;&gt; like
&gt;&gt;&gt; you I think, I'm glad that the science has progressed, and look forward
&gt;&gt;&gt; hopefully to some sanity in the area of nutrition and diet
&gt;&gt;&gt; recommendations.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But to blame All That Came Before Atkins for one's problems isn't quite
&gt;&gt;&gt; honest
&gt;&gt;&gt; to oneself, either.

&gt;&gt;OK -- I'm not perfect, and didn't exercise enough, and probably have
&gt;&gt;lots of other faults, too.

&gt;&gt;My point is that the sort of sanctamoneous &quot;it's just about self
&gt;&gt;control&quot; attitude that some folks have about obesity annoys the heck
&gt;&gt;out of me.

&gt;&gt;Weight is an incredibly complex issue -- and the more research that is
&gt;&gt;done, the more complexity seems to be revealed.

&gt; It's not *just* about self control. But it's not about &quot;this is just how I
&gt; am I

&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not nearly

&gt; Yeah, I bet that 420lb monster ate like a bird and ran marathons every

&gt;&gt; There's a theory that some cases of obesity are caused by a virus

&gt; A virus that creates energy out of nowhere? Someone tell Stephen
&gt; Hawking he might be interested!

&gt;&gt; I also agree that it isn't always just a case of bad eating habits. My
&gt;&gt; sister eats healthy most of the time (junk of course too, she is only 13
:-)
&gt;&gt; And gets tons of excersise, but she's still overweight

&gt; Eating healthily has nothing to do with weight, you can eat too much
&gt; healthy food and gain weight, and lose weight on unhealthy food. More
&gt; than likely, you're sister eats far too much, and doesn't do anywhere
&gt; near as much exercise as she says she does.

"/> No, she doesn't eat that much, and It's not a matter of how much excersise
she *says* she does, it's how much I see her do. She's outside from time
school is out to long after dark (2:30-8 or 9 in the winter) riding her
bike, running down the street, playing soccer, playing basketball. What
she does in one day is more than I do in one week (or rather, probably
before kids, chasing after a toddler is a lot of work in iteself :-), she
does quite a bit.

&gt;A 420lb 6'2&quot; 16 year old. Lets say about 220 excess pounds gained

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;(While the viral cause is interesting and may be a partial explanation,
&gt;I'm not directly addressing it in the remainder of this article.)

&gt;With no conscious effort at all, many people maintain a near perfect
&gt;balance between calories consumed and calories expended. This isn't
&gt;out of some uncannily accurate sense for how many calories were in their
&gt;sandwich, or how many calories they burned walking in from the parking
&gt;lot. The body has some way of keeping caloric input and output in
&gt;balance.

&gt;For some, the balancing mechanism is slightly out of whack. Being off
&gt;by only 2% is &gt;4 pounds/yr.

&gt;An extra apple a day is small enough to be imperceptible to most diets,
&gt;yet it works out to about 10 pounds of added fat per year based on
&gt;excess calories. But very few people could actually manage to gain 10
&gt;pounds a year by just eating an extra apple a day. Without trying,
&gt;their bodies would automatically adjust. Perhaps they would just eat
&gt;less at other times, perhaps they would be a little more active; but
&gt;much of it would happen without any effort or willpower.

&gt;If you're someone who was able to maintain a stable weight before, an
&gt;apple a day probably won't change that. Even if your weight has been
&gt;going up you'll likely only gain a small portion of the &quot;expected&quot; 10
&gt;pounds since your body still regulates calories in and out, it just
&gt;does so imperfectly.

&gt;&gt;[someone else re: the efficacy of concentration camps in weightloss]

&gt;Just because obesity can be controlled via behavior, that doesn't mean
&gt;it is primarily a behavioral problem or that behavioral modification
&gt;is the best approach to treating it. If there is something wrong with
&gt;your body it isn't unreasonable to want to be able to correct it, rather
&gt;than just trying to work around the problem for the rest of your life.

&gt;I found the article &quot;Fat mice, eating machines, and biochemical treason&quot;
&gt;by Richard A. Lovett, Ph.D. in the November 2004 issue of Analog very
&gt;interesting (Analog is mainly Science Fiction but also has one &quot;Science
&gt;Fact&quot; article per month, usually dealing with current research). I'd
&gt;always felt that the biochemical excuse for obesity was largely wishful
&gt;thinking, but the research this article cites has me thinking there
&gt;really is something to it.

"/> Well, let's say, long, long, long neglect, as the kids goes through bigger and
bigger wardrobes, more and more ribbing, and more and more aches and pains.

Really, think about it this way - that's also only 170 calories worth of extra
activity per day.

You talk as if one gains, and gains, helpless and scratching one's head puzzled,
while one gets heavier and heavier until gross obesity. But this is YEARS we're
talking about to get into this condition even if it were based on a small
surplus.

Again - turn it around - it's just 170 calories' worth of activity not partaken
of, every day. For years. While there are undeniable indications that
something is very wrong.

&gt;&gt;You guys are really lacking in imagination if you cannot conceive of a

&gt;&gt;extent that, without changing your eating habits, you would become obese.

&gt; My dad (actually it was due to my mom) bred mice that were fat (and
&gt; also had diabetes). They weren't like the Bar Harbor fat mice which
&gt; had loose flabby fat. These were dense pear shaped mice. They ate
&gt; all the time (I did a Skinner box experiment with them to record their
&gt; eating habits when I was in college).

&gt; The fact that this was an obese strain that my mom developed while
&gt; trying to get a pretty black and white mouse was discovered when three
&gt; weeks in a row one of the mice was marked as pg, and then it was
&gt; discovered it was a male.

&gt; If these mice were put under stress (like if they became dehydrated)
&gt; they became tailbiters - that is they were continually biting each
&gt; other on the tail and they lost weight.

&gt; He did also have a strain of cancer susceptible mice which he
&gt; suspected might have a viral element to it. And ulcers have been
&gt; found to be due to viruses. So a virus that acts on the pituitary in
&gt; the brain by some mechanism isn't completely out of the question.
&gt; I do not think that anyone knows everything there is to
&gt; know about weight control. It's not as simple as that.

"/> We do however know that the spread of obesity is nothing like
what would have been seen if it had actually been due to a virus.

"/> OK -- I did. This is from Medline Plus
:
&quot;Delirium tremens is a disorder involving sudden and severe mental
changes (psychosis) or neurologic changes (including seizures) caused by
abruptly stopping the use of alcohol. Rapid pulse rate, elevated blood
pressure, and temperature elevation also may be present.

Causes, incidence, and risk factors    Return to top

Delirium tremens can occur after a period of heavy alcohol drinking,
especially when the person does not eat enough food.

It may also be triggered by head injury, infection, or illness in people
with a history of heavy use of alcohol. It is most common in people who
have a history of experiencing alcohol withdrawal when alcohol is
stopped, especially in those who drink the equivalent of 7 to 8 pints of
beer (or 1 pint of &quot;hard&quot; alcohol) per day for several months, and in
those with a history of habitual alcohol use or alcoholism that has
existed for more than 10 years.

Symptoms occur because of the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain and
nervous system. They may be severe and progress rapidly.&quot;

People have died of the seizures -- that's what happened to my aunt (my
great aunt, actually -- grandma's sister). She had to be hospitalized
for something, and the sudden withdrawal of alcohol sent her into the
DT's, and she died.

&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt; were watching Nick jr this afternoon. They both ate about 2 bites of
&gt;&gt; chicken each for dinner and then they were done. We went for a long
&gt;&gt; walk after dinner (about an hour) and they had a popsicle each on the
&gt;&gt; way home. Although they ate poorly this afternoon/evening, their
&gt;&gt; entire
&gt;&gt; calorie intake for this time would have been about the same as if
&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt; had eaten no snack and a full, normal dinner. In line with this, if
&gt;&gt; they have airport McDonalds for breakfast, they are pretty much done
&gt;&gt; for

"/> Well, yes, they get McDonald's breakfast when we're at the airport.
There's not a whole lot of choice there in the morning, especially as my

What do you feed your kids for breakfast at the airport? At home they
usually have meat, eggs &amp; fruit, although the two year old mainly has
breastmilk for breakfast. I got them drive-thru sodas that day because
we were out running errands in 104 heat and they were thirsty. I don't
see soda as intrinsically evil - it has roughly the same calories as
juice, which most people seem to feed their kids all day long. Would
you think it was better if they had the &quot;McJuice&quot;? At home my kids have
one juice a day and water the rest of the time. I believe in all things
in moderation when it comes to food &amp; drink and I do not think I am
doing my kids a disservice by letting them have a cold soda on a hot
day.

&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same thing
&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie drink,
&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

"/> Hmmmm.....

I used to have a weight problem, which I successfully conquered over
10 years ago. Back in those days, feeling satiated meant having that
&quot;Thanksgiving-Full&quot; feeling at every single meal. I would keep eating
until my stomach was bloated and I would want to unbutton my pants. I
also did a whole lot of snacking when I wasn't physically hungry. I
was an emotional eater and having something crunchy or salty to
mindlessly stuff in my mouth each night before bed while watching t.v.
filled my &quot;hunger.&quot;

I think when you eat that quantity of food routinely at every meal,
your stomach stretches. This is why gastric bypass works - it shrinks
the stomach back to a normal size. From what I know from friends
who've had this done, the desire to still stuff themselves to the
stretching point remains after the surgery, but the cost of that is
getting violently ill. Those who have the surgery still need to learn
what it feels like to be sated, but not Thanksgiving stuffed.

This is what I taught myself a decade ago and why I no longer struggle
with my weight anymore. I no longer stuff myself to the point of
stretching out my stomach. I can't stand that feeling anymore. Even at
Thanksgiving time I avoid it. Someone mentioned eating out - I do eat
out quite a bit, yet I don't gain weight because even if I order a big
meal, I put my fork down before my stomach is straining to
overcapacity. I take the rest of the meal home for later (I can get
3-4 meals out of one standard-sized restaurant dinner so it is
actually not completely unfrugal).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a day
&gt; too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt; for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt; hungry?

&gt; It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt; simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt; is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt; modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number of
&gt; people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and others
&gt; who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt; For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was right:
&gt; since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt; being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt; but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal, low-fat
&gt; stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the hard
&gt; work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt; assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt; that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt; mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.

"/> That's wonderful that you've found a diet that works for you. Keep up
the good work!

For me, what worked 10 years ago was a vegetarian diet low in fat and
very high in complex carbs. You may be surprised to know I am
hypoglycemic with a history of diabetes in my family. I know exactly
what you mean about having the shakes when you eat something too
sugary or high in simple carbs, but I no longer equate that shaky
feeling with &quot;hunger&quot; - it's more like a toxic, sickly reaction than
true hunger, IMO.

The low-fat, vegetarian diet enabled me to continue the emotional
mindless grazing for a period of time while I unlearned the
Thanksgiving-stuffed feeling first. I ate small meals but pretty much
constantly throughout the day. I listened to my body and listened
hard. I learned to identify when I was sated but not overstuffed and
how little food it really took to get to that feeling. Then I started
tackling the emotional issues.

Today, I no longer mindlessly snack, and I don't follow a diet. I eat
all kinds of things, including meat, chocolate, ice cream and even
McDonald's, but in moderation. For example 10 years ago I used to eat
at McD's 3-4 times a week and would order the Big Mac and large fries
which would leave me with that thanksgiving full feeling; today I
don't deliberately avoid McD's and don't fret if I go there once or
twice a month, but when I do go, I order a small burger with small
fries, and it's plenty.

I am able to listen to my body and hear when it craves veggies, or
protein, or yes, carbs. I am able to hear when it's had enough and
another bite would be too much. I have maintained my weight within
+/-5 lbs for over a decade without trying too much, whether I have
been active and exercising or completely sedentary for months on end
due to back problems.

I don't have to work to hard at it, either. So yes, I agree that
there's some mechanism at work in those that are able to successfully
maintain their weight, I just don't agree that it's necessarily some
magical biological thing that one has no control whatsoever over. One
does have control and we all have this mechanism - those that are
overweight just aren't listening to it or are misinterpreting it,
which is easy to do, so I am sympathetic.

of us stop listening to it along the way. I think the clean-plate club
and three square meals a day are part of that, as well as the general
attitude that every day should be a Thanksgiving feast.

I have kids myself and I know how hard it is not to fret when they
seem to eat like birds and subsist on nothing but a handful of grapes.
I have to keep reminding myself that their bodies know what they need,
and they'll eat just enough -no more or less- if I don't interfere.

&gt; I can only speak for myself, but no, it didn't.

&gt; I could get up from a large meal and half an hour later be starving. It
&gt; seemed to have nothing to do with whether my STOMACH was full -- in
&gt; fact, I could be uncomfortable, and still feel hungry. (I know now that
&gt; that was most likely to happen if I ate a carb-heavy meal -- pancakes
&gt; for breakfast, for example -- but that's not a connection I made
&gt; earlier.)

&gt; For reasons I only dimly begin to understand, my brain told me I needed
&gt; to eat -- and that feeling of being hungry was there most of the time.
&gt; People would say to listen to my body -- and I tried to -- but it turns
&gt; out my body was telling me to eat because of the way insulin behaves in
&gt; me, NOT because I really needed the calories.

&gt; And, unfortunately, my stomach had nothing to do with it.

"/> I know what you're talking about, but the insulin roller coaster is
not really a &quot;hungry&quot; feeling, IMO. As you say, you already feel full,
so you aren't hungry. You're sick. Maybe that's a fine point, but for
me it was helpful to discern the difference.

For example, a few months ago I was in an airport at breakfast time.
We were in a rush so we got Cinnabons. I knew this is the equivalent
of putting toxic waste down my throat for me, especially on a fasting
stomach, but we had no other choice and our flight wouldn't be serving
food so it would be hours before we had a chance for another meal. I
got so ill within an hour - shaky, trembly, nauseous. But it was *not*
a hunger feeling. It was a sick feeling. There really is a difference,
IMO.

&gt; that those who did not struggle with their weight seemed to have an

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My body tells me to eat frequently, and feels sick if I go much over 4
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hours
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without eating.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I eat small amounts each time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's that people expect that a certain amount of food is &quot;reasonable&quot;, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to eat to satiation each time, that gets them into trouble.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Banty

&gt;&gt;&gt;And what if eating those small amounts leaves you hungry? What if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;never feel even &quot;not hungry&quot; -- never mind satiated?

&gt;&gt; Satiated = not hungry, right?

&gt;&gt; Look, I think you're looking for a &quot;ohhhh, dear soul, everyyyone's
&gt;&gt; differenttt,
&gt;&gt; and we alll try our besssst, I know youuuu doo, we should alll be
&gt;&gt; understannnding and tollerantt&quot;. Or at least &quot;well, maybe if someone is
&gt;&gt; *always* *always* hungry due to some quirk, it can't be helped&quot;.

&gt;I'm not looking for sympathy -- only a little less judgementalism and a
&gt;little more understanding of the complex causes of obesity.

&gt;&gt; But, really, it's not new news that carbs metabolize quickly, and the word
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; been out for a long time regarding eating *balanced* diet with portion
&gt;&gt; control.

&gt;That's exactly my point -- a &quot;balanced&quot; diet doesn't work well for me.
&gt;I need one that is extremely low in carbs -- and relatively high in fats.

&gt;&gt; And exercise. Atkins takes it to the other end, but tell me truthfully,
&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt; was your diet before?

&gt;Fairly balanced, and low fat. I generally ate a healthy diet -- just
&gt;too much of it, because I was always hungry.

&gt;&gt; One might gain 30 pounds or so while trying to figure out what's going on.
&gt;&gt; But
&gt;&gt; becoming obese? That takes years.

&gt;yes, it did. But NOT gaining weight took constant effort -- and there
&gt;were periods of time where I didn't feel like I had the energy for that.

&gt;What took decades was finding a way to eat that allows me to lose weight
&gt;without being hungry all the time. I've lost weight before -- but it
&gt;always came back on as soon as I lost the energy to tolerate constant
&gt;hunger.

&gt;It has surprised me to find out what apparently most people feel like --
&gt;that is, what it feels like to not be constantly hungry, to not have
&gt;&quot;constant cravings&quot;, to, in fact, be satisfied with what I've eaten.

"/> I'm glad you found a way of eating that works for you. Like I said before, I
think the emphasis on the &quot;food pyramid&quot; hasn't been the right thing for a lot
of people.

The other side of the equation is exercise. It stabilizes the sugar metabolism,
and adds muscle which is more calorie-demanding.

It's a Way of Life (WOL) of which a Way of Eating (WOE) is just a part. These
acronyms come from the group alt.support.diet.

By the way, people don't like to crosspost between a.s.d and
alt.support.fat-acceptance, which is one of the crossposts in this thread. Why?
Two reasons. Dragging in all the a.s.f-a hecklers, some of whom we're seeing
here. But also because of that message that there *is* something to be done,
and that it's NOT about putting in a few months of penitence, then returning to
old habits. Not a message received well there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; does quite a bit.

&gt;&gt; Well, she obviously doesn't do enough, and obviously eats too much,
&gt;&gt; because she's fat, and therefore has too much of a calorie excess.
&gt;&gt; QED. What do you think is making her fat? Rays from space?

This is what controls simple molecules being built up to complex

So the entropy of the system increases in that process (ORDERING into

&gt;Well, you seem to think she's running a calorie deficit whilst not

"/> Yeah. Seven hour daily runs really strains credulity - even marathon trainers
only do a few of these very long runs about a month before the race, then back
off for a week or so.

And what you may see people eat, and what they say they eat, can be very
different from what they *do* eat.

&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt;&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same thing
&gt;&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie drink,
&gt;&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt;&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;Hmmmm.....

&gt;I used to have a weight problem, which I successfully conquered over
&gt;10 years ago. Back in those days, feeling satiated meant having that
&gt;&quot;Thanksgiving-Full&quot; feeling at every single meal. I would keep eating
&gt;until my stomach was bloated and I would want to unbutton my pants. I
&gt;also did a whole lot of snacking when I wasn't physically hungry. I
&gt;was an emotional eater and having something crunchy or salty to
&gt;mindlessly stuff in my mouth each night before bed while watching t.v.
&gt;filled my &quot;hunger.&quot;

&gt;I think when you eat that quantity of food routinely at every meal,
&gt;your stomach stretches. This is why gastric bypass works - it shrinks
&gt;the stomach back to a normal size. From what I know from friends
&gt;who've had this done, the desire to still stuff themselves to the
&gt;stretching point remains after the surgery, but the cost of that is
&gt;getting violently ill. Those who have the surgery still need to learn
&gt;what it feels like to be sated, but not Thanksgiving stuffed.

&gt;This is what I taught myself a decade ago and why I no longer struggle
&gt;with my weight anymore. I no longer stuff myself to the point of
&gt;stretching out my stomach. I can't stand that feeling anymore. Even at
&gt;Thanksgiving time I avoid it. Someone mentioned eating out - I do eat
&gt;out quite a bit, yet I don't gain weight because even if I order a big
&gt;meal, I put my fork down before my stomach is straining to
&gt;overcapacity. I take the rest of the meal home for later (I can get
&gt;3-4 meals out of one standard-sized restaurant dinner so it is
&gt;actually not completely unfrugal).

&gt;&gt; Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a day
&gt;&gt; too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt;&gt; for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt;&gt; hungry?

&gt;&gt; It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt;&gt; simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt;&gt; is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt;&gt; modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number of
&gt;&gt; people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and others
&gt;&gt; who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt;&gt; For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was right:
&gt;&gt; since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt;&gt; being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt;&gt; but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal, low-fat
&gt;&gt; stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the hard
&gt;&gt; work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt;&gt; assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt;&gt; that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt;&gt; mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.

&gt;That's wonderful that you've found a diet that works for you. Keep up
&gt;the good work!

&gt;For me, what worked 10 years ago was a vegetarian diet low in fat and
&gt;very high in complex carbs. You may be surprised to know I am
&gt;hypoglycemic with a history of diabetes in my family. I know exactly
&gt;what you mean about having the shakes when you eat something too
&gt;sugary or high in simple carbs, but I no longer equate that shaky
&gt;feeling with &quot;hunger&quot; - it's more like a toxic, sickly reaction than
&gt;true hunger, IMO.

&gt;The low-fat, vegetarian diet enabled me to continue the emotional
&gt;mindless grazing for a period of time while I unlearned the
&gt;Thanksgiving-stuffed feeling first. I ate small meals but pretty much
&gt;constantly throughout the day. I listened to my body and listened
&gt;hard. I learned to identify when I was sated but not overstuffed and
&gt;how little food it really took to get to that feeling. Then I started
&gt;tackling the emotional issues.

&gt;Today, I no longer mindlessly snack, and I don't follow a diet. I eat
&gt;all kinds of things, including meat, chocolate, ice cream and even
&gt;McDonald's, but in moderation. For example 10 years ago I used to eat
&gt;at McD's 3-4 times a week and would order the Big Mac and large fries
&gt;which would leave me with that thanksgiving full feeling; today I
&gt;don't deliberately avoid McD's and don't fret if I go there once or
&gt;twice a month, but when I do go, I order a small burger with small
&gt;fries, and it's plenty.

&gt;I am able to listen to my body and hear when it craves veggies, or
&gt;protein, or yes, carbs. I am able to hear when it's had enough and
&gt;another bite would be too much. I have maintained my weight within
&gt;+/-5 lbs for over a decade without trying too much, whether I have
&gt;been active and exercising or completely sedentary for months on end
&gt;due to back problems.

&gt;I don't have to work to hard at it, either. So yes, I agree that
&gt;there's some mechanism at work in those that are able to successfully
&gt;maintain their weight, I just don't agree that it's necessarily some
&gt;magical biological thing that one has no control whatsoever over. One
&gt;does have control and we all have this mechanism - those that are
&gt;overweight just aren't listening to it or are misinterpreting it,
&gt;which is easy to do, so I am sympathetic.

&gt;jen

"/> Yep. I went through a learning period and some ups and downs, too. The first
was when I ballooned in adolescence. That's when my metobolic problems were
diagnosed. I'd be sugar-hungry, eat sugar and other carbs, crash, eat more
sugar and carbs, etc. etc. That's when I learned about eating more meals, and
having protein and more complex carbs. BUT - I too had to unlearn that
stomach-full &quot;satiated&quot; feeling, because I can't be eating five or six meals a
day and do that!

Next problem was college, which was pretty much a matter of it being
logistically difficult to get ahold of small portion, nourishing foods in the
dorm setting. I moved off campus, had my own kitchen, and lost 20 lbs without
trying. Just because I could reach for different stuff, and when I need it.
It's all about management.

Since then it's the battle with that tendency to long, slow, &quot;tree-ring&quot; additon
of five or ten pounds a year. I think I got into trouble the last time around
largely because I turned to nice, comfortable, stretchy knit clothes in my 40's.
I'm 25 pounds lighter and those clothes are gone - now everything has a
waistband :-)

But a large part of the battle is unlearning (or re-learning) what satiation is.
And looking at a meal with sizes in mind. I also split up a diner meal to two
or three. I do that as soon as the plate arrives - what I'll eat now in front
of me; what I'll eat later divided to the back half of the plate. I go to
buffets - but I have to completely dump that idea in my (and a lot of other
people's) head that I'm 'foolishly' not getting my money's worth if a eat a
normal meal portion, so I go up *once* and keep my eyeballs on that palm-size
meat portion, etc. I also eat at McD's once or twice a month, I also have a
piece of chocolate now and then. I just don't keep chocolate around the house,
and I have a house rule about frequency of fast food.

The problem with obesity isn't the set of factors that make an individual more
prone to put on weight. The problem with obesity is the long neglect of not
managing those factors.

A few comments: First, is this teen on any medication and has he been
checked for metabolic problems like hypothyroidism.

I went on medication my senior year of high school to prevent
migraine-induced seizures. I was taking dance class daily, plus walking
everywhere, and while I was eating in the dorm, I don't think I really
changed my eating habits much, and, in fact, was on a health food kick for
most of that four years (not uncommon among fine arts majors, especially
female ones)

But, over 4 years, I gained about 60 lbs. It wasn't until after I was able
to get of the medication that I was able to start losing weight.

I really believe that one effect of the drugs I was taking was on my
metabolism, so it made it easier to put on weight, and therefore anything at
all extra I ate stayed around.

Also, I don't know about anyone else, but I've noticed that I have a set
point-it is VERY easy for me to get back to that specific weight (for
example, post-pregnancy), but anything below that is next to impossible to
maintain. And for me, that seems to be right at the top of what is
considered a healthy weight for my height, even though I'd much prefer to be
closer to the bottom of that scale than the top.

And, third, it's easy to say &quot;Get up and move&quot;, but I rather suspect that
it's a vicious circle-that once you're overweight, it's much harder to do
that, and once it's too hard to move much, it's easier to become overweight.
I was previously a pretty active person before going on bedrest in this
pregnancy, but I've noticed that after two months of being on bedrest, I
almost can't move-and I don't think the pregnant belly is the reason. I hate
to think of how hard it's going to be to get back into shape after four
months of being limited only to a few physical therapy exercises done in
bed-and I'm sure I'm going to have weight to take off, because I have no
doubt that I'm probably eating more than the baby and I need given my
activity level.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But this wasn't about who ate more calories -- it was about the

&gt;&gt;&gt; others, that doesn't seem to work -- they ate the same number of

&gt;&gt; I guess I'm not seeing how this proves there's some &quot;internal

raised
&gt;&gt; to clean their plates? IOW, it doesn't matter whether you feel
hungry
&gt;&gt; or not, when the plate is clean that's when you've had enough?

&gt; The difference was between those who struggled with weight and those
who
&gt; didn't, and people were selecting their own lunches -- those with no
&gt; weight struggles SELECTED fewer calories automatically, without
thinking
&gt; about it.

"/> Person A: looks at array of food, realizes he's not all that hungry
even though it's lunchtime, selects smaller portion for lunch.

Person B: looks at array of food, whether hungry or not, figures it is
lunchtime so he must be hungry and afterall according to the clock it's
time to eat, and selects usual portion of food for lunch.

IOW, the person who struggles with weight is the one here who's not
thinking about it, right?

&gt; Banty

"/> Yes. And, to the OP, I hope you don't think I'm picking on you or
anything. I think it's great you've found a diet that works for you,
and is enabling you to start on the long process of undoing bad habits
and replacing them with better ones. I am just opposed to the idea that
one diet approach is superior to another. I think they're all equally
good at getting a person kick-started on the road to better health, and
more in tune with their body's signals. But no diet, Atkins included,
is something anyone can or should follow the rest of their lives.

It doesn't go past me that some foods are truly &quot;bad&quot; for me except in
moderation. Obviously, I have a toxic reaction to foods that are high
in sugar and simple carbs. I did experiment a bit with the Atkin's
thing because it intrigued me, but it made me *just* as sick as a diet
high in sugar and carbs, except in a different way.

Ironically this morning my sweetie thought he'd do the loving thing and
made me breakfast in bed. So he whipped up two eggs and bacon - a
typical Atkins breakfast but not on purpose - we're running low on
groceries, and that's all that's in the house to eat. That was two
hours ago and I feel really ill right now. Yuck. No, not shaky ill but
rather my stomach is churning funny, there's a burning in my throat,
and my hands feel warm. No, I'm definetly not hungry but I don't feel
right at all.

In the old days I would reach for more food because, well, I guess
somewhere along the lines I must've learned that food is always the
answer when one feels bad. Whether physically ill, or emotionally, food
used to be the cure!

I don't know if you're seeing my point here, but that's okay. Maybe
it's something you just have to figure out on your own.

Good luck with your weight loss! It is really something to be commended
on, no matter how you went about it. :-)

because of my hypoglycemia before I feel the hunger pangs that most other people
respond to. I would eat, then feel great, then move on.

But, I'd eat more if I felt weak because of a cold, or felt weak because I was
tired, and of course I would get a temporary boost and that would reinforce that
eating for non-caloric needs.

One part of my routine is, when I'm feeling 'hungry' because it's late at night
and I'm *tired*, it's time for me to GO TO BED ;o)

&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot; --
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I bet that 420lb monster ate like a bird and ran marathons

&gt; A 420lb 6'2&quot; 16 year old. Lets say about 220 excess pounds gained
&gt; over 14 years. That is about 170 excess calories per day. Looks like
&gt; you're right, gluttony is the only possible explanation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a theory that some cases of obesity are caused by a virus
&gt;&gt;A virus that creates energy out of nowhere? Someone tell Stephen
&gt;&gt;Hawking he might be interested!

&gt; No, a virus that interferes, possibly only slightly, with one or more
&gt; of the bodies built-in feedback loops that regulate energy intake or
&gt; expenditure.

&gt; (While the viral cause is interesting and may be a partial explanation,
&gt; I'm not directly addressing it in the remainder of this article.)

&gt; With no conscious effort at all, many people maintain a near perfect
&gt; balance between calories consumed and calories expended. This isn't
&gt; out of some uncannily accurate sense for how many calories were in their
&gt; sandwich, or how many calories they burned walking in from the parking
&gt; lot. The body has some way of keeping caloric input and output in
&gt; balance.

&gt; For some, the balancing mechanism is slightly out of whack. Being off
&gt; by only 2% is &gt;4 pounds/yr.

&gt; An extra apple a day is small enough to be imperceptible to most diets,
&gt; yet it works out to about 10 pounds of added fat per year based on
&gt; excess calories. But very few people could actually manage to gain 10
&gt; pounds a year by just eating an extra apple a day. Without trying,
&gt; their bodies would automatically adjust. Perhaps they would just eat
&gt; less at other times, perhaps they would be a little more active; but
&gt; much of it would happen without any effort or willpower.

&gt; If you're someone who was able to maintain a stable weight before, an
&gt; apple a day probably won't change that. Even if your weight has been
&gt; going up you'll likely only gain a small portion of the &quot;expected&quot; 10
&gt; pounds since your body still regulates calories in and out, it just
&gt; does so imperfectly.

&gt;&gt;[someone else re: the efficacy of concentration camps in weightloss]

&gt; Just because obesity can be controlled via behavior, that doesn't mean
&gt; it is primarily a behavioral problem or that behavioral modification
&gt; is the best approach to treating it. If there is something wrong with
&gt; your body it isn't unreasonable to want to be able to correct it, rather
&gt; than just trying to work around the problem for the rest of your life.

&gt; I found the article &quot;Fat mice, eating machines, and biochemical treason&quot;
&gt; by Richard A. Lovett, Ph.D. in the November 2004 issue of Analog very
&gt; interesting (Analog is mainly Science Fiction but also has one &quot;Science
&gt; Fact&quot; article per month, usually dealing with current research). I'd
&gt; always felt that the biochemical excuse for obesity was largely wishful
&gt; thinking, but the research this article cites has me thinking there
&gt; really is something to it.

"/> What an excellent post . I couldn't agree more.

Those who are inclined toward hatred and bigotry condemn the obese,
since the obese are the last socially acceptable bastion for
expressing hate. The only people with a behavioral problem are them.

All other cases of obesity stem from a complex combination of physical
and/or emotional disorder (emotional disorder with food can trigger
physical disorder, e.g. if you over eat lots of food for emotional
reasons, eventually you become physically insulin resistant and your
body loses the ability to regulate energy usage/intake and you wind up
becoming obese). The most common cause of obesity in the west, and I
believe this 100%, is insulin resistance/sugar metabolism pathology.
It disturbs your body's ability to segue into using fat for fuel. It
causes you to have profound energy lows a few hours after eating, lows
which trigger a hormonal cascade which promotes ravenous hunger.

The cycle is this basically...
1) eat too many carbs for either your own unique biology (i.e. carb
sensitive), or for emotional reasons (i.e. compulsive eater,
depressed, etc)
2) the high glycemic load spikes blood sugar
3) insulin/glucagon axis is disturbed
4) elevated insulin and suppressed glucagon drives down sugar while
simultaneously suppressing body fat catabolism (i.e. your body is now
profoundly low on energy)
5) hormonal adaption to energy deprivation begins, irrational, insane,
gnawing hunger sets in... its a hunger unique to blood sugar problems,
it's like an insatiable disease that shakes your soul... its very hard
to describe to someone who's not experienced it, but it makes you want
to EAT and EAT. The word &quot;satiety&quot; means nothing... you're NEVER
satisfied with what you eat. It's a horrible affliction.
6) due to #5, you eat way more carbs. the fuel you eat is again,
upsetting insulin/glucagon axis. SHortly after the high you drive
sugar dips low rapidly while fat burning is suppressed, triggering
more gnawing hunger. Repeat ad infinitum.

It's VERY easy to accumulate excess weight if you are caught in the
&quot;blood sugar loop&quot;. The only way out is to cut the carbs.

I used to weigh 280 lbs. Today I weigh 117. Before I couldn't STOP
eating. Now, I have to actually make myself eat to maintain weight.
How did I change this? It wasn't via willpower (although I will admit
that adhering to my eating regimen takes discipline... which is an
entirely different concept from willpower). It was by cutting all the
freaking carbs I was eating.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Seriously, eating three meals a day and maybe a snack, then RUNNING for
7
&gt;&gt;&gt; hours straight doesn't exactly say that one isn't expending enough
calories.

&gt;&gt;Running for 7 hours straight? Perhaps if she's that good she should
&gt;&gt;run marathons professionally or something. That is, if she actually
&gt;&gt;does that rather than just says she does. Also even in three meals
&gt;&gt;it's enough to eat 4-5000 calories.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Love so much how you just know my sister so much better than I do.

&gt;&gt;Well, you seem to think she's running a calorie deficit whilst not
&gt;&gt;losing weight, so you're obviously ignorant of something.

&gt; Yeah. Seven hour daily runs really strains credulity - even marathon
trainers
&gt; only do a few of these very long runs about a month before the race, then
back
&gt; off for a week or so.

&gt; And what you may see people eat, and what they say they eat, can be very

"/> Jeez, sorry, didn't mean that she was acutally running for 7 hours straight,
just that she's in motion from the time she gets home from the time she goes
in at dark.

And when exactly would she be eating this food we don't see? She's 13 years
old, she can't go out and go to a restaurant without telling us, or walk to
the store and sneak some extra food. WHy is it that people don't seem to
think ones family who COOKS their meals and eats with them at most of the
meals (or who has a specific class setting in which the teachers know what
the child is eating) don't actually have a clue about the food intake?

&gt;&gt;excersise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she *says* she does, it's how much I see her do. She's outside from

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot; --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I bet that 420lb monster ate like a bird and ran marathons

&gt;&gt; A 420lb 6'2&quot; 16 year old. Lets say about 220 excess pounds gained
&gt;&gt; over 14 years. That is about 170 excess calories per day. Looks like
&gt;&gt; you're right, gluttony is the only possible explanation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's a theory that some cases of obesity are caused by a virus
&gt;&gt;&gt;A virus that creates energy out of nowhere? Someone tell Stephen
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hawking he might be interested!

&gt;&gt; No, a virus that interferes, possibly only slightly, with one or more
&gt;&gt; of the bodies built-in feedback loops that regulate energy intake or
&gt;&gt; expenditure.

&gt;&gt; (While the viral cause is interesting and may be a partial explanation,
&gt;&gt; I'm not directly addressing it in the remainder of this article.)

&gt;&gt; With no conscious effort at all, many people maintain a near perfect
&gt;&gt; balance between calories consumed and calories expended. This isn't
&gt;&gt; out of some uncannily accurate sense for how many calories were in their
&gt;&gt; sandwich, or how many calories they burned walking in from the parking
&gt;&gt; lot. The body has some way of keeping caloric input and output in
&gt;&gt; balance.

&gt;&gt; For some, the balancing mechanism is slightly out of whack. Being off
&gt;&gt; by only 2% is &gt;4 pounds/yr.

&gt;&gt; An extra apple a day is small enough to be imperceptible to most diets,
&gt;&gt; yet it works out to about 10 pounds of added fat per year based on
&gt;&gt; excess calories. But very few people could actually manage to gain 10
&gt;&gt; pounds a year by just eating an extra apple a day. Without trying,
&gt;&gt; their bodies would automatically adjust. Perhaps they would just eat
&gt;&gt; less at other times, perhaps they would be a little more active; but
&gt;&gt; much of it would happen without any effort or willpower.

&gt;&gt; If you're someone who was able to maintain a stable weight before, an
&gt;&gt; apple a day probably won't change that. Even if your weight has been
&gt;&gt; going up you'll likely only gain a small portion of the &quot;expected&quot; 10
&gt;&gt; pounds since your body still regulates calories in and out, it just
&gt;&gt; does so imperfectly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;[someone else re: the efficacy of concentration camps in weightloss]

&gt;&gt; Just because obesity can be controlled via behavior, that doesn't mean
&gt;&gt; it is primarily a behavioral problem or that behavioral modification
&gt;&gt; is the best approach to treating it. If there is something wrong with
&gt;&gt; your body it isn't unreasonable to want to be able to correct it, rather
&gt;&gt; than just trying to work around the problem for the rest of your life.

&gt;&gt; I found the article &quot;Fat mice, eating machines, and biochemical treason&quot;
&gt;&gt; by Richard A. Lovett, Ph.D. in the November 2004 issue of Analog very
&gt;&gt; interesting (Analog is mainly Science Fiction but also has one &quot;Science
&gt;&gt; Fact&quot; article per month, usually dealing with current research). I'd
&gt;&gt; always felt that the biochemical excuse for obesity was largely wishful
&gt;&gt; thinking, but the research this article cites has me thinking there
&gt;&gt; really is something to it.
&gt; What an excellent post . I couldn't agree more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;420-Pound Teen to Get Free Gastric Bypass

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors and Hospital Offer Free Gastric Bypass Surgery for 420-Pound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Teenager
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Associated Press

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HOUSTON Oct. 14, 2004 - Two doctors and a hospital offered a free gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center canceled the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure because his insurance would not pay for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors at Obesity Surgery Specialists said 16-year-old Brandon Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;needs the operation for a chance at a healthy life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon is often sent home from school because of high blood pressure and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an elevated heart rate, and he is too big to be allowed on rides at Six
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Flags Astroworld.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chronicle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the procedure will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;performed at Houston Community Hospital, which is also donating its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;services, said Laurie Cantrell, bariatric program director at Obesity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$25,000,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors create an egg-sized pouch in the upper stomach and attach it to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;section of intestine, reducing how much food patients can eat. Risks of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgery include malnutrition, stomach problems, infections and, rarely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful procedures by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie Wilson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity Surgery Specialists has performed about 230 gastric bypasses in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last two years, though none were on adolescents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon's father, Michael Bennett, said he has confidence in a surgical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;team experienced in adult surgery because his son, who is 6-foot-2, has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;physiology of a grown man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I can't believe this is finally going to happen,&quot; Michael Bennett said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating habits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are obese.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot; --

&gt;&gt; Bullshit, in practice that's the problem.

&gt;&gt; Nothing else explains the extreme levels of
&gt;&gt; obesity we are now seeing in north america.

&gt;&gt;&gt; though I know lots of people would like to believe that.

&gt;&gt; Thats what the evidence shows.

&gt;&gt; Like it or lump it.

&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same thing
&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie drink,
&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt; Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a day
&gt; too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt; for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt; hungry?

&gt; It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt; simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt; is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt; modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number of
&gt; people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and others
&gt; who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt; For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was right:
&gt; since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt; being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt; but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal, low-fat
&gt; stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the hard
&gt; work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt; assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt; that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt; mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.

"/> You're right on target about Dr. Atkins. The man is a hero. He brought
to light the true problem that cuases metabolic disorder and it's
symptoms (diabetes, CHD, obesity, fertility abnormalities, and other
failings of endocrine/metabolic system).

We as humans are eating a diet that is much too high in carbohydrate.
Humans are designed to eat like omnivores biased towards carnivorism -
high fat, high pro, lots of animal products, and supplemented with
healthy unprocessed foliage, fruit, seeds, nuts.

Some of us have a stronger resistence to eating this unnatural diet.
Others, particularly those who come from minority ethnic backgrounds
(as they have a much more recent hunter-gatherer history than euros),
more readily develop one or more of the symptoms of disease.

Broken energy intake feedback loop is a symptom of your body not being
able to fuel itself properly. Obesity is a symptom of malnutrition, as
unlikely as that seems. Feed your body right and everything falls into
place.

I'm sure there are some diseases which are immutable, where people are
hungry no matter what because of a neurological deficit of some kind
creates a broken satiety feedback loop (e.g. prader-willi). However,
for the rest of us, our problems regulating energy intake is
symptomatic of eating a diet that our body can't tolerate.

I too am an atkins success story, as I've said in several posts I
slimmed from 280 to 117 using the prinicples I learned from him.

&gt;&gt; you think it was better if they had the &quot;McJuice&quot;?

&gt; Except fruit juice is full of vitamins, whilst 'soda' is full of
&gt; chemicals and acids that leech nutrients from the body. Also have you
&gt; ever heard of water?

&gt; Your kids are heading for an unhealthily obese lifestyle and it will
&gt; be all your fault.

"/> An occassional soda or fast food meal is hardly &quot;bringing them up on a
diet of junk food.&quot; I see kids who are never allowed a soda or fast
food getting much more obsessive about food.

&gt;&gt;how? The definitions seem pretty clear to me. I know when I'm hungry.
&gt;&gt;But, for me, when I eat a higher carb diet, I'm hungry when I don't

&gt; Have you looked into this, taken a glucose tolerance test?

&gt; Even if you did, hopefully (!) it would be a matter of diet management, just

As I said, I now have a way of eating that does NOT leave me feeling

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;420-Pound Teen to Get Free Gastric Bypass

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors and Hospital Offer Free Gastric Bypass Surgery for 420-Pound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Teenager
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Associated Press

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HOUSTON Oct. 14, 2004 - Two doctors and a hospital offered a free gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center canceled the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure because his insurance would not pay for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors at Obesity Surgery Specialists said 16-year-old Brandon Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;needs the operation for a chance at a healthy life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon is often sent home from school because of high blood pressure and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an elevated heart rate, and he is too big to be allowed on rides at Six
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Flags Astroworld.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chronicle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the procedure will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;performed at Houston Community Hospital, which is also donating its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;services, said Laurie Cantrell, bariatric program director at Obesity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$25,000,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors create an egg-sized pouch in the upper stomach and attach it to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;section of intestine, reducing how much food patients can eat. Risks of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgery include malnutrition, stomach problems, infections and, rarely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful procedures by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie Wilson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity Surgery Specialists has performed about 230 gastric bypasses in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last two years, though none were on adolescents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon's father, Michael Bennett, said he has confidence in a surgical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;team experienced in adult surgery because his son, who is 6-foot-2, has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;physiology of a grown man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I can't believe this is finally going to happen,&quot; Michael Bennett said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating habits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are obese.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot; --

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit, in practice that's the problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing else explains the extreme levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt; obesity we are now seeing in north america.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though I know lots of people would like to believe that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats what the evidence shows.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like it or lump it.

&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research:

&gt; Been there, done that. It doesnt show
&gt; anything like your stupid pig ignorant claim.

"/> Why don't you admit you have no idea about the science behind obesity?
Why don't you admit you are a hateful, bigoted person, much too
cowardly to funnel your venom toward any group but the obese? You are
the sort of person that would be running blacks out of southern towns
60 years ago.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; it seems pretty clear that some folks seem to
&gt;&gt; have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter
&gt;&gt; how much they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt; And concentration camps and stomach stapling proves
&gt; that even those can stop being obscenely obese.

&gt; Reams of mindless crap flushed where it belongs.

"/> Re: concentration camps...
Yes. When you don't have food it's kinda hard to get fat. No one is
trying to say that peoplea re becoming fat on air. We're saying that a
comlex network of emotional, behavioral, and subsequent physical
abnormalities produce obesity. It's a huge mistake to approach obesity
as a self-imposed affliction. It's a symptom of disorder of some kind.
No one chooses to be fat. It cannot be delt with via willpower.
Discipline, yes. Willpower? No. It's not reasonable to ask people to
ignore symptoms of failing health just to suppress a socially
unacceptable symptom of disease. It's not reasonable, humane, nor
rational (so you'll be a thin diabetic... so what?).

Also, when you starve yourself, you de facto straighten out the
hormonal mess that results in obesity in the first place (i.e. eat
high carb diet -&gt; poor fueling of the body -&gt; hunger -&gt; over eating &amp;
inability to regulate energy intake -&gt; ad infinitum). So, even if
concentration camp victims had access to food, assuming that food
wasn't high carb they would only eat to their bodies need for energy
because they've adjusted to a fat based metabolism. Depending on the
severity of starvation, this will vary greatly, however the variance
is determined exclusively by how much energy the body NEEDS. That's
the key.

Re: stomach stapling...
Bariatric surgery reduces the volume of food a person can eat in one
sitting. This reduces glycemic load. It also reduces the capacity to
tolerate junk food (i.e. carbs). All bariatric patients are advised to
eat high protein, higher fat, lower carb diets, and to eat small
portions. Again glycemic load is reduced.

Frankly, they could just go on the Atkins diet and save themselves the
trouble IMO.

&gt;&gt; Banty

&gt; Yes. And, to the OP, I hope you don't think I'm picking on you or
&gt; anything. I think it's great you've found a diet that works for you,
&gt; and is enabling you to start on the long process of undoing bad habits
&gt; and replacing them with better ones. I am just opposed to the idea that
&gt; one diet approach is superior to another. I think they're all equally
&gt; good at getting a person kick-started on the road to better health, and
&gt; more in tune with their body's signals. But no diet, Atkins included,
&gt; is something anyone can or should follow the rest of their lives.

"/> At this moment, I DO see myself following a carb-restricted diet for the
rest of my life. As I approach a reasonable weight, I'll add more carbs
than I'm eating now -- but as long as I stay healthy (and I am) I see no
reason to NOT continue to eat this way.

I may feel differently some day -- but it will be a long time before I'm
at my goal weight, and I'll reevaluate then.

&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same
&gt; thing
&gt;&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie
&gt; drink,
&gt;&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID
&gt; struggle
&gt;&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt; This is obvious with my kids (2 &amp;3 years old). I let them have a small
&gt; soda each from the drive through this afternoon (we're in Australia and
&gt; it was very hot) and they ate a bowl of grapes between them while they
&gt; were watching Nick jr this afternoon. They both ate about 2 bites of
&gt; chicken each for dinner and then they were done. We went for a long
&gt; walk after dinner (about an hour) and they had a popsicle each on the
&gt; way home. Although they ate poorly this afternoon/evening, their entire
&gt; calorie intake for this time would have been about the same as if they
&gt; had eaten no snack and a full, normal dinner. In line with this, if
&gt; they have airport McDonalds for breakfast, they are pretty much done for
&gt; the day, minus fruit snacks and drinks. If I had a McDonalds breakfast
&gt; there is no way my hunger mechanism would turn off for the entire day.
&gt; Obviously, their calorie counter works and mine does not. Somehow, I
&gt; think I got trained out of listening to mine.

I am not overweight (BMI about 22), and I don't eat big meals. Cereal and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats what the evidence shows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like it or lump it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research:

&gt;&gt; Been there, done that. It doesnt show
&gt;&gt; anything like your stupid pig ignorant claim.
&gt; Why don't you admit you have no idea about the science behind obesity?

Have a browse using groups.google sometime and even someone
as stupid as you should be able to discover that its more than just
the obscenely obese that get what they deserve from me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; it seems pretty clear that some folks seem to
&gt;&gt;&gt; have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter
&gt;&gt;&gt; how much they eat, they are always hungry.
&gt;&gt; And concentration camps and stomach stapling proves
&gt;&gt; that even those can stop being obscenely obese.
&gt;&gt; Reams of mindless crap flushed where it belongs.
&gt; Re: concentration camps...
&gt; Yes. When you don't have food it's kinda hard to get fat.

"/> So even those that are purportedly hungry all the time, and that
is just a mindless hippo copout, dont need to be obscenely obese.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No one is trying to say that peoplea re becoming fat on air.
&gt; We're saying that a comlex network of emotional, behavioral,
&gt; and subsequent physical abnormalities produce obesity.

"/> Pity that cannot explain why obscene levels of obesity are
just a recent problem and that wasnt seen say in the 50s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's a huge mistake to approach obesity as a self-imposed

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No one chooses to be fat.

"/> Wrong again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, when you starve yourself, you de facto straighten out the

&gt; eating &amp; inability to regulate energy intake -&gt; ad infinitum).

"/> Just your mindless copout.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, even if concentration camp victims had access to food, assuming

And is only a problem in the west, not where carbs
are a major part of the diet outside the west.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Depending on the severity of starvation, this will vary
&gt; greatly, however the variance is determined exclusively

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Re: stomach stapling...
&gt; Bariatric surgery reduces the volume of food a person can eat in one sitting.

"/> Duh.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This reduces glycemic load. It also reduces
&gt; the capacity to tolerate junk food (i.e. carbs).

"/> In practice it just prevents those fools from shovelling the usual
amount of food into their jaws. Wiring their jaws would work just
as well. And would have another benefit that it would shut them up too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; All bariatric patients are advised to eat high protein, higher fat, lower

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;420-Pound Teen to Get Free Gastric Bypass

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors and Hospital Offer Free Gastric Bypass Surgery for 420-Pound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Teenager
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Associated Press

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HOUSTON Oct. 14, 2004 - Two doctors and a hospital offered a free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center canceled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure because his insurance would not pay for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors at Obesity Surgery Specialists said 16-year-old Brandon Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;needs the operation for a chance at a healthy life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon is often sent home from school because of high blood pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an elevated heart rate, and he is too big to be allowed on rides at Six
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Flags Astroworld.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chronicle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the procedure will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;performed at Houston Community Hospital, which is also donating its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;services, said Laurie Cantrell, bariatric program director at Obesity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$25,000,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors create an egg-sized pouch in the upper stomach and attach it to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;section of intestine, reducing how much food patients can eat. Risks of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgery include malnutrition, stomach problems, infections and, rarely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful procedures
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie Wilson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity Surgery Specialists has performed about 230 gastric bypasses in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last two years, though none were on adolescents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon's father, Michael Bennett, said he has confidence in a surgical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;team experienced in adult surgery because his son, who is 6-foot-2, has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;physiology of a grown man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I can't believe this is finally going to happen,&quot; Michael Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating habits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are obese.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot; --

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit, in practice that's the problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing else explains the extreme levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt; obesity we are now seeing in north america.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though I know lots of people would like to believe that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats what the evidence shows.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like it or lump it.

&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt;&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same thing
&gt;&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie drink,
&gt;&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt;&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;&gt; Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a day
&gt;&gt; too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt;&gt; for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt;&gt; hungry?

&gt;&gt; It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt;&gt; simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt;&gt; is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt;&gt; modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number of
&gt;&gt; people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and others
&gt;&gt; who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt;&gt; For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was right:
&gt;&gt; since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt;&gt; being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt;&gt; but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal, low-fat
&gt;&gt; stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the hard
&gt;&gt; work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt;&gt; assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt;&gt; that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt;&gt; mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.
&gt; You're right on target about Dr. Atkins. The man is a hero.

"/> Yep, he's killing off you hippos. Great, should have got the Nobel Prize for
that.

&gt; He brought to light the true problem that cuases metabolic
&gt; disorder and it's symptoms (diabetes, CHD, obesity, fertility

&gt; It has surprised me to find out what apparently most people feel like --
&gt; that is, what it feels like to not be constantly hungry, to not have
&gt;&quot;constant cravings&quot;, to, in fact, be satisfied with what I've eaten.

"/> Thank you for reminding me of this.
I had forgotten what a revelation it was for me to also be free of the
blood sugar demon.

I now remember. I felt so AMAZED that this is what normal people felt
like. I also felt very hurt and sad that I spent my entire life in a
prison, all because of our intolerant idealistic society being closed
minded to progress and opinions.

Oh and Banty, what was I doing when I was accumulating 160 extra lbs?
WEll lets see. I was
1) being a teenager (not thinking too heavily about stuff, just eating
what my body said it wanted)
2) trapped under the impression that dieting was stupid, because you
can't suppress your hunger forever (which was correct)
3) trapped under the impression that, because of #2, I was destined to
be fat (which was very incorrect, as I had not assumed my abnormal
hunger and low energy was a product of metabolic problems).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And what if eating those small amounts leaves you hungry? What if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never feel even &quot;not hungry&quot; -- never mind satiated?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Try changing your definition of &quot;not hungry&quot; and &quot;hungry.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jen

&gt;&gt;&gt;how? The definitions seem pretty clear to me. I know when I'm hungry.
&gt;&gt;&gt;But, for me, when I eat a higher carb diet, I'm hungry when I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;really need the food.

&gt;&gt; Have you looked into this, taken a glucose tolerance test?

&gt;&gt; Even if you did, hopefully (!) it would be a matter of diet management, just
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; you are now doing. But this sounds like the problems I first encoutnered in
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt; adolescence.

&gt;&gt; Or it still could be expectation of that stomach-full feeling, as jen
&gt;&gt; describes.
&gt;&gt; What, exactly, do you mean by &quot;knowing when (you're) hungry&quot;? Stomach
&gt;&gt; growling,
&gt;&gt; hands shaking and weakness, or thinking and craving? I've experiences all
&gt;&gt; three
&gt;&gt; kinds of hunger, and have learned the difference.

&gt;&gt; Banty

&gt;My stomach feels empty. I want FOOD.

"/> Then it's that expectation that you always have something in your stomach that
jen is talking about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As I said, I now have a way of eating that does NOT leave me feeling

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center canceled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chronicle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the procedure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$25,000,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rarely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedures
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie Wilson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating habits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are obese.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot; --

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit, in practice that's the problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing else explains the extreme levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obesity we are now seeing in north america.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though I know lots of people would like to believe that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats what the evidence shows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like it or lump it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt;&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt;&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt;&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same thing
&gt;&gt;&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie drink,
&gt;&gt;&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt;&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt;&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a day
&gt;&gt;&gt; too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt;&gt;&gt; for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt;&gt;&gt; hungry?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt;&gt;&gt; simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt;&gt;&gt; is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt;&gt;&gt; modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number of
&gt;&gt;&gt; people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and others
&gt;&gt;&gt; who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was right:
&gt;&gt;&gt; since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt;&gt;&gt; being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt;&gt;&gt; but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal, low-fat
&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the hard
&gt;&gt;&gt; work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt;&gt;&gt; assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.

&gt;&gt; You're right on target about Dr. Atkins. The man is a hero.

&gt; Yep, he's killing off you hippos. Great, should have got the Nobel Prize for
&gt; that.

"/> No evidence for that at all -- every time someone does a study to try to
see if this WOE is unhealthy, it comes up the opposite.

Of course, as far as I know, there are not long term studies (like 10
years or more), but I figure losing weight has GOT to make me healthier!

&gt;Reasonable if it's going to be daily or weekly --- but if you go to an

&gt;&gt;&gt; At home they

&gt;Yes. Lots of people are still breastfeeding at two.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I got them drive-thru sodas that day because
&gt;&gt;&gt; we were out running errands in 104 heat and they were thirsty. I don't

&gt;&gt; Except fruit juice is full of vitamins, whilst 'soda' is full of

&gt;&gt; Your kids are heading for an unhealthily obese lifestyle and it will
&gt;&gt; be all your fault.

&gt;An occassional soda or fast food meal is hardly &quot;bringing them up on a
&gt;diet of junk food.&quot; I see kids who are never allowed a soda or fast
&gt;food getting much more obsessive about food.

&gt;Worldwide, yes. In the US, we have this peculiar idea that when a child

practice. If you go to other parts of the world you will see that it is
very common. For someone who is so opinionated about human nutition it
is startling that you do not know even the the most basic fact about how

&gt;&gt; It has surprised me to find out what apparently most people feel like --
&gt;&gt; that is, what it feels like to not be constantly hungry, to not have
&gt;&gt;&quot;constant cravings&quot;, to, in fact, be satisfied with what I've eaten.

&gt;Thank you for reminding me of this.
&gt;I had forgotten what a revelation it was for me to also be free of the
&gt;blood sugar demon.

&gt;I now remember. I felt so AMAZED that this is what normal people felt
&gt;like. I also felt very hurt and sad that I spent my entire life in a
&gt;prison, all because of our intolerant idealistic society being closed
&gt;minded to progress and opinions.

&gt;Oh and Banty, what was I doing when I was accumulating 160 extra lbs?
&gt;WEll lets see. I was
&gt;1) being a teenager (not thinking too heavily about stuff, just eating
&gt;what my body said it wanted)
&gt;2) trapped under the impression that dieting was stupid, because you
&gt;can't suppress your hunger forever (which was correct)
&gt;3) trapped under the impression that, because of #2, I was destined to
&gt;be fat (which was very incorrect, as I had not assumed my abnormal
&gt;hunger and low energy was a product of metabolic problems).

"/> Then the fat-acceptance that's-just-the-way-we-are anti-diet thing wouldn't be
help you much, would it.

See, the thing is, I was diagnosed with an endrocrine problem back around 1970.
And dealt with it before I got to 300 lbs. I was a teen, too.

Like I said before, the problem with obesity isn't the factors that make an
individual tend to put on weight. The problem is in the long neglect of not
managing the factors.

I mean, you put on 160 lbs. Didn't you, say, after putting on 50 lbs and
finding it hard to find clothes and fit in chairs, begin to want to deal with
it??

But, I'm glad you've found your WOE and WOL now. Although I think you're
falling down way too much around that Atkins altar. Five years from now it'll
be some other diet. Beleive me - BTDT.

Cheers,
Banty

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors and Hospital Offer Free Gastric Bypass Surgery for 420-Pound
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Teenager
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Associated Press

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HOUSTON Oct. 14, 2004 - Two doctors and a hospital offered a free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center canceled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure because his insurance would not pay for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors at Obesity Surgery Specialists said 16-year-old Brandon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;needs the operation for a chance at a healthy life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon is often sent home from school because of high blood
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an elevated heart rate, and he is too big to be allowed on rides at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Six
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Flags Astroworld.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chronicle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the procedure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;performed at Houston Community Hospital, which is also donating its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;services, said Laurie Cantrell, bariatric program director at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$25,000,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors create an egg-sized pouch in the upper stomach and attach it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;section of intestine, reducing how much food patients can eat. Risks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgery include malnutrition, stomach problems, infections and,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rarely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedures
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie Wilson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity Surgery Specialists has performed about 230 gastric bypasses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last two years, though none were on adolescents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon's father, Michael Bennett, said he has confidence in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;team experienced in adult surgery because his son, who is 6-foot-2,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;physiology of a grown man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I can't believe this is finally going to happen,&quot; Michael Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie drink,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a day
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hungry?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was right:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal, low-fat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're right on target about Dr. Atkins. The man is a hero.
&gt;&gt; Yep, he's killing off you hippos. Great,
&gt;&gt; should have got the Nobel Prize for that.
&gt; No evidence for that at all

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Associated Press

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;HOUSTON Oct. 14, 2004 - Two doctors and a hospital offered a free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;canceled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure because his insurance would not pay for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors at Obesity Surgery Specialists said 16-year-old Brandon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;needs the operation for a chance at a healthy life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon is often sent home from school because of high blood
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an elevated heart rate, and he is too big to be allowed on rides

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Six
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Flags Astroworld.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chronicle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;performed at Houston Community Hospital, which is also donating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;services, said Laurie Cantrell, bariatric program director at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$25,000,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors create an egg-sized pouch in the upper stomach and attach
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;section of intestine, reducing how much food patients can eat.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Risks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgery include malnutrition, stomach problems, infections and,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rarely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedures
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wilson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity Surgery Specialists has performed about 230 gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bypasses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last two years, though none were on adolescents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon's father, Michael Bennett, said he has confidence in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;team experienced in adult surgery because his son, who is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;6-foot-2,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;physiology of a grown man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I can't believe this is finally going to happen,&quot; Michael
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; habits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obese.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit, in practice that's the problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing else explains the extreme levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obesity we are now seeing in north america.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though I know lots of people would like to believe that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats what the evidence shows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like it or lump it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; habits
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obese.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It turns out, if you look at the research, that obesity is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that simple: that is, it isn't just a case of &quot;bad eating habits&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit, in practice that's the problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing else explains the extreme levels of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obesity we are now seeing in north america.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though I know lots of people would like to believe that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats what the evidence shows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like it or lump it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out the scientific research: it seems pretty clear that some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; folks seem to have a &quot;broken&quot; feedback loop, and, no matter how much
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they eat, they are always hungry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In one study, for example, they took a group of people, some of whom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; struggled with weight some of whom did not. They fed them doctored
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shakes: they all tasted the same, but some had 200 calories more than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others. The people who were IN the study didn't know that there was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difference -- as far as they knew, they were all drinking the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every day. Then an hour later they fed them lunch. For those who did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT struggle with weight, on the days they got the higher calorie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drink,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they ate about 200 calories less for lunch. For those who DID struggle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with weight, they ate about the same amount for lunch regardless of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which shake they got. Apparently, for some people, there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bio-feedback mechanism that balances calories and exercise and need:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for others, that mechanism is broken.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you know that a calorie imbalance as small as eating one apple a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too much will result in a weight gain of 10 pounds per year? And that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for some people, no matter how much they eat, they are simply always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hungry?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may be as &quot;simple&quot; as calories in/calories out -- but it isn't as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simple as &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;bad eating habits&quot;; the scientific research
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is showing a much more complicated situation. It may well be that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modern eating habits are making it even harder -- but I know a number
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people who eat out regularly, and never struggle with weight, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who seem to always be watching their weight.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For me, and for a number of my relatives, it seems Dr. Atkins was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; since I started eating a diet that is extremely low-carb, I stopped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being hungry all the time. I could lose weight on a low-fat diet --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but only by being constantly hungry, no matter how much low-cal,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; low-fat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff I ate. But with this, I'm not -- so losing weight is not the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work and constant struggle that it was before. Since other people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assure me that they were NOT hungry an hour after eating a big meal,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is strong (though only personal and anecdotal) evidence my body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanism doesn't work the same way that some other people's does.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're right on target about Dr. Atkins. The man is a hero.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep, he's killing off you hippos. Great,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should have got the Nobel Prize for that.
&gt;&gt;&gt; No evidence for that at all
&gt;&gt; Another lie. Guess what Atkins died of, stupid ?
&gt; A head injury after falling on the ice.

"/> Another lie. That was actually the result of a heart attack,
his second, AND he was obese at the time as well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; -- every time someone does a study to try to see
&gt;&gt;&gt; if this WOE is unhealthy, it comes up the opposite.
&gt;&gt; Another lie.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, as far as I know, there are not
&gt;&gt;&gt; long term studies (like 10 years or more),
&gt;&gt; Another lie with that sort of high fat diet.
&gt;&gt;&gt; but I figure losing weight has GOT to make me healthier!
&gt;&gt; Even someone as stupid as you should be able to grasp that
&gt;&gt; some ways of doing that like starvation can kill you, stupid.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He brought to light the true problem that cuases metabolic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disorder and it's symptoms (diabetes, CHD, obesity, fertility
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abnormalities, and other failings of endocrine/metabolic system).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pity you cant explain why obscene levels
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of obesity are a modern phenomena.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you don't like being confused with facts,
&gt;&gt; You wouldnt know what a fact was if it bit you on your lard arse, hippo.
&gt;&gt;&gt; but you might try actually reading the stuff he wrote;
&gt;&gt;&gt; he does, indeed, explain why levels of obesity are up.
&gt;&gt; Another lie. Quote it, hippo. We need another laugh.
&gt; Why bother? You obviously aren't interested.

"/> Even you should be able to bullshit your way out of
your predicament better than that pathetic effort, hippo.

&gt;think ones family who COOKS their meals and eats with them at most of the
&gt;meals (or who has a specific class setting in which the teachers know what
&gt;the child is eating) don't actually have a clue about the food intake?

"/> Im way behind on this discussion, but the commens above would most
certainly depend on hwere you live. MT thirteen year old could have
stopped at seven eleven on the way home or someplace else. They also
had the opportunity, had they any allowance or disposable income at

&gt;&gt;&gt;420-Pound Teen to Get Free Gastric Bypass

&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors and Hospital Offer Free Gastric Bypass Surgery for 420-Pound
&gt;&gt;&gt;Teenager
&gt;&gt;&gt;The Associated Press

&gt;&gt;&gt;HOUSTON Oct. 14, 2004 - Two doctors and a hospital offered a free gastric
&gt;&gt;&gt;bypass to a 420-pound teenager after another medical center canceled the
&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure because his insurance would not pay for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors at Obesity Surgery Specialists said 16-year-old Brandon Bennett
&gt;&gt;&gt;needs the operation for a chance at a healthy life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon is often sent home from school because of high blood pressure and
&gt;&gt;&gt;an elevated heart rate, and he is too big to be allowed on rides at Six
&gt;&gt;&gt;Flags Astroworld.

&gt;&gt;&gt;He had been set to have the bypass at Texas Children's Hospital in
&gt; Houston
&gt;&gt;&gt;this month, until the insurance issue surfaced. After the Houston
&gt; Chronicle
&gt;&gt;&gt;reported on his health problems, the obesity center contacted his family
&gt;&gt;&gt;this week.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Pending a final review of Brandon's medical records, the procedure will
&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;performed at Houston Community Hospital, which is also donating its
&gt;&gt;&gt;services, said Laurie Cantrell, bariatric program director at Obesity
&gt;&gt;&gt;Surgery Specialists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The so-called stomach-stapling surgery, which usually costs about
&gt; $25,000,
&gt;&gt;&gt;is considered a last resort for morbidly obese people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Doctors create an egg-sized pouch in the upper stomach and attach it to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;section of intestine, reducing how much food patients can eat. Risks of
&gt;&gt;&gt;surgery include malnutrition, stomach problems, infections and, rarely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Demand for gastric bypasses has soared following successful procedures by
&gt;&gt;&gt;celebrities such as broadcaster Al Roker and singer Carnie Wilson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Obesity Surgery Specialists has performed about 230 gastric bypasses in
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;last two years, though none were on adolescents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Brandon's father, Michael Bennett, said he has confidence in a surgical
&gt;&gt;&gt;team experienced in adult surgery because his son, who is 6-foot-2, has
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;physiology of a grown man.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I can't believe this is finally going to happen,&quot; Michael Bennett said.
&gt;&quot;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;didn't know people like this existed in the world.&quot;

&gt;&gt; One wonders if he learned his unhealthy and excessive eating habits
&gt;&gt; from his parents. I would venture a guess that they also are obese.
&gt;&gt; And I am not suggesting genetics is likely the cause.

operation to surgically mutilate his intestines. Studies have shown
that any weight lost in the short term will be regained in a few years
anyway and this person will then have to live not only with lowered

time would be far better spent in counselling and acceptance classes
not only for the teen but for the intolerant fat-hating bigots who
call themselves his family and friends. His parents should be jailed
for the psychological abuse in preventing him from accepting himself
and for the physical abuse inflicted upon his person in the form of
so-called ‘surgery'.

"/> I dunno if the surgery is the right thing or not. I presume the physicians have
applied their criteria in terms of the boy's health and the future success that
the operation will give him. Seems only responsibly chosen as a last resort,
though.

But I have to respond to the more plausible parts of your post (I'll leave out
the jail-abuse BS as beneath response) because it's crossposted to a lot of new
audiences.

What you are giving out here is the fat-acceptance nonsense. True, there's a
healthy acceptable range normal for people and people vary, but it does NOT
extend to obesity or even significantly overweight.

That studies have shown (jee, how many times to we hear &quot;studies show&quot;..) that
people regain weight has a lot to do with the fact that relatively few people
really incorporate the changes that they need to make as lifelong way of eating
and living. This is due to the common notion that eating beyond sustenance is
reasonable (because that other guy there who is skinny can do it), and that
dieting is about a period of penitence where one drops the weight, then can go
back to the old habits. If the population studied is that subset which
incorporates dietary changes and a good activity level for life, the &quot;studies
show&quot; statement would be quite different.

Obesity is unhealthy. It is not a human size variant. It threatens to become a
resource-overwhelming health debacle in the Western countries where it has (only
fairly recently!) become extremely common. It is not to be &quot;accepted&quot;. It is
to be cured.

"/> Although I think the ranges of &quot;healthy&quot; weight could probably be
extended in both directions (i.e., a little lower than currently
accepted and also a little higher), I do think that Banty is basically
correct. Obesity is unhealthy. It makes people die sooner than they
need to and often makes them suffer more discomfort while they do it.
This is a simple fact. That being said, I see nothing inherently wrong
with adults *choosing* to follow an unhealthy lifestyle when they
understand the risks of doing so (e.g., overeating to the point of
obesity, smoking cigarettes, drinking large quantities of alcohol, etc),
especially when they are prepared to shoulder the physical, emotional
and monetary costs of doing so.

This, however, is *not* the case with this teenager. He became obese
before he could give any real informed consent to it as a lifestyle
choice. He does not choose to be obese, he chooses to be normal weight
and is pursuing the last avenue open to him to achieve this. If an
obese person is *happy* to live with their obesity, informed of all of
the problems that it entails, then I feel that it is their prerogative
to live their life that way. Equally, if an obese person is *unhappy*
with their obesity and chooses a radical method of weight loss, informed
of all the problems that it entails, then I feel that it is their
prerogative to live their life *that* way. You can't have genuine 'fat
acceptance' without genuine 'normal weight acceptance'.

&gt; I dunno if the surgery is the right thing or not. I presume the physicians have
&gt; applied their criteria in terms of the boy's health and the future success that
&gt; the operation will give him. Seems only responsibly chosen as a last resort,
&gt; though.

&gt; But I have to respond to the more plausible parts of your post (I'll leave out
&gt; the jail-abuse BS as beneath response) because it's crossposted to a lot of new
&gt; audiences.

&gt; What you are giving out here is the fat-acceptance nonsense. True, there's a
&gt; healthy acceptable range normal for people and people vary, but it does NOT
&gt; extend to obesity or even significantly overweight.

&gt; That studies have shown (jee, how many times to we hear &quot;studies show&quot;..) that
&gt; people regain weight has a lot to do with the fact that relatively few people
&gt; really incorporate the changes that they need to make as lifelong way of eating
&gt; and living. This is due to the common notion that eating beyond sustenance is
&gt; reasonable (because that other guy there who is skinny can do it), and that
&gt; dieting is about a period of penitence where one drops the weight, then can go
&gt; back to the old habits. If the population studied is that subset which
&gt; incorporates dietary changes and a good activity level for life, the &quot;studies
&gt; show&quot; statement would be quite different.

&gt; Obesity is unhealthy. It is not a human size variant. It threatens to become a
&gt; resource-overwhelming health debacle in the Western countries where it has (only
&gt; fairly recently!) become extremely common. It is not to be &quot;accepted&quot;. It is
&gt; to be cured.

Bantly, I agree with you, people should not be that overweight, they
should eat right and excersize. Lifes to short not to take care of
yourself. I think he should have the operation, the doctors would give
it to him unless he needed it.
