I know of one person who showed up to Bucconeer Labor Day weekend,
only to discover it had been held weeks earlier.  At least people are
less likely to make that mistake these days, now that Worldcons move
around.

Speaking of moving around, curiously enough August 6-10 are also the
dates of the 2008 Worldcon.  Only once before have two consecutive
Worldcons been on the exact same dates (1946 - 1947).  The dates are
usually different if only because consecutive years never have the
same days of the week fall on the same dates.  Next year's Worldcon
will be held Wednesday through Sunday, 2009's Thursday through Monday.

I updated the appropriate Wikipiedia pages with the 2009 info.  In
doing so I noticed that the only Tom Doherty listed in Wikipedia is a
hockey player.  And not even a professional hockey player.  He's just
14.  I thought that odd, especially since all the links that point to
Tom Doherty's page are obviously intended to point to the publisher.
I see that that page *was* about the publisher until a few months ago,
at which point someone completely replaced it with badly written text
about a totally non-noteworthy teenager.  So I reverted it.  I see
that this had happened, and been reverted, once before.  I'll keep an
eye out for further vandalism to that page.

Not _totally_ different; &quot;Honour&quot; and &quot;honneur&quot; are basically the same

If Canada won't let me in, because by 2009 they have an instant
database that tells them I was convicted of a crime closer in time
to WWII than to the present, and the US won't let me back because my
passport has expired so I can't prove I didn't somehow lose my US
citizenship since it expired, life could get interesting for me.  I'd
have to stand right on the border forever.  Maybe I'd be allowed to
slowly sidle along it until I reached the ocean, then arrange for a
boat to pick me up and take me someplace sane.

You could probably hang in Peace Arch Park, near Vancouver. Some nice

I drove by the Peace Arch a couple of years ago.  (I was going to Vancouver for
a Country Dance &amp; Song Society Executive Committee meeeting, not that it
matters.)  Looked at the arch, slowly, from the car, since there was a backup
at the border crossing.  Got out of the car - I was a passenger, not driving -
went and looked at the inscription, rejoined the car, which had moved about 10
feet.

I took a moment wondering what the deal was with a Peace Arch in 1914, and how
ironic that was what with WWI on the horizon, and then I realized that it
commemorated the 100th anniversary of the end of the war of 1812.

And to put that another way, the frickin' war of 1812 was only 7 years further
downtime of the building of the arch than the building of the arch is downtime
from us today.  We pack a bunch of history into a short time on this side of
the Atlantic.

[The next year I got a little jolt at Jamestown, VA, looking at a plaque from
the &quot;Jamestown Jubilee&quot;, the big 200th anniversary celebration of the landing
that they held in 1807.  They had a big 300th anniversary celebration and
Exposition last century, and they, uh, rebuilt the visitor's center for this
year.]

Only on the US side.  Canada abolished hanging decades ago.

Anyhow, that would be quite a hike -- and swim -- along the border
from where I'd likely attempt to cross to get from DC to Montréal.

The I is actually an accented E.  (Note:  I believe that in French
French, capital letters aren't accented.) And leaving off the accents,

If I'm on a train heading back to the US after the '09 Worldcon, and
I'm not allowed to re-enter the US with my expired passport because,
hey, I can't prove I didn't somehow lose my US citizenship since it
expired, what then?  Do I just get off the train, walk a mile or two
parallel to the border, then cross on foot at a random place?  And
then what?  Hitchhike?

I don't understand what threat this is supposed to protect the
US from.  I know it's just security theater, of course, but any
theatrical production should tell some kind of coherent story.
Even &quot;Plan Nine From Outer Space&quot; does.

&gt;&gt;Yes, but you can't come back.

&gt;At worst you can't come back over a few of the more heavily traveled
&gt;border crossings.  There are innumerable places where you just drive
&gt;across the border on the honor system.

Well, some quibbling over the &quot;coherent&quot; part, but, otherwise agreed.

is excessively lenient.

Indeed, immigration is one of the few issues on which Bush has, on the
whole, been on the right side.

One possible explanation is that it occurred to him, or someone on his
team, just how much difference in the future balance between Republicans
and Democrats it would make if hispanics started consistently voting
Republican.

&gt; My personal pet immigration control plan is to build a sea-level

&gt; potential available funding, including vaporous, for unnecessary
&gt; foreign interventions.

And another canal along the northern border?  Make the US an island?
Maybe also a canal between each time zone within the US, with full
border controls along each?  Can't be too safe.  If any citizen
doesn't have a very good explanation for why he isn't at home, at
work, at church, or in transit between them, he should be interrogated
at length.  Especially if his travel papers aren't in order.

I don't think funding works that way, however.  More money to one
program doesn't mean less to another.  It either means higher taxes
or more government borrowing.  The latter of course competes with
investments in stocks, thus starving businesses of necessary capital
for growth, and causing widespread poverty.

&gt; And we could build bigger battleships.  The only reason the Iowa and
&gt; South Dakota class weren't bigger than they were is that the Panama
&gt; Canal locks couldn't accommodate Yamato-class-sized monstrosities,
&gt; Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 be damned.

I see.  No need to risk American soldiers to &quot;save&quot; Iraq.  Simply
&quot;save&quot; it with one large battleship off its coast, whose guns can
shell every part of that country.

Indeed, is was the Democrats' actions with Elian that lost the
Democrats much of the Hispanic vote in 2000.  Considering how close
the vote was in Florida, and how many of the voters there are Cuban
refugees who take a dim view of Castro's &quot;worker's paradise&quot; and of
anyone who would condemn an innocent child to such a fate, there's
absolutely no doubt that Bush would have lost had the Democrats
allowed Elian to remain in the US.
