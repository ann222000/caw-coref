Reuters and AFP report via Dawn that the assassination attempt on the
Minister of Education, reported here yesterday, was followed by another
such attempt against the Minister of the Environment, Mishkat Moumin.
Dawn quotes her:

' "Serving the Iraqi people is not a crime that deserves this," an
outraged Moumin said after the blast.

The attack shocked local residents. "I opened the door to leave for
work and the blast knocked me over," said Ali al Tai, standing in front
of his home only metres from the blast site where Moumin was targeted,
blood from victims splattered on his shirt. '

The Jordanian-led terrorist group, al-Tawhid, claimed credit for the
attempt.

Meanwhile, the US continued to bombard Mahdi Army positions in Najaf,
and to tighten their "squeeze" of the militiamen. Dawn writes,

'The advance was carried out by 50 Iraqi servicemen and came after US
helicopters fired missiles and strafed militants dug in at a cemetery
near the mosque, where most of the fighters have holed up since the
uprising in the city began three weeks ago.

A US soldier guided the men in. They were shot at by Mehdi militiamen
and returned fire. "We are in the last hours. This evening, Iraqi forces
will reach the doors of the shrine and control it and appeal to the
Mehdi Army to throw down their weapons," Defence Minister Hazim al
Shalaan said at a US army base outside Najaf. "If they do not, we will
wipe them out." '

I saw Shaalan speaking in Arabic on al-Jazeerah, and he said, "If
Muqtada al-Sadr will surrender himself, that would be superb. He will be
given safe passage and treated with perfect respect. But if he refuses,
he will face either death or prison." or words to that effect.
Obviously, the al-Hayat report that PM Iyad Allawi was trying to rein in
Shaalan was incorrect; either that, or Shaalan has more pull with the
Americans than Allawi does.

Some Sadr spokesmen rejected Shaalan's offer, with one calling it
"garbage." Others seemed more conciliatory.

The Mahdi Army fighters appeared to be thinning out at the Shrine of
Ali. Al-Jazeerah also had footage of the Iraqi army moving into position
in the Old City of Najaf. Interestingly, the anchors were saying that
the coming confrontation would be between two sets of Iraqis. I would
have expected them to insist that the Iraqi forces were just American
proxies, but at least on Wednesday evening EST that wasn't their line.

Muslim political and religious figures continued to denounce the US
actions in Najaf on Tuesday, as a form of desecration of a holy place.
The speaker of Iran's parliament said the actions were spreading hatred
for the US in the region. Pakistani satellite tv said that the Pakistani
senate had passed a resolution demanding that all foreign troops leave
the holy city of Najaf. The Pakistani senate is a generally conservative
body, dominated by landlords and by supporters of the pro-American
"president," Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf met Tuesday with Bosnian
President Sulejman Tihic , who delivered a speech praising the United
States for saving the Bosnian Muslims from certain genocide. So these
aren't reflexively anti-American political circles there in Islamabad,
but the senators are disturbed by the American role in the Najaf events.

Muqtada and his main aides have disappeared from the shrine, as I had
predicted they would. As I suggested, there are probably underground
tunnels. Muqtada has plenty of safe houses in Iraq, since he eluded
Saddam for four years, and he won't be easy to find if he doesn't want
to be found.

My guess is that the Sadr Movement will now go into an active, long
term guerrilla resistance. They will hope that bombings and
assassinations will give heart to the public and provide a model for
resisting what they see as the occupation. They will hope for an
Algeria-style end game, in which the Americans and British are tossed
out of Iraq. The drawback for the Mahdi Army is that they are just
untrained Shiite ghetto youth, with perhaps a few older vets among them,
and their ability to wage an effective guerrilla struggle is untested.
So far they have fought far more stupidly than the resistance fighters
in the Sunni Arab areas, attempting to take and hold territory and
behaving like a mainstream army but without the necessary skill set.

If they move in this direction, they will at least have moral support
of a wide range of Sunni and Shiite clerics , who jointly called for all
Muslims to support the resistance to what they call the US occupation of
Iraq. The signatories include prominent figures in the Sunni Egyptian
Muslim Brotherhood, in Lebanon's Shiite Hizbullah, and in Yemen's Sunni
fundamentalist movement. Most of the clerics signing the call want an
Islamic state in their country, with Islamic law the law of the land,
and so can be called fundamentalists. But most of them are not radicals
in the sense of wanting a violent and immediate revolution. Some, like
Yusuf Qaradawi, explicitly permitted Muslims to fight against the
Taliban in Afghanistan in the US military or alongside it. But Qaradawi
and the others see Iraq in a different light, as an Arab, Muslim society
that has been colonized by an outside force, the US.

The low intensity guerrilla fighting in Amara against the British
base, which left at least 12 dead and 54 wounded there, may be a sign of
things to come. There were also clashes in the southern oil port of
Basra.
