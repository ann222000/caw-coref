Hi all

My Landy ('89 110 V8) has eventually eaten up its Panhard Rod Bushes (as in totally, to the extend that it is quite exiting to keep it in a reasonably straight line at speed, in fact it is metal-on-metal in there!). I guess it will also be prudent to change the radius arm bushes at the same time. My plan is to replace the Panhard Rod bushes with hard poly-U bushes (for maximum directional stability), but the radius arm bushes with standard rubber (for articulation).

Any suggestion of places where I can hunt the PU panhard rod bushes down without having to buy a complete kit? And are the rubber in the radius arm bushes sold by CCA and/or Dover of OE quality? Any other suggestions?

And before I forget, I need to change the front crankshaft seal. The oil coming out there (~250 ml/1000 km) is great for rust proofing and territory marking, but it is probably one of the reasons why the bushes went south. Can the crankshaft pulley and seal safely be removed without removing the radiator?

Cheers
Mike N

Rather use OE bushes on the Panhard rod.  they are not horrendously expensive and it is a critical safety item.  any movement there gets amplified inthe opposite direction by the steering linkage.

Hi James

You've said this before, and it is what you experienced.  I've experienced
the opposite with the locally made yellow ones - when the radius arm bushes
started showing wear after 4 years, the panhard rod bushes hardly showed any
wear.  Stability with these hard bushes was great, and in the panhard rod
they do not contribute to a hard ride.

I installed the imported blue bushes about 18 months ago, and so far so good
- will see how long these last.  I think you mentioned that you had high
wear with these?  Maybe there are different qualities out there?  I must say
that the blue bushes give a softer ride than the hard yellow ones, while
road stability is nearly as good as with the yellow ones, certainly a lot
better than the OE rubber ones.

Cheers
Mike

I had only good service with the yellow panhard rod bushes on my Rangie,
much more oil resistant and the panhard rod bushes mainly accomodates
rotation, unlike the other suspension bushes that is more constrained and
has to absorb movement along a few axis.

My take on it is that the OE panhard rod bushes are NOT suitable for a
safety critical item, they disolve in no time when drinking oil and loosing
sterring accuracy in the process.

I really can't relate to this discussion! My Defender is 10 years and
283,000 km old, suffered greatly at times, has leaked copious amounts of oil
and despite or because of religious servicing the issue of Panhard rod
bushes never arose. And I feel very safe ;-).

How old are your cars?

My experience with a set of blue polybushes in my Panhard rod was that they wore themselves stukkend inside the joint but nothing was visible from outside.  The resulting dynamic instability in the steering mechanism occurred suddenly and unpredictably at speeds above 80 km/h.   A tiny bump in the road could set it off and then you thought you were going to die because the car was shaking so violently that it blurred my vision and I couldnt control it.
There may be various types of the softer blue polybushes out there and yours may not be the same as mine but I wont use blue ones again in this application...the harder yellow ones maybe.
The OE bushes wear faster..yes...but they have inner and outer metal sleeves and some clearance between the rod and mounting brackets.   when they get worn you can see it becos they go visibly off-centre and a crowbar test will confirm if you take the weight off the joint.  Sadly, a decent press is required to replace them whereas polybushes can be done with a bench vice and some lube.
If you want to use polybushes for the Panhard rod then I would agree that harder is better and should not compromise ride comfort.  but please inspect carefully by trying to flex the joints at each service...do it with the old ones first to get a reference for what they feel like when worn.

Apr 1997 110 CSW just about to clock 480 000 km, owned since Oct 98 with
52000km on the clock when bought (ex LRSA).

Done the radius arm bushes about 3 or 4 times, most recently last month,
panhard bushes never.

Curiously my steering is more vague and has always been so compared to my
wifes 98 110 hicap which is sitting on about 240 000km. We have owned this
one since April 2006 and bought it from a Game Farm near Lydenburg (PO's
being them and a Middelberg mielie boer) so I expected that we would have to
pay attention to same which has not been necessary so far.

I did a complete inspection on mine recently, as I thought that they were
shot due to the wandering of the landie.  Took them off, but they were still
like new (have only done about 60k km on them).

It turned out that the tyres were the cause.  I had 235 BFG Ats, and had run
the shoulders down more than the centre due to a combination of too low
pressure and wheel-alignment.  So I ran them pretty hard, and managed to get
quite a bit more mileage out of them, at the expense of a hard ride.  But
due to the different thread thickness distribution, they caused the vehicle
to follow the slightest irregularities in the road.  This disappeared with
the new tyres.

When I recently asked the guys at LP4A about these blue polybushes they said
that they had very few come backs, and virtually no extra sales of the
panhard rod bushes, compared to the other ones.  So I'm hoping that they are
of a different compound to the ones you had.  Hopefully I can report back in
three year's time:-)

I must add that I won't replace the ones on the radius arms (plus the ones
at the back) with yellow ones, as the blue ones are much better off-road.
If the panhard rod bushes go south prematurely, they will be replaced with
the yellow ones.

Mike

Hi to all the Canonites on the forum

I have a Canon EF-70-200 F/4 L USM lens that I am selling.  It's in perfect
condition and if you're interested let me know off line.

It has all the original stuff like the box, lens bag etc.

I'm in NY, but my wife will be traveling to SA early next month if anyone's
interested.  It is still under a US warranty until 16 Sept.

Regards,
Gideon

Amen to that. Seeping ATF eat/dissolve through the OEM rubber Panhard
bushes in no time. Had to replace mine about every year. Cheaper than
replacing the leaking power-steering box :-))

Greetings,

I was speaking to some of the guys who are into Off-road Challenge Events in
the UK with their Land Rovers. They reckon they prefer the original rubber
bushes as a rule because when the polybushes go they tend to split and you
end up with metal on metal which often means they can't finish the stage in
which they are competing. On the other hand the original rubber bushes give
you some warning that they are about to go and they reckon they will at
least be able to finish the event. Obviously these Land Rovers are getting a
beating which may not be entirely relevant to everyday driving but
interesting.

I also phoned Safari Centre a while ago for a price on a Polybush set and
they suggested I contact my Land Rover agent first which I thought was
strange. It seemed that they were reluctant to supply the Polybush kit to
Land Rovers as they have had some comebacks. Anyone else had this problem?

Cheers,
David

My Defender is 1994 with 320 000km on the clock.
And I never let the oil leaks get bad enough to mess up the panhard rod
bushes.
I also felt very safe until I was cruising along the freeway one day with my
girlfriend and her 2 kids in the car when it suddenly went apesh!t on me and
I nearly rolled the damn thing.

In reality, some mixture of hard and soft bushes is probably the ideal
solution.   the hard yellow ones restrict articulation (if that is important
to your type of driving) and give a hard ride but they improve directional
stability in a big way.   In very hard off-roading they may be too stiff and
I had heard of radius arm mounts being ripped off the chassis by them.

The softer blue ones give a nice ride  until they wear, after which you get
a very slopy ride.  I think they are fine for suspension but prefer
something harder for the transverse locating links like panhard rod and rear
triangle.    the OE bushes are great when new but deteriorate somewhat from
day 1.

If you are looking at a set of polybushes and you can easily flex them in
your hands then they are too soft.  the blues ones I had were like this, too
soft.  I subsequently saw another set of blue ones that were fairly stiff
but still softer than yellow ones i fitted to my first Defender.

Spot on. I'll keep this in mind as I'll be changing some of the bushes on my
Landy shortly. Will keep a note on when and what for future reference.

Shooo, that's old, respek! I also bought my '97 2nd hand in 1999 at
21,000km.

I'm sure you know that vagueness is also influenced by tyre type and
pressure, type and condition of dampers and springs, vehicle weight, weight
height, infinitely variable manual construction tolerance etc.

Francois
