After seeing the tech report on the electric shifters from Campy used
in this  year's Tour, wondering if Sheldon (or others) had any info or
opinions on them...

Cheers!

Well, since electric shifters are still just &quot;prototypes,&quot; I doubt
Sheldon or anybody else has seen or tried them to be able to form an
opinion.

For more info, I would just follow the various cycling sites like
www.cyclingnews.com

In fact, here's a few write ups:

To keep abreast of all things Campy, check out the &quot;rumors&quot; page at

So, what does that have to do with anything? Obviously, the Mavic
version was a failure.

Its 2007, both Campy and Shimano have electronic shifting. Let's see
how well they perform!  But, until something appears that is more than
just a prototype, I wouldn't get too worked up.

My guess is that, if electronic shifting is successful, we will see
the return of half-step gearing.  A ten speed cluster is pretty much
the limit.  Right now you can run straight cassettes (12-21) with a
compact crank, cover the racing range, and not have any place to add
another gear.  But, if you went to half step (or 1/3 step triples
anyone?), you suddenly have double density.  You could have a twist
dail that calculates where to throw the chain depending upon how much
you twist it.  Nearly continuous gearing...

The noteworthy thing is that both companies have been sneaking this
technology onto pro bikes for a couple of years. I suspect it partly
exists as a tactical research project: neither company may believe their
system is ready for prime time, but both need a hedge against the other
company introducing the thing.

It sucks horribly. It's another thing that's unnecessary in any kind
of practical sense but gives a significant enough advantage in a race
to be relevant there. It's more electronic shit to be produced in a
world that really doesn't need it. It is yet another thing that pushes
bikes as a whole, and road bikes in particular, in the more expensive
direction. It's going to be a milestone in componentry that doesn't
interchange well or at all. And it's main function, in the end, is
going to be to further cater to and enthrone the typical consumer's
moronic fears and confusions about shifting.

The way things are going, in 6-8 years from now it probably will have
trickled down into around 105/Centaur/Veloce level groups. That's the
point where Shimano and Campy's production of decent quality
components that don't use it will begin to get dicey. Not stop
outright, but options will start drying up, never to come back. I bet
mechanical non-Escape Ergos will be gone a few years before that.
Mechanical 9 and 10 speed bar-end shifters made by Shimano and Campy
will become extinct. Hopefully someone else will fill in some of the
holes.

Just my own guesses, of course, but it's sort of the way things work
right now...

listen to the retro-grouch whiners!  they sound like the retrogrouch
whiners that complained about electronic ignition.  they sound like the
retrogrouch whiners that complained about fuel injection.  they sound
like the retrogrouch whiners that complained about the death of the abacus.

point is, all this stuff has to do is pass two simple tests.

1. does it work as well as the old stuff?
2. does it offer any improvement?

imo, if it's smart enough to trim itself to not need adjustment thereby
passing test #2, it'll be a winner.  anything that takes the idiot
factor out of the lbs is a good thing.

Exactly.

One good thing is that you can put the shifter buttons on multiple
locations.
So you always have a shifter handy no matter where you hands are on

Well, not everyone is an old fart on a bike like you.  Some who read here
may be racers, as in that 0.1% remaining.  How many could that be?  Don't
know, but it sure doesn't include you.  When you are racing, RACING, it may
just count, and work, and contribute to a better result.  Don't worry - your
trip to the supermarket is not included.  Shift with any available
appendage, even if not in current use.

And that *may* be a benefit to those who actually race (i.e., poseurs,

well there could be numerous benefits in time, such that we'll shake
our head remembering the old days how we used to do it. consider, a
small watch battery to operate the derailer; there is no spring
tension to overcome, just a small actuator would engage and your
padaling will cause the gear shift- so you'd have considerable weight
savings AND reliability- no cable stretch, grime in the shifters or
the cables; the derailer could be a completely sealed unit. you could
wear your shifter as a ring so it's always at hand- combine that with
bluetooth disc brakes and you can see there are a lot of possibilities
to look forward to.

Don't be paranoid, Ozark. Racers, techies and 20-milers are legitimate
riders. My point is that for every retrogrouch, tourer or &quot;Riv-ite&quot;
who scoffs at electronics on bicycles, there's a much larger majority
of buyers that will love it. I personally think being able to lightly
tap a button in several different locations to execute a shift is
pretty nifty. I wouldn't want to rely on it in a tour through the
Amazon, but I think it would be fine for most day rides. If you can
carry a spare tube, you can carry a spare battery.

&gt;&gt; point is, all this stuff has to do is pass two simple tests.

&gt;&gt; 1. does it work as well as the old stuff?
&gt;&gt; 2. does it offer any improvement?

&gt;&gt; imo, if it's smart enough to trim itself to not need adjustment thereby

&gt; well there could be numerous benefits in time, such that we'll shake
&gt; our head remembering the old days how we used to do it. consider, a
&gt; small watch battery to operate the derailer; there is no spring
&gt; tension to overcome, just a small actuator would engage and your
&gt; padaling will cause the gear shift- so you'd have considerable weight
&gt; savings AND reliability- no cable stretch, grime in the shifters or
&gt; the cables; the derailer could be a completely sealed unit. you could
&gt; wear your shifter as a ring so it's always at hand- combine that with
&gt; bluetooth disc brakes and you can see there are a lot of possibilities

I find both of these very useful. I don't race, but I go out with racers

But, as with racing, your application (a double century) doesn't have
much to do with the vast majority of cyclists, even sport cyclists.

As with everything, there's the question of benefits versus
detriments.  Marketing succeeds by touting the benefits, and marketing
gets the big budget and the magazine space, both in ads and in
articles.  Discussions like this that point out the detriments - but
most sport cyclists see only the &quot;Gee Whiz!&quot; reviews in Buycycling.
(Ever notice how few of their &quot;verdicts&quot; are negative?)

I'm familiar enough with electrical problems on bikes, just regarding
cyclometers, headlights and taillights, that I'd want nothing to do
with electric shifting.  I've had batteries go weak or die, or lose
contact on hitting a bump.  I've had intermittent electrical contact
through corrosion at connections.  I've had wires snag and either
unplug or break.  I've spent time tediously splicing hair-thin
cyclometer wires.  I've had short or open circuits that were a puzzle
to locate.

Risk those things affecting my shifting, for the benefit of not moving
my hands?  No thanks.

It's not that _nobody_ really makes use of them.  In my mind, the
issue is that _everybody_ becomes convinced they need them, and that
bicycling is terrible without them.  Most riders never learn the
detriments until too late - detriments like getting high gears they'll
never need, and missing low gears they could really use.  Or having
expensive, unrepairable mechanisms on an otherwise beautifully simple
machine.  Or wading into the seas of incompatibility.

For some, the tradeoff is worth it.  But many more just get suckered.

It's roughly comparable to marketing 5000 pound, 400 horsepower four-
wheel-drive SUVs to family buyers, using images of SUVs clambering
over boulders.  Most buyers simply don't need the capability that's
being advertised as essential.

True, up to a point.

But when your bike is old enough to be called a &quot;classic,&quot; do you
suppose your shifters will still work?

&gt; &gt; What the heck?  Double click...  Double click... Nothing??

I don't think it succeed, unless, as I said, they integrate the front
and rear shifting and use a half step setup to double the gear
density.  It simply doesn't add anything Bowden cable doesn't
provide.  And you will not be able to use button batteries because,
unlike a speedometer, you have to do actual mechanical lifting.
Remember, no one uses aero seatposts these days...

It could be the basis for an &quot;automatic&quot; drivetrain, but unless they
figure out how to clutch it, shifting under load will eat chains like
crazy.  (Hmm, yet another upside for the manufacturers...;)  And you
still wouldn't want it shifting for you in the middle of an
intersection...  So at best it would light up and suggest you consider
shifting, and that capacity could be provided with last year's
cyclometers and nobody has yet...

Sorry, I meant good for recharges for at least a year. Although now

advance in entertainment, my friend who owns a software company said
no way, a cd holds way too much memory; now i can put 4 cds without

technology advances irregardless; and it will advance whether there be
a market for it or not- it will create it's own demand. You will have

While considering Raam's sucker's bet ( - if existence will be used to
prove the likelyhood, Raam has already won, as Mavic sold e-shifters a
decade ago - ), I read some descriptions of the Mektronic derailleur.

According to the reviewer, it shifted flawlessly under load.  This
puzzled me, as derailling the chain under heavy load is not the
problem, but rather the abrupt and forceful disengagement of one cog
and engagement of the next when the chain reaches the top of the
cluster.  But thinking about it some more, I supose if one metered the
cassette, one could shift onto the &quot;glide ramp&quot; every time resulting
is a very clean transition.  I'm not persuaded Mavic was actually
doing this, but I have to concede there is a possibility for
improvement over manual shifting.

Dear Frank,

Progress toward the flying bicycle is a bit slow, but surely we can
expect a practical product by 2047, judging by these two data points:

I'm sure there is room for improvement, especially for fast shifts and
for automatic trimming.

Many less technically minded cyclists don't get on too well with
derailleurs. They often end up clanking away between two gears not
knowing what, if anything, is wrong, nor how to rectify the problem.
Indexed shifting has made riding easier for many people I think even
though personally I quite liked the old friction levers.

Hub gears are a good solution, but until recently there wasn't a wide
enough range of gears on them, and I suspect they're also rather
expensive.

There are other possibilities with an electronic system like &quot;automatic&quot;
gears.

I don't like the idea of a battery though, some kind of super-capacitor
that could charge itself up somehow from the motion of the bike would be
preferable.

They could also be quite a bit lighter because there's a lot more gubbins
in an STI shifter than in a push button. And, as someone else mentioned,
more ergonomic. Possibly cheaper too.
