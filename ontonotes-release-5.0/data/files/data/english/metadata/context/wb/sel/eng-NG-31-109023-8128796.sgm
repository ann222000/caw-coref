I really do wonder why you use &quot;nazi&quot; in the pejorative

you publicly declared that you don't blame them for the Holocaust.

So,  how come you're using &quot;nazi&quot; as an insult?  Is this

'You have no future in this country'
By Daniel Ben Simon

At the height of the fury and the humiliation, the children of Hebron
wandered around among the men in uniform, trying to figure out who was
Jewish and who was not - who is from &quot;our&quot; seed, and who is from the
seed of Amalek. At a time when most Israeli children were spending
their summer vacation at day camps and on trips, splashing in the sea
and in swimming pools, the children of the Hebron day camp looked as
though they lived on another planet. Glowering with hatred, with huge
skullcaps and long curly earlocks, children age 10 and younger walked
among the men in uniform and examined their dog tags.

Anyone whose non-Jewishness was discovered received the appropriate
treatment: The wild, bleary-eyed little ones mercilessly hurled curses
and insults at them. They are mere children and already experts in
racial theory. Every possible epithet was hurled at the soldiers, but
they, perhaps on orders from above, were silent as though catatonic.
Their faces showed no emotion.

The children of Hebron are very reminiscent of the children at the
summer camps of Jesus - those who live in America's Bible Belt, who
have been poisoned by religious ideology and have become the spearhead
of Christian fundamentalism.

&quot;If someone comes to kill you, kill him first!&quot; shouted one of the
children at a Border Policeman with a non-Jewish name [both Russian
and Ethiopian immigrants and Druze were among the security units
present], moments after the evacuation of the families from the market
began on Tuesday. The youngster brought his face close to that of the
soldier until they were almost touching. &quot;It says in the Torah that I
have to kill you. You are from the seed of Amalek ... You are a goy
[gentile] and you are not allowed to tread on this holy ground. Get
out of here, you and your friends!&quot;

A &quot;Jewish&quot; soldier tries to calm down the rebellious child, and in
response is treated to a barrage of curses: &quot;You're not Jewish at all.
You're a Nazi. We'll kill you and all the Nazis who are here.&quot; Other
children, dripping with hatred, surround the group of soldiers and
observe them with amusement, as in a zoo. Their mothers sit on the
side and observe their glorious progeny, barely concealing their
enjoyment.

Several meters away, a woman named Anat Cohen is trying to disrupt the
evacuation of one of the houses. Emaciated, barefoot, wearing a head-
covering, she mercilessly curses the soldiers. While she is still
shouting, salvos are heard nearby: The Palestinians in the city are
celebrating the end of the matriculation exams and are firing in joy.
The Jews are convinced that these shots represent Schadenfreude, and
Cohen becomes hysterical: &quot;Get up, dogs!&quot; she shouts at dozens of
security personnel. &quot;Get up! They're firing in your honor so stand up
in their honor. The Arab enemy is firing salvos in your honor, for
what you are doing to the Jews.&quot;

A father and son, ultra-Orthodox Jews from New York, look at the
destroyed shops and their hearts fill with sadness. They speak Yiddish
to each other; the son, Shmuel Landau, photographs the soldiers who
are sprawled in every shady corner. Now it is 10 A.M. and the
evacuation has been completed. The soldiers from the Home Front
Command are sawing and dismantling and sealing up every possible
opening in order to prevent the evacuees from settling in again.

Shmuel plans to show the pictures to his friends from the Amshinov
Hasidic sect in the United States, which numbers only a few hundred
followers in Israel. &quot;They aren't Jews,&quot; he says, pointing at the
hundreds of men in uniform. &quot;We are the real Jews.&quot; His father nods in
agreement: &quot;You're asking about the soldiers, so I'll tell you. They
aren't Jews. Look at them, they're Russians, Ethiopians and Druze. And
even those who call themselves Jews are not Jews. They're Zionists and
leftists.&quot;

&quot;Israel's big problem is Zionism,&quot; continues Shmuel. &quot;It severed the
Jews from the Torah and from Jewish values. You have no future in this
country. In the end you'll all leave and only we will remain here.&quot;

&quot;Israeli&quot; is a dirty word in this hate-crazed enclave in Hebron. Not
one of the hundreds of residents here defines himself as such, as
though Israel were a penal colony. Even after the state has showered
them with protection, resources, assistance and even sympathy, these
people consider Israel to be a foreign government. Israeli sovereignty
has replaced the sovereignty of halakha (Jewish law) and in that way
has decreed for itself the status of an enemy in every respect.

Except for the presence of the soldiers, there is no sign here of
Israeliness, everything is Jewish: the street names, the hateful
slogans painted on the shops of the Palestinians, the long beards, the
skullcaps. There is dirt in every corner and the Hebrew spoken here is
poor as well. There are no secular books and no Israeli culture here.
Most of the children have never set foot on the soil of Israel per se,
and most of the adults have been there only rarely, mainly for medical
treatments, family celebrations and consolation visits to mourners.

&quot;I have nothing to talk to you about, you are not my nation and you
are not part of my nation,&quot; declared one of the veteran residents of
Hebron's Jewish Quarter, who wished to remain anonymous. &quot;You are my
enemies and I pray for the day when we will get our revenge for what
you did to us in Gush Katif and what you're doing to us in Hebron. I
hate you more than the Arabs. You will pay forever for what you did.&quot;
He is 53 and a father of eight. On the day of the evacuation this
week, he got up early and reported to the battlefield with his
children.

&quot;We didn't go all the way with you because we decided to wage a
passive war,&quot; he said. &quot;We are leaving the major war for the end. You
have no future in this country, so tell your friends to make use of
the time still left to them. We will be victorious with the bellies of
our women.&quot;

Crisis of faith

The disengagement from Gush Katif gave rise to a crisis of faith of a
kind that the settlers have not experienced since the 1967 Six-Day
War. Even in their worst nightmares they didn't imagine that the
government would go all the way and uproot Jews from the &quot;holy&quot; ground
of Gaza. For years they became accustomed, or to be more precise were
allowed to become accustomed, to dictating to the government how to
behave. Suddenly former prime minister Ariel Sharon came onto the
scene and changed the modus operandi. Even at the height of the crisis
they followed the words of the rabbis, who declared &quot;It will never
happen,&quot; believing that in the last moment a miracle would occur and
prevent the decree. Since the disengagement many settlers have severed
themselves from the outside world. The shock of the uprooting is a
still-oozing scar.

Already during the first attempt to go up to the evacuated West Bank
settlement of Homesh, about half a year ago, the weakness of the
government vis-a-vis the rabbis' determination became evident. One
thread, as strong as steel, links the evacuation of Amona to the
ascent to Homesh, to the attempt to return to the destroyed Gush Katif
settlements and to the events of Hebron: a determination to erase the
disgrace of the disengagement from the settlers' consciousness. They
will never again evacuate willingly, they will never again go like
sheep to the slaughter. In light of this, the hatred for the state and
its institutions has increased, and the status of the fundamentalist
rabbis, many of them members of the rabbinical council of Yesha (Judea
and Samaria), has been strengthened even further.

Two years after the evacuation from Gush Katif the government is
facing an internal threat with strategic implications for its future
image. This is a fateful moment in the tense coexistence between those
who favor secular values and those who cherish halakha. It is not
clear whether hundreds of thousands of skullcap-wearers will continue
to see themselves as part of the state if a peace accord is reached
that will require a major evacuation of West Bank land.

In such a case the army, which is a reflection of the society in which
it lives, will posit an existential dilemma between those who favor
the sovereignty of the state and those who favor the sovereignty of
the halakha. For the first time since the territories were annexed to
the State of Israel in the Six-Day War, it seems that Israel will not
be able to avoid this expected confrontation. The first signs were
seen this week during the evacuation of Hebron, when dozens of
soldiers preferred the halakhic decision of rabbis to orders from
their commanders.

in their honor. The Arab enemy is firing salvos in your honor, for
what you are doing to the Jews.&quot;

A father and son, ultra-Orthodox Jews from New York, look at the
destroyed shops and their hearts fill with sadness. They speak Yiddish
to each other; the son, Shmuel Landau, photographs the soldiers who
are sprawled in every shady corner. Now it is 10 A.M. and the
evacuation has been completed. The soldiers from the Home Front
Command are sawing and dismantling and sealing up every possible
opening in order to prevent the evacuees from settling in again.

Shmuel plans to show the pictures to his friends from the Amshinov
Hasidic sect in the United States, which numbers only a few hundred
followers in Israel. &quot;They aren't Jews,&quot; he says, pointing at the
hundreds of men in uniform. &quot;We are the real Jews.&quot; His father nods in
agreement: &quot;You're asking about the soldiers, so I'll tell you. They
aren't Jews. Look at them, they're Russians, Ethiopians and Druze. And
even those who call themselves Jews are not Jews. They're Zionists and
leftists.&quot;

&quot;Israel's big problem is Zionism,&quot; continues Shmuel. &quot;It severed the
Jews from the Torah and from Jewish values. You have no future in this
country. In the end you'll all leave and only we will remain here.&quot;

&quot;Israeli&quot; is a dirty word in this hate-crazed enclave in Hebron. Not
one of the hundreds of residents here defines himself as such, as
though Israel were a penal colony. Even after the state has showered
them with protection, resources, assistance and even sympathy, these
people consider Israel to be a foreign government. Israeli sovereignty
has replaced the sovereignty of halakha (Jewish law) and in that way
has decreed for itself the status of an enemy in every respect.

Except for the presence of the soldiers, there is no sign here of
Israeliness, everything is Jewish: the street names, the hateful
slogans painted on the shops of the Palestinians, the long beards, the
skullcaps. There is dirt in every corner and the Hebrew spoken here is
poor as well. There are no secular books and no Israeli culture here.
Most of the children have never set foot on the soil of Israel per se,
and most of the adults have been there only rarely, mainly for medical
treatments, family celebrations and consolation visits to mourners.

&quot;I have nothing to talk to you about, you are not my nation and you
are not part of my nation,&quot; declared one of the veteran residents of
Hebron's Jewish Quarter, who wished to remain anonymous. &quot;You are my
enemies and I pray for the day when we will get our revenge for what
you did to us in Gush Katif and what you're doing to us in Hebron. I
hate you more than the Arabs. You will pay forever for what you did.&quot;
He is 53 and a father of eight. On the day of the evacuation this
week, he got up early and reported to the battlefield with his
children.

&quot;We didn't go all the way with you because we decided to wage a
passive war,&quot; he said. &quot;We are leaving the major war for the end. You
have no future in this country, so tell your friends to make use of
the time still left to them. We will be victorious with the bellies of
our women.&quot;

Crisis of faith

The disengagement from Gush Katif gave rise to a crisis of faith of a
kind that the settlers have not experienced since the 1967 Six-Day
War. Even in their worst nightmares they didn't imagine that the
government would go all the way and uproot Jews from the &quot;holy&quot; ground
of Gaza. For years they became accustomed, or to be more precise were
allowed to become accustomed, to dictating to the government how to
behave. Suddenly former prime minister Ariel Sharon came onto the
scene and changed the modus operandi. Even at the height of the crisis
they followed the words of the rabbis, who declared &quot;It will never
happen,&quot; believing that in the last moment a miracle would occur and
prevent the decree. Since the disengagement many settlers have severed
themselves from the outside world. The shock of the uprooting is a
still-oozing scar.

Already during the first attempt to go up to the evacuated West Bank
settlement of Homesh, about half a year ago, the weakness of the
government vis-a-vis the rabbis' determination became evident. One
thread, as strong as steel, links the evacuation of Amona to the
ascent to Homesh, to the attempt to return to the destroyed Gush Katif
settlements and to the events of Hebron: a determination to erase the
disgrace of the disengagement from the settlers' consciousness. They
will never again evacuate willingly, they will never again go like
sheep to the slaughter. In light of this, the hatred for the state and
its institutions has increased, and the status of the fundamentalist
rabbis, many of them members of the rabbinical council of Yesha (Judea
and Samaria), has been strengthened even further.

Two years after the evacuation from Gush Katif the government is
facing an internal threat with strategic implications for its future
image. This is a fateful moment in the tense coexistence between those
who favor secular values and those who cherish halakha. It is not
clear whether hundreds of thousands of skullcap-wearers will continue
to see themselves as part of the state if a peace accord is reached
that will require a major evacuation of West Bank land.

In such a case the army, which is a reflection of the society in which
it lives, will posit an existential dilemma between those who favor
the sovereignty of the state and those who favor the sovereignty of
the halakha. For the first time since the territories were annexed to
the State of Israel in the Six-Day War, it seems that Israel will not
be able to avoid this expected confrontation. The first signs were
seen this week during the evacuation of Hebron, when dozens of
soldiers preferred the halakhic decision of rabbis to orders from
their commanders.

You want substance, here it is straight from Haaretz

'You have no future in this country'
By Daniel Ben Simon

At the height of the fury and the humiliation, the children of Hebron
wandered around among the men in uniform, trying to figure out who was
Jewish and who was not - who is from &quot;our&quot; seed, and who is from the
seed of Amalek. At a time when most Israeli children were spending
their summer vacation at day camps and on trips, splashing in the sea
and in swimming pools, the children of the Hebron day camp looked as
though they lived on another planet. Glowering with hatred, with huge
skullcaps and long curly earlocks, children age 10 and younger walked
among the men in uniform and examined their dog tags.

Anyone whose non-Jewishness was discovered received the appropriate
treatment: The wild, bleary-eyed little ones mercilessly hurled curses
and insults at them. They are mere children and already experts in
racial theory. Every possible epithet was hurled at the soldiers, but
they, perhaps on orders from above, were silent as though catatonic.
Their faces showed no emotion.

The children of Hebron are very reminiscent of the children at the
summer camps of Jesus - those who live in America's Bible Belt, who
have been poisoned by religious ideology and have become the spearhead
of Christian fundamentalism.

&quot;If someone comes to kill you, kill him first!&quot; shouted one of the
children at a Border Policeman with a non-Jewish name [both Russian
and Ethiopian immigrants and Druze were among the security units
present], moments after the evacuation of the families from the market
began on Tuesday. The youngster brought his face close to that of the
soldier until they were almost touching. &quot;It says in the Torah that I
have to kill you. You are from the seed of Amalek ... You are a goy
[gentile] and you are not allowed to tread on this holy ground. Get
out of here, you and your friends!&quot;

A &quot;Jewish&quot; soldier tries to calm down the rebellious child, and in
response is treated to a barrage of curses: &quot;You're not Jewish at all.
You're a Nazi. We'll kill you and all the Nazis who are here.&quot; Other
children, dripping with hatred, surround the group of soldiers and
observe them with amusement, as in a zoo. Their mothers sit on the
side and observe their glorious progeny, barely concealing their
enjoyment.

Several meters away, a woman named Anat Cohen is trying to disrupt the
evacuation of one of the houses. Emaciated, barefoot, wearing a head-
covering, she mercilessly curses the soldiers. While she is still
shouting, salvos are heard nearby: The Palestinians in the city are
celebrating the end of the matriculation exams and are firing in joy.
The Jews are convinced that these shots represent Schadenfreude, and
Cohen becomes hysterical: &quot;Get up, dogs!&quot; she shouts at dozens of
security personnel. &quot;Get up! They're firing in your honor so stand up
in their honor. The Arab enemy is firing salvos in your honor, for
what you are doing to the Jews.&quot;

A father and son, ultra-Orthodox Jews from New York, look at the
destroyed shops and their hearts fill with sadness. They speak Yiddish
to each other; the son, Shmuel Landau, photographs the soldiers who

Net Hate in Neverland

To locals, he's a roadside instutition. But to the Usenet, he's a monster.

By Julia Reischel
Article Published Sep 21, 2006

When Mickey Ben-Tovim drives by Peter Pan Gifts, a small seashell shop in Delray Beach,
he slows his Ferarri and squints through the windows cluttered with conchs and cowries,
searching for a man he wants dead.

&quot;He's truly one of the more vile individuals you'll ever come across,&quot; says Ben-Tovim, an
Israeli-born Sarasota computer programmer. &quot;I have on occasion thought about causing him
bodily harm, but then I thought, you know, I'm not going to risk my freedom for his. But
I was a Marine Corps sniper. If I had the urge to kill him, I would've done it a long
time ago, and no one would ever find out.&quot;

For at least a decade, 74-year-old Alex Seredin, owner and proprietor of Peter Pan Gifts,
has spent his nights posting Internet messages filled with his hatred of Jews. A search
on his e-mail address produces thousands of messages laced with all-caps profanity and
the word kike.

Using a variety of pseudonyms such as &quot;El Conquistador&quot; and &quot;Strider,&quot; all of which trace
back to the same BellSouth account, Seredin is a regular presence on messageboards
dedicated to Jewish culture and Holocaust denial. Under &quot;Serwad,&quot; his oldest nom de
guerre, he writes with unflagging passion about the sins, as he sees them, of Israel and
Jewry.

In a typical message, titled &quot;HOLOCAUST IS THE JEW LIE AND DOWNFALL,&quot; Seredin explains
that anti-Semitism is the fault of Jews themselves: &quot;I am not against the Jewish people,
but I really think they should know that those of us that are not Jewish, do not sit
around all day every day thinking about being Jewish,&quot; he writes. &quot;And that the idea to
introduce oneself as Hello my name is David and I'm a Jew at EVERY encounter is really
what engenders anti-Semitism, let alone that is very tiresome.&quot;

Many of his posts quickly degenerate into short, profane volleys with other newsgroup
regulars, with Seredin demonstrating that he has a short temper and an oddball vocabulary
of racial slurs.

&quot;HOW ZIONAZIS FUCK AMERICANS&quot; reads one post. &quot;WATCH OUT KIKE WE ARE COMING&quot; reads
another. &quot;PALESTINIANS SHOULD EXPEL ALL THE BLOODY KIKES&quot; runs a third. &quot;IF THEY DO NOT
WANT TO LEAVE THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN PICK AND SHOVEL!&quot;

By posting dozens of messages like these every day, Seredin has earned a storied
reputation as one of the most venerable and irrational racists in the newsgroup
community.

&quot;There are 200 million Islamo-fascists who are bent on destroying our way of life, and
Seredin is one of those people who buys into it,&quot; Ben-Tovim says. &quot;It's anger - it's all
anger.&quot;

&quot;His posts all sound alike,&quot; says Susan, a Usenet regular from Maryland who has been
sparring with Seredin for years. &quot;They're all the really frothing at the mouth, English
not quite perfect. And then he starts making sexual slurs. He usually speaks about the
clit. He says clacker, which I think is supposed to mean the same thing. He resorts to
this when he's backed into a corner. He's vociferous and gross about it.&quot;

The war became a dirty one long ago. Ben-Tovim and others tracked down Seredin's home
address and business and published them on the messageboards, along with his private
telephone number and the name of his wife, Mona.

&quot;I'm getting worried about Alex,&quot; one poster wrote in late 2005. &quot;The anger. The upper
case. This is an urgent message to anyone who lives in Delray Beach, Florida. Stop by
Alex's home and shop and see how he is doing! Here are the coordinates.&quot;

Seredin, who refused to be photographed for this article, has fought back with similar
tactics but has never managed to shift attacks away from himself. Ben-Tovim says Seredin
serves a useful purpose in the Usenet ecosystem. &quot;Alex is so outrageous that he's
actually a very good example of how ignorant anti-Semitism is,&quot; he says. &quot;He's a very
good way of making all anti-Semites look bad. He shouldn't be silenced - he should be
exposed.&quot;

The fact that he spends his days selling seashells to aging Floridians out of a store
named for a beloved children's storybook character makes him curiously compelling to
everyone on the messageboards.

&quot;I wonder what the heck he is doing,&quot; Susan says. &quot;Sitting in the back waiting for
customers, typing between sales?&quot;

On a recent lazy summer Monday afternoon, Alex Seredin is behind the counter at the
center of his large, whitewashed roadside shop, attending to a belligerent gray-haired
customer while tinny piped-in country music tinkles above.

&quot;Just let me see it!&quot; his patron barks as Seredin handles one of the many shells she is
buying. Square-faced, with a cap of white hair and a large round belly under his lavender
T-shirt, Seredin responds good-naturedly with a genial &quot;ho, ho, ho&quot; as he hands it back
to her. He looks exactly like a tropical Santa Claus after a good shave.

His jolliness soothes his customer. Pawing over her purchases, she becomes pleased. &quot;This
is really going to look kitsch!&quot; she murmurs, delighted.

&quot;There are some real treasures here. It's a wonderful place for kids,&quot; Seredin calls
after her in his wheezy Eastern European accent. &quot;Have a good day, my dear.&quot;

Though it's officially after business hours, a trickle of customers keeps coming in to
wander through the rows of baby sharks floating in bottles of electric-blue liquid, tubs
of $1 starfish husks, and shells of every variety. Seredin buys the shells in bulk,
shipped over from Indonesia and Malaysia, and resells them to beachcombers looking for
souvenirs. He purchased the store from its original owner in 1996, when Seredin and his
wife followed the snowbirds from Ottawa to Florida and decided to roost.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; some
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; people here post the same 3 questions to snow to every thread.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Netiquette
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; also suggests that personal attacks and flaming is inappropriate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yet
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; newsgroup is all about flaming.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Says the man who talks about other people's parents and farm
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; animals?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Your religion refers to all non yids as &quot;beasts of the fields&quot; fat
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slag.

&gt;&gt; &gt; No it doesn't. Only your filthy and purposeful mistranslations do that.

&gt;&gt; Yes it does.

&gt; No it doesn't. What you know about &quot;my religion&quot; would fit on the head
&gt; of a pin in 24-point type, with room left over for &quot;War and Peace.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You seem to have a very confused understanding of what constitutes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; honesty.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You wouldn't know honesty if it danced naked on a piano in front of
&gt;&gt; &gt; you,
&gt;&gt; &gt; singing, &quot;Honesty is here again.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Oh, but I do, fat slag.

&gt; The fact that you're still using schoolyard invective and idiotic
&gt; name-calling certainly makes a case that you don't have the slightest
&gt; idea what honesty is.

Net Hate in Neverland

To locals, he's a roadside instutition. But to the Usenet, he's a monster.

By Julia Reischel
Article Published Sep 21, 2006

When Mickey Ben-Tovim drives by Peter Pan Gifts, a small seashell shop in Delray Beach,
he slows his Ferarri and squints through the windows cluttered with conchs and cowries,
searching for a man he wants dead.

&quot;He's truly one of the more vile individuals you'll ever come across,&quot; says Ben-Tovim, an
Israeli-born Sarasota computer programmer. &quot;I have on occasion thought about causing him
bodily harm, but then I thought, you know, I'm not going to risk my freedom for his. But
I was a Marine Corps sniper. If I had the urge to kill him, I would've done it a long
time ago, and no one would ever find out.&quot;

For at least a decade, 74-year-old Alex Seredin, owner and proprietor of Peter Pan Gifts,
has spent his nights posting Internet messages filled with his hatred of Jews. A search
on his e-mail address produces thousands of messages laced with all-caps profanity and
the word kike.

Using a variety of pseudonyms such as &quot;El Conquistador&quot; and &quot;Strider,&quot; all of which trace
back to the same BellSouth account, Seredin is a regular presence on messageboards
dedicated to Jewish culture and Holocaust denial. Under &quot;Serwad,&quot; his oldest nom de
guerre, he writes with unflagging passion about the sins, as he sees them, of Israel and
Jewry.

In a typical message, titled &quot;HOLOCAUST IS THE JEW LIE AND DOWNFALL,&quot; Seredin explains
that anti-Semitism is the fault of Jews themselves: &quot;I am not against the Jewish people,
but I really think they should know that those of us that are not Jewish, do not sit
around all day every day thinking about being Jewish,&quot; he writes. &quot;And that the idea to
introduce oneself as Hello my name is David and I'm a Jew at EVERY encounter is really
what engenders anti-Semitism, let alone that is very tiresome.&quot;

Many of his posts quickly degenerate into short, profane volleys with other newsgroup
regulars, with Seredin demonstrating that he has a short temper and an oddball vocabulary
of racial slurs.

&quot;HOW ZIONAZIS FUCK AMERICANS&quot; reads one post. &quot;WATCH OUT KIKE WE ARE COMING&quot; reads
another. &quot;PALESTINIANS SHOULD EXPEL ALL THE BLOODY KIKES&quot; runs a third. &quot;IF THEY DO NOT
WANT TO LEAVE THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN PICK AND SHOVEL!&quot;

By posting dozens of messages like these every day, Seredin has earned a storied
reputation as one of the most venerable and irrational racists in the newsgroup
community.

&quot;There are 200 million Islamo-fascists who are bent on destroying our way of life, and
Seredin is one of those people who buys into it,&quot; Ben-Tovim says. &quot;It's anger - it's all
anger.&quot;

&quot;His posts all sound alike,&quot; says Susan, a Usenet regular from Maryland who has been
sparring with Seredin for years. &quot;They're all the really frothing at the mouth, English
not quite perfect. And then he starts making sexual slurs. He usually speaks about the
clit. He says clacker, which I think is supposed to mean the same thing. He resorts to
this when he's backed into a corner. He's vociferous and gross about it.&quot;

The war became a dirty one long ago. Ben-Tovim and others tracked down Seredin's home
address and business and published them on the messageboards, along with his private
telephone number and the name of his wife, Mona.

&quot;I'm getting worried about Alex,&quot; one poster wrote in late 2005. &quot;The anger. The upper
case. This is an urgent message to anyone who lives in Delray Beach, Florida. Stop by
Alex's home and shop and see how he is doing! Here are the coordinates.&quot;

Seredin, who refused to be photographed for this article, has fought back with similar
tactics but has never managed to shift attacks away from himself. Ben-Tovim says Seredin
serves a useful purpose in the Usenet ecosystem. &quot;Alex is so outrageous that he's
actually a very good example of how ignorant anti-Semitism is,&quot; he says. &quot;He's a very
good way of making all anti-Semites look bad. He shouldn't be silenced - he should be
exposed.&quot;

The fact that he spends his days selling seashells to aging Floridians out of a store
named for a beloved children's storybook character makes him curiously compelling to
everyone on the messageboards.

&quot;I wonder what the heck he is doing,&quot; Susan says. &quot;Sitting in the back waiting for
customers, typing between sales?&quot;

On a recent lazy summer Monday afternoon, Alex Seredin is behind the counter at the
center of his large, whitewashed roadside shop, attending to a belligerent gray-haired
customer while tinny piped-in country music tinkles above.

&quot;Just let me see it!&quot; his patron barks as Seredin handles one of the many shells she is
buying. Square-faced, with a cap of white hair and a large round belly under his lavender
T-shirt, Seredin responds good-naturedly with a genial &quot;ho, ho, ho&quot; as he hands it back
to her. He looks exactly like a tropical Santa Claus after a good shave.

His jolliness soothes his customer. Pawing over her purchases, she becomes pleased. &quot;This
is really going to look kitsch!&quot; she murmurs, delighted.

&quot;There are some real treasures here. It's a wonderful place for kids,&quot; Seredin calls
after her in his wheezy Eastern European accent. &quot;Have a good day, my dear.&quot;

Though it's officially after business hours, a trickle of customers keeps coming in to
wander through the rows of baby sharks floating in bottles of electric-blue liquid, tubs
of $1 starfish husks, and shells of every variety. Seredin buys the shells in bulk,
shipped over from Indonesia and Malaysia, and resells them to beachcombers looking for
souvenirs. He purchased the store from its original owner in 1996, when Seredin and his
wife followed the snowbirds from Ottawa to Florida and decided to roost.

The zionazis deny everything. No Jew has ever done anything bad. If
you think different, it is only because you are an antisemite. Do you
know about antisemites? They are the bad people. They do not buy 100%
of zionazi propaganda. Very bad people. They ask questions and
questions are bad.

Very bad :-)

good way of making all anti-Semites look bad. He shouldn't be silenced - he
should be
exposed.&quot;

The fact that he spends his days selling seashells to aging Floridians out
of a store
named for a beloved children's storybook character makes him curiously
compelling to
everyone on the messageboards.

&quot;I wonder what the heck he is doing,&quot; Susan says. &quot;Sitting in the back
waiting for
customers, typing between sales?&quot;

On a recent lazy summer Monday afternoon, Alex Seredin is behind the counter
at the
center of his large, whitewashed roadside shop, attending to a belligerent
gray-haired
customer while tinny piped-in country music tinkles above.

&quot;Just let me see it!&quot; his patron barks as Seredin handles one of the many
shells she is
buying. Square-faced, with a cap of white hair and a large round belly under
his lavender
T-shirt, Seredin responds good-naturedly with a genial &quot;ho, ho, ho&quot; as he
hands it back
to her. He looks exactly like a tropical Santa Claus after a good shave.

His jolliness soothes his customer. Pawing over her purchases, she becomes
pleased. &quot;This
is really going to look kitsch!&quot; she murmurs, delighted.

&quot;There are some real treasures here. It's a wonderful place for kids,&quot;
Seredin calls
after her in his wheezy Eastern European accent. &quot;Have a good day, my dear.&quot;

Though it's officially after business hours, a trickle of customers keeps
coming in to
wander through the rows of baby sharks floating in bottles of electric-blue
liquid, tubs
of $1 starfish husks, and shells of every variety. Seredin buys the shells
in bulk,
shipped over from Indonesia and Malaysia, and resells them to beachcombers
looking for
souvenirs. He purchased the store from its original owner in 1996, when
Seredin and his
wife followed the snowbirds from Ottawa to Florida and decided to roost.

I began my questioning and search for truth regarding the much ballyhooed
&quot;Holocaust&quot; in 1974. Like nearly every American, I fully accepted at face
value the claims of &quot;survivors,&quot; the videos and photos shown on television,
and the very regular pronouncements from the media, dais, and pulpit about
the &quot;horrible extermination campaign&quot; conducted against Jews by Hitler's
Germany . What spurred me to question the details of this unspeakable crime?
Reading a paper titled &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot;, my work experience in
a chemical plant and the handling of hydrogen cyanide, and reading the
accounts of &quot;survivors&quot; from the post-war trials which essentially
established the legend of mass extermination that came to be termed the
&quot;Holocaust.&quot;

The first thing I did as a seeker of truth was to get a definition of
&quot;Holocaust,&quot; which was and is readily available in countless books on the
subject. That definition was/is described as &quot;the planned and activated
extermination of members of the Jewish race, numbering some six million, by
National Socialist Germany primarily through the use of Zyclon B ( a
commercial preparation containing hydrogen cyanide) used to disinfect
clothing at the various labor camps during World War II.&quot; With this
definition forming the guidelines, I began my quest.

Those who have challenged the &quot;establishment&quot; viewpoint are known as
&quot;revisionists,&quot; and their position on the subject is: there was NO attempt
by National Socialist Germany to exterminate ANY ethnic group. Revisionists
agree that many deaths occurred in the camps due to disease, starvation, and
the horrid conditions of war, but &quot;gas chambers&quot; for homicidal purposes were
non-existent. Those who accept the conventional view as true are designated
as &quot;exterminationists&quot; by revisionists.

What jumped at this researcher immediately upon closer examination of the
stories of extermination were the many credible arguments against such a
program, as advanced by revisionists. The technical and physical
impossibilities of the claims of alleged gassings and cremations as espoused
by &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; at the post-war trials immediately fly in the face of
scientific fact. Unfortunately, such claims were NOT allowed to be
questioned by the defense, nor those witnesses allowed to be cross examined.
Before an analysis of such claims, a chronological background on the origins
of &quot;denial&quot; is necessary for a proper understanding of revisionist
contentions.

In 1961, Professor Paul Rassinier of France became the first author to
refute the accuracy of claims of genocide in print. Francis P. Yockey's
&quot;Imperium,&quot; published in 1948, did cast doubt upon the claims, but did not
deal directly with the subject. Rassinier, a socialist and member of the
French resistance, had been captured and interned in the concentration camps
of Buchenwald and Dora. Liberated in 1945, he returned to France as an
invalid, and was shortly very puzzled, then outraged, at the claims of
&quot;genocide&quot; and gas chambers, particularly regarding the two camps where he
had been a prisoner. He had seen no evidence of any such activities as an
inmate there, and Rassinier certainly had no love for the Germans. His
initial work on the extermination of the Jews, &quot;The Lie of Ulysses,&quot;
followed in 1964 by his &quot;The Drama of the European Jews,&quot; called into
question the &quot;Holocaust&quot; legend.

The year 1976 featured the appearance of a thorough and well-documented
revisionist treatise by Dr. Arthur R. Butz of Northwestern University . &quot;The
Hoax of the 20th Century&quot; dissected the extermination claims from pre-war
and post war population statistics; the crucial role played by the Allied
trials and their extreme importance in implanting the legend were also
addressed by Butz: &quot;.it is a fact that without the evidence generated at
these trials, there would be no significant evidence that the program of
killing Jews ever existed at all.If the trials had not been held, a person
claiming the existence of an extermination program could not, if challenged,
produce any evidence for this save a few books.whose claims are just as
unsupported as his original claim. Thus the problem that had been involved
in deciding whether or not to try mass murder; unlike the usual murder case,
there was legitimate and very solid doubt that the deed had been committed
at all.

&quot;This may surprise the reader who regards the tale of Jewish extermination
as a near certainty; such is simply not the case. There are many
considerations supporting this view and some are so simple that they may
surprise the reader even further. The simplest valid reason for being
skeptical about the extermination claim is also the simplest conceivable
reason; at the end of the war they were still there&quot; (Butz, page 10).

Adding credence to the claims made by Butz is the 1983 publication by Walter
N. Sanning, &quot;The Dissolution of Eastern European Jewry.&quot; This detailed
demographic study offers evidence that the vast majority of the
&quot;exterminated&quot; Jews did indeed survive, being absorbed primarily into the
Soviet Union, Palestine , and the United States . Professor Sanning
challenges the exterminationist school of thought: &quot;The purpose of this
analysis was not to investigate the content of truth in the 'Holocaust'
story, but to outline the extent and the direction of the Jewish population
movement before, during, and after World War II. If the developments as
traced here are in conflict with the taboos of contemporary historians, it
is THEIR (emphasis added) task to reconsider an untenable position.&quot;

In his booklet, &quot;The Holocaust - 120 Questions and Answers,&quot; Dr. Charles E.
Weber does a masterful job of provoking thought while keeping his approach
simple and plain-spoken. This 1983 publication addresses a myriad of issues
related to the Holocaust legend, and reminds the reader from the outset that
the funding available to those who disseminate material from the
exterminationist viewpoint far outweighs the minute resources available to
the revisionist (p.8). This is, of course, a major factor in the relative
obscurity of revisionist research and conclusions on the issue.

One of the most definitive books on the conduct of &quot;war crimes&quot; trials, &quot;The
Auschwitz Myth,&quot; by Dr. Wilhelm Staglich, gives one insight into the show
trial and political nature of Allied courtroom procedures. This 1986
publication stresses the ignoring of proper judicial standards and the
appalling way in which the search for TRUTH was impeded rather than
furthered by the court. Not many are aware that &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; were NOT
allowed to be cross-examined by the defense, nor were they ever subjected to
enforcement of the perjury oath. Additionally, &quot;witnesses&quot; traveled from
court to court making the same unchallenged claims, saying they had been at
each camp.

By October of 1990 the revisionist assault on the legend had come full
circle with the admission by Great Britain's leading historian and authority
on World War II, David Irving, that he was now convinced of the fraudulent
nature of the entire extermination thesis (&quot;Battleship Auschwitz ,&quot; pp.
498-499), and would include a statement to this effect in new editions of
his previously published books.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS

According to revisionist investigation, NONE of the alleged &quot;gas chambers&quot;
had ventilation or exhaust systems capable of handling the gassing of
inmates. The square footage in ALL of the &quot;chambers&quot; would allow for a
hypothetical total of 123,976 gassings in ALL the years of the supposed
&quot;genocide&quot; program (The Leuchter Report, p. 14). In September of 1989, the
Russians released the Auschwitz death books (the Germans were meticulous
record keepers), which show a death toll of 74,000 at that camp from ALL
CAUSES ( Irving , p. 500). Confessions from Germans, obtained by TORTURE,
&quot;eyewitness&quot; testimony, and exterminationist historians put the number
gassed at Auschwitz alone at 4 million. This massive contradiction deserves
further examination in the interest of historical truth. This figure has now
been revised downward, to just over a million, thanks to the fear of
revisionist discoveries and publishings. Notably, however, that reduction
did nothing regarding the claim of six-million dead!!

On August 19, 1960, the director of the prestigious Institute for
Contemporary History in Munich, Dr. Martin Broszat, announced to his amazed
countrymen that there had NEVER been a &quot;gas chamber&quot; in the entirety of the
German Reich, but only a few in other places, namely in occupied Poland
(Robert Faurrison, &quot;The Problem of the Gas Chambers,&quot; pp. 107-108). This
announcement flew in the face of those who swore to mass killings in German
camps, but that was never brought up, of course!

Broszat has NEVER provided an explanation for this contention. Professor
Robert Faurrison of France asks: 1. How does Dr. Broszat know that the &quot;gas
chambers&quot; in the Old Reich were frauds? 2. How does he know that the &quot;gas
chambers&quot; in Poland are genuine? 3. Why do the proofs and certainties and
eyewitness accounts concerning the concentration camps in the west suddenly
have no value, while these SAME criteria still remain true for the camps in
Poland (p. 108)? Think about those questions!!

As the exterminationists themselves have since abandoned the claims of the
use of gas chambers in Germany proper, primary attention will now be devoted
to the main camps in Poland , which would be Majdanek and
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Pertinent to this, however, is the confession regarding
the German camp of Bergen-Belsen .

Two of the pillars upon which rest the claims of the exterminationist
historians and the &quot;survivors&quot; and &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; are the confessions of
Kurt Gerstein and Rudolf Hoess. Gerstein, one-time commandant of
Bergen-Belsen, states in his confession that 700 to 800 people went into
each of the four chambers each time the gassings took

You are absolutely right. The fictional holocaust is the only event in
modern times where whole nations including the education system is being
forced to believe all of it. In Germany it is actually against the law to
critic the holocaust.
