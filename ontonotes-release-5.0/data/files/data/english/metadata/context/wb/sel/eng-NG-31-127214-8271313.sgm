Vignettes of Bill Walsh, gathered at Thursday's private memorial
service at Stanford:

Mike Shumann, 49ers receiver (1978-79, '81), sports anchor at KGO-TV
(Channel 7): &quot;When we first went down to play the Rams, he was
concerned that we were going to get influenced by Hollywood and break
curfew and go out, so he got (assistant coaches) Bobb McKittrick, Sam
Wyche and Denny Green to dress up as a hooker, a pimp and a drug
dealer, just to show us what we had to stay away from. Can you imagine
telling Bobb McKittrick, 'I need you to find a wig and a dress?' Those
guys had to be thinking to themselves, 'What is he doing?' It was just
his sense of humor. ...

&quot;Of course, he played the hotel bellhop in Detroit (before Super Bow
XVI). He tried to grab my bag, and I just fore-armed him away. I'm
coming back down the elevator, and (guard) John Ayers says, 'Did you
see Bill dressed as a bellhop?' I said, 'That was Bill? I'll never get
in the game now.' &quot;

Dick Vermeil, former Eagles/Rams/Chiefs head coach: &quot;He was the least
mechanical guy I've ever been around in my life. There wasn't a
household chore that he could do comfortably. It was amazing because
he was so gifted in so many ways. ...

&quot;He flew in an F-16 fighter after he was out of coaching. Through the
entire flight he had to go to the bathroom. He's in this jumpsuit. He
gets out and they go through this whole parade and ceremony, and he
told me later all he wanted to do was go to the men's room.&quot;

Harris Barton, 49ers offensive tackle (1987-98): &quot;A couple of years
ago, I was having lunch with Bill, and I asked him what the best
offensive drive he ever had was. He said, 'Harris, when I came back to
Stanford, we were playing at Notre Dame. We received the kickoff, and
they were heavy favorites. I stood and watched our 17-play, nine-
minute drive, and told myself, &quot;This is like art.&quot; And after we
scored, Notre Dame ran the kickoff back for a touchdown.' &quot;

Mike Holmgren, Seattle Seahawks coach, 49ers assistant (1986-91): &quot;We
were playing the Minnesota Vikings and Joe (Montana) was hurt and
Steve (Young) was playing. Steve fumbled the snap from center early in
the game. Bill was convinced that, behind his back, I had changed the
snap count for all the 49ers. In the locker room, I said, 'I would not
change the snap count,' He said, 'I know you did. Steve would not
fumble the snap.' &quot;

&quot;I went to visit him before we played San Francisco last year. ...
You're not sure what to say. He had just had some treatments. In
typical Bill fashion, he said, 'Mike, I have to talk with you about
what you're doing in short-yardage situations. It's not very good.' &quot;

Dusty Baker, ex-Giants/Cubs manager: &quot;The greatest thing he gave me
was a manual about how he started with the 49ers and set up their
organization. I've got to go find it. It was a big thing - how to
treat players, their wives, their mothers. The only person I ever let
see it was (Giants GM) Brian Sabean. It's probably my most prized
possession. I've got to pull it out and review some things for the
next time. He has inspired me to want to manage again.&quot;

Milt McColl, 49ers linebacker (1981-87): &quot;On the bus to the Super
Bowl, the second bus got stuck in the snow and the traffic, and they
were just sitting there. Bill gets up and says, 'Don't worry, guys. I
just got a call from the field. (Equipment manager) Chico Norton
scored, and we're ahead, 7-0.' &quot;

Dwight Clark, 49ers receiver (1979-87): &quot;He told us, 'Men, we need to
be as rested as we can to win this game. For some of you, that will
mean a lot of sex and for the others, it will mean none at all. It's
up to you to figure it out.' ...

&quot;When Joe (Montana) and I were with him over the last few months, he
was still accusing us of sneaking out of training camp. He even fined
us one day, without any evidence. We paid him with Monopoly money, and
he actually accepted it.&quot;

Steve Young, 49ers quarterback (1987-99), Hall of Famer: &quot;In 1988, he
decided I was going to get in the game. Joe drives the team down to
the 10 against the great New Orleans defense, and Bill tells me to go
in and run that bootleg. It was probably the first time I stepped onto
the field for the 49ers. I go in and call the play, but forget to put
the tight end in motion. The guy I'm supposed to throw the ball to is
on the wrong side, so Rickey Jackson comes in and sacks me for a 7-
yard loss. Joe comes back on the field. Bill looked at me. 'You dumb
SOB.' I spent months digging out of that hole.&quot;

Jamie Williams, 49ers tight end (1989-93): &quot;I was the only guy in the
league with dreadlocks. I came from Houston and was worried he'd say,
'This guy is too crazy for us.' He said what great feet I had and what
great hands I had. I said, 'So my hair doesn't bother you?' He said,
'Your hair isn't going to make plays for you.' That decompressed me
and I was ready to come on board.&quot;

&quot;About a year ago I sat down with him here at Stanford, and he said he
didn't see the passion in coaching that there used to be, on every
level. The coaches are lazy these days. They don't want to get down
with the kids and develop their talent. They all want the kids that
are already there.&quot;

Tom Holmoe, 49ers safety (1983-89), athletic director at BYU: &quot;We were
in minicamp at Santa Clara, and Bill asked for volunteers to go with
him to a charity breakfast. About 15 or 20 of the players went. He
spoke and said, 'I believe in this charity, and I would like everybody
here to contribute. I'll start with a $10,000 contribution, and I know
my players here - please stand up - will all give $1,000. We looked at
each other, and said, 'What? Is he paying for us?' We got back to
camp, and decided, well, he's our guy. There was probably $30,000 or
$40,000 raised, and he did it on the spot.&quot;

Ted Leland, former Stanford athletic director: &quot;Bill had made some
comments in the papers about the Washington players, and this was when
they were a very good team. We were getting angry e-mail and phone
calls (from Husky fans). When Bill got off the plane in Seattle, all
the press was waiting. He put on one of those fake noses and glasses.
It diffused the whole thing. Even they had to laugh.&quot;

Mike White, ex-Raiders head coach, 49ers assistant (1978-79): &quot;My wife
and I were with him two or three days before he passed away. We told
him about the wedding of one of our sons Sept. 14. And he said, 'Oh,
I'll be back for that.' &quot;

Marty Connelly, long-time friend: &quot;He never saw a golf shot he didn't
like. No matter where the ball was - in the deep brush, behind a tree
- you'd look around and the ball would be in the fairway. He had a
better toe than Lou Groza. ...

&quot;In college, we were called the Dateless Wonders. We'd go out to a
beer joint, and even then Bill would map out a plan to go to a table
full of girls. By the time we executed, they were gone.&quot;

Geri Walsh, widow of Bill Walsh: &quot;I was registering for courses at San
Jose State, and he was ogling me. He was ogling all the girls. He was
an upper classman, and I was a freshman. He asked me my phone number,
but I didn't have a phone yet. So he asked me to come to a boxing
match with him. He was fighting in the Gold Gloves. So I went to the
arena to see him box. He won. I remember how wonderful he looked.&quot;
