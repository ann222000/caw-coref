I have recently purchased shakespears complete works, and I'm
currently reading Henry the 6. Shakespeare is dramatising history, but
is any of it real. for instance the kentish uprising involving cade,
and duke Humphrey's murder, or that there ever was a duke humphreys.
Also can anyone tell me at the end of the tempest, is prospero's
epilogue addressed to us the audience or some unknown other?

Your best move is to get a copy of Isaac Asimov's &quot;Guide to
Shakespeare&quot;. It tells you all the things that Shakespeare expected his
audience to know already, but which most contemporary people probably don't.

On the whole, most of what is in the plays is more or less historical,
with these principal caveats:

1. The chronology of the French war is a dreadful jumble, but the end
result is correct -- England lost.

2. There is no evidence that Richard of York planned to revolt; he
appears to have been driven to it as a last resort. (The &quot;roses&quot; scene,
in particular, is ahistorical Tudor legend.)

3. Alexander Iden was more nearly a bounty hunter than a noble yeoman
defending his homestead.

4. Moving on to &quot;Richard III&quot;, there /are/ good reasons to believe that
Richard had his nephews killed, though the matter will probably never be
known for sure. But almost everything else is a Tudor smear. His
marriage, for example, was a genuine love match.

(By the way, most of the characters in Christopher Fry's &quot;The Lady's Not
For Burning&quot; are named after personages involved in the Margery
Jourdayne affair, which was quite real.)

Definitely the audience.
