Thomas  Friedman, a columnist for the New York Times, observed how
much the price of oil has shot up since 9/11.  He says it was a huge
mistake not to change our energy policy after 9/11 so we'd be less
dependent on paying money to those who hate us and finance our
destruction.

In other words, he says we could have had a tax on oil that goes to
the US Treasury, or pay the tax to hostile countries like Venezuala
and Iran and Saudi Arabia.

See:
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/opinion/14friedman.html?ref=opinion

I think he makes some pretty good points.  While motorists simply look
at the pump price for the cost of oil, and politicians risk blowing
our strategic reserve in a phony attempt to hold the price down, we
really do need to look where are oil money is going:  to terrorists
who wish to kill us.

This is a pefect example of why I call this idiot, Idiot Arif.

Let's examine Idiot Arif's newest example.  Gas has increased 30c a
gal in the last 60 days.  On top of throwing more and more money to
the Arabs for oil, the dollar is becoming worth less and less.  But
Idiot Arif is unable to comprehend this.

Now continuing,  we are borrowing billions from said Arabs and Chinese
to finance the idiocy in Iraq.  Now I am sure Idiot Arif does not
comprehend this either.

In borrowing said billions from the above we are making them weathier
and esp in the case of the Chinese better able to compete with us in
finding oil, and building gas guzzling cars and building huge const
projects that increase the demand for concrete and steel.

Thanks Hancock for posting this and showing Idiot Arif for the true
idiot he is.  He does not want mandatory auto liability ins either.
True brilliance.

Friedman just published an article stating how horrible it was that
people in India wanted cars.  He really feels only the elite should drive,
and that includes the USA.  I think his book &quot;The Earth is Flat&quot; is the
product of a tourist listening to elites in India blab away, forgetting that
only 1% of their populations can compete in the world market for
outsourcing.  Overall, he is a typical reporter who runs hot and cold on
what is fashionable.  When the Times had him hidden behind Times Select, I
never went there, even though I could have as a home subscriber.

In the case of energy, it does. Bugger the social consequences.

Nobody wants to look at alternatives to petroleum energy as long as the
price of petroleum is low.  There is too much finanical risk.  Even with it
rising, there is also the chance that it might fall again.  That means
venture capitalists would be worried that making long-term investment in
alternatives would still be risky.

Keeping energy prices low, or worse yet, subsidizing energy use, only
perpetuates the current state of affairs.  The best way to wean ourselves
from petroleum is to let the price rise.

Not only that, but as you said, the outflow of money from the U.S.
reduces the value of the dollar.  That will increase the cost of
imports we're so dependent on.

What really gets me is that we give all our money to these overtly or
covertly hostile countries who then use the money to buy weapons and
tactics to use against us.  China is a big arms dealer.  Russia, using
new money from oil, has become a troublemaker again.  We know about
Iran. Saudi Arabia keeps internal peace by blackmail payoffs to very
radical groups.  The guy running Venezl.  is a dictator and created
nasty shortages in his country and a trouble maker as well.

It is sad that the focus is _solely_ more oil!  more oil!  How DARE
anyone suggest that they perhaps drive a little bit less, drive a
little bit slower, or drive something less than an a SUV.

Remember '73 and '79?  Expect some nasty inflation COMBINED with a
lousy economy.

None of the above are going to make a dent, as long as oil is in the
$3-6 a gal range.  Now if it get above $6, in Europe it is about $8 a
gal, then people and companies are going to have to make some serious
decisions.

It is becoming increasingly appearent $150+ a barrel is not out of
reach.

Which means $200 to fill up your tank, $2000 a year to heat you home,
plus huge general inflation on anything and everything made with oil
or petroleum based.

Re: Chavez, I liked him at first because he stood up to the USA.  And
when US interests tried to overthrow him it did nothing but embolden
him.  But then he became more dictatorial, more in line with Iran, and
very anti semetic, he turned me off.

We made the same mistake with him we made with Castro in the 50's, and
all due to idiot conservatives.  We could have very easily bought
Castro off supplying their every need and preventing him from cozying
up to the Soviets.  Same thing with Chavez.

But we try to destroy that which we cannot control, and that never
works.

And Georgie Boy has a PhD???  Go figure...   And Georgie Boy, what
does Tom Friedman have to do with $100+ a barrel oil?  Also to the
point Georgie Boy, how do you plan to make oil prices back to say $75
a barrel?  I guess that is your point, huh Georgie Boy?

I would love to hear your plan to cause this to happen.  I am sure we
all would, esp your friend Idiot Arif.

I mean everything I hear is oil prices are going no where but up, but
with your PhD, I am sure you have plenty of good ideas to stem the

Exactly how is that an idiotic line? I seem to recall the boys in DC and
their propaganda mill(Fox News), beating the drum for war with Iran pretty
loudly lately, I'd say that's warmongering. A simple read of history after
World War II will provide ample examples of interventionalist foreign

Yes it does.  You said we were attacked on 9-11 because of our war mongering
and our interventionist policy.  My question was to point out that they have
attacked others who are not involved in our war mongering or interventionist
policies, yet they were attacked anyway.  Why would that be?

I wonder what Tom Friedman would have to say about the fact that about
85% of the time that the US stock markets drop, the price of a barrel
of oil drops with it. Which directly implies, if not outright states,
that the contract for delivery of a barrel of oil is just another
financial instrument, on par with any credit derivative or junk bond.

Furthermore, I never hear Tom, or any other chattering class muse,
mention one thing about transport of that oil. Namely, the security of
that oil delivery. Which nation has become the ultimate guarantor of
the security of the shipping lanes? Do I need to drop hints:)

Have you ever heard of the futures market by chance?  All our government
has to do is relay a story to several newspapers, attributed as an
official who wishes to remain anonymous, about Iran being months away
from building a nuclear weapon, or covert operations taking place in
Iran, or whatever, and you'll see the price of oil go up without any
real change in supply or demand.

On another note, Iraq's oil production isn't quite up to pre-war gulf
war two level, and is presumably nowhere near pre gulf-war one level.
That in itself is a significant reduction in supply directly caused by
our foreign policy.

It does not matter whether our actions are &quot;unpopular&quot; or not, in the
grand scheme of geopolitics. What matters is that we can back up our
words with necessary actions. No matter how you slice it, invading
Iraq was a matter of national credibility for the United States. If
GWB kicked the Saddam can down the road, even after the 9/11 attacks
that Saddam directly praised and especially after the lack of action
by his father, the United States would have been portrayed as the
&quot;weak horse.&quot; No one would have been able to fully rely on this nation
if we punted on Iraq, and this nation would have been sitting ducks
for even more deadly terror attacks.

Was a pretext used to go into Iraq? Sure there was, and that fact is
irrelevant! The invasion of Iraq was well worth all the struggles
we've had with it since, and those soldiers and Marines did not die in
vain.

Hardly a red herring.  We've moved far beyond US energy policy.  We've been

Never mind that anything involving civilian casualties or destruction of
religious edifices, or even rumours to that effect can be propagandised to
the hilt. Don't think for a minute when some nutcase preacher opens his
mouth saying Islam should be destroyed that it doesn't reverberate half a

foment anger that they can exploit to their own purposes.

Our moral imperative should be to be sure this country is safe, secure and
able to care for it's own before *anything* else. That security includes
*economic* security, which sure as hell doesn't entail selling our souls to
dodgy governments. We live in a country where the infrastructure is
crumbling around us, and we're sending enough cash abroad to fix that
infrastructure many times over. The health care system is a dog's
breakfast, and a lot of people are falling through the cracks. The only
sizeable industry is the weapons trade; many things that were made in this
country 40 years ago now come from abroad. Before we go representing
how 'great' we are to the world, we need to have our own house in order. A
respected leader provides an example and inspiration. A reviled leader
rules by fiat and brute force.

Part of the time it was sanctioned, later it wasn't. I'm pretty sure that
was what Ron Paul was referring to via Arif, insofar as 'bombing' was
concerned. Paul is obviously not correct in his assertion, and being
hyperbolic; but 'some' military action goes a long way in the grist mill
over in that part of the world, too, particularly when a significant part
of that population has an image of us as the 'Great Satan'. In that
context, Ron Paul's general drift is correct, in my opinion.

Al Queda has a secondary role in this, if any at all. As it stands right
