From the Guardian.  [quote] One of the biggest inquiries into marketing
practices in the drugs industry ended yesterday with Italian police asking for
almost 5,000 people to be put on trial, including more than 4,000 doctors and at
least 273 employees of the British pharmaceuticals giant, GlaxoSmithKline. Some
face up to five years in jail if tried and convicted.
Italy's revenue guard, the Guardia di Finanza, said in a statement that
GlaxoSmith- Kline and its predecessor firm had spent �228m (�152m) on
&quot;sweeteners&quot; for doctors, chemists and others over four years. The alleged
bribes ranged from cameras, computers and holidays to outright cash payments.
The Guardia di Finanza said GlaxoSmithKline &quot;should be held responsible for
corporate crime as its managers and other employees acted in the company's
interest&quot;.
A spokesman for GSK said last night it had been &quot;cooperating closely with the
authorities to facilitate their investigations. GSK is committed to ensuring
that all its business practices are of the highest standards and any breach of
that is unacceptable&quot;, the spokesman added. [end quote]
GSK is committed to ensuring that all its business practices are of the highest
standards?That GSK spokesman is hilarious!  Who knew GSK had such a sense of
humor.

Good question, Angela!  It is pretty riotous to think that anyone would believe
that tripe!  Their standards are so low they can't even peak over the edge of
the fence!

Hubbard declared that &quot;jokers and degraders&quot; were &quot;SPs&quot; - enemies of
humanity. That's in the bulletin of the same name.

Written after he caught Bill Howey doing watch on the Apollo and
imitating him to the uproarious laughter of fellow Sea Org staff
members. In other words, no sense of humor for Elwrong.

They can't even SEE the fence, let alone peep over the edge.  Business practices
