Overhaul overdue for Child Protective Services

On Aug. 1, 2007, I watched in absolute horror as Child Protective
Services swept five little, innocent children into a system that is
supposedly in place to protect our children. I am beginning to find out
that the system is failing and, in reality, is not protecting our
children after all.

Imagine for a moment the pain I feel as I keep hearing the cries of the
6-year-old boy over and over in my mind as he begged me not to let Child
Protective Services take him and his four younger siblings away. He kept
saying, “Follow me, Billy. Follow me all the way. I don’t want to leave.
I want to stay with Billy.” It broke my heart to hear his anguish and
the cries of his brothers and sisters. I cannot get it out of my mind.

No one would listen to me on Aug. 1, 2007. It made no difference to
anyone involved that the parents of these five children wanted me to
care for them. Yes, they are incarcerated, but they wanted me to care
for the children so there would be as little disruption in their lives
as possible. It made absolutely no difference that the children were
very well bonded with me and had spent lots of time with me. Child
Protective Services simply took the children away and gave them to
strangers.

When I was a child, I had a pair of old metal roller skates. When the
squeaking of metal on metal got too loud, we would oil the skates to
lessen the noise and it would work for a short while but, in reality,
the skates were worn out and needed to be replaced. I am not totally
against our current CPS system because I know we must have ways to
protect our children from mental, physical and sexual abuse. But, our
current Child Protective Services system, like my old roller skates, is
long overdue for a complete overhaul, not just a “simple oiling.”

Since the Aug. 1 incident, I have been unable to get the cries for help
of the little boy and his four young siblings out of my mind. I have
also heard horror stories about Child Protective Services from other
members of our community and from friends and relatives who live in
other counties and states. I know now that my experience is not unique
and it is evident to me that countless children have been swept into the
system unnecessarily and have eventually become lost souls, because once
the Child Protective Services ball starts rolling, there is no stopping it.

I am totally convinced that the entire Child Protective Services system
needs a complete review and investigation by the county, state and
federal offices in which we, as voters, have put our trust and
confidence. The juvenile court system, that is so closely tied to the
Child Protective Services system, also needs complete reform, review and
accountability to people.

I call on those in power at the county, state and federal levels to
appoint an independent review panel to review the inner workings of
Child Protective Services and the juvenile court system in order to
reform the systems to bring them back into compliance. In order for
these systems to work properly and become the fine-tuned machines they
were intended to be, trust and confidence must be restored. Without
accountability, the systems fail.

Nobody is talking about America’s Hidden Holocaust, the Destruction of
Hundreds of Good and innocent Low-Income Families by Child Protective
Services…

Currently Child Protective Services violates more civil rights on a
daily basis then all other agencies combined, Including the NSA/CIA
wiretaping program…

Personally I Do Not appreciate Child Protective Services using the
Constitution of the United States as Toilet Paper in a Time of War,
while the Good Men and Women of our Armed Forces are Fighting and Dying
for It.

Somebody needs to remind the individual State's and their governors that
