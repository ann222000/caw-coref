Many thanks Rod.
I do not collect Germany but found your post on the Gscheidle error to
be very interesting.
I am going to use this story at my next stamp club meeting and see if
the German collectors are aware of this &quot;stamp&quot;.
What do you know about the flap with the German/Netherlands Rembrandt
issue of last year?

Hi Ralphael &quot;ye olde wonne&quot;
No, I have read nothing about these in the recent magazines I have
read.
I thought you broached this subject with Mette recently?

You will find most of my stories aged,
I have approval from a publisher to print snippets
from a magazine, as a general interest theme
for this newsgroup.
I show respect by not reproducing anything
less than about 15 years old.

I find all of Otto Hornung's stories to be fascinating,
I would have liked to hitch a ride in his briefcase
in years past.
He is a &quot;stamp junkie&quot; ...arn't we all :)

Not that I would know of. I remember vaguely having read a thread
&quot;something&quot; about this issue, where Rein (at least I believe it was him)
stepped in, but I never mixed up in this myself, due to my recent temporary
absence.

Yes I did post this awhile back and Rein gave a pretty good
explanation.
I was just wondering if anyone heard anything new.

Apologies   yes it was Rein
Perhaps I naturally associate you with art on stamps :)

Rein:
The Dutch prestige booklet issued on the occasion of 400 years Rembrandt
contained a German 70c stamp depicting Saskia. It turned out that the
printing - made in the Netherlands - was different from the prinitng made
in Germany for the German sheetlets.

would you happen to have a copy of Rein's answer?  I realize that I should

2006 Rembrandt Options

Something strange is going on re: the 2006 Rembrandt joint issue
between the Netherlands and Germany.
Postbeeld has a listing for the Rembrandt stamp with German text for
40 euros. They claim this stamp is good for postage only in the
Netherlands.
Well, I don't think so. Printed in Germany with German text is a
German stamp, any way you look at it.
Anyone have comments?

and the like; a most likely deal between the 2 postal authorities]. The
Dutch stopped the sale of the presige booklets and declared the German
stamp in it to be a proper Dutch stamp that could be used!

The Dutch Stampdealers Association recognized the German stamp from a
Dutch booklet to be a true Dutch stamp as well and assigned it a main
catalogue number!

About a month after the stop of sales in the Netherlands the Dutch Post
Office sold the remaining booklets [some 15.000 out of 45.000] to the
Austrian stamp wholesaler of H.E. Sieger !
