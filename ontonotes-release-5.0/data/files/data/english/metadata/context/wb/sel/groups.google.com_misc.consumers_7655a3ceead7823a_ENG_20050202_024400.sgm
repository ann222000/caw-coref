Penis sucking Rabbi infects infants with Herpes

NEW YORK (AP) -- City health officials are investigating the death of
a baby boy who was one of three infants to contract herpes after a
rabbi circumcised them.

Ten days after Rabbi Yitzhok Fischer performed religious circumcisions
on twins last October, one died of herpes and the other tested
positive for the virus, according to complaint filed by the health
department in Manhattan Supreme Court.

The complaint, reported in Wednesday's edition of the New York Daily
News, also said health officials later found a third baby who had
contracted herpes after being circumcised by Fischer in late 2003.

Under Jewish law, a mohel -- someone who performs circumcisions --
draws blood from the circumcision wound. Most mohels do it by hand,
but Fischer uses a rare practice where he uses his mouth.

This practice is not &quot;rare&quot; by any means, many rabbis still practice
this form of paedophilia with the full support of the jewish
community. Thus they commit double crime - they genitally mutilate
the child, then they suck his freshly-mutilated penis.

Fischer's lawyer, Mark Kurzmann, told the Daily News that Fischer was
cooperating with the investigation, although it's unclear whether
Fischer submitted to the city's request for a blood test.

&quot;My client is known internationally as a caring, skilled, and
conscientious mohel,&quot; Kurzmann said.

No one else could get away with such heinous crimes against humanity.

Just imagine a man having his daughter circumcised and the person doing it
licking her vulva afterwards. There isn't a single jurisdiction in the U.S.
that wouldn't have this man arrested and put away for life, even if he came
up with the same lame excuse as the jews &quot;it's an ancient custom, our people
have been doing it for thousands of years.&quot;

Apparently he's one of the radical ultra politically correct who feel that
to criticize a barbaric act, if it's done by a jew, is to deny the
holocaust, to be promoting hate, bigotry, anti-semitism, blah blah blah.

Wow,

you can't say anything intelligent yet you can work a computer. Nothing
could justify any person harming any child, and no one person, or act
can justify an outrage against humanity. The holocost killed millions,
not just jews, but anyone who happened to disagree with the Nazi point
of view - so lets include Americans, British, French, Polish, Czech,
Russian, Slovik, and yes Germans. If you visit Buchenwald or any of the
other concentration camps you feel the tormented souls - these camps
were truley a manifestation of hell on earth and saying that is
justified tells me that you are a dark soul.

So I will say to you what will hurt you the most.

I respect your opinion and your right to it and being an american, I
would fight for your right to say it even though the very thought of
what you say repulses me. I hope that you find love and happiness in
your life and most of all I hope that whatever greater being you
believe in, gives you fulfillment.

As the other poster pointed out, I was being sarcastic. The reason
being that EVERYTIME the word 'jew' is mentioned, so is the obligatory
reference made to the holocaust. Admittedly my post was in
spectacularly bad taste, but so was the original post. I was just
following suit.

And there is no way anyone could really think I was serious. Who would
ever seriously say that the Jew's deserved it?

The point being (which I made NO effort to clarify) that the words
'jew' and 'holocaust' are used together far too often.

"/> I guess what *I* find the most disconcerting is that everyone howls
about the poor Jews and the Holocaust, but there is not so much as a
whimper about other and even greater atrocities such as Pol Pot and
his Killing Fields, Rwanda, or even Idi Amin. The world has
conveniently forgotten those &quot;Holocausts.&quot;

I suspect this is because the Jews have more political and financial
leverage than the other unfortunates.

Don't even bother with any &quot;anti-semetic&quot; bullshit with me. A
&quot;semite&quot; is considered to be anyone of middle-eastern origin and
encompasses Arabs, Jews, Kurds, etc. It is not the exclusive domain
of the Jews. I have no animosity towards any of them, however I decry
the &quot;protected status&quot; of the Jews that seems to permeate all legal
prosecutions in the United States and many other countries.

The Jews threatened National Socialism because they're not particularly
'nationalist' kinds of guys. As an oppressed people under a lot of regimes,
they don't go for the okeydoke much anymore.
The same happened among tribal groups like the Gypsies; ideological groups
like the Seventh Day Adventists/Baptists/JW's; 'racial' groups of varying

religion is concerned with legalism. It's no surprise that the legal
profession is a specialty that appeals to them on a very spiritual level.
Sure was an interesting meeting between Roman Law, common law and
halachic/jesuitical reasoning though, wasn't it?

&gt; Judaism is a lot about Observance of the Law. Much of their commentary on

The war had nothing to do with the internment of Jews in the
concentration camps, the war was to prevent Hitler from taking over
Europe. The Jews of the world had declared war on Germany in 1933, so
their fate was partly of their own doing, but the war was not to save
them, it was to save the world from Fascism.

are almost as many different monuments as there are links listed by the
engine (and about 168,000 links are listed). In just the first few
links, I counted Los Angeles, Berlin, the Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Paris,
and so on.

It's big business, and it gets bigger all the time, even as the actual

do is deny another person's right to feel anger or pain. When the Holocaust
deniars do this, when they say, &quot;There are other people who suffered -- why
are you getting all the press &quot; implicit in that remark is the idea that the
Jews have no right to their suffering because other people on earth are
suffering. That is ridiculous. Everyone has a right to feel their pain and
to make all the movies they want to about it. So, seen Hotel Rwanda yet?

&gt; Nah- not of necessity.
&gt; I know a guy in a Gypsy family- they came here as refugees after WWII; most

&gt; labor camps, they just killed them.
&gt; They resent that most people have never heard of their history during that
&gt; period- nobody leading a claim for Reparations, or maybe their own country.

&gt;&gt; That comment does two things. It denies the Jews' right to
&gt;&gt; pain AND it makes them look as if they don't care about anyone else -- in
&gt;&gt; fact, are trying to downplay other people's right to pain.

&gt;&gt; How is that the fault of the Jews.

&gt; I was speaking to your accusation of anti-semitism and possible alternative
&gt; genesis' to the mind-set that seems to provoke you so much.

&gt;&gt; FWIW, the Jews were trying to get their
&gt;&gt; own country since before the Holocaust. Look up Theodor Hertzl.

&gt; Nah; the New Testament is enough credential for me- it almost certainly
&gt; predates Hertzl's claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The guilt of the Holocaust lies with everybody except Jews, so,
&gt;&gt;&gt; automatically, if one is not Jewish, one is, perforce, guilty.
&gt;&gt; What a way to make Jews look bad! We sure don't think that anyone who
&gt;&gt; isn't
&gt;&gt; Jewish is guilty, but as long as you say that and people believe it, you
&gt;&gt; will achieve your goal of making the Jews look really bad.

&gt; What?
&gt; Now you think *I* have some agenda??
&gt; Little girl; you need to check yourself, you're seeing a boogyman under
&gt; every Bush.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's like blaming people of Finnish extraction for the slavery of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; South, just because they come from the same group as the hereditary
&gt;&gt;&gt; masters, instead of the hereditary slaves.
&gt;&gt; It would be -- but Jews don't do that.

&gt; Look at the blame Jews put on America for not intervening more quickly, or
&gt; encouraging immigration, or on 'Christians' for not compelling the Pontiff
&gt; of Rome to resist, or German Lutherans for going in the army.

"/> When unequivacal proof of the exterminations was presented to the
British, they deferred from bombing Auschwitz as that would cause
unnecessary diversion of war effort and presented logistical
problems...they were able to bomb the concentration camp 4 miles down
the road (because it was an IG Farben factory camp.) In these very same
messages discussing the bombing of the camps (it is possible that
destroying the crematoria would have slowed the germans down and most
certainly would have required them to divert troops and materials to the
camps to protect them) the fear was expressed that freeing such large
amounts of jews might inevitably lead to them showing up in Britian and
even America.

There was not a whole lot of outrage coming from the churches or the
Pope over this matter but they were certainly willing to assist the
movement of germans (nazis) after the war to escape the consequences (no
wonder, it was only relatively recently that the pope declared that jews
hadn't killed christ).

Of course when one compares this to what the citizens of Denmark
accomplished in something like 2 days (saving over 95% of the jewish
population by smuggling them into Sweden) it shows what was possible.

Then there is Yad Vashem (sic) that proves there were some that lived a
more moral life.

There are other possible reasons why someone might seek to deny the
Holocaust.

Personally, I think it a bit futile. There's plenty of documentation
that proves the reality of genocides committed by Germans in the Nazi
era--the Germans are excellent recordkeepers, even when they know they
are committing crimes against humanity. Some of the _details_ are
debatable, but the reality of mass genocide is irrefutable in the face
of the evidence; any threshold above the evidence available would also
put into question a great many other accepted historical facts (such as
the reality of the American Revolution, or the reality of the Roman
Empire).

1. The act of circumcising.

3. Circumcision

&gt;&gt; I was speaking to your accusation of anti-semitism and possible
&gt;&gt; alternative genesis' to the mind-set that seems to provoke you so

&gt;&gt;&gt; FWIW, the Jews were trying to get their

&gt;&gt; Nah; the New Testament is enough credential for me- it almost
&gt;&gt; certainly predates Hertzl's claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The thing about being a Jew, is that everybody else isn't.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The guilt of the Holocaust lies with everybody except Jews, so,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatically, if one is not Jewish, one is, perforce, guilty.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What a way to make Jews look bad! We sure don't think that anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt; who isn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jewish is guilty, but as long as you say that and people believe
&gt;&gt;&gt; it, you will achieve your goal of making the Jews look really bad.

&gt;&gt; What?

Now, Jews and sane people in general do NOT think that the guilt of the
Holocuast lies with everybody except Jews. Sane people do not believe that
Jews believe that, either. Why YOU believe that is open for debate. You
WANT people to believe Jews feel that way. I can tell you right now as a
Jew that I have NEVER met a Jew who felt that way. There certainly may be
Jews who feel that way, but the majority do not. Furthermore, why do you
think that ALL Jews feel the same way about that? Believing that all
members of a group are alike is a sign of prejudice. Furthermore, how DO
you feel about Jews? Now, let's see -- you think they ALL believe something
really stupid, something that you do not agree with -- that leads me to
believe that you cannot have a very high opinion of Jews.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be -- but Jews don't do that.

&gt;&gt; Look at the blame Jews put on America for not intervening more
&gt;&gt; quickly, or encouraging immigration, or on 'Christians' for not
&gt;&gt; compelling the Pontiff of Rome to resist, or German Lutherans for
&gt;&gt; going in the army.

&gt; certainly would have required them to divert troops and materials to
&gt; the camps to protect them) the fear was expressed that freeing such

&gt; that jews hadn't killed christ).

&gt; Of course when one compares this to what the citizens of Denmark
&gt; accomplished in something like 2 days (saving over 95% of the jewish
&gt; population by smuggling them into Sweden) it shows what was possible.

&gt; Then there is Yad Vashem (sic) that proves there were some that lived

It's a ridiculous thing to believe, as you yourself said. Therefore, if
you think an entire people believe that, I cannot imagine you could possibly

&gt; Nah- not of necessity.

&gt;&gt; That comment does two things. It denies the Jews' right to

&gt;&gt; -- in fact, are trying to downplay other people's right to pain.

Jews need to stop exploiting the Holocaust. You don't see other ethnic
groups that have been systematically persecuted and exterminated
exploit such sad events. I mean, the settlers basically came here and
killed off most of the natives yet you don't see native americans
making such a spectacle about it all the friggin time.

My father was editor of a local newspaper in south Texas when I was
younger and I remember him complaining to my mom about the Jews and how
they'd get on his ass everytime anything unflattering was published
about them. The owner of the paper would always end up giving in and
editing the articles written about them. They owned most of the stores
in town and they were a very close-knit community but god damn, were
they ever hateful towards those who weren't Jewish.

I work in the Behavioral Health field and I have got to say that from
what I've experienced, it is true many jews are cheap, stingy,
distrustful (if you're not a jew) selfish and obsessed with money. They
are a pain to work with and many of them seem to have a problem with my
(mixed) ethnicity and will ask if we have any Jewish counselors to work
with them. When they start getting all inquisitive I just tell them
&quot;Look, I'm Greek, Hispanic and Egyptian, if you don't like it, you are
free to find another counselor on your own&quot;... apparently they feel
that Greeks hate Jews; and Egyptians... well most of Egypt is
Arab-Muslim now (we're Alexandrians but descendants of Greeks anyway)
so you can imagine that doesn't go over too well with them. I have a
black coworker who is just about tired of them and their little
comments, and she commented to me that she had this old Jewish patient
who kept saying he did not trust black people and kept talking about
the whole Holocaust thing, about how hated Jews are and how they are so
discriminated against, etc... finally she got tired of his ranting and
told him: &quot;Look sir, I'm sorry you feel that you're discriminated
against but the truth is that white Christian people hate everyone, not
just Jews; they hate Mexicans, Blacks, Native Americans, they hate the
French, Russians, Arabs, Chinese, etc; so don't expect any sympathy
from me.&quot;
LOL! As far as I know, he's still seeing her for therapy.

&gt;&gt; Circumcision is genital mutilation, by definition.

"/> Be careful when you generalize like that, I'm circumcised and I don't feel

I'll give you that many circumcised men do feel they are doing their son a
favor with circumcision, and the same is true for circumcised women. Most
think it's great and they want their daughters to have it done as well, and
they just *know* they have not been damaged by it.

"/> Cutting off one finger from your child is not ok because someone else cut
two. Circumcision and clitorectomy are the same in principle, they both
violate child's right to bodily integrity.

Female genital mutilation law in the States does not make any distinction
sbased on the severity of the procedure. It classifies _all_ surgeries
performed on female child's genitals without medical necessity as a felony,
regardless if it's infibulation or just partial removal of the labias or
clitoral hood.

A day will come when this law will be challenged in the court because
discrimination is inherent in it's legislation - it religious or cultural
surgical alteration of female child's genitals without providing equal
protection to male children.

&gt;&gt; Nah- not of necessity.
&gt;&gt; I know a guy in a Gypsy family- they came here as refugees after

&gt;&gt; per capita losses to the nazi's; ruthlessly exterminated. They
&gt;&gt; didn't even use them in slave labor camps, they just killed them.
&gt;&gt; They resent that most people have never heard of their history
&gt;&gt; during that period- nobody leading a claim for Reparations, or maybe their
&gt;&gt; own country.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That comment does two things. It denies the Jews' right to
&gt;&gt;&gt; pain AND it makes them look as if they don't care about anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt; else -- in fact, are trying to downplay other people's right to
&gt;&gt;&gt; pain.

&gt;&gt; The thing about being a Jew, is that everybody else isn't.
&gt;&gt; The guilt of the Holocaust lies with everybody except Jews, so,
&gt;&gt; automatically, if one is not Jewish, one is, perforce, guilty.
&gt;&gt; It's like blaming people of Finnish extraction for the slavery of
&gt;&gt; the South, just because they come from the same group as the
&gt;&gt; hereditary masters, instead of the hereditary slaves.
&gt;&gt; Believe me, ma'am, you won't have to wonder about 'anti-semitism'
&gt;&gt; when you meet it; nothing subtle about it. Holding people guilty of
&gt;&gt; anti-Jewish feelings, who don't have them, leads to them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There you have it. If you don't support genital mutilation

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you support circumcision of males, that makes it genital
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mutilation?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Circumcision is genital mutilation, by definition.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You must have a very unique dictionary.

&gt;&gt;&gt; First, you should look up &quot;unique&quot; in your dictionary,
&gt;&gt;&gt; as you can't even use THAT word correctly. Then, look
&gt;&gt;&gt; up &quot;genital&quot; and &quot;mutilation.&quot;

&gt;&gt; genital mutilation
&gt;&gt; n.

&gt;&gt; The cutting or excision of all or some of the genital organs,
&gt;&gt; especially ritualistic clitoridectomy.

&gt; Circumcision is cutting of some of the genital organ,
&gt; so it meets this definition well. QED. Thanks for providing
&gt; the cite that proves that you are full of shit.

"/> The foreskin is not a genital organ. Cutting the foreskin is to genital
mutilation as cutting your fingernails is to amputation of your fingers.

Circumcision has no relation to cliterectomy.

Cliterectomy is practiced to deny sexual pleasure or temptation to
women. Circumcision (male) is practiced almost exclusively for sanitary
reasons.

Society in the States worships the pursuit of sexual pleasure.

"/> No one with an imperforate hymen experiences a menstrual flow, because
an imperforate hymen blocks the passage between the uterus and the
outside world.

Indeed, the lack of menstrual flow even well after the normal age for
menarche is a symptom of imperforate hymen. The treatment is surgical
incision of the hymen.

Imperforate hymens are quite rare. Most girls and women already have
openings in their hymens, especially by the time they reach puberty.
Because of this, they experience normal menarche and normal menstrual
flows, and thus have reason to use tampons. But the rare few who have
imperforate hymens experience no flow and thus have no reason to use
tampons.

In other words, tampons don't remove hymens, because any girl who still
has a fully intact hymen won't experience the menstrual flow that
tampons are designed to absorb (and thus won't wear them).

None of this has anything to do with 12-year-old virgins. Sometimes
studying a bit of medicine can be very enlightening.

So, then you would say an infant girl, born without a hymen is not a
virgin? There is no &quot;proof&quot; of virginity, either using the hymen
hypothesis or any other method.

You are saying that a 9 year old, who thought boys had cooties, who
didn't masturbate or participate in sports (aside from swimming), who
begins to have a menstrual flow is not a virgin.

Hope you have no contact with young girls, because you are, in *this*

&gt;&gt; vaginal canal, and thus blocks menstrual flow. Truly intact,
&gt;&gt; imperforate hymens are rare. No one who has a menstrual flow has an
&gt;&gt; imperforate hymen.

&gt; Which is why surgery is required, because the uterus doesn't care
&gt; whether the hymen is imperforate or not.

&gt;&gt; Furthermore, only an imperforate hymen is proof of virginity.

&gt;&quot;...the hymen is a poor indicator of actual virginity, because most
&gt; women break theirs through masturbation, tampon use, or non-sexual
&gt; activity before having sexual intercourse.&quot; quoted from:

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen

&gt; Have part
&gt;&gt; of a hymen is not. The hymen is flexible and won't necessarily be
&gt; torn
&gt;&gt; away by intercourse if it is not completely closed; nor will it
&gt;&gt; necessarily be torn away by tampons.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Seems to me that it's possible to have a hymen and a menstrual
&gt; flow.

&gt;&gt; Not an intact hymen of the sort that proves virginity. See above.
&gt;&gt; Sometimes it's necessary to look further than an online dictionary in
&gt;&gt; order to understand principles in medicine.

&gt; So, then you would say an infant girl, born without a hymen is not a
&gt; virgin? There is no &quot;proof&quot; of virginity, either using the hymen
&gt; hypothesis or any other method.

&gt; You are saying that a 9 year old, who thought boys had cooties, who
&gt; didn't masturbate or participate in sports (aside from swimming), who
&gt; begins to have a menstrual flow is not a virgin.

&gt; Hope you have no contact with young girls, because you are, in *this*
&gt; respect, an idiot.

&gt; So, then you would say an infant girl, born without a hymen is not a

"/> Being a virgin has nothing to do with the hymen. A virgin is someone
who has not engaged in sexual intercourse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is no &quot;proof&quot; of virginity, either using the hymen
&gt; hypothesis or any other method.

"/> An imperforate hymen completely blocks the vagina. Sexual intercourse
is impossible in that case (without breaking the hymen). So an
imperforate hymen proves virginity. But such a hymen is rare.

A complicating factor is that sexual abuse of young girls can damage the
hymen and produce scarring that closes it completely, in which case it
behaves like an imperforate hymen (in blocking menstrual flow, for
example), but does not prove virginity (quite the contrary, alas!).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You are saying that a 9 year old, who thought boys had cooties, who
&gt; didn't masturbate or participate in sports (aside from swimming), who
&gt; begins to have a menstrual flow is not a virgin.

"/> No. Being a virgin has NOTHING TO DO with the hymen, and everything to
do with sexual experience (or the lack thereof).

The only connection between a hymen and virginity is that a congenitally
imperforate hymen that remains so later in life is proof that
intercourse has not taken place (since intercourse would perforate it).
But this is quite rare (far less than 0.1% of females have imperforate
hymens, and fewer still retain them until puberty or beyond, since the
hymen will often rupture spontaneously for reasons other than
penetration in sexual intercourse).

Note, by the way, that most girls at puberty have a hymenal opening that
is just about the same size as a tampon, and thus can use tampons
without further damaging the hymen, although whether or not it remains
intact depends on a number of things (and it's not really important,
because a hymen with an opening does not prove or disprove virginity).

"/> It doesn't. It just backs up, and eventually produces symptoms. The
lack of a menstrual flow after the normal age for menarche and/or these
symptoms usually bring a girl to the doctor, where the problem is
discovered and corrected surgically (by opening the hymen).

Since the vast majority of girls do experience menarche and a menstrual
flow after puberty, it follows that the vast majority of girls do not
have an imperforate hymen, which in turn means that the state of their
hymens cannot prove or disprove virginity. Furthermore, the use of a
tampon is largely irrelevant, since the hymen is already open.

It surprises me sometimes how little people know about their own

You Jews have been brainwashed into believing a story that some old
100 year old senile blind man named Abraham said that he heard the
voice of God in the desert 3,000 years ago telling him to circumcise
his son so all Jews for generations since practice this &quot;harmless&quot;

foreskins of millions of young baby boys to satisfy his blood lust.
Nice &quot;God&quot; we have here, sounds more like a pedophile.

So you have to convince everyone else that your genital mutilations
are normal and A-Okay to protect yourselves.

Tell you what, start circumcising little girls too if you don't think

evidence that circumcision dulls heterosexual pleasure in females is
much stronger than for males. The problem in getting data is that by
the time an adult completely recovers from the operation, he has
forgotten exactly how things felt with a foreskin. If there were a

Under this definition, male circumcision might or might not be
mutilation, depending on why it is done. Circumcision makes personal
hygiene easier--whether or not this justifies surgery is an open
question. Most circumcision is religiously motivated, and thus would
qualify as mutilation. Of course, body piercing is mutilation, also, as
are tatoos.

&gt; tradition, but that's not good enough reason as far as I'm concerned).

Removing both of a women's breasts prophylactically once she's achieved
maturity would also go a long way in improving breast cancer statistics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I should think the key distinguishing character of mutilation would be

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Except for homosexuals who practice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certain activities, removing the foreskin does not ruin any essential

&gt;&gt;&gt;True, but at the same time, removal of the foreskin isn't necessary. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;_is_ convenient, from a hygiene standpoint, but it isn't required.

&gt;&gt; You are such a hysterical, crackpot, fanatic that you don't notice
&gt;&gt; that you are contradicting yourself. You say that something that
&gt;&gt; doesn't have a useful purpose is mutilation and then admit that it has
&gt;&gt; some hygienic value.

&gt; Removing all the bells and whistles from the vaginal area would also have
&gt; some hygienic value -- who needs all those complicated, gunk-inviting folds?
&gt; Wouldn't a plain old unencumbered hole be more hygienic and asethetic?

&gt;&gt;&gt;The foreskin is part of a genital organ.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cutting the foreskin is to genital mutilation as cutting

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not at all. Fingernails are not alive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Circumcision (male) is practiced almost exclusively for sanitary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Circumcision is practised mainly for religious reasons.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just cite a dictionary that does specifically say that circumcision is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; genital mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Whether or not something appears in a dictionary does not affect its
&gt;&gt;&gt;reality.

&gt;&gt; The key issue in characterizing something as mutilation is whether it
&gt;&gt; destroys an essential function. Except for homosexuals who practice
&gt;&gt; certain activities, removing the foreskin does not ruin any essential
&gt;&gt; function of the penis. Just like removing hemorrhoids does not
&gt;&gt; destroy any essential function of one's rectum.

&gt; Yes, if you get to invent your own definition of mutilation
&gt; and inject it into the argument as aziomatix, of course, you
&gt;&quot;win.&quot; Or if you, like Robert Moron, invent your own definition
&gt; of how definitions work, you &quot;win.&quot; In some parallel bizarro

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A right to pain is a right that I could proabably do without. Pain is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, if Jews are concerned about the keeping the memory

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody. But that doesn't mean that maintaining a double standard--one

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That doesn't mean Jews ignore other genocides -- as Elie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wiesel's work in Bosnia should show.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How many monuments to other genocides are there ... especially outside
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the areas in which they occurred?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't hold up Elie Wiesel, who famously couldn't find it in
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself to mourn the victims at Shatila, as an example of compassion.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, but I can't find anything about that, would you be so kind as to
&gt;&gt; post a link.

find this:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Similarly, after the Sabra and Shatila massacres, Wiesel said, &quot;I don't think
&gt; we should even comment [on the massacre in the refugee camps] since the
&gt; [Israeli judicial] investigation is still on .... We should not pass judgment
&gt; until the investigation takes place.&quot; (p. 386)

"/> Which doesn't seem totally unreasonable. So you can show me his lack of
compassion after the investigation happened and the results released?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;There

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jews claiming all the attention for themselves,&quot; I would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recognize the inherent anti-Semitism in that remark.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nah- not of necessity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know a guy in a Gypsy family- they came here as refugees after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WWII; most of the family wiped out. The Gypsies suffered the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; highest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; per capita losses to the nazi's; ruthlessly exterminated. They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't even use them in slave labor camps, they just killed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They resent that most people have never heard of their history
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during that period- nobody leading a claim for Reparations, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maybe their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; own country.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That comment does two things. It denies the Jews' right to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pain AND it makes them look as if they don't care about anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; else -- in fact, are trying to downplay other people's right
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pain.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The thing about being a Jew, is that everybody else isn't.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The guilt of the Holocaust lies with everybody except Jews, so,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatically, if one is not Jewish, one is, perforce, guilty.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's like blaming people of Finnish extraction for the slavery
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the South, just because they come from the same group as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hereditary masters, instead of the hereditary slaves.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Believe me, ma'am, you won't have to wonder about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'anti-semitism'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when you meet it; nothing subtle about it. Holding people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guilty of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-Jewish feelings, who don't have them, leads to them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tou-fuckin'-ché ... Chas!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Holding people guilty of anti-Jewish feelings, who don't have

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A right to pain is a right that I could proabably do without. Pain is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an affliction in my book.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, if Jews are concerned about the keeping the memory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the Holocaust alive, who on earth could blame them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody. But that doesn't mean that maintaining a double standard--one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for crimes against Jews and one for crimes against everyone else--is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That doesn't mean Jews ignore other genocides -- as Elie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wiesel's work in Bosnia should show.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How many monuments to other genocides are there ... especially outside
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the areas in which they occurred?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't hold up Elie Wiesel, who famously couldn't find it in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; himself to mourn the victims at Shatila, as an example of compassion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, but I can't find anything about that, would you be so kind as to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; post a link.

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com?query=elie+wiesel+sabra+shatila

&gt;&gt; Like I didn't google on it. I just can't find your specific claim. I
&gt;&gt; did find this:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Similarly, after the Sabra and Shatila massacres, Wiesel said, &quot;I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; think we should even comment [on the massacre in the refugee camps]
&gt;&gt;&gt; since the [Israeli judicial] investigation is still on .... We should
&gt;&gt;&gt; not pass judgment until the investigation takes place.&quot; (p. 386)

&gt;&gt; Which doesn't seem totally unreasonable. So you can show me his lack of
&gt;&gt; compassion after the investigation happened and the results released?

&gt;Can I prove a negative? No. Can you show evidence of his compassion?

"/> Oi! I'm the only authorised Reverend on the jew newsgroups.

I believe that this may have influenced Mr Bush in his formative

I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find someone to call mine
But mama said

You can’t hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don’t come easy
It’s a game of give and take

You can’t hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches
Must I stand before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin’ on
When I feel my strength, yeah
It’s almost gone
I remember mama said:

You can’t hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don’t come easy
It’s a game of give and take

How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness will cause my heart
Heart to break?

No I can’t bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that i, I can’t go on
These precious words keeps me hangin’ on
I remember mama said:

You can’t hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don’t come easy
It’s a game of give and take

You can’t hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

No, love, love, don’t come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting
But it ain’t easy
It ain’t easy
But mama said:

You can’t hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A right to pain is a right that I could proabably do without. Pain is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an affliction in my book.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, if Jews are concerned about the keeping the memory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the Holocaust alive, who on earth could blame them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody. But that doesn't mean that maintaining a double standard--one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for crimes against Jews and one for crimes against everyone else--is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That doesn't mean Jews ignore other genocides -- as Elie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wiesel's work in Bosnia should show.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How many monuments to other genocides are there ... especially outside
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the areas in which they occurred?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wouldn't hold up Elie Wiesel, who famously couldn't find it in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; himself to mourn the victims at Shatila, as an example of compassion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, but I can't find anything about that, would you be so kind as to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; post a link.

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com?query=elie+wiesel+sabra+shatila

&gt;&gt; Like I didn't google on it. I just can't find your specific claim. I
&gt;&gt; did find this:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Similarly, after the Sabra and Shatila massacres, Wiesel said, &quot;I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; think we should even comment [on the massacre in the refugee camps]
&gt;&gt;&gt; since the [Israeli judicial] investigation is still on .... We should
&gt;&gt;&gt; not pass judgment until the investigation takes place.&quot; (p. 386)

&gt;&gt; Which doesn't seem totally unreasonable. So you can show me his lack of
&gt;&gt; compassion after the investigation happened and the results released?

&gt; Can I prove a negative? No. Can you show evidence of his compassion?

"/> But is it a negative?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The key issue in characterizing something as mutilation is whether it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; destroys an essential function.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I should think the key distinguishing character of mutilation would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its lack of any useful purpose. It need not destroy an essential
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; function, it need only be unnecessary.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Except for homosexuals who practice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certain activities, removing the foreskin does not ruin any essential
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; function of the penis.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; True, but at the same time, removal of the foreskin isn't necessary. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _is_ convenient, from a hygiene standpoint, but it isn't required.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are such a hysterical, crackpot, fanatic that you don't notice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are contradicting yourself. You say that something that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't have a useful purpose is mutilation and then admit that it has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some hygienic value.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Removing all the bells and whistles from the vaginal area would also have
&gt;&gt;&gt; some hygienic value -- who needs all those complicated, gunk-inviting
&gt;&gt;&gt; folds?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wouldn't a plain old unencumbered hole be more hygienic and asethetic?
&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand, I've heard it... oh, through the grapevine.....that
&gt;&gt;&gt; uncircumcized men can take a radical step (soap and water, occasionally)
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; not be any the worse for wear (and tear!)

&gt;&gt; Based on my experiences around young adults[1], this indeed would be a
&gt;&gt; radical step for a large percentage of them.

&gt;&gt; [1] in a purely work related environment

&gt; I'm wondering what work environment brings you into contact with the
&gt; penile hygiene habits of your colleagues?

"/> You would. I never mentioned the penile hygiene habits of these young

&gt;&gt; Professor Ross (1964) of the University of Motown, Detroit.

&gt;&gt; I believe that this may have influenced Mr Bush in his formative

&gt;&gt; I need love, love
&gt;&gt; To ease my mind
&gt;&gt; I need to find, find someone to call mine
&gt;&gt; But mama said

&gt;&gt; You can't hurry love
&gt;&gt; No, you just have to wait
&gt;&gt; She said love don't come easy
&gt;&gt; It's a game of give and take

&gt; I believe this professor used to teach with two others. I think they
&gt; were known as The Supreme Professors.

&gt; There's this thing being taught in American schools called Second
&gt; Virginity. Once you've had sex (doesn't matter how many times) if you
&gt; make a vow not to have any more until you get married, you're a virgin
&gt; again. You get to wear a virgin ring or something like that.

&gt;No, you're sadly mistaken. Although the word &quot;Semite&quot; generally

&gt;not be obvious at first glance.

&gt;Are there any other facts that you'd like to get totally

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; you seem to read:
&gt;&gt;&quot;death to the Jewish scum&quot;

&gt;&gt; Why is that?

&gt;I agree that all genocides are loathesome. If someone said, &quot;All genocides
&gt;are horrible,&quot; I would agree. However, if someone said, &quot;There have been
&gt;many genocides besides the Holocaust, so why are the Jews claiming all the
&gt;attention for themselves,&quot; I would recognize the inherent anti-Semitism in
&gt;that remark. That comment does two things. It denies the Jews' right to
&gt;pain AND it makes them look as if they don't care about anyone else -- in
&gt;fact, are trying to downplay other people's right to pain. It's a shabby
&gt;trick and doubtless works on the stupid. However, if Jews are concerned
&gt;about the keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive, who on earth could
&gt;blame them?

"/> To draw a parallel, does it surprise anyone when they see a person visit
the grave of a relative and leave flowers, yet they don't lay flowers on
all the other graves in a cemetery even though they do show respect for
them by not walking across them?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That doesn't mean Jews ignore other genocides -- as Elie
&gt;Wiesel's work in Bosnia should show. I hope that the people of Sudan can
&gt;educate us about what is happening in their country. In fact, my status as
&gt;a Jew means -- and I was told this in Hebrew school and in my home -- that I
&gt;HAVE to care about people suffering injustice anywhere -- and I have to do
&gt;something about it. I think this liberal belief held by many Jews also
&gt;infuriates the deniars and makes them want to characterize Jews as evil even
&gt;more. You are a deniar, aren't you?

http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/marshall_gauvin/did_jesus_...

Did Jesus Christ Really Live?

by Marshall J. Gauvin

Scientific inquiry into the origins of Christianity begins to-day with the question: &quot;Did Jesus Christ really live?&quot; Was there a man named Jesus, who was called the Christ, living in Palestine nineteen centuries ago, of whose life and teachings we have a correct account in the New Testament? The orthodox idea that Christ was the son of God -- God himself in human form -- that he was the creator of the countless millions of glowing suns and wheeling worlds that strew the infinite expanse of the universe; that the forces of nature were the servants of his will and changed their courses at his command -- such an idea has been abandoned by every independent thinker in the world -- by every thinker who relies on reason and experience rather than mere faith -- by every man of science who places the integrity of nature above the challenge of ancient religious tales.

Not only has the divinity of Christ been given up, but his existence as a man is being more and more seriously questioned. Some of the ablest scholars of the world deny that he ever lived at all. A commanding literature dealing with the inquiry, intense in its seriousness and profound and thorough in its research, is growing up in all countries, and spreading the conviction that Christ is a myth. The question is one of tremendous importance. For the Freethinker, as well as for the Christian, it is of the weightiest significance. The Christian religion has been and is a mighty fact in the world. For good or for ill, it has absorbed for many centuries the best energies of mankind. It has stayed the march of civilization, and made martyrs of some of the noblest men and women of the race: and it is to-day the greatest enemy of knowledge, of freedom, of social and industrial improvement, and of the genuine brotherhood of mankind. The progressive forces of the world are at war with this Asiatic superstition, and this war will continue until the triumph of truth and freedom is complete. The question, &quot;Did Jesus Christ Really Live?&quot; goes to the very root of the conflict between reason and faith; and upon its determination depends, to some degree, the decision as to whether religion or humanity shall rule the world.

Whether Christ did, or did not live, has nothing at all to do with what the churches teach, or with what we believe, It is wholly a matter of evidence. It is a question of science. The question is -- what does history say? And that question must be settled in the court of historical criticism. If the thinking world is to hold to the position that Christ was a real character, there must be sufficient evidence to warrant that belief. If no evidence for his existence can be found; if history returns the verdict that his name is not inscribed upon her scroll, if it be found that his story was created by art and ingenuity, like the stories of fictitious heroes, he will have to take his place with the host of other demigods whose fancied lives and deeds make up the mythology of the world.

What, then, is the evidence that Jesus Christ lived in this world as a man? The authorities relied upon to prove the reality of Christ are the four Gospels of the New Testament -- Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. These Gospels, and these alone, tell the story of his life. Now we know absolutely nothing of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, apart from what is said of them in the Gospels. Moreover, the Gospels themselves do not claim to have been written by these men. They are not called &quot;The Gospel of Matthew,&quot; or &quot;The Gospel of Mark,&quot; but &quot;The Gospel According to Matthew,&quot;&quot;The Gospel According to Mark,&quot;&quot;The Gospel According to Luke,&quot; and &quot;The Gospel According to John.&quot; No human being knows who wrote a single line in one of these Gospels. No human being knows when they were written, or where. Biblical scholarship has established the fact that the Gospel of Mark is the oldest of the four. The chief reasons for this conclusion are that this Gospel is shorter, simpler, and more natural, than any of the other three. It is shown that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were enlarged from the Gospel of Mark. The Gospel of Mark knows nothing of the virgin birth, of the Sermon on the Mount, of the Lord's prayer, or of other important facts of the supposed life of Christ. These features were added by Matthew and Luke.

But the Gospel of Mark, as we have it, is not the original Mark. In the same way that the writers of Matthew and Luke copied and enlarged the Gospel of Mark, Mark copied and enlarged an earlier document which is called the &quot;original Mark.&quot; This original source perished in the early age of the Church. What it was, who wrote it, where it was written, nobody knows. The Gospel of John is admitted by Christian scholars to be an unhistorical document. They acknowledge that it is not a life of Christ, but an interpretation of him; that it gives us an idealized and spiritualized picture of what Christ is supposed to have been, and that it is largely composed of the speculations of Greek philosophy. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, which are called the &quot;Synoptic Gospels,&quot; on the one hand, and the Gospel of John, on the other, stand at opposite extremes of thought. So complete is the difference between the teaching of the first three Gospels and that of the fourth, that every critic admits that if Jesus taught as the Synoptics relate, he could not possibly have taught as John declares. Indeed, in the first three Gospels and in the fourth, we meet with two entirely different Christs. Did I say two? It should be three; for, according to Mark, Christ was a man; according to Matthew and Luke, he was a demigod; while John insists that he was God himself.

There is not the smallest fragment of trustworthy evidence to show that any of the Gospels were in existence, in their present form, earlier than a hundred years after the time at which Christ is supposed to have died. Christian scholars, having no reliable means by which to fix the date of their composition, assign them to as early an age as their calculations and their guesses will allow; but the dates thus arrived at are far removed from the age of Christ or his apostles. We are told that Mark was written some time after the year 70, Luke about 110, Matthew about 130, and John not earlier than 140 A.D. Let me impress upon you that these dates are conjectural, and that they are made as early as possible. The first historical mention of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, was made by the Christian Father, St. Irenaeus, about the year 190 A.D. The only earlier mention of any of the Gospels was made by Theopholis of Antioch, who mentioned the Gospel of John in 180 A.D.

There is absolutely nothing to show that these Gospels -- the only sources of authority as to the existence of Christ -- were written until a hundred and fifty years after the events they pretend to describe. Walter R. Cassels, the learned author of &quot;Supernatural Religion,&quot; one of the greatest works ever written on the origins of Christianity, says: &quot;After having exhausted the literature and the testimony bearing on the point, we have not found a single distinct trace of any of those Gospels during the first century and a half after the death of Christ.&quot; How can Gospels which were not written until a hundred and fifty years after Christ is supposed to have died, and which do not rest on any trustworthy testimony, have the slightest value as evidence that he really lived? History must be founded upon genuine documents or on living proof. Were a man of to-day to attempt to write the life of a supposed character of a hundred and fifty years ago, without any historical documents upon which to base his narrative, his work would not be a history, it would be a romance. Not a single statement in it could be relied upon.

Christ is supposed to have been a Jew, and his disciples are said to have been Jewish fishermen. His language, and the language of his followers must, therefore, have been Aramaic -- the popular language of Palestine in that age. But the Gospels are written in Greek -- every one of them. Nor were they translated from some other language. Every leading Christian scholar since Erasmus, four hundred years ago, has maintained that they were originally written in Greek. This proves that they were not written by Christ's disciples, or by any of the early Christians. Foreign Gospels, written by unknown men, in a foreign tongue, several generations after the death of those who are supposed to have known the facts -- such is the evidence relied upon to prove that Jesus lived.

But while the Gospels were written several generations too late to be of authority, the original documents, such as they were, were not preserved. The Gospels that were written in the second century no longer exist. They have been lost or destroyed. The oldest Gospels that we have are supposed to be copies of copies of copies that were made from those Gospels. We do not know who made these copies; we do not know when they were made; nor do we know whether they were honestly made. Between the earliest Gospels and the oldest existing manuscripts of the New Testament, there is a blank gulf of three hundred years. It is, therefore, impossible to say what the original Gospels contained.

There were many Gospels in circulation in the early centuries, and a large number of them were forgeries. Among these were the &quot;Gospel of Paul,&quot; the Gospel of Bartholomew,&quot; the &quot;Gospel of Judas Iscariot,&quot; the &quot;Gospel of the Egyptians,&quot; the &quot;Gospel or Recollections of Peter,&quot; the &quot;Oracles or Sayings of Christ,&quot; and scores of other pious productions, a collection of which may still be read in &quot;The Apocryphal New Testament.&quot; Obscure men wrote Gospels and attached the names of prominent Christian characters to them, to give them the appearance of importance. Works were ...

prone to such error and fraud, what are we to make
of the even more antiquated &quot;stories&quot; written over B.C.E ?

Did the Jewish &quot;god&quot; really exist?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; by Marshall J. Gauvin

&gt; Scientific inquiry into the origins of Christianity begins to-day
&gt; with the question: &quot;Did Jesus Christ really live?&quot; Was there a man
&gt; named Jesus, who was called the Christ, living in Palestine nineteen
&gt; centuries ago, of whose life and teachings we have a correct account
&gt; in the New Testament? The orthodox idea that Christ was the son of
&gt; God -- God himself in human form -- that he was the creator of the
&gt; countless millions of glowing suns and wheeling worlds that strew the
&gt; infinite expanse of the universe; that the forces of nature were the
&gt; servants of his will and changed their courses at his command -- such
&gt; an idea has been abandoned by every independent thinker in the world
&gt; -- by every thinker who relies on reason and experience rather than
&gt; mere faith -- by every man of science who places the integrity of
&gt; nature above the challenge of ancient religious tales.

&gt; Not only has the divinity of Christ been given up, but his existence
&gt; as a man is being more and more seriously questioned. Some of the
&gt; ablest scholars of the world deny that he ever lived at all. A
&gt; commanding literature dealing with the inquiry, intense in its
&gt; seriousness and profound and thorough in its research, is growing up
&gt; in all countries, and spreading the conviction that Christ is a myth.
&gt; The question is one of tremendous importance. For the Freethinker, as
&gt; well as for the Christian, it is of the weightiest significance. The
&gt; Christian religion has been and is a mighty fact in the world. For
&gt; good or for ill, it has absorbed for many centuries the best energies
&gt; of mankind. It has stayed the march of civilization, and made martyrs
&gt; of some of the noblest men and women of the race: and it is to-day
&gt; the greatest enemy of knowledge, of freedom, of social and industrial
&gt; improvement, and of the genuine brotherhood of mankind. The
&gt; progressive forces of the world are at war with this Asiatic
&gt; superstition, and this war will continue until the triumph of truth
&gt; and freedom is complete. The question, &quot;Did Jesus Christ Really
&gt; Live?&quot; goes to the very root of the conflict between reason and
&gt; faith; and upon its determination depends, to some degree, the
&gt; decision as to whether religion or humanity shall rule the world.

&gt; Whether Christ did, or did not live, has nothing at all to do with
&gt; what the churches teach, or with what we believe, It is wholly a
&gt; matter of evidence. It is a question of science. The question is --
&gt; what does history say? And that question must be settled in the court
&gt; of historical criticism. If the thinking world is to hold to the
&gt; position that Christ was a real character, there must be sufficient
&gt; evidence to warrant that belief. If no evidence for his existence can
&gt; be found; if history returns the verdict that his name is not
&gt; inscribed upon her scroll, if it be found that his story was created
&gt; by art and ingenuity, like the stories of fictitious heroes, he will
&gt; have to take his place with the host of other demigods whose fancied
&gt; lives and deeds make up the mythology of the world.

&gt; What, then, is the evidence that Jesus Christ lived in this world as
&gt; a man? The authorities relied upon to prove the reality of Christ are
&gt; the four Gospels of the New Testament -- Matthew, Mark, Luke and
&gt; John. These Gospels, and these alone, tell the story of his life. Now
&gt; we know absolutely nothing of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, apart
&gt; from what is said of them in the Gospels. Moreover, the Gospels
&gt; themselves do not claim to have been written by these men. They are
&gt; not called &quot;The Gospel of Matthew,&quot; or &quot;The Gospel of Mark,&quot; but &quot;The
&gt; Gospel According to Matthew,&quot;&quot;The Gospel According to Mark,&quot;&quot;The
&gt; Gospel According to Luke,&quot; and &quot;The Gospel According to John.&quot; No
&gt; human being knows who wrote a single line in one of these Gospels. No
&gt; human being knows when they were written, or where. Biblical
&gt; scholarship has established the fact that the Gospel of Mark is the
&gt; oldest of the four. The chief reasons for this conclusion are that
&gt; this Gospel is shorter, simpler, and more natural, than any of the
&gt; other three. It is shown that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were
&gt; enlarged from the Gospel of Mark. The Gospel of Mark knows nothing of
&gt; the virgin birth, of the Sermon on the Mount, of the Lord's prayer,
&gt; or of other important facts of the supposed life of Christ. These
&gt; features were added by Matthew and Luke.

&gt; But the Gospel of Mark, as we have it, is not the original Mark. In
&gt; the same way that the writers of Matthew and Luke copied and enlarged
&gt; the Gospel of Mark, Mark copied and enlarged an earlier document
&gt; which is called the &quot;original Mark.&quot; This original source perished in
&gt; the early age of the Church. What it was, who wrote it, where it was
&gt; written, nobody knows. The Gospel of John is admitted by Christian
&gt; scholars to be an unhistorical document. They acknowledge that it is
&gt; not a life of Christ, but an interpretation of him; that it gives us
&gt; an idealized and spiritualized picture of what Christ is supposed to
&gt; have been, and that it is largely composed of the speculations of
&gt; Greek philosophy. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, which are
&gt; called the &quot;Synoptic Gospels,&quot; on the one hand, and the Gospel of
&gt; John, on the other, stand at opposite extremes of thought. So
&gt; complete is the difference between the teaching of the first three
&gt; Gospels and that of the fourth, that every critic admits that if
&gt; Jesus taught as the Synoptics relate, he could not possibly have
&gt; taught as John declares. Indeed, in the first three Gospels and in
&gt; the fourth, we meet with two entirely different Christs. Did I say
&gt; two? It should be three; for, according to Mark, Christ was a man;
&gt; according to Matthew and Luke, he was a demigod; while John insists
&gt; that he was God himself.

&gt; There is not the smallest fragment of trustworthy evidence to show
&gt; that any of the Gospels were in existence, in their present form,
&gt; earlier than a hundred years after the time at which Christ is
&gt; supposed to have died. Christian scholars, having no reliable means
&gt; by which to fix the date of their composition, assign them to as
&gt; early an age as their calculations and their guesses will allow; but
&gt; the dates thus arrived at are far removed from the age of Christ or
&gt; his apostles. We are told that Mark was written some time after the
&gt; year 70, Luke about 110, Matthew about 130, and John not earlier than
&gt; 140 A.D. Let me impress upon you that these dates are conjectural,
&gt; and that they are made as early as possible. The first historical
&gt; mention of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, was made by the
&gt; Christian Father, St. Irenaeus, about the year 190 A.D. The only
&gt; earlier mention of any of the Gospels was made by Theopholis of
&gt; Antioch, who mentioned the Gospel of John in 180 A.D.

&gt; There is absolutely nothing to show that these Gospels -- the only
&gt; sources of authority as to the existence of Christ -- were written
&gt; until a hundred and fifty years after the events they pretend to
&gt; describe. Walter R. Cassels, the learned author of &quot;Supernatural
&gt; Religion,&quot; one of the greatest works ever written on the origins of
&gt; Christianity, says: &quot;After having exhausted the literature and the
&gt; testimony bearing on the point, we have not found a single distinct
&gt; trace of any of those Gospels during the first century and a half
&gt; after the death of Christ.&quot; How can Gospels which were not written
&gt; until a hundred and fifty years after Christ is supposed to have
&gt; died, and which do not rest on any trustworthy testimony, have the
&gt; slightest value as evidence that he really lived? History must be
&gt; founded upon genuine documents or on living proof. Were a man of
&gt; to-day to attempt to write the life of a supposed character of a
&gt; hundred and fifty years ago, without any historical documents upon
&gt; which to base his narrative, his work would not be a history, it
&gt; would be a romance. Not a single statement in it could be relied
&gt; upon.

&gt; Christ is supposed to have been a Jew, and his disciples are said to
&gt; have been Jewish fishermen. His language, and the language of his
&gt; followers must, therefore, have been Aramaic -- the popular language
&gt; of Palestine in that age. But the Gospels are written in Greek --
&gt; every one of them. Nor were they translated from some other language.
&gt; Every leading Christian scholar since Erasmus, four hundred years
&gt; ago, has maintained that they were originally written in Greek. This
&gt; proves that they were not written by Christ's disciples, or by any of
&gt; the early Christians. Foreign Gospels, written by unknown men, in a
&gt; foreign tongue, several generations after the death of those who are
&gt; supposed to have known the facts -- such is the evidence relied upon
&gt; to prove that Jesus lived.

&gt; But while the Gospels were written several generations too late to be
&gt; of authority, the original documents, such as they were, were not
&gt; preserved. The Gospels that were written in the second century no
&gt; longer exist. They have been lost or destroyed. The oldest Gospels
&gt; that we have are supposed to be copies of copies of copies that were
&gt; made from those Gospels. We do not know who made these copies; we do
&gt; not know when they were made; nor do we know whether they were
&gt; honestly made. Between the earliest Gospels and the oldest existing
&gt; manuscripts of the New Testament, there is a blank gulf of three
&gt; hundred years. It is, therefore, impossible to say what the original
&gt; Gospels contained.

&gt; There were many Gospels in circulation in the early

: Did the Jewish &quot;god&quot; really exist?
:
:
: &gt;
: &gt; by Marshall J. Gauvin
: &gt;
: &gt; Scientific inquiry into the origins of Christianity begins to-day
: &gt; with the question: &quot;Did Jesus Christ really live?&quot; Was there a man
: &gt; named Jesus, who was called the Christ, living in Palestine nineteen
: &gt; centuries ago, of whose life and teachings we have a correct account
: &gt; in the New Testament? The orthodox idea that Christ was the son of
: &gt; God -- God himself in human form -- that he was the creator of the
: &gt; countless millions of glowing suns and wheeling worlds that strew the
: &gt; infinite expanse of the universe; that the forces of nature were the
: &gt; servants of his will and changed their courses at his command -- such
: &gt; an idea has been abandoned by every independent thinker in the world
: &gt; -- by every thinker who relies on reason and experience rather than
: &gt; mere faith -- by every man of science who places the integrity of
: &gt; nature above the challenge of ancient religious tales.
: &gt;
: &gt; Not only has the divinity of Christ been given up, but his existence
: &gt; as a man is being more and more seriously questioned. Some of the
: &gt; ablest scholars of the world deny that he ever lived at all. A
: &gt; commanding literature dealing with the inquiry, intense in its
: &gt; seriousness and profound and thorough in its research, is growing up
: &gt; in all countries, and spreading the conviction that Christ is a myth.
: &gt; The question is one of tremendous importance. For the Freethinker, as
: &gt; well as for the Christian, it is of the weightiest significance. The
: &gt; Christian religion has been and is a mighty fact in the world. For
: &gt; good or for ill, it has absorbed for many centuries the best energies
: &gt; of mankind. It has stayed the march of civilization, and made martyrs
: &gt; of some of the noblest men and women of the race: and it is to-day
: &gt; the greatest enemy of knowledge, of freedom, of social and industrial
: &gt; improvement, and of the genuine brotherhood of mankind. The
: &gt; progressive forces of the world are at war with this Asiatic
: &gt; superstition, and this war will continue until the triumph of truth
: &gt; and freedom is complete. The question, &quot;Did Jesus Christ Really
: &gt; Live?&quot; goes to the very root of the conflict between reason and
: &gt; faith; and upon its determination depends, to some degree, the
: &gt; decision as to whether religion or humanity shall rule the world.
: &gt;
: &gt; Whether Christ did, or did not live, has nothing at all to do with
: &gt; what the churches teach, or with what we believe, It is wholly a
: &gt; matter of evidence. It is a question of science. The question is --
: &gt; what does history say? And that question must be settled in the court
: &gt; of historical criticism. If the thinking world is to hold to the
: &gt; position that Christ was a real character, there must be sufficient
: &gt; evidence to warrant that belief. If no evidence for his existence can
: &gt; be found; if history returns the verdict that his name is not
: &gt; inscribed upon her scroll, if it be found that his story was created
: &gt; by art and ingenuity, like the stories of fictitious heroes, he will
: &gt; have to take his place with the host of other demigods whose fancied
: &gt; lives and deeds make up the mythology of the world.
: &gt;
: &gt; What, then, is the evidence that Jesus Christ lived in this world as
: &gt; a man? The authorities relied upon to prove the reality of Christ are
: &gt; the four Gospels of the New Testament -- Matthew, Mark, Luke and
: &gt; John. These Gospels, and these alone, tell the story of his life. Now
: &gt; we know absolutely nothing of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, apart
: &gt; from what is said of them in the Gospels. Moreover, the Gospels
: &gt; themselves do not claim to have been written by these men. They are
: &gt; not called &quot;The Gospel of Matthew,&quot; or &quot;The Gospel of Mark,&quot; but &quot;The
: &gt; Gospel According to Matthew,&quot;&quot;The Gospel According to Mark,&quot;&quot;The
: &gt; Gospel According to Luke,&quot; and &quot;The Gospel According to John.&quot; No
: &gt; human being knows who wrote a single line in one of these Gospels. No
: &gt; human being knows when they were written, or where. Biblical
: &gt; scholarship has established the fact that the Gospel of Mark is the
: &gt; oldest of the four. The chief reasons for this conclusion are that
: &gt; this Gospel is shorter, simpler, and more natural, than any of the
: &gt; other three. It is shown that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were
: &gt; enlarged from the Gospel of Mark. The Gospel of Mark knows nothing of
: &gt; the virgin birth, of the Sermon on the Mount, of the Lord's prayer,
: &gt; or of other important facts of the supposed life of Christ. These
: &gt; features were added by Matthew and Luke.
: &gt;
: &gt; But the Gospel of Mark, as we have it, is not the original Mark. In
: &gt; the same way that the writers of Matthew and Luke copied and enlarged
: &gt; the Gospel of Mark, Mark copied and enlarged an earlier document
: &gt; which is called the &quot;original Mark.&quot; This original source perished in
: &gt; the early age of the Church. What it was, who wrote it, where it was
: &gt; written, nobody knows. The Gospel of John is admitted by Christian
: &gt; scholars to be an unhistorical document. They acknowledge that it is
: &gt; not a life of Christ, but an interpretation of him; that it gives us
: &gt; an idealized and spiritualized picture of what Christ is supposed to
: &gt; have been, and that it is largely composed of the speculations of
: &gt; Greek philosophy. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, which are
: &gt; called the &quot;Synoptic Gospels,&quot; on the one hand, and the Gospel of
: &gt; John, on the other, stand at opposite extremes of thought. So
: &gt; complete is the difference between the teaching of the first three
: &gt; Gospels and that of the fourth, that every critic admits that if
: &gt; Jesus taught as the Synoptics relate, he could not possibly have
: &gt; taught as John declares. Indeed, in the first three Gospels and in
: &gt; the fourth, we meet with two entirely different Christs. Did I say
: &gt; two? It should be three; for, according to Mark, Christ was a man;
: &gt; according to Matthew and Luke, he was a demigod; while John insists
: &gt; that he was God himself.
: &gt;
: &gt; There is not the smallest fragment of trustworthy evidence to show
: &gt; that any of the Gospels were in existence, in their present form,
: &gt; earlier than a hundred years after the time at which Christ is
: &gt; supposed to have died. Christian scholars, having no reliable means
: &gt; by which to fix the date of their composition, assign them to as
: &gt; early an age as their calculations and their guesses will allow; but
: &gt; the dates thus arrived at are far removed from the age of Christ or
: &gt; his apostles. We are told that Mark was written some time after the
: &gt; year 70, Luke about 110, Matthew about 130, and John not earlier than
: &gt; 140 A.D. Let me impress upon you that these dates are conjectural,
: &gt; and that they are made as early as possible. The first historical
: &gt; mention of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, was made by the
: &gt; Christian Father, St. Irenaeus, about the year 190 A.D. The only
: &gt; earlier mention of any of the Gospels was made by Theopholis of
: &gt; Antioch, who mentioned the Gospel of John in 180 A.D.
: &gt;
: &gt; There is absolutely nothing to show that these Gospels -- the only
: &gt; sources of authority as to the existence of Christ -- were written
: &gt; until a hundred and fifty years after the events they pretend to
: &gt; describe. Walter R. Cassels, the learned author of &quot;Supernatural

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't distinguish between what I describe as one and you claim as the

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm afraid your response makes no sense. If you want to try to make a

&gt;&gt; You just gotta keep up. If I say it makes no difference, then that is
&gt;&gt; the single exception that disproves the rule...your rule being the
&gt;&gt; implication that without a foreskin you can not have a GREAT deal of
&gt;&gt; pleasure during sex.

&gt; Your reading comprehension is letting you down still: I said that a
&gt; foreskin gives a &quot;good deal of pleasure&quot; during sex. That isn't the
&gt; same as saying that sex with a foreskin is &quot;good&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, &quot;fantastic&quot;
&gt; or anything else. It means simply what it says. Obviously if your
&gt; parents have already had you mutilated at birth, and you have no
&gt; foreskin, then it can't provide ANY pleasure whatsoever, so the
&gt; pleasure you have during sex is DESPITE your physical handicap.

&gt; G;

"/> It's your comprehension that suffers, possibly due to the fact that you
have a foreskin. If I derive a great deal of pleasure during sex having
a foreskin downgrade my pleasure to just a good deal of pleasure is just
another good reason to be happy about its absence.

And I have never been mutilated.

&gt;&gt;&gt; this Gospel is shorter, simpler, and more natural, than any of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; other three. It is shown that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were
&gt;&gt;&gt; enlarged from the Gospel of Mark. The Gospel of Mark knows
&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the virgin birth, of the Sermon on the Mount, of the Lord's
&gt;&gt;&gt; prayer,
&gt;&gt;&gt; or of other important facts of the supposed life of Christ. These
&gt;&gt;&gt; features were added by Matthew and Luke.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But the Gospel of Mark, as we have it, is not the original Mark.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same way that the writers of Matthew and Luke copied and
&gt;&gt;&gt; enlarged
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Gospel of Mark, Mark copied and enlarged an earlier document
&gt;&gt;&gt; which is called the &quot;original Mark.&quot; This original source
&gt;&gt;&gt; perished in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the early age of the Church. What it was, who wrote it, where it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt; written, nobody knows. The Gospel of John is admitted by Christian
&gt;&gt;&gt; scholars to be an unhistorical document. They acknowledge that it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not a life of Christ, but an interpretation of him; that it gives
&gt;&gt;&gt; us
&gt;&gt;&gt; an idealized and spiritualized picture of what Christ is supposed
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been, and that it is largely composed of the speculations of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Greek philosophy. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, which are
&gt;&gt;&gt; called the &quot;Synoptic Gospels,&quot; on the one hand, and the Gospel of
&gt;&gt;&gt; John, on the other, stand at opposite extremes of thought. So
&gt;&gt;&gt; complete is the difference between the teaching of the first three
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gospels and that of the fourth, that every critic admits that if
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jesus taught as the Synoptics relate, he could not possibly have
&gt;&gt;&gt; taught as John declares. Indeed, in the first three Gospels and in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the fourth, we meet with two entirely different Christs. Did I say
&gt;&gt;&gt; two? It should be three; for, according to Mark, Christ was a man;
&gt;&gt;&gt; according to Matthew and Luke, he was a demigod; while John
&gt;&gt;&gt; insists
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he was God himself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is not the smallest fragment of trustworthy evidence to show
&gt;&gt;&gt; that any of the Gospels were in existence, in their present form,
&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier than a hundred years after the time at which Christ is
&gt;&gt;&gt; supposed to have died. Christian scholars, having no reliable
&gt;&gt;&gt; means
&gt;&gt;&gt; by which to fix the date of their composition, assign them to as
&gt;&gt;&gt; early an age as their calculations and their guesses will allow;
&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; the dates thus arrived at are far removed from the age of Christ
&gt;&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt; his apostles. We are told that Mark was written some time after
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; year 70, Luke about 110, Matthew about 130, and John not earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt; than 140 A.D. Let me impress upon you that these dates are
&gt;&gt;&gt; conjectural,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and that they are made as early as possible. The first historical
&gt;&gt;&gt; mention of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, was made by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Christian Father, St. Irenaeus, about the year 190 A.D. The only
&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier mention of any of the Gospels was made by Theopholis of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Antioch, who mentioned the Gospel of John in 180 A.D.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is absolutely nothing to show that these Gospels -- the only
&gt;&gt;&gt; sources of authority as to the existence of Christ -- were written
&gt;&gt;&gt; until a hundred and fifty years after the events they pretend to
&gt;&gt;&gt; describe. Walter R. Cassels, the learned author of &quot;Supernatural
&gt;&gt;&gt; Religion,&quot; one of the greatest works ever written on the origins
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Christianity, says: &quot;After having exhausted the literature and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; testimony bearing on the point, we have not found a single
&gt;&gt;&gt; distinct
&gt;&gt;&gt; trace of any of those Gospels during the first century and a half
&gt;&gt;&gt; after the death of Christ.&quot; How can Gospels which were not written
&gt;&gt;&gt; until a hundred and fifty years after Christ is supposed to have
&gt;&gt;&gt; died, and which do not rest on any trustworthy testimony, have the
&gt;&gt;&gt; slightest value as evidence that he really lived? History must be
&gt;&gt;&gt; founded upon genuine documents or on living proof. Were a man of
&gt;&gt;&gt; to-day to attempt to write the life of a supposed character of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; hundred and fifty years ago, without any historical documents upon
&gt;&gt;&gt; which to base his narrative, his work would not be a history, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be a romance. Not a single statement in it could be relied
&gt;&gt;&gt; upon.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Christ is supposed to have been a Jew, and his disciples are said
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been Jewish fishermen. His language, and the language of his
&gt;&gt;&gt; followers must, therefore, have been Aramaic -- the popular
&gt;&gt;&gt; language
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Palestine in that age. But the Gospels are

"/> Australians in Albania are advised to exercise caution and monitor developments
that might affect their safety. As you would in Australia, use common sense and
be alert to suspicious activities. Be aware of concern about the security
environment because of a risk of violent crime. You should be vigilant and watch
the media for information about possible new safety or security threats.
Australians should defer non-essential travel to the north east region bordering
the Serbia and Montenegro province of Kosovo (including the cities of Bajram
Curri and Tropoje).
Some Australian criminal laws, including - but not limited to - those relating
to money laundering and child sex tourism, have extraterritorial effect.
Australians who commit such offences outside of Australia may be prosecuted in
Australia for those offences.

Australian authorities are committed to combating sexual exploitation of
children by Australians overseas. Australians may be prosecuted at home under
Australian child sex tourism laws. These laws provide severe penalties of up to
17 years imprisonment for Australians who engage in sexual activity with
children under 16 while outside of Australia.

Aw, heck, I think this has more to do with it being in New York and him
being a man, than him being Jewish. I kid you not, when I lived on the
Bowery it wasn't all that rare to see guys in priests collars or guys in
full Ultra-Orthodox Jewish garb cutting deals with the skankiest hookers and
or male hustlers you've ever seen. Something about the city makes people
ignore things that anywhere else would raise an incredible ruckus, like
walking to work and seeing some pretty, but grubby and obviously mentally
ill girl taking a dump on the curb. To save my life I couldn't count the
times I've passed really repulsive scenes of people having sex in alleys,
doorways or even the park--forget the park when I was there. I've been away
from the city for a few years now and only go back on business and
everything is much different, but I think most of the disgusting junk is
still there but has retreated back into the shadows and the night somewhat.
As for the case below, I've heard a lot of very curious superstitions
associated with certain orthodox practices, one of my ex-wives families was
one generation away from Orthodox, her parents had left the tribe, I think
it's how she explained it, because her father wanted to go into a business
that wasn't proscribed or something, and her mother wanted to go into show
business--whatever, but I'd never heard of orally done circumcision though
it hardly seems much different from practices I've heard of were midwives
lick the placental blood off the woman's genitals after she delivers.
Humanity isn't really that far from the primitive as anyone near a bohemian
section filled with pierced and tattooed people will attest. And now there's
this strange case of the Mohawk haircut punk clique woman who scalped a
sixteen year old clique girl for doing something to &quot;defame women&quot; or some
such thing. Tribal behavior is all perfectly natural, if occasionally
brutal in the extreme. The veneer of civilization is very thin and with the
death of traditional roles for everyone, male, female, and whatnot, it is no
surprise that the natural human need for tribal identity which died in the
west when true patriotism died slowly following the French Revolution, and
it was clear when Garibaldi was the most famous man in the world with his
preaching of the philosophy of nationalism, that it was already a dead issue
in the west as and ongoing continuum if not a lost cause. Sorry to sound
nihilistic, but look at it this way, once people start talking about
something being wrong, it's already gone past the point where anything can
be done about it. It's like drugs, alcohol, sexual license or freedom if you
wish or any and all human behaviors, once it's identified as a problem it's
beyond the stage where it can be treated. Go back and read all the major
sociological treaties and they speak constantly of problems and propose
solutions, which never work and are about effective as trying to reroute an
erupting volcano. They tried that in Iceland, and it didn't work. Human
behavior only changes when there is a cultural paradigm shift, but human
nature is like an erupting volcano and about all you can do is get out of
the way, because it &quot;can't&quot; repeat &quot;can't&quot; be changed, only controlled.
Young punk clique women feel lost are seeking new identities, with all the
structures and rules entailed within the clique. It's a sense of belonging
and is little different from Crips and Bloods or Blackstone Rangers (aka El
Rukin's) or Sharks and Jets except that it's girls and they like their
Dionysian cult female ancestors are just finding the burning or of their
inner nature. Nature can be beautiful but it can be ugly as well. Society
makes these clownish attempts at being disapproving but the core western
culture is post-Judeo-Christian and has moved into total materialism of
which hedonism is a prime component. People on all sides of the religion
issue argue with me, but I say religion is only an artifact, a remnant of a
once existing order which is dissolving faster than an Alka-Seltzer in
Perrier. This is not to deny faith. I'm sure there are people of faith but
the religion of the west has nothing to do with Christianity, it's a sort of
feel-good estheticism, wherein all is ok as long as it's not unappealing to
our superficial esthetic sense, or out varying degrees of compassion which
are always variable intervals at best. If you don't agree try, going a whole
day without thinking something negative about someone else. Impossible,
human nature the overlord, the ruling demi-god of our minds. Whole movements
like PETA are based around things as superficial as pet animal fixations
which extend to unthinking beasts human characteristics. Or the worship of
nature within environmentalism, one of the biggest jokes of all considering
that humanity in a hundred years of producing energy doesn't have the
capacity to produce a tenth of the energy of an El Nino climate cycle and
all the nuclear and hydrogen weapons on earth can't match a single caldera
volcano let along a minor asteroid collision. Remember a few years ago all
the talk about the loss of ozone over the south pole? Ok, maybe human
industry is in there somewhere but there is for information's sake a volcano
in Antarctica which is spewing out chlorine gas at a rate unmatched by all
human production of that particular gas. And if anyone wants to no the
dangers of chlorine go down to Aiken South Carolina and check out the people
killed and effected by a couple freight train cars breaking open. That one
slipped past the news people really quickly didn't it? Last weeks headlines
there for a moment and gone. Just a few poor blacks and rednecks dead, but
hey they were red state people so what does it matter? Not stimulating
enough for our hyper-stimulated hedonistic culture's senses.
No, we'd rather hear about Scott Peterson smothering his wife or Jack
screwing some child, or some hottie 20something school teacher blowing some
sixth grader. Just human nature sex, pleasure and the gathering of material
things to satisfy the sub conscious need to insure future pleasure. What
about Love, you say? another lost cause and I saw that as confirmed
romantic. Lost, gone, can't compete in the marketplace of ninety seven
varieties of latte's and triple rows of chips and junk food at the local
superstore. It's about pleasure, satiation, an attempt to fill the emptiness
of modern souls. I think we all love celebrity for that reason, they are
beautiful and pampered and have options, and for them love is a trip down a
superstore isle of beautiful bodies and elegant garb and jewels. and
compliments, superficial to be sure, but satisfying to the lizard brain none
the less. So can you blame the kids for ganging up or cliquing together?
Perhaps that's what make this story about some diseased Mohel
contaminating innocent Jewish children's bodies with disease so fascinating,
The tribe is in large part supposed to protect them from the contamination
of the goyim world but in the ethos of a 17th century moral structure in
which having sex with a shiksa was not infidelity or seeing prostitutes not
a crime (as long as they were not Jewish--though on this point there is some
dispute among the Talmudic translations) and it's pretty well known by
historian that innocent or naive Jewish girls were lured into white slavery
in America from Poland and Russia by New York German Jewish businessmen
because in the Victorian era of double standards when women were seen as
dual Janus-like entities in confusing good girl-bad girl dichotomies, that
were always treated by criminal types as market items and thusly brothels
were stocked for female variety, a pale blue-eyed black-haired Colleen Irish
type, a smooth, glowing-skinned, wavy-haired octoroon, freckles a desirable
extra, preferably with hazel or blues eyes, large buxom bovine Nordic types,
fiery olive skinned Mediterranean girls, delicate Orientals, and for reasons
I haven't been able to uncover, red-haired green-eyed Jewish girls--straight
from Poland or the Russian Pale) This was a standard phenomenon. I've seen
antique handbills, which were really more like post cards done with woodcut
pictures, advertising high class brothels with descriptions written much
like the above. )
Back to the point: The amazing thing about the Orthodox (assuming that
this Rabbi is,) is that they have survived in western culture without being
totally destroyed, if not contaminated. A bit like the Hutterites out west,
or the Amish in the east though I can't imagine network TV doing a show
about tempting a bunch of orthodox kids with sex drugs and rock and roll.
And to be honest, I don't think leaving an Orthodox tribe is as easy as
living an Amish community where their Joseph Mennonism is sort of fatalistic
if not hard core predestination. I apologize for not knowing this because I
actually have some distant Hutterite relatives out west who spoke a kind of
18th century German, though they had almost nothing to do with us as we
were, what they called all outsiders, the &quot;English.&quot; Though the only odd
things I ever heard about them other than what most people know about Amish
and Old Order groups is stuff like shunning and silencing which is used as a
form of punishment far more effective than typical punishments for keeping
the community in line than say corporal punishment. I actually know of
several Hutterites who were murdered by &quot;English,&quot; over a cattle deal who
wouldn't even go to the police, their pacifisms and desire to remain away
from the contamination of the world was so great. Never works of course.
The lure of hedonism is too strong and human nature is weak. A while back
there were a bunch of Amish kids involved in crack dealing in Indiana. If
that's not a funny image I don't know what is. &quot;Yo, Yoder, you vants buy
sompin crack, dog?&quot;
But now that I think of it, this story might have an underlying thread
of adults and children. Remember ...

at least one good Albanian&quot;. There reputation in Europe is not good,
and for real reasons. Apparently around 50% of their economy is based
on crime related activities. It certainly gets pretty wild in the
north.

I have an Albanian friend here in Italy, and she has promisd to take
me and my wife there sometime, which would be good, as I did not have
a local guide last time. Had to rely on speaking english and broken
Italian.

Interesting Albania fact n. 423:
Did you notice that on the half-finished buildings there is usually a
childs toy displayed prominantly? This is to symbolise that the family
that is going to move in is having a child.

&gt;&gt; Someone else that has been to Albania! Why on earth did you go there?

&gt;Australians in Albania are advised to exercise caution and monitor developments
&gt;that might affect their safety. As you would in Australia, use common sense and
&gt;be alert to suspicious activities. Be aware of concern about the security
&gt;environment because of a risk of violent crime. You should be vigilant and watch
&gt;the media for information about possible new safety or security threats.
&gt;Australians should defer non-essential travel to the north east region bordering
&gt;the Serbia and Montenegro province of Kosovo (including the cities of Bajram
&gt;Curri and Tropoje).
&gt;Some Australian criminal laws, including - but not limited to - those relating
&gt;to money laundering and child sex tourism, have extraterritorial effect.
&gt;Australians who commit such offences outside of Australia may be prosecuted in
&gt;Australia for those offences.

&gt;Australian authorities are committed to combating sexual exploitation of
&gt;children by Australians overseas. Australians may be prosecuted at home under
&gt;Australian child sex tourism laws. These laws provide severe penalties of up to
&gt;17 years imprisonment for Australians who engage in sexual activity with
&gt;children under 16 while outside of Australia.

I was there in the Autumn of 1993. Most everything had been destroyed in the &quot;civil war&quot; as such. Not very bright to destroy your infrastructure in order to gain freedom.

Thus the high rate of crime. And of course everything was so cheap. But you never knew when you would have electricity and normally water would only run about 4am to 5am, so you had to fill buckets of water then in order to be able to &quot;flush&quot;.

Jesus was born Jewish therefore his foreskin was cut off and the Rabbi
sucked him off. Jesus also jerked off , defecated, and urinated, until he
went to hell with his god who banged mary and committed adultery.

Oh, and is there any chance you could change the Line Length on your
newsreader to 70 characters? It's set to about 700 at the moment!

I don't see how it could be set at 700, when it cannot go above 76... And it is set at 72.

To set the line length in outgoing newsgroup messages

Outlook Express automatically sets the line length of messages using plain text format at 76 characters per line. This accommodates news servers that do not display more than 80 characters per line. When messages are quoted in a reply, the original text is usually marked and indented with an additional character. If your message is likely to be quoted after posting, set your text to wrap at 70 or 72 characters per line to prevent text from running beyond the edge of the window.

1.. On the Tools menu, click Options.
2.. On the Send tab, in the News Sending Format section, select Plain Text, and then click the Plain Text Settings button.
3.. In the text box for Automatically wrap text at x characters when sending, type the number of characters you want displayed per line.
