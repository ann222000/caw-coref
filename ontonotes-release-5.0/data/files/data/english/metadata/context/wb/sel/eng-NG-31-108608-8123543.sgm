Well, it turns out that the journal submission/resubmission process is an
iterative one, and I was foolish to assume that an initial rejection was a
permanent one.  Now I know what I should have put into the the cover letter
that I ignored, because it looked like a formailty - the reason why my work
is important.

For my naivete, I got myself reamed out by some narcissistic guy calling
himself &quot;The Man.&quot;  The Vain Angry Man is more like it.  In here, we're all
physicists, and we're all The Men (not counting Androcles and the other
cranks).

That is something that belongs in an abstract. A referee won't care what's
in a cover letter. Its _his_  job to determine the importance of a article
for the particular goals of that journal. If you got rejected then did the
referees recommend a fix and resubmit? If not then I recommend that you send
it to another journal.

That's quite ingenious, although a teeny, tiny bit deceptive, since many
people will assume that the purpose of the match might be to make a
fire.  This technique is what magicians call &quot;misdirection.&quot;

I have a more direct one for you.  Assuming that the container is
circular and isn't tilted, what family of special functions describes
the shapes of those waves?

Hi, I'm the guy who &quot;reamed&quot; you out before.
If you are going to relate a story, please relate it accurately. To dp
other wise is know as &quot;lying&quot;.

The reason I &quot;reamed you out&quot; was that I gave you good advice in good
faith, and you gave me wise-ass answer. THEN I reamed you out.
Nevertheless, even the reaming contained useful advice.

I have published many papers, and I have reviewed papers for three
different journals. Note, that these were in chemistry, not in
physics.

If you wish to ask for useful advice from someone who isn't a crank,
who has actually published papers, who has reviewed one paper for the
best science journal that there is, and who is willing to actually
talk to you, I will be glad to give it to you.

If you want to trade insults, I can do that, too.

This is why I told you to follow **all** the instructions and take them
to heart.  The journal may or may not be taking you seriously.

One thing you'll find even after you've done all your homework is that a
lot of referees are really, really venal people.  I've been in plasma
physics, yes, in the mainstream, for 25 years and in my experience only
about 50 percent are willing to treat you like a colleague.  The rest
are going to use it, in a very optimised way, for their personal gain.
Always scheming.  The sort of people who will always stoop down and
reach under something to pick up a penny off the floor they saw but they
themselves didn't drop.

The more publication in the particular journal is used as a metric for
evaluating people, the worse it gets.  Some fields are worse than
others.  Your mileage will vary.  One of the most important reasons for
the problem is that referees are not compensated or rewarded in any way
for their work.  To be a referee is thankless work.  So the process
selects for the sort of people who take advantage of it.

University faculty and bean counter bureaucrats who use citation indices
as their main metric are *not* part of the solution.

You'll have no chance in that journal if you don't have a track record
or if you are not connected to an experiment as a coauthor on a paper
whose main result is experimental.  Or if you don't have a &quot;big shot&quot;
pushing you.

Of course, it is also possible that the work was no good.  But rejection
by PRL is not necessarily any sort of sign of the quality of the work.
(Disclaimer: I haven't seen the work in question...)

In my opinion, Letters journals, all of them, should be abolished.

Results should be judged as important according to what's in them, not
according to where they're published or who let you in.

I'm in a similar situation though will simply ignore insults.  More than
we three to ten people are reading this thread btw, so giving advice on
this is not wasted effort.

I'm merely curious as to which journal you think is the &quot;best science
journal that there is&quot;...

I've both published in and refereed for PRL, and have watched it turn
into the poser rag for the well connected that it has become (major
experimental results excepted), at least in my field.  For young people,
publishing there has become a career necessity, and the mere existence
of such a thing is a crime.

I don't submit there anymore, and perhaps for that reason never get
anything to referee from there (last time was early 90s).  My area is
plasma physics journals, but excepting Phys Lett A no letters journals.

I am trying to be circumspect. Two possible choices are &quot;Science&quot; and
&quot;Nature&quot;, though those two may not include the journal to which I am
referring. This is certainly not a knock on any other journal. You
will surely point out great work that has been puiblished in some
other journal, and you will be completely correct. &quot;Best&quot; is perhaps a
porrrly chosen word. Let me rephrase that to &quot;a very high profile
journal that you probably have heard of, and which is not a complete
rag.&quot; :-)

Science and Nature have very high visibility, something like the
Journal of the American Medical Association.

You were right, and as a beginner, I'm gonna make a few mistakes.  But
it quickly became clear that there's a bureaucracy at the journals that

This seems to be true of scientists in general, because these days,
we're apparently choosing our own referees.  I've been dressed down a
couple of times on these boards, for no good reason at all.  My work was
perfectly fine, and some meathead just had a bug in his bonnet.

It makes me think of Frasier Crane, the nurdy kid who got picked on so
badly when he was little, that he grew up with a complex, and now that
he's got power, he takes it out on others.  It's sad, but it's human
nature.

But I've gotta say that I appreciate your advice, because you're always
helpful.  And that's a good word - &quot;venal.&quot;  I think I'll use that one
from now on, instead of belligerent or anti-social.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've been in
&gt; plasma physics, yes, in the mainstream, for 25 years and in my
&gt; experience only about 50 percent are willing to treat you like a
&gt; colleague.  The rest are going to use it, in a very optimised way, for
&gt; their personal gain. Always scheming.  The sort of people who will
&gt; always stoop down and reach under something to pick up a penny off the
&gt; floor they saw but they themselves didn't drop.

&gt; The more publication in the particular journal is used as a metric for
&gt; evaluating people, the worse it gets.  Some fields are worse than
&gt; others.  Your mileage will vary.  One of the most important reasons
&gt; for the problem is that referees are not compensated or rewarded in
&gt; any way for their work.  To be a referee is thankless work.  So the
&gt; process selects for the sort of people who take advantage of it.
">

The one built in advantage I can see is the privilege of seeing new
papers before they're published.  If it gives you an idea, you can start
a new project, building on the new results, and get a few months head
start over the competition.

They never have the same ideas, anyhow.  I get my best ideas from the
popular science literature, not other papers.  I get the tools I need to
assemble my ideas from other papers.  However, I do occasionally get new
ideas from papers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; University faculty and bean counter bureaucrats who use citation

I like that.  You've obviously been around the block a few times.  Oh
well, once bitten twice shy, so I won't make that mistake again.  Now
that I think of it, I kind of like the idea of writing a cover letter
with a plain English summary of my idea, selling it to Joe Average.

I was always amazed that editors, who also have the PhD's, IIRC, could
be expert in so many different fields of physics at once.  Suddenly I
see - they aren't, and I can't expect them to decipher the technical
jargon.  They're the ones I need to be plain spoken with.  :)

&gt;&gt;I got rejected by the editor.

&gt; You'll have no chance in that journal if you don't have a track record
&gt; or if you are not connected to an experiment as a coauthor on a paper
&gt; whose main result is experimental.  Or if you don't have a &quot;big shot&quot;
&gt; pushing you.

&gt; Of course, it is also possible that the work was no good.  But
&gt; rejection by PRL is not necessarily any sort of sign of the quality of

&gt; In my opinion, Letters journals, all of them, should be abolished.

&gt; Results should be judged as important according to what's in them, not
&gt; according to where they're published or who let you in.

Well, I've got two other choices, Science and Astrophysical Letters, so
if PRL cans me a second time, I can try them.  I'm shy about APL,
because their letters are much longer than mine, which rather violates
your rule of reflecting the journal's custom.

I have seen theoretical papers in PRL, so there are exceptions to your
rule, but I have no idea how often they occur.  My impression is that
it's just a question of scmoozing the editor and convincing him that I'm
a decent guy and not a hack.

Nonetheless, we'll see how the iteration goes, and if it becomes
pointless, I'll know soon enough.  Fortunately at least, the critical
turnaround is quick, so the process can be repeated often enough to
(hopefully) yield results.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it turns out that the journal submission/resubmission
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; process is an iterative one, and I was foolish to assume that an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; initial rejection was a permanent one.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sorry but there is something I don't understand. Did you this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to a particular journal? Is so then may I ask what journal did
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you send it to?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Phys. Rev. Lett.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now I know what I should have put into the the cover letter
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that I ignored, because it looked like a formailty - the reason
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why my work is important.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That is something that belongs in an abstract. A referee won't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; care what's in a cover letter. Its _his_  job to determine the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If you got rejected then did the referees recommend a fix and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; resubmit? If not then I recommend that you send it to another

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I got rejected by the editor.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For my naivete, I got myself reamed out by some narcissistic guy

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Was he a referee? If so did he refered to himself as &quot;The Man&quot; in

&gt;&gt; &gt; Would you mind if I read it?

&gt; Hi, I'm the guy who &quot;reamed&quot; you out before.
&gt; If you are going to relate a story, please relate it accurately. To dp
&gt; other wise is know as &quot;lying&quot;.

&gt; The reason I &quot;reamed you out&quot; was that I gave you good advice in good
&gt; faith, and you gave me wise-ass answer. THEN I reamed you out.
&gt; Nevertheless, even the reaming contained useful advice.

&gt; I have published many papers, and I have reviewed papers for three
&gt; different journals. Note, that these were in chemistry, not in
&gt; physics.

&gt; If you wish to ask for useful advice from someone who isn't a crank,
&gt; who has actually published papers, who has reviewed one paper for the
&gt; best science journal that there is, and who is willing to actually
&gt; talk to you, I will be glad to give it to you.

A couple of things are not clear from John Schutkeker's posts that are
very important.

Does he have an academic affiliation? Right under your name on the
manuscript, you put &quot;Department of Physics, Harvard University,
Cambridge MA ...&quot; or &quot;Bioresearch Lab, Exxon Corp.&quot; I have never seen
a published manuscript without such an academic or industrial
affiliation. I don't even know whether a mansucript from such an
author would be reviewed.

Does John have a graduate education in a physical science?

Does John have experience in the preparation of manuscripts during his
academic career? Typically, one's graduate advisor teaches you lots of
the tips and tricks for good mansucript preparation.

When the rejection came, what did it say? Sometimes, the letter says
that the article is not appropriate for that journal, but specifically
names another jourmal that might be more appropriate. Journals can be
roughly ranked by prestige and by niche. There is so much demand for
papers to be published in Science or Nature that the paper, no matter
how good it is, will have no chance unless it is is considered ground-
breaking.

The answer is to submit it to a slightly less prestigious journal. It
is not much different than applying to colleges.

Othertimes, a paper is theory for a journal that is all experiments,
or a paper is all experiments sent to a theory journal.

If the editor's letter says that the article is not appropriate, but
doesn't suggest another journal, there may be more serious
difficulties with the paper.

If the reviewer says, &quot;Fix A, B, C, D, E, and F, you idiot.&quot;, the
usual reaction is to fixate on the &quot;You idiot&quot;. One should not do
that. The more specific the criticisms, the better it is for the
author. It means that all you have to do is fix the errors, and your
paper will get published.

The worst possible reviews are &quot;It has already been done&quot; or &quot;Too
speculative&quot;. In those cases, they aren't going to publish your paper,
pretty much no matter what you do (other than completely rewrite it)

The cover letter doesn't usually make or break a paper, but it helps
the editor steer the paper to the right reviewers.

Perhaps suckng up to the editor makes a difference, but that has never
been my experience.

For sure. Editors are busy, don't expect them to be clairvoyant. Be
explicit. Yes, typical grantology sucks, and if you can say why your work
is important, in simple, clear language, without resorting to the usual
grantological language, great!

Iirc, PRL has about a 40% acceptance rate. Elsewhere you mention Science.
If you can't get into PRL, Science is unlikely, since they have about a
90% rejection rate (ditto Nature). No problem, that's what the 2nd tier of
journals is for. Rejection from the big names doesn't mean
&quot;unpublishable&quot;, not even close.

&gt; &gt; Hi, I'm the guy who &quot;reamed&quot; you out before.
&gt; &gt; If you are going to relate a story, please relate it accurately. To dp
&gt; &gt; other wise is know as &quot;lying&quot;.

&gt; &gt; The reason I &quot;reamed you out&quot; was that I gave you good advice in good
&gt; &gt; faith, and you gave me wise-ass answer. THEN I reamed you out.
&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, even the reaming contained useful advice.

&gt; &gt; I have published many papers, and I have reviewed papers for three
&gt; &gt; different journals. Note, that these were in chemistry, not in
&gt; &gt; physics.

&gt; &gt; If you wish to ask for useful advice from someone who isn't a crank,
&gt; &gt; who has actually published papers, who has reviewed one paper for the
&gt; &gt; best science journal that there is, and who is willing to actually
&gt; &gt; talk to you, I will be glad to give it to you.

&gt; &gt; If you want to trade insults, I can do that, too.

&gt; I see that you're scared to use your real name on your posts.  What are
&gt; you afraid of, that makes you hide behind a veil of anonymity, in a
&gt; professional NG?- Hide quoted text -
">

I am afraid of being stalked by crazy people like Tom Potter,
Androcles, etc. Several threatened to harass other posters at their
place of work. I don't need that.

BTW, this is a hardly a &quot;professional&quot; newsgroup. Frankly, it is a
crank / troll newsgroup, where a feww scientists try vainly to explain
basic concepts to many people who can't or won't understand.

I'm glad you said that, because explaining complicated concepts simply
is one of my greatest talents.  I worshipped Azimov in high school and
devoured his science essays.

But are you saying that one of my plans for submitting grants is wrong,
which is to basically make it into a journal article, doing as much work
up front and putting in as much technical detail as I can?

Maybe I should include an appendix explaining the work in plain English?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Iirc, PRL has about a 40% acceptance rate. Elsewhere you mention
&gt; Science. If you can't get into PRL, Science is unlikely, since they
&gt; have about a 90% rejection rate (Nature). No problem, that's
&gt; what the 2nd tier of journals is for. Rejection from the big names
&gt; doesn't mean &quot;unpublishable&quot;, not even close.
">

The problem here is that I'm going for a letter, not an article, and
there are many fewer letters journals than regular ones.  If you happen
to know of someplace that would be interested in a Celestial Mechanics
article refining Bode's Law, I'd be thrilled, because so far Science,
Nature, PRL and Astrophysical Letters are all I can think of, and APL
typically publishes letters much longer than mine.

By a 40% acceptance rate, do you mean 40% per submission or 40% per
paper?  Since we get feedback every time we resubmit, I'd suppose that,
the more times you can revise and resubmit, the more multiples of 40%
you'd be able to stack up, and the function would asymptotically
approach 100%, as the number of (meaningful) resubmissions grew.

That would mean that the odds would exceed 50/50 on the second
resubmission, which is currently where I am now.  ?:)

I don't go into any length when it's not absolutely
needed (you mean spherical harmonics?). Even under
circumstances you described the simple (not the trivial

check your answer with the tivial (mass divided by

You're masturbating with physics and call the activity

Assume the simplest case, which is an incompressible fluid, meaning tha
there are no density fluctuations, only surface waves.  Likewise, assume
a non-dispersive medium, which means that all frequencies and wave
numbers have the same speed.

Hint:  It's like spherical harmonics, only for the next simpler
coordinate system.

You're right about that.  I couldn't solve the Rubik's cube without

More than twenty years have passed since those days, and I still don't
know the answer.  Occasionally I look at the problem, and I have finally
made up my mind to read the solution book.  Now I don't have time to put
the necessary effort into studying the geometry and practicing the
moves, because I've got more important mathematical puzzles to work on.

Sometimes, ya just can't win.  I should have read the answer book when I
had the chance.  &gt;:P~

Why a letter? Note well that papers in the letters journals are papers,

quite long papers in there (it's also not seen as a &quot;good&quot; journal like
PRL and the like, but I wouldn't call it a bad journal). The original idea
was short papers and rapid publication. I don't know if they're any faster
than the regular journals these days, for getting the paper into the
online version of the journal.

Many of the regular journals take letters - basically short, perhaps
lightweight, research articles. These don't always count as papers as far
as beancounters are concerned - it depends of the exact beancounting rules
in use.

If you want to publish to establish a proven track record so as to be more
likely to get grants, an article is better than a letter (except for a
letter in Nature), and an article in PRL would be excellent.

The difficulty with PRL is &quot;not of broad enough interest for PRL&quot;, which
means not getting into PRL.

I don't know the astro journals. Outside the astro journals, you could
consider the most relevant of Phys Rev X, or J Phys A, Phys Lett A, or the
most relevant of European Physical Journal X. If you feel rich, you could
even try New Journal of Physics (warning: open-access online journal, so
they charge the authors since they can't make money from subscriptions).

If your paper is correct, readable, new, and interesting, then you should
manage with the above. But there are many, many minor journals you can
resort to if needed.

That's 40% of papers submitted there get accepted. Usually that would be
with one revision following first referee reports. Often, they're sent to
the referees again. Sometimes a 2nd revision is needed. I think the
current rate might be a bit below 40%. Most physics journals have a higher
acceptance rate. The 10% acceptance rate of Nature and Science makes them
a lottery - quality is not enough, you need luck as well. The situation
looks quite grim in psychology, with many of the journals have acceptance
rates of 5-15%. Combine that with it not being unusual for psych papers to
spend 6 months in review, and one can appreciate the awesome speed of
publication in physics (mind you, we had an interesting experience with a
paper that spent 18 months or so in the review cycle - not with the
reviewers either).

By &quot;letter,&quot; of course, I actually just mean &quot;really short paper,&quot; and
not a &quot;dear sir&quot; composition.

The reason I can't publish this particular work as a full paper is that
there simply isn't enough material.  It's just a couple of short, brief
insights, with no room to continue with the work, to flesh it out.  Lord
knows I've tried, but since it's mathematics and solving differential
equations, they can either be solved or not, and since I can't solve
them, that's as far as I can take the work.

But I reduced two important equations by a couple of steps, and derived
another brand new one, with an elegant trick, which seems worth
broadcasting to the community at large.  You wouldn't happen to know of
a mathematical letters journal that deals with either chaos or number
series, would you?

Same here. And believe me, there aren't many people in
the world who read them closely enough. Things in
physics are done well ahead of textbook stuff,
therefore each paper is built, by definition, on some
of the stuff from past that aren't available in
textbooks or covered in university courses. That's the
time consuming part. You must forge through them,
understanding every bit of information presented,
before reaching what's done in that paper itself. This
last part, the work in paper itself, is usually the
easiest to understand because such steps forward are
almost always made in very small steps. There isn't
much in there, and the writer is the best person in the
world to describe the work to the reader because he's
the one who did it.

So physics is certainly different from bio or med
fields where even textbook information almost covers
every essential material one needs to know to be able
to read papers in such fields. Two years ago I did not
understand one line in all the bio related papers or
texts or handbooks. They always had words in them that
were Chinese to me. A year ago I started to understand
the biotech papers of 1960's :-))) The courses I took
covered all such techniques and material. Later I got
better and better. Also I began to understand (for the
first time in my life) what Merck Manual has been
blabbering all these years when, each time that I had
to dig in to find out some answer to medical questions
I had, I had to go through a lot of jargon taking up
most of my time before understanding what the book
said. Now I read that wonderful source of quick
information (it is not the best but still is one of the
top two or three) and surprize myself that hardly ever
the book throws a jargon at me that I don't know
exactly what it means :-)) This was all done via a few
bio/med courses. Very much worth spending the time
learning them.

Anyway, in physics this is impossible to do. You cannot
read papers by taking a few courses, not even after
taking a hundred courses. The material you'd need as
_background_ are simply not there. What they teach in
universities are vast but they're only making it
possible for you to begin another long road to
understanding physics papers.

For this same last reason, sometimes papers are used,
and trusted, in developing further work upon them only
basing the decision on the trust of somebody else on
correctness of that paper. This can be a near-fatal
mistake, a career buster, or at least a very very
expensive mistake. In mid 1980s I once corrected a
paper from the best European journal that there is in
that field, which had been used by one of the space
science communities in USA for more than ten years!
Thus I found out that I was the only one who had read
it carefully. Not even the author of it knew about it,
or so I assumed. Tons and tons of computing work had
been based on its results, they all went to trash. As a
matter of fact the punch-cards of those programs filled
a small room that was locked and every now and then
somebody would get the key to use some of those
programs again. The author took the trouble of coming
from Europe to visit me in my measly meagre office room
that I had in the school where I was a grad student, to
defend himself (actually to save his well-established
fully paid and ongoing Summer trips to USA and to that
center every year for work and pleasure both). And
after shouting at me a few times trying to make things
&quot;understood&quot; to me, quieted down when I showed him
where his mistake was, because he couldn't deny it. The
way he defended it also showed he was actually aware of
it. Perhaps the head of the center had already told him
what it was, or he might've stumbled on it and known it
for years, I don't know. I remember very well what I
told him at the end before he left my &quot;office&quot;.

&quot;You or I may care less for the
Americans but when I'm doing physics for
them I'm first doing physics and only
then doing it for the Americans, and a
mistake like that cannot ever occur or
stay unnoticed as long as I am at it.&quot;

Sure enough I didn't see him the following three
Summers. Adios Muchachos till next weekend.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But are you saying that one of my plans for submitting grants is
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong, which is to basically make it into a journal article, doing as
&gt;&gt;&gt; much work up front and putting in as much technical detail as I can?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I should include an appendix explaining the work in plain
&gt;&gt;&gt; English?

&gt;&gt; I don't know the content you have in mind, so I can't give specific
&gt;&gt; advice. More generally, even if the content is highly technical, the
&gt;&gt; abstract, at the very least, should be readable by all. Ideally, the
&gt;&gt; introduction and conclusion should be easy to read as well.

&gt; Thanks.  I never know what to put into the introduction or the
&gt; conclusion, so a plain English explanation of why the work is important
&gt; sounds like great idea.  I'm really grateful for the useful suggestion.

&gt;&gt; I occasionally find papers that are totally unreadable, essentially
&gt;&gt; collections of cryptic jargon. Even the titles can be
&gt;&gt; incomprehensible. What is the point of a title and abstract when I get
&gt;&gt; no idea about the content from them?

&gt; I have never seen anything except unreadable papers, and often when
&gt; they're in the exact same field I'm working in.  Of course, if I want to
&gt; learn what they're saying, I have to study them *very* closely, and then
&gt; usually the material eventually clarifies, after days or even weeks of
&gt; close examination.

There are levels of readability. A truly unreadable paper is one where you
don't know what it's about. Usually, it's enough to understand the basic
idea of the paper - and this is where plain-English intro/conclusion are
good - and then you can either dive into it for the detail if you need it
now, or return to the paper to do so later if you need to do so later.
There are two many papers to spend days or weeks on unless they really
matter.

An adequate paper should convey the basic message in well under an hour.
Sure, the details might take days, but that's another story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iirc, PRL has about a 40% acceptance rate. Elsewhere you mention
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Science. If you can't get into PRL, Science is unlikely, since they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have about a 90% rejection rate (Nature). No problem, that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what the 2nd tier of journals is for. Rejection from the big names
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't mean &quot;unpublishable&quot;, not even close.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem here is that I'm going for a letter, not an article, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; there are many fewer letters journals than regular ones.  If you
&gt;&gt;&gt; happen to know of someplace that would be interested in a Celestial
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mechanics article refining Bode's Law, I'd be thrilled, because so
&gt;&gt;&gt; far Science, Nature, PRL and Astrophysical Letters are all I can
&gt;&gt;&gt; think of, and APL typically publishes letters much longer than mine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; By a 40% acceptance rate, do you mean 40% per submission or 40% per
&gt;&gt;&gt; paper?  Since we get feedback every time we resubmit, I'd suppose
&gt;&gt;&gt; that, the more times you can revise and resubmit, the more multiples
&gt;&gt;&gt; of 40% you'd be able to stack up, and the function would
&gt;&gt;&gt; asymptotically approach 100%, as the number of (meaningful)
&gt;&gt;&gt; resubmissions grew.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That would mean that the odds would exceed 50/50 on the second
&gt;&gt;&gt; resubmission, which is currently where I am now.  ?:)

&gt;&gt; Why a letter? Note well that papers in the letters journals are
&gt;&gt; papers, not letters. They usually have a length limit (4 pages PRL, 3
&gt;&gt; pages for APL and Optics Letters). Phys Lett A might not have a limit,
&gt;&gt; I'm seen some quite long papers in there (it's also not seen as a
&gt;&gt; &quot;good&quot; journal like PRL and the like, but I wouldn't call it a bad
&gt;&gt; journal). The original idea was short papers and rapid publication. I
&gt;&gt; don't know if they're any faster than the regular journals these days,
&gt;&gt; for getting the paper into the online version of the journal.

&gt;&gt; Many of the regular journals take letters - basically short, perhaps
&gt;&gt; lightweight, research articles. These don't always count as papers as
&gt;&gt; far as beancounters are concerned - it depends of the exact
&gt;&gt; beancounting rules in use.

&gt;&gt; If you want to publish to establish a proven track record so as to be
&gt;&gt; more likely to get grants, an article is better than a letter (except
&gt;&gt; for a letter in Nature), and an article in PRL would be excellent.

&gt; By &quot;letter,&quot; of course, I actually just mean &quot;really short paper,&quot; and
&gt; not a &quot;dear sir&quot; composition.

&gt; The reason I can't publish this particular work as a full paper is that
&gt; there simply isn't enough material.  It's just a couple of short, brief
&gt; insights, with no room to continue with the work, to flesh it out.  Lord
&gt; knows I've tried, but since it's mathematics and solving differential
&gt; equations, they can either be solved or not, and since I can't solve
&gt; them, that's as far as I can take the work.

&gt; But I reduced two important equations by a couple of steps, and derived
&gt; another brand new one, with an elegant trick, which seems worth
&gt; broadcasting to the community at large.  You wouldn't happen to know of
&gt; a mathematical letters journal that deals with either chaos or number
&gt; series, would you?
">

Not off-hand. The maths literature is also usually quite different in
style from physics. It might be worth browsing through a couple of issues
of likely journals to see what would suit your writing, style-wise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's what I'd do if I had a full paper and couldn't get it into a
&gt; major journal.  Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of letters journals,
&gt; and Applied Physics Letters (the other APL) only likes experimental
&gt; material science, which takes them off the list.

There's also EPL (used to be Europhysics Letters, but the actual name
seems to have mutated to EPL recently).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Most physics journals
&gt;&gt; have a higher acceptance rate. The 10% acceptance rate of Nature and
&gt;&gt; Science makes them a lottery - quality is not enough, you need luck as
&gt;&gt; well.

&gt; I don't know what constitutes &quot;luck&quot; in this context, the mood of the
&gt; editor or reviewer on the day a paper arrives?  I hear that what you
&gt; really need to get in is connections, but I'm always skeptical about
&gt; rumors like that.  I may be naive, but I prefer to believe that science
&gt; is a true meritocracy, and that the good work will stand on it's own
&gt; value.  Soon, I suppose that I'll find out whether I was right or wrong.
">

The editors bin about 2/3 of the submissions. The referees filter out
another 2/3 of what is left. But they're general science journals (which
really means they're mostly biology journals), so demand that papers be
interesting to the general audience. Specialisation, unless it's
specialisation in something the editor likes, means rejection. If you're a
big shot, then you're more likely to get past the editors. Also the
referees. But one is a big shot due to past quality work, not connections.
Lack of a university position makes it harder to get past editors (in
general, not just Nature/Science) - perhaps some of this is due to past
experience with crank papers.

But given that even bad or mediocre work gets published, good work manages
to get there too, if competently written.

&gt;&gt; The situation looks quite grim in psychology, with many of the

&gt;&gt; can appreciate the awesome speed of publication in physics (mind you,

&gt; Six months in review is the least of my worries, and in fact I'd

I suspect it was a student the supervisor passed the paper onto, without
any explanation or training in what referees are meant to do. That's
common enough. I'm happily prepared to put it down to ignorance rather
than evil, given how common ignorance is.

I'm also happily prepared to never send another submission to that same
journal, given that their editor is apparently incompetent. Making my
boycott list 3 journals long, of which two are submission issues, and the
third was a plagiarism issue.

All very true.  Journals are perticularly hard on someone without an
affiliation.  If no affiliation, _and_ no track record, _and_ trying to
publish in a place like PRL (or other &quot;high-impact&quot;) journal, then the
bar does tend to get set rather high.

The only well known exception in my part of physics was Robert Kraichnan.
I'm not sure where Julian Barbour submits his papers from, or where to,
as I've only heard of them peripherally.

This may or may not matter...  if you can make it obvious you know the
subject _and_ the literature, and you show respect, you ought to be able
to circumvent this (assuming an _exceptional_ case of an autodidact).

Yes, and here it depends upon, by whom.  It is sad but true, you do have
to be well connected, especially if it is a theory paper.  Lots of
rubbish gets out, even in these &quot;highly respected&quot; journals, by well
connected people &quot;explaining&quot; some result which is already known.  The
way you can tell such a crap paper is the absence of control tests.

I wouldn't have thought to either, but the best benefit for me from this

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I don't think the reviewers spend that much time on it, except

&gt;&gt; That's fer sure, because reading papers is so hard, and the reviewer

I would expect a certain amount of necessity to check the results of any
paper one draws upon as a starting point.  I've found published
mistakes, and so have my friends.  Penny Smith, just withdrew a solution
to millennium Navier Stokes problem, because she used an incorrect
equation from an Einstein paper.

But nonetheless, I agree with you, and deliberately letting known
mistakes go to press is not only unethical, but a great way to damage
one's own reputation among your peers.  You don't want to make enemies
of those people, but friends.

&gt;&gt;&gt; try to get the full expanded version of
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.aare.edu.au/02pap/cho02101.htm
&gt;&gt;&gt; accepted as a journal paper.  The problem is that it's a methodology
&gt;&gt;&gt; paper, but isn't a statistic paper (the psych methodology journals
&gt;&gt;&gt; are basically statistics journals in disguise). Acceptance notice
&gt;&gt;&gt; came last week. 20 months since original first submission. One
&gt;&gt;&gt; review from an earlier submission was the most incompetent review I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have ever seen - a critique of grammar and style, including a
&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstration of the reviewer's lack of literacy, and _no_ comment

&gt;&gt;&gt; little respect for the reputation of the journal that they forwarded
&gt;&gt;&gt; such a review to an author.

Theft is much worse than carelessness or haste.  The former is, in fact
evil, and is generally punishable by the courts, although I don't know
about what happens in research.  The latter can be chalked up to the
faults and imperfections of human nature, if you like to be forgiving.

Well, there are lots of minor journals. You could try sending it as a very
short paper. Nothing wrong with short papers! Choose one that will allow
you to post it on arxiv. Ideally, choose one that is open access, at least
partially (some are, like Turkish Journal of Physics, Chinese Journal of
Physics (a Taiwanese journal), acta physica slovakia, Acta Physica
Polonica B, etc.).

Compare your content with their typical, or their lightweight, paper to
see if you have a decent chance.
