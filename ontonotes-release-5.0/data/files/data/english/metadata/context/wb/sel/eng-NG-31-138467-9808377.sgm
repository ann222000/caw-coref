*Dear Friends*

Pls go through the below and the attachment. I hope it will help you.

*CANCEROUS FOODS / PRODUCTS *

*INSTANT NOODLES*
Instant noodle lovers, Make sure you break for at least 3 days after one
session of instant noodles before you eat your next packet! Please read the
info shared to me by a doctor. My family stopped eating instant noodles more
than 5 years ago after hearing about the wax coating the noodles – the wax
is not just in the Styrofoam containers but it coats the noodles. This is
why the instant noodles do not stick to each other when cooking.

If one were to examine the ordinary Chinese yellow noodles in the market,
one will notice that, in their uncooked state the noodles are oily. This
layer of oil prevents the noodles from sticking together. Wanton noodles in
their uncooked state have been dusted with flour to prevent them sticking
together. When the hawker cooks the noodles, notice he cooks them in hot
water and then rinses them in cold water before cooking them in hot water
again. This process is repeated several times before the noodles are ready
to be served. The cooking and rinsing process prevents noodles from sticking
together. The hawker then &quot;lowers the noodles in oil and sauce to prevent  the
noodles from sticking if they are to be served dry. Cooking instructions for
spaghetti require oil or butter to be added in the water when boiling the
spaghetti to prevent the pasta from sticking together. Otherwise, one gets a
big clump of spaghetti!

There was an SBC (now TCS) actor some years ago, who at a busy time of his
career had no time to cook, resorted to eating instant noodles everyday. He
got cancer later on. His doctor told him about the wax in instant noodles.
The doctor told him that our body will need up to 2 days to clear the wax.
There was also an SIA steward who after moving out from his mother's house
into his own house, did not cook but ate instant noodles almost every meal.
He had cancer, and has since died from it.

Nowadays the instant noodles are referred as &quot;cancer noodles&quot;.

*SATAY LOVERS (BARBECUE*)

If you all eat Satay, don't ever forget to eat the cucumber, because eating
Satay together with carbon after barbequing can cause cancer. But we have a
cure for that... Cucumber should be eaten after we eat the Satay because
Satay has carcinogen (a cancer causing element) but cucumber is
anti-carcinogenic. So don't forget to eat the cucumber the next time you
have Satay's.

*PRAWNS (SUGPO) &amp; VIT C*

DO NOT eat shrimp / prawn if you have just taken VITAMIN C pills!!  This
will cause you to DIE in ARSENIC (As) toxication within  HOURS!!

*PORK AWARENESS*

Try this and see whether the pork you bought has worms. There goes with your
&quot;Bak Kut Teh&quot; for those who love it. Most men love to eat this so watch out
before it's too late. If you pours Coke (yes, the soda) on a slab of pork,
wait a little while, you will SEE WORMS crawl out of it. A message from the
Health Corporation of Singapore about the bad effects of pork consumption.
Pig's bodies contain MANY TOXINS, WORM and LATENT DISEASES.

Although some of these infestations are harboured in other animals, modern
veterinarians say that pigs are far MORE PREDISPOSED to these illnesses than
other animals. This could be because PIGS like to SCAVENGE and will eat ANY
kind of food, INCLUDING dead insects, worms, rotting carcasses, excreta
including their own, garbage, and other pigs.  INFLUENZA (flu) is one of the
MOST famous illnesses which pigs share with humans. This illness is
harboured in the LUNGS of pigs during the summer months and tends to affect
pigs and human in the cooler months. Sausage contains bits of pigs' lungs,
so those who EAT pork sausage tend to SUFFER MORE during EPIDEMICS of
INFLUENZA. Pig meat contains EXCESSIVE quantities of HISTAMINE and IMIDAZOLE
compounds, which can lead to ITCHING and INFLAMMATION; GROWTH HORMONE
which PROMOTES
INFLAMMATION and growth; sulphur containing mesenchymal mucus which leads to
SWELLING and deposits of MUCUS in tendons and cartilage, resulting in
ATHRITIS, RHEUMATISM, etc. Sulphur helps cause FIRM human tendons and
ligaments to be replaced by the pig's soft mesenchymal tissues, and
degeneration of human cartilage.

Eating pork can also lead to GALLSTONES and OBESITY, probably due to its
HIGH CHOLESTEROL and SATURATED FAT content. The pig is the MAIN CARRIER of
the TAENIE SOLIUM WORM, which is found in its flesh. These tapeworms are
found in human intestines with greater frequency in  nations where pigs are
eaten. This type of tapeworm can pass through the intestines and affect many
other organs, and is incurable once it reaches beyond a certain stage. One
in six people in the US and Canada has RICHINOSIS from eating trichina
worms, which are found in pork. Many people have NO SYMPTOMS to warm them of
this, and when they do, they resemble symptoms of many other illnesses.
These worms are NOT noticed during meat inspections.

*SHAMPOO*
Cancer-causing substance in shampoos. Go home and check your shampoo. Change
before it's too late... Check the ingredients listed on  your shampoo
bottle, and see they have a substance by the name of Sodium Laureth Sulfate,
or simply SLS. This substance is found in most shampoos; manufacturers use
it because it produces a lot of foam and it  is cheap. BUT the fact is, SLS
is used to scrub garage floors, and it is very strong!!! It is also proven
that it can cause cancer in the long  run, and this is no joke. Shampoos
that contains SLS: Vo5, Palmolive, Paul Mitchell, L'Oreal, the new Hemp
Shampoo from Body Shop etc. contain this substance.

The first ingredient listed (which means it is the single most prevalent
ingredient) in Clairol's Herbal Essences is Sodium Laureth Sulfate.
Therefore, I called one company, and I told them their product contains a
substance that will cause people to have cancer. They said, Yeah we knew
about it but there is nothing we can do about it because we need that
substance to produce foam. By the way Colgate toothpaste also contains the
same substance to produce the &quot;bubbles&quot;. They said they are going to send me
some information. Research has shown that in the 1980s, the chance of
getting  cancer is 1 out of 8000 and now, in the 1990s, the chances of
getting cancer is 1 out of 3, which is very serious. Therefore, I hope that
you will take this seriously and pass this on to all the people you know, and
hopefully, we can stop &quot;giving&quot; ourselves cancer-causing agents.

*Please, pass on this information, it will benefit others, specially your loved
ones.
