Well, what's the asteroid's name ?
Are you talking about your natal Sun ?
And if your solar return MC is conjunct your natal Sun, this could mean a
very special year, IMHO.

Asteroids name is Daniel. Is that very important?
Yes natal sun but that's the very same sun as the solar return sun. The whole point is
that it's the horoscope for the same placement of the sun as your natal and a frozen chart
made out of that.

Yes I am supposed (eh) to finish my master paper this year.

Probably not - whether the war in Iraq will be stopped or won't is more
important - but it's just a piece of information. As you are talking about
some asteroid's name, there is no point in hiding it.

Not a very original name for an asteroid, BTW. I know there are far more
interesting ones.

Do all people have their solar MCs conjunct their Suns the year they are
finishing their master papers ? I guess not.

It should be something else, unless the finishing of your master paper will
have some particularly important effect on your life.

People who do asteroids really like this kind of thing. You might try
tracking transits against it to see how the relationship develops, or

That doesn't necessarily mean fling.    It can mean that your
boyfriend is the main focus for you this year. That's not necessarily
a bad thing.

When a heavenly body aspects the Sun, that's a main focus for the
year.   For instance,  Sun-Venus-Mars in 8th is in my current solar
return (October 28, 2006). That means that
deep,intimate,transformational romantic,love relationship is the main
focus. They are sextile asteroid that's close to my girlfriend's name
and quincunx an asteroid that's close to my girlfriend's name.  I did
meet my girlfriend in person June this year and there was a lot of
intensity and passion during my visit with her.  She even sent me a
birthday card predicting that she will fall in love with me on the day
of my solar return.  A month later after my solar return, she told me
that she loves me.

Solar Returns do work!

but yeah...just because a name of a significant other is aspecting
your Sun doesn't mean a year fling.....it means main focus for the
year.

So don't worry.  Don't turn your main focus into worrying. That would
really hurt your relationship.  Focus on the positive.  I tell my
girlfriend that too.

Depends... IIRC, Volguine remarks on it in his book and says some years the
solar chart shows splendidly the events of the year to come, while at other
times there doesn't seem to be a connection.

This is strictly speaking not related to solar charts, but I remember having
done Adolf Hitler's chart, I wasn't able to find anything in it which you
could relate to his actual life. And yet God knows how many remarkable (good
or bad), unique and history-making events there were in his life. Maybe I
had the wrong birth data, but I don't think so. Did anyone else do H.'s

Hello there:
I am really glad you have also discovered this and that you mentioned it
here, as it proves (to me at least) that the all too common evaluation of
his &quot;true character&quot; was from international politics dictated and has been,
for the known purposes mis-interpreted by the History writers as well as
by astrologers.
I personally believe it to be unethical for astrologers to write about a
known person with the adjectives, be it &quot;criminal&quot;, &quot;thief&quot;, &quot;bad actor&quot;,
or what have you (all the things the media had been told to publish),
instead of the astrological fact-findings.
Judgement is not condusive to our real findings.

When I, many years ago, came across this chart (it even had the time),
I evaluated every single part, I also could not find THE man, as we
know him from historical stories.
My idea was to use this example in a class. Not mentioning the person,
but let a class evaluate each part separately, like one does in every
astrological class, not giving the date and thus not the Pluto position
until the very last.

PLEASE -  I am NOT claiming, nor suggesting that the man was a &quot;saint&quot;,
however he was also &quot;used&quot; to fulfill the goal of much greater politics -
the money - -  which we can also observe with other leaders.

My father used to say it was not A. Hitler, it was &quot;the Hitlers&quot; (behind
the scene) who were able to manipulate and influence (to a certain extent)
the person who then had to be used as the proverbial &quot;Fall-Guy&quot;.

We all know that the people who can be used as fall-guys cannot be too
smart, but may not be stupid either (trainable to a certain extent).
Good PR brings them to the top, much too high for them to handle in
the long run. The result is, that thees leaders eventually bring themselves
down, by that time the true powers behind them (the money) have
accomplished what they needed to accomplish - and since when do they
(being in a safe port themselves) care how many get hurt in the process ??

BTW: the above mentioned evaluation of A. Hitler and our not finding
the &quot;proof of his true character&quot; in his chart is still being used to
discredit
Astrology,  and that not only by &quot;Trolls&quot;, but it is manipulated because
some entities are still needing the fall-guy(s) for things which had long
before been planned by outsiders and the results (profits) are still being
&quot;enjoyed&quot; - by those who still want people to believe that &quot;they&quot; were/are
the &quot;good guys&quot;, at the worst &quot;they were only following orders&quot;.

All in all, we should not allow it to discredit Astrology, we could be a
part
of disclosing the facts - carefully. - -

So much on this.
Take care and
be well,
I.R.Heller

I guess it really depends on what you look at in solar returns and how
you approach doing them.   I have 2 Solar Return books  by 2 different
authors.  One uses solar return chart and reads it like a temporary
natal chart. She uses that chart alone to get insights.   The other
astrology doesn't take the whole solar return chart in consideration.
He looks at house rulers and its aspects in solar return. He looks at
angular aspects to solar return chart  AND natal chart midheaven/IC
axis and ascendant/descendant.

They do their solar return charts differently.

Some astrologers use midpoints in solar returns.  A matter of fact, I
had a solar return report program that interprets midpoint
configurations in solar return. They were seen as important.
Minor planets in solar return could be good for insights...especially
the major asteroids......now we have Eris which is larger than fellow
kuiper belt object/dwarf planet, Pluto.   Also the planetary nodes can
be used in solar return too.

I pay attention to house rulerships in solar return too.....it's one
of the reasons that helped me accurately suspect that I was going to
receive money during my solar return year in 2002 - 2003.  I had saw
8th house ruler 8th house Venus conjunct Sun in 8th in my October 2002
Solar return. I ended up getting over 20,000 dollars in mental health
disability backpay.

so the thing is that an astrologer just have to find a solar return
method that works.

also....Free will is the ultimate factor.  I don't believe in making
predictions in Astrology. The individual makes choices and perform
actions that determine what events happen.

His manifesto, Mein Kampf, and his actions as Chancellor and Fuhrer of
Germany are sufficient evidence of his true character. History writers have

I don't care WHAT your father said, and I don't care what some astrology
class did or didn't see in a chart. Hitler was no &quot;fall guy.&quot; He was
directly desirous of and responsible for the consequences of what he did.
Yes, there were those who were of the same mind and colluded with him, but
that in NO way absolves him of responsibility for what he did.

&gt;&gt; astrological class, not giving the date and thus not the Pluto position
&gt;&gt; until the very last.

&gt;&gt; PLEASE -  I am NOT claiming, nor suggesting that the man was a &quot;saint&quot;,
&gt;&gt; however he was also &quot;used&quot; to fulfill the goal of much greater politics -
&gt;&gt; the money - -  which we can also observe with other leaders.

&gt;&gt; My father used to say it was not A. Hitler, it was &quot;the Hitlers&quot; (behind
&gt;&gt; the scene) who were able to manipulate and influence (to a certain
&gt;&gt; extent)
&gt;&gt; the person who then had to be used as the proverbial &quot;Fall-Guy&quot;.

&gt; I don't care WHAT your father said, and I don't care what some astrology
&gt; class did or didn't see in a chart. Hitler was no &quot;fall guy.&quot; He was
&gt; directly desirous of and responsible for the consequences of what he did.
&gt; Yes, there were those who were of the same mind and colluded with him, but
&gt; that in NO way absolves him of responsibility for what he did.

&gt;&gt; We all know that the people who can be used as fall-guys cannot be too
&gt;&gt; smart, but may not be stupid either (trainable to a certain extent).
&gt;&gt; Good PR brings them to the top, much too high for them to handle in
&gt;&gt; the long run. The result is, that thees leaders eventually bring
&gt;&gt; themselves
&gt;&gt; down, by that time the true powers behind them (the money) have
&gt;&gt; accomplished what they needed to accomplish - and since when do they
&gt;&gt; (being in a safe port themselves) care how many get hurt in the process
&gt;&gt; ??

&gt;&gt; BTW: the above mentioned evaluation of A. Hitler and our not finding
&gt;&gt; the &quot;proof of his true character&quot; in his chart is still being used to
&gt;&gt; discredit
&gt;&gt; Astrology,  and that not only by &quot;Trolls&quot;, but it is manipulated because
&gt;&gt; some entities are still needing the fall-guy(s) for things which had long
&gt;&gt; before been planned by outsiders and the results (profits) are still
&gt;&gt; being
&gt;&gt; &quot;enjoyed&quot; - by those who still want people to believe that &quot;they&quot;
&gt;&gt; were/are
&gt;&gt; the &quot;good guys&quot;, at the worst &quot;they were only following orders&quot;.

&gt;&gt; All in all, we should not allow it to discredit Astrology, we could be a
&gt;&gt; part
&gt;&gt; of disclosing the facts - carefully.

&gt; I think you should be a little more careful with the facts, Heller. I like
&gt; you, but your comments above are offensive to me.
">

Taking offense won't help encourage discussion, and without discussion
there's little hope for understanding. I'm certainly not defending Hitler,
nor as I read it is Ilmi. But I do think she has a point about the people
behind Hitler. It's all very comforting to lay all blame on the 'evil
monster' and thereby avoid his humanity - and the darkness therein, which is
not absent in any of us. Hitler as scapegoat makes us all feel righteous in
comparison, but the world is hardly saintly since his demise. Perhaps
because what we loathe in him in fact lives in all of us.

To Ilmi's point about his chart: I've looked at it too, off and on many
times through the decades, and for the life of me I can't see the
monstrosity in it. In the 18:30 LMT chart (Braunau, Austria on APR 20,
1889), for example, I really don't see anything extraordinary. (I recall
seeing another data set recently - anyone have it?) And that too me is the
really sobering thing: this guy was clearly rabid in many ways, but how
could a total lunatic monster have been able to get himself elected in what
was then arguably the world's most cultured nation? To me, the only answer
is that he wasn't that different from the ordinary citizen, who even in the
most cultured nation on this planet happens to harbor a considerable dark
side.

I'm not pointing a finger here, except at us humans. As Walt Kelly's Pogo
put it, &quot;We have met the enemy, and he is us.&quot;

Years ago, there was an entire NCGR Journal covering Hitler's
chart.  Robert Hand delineated it using Classical techniques,
Arlene Nimark did it using Uranian astrology, etc.  They all did
fine jobs of describing Hitler's character, astrologically, and
I'm sure that if one were to look at Hitler's transits and
progressions and arcs, etc, for the dates of his major life
events, there would be much to be found by any astrologer worth
hir salt.

The journal is still available for sale on the NCGR web site.

Well, perhaps you're right about the discussion part, but I can't help being
offended when it seems someone is shifting blame for the horrors he
perpetrated. Perhaps I see things in black and white sometimes, especially
things like this. Hitler was evil. Period. Yes, he was human, and I am not
avoiding that fact at all. But there is no mistake on the part of historians
when it comes to what he said and did, as Heller suggested.  As I said, his
words and actions leave no doubt as to his intent. I do admit there were
others just as evil as he was who helped to facilitate the holocaust, and
there were plenty of others involved in his military aggressions; however,
calling him a scapegoat suggests that he was not responsible for what he
did. And that bothers me. A lot.

I don't have the answers to that. People are complicated, with many facets,
talents and flaws. How was Charlie Manson able to sway his &quot;family&quot; members?
How was Stalin able to convince his people he was the one who would cure
their ills, when what he ended up doing was murdering a vast number of them?
You seem to be saying, because of his chart, that Hitler wasn't so different
from you or me (though I would very much like to read the chart assessments
Gail mentioned by Hand, et al) but the fact remains that he WAS different,
Richard. Do you know anyone else who perpetrated such horrors on so many
people? We all know charts are about potential, but if our astrology cannot
see the potential for his evil in his chart, then I think that says more
about the weakness of our astrological methods than it does about his
character.

I get  your point. But by calling him what he was, I'm not trying to make
myself feel better because there is darkness in my own soul. I know it is
there, and I know (with my Scorpio Moon sextile Pluto) that it is there in
all of us. It is one of the basic tenets of my religion, that mankind tends
to be evil and selfish, and without proper guidance and divine grace we end
up perpetrating all sorts of evils against our fellow men. But there is one
true yardstick that sweeps aside all the questions and arguments, as well as
any attempts at moral relativism: &quot;You shall know them by their fruits.&quot;

Everything else is just a lot of hot air.

Why not just leave me in peace, Roger? I don't insist that you adhere to my

justify my statements to you, either. I avoid you for good reason.
Discussion with you has never been fruitful or enjoyable for me (as is the
case with all the dedicated Christian haters I've encountered), and your
constant harping about your belief that humans can truly know nothing is
tiresome. Because *you* know nothing, you think that informs you about *all*
humans, I suppose. Which is fine. Personally, I think living by such a
rudderless and empty philosophy would be quite bleak, but that's your
choice, and I'll leave you to it.

Ah, the nihilists. I personally admire those among them who - like Roger, I
*think* - manage to be good-hearted, of good humor, not intentionally
harmless, maybe even a good neighbor . . . as long as the prodigal sons and
daughters manage to remain atrocity-free, shouldn't we allow them the
benefit of their doubt? It's one thing for the godly to be good, but for
those who have neither fear nor hope to be good - well, isn't that something
of a miracle?

(I hope that mentioning a miracle doesn't stir up an existential/theological
hornets' nest. Speaking of which, wouldn't it be nice to steer clear of such
potential pitfalls? No one can give offense to anyone who won't take
offense. And as for those who go around trying to poke the hornets' nest
with a stick . . . what are you THINKING?)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all of us. It is one of the basic tenets of my religion, that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mankind tends to be evil and selfish, and without proper guidance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and divine grace we end up perpetrating all sorts of evils against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our fellow men. But there is one

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No offense, but to me this is a rather depressing way to view the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world. Personally, I think the opposite way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No offense taken, and of course you may view the world however you wish.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that the majority of mankind tends toward goodness and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kindness, it just doesn't always seem that way because the TV,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio, newspaper, etc. always tells us about the bad, but never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tells us about all the good in the world. Unfortunately, good people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't sell papers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to think the same thing, and like you, it depressed me to
&gt;&gt;&gt; think otherwise. But I know different, and it has nothing to do with
&gt;&gt;&gt; the media. I'm not a misanthrope, don't get me wrong. I love people
&gt;&gt;&gt; and tend to expect the best from them. I know that people do the
&gt;&gt;&gt; right thing, take the high road, and make incredible sacrifices every
&gt;&gt;&gt; day without a thought for themselves.However, I believe those urges
&gt;&gt;&gt; are not innate in human beings, but are divinely inspired. They are
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence of the spark of the divine within all of us.

&gt;&gt;&gt; All I have to do is look in the mirror to know the truth of human
&gt;&gt;&gt; nature. I am humbled by the fact that I can't go even one day without
&gt;&gt;&gt; a selfish thought, or my ego rearing it's ugly head. To paraphrase
&gt;&gt;&gt; the apostle Paul, 'that which I do not wish to do, I do; and that
&gt;&gt;&gt; which I wish to do, I do not.' I consider myself a pretty good
&gt;&gt;&gt; person. I help where I can, I have compassion on those hurting or
&gt;&gt;&gt; less fortunate than me, and I try to do the right thing. But it takes
&gt;&gt;&gt; a concentrated act of will on my part to rise above my selfish
&gt;&gt;&gt; nature, and even that I can't do without help. Luckily, I have plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt; of help. ;-)

&gt;&gt;   I'm guessing Paul was a Virgo with Pisces Ascending....:)

&gt;&gt;   So what is the root of this &quot;selfish nature&quot;?

&gt;&gt;   Why is &quot;evil&quot; not &quot;divinely inspired&quot; as well as anything else?

&gt;&gt;   Why do you think looking in the mirror informs you about *all* human
&gt;&gt; nature...and is this behavior a form of narcissism, or not...:\ ?

&gt;&gt;   Why do we think we have the capacity to judge what a &quot;high road&quot; is,
&gt;&gt; when even drinking too much water constitutes a self poisoning...:|?

&gt;&gt;   Why not admit we cannot know what we think we *should* know , and
&gt;&gt; just leave it at that, and forgo all the self deprecation, oh
&gt;&gt; Malificent one...:)?

&gt; Why not just leave me in peace, Roger? I don't insist that you adhere to
&gt; my beliefs and faith, or even agree with them, and I don't feel the need
&gt; to justify my statements to you, either. I avoid you for good reason.
&gt; Discussion with you has never been fruitful or enjoyable for me (as is
&gt; the case with all the dedicated Christian haters I've encountered), and
&gt; your constant harping about your belief that humans can truly know
&gt; nothing is tiresome. Because *you* know nothing, you think that informs
&gt; you about *all* humans, I suppose. Which is fine. Personally, I think
&gt; living by such a rudderless and empty philosophy would be quite bleak,
&gt; but that's your choice, and I'll leave you to it.

As long as we *are* testifying, I find peace comes when one finally
accepts that Faith is not having to know.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all of us. It is one of the basic tenets of my religion, that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mankind tends to be evil and selfish, and without proper guidance
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and divine grace we end up perpetrating all sorts of evils against
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our fellow men. But there is one

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No offense, but to me this is a rather depressing way to view the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world. Personally, I think the opposite way.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No offense taken, and of course you may view the world however you wish.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that the majority of mankind tends toward goodness and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kindness, it just doesn't always seem that way because the TV,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio, newspaper, etc. always tells us about the bad, but never
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tells us about all the good in the world. Unfortunately, good people
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't sell papers.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I used to think the same thing, and like you, it depressed me to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; think otherwise. But I know different, and it has nothing to do with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the media. I'm not a misanthrope, don't get me wrong. I love people
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and tend to expect the best from them. I know that people do the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; right thing, take the high road, and make incredible sacrifices every
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; day without a thought for themselves.However, I believe those urges
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are not innate in human beings, but are divinely inspired. They are
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; evidence of the spark of the divine within all of us.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; All I have to do is look in the mirror to know the truth of human
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nature. I am humbled by the fact that I can't go even one day without
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a selfish thought, or my ego rearing it's ugly head. To paraphrase
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the apostle Paul, 'that which I do not wish to do, I do; and that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; which I wish to do, I do not.' I consider myself a pretty good
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; person. I help where I can, I have compassion on those hurting or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; less fortunate than me, and I try to do the right thing. But it takes
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a concentrated act of will on my part to rise above my selfish
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nature, and even that I can't do without help. Luckily, I have plenty
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of help. ;-)

&gt; &gt;&gt;   I'm guessing Paul was a Virgo with Pisces Ascending....:)

&gt; &gt;&gt;   So what is the root of this &quot;selfish nature&quot;?

&gt; &gt;&gt;   Why is &quot;evil&quot; not &quot;divinely inspired&quot; as well as anything else?

&gt; &gt;&gt;   Why do you think looking in the mirror informs you about *all* human
&gt; &gt;&gt; nature...and is this behavior a form of narcissism, or not...:\ ?

&gt; &gt;&gt;   Why do we think we have the capacity to judge what a &quot;high road&quot; is,
&gt; &gt;&gt; when even drinking too much water constitutes a self poisoning...:|?

&gt; &gt;&gt;   Why not admit we cannot know what we think we *should* know , and
&gt; &gt;&gt; just leave it at that, and forgo all the self deprecation, oh
&gt; &gt;&gt; Malificent one...:)?

&gt; &gt; Why not just leave me in peace, Roger? I don't insist that you adhere to
&gt; &gt; my beliefs and faith, or even agree with them, and I don't feel the need
&gt; &gt; to justify my statements to you, either. I avoid you for good reason.
&gt; &gt; Discussion with you has never been fruitful or enjoyable for me (as is
&gt; &gt; the case with all the dedicated Christian haters I've encountered), and
&gt; &gt; your constant harping about your belief that humans can truly know
&gt; &gt; nothing is tiresome. Because *you* know nothing, you think that informs
&gt; &gt; you about *all* humans, I suppose. Which is fine. Personally, I think
&gt; &gt; living by such a rudderless and empty philosophy would be quite bleak,
&gt; &gt; but that's your choice, and I'll leave you to it.

&gt;    As long as we *are* testifying, I find peace comes when one finally
&gt; accepts that Faith is not having to know.
">

I think that Faith is too personal to talk about much...especially in
public. (Neptune with everything :)

&gt; &gt; Hello there:
&gt; &gt; I am really glad you have also discovered this and that you mentioned it
&gt; &gt; here, as it proves (to me at least) that the all too common evaluation of
&gt; &gt; his &quot;true character&quot; was from international politics dictated and has
&gt; &gt; been,
&gt; &gt; for the known purposes mis-interpreted by the History writers as well as
&gt; &gt; by astrologers.

&gt; His manifesto, Mein Kampf, and his actions as Chancellor and Fuhrer of
&gt; Germany are sufficient evidence of his true character. History writers have
&gt; not misinterpreted the fact that he directly caused the death of tens of
&gt; millions of people with his policies of military agression and racism.
">

I can understand your feelings (because that's what I think underlies your stance), but in astrology you have to stay unbiased and use what you know. I doubt you can really reach conclusions about H.'s &quot;true character&quot; from these factors, even if the fact that he &quot;directly caused the death of tens of millions of people with his policies of military agression and racism&quot; is true (which is still subject to discussion).

How do you know it was H.'s &quot;true character&quot; which directly caused all these things ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; My father used to say it was not A. Hitler, it was &quot;the Hitlers&quot; (behind
&gt; &gt; the scene) who were able to manipulate and influence (to a certain extent)
&gt; &gt; the person who then had to be used as the proverbial &quot;Fall-Guy&quot;.

&gt; I don't care WHAT your father said, and I don't care what some astrology
&gt; class did or didn't see in a chart. Hitler was no &quot;fall guy.&quot; He was
&gt; directly desirous of and responsible for the consequences of what he did.
&gt; Yes, there were those who were of the same mind and colluded with him, but
&gt; that in NO way absolves him of responsibility for what he did.
">

Well, there's lots of responsibility in this. Everyone involved in this was responsible for what he, himself did, and that's a LOT, much more I am certain than we know even today, wouldn't you think ?

Selecting out just one person to be the &quot;bad guy&quot; IMHO is the easy way.
Rather than not caring about what I.R. Heller's father said, I would look again at WHAT he actually said. If you think a little more, you might see he was probably far from a stupid guy.

&gt; &gt; To Ilmi's point about his chart: I've looked at it too, off and on many
&gt; &gt; times through the decades, and for the life of me I can't see the
&gt; &gt; monstrosity in it. In the 18:30 LMT chart (Braunau, Austria on APR 20,
&gt; &gt; 1889), for example, I really don't see anything extraordinary. (I recall
&gt; &gt; seeing another data set recently - anyone have it?) And that too me is the
&gt; &gt; really sobering thing: this guy was clearly rabid in many ways, but how
&gt; &gt; could a total lunatic monster have been able to get himself elected in
&gt; &gt; what was then arguably the world's most cultured nation? To me, the only
&gt; &gt; answer is that he wasn't that different from the ordinary citizen, who
&gt; &gt; even in the most cultured nation on this planet happens to harbor a
&gt; &gt; considerable dark side.

&gt; I don't have the answers to that. People are complicated, with many facets,
&gt; talents and flaws. How was Charlie Manson able to sway his &quot;family&quot; members?
&gt; How was Stalin able to convince his people he was the one who would cure
&gt; their ills, when what he ended up doing was murdering a vast number of them?
&gt; You seem to be saying, because of his chart, that Hitler wasn't so different
&gt; from you or me (though I would very much like to read the chart assessments
&gt; Gail mentioned by Hand, et al) but the fact remains that he WAS different,
&gt; Richard. Do you know anyone else who perpetrated such horrors on so many
&gt; people? We all know charts are about potential, but if our astrology cannot
&gt; see the potential for his evil in his chart, then I think that says more
&gt; about the weakness of our astrological methods than it does about his
&gt; character.
">

I would suggest something else : maybe the evil perpetrated by H. indeed actually did not come from his character.

Well, I dont' actually consider myself an astrologer, so I suppose I can hardly be considered one &quot;worth his salt&quot;, but it seemed to me his chart didn't really seem to describe him as he was known nor the known events in his life. Is that my fault ? I don't know. I.R. Heller seems to corroborate my observation.

I am sure however you could invent and dream up lots of techniques, and import new factors such as &quot;transuranians&quot;, asteroids and what have you, and make fit anything you want....

Rudolf Steiner, in the beginning of the twentieth century, already said that astrological charts, decade by decade, appear to fit their owners less and less. Doesn't that tell something - about free will, to be exact ?

&gt; or what have you (all the things the media had been told to publish),
&gt; instead of the astrological fact-findings.
&gt; Judgement is not condusive to our real findings.
">

No. You are very right.
Understandably the hate H. has been the focus of, due to the things for which he seems to have been responsible, at least to some degree has affected the public's ability to keep an unbiased judgement. Each and every human being has his good and his bad side, but there are some, H. among them, in which the good has largely gone suppressed and ignored - again, understandably. The man has become, to the public mind, an icon of evil. As the public mind NEEDS an icon of evil, just as it needs other individuals for the personification of all kinds of archetypes, H. was an easy choice. But only to the unthinking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When I, many years ago, came across this chart (it even had the time),
&gt; I evaluated every single part, I also could not find THE man, as we
&gt; know him from historical stories.
">

According to people who knew him personally, he was rather nice and pleasant with those close to him. I would even say that THIS picture seems to me more fitting his chart than the H. known to history, which may be surprising at first sight of course. Along this line, I wonder what the chart of, say, John Taylor, the Liberian rebel leader who was responsible for atrocities committed through his child army, would show ?

&gt; I guess it really depends on what you look at in solar returns and how
&gt; you approach doing them.   I have 2 Solar Return books  by 2 different
&gt; authors.  One uses solar return chart and reads it like a temporary
&gt; natal chart. She uses that chart alone to get insights.   The other
&gt; astrology doesn't take the whole solar return chart in consideration.
&gt; He looks at house rulers and its aspects in solar return. He looks at
&gt; angular aspects to solar return chart  AND natal chart midheaven/IC
&gt; axis and ascendant/descendant.

&gt; They do their solar return charts differently.

&gt; Some astrologers use midpoints in solar returns.  A matter of fact, I
&gt; had a solar return report program that interprets midpoint
&gt; configurations in solar return. They were seen as important.
&gt; Minor planets in solar return could be good for insights...especially
&gt; the major asteroids......now we have Eris which is larger than fellow
&gt; kuiper belt object/dwarf planet, Pluto.   Also the planetary nodes can
&gt; be used in solar return too.

&gt; I pay attention to house rulerships in solar return too.....it's one
&gt; of the reasons that helped me accurately suspect that I was going to
&gt; receive money during my solar return year in 2002 - 2003.  I had saw
&gt; 8th house ruler 8th house Venus conjunct Sun in 8th in my October 2002
&gt; Solar return. I ended up getting over 20,000 dollars in mental health
&gt; disability backpay.

&gt; so the thing is that an astrologer just have to find a solar return
&gt; method that works.

&gt; also....Free will is the ultimate factor.  I don't believe in making
&gt; predictions in Astrology. The individual makes choices and perform
&gt; actions that determine what events happen.
">

I believe this too... the stars don't coerce, they don't force anything, There is a certain, specific &quot;potential&quot; (I don't know a better word for it) in each and every aspect and configuration, but that only shows what's IN there. As Paracelsus said, the fool is controlled by his stars, but the wise man controls his.

Which are the 2 authors you were mentioning ?

&gt;Well, I dont' actually consider myself an astrologer, so I suppose I can
&gt;hardly be considered one &quot;worth his salt&quot;, but it seemed to me his chart
&gt;didn't really seem to describe him as he was known nor the known events
&gt;in his life. Is that my fault ?

Yes.

Perhaps Ilmi and her class didn't know where to look.

&gt;I am sure however you could invent and dream up lots of techniques,
&gt;and import new factors such as &quot;transuranians&quot;, asteroids and what
&gt;have you, and make fit anything you want....

There's no need to dream up anything.

&gt;Rudolf Steiner, in the beginning of the twentieth century, already
&gt;said that astrological charts, decade by decade, appear to fit their
&gt;owners less and less. Doesn't that tell something - about free will,
&gt;to be exact ?

No.  On that point, I'm afraid he was quite wrong.
