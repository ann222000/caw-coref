From Wikipedia,
.
&lt;&lt;Philipp Melanchthon (born Philipp Schwartzerd) (February 16, 1497 -
April 19, 1560) was a German professor &amp; theologian, a key leader of
the Lutheran Reformation, and a friend &amp; associate of Martin Luther.
Melanchthon was born at Bretten, near Karlsruhe, where his father,
Georg Schwarzerd, was armorer to Count Palatine Philip.
.
In 1507 he was sent to the Latin school at Pforzheim, the rector of
which, Georg Simler of Wimpfen, introduced him to the study of
the Latin &amp; Greek poets and of the philosophy of Aristotle.
But he was chiefly influenced by his great-uncle,
Johann Reuchlin, the great representative of humanism,
who advised him to change his family name, Schwarzerd
(literally Black-earth), into the Greek equivalent Melanchthon.
.
On account of the interest in theology shown in his lectures on Gospel
of Matthew and Epistle to the Romans, together with his investigations
into the doctrines of Paul, he was granted the degree of bachelor of
theology, and was transferred to the theological faculty. Soon he
was bound closer than ever to Wittenberg by his marriage to
*Katharina Krapp* , the mayor's daughter, a marriage contracted at
his friends' urgent request, and especially Luther's (Nov. 25, 1520).
.
The personal relation of the two great Reformers had to stand many a
test in those years, for Amsdorf and others tried to stir up Luther
against Melanchthon so that his stay at Wittenberg seemed to
Melanchthon at times almost unbearable, and he compared
himself to *Prometheus chained to the Caucasus*.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Philip Henslowe earned fame &amp; fortune as a theatrical entrepreneur.
Henslowe was a shrewd businessman; as a young man, he married his
employer's widow [Henslowe's principal actor, Edward Alleyn, married
his wife's daughter, Joan Woodward on Oct. 22, 1592], and he acquired
considerable property in London, including some Bankside stews
(brothels*). Henslowe was influential enough to gain Court
appointments: in 1592 he became a Groom of the Chamber; in
1603 a Gentleman Sewer (&quot;sewer&quot; = &quot;server&quot;)  of the Chamber.&gt;&gt;

In 1605, Alleyn purchased the manor of Dulwichand, and in 1613, he
commenced building the College of God's Gift at Dulwich. Alleyn
intended
to provide an institution which would cater to the needs of the young
and the old, so the college had both a school for poor children and
almshouses to house the elderly poor. In 1619, Alleyn signed the deed
for the foundation of the College of God's Gift and for the remaining
seven years of his life, the foundation kept him quite busy.
In 1623, Alleyn's wife Joan died &amp; five months later, Alleyn
married *CONSTANCE* Donne, daughter of the well-known John Donne.
Unfortunately, only three years later, Alleyn caught a fatal illness
while visiting his property in Yorkshire &amp; died November 25, 1626.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;*HALLe an der Saale* is the largest town in the German Bundesland of
Saxony-Anhalt. It lies in the southern part of the state, on the river
Saale. The name *HALLe* derives from the Celtic word for *SALT* , like
that of its namesake *HALLe* in Westphalia, *HALLein &amp; HALLstatt* in
Austria and Schwäbisch Hall in Germany; while the name of the river
Saale contains the Germanic root for *SALT* . Salt-making has taken
place in *HALLe* since at least the Bronze age. The town was first
mentioned in 806. It became a part of the bishopric principality of
Magdeburg in the 10th century and remained so until 1680, when
Brandenburg annexed it together with Magdeburg. The famous Baroque
composer Georg Friedrich Händel was born in *HALLe* . Today there is
an annual Händel-festival. Georg CANTORr worked as a professor at
the university of *HALLe*. A university was founded in *HALLe* in
1694. It is now combined with the University of Wittenberg and
is called Martin Luther University of *HALLe-Wittenberg* .
*HALLe* was a center of German Pietism and played an important role
in establishing the Lutheran church in North America, when Henry
Muhlenberg and others were sent as missionaries to Pennsylvania.
Henry Muhlenberg's son, Frederick Muhlenberg, the first Speaker of
the House of Representatives, was a graduate of *HALLe* University.&gt;&gt;

&quot;'It is a common practice nowadays, amongst a sort of shifting
companions that run through *EVERy art* and thrive by none,
to leave the trade of *NOVERINT* whereto they were born,
land busy themselves with *the endeavors of art* , that could
scarce Latinize their neck-verse if they should have need;
yet English Seneca, read by *CANDLE* light, yields many
good sentences, as blood is a beggar, and so forth;

&lt;&lt;In medieval England, most weddings were held on *November 25*
St. Catherine's Day. The festivities usually ended with a strange
ritual. A *CANDLEstick* with a lighted *CANDLE* was placed on
the floor and everyone took turns jumping over it. If you didn't
extinguish the flame, you'd have good luck for a full year.&gt;&gt;
