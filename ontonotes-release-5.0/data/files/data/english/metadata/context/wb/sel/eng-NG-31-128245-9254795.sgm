[Dr. Aaron Lerner - IMRA:  On the one hand, Nusseibeh's demand is not
workable.

On the other hand, if Nusseibeh was in fact negotiating for the PA (instead
of talking as an academic)  one might argue that the old George Bernard Shaw
joke applies - namely that the PA willing to forego right of return and now
a question of negotiating the price].

Nusseibeh: Right of return for withdrawal to '67 borders

The Palestinians would be prepared to forgo the right of return for millions
of refugees in return for a full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders,
including east Jerusalem and the Old City, Palestinian academic Sari
Nusseibeh told The Jerusalem Post Sunday.

It would be a mistake to downplay the urgent need for a &quot;destination&quot; to go
with the US 'Road Map' plan for peace in the Middle East, the former
representative of the PLO in Jerusalem said. &quot;Israelis have to give in on
Jerusalem, and Palestinians, in return, have to make concessions on the
right of return,&quot; he said.

Under Nusseibeh's formula, those refugees who wished to do so would be
allowed to resettle in the new Palestinian state with compensation.

&quot;In return for the right to independence and a sovereign Palestinian state,
the Palestinians would be willing to make concessions on the right of return
for refugees,&quot; Nusseibeh said. &quot;Today we have to choose between the two, and
that's why we must decide which right we want to give priority to.
&quot;I believe we must give priority to independence and an independent
Palestinian state in return for a partial right of return of refugees to
their homeland. It's better than leaving them to suffer indefinitely in
other countries.&quot;

Nusseibeh, the president of Al-Quds University in Jerusalem, said the
Palestinians have had two approaches to dealing with negotiations with
Israel. According to the first approach, he said, the Palestinians should go
to the negotiating table with Israel without defining their end goals.

Nusseibeh said that strategy had been endorsed by Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas.

&quot;Abbas told me in the past that he doesn't want to put all the cards on the
table,&quot; he said. &quot;He was also referring to the right of return for the
refugees. He said he was pragmatic about this issue, but wanted to see first
what concessions the other side would make.&quot;

Nusseibeh said he had disagreed with Abbas's approach, arguing that the
Palestinians should discuss a single package that would include all the
important issues.

&quot;His concept was based on the idea of waiting to see what the other side
would offer,&quot; he said. &quot;He said, 'Let's go to the negotiating table and
bargain about everything.'&quot;

According to Abbas's approach, Nusseibeh said, the Palestinians would insist
on the principle of the right of return during the negotiations. Only after
Israel made concessions, especially on the issue of Palestinian sovereignty
in Jerusalem, would the Palestinians be prepared to stop insisting on the
implementation of the right of return.

&quot;But my suggestion has been that it's far better to put all the cards on the
table in one package,&quot; he said. &quot;The theme of the Palestinian leadership has
changed, and we are now seeking a whole package.&quot;
