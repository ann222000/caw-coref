I've been very interested in Ken Wilber's writings-Theory of Everything,
Integral Psychology, Eye of Spirit, et al. Wilber had made a major
contribution to philosophy in harmonizing all sorts of seemingly disparate
thought systems in his integral vision of quadrants, lines and levels. I
wish he were able to make some connection with astrology, which he
apparently doesn't take very seriously. In Eye of Spirit, he refers to
astrology as a "horizontal typology," "intrinsically impossible to verify as
characterology." Maybe his problem is that he hasn't advanced beyond sun
sign astrology, although I find that hard to believe. I think he's more or
less invited serious astrologers to take him on. Is anyone up to the task?

very oracular, Ray.  If you haven't read Wilber, no shame, no blame.

Please forgive me if I try this again.  Although I am an amateur on both
sides, I guess the task--to explain astrology to Wilber or vice versa--is
probably mine (now or in a future life), since nobody else claims it, but I
would be grateful if anyone else with knowledge of both astrology and
Wilber's writings (and/or Spiral Dynamics) would step in.  Again, why Wilber
is important:  he is one of the few serious thinkers who have made a
thorough attempt to integrate such apparent opposites as science and
spirituality in a single perspective that takes nothing away from
either--and no one has been more thorough than Wilber.  He may have a few
blind spots (e.g. astrology), but he's made a significant contribution.

As a basis for further discussion, I will tentatively state that I believe
there is a developmental, "vertical," component in astrology.  I think that
most astrologers would agree.  Maybe some answers are to be found in the
direction of "esoteric astrology," although I've never been able to grasp
much of that.  I know that some who take reincarnation for granted believe
that the sign on the ascendant denotes the sun sign of the native's next
incarnation (or that the moon's nodes similarly relate to past and future
lives); or that, somehow, in the course of many incarnations a soul
personality travels the full circle of the zodiac.  Personally, I view the
horoscope as a complex problem of personal (or collective) evolution,
essentially a matter of recognizing and accommodating aspects of self.  The
fact that astrology posits a personal/cosmic nexus takes us out of the realm
of mere, or horizontal, typology.  After all, what are humans other than
energy (or morphogenetic) fields in a "sea of vibrations?"  There is, then,
no ultimate boundary to self, but there are distinct levels of realization.
We see in astrology (at least retrospectively, or once we have come to know
a person) that individuals are "affected" by astrological factors (or
impersonate them), mostly unconsciously.  In my opinion, the goal of
astrology is to raise our consciousness of these factors, and thus to expand
our realization of self.  (Does this have any relevance to the prediction of
earthquakes, the weather, and fluctuations in the stock market?  Yes, but I
won't attempt to develop that argument here.)  My reason for paying
attention to planetary transits in my own horoscope is to understand, and
successfully meet, the challenges transits bring.  To me, astrology is about
recognizing developmental challenges and opportunities, accommodating
stress, (re-)claiming various energies as components or qualities of myself,
productively using the gifts of the spirit.  It is anything but a flat
typology.

I believe that this is at least a partial answer to Wilber's critique.

A person's horoscope will affect their life, and teach them lessons,
whether they know astrology or not.

For example, in this week's Weekly NewsScope, which will stay
permanently at the address:

http://www.halloran.com/5asn1-1.htm

Wolfstar examines the horoscope of band leader Artie Shaw, who had
eight marriages.  I doubt if Artie Shaw understood his horoscope.
Wolfstar writes,  "Shaw's Venus squares his Mars-Neptune, a dynamic
configuration that leads into endless cycles of falling in love, and
then falling out of love through disillusionment or finding greener
pastures elsewhere. It's the signature of the incurable romantic, and
when this is taken into consideration with his vengeful Scorpio Moon,
we can see why his autobiographical novel was titled "I Love You, I
Hate You, Drop Dead.""

"While Venus and Mars deal with love and romance, making a real
commitment comes under the auspices of Juno, the marriage asteroid.
Shaw's Juno is also in Cancer, underscoring the stay-at-home
expectations he and that era's culture expected from a wife. But with
his Juno squaring Venus, he was always lured away. Juno's opposition to
Uranus, the divorce planet, brought chaos into his preconceptions."

What a knowledge of astrology brings to the individual is freedom.  It
is the same kind of freedom that a discovery of one's unconscious
motivations brings to a person.  When a person faces instances of
unconscious mental pain, it makes them more free, because they don't
have to act in an avoidant way anymore.  An understanding of the
sources of our feelings and behaviors gives us more choices, more
freedom.

A person does not have to know astrology to experience the lessons of
their horoscope.  But a knowledge of astrology gives us more
information with which to make choices.  It gives us human dignity,
helping us not just to be a puppet on a string.

RM: I have a huge collection of books, but I never read fiction at
all, and only read opinions sparingly. I did however (many years ago)
read four books in their entirety so I would know what the experience
was like - the first was "Ten North Frederick" but I discovered too
late that it was fiction but continued anyway. The second was "The
world of Polly Adler" - the story of an American prostitute. The third
was a futuristic book about euthanasia, and the last was a report of
the Vietnam war by the only Western correspondent trusted by Ho Chi
Minh, so your Wilber wouldn't get a look-in :-)

RM: It is very obvious from the few things you've said that Wilber has
studied astrology only a little. If he had studied it a lot and
concluded that there was no correlation between planetary movement and
the affairs of various life-forms, then at least he would be
acknowledging that astrology works and is valuable.

'special'.

RM: Who cares if it's "flat" or "verical" (according to one person's
definition of those terms)?
It's more important to know what's real or not real.
