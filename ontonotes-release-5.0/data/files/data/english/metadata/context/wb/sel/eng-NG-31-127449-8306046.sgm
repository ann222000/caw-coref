Both.  Either.  Depends on how the person I'm speaking with pronounces it and
then my choice is usually, at least at first, unconscious.  It's one of the
handful of words I've never decided upon.

I do tend towards spee-shees, though.  Sounds less like feces.

That's a specious objection.

When acronymically referring to the Viet Cong, you wouldn't say the
vee-shees, you'd say the vee-cees.

Or someone to whom you leased something, they'd be the lee-cees, not
the lee-shees.

Would you say &quot;Nurse, draw me 10 cee-shees of blood!&quot;...?
I think not!

A co-worker, who hails from Great Britain, pronounces &quot;assume&quot; with a
&quot;sh&quot; sound: &quot;uh-shoom&quot;.

This is consistent with &quot;assure&quot; and &quot;insure&quot;, but does not match

I've heard it from a couple of people, I just can't figure out what
the common factor is among them - they are all university educated,
but they've all kept regional accents and aren't the type to affect
something just for the hell of it.  But I can think of people from the

Same pronunciations here, except for species.

I'm California born, though my father came from New Mexico via
Missouri, and he was the scientist in the family, so maybe that
explains it.
Though I don't remember how he pronounced species.

The only pronunciations of his that sounded weird to me were issolated
instead of eyesolated for isolated, and trayzhure instead of trehzhure
for treasure.

I have a friend whose first name is &quot;Maurice&quot;;  he's not fond of it,
and has always used his second given name instead.  (I sympathise, as
I have three forenames, and use the middle one.)

When he travels to the US -- his business sends him there now and
then -- he finds three things consistently tiresome:

(a) by default, check-in staff and the like very often address him by
his given name (rather than Mr [surname], which he, like me, would
prefer as the default)
(b) they use the wrong given name (having invariably failed to ask
him which one he uses)
(c) they pronounce it as &quot;maur-EECE&quot;.

I had an umbrella name &quot;maur-EECE&quot; for awhile. I kinda like the name

I don't know why some things get named and some don't. I had two named
umbrellas at the same time; Maurice was one of those long black ones
with a button that when when pressed caused Maurice to open with an
impressive &quot;whoof!&quot;  The other one was red with a bamboo handle, named
Drusilla, which my father left on the DC Metro one rainy day. Drusilla
was a great umbrella and given that he'd taken it without my
permission, I'm still pretty bitter. Maurice eventually went inside-
out, alas.

But aside from Batray, I can't think of other possessions in recent
memory that have acquired a name. Hmmm.

The pronunciation reminds me of liking the name EEE-von, but not EH-

&gt;&gt; PS Given the way you Leftpondians mangle simple names like Bernard,
&gt;&gt; Deirdre, Colin etc., it's just struck me that you might not even
&gt;&gt; pronounce this newsgroup as Ohltt Fann Sess'l Add'ms...

&gt;I have a friend whose first name is &quot;Maurice&quot;;  he's not fond of it,
&gt;and has always used his second given name instead.  (I sympathise, as
&gt;I have three forenames, and use the middle one.)

&gt;When he travels to the US -- his business sends him there now and
&gt;then -- he finds three things consistently tiresome:

&gt;(a) by default, check-in staff and the like very often address him by
&gt;his given name (rather than Mr [surname], which he, like me, would
&gt;prefer as the default)
&gt;(b) they use the wrong given name (having invariably failed to ask
&gt;him which one he uses)
&gt;(c) they pronounce it as &quot;maur-EECE&quot;.

You can blame Steve Miller for that.
