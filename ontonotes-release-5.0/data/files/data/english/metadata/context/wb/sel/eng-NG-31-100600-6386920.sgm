PO Box 219 Madeira Park, BC V0N 2H0

Written by British Columbia native Jack Boudreau, Sternwheelers &amp;
Canyon Cats: Whitewater Freighting on the Upper Fraser presents the
fascinating true story of the whitewater men who crewed boats along
wild rivers and creeks, seeking to bring freight and supplies to
northern British Columbia from 1862 to 1921, prior to the completion
of the Grand Trunk Railway. The riverboat life was dangerous; taming
rough waters might involve such daring tactics as using powder to blow
out boulders and logjams, and the Grand Canyon of British Columbia's
Fraser River in particular was responsible for the deaths of at least
two hundred individuals. Extensively researched, and presented with a
smattering of black-and-white photographs, Sternwheelers &amp; Canyon Cats
is a welcome condition to nautical history and Canadian history
shelves.

Henry Heller
Monthly Review Press

1583671390 $22.95 www.monthlyreview.org

Written by Henry Heller (Professor of History, University of Manitoba
in Winnipeg, Canada), The Cold War and the New Imperialism: A Global
History, 1945-2005 is a scholarly examination of world history during
the sixty years since the end of World War II. From struggles for
national liberation that spelled the demise of colonial empires, to
revolutions in China, Cuba, and Vietnam, to neoliberalism,
intervention, and more, The Cold War and the New Imperialism
encapsulates the transformations of history in straightforward prose,
with a keen eye for spotting long-term trends. Chapters reveal that
the end of the Cold War created as many problems for the United States
as it solved, including the erosion of America's political, economic,
and financial hegemony, costly military adventures abroad, and
increasing inequality and authoritarianism at home. Highly
recommended, and a welcome contribution to college and public library
world history shelves.
