Dairy Queen franchisee and United States Senator Ken Salazar, a self- described "moderate," casually labels one of the nine highest ranking members of an equal and co-ordinate branch of the the US government, Justice Clarence Thomas, an " abomination ." This is not the first time the Senator has resorted to Biblical epithets to describe people whose politics he doesn't like. Before too long Michelle Malkin will have to add a new chapter to Unhinged just to keep pace with Salazar.

After he called Thomas an abomination, Salazar added: "I've been in front of the court and I know the justices." Trouble is that a LEXIS search reveals that Salazar, a lawyer and former Colorado attorney-general, has never appeared before the Supreme Court. I called the Senator's office and inquired about this claim. They said they'd get back to me with an answer. That was four days ago. Maybe Salazar meant to say that he walked by the SCOTUS building on his way to Bible study class.

Please try again with the Senator's office and update this post about Salazar's apparent poor memory.
