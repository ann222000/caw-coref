Daily Bible Verse

Ephesians 1:7-12 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.

Messages in this topic (1) 2. Dear Children Posted by: &quot;mitzi green&quot; leafchaser47@yahoo.com leafchaser47 Wed Dec 5, 2007 5:41 am (PST) Dear Children,

It has come to my attention that many of you are upset that folks are taking My name out of the season.

How I personally feel about this celebration can probably be most easily understood by those of you who have been blessed with children of your own. I don't care what you call the day. If you want to celebrate My birth, just get along and love one another.

Now, having said that, let Me go on. If it bothers you that the town in which you live doesn't allow a scene depicting My birth, then just get rid of a couple of Santas and snowmen and put in a small Nativity scene on your own front lawn. If all My followers did that, there wouldn't be any need for such a scene on the town square because there would be many of them all around town.

Stop worrying about the fact that people are calling the tree a &quot;holiday&quot; tree, instead of a &quot;Christmas&quot; tree. It was I who made all trees. You can remember Me anytime you see any tree. Decorate a grape vine if you wish; I actually spoke of that one in a teaching, explaining who I am in relation to you, and what each of our tasks were. If you have forgotten that one, look up John 15:1-8.

If you want to give Me a present in remembrance of My birth, here is My wish list. Choose something from it:

Instead of writing protest letters objecting to the way My birthday is being celebrated, write letters of love and hope to soldiers away from home. They are terribly afraid and lonely this time of year. I know, they tell Me all the time.
Visit someone in a nursing home. You don't have to know them personally. They just need to know someone cares about them.
Instead of writing George complaining about the wording on the cards his staff sent out this year, why don't you write and tell him that you'll be praying for him and his family this year. Then follow up. It will be nice hearing from you again.
Instead of giving your children a lot of gifts you can't afford and they don't need, spend time with them. Tell them the story of My birth, and why I came to live with you down here. Hold them in your arms and remind them that I love them.
Pick someone who has hurt you in the past and forgive him or her.
Did you know that someone in your town will attempt to take their own life this season because they feel so alone and hopeless? Since you don't know who that person is, try giving everyone you meet a warm smile; it could make the difference.
Instead of nit-picking about what the retailer in your town calls the holiday, be patient with the people who work there. Give them a warm smile and a kind word. Even if they aren't allowed to wish you a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, that doesn't keep you from wishing them one. Then stop shopping there on Sunday. If the store didn't make so much money on that day, they'd close and let their employees spend the day at home with their families.
If you really want to make a difference, support a missionary -- especially one who takes My love and Good News to those who have never heard My name.
Here's a good one. There are individuals and whole families in your town who not only will have no Christmas tree, but neither will they have any presents to give or receive. If you don't know any, buy some food and a few gifts and give them to the Salvation Army or some other charity that believes in Me, and they will make the delivery for you.
Finally, if you want to make a statement about your belief in and loyalty to Me, then behave like a Christian. Don't do things in secret that you wouldn't do in My presence. Let people know, by your actions, that you are one of Mine.
Don't forget; I am God and can take care of Myself. Just love Me and do what I have told you to do. I'll take care of all the rest. Check out the list above and get to work; time is short. I'll help you, but the ball is now in your court. Do have a most blessed Christmas with all those whom you love. And remember...

I love you!

Messages in this topic (1) 3a. The Savior Posted by: &quot;mitzi green&quot; leafchaser47@yahoo.com leafchaser47 Wed Dec 5, 2007 5:44 am (PST) The Savior

And they came with haste
and found Mary and Joseph,
and the Babe lying in a manger.
Luke 2:16

Read: Isaiah 9:6-7
There's no one like Christ the Lord. He's the Savior of the world, the Lamb of God, the Wonderful Counselor, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.

The Bible uses more than 300 names and titles to describe Him, but Jesus can no more be contained in His names and titles than the ocean can be bottled in a collection of containers, however beautiful. He is timeless and boundless, and His infinity extends through the universe into perpetual depths of forever-ness.

Charles Spurgeon confessed, &quot;I know my words cannot honor Him according to His merits: I wish they could. Indeed, I grow less and less satisfied with my thoughts and language concerning Him. He is too glorious for my feeble language to describe Him. If I could speak with the tongues of men and of angels, I could not speak worthily of Him. If I could borrow all the harmonies of heaven, and enlist every harp and song of the glorified, yet were not the music sweet enough for His praises.&quot;

We've made Christmas into a complicated affair; but Jesus himself, though incomprehensible, is as simple as a humble manger and as loving as an innocent Babe. The greatest celebration of the season is simply coming with haste . . . and adoring Him.

Oh come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

Messages in this topic (2) 4. It's Our Savior's Arrival ,Not Santa's Posted by: &quot;mitzi green&quot; leafchaser47@yahoo.com leafchaser47 Wed Dec 5, 2007 5:48 am (PST) It's Our Savior's Arrival, Not Santa's!
In all the crazy, holiday rush, take time to focus on Jesus. It's important that we rivet into our heads exactly what we are celebrating. It's our Savior's arrival, not Santa's!

When the time had fully come, God sent His Son,
born of a woman, born under law, to redeem those
under the law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.
Galatians 4:4
Maybe if we were more thoughtful on what God has given to us, we might be more thankful in our prayers. Maybe if we took more time to appreciate others and be amazed at the things of God, we would find more contentment amidst all the craziness during the holiday season. Maybe if we focused a little more on building relationships and restoring friendships, then we would not have so much time to focus on what we currently do not have. Maybe . . . Maybe . . . Maybe . . . NO maybes about it! The more YOU focus on YOU and YOUR life, the less God will be able to do in it. It is only when God becomes our focus that amazing things happen.

It's so easy to get into the rut of selfishness. Opening one gift after another and never really being satisfied with anything we get. Why? Because no treasures, no gems, no money, no car, nothing can satisfy like Jesus. We forget to be thankful for what God has blessed our lives with. We forget to appreciate our spouses. We forget to appreciate our jobs. We forget to appreciate our health. We forget all that God has done for us.

Instead, we are drawn into the lie that others don't care and that we are miserable. And then we fulfill that lie. We actually become miserable. We become hopeless. We become depressed. We become sad. If this is you, then stop it! Take your eyes off of you for a change and start noticing others around you. Start noticing the blessings that God has poured out on you. This will only happen when you allow God to be your sole focus.

Got that? Your sole focus. Not a focus on what others have or what others think of you. Not a focus on what you are wearing or driving. But a focus on God and the peace and joy you get from Him alone. God has a purpose and plan for each one of us. But we must be willing to look toward Him and forget about looking anywhere else for our self worth and purpose. Let God show you how to be content and thankful as you stay focused on Him during this holiday season. Start now. It's never too late.

Wishing all of you a Merry Christmas and a year filled with the awesome love, peace and joy that only Christ can give. Stay focused! With love from Jeanette.

Messages in this topic (1) 5. Meditating On The Christ Child Posted by: &quot;mitzi green&quot; leafchaser47@yahoo.com leafchaser47 Wed Dec 5, 2007 5:56 am (PST) Meditating on the Christ Child

Read: Luke 2:19
Merry Christmas! Today is most likely a busy day for you. There are meals to cook, guests to welcome, places to go, people to see, gifts to unwrap, and possibly, even a few gifts to be wrapped! This holy day can certainly be hectic for all of us.

Maybe your Christmas is just getting started. Or perhaps, the holiday is drawing to a close. Whatever the case, this is a moment of meditation in the midst of one of the busiest days of the year. So, In Touch wants to give you one word of counsel: slow down. For the next few moments, let the responsibilities and concerns of today slide off your shoulders. Allow the demands of family and friends to disappear. Focus your thoughts on that baby in the manger. Slow down, and think about . . . Jesus.

One of the most powerful, yet overlooked, verses in the Christmas story may be Luke 2:19. Just picture it: the newborn Christ crying in the night, a new father frantically trying to provide a comfortable shelter in the unusual setting, animals rustling around, strangers interrupting an intimate moment.

Without a doubt, the first Christmas was hectic, too. And yet, there was Mary, calmly taking it all in. She knew every aspect of this night was important. Yet, her total focus was on the child in her arms. She did not simply notice what was happening; she “treasured all these things and pondering them in her heart.” She breathed in the full experience and held it in her spirit. As you celebrate today, take the time to truly experience the wonder of Christmas, and ponder it in your heart as well.

by Dr. Charles Stanley, &quot;In Touch&quot; Daily Devotional, Copyright © 2007

For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given:
and the government shall be upon His shoulder:
and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor,
The mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.
Isaiah 9:6 (KJV)

Messages in this topic (1) 6. 1 Samuel 17:49 Posted by: &quot;mitzi green&quot; leafchaser47@yahoo.com leafchaser47 Wed Dec 5, 2007 5:58 am (PST) THEN DAVID PUT HIS HAND IN HIS BAG AND TOOK OUT A
STONE; AND HE SLUNG IT AND STRUCK THE PHILISTINE IN
HIS FOREHEAD, SO THAT THE STONE SANK INTO HIS
FOREHEAD, AND HE FELL ON HIS FACE TO THE EARTH.
( 1 SAMUEL 17:49 *NKJV )

We all face something in our lives that seems just like the
giant Goliath did to that young shepherd boy, David. So just
as David, if we put all of our trust in our Heavenly Father, we
will be victorious as well! For God has promised us, &quot;FEAR NOT,
FOR I AM WITH YOU; BE NOT DISMAYED, FOR I AM YOUR
GOD. I WILL STRENGTHEN YOU, YES, I WILL HELP YOU, I
WILL UPHOLD YOU WITH MY RIGHTEOUS RIGHT HAND.&quot;
( ISAIAH 41:10 )

After all it is written that: HE GIVES POWER TO THE
WEAK, AND THOSE WHO HAVE NO MIGHT HE
INCREASES STRENGTH. ( ISAIAH 40:29 ) That is of course
when: WE WALK BY FAITH NOT BY SIGHT.
( 2 CORINTHIANS 5:7 )

When facing your own &quot;Giant,&quot; remember
the story of that young shepherd boy David, and his tremendous
faith in our Heavenly Father! After all it is written: FOR
ASSUREDLY, I SAY TO YOU, IF YOU HAVE FAITH AS A
MUSTARD SEED, YOU WILL SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN,
'MOVE FROM HERE TO THERE,' AND IT WILL MOVE;
AND NOTHING WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU.
( MATTHEW 17:20 )

FINALLY. MY BRETHREN, BE STRONG IN THE LORD AND
IN THE POWER OF HIS MIGHT. ( EPHESIANS 6:10 ) For you
are His Child and He will always Love and Care for you as well.
Amen!

In HIS Love &amp; Service,
Pastor Allen

November 29, 2007
And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, &quot;O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.&quot; Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, &quot;The LORD, He is God; the LORD, He is God.&quot; --1 Kings 18:36-39
Elijah was just a man like you and me. He had the same kinds of flaws and failures as the rest of us. In fact, he became so fearful and depressed on one occasion that he ran into the desert and prayed that he would die!
But you know what's great about Elijah? Even though he was imperfect... even though he had his faults and failures... Elijah had an enduring faith that his God was alive. And because Elijah knew that God was alive, he wasn't afraid of men or what men might do to him!
Isn't that great?! Wouldn't you like to have the kind of faith that says, &quot;I won't be intimidated by anything or anyone... ever!&quot;? Or the kind of faith that says, &quot;It doesn't matter what the culture around me says, I'm going to stand for the truth of God's Word, regardless of the cost!&quot;?
Second Chronicles 16:9 says, &quot;For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless toward Him.&quot;
Christian, God is searching your heart today. And when He does, will He find a heart that's full of a living faith? Will He find a heart that's loyal and steadfast to Him?

Maybe today you'd admit that you've been practicing a religion more than you've been enjoying a relationship with Christ. If so, I want to encourage you... Jesus Christ is alive! And He wants to have a deeper relationship with you!
Today, it's my prayer that you will allow Christ to come alive in your life. Be open to Him... and just see if He won't use you... like he did Elijah... in extraordinary ways!

Jesus Christ is alive... and He wants a relationship with you!

God Will Bring You Through!
A tempestuous head wind arose... Euroclydon.
Acts 27:14
Euroclydon! It's the only storm named in Scripture. It means &quot;typhoon,&quot; and Paul had to sail through it to reach his destiny. Observe:
(1) To reach your goal you'll have to go through storms. &quot;When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved&quot; (Acts 27:20 NIV). There will be days when you'll wonder how you're going to make it. But by God's grace you will! (2) Storms reveal how well you know God. &quot;Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul,'&quot; (Acts 27:23-24 NIV). It's the tough times that reveal the strength of your God-connection. (3) God can make a success out of a shipwreck. Notice some important things in this story: (a) Sometimes you'll have to throw stuff overboard (Acts 27:18). (b) In spite of your best efforts you'll occasionally run aground (Acts 27:26). (c) You must remember what God told you and stand on it (Acts 27:25). (4) Often the worst thing that could have happened turns out for the best. God used this shipwreck to reach Malta with the Gospel. And
notice what happened to Paul and his travelling companions as they left that island: &quot;They honoured us… and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed&quot; (Acts 28:10 NIV).
Stop worrying, God will provide what you need in ways that amaze you. If you're His child you're not the victim of circumstances. Your future is not in the hands of people, it's in the hands of God. And what He owns, He takes care of!

A very good morning to you. I hope you have a blessed day. Every one is

One Minute at a Time

Lord, You give me today one minute at a time. That's all I have, all
I ever will have.

Give me the faith that believes each moment asks me to trust You even

Give me the hope that holds within each minute despite pain or doubt
or fear an anticipation of eternity with you.

Give me the love that transforms each minute of my life into a
reflection of Your forgiveness, mercy and goodness. Amen

BIBLE VERSE:

Yet those who wait for the Lord Will gain new strength; They will mount
up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They will

Give me the love that transforms each minute of my life into a
reflection of Your forgiveness, mercy and goodness. Amen

BIBLE VERSE:

Yet those who wait for the Lord Will gain new strength; They will mount
up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They will
walk and not become weary. Isaiah 40:31

Messages in this topic (1) 13. Taking Hostages Posted by: &quot;BishopMax&quot; BishopMax@charter.net bishopmax4 Wed Dec 5, 2007 8:01 am (PST) Taking Hostages
By; Dr. Charles Stanley

We are all painfully aware of what it means for somebody to be taken
hostage. We are outraged when the news of such an atrocity reaches us. And
yet when we refuse to forgive others for ourselves, for that matter, there
is a sense in in which we hold them hostage. Let me explain.

When a person is taken hostage on the international scene, the
abductors usually want something. It may be money, weapons or release of
prisoners. The message they send, in essence is, &quot;If you give us what we
want, we will give you back what we have taken.&quot; There is always some type
of condition, a ransom of some sort.

When individuals refuse to forgive others for a wrong done to the, they are saying the same thing. But instead of holding people hostage until they get their demands, they withhold love, acceptance, respect, service, kindness, patience, or whatever the others value. The message they send is this; &quot;Until I feel you have repaid me for the wrong done to me, you will not have my acceptance.&quot; if we go back to our definition, we can see that the element missing from this scenario is cancellation of the debt. Persons who who refuse to forgive refuse to cancel the debt. Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post
Messages in this topic (1) 14. What is Forgiveness? Posted by: &quot;BishopMax&quot; BishopMax@charter.net bishopmax4 Wed Dec 5, 2007 11:56 am (PST) What Is Forgiveness?
Dr. Charles Stanley

Forgiveness is &quot;The act of setting someone from an obligation to you
that is a result of wrong done against you.&quot;
For example, a debt is forgiven when you free your debtor of his obligation
to pay back what he owes you.
Forgiveness, then, involves three elements; injury, a debt resulting
from the injury and a cancellation of the debt. All three elements are
essential if forgiveness to be take place. Before we look in more detail at
the process, however, we need to trace the sequence of events that lead to
bondage when this process is abandoned. This is important because I believe
most people who suffer from unforgiving spirit do not know that
unforgiveness is the root of their problem.
All they know is that they &quot;can't stand&quot; to be around certain people. They find themselves wanting to strike out at people when certain subjects are discussed. They feel uncomfortable around certain personality types. They lose their temper over little things. They constantly struggle with guilt over sins committed in the past. They can't get away from the ambivalence of hating the ones they know they should love the most. Such feelings and behavior patterns often indicate that people have not come to grips with the forgiveness of God and the implications of that forgiveness.

Messages in this topic (3) 17a. PROGRESSIVE POSSESSION from the book Daily Overcoming Posted by: &quot;Nathaniel &amp; Margaret Williams&quot; nat@hal-pc.org natcmf Wed Dec 5, 2007 12:33 pm (PST) BlankDECEMBER 5

PROGRESSIVE POSSESSION

“But the upright shall have good things in possession.” – Prov. 28:10

“He that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain.”

– Isa. 57:13

Just as that STONE “cut out without hands” becomes “a great mountain, and fills the whole earth,” Dan. 2:34:35), so also in our individual experience. The SEED OF LIFE, which we have received from Him, shall progressively grow in us until “old things have passed away, and all things become new”. Out of every experience and working of God we have gained a foretaste of that glory which shall be ours in fullest measure as He perfects that which concerneth us.

We have tasted of hope, and enjoyed a measure of peace, we have felt surges of His love, and known rare moments of the power of the age to come, and have been blessed with His rest – yet it has all been so ‘in part’. Nevertheless, we find that as we are “poured from vessel to vessel”, from circumstance to circumstance, there is a constant change taking place, and a new growth. When the tears are wiped away and we survey what He has wrought through the dark night of the soul, we find our possession has increased, and we bow low to worship at His feet.

We rejoice “in the hope of the glory of God” and are able to “glory in our tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope,” (Rom. 5:2-4). Through it all, these things are WORKING, they are PRODUCING, and our possession is being enlarged. Whereas we once felt as Jacob, “all these things are against me,” (Gen. 42:36), now we come to believe with Joseph, “God meant it unto good,” – Gen. 50:20

The name Joseph means ‘adding’, so named because when he was born, his mother Rachel felt that her long affliction of barrenness was over, and this first son was a promise that God would add to her another son. Every time she looked at him, or called his name, it was a reminder of that promise that more would be added. In every blessing received, in every new portion we possess, lies the promise that there is more to come, until we receive His fullness.

Hi,

Below is a little contribution I made to an ongoing dialogue with Charley, Jonathan Mitchell, and a dear brother from England, Graham Marriott, who we have mostly been encouraging to go with what he knows in his heart to be true re: ultimate reconciliation. I though you all might find it to be a good reminder, especially in this season, of what God is all about, and where He's really coming from.

Peace, John

Subject: Re: Grace

Hi guys,

I haven't had much to say of late owing both to having returned to &quot;secular&quot; employment full-time for a season, with its demands on my time and energy, and to finding myself in a season of a very primal pensive mood that has made me less prone to talking/writing and more prone to listening. But I do want to encourage you, Graham, to be confident in your assessment of the relationship between God's gift and God's grace. You're right on target, brother.

I have an article among the very first posted on our web page under 2001 articles, titled &quot;Gift and Grace,&quot; that might be helpful to you in leading the study on grace, and encourage and confirm your basic premise. I was myself, very encouraged when my beloved mentor, Harry Robert Fox, devoted one of his Bible studies to that writing.

In the way of laying a foundation for understanding the relationship between God's gift and His grace, I think we have to consider the relationship between those attributes of God that are particularly highlighted in scripture. It could be said that all the characteristics that are properly ascribed to the Divine Nature find their center in the truth that God is love, so that when God is described also, for instance, as light, spirit and consuming fire, such descriptions essentially explain the meaning and nature of divine love.

That God is light, speaks to us of the fact that it is the nature of love to enlighten---to GIVE understanding. God's love is self-revelatory. It shines out of its essence and needs nothing outside of itself to make itself known. That God is spirit confronts us with the truth, that in spite of the propensity of divine love to subject itself to all that is adversarial to its existence, love is still, underneath all that hostility, universally and constitutionally pervasive. It is the spirit that constitutes all being, all existence. It's what &quot;makes the world go around,&quot; from within, and is what gives all things their cohesiveness.

That God is a consuming fire encourages us to trust that the inner love-spirit essence of all things, from the inside out, will cleanse itself from all that seeks to defile it. The divine nature of love can be afflicted by such defilement but it can never in its essence be defiled. On this foundation rests our salvation.

So it is with the gift of God, and the graciousness of God. As it is true that when we speak of God as spirit, light, and consuming fire, we are essentially explaining the nature of love – those other attributes do not stand alongside love, they explain love as they are the unfolding of love's nature---, so when we speak of the grace of God, we are – really redundantly---explaining the nature of His gift; that it is, in fact, free. We are emphasizing the obvious, that God's gift cannot be earned. It is, as all gifts should be, freely given. It is what it is----His gift. The grace of God is, to my understanding, simply God's givingness.

God's gift and God's grace do not stand alongside one another. As Jesus said of His relationship with the Father, &quot;I and the Father are One,&quot; so also, God's gift (Christ) and His grace (His givingness) are one. He is graciously giving. He gifts us out from His nature of givingness. Finally understood, God only has one gift for mankind, and

that is the gift of His Son.

In Him are all the riches of the glory of God's grace. We need to see the obvious, that Paul's expression, &quot;the glory of His grace&quot; simply means: His grace's glory. God is gloriously gracious, and we see grace's glory in the face of Jesus Christ. In Him we see summed up the givingness of God, and NO decision on the part of man can frustrate the givingness of God. He WILL give Himself, in His Son, to all creation until all creation is full of His glory, so that all creation will come to realize its true inner constitution. This is the essence of the kingdom of God.

Proverbs 12; 19
Truthful words stand the test of time,
But lies are soon exposed.

Truth is always timely; it applies today and in the future. Because it is connected with God's changeless character, it is also changeless. Think for a moment about the centuries that have passed since these proverbs were written. Consider the countless hours that have been spent carefully studying every sentence of Scripture. The Bible has withstood the test of time. Because God is truth, you can trust His Word to guide you.

Heavenly Father, we love You and thank You for Your timeless Word. May we devote more time ourselves to studying Your Word and applying it our lives. In Jesus' Name. Amen..

Have a joyful day!
In Christ,
April
