In the past week, two significant demonstrations were launched by
Iraq's Shiites, including one on Monday 1/19 that involved an estimated
100,000 in the streets of Baghdad (including, from all accounts, some
Sunnis who support open elections). The other, on Tuesday, was smaller
and drawn from the poorer, more radical elements of the community who
incline toward Muqtada al-Sadr. I cannot underline strongly enough how
significant it is that Sistani was willing to go to the street in this
way, and that so many tens of thousands responded.

This move seems to me to signal severe trouble ahead. The US is
making intransigent noises, despite a Guardian report last Thursday that
Mr. Bremer might give in and hold open elections. Were the US really to
insist on sticking to its guns, the Bush administration might well face
the prospect of hundreds of thousands of angry Iraqis demonstrating all
this summer and into the fall, with the attendant danger of violence
breaking out between them and US troops. The US public may not care very
much about Iraq, but they certainly won't want to see US troops shoot
down innocent civilian protesters because the Bush administration would
not allow free and fair elections.

On Friday, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani asked Shiites not to
demonstrate. He felt the point had already been made, and that it was
time to let Kofi Annan and the United Nations deliberate. (This
according to Edward Wong of the NYT .) Again, it is highly significant
that, at this stage of the game, at least, he was able to turn off the
spigot. But there is a danger that if he accustoms Iraqis to
demonstrating in the tens of thousands, he will lose control of them if
the US disappoints them.

Meanwhile, members of the Interim Governing Council who earlier had
favored the US approach to carefully controlled elections, based on the
Coalition-appointed provincial councils, defected to Sistani. Over the
weekend Ahmad Chalabi told a skeptical audience at the arch-conservative
American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC, that he now favored
open elections and believed they could be held. And Abdul Aziz al-Hakim,
leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq with its
15,000-strong Badr Corps paramilitary, told Reuters the same thing this
weekend: " It can be done, if we want it and make the effort. I believe
they can be run."

Az-Zaman reported that al-Hakim admitted, "Ideally elections would
depend on the existence of a census, an electoral law, and a law
governing parties . . . There are problems . . . But I believe that
[elections] will express the opinion and the will of the people . . .
will give a voice to all, and holding them is feasible."

Sistani initially portrayed his initiative to press for open
elections as a blow struck for indigenous Iraqi political figures
against expatriate carpetbaggers, but now even the carpetbaggers are
saying they think it is a good idea. Chalabi, Alawi and the others must
have thought at first that it would be easier for them to ensure their
election and power with the stage-managed American plan (under which the
expatriate-dominated Interim Governing Council would choose a third of
the electoral college in each province).

In the above-cited article, Wong maintains that Sistani only pressed
for the open elections after being privately assured that they were
feasible by UN figures behind the scenes. This tidbit of information
accords with my own view, that Sistani's appeal to the UN is not so much
a request for help as a demand that it do the right thing. Kofi Annan
will decide in the next couple of days whether and when to send an
election feasibility commission to Iraq. He has a two-man team on the
ground now.

Meanwhile, Rory McCarthy reports from Baghdad for the Guardian that a
council of (fundamentalist) Sunni clerics has denounced the plan to hold
elections, saying that Sunnis would boycott them if held under Coalition
auspices. This rejectionist stance seems unlikely to be widely shared
among Iraqi Sunnis, most of whom are nationalists rather than religious
fundamentalists. If they did boycott the elections, they would just
increase Shiite dominance. (It would be a mirror image of what happened
in the recent elections in Bahrain, a Shiite-majority country where the
Shiites boycotted the elections and allowed Sunni fundamentalists to
dominate parliament.)
