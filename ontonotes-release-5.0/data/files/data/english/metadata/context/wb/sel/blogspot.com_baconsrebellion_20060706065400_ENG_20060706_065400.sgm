Bad Planning Tricks

In case you missed the headline's wordplay on "Bad Pet Tricks," let
me hammer it home. Many shopping center developers are one-trick ponies.
They know how to do one thing -- plop a long, one-story building in the
middle of a big parking lot -- and they do it over and over. Sometimes,
they seem so bored by it all that they don't even do that one trick very
well.

Waldo Jaquith has a great example in his critique (with photos) of a
new shopping center going up off U.S. 29 north of Charlottesville. The
shopping center has moved enormous quantities of dirt in order to
elevate itself from the main drag. The interesting result is that,
between the escarpment separating the road and shopping center, and the
vast parking lot that pushes the buildings away from the road, it is
nearly impossible for motorists to even see what's in the shopping
center! What merchant would want to locate a store there?

Was any body in the developer's office paying attention here?

Waldo also offers some sound observations on the importance of
streetscapes and the decline of Albemarle County's inner ring of
suburban development. Go get 'em, Waldo!

I doubt if they moved all that dirt for nothing. I'd be willing to
bet that it had something to do with required drainage standards.

"...planning guidelines should be modified to encourage — or better
yet, require — such developments to conform...."

Whatever happened to reducing regulations so that merchants and
developers could build what the market deems most valuable?

Why are such lousy developments inevitably going to mean the
destruction of the inner circle?

I'm sure it did. But I suspect that's got more to do with making the
whole affair level than raising the thing up 10' in the air.

developers could build what the market deems most valuable?

Nothing happened -- I never believed that. :)

Why are such lousy developments inevitably going to mean the
destruction of the inner circle?

Not lousy developments -- these developments. It's because of the
location of Charlottesville's growing population and the existing state
of those shopping centers.

This is inside baseball, but the Albemarle Square shopping center is
already on its way out. Their anchor is a gym. Most of their storefronts
are cheap, and there are always a few that are empty. Barracks Road
Shopping Center was on a serious decline about five years ago, so they
aggressively courted some hipper retail outlets and spent a great deal
of money on promotion. It's worked, briefly.

On top of all of this, a great deal of Albemarle County's population
growth is coming in suburban developments on 29N. For those people,
Barracks Road and Albemarle Square are too far away, if not in miles
than in traffic lights and delays. They'll stay out in the suburbs and
not bother to venture into town, where the older shopping centers are
located.

This pattern has been repeated hundreds of times in cities across the
nation. It's a basic part of the suburban/exurban demographic
transition, such as it is.

So you think planners should have regulations that allow them to tell
the developers how to build?

Or is it that you don't believe the builders will build what the
market deems is most valuable?

OK so we have an old central shopping area and it is supported by X
number of people.

Now we have Y new people moving into suburban developments on 29N,
and they want new shopping areas near home.

Why isn't X people still sufficient and properly located to support
the old central area?

Is it because X+Y will support a larger center with more selection?
Is it because now that y is established it can draw from two directions
where X could draw from only one?

The problem is that Charlottesville is on the verge of overbuilding
shopping centers. Right now we have about the right number, in terms of
square feet, to be supported by the region. The four new shopping
centers going in are gambling on a) major population increases in the
next decade immediately around their locations and b) their stores being
more attractive than the existing stores.

Charlottesville is an urban area in a rural sea. We draw people from
a tremendous area. Building a new shopping center farther north or south
on 29, or farther east or west on 250/64 serves those individuals that
live farther out in Central Virginia, so they never get into the
suburban core to those existing stores. That's the bet of these new
shopping center developers, anyhow.

And so those shopping centers within Charlottesville, created on the
premise that people will patronize it from an area of several thousand
square miles, will wither when their supply of traffic gets cut off by
the new shopping centers located five minutes farther from town along
one of the major corridors.

And so the suburban ring moves ever farther out. Again, we've seen
this pattern repeated hundreds of times across the nation. This isn't
anything novel, I'm afraid.

<POSTER> Ray Hyde </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> ????-??-??T19:04:00 </POSTDATE>
Exactly. We agree on what is happening.

1. People near the new centers have no incentive to enjoy the traffic
lights and delays to get down town.

2. People farther out get shortstopped by the new centers that are
closer to them.

3. People downtown drive out to the new centers because they are more
attractive, larger, more variety, cheaper. (Ten feet up in the air?, Oh
Well, no accounting for taste.)

This brings us to the last statement which I will paraphrase as "The
suburban ring moves ever further out, I'm afraid."

Why are you afraid? Is it a given that this is a "bad" process? A lot
of people think it is but where is the evidence? Based on what we've
said here, everyone gets a new and better shopping center that is closer
to where they live, except the people downtown, and they now have more
choices. What is wrong with that?

OK, we ate up some land, but as you point out, Charlottesville is an
urban area in a rural sea. And there are more people living there. Who
will volunteer to give up on children?

Why is it a problem that Charlottesville is overbuilding shopping
centers? The bad or poorly located ones will fail and they will be
redeveloped as something else, meanwhile we can skateboard where it
won't bother anybody. They made an investment decision that worked for a
long time, and then conditions changed. The best and most convenient
ones will succeed. (That might not be the same as the nicest looking
ones.)

Let's assume that it is a given that these three items ARE in fact
bad and that we can somehow measure the badness, and put a price on it.
What would we do then?

By fiat, we could say, nope no more shopping centers, everyone has to
go downtown and fight the traffic lights and delays to buy anything.
Those "speculators" who might have been interested in doing that can go
elsewhere, and they probably will. That badness has a price, too.

We could draw a ring around the city and say, no building outside
this line. How will we mollify the people on the other side of the line?
How do you justify that instantaneous transfer of wealth?

It is one thing if your community or shopping center or home gets old
and decrepit with age, we expect this. It is something else entirely for
the government to establish two classes of people. We just spent the
last hundred years trying to undo that problem, now we are going to
start over based on geography instead of color? So, you could pay those
people outside the line to mollify them, or you could pay the people
inside the line so they wont object to the smaller lots and the traffic
lights and delays. Either way, that badness has a price, too.

You could say, no more shopping malls. We are going to have hundreds
and hundreds of small shops and put them on every corner and under our
homes like Boston's Old North End. We all know the convenience store is
more expensive and lacks a little in variety, so there is price topay
for this idea, too.

So, I don't think the new malls are a bad thing, ineffective, or
overly expensive, or that they will cause the demise of our society,
obesity, poor helath and loneliness.

I just think it is too bad they are ugly. We should put the park back
in parking lots.

Just a few random thoughts.

Barracks Road Shopping Center is currently more upscale and busier -
in fact, thriving actively - than it was twenty some years ago when I
was going to school in C'ville.

It is not declining, and it seems quite unlikely to decline, because
many of the folks going to it are coming down Garth Road/Barracks Road
from the other direction. Those are not cheap houses or developments out
that way.

I don't recall it being in a serious decline five years ago, either,
as it was still a heck of alot nicer then than when I lived in C'ville
in the 80's.

Every time I go to BRSS with my various friends and family who live
nearby, the place is jammed full of people spending large amounts of
money.

A good smattering of the people I know who shop there are well-to-do
retired folks and independently wealthy yuppies who live nearby. A lot
more than students shop and eat there.

Albemarle Square is IMHO not a very nice shopping center. I remember
when it was the only choice. I enjoy shopping in C'ville a whole lot
more now than I did then. Back in the 80's, we shopped in DC and
Richmond. Now, when I visit, I enjoy shopping in town.

As far as the new mall goes - many, many people are living between
C'ville and Fredericksburg or between C'ville and Culpeper. Many of the
folks in Albemarle County have little mini estates with horses and such
- and those who can't afford one close in go to the outlying counties.
If a shopping mall is further out, more people who were previously
driving to Culpeper and Fredericksburg will drive to the areas outlying
Charlottesville.

It may be a zero sum game, but Barracks Road Shopping Center is not
withering and is unlikely to wither. It's more likely IMHO that Central
Park Shopping Center in F'burg will be affected, and perhaps Culpeper.

Because we end up with urban decay -- huge swaths of empty real
estate, which often presages dying downtowns. Just look at Lynchburg,
even big swaths of Roanoke and Lynchburg. That means that development is
far less compact, making mass transit infeasible and increasing reliance
on automobiles.

Compact, urban development is better than sprawled suburban
development by just about any metric.

I don't recall it being in a serious decline five years ago, either,
as it was still a heck of alot nicer then than when I lived in C'ville
in the 80's.

Two separate friends own two separate stores in Barracks Road, and I
heard all about the troubles in 2000-2001. It was not a decline in the
sense of many dying shopping malls, but things were not looking good for
them. You'll remember they had three grocery stores (followed by two
grocery stores and a huge empty space) and B&amp;N was the closest thing
to an anchor. Clearly things have picked up since then, but there's no
telling whether that will continue to be so.

I'm still not sure who is really getting served if the infrastructure
costs get counted all the way from development, to a period of
decline/vaccancy, to redevlopment. The public spends a lot to keep the
market model Ray explains so cogently greased and rolling.

Waldo, think for a sec. Independent retail stores often have
problems. Retail is a tough, tough business. A certain percentage of
failure is normal and expected.

The grocery stores at BRSS have gone in and out multiple times over
the past couple of decades - most strip-style malls do not support more
than one grocery store. This is also not a sign of decline. I can't,
offhand, think of a Richmond strip mall that supports even 2 grocery
stores, much less 3.

I'm genuinely puzzled as to your identification as B&amp;N as the
closest thing to an anchor, as a number of the stores have been there
since I was in college, nearly 30 years ago. This is a dynamic and
thriving mall with a large number of upscale stores that draws from a
large area. I know people (including myself) who make a point of
shopping there instead of Richmond.

There is no reason to think that the mall will not continue to thrive
and prosper. Again, it is a lot nicer, has more stores, and is FAR more
upscale than it was nearly 30 years ago. I've seen it since the late
70's - and it's grown and prospered, not declined.

How many strip malls are currently in better shape, more upscale, and
more popular than they were 30 years ago?

Success of the mall is not, however, a guarantee for any individual
store to succeed.

Out of curiosity, where exactly in C'ville is there urban decay and
swaths of empty land? Seems to me, from the areas I've visited, it's
stuffed to bursting.

Downtown is so stuffed, they're talking about putting in 9 story
buildings near the downtown mall. The city and county populations have
just exploded, and the population of surrounding rural counties has
grown even faster.

Those folks have to shop somewhere. If you'd seen it in the late
70's, when I first arrived in C'ville, I bet you'd have a bit less
nostalgia. Having to drive 60 miles to buy stuff isn't quaint when
you're actually living it. Having some selection and a choice of stores
nearby is a blessing, not urban blight.

The public doesn't spend to keep the market model rolling. That's the
beauty of it.

The investors take a chance on it. It either pays for itself, or it
fails.

Public investment in infrastructure is sometimes a good argument.
However, it's used a whole lot more than it actually applies.

If a building is taken from one use, revitalized, and put to another
use, I don't see any new investment in public infrastructure. This mall
is not in central C'ville - it's one strip mall in a sea of other strip
malls, most of them doing pretty well.

The airport already had roads prior to the new mall. The new mall is
very likely to bring in business that otherwise might well have siphoned
off to Culpeper and Fredericksburg - meaning Albemarle gets more tax
dollars.

"Compact, urban development is better than sprawled suburban

Okay, I'll bite. Why?

I see that accepted here as a truism all the time, without question.
The bottom line is, most people live in the suburbs for good reasons.

Safer

Better schools

Your own yard where your kids can play safely and you can watch them

Easier to get to the things that you actually want and need to do,
which really do require driving

Walking everywhere is good in theory. It works well when you're a
student and have few responsibilities. It does not work well to take
Janie and her team to soccer practice, or Maggie to dance lessons, or to
buy groceries for a family for a week, or when it's very hot, or when
it's raining, or when it gets dark early, or .....

I get very concerned here when I see happy urbanites not content to
be happy in their urbanism, or even to try to encourage others to see
what they like in it, but rather determined to actively force it on the
unwilling. Yikes.

Anonymous 8:47, Which is safer -- the city or the suburbs? Most
people would say the suburbs are safer. The city has higher rates of
violent crime. And that's true. But is crime the only component of being
"safe"? If the concept of safety also includes the likelihood of being
injured or killed in an automobile accident, the city is safer.

As for schools, the fact that suburban schools tend to be better than
city schools has nothing to do with the pattern of development. It
merely reflects the fact that the poorest, most ill-educated sectors of
the metropolitan population happen to reside in the cities for largely
historical reasons.

Big yards for kids to play. OK, you got me there. Suburbs do have
bigger yards. Sometimes, you even see kids playing in them. Although
most of the time, kids' lives are getting so structured that they are
usually carted from soccer to baseball to the swimming pool, and when
they're home they spend most of the time inside. So, the putative
advantage of the Big Yard is less than meets the eye.

Easier to get to thinks you want and need... I guess it depends upon
what you want and need. Yeah, it's easier to get to the movie theater
and the Wal-Mart in the 'burbs. But in the city, it's easier to get to
museums, art shows, concerts, street festivals and other cultural
events.

And I speak as one who has lived in a nice suburban community for
four years.

I see I've started a storm here.

"Compact, urban development is better than sprawled suburban
development by just about any metric."

Waldo, I *think* I agree with you. but I'm a scientist, and so when I
see an experiment has the same result, over and over (as you have
pointed out), then I have to ask why that is. Repeatable events usually
have a reason behind them. If compact urban development is really
better, then why doesn't it happen and sustain on its own?

Simply claiming that it is better won't make it happen, and if we
falsely claim it is better, as I believe EMR and others are prone to do,
then we are just kidding ourselves.

If we put a culture on an agar plate, we see the same result: it
spreads out from the center nad then dies in the middle. Maybe we are
not so diferent from amoeba.

In the natural world such events are ALWAYS driven by an attempt to
reach a lower energy state. Lower energy states are asoociated with
greater disorder. Urban areas are highly ordered and require a lot of
energy. In the human world energy and money are more or less
interchangeable.

Suppose we decide it is better and we choose to make it the way some
think it "should" be. We need to recognize that we are promoting a
higher enegy state. As such it is a Sysiphean task that will require
continuous effort to maintain, and we should understand, and understand
accurately, what that will require. Just fixing urban schools is a huge
task.

Maybe, when we understand what that costs, we decide it isn't worth
it after all, and the forces that cause the current situation are
already the low energy solution: we don't save enough by creating an
urban atmosphere to make it worthwhile.

We hear a lot about sustainability. One bottom line definition is
that each area would have to be able to exist based solely on the energy
that falls on it. (We can extend that somewhat by importing wind, solar,
and hydropower from other areas.) If that was the case, no city could
exist. At best, we could have thousands of hamlets surrounded by open
spaces covered with equipment to supply them.

I think there are plenty of wrong assumptions to go around on both
sides of this. Bacon would argue with Anon 8:47 that suburbs are not
safer, based on auto accident rates. On the other hand average longevity
in the suburbs is much higher.

But what really raises my hackles is what anon 8:47 points out, that
more and more we are willing to force a certain outcome on the
unwilling, as in your suggestion that we require the developers to
conform. Even worse, we are frequently forcing a result on them at THEIR
expense and then claiming the "savings" as a community benefit.

New Ubanism.org maintains a website that has a list of actions it
believes we should take immediately:

1)An immediate and permanent moratorium on road construction.

2)An immediate and permanet moratorium on airport construction

3)Mandatory tripling of the CAFE standards

4)Huge increases of amtrak funding and train service to every
community and neighborhood.

5)mandatory moratorium on sprawl

6) immediate installation of full roof solar panels on every building
in America

Etc. Etc.

Aside from being wholly impractical, uneconomic and probably wasteful
of energy, such suggestions would mean that we no longer live in
America. Some would say these people are dangerous. At the very least,
if they seriously want to promote these goals, then they need much
better PR and much better arguments.

New Urbanism has its roots in the failed communal utopias of the
past. It supporters will say that planning works: it just hasn't been
fully implemented yet. And yet we have just spent our adult lives
watching the most highly planned societies fail.

New Urbanism uses many environmental arguments to support their
positions. I'm not convinced that all of them are correct arguments, and
some of them appear to be a smoke screen for their real agendas.

Yet, their ideas might prove to be correct, someday. If so, it will
take hundreds of years and billions of dolars to implement, and we still
have to deal with our current problems and our current lives to live in
the meantime.

Businesses evaluate this as a matter of probable cost. What is the
probablility that you need to go to WalMart today for inexpensive
toothpaste and other daily items? What is the probability that you need
to go to a museum? Now take the cost of each trip and multiply them by
the probability. Sum the costs over several years and then decide what
the optimum location is.

Safety is the same kind of evaluation. I'm not sure cities are safer
over all: the average life span is lower there. If you have an auto
accident, well, you made your choice as to how to travel and you knew
the risks. If you get mugged, that is a situation that is imposed on
you. Most people have an instinctive and visceral reaction against being
imposed upon. Hence the objection voiced by anonymous 8:47, and the
obvious problems with the proposals listed by New Urbanism.Org and
Waldo's suggestion that we impose regulations on developers.

Ray said, "If you have an auto accident, well, you made your choice

situation that is imposed on you."

I could easily turn your logic around: If you get mugged, you knew
the risks before you walked down the street. If you have an auto
accident, you have no control over some other driver who slams into the
side of your car.

<POSTER> Ray Hyde </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> ????-??-??T11:39:00 </POSTDATE>
Touche. I thought of that, too.

There are some auto accidents that are not accidents at all, but the
unintended result of actions deliberately taken. If you get involved in
one of those, then you have the right to be thoroughly ticked off, just
as you would be if you were mugged.

In such a case, you can probably sue and get compensation, even if it
winds up coming from your own insurance company through uninsured driver
coverage. If you get mugged, good luck.

There is an element of randomness in both cases, but randomness we
can tolerate, premeditation we can't. In a situation of high density
population you increase the risk that you will confront someone with
premeditated antisocial tendencies. If you have a thousand neighbors vs
two, then there is a greater likeliehood one of them will be on the
sexual predators list.

Many people are not willing to pay higher rents and higher taxes for
that privilege.

I have been mugged, and the injuries I sustained were a couple of
weeks of bruised ribs. Call it the equivalent of a fifteen mile an hour
bicycle crash as far as injuries go. But the sense of physical violation
and emotional upset was huge. All I wanted was to get even. I never felt
that way towards my bike.

Ray, I will concede that getting mugged carries a lot more emotional
wallop than getting rear-ended. Undoubtedly, that's why tVs and
newspapers give so much more weight to their coverage of murders than
car fatalities.

OK Waldo, try this one on for size.

If everyone started out perfectly sprawled (meaning the earth was
divided per capita with each person being as spread out as possible), we
would gather to denser areas, forming cities. This is why cities grow.
This means that immigrants come to cities, which often means they see
better economies of scale, which means they usually come from more
sprawled out areas! Even without immigration from foreign countries,
cities would still be growing by more than the birth rate. This has been
witnessed by the phenomenon of small towns disappearing as its citizens
move to larger cities. This means that the city growth which is
frequently criticized by is actually the result of a reduction in
sprawl.

That is not the same as saying that the peripheries of our cities
won't continue to expand. What you see depend on where you are standing
and which way you look.

Jim Bacon is correct in saying that more of this would occur without
the regulations that prevent it. We need less regulation, not more. If
you don't believe it, consider Denver and Portland. Under Portland's
strict land use regulations urban density declined 6% in a decade while
Denver's increased 16% with no smart growth initiatives.

The above argument is taken and adapted from Casey Hayes, a student
of Urban Economics at the University of colorado.

The problem with region to region comparisons on Portland's density
is that the key growth management tool isn't inclusive of the whole MSA.
If you look at studies of land inside the Portland UGB over time density
increased.

If I remember correctly, that is not exactly correct. I'm assuming
you're referring to Lucy's work.

If you compare only stranger homicides and deaths (not injuries) by
car, that is correct.

Lucy did not include all homicides. Other crimes were not included at
all. Your chances of getting raped, mugged, assaulted, or robbed are far
higher in the city.

I'm not clear on how car deaths were measured - were they ONLY people
who actually LIVED in that county, or deaths by car in that county? The
actual metric is important here as many rural counties have interstates
running through them. It's not an accurate measure of risk if you're
counting vacationers from NJ who get rear ended by a semi.

Also, the comparisons were not apples to apples, if one thinks about
it just a second. The study does not attempt to measure, is John Doe
safer in the city or the county?

The study looks at all of the people already in the city, and all of
the people in the county. I strongly suspect they are not an apples to
apples comparison.

People are interested in, will _I_ be safer in the suburbs than in
the city?

Not, will elderly retired people living in a fixed income in a city
apartment be safer than a farmer driving a haytruck.

Answering where I would be safer is a different study, and I suspect
you would get rather different results.

"So, the putative advantage of the Big Yard is less than meets the
eye."

A kid with a big yard, even with a very scheduled day, is going to be
able to play outside more than a kid with the same schedule who has to
wait til his parents have free time to walk him down to the park.

"Yeah, it's easier to get to the movie theater and the Wal-Mart in
the 'burbs. But in the city, it's easier to get to museums, art shows,
concerts, street festivals and other cultural events."

That's all well and good. It's easier to get to the grocery store in
the suburbs, and to get those groceries back into the house. Most
families go to the grocery store a couple of times a week.

It's easier to get the kids to lessons and practices in the suburbs.
Multiply the number of kids by the number of times per week.

It's easier to get the dog to the vet in the suburbs.

All of those mundane, day to day necessities are actually easier.
With today's ultra busy schedules, easier is important.

I love museums and events, but I don't go to them all that often. I
don't have time. I'd have even less time for them if I was having to
carry groceries back and forth from the store one bag at a time. I'd
wear a path between my house and the grocery store.

Neaed is correct, there are differences in how things are measured.

So what if inside the UGB becme more dense? You are measuring a
different thing. Most places are becoming more dense. It is just that
the outer areas are getting both more dense and larger, which is an
impossible condition for the ineer areas.

What this shows is that despite the difficult and extra expense,
distance, etc. more people still chose to defy the key growth management
tool by going someplace else. Not only did the tool fail, but people
repudiated it at the polls through measure 37.

Inside the UGB also became less affordable, and there is a dearth of
children in the area.

But Ray aren't you assuming the UGB never moves? It does. Also, most
of the growth outside the UGB was beyond Oregon's reach in WA state,
which actually adopted its own growth management system in the 90's. Of
course that may have been the "safety valve" that allowed the syatem to
work as long as it did. And let's not overlook that preserving an
economically viable ag industry, not density, was (at least intially)
the driving force behind the adoption of growth management in Oregon.

You're right about children, but a little incomplete on housing.
While housing costs certainly jumped why blame supply constraints alone?
How about demand? The market was undervalued when the region's economy
was hanging low in the 80's and all of a sudden population and jobs
growth skyrockted in the 90's. Demand has been linked to Portland's
price spike in a number of studies. Read Tony Downs "Growth Managenment
and Affordabile Housing" (2004), parituclalry the chapter by Nelson et
al, and Connie Ozawa's "The Portland Edge" (2004), particualrly the
chapters by Howe on housing costs (and by Chapman and Lund on density).

And I can't say much about M37 except the planners missed the boat on
the politics. That outcome was all about messages and the planners
overlooking the fact that there was a new electorate who had no idea who
Tom McCall as the population had more than doubled since all the growth
management stuff was enacted.

Isn't that exactly what I said? If the UGB is going to move anyway,
what is the point, except to benefit some at the expense of many?
managing the location of growth *may* provide some cost savings by
avoiding providing infrastructure all over creation. But that "savings"
comes at the expense of and is really rented from those outside the
growth bondary because their land is held in abeyance for future growth
when the UGB moves.

But the UGB is designed for 20 years, and when it does move it is a
huge political football. It is probably cheaper and more efficient to
just let the growth happen where it can: where people need to sell and
want to buy. The UGB isn't getting you anything but grief.

The planners definitely missed the boat if they couldn't figure out
that the population doubled. And the previously existing population was
getting older, so their plans were simple going away, lost in the
bureaucratic shuffle and conservation takings.

Unlike Virginia, Oregon had a real Ag economy and still does. But
part of the problem they had was similar to here: prime farmland was
declared that was not farmable or became unfarmable over time, but the
rules didn't adapt. And, yes, Washington has growth controls, but they
are not statewide as in Oregon - and they have their own initiative
coming up to mimic measure 37.

I'm aware of the studies you cite, but there is controversy. If you
compare the affordability, the amount of payment you can make on the
average income compared to the cost of the average home, then it doesn't
look so good. By that measurement the demand caused by employment should
have made homes more affordable, but it didn't happen.

All of which just points out the difficulty of measuring what it is
we *think* we are doing. If we cannot measure and agree on the success
of a policy, what is the point of having it? How do we know if our
policy succeeds.

I'd suggest that a dearth of children in Portland is pretty strong
evidence that the plan is not working, at least not now. Maybe it will
someday as conditions change again, but that won't prove the policy is a
success, just that conditions changed.

I would suggest with more people inside the UGB than without, you
should reverse the direction in your second sentence. Especially given
the passage of M5 capping property taxes just before the price spike in
the 90s created a huge benefit for existing property owners.

I would suggest that however you've worn me out. I take it all back.

I do see what you mean. The many inside the UGB would otherwise be
paying for the dispersed infrastructure (sooner).

But we don't really know, first of all, that the compact
infrastructure really saves anything, and the evidence seems to be that
it doesn't. Urban areas are more expensive and have higher taxes, but if
the argument was true, it would be the reverse. As I noted, at least
some of the savings is really rented (usually at no cost, whichis what
measure 37 was about).

Secondly, all that bureaucracy has costs of its own. I'm not
convinced that in the end there is any benefit other than preserving
open space. That might be, and probably is, enough reason. What we need
to do now is figure out what that costs, what it is worth, and how to
pay for it.

I think it is better to attack the problem directly than to create a
bogus rationale for doing something else that is enormously complicated
and expensive, and which evidently isn't working. <
