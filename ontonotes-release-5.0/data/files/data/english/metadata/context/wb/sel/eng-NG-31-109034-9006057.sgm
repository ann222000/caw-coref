German police cadets in training in Berlin reportedly responded to a
talk on anti-Semitism by saying they were bored hearing about the
Holocaust. The incident is under investigation, Deutsche Welle
reported. The police academy recruits allegedly also said that Jews
are known to be rich.

Cadets Sent to Concentration Camps

Spokesperson for the police academy said that the class that was
involved in the incident was required to be taken on tours of
Ziekenhuizen concentration camp in Germany.

What Can You Say

Germany was lead to the slaughter, and decimated,  in WW-1 and WW-2.
Their empire, their culture, their history was all destroyed, and they
have paid over $100 billion just in Jewish reparations.     Now police
cadets are forced to listen to some 83 yr old Flea Bag lecture them on
his imaginary events.

The Story Of The Buchenwald
http://judicial-inc.biz/buch.enwald.htm

&quot;In the camp there was a cage with a bear and an eagle, and every day,
they would throw a Jew in there. The bear would tear him apart and the
eagle would pick at his bones.&quot;

&quot;But that's unbelievable,&quot; whispered a visitor.

&quot;It is unbelievable,&quot; said Mr. Hubert, &quot;but it happened.&quot;

Eisenhower's Death Camps: A U.S. Prison Guard's Story

http://www.iamthewitness.com/img/Death_Camp_for_dumb_Krauts.JPG

By Martin Brech

In October, 1944, at age eighteen, I was drafted into the U.S. army.
Largely because of the &quot;Battle of the Bulge,&quot; my training was cut
short. My furlough was halved, and I was sent overseas immediately.
Upon arrival in Le Havre, France, we were quickly loaded into box cars
and shipped to the front. When we got there, I was suffering
increasingly severe symptoms of mononucleosis, and was sent to a
hospital in Belgium. Since mononucleosis was then known as the
&quot;kissing disease,&quot; I mailed a letter of thanks to my girlfriend.

By the time I left the hospital, the outfit I had trained with in
Spartanburg, South Carolina was deep inside Germany, so, despite my
protests, I was placed in a &quot;repo depot&quot; (replacement depot). I lost
interest in the units to which I was assigned and don't recall all of
them: non-combat units were ridiculed at that time. My separation
qualification record states I was mostly with Company C, 14th Infantry
Regiment, during my seventeen-month stay in Germany, but I remember
being transferred to other outfits also.

In late March or early April, 1945, I was sent to guard a POW camp
near Andernach along the Rhine. I had four years of high school
German, so I was able to talk to the prisoners, although this was
forbidden. Gradually, however, I was used as an interpreter and asked
to ferret out members of the S.S. (I found none.)

camps_1.jpg - 56,53 K

In Andernach about 50,000 prisoners of all ages were held in an open
field surrounded by barbed wire. The women were kept in a separate
enclosure I did not see until later. The men I guarded had no shelter
and no blankets; many had no coats. They slept in the mud, wet and
cold, with inadequate slit trenches for excrement. It was a cold, wet
spring and their misery from exposure alone was evident.

Even more shocking was to see the prisoners throwing grass and weeds
into a tin can containing a thin soup. They told me they did this to
help ease their hunger pains. Quickly, they grew emaciated. Dysentery
raged, and soon they were sleeping in their own excrement, too weak
and crowded to reach the slit trenches. Many were begging for food,
sickening and dying before our eyes. We had ample food and supplies,
but did nothing to help them, including no medical assistance.

Outraged, I protested to my officers and was met with hostility or
bland indifference. When pressed, they explained they were under
strict orders from &quot;higher up.&quot; No officer would dare do this to
50,000 men if he felt that it was &quot;out of line,&quot; leaving him open to
charges. Realizing my protests were useless, I asked a friend working
in the kitchen if he could slip me some extra food for the prisoners.
He too said they were under strict orders to severely ration the
prisoners' food and that these orders came from &quot;higher up.&quot; But he
said they had more food than they knew what to do with and would sneak
me some.

When I threw this food over the barbed wire to the prisoners, I was
caught and threatened with imprisonment. I repeated the &quot;offense,&quot; and
one officer angrily threatened to shoot me. I assumed this was a bluff
until I encountered a captain on a hill above the Rhine shooting down
at a group of German civilian women with his .45 caliber pistol. When
I asked, Why?,&quot; he mumbled, &quot;Target practice,&quot; and fired until his
pistol was empty. I saw the women running for cover, but, at that
distance, couldn't tell if any had been hit.

This is when I realized I was dealing with cold-blooded killers filled
with moralistic hatred. They considered the Germans subhuman and
worthy of extermination; another expression of the downward spiral of
racism. Articles in the G.I. newspaper, Stars and Stripes, played up
the German concentration camps, complete with photos of emaciated
bodies; this amplified our self-righteous cruelty and made it easier
to imitate behavior we were supposed to oppose. Also, I think,
soldiers not exposed to combat were trying to prove how tough they
were by taking it out on the prisoners and civilians.

These prisoners, I found out, were mostly farmers and workingmen, as
simple and ignorant as many of our own troops. As time went on, more
of them lapsed into a zombie-like state of listlessness, while others
tried to escape in a demented or suicidal fashion, running through
open fields in broad daylight towards the Rhine to quench their
thirst. They were mowed down. Some prisoners were as eager for
cigarettes as for food, saying they took the edge off their hunger.
Accordingly, enterprising G.I. &quot;Yankee traders&quot; were acquiring hordes
of watches and rings in exchange for handfuls of cigarettes or less.
When I began throwing cartons of cigarettes to the prisoners to ruin
this trade, I was threatened by rank-and-file G.I.s too.

The only bright spot in this gloomy picture came one night when I was
put on the &quot;graveyard shift,&quot; from two to four A.M. Actually, there
was a graveyard on the uphill side of this enclosure, not many yards
away. My superiors had forgotten to give me a flashlight and I hadn't
bothered to ask for one, disgusted as I was with the whole situation
by that time. It was a fairly bright night and I soon became aware of
a prisoner crawling under the wires towards the graveyard. We were
supposed to shoot escapees on sight, so I started to get up from the
ground to warn him to get back. Suddenly I noticed another prisoner
crawling from the graveyard back to the enclosure. They were risking
their lives to get to the graveyard for something; I had to
investigate.

When I entered the gloom of this shrubby, tree-shaded cemetery, I felt
completely vulnerable, but somehow curiosity kept me moving. Despite
my caution, I tripped over the legs of someone in a prone position.
Whipping my rifle around while stumbling and trying to regain
composure of mind and body, I soon was relieved I hadn't reflexively
fired. The figure sat up. Gradually, I could see the beautiful but
terror-stricken face of a woman with a picnic basket nearby. German
civilians were not allowed to feed, nor even come near the prisoners,
so I quickly assured her I approved of what she was doing, not to be
afraid, and that I would leave the graveyard to get out of the way.

I did so immediately and sat down, leaning against a tree at the edge
of the cemetery to be inconspicuous and not frighten the prisoners. I
imagined then, and still do now, what it would be like to meet a
beautiful woman with a picnic basket, under those conditions as a
prisoner. I have never forgotten her face.

Eventually, more prisoners crawled back to the enclosure. I saw they
were dragging food to their comrades and could only admire their
courage and devotion.

On May 8, V.E. Day, I decided to celebrate with some prisoners I was
guarding who were baking bread the other prisoners occasionally
received. This group had all the bread they could eat, and shared the
jovial mood generated by the end of the war. We all thought we were
going home soon, a pathetic hope on their part. We were in what was to
become the French zone, where I soon would witness the brutality of
the French soldiers when we transferred our prisoners to them for
their slave labor camps. On this day, however, we were happy.

As a gesture of friendliness, I emptied my rifle and stood it in the
corner, even allowing them to play with it at their request! This
thoroughly &quot;broke the ice,&quot; and soon we were singing songs we taught
each other or I had learned in high school German (&quot;Du, du liegst mir
im Herzen&quot;). Out of gratitude, they baked me a special small loaf of
sweet bread, the only possible present they had left to offer. I
stuffed it in my &quot;Eisenhower jacket&quot; and snuck it back to my barracks,
eating it when I had privacy. I have never tasted more delicious
bread, nor felt a deeper sense of communion while eating it. I believe
a cosmic sense of Christ (the Oneness of all Being) revealed its
normally hidden presence to me on that occasion, influencing my later
decision to major in philosophy and religion.

Shortly afterwards, some of our weak and sickly prisoners were marched
off by French soldiers to their camp. We were riding on a truck behind
this column. Temporarily, it slowed down and dropped back, perhaps
because the driver was as shocked as I was. Whenever a German prisoner
staggered or dropped back, he was hit on the head with a club until he
died. The bodies were rolled to the side of the road to be picked up
by another truck. For many, this quick death might have been
preferable to slow starvation in our &quot;killing fields.&quot;

When I finally saw the German women in a separate enclosure, I asked
why we were holding them prisoner. I was told they were &quot;camp
followers,&quot; selected as breeding stock for the S.S. to create a super-
race. I spoke to some and must say I never met a more spirited or
attractive group of women. I certainly didn't think they deserved
imprisonment.

I was used increasingly as an interpreter, and was able to prevent
some particularly unfortunate arrests. One rather amusing incident
involved an old farmer who was being dragged away by several M.P's. I
was told he had a &quot;fancy Nazi medal,&quot; which they showed me.
Fortunately, I had a chart identifying such medals. He'd been awarded
it for having five children! Perhaps his wife was somewhat relieved to
get him &quot;off her back,&quot; but I didn't think one of our death camps was
a fair punishment for his contribution to Germany. The M.P.s agreed
and released him to continue his &quot;dirty work.&quot;

Famine began to spread among the German civilians also. It was a
common sight to see German women up to their elbows in our garbage
cans looking for something edible -- that is, if they weren't chased
away.

There is an old saying if one is lying often enough people will believe in
it. The holocaust industry works the same way. And this is if the repeat it
often enough it must be true. No wonder they are in control of most of the
news medias.

Remarkable Nonsense about the Holocaust
http://www.historiography-project.org/nonsense/nonsense.html

Extermination by pruning - &quot;Several Soviet prisoners would be forced
to climb a tree and others had to saw it down. The prisoners would
fall together with the tree and be killed.&quot;

Pits of Boiling Human Fat - &quot;a pit near the crematorium that was full
of boiling human fat. At that time, the corpses were incinerated in
open air pits, from which the fat flowed into a separate reservoir,
dug in the ground. This fat was poured over the corpses to accelerate
their combustion. This poor devil was pulled out of the fat still
alive and then shot.&quot;

Nazi use of atomic weapons to kill Jews at Auschwitz - &quot;A village, a
small village, was provisionally erected, with temporary structures,
and in it approximately 20,000 Jews were put. By means of this newly
invented weapon of destruction, these 20,000 people were eradicated
almost instantaneously, and in such a way that there was no trace ...&quot;

Human thumb light switches - &quot;She [Ilse Koch] was a very beautiful
woman with long red hair, but any prisoner who was caught looking at
her could be shot,&quot; recalled Kurt Glass, a former inmate who worked as
a gardener at the Koch family villa. &quot;She got the idea she would like
lamp shades made of human skin, and one day on the Appelplatz we were
all ordered to strip to the waist. The ones who had interesting tatoos
were brought to her, and she picked out the ones she liked. Those
people were killed and their skin was made into lampshades for her.
She also used mummified human thumbs as light switches in her house.&quot;

Tearing Babies in Half - &quot;The witness was present in the room when an
SS man entered and demanded from a mother the one-year-old infant she
was holding in her arms. She refused to surrender it, so he seized the
baby by its ankles and tore the body in two before the mother's eyes.&quot;

How is the story going to be complete if the don't know who organized

Remarkable. Incredible that anyone would believe such nonsense, but that
whole page is full of it.

What's most remarkable to me is that they've actually put that ridiculous
stuff online for anyone to see. I think I'll make a copy of it while it's
still there. Sooner or later some Holocaust promoter with more brains than a
turnip is going to realize it's so silly it undermines the mythology, and
get rid of the page.

10 years ago I read in a book the name of which had to do with
Freemasonry
that there was evidence that the a Rothschild was a visitor in the
Third Reich.

The Nazis were so worried about his security they had a whole SS
company
to escort him safely to Switzerland after the 'Talks&quot;.

I don't have this book and I don't have acces to it. - It was lent to
me by a friend
to read.

Does anyone have any information on this?

Thanks for pointing that out. I missed it the first time around. It is
absolutely the Dutch word for &quot;hospital.&quot; So much for the accuracy of

Now we can see what old Neil is really about.

The author of this piece of trash, Archibald Ramsay, was one of the
most notorious antisemites in Great Britain in the 20th century.

On the second day of World War II (September 4, 1939), Ramsay sat in
the Library of the House of Commons writing a poem which was later to
be printed and distributed by the Right Club. It ran:

Land of dope and Jewry
Land that once was free
All the Jew boys praise thee
Whilst they plunder thee
Poorer still and poorer
Grow thy true-born sons
Faster still and faster
They're sent to feed the guns.
Land of Jewish finance
Fooled by Jewish lies
In press and books and movies
While our birthright dies
Longer still and longer
Is the rope they get
But - by the God of battles
'Twill serve to hang them yet.

[...]

The New York Times published an article on &quot;Britain's Fifth Column&quot; in
July 1940 which claimed &quot;informed American sources said that he had
sent to the German Legation in Dublin treasonable information given to
him by Tyler Kent&quot;. Ramsay sued for libel, resulting in a trial in
July 1941 in which he asserted his loyalty to Britain. However some of
Ramsay's answers did him extreme damage, for example when he was asked
if he wanted Nazism to be defeated, and replied, substituting
'Germany' for 'Nazism': &quot;Not only Germany, but also the Judaic
menace&quot;. In summing-up the Judge said he was convinced Hitler would
call Ramsay 'friend' and that Ramsay was disloyal in heart and soul to
his King, his Government, and the people.

==================

It tells us a lot about Neil Harrington that he would find the idiotic
Jew conspiracy subject matter of Ramsay's book, &quot;interesting&quot;.

You have to keep in mind that the overall perception at the time it
was
considered all matters Rothschildian to be Jewish. Thanks to the
creation
of Israel and it's use as canon fodder subsequently we now know
better.

When one strips old texts of the irrelevant sentiments you get avery
clear picture of the ruthless international banking Mafia in it's true
form.

How Jewish an occultist family like the Rothschilds can be is
completely
another story. - Practically irrelevant to the subject.

I would imagine they would get tired of Simpson's reruns eventually even though
both are equally humorous. How many times must ancient history be repeated AND
the involuntary audience required to pretend it is just as emotional and moving
in the 34th rerun as it was in the 1st? Having seen much of the English language
crap one has to wonder why there is any interest in maudlin retellings with
lesser production values than a home movie? How many times is the same footage
of the same railroad track supposed to be &quot;sinister&quot; when there is not even
sting music to cue the feeling?

No matter what kind of crap is produced by flaming amateurs it is the fault of
the audience not to give it a standing ovation. It is the fault of the audience
not to be moved by a juvenile presentation of feelings. These faults are
condemned as evidence of antisemitism when it is no more than an appropriate
response to dull and boring material.
