Mass. Republicans favor Romney for president in 2008
By STEVE LeBLANC, Associated Press writer

BOSTON -- Massachusetts Democrats aren't the only ones with Oval
Office dreams these days.
When asked who they would most like to see top the GOP presidential
ticket in 2008, Massachusetts delegates to the Republican National
Convention overwhelmingly named hometown favorite Mitt Romney,
according to a survey conducted by The Associated Press.
They weren't ready to settle for second fiddle either. Only a handful
could picture Romney serving as President Bush's vice president if Dick
Cheney were to step aside.
Two other Republican moderates -- former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani
and Secretary of State Colin Powell -- each won the support of a few
Massachusetts delegates as potential presidential picks in 2008.
Support for a possible Cheney successor was distributed among several
candidates including Romney, Giuliani, Powell, Arizona Sen. John McCain
and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. Bush has voiced strong
support for keeping Cheney on the ticket.
The AP interviewed more than 75 percent of the state's Republican
delegates.
Jody Dow, a delegate from Brookline, said Romney has the political and
business skills needed to be a great president. Romney ran the 2002
Winter Olympics and, from 1990 to 1999, was chief executive of the
venture capital firm Bain Capital.
&quot;He knows how to handle himself. He is poised. He has a good sense of
humor. He has all the things you need to bring people together,&quot; said
Dow, who doesn't want to see Romney replace Cheney.
Massachusetts has seen two recent Republican governors, William Weld
and Paul Cellucci, leave midterm.
&quot;I don't think we want to have that happen again,&quot; she said. &quot;We don't
want him to abandon us.&quot;
Anne-Margaret Gaffney, a delegate from Gloucester, also likes Romney
as a presidential contender in 2008 but would prefer Rice as vice
president if Cheney stepped down.
&quot;I was impressed by the way she handled herself in front of the 9/11
commission,&quot; said Gaffney, deputy finance director for Lt. Gov. Kerry
Healey.
Not every Massachusetts Republican thinks Romney would be the best
candidate in 2008.
Lawrence Novak, a delegate from Brockton, said he would prefer to see
Giuliani top the GOP ticket in 2008.
&quot;It's because of his national standing because of 9/11. I think he's
very sellable nationwide,&quot; Novak said. &quot;I have nothing against Mitt
Romney, but I think Giuliani's shown leadership.&quot;
Romney is pleased with the support, but is an enthusiastic backer of
the Bush/Cheney ticket and is setting his sights on re-election, not
the White House, according to political director Alex Dunn.
&quot;It's nice to know that Massachusetts Republicans think so highly of
Mitt Romney, but he's not going anywhere,&quot; Dunn said. &quot;He's going to
serve out the next two years of his term and the plan is, right now, to
run again.&quot;
Romney has kept his name in the national spotlight since being elected
in 2002. Massachusetts' gay marriage debate gave him a platform to urge
other states not to follow Massachusetts' lead. He has also chaired a
national task force on homeland security and unveiled a national model
for a &quot;scientific&quot; death penalty.
A run for president on the Republican side could pose some hurdles for
Romney, who could be considered too moderate. Romney supports federal
funding for research on new and existing stem cell lines and has said
that while he personally opposes abortion, he would uphold the laws
protecting abortion rights.
Romney has no one but the GOP to blame for those hurdles, according to
Dan Payne, a Democratic political consultant who has worked for John
Kerry in the past.
&quot;Republicans are the ones who have made Massachusetts a dirty word and
Mitt Romney may pay a price for that,&quot; he said.
But Republican analyst Jim Nuzzo said Romney would make a strong GOP
presidential candidate. Romney also has ties to Michigan and Utah and
could portray himself as a national candidate, Nuzzo said.
&quot;It wouldn't surprise me if Mitt, when he knots his ties in the
morning and looks in the mirror, doesn't ... hum the presidential theme
song,&quot; he said.
