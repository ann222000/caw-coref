722180C167063&gt; 1.1 Disruption looms as city staff mull strike

Lindsay Dentlinger, Cape Argus, 4 July 2007
Another crippling strike, which could bring the City of Cape Town to its
knees, is looming as 10 000 South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu)
members contemplate downing tools next month.

They are unhappy with the city's realignment process, particularly with the
placement of staff in other areas of business and locations.

Samwu has accused the city of adopting a unilateral stance to the process
which, after almost a year, is nearing completion.

Samwu branch secretary Stanley Yisaka said on Tuesday that responses from
the city to the union on its complaints were unsatisfactory and that the
union was left with no choice but to prepare for strike action.

Samwu handed a list of demands to the city administration last month when
around 1 000 of its members went on strike for a day in solidarity with a
nationwide civil servants' strike.

A process of polling city workers who are Samwu members will start next week
to determine how many of them are in agreement with a strike, in preparation
for giving the prerequisite two weeks' notice to the bargaining council to
strike in August.

Samwu is accusing the city of putting an end to talks through the
centralised labour organisation forum established last year to discuss the
city's staff reorganisation, but says it is not yet done negotiating.

&quot;We wanted to be part of the organisational restructuring. It's supposed to
be a participative process. We should have bargained on the relocation of
staff,&quot; said Yisaka.

&quot;We need them to be open and transparent with us, and we believe they have
not been.&quot;

Yisaka said some Samwu members were unhappy with their new placements
following the closure of the Epping markets, the Maitland abattoir, the
Athlone Power Station and other depots across the city.

But city executive director for corporate services, David Beretti, told the
Cape Argus on Tuesday that it was not aware of any dispute registered by
Samwu against the city, which would provide the grounds for a strike.

The city, he said, had received no notice of intent to strike by Samwu
workers.

Beretti said the city would return to the negotiation table through the
bargaining council which next meets on July 30 and would be prepared to
discuss all Samwu's issues.

&quot;We are always happy to bargain with them. We welcome all and any of the
items they have raised to be brought to the table,&quot; he said.

Beretti said the re-alignment process and the placement of staff was in line
with service delivery requirements in the city.

Yisaka said Samwu had advised its members not to accept placement letters
issued by the city confirming the new positions of staff according to a
revised organisational structure.

SANParks ready with plans ahead of strike

SABC, 5 July 2007
Western Cape SANParks management has put contingency plans in place to
ensure that tourists visiting their sites are not interfered with during
today's planned strike by workers affiliated to trade unions. Employees
intend to picket at Cape Point, Table Mountain and West Coast national
parks.

The union is demanding that SANParks recognise them as a bargaining agent.
Phumeza Mgxashe, the Table Mountain national parks communications manager,
says honorary rangers and volunteers have been put on standby. Meanwhile the
Kruger National Park strike has entered its second day.

Rangers, administrators, cleaners and many other workers have already
started to take part in picketing in and outside the park. Dev Naidoo, the
regional secretary for Hospersa, says that after a ruling by the Commission
for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), they can now picket
within the camps and not only at entrance gates. He says that their protests
are being carried out in a lawful and peaceful manner.

The workers are demanding that their union, the Health and Other Personnel
Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa) be recognized by SANParks as a
bargaining agent at salary negotiations.

dispute with Exxaro after 8% wage hike offer

Engineering News, 4 July 2007
&lt; http://www.miningweekly.co.za/article.php?a_id=112105 &gt; Trade unions
Solidarity, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the National Union
of Metalworkers of South Africa on Wednesday declared a dispute with
black-owned coal producer Exxaro, after the company made a “final” wage
offer of 8%.

The parties will meet with a facilitator from the Commission for
Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration on July 16, failing which, workers
will apply for a strike certificate, Solidarity said in an emailed
statement.

Solidarity and the NUM are both demanding 15% wage increases.

Shares in Exxaro gained 1,97% on Wednesday, to close at R67,30 a share.

/breaking_news__business/&gt; 1.4 Vodacom, union butt heads over strike numbers

Mail &amp; Guardian, 4 July 2007
Vodacom and the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) disputed on Wednesday the
number of workers on strike at the company. The strike -- over working
conditions -- began on Monday.

Vodacom said out of its workforce of 4 302 employees, less than 120 were
striking countrywide. The CWU said 1 325 employees embarked on strike
action.

CWU spokesperson Mfanafuthi Sithebe said: &quot;Over 200 workers from Gauteng
marched to [Vodacom's] headquarters in Midrand this [Wednesday] afternoon,
so how can their figures be at all possible?&quot;

He said if the marchers had not been numerous, the police and private
security guards would not have turned out as they had. &quot;This is a strike
about workers' rights and not about numbers,&quot; he said.

While the workers marched to the building, Vodacom spokesperson Dot Field
said there were not many. &quot;In fact, less than 60 are currently marching
towards Vodaworld,&quot; she said.

Sithebe said the union had asked Vodacom to obtain an independent auditor to
put the issue to rest. &quot;We have asked them to get an auditor but they have
not responded ... what exactly do they have to hide?&quot;

Field said the company's records show that less than 15% (645) of its staff
belong to the CWU. &quot;We have asked the union to present us with more names,
but then we received names of people who we have not even heard of, or
aren't even employed within the company.&quot;

She said Vodacom respects the CWU, but it does not have the 30% employee
membership needed for recognition, as agreed at the Commission for
Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration in 1999. &quot;If they reach the target,
then we will gladly recognise them.&quot;

In a memorandum presented by the marchers, the CWU demands that Vodacom
recognise the CWU for collective bargaining purposes.

The union said workers are subjected to disciplinary hearings without proper
representation. Workers who assist their fellows at such hearings are
penalised for not meeting their performance goals, and this affects their
bonuses.

Some are even expected to represent workers on off-days, and they ended up
losing pay, the union said.

The CWU also demands that elected shop stewards be given paid time off to
perform their duties as trade-union representatives. -- Sapa

Strike has no effect on business — Vodacom

SAPA, Business Day, 5 July 2007
Vodacom and the Communication Workers Union (CWU) yesterday disputed the
number of workers on strike at the company. The strike, over working
conditions, began on Monday.

Vodacom said that of its workforce of 4302 employees, fewer than 120 were
striking countrywide.

The union said 1325 employees had embarked on the strike . CWU spokesman
Mfanafuthi Sithebe said: “More than 200 workers from Gauteng marched to
(Vodacom’s) headquarters in Midrand this afternoon, so how can their figures
be at all possible?”

He said if the marchers had not been numerous, the police and private
security guards would not have turned out as they had. “This is a strike
about workers’ rights and not about numbers,” he said.

While the workers marched to the building, Vodacom spokeswoman Dot Field
said the group was small. “In fact less than 60 are currently marching
towards Vodaworld,” she said.

Sithebe said the union had asked Vodacom to obtain an independent auditor to
put the issue to rest.

Field said: “We have asked them to get an auditor but they have not
responded … what exactly do they have to hide?” She said the company’s
records showed that less than 15% (645) of its staff were CWU members.

“We have asked the union to present us with more names but then we received
names of people who we have not even heard of, or aren’t even employed
within the company,” she said. Vodacom respected the union, she said, but it
did not have the 30% employee membership needed for recognition, as agreed
on at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration in 1999.

“If they reach the target, then we will gladly recognise them.” In the
memorandum of demands presented by the marchers, the CWU demanded that
Vodacom recognise the union for collective bargaining purposes.

It said workers had been subjected to disciplinary hearings without proper
representation. Workers who assisted their fellow workers at such hearings
were penalised for not meeting their performance goals, and this affected
their bonuses.

Some were even expected to represent workers on days off, and they ended up
losing pay, the union said. It demanded that elected shop stewards be given
paid time off to perform their duties as trade union representatives.

Hundreds of Vodacom workers in Eastern and Western Cape have joined the
strike, which is planned to last until tomorrow.

Workers at the company, which serves 21,8-million customers in SA, cite
unfair discrimination, irregular pay structures and poor working conditions
among their grievances.

Vodacom has said that the strike has had a minimal effect as it has not
affected either its business or services to customers. Sapa

for Eskom, car industries as unions seek 15% increase

Mawande Jack, EC Herald, 5 July 2007
More than 150 000 workers in the engineering sector and about 36 000 in the
motor vehicle, tyre and rubber sectors are bracing for nationwide industrial
action this month.

A special national executive committee meeting of the National Union of
Metalworkers (Numsa) at the weekend resolved that Friday, Monday and Friday
next week (July 6, 9 and 16) should be the days to launch the strikes in
these sectors.

Numsa regional secretary Irvin Jim said yesterday that major car
manufacturing firms in the Eastern Cape like Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler,
Ford and General Motors, and several tyre and rubber companies, including
Goodyear, Firestone, Dunlop and Continental Tyres, would be hit by the
strike.

“Workers are demanding a 15% wage increase, which is not related to
inflation, while employers are offering 6,3%,” Jim said.

Numsa spokesman Mziwakhe Hlangani said they had met last Sunday to assess
the state of wage negotiations in all sectors represented by the union.

He said wage negotiations with employers in the auto sector had deadlocked
after the union‘s wage demand of 15% was declined.

“Employers in the vehicle sector do not really want to engage in
negotiations,” said Hlangani. “The process is frustrating. Workers feel that
they are nowhere near reaching any resolution soon.”

The strike by the engineering workers is planned for Monday next week, while
workers in the vehicle, tyre and rubber sectors are expected to down tools
on July 16.

Eskom workers, especially those affiliated to Numsa, the National Union of
Metalworkers and Solidarity, are expected to engage in protest activities
that will culminate in marches to Eskom offices countrywide tomorrow.

Employers in the engineering industry are offering 7,8% for the lowest grade
and 7,3% for the A categories, while Numsa demands a 15% wage increase.

The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa said unions
were scheduled to hold a combined meeting today.

&lt; http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article.php?a_id=112124 &gt; 1.7 Eskom,
unions resume talks

Mariaan Olivier, Engineering News, 5 Jul 2007
The final round of wage negotiations between South Africa’s electricity
supplier Eskom and three trade unions, together representing around 20 000
employees, has started on Thursday morning, and workers are hopeful that the
company will increase its 6% offer.

The Union of Mineworkers (NUM), Solidarity and the National Union of
Metalworkers (Numsa), one of which had indicated that they were willing to
lower their 12% demand, have been locked in wage negotiations with Eskom for
over a month.

Unions made it clear this week that they were committed to a negotiated
settlement with Eskom, provided that the employer demonstrated the same
commitment by increasing its wage offer, Solidarity said in an emailed
statement.

Earlier this week, NUM spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said that Eskom had
indicated at a meeting between the union and executive management that the
company was willing to up its offer.

“Eskom employees expect today’s negotiations to bear fruit and we are
committed to reaching a negotiated settlement. If this should prove
impossible, we shall have no option but to refer the matter for arbitration
and enforcing a settlement,” Solidarity spokesperson Jaco Kleynhans said.

Initial salary negotiations started in May, which was followed by several
rounds of talks and threats of downing tools.

A court interdict obtained this week, has, however, stopped employees from
embarking on a strike and unions gave written undertakings that its members
would not down tools and, which could, potentially have lead to power
outages.

IOL, 5 July 2007

Wage negotiations with the Agricultural Research Council were concluded this
week, trade union Solidarity said on Thursday.

Spokesperson Jaco Kleynhans said Solidarity and the National Education,
Health and Allied Workers Union signed an agreement with the council which
provides for increases of between 4 percent and 7.3 percent for different
categories of workers.

The increases will be implemented by July 15th, Kleynhans said. - Sapa

&lt; http://www.zimonline.co.za/Article.aspx?ArticleId=1626 &gt; 2.1 Labour union
braces for fresh protests

Prince Nyathi, ZimOnline, 4 July 2007
HARARE – Zimbabwe’s labour movement on Tuesday said it had begun
preparations for fresh protests by workers, in a development certain to
aggravate tensions in a country already on political knife edge due to a
rapidly deteriorating economic crisis.

Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) spokesman Khumbulani Ndlovu told
ZimOnline that a meeting of top leaders of the union that is the largest
representative body for workers in the country agreed at a meeting last
Saturday to “proceed with job action”.

The ZCTU was now consulting its general membership on the nature and form of
the job action that the union says is necessary to pressure the government
and employers to link wages to inflation, which at more than 4 500 percent
is the highest in the world.

“The meeting (of ZCTU regional leaders) agreed to proceed with the job
action but after further consultations with our constituency. A general
assembly meeting will also meet soon to endorse the meeting’s
recommendations,” said Ndlovu.

The ZCTU, which in May had said it would call worker protests in the first
week of July, says in addition to linking wages to inflation, the government
must urgently act to end Zimbabwe’s severe economic crisis.
Ndlovu said the nature and timing of the planned job action would remain a
secret in order to catch the country’s security forces off guard after armed
police last September brutally assaulted ZCTU secretary general Wellington
Chibebe and scores of other union activists for attempting to organise
worker protests in Harare.

A two-day nationwide work boycott subsequently called by the ZCTU flopped
last April as workers turned up for work and business opened fearing a
government backlash.

Labour Minister Nicholas Goche and police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena were
not immediately available for comment on the latest threat by the ZCTU to
call protests by workers.

Inflation is the most visible sign of Zimbabwe’s deep recession that has
left more than 80 percent of workers without jobs and left those still lucky
to hold a formal job unable to feed their families because of ever-rising
prices.

The government last week froze prices of all commodities following a spate
of price hikes that had seen prices of basic goods rising by more than 500
percent in the space of just three weeks.

Soldiers and police have since last week raided several shops in Harare to
force owners to lower prices. At least 194 retailers have been arrested and
the figure is set to rise as the police intensify the crackdown on
businesses defying the order to reduce prices.

Analysts say the government’s latest effort to keep a lid on prices was
meant to pacify angry workers ahead of general presidential and
parliamentary elections next year but would come at a heavy cost as this
could force some companies to shut down and force more workers to join the
growing jobless list. - ZimOnline

&lt; http://www.swradioafrica.com/news040707/union040707.htm &gt; 2.2 Labour union
resolves to strike over worsening economic crisis

Lance Guma, SW Radio Africa, 4 July 2007
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has resolved to mobilise its members
for a strike in July to protest the worsening plight of workers in the
country. On Wednesday ZCTU Deputy Secretary General Japhet Moyo told
Newsreel the labour body’s regional leaders met on Saturday to consider
several issues, one of which was that nothing had changed in terms of union
demands to government. The ZCTU put forward demands for a living wage for
workers above the poverty datum line of Z$5,5 million a month. Since those
demands were made government has failed to address any of them and inflation
is now pegged at over 10 000 percent by independent analysts and is
constantly changing the living wage required.

Moyo said they are consulting the ZCTU general membership on the best method
of striking. In the past they have employed mass stay aways and street
demonstrations. On all occasions the state has responded with brute force,
crushing all gatherings and severely beating up union leaders. Moyo conceded
that shaping the actual strategy was going to be a challenge in view of the
repression in the country. It will then be up to the ZCTU general assembly
to meet and endorse any recommendations made.

The ZCTU is already predicting massive retrenchments of workers caused by
the chaos over price controls which are threatening to shut down many
businesses. Manufacturers and supermarkets countrywide are considering their
options following threats from government that they risk having their
businesses nationalised if they do not implement 50 percent price
reductions. Moyo predicted the situation would severely affect the few
workers lucky to have jobs in an environment of 80 percent unemployment. He
however said the ZCTU is still to adopt a formal position on the price
reductions being ordered by government, and that this would be tabled for
discussion by the union in days to come.

It's a matter of survival as latest crisis hits

Nelson Banya, Business Report, 5 July 2007
Harare - Shoppers now form long queues early in the morning at many Harare
shops, hoping to grab the last essentials left on shelves amid a price
crisis that has sharpened already desperate consumer shortages.

Zimbabwe's latest shopping nightmare came after President Robert Mugabe's
government last week ordered a 50 percent cut in prices to fight galloping
inflation, a move that critics said was bound to worsen the country's
economic problems.

According to Bloomberg, a further response to these worsening conditions was
that Zimbabwe's main labour union had planned a nationwide strike later this
month. Khumbulani Ndlovu, a spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions, said that they planned to protest against low wages and the
government's handling of the economy.

The union's executive would discuss a date for the strike with regional
officials, Ndlovu told Bloomberg yesterday.

&quot;The strike will begin after the meeting with grass roots leaders, possibly
later this month, but no exact date has been set yet,&quot; Ndlovu said.

Bloomberg, however, reported that most Zimbabweans ignored an appeal by the
union to stage a general strike in April over deteriorating economic
conditions.

Yesterday Zimbabwe state media reported that manufacturers, state firms and
some retailers had agreed to cut prices in compliance with the government
order. But many grumble privately that the drive is unsustainable.

The official move to exert price controls came after a wild week that saw
the price of many basic goods jump by more than 300 percent - a sign
inflation, already officially close to 4 500 percent a year, was spinning
ever more wildly out of control.

The government has accused private companies of raising prices as part of a
plot to oust Mugabe, who has been pilloried in the West for his
controversial policies.

Mugabe has denied mismanaging the economy and accused Western powers, mainly
Britain and the US, of having sabotaged his policy to seize white-owned
farms to resettle landless black people.

Government price monitors have already arrested nearly 200 business people,
including a ruling party senator, for defying the price freeze. Some
economists said this would only help to entrench the illegal market that
many Zimbabweans already rely on for purchasing basic goods.

Although many supermarkets have complied with the directive, they ran out of
stock after panicking consumers, fearing shortages, emptied the shelves.

Many manufacturers have stopped supplying products at the recommended
prices, fearing massive losses as other prices have continued to rise
unabated.

&quot;I know once all this is over, there will be no sugar, cooking oil and soap
in the shops. I have no option but to stock up. I might even resell some if
I get some extra stuff. It's a matter of survival,&quot; said Kennedy Sithole, a
security guard at a major supermarket.

The state-controlled Herald newspaper yesterday reported that the
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), the country's biggest industrial
body, had resolved to enforce the price cut.

&quot;We are complying with the directive. We will do what we have been ordered
to do,&quot; the Herald quoted CZI head Callisto Jokonya as having said.

The government has threatened to seize and nationalise businesses, including
foreign mines, that it accused of backing what it called a British-sponsored
campaign to overthrow Mugabe.

Under an operation dubbed Dzikamai (Calm Down), the police service has
launched a crackdown on informal market foreign currency traders that the
government blamed for the local currency's free fall.

Few exhausted shoppers saw any end soon to the price crunch that has
squeezed the country. They already struggled with unemployment at above 80
percent, and regular fuel, foreign currency and food shortages. - Reuters

/breaking_news__international_news/&gt; 2.4 Wolfowitz joins think tank, will
focus on Africa

Reuters, Mail &amp; Guardian, 3 July 2007
Days after his departure from the World Bank, Paul Wolfowitz has joined the
American Enterprise Institute (AEI) as a visiting scholar, the conservative
Washington-based think tank announced on Monday.

The AEI said Wolfowitz will focus on development issues, particularly in
Africa, and on public-private partnerships.

Wolfowitz, who was instrumental in the planning of the United States
invasion of Iraq when he was deputy defence secretary, resigned as president
of the World Bank amid a scandal involving a high-paying promotion for his
girlfriend, Shaha Ali Riza.

Before his June 30 departure from the World Bank, Wolfowitz said: &quot;I really
have developed such strong feelings about the importance of Africa, the
opportunity in Africa, and such enthusiasm for so many Africans that I've
gotten to know that that's really where I'd like to focus for the next few
years.&quot;

The AEI has been home to leading advocates of the Iraq war including John
Bolton, President George Bush's former United Nations envoy, and Richard
Perle, ex-chairperson of the Defence Policy Board at the Defence
Department. - Reuters

NGO body opens fire on SA’s ‘exclusionary’ peer review

Nicola Mawson, Business Day, 5 July 2007
Despite President Thabo Mbeki warmly welcoming the African Peer Review
Mechanism (APRM) panel’s country report, the process has been criticised as
exclusionary.

Mbeki said yesterday SA was “ready to share its experience and expertise
when called on in strengthening and deepening peer review across the
continent”. He presented SA’s peer-review report to the African Union summit
in Ghana on Monday.

He said it was a “positive” report that acknowledged “huge strides made by
SA in transforming the country into a vibrant democracy with one of the most
progressive constitutions in the world”.

But South African NGO Coalition (Sangoco) executive director Hassen Lorgat
said there was no sense of an inclusive national programme of action. The
process should have been a major issue in SA, but lost space to the recent
African National Congress conference.

Lorgat said the review had missed out on an opportunity to develop a
national programme of action in which everyone could participate. He said
the government was obsessed with looking good.

Public Service Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, chairman of the National
Governing Council leading the APRM in SA, refused last month to show civil
society partners the final version of SA’s APRM programme of action before
it was presented to heads of state in Ghana.

This week, she said SA might see the report within six months of its review.
Lorgat said the government was “hyper afraid” that the report would be
leaked to the media.

The government was accused previously of rejecting the report for being too
critical, claims Mbeki denied, saying the government was given the right to
contribute to the report by indicating its plans to improve matters. He said
yesterday concerns were raised about the panel’s methodology in “the spirit
of peer review and genuine debate and dialogue”, and did not “amount to a
rejection of the report”.

The review report noted 18 local practices that could be emulated, including
co-operative governance, popular participatory governance practices, Batho
Pele, multipurpose community centres, the highly consultative budget
formulation, achievements by the South African Revenue Service and the JSE,
and triple bottom line reporting.

However, Lorgat said there were shortcomings in the way the APRM dealt with
some issues, including that of private funding for political parties.

Lorgat said the process was noble, but did not help streamline several
different processes, and this resulted in issues being dealt with in silos.

FXI tackles SABC board nomination process

Thom McLachlan, Business Day, 5 July 2007
The Freedom of Expression Institute (FXI) this week criticised Parliament’s
portfolio committee for what it called the committee’s lack of transparency
and public participation in the nomination of South African Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC) board members.

The lobby group said on Tuesday that the portfolio committee needed to show
more appreciation for the nomination process so as not to arouse suspicion,
saying it needed to “ensure that it heeds the letter and spirit of the
broadcasting act”.
It said the act required that there must be “participation by the public in
a nomination process”, as well as “transparency and openness”.

In terms of the programme, committee members would be handed curriculums
vitae of nominees on July 30. For the next two days, the committee would
short-list candidates.

“Incredibly, interviews for the short-listed candidates begin the day after
the completion of the shortlisting process. This is unworkable, and may well
lead to suspicions that candidates have been earmarked.”

The FXI said that requirements relating to the public’s involvement would
not be met if the process was rushed, and sufficient time needed to be given
for the nomination process to unfold, as well as for short-listed candidates
to prepare themselves for interviews .

However, portfolio committee chairman Godfrey Oliphant said yesterday it
would grant an extension but that the FXI’s reasons were “unacceptable” —
the committee had responded to the FXI directly, telling it so. “They woke
up too late. It is not our fault if they were disorganised,” he said. “All
the ground has been covered” in regard to public participation and
transparency.

The FXI said the incumbent board was responsible for “sweeping under the
carpet” the Sisulu commission of inquiry’s report into allegations of
blacklisting of commentators . “This board also, after the damning report
against the SABC’s news chief, Snuki Zikalala, still saw it fit to declare
its full confidence in Zikalala.” With Sapa

Tales of the young and the jobless

Ann Bernstein, Business Day, 5 July 2007
The unbelievably high levels of unemployment among young people in SA should
be the subject of sleepless nights for politicians, policy makers and other
leaders. According to official statistics, the strict unemployment rate for
young people aged 15-24 last year was no less than 50,2% — almost double the
general unemployment rate of 25,5%. Even this grim statistic does not tell
the whole story. More young people are discouraged from seeking work than
people in any other age group. If those who are no longer looking for work
are included, the unemployment rate for young people expands to 65,2%,
compared with the general unemployment figure of about 38%.

What is more, the burden of unemployment falls disproportionately on young
Africans in what amounts to a continuing structure of disadvantage.

Worst of all, the situation is not really improving. Accelerated economic
growth — from a low base — over the past few years has had only a marginal
impact on youth unemployment; from 2001 to 2006, according to the official
figures, unemployment in the 15-24 age bracket dropped by a mere 3,1
percentage points, from 53,4% to 50,2%.

What lies behind the cold official statistics? What are the reasons for the
poor absorption of young South Africans into the labour market? Policy
makers need much more detailed information so they can stop generalising
about this phenomenon and formulate more focused and effective strategies
for addressing it.

Since September 2001, the government’s quarterly Labour Force Surveys (LFS)
have generated valuable statistics on youth unemployment, but information
extends over only two years, and analysis has shown that key data on whether
or not respondents have worked before are unreliable.

In order to generate the improved information that will deepen knowledge
about unemployment among young people, the Centre for Development Enterprise
(CDE), in conjunction with the Centre for Applied African Microeconomic
Research at the University of the Witwatersrand, conducted new research on
employment histories and unemployment. This retrospective survey was based
in three sites: Johannesburg, eThekwini, and Polokwane.

Titled The South African Young Persons Survey and conducted between July and
November last year, this groundbreaking work traced the histories of more
than 1000 young people — almost all of them African — between the ages of 20
and 35 from their 15th birthdays onwards.

This enabled their education and career paths to be recorded more accurately
and over longer periods than in the LFS and other surveys. As a result, the
CDE research provides important new data on youth unemployment, and how to
set about reducing it.

Given the importance of education in equipping people to both search for and
find jobs, school records were collected for almost all the respondents.

Also, in order to supplement the results of the quantitative survey with
rich personal recollections, 18 focus groups were convened — six in each of
the three cities studied. Participants were asked to comment on education
and skills issues, job search issues, and the influence of their job status
on their quality of life.

The main findings of the survey and focus groups are as follows:

*        The survey fully confirms the high unemployment rates recorded by
the official LFS. Fifty-six percent of men in the 15-24 age group in
Johannesburg are unemployed; for eThekwini, the figure is 66%; and 65% for
Polokwane. Unemployment among young women in the same age group stands at
65% in Johannesburg, 68% in eThekwini, and no less than a staggering 88% in
Polokwane.
*        n In most healthy economies, there is significant job mobility
among young people as they experiment with jobs until they find those that
best suit them. This desirable process enhances the efficiency of the labour
market. However, under the stress of unemployment in SA, young people hold
on to their first jobs for as long as they can, and only a small minority
leave them voluntarily to look for other jobs better suited to their talents
and aspirations. This probably means that a significant portion of the
incoming workforce is not optimally utilised (mismatched or underemployed),
with significant consequences for national economic performance and
productivity.
*        Race, gender and place matter when it comes to unemployment. Young
Africans tend to be jobless for longer periods than young people of other
population groups. Young African women are jobless for longer than young
men; young African women without a senior certificate or equivalent are
jobless for longer than those with better educational qualifications; and
young African women in more remote parts of the country are jobless for
longer than those in urban areas.
*        Most young people prefer to be formally employed rather than
self-employed, as they perceive the latter option as very risky. This is a
major barrier to encouraging self-employment as a means of reducing
joblessness among young people in a context where there are many obstacles
to the creation of large-scale formal employment.

The focus group discussions revealed high levels of dissatisfaction with
their job status among young people. Nearly 70% of those participating said
they were “very dissatisfied” or “dissatisfied” with their lives. Moreover,
a majority of selfemployed participants also said that they were “very
dissatisfied” or “dissatisfied” with their lives — an ominous indicator of
the quality of self-employment.

These findings tally with SA’s low recorded levels of entrepreneurship and
should greatly concern policy makers.

The findings emerging from CDE’s research clearly indicate the need for a
greater sense of urgency. Bold strategic interventions are required at
national and local levels of government.

We need to move beyond words, small interventions and projects that are
seldom evaluated for their effect and start to think about systemic
interventions that could make a difference on scale.

Looking at the realities of “not having a job” puts a very different
perspective on the long delay in getting rid of the regulations that hamper
small business in this country; or the cascading negative consequences of
crime and its effects on smaller enterprises and entry-level businesses that
can be devastated by the continuing high rates of crime.

The massive scale of unemployment among young South Africans is an issue of
considerable national concern. It is not receiving the attention it
deserves.

Feminism is more than just capitalism with tits

Zoe Williams, The Guardian, 4 July 2007
Enough of the numbers game. The issue is not how many women are in power,
but how many fight for collective rights.

So help me, I have no interest in a deputy leadership election that has
already happened. I have no interest in whether Harriet Harman has been
attacked more because she's female or less. I don't agree with Sarah Sands,
writing on these pages yesterday, that the &quot;most striking characteristic of
leftwing middle-class feminists is their self-importance&quot;, but only because
she seems to think you could separate middle-class lefties from middle-class
rightists via their self-importance, when actually, on that score, it would
be harder than telling two ducks apart. I am just interested in the first
principle, which is wrong. Westminster does not need more women in it. It
needs more feminists in it, and the first principle of feminism is that you
don't need to be a woman to be one.

dwidth=broadband&amp;rand=5543186&amp;tile=5543186&gt;

Sands gives us mistake one, that the rabid possessive individualism
characterised by Margaret Thatcher is a truer &quot;feminism&quot; than Harman's. The
sine qua non of feminism is battling for collective rights, anything else is
just capitalism with tits. She gives us mistake two, that any discussion of
the cause of women generally has to be plotted around prominent females in
parliament, standing or falling by their personal successes or failures.

Mistake three comes via Harman, who said while campaigning for the deputy
leadership: &quot;Wouldn't it be galling if Cameron chose the first female
deputy, when we're the party of equality!&quot; Well, that didn't happen, but
something worse did - Gordon Brown has five women in his cabinet, David
Cameron has seven. This makes the Tories 40% more equal than Labour. They've
only been able to trounce Labour with a simple reshuffle because everyone is
buying into the fiction that parity can be &quot;counted&quot;. Of course, Labour
denies that it's been trounced, with vice-chair Joan Ryan responding that
the new shadow appointments were &quot;a sign of David Cameron's weakness. While
Labour is breaking ground with the first ever female home secretary ...
Cameron's panicky reshuffle is only interested in staving off the threat
from the right wing within his party.&quot;

This has a truly pathetic ring. If we're going to call female appointments
de facto groundbreaking, that in itself is a daft enough position. If such
appointments are groundbreaking, but only on the left, while on the right
they are a sign of weakness, that has stretched into the realm of totally
daft. Ryan illustrates mistake four, that a simple female presence, like a
flash of fuscia on a grey background, will stimulate female engagement and
emulation among the wider population. Women in politics only operate as role
models when they say admirable things.

Hazel Blears, peddling her own case for a female-friendly deputyship a
couple of weeks ago, said: &quot;The way women relate to politics is different to
men, they're interested in everyday lives, stories, people they meet, not
statistics and GDP.&quot; Now maybe it's churlish to worry since she didn't win,
but I don't think it's unreasonable to balk at being presented as the
non-statistical gender that likes &quot;stories&quot;. I don't think it's vindictive
to point out that a man would never say such a supercilious thing, and I
don't think it's excessive to conclude that, for every instance in which
women's rights are better served by a woman, there is a counter-instance in
which they are better served by a man.

This is mistake five: the whole of Westminster has wedded itself to this
numbers game, where you literally count the women - 17 on the right, 97 on
the left, yay! - and decide on the winner. In fact, it's more like the card
game Top Trumps. If you have fewer women, invest them with power and
profile. Theresa May is probably worth five or six Celia Barlows, though to
really thrash out the rules you'd have to go on a long train journey with
Francis Maude and you might prefer to kill yourself.

I want to go into mistake six - Jacqui Smith's cleavage and the responses
thereto - but the honest feminist has to stop counting. Look instead at the
conditions keeping women out of politics, which are the same as those
keeping women at the bottom of any heap. The pay gap, the carer gap, the
maternity drain, all the ossified iniquities that fence women into hardship.
That's what closes down opportunities. Scratch anyone who uses the word
&quot;role model&quot; and you'll find they're either avoiding solutions which are
ultimately fiscal, or they've given no thought to gender politics at all.

&lt; http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3917186 &gt; 3.3 Where's proof
of denialism?

Essop Pahad, The Star, 5 July 2007
Laurence ought to know better than to peddle myths masquerading as facts
about Mbeki's stance on Aids

Patrick Laurence's article &quot;Mbeki book deal questionable&quot; (The Star Opinion
and Analysis, June 26 2007) suffers from the kind of sloppy journalism and
woefully inadequate research one would expect from a novice and not a
veteran observer in a respected paper.

The article lacks rigour, reproduces inaccuracies as fact, and makes
assertions without producing any substantial evidence. He uses freedom of
the press in a most irresponsible and illiberal manner to impute motive in
the absence of rational discourse. And he uses freedom of the press in a
most irresponsible fashion to attack what he deems to be my role in
facilitating the initial contact between Mr Roberts and Absa Bank.

First, is his assertion that &quot;the financing, the writing and the publication
of the biography raises profoundly important issues about the presidency -
or more precisely, the minister in the presidency Essop Pahad and the
author&quot;. What are these so-called profoundly important issues? What are the
&quot;inter-twining facts&quot; Laurence refers to and where is the proof that I,
acting for the Presidency, raised funds for the book and sought to keep my
role out of the public arena?

In response to questions in Parliament I indicated that the Presidency was
not involved in raising funds for the book. In my personal capacity I
assisted in raising funds from potential donors, and, as I have repeatedly
said, there is nothing wrong with this.

It was facilitation in an excellent cause - that of having a different view
of the president published by a person with a vividly powerful style and a
proven record of fierce independence, as was apparent in a controversy over
a biography he had recently written.

Second, the suggestion that Mr Roberts, to avoid his biography of the
president degenerating into &quot;hagiography or a one- sided discourse&quot;, ought
to have, rather, ne-gotiated an advance payment from the publisher is rather
fanciful. Such advances are usually reserved for a handful of elite au-thors
whose works are guaranteed to generate substantial profits to publishing
houses.

There are many books on the shelves which have required some form of
funding, and Patrick Laurence knows it.

Third, it is interesting that Laurence's article is singularly devoid of
substance and ideas but long on personal attacks both on the president and
myself. The one area where he does actually engage in a discussion of ideas
is when he ventures onto the terrain of HIV and Aids. And here he trots out
the old trope of the president being an Aids denialist without providing one
shred of evidence.

President Mbeki, as Ronald Suresh Roberts ably demonstrates, has never
denied that HIV causes Aids. What he has said is that no substantive
discussion about prevention can occur in the abstract outside of a broader
discussion of poverty and underdevelopment.

In advancing this particular articulation, the president was far from
denying that HIV causes Aids. He was in fact seeking to introduce a serious,
debate over a major scourge humanity faces; and challenging orthodoxy that
sought refuge in the assertion by pharmaceutical companies that they had all
the answers (of course, at a price).

He was posing serious questions about the primacy of prevention and in so
doing he was challenging the very hegemony of multinational pharmaceutical
companies who have totally appropriated the discourse on HIV and Aids and
subsumed it completely into the medical model. It was President Mbeki who
worked tirelessly to bring down the costs of the relevant drugs; and he
succeeded, even drawing grudging cheers from his Aids critics.

Laurence certainly retreats into the fanciful when he argues that the
establishment of the Aids Advisory Panel in 2000 is a &quot;clear sign of Mbeki's
dalliance with denialism&quot;. Surely it is not a mark of a denialist who wants
answers because he understands that Africa faces a catastrophe which will
lead to, in his own words &quot;… the death of … millions and millions of
people …&quot;

Laurence ought to know better than to peddle myths masquerading as fact, for
when the president established the panel he said with absolute clarity and
determination &quot;… as Africans, we want to respond to HIV/Aids in a manner
that is effective, a manner that does indeed address the fact of these
millions of lives that are threatened&quot;.

Where, Patrick Laurence, has the president actually denied the link between
HIV and Aids? Where is the evidence of denialism? In the increased
allocation of our fiscal resources to fight HIV and Aids? In our
government's anti-retroviral roll-out programme which is widely recognised
as one of the most comprehensive in the world?

Fourth, Laurence himself as denialist is absolutely incapable of
acknowledging that the current comprehensive approach by our government to
deal with HIV and Aids is a product of our careful, studied and incremental
approach over the past decade to one of our most pressing challenges.

Why this incapacity and unwillingness? Does it have anything to do with an
unwillingness to see the &quot;Other&quot; as an intellectual fully capable of posing
hard questions in the face of enormous pressure, unwilling to bend to the
will of multinational corporations? Is it because he cannot see the &quot;Other&quot;
as capable of rational policy formulation and implementation? Surely
capacity and intellect are not the preserve of journalists and commentators
alone, particularly those occupying one small political corner?

Fifth, Laurence's article demonstrates the paucity of some who in the face
of the radical intellectual seek to narrow the space to debate ideas in a
book like Fit to Govern.

These individuals appear threatened by radical intellectuals and seek solace
in comfortable stereotypes and are reduced to reproducing them rather than
debating the big ideas of the day. Stifling debate by labelling the &quot;Other&quot;
whose very intellect causes unease is not in the best tradition of
liberalism, which is open to diverse views and sentiments.

Sixth, peddling myth may well be your stock in trade, Mr Laurence, but it
belittles you and the hard-won freedom of the press when you attempt to pass
off myth as reality, fiction as fact, and commentary as solid research.

Emerge from your ideological prison and explore ideas, engage in debate
about policies and policy direction for this is the essence of democracy.
Debate the critical ideas and propositions in the book by Roberts, for it is
a book that gets under the skin of its detractors as surely as it got under
yours.

Understand the &quot;Other&quot;, appreciate the intellect of the &quot;Other&quot; and debate
openly with the &quot;Other&quot; and not vicariously through stereotypes continually
reproduced from previous eras.

For starters, perhaps, finally dispense with dubious heroes such as Lord
Acton, so brilliantly disposed of by Roberts in his book. Both your readers
and your profession demand nothing less.

party v liberation movement

Max du Preez, The Star, 5 July 2007
How much has really changed in running of ANC since exile days?

A few months ago a visiting American academic asked me whether I thought the
ANC was still, in essence, a liberation movement rather than a political
party.

Yes, I answered, unfortunately many in the ANC still see it as a liberation
movement and act accordingly.

On Monday a European journalist asked me the same question.

Not really, I said, I think the ANC is finally moving on and is today more a
modern political party in a multi-party democracy. And right then I
remembered my answer from a few months earlier.
It was the ANC's just-concluded policy conference that changed my judgment,
I realised. Most of what I was told about the closed sessions at Gallagher
Estate confirmed to me that it was the conduct and behaviour of a political
party.

I was therefore surprised to read in an opinion piece on the conference on
Tuesday by Bheki Khumalo, former presidential spokesperson, that &quot;we
reaffirmed our status as a liberation movement rather than a mere
spin-driven political party&quot;.

I think he is dead wrong but then he was, as an Mbeki loyalist, trying to
make a certain political point.

(By the way, what could be behind Khumalo's new high public profile? He is
suddenly popping up everywhere after being under the radar for a long time.
I hope it does mean that he has political ambition and is being pushed by
some power bloc in the party. He is a thoughtful and articulate young man
with the kind of engaging personality that would make him ideal for
political office.)

When the ANC was still in exile, it wasn't a very democratic organisation -
perhaps understandably so. A handful of leaders made most of the crucial
decisions and even when it did have a congress, resolutions were largely
pre-arranged between different interest groups.
During the 1980s the atmosphere in the movement was one of suspicion and
cloak-and-dagger, even paranoia. The military and security men were
powerful, and military and security men are not known for their strong
democratic instincts.

In contrast, what we saw at the policy conference was a party with a
thriving internal democracy. I have been to a fair number of party
congresses in my time, especially of the old National Party.

My impression was that the participation of delegates at the ANC conference
was far less fearful, respectful and orchestrated and more
independent-minded than the NP delegates ever were.

In fact, some felt the conference was too democratic - if this is possible
in a political party - and too free-wheeling.

Delegates stated their convictions forthrightly, even when they knew it
would contradict most in the leadership. It took all secretary-general
Kgalema Motlanthe's peacemaking and managerial skills to reign in the wilder
voices and to assure some form of cohesion. Certainly not the stuff a
standard liberation movement is made of.

The conference was a textbook example of why strong and credible political
leadership is so important in a ruling party and in an open democracy. The
ANC leadership had to scramble to manage proposals from delegates that
would, if accepted as policy, have rewritten the government's sober economic
policies and instituted much more state intervention.

The pressure for the drastic &quot;transformation of the judiciary&quot; (actually
meaning more black judges and magistrates) and the relocation of the
Scorpions to the command of the man they're presently investigating, police
commissioner Jackie Selebi, are other examples of resolutions that could be
tricky to implement.

The trick in a modern political party is for the leadership to take proper
notice of the beliefs, needs and fears of their constituents during
conferences and congresses, and to take that into account when shaping
policy - not for party delegates to make policy. If it were up to the rank
and file, I'm sure the country's constitution would be changed tomorrow -
the death penalty would be reinstated, for instance, equal rights for gays
and lesbians would be scrapped and the freedom of the media would be
severely curtailed.

When it was a liberation movement in exile, the ANC had to rely largely on
its own primitive radio station and a few scrappy propaganda publications to
spread its media message. Now it commands the loyalty of the biggest news
organisation in Africa, the SABC.

Perhaps that's why the ANC's talents for spin-doctoring have not really
progressed beyond crude denials and accusations. Still, some senior ANC
figures handled journalists quite well in briefing them about the
conference.

The ANC would do itself a favour to open their future conferences and
congresses to the media so the broad public won't have to rely on the
interpretation of journalists and outside analysts to understand what was
going on. Gossip is always worse than reality.

But there are remnants of the old exile past. Like the silliness that no one
is allowed to canvass for the position of leadership, while the jockeying
for power is actually overshadowing the entire party.

It would be interesting to see what an ANC congress would be like after the
succession battle had been resolved.

must make changes to the shape it has taken under Mbeki

Xolela Mangcu, Business Day, 5 July 2007
Voila! The word is out. President Thabo Mbeki will make himself available
for a third term as president of the African National Congress (ANC).

I suppose I have always suspected that. But it’s the manner in which the
president made his announcement that I find quite astounding.

At the end of the party’s policy conference, the president gave a lengthy
address admonishing those members of the ANC who defy decisions taken within
the structures of the organisation. Then, without missing a beat , he gave a
television interview in which he repudiated his own party’s stated
preference for the party president and the country’s president to be the
same person.

Now how does Mbeki plan to achieve this feat, given that he is barred from
running for a third term as president of the country? Well, by playing the
ventriloquist. There are at least two ways of doing that. As party
president, he would assume the role of a kingmaker in the selection of the
country’s president, preferably someone who would be his puppet.

Or he could simply push for a constitutional change to end term limits and
ensure himself a third term as the country’s president.

We may simply dismiss the latter as the ramblings of a paranoid columnist.
But in politics we should never leave matters to chance. That is why we have
such contraptions as constitutions, separation of powers, term limits and so
forth.

Politicians’ appetite for power is truly insatiable, and the lengths to
which they will go are boundless. But what really strikes me is the
presumptuousness of it all. The president somehow imagines that we cannot do
without him. Not even Nelson Mandela thought that.

But Mbeki’s presumptuousness says more about our society than it does about
him. After all, what leaders can get away with is a function of what the
citizenry will allow.

There was, however, something about the ANC policy conference that brought a
measure of hope that sanity will ultimately prevail.

If the ANC was really enthusiastic about Mbeki standing for a third term, it
would have loudly proclaimed that at the conference.

Instead, it did the opposite. In a polite and carefully crafted manner, they
showed Mbeki the door. They took back his prerogative to appoint mayors and
premiers and insisted that he should consult the party on his cabinet
appointments. However, and this is the point of this column, political
parties are not the panacea for society’s political ills. If anything,
parties are often the biggest impediment to democratisation.

The ANC must thus go beyond the structural changes it has adopted to an
examination of the cultural changes it will have to undergo if it is to
direct the policies of government with any measure of credibility.

It must change from being simply a vote-catching, patronage-dispensing,
defensive political machine into a transparent public organisation.

Its recommendations would have credibility then because they would have gone
through a process of public deliberation.

I am all for generating critiques of existing racial, class and gender
imbalances, but the ANC must be a platform for engagement with all sectors
of society, and not a platform for the hurling of insults at each other.

The ANC must thus stop thinking of the world in terms of friends and
enemies, of natives, liberals, racists and imperialists.

Frankly, that is a recipe for further paranoia and polarisation.

The organisation would also do well to tap into the wealth of talent that
exists across the spectrum of this society — without thinking that all those
who wish to make a contribution also want to meet the president, or some
silly notion like that.

The ANC must also recast its relationship with the media. There is no way
any modern party or leader can govern effectively without a mastery of media
technologies.

It’s a real pity that we do not have good television in this country.
Television can be the medium through which we have real public debate, and
not just the supine propaganda we are served by the SABC every evening.

The most important cultural change would be for the ANC to stop thinking of
itself and black people as victims of an omnipotent white power structure.
It is the governing party, after all.

Now that the ANC has reached consensus about the need for a developmental
state, the debate must shift to what it would take to transform it into a
mass, deliberative platform.

I am afraid that leaders leave their imprint on organisations. The ANC is
what it is because of Mbeki’s leadership style.

But it’s a leadership style that has come to a cul-de-sac.

The question is who will emerge as a leader with a new, open and
deliberative imprint.
