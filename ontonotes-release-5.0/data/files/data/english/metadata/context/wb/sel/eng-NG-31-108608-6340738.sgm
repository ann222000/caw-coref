When the LHC is brought on-line at full power most likely in mid '08 - 09,
researchers are fully expecting the first results for creating a quantum
sized singularity to show up as a veritable cornucopia of particle
production as the black hole evaporates away in nanoseconds and explodes
into pure energy. But what are they going to do if this doesn't happen?
Well, first they will go through the results of the experiment again, to
indeed verify that most of the energy that went into the reaction has simply
disappeared without a trace. For, even if a quantum singularity with
millions of proton masses has been created, at the physical size it would be
, not much will happen immediately. True, some gamma radiation will be given
off every now and then as the black hole destroys a proton, or eats a
wayward atom, but it will not happen too often - or at least often enough to
be detected. So, at that point, the researchers will slowly come to the
understanding that they have managed to create a stable, though micro-sized
black hole, and that it is currently incorporated within the matter of their
atom-smasher, and oh-so-slowly eating it up and drifting towards the ground.

What will they do?

The thought that a small enough black hole will evaporate is based on the
assumption that virtual particle pairs created at the event horizon will
carry away energy resulting in the terminal destruction of a black hole. The
larger the hole the slower its destruction, so that if the hole is small
enough, it *should* die within a trillionth of a second of its creation.
But, this 'Hawking radiation', named after Professor Stephen Hawking who
first thought of it back in the '70's, is not unmitigated fact. It is an
assumption only. It has never even been observed. While there are close
analogies with fluid dynamics, and phonon interactions that show that there
should be hawking radiation, and so any man-made black hole should
terminate, we just don't really know for sure. There are actually some good
reasons why they shouldn't radiate they way we think they do. A virtual
photon created at the event horizon of a black hole will have its wavelength
red shifted to practically zero. Instead of escaping, there may instead be a
region of virtual photons just above the event horizon forming a low
frequency standing wave pattern - a depleted photon zone if you will. This
may be interesting, but doesn't lead to any black hole evaporation.
Eventually they, whoever 'they' are, probably government agencies or the
president of whatever nation you are living in, will have to tell their
citizens that a horrible, tragic mistake has been made, all in the name of
scientific progress.

When you find out you along with the earth has only a small amount of time
to live, what will you do?

Of course, the ability of the LHC to create a quantum sized black hole
relies on string theory's prediction that there are multiple small
dimensions rolled up all around us and this would lower the creation energy
to a point where a low powered collider such as the LHC, or indeed any
collider humanity could construct within the next several centuries, would
have the possibility of actually making one of these monsters, is correct.
Given the success to failure ratio of any idea the human race ever makes
being right the first time out, I don't really think we have much to worry
about. If there really are multiple hidden dimensions, the energy levels
needed to access them are probably orders of magnitudes higher than anything
we can do present day. If it were not so, black hole decay products would
already be observed in gamma ray interactions in the upper atmosphere, and
they aren't.

Given present day researchers willingness to risk the earth itself on the
off chance they could be wrong, I don't think that's such a bad thing at
all.
