This is the second week of this transport from Austin, TX to New England. Scooby did really well last weekend; all of the drivers just adore him!  Please help him and his travel buddy Flora get from TN to rescue this weekend!!

GSP RESCUE TRANSFER!!
Austin, TX to Worcester, MA and White River Junction, VT

February 23 &amp; 24

This isn't complicated, it's just LONG!

Sweet Scooby the GSP (German Shorthair Pointer) needs to get from the Austin, TX GSP rescue to one in Massachusetts.  Can't be done in just one weekend, so I'm breaking it up over two.

February 16 – 17 will be for the leg from Austin, TX to the Kingsport, TN area.  We then have a short-term, one-week foster to take care of this boy until the weekend of the 23rd and 24th, when we will complete the transport up to Worcester, MA.

UPDATE:  Flora, a beautifully sweet lab mix from the Chattooga County, GA AC has found rescue in VT.  We can save her life if she hitches a ride from TN to CT with Scooby!  She has been added to the second half of this transport.

UPDATE 2:  Passenger change – the rescue decided Andy is too shy to handle this type of transport well, so they are sending another GSP, Scooby, in his place.

Please help in any way you can – driving, fostering, or simply by crossposting.  ALL is VERY MUCH APPRECIATED!!!
