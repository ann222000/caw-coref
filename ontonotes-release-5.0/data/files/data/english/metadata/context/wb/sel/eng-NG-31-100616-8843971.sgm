I finally gave in and cancelled my analog cell phone service.  This
leaves me with a fair bit of quipment that is headed for the trash
unless someone wants it.  I have:

-a number of MicroTac Elites (mostly EE2, one EE3)
-a number of 3W car kits for the above (mostly EE2, one EE3)
(One car kit is mounted in a bag phone bag for portable operation.)
-a number of bag phones of various vintages
-RJ11 adapters for both the Elite and bag phones (or Elite in car kit)
-assorted chargers, cigarette lighter adapters, cables, cradles

Don't toss the bagphones!  Configure them to operate from cigarette
lighter power, not batteries that require maintenance, then put one in
the trunk of each of your vehicles, unregistered with a carrier, so you
can contact 911 from its powerful transmitter in case of emergency when
the pitiful, new toyphone won't connect if your life depends on it.

I have one in each of my vehicles and have placed one in each of the
yachts I sail on.  Take the load off a dead car battery (turn off the
interior lights) and the bagphone will operate for hours unless the
battery is shorted or exploded.

My condolences on your loss-of-service...I lost mine a few years ago when
I caught my competitor, red handed, monitoring my business phone calls on
his scanner.  That's my reason for digital.

I'm using the Motorola E815 CDMA on Alltel, here, because it has an
external antenna connector I can plug into my 3 watt/2 watt dual-band bi-
directional DA4000 power amplifier and 9db colinear antenna on top of my
service truck.  It raises the &quot;full power&quot; limit of the little toyphone
back up to bagphone limits on our 800 Mhz CDMA system when I'm out in the
boonies where the towers are STILL quite far apart.  The toyphone is
useless out there without it.

If you are a Verizon customer, please be informed using any amplifier on
their system is &quot;forbidden&quot; by their agreement, recently.  It lowers
revenue.  Alltel says it's ok.  DA4000's price sure has dropped since I
got mine....dammit...(c;

If you are using a phone whos maximum power to its tiny, inefficient
antenna is, say 150 milliwatts when it has been turned up by the system
to full power, its transmitter/antenna at max level make a noise that
covers, say, 1 to 3 km.

But, plug that same phone into a 3W amplifier and high gain antenna on
top of a high vehicle, like my truck, and it's 3W x antenna gain at
altitude signal is MUCH stronger at a MUCH farther distance, and can
create havoc on that same channel in OTHER cells until you get off the
air.  This is why cellular keeps reducing transmitter power from 600mw to
300mw to 150mw to 120mw in more recent times after digital came into use.
We use a propaganda campaign telling Americans how dangerous cellular
phones are to their bodies to get them to accept ever-more-pitifully-
inadequate transmitters.

CDMA used by Verizon/Alltel/Sprint in America, allows 24 simultaneous
users to use each channel, creating 24 revenue streams where only one
existed on AMPS.....providing the system doesn't have to lock out this
channel on this tower because of interference from other users on other
towers, like one running an amplifier and/or more serious antenna with
more range....which reduces revenue/per area/hour to the company.  Your
GSM system also allows multiple users on a single shared channel.

So, solution is to outlaw and punish, same as usual, any users caught
running such legal equipment.....by dumping them from the service.

Unlike you much-smarter Europeans, American cellular companies will never
spend money putting in REPEATER stations to fill in the gaps in coverage,
which is an admission of poor coverage.  They leave the dead hole,
instead.  Every carrier, here in America, has lots of dead holes in less-
profitable areas, especially in the countryside away from profitable
cities.  Users can only add power and antenna up to our FCC government
limit of 3W on 800 Mhz and 2W on PCS 1900 Mhz to shrink these holes in
coverage to more acceptable levels.

If you come to America, notice our other backwards utilities, especially
electric power, which is still strung with wires overhead on poles like a
3rd world poverty-stricken fiefdom, instead of underground like most of
Western Europe enjoys.  It's caused by the same reason...the love of
MONEY.

I do not really get your scenario.

CDMA networks (I must admit that I have no experience with CDMA, but I
do have some with WCDMA which shares some basic rules with CDMA) do only
work properly, if all signals reaching a tower have roughly the same
signal level. To assure this, the network uses power control, meaning
that the network tells each phone what transmit power to use. If the
signal reaching the tower is too strong, the phone is asked to reduce
power, if it is too weak, the phone is asked to speak up. Of course, the
aim is to use as little transmit power as possible.

Also, if in a call, the network has control about what tower the mobile
talks to. The phone measures the signal level of all towers around and
tells the network about the results. The network then directs the phone
to use the tower that provides the strongest signal.

In the end, the phone will always use as little power as possible to
create a signal that is just good enough to be decoded at the nearest
tower. How is that signal supposed to create disturbing interference at
a tower that is further away (in terms of path loss, not necessarily in
terms of miles) than the one your are using?

Well, if those users really cause trouble for the network (which I do
not really see why that would be the case), I can understand the
opererator's wish to keep these users off their system.

I doubt this has much to do with smartness (or the lack thereof) but
rather with the fact that is is very expensive to reach full coverage in
a country as big as yours while there is little revenue to be expected
from putting up base stations in sparsely populated areas.

Germany has over 600 people per square mile, the USA have only 80. On
average, a tower set up in Germany has more than seven times as many
potential users within coverage than an average base station (of the
same type) would have in the US. The operators are not the salvation
army, they need to follow the rules of economics. It just does not make
any sense to set up a tower that is used only for one call per week.

There is one very good reason not to use power amplifiers: they do not
do anything for your downlink path. There is no sense in shouting to the
base station with 3W if you cannot hear the answer because the base

This all works well when the required power is something less than the
full power the phone is capable of.  But, what happens when the full
power isn't enough power to level you with the other phones on the
channel?....

Let's say you are in the countryside, where the towers are still spaced
for AMPS phones running 3 watts.  That is the reality in America.  And,
you have this new toyphone running 150mw to a useless little antenna to
make the phone cute for the teenage girls.  For the company, this is an
ideal phone.  When the system turns the power up to full, the amount of
radiation is very low from the phone.  This low radiation will not
disturb other tower sectors on other towers that have other users, who go
on using the channel unencumbered by your interference.

Now, some smartass like me comes along with his powerful amplifier and
antenna with 30 db more ERP than the phone is supposed to radiate.  I'm
in a fringe of the nearest tower it's connected to, so the system tells
my phone to radiate maximum power to try to level it with the other
channel users.  Having 30 db more available ERP because of the amp and
high gain antenna, my ERP is 1000 times more than the toyphone and its
pitiful cute antenna is alone.  What's going to happen to any other
towers within range of my 1000 times more powerful signal?  I'm going to
be heard, not on one tower very weakly and not at all on other towers.
No, I'm going to be heard by 8 sectors on 4 towers in range of my
powerful station.  The phones are synchronized to ONE sector, or maybe 3
on the same tower.  They are not synchronized across the system to the
other towers that can hear me.  Interference to other stations results,
interference the system cannot ignore.  So, the system switches users off
the channel I'm on onto another channel with no interference.  I've made
this channel useless to 7 other sectors while I'm on the air with my
amp/antenna.  This is why I don't plug the phone into it if I can help
it.  There's no sense poking a stick at the dragon requiring his reaction
just because you can.  I only connect the amp in the boondocks way away
from the city.  It makes my phone usable in places it wouldn't, the
reason for the amp/antenna in the first place.

The LOWER limit of RF output is also an issue when the phone is plugged
into an amp.  The power the phone can be switched to has a lower limit as
well.  I think it's something like 20mw.  When I'm looking at the tower
with only the phone, this is my ERP on the crap antenna.  If I'm plugged
into the amp/antenna with 30 db of gain, the lower limit of the phone's
output is 20 watts ERP.  This causes my signal to be FAR stronger than
other users on my channel.  The amp/antenna system's gain is fixed.  It's
also near linear.  So, I'm riding by the tower swamping the tower's
receiver with my 20 watt ERP monster, blanking out the other users if the
system receiver cannot recover from my blast before the next guy in line
transmits his burst of data.  His call drops.  So, it is not nice to have
the amp plugged in when you are in a good signal area because the system
cannot turn my output power DOWN far enough to compensate for the extra
30 db of ERP.  I think this lower limit, even on just straight phones,
can cause the system troubles from users standing outside right under the
tower.  NO sense in making it worse.....

With a powerful, directional panel antenna at 50 meters altitude, hearing
the tower is never a problem.  Getting a usable signal above the
receiver's noise floor back TO the tower is always the problem.  This
makes the amp valuable.  Come ride with me and I'll show it to you.  The
amp/antenna's gain and position higher up OUTSIDE of the metal body far
intensifies the signal from the tower, too.  On the phone's test page
display, it's about 30 db when the signal is below -95 dbm.  Plugging the
phone into it when the phone is in a no service condition, almost always
results in the phone locking to a tower with more signal than -90 dbm,
with the resulting solid phone calls.  Even if the path to the tower is
mostly multipath reflections off terrain and tall objects, the
amp/antenna makes the trip.  It rises you up over the noise floor of the
receiver and over the din of other users on your channel.....just like
plugging the bagphone into the external antenna of the car used to clear
up your AMPS signal.

Not much as there shouldn't be any. You said you're in a fringe of the
nearest tower, which is why you're radiating at full power. If that is
just enough to reach the nearest tower, your signal must be too weak to
be decoded by the second nearest tower. So how is a signal too weak for
decoding going to cause interference at the second tower?

That should be prevented by power control. Why would the phone need to
be syncronized to a sector to not cause interference at it? I would

only one tower.

If the range of power control is really only 8.75dB on CDMA, then I
agree that this is a valid point. But I strongly doubt that. IIRC, the
power of an RF signal at the receiver side rises by 6dB every time the
distance is halved. Therefore, the system would be unable to keep the
signals from phones closer to the tower than approx. 1/3rd of the cell
range level with those at the edge of the cell. That seems pretty
unacceptable. I don't really know about CDMA, but in WCDMA (UMTS), the
power control range is 80dB. With an 80dB range, your power could still
be tuned down to a level of 50dB below that of an unamplified phone
(that would be 1.5µW), meaning that you can come be pretty close to the
tower and still cause no damage.

In the end, I don't see a commercial benefit for the operator to ban the
use of amplifiers. In the end, if you can make a call (and pay for it)
that you couldn't without the amplifier, that should be just fine for
the operator.

Maybe the ban is to prevent liabilities issues (&quot;I used your network
with an amplifier and now my brain is fried I want 1 trillion Dollars in
damages!&quot;) or they are afraid of interference caused to other
frequencies caused by non linear amps or whatever...

The antenna does improve up- and downlink path as well, that's for sure.
But the power amplifier only improves the uplink path.

However, there is one thing I did not think about when I wrote the
previous posting: The interference situation for you (on the
countryside) will most likely be much more relaxed compared to the that
of the base station (in the city). Therefore, it may be worthwile for
you to put more power in the uplink as the base station puts into the
downlink...

The amps also have built-in preamps for the receivers on the other side of
their duplexers.  I'm not much of a preamp fan because it's a hoax.  The
noise floor of the new receivers is below the sun and heat noise of the
parking lot, in the daytime, so the preamp just amplifies both the signal
and the noise, not really improving the signal-to-noise ratio.  The
transmit power amp, on the other hand DOES improve the signal-to-noise
ratio the tower hears from me.
