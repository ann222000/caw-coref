I know certain people are on their French hating thing.  If you read the
column with an open mind, you'll see Krugman has a point.  The one point
Krugman misses is that the US covers a lot more territory.  The population
is a lot more spread out.  It's still no excuse for the cities though.

The French Connections

By PAUL KRUGMAN
Published: July 23, 2007

There was a time when everyone thought that the Europeans and the Japanese
were better at business than we were. In the early 1990s airport bookstores
were full of volumes with samurai warriors on their covers, promising to
teach you the secrets of Japanese business success. Lester Thurow's 1992
book, &quot;Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe and
America,&quot; which spent more than six months on the Times best-seller list,
predicted that Europe would win.

Then it all changed, and American despondency turned into triumphalism.
Partly this was because the Clinton boom contrasted so sharply with Europe's
slow growth and Japan's decade-long slump. Above all, however, our new
confidence reflected the rise of the Internet. Jacques Chirac complained
that the Internet was an &quot;Anglo-Saxon network,&quot; and he had a point - France,
like most of Europe except Scandinavia, lagged far behind the U.S. when it
came to getting online.

What most Americans probably don't know is that over the last few years the
situation has totally reversed. As the Internet has evolved - in particular,
as dial-up has given way to broadband connections using DSL, cable and other
high-speed links - it's the United States that has fallen behind.

The numbers are startling. As recently as 2001, the percentage of the
population with high-speed access in Japan and Germany was only half that in
the United States. In France it was less than a quarter. By the end of 2006,
however, all three countries had more broadband subscribers per 100 people
than we did.

Even more striking is the fact that our &quot;high speed&quot; connections are
painfully slow by other countries' standards. According to the Information
Technology and Innovation Foundation, French broadband connections are, on
average, more than three times as fast as ours. Japanese connections are a
dozen times faster. Oh, and access is much cheaper in both countries than it
is here.

As a result, we're lagging in new applications of the Internet that depend
on high speed. France leads the world in the number of subscribers to
Internet TV; the United States isn't even in the top 10.

What happened to America's Internet lead? Bad policy. Specifically, the
United States made the same mistake in Internet policy that California made
in energy policy: it forgot - or was persuaded by special interests to
ignore - the reality that sometimes you can't have effective market
competition without effective regulation.

You see, the world may look flat once you're in cyberspace - but to get
there you need to go through a narrow passageway, down your phone line or
down your TV cable. And if the companies controlling these passageways can
behave like the robber barons of yore, levying whatever tolls they like on
those who pass by, commerce suffers.

America's Internet flourished in the dial-up era because federal regulators
didn't let that happen - they forced local phone companies to act as common
carriers, allowing competing service providers to use their lines. Clinton
administration officials, including Al Gore and Reed Hundt, the chairman of
the Federal Communications Commission, tried to ensure that this open
competition would continue - but the telecommunications giants sabotaged
their efforts, while The Wall Street Journal's editorial page ridiculed them
as people with the minds of French bureaucrats.

And when the Bush administration put Michael Powell in charge of the F.C.C.,
the digital robber barons were basically set free to do whatever they liked.
As a result, there's little competition in U.S. broadband - if you're lucky,
you have a choice between the services offered by the local cable monopoly
and the local phone monopoly. The price is high and the service is poor, but
there's nowhere else to go.

Meanwhile, as a recent article in Business Week explains, the real French
bureaucrats used judicious regulation to promote competition. As a result,
French consumers get to choose from a variety of service providers who offer
reasonably priced Internet access that's much faster than anything I can
get, and comes with free voice calls, TV and Wi-Fi.

It's too early to say how much harm the broadband lag will do to the U.S.
economy as a whole. But it's interesting to learn that health care isn't the
only area in which the French, who can take a pragmatic approach because
they aren't prisoners of free-market ideology, simply do things better.

The Washington Post
Sarkozy's New Europeans

By Anne Applebaum
Tuesday, May 1, 2007; A17

To anyone steeped in the thousand-year history of Anglo-French enmity
-- that bitter struggle over power, influence and the edibility of
snails -- the highlight of France's presidential election campaign was
surely the speech that Nicolas Sarkozy, the center-right candidate
(and now the very precarious front-runner) gave this year in London.
Standing in the heart of London's financial district, Sarkozy heaped
compliments upon his country's historic enemy. The British capital
was, he said, a &quot;town that seems more and more prosperous and dynamic
every time I come here.&quot; More important, it had become &quot;one of the
great French cities.&quot; He understood, furthermore, that hundreds of
thousands of Frenchmen had moved to Britain because &quot;they are
risk-takers, and risk is a bad word&quot; in France. With distinctly
un-English passion (some things never change) he pleaded with them:

&quot;Come home, because together we will make France a great country where
everything will be possible, where fathers won't fear for the future
of their children, and where everyone will be able to make their plans
come true, and be responsible for their own destiny.&quot;

Unfortunately, it seems that even a Sarkozy victory in the final round
of voting on Sunday won't persuade all of the 2 million-plus French
exiles to go home. Asked by a French polling company, TNS Sofres, &quot;Are
you satisfied with your life abroad?&quot; 93 percent of French ?migr?s
surveyed recently said &quot;yes.&quot; Asked, &quot;When do you expect to return to
France?&quot; 25 percent answered &quot;never.&quot;

To Americans, who've become used to the idea that people take jobs far
from home, that people move to places where the economy is better and
that consequently some cities shrink (St. Louis) while others grow
(Los Angeles), there is nothing odd about the fact that the French now
vote with their feet. There are better-paying jobs in London, taxes
are lower in London, the economy grows faster in London: C'est la vie
-- and tough luck for Paris. But Europeans have not, historically,
been quite so mobile. Even a decade ago, tradition and sentiment kept
people at home; legal and linguistic barriers made it hard to move,
even if they wanted to go.

Thanks to the European Union, which has opened borders and eliminated
employment barriers, it is now not only possible to move, it is
downright easy. And not only for the French: Something like a million
Poles have left home since Poland joined the European Union in 2004,
largely for England and Ireland. Unlike France, Poland is booming. But
as in France, high taxes and complex regulations mean that jobs for
young Poles are still too scarce and badly paid. Abroad, young Poles
earn more and are treated better.

When they come back (if they come back) they'll demand no less. The
plumbers in Warsaw already expect to be paid something remarkably
close to what plumbers are paid in Berlin -- that is, if you can find
a plumber in Warsaw at all.

All of this is, of course, precisely what previous generations of
European politicians have feared. For the past decade, French, German
and other European leaders have tried to unify European tax laws and
regulations, the better to &quot;even out the playing field&quot; -- or
(depending on your point of view) to make life equally difficult
everywhere. The emigration patterns of the past decade -- and the past
five years in particular -- prove that that effort has failed.
Sarkozy's election campaign, if successful, might put the final nail
in the coffin.

The political and economic consequences of this new mobility could be
quite profound. Countries such as Poland and France may soon be forced
to scrap those regulations and taxes that hamper employment, however
much the French unions and the Polish bureaucracy want to keep them:
If they don't, their young people won't come home. Leaders in those
countries may also have to alter their rhetoric. Sarkozy's Socialist
opponent, S?gol?ne Royal, now uses words such as &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; at
least some of the time, too.

Down the road, there could be cultural consequences as well. A few
weeks ago, I wrote about the European Union's failure to create
anything resembling a meaningful European &quot;Idea.&quot; Almost by accident,
the European Union may have created a new kind of European citizen
instead: mobile, English-speaking, Internet-using, perhaps with the
same nostalgia for Krakow or Dijon that first-generation New Yorkers
feel for Missouri or Mississippi but nevertheless willing to live
pretty much anywhere. Sarkozy is the first European politician to
appeal directly to these new Europeans. Even if he loses, he probably
won't be the last.

So if the private market will provide better more advanced
state-of-the-art care for those willing to pay, how will that prevent
some from going bankrupt who are dissatisfied with the inferior
healthcare provided and paid for by the government, and who thus turn
to the private sector even if it means spending everything they have

&gt;The French Connections

&gt;By PAUL KRUGMAN
&gt;Published: July 23, 2007

&gt;There was a time when everyone thought that the Europeans and the Japanese
&gt;were better at business than we were. In the early 1990s airport bookstores
&gt;were full of volumes with samurai warriors on their covers, promising to
&gt;teach you the secrets of Japanese business success. Lester Thurow's 1992
&gt;book, &quot;Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe and
&gt;America,&quot; which spent more than six months on the Times best-seller list,
&gt;predicted that Europe would win.

&gt;Then it all changed, and American despondency turned into triumphalism.
&gt;Partly this was because the Clinton boom contrasted so sharply with Europe's
&gt;slow growth and Japan's decade-long slump. Above all, however, our new
&gt;confidence reflected the rise of the Internet. Jacques Chirac complained
&gt;that the Internet was an &quot;Anglo-Saxon network,&quot; and he had a point - France,
&gt;like most of Europe except Scandinavia, lagged far behind the U.S. when it
&gt;came to getting online.

&gt;What most Americans probably don't know is that over the last few years the
&gt;situation has totally reversed. As the Internet has evolved - in particular,
&gt;as dial-up has given way to broadband connections using DSL, cable and other
&gt;high-speed links - it's the United States that has fallen behind.

&gt;The numbers are startling. As recently as 2001, the percentage of the
&gt;population with high-speed access in Japan and Germany was only half that in
&gt;the United States. In France it was less than a quarter. By the end of 2006,
&gt;however, all three countries had more broadband subscribers per 100 people
&gt;than we did.

&gt;Even more striking is the fact that our &quot;high speed&quot; connections are
&gt;painfully slow by other countries' standards. According to the Information
&gt;Technology and Innovation Foundation, French broadband connections are, on
&gt;average, more than three times as fast as ours. Japanese connections are a
&gt;dozen times faster. Oh, and access is much cheaper in both countries than it
&gt;is here.

&gt;As a result, we're lagging in new applications of the Internet that depend
&gt;on high speed. France leads the world in the number of subscribers to
&gt;Internet TV; the United States isn't even in the top 10.

AN FCC COMMISSIONER TEACHES KRUGMAN A THING OR TWO ABOUT BROADBAND

The numbers are startling. As recently as 2001, the percentage
of the population with high-speed access in Japan and Germany
was only half that in the United States. In France it was less
than a quarter. By the end of 2006, however, all three
countries had more broadband subscribers per 100 people than
we did.

Even more striking is the fact that our “high speed”
connections are painfully slow by other countries’ standards.
According to the Information Technology and Innovation
Foundation, French broadband connections are, on average, more
than three times as fast as ours. Japanese connections are a
dozen times faster. Oh, and access is much cheaper in both
countries than it is here.

As a result, we’re lagging in new applications of the Internet
that depend on high speed. France leads the world in the
number of subscribers to Internet TV; the United States isn’t
even in the top 10.

What happened to America’s Internet lead? Bad policy.

Here's McDowell in this morning's Wall Street Journal:

Exhibit A for the alarmists are statistics from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD
says the U.S. has dropped from 12th in the world in broadband
subscribers per 100 residents to 15th.

The OECD's methodology is seriously flawed, however. According
to an analysis by the Phoenix Center, if all OECD countries
including the U.S. enjoyed 100% broadband penetration -- with
all homes and businesses being connected -- our rank would fall
to 20th. The U.S. would be deemed a relative failure because
the OECD methodology measures broadband connections per capita,
putting countries with larger household sizes at a statistical
disadvantage.

The OECD also overlooks that the U.S. is the largest broadband
market in the world, with over 65 million subscribers -- more
than twice the number of America's closest competitor. We got
there because of our superior household adoption rates.
According to several recent surveys, the average percentage of
U.S. households taking broadband is about 42%; the EU average is
23%.

Furthermore, the OECD does not weigh a country's geographic size
relative to its population density, which matters because more
consumers may live farther from the pipes. Only one country
above the U.S. on the OECD list (Canada) stretches from one end
of a continent to another like we do. Only one country above us
on this list is at least 75% rural, like the U.S. In fact, 13 of
the 14 countries that the OECD ranks higher are significantly
smaller than the U.S.

And if we compare many of our states individually with some
countries that are allegedly beating us in the broadband race, we
are actually winning. Forty-three American states have a higher
household broadband adoption rate than all but five EU countries.
Even large rural western states such as Montana, Wyoming,
Colorado and both Dakotas exhibit much stronger household
broadband adoption rates than France or Britain. Even if we use
the OECD's flawed methodology, New Jersey has a higher
penetration rate than fourth-ranked Korea. Alaska is more
broadband-saturated than France.

The OECD conclusions really unravel when we look at wireless
services, especially Wi-Fi. One-third of the world's Wi-Fi hot
spots are in the U.S., but Wi-Fi is not included in the OECD
study unless it is used in a so-called &quot;fixed wireless&quot; setting.
I can't recall ever seeing any fixed wireless users cemented into
a coffee shop, airport or college campus. Most American Wi-Fi
users do so with personal portable devices. It is difficult to
determine how many wireless broadband users are online at any
given moment, since they may not qualify as &quot;subscribers&quot; to
anyone's service.

In short, the OECD data do not include all of the ways Americans
can make high-speed connections to the Internet, therefore
omitting millions of American broadband users. Europe, with its
more regulatory approach, may actually end up being the laggard
because of latent weaknesses in its broadband market. It lacks
adequate competition among alternative broadband platforms to
spur the faster speeds that consumers and an ever-expanding
Internet will require.

Europe also suffers from a dearth of robust competition from
cable modem and fiber. Cable penetration is only about 21% of
households. In the U.S., cable is available to 94% of all
households. Also, the U.S. is home to the world's fastest
fiber-to-home market, with a 99% annual growth rate in
subscribers compared with a relatively anemic 13% growth rate in
Europe.

In fact, the European Competitive Telecommunications
Association reported last fall that Europe is experiencing a
significant slowdown in the annual growth rate of broadband
subscriptions, falling to 14% from 23% annual growth. Growth
stalled in a number of countries, including Denmark and Belgium
(4% in each country). And France -- a relative star --
exhibited just 10% growth. Yet all of these nations are
&quot;ahead&quot; of us on the much-talked-about OECD chart.

Here in the U.S., the country that is allegedly &quot;falling
behind,&quot; broadband adoption is accelerating. Government
studies confirm that America's broadband growth rate has
jumped from 32% per year to 52%. With new numbers expected
shortly, we anticipate a continued positive trend. Criticisms
of our definition of &quot;broadband&quot; being too lax are already
irrelevant as over 50 million subscribers are in the 1.5 to 3.0
megabits-per-second &quot;fast lane.&quot;
