9/11: How Bush Has Betrayed Us
Submitted by Rick Perlstein on September 10, 2007 - 7:04pm.
Like everyone else, I'll never forget Tuesday, September 11, 2001. I was
living in Brooklyn then, and breathed air polluted by the ash from
incinerated flesh. But I'll also never forget Friday, September 14. That was
the day my Brooklyn neighborhood held its candlelight vigil. Our bodies
spanned Seventh Avenue from sidewalk to sidewalk, for over a dozen blocks.
I'll never forget the next morning either, because that's what really made
me cry. I nearly broke my neck, you see, from all the leftover candle wax
coating the sidewalk. So many people feeling the same thing together:
remember the solidarity?
Solidarity. That was America's, and the world's, immediate response to
September 11. Christopher Hayes wrote a classic essay on this forgotten word
last year. He quoted the dictionary definition: &quot;The fact or quality, on the
part of communities...of being perfectly united or at lone in some respects,
.esp. in the interests, sympathies, or aspirations.&quot;
The concept, wrote Hayes, &quot;embodies a powerful moral aspiration to realize
the fundamental fellowship of humankind.&quot; He quoted Rebecca Solnit on the
&quot;Uses of Disaster&quot;: &quot;Again and again, we see a latent civil society-a
community-arising from the ruins of some disaster and becoming the grounds
for connection and joy.&quot;
Isn't that exactly what it was?
&quot;We Are All Americans Now,&quot; a French newspaper proclaimed. And we Americans
were all New Yorkers: &quot;Gentiles in Georgia weeping for dead Jews in
Brooklyn,&quot; is how Chris Hayes put it. And to the victims' families, we New
Yorkers all shouted, We are all your brothers and sisters.
Every day, we scanned the thousands of posters taped to every lamppost and
fence, the faces of the missing. And for months, we scanned the faces of our
neighbors: Who did you know? How can we help? And by the way, did I tell you
today how glad I am to have you around? We immediately ached to serve: the
lines at our hospitals to give blood snaked around the block, until they
told us there were not enough survivors to need much blood, and told us to
go home.
And here was another rather neat expression of solidarity: Liberals like me
rallied around a conservative president. Remember the 90 percent approval
rating? A lot of leftists in that 90 percent. We rallied, too, around his
chosen response: a military strike against the terrorists' havens in
Afghanistan. I wrote about that left near-consensus at the time, in the New
York Observer. The late Ellen Wills (I tried to convey how left she was by
noting that she &quot;still espouses the old Marxist-Freudian doctrine of the
revolutionary potential of free love&quot;) said, &quot;To do nothing is
unacceptable.&quot; A Queens Green Party official told me, &quot;If this was a short
period and they got the terrorist network, I would be able to forgive them.&quot;
Yes, the left chose solidarity with the right, the lambs lying down with the
lions. Because these conservatives promised mercy would accompany the
required rough justice. President Bush promised of the Afghanistan campaign:
&quot;We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to
live by them.&quot; Rep. Dana Rohrbacher, the preeminent fire-breathing Orange
County conservative, promised, &quot;The new moral standard has got to be that
noncombatants will not be attacked. We will not kill unarmed innocent people
in order to achieve a political objective.&quot;
The President asked for the power he said he needed to fight the terrorists.
And in solidarity, Democrats in Congress chose trust. A September 13 bill
reforming FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, extending new
wiretapping and electronic surveillance capabilities the President specified
he would need, passed by voice vote, without debate. The authorization of
force passed the Senate unanimously. The standing ovation at his joint
session of Congress was unanimous. Al Gore, who'd had his presidency stolen
by Bush, stood up at an Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner and said:
&quot;Regardless of party, regardless of ideology, regardless of religion or race
or ethnicity, there are no divisions in this country where our response to
the war on terrorism is concerned. We are united... George W. Bush is my
commander in chief.&quot;
The PATRIOT Act passed 98 to 1 and 357 to 66. Even Bush got into the
reconciliation act, after an early stumble in which he called the War on
Terrorism a &quot;crusade.&quot; Remember &quot;Islam means peace&quot;?
And guess what? Some on the right hated it-hated the solidarity. They wanted
Bush to be a divider. Here was Jonah Goldberg:
Much of the country has grown to love President Bush since Sept. 11, giving
him the highest and most sustained approval ratings of any president since
polling began. Good for him. Me, I liked the pre-9/11 Bush better....
Prior to Sept. 11, the dominant lesson Bush and his adviser Karl Rove
learned from Poppa Bush's experience was to keep the base happy. This didn't
require doing everything the conservative rank-and-file wanted; governing,
after all, always requires making compromises with political realities. But
it did require caring about what they thought.
Unfortunately, since Sept. 11, the Bushies have taken down the proverbial
&quot;it's the base, stupid&quot; sign from the office bulletin board and replaced it
with &quot;it's the lead, stupid.&quot;
In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the reigning rule has switched from defend
your base to don't blow your approval ratings. The rationale seems to be
that the conservative base is safe because Bush is doing a good job on the
war on terror and this in turn gives him room to run to the middle on a host
of issues.
That was May of 2002. Of course Goldberg's lament was premature. It wouldn't
be four months before he started selling his radical monstrosity in Iraq.
They simultaneously made the Democrats' routine request to make the new
Department of Homeland Security a place where solidarity was not
banned-simply trying to extend ordinary civil service labor protections to
workers newly under its umbrella-just the campaign issue they needed to drum
up hatred of Democrats for the 2002 off-year elections: &quot;union bosses strive
to use the war on terror as a cover for a new drive for power,&quot; is how they
responded. Even though the Department of Homeland Security was the
Democrats' idea, an idea the Republicans originally fought. That, recall,
was how legless Vietnam veteran Max Cleland, among others, was defeated.
With TV ad picturing Cleland with Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. For
saying unions had a place in the federal government. Solidarity forever.
Goldberg needn't have feared Bush would dare govern in the interests of
national unity. Indeed, Goldberg wasn't even correct when he wrote that.
Bush was already defecating upon the unity that tragedy had accidentally
bestowed upon him by violating the very eavesdropping law shouted through
Congress in a full-throated cry of unity, as America happend to learn over
three years later, seretly authorizing the National Security Agency to
eavesdrop on Americans without a court-approved warrant.
Of course Bush never meant it. He never meant to embrace solidarity at all.
September 11, 2001? It's just a sickening political prop.

No, he didn't lie.

It's just that everything he talked about was irrelevant.

Who gives a shit if Anbar Province is happy?  Anbar contains 5 percent of
the population and nothing else.  Meanwhile, the rest of Iraq -- especially
the capital of Baghdad -- continues to descend into madness and civil war.

When you are a shill for the Bushies you are under suspicion of bull
shitting the American people. It's not anything we invented, it's the
history or hadn't you noticed. Every major announcemnt about the war has
been WRONG. Why should what Betrayus says be any different?

A partial list: Saddam can fly drones here in 15 min.. Saddam is an
immediate threat to the US. Saddam met with Al Qaeda. Saddam has WMD. Saddam
has a nuclear program. We will be greeted as liberators. They will throw
flowers at our feet. They are a bunch of Dead enders. The insurgency is in
its last throes. Mission accomplished. Major military operations have ended.
and on and on it goes for four and a half years.

The funny thing is people like you who buy into the continuing BULL SHIT
without the slightest critial look at what you are hearing even with all of
that history. How many times do you have to be fooled before it dawns on you
that things are not quite as you are told?

Betrayus has no answers and no endpoint. He spews meaningless smoke and that
is a betrayal of the American people who are spending $3Billion a week on
this crap for NO REASON. Betrayus is a hapless pawn who Bush will soon throw
under the Bus like he has done to the other generals. Just watch!

Selective slicing and dicing...

The public might have, then, also enjoyed the NPR news headline today
happily announcing that the monthly balance of trade had 'declined' to
something like a 52 Billion usd monthly loss...

...versus last month's 52 Billion usd loss.

The difference being .03 of one percent decrease of loss compared to
the previous month....
Which is even less than (un-named) analysts had predicted !

Hurrah! The union is saved.
Never mind that extrapolated 625 Billion annual loss.

I don't remember any of the military backing up Cheney's and
neocon thinktank Iran-war propaganda when Petraeus's
predecessor George Casey was in charge. When I heard
Petraeus charge Iran being involved in a Sunni attack in
Kirkuk I'd have to say I don't believe it. Iran's interests
are in keeping the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution
in Iraq (SCIRI) in power in Iraq in the elections that we set up
there.

I'm not a Democrat but I think Petraeus is playing ball with
the administration's attempts to lie our soldiers into a war
for the percieved better interests of Israel and that Democrats
wouldn't dare call him or the administration out on it.

That's my take on it.

Petraeus: &quot;I Don't Know&quot; If My Iraq Policy Makes America Safer

Sen. John Warner (R-VA) questions Gen. David Petraeus:

WARNER: I hope in the recesses of your heart that you know that
strategy will continue the casualties, stress on our forces, stress on
military families, stress on all Americans. Are you able to say at
this time, if we continue what you have laid before the Congress, this
strategy, that if you continue, you are making America safer?

PETRAEUS: Sir, I believe that this is indeed the best course of
action to achieve our objections in Iraq.

WARNER: Does that make America safer?

PETRAEUS: Sir, I don't know actually. I have not sat down and
sorted out in my own mind. What I have focused on and been riveted on
is how to accomplish the mission of the Multinational Force in Iraq.

Cherry picking from the hearing is another form of spin, or it's just
another way of lying. If you want truth hear the general out, something you
libs never do!

&gt; Petraeus: &quot;I Don't Know&quot; If My Iraq Policy Makes America Safer

&gt; Sen. John Warner (R-VA) questions Gen. David Petraeus:

&gt;    WARNER: I hope in the recesses of your heart that you know that
&gt; strategy will continue the casualties, stress on our forces, stress on
&gt; military families, stress on all Americans. Are you able to say at
&gt; this time, if we continue what you have laid before the Congress, this
&gt; strategy, that if you continue, you are making America safer?

&gt;    PETRAEUS: Sir, I believe that this is indeed the best course of
&gt; action to achieve our objections in Iraq.

&gt;    WARNER: Does that make America safer?

&gt;    PETRAEUS: Sir, I don't know actually. I have not sat down and
&gt; sorted out in my own mind. What I have focused on and been riveted on
&gt; is how to accomplish the mission of the Multinational Force in Iraq.

They originated using the  word &quot;traitor&quot;, not MoveOn.

&gt;I don't remember any of the military backing up Cheney's and

&gt;Petraeus charge Iran being involved in a Sunni attack in
&gt;Kirkuk I'd have to say I don't believe it. Iran's interests
&gt;are in keeping the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution

&gt;there.

&gt;I'm not a Democrat but I think Petraeus is playing ball with
&gt;the administration's attempts to lie our soldiers into a war
&gt;for the percieved better interests of Israel and that Democrats
&gt;wouldn't dare call him or the administration out on it.

&gt;That's my take on it.

OK, It was Tal Afar that Petraeus charged Iran with staging
and not Kirkuk.

http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/YAT142503.htm

And I do remember some military joining in blaming Iran for
IEDs but Casey never backed them up on that.

Just the same, that's a Sunni attack against Shia. Petraeus
wants us to believe that Iran is involved with a Sunni attack
against the Shia who Iran does, in fact, back in Iraq.

Do you believe that MioMyo? Do you also believe that Iran backs
attacks and assasinations on polititians who belong to SCIRI.
Doesn't make sense MioMyo.

I don't remember Casey lying for the administration (probably
why they dropped him) but I think that Petraeus is.....straight up.
And he's not very good at it.

&gt;    Fallon Derided Petraeus, Opposed the Surge
&gt;    By Gareth Porter
&gt;    Inter Press Service

&gt;    Wednesday 12 September 2007

&gt;    Washington - In sharp contrast to the lionisation of Gen. David
&gt; Petraeus
&gt; by members of the U.S. Congress during his testimony this week, Petraeus's
&gt; superior, Admiral William Fallon, chief of the Central Command (CENTCOM),
&gt; derided Petraeus as a sycophant during their first meeting in Baghdad last
&gt; March, according to Pentagon sources familiar with reports of the meeting.

Whoa... according to unnamed sourced, none the less!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    Fallon told Petraeus that he considered him to be &quot;an ass-kissing
&gt; little
&gt; chickenshit&quot; and added, &quot;I hate people like that&quot;, the sources say. That
">

IOW, we have an ****Opinion****  as so stated by some mysterious unnamed
source!

LOL

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; remark reportedly came after Petraeus began the meeting by making remarks
&gt; that Fallon interpreted as trying to ingratiate himself with a superior.

&gt;    That extraordinarily contentious start of Fallon's mission to Baghdad
&gt; led to more meetings marked by acute tension between the two commanders.
&gt; Fallon went on develop his own alternative to Petraeus's recommendation
&gt; for
&gt; continued high levels of U.S. troops in Iraq during the summer.

&gt;    The enmity between the two commanders became public knowledge when the
&gt; Washington Post reported Sep. 9 on intense conflict within the
&gt; administration over Iraq. The story quoted a senior official as saying
&gt; that
&gt; referring to &quot;bad relations&quot; between them is &quot;the understatement of the
&gt; century&quot;.

&gt;    Fallon's derision toward Petraeus reflected both the CENTCOM
&gt; commander's
&gt; personal distaste for Petraeus's style of operating and their fundamental
&gt; policy differences over Iraq, according to the sources.

&gt;    The policy context of Fallon's extraordinarily abrasive treatment of
&gt; his
&gt; subordinate was Petraeus's agreement in February to serve as front man for
&gt; the George W. Bush administration's effort to sell its policy of
&gt; increasing
&gt; U.S. troop strength in Iraq to Congress.

&gt;    In a highly unusual political role for an officer who had not yet taken
&gt; command of a war, Petraeus was installed in the office of Minority Leader
&gt; Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, in early February just before
&gt; the Senate debated Bush's troop increase. According to a report in The
&gt; Washington Post Feb. 7, senators were then approached on the floor and
&gt; invited to go McConnell's office to hear Petraeus make the case for the
&gt; surge policy.

&gt;    Fallon was strongly opposed to Petraeus's role as pitch man for the
&gt; surge policy in Iraq adopted by Bush in December as putting his own
&gt; interests ahead of a sound military posture in the Middle East and
&gt; Southwest
&gt; Asia - the area for which Fallon's CENTCOM is responsible.

&gt;    The CENTCOM commander believed the United States should be withdrawing
&gt; troops from Iraq urgently, largely because he saw greater dangers
&gt; elsewhere
&gt; in the region. &quot;He is very focused on Pakistan,&quot; said a source familiar
&gt; with
&gt; Fallon's thinking, &quot;and trying to maintain a difficult status quo with
&gt; Iran.&quot;

&gt;    By the time Fallon took command of CENTCOM in March, Pakistan had
&gt; become
&gt; the main safe haven for Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda to plan and carry out
&gt; its
&gt; worldwide operations, as well as being an extremely unstable state with
&gt; both
&gt; nuclear weapons and the world's largest population of Islamic extremists.

&gt;    Plans for continued high troop levels in Iraq would leave no troops
&gt; available for other contingencies in the region.

&gt;    Fallon was reported by the New York Times to have been determined to
&gt; achieve results &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. The notion of a long war, in
&gt; contrast, seemed to connote an extended conflict in which Iraq was but a
&gt; chapter.

&gt;    Fallon also expressed great scepticism about the basic assumption
&gt; underlying the surge strategy, which was that it could pave the way for
&gt; political reconciliation in Iraq. In the lead story Sep. 9, The Washington
&gt; Post quoted a &quot;senior administration official&quot; as saying that Fallon had
&gt; been &quot;saying from Day One, 'This isn't working.' &quot;

&gt;    One of Fallon's first moves upon taking command of CENTCOM was to order
&gt; his subordinates to avoid the term &quot;long war&quot; - a phrase Bush and
&gt; Secretary
&gt; of Defence Robert M. Gates had used to describe the fight against
&gt; terrorism.

&gt;    Fallon was signaling his unhappiness with the policy of U.S. occupation
&gt; of Iraq for an indeterminate period. Military sources explained that
&gt; Fallon
&gt; was concerned that the concept of a long war would alienate Middle East
&gt; publics by suggesting that U.S. troops would remain in the region
&gt; indefinitely.

&gt;    During the summer, according to the Post Sep. 9 report, Fallon began to
&gt; develop his own plans for redefine the U.S. mission in Iraq, including a
&gt; plan for withdrawal of three-quarters of the U.S. troop strength by the
&gt; end
&gt; of 2009.

&gt;    The conflict between Fallon and Petraeus over Iraq came to a head in
&gt; early September. According to the Post story, Fallon expressed views on
&gt; Iraq
&gt; that were sharply at odds with those of Petraeus in a three-way
&gt; conversation
&gt; with Bush on Iraq the previous weekend. Petraeus argued for keeping as
&gt; many
&gt; troops in Iraq for as long as possible to cement any security progress,
&gt; but
&gt; Fallon argued that a strategic withdrawal from Iraq was necessary to have
&gt; sufficient forces to deal with other potential threats in the region.

&gt;    Fallon's presentation to Bush of the case against Petraeus's
&gt; recommendation for keeping troop levels in Iraq at the highest possible
&gt; level just before Petraeus was to go public with his recommendations was
&gt; another sign that Petraeus's role as chief spokesperson for the surge
&gt; policy
&gt; has created a deep rift between him and the nation's highest military
&gt; leaders. Bush presumably would not have chosen to invite an opponent of
&gt; the
&gt; surge policy to make such a presentation without lobbying by the top
&gt; brass.

&gt;    Fallon had a &quot;visceral distaste&quot; for what he regarded as Petraeus's
&gt; sycophantic behaviour in general, which had deeper institutional roots,
&gt; according to a military source familiar with his thinking.

&gt;    Fallon is a veteran of 35 years in the Navy, operating in an
&gt; institutional culture in which an officer is expected to make enemies in
&gt; the
&gt; process of advancement. &quot;If you are Navy captain and don't have two or
&gt; three
&gt; enemies, you're not doing your job,&quot; says the source.

&gt;    Fallon acquired a reputation for a willingness to stand up to powerful
&gt; figures during his tenure as commander in chief of the Pacific Command
&gt; from
&gt; February 2005 to March 2007. He pushed hard for a conciliatory line toward
&gt; and China, which put him in conflict with senior military and civilian
&gt; officials with a vested interest in pointing to China as a future rival
&gt; and
&gt; threat.

&gt;    He demonstrated his independence from the White House when he refused
&gt; in
&gt; February to go along with a proposal to send a third naval carrier task
&gt; force to the Persian Gulf, as reported by IPS in May. Fallon questioned
&gt; the
&gt; military necessity for the move, which would have signaled to Iran a
&gt; readiness to go to war. Fallon also privately vowed that there would be no
&gt; war against Iran on his watch, implying that he would quit rather than
&gt; accept such a policy.

&gt;    A crucial element of Petraeus's path of advancement in the Army, on the
&gt; other hand, was through serving as an aide to senior generals. He was
&gt; assistant executive officer to the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Carl Vuono,
&gt; and
&gt; later executive assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Henry
&gt; Shelton. His experience taught him that cultivating senior officers is the
&gt; key to success.

&gt;    The contrasting styles of the two men converged with their conflict
&gt; over
&gt; Iraq to produce one of the most intense clashes between U.S. military
&gt; leaders in recent history.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your total &amp; utter capitulation to having point at all is duly noted

in other words, this is a great war as long as i dont have to sacrifice for

&gt; &gt;    WARNER: I hope in the recesses of your heart that you know that
&gt; &gt; strategy will continue the casualties, stress on our forces, stress on
&gt; &gt; military families, stress on all Americans. Are you able to say at
&gt; &gt; this time, if we continue what you have laid before the Congress, this
&gt; &gt; strategy, that if you continue, you are making America safer?

&gt; &gt;    PETRAEUS: Sir, I believe that this is indeed the best course of
&gt; &gt; action to achieve our objections in Iraq.

&gt; &gt;    WARNER: Does that make America safer?

&gt; &gt;    PETRAEUS: Sir, I don't know actually. I have not sat down and
&gt; &gt; sorted out in my own mind. What I have focused on and been riveted on
&gt; &gt; is how to accomplish the mission of the Multinational Force in Iraq.

WASHINGTON, Sep 12 (IPS) - In sharp contrast to the lionisation of Gen. David
Petraeus by members of the U.S. Congress during his testimony this week,
Petraeus's superior, Admiral William Fallon, chief of the Central Command
(CENTCOM), derided Petraeus as a sycophant during their first meeting in
Baghdad last March, according to Pentagon sources familiar with reports of
the meeting.

Fallon told Petraeus that he considered him to be &quot;an ass-kissing little
chickenshit&quot; and added, &quot;I hate people like that&quot;, the sources say. That remark
reportedly came after Petraeus began the meeting by making remarks that Fallon
interpreted as trying to ingratiate himself with a superior.

certainly not my argument. My point was that it is incorrect to call him
&quot;The Honorable&quot; General Petraeus. It is superfluous. He has the rank of
General, the &quot;honorable&quot; is understood. &quot;Honorable&quot; is only used for
civililians in position of authority over the military like the secretary of
defense, &quot;The Honorable Robert Gates&quot;. You dont even need to mean it.

how long were you in the honorable military service?

Excellent job, keep it up lib. Notably Americans are taking notice that the
left cannot/refuses to debate issues or facts and instead find cute ways to
call those they oppose names. That may work for your ilk here on Usenet, but
when your side demonized Petraeus, they went too far and now both move on

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; frightfully pathetic.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't realize you would argue that military service is Not an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; honorable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &amp; patriotic commitment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Apparently you haven't been paying attention to your fellow neo-cons
&gt;&gt;&gt; who've
&gt;&gt;&gt; started attacking Colin Powell's service to America.

&gt;&gt; Liar, no one ever claimed Powell betrayed his country like you scums on
&gt;&gt; the left did to General Petraeus.

&gt; No, Goofy, no one but Powell himself who belly crawled for forgiveness for
&gt; his part in deceiving the nation
&gt; into Bush's war. MooMoo the Idiot...never misses chance to look
&gt; ridiculous.

Thanks for confirming that monkeyshit's analogy is seriously flawed and
without any logic whatsoever. The fact that you can only attack the
messenger who exposed his fallacy, well that speaks volumes of your
inability for critical thinking.

&gt;&gt; Excellent job, keep it up lib. Notably Americans are taking notice that
&gt;&gt; the left cannot/refuses to debate issues or facts and instead find cute
&gt;&gt; ways to call those they oppose names. That may work for your ilk here on
&gt;&gt; Usenet, but when your side demonized Petraeus, they went too far and now
&gt;&gt; both move on and the dems are desperately trying to limit the damages.

&gt; Is the general such a pussy he can't handle questions?

Do you only suck dick on Sunday's or do you Suck Dick all week long?

Now answer the f*cking question lib.

That is your lesson for the day lib in that some questions are both
inappropriately leading and also falsely assuming.

Further, Petraeus handled himself most admirably and allowed the dems to
meltdown on their own. Obviously you never noticed many of your dems never
asked him a question, or if they did, they only did so after expending their
time with long winded Bush bashing diatribes!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Petraeus's superior, Admiral William Fallon, chief of the Central

&gt;&gt;&gt; the meeting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fallon told Petraeus that he considered him to be &quot;an ass-kissing little

&gt;&gt;&gt; remark

&gt;&gt;&gt; interpreted as trying to ingratiate himself with a superior.

did they ask questions or didnt they? you're incoherent.

certainly doesnt need inbred shitheads like you to come to his aid.
