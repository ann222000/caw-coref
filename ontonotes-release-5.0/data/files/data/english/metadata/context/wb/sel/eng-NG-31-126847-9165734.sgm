U.S. Frustrated by Putin's Grip on Power
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/15/world/europe/15diplo.html?_r=1&amp;th;&amp;e...;
MOSCOW, Oct. 14 - At the gathering of leaders of the Group of 8
industrialized nations in Germany this year, President Bush turned to
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and remarked that the two of
them had outlasted most of their old colleagues from the group's
annual meetings, American officials recalled. Jacques Chirac, Silvio
Berlusconi, Gerhard Schr√∂der and Tony Blair had left or were leaving.

&quot;Next year,&quot; Mr. Putin replied, &quot;it will be only you.&quot;

Mr. Putin's response, for a time, persuaded the Bush administration
that he would keep his word and step down as Russia's president when
his term ends next year, several months before Mr. Bush's own
presidency ends in January 2009.

Now, though, Mr. Putin's plans are far from clear, and as a result,
the administration's hopes that Russia would move toward a freer, more
democratic society have substantially diminished.

Mr. Putin's surprise suggestion last month that he might yet remain in
power - possibly as a newly empowered prime minister, possibly as the
eminence atop the &quot;party of power&quot; - has left the White House stumped.
The administration is uncertain how to deal with a man who has
consolidated power almost exclusively in his own hands, even as Mr.
Bush continues to call Mr. Putin &quot;my friend.&quot;

That is why a certain discomfort regarding Mr. Putin's future hovered
over two days of talks here attended by Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates.

&quot;If you don't have countervailing institutions, then the power of any
one president is problematic for democratic development,&quot; Ms. Rice
said Saturday, raising concerns about the state of Russia's judiciary,
legislative branch and news media, but declining to criticize Mr.
Putin by name.

When asked by reporters more than once and by a human rights advocate
in a meeting at Spaso House, the American ambassador's residence, she
declined to discuss who might lead Russia, formally or informally,
come next year and what that outcome might mean.

At a news conference with the Americans and their Russian
counterparts, the question elicited a smile from Russia's foreign
minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and guffaws from uniformed members of the
general staff sitting in the audience, as if asking it were audacious.

&quot;There's a lot of speculation about who's going to be president,
whether President Putin is going to take any of a number of jobs or no
job at all,&quot; Ms. Rice said later, &quot;and I just think speculating on
that is not going to help.&quot;

Such comments reflect another reality: the powerlessness of the United
States when it comes to prodding Russia in a more democratic
direction, barely six years after Mr. Putin's willingness to reach out
to Mr. Bush after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, seemed to herald a
new era of cooperation.

Mr. Bush, a believer in the personal bonds of diplomacy, said he had
seen in Mr. Putin's eyes a trusted democratic ally in the effort to
curb terrorism. Instead, on Mr. Bush's watch, Russia has slid toward a
more authoritarian system that seems to differ with the United States
on more issues than not.

The administration's occasional scoldings have accomplished little
except to harden anti-American views at the Kremlin and in the state
news media. (A swaggering Mr. Putin opened the discussions on Friday
with a sarcastic harangue over the American plans for missile
defense.)

Along the way, promoting democracy in Russia has largely faded from
the administration's agenda, overtaken by a clear-eyed, pragmatic
effort to defuse the disputes over missile defense, the future of the
two countries' strategic nuclear forces and the array of conventional
forces in Europe.

Those issues, along with Iran's nuclear programs, dominated the
discussions here. A senior official who traveled here, speaking on the
condition of anonymity because diplomacy was involved, said what Mr.
Putin's next steps might be was not a topic in any of the meetings.

Tanya Lokshina, the chairwoman of a Russian human rights organization,
the Demos Center for Information and Research, was among those who met
with Ms. Rice on Saturday. She said that given the focus on security
matters, the meeting with rights campaigners had been mostly symbolic.

She contended that the United States had &quot;lost the high moral ground,&quot;
and thus should join with European countries to make it clear to Mr.
Putin that a drift further away from democracy was unacceptable
diplomatically.

&quot;The American voice alone doesn't work anymore,&quot; she said after the
meeting. &quot;The Russians are not influenced by it.&quot; She said Ms. Rice
had bristled at the criticism, replying sharply, &quot;We never lost the
high moral ground.&quot;

There is a growing sense in the White House that with Mr. Putin's
accretion of power, his ability to dictate his own successor or to
remain the country's ruler in some capacity is unavoidable at this
point.

Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said last week that
he could imagine Mr. Bush turning to his friend and saying, &quot;You
really would be better off, Vladimir, if you really moved a little bit
toward democracy.&quot; But he went on to say that he did not expect a
change.

In fact, senior administration officials find it hard to imagine that
Mr. Putin would step aside and leave the trappings of office to a
successor, even a weakened one, let alone the power he has
concentrated in the presidency. Could Russia conceivably be
represented at the next Group of 8 meeting, or any other important
meeting, by someone who is nominally the head of state, but not the
country's real leader?

Whatever Mr. Putin's ultimate plan, the Bush administration
effectively has no choice but to deal with him until the succession
plays itself out. Ms. Rice said she did not think that the uncertainty
of the process would prevent progress on the disputes at the center of
these latest talks.

She also said, when asked, that she had not misjudged Mr. Putin back
in 2001 when Mr. Bush first met him. &quot;I certainly always read him as
somebody who was going to do what he thought was in the best interest
of his nation and was going to be, in a sense, transparent about
that,&quot; Ms. Rice said. &quot;Where there have been differences, I think it's
because I think we read those interests differently.&quot;
