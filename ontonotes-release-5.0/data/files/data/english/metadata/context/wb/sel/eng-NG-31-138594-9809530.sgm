Okay folks, let's have some fun today!  Got a little prize for who ever
can solve a math riddle.  The first person to respond with the right

Here you go...

There is a bus carrying 7girls.  Each girl has a backpack.  In each
backpack there are 7 BIG cats. For each big cat there are 7 little cats.

John, who taught you how to count pussies?  There are 399 pussies on
the bus, 400 if Sam's driving.

By the way, no one has the correct answer yet for legs on the bus.  It
is not a trick question or anything and no one is even close...???

Nathan:  9,618

Hanna: 0  The Atlantic 10 is not a conference.  However there is an Atlantic
Coast Conference with 2 divisions, atlantic, and coastal, very creative
indeed.

My riddle: If there are 12 teams in the Big 12 conference, and 10 teams in
the Pac 10 Conference, how many teams are in the Big 10 Conference?

No, actually Kurt is right. After doing a little research I think
maybe you asked the question incorrectly.

7 Girls, 2 legs each equals 14 legs.

ONE backpack per girl equals 7 backpacks.

7 Big Cats in each back pack (49 Big Cats total), 4 legs per big cat,
7*7*4 equals 196 legs.

7 Cats per big cat, 4 legs per cat, 49*7*4 equals 1372.

14 + 196 + 1372 = 1582

Yea Kurt.  Smartest pussy I know!

Also @Skip, the A-10 is alive and well with 14 teams including the
Rhode Island and Fordham Rams.  They just don't have football
anymore.  Many A-10 schools are in the Colonial conference for
football only.

The four fathers could be grandfathers and are most definitely son's.

Okay one more...cause I'm bored...

A murderer is condemned to death. He has to choose between three rooms.
The first is full of raging fires, the second is full of assassins with
loaded guns, and the third is full of lions that haven't eaten in 3
years. Which room is safest for him?

No money at all if they circulate the money back into the community as
change for a different customer.  Right?

The answer to Dan's riddle is &quot;almost 7 dollars&quot; because the
counterfeit money is technically worth $0.  So the store basically
gave away an item that cost them &quot;almost 7 dollars&quot;.

The answer to Nathan's riddle about the murderer is that none of the
rooms are safe because he is condemned to die, which is his fate
regardless of his choice.

Oh shoot, re: Dan's riddle, the store also lost the opportunity to
sell the shirt to another person for $20, so they are really out $27.

I say the counterfeit money is irrelevant since money has no intrinsic
value to begin with...it relies only on faith.  I think skip nailed
it...&quot;wrong, they're both marsupials&quot;!!!

Wrong! Not only did the store lose the expensive Guccini brand shirt
it also gave 8 dollars of change to the counterfieter. So the total
lost is almost 15 dollars.
