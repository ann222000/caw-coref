Hey all...

My ADD is acting up...I'm thinking about migrating away from Gmail back to
an IMAP/Exchange-based solution. My biggest reason: easy and flexible mobile
access. Gmail has mobile solutions, but they're a bit anemic (no tagging).
Yes, there are solutions like http://gmobile.phpmagazine.net and
http://glite.sayni.net , but they aren't secure and I figure that I'm asking
for problems by using them. I like to tag my email as I read it...it's a GTD
thing. IMAP/Exchange would allow me to file it as I read it.

But: I would miss multiple labels and Gmail's excellent threaded view. Other
than that, since I use WinMobile, it would make sense. I could put my whole
calendar and task list online as well. Most of what I do on a computer is
moving towards Web 2.0-stuff anyway (research, GDocs, etc.)

Give me some feedback on what y'all are doing.

Pax Vobiscum,
Tory Larson

Tony,

Personally I really like Gmail. I use my Yahoo address mostly for stuff that
I don't intend to keep long term and Gmail for things that I expect will
evolve into discussions, so that all the emails in a thread will be
automatically linked together. that way when someone writes something
cryptic like, &quot;I totally agree. Let's do that&quot; I can go back and see what he
is agreeing to, a major problem with other email systems.

RE portability. The trend in laptops is for lighter and more portable
devices. While I love to play with my T3s and discuss what Apple might do
with the iPhone if it were to develop software that really uses all those
excellent hardware resources, I have to admit I really have not missed not
being connected to the Internet on them as much as I expected. My next
laptop will either be a much lighter and more portable clamshell or a thin
tablet with a full sized screen that links to my bluetooth keyboard and has
a touchscreen and perhaps runs Windows XP Tablet edition (I don't want to
get involved with Vista for at least a year, I have heard too many negatives
from people with much more technical expertise than I have, and yes I
realize that Jeff uses and loves Vista, but he is literally the only person
I know who does).

I personally would keep my calendar in my handheld, however, mainly so that
when an alarm goes off or I am told of some event I want to attend, I have
it handy wherever I am. Some places still do not have online connectivity.
And as a professional writer, I don't see a day when I would put my word
processor on the Internet, I need that handy. But I already do all my email
on the Internet through my browser, and I am in the process of moving all my
finished photos onto the Picassa, and when I do I delete them from my local
hard drive. And I would be quite comfortable with having the rest of Office
besides Word on the Internet since I don't use that often, and I am looking
into backing up the hard drives of my two computers to the Internet rather
than investing in a local disk or tape solution. So I also am moving a lot
to the Internet.

Hi, Tory,

I currently have Gmail forward (and delete) email to my IMAP mail
server. Basically, I use gmail address as my front end for most
business and personal usage, but everything funnels into IMAP, which I
then interface with using either SnapperMail or Thunderbird.

For a time, I tried leaving messages on Gmail as well as having it
forward to IMAP. It didn't work well for me because I never checked
Gmail and manage my messages there. Since having two separate copies of
things, where one doesn't influence the other, is a GtD no-no, I guess
this isn't really an option.

One thing that I would like is for gmail tags to be added to email
before forward to the IMAP account. That isn't an option, but using
Thunderbird and its filtering function works well enough.

Using Thunderbird, there's a nice little setting where  you can switch
on threading by default and emails remain threaded no matter how you
sort. That might be sufficient to replace the Google threaded view.

From http://ilias.ca/blog/2007/04/keeping-threaded-view-in-thunderbird =&gt;

Go to Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;General, and click on
&quot;Config
Editor&quot;.
In the Config Editor, search for the preference mailnews.thread_pane_column_unthreads .
Double-click on it, which should change the value to false.

Like Man Ching, I also forward all my Gmail to my IMAP Dot Mac
account.  I only check Gmail to make sure no legitimate messages have
been caught in the Spam mail box. From Dot Mac, I can do pretty much
whatever I want with the messages using my email client.

Hey Tory -
I've been going through some of the same thought processes as you lately,
and have actually found myself going the other direction. For the last year
and a half or so I was using a Sidekick to download and read most of my
Gmail, and almost never used the web interface, only to look up archived
messages. I recently switched to a Helio Ocean, which lacks automated
downloading of mail *and* has an extremely annoying habit of marking my
GMail messages as trash on the server side. I do not like this, so I have
found myself going back to the web interface for GMail on the go, while I
use Thunderbird to download messages (and archive them on the server) with
my computer. It's working pretty well so far, and I like that I can search
the GMail archives from my phone. That said, I'm not tied to the mobile
version of GMail with my phone, I can also use the HTML version pretty well,
which is good for more advanced features and changing settings.
I've also found myself moving towards more web applications and away from
the desktop for some things. I no longer use iCal on my iBook, but instead
use Missing Sync to sync my TX to my iBook, then use Spanning Sync to sync
the iBook to my GCal account, then use my TX and GCal for all my calender
needs. This has the added bonus of being a backup calendar on my phone when
I don't have my TX (like if I want to carry a small bag when I go out to
dinner or something). I can use the mobile GCal interface to check my
upcoming appointments, which is all I'll really need to do if I'm in a
situation where I didn't bring my TX. I also use Plaxo (here's where it gets
complicated) to sync my desktop address books (Apple's address book and
Thunderbird) to the web, where that information gets propagated to Yahoo,
AIM and Google without me having to do anything. From there, I sync contacts
to my phone via the AIM book, so everything stays happy. Even though changes
on the phone don't reliably make it back to the desktop, I deal with
additions/subtractions and major changes on my iBook almost exclusively, and
on the rare occasion that I make a change on the phone I can manually update
my desktop address book pretty easily. It doesn't happen frequently enough
to be an annoyance.
I've also switched to GDocs for document sharing with colleagues. I had a
guy asking for some lab protocols last week and I realized it would be a lot
easier to share this kind of stuff, which is eminently worth sharing, if I
kept it stored on GDocs, instead of on my computer. This way I could even
access a protocol while I'm in the lab, without having to go back to my
desk. Unfortunately, a large portion of my work involves databases filled
with private, patient information, so that stuff can't be anywhere but my
secured work computers.

That's what I used to do with my mail2web account...and probably will again.
I just wish I didn't have to pay a premium for Outlook integration, rather
than being locked to OWA.

Wow, Kerry...the whole thing sounds like a lot of work to maintain. My
thought with using Exchange is to get all of that in one place. Of course,
I'm still using Windows and Outlook...I would probably view it differently
if I were using a Mac. But maybe not...as the hosted exchange solution I
would use also includes the full Outlook Web Access interface. Besides that,
there's Outlook Mobile Access, which basically works like Gmail Mobile or
GCal Mobile.

It's actually not much work at all. The Spanning Sync and Plaxo syncs
are automated, so the only syncing I have to initiate is sticking my TX
on the cradle and pressing the button. It took a lot of work to set up,
but now it hums along with very little input from me. Sometimes I'll
force a sync at the end of the day on Friday, if I know I've made a lot
of changes, so that everything will be portable for the weekend.

I still use Gmail as an archive, but I actually access my email exclusively through hosted Exchange. Here's how it works.

Someone sends an email to j ... @jeffkirvin.net. My webhost automatically redirects the email to jeff.kir ... @gmail.com.

At Gmail the message is spam-filtered and if legit gets archived and forwarded to the internal email address for my account at 4smartphone.net.

At 4smartphone the email shows up in my inbox and I'm going to set up a rule so that if it's an RSS post from r-mail.org that it will be moved to the Reading Material folder. My folder structure is identical on my WM phone and Outlook on my desktop since they're both synced to the same Echange message store. Anything filed in one location is filed everywhere, no matter whether I'm using my phone, Outlook 2007 or Outlook Web Access. And if I delete somethin in Exchange, I still have a copy in Gmail if I need it.

Sounds complicated, but it works really smoothly in practice.

Subject: [woyp] Thinking about leaving Gmail

Hey all...

My ADD is acting up...I'm thinking about migrating away from Gmail back to
an IMAP/Exchange-based solution. My biggest reason: easy and flexible mobile
access. Gmail has mobile solutions, but they're a bit anemic (no tagging).
Yes, there are solutions like http://gmobile.phpmagazine.net and
http://glite.sayni.net , but they aren't secure and I figure that I'm asking
for problems by using them. I like to tag my email as I read it...it's a GTD
thing. IMAP/Exchange would allow me to file it as I read it.

But: I would miss multiple labels and Gmail's excellent threaded view. Other
than that, since I use WinMobile, it would make sense. I could put my whole
calendar and task list online as well. Most of what I do on a computer is
moving towards Web 2.0-stuff anyway (research, GDocs, etc.)

Give me some feedback on what y'all are doing.

Pax Vobiscum,
Tory Larson

that's very similar to what i've done in the past, Jeff. I'm also
vacillating between mail2web, 4smartphone, and 1and1 (I've used all but
4smartphone before).

I changed my email management habit so that I use Gmail as my primary one. I
still forward non-spam messages to one IMAP and one Exchange account.
Exchange one is solely for push mail purpose and immediately deleted once
read. IMAP is for archiving. (Yes, I don't 100% trust Gmail) I download
messages using Windows mail. One good thing about Gmail is it allows to
download sent-mails too. Then I save downloaded messages accordingly in my
IMAP folders for local AND online backup.

I don't need to check Gmail on mobile device often since I get real time
notification from Exchange server, but when I need to, I just login to
Non-mobile site using my Sprint Mogul. It looks a bit crowded in a small
screen, but not too bad.

Does mail2web offer desktop Outlook access? I tried all three, and liked
1and1 most. They all worked well for my primary usage, push mail, but I came
to love using Outlook 2007 with exchange server, so mail2web was out.
4smartphone requires yearly payment which I didn't like to. 1and1 seems to
have good combination of price, features, and reliability.
By the way, a guy at xda-developers offer (almost) free exchange hosting. It
used to be free, but now he requires initial $10 donation to open an
account. The account comes with a full package including desktop, mobile
access, push mail, and alias.
