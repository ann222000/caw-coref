I still find it amazing that a few dodgy loans in the USA can
seemingly affect finances round the whole world and apparently cause
losses of hundreds of billions of dollars while market fundamentals
have not really changed. An article in a UK paper today points out
that after the dotcom boom of 2000 and crash by 50% or so to March
2003, at that darkest trough time the FTSE100 was at 3,287 but its P/E
was 12.9.  Now, after a 12.5% drop from its high, the FTSE is at 5,911
but the P/E is only 10.9. This implies that the FTSE is considerably
cheaper now than at the lowest ebb of the dotcom darkness. As in March
2003 this will probably be seen later as a good time to buy rather
than to sell.

I hope you're right but I have my doubts. This is about uncertainty. Will we
lose the consumer.
Mattel recalled almost 19 million toys. What's a parent to buy? They won't
buy toys from China and what else do they have in the stores? Uh-oh,
retailers may have a rough year. Foreclosures are at record highs and each
report is worst than the last, uh-oh, how will they handle the
back-to-school season and the holidays? People with good jobs and plenty of
income are finding it difficult to get a mortgage on a new home. Uh==oh,
credit is getting tight, some say non-existent.

The environmentalist are already in the news. What are they going to do with
all of those toys? I think they should send them back to the communists at
their expense. What do you think?

I think Mattel should be held equally responsible, if not more than
their Chinese manufacturer. It probably is time to stick to European
made toys like Lego?

More than toys, I'm really concerned about food. I hope at some point of
time they write the country of origin on all foods. I have noticed that
on some food items but not all.

As I understand it, buyers are taking the toys back to the retailers
to get heir money back, then the retailers are claiming their money
back from the chinese manufacturers. The Chinese have loads of our
money and can probably afford to buy the faulty goods back. Lead is a
valuable metal. Thieves pinch it off church roofs over here.
Presumably the chinese can extract the lead and use it for batteries
or something. I am sure it will all work out without bringing the
financial world to its knees.

There are plenty of other things to buy made in China. Looking under
my new Microsoft Keyboard, it says &quot;Microsoft Corporation-Made in
China(S)&quot;. My new Dell monitor? Made in China. My Casio calculator.
Ditto. It might be difficult to find something not made in China! My
cars were both made in Germany, I think :-). More to the point, what
do we make in the UK and USA? Not a lot.

Well, it certainly is your perogative to not try to make more money when
you can.  This current &quot;crisis&quot; is totally overblown.  It's just pure
fear and panic caused by a few crybabies that lost on their bet for
risky paper.  There isn't any real crisis other than a mild slowdown of
our economy.

A real problem the Chinese have is how to make the air in Beijing
breathable by non-chinese by the Olympic games in 2008 in a year's
time. My daughter was over there recently and says she never saw a
clear sky because of the continuous brown haze from pollution.
Apparently they have started a system by which cars with even number
plates can drive one day and those with odd numbers the next but the
roads are still full and 1,000 new cars come onto the roads every day.
The air is not only bad for the athletes but also for the spectators
and those with asthma or heart problems are being urged to stay away.
Banning cars altogether for months is probably the only solution. But
then they open a new power station every week and there are all those
factories belching fumes.

They can do whatever they want to with cars, etc. The problem seems to be
their expanding desert. It is laden with heavy metals that go airborne. My
son was in S. Korea for 1.6 years and he said the pollution from China did
the same to their skies. I know several Koreans that recently came to the US
and they said they have never seen such clear skies. I believe them, I've
seen the photos from S. Korea.

And regardless, outsourcing is good for an advancing economy, not bad.
Sure there are growing pains (temporary unemployment woes, for
example), and those that lost their mfg jobs complain to no end, but
what is the end result? Americans become engineers and CPAs, and
doctors, and financial planners, and scientist, etc, etc, because
those jobs can't be easily outsourced. They are also higher paying and
carry a higher required intelligence level. With higher education
comes dozens of benefits. Slower population growth, higher GDP per
capita, lowered poverty, better leaders(???)...

At some point, it is even possible that our education (or ingenuity)
comes full circle. We begin manufacturing the items that no other
country has the technology or education to build. Once again we start
reverting to mfg and the whole cycle starts again.

The evolution from manufacturing to service based economies have
always yielded postitive results. Unfortunately there limited examples
throughout history that we can look to.

&gt; I hope you're right but I have my doubts. This is about uncertainty. Will we
&gt; lose the consumer.
&gt; Mattel recalled almost 19 million toys. What's a parent to buy? They won't
&gt; buy toys from China and what else do they have in the stores? Uh-oh,
&gt; retailers may have a rough year. Foreclosures are at record highs and each
&gt; report is worst than the last, uh-oh, how will they handle the
&gt; back-to-school season and the holidays? People with good jobs and plenty of
&gt; income are finding it difficult to get a mortgage on a new home. Uh==oh,
&gt; credit is getting tight, some say non-existent.

&gt; The environmentalist are already in the news. What are they going to do with
&gt; all of those toys? I think they should send them back to the communists at
&gt; their expense. What do you think?
">

The tightening of credit standards for consumers is long overdue.  The
law of unitended consequences suggests this may slow corporate
borrowing... I'd be interested in comments as to whether more
borrowing is done by large businesses or small businesses.

I am bullish provided employment stays stable.  The credit bubble is
popping real loud right now.

&gt; At some point, it is even possible that our education (or ingenuity)

&gt; The evolution from manufacturing to service based economies have

I once worked with Doug McIlroy, who wrote one of the first spelling

One thing he did was to arrange for his spelling checker to keep track of
which words were misspelled and how often.  So he was in the unusual
position of actually knowing which word his colleagues misspelled most
often.

The word was &quot;accommodate.&quot;  There are eight plausible ways of spelling it
(one or two c's one or two m's and a or o), and he found all eight
regularly.

David:

I think there are a couple of lessons to be learned, here.  One is the
difference between 'market value' and cash.  A drop in market value is not a
loss any more than a rise is a gain.  Gains and losses only happen when
'market value' is converted into cash and is not based on what one could
have sold at in the past but, rather, what one actually paid for the
securities sold.

The other lesson is that fundamentals, although informative, do not
determine market value; only supply and demand does that.  I'm sure it's
obvious that these factors are more affected by emotion than any of us would
like.

That said, I have been impressed by the resiliance of this market where a
350 point drop can be wiped out within one trading session.  This tells me
that while people have been spooked by stories they don't understand about
the so-called 'credit crunch' into taking their profits and heading for the
exits, a huge demand is sitting there waiting for the opportunity to enter
the markets at more favorable prices.

As you imply, above, this is nothing like the .com bust where money chased
bad ideas about a coming Internet economy.  Real companies making real
profits are on offer at bargain prices.  I think the only thing preventing
them from rising is a fear that better prices may obtain, tomorrow.  Unlike
the prior bubble (based on nothing real) I think the recovery, once the
bottom is found, will be rapid moving stocks to more 'normal' valuations.

Further, I think this whole sub-prime mortgage mess is being way overblown
mostly by the press which, nowadays, is more in the business of selling
advertising than selling truth.  Some people made some bad bets in a highly
speculative effort to make a quick buck.  Many will lose money (cash) as
well they should.  That's life under capitalism (creative destruction).  But
the idea that these sub-prime borrowers are somehow typical American
homeowners is ridiculous.  These people were already bad managers of money
strapped for cash.  That's why they couldn't qualify for more mainstream
mortgages.  I sincerely doubt that the typical American homeowner has been
using his home equity as an ATM.  The fear that bad loans will somehow turm
Americans away from consumption and make us a nation of savers seems silly
to me.

I also think that people have a dated notion of the importance of the
American consumer in the creation of global final demand.  Although they are
still probably the most important component of final demand, they are less
so every year.  I read recently that every last one of the 500 companies in
the S&amp;P has operations overseas.  The percentage of corporate profits earned
domesically has been dropping for years and will continue to do so for many
years to come.  The bottom line is that the world economy is growing, income
is growing and corporate profits show every indication that they will
continue to grow indefinitley.  With so much cash sloshing around the globe,
it is hard to believe that stock valuations will not follow this profit
growth.

My only regret is not that I didn't liquidate at the highs (who knew) but
that, being fully invested, I don't have more cash to deploy at these
seemingly favorable prices.

You nailed the situation pretty right on.  I did take some profits in
June and July before the downturn so have some buying cash.  Plus have a
sizeable amount in US Treas. Strips bought back in '97 for a good rate
and about to mature that could be liquidated for buying. ;-)  I expect
the bounce off the bottom is going to be spectacular.  With four years
of a bull market and good earnings out there, you would think there is a
tremendous amount of cash waiting for a good buying opportunity to come
in.

Good (or fortunate) timing on you part.  I did rebalance some EM profits
into blend funds but nothing significant.

There is obviously a battle going on between those who want to take their
profits and run and those who want to buy good companies at these prices.
My only question is, in a globalized economy, where can you run to with
those profits?

Just a bit lucky on my part.  I had about 6 stock positions that were
over 20 percent gain and decided to take Cramer's advice and take a
portion (the profits) off the table.  I wish I would have taken profits
on some gains between 10 and 20 percent.  And there were a couple of
turkeys that I sold. Well, this was part of a re-allocation strategy to
more foreign positions mainly more EFA.  Which is working out well so
far as I am able to get more EFA for my money now.  I think I might also
double my position in PIO.

&gt; these prices. My only question is, in a globalized economy, where can
&gt; you run to with those profits?
">

You can't run anywhere. ;-)  Global stocks and funds are the best place
to be right now since the dollar is down relative to most others that
count.  I'm trying to get to 50 percent US and 50 percent foreign with
mostly developed foreign for that portion.  I'm at about 70-30 right
now.  It's a Ken Fisher strategy that I am following.  When he says
&quot;extended bear market&quot; is coming, I'm going mostly to all cash and
probably buy some of those ultrashort ETF's.

Sourpuss??!!! You could be right there :-) But I am feeling
disgruntled at the moment because my investments are down about 12%
from their high and might go down more before they go up again. And
all because greedy lenders advanced loans to what the papers call
NINJA americans, No Income, No Job Americans, who, surprise, surprise
couldn't pay them back when interest rates went up ! A secondary point
is what were debt rating agencies Moody and S&amp;P doing allowing these
debts to be parcelled up and sold round the world as valid financial
instruments? Were they sleeping on the job when they should have been
rating these things as sub-junk, ZZZ? Will heads roll over there?

But I am still being negative. Something positive then: We finally got
rid of Blair who has disappeared into well-deserved obscurity with a
cleverly chosen impossible non-job from the USA. And we got rid of
Becks and Posh over to you!

No, still negative. Hmmm. No can't think of anything positive at the
moment :-(

Many of them weren't Americans. But yes, the lenders got a little carried
away:-)

I agree with you with some exceptions/concerns.  The carry trade is also
unwinding and that will have a continuing negative effect on the market.
The consumer is still an unknown with the effect of dropping real estate
prices and the rising loan premiums on their adjustable mortgages.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I still find it amazing that a few dodgy loans in the USA can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seemingly affect finances round the whole world and apparently cause
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; losses of hundreds of billions of dollars while market fundamentals
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have not really changed. An article in a UK paper today points out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that after the dotcom boom of 2000 and crash by 50% or so to March
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2003, at that darkest trough time the FTSE100 was at 3,287 but its P/E
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was 12.9.  Now, after a 12.5% drop from its high, the FTSE is at 5,911
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but the P/E is only 10.9. This implies that the FTSE is considerably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cheaper now than at the lowest ebb of the dotcom darkness. As in March
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2003 this will probably be seen later as a good time to buy rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than to sell.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep, a good time to be buying.

&gt;&gt; Not with my money.

&gt; Well, it certainly is your perogative to not try to make more money when
&gt; you can.  This current &quot;crisis&quot; is totally overblown.  It's just pure fear
&gt; and panic caused by a few crybabies that lost on their bet for risky
&gt; paper.  There isn't any real crisis other than a mild slowdown of our
&gt; economy.

Hi Jerry,

I think what you mention below has already been mostly priced into the
market.  The retail sector was already performing poorly months before
this.  And much of the fear about the carry trade unwinding has been
going on for months now.  Unemployment is still low so I'm not betting
against the US consumer.

&gt; &gt;&gt; We disagree and that's what makes markets, go for it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; BTW,  &quot;perogative&quot; is spelled &quot;prerogative&quot;. It is probably the most
&gt; &gt;&gt; misspelled word in the English language.

&gt; &gt; I once worked with Doug McIlroy, who wrote one of the first spelling
&gt; &gt; checkers ever.

&gt; &gt; One thing he did was to arrange for his spelling checker to keep track of
&gt; &gt; which words were misspelled and how often.  So he was in the unusual
&gt; &gt; position of actually knowing which word his colleagues misspelled most
&gt; &gt; often.

&gt; &gt; The word was &quot;accommodate.&quot;  There are eight plausible ways of spelling it
&gt; &gt; (one or two c's one or two m's and a or o), and he found all eight
&gt; &gt; regularly.

&gt; You sparked my interest so I did a search. As it turns out accommodate is on
&gt; every list and prerogative isn't on any list.

&gt; Here's two: http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/misspelled.htmlhttp://www.eslde...

Actually, I think 'you're' is probably the most misspelled word.
Recently, I have seen it
spelled as 'your' so many times.  Spell-checkers don't pick it up.

Another one along those lines is when people improperly use &quot;then&quot; instead
of &quot;than&quot;.  I see this one almost as often as &quot;your&quot; for &quot;you're&quot;.
