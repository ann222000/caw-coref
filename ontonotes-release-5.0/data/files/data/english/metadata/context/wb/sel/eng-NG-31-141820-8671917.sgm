Excellent report back Doc.

&gt;  Dear Ms. Thomas and members of the Mayor's Commission on Immigration:

&gt; While the emotionally laden arguments presented in Ms. Thomas' email of
&gt; 8/7/07 are appreciated, ICE 287g issues be best answered by the appropriate
&gt; Immigration and Customs Enforcement Supervisor and/or Field Agent awaiting
&gt; your invitation to discuss ICE 287g in its entirety.

&gt; As we know, the Maxwell Street Legal Clinic serves the needs of many
&gt; wonderful illegal aliens and legal immigrants.  The humanitarian based and
&gt; compelling representations in her letter remind me of the many experiences I
&gt; have had over 18 months of accumulated time throughout Latin America and 44
&gt; countries worldwide.  Ms. Thomas deserves our heartfelt encouragement in her
&gt; assumed responsibilities.

&gt; While our LPD officers and Commanders are expressly prohibited from
&gt; sharing their political views about 287g publicly, they privately
&gt; acknowledge being seriously hamstrung in the performance of their duties
&gt; without 287g.  Indeed, their personal safety is increasingly becoming
&gt; vulnerable and compromised.  Consequently, they are risking their lives as
&gt; much as they would without personal armor.

&gt; Our brave and dedicated law enforcement officers must have the ability to
&gt; identify their suspects and intercede in the most advanced enforcement
&gt; circumstances.  They don't want to have to wait until they are outmanned and
&gt; outgunned by international gangs.

&gt; I suggest Ms. Thomas spend 30 - 40 hours in the LPD &quot;Ride Along&quot; program
&gt; to develop a street cop's perspective.  U. K. medical students do a similar
&gt; externship, on an elective basis, so they can study EMS systems. As a matter
&gt; of fact, I designed the first model externship of this kind in 1985.  I have
&gt; also ridden with local, state, and Federal law enforcement officers in
&gt; multiple jurisdictions and have  personally observed, first hand, the
&gt; enormous risks they face hourly.

&gt; Maybe Constitutional and Immigration Law is not taught until the 3rd
&gt; year.  I don't know.  I encourage Ms. Thomas to browse the Henry Timberlake
&gt; Duncan III Law Library displayed in the U. K. College of Law, however.  She
&gt; may discover that the fundamental principles of law are timeless.  Then, as
&gt; she swears into the Kentucky Bar she'll vow to uphold the law, all of them.

&gt; I received my tutorial in Federal Immigration and International
&gt; Extradition Law in the Magistrate Courts of the United States Federal Court
&gt; District of South Florida while learning DEA and INS (now ICE) enforcement
&gt; procedures.  The lessons learned were cemented in my heart through several
&gt; visits to the United States Supreme Court over thirty years.

&gt; First and foremost, &quot;Justice is Blind.&quot;  Secondly, an attorney's
&gt; responsibility is to represent the law and not construct it.  It is
&gt; the legal and ethical obligation of all attorneys not to aid or
&gt; abet offenders of the law.

&gt; In closing, I beseech the Commission to give a fair opportunity to
&gt; hear ICE.  They will answer all your questions fully and with complete
&gt; understanding.  The emotional misunderstandings, factually unsound
&gt; arguments, intentional misrepresentations and plethora of fear-based rumors
&gt; swirling around Lexington about ICE 287g - LPD Partnership training will be
&gt; resoundingly dispelled by so doing.

&gt; At least, if you are having difficulty with the public's cry for
&gt; assistance in preserving our communities, you will be able to give a fully
&gt; informed recommendation to the Mayor.  Of course, I'll remind you, again, of
&gt; the value 287g will have as LPD prepares for the 2010 Games.  You have a
&gt; fundamental responsibility to Lexington to incorporate 287g for preserving
&gt; the safety and security of all.

&gt; Respectfully,
&gt;     Dr. David M. Duncan
&gt; Lexington, KY
