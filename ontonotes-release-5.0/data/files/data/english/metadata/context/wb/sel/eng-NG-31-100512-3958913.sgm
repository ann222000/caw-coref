Windshield replacement (should I get OEM glass?, how to determine a good shop)

I just got a rock chip in my winshield, directly in my line of sight on
my 97 Honda Accord. According to California law, I can't patch it, I
must replace the winshield.
I got a quote from a local glass shop chain.
The cost is only $180 including labor.
This seems way too inexpensive (although perhaps prices have dropped in
recent years.)
I am almost sure the the replacement is not OEM.
Is it important to use OEM replacements? Not only for safety reasons
but for quality reasons as well.
Also, the shop told me I can drive away in about 1/2 hour. This seems
fishy to me as I would believe that the adhesives need to cure
properly. I would appreciate any advice.
Thanks

Here's my experience with windshields, 'old style'
and new style.

A gasket (moldable yet firm goo) is layed around the
perimeter of the windshield deck. The new windshield
is layed on top of this gasket and also rests against
alignment clips. Then the chrome (or colored) molding
is pressed on to hide the channel.

You're ready to drive off.

About six months ago, I had a windshield replaced on
my truck. A rubber gasket (it's grooved on the ID
of the gasket) is wrapped around the windshield, which
forms a rubber 'ring' around the windshield, then
the windshield with this rubber gasket ring is
pressed into the winshield channel.

Ready to drive RIGHT NOW.

No 'adhesives' involved in either of those two methods.

I paid $80 for a brand-new windshield, OEM quality
and then paid $70 for installation.

Forgot to mention: the first windshield I got from
a junkyard, no chips, etc for $40 and a friend who
is a body man, installed it for me in 30 minutes.
(no cost except beer).

I checked with the Buick dealership here earlier, and they said they
outsource EVERYTHING:

It is common to walk away for $100 on some windshields.

You will likely be okay on the one you described.

I would be interested to hear opinions on "OEM glass" as well.

A few weeks ago my 91 Civic also acquired a bad peck and crack from a rock.
This was the third one the windshield had acqired, and by far much worse
than the others. I too was amazed when I found a company (Safelite) that
would come to my house and install a new one (in less than an hour) for only
$221. After I had it installed, the technician similarly told me I could
drive in an hour.

Unfortunately, ten days later another rock hit the windshield (passenger
side) and it now has a ten inch crack in it. I called the company and asked
if there were a higher quality glass I could have had installed. Its
representative said no.

I have been thinking the new windshield's crack is by far more due to the
fact that I drive in an area overwhelmingly populated by aspiring yuppie
pick-up truck owners. They sit higher and their wheels spew out rocks close
to my windshield's level.

But if anyone has a citation reporting that OEM glass is tougher, I'd like
to see it.

Didnt your OEM crack?

Fact of the matter, a rock/pebble, with the proper
angle and thrust, will mar any quality glass.

Of course.

My point is it seems a bit too much of a coincidence that of the roughly
five or six projectiles that have hit my windshield hard over the last 14
years, one was hard enough to crack my non-OEM windshield only ten days
after installation.

I guess how this windshielf fares in the coming year will tell more. I am
prepared to resign myself to being messed over by all the trucks kicking up
rocks at the height of my Civic's windshield in my area, but I would like to
know if OEM glass would be tougher.

OEM Honda glass is like OEM Honda radiators: Overpriced for what you get.

An OEM '97 Accord windshield is less than $300. An aftermarket will be less
than half that.

Quality issues with aftermarket glass usually involve distortion (see item
#2).

The only real quality issues you'll have with any windshield are:

1) Pinchweld paint nicks, which will rust. And they WILL nick the paint,
too. Get the installer to allow you to inspect the pinchweld BEFORE the new
glass goes in, and get him to primer the nicks with his glass primer. If
the glass shop won't let you do this, go find one that will.

2) Distortions in the glass. Have the glass shop support the windshield
at the same angle it will be in when installed, pointing out the shop's
windows. Then go squat down where you will be when in the driver's seat.
Squirm around and watch the view. Does anything appear distorted as you
move around? Then DON'T let them install that glass! Get them to bring in a
new one. A good glass shop will have no objection to you doing this. Of
course, greater priority will be given to distortions directly in your line
of vision. Don't reject glass just because the upper passenger-side corner
has distortion.

3) Nicks in the glass edges. Run your fingernail all around the edges on
both faces. The tiniest nick will eventually turn into a crack. If your
fingernail hangs up at any point, reject the glass.

4) Trim. Probably the very best thing for you to do is remove the wipers,
A-pillar trim and leaf grate yourself. It will prevent them from breaking
it and then gluing it up with urethane so you don't notice.

5) Make certain they've put the new glass in STRAIGHT. If they're in a
hurry they can put it in slightly rotated, and you'll have weird wind
noises and maybe even water leaks. I've just gone through this with a guy
with a 2003 CR-V. Boy did the glass shop screw that one up.

6) As far as drive time after installation, less than an hour is NORMAL.
Modern urethane glass adhesive cures VERY quickly. Don't worry about it.

7) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL!!!!!!!
STAY WAY FROM DUMP TRUCKS! I call them windshield-crackers. If you are even
100 yards behind a dump truck, drop back 1,000 yards, or pass it. Stay at
LEAST two lanes away. Every time one of those things goes over the
slightest bump, a cascade of gravel will sift out of the tailgate seams and
break your windshield! They make dumpers tarp their loads, but they do
NOTHING about the tailgate seams. Dumb, if you ask me. And generally, don't
tailgate. If you're close to another vehicle, the chances of gravel getting
kicked onto your windshield are much greater.

Just my 2¢, of course.

A good indication of whether all patches are unapproved is whether there are
Novus dealers listed in the "glass replacement or repair" section of the
local phone book; they won't thrive if what they do is illegal. Apparently
the technique has also changed recently, because the last time I had a star
crack repaired they said the maximum size was one that could be covered by a
quarter. Now I'm told they can repair it if the crack can be covered by a
dollar bill. Maybe the next time it will be if they can be covered by a $100
bill ;-)

Our last crack was too big, and we got a good price and good service on
replacement from Safelite. YMMV.

I think blind luck has a lot to do with it. A Dodge we had went through 4
windshields in barely half a year. The original was smashed by a vandal.
Maybe a month later a big rock terminated the new one. Not a week later a
storm broke a big limb from a tree and smashed #3. Within a couple months #4
picked up a couple of star cracks that grew into each other (that could be
related to windshield quality). The next windshield lasted until we got rid
of the car... maybe a year or two.

I recall many years ago there was a car commercial (Buick?) that featured
two cars running into a steel ball or similar suspended by a string. The
Brand X car had a smashed windshield while Wonder Car didn't. They were
touting a "specially toughened area in front of the driver" - which made me
wonder if there was a reason the rest of the windshield was more vulnerable.
Since then I learned that tempering makes glass much more resistant to
impact but much more vulnerable to temperature changes. So... there may well
be differences, but I couldn't tell you what is best..

My experience with non-OEM glass is that it is as tough (or breakable)
as OEM glass.  There can be differences in quality however.  I have
seen non-OEM glass with a not well formed outer surface.  As a
consequence the windshield wiper misses one or more low spots in the
glass.  If it were me I would insist on OEM glass from the dealer.

As I mentioned in a previous post, the dealers in this little country town

Googling doesn't have much that leaps out on the subject. Thanks to the
other posters (HLS et al.) who say their understanding the resistance to
cracks etc. is no better than OEM.

I did try one of those $10 crack repair kits on the latest crack. The
improvement was slight, worth ten bucks I suppose, plus I managed to extend
the crack another inch during the process.

I guess I'll shop around casually in the next few months.

Maybe there's a little too much construction in my area and I should wait at
least six months until things settle down. The construction just seems to
never end, wherever one is.

AFAIK, its a citeable offense, good for a $10 "fix it ticket".

that is...

IF you get pulled over
IF you get cited
THEN you have to fix it

prolly something in the code about having an obstructed view, or
something. im not the OP, so i dont know or really care, but im sure
theres something in the code about not obstructing your windshield.

Had a brand new VW once...got a star break on the way home....too big
for repair...so new windshield.  Original was OEM (obvisously);
replacement not.

Had a new Toyota with scratches in the driver's side of the windshield
at time of purchase....finally got the dealer to accept the defect and
they replaced it.  (Actually dealer had some local glass outfit do the
replacement - not OEM by the way; replacement job was done right there
in the dealer's service bay!).

Had more than couple of replacements on Honda Accord in 5 years....none
were OEM and, per others on this group, less $.

Moral of this story.....auto glass has to meet Federal safety
standards, and any reputable glass outfit knows that....save the $ and
believe other posts on this group about non-OEM windshields.   (Even my
original Honda windshield had some distortions...)

The most important factor, by far, is how well the windshield is glued
in place since there's far more variation with this than with the
quality of the glass.  If the windshield doesn't stay in place in a
crash, not only will unbelted occupants be at greater risk of injury
but also belted occupants can suffer since airbags, especially the
passenger one, depend on the windshield to hold them in place.

A good installation requires taht the glass and window opening be very
clean, gloves worn during installation to prevent skin oil from
contaminating the surfaces, and the proper primer and urethane adhesive
(made with different cure rates for different temperatures) be used.
The current preferred practice is to remove all the old urethane from
the window opening.  Also the car should not be driven until at least
twice the cure time has passed.  When I replaced my own windshield, the
adhesive required anywhere from 2-6 hours to cure.  My windshield never
leaked, unlike most of those done on company cars by a local chain of
glass shops that advertised heavily and offered insurance deductible
rebates and free restaurant dinners.

&gt; &gt; You're ready to drive off.
&gt; &gt; About six months ago, I had a windshield replaced on my
&gt; &gt; truck. A rubber gasket (it's grooved on the ID of the
&gt; &gt; gasket) is wrapped around the windshield, which forms a
&gt; &gt; rubber 'ring' around the windshield, then the windshield
&gt; &gt; with this rubber gasket ring is pressed into the winshield channel.
&gt; Current safety laws require all new US vehicles to have adhesive bonded
&gt; windshields.  They don't pop out in accidents like the gasket mounted types.

I believe federal regulations only require that a certain high
percentage of the windshield remain in place and unpierced.  It doesn't
mandate the use of adhesive, and I had a VW Golf (Rabbit in U.S.) with
the windshield held in place with a gasket, but on the left and right
sides were metal strips with alligator teeth to dig into the gasket and
make it hold the glass much more securely.  The alligator strips also
made installation much more difficult, and I'm sure some unscrupulous
glass shops left them out.  These strips, being made of heavily
galvanized steel, probably also prevented the opening from rusting, a
major problem with my rear hatch window.  I believe car makers switched
to adhesives in order to save time (glue can cure as the car travels
down the production line) and to allow a more flush perimeter around
the glass.

The best way to find out what the law requires is to read the law. Do a
search of your legislated laws and regulations and then have a read.

Here any defect (stone chip, crack, etc.) that is in the line of sight of
the driver is reason to repair or replace the windshield.

Getting farther OT... the CDLs where I work are shocked by new DUI
provisions in the regulations. (I have no idea if it is a state or federal
statute involved.) Now, if they get a DUI and have had another DUI in the
last 55 years - like if they are 70 and had one when they were 16 - their
CDL is permanently revoked and they have to find a new line of work. I have
no patience for DUI, but that seems a little ex post facto to me in that
whether a driver gets one or two strikes is tied to their record before the
law was enacted. Of course, it is no different than "three strikes" laws in
that respect.

Then the people to ask (in person or on the phone) would be a Vehicle
Compliance Officer or Inspector. You can find those at a DOT Scale. They
will (around here anyway) look up the pertinent section of the Act and photo

1/2 hr?  They must be damn fast.  I've watch windshields getting replaced and
it takes longer than that to do the job right.  Rushing means making a bigger
mess that will take more time to clean up.  Once the work is done, you can
drive right away.  It will take a day or so to fully cure, but that doesn't
really affect the windshield unless you get caught in a storm.

&gt;First thing honda do not make glass they buy them just like any other
&gt;company and OEM and non OEM are often actually made by the same company.
&gt;the ONLY difference may be a honda logo printed on the glass so do not
&gt;waste your money paying honda's mark up on the same glass. Second thing yes
&gt;modern adhesives are very high 'grab' and surface cure in less than 30 min
&gt;so you can drive the car after this short a time but the adhesive does not
&gt;fully cure for 3/4 days so do not slam doors hard etc for about a week as
&gt;the glass may move slightly.
