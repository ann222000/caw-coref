A Warning To All Parents About The Government

Website:
http://www.hightechharassment.com/

Parents of mentally handicapped and mentally ill children should be
warned about technology used by the government to force their children
to receive mental health care from the current mental health care
system. If your child is viewed as a threat to the community, your
child could be targeted by community watch groups with access to
classified surveillance and harassment technology.

Once a family with one or more members viewed as a threat to the
community is identified, the watch group will move into a neighboring
house to conduct surveillance of the family. The group will conduct
complete surveillance of the family with classified technology that
can electronically see and hear through walls.

The surveillance period can last from weeks to months. A decision is
made after the surveillance period of how to deal with the person or
persons believed to be a threat. Classified technology now exist that
can attack a single person through walls of a house.

The technology can be used to single out one person in a house and
attack them. The technology leaves no physical evidence after the
attack. The technology is used from a neighboring house to the
targeted person, in another house. It can artificially create symptoms
that a psychiatrist will diagnose as a serious mental disorder.

The technology uses directed sound that passes through walls and can't
be heard or seen but felt by the person targeted. The technology is
similar to a light laser but instead of using light, the technology
uses sonic energy to direct a beam of sound that is out of the hearing
range of humans through a house. One person can be singled out and
attacked with the technology while other people in the house will
experience no effects of the technology. No physical damage is done to
the person or house.

The person attacked with this technology will experience any of the
following:

1)      Burning sensations in the legs.
2)      Hearing strange voices or noises.
3)      Jolts or involuntary movements to parts of the body (limbs or
fingers for example)
4)      Numb feelings in areas on top of head.
5)      Loss of sleep due to the above mentioned symptoms.
6)      Inability to sleep throughout the night.

A mentally handicapped child may not be able to communicate the above
mentioned symptoms to the parent. The child may simply be driven out
of control by the technology.

The government is currently using the technology to target carefully
selected mentally handicapped and mentally ill people throughout the
United States. The aftermath of this covert government operation
against innocent civilians in the United States is the following:

1)      Mothers kill their children and claim that God told them to do it.
2)      Mentally handicapped adult/child goes out of control and hurts or
kills other people.
3)      People claim that they live in a haunted house.
4)      People claim they are victims of mind control or radiation weapons.

The government is currently using the classified technology to create
tragedy throughout the United States. The purpose of this is to create
fear among the public so stricter laws can be enacted to force
mentally handicapped and mentally ill people into the public mental
health care system for treatment.

The goal of the government is strong state or federal laws requiring
the forced medication and monitoring of people with mental
disabilities or mental illnesses that are considered dangerous to the
public.

The government wishes to put this technology in the hands of neighbor
watch groups and those groups will make determinations of who is
placed under surveillance and who is attacked. These groups will
manage the mental health of the community. The groups will discover
threats to the community and take steps to eliminate the threat.

These groups will be able to electronically look into any house in the
community to conduct surveillance without any type of warrant. The
technology will allow the removal of any individual from the
community.

A child targeted may windup in a mental institution, setup and sent to
jail, or commit suicide. The local groups have complete digression on
how to deal with the threat to the community.

The technology artificially creates symptoms of serious mental
disorders. This technology can be used to target and single out a
single person in a house. Once the targeted child describes the
symptoms of the attack to other people, the system can step in and
take over.

Psychiatrists use the DSM-IV to diagnosis mental illness. The DSM-IV
is the bible of for mental illness. The symptoms artificially created
by this technology are detailed in the DSM-IV. Once the symptoms are
described to a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist can legally declare the
person as mentally ill.

Children targeted with this technology will be at an extreme
disadvantage compared to an adult. An adult targeted can simply move
to another community or state but a child will not be able to do this.

Once child describes the symptoms to parent, the parent may force the
child to see a psychiatrists. If the parent refuses to take the child
to a psychiatrist, the system may remove the child from the parent's
custody.

The school system, law enforcement, and local community services are
looking for children exhibiting systems of serious mental illness and
laws have been enacted or are being drafted to find children
exhibiting these symptoms and force treatment upon them.

This high-tech method to force treatment upon children is the
government's response to school shootings and other tragedies
involving children with mental disabilities or mental illnesses. The
future will involve a proactive approach to mental illness.

There are no detection devices available the general public to detect
the classified surveillance technology or harassment technology. Any
family targeted will be at the mercy of the government.

Any attempt to report the surveillance or harassment is a waste of
time. Law enforcement will do nothing to help. In fact reporting this
to law enforcement may be a tragic mistake because law enforcement may
be able to detain a person making the complaint if state law allows.

Only a few specially selected members of law enforcement are aware of
the technology so don't expect any help from any member of law
enforcement. Don't make the mistake of going to law enforcement.

The same applies to the mental health system. Only a select few are
aware of the technology. Any psychiatrist will be required to diagnose
a person making complaint of this type of harassment as being mentally
ill.

The days of the mental heath system grabbing people off the street and
institutionalizing   them are not over. The days of the surgical
lobotomy are over but the days of the chemical lobotomy are now just
beginning.

With today's medication for the mentally ill, a child targeted can be
identified as a threat to the community and action taken to insure the
child gets a chemical lobotomy. The child can be forced for the reset
of his life to take the medication after the technology is used to
artificially create symptoms.

Parents should learn of this technology and be prepared to identify
the artificial symptoms created by the technology. This is the high-
tech era and to think this technology doesn't exist is not wise and
possibly dangerous to yourself and member of your family.
