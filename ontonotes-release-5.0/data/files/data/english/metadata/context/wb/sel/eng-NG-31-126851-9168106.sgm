Back down to Earth

Why, when men and women are more equal than ever, is the myth about
the sexes coming from different planets so popular? Deborah Cameron,
in the third of three extracts
&lt; http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,,2181069,00.html &gt;  from
her new book, argues that the 'Martians' and 'Venusians' are more
similar than they think

[PHOTO:  &quot;Myth of Mars and Venus&quot; ]

No group of men and women in history has ever been less different, or
less at the mercy of their biology, than those living in western
societies today. And yet 21st-century westerners are drawn to a
mythology that says that differences between men and women are
profound and unalterable. So what is it that attracts us to the
concept of Mars versus Venus?

The idea that men and women metaphorically &quot;speak different languages&quot;
- that they use language in different ways and for different reasons -
is one of the great myths of our time. Research debunks the various
smaller myths that contribute to it: for instance, that women talk
more than men (research suggests the opposite); that women's talk is
cooperative and men's competitive (research shows that both sexes
engage in both kinds of talk); that men and women systematically
misunderstand one another (research has produced no good evidence that
they do).

There is a great deal of similarity between men and women, and the
differences within each gender group are typically as great as or
greater than the difference between the two. Many differences are
context-dependent: patterns that are clear in one context may be
muted, nonexistent or reversed in another, suggesting that they are
not direct reflections of invariant sex-specific traits.

If these points were acknowledged, the science soundbites would be
headed &quot;Men and women pretty similar, research finds&quot;, and popular
psychology books would bear titles like There's No Great Mystery About
the Opposite Sex or We Understand Each Other Well Enough Most of the
Time. Of course, these titles do not have the makings of bestsellers,
whereas the &quot;men and women are from different planets&quot; story is a
tried and tested formula. What does the myth of Mars and Venus do for
us, that we return to it again and again?

The importance of being normal

In 2003, a website called the Gender Genie, which claimed to be able
to diagnose an author's sex from a 500-word sample of writing, became
a favourite with web surfers. Their comments made clear that they had
all given the Genie samples to analyse. Obviously, they didn't need
the Genie to tell them if they were male or female (which is just as
well, since its error rate is high). What they wanted to know was how
their writing measured up against the Genie's criteria for male- or
femaleness. One blogger, recommending the Genie to others, said: &quot;Go
play with it: find out if you write like you're supposed to write.&quot;

The Gender Genie in fact says nothing about how men and women are
supposed to write. The Genie is a machine that has been programmed to
look for certain features whose frequencies were found to differ in
male- and female-authored texts in a controlled sample of written
English. It counts the frequency of those features, then delivers a
guess based on the numbers. All it tells the user is whether his or
her writing supports the hypothesis that the frequency of particular
features is diagnostic of a writer's sex.

Nevertheless, among the 100 bloggers whose responses I examined, all
but a handful assumed that the Genie's judgment said something about
them, rather than something about the Genie. Bloggers whose sex was
guessed wrongly often sought reasons in their life experience. One
woman suggested she had been classified as male because she had been
educated at a boys' school, while several others recalled that as
children they had been tomboys. Men joked - sometimes with obvious
unease - about the possibility that they were gay. When the Genie
guessed right, by contrast, no one looked for a reason.

The bloggers' understanding of what the Gender Genie tells its users
is typical of the way we approach sex differences. We have a tendency
to treat any generalisation about men and women as a source of
information about &quot;normal&quot; behaviour, which therefore has implications
for how we ourselves should behave. Of course, there are some people
who actively want to be different from the norm. But for most people,
the desire to be normal is strong: &quot;Am I normal?&quot; is one of the hardy
perennials of the problem page.

For the past 15 years, the myth of Mars and Venus has told us what is
normal for men and women in the sphere of language and communication.
Its generalisations about male and female language use have come to
influence our expectations and our judgments of how men and women
communicate. Unlike the Gender Genie, this is not just harmless fun.
We see its less benign consequences when employers view women as
better candidates than men for jobs that demand the ability to chat
(and men as better candidates than women for jobs that demand verbal
authority and directness). We see them when parents and educators
expect girls to be better at languages, and boys to be better at
maths. We see them when jurors at rape trials give men who claim to
have &quot;misread a woman's signals&quot; the benefit of the doubt. And we see
them in a small way every time someone makes a joke about how much
women talk or how useless men are at expressing their feelings.

The importance of being different

Sex differences fascinate us to a degree that most biological
differences don't. It is conceivable, for instance, that you could
diagnose a writer's age from a sample of prose, but no one would
design a Genie for that purpose. And to my knowledge, there has never
been a bestselling popular science book about the differences between
right- and left-handed people.

Handedness makes an instructive comparison with sex, because it too is
associated with differences in the organisation of the brain. In
December 2006, for instance, an article in the journal Neuropsychology
reported that left-handed people were quicker and more efficient than
right-handers at tasks such as computer gaming that required the
simultaneous processing of multiple stimuli. If that had been a
sex-difference finding, it would surely have got the same attention as
the &quot;men have trouble listening to women&quot; study, the &quot;men are better
shoppers&quot; study, and the &quot;women talk three times as much as men&quot;
claim. But it wasn't, and it didn't.

If handedness generates fewer soundbites than sex, it is probably
because findings about it cannot be slotted into any larger narrative
about the difference between right-handed and left-handed people. We
don't conceive of them as different species from different planets; we
don't see them as locked in an eternal &quot;battle of the hands&quot;. Except
perhaps in sport, we rarely think about them at all. Handedness, in
short, is not significant for the organisation of human social
affairs: it does not determine a person's identity, role, or status in
society. An account of how left-handers differ from right-handers
would therefore lack one of the crucial ingredients that draw us to
accounts of how women differ from men: it would not serve the purpose
of justifying institutionalised social inequality by explaining it as
the inevitable consequence of natural differences.

Is that what the myth of Mars and Venus is about? I'll let the back
cover of Why Men Don't Iron have the first word: &quot;Much of what is
written and taught today presumes that most of the differences between
women and men have been caused by society and can therefore be
altered. Once this is done, men and women will become alike. And so
men are challenged, pestered and lectured to change from the old
dominant male to get in touch with their feminine side. But what if
that feminine side does not exist? Men's brains are wired very
differently from women's, so their reactions to stimuli cannot be the
same. Thus, increasing feminisation of society, of food and of
education is detrimental to men and eventually will be to women too.&quot;

This belongs to a time-honoured tradition of dire warnings about the
dangers of altering the balance of nature by changing the relationship
between men and women. Although it is contradictory (if the wiring of
our brains renders all efforts to change men and women futile, how has
the &quot;increasing feminisation of society&quot; been able to occur?), the
political message is clear enough. We would all be better off if we
reverted to the natural order in which the sexes were different and
males were dominant.

But this seems an unlikely message to be sending here and now. In the
societies where the Mars and Venus myth has flourished, it is obvious
that gender differences have become less significant socially than
they were in even the recent past. It is also clear that many aspects
of sexual biology are becoming more susceptible to the intervention of
technology. &quot;Gender reassignment&quot; is now done routinely; so are the
procedures that enable the single, the gay and lesbian, the infertile,
the post-menopausal, and sometimes even the dead to reproduce. Even
our genes, where so many sex differences allegedly reside, are no
longer beyond our power to alter.

The age-old certainties of gender, then, are visibly being challenged.
Meanwhile, we have developed an insatiable appetite for material that
recycles the traditional ideas about men's and women's &quot;natures&quot;. Is
that a contradiction? Or could our uncertainty about the future
significance of sex and gender be precisely what is enabling the myth
of Mars and Venus to flourish?

'A rupture in human history'

In January 2007, the New York Times reported one of the most
significant findings of the 2005 US census: for the first time in
history, a majority of American women were not living with a spouse.
In Britain a month later, the Office of National Statistics revealed
that the number of marriages taking place in the UK had fallen to an
all-time low.

A number of factors are contributing to this trend, including women
marrying later, widows surviving longer, and more unwed couples living
together. But one major factor is the choice more and more women are
making not to marry, or not to remarry after divorce. They prefer
independence; and today it is within their grasp. Not long ago, most
women's earnings were insufficient to maintain a household. The social
price of independence was also high, since a &quot;respectable&quot; woman could
not have sexual relationships or children outside marriage.

The public policy scholar Alison Wolf has argued that recent changes
in the position of educated women in developed societies constitute
nothing less than &quot;a rupture in human history&quot;. In the past, Wolf
notes, the lives of women in every class revolved around their
domestic roles. But in the past 40 or 50 years, technological and
social changes have given women more choice about how they live their
lives. For an elite minority of women, the possibility now exists of
leading lives that are more or less indistinguishable from the lives
of their male equivalents.

That possibility has come about because of the opening up of
previously restricted educational and career opportunities. Wolf notes
that during the first 50 years of its existence, all but a handful of
the students of Somerville College (one of Oxford University's first
women's colleges) went on, if they took jobs, to work in either
teaching or other &quot;caring&quot; professions. This was not because the work
suited their female brains, but because other professions were closed
to females. When that changed, so did women's career choices. By the
1980s, Somerville was producing more accountants than teachers. Today,
a woman graduate who remains childless can expect to rise as high and
earn as much in her lifetime as a man with the same qualifications.

Other social changes have been more difficult to measure precisely.
Things my own parents treated as unbreakable rules - men and women
socialising separately (even if they were in the same pub or room),
not having opposite-sex friends, pursuing different leisure
activities, playing distinct roles within the family - are no longer
rigidly adhered to. Though inequalities remain, western women have far
more freedom than they once did. The sexes even look less different
than they did two generations ago.

None of this is to say that gender has become irrelevant, or that men
and women are now in all respects equal. Wolf stresses that outside
the educated elite, economic inequalities remain marked. Others have
noted that certain problems affecting women as a group, such as the
prevalence of sexual violence, may be intensifying rather than
diminishing. But the sharp differentiation of the sexes that was once
all-pervasive in society has weakened significantly. In their
aspirations, their opportunities, their lifestyles, and their outlooks
on life, educated men and women are now more similar than different.

Changes of this kind are never painless. Our ideas, our feelings, our
sense of who we are, and our beliefs about what is right do not always
keep pace with technological and economic changes. This is not because
our ways of thinking have been wired into our brains since the Stone
Age. It is because culture is not, in fact, the superficial and
ephemeral thing it is often taken for. (Conversely, biology is not the
fixed and unalterable thing it is presented as in books like Why Men
Don't Iron.) Culture change is hard: it causes anxiety, conflict and,
in some quarters, resistance. That is why the myth of Mars and Venus
has had such a warm reception from the educated western middle
classes.

Change and the problem of couple communication

The target audience for Mars and Venus material is prototypically a
middle-class one, and the main theme is the difficulty middle-class
men and women have communicating with one another. That difficulty -
presented, typically, as age-old and universal - is put down to the
fact that men and women inhabit separate social worlds, which give
them mutually incomprehensible ways of using and interpreting
language. But that raises the question of why male-female
(mis)communication does not seem to be such a problem in other
societies and communities. More puzzling still, if its cause is indeed
social segregation, the communities in which it is seen as a major
issue appear to be those where there is least segregation.

In her classic 1962 study Blue Collar Marriage, the sociologist Mirra
Komarovsky reported that the working-class American women she
interviewed did not generally expect to have extended conversations
with their husbands. In their community, sex segregation was
extensive: for everyday companionship and emotional support, they
relied on female friends and kin. Most did not regard this as settling
for second best. To them it seemed not natural, but on the contrary,
rather eccentric to want your spouse to be your best friend.

This attitude is typical of traditional societies and traditional
working-class communities. The ideal of &quot;companionate marriage&quot;, in
which the partners do most things together, spend a lot of time
interacting and regard each other as friends, is essentially a modern,
middle-class one. It is made possible by the fact that middle-class
men and women do not, in fact, inhabit separate social worlds, and it
is made necessary by the fact that middle-class men and women
generally do not have the close-knit, locally based networks of
same-sex friends and kin that supported Komarovsky's subjects.

Today, far fewer westerners live in communities like the one described
in Blue Collar Marriage. Economic and social changes - greater
mobility, smaller families, increasing rates of divorce - have
weakened the bonds that held traditional families and communities
together. One result has been to reduce the size of most people's
support networks, making them more reliant on a small number of
&quot;significant others&quot;. In these conditions people expect more from
communication with their spouse or partner. When it falls short of
their high expectations, the stage is set for communication between
men and women to be perceived as a serious social problem.

There are other reasons for that perception. The more similar men and
women become, the more they are in direct competition for jobs,
status, money, leisure time and personal freedom. My parents, who
married in the mid-50s, never argued about who should take out the
trash, pick up groceries, wash dishes, drive the car, choose what to
watch on TV, or make financial decisions. Nor were they ever in
conflict about whose job came first or whose life had to be fitted
around domestic commitments. These things were settled in advance by
the basic fact of gender difference. For couples today, by contrast,
everything is up for negotiation. That has the potential to lead to
conflicts.

A recurring theme in Mars and Venus literature is men's allegedly
underdeveloped capacity for empathy and caring. This testifies to what
has not changed. When Why Men Don't Iron talks about an &quot;increasing
feminisation of society&quot;, that is presumably a reference to the
greater visibility, status and influence of women in domains where
they were previously excluded. But what has happened in the past 40
years might be better described as an increasing masculinisation of
society, in the sense that the major shift has involved middle-class
women's aspirations and attitudes becoming more like men's, focused on
individual achievement and individual freedom. Alison Wolf points out
that this has led to a massive exodus of middle-class women from the
engagement in paid and unpaid caring that once occupied them for most
of their lives.

This change has not been compensated for by any reciprocal shift in
men's attitudes. Although we hear much about the so-called &quot;new man&quot;
with his commitment to domesticity and active parenthood, surveys
consistently find that men's contribution to both domestic work and
routine forms of childcare is not much greater than before. Women are
still doing most of the caring, but - unsurprisingly, given how much
else they now do - they are more inclined to question why it should
fall to them alone. That is another source of conflict in contemporary
male-female relationships.

Elite women often resolve the problem by contracting out what is still
regarded as &quot;their&quot; work to less privileged women: paid nannies,
cleaners and carers. Something that cannot easily be contracted out,
however, is the task of caring for a partner's emotional needs. It is
not a coincidence that one of the key issues Mars and Venus books
address is women's complaint that &quot;I take care of his feelings, but he
doesn't take care of mine&quot;.

The genius of the myth of Mars and Venus is to acknowledge the
problems many people are now experiencing as a result of social
change, while explaining those problems and conflicts in a way that
implies they have nothing to do with social change. They are as old as
humanity (quite literally, in some versions of the myth) and their
root cause is the irreducible difference between the sexes. The
solution, it follows, is to do nothing: we should accept what cannot
be altered, and suppress any urge to apportion blame.

In practice this tends to result in women being made responsible for
ensuring that communication flows smoothly. Once again, &quot;personal
stuff&quot; is assumed to be women's business rather than the business of
both sexes. But this isn't just personal stuff: these problems are
symptomatic of deeper social dislocations. The belief that they are
timeless, natural and inevitable stops us thinking about what social
arrangements might work better than our present ones in a society that
can no longer be run on the old assumptions about what men and women
do.

When the myth of Mars and Venus emphasises that our modern problems
are caused by age-old natural differences, it is by implication saying
that nothing important has changed. However similar men and women
appear on the surface - getting the same education, doing the same
jobs, earning the same money, seeking out the same pleasures - at a
deeper level, in their minds, they are still fundamentally different.
That too is reassuring to many people, because most of us do not like
change. And even if gender no longer determines our life experiences
to the extent it once did, it remains an important part of our
identities, our social lives, and our sexual lives. We may not want to
return to the traditional arrangement between the sexes, but that does
not mean we want to live in a world where the difference between men
and women is no more significant than whether someone is right- or
left-handed.

But if we want real understanding to take the place of mythology, we
need to reject trite formulas and sweeping claims about male and
female language use. The evidence is more in line with what it says on
a postcard someone once sent me: &quot;Men are from Earth. Women are from
Earth. Deal with it.&quot; Clinging to myths about the way men and women
communicate is no way to deal with it. To deal with the problems and
opportunities facing men and women now, we must look beyond Mars and
Venus.
