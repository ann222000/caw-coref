People are also picking cotton for your ribbons and bows.  The
worker's comp sht totally disgraces me since there are not many
schizophrenics that get hired on the spot..  You gotta wear the normal
human mask or use the Mask of the Sun.. Mask of the son.. Who the fuck
needs reasons?  The kids already know you can't make deep sense out of
all this mess.. they learn quicker these days and to the point they
diassemble things.  I can live my life without reasons..there is no
point.  Fact!  This is not a rolling drama.. Jesus took a large crap
on the corner of his friend's house.. Fact.. we only have facts.. no
philosophical meaning..just millions of people in America who live
without considering the deeper meanings of life and instead deal with
concrete things.. Time for a song..

I prayed just to hear you say
I am here for you..for you.. for your love
And just for you..
If I faulter will you forgive it?
Will you still be the same tomorrow?
Everytime II faulter you've spoken words to me
It gave me no desire to live
It made me lose my friends
And when you're coming down on me
You talk just too loud..
You can't control was you set loose
Jack jumped over the candlestick..
You can't take me over..take control
An android.. a robot set under Laws..
Why can't the hidden face surface
It's like its caught inside
As the chains keep me
Going and doing what I need to do..
As the soul turns into a creature
But you're wrapped tight screaming..

We both Have the Same Sick Master (by Seung B. Kim)
