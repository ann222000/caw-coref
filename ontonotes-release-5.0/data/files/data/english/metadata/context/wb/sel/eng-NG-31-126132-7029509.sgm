David and Gary, this is my response to Michael Walsh and John ? who
runs www.adolfthegreat.com and Veronica who runs http://www.adolfhitlerresearchsociety.org/ .

That you men deal in information exchange, and believe the information
fed to us by the media (which is all entirely Jewish owned, including
most universitys are Jewish controlled by their controlling all
monies), you have been misled severely regarding Adolf Hitler, who was
the reincarnated Thomas Jefferson, founding father of the United
States.

Study the URLs and challenge my claims I'm making in this email.
You'll find that you've been duped, in order to war a man because he
only wanted to protect his country culture and identity, by being self-
determined by being self-reliant. International Jewish bankers wanted
control of Germany to exploit German markets for their personal gain.
Hitler knew this and stopped it dead. That's why they cornered him
into war, by mass murdering his citizens that were abducted by the
Treaty of Versailles.

David writes about "Silent Theft" - but cannot identify the thieves.
The thieves are Jews, in order to establish a Communism, by mimicry,
of democracy. Hitler is innocent of all you believe him to be guilty.
He's a great hero, and very caring human being, who never wanted to
hurt anyone. He was framed by the Jewish media, convicted of crimes he
did not commit. Vindicate him and learn from him, gentlemen. The two
URLs above will help you.
---------------------------
Mike/John taking for granted that this resource (URL) is valid (Yale
is heavily Jewish controlled), it looks like Hitler attacked
Netherlands because England and France would have had he not, gotten
the Netherlands to peacefully allow them to use their geography as
access to war Germany (Ruhr).

The same way Poland was used as a Patsy to lure Hitler into war, by
mass murder and mass beatings of German citizens on the Sarr Danzig
corridor, of which they knew would be the last straw to push Hitler to
war (because he was desirous to avoid war at all costs but the murder
of German citizens trumped all he could do), using the Netherlands was
their next patsy to get at him and beat him, so he attacked first.

Mass Murder of German citizens to lure Hitler to start WW2, when
really the Jews started WW2, but cloaked this by ownership of all
media: http://litek.ws/k0nsl/detox/Bromberg1.html

I am confident that the photos on the URL of German citizens executed
and beaten by Poles, to lure Hitler to attack, are credible and not
staged by Hitler. But it is possible they are not Germans, are are
Jews or Poles, mass murdered by Hitler (I gotta play the devils
advocate). So how can we know? This URL is better showing why Hitler
attacked Poland in 1939 - AGAIN - the mass murder of German citizens,
COLD BLOODED murder http://judicial-inc.biz/Broomberg.htm to get him
into war, this murder was the reason why Hitler invaded Poland. Please
let me know if I am mistaken in any of my judgements or if any data
provided here is lies to frame Hitler in criminal acts of which to war
him.

Until the cold blooded murder occured (and has been censored by the
Jews by their exclusive ownership of media), Hitler as a master at
avoiding their continued attempts to lure Germany into war. He was
like Thomas Jefferson (har har), he could not be beaten politically,
economically, strategically void physical war, so the Jews had to
revert to physical acts, in that all their henious subversion and
subterfuge did not work on him, he was a master at their game, beyond
what they were capable of. So they had to revert to hiring murdering
henchman to do that job - GET HITLER INTO WARFARE. Hitler is an
innocent man and needs to be vindicated, and both of you John and
Michael are great foundations for this to start, and expand. Not to
mention Veronica at http://www.adolfhitlerresearchsociety.org/

Hitlers speech regarding his invasion of Netherlands:

" We have an Achilles heel: The Ruhr. The progress of the war depends
on the possession of the Ruhr. If England and France push through
Belgium and Holland into the Ruhr, we shall be in the greatest
danger.... Certainly England and France will assume the offensive
against Germany when they are armed. England and France have means of
pressure to bring Belgium and Holland to request English and French
help. In Belgium and Holland the sympathies are all for France and
England.... If the French Army marches into Belgium in order to attack
us, it will be too late for us. We must anticipate them.... We shall
sow the English coast with mines which cannot be cleared. This mine
warfare with the Luftwaffe demands a different starting point. England
cannot live without its imports. We can feed ourselves. The permanent
sowing of mines on the English coasts will bring England to her knees.
However, this can only occur if we have occupied Belgium and
Holland . . . My decision is unchangeable; I shall attack France and
England at the most favourable and quickest moment. Breach of the
neutrality of Belgium and Holland is meaningless. No one will question
that when we have won. We shall not bring about the breach of
neutrality as idiotically as it was in 1914. If we do not break the
neutrality, then England and France will. Without attack, the war is
not to be ended victoriously."

On the 10th May, 1940, the German forces invaded the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxemburg. On the same day the German Ambassadors handed
to the Netherlands and Belgian Governments a memorandum alleging that
the British and French armies, with the consent of Belgium and
Holland, were planning to march through those countries to attack the
Ruhr, and justifying the invasion on these grounds. Germany, however,
assured the Netherlands and Belgium that their integrity and their
possessions would be respected. A similar memorandum was delivered to
Luxemburg on the same date.
