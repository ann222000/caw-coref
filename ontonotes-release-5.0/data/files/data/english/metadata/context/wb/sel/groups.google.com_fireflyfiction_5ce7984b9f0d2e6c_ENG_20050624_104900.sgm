_TRAUMA MEDICINE_: _Chapter 20_
_Sometimes you need a doctor_

_RATING_ - _R_

_WARNING_ .... Mal and Simon flavoured _SLASH_, but not graphic. Not in this
chapter. ;-)

With thanks for scrupulous beta-ing to the _wedjateye_ formerly known as
_wedjat_.

* * * * *

Zoe hooks a couple of grenades onto her belt. She ain't taking any chances and
she's glad to see Jayne's of like mind. His belt is bristling with
fierce-looking blades, he's got two large guns stuffed into his holsters and is
cradling Vera against his chest.

&quot;Ready?&quot; Zoe asks.

&quot;Hell, yeah!&quot; he declares, spittin' on the deck-plating for emphasis an'
ignorin' Zoe's Do-you-have-to? scowl. &quot;If'n there's any Feds still waitin' for
us, I ain't goin' down without a fight.&quot;

Mal's boots ring out on the staircase as he comes hurryin' down to join the
mercenary and his First Mate. He casts a mildly disapprovin' eye over them. &quot;I
ain't expectin' that much trouble.&quot;

&quot;Better safe than sorry, Sir,&quot; Zoe points out and Mal grunts in resigned
agreement.

Serenity's engine tone changes as the reverse thrust comes on and the landing
gear extends. Mal stands taller, bracin' himself for whatever awaits them on
New Melbourne.

&quot;Touchdown in five, four ...&quot; Wash advises over the comm.

Followed by the others, Mal climbs up onto the mule. The vehicle ain't much to
look at after havin' been pressed into service on Niska's skyplex but at least
Kaylee's got it workin' again. That girl's a ruttin' genius with machinery an'
Mal's eager to have her back on his ship where she belongs. Least *she* wants
to come back.

Not like some.

&quot;Sir?&quot;

Mal starts at the sound of Zoe's voice and realizes that the cargo bay door has
already lowered. He turns the ignition and the mule rolls forward out onto the
damp, green surface of a planet Mal's already decided he don't much like. Too
much water an' that all-pervasive stink of fish. There's a few local folk to be
seen - fishermen mostly, them an' fish processors - going about their business.
No sign of any Feds.

The mule arrives at a crossroads and Mal looks to Zoe for directions. &quot;Left
here, right at the next,&quot; she says, consulting her Pos-Loc. &quot;Then straight
ahead for about two miles.&quot;

They drive on in silence, each envisaging a different sort of disaster having
befallen Inara's shuttle. None of them can quite believe this ain't a trap.
Those Feds were too easily satisfied with a couple of ident cards. It never
normally goes that smooth.

But when at last they locate the shuttle, Kaylee and Book are lounging outside
on the grass, looking out for them. Kaylee waves her arms wildly over her
head.

Mal pulls the mule to a halt as she runs over to greet him.

&quot;Oh Cap'n!&quot; she cries, flingin' her arms around his neck. &quot;I'm so sorry. I
tried to stop her, really I did, but she wou'n't hear none of it. Said she had
her plans all set an' she was goin' back to Sihnon.&quot; And with that the mechanic
buries her face into Mal's shirt and begins weepin' in earnest.

&quot;Ain't no point in cryin', *mei-mei*,&quot; Mal tells her, steelin' himself against
her tears 'fore they dissolve him. &quot;Inara's a free agent. Up to her what she
does.&quot;

Kaylee looks up at him in astonishment. &quot;You ain't even gonna try an' fetch her
back?&quot;

Mal shakes his head. &quot;No point.&quot; He looks across at the Shepherd. &quot;We good to
go?&quot;

Book nods.

Mal turns to Zoe. &quot;Best you pilot the shuttle back to the ship. Never could fly
that thing my own self.&quot;

The echo of Inara's words falls painfully on Mal's ears. He can't help but wish
she'd gone sooner if she had to go at all. Before things between them got
complicated. Hell, right now he wishes he'd never met her.

He pushes Kaylee gently away. &quot;You get in with the others now, *xiao mei-mei*
an' I'll see you back on the ship.&quot;

Making a valiant attempt to smile, Kaylee wipes her eyes. &quot;Aye aye, Cap'n.&quot;

* * * * *

Inara accepts a glass of iced herbal tea from the smartly dressed young man and
takes it into the private booth she has rented. Xuefang is evidently a much
more civilized planet that its reputation would imply.

&quot;If that will be all, madam?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Thank you.&quot;

The waiter withdraws and Inara taps a spot on the screen in front of her. She
scrolls down the list of options and opens a Cortex link. The screen changes
colour and Inara speaks into the mic. &quot;Planet: Sihnon. House Madrassa. House
Priestess.&quot;

The booth fills with music as light and sweet as flowing water and Inara
relaxes back into her chair. It will be good to get back to the Central Planets
where everything is ordered and calm and predictable. And away from this life
where everything is complicated and messy, where feelings arise unbidden and
refuse to be ignored.

The music fades and a woman's face appears on the screen. &quot;Inara, *xiao jie*,
this is indeed a pleasure.&quot;

Inara bows her head. &quot;The pleasure is mine, *xiao pengyou*.&quot;

&quot;You look well, Inara. Your new life has made you even more beautiful. It must
suit you.&quot;

Inara raises her eyes. &quot;You are most kind. But I find it does not suit me as
well as I had expected. I want - I *would like* to return to House Madrassa.
With your permission.&quot;

The lovely face on the screen remains serene and impassive even as the perfect
mouth speaks the terrible words &quot;I am afraid I cannot give you that permission, *
xiao jie*. Not in the foreseeable future, at least.&quot;

Inara goes cold and it takes a huge effort of will to keep the sudden panic
filling her out of her voice. &quot;But why?&quot;

&quot;Earlier today, Inara, we were visited by Federal agents- *Federal agents* -
who demanded access to your records.&quot;

Inara would argue that her records are in perfect order and that she has done
nothing wrong, if that were the point of the House Priestess' remark. But it is
not. Companions are required to conduct themselves in such a way that their
integrity is never even questioned, let alone subjected to official scrutiny.

She hangs her head. &quot;How long, *xiao ma ma*?&quot;

The House Priestess answers with uncharacteristic bluntness. &quot;That I cannot
say. Your licence has been temporarily revoked. Pending investigation.&quot;

Were it not for her training, Inara would gasp. She is no longer endorsed by
the Guild? How will she live?

&quot;If - I mean *when* - you are reinstated we will speak again. But not until
then. *Dong ma*?&quot;

Inara lifts her chin and smiles with professional calm. &quot;Perfectly. *Xie-xie
ni*.&quot;

* * * * * *

River presents Simon with an exquisitely detailed drawing of a row of nesting
dolls. *Another* exquisitely detailed drawing of a row of nesting dolls. &quot;It's
a compulsion,&quot; she tells him brightly.

He sighs and squeezes her hand, trying to make the best of it. &quot;It's beautiful.&quot;

River's face clouds over and she pulls away from him. &quot;No, it isn't, you *jing
chang meiyong de* boob! It's ugly and painful and it's gotta stop, *dong
ma*?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Simon asks, bewildered, making a mental note to review his sister's
medication. &quot;I don't understand-&quot;

River's expression melts from one of annoyance into one of affection. &quot;Gorram
stupid boy,&quot; she smiles, stroking her fingers lightly over his bruised mouth
and cut lip. &quot;Can't read the picture. Needs words.&quot;

Simon shrugs helplessly, feeling overwhelmed by the enormity of what's been
done to her and by his own inability to put it right.

River tugs at his hand. &quot;Quickly, Simon. The scarecrow's coming back.&quot;

Although he has no idea what she means, Simon allows her to drag him out of the
passenger dorm into the cargo bay just as Mal returns on the mule.

&quot;The others back?&quot; The Captain asks as he pulls into the mule's parking bay,
his brisk business-like tone falterin' a mite when his eyes meet Simon's. He
looks quickly away. Made the boy a promise. Ain't gonna go breakin' it. &quot;No
hitches?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Simon says, noticing the shadows under Mal's eyes and the tight little
lines around his mouth. He'd like to comfort him but can't because - much as it
pains him to admit it - this is about Inara, not Simon. &quot;They're all safely
back on board.&quot;

&quot;All but one,&quot; River points out, making Simon clap a horrified hand to the side
of his face. Hurriedly he tries to shush her, but she won't be silenced. Mal's
heart is aching and River longs to soothe the hurt, to explain that it's not
what he thinks. &quot;She made a deal,&quot; she tells him softly, laying a hand on his
arm.

Mal shakes it off and his expression darkens. He glares first at River, then at
Simon. For a moment there's an ominous silence, then Mal says bitterly &quot;Reckon
she did at that.&quot;

&quot;Gorram stupid boy!&quot; River spits in frustration. Words, pictures, music - why
does no-one ever comprehend? She closes her eyes and her mind fills with
pictures of naked bodies, limbs entwined. A thick, heady perfume fills her
nostrils and there's a taste of salt wet on her tongue. And in her ears, the
jingle-jangle of coin changin' hands. &quot;No!&quot; she screams and begins hammering
her fists against Mal's chest. &quot;Candles and prayers mats!&quot;

Mal catches her flailin' arms an' pins them to her sides. &quot;This gotta stop,&quot; he
growls at Simon cos he jus' ain't in the mood for this. Not today. Not now.

&quot;I know. I'm sorry. I ... River, *mei-mei*, please -&quot;

Simon holds his arms out to his sister and Mal watches as they seem to close in
slow motion around her. Strong. Certain.

Mal takes a deep breath and stalks away.

River's anger subsides as quickly as it came. &quot;*Told* you,&quot; she smiles at
Simon. &quot;It's gotta stop.&quot;

* * * * *

&quot;It's not much,&quot; Book apologizes, placing the steaming casserole dish down on
the dining table. &quot;Afraid our stocks of fresh produce are running mighty
low.&quot;

&quot;Like to run a deal lower, we don't find a job soon,&quot; Mal replies grimly,
helping himself to a single ladleful of the dish's unappetizing contents.
&quot;Gonna have to introduce rationin'. Till I say otherwise, everybody eats every
gorram thing they put on their plate an' no eatin' between meals.&quot; He pauses
and there's a general murmur of agreement. &quot;That applies to you too, li'l
Kaylee. No sneakin' protein bars up to the engine room where you think no-one
knows you're eatin' 'em.&quot;

Kaylee gasps, flushes and looks down miserably at the large pile of food in
front of her. She always eats too much when she's unhappy an' cos of that the
Cap'n thinks she's selfish an' greedy. Mayhap she *is*. Tears well in her eyes
and start to spill down her cheeks.

&quot;*Zao cao*!&quot; Mal snaps. &quot;Ain't you done enough weepin' for one day?&quot;

His sharp words only make Kaylee cry harder.

Jayne slams his cutlery down on the table. &quot;Hell, Mal, it ain't her fault
'Nara's gone,&quot; he says, putting a protective arm around the mechanic's shaking
shoulders. &quot;If'n it's anyone's fault, it's your'n.&quot;

Mal clenches his jaw and narrows his eyes. &quot;Might wanna watch that mouth,
Jayne.&quot;

&quot;Tell the truth and shame the devil,&quot; River puts in cheerfully.

&quot;River-&quot;

&quot;Might wanna watch *your* mouth too, missy,&quot; Mal snarls. &quot; 'less you wanna be
confined to your quarters for a month.&quot;

&quot;She didn't mean anything!&quot; Simon defends his sister hotly. &quot;You know she
didn't. Don't take your bad mood out on my sister, Mal or ..&quot;

&quot;Or what? You'll leave too? Might be best for everyone if you did.&quot;

Simon reels back in his seat an' Mal could bite his own tongue off. That wa'n't
what he wanted to say. He don't want Simon to leave. Not now. Not never. But he
can't make him stay any more than he could Inara. Can't offer *him* nothin'
either. He swallows awkwardly, too agitated an' wretched to know how to fix
this. Simon's got an arm around River an' is glarin' at him, Kaylee's nuzzled
up against Jayne who's refusin' to be cowed an' Zoe's gazin' at Mal every kind
of sad an' exasperated whilst Wash holds her hand. Meanwhile that gorram
Preacher's wearin' a knowin' half-smile like God his very own self was
whisperin' into his ear.

Everbody's got somebody except Mal. An' that's the way it's always gonna be.
Always gotta be. Cos he's dangerous. Hurts people.

The room starts to spin. It's hot and Mal's head's hurtin' like *diyu*. At
least Kaylee's sobs are slowin', fadin' an' turnin' into somethin' quieter.
Face pressed against Jayne's chest, she's whimperin' now.

&quot;Mal!&quot;

&quot;*Tamade hundan*!&quot;

&quot;Captain!&quot;

&quot;Sir!&quot;

Mal shakes his head an' blinks. What? Where? Hunh?

&quot; 's'all right. I'm all right,&quot; Kaylee's insistin', although she's huddled even
closer into Jayne's embrace. &quot;Cap'n's tired, is all.&quot;

Mal realizes he's on his feet but he don't remember gettin' up.

Zoe links her arm through his. &quot;Think you could use a lie-down, Sir,&quot; she says
firmly.

&quot;Think you might not be wrong about at that,&quot; Mal mumbles, offerin' no
resistance as she steers him out into the hallway an' off to his bunk.

The rest of the crew stare at each other. Was Mal really about to hit Kaylee
just then?

River's head is tipped to one side and her eyes are troubled. She turns to
Simon. &quot;He's gettin' worse, isn't he?&quot;

Simon looks down at his plate, aware that everyone is awaiting his diagnosis.
&quot;Yes,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;He is.&quot;

* * * * *

&quot;Your duties would be mostly of a light domestic nature. Cooking, cleaning,
tending to the kitchen garden. Occasionally I may require you to ....&quot;

Saffron isn't really listening to the woman interviewing her. She's too busy
congratulating herself on having discovered the only place worth robbing on
this whole piece of crap moon and scanning the room for items of value. For a
few horrific days there, Saffron was afraid she'd end up spending the rest of
her days on Burgess Moon with no hope of ever getting her hands on that reward
money for turning over the Tams to the Feds.

The trail went gone cold just after St Alban's, but one evening she picked up a
read on Early's ship heading out towards New Melbourne. Unfortunately for her,
by then she was out of money and relying on the kindness of strangers - well,
not so much on their kindness as their gullibility. Till one of them caught her
helping herself to his petty cash and dumped her on this dirt-ball.

&quot; ... I find it hard to manage on my own,&quot; Belinda Burgess concludes.

Saffron realizes she's expected to say something and opts for the first things
that pops into her mind. &quot;On your own, ma'am?&quot;

Belinda sniffs and turns her head away. &quot;I lost my husband. Just over month
ago.&quot;

&quot;I sure am sorry to hear that,&quot; Saffron says in her most sympathetic tones.

Belinda Burgess acknowledges her condolences with a tilt of her head, but says
nothing. There's something about this woman's bearing that tells Saffron that
she's not used to the concern or sympathy of others. And yet there's something
in her eyes that says she craves both.

&quot;Did he ... did he suffer?&quot; Saffron asks gently.

&quot;Suffer? Suffer?&quot; To Saffron's alarm the other woman starts laughing
hysterically. &quot;Yes, my dear. He did suffer. He was murdered. Murdered in cold
blood. All thanks to a man calling himself Malcolm Reynolds.&quot;

Saffron gasps, despite herself. Malcolm Reynolds was *here*! A month ago! Her
brain starts working overtime. What to tell the grieving widow? What to
conceal? She knows she doesn't have a lot of time to play with because she
needs to catch up with Serenity and fast. And then it comes to her in a flash
of inspiration. She'll cut Belinda Burgess in on the deal. At least until they
get the coin. After all, why part with money you don't have to?

&quot;I know Malcolm Reynolds, ma'am,&quot; Saffron announces calmly. &quot;He captains a
Firefly. Oh - I ain't a friend of his, if that's what you're thinking. He done
me all manner of wrong.&quot;

Now it's Belinda Burgess' turn to look sympathetic.

&quot;Did you know he's wanted by the Alliance for harbouring fugitives from the
law, ma'am?&quot;

&quot;Call me Belinda. No, I did not know that.&quot;

&quot;Alliance wants those fugitives back real bad, ma- *Belinda*. They're offering
a reward of five hundred thousand platinum for the pair of them. A brother and
sister.&quot;

&quot;That's a lot of money ...&quot; Belinda muses. Rance left her well-provided for,
it's true, but a woman alone has to seize her opportunities where she can.

&quot;That it is,&quot; Saffron agrees. &quot;Like I said, the Alliance wants them real bad.
So bad I don't imagine they'd be asking too many questions of anyone who turned
them in. Not about the ship they were on nor about what happened to her
crew.&quot;

At first Belinda Burgess' expression gives nothing away, making Saffron fear
she may not take the bait, but then a slow cold smile spreads across her
face.

* * * * * *

Mal ain't feelin' a whole lot better next mornin' but he's got Captain-y things
to do. Things like findin' a job. Daren't even break atmo till he knows they're
goin' some place they're gonna get paid. It's not only the food ration that's
low; fuel ain't much better.

He goes up to the bridge and turns on the Cortex screen.

&quot;One. New. Wave. Recorded,&quot; the mail system's disjointed synthesized voice
informs him. &quot;Sender: Gordon, Monty.&quot;

Mal flicks a couple of switches an' Monty's open smile lights up the screen.
Mal notes with satisfaction that his old friend's beard is comin' back in.

&quot;Malcolm Reynolds! How you doin', you old son of a gun? Still flyin'? Only
just, I reckon, knowin' what a sorry-ass operation you run. Lookin' for a job?
Heard you was headed out to New Melbourne. If you're still in that quadrant,
send me a wave. Got somethin' for you. A good payer - if you was wonderin'.
Send me a wave an' don't forget to say hello to that handsome First Mate of
yours for me.&quot;

Mal smiles, feelin' a tad happier. That big old grizzly bear always did have a
way of savin' Mal's life - literally an' metaphorically.

Mal opens a vid link. &quot;Monty Gordon, you must be a gorram Reader!&quot;

Monty laughs. &quot;Been called a lot of things, Mal, but never that. Now - you
interested in earnin' yourself a bit of hard cash?&quot;

&quot;Is the Alliance a gang of liars, murderers an' thieves? Yeah, I'm interested.
What ya got?&quot;

Monty leans forward and drops his voice. &quot;Best I don't give you the details in
case our encryption ain't all it should be. You far out from New
Melbourne?&quot;

&quot;Still in the world.&quot;

Monty grins. &quot;Well that's shiny. I'll get you a meet with my contact and let
you know the time and place before nightfall, okay?&quot;

&quot;*Shi a*,&quot; Mal nods. &quot;An' thanks. I'm grateful.&quot;

&quot;No need to thank me, Mal but since I'm pickin' up the next leg of the run
let's just say you owe me a few beers on New Hall.&quot;

* * * * *

&quot;*Kewu de yun ben de baojun*!&quot; River hisses at her brother, bombarding him
with cushions and anything else that comes to hand.

Wash ducks out of the way of a ricocheting coffee mug. &quot;Poor kid,&quot; he says
kindly, stooping down to pick up the broken pieces. &quot;She having another bad
day? When I think what those Alliance *hundans* did to her, I-&quot;

&quot;I'm afraid this isn't about what the Alliance did,&quot; Simon interrupts, dodging
another cushion. &quot;It's about her new treatment programme.&quot;

A coffee table comes flying past the medic and lands with a splintering crack
on the floor beside the pilot. &quot;Seems to be going well,&quot; Wash comments drily
without taking his eyes from River and her next missile - the crew's
chessboard.

&quot;Too early to say,&quot; Simon hedges. &quot;It's only just started.&quot;

The chessboard takes flight, complete with chessmen, which scatter noisily
across the commons. Wash pulls a face. &quot;What in the good gorram did you give
her Doc?&quot;

&quot;I didn't give her anything,&quot; Simon explains, taking advantage of River having
exhausted her arsenal to take hold of her hands. &quot;I took her drawing things
away.&quot;

Wash tugs at his hair. &quot;I'm confused.&quot;

All the fight drains out of River and she slumps down into a chair, muttering
to herself.

&quot;I realized that I've been enabling her compulsion when I should have been
challenging it,&quot; Simon explains, taking his sister's hands in his. &quot;It's only
by confronting this compulsion of hers to keep drawing Russian dolls that I'm
going to understand what's behind it.&quot; He purses his lips. &quot;Or at least, that's
the plan.&quot;

&quot;Gotta have a plan,&quot; River says without looking up.

Wash frowns. &quot;Don't wanna tell you your job, Simon, but from the looks of
this...&quot; He invites Simon to survey the destruction his sister has wrought with
a wave of his hand, &quot;You could end up getting seriously hurt.&quot;

River raises her head and fixes Wash with a surprisingly sharp look.

&quot;He will.&quot;

* * * * *

&quot;Only the basics, mind,&quot; Mal reminds Kaylee firmly, when they reach Maintown.
&quot;Nothin' fancy. Jus' what we can't do without, *dong ma*?&quot;

&quot;Aye aye, Cap'n,&quot; she agrees cheerfully turning the small handful of coin he
counted out earlier over in her pocket. Beside her River giggles and
salutes.

Mal turns to Book. &quot;Same with the kitchen supplies, Shepherd. Jus' what we need
to make the protein ration taste of somethin'.&quot; He catches sight of the anxiety
etched into Simon's face. &quot;An' keep an eye out for Feds, will ya?&quot;

&quot;Always do,&quot; Book answers with a wink at the medic before escorting the girls
in the direction of the market traders' stalls.

The bar Mal's lookin' for is in the opposite direction, down a dark alley.
Monty's contact thought it'd be better to meet here, out of the way of pryin'
eyes.

Simon doesn't like the alley way - it reminds him of one on Persephone he'd
rather forget. He doesn't like the bar much either and wishes Mal hadn't needed
him to help load the cargo. But the Captain reckoned the sooner they got it on
Serenity and got out of the world the better, and Simon could see the sense in
that. Besides, since administering the anahaemofluxin Inara offered him, his
leg has almost fully healed. He really has no excuse for not helping out.

No sooner are the four of them settled at a table with a mugful of some
foul-tasting brew in front of them than a tall, thin man gets up from his seat
in a corner and approaches.

&quot;Malcolm Reynolds?&quot; he asks in an undertone.

&quot;Who's askin'?&quot;

&quot;Think you know. Meet me in the back room in five. You an' one other.&quot;

As soon as he disappears into a room behind the bar Zoe speaks up. &quot;Think we
can trust him?&quot; She's got a bad feelin' about this. A sick-in-the-stomach kinda
feelin'. So bad this beer ain't sittin' right.

Mal shrugs. &quot;Gonna have to. Anyhow, he comes with Monty's recommendation.
Should be solid enough.&quot;

&quot;Need him to be more than solid if we're gonna be transporting explosives to a
border planet, Sir.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well Monty says he is. An' we need the money. So drink up an' let's go
talk business. You two wait here.&quot;

Five minutes later, Jayne and Simon are sitting together in rather awkward
silence, uncomfortably aware that many of the bar's other customers are
regarding them with, if not actual hostility, then certainly with
suspicion.

&quot;I'll be glad when we're back on the ship,&quot; Simon says eventually.

&quot;Gotta get the cargo first.&quot; Jayne drains his mug. &quot;Wan' another?&quot;

Simon eyes the dregs of what he hoped would be his only drink in this
establishment. &quot;If I have to.&quot;

This time Jayne brings back not only two mugs of the house ale but also a
couple of shorts. Simon refuses the whiskey so the mercenary downs both, one
after the other. A warm glow spreads through him an' suddenly the Doc don't
seem like quite such bad company after all. Specially now Jayne knows about
...

&quot;So,&quot; he begins conversationally, leanin' back in his chair, &quot;How long you been
sly, Doc?&quot;

Simon splutters a mouthful of beer down his vest and stares dumbstruck at the
mercenary for a moment until the simple directness of the question strikes him
as funny. &quot;All my life, Jayne,&quot; he smiles.

&quot;Right.&quot; Jayne nods sagely. &quot;Guess it's a life-time kinda deal, eh?&quot;

&quot;Mostly.&quot;

&quot;Right&quot; Jayne is silent for a while, thinking. Then he asks another blunt
question that has Simon spluttering all over again. &quot;You ain't interested in me
at all, are ya?&quot;

&quot;Good God, no!&quot; Simon exclaims, horrified.

Jayne grunts, looking almost offended.

&quot;Not that you're not a very attractive man,&quot; Simon finds himself adding
hastily. &quot;It's just ...&quot; *Oh shit*. How in the 'verse did he end up talking to
Jayne like this?

&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; the mercenary says. &quot;I ain't your type. Well, thank God for
that! Cos you know I'd have to put a bullet in ya if ya *was* interested,
right?&quot;

Simon smiles. &quot;Obviously.&quot;

Jayne stands up.

&quot;Where are you going? The Captain said-&quot;

&quot;Gotta bit o' shoppin' to do. Don't worry, Doc. I'll be back before you've had
time to miss me.&quot;

And with that Jayne disappears through the saloon doors. Gonna get somethin'
real nice for Kaylee. It'll be her birthday in a coupla weeks an' Jayne knows
what great store she sets by birthdays. Look at all that fuss she went to for
the Doc.

It don't take Jayne long to find what he's lookin' for. The stall holder wraps
it up all pretty like an' Jayne hands over more money than he's ever spent on a
gift for anyone. He tucks the little package into the pocket of his pants and
heads back to the bar ...

... where Simon Tam is bein' pummelled by a trio of young fellas with a lot to
prove an', in Jayne's assessment, not much to prove it with. For a few seconds
he watches the action. Simon's scramblin' back to his feet an' aimin' a punch
at the biggest one's jaw. Nearly gets him too, only the little one cracks him
over the back of the head an' the Doc goes down again. Looks like it's all
over, Jayne thinks sourly. They've had their fun. But no! That gorram *feng le*
medic's haulin' hisself to his feet again an' this time he actually manages to
land a punch on the little one. Right. That's e-gorram-nough, Jayne decides. He
grabs the biggest fella by the hair and shoves him forwards onto the ground.
His ass is jus' beggin' to be kicked, so Jayne obliges.

Simon's other two assailants rush Jayne at once but he seizes both by the
scruff of the neck and drives them into each other instead, relishin' the sound
of their skulls crackin' together.

At this very moment, Mal and Zoe emerge from the back room. Mal shoots a stern
questionin' look at Jayne whose nod towards Simon offers some kinda explanation
for the brawlin'. The Doc's on his feet an' clearly only a tad bruised and
shaken but that don't stop Mal feelin' an upsurge of murderous rage towards the
two youths Jayne's unceremoniously dumpin' on the floor. Then a pang of
conscience reminds him that he's done much the same to Simon his own self.

Simon catches Mal's eye and gives him a small self-conscious smile. Mal nods
and indicates the door with an urgent tilt of his head. They just about reach
the exit when suddenly the rest of the bar's clientele start clappin' an'
cheerin'.

Mal and Zoe exchange a look of relief.

&quot;The goods ain't far from here,&quot; Mal announces as soon as they're out in the
street. &quot;We get it loaded an' we get gone. Already attracted more'n enough
attention.&quot;

Jayne takes the seat beside Simon. &quot;Di'n't they teach you nothin' useful at
that med school o' yours?&quot; he asks.

&quot;Apparently not,&quot; Simon replies ruefully, tasting blood in his mouth.

Colonel Steadman is an easy man to please, Inara realizes as he suddenly stills
beneath her and a little moan escapes his lips. Easy to please, restrained and
a perfect gentlemen. She could have chosen far worse. Particularly now that she
has been denied access to the Guild's screening methods.

It was a risk coming here, to his house, but he has been kindness itself,
treating her with the utmost respect as though she were still a Registered
Companion and not merely a common whore. It is good to know her instincts are
still sound.

&quot;That was most enjoyable, my dear,&quot; he compliments her as soon as he gets his
breath back.

Inara smiles and lowers her lashes. &quot;*Xie-xie*. It was not entirely unpleasant
for me either.&quot;

The Colonel brushes aside her attempt at flattery with a kind laugh. &quot;Well,
that's very charming of you, but I'm not such as old fool as to believe you.
Beautiful young thing like you needs a man of her own age. I say! I have my
nephew staying. I'm sure he's more your type. What about if I .. I mean, if
you're agreeable, of course. Poor boy hasn't had much luck with the ladies of
late. Think he's a bit self-conscious about that duelling scar even though I
told him the ladies like a warrior. You see I'm not as convincing as you'd be.
What do you say? You'd be doing him an enormous favour. And me too. Might be
able to stop worrying about the lad if ... Sorry, my dear,&quot; he breaks off
suddenly self-conscious at his own enthusiasm for the proposal. &quot;I'm getting
carried away. I'm good for his payment - if you decide to accept the
offer.&quot;

Inara smiles to conceal her discomfort at such frank talk of money. She
supposes it is something she will have to get used to. &quot;I'd be honoured. But
first, if I may, I'd like to freshen up.&quot;

Colonel Steadman beams happily at her. &quot;Of course. Bathroom's through that door
to your left. What shall we say? Half an hour? An hour?&quot;

A little more than hour later, Inara has bathed, remade the Colonel's king-size
beds with fresh sheets and reapplied her makeup.

A knock sounds on the heavy wooden door.

Inara crosses the room to open it. &quot;*Qing jin*,&quot; she murmurs demurely, inviting
her new client into the room.

&quot;Well, well,&quot; a familiar voice remarks, the surprise in it rapidly turning into
something more sinister. &quot;Inara Serra!&quot;

Her mouth falls open.

&quot;Atherton ....&quot;

Taking a breather from unloading the cargo, Simon looks up to see Zoe
hesitating over picking up a crate. All of a sudden she straightens up and
claps a hand to her mouth.

&quot;Zoe?&quot;

Her eyes are wide as she shakes her head. She looks like she might be sick.

&quot;Zoe?&quot; he asks again. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

She swallows and takes a deep breath. &quot;I'm fine, Doctor.&quot;

&quot;Well ya look terrible!&quot; Jayne informs her cheerily. &quot;That New Melbourne ale
too strong for ya?&quot;

&quot;Why don't you leave this to Jayne and I?&quot; Simon suggests as Zoe pales. &quot;It's
nearly all done.&quot;

&quot;Got what we need, all safe and sound!&quot; River announces from where she's
sitting with her back resting against the entrance to her favourite hidey hole.
Well, at least she's not inside it, Simon's pleased to note.

Another wave of acid bubbles up into Zoe's throat and she decides to accept
Simon's offer.

Jayne and Simon return to completing their task. This really is one helluva
loada crates. Jayne reckons them folk on Beylix mus' either be plannin' to blow
theirselves up an' put an end to their sufferin' or else they're plottin'
rebellion.

Not that he cares much either way.

He wipes the sweat from his face and glances over at Simon. The Doc ain't
flaggin' at all. Under that fancy exterior he mus' be stronger than he looks.
Certainly got a few good muscles in his arms, that's for sure. As for the rest
of him ... Jayne stops himself Right There.

&quot;Pretty strong for a Core fella, ain't ya?&quot; he comments, helping Simon move the
last pallet. &quot;So what I can't figure is why you ain't better at fightin'.&quot;

&quot;Not a lot of call for it in the O.R.&quot; Simon swings another crate into the
hold. &quot;Besides, I don't think I'm really the fighting sort.&quot;

Jayne snorts. &quot;*Everyone*'s the fightin' sort when they get their dander up.
Even you.&quot;

&quot;I don't think so.&quot;

&quot;So - you jus' gonna let every dumbass kid between here an' the Rim take a poke
whilst you turn the other cheek?&quot; Jayne sneers.

&quot;Well, no-&quot;

&quot;How you gonna stop 'em?&quot;

Simon shrugs. &quot;I don't know.&quot;

&quot;I could show ya.&quot;

&quot;Uh - I don't know-&quot;

&quot;Aw, come on, Doc! We'll finish off here an' I'll give you a lesson. It'll be
fun!&quot;

And, to Simon's immense surprise, it is. Jayne shows him how to block his
opponent with one fist and how to land a decent blow with the other, how to
centre himself so that's he's not easily knocked over and how to tense his
muscles against a punch to the stomach. Simon's a quick learner and Jayne's a
good teacher with bags of enthusiasm for his subject.

When Kaylee comes lookin' for River she's horrified to see Simon dodgin'
Jayne's massive fist an' aimin' a kick at his shins.

&quot;Simon! Jayne!&quot;

&quot;Just playing,&quot; River tells her, beckoning for her to come over and take a seat
on the floor.

&quot;Okay, now I'm gonna show ya what to do if yer opponent gets a lock on ya,&quot;
Jayne declares, grabbing Simon without warning by the neck. &quot;Can you
breathe?&quot;

&quot;Not so much,&quot; Simon wheezes.

&quot;Good. Gotta make it realistic. Now you gotta throw me off balance, see? What I
generally does is stamp on their feet, twist round, knee 'em in the balls an'
then smack 'em hard in the face whilst they're still reeling. Think you can do
that?&quot;

Simon has no air with which to reply so he just nods and stamps his foot down
as hard as he can on Jayne's toes. The pressure on Simon's windpipe eases up
immediately and he twists round and breaks free but somehow none of the rest of
it goes right. He loses his balance, Jayne loses his and they both end up on
the floor laughing.

River claps with delight.

&quot;What in the good gorram is goin' on here?&quot;

*Tamade*, it's Mal an' he ain't lookin' best pleased. Jayne gets quickly to his
feet and hauls Simon up. &quot;I'll be in my bunk,&quot; the mercenary mumbles and heads
for the stairs.

Simon Tam looks mighty pleased with himself, Mal notices.

&quot;Jayne was teaching me how to fight,&quot; the medic explains breathlessly, casting
an almost affectionate look after the big man.
