Dear Ann - Well, you scored another 'ace in the hole' with this week's
column. You're the best! Listen, you &amp; I both know that the MSM's never
gonna 'get it,' nor will they ever give you a pass. Just take heart in
the fact that those of us out here in the real world know what syllogism
is. Don't let 'em get you down! BTW, you looked great on Chris Matthews
last week. ;) Your biggest fan, Br ...

Uh, hmm ... Sorry. I'm getting my personal emails/newsgroup postings
confused this morning. I'm exhausted. Just forget what you just read.
Moving right along ...

Wed. 7/11 Big Show Synopsis

*DESK CHAT HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT*
I loved the visit from Abe Lincoln, complete with Dave changing the
script, which resulted in him cracking up when Abe started in with his
lines.

*DIDDY*
The new season of &quot;Making the Band 4&quot; premieres Monday on MTV.

*EMMA WATSON*
She's a cute kid. She's in the new 'Harry Potter' film. It's in theaters
now.

*SPOON*
The album is &quot;Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga.&quot;
------------

TR 7/12 Big Show Synopsis

*DESK CHAT HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT*
I enjoyed the game show with the very long legal disclaimer, as read by
Alan Kalter. (It was so long, there wasn't time for the game! Alan had
to read quite ... fast, and he still didn't get it all in!)

*PAUL TEUTUL &amp; PAUL TEUTUL, JR*
I go nothin'. I like these guys, but I got nothin'.

*VERA FARMIGA*
I enjoyed this interview. She was a good guest. Hmm, I wonder if Dave
Sikula enjoyed this interview. The film is &quot;Joshua.&quot;

*JOE MATARESE*
I'll have to go to the tape on this one.

*MISCELLANEOUS MEANDERING*
So a couple of nights ago I was in one of my local neighborhood
mega-lo-mart bookstores. I was spending some time in the cafe doing
crossword puzzles. At some point, a woman sat down at the table across
from me. Our tables were pretty close; we were essentially facing one
another. After a few minutes, I heard the woman laughing. Then I
realized that she was crying. And she *kept* crying, and her crying got
louder. Eventually the woman &amp; I glanced at each other. I asked her,
&quot;Sad book?&quot; She said it was a very sad book. She said she couldn't help
sobbing. She then proceeded to tell me what was so sad about it. Well, I
saw the book she was reading, and it's a book I've been considering
purchasing. Now I know a significant spoiler! I'm not even sure I still
want to read the book. Do you all want to know the book she was reading,
as well as what's so sad about it? It's a spoiler, for sure. And it's a
popular book. Maybe I'll add a 'spoiler warning' later and share the
details.

I've decided something. I think I'm going to start attending women's
professional roller derby events. Who knew women's professional roller
derby even still existed? There was an article in my local newspaper
yesterday about a local women's roller derby league that's supposedly
quite popular. I think it's a 'retro chic' kinda thing. Anyway, the
paper said they have regular 'meet-and-greets' before their matches, as
well as 'after-parties' at nightclubs. You can meet &amp; mingle with the
roller derby women! What do you think? Actually, I think I've already
changed my mind.

So is Paris Hilton going to church nowadays and 'giving back to the
community?' What about her buddy Nicole Richie? I heard that Nicole
Richie's recent court date had to be postponed because a witness is on
vacation or something. Naturally, TMZ.com has it covered. That guy from
TMZ.com is a *genius*. He was previously the 'legal consultant' for the
&quot;The People's Court,&quot; back when Judge Wapner was the judge. He (Harvey
Levin) may even be involved with the current incarnation of the show.

So Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff has a 'gut feeling.'
Thanks a lot. It comforts me to know that public officials are making
alarming public announcements based on 'gut feelings.' You're doin' a
heckuva job, Bush Administration.

Well, it's 5:30 AM. On the plus side, I have a large supply of Diet
Mountain Dew in the fridge.

I gotta make some changes.

That's all I got.

Later ...

Brady

All that stuff sounds kind of ... boring. Although, the lemon twist (and
citrus) might add just enough excitement (?) to make them palatable.

For you two, I may just give it a try.

Hey, we've turned this into a fun little 'Guess the Book Title' game!
OK, so maybe it's not 'fun.'

I could be wrong. I *think* you said you read it.

See, if I reveal the book title, I think it's virtually a given that
everyone will guess/assume the 'spoiler.' And I just don't want that on
my back. I don't want people saying to me, 'I was gonna read that book!
Now I don't even want to! Dumbass.'

Yeah, I think it works. Thanks.

Hey, Helen, did you happen to see Michael Shermer on last night's &quot;Larry
King Live?&quot; The subject was UFOs. Dr. Shermer spent the night
fruitlessly attempting to 'convince' a panel of UFO 'investigators' that
their fanciful conclusions weren't, in fact, scientifically logical.

Larry almost (?) lost control of the show when he brought out Buzz
Aldrin. (Larry just wanted to hear about the lights Buzz saw outside the
window of his Apollo capsule. Buzz proceeded to give a step-by-step
explanation of the Apollo rocket's stages, which he did with the help of
a small model Apollo rocket.)

I loved that segment with Buzz Aldrin.  They were all having fits to
get in and speak and Larry King was trying to get him to hurry up and
tell the story as they were running out of time.  But, all he cared
about was the rocket stages and not getting on with his story.  He
kept saying his little prop would tell the story, but it didn't.  I
totally didn't see the point of the prop.  The whole thing cracked me
up.

Then, when he told them that they didn't tell mission control about
the lights because they were afraid mission control would think they
were nuts, I thought they would all lose it.  But all Larry King said
was &quot;We have to take a break but we'll be back.&quot;

Maybe...it was something

Yeah, I liked how Larry attempted to move it along and get Buzz to go
ahead and tell about the lights. Buzz was totally un-phased; he just
kept right on explaining the rocket stages.

Hey, we could play a round of 'Where is Helen, and What is She Doing?'

I'm just goofy.

You'll enjoy 'Will it Float?'

Yes, it was &quot;Marley &amp; Me.&quot; I saw the woman again tonight at the

said she did. Well, as you might have guessed, Marley dies. And not only
that, according to the woman, 'it wasn't an easy death.'

Aha...knew it!  I normally never cry at movies or books, UNLESS a sick
or dying animal is involved.  Then it's just waterworks.  I remember
sitting at my PC bawling out loud when I logged on and read the
articles about euthanizing Barbaro.  BTW - I haven't read Marley &amp; Me
because I've surmised from reading various interviews with the author
that Marley dies and I just don't want to put myself thru that.  Now I
know I made the right decision.

Now, that was another train wreck show.  They had this woman reporter
hanging out -- I don't know -- I think in one of the lines to see the
movie(?)  Well, anyway, this woman was soliciting questions for the
Harry Potter guy and the girls were asking questions but couldn't hear
the answers.  And the Harry Potter guy kept answering the questions
and asking the girls new questions which they couldn't hear either.
The reporter person had to keep on repeating the original answers and
the new questions he would ask them.  Larry King was clearly getting
annoyed at all the repeating and would cut the reporter person off and
go back to the studio when she told the answer to the crowd there.

Finally, after about two segments of that, the next time they went to
the reporter person, the person asking the question had headphones
on!  I was like, who was the brain trust behind this?!

Maybe...who loves it when those live shows just fall apart.
