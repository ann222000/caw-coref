&gt; &gt; Looks like Hillary's got it in the bag.

&gt; &gt; Unless someone comes out of left field... like Carter and Clinton did.

&gt; And like Bush did, as well.  In fact, in &quot;open&quot; nomination races where
&gt; there's no incumbent President or Vice President seeking a particular
&gt; party's nomination, it's actually quite rare for the candidate who's leading
&gt; in the polls 5 months before the first primary to end up with the
&gt; nomination, much less the presidency.  This is WAY too soon to be making a
&gt; call.

&gt; If you want to try to figure out who'll end up with the nomination you need
&gt; to look at who's had upward momentum in the polls in the early states like
&gt; Iowa and New Hampshire over the last two or three months.  That's where
&gt; you'll see a dark horse start to rise.  That's also where you'll see, by
&gt; looking for downward trends, the frontrunners who've peaked too soon.  The
&gt; rest of the nation tends to be swayed a lot by results in the early states.
&gt; If Hillary is seen as the frontrunner now, but only comes in 2nd or 3rd in
&gt; Iowa and/or New Hampshire in January, the rest of the country will view her
&gt; as a &quot;loser&quot; and back off on their support.

&gt; Another factor to consider is which minor candidates will likely drop out,
&gt; and where will their support go once they do.
">

Thoughtful analysis, but it begs the question.  So far, nobody
impresses me, not Clinton, Obama, Edwards, nor Thompson, Gingrich,
Giuliani, and certainly not Richardson.  What bothers me most is the
fact that out of 300 million people, we are supposed to consider once
again a member from one of only two families, either the Clintons or
the Bushes.  It's a sad commentary on what a sham gaining elective
office in the good ole USA really is.  The rich and influential
determine everything and decide behind closed doors who is going to
win or lose.  The rest is just a show so the people actually believe
they are participating in who runs the government.  We revolted
against England for what did you say?  Oh, so wealthy landowners in
Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania could call all the shots.  If
these bogus elections, Big Business, and military contracts are all
this country is about anymore, we ought to disband like the member
states of the USSR did.  Few people shed a tear at the demise of the

The first problem a breakup into individual states would generate is
land-lock for half of them.

Aside from that, the world today is comprised of global corporations.  A
breakup into individual states wouldn't have any effect on the global
corporations.  What is really needed is a way to force family values into
the global corporations, in the same manner spit in the palm and a handshake
used to be sufficient to seal a deal, or verbal agreement being all you
needed, or honor.  Look at who's promotiing lack of morals, lack of right
versus wrong, and then wonder why global corporations have no honor, and are
unable to treat mankind with respect.

Think about it.  Now take a break.  Gather all the lawyers into a group,
drop them all into a bottomless pit.  Now think about it again.  Any ideas?

Americans need look no further than their own reflections in the TV
screen to see the cause of the immorality and lack of meaningful choices
they complain about.

Now why would that be?  It was Big News when Oprah said she's an Obama
girl.  That's what I'm talking about.  The media keep telling us Hillary
is #1 and Obama's #2 for Democrats, but Edwards is polling ahead of both
of them in Iowa, last I heard.

Compare Dennis Kucinich to Ron Paul or Rudy Giuliani to either of those
and THEN tell me if there are no real choices in the race.

The Clinton's are too corrupt.  Word is they've even brought Sandy Berger
back into their innermost circle.  It's still amazing how the Clinton's
directed Berger to destroy classified documents pertaining to the Clinton's
handling of the terrorist threat and not get prosecuted along with Berger.
With Millions in illegal campaign funds from her 2000 Senate campaign, her
major supporters in her Presidential campaign being found out to be
fugitives from the law, etc., there's no way Hillary Clinton can keep it all
under control.  She's gone too far out on a limb and it's bound to break.
Sooner or later (and I strongly suspect it will happen before she gets
elected President), someone's going to be brave enough to stand up and
charge the Clinton's with their crimes.

Even if the Clinton's can somehow manage to keep from being prosecuted for
all of their crimes, there's still the Iraq war.  Democrats have been unable
to force Bush to loose the war.  With the surge having worked as well as it
has, the people of Iraq will begin to stand behind their new government.  As
soon as they begin to support that government, the terrorists will be out,
Bush will have won the war; and it will be obvious to everyone in the States
that every Democrat is unfit for office, that they should be charged with
treason for trying to force the US to loose a war.  With success in Iraq,
Repubilcans will have a landslide victory in the 2008 elections, and the
Democrats know it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the people of Iraq will begin to stand behind their new government.

&gt; &gt; Very unlikely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As
&gt; &gt; &gt; soon as they begin to support that government, the terrorists will be
&gt; &gt; &gt; out,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bush will have won the war;

&gt; &gt; If that happens, the Iraqis and the Iranians will have won the war.

&gt; &gt; &gt; and it will be obvious to everyone in the States
&gt; &gt; &gt; that every Democrat is unfit for office, that they should be charged with
&gt; &gt; &gt; treason for trying to force the US to loose a war.  With success in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Repubilcans will have a landslide victory in the 2008 elections, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Democrats know it.

&gt; &gt; Man what a load of wishful thinking.

&gt; It amazes me how many people there are who don't even know how to
&gt; spell lose, and yet they attempt to tell us what's going on with the
&gt; world.  &quot;The surge is working?&quot;  It is?  And now Bush wants to draw
&gt; down the troops (to pre-surge levels, at best, just like when the
&gt; price of gas &quot;goes back down&quot;).

It's not that he wants to.  It's inevitable.  The armed forces don't have
the manpower to sustain a surge longer than next spring.
