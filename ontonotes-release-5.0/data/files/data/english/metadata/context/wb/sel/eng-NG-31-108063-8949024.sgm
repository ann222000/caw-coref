The hopeful tend to nothing they hope for.  But, it is a sign of some
semblance of caring.

You can't make someone care.  That's the first step.  The second step is
doing something realistic about it, not hoping for.

Lyrics to an old song:  I'd love to change the world.  But, I don't know
what to do.  So, I leave it up to you.
Translation: I care.  I don't know how to fix it.  So, you fix it while I
hope.
Red Hot Chili Peppers:  Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it
ever was.

&gt; Derrick Jenson left this article laying about on the Web and it was my
&gt; great fortune to find it.   One of those epiphanic moments.  Funny what
&gt; one finds when they are actually seeking.  Some others of you may find
&gt; it useful.

&gt; It's about loving and enjoying one another and our gardens and all that
&gt; we can, while we can.  And working our butts off for what we believe in
&gt; and love, simply for the sheer joy and rightness of doing so.

&gt; I'm beginning to feel what Derrick is saying, that even though we are
&gt; totally, irrevocably effed, life is very good, or at least beginning to
&gt; be.

&gt; BEYOND HOPE, By Derrick Jensen

&gt; HE MOST COMMON WORDS I hear spoken by any environmentalists anywhere
&gt; are, We're fucked. Most of these environmentalists are fighting
&gt; desperately, using whatever tools they have-or rather whatever legal
&gt; tools they have, which means whatever tools those in power grant them
&gt; the right to use, which means whatever tools will be ultimately
&gt; ineffective-to try to protect some piece of ground, to try to stop the
&gt; manufacture or release of poisons, to try to stop civilized humans from
&gt; tormenting some group of plants or animals. Sometimes they're reduced
&gt; to trying to protect just one tree.

&gt; Here's how John Osborn, an extraordinary activist and friend, sums up
&gt; his reasons for doing the work: &quot;As things become increasingly chaotic,
&gt; I want to make sure some doors remain open. If grizzly bears are still
&gt; alive in twenty, thirty, and forty years, they may still be alive in
&gt; fifty. If they're gone in twenty, they'll be gone forever.&quot;

&gt; But no matter what environmentalists do, our best efforts are
&gt; insufficient. We're losing badly, on every front. Those in power are
&gt; hell-bent on destroying the planet, and most people don't care.

&gt; Frankly, I don't have much hope. But I think that's a good thing. Hope
&gt; is what keeps us chained to the system, the conglomerate of people and
&gt; ideas and ideals that is causing the destruction of the Earth.

&gt; To start, there is the false hope that suddenly somehow the system may
&gt; inexplicably change. Or technology will save us. Or the Great Mother.
&gt; Or beings from Alpha Centauri. Or Jesus Christ. Or Santa Claus. All of
&gt; these false hopes lead to inaction, or at least to ineffectiveness. One
&gt; reason my mother stayed with my abusive father was that there were no
&gt; battered women's shelters in the '50s and '60s, but another was her
&gt; false hope that he would change. False hopes bind us to unlivable
&gt; situations, and blind us to real possibilities.

&gt; Does anyone really believe that Weyerhaeuser is going to stop
&gt; deforesting because we ask nicely? Does anyone really believe that
&gt; Monsanto will stop Monsantoing because we ask nicely? If only we get a
&gt; Democrat in the White House, things will be okay. If only we pass this
&gt; or that piece of legislation, things will be okay. If only we defeat
&gt; this or that piece of legislation, things will be okay. Nonsense.
&gt; Things will not be okay. They are already not okay, and they're getting
&gt; worse. Rapidly.

&gt; But it isn't only false hopes that keep those who go along enchained.
&gt; It is hope itself. Hope, we are told, is our beacon in the dark. It is
&gt; our light at the end of a long, dark tunnel. It is the beam of light
&gt; that makes its way into our prison cells. It is our reason for
&gt; persevering, our protection against despair (which must be avoided at
&gt; all costs). How can we continue if we do not have hope?

&gt; We've all been taught that hope in some future condition-like hope in
&gt; some future heaven-is and must be our refuge in current sorrow. I'm
&gt; sure you remember the story of Pandora. She was given a tightly sealed
&gt; box and was told never to open it. But, being curious, she did, and out
&gt; flew plagues, sorrow, and mischief, probably not in that order. Too
&gt; late she clamped down the lid. Only one thing remained in the box:
&gt; hope. Hope, the story goes, was the only good the casket held among
&gt; many evils, and it remains to this day mankind's sole comfort in
&gt; misfortune. No mention here of action being a comfort in misfortune, or
&gt; of actually doing something to alleviate or eliminate one's misfortune.

&gt; The more I understand hope, the more I realize that all along it
&gt; deserved to be in the box with the plagues, sorrow, and mischief; that
&gt; it serves the needs of those in power as surely as belief in a distant
&gt; heaven; that hope is really nothing more than a secular way of keeping
&gt; us in line.

&gt; Hope is, in fact, a curse, a bane. I say this not only because of the
&gt; lovely Buddhist saying &quot;Hope and fear chase each other's tails,&quot; not
&gt; only because hope leads us away from the present, away from who and
&gt; where we are right now and toward some imaginary future state. I say
&gt; this because of what hope is.

&gt; More or less all of us yammer on more or less endlessly about hope. You
&gt; wouldn't believe-or maybe you would-how many magazine editors have
&gt; asked me to write about the apocalypse, then enjoined me to leave
&gt; readers with a sense of hope. But what, precisely, is hope? At a talk I
&gt; gave last spring, someone asked me to define it. I turned the question
&gt; back on the audience, and here's the definition we all came up with:
&gt; hope is a longing for a future condition over which you have no agency;
&gt; it means you are essentially powerless.

&gt; I'm not, for example, going to say I hope I eat something tomorrow. I
&gt; just will. I don't hope I take another breath right now, nor that I
&gt; finish writing this sentence. I just do them. On the other hand, I do
&gt; hope that the next time I get on a plane, it doesn't crash. To hope for
&gt; some result means you have given up any agency concerning it. Many
&gt; people say they hope the dominant culture stops destroying the world.
&gt; By saying that, they've assumed that the destruction will continue, at
&gt; least in the short term, and they've stepped away from their own
&gt; ability to participate in stopping it.

&gt; I do not hope coho salmon survive. I will do whatever it takes to make
&gt; sure the dominant culture doesn't drive them extinct. If coho want to
&gt; leave us because they don't like how they're being treated-and who
&gt; could blame them?-I will say goodbye, and I will miss them, but if they
&gt; do not want to leave, I will not allow civilization to kill them off.

&gt; When we realize the degree of agency we actually do have, we no longer
&gt; have to &quot;hope&quot; at all. We simply do the work. We make sure salmon
&gt; survive. We make sure prairie dogs survive. We make sure grizzlies
&gt; survive. We do whatever it takes.

&gt; When we stop hoping for external assistance, when we stop hoping that
&gt; the awful situation we're in will somehow resolve itself, when we stop
&gt; hoping the situation will somehow not get worse, then we are finally
&gt; free-truly free-to honestly start working to resolve it. I would say
&gt; that when hope dies, action begins.

&gt; PEOPLE SOMETIMES ASK ME, &quot;If things are so bad, why don't you just kill
&gt; yourself?&quot; The answer is that life is really, really good. I am a
&gt; complex enough being that I can hold in my heart the understanding that
&gt; we are really, really fucked, and at the same time that life is really,
&gt; really good. I am full of rage, sorrow, joy, love, hate, despair,
&gt; happiness, satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and a thousand other
&gt; feelings. We are really fucked. Life is still really good.

&gt; Many people are afraid to feel despair. They fear that if they allow
&gt; themselves to perceive how desperate our situation really is, they must
&gt; then be perpetually miserable. They forget that it is possible to feel
&gt; many things at once. They also forget that despair is an entirely
&gt; appropriate response to a desperate situation. Many people probably
&gt; also fear that if they allow themselves to perceive how desperate
&gt; things are, they may be forced to do something about it.

&gt; Another question people sometimes ask me is, &quot;If things are so bad, why
&gt; don't you just party?&quot; Well, the first answer is that I don't really
&gt; like to party. The second is that I'm already having a great deal of
&gt; fun. I love my life. I love life. This is true for most activists I
&gt; know. We are doing what we love, fighting for what (and whom) we love.

&gt; I have no patience for those who use our desperate situation as an
&gt; excuse for inaction. I've learned that if you deprive most of these
&gt; people of that particular excuse they just find another, then another,
&gt; then another. The use of this excuse to justify inaction-the use of any
&gt; excuse to justify inaction-reveals nothing more nor less than an
&gt; incapacity to love.

&gt; At one of my recent talks someone stood up during the Q and A and
&gt; announced that the only reason people ever become activists is to feel
&gt; better about themselves. Effectiveness really doesn't matter, he said,
&gt; and it's egotistical to think it does.

&gt; I told him I disagreed.

&gt; Doesn't activism make you feel good? he asked.

&gt; Of course, I said, but that's not why I do it. If I only want to feel
&gt; good, I can just masturbate. But I want to accomplish something in the
&gt; real world.

&gt; Why?

&gt; Because I'm in love. With salmon, with trees outside my window, with
&gt; baby lampreys
