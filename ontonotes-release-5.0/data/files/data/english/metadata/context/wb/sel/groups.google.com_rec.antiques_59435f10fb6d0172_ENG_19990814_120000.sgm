Hi,

I have an antique fireplace screen that's made of some sort
of light wood. The finish is glossy but natural looking,
(not polyurethane like) The dark finish has worn away in
places, and the wood beneath has a reddish/brown tint.

The screen is Oriental. The frame, carved from a single
block of wood, is formed by three intertwining dragons. The
intricate and delicate dragon woodwork is supported by
groups of sea waves carved in the oriental fashion.

The method of woodwork is a mixture of bas-relief and
full-round sculpture. It's similar to Oriental balsa and
ivory carvings I've seen before.

Unfortunately, the intricacy of the carving makes it a
challenge to clean. Dust and grime have collected in the
deeply carved portions of the piece. A rag can't get down
into the deeper portions of the carving. A brush will get
down there but, after the brush has done it's job, it's
difficult to remove the residue (again, because of the depth
of the carving)

My questions:

What sort of wood do you think the screen is made of?

What cleaner would you use to clean the item with? [I have
Formby's &quot;Build Up Remover&quot; and Pledge's &quot;Wood Cleaner&quot;
(Commercial Line)]

What sort of brushes should I use to get down into the
cracks?

Would you suggest I apply anything to the piece once it's
cleaned? Some sort of preservative oil perhaps?

Thanks for you help,

Frank

Hello--
I can't answer ALL your questions, but
I have found make-up brushes very useful
for getting into deep carvings. Have also
used kids toothbrushes, but the make-up
brushes seem to work better. I usually
WET the brush, which helps to get the
&quot;dirty crud&quot; (technical name?) out. Just
keep the brush clean by swishing it in
water &amp; then getting it semi-dry. The
best aspect is that plain old water will
not usually do damage, no matter WHAT
material is being cleaned.

If you can loosen the dust and grime in the carvings but can't get it
out with the brush then I would suggest you buy a can of Blaster
(pressurized air duster) from a local computer/office supply store.

Another good cleaning tool is a dentist's scraper. I have one shaped
like a hoe and I ground the edge slightly to make it dull and then
carefully use that to reach into carvings if there is goo (another
technical term) stuck in there.

You have to work in SMALL sections.

Cotton swabs work on some things.
