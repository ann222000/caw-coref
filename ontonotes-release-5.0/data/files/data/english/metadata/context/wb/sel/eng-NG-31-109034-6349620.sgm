Can you give us the number of lines, as you did last year?

Anyway, the decline has continued since last year, and at about the
same rate.  shw-i is slowly fading away.  This is part of the general
decline of Usenet (does anyone know of a Usenet newsgroup that /isn't/
declining?) but it's still rather sad.

I would fight this, if I could, and try to keep the fire burning a
little longer.

Any ideas?

I guess I have a part in the death of SHWI, as life has caught up with
me and I've just been insanely busy lately, so I haven't had that much
time to post but a couple of thoughts on how to save SHWI;

Perhaps a SHWI collective blog?  A lot of people just don't know what
usenet is anymore, but perhaps a collective blog where we posted the
best of SHWI (with the author's permision of course) as well as new
material, could draw more people in and make someone who is interested
in AH aware that SHWI exists.

Membership drive?  Everyone try to get one new person who they know,
either on line or in real life, to give SHWI a shot.

I've suggested this before and some said it sounded good but no one
took me up on it; a buddy-system, ie I'll post a new Ishiwara Option
by the end of the month if you post a new FDR Dies, or whatever.

I suppose this is part of our problem.  How do we identify the people
posting dreck because they're newbies / naive, and that they can be

Proper moderation or some other moderated forum? Sadly I'm not sure
the vital community that was around several years back is still around
(and who am I to demand moderation if I won't moderate), but from my
experience properly moderated forums (and not only usenetusenet ones)
can produce not only high level discussion, but community too.

And it is sad to see the group engulfed. Lots of fine stuff was
produced-and not only allohistorical fiction.

Has it really gotten that hopeless?  I've only become more active of
late.  I'm just not very qualified to write or critique allohistory
save in my fairly narrow field of space history, particularly early
unmanned shots.  There just aren't a lot of space WIs and mine usually
go relatively uncommented.

Might be a good idea to read the title of the ng occasionally.
History, What-If. Not History, could never happen, or History not
acceptable, or History, I don't like it so it must be wrong. Better to
pursue half-baked ideas with no possibility in the minds of the many
than to require adherence to some standard not possible to meet.

I have a copy of "If it had happened otherwise", edited by J.C.
Squire. Some of the propositions put forward in it are ridiculous but
make you think. One with a contemporary application is the failure of
Spain to take Grenada. Some of the stories are written by quite
accomplished historians, A.J.P. Taylor and G.M. Trevelyan for two,
others by people famous in their own right who dabbled in history.

That standard is usually called "plausibility." Which is why Harry
Turtledove and SM Stirling find their work so roundly trashed here.
Potboilers with some funny historical search and replace--Turtledove--
and swashbuckling imperial racism--Stirling--do not an interesting
thing make.

That's also why people have stopped doing "What if You Wake up as x?"
because, well, boring.

The point is not to discourage ideas; it's to raise the overall
quality of the group. If you've noticed, V's recent post "What if
Cromwell were more like Robespierre?" has gotten several constructive
criticisms, while being silly on its face.

A group with a higher level of overall play--like Doug Muir's taking
control of "Long Live Lancaster" and turning it into a timeline--means
more enjoyment for all, and fewer things involving Sealions, the
Confederacy, or Hindutva worlds.

That was, shall we say, an underwhelming essay?

Man, British historians of the 1920's didn't know much about historic
Islam.

Do you really think Ferdy or Izzy would have let Grenada camp out in
Southern Spain?

To Qouth the Wiki: "The King and Queen convinced the Pope to declare
their war a crusade. The Christians crushed one center of resistance
after another and finally, in January 1492, after a long siege, the
Moorish king of Gharnatah (Granada), Muhammad abu Abdallah,
surrendered the fortress palace, the renowned Alhambra, itself."

Well, yeah. We've developed a rather more--pardon the word--realistic
standard for alternate history. It's not merely a tool for bad
literary settings, or, as in the case of the Squire text, a
particularly emotive yearning

The Squire book is very much a product of its time and place. Almost
all of the essays, IIRC, describe ways in which Europe could have
avoided WWI. The ones that fall out of that category are the Lincoln
one, the Bacon one, the Byron one, and maybe the one about a Jacobite
victory. Which isn't to indict any of these in particular. They're not
bad as a means of intellectual laziness, but as a means of their
underlying goal or intention; they all seem to aim for the elimination
of the "Great War" from history.

Really, Jack, I can't see why you'd want this group to go backsliding
into Confederate victories after Antietam or Nazi win worlds.

Because Faeelin's Answers for Melinda, Anthony Mayer's Affair of the
Necklace, and lots of other things are far more interesting.

I might cite three recent highly unrealistic WIs on pre-Revolutionary
America but I won't.

Try this one on for size, the Second amendemtn is the only one in the
Bill of Rights with a preamble, WI that preamble adopted the similar
part of the existent Virginia Constitution?

Virginia:  . . .  Seventeenth, That the people have a right to keep
and bear arms; that a well regulated Militia composed of the body of
the people trained to arms is the proper, natural and safe defence of
a free State.  That standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to
liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided, as far as the
circumstances and protection of the Community will admit; and that in
all cases the military should be under strict subordination to and
governed by the Civil power.

In the year 2017, Ray Speer weeps over his  breakfast. Speer once
featured eggs in his morning meal, but egg consumption dwindled
(starting in the 1970s) and were no longer available to people in North
America, Just like dairy products (diminishing since 1960s), eggs had
been dropped by grocery stores because so few people tried to purchase
them.

Ray also remembers newspapers (in decline since the Eighties).  He had a
friend mail him copies of the present _New York Times_, but it had only
been  a twenty page newsheet of  want ads, date resumes, crossword
puzzles and sudoku.  More and more, Ray agrees with the decision of the
_Omaha World Herald_ to cease publication in 2010, If the circulation is
no longer enough to practice real journalism, it is time for the paper
to throw in the towel.

Ray goes to the basement. In long white boxes, Ray has complete runs of
comics, which ceased publication circa 1988  (following the predictions
of just about all comics fans), Ray finds it hard to believe that comics
are obsolete, just like wargaming, American automobiles, quality TV
drama, Westerns, the ACLU, the NAACP,  optimistic science fiction and
the Fred McMurray Fan Club.

There is a TV set, dusty in the corner, next to Ray's collection  of
Mark Grunewald's work  in _Captain America_.  Does that still work?
thinks Ray, as he turns on WebTV. There is still a hot button
connecting him directly to Social History What If?

There are  three posts on SHWI

WANNA SCREW MY SISTER?

GIGANTIC STUPENDOUS SCHLONG!

The third entry is  20,000 lines of poisonous invective, insulting as
insane, perverted, stupid, boring, ridiculous and constipated anyone who
wants to post alternative history scenarios on topics more recent than
the Thirty Years War.

The Censors of SHWI fed upon each other once the group was abandoned by
alt-historians.  Deprived of their natural prey, each of them accused
peers of insanity, crimes, and low quality posts. The Censors had
triumphed though --- there were no posts they could object to because
there were no posts at all . . . . .

==========COMMENTARY===========

C'mon folks. A decline of  volume in X does not lead to the extinction
of X, as my  dreary little scenario postulates.

For thirty years, I have been told regularly that my fellow comic geeks
and I are doomed Dodos, fans of an art form that peaked in the  freaking
Nineteen Forties. Nature will no longer replenish our numbers so we must
compel our neighbors, pals and relatives to acquire our habit. If we are
that badly off, it is amazing that I can still find comics shops filled
with freshly printed comics and free spending patrons.

Likewise with SHWI.  It will be around.

================

Obvious What IF --- The tabloids report that  Jennifer Aniston is
attacking Pitt and Jolie over SHWI posts concerning a Confederate
victory after Antietam. Comparable to the "Paul is Dead" rumor, millions
of fans read and believe that the posters of  SHWI are all sockpuppets
for Hollywood's rich and famous,

SHWI receives a volume of e-mail not  matched since the Nazi mass
mailings.

Isn't the real problem usenet, not the genre? That at least, is my
sense. There are plenty of people interested in alternate history
scattered about, but to create a sustained writing community with a
critical and engaged readership is more difficult, especially when
usenet is structured to maximize the flow of trash. Not it's fault
really, it was designed for a different time.

I would also point out that the various spellings of Arabic words have
not  been able to be reconcilled with local usage. The T.E. Shaw
commission on the transliteration of names with Arabic origin decided
the local usage, even with inconsistencies, was preferable to any
attempt to rationalize spelling from Arabic to Latin letters. A
situation which I learned to my dismay in 1957 was not considered
sufficient to not require a complete retyping of a paper at the
University of California.

&gt; The point is not to discourage ideas; it's to raise the overall
&gt; quality of the group. If you've noticed, V's recent post &quot;What if
&gt; Cromwell were more like Robespierre?&quot; has gotten several constructive
&gt; criticisms, while being silly on its face.

&gt;There are no silly ideas, only ideas whose execution leaves a lot to be desired. Only a narrow minded litaralist with delusions of grandeur would express such an opinion. Only ideologically elitist literary criticics would find certain ideas laughable and ridiculous. I personally happen to be an anti-royalist, but that does not mean that my beliefs should be mocked rather than debated. If I were going to insult someone I would put it in words they would understand. The question is whether certain people should leave their academic elitism behind and stop making fun of the people who might not know all the facts because they lack an academic grounding in history. The point is that there should be a more robust succession of questions and answers as well as a willingness to help the newbies get their historical facts right so that the historical deviation becomes plausible. There should not only be a reliance on what is plausible, since that narrows the field and hampers debate, regardless of whether people can accuse others of ideological bias. I personally hate it when professors make fun of students rather than helping them develop certain forms of historical fiction in a self-critical manner, because alternate history IS historical fiction, not fact. I do not think anyone who believes in the viability of history as an academic field of inquiry should doubt the usefulness of historical thought experiments to back up assertions about whether or not certain events in history are necessary or not. The philosophical underpinings of such discourse should be geared to prove why certain events needed to occur in order to improve life for the inhabitants of the modern world. For example the Holocaust was necessary for the implementation of a framework that made Fascism an obsolete and laughable idea, preserving peace for the modern age and preventing a xenophobic racist bigot from gaining access to dangerous nuclear weapons for all time. Oops, I am sorry. I was being sarcastic, because we know now that this is not true. If it is not one xenophobic racist bigot, it will be another. It never ends, because there is a problem inherent in human nature that causes them to act in certain ways which would be considered counterproductive in terms of logic, but keep occuring because of the prevalence of the ideology of exclusion in political discourse. We should be open to all ideas, not because they are plausible, but because it gives us the chance to be philosophical about certain strains of ideological thought processes that have tainted the discourse of historical study and literary criticism. I make no pretences of being a scholar, I just enjoy asking questions that I feel might help certain debates about why this is the best of all possible worlds, rather than other ones. I might be inclined to say that the whole concept of alternate history is idiotic, but I will not voice such an opinion out loud, since I do not want to offend people whose life is defined by such things. The whole concept of alternate history is unrealistic, since there is no way for time travel to be practically implemented, However, that does not mean we should regard negative opinions about the historical realism inherent in the discourse as being good for the discourse. To disregard someone's opinion, just because it might be regarded as implausible, would be insultingly elitist. The mere fact one would voice such an opinion sheds a cloud of doubt on their motives. This is more a question about philosophy and methodology than anything else. Since I believe in the idea that others have a right to voice their opinions on all subjects, I would like to hear everyone else's.

Thanks for bringing us down to earth.

Seriously though you make some good points. What-if related newsgroups
predate the Internet - I well remember the old Fidonet "Echoes" in the
mid 1980s. Or telling my 4 year old daughter that these messages she
was seeing came from people in 11 different countries. (She was just
taking her first steps in reading at the time and new they were
writing though the words were too big for her - she's now a college
sophomore who this week got accepted for summer language training in
St. Petersburg - and I don't mean Florida even though that's where she
is this week for spring break)

I remember getting into wargaming way back when as I had read
Foundation and the Man in the High Castle and Avalon Hill was
advertising "Now YOU too can change history!" Arkady Darrell (from
Second Foundation) had my teen-age hormones pumping long before the
days of jpgs and gifs. Still got my first edition of Dungeons and

I'm just glad the Sporger has taken 'his' efforts to the warez

Comics as an art form are doing fine and will be around forever.
Monthly Marvel and DC superhero comics  -- "floppies" -- are in a
world of hurt, and have been for many years.  Both companies are
looking at declining circulation and an aging fan base.  The top-
selling superhero titles are selling around *one tenth* as many titles
as the top sellers from when you and I were kids, Ray.

They're bleeding money.  The only reason they're being kept alive is
to serve as training camps and feedstock for other media.  It doesn't
matter if Spider-Man comics lose $50,000 a month when Spider-Man the
movie grosses $150 million.

But even that will eventually run dry.  The latest superhero cartoon,
for instance, is inspired by the Wolfman-Perez Teen Titans from twenty
years ago.  Eventually the suits will realize there's no real need for
the floppies, because everyone already knows who Spider-Man is.  I
think it will take a long time -- more than a decade, maybe more than
two -- but it's coming.

Now they do but a decade after the comic is gone? Maybe not.
Thank goodness there's never been a hobby that decided recruiting new
people was a waste of time.

POD: From the link:

"The late 1970s: sales go down even further

"The late-1970's nearly saw the demise of comics publishing. The
precipitous drops in newsstand sales that I mentioned earlier in this
series more than offset the ability of Seagate Distributing to grow
comics sales by shipping comics directly to comics shops. While the
Direct Market comics shops did manage to transfer a great number of fans
to themselves that otherwise had been purchasing through newsstand outlets,
the harsh reality was that newsstand sales were dropping far faster than
the Direct Market was growing. ...  DC Comics, without warning, suddenly
slashed over 30% of their entire line in a single day (the infamous DC
Implosion...). ... [and regarding Marvel there was a] marked
predisposition on the part of Mr. Feinberg to simply shut the whole
thing down."

What if Feinberg *does* shut Marvel down? As we saw from the
Hero World debacle, a bad (or reasonable but unfortunate) decision at
one major publisher can have industry-wide consequences. Say that in
197*, the two giants of North American comics collapse totally?

Hmm... the year is going to matter, as by '77-78 you have "mainstream"
B&amp;W comics such as Cerebus and Elfquest coming out as well as others.
The art form will survive, naturally, it's just the outlet that will be
in question. Creators will probably try self publishing much earlier,
giving creators rights a much earlier foothold, but that'll take time
and there'll be few books to hold retailers over in the meantime.

What if Marvel IS shut down, but the Epic line is spun off as an
independent company? Or did Epic start out independent? Comics go from
color to mostly B&amp;W to cut costs... With the US market down to just
lots of small publishers, it might not be unreasonable for someone to
decide to bring over Japanese manga much earlier. The success of the
animated Star Blazers (based on the anime Space Battleship Yamamto)
might get Matsumoto's comics marketed as a tie-in. An early collapse
might get samurai comics brought over to capitalize on the badly dubbed
Japanese and HK films ('Shogun Assassin' is based on the manga 'Lone
Wolf and Cub')

It isn't just the newsgroups - one of my favorite blogs is having a
tough time as well. This is a political blog
(northvancouverpolitics.com) which is suffering from the effects of a
candidate from the 2005 election who has clearly seen the 'brain
eater'. She finished about 1000 votes short of a seat on Council after
being very much the public protege of a retiring 25-year Councillor.
(This particular individual is as feisty as hell and had been a gadfly
for years - much admired but hugely controversial...)

She could give "over the top" lessons to any of the wilder posters
here and has undoubtedly provided her foes more than ample ammunition
should she run again in 2008. It would be easy to imagine questioners
at an all-candidates' meeting doing little more than reading her past
postings as saying "given how you treated John Doe on this occasion
why should I vote for you?"

Unfortunately a lot of local people who SHOULD be there are avoiding
the blog due to her (and two of her allies') influence as "only
crazies go there!" (I've been told this by 2 or 3 people whose opinion
I otherwise respect.

Moral: it isn't just SHWI or newsgroups generally ... which is a shame
since web-surfing alone get boring after a while and one of my
favorite moments of SHWI and alt.sysadmin.recovery are the interesting
URLs that people post here.

It's entirely possible that you would see a growth in movies
reflecting TV shows and computer games. Ex: "Tomb Raider X: Lara goes
to the center of the earth" or Star Trek / Star Wars XV "Because We
Can". Hopefully we would be spared "The Adventures of Mario: First
Blood (The Movie)". I don't want to even think about what Harrison
Ford might have done around that time!

The late 70s was of course the dawn of the home computers and you had
early entries like Leisure Suit Larry and the early Wizardry / Ultima
games which could have been made into mass market items. ObWI: "WI
Playboy picks up the Leisure Suit Larry series around 1982?" Anyone
here remember the at the time scandalous box cover of "Softporn
Adventure" which featured our hero in a hot tub with 3 women all
apparently bare? (LSL1 was essentially a graphic rendtion of the
original game which was all text in the Infocom manner).

What you get is a growth in the indie comic line with far less
emphasis on the Super-hero. I don't think my teen years would have
been poorer without Superboy and the Legion of Super Heroes
especially.

Heck, who do you see writing it? If mainstream comics go bye bye
in 1978, Miller might still work on The Twilight Zone for Gold Key Comics
but he won't be able to jump over to Marvel's John Carter comic, because
it will be gone. Why would he stay in comics at all? How could he stay
in comics? If he stuck with Gold Key, they stopped newstand distribution
in 1981 and were dead by 1984. I can't see GK doing better in this TL.

There's always Archie, I guess. I don't really want to see
2007's Frank Miller's brand of posturing thugs and semi-naked whores
applied to the Archie and I doubt the people who own Archie would either.
If Miller is with Archie Comics, I expect his work evolves differently.

FRANK MILLER'S DUCKBURG would be funny but very, very wrong.

Here's a thought: if DC and Marvel die in the mid-70s from a surfeit
of Twinkie advertising, what if E.C. comes back from the crypt?

After all, the Wertham hearings were twenty years ago (and the good
doctor is even trying to retcon his views now.) Boomer parents tend
to let their kids do whatever the hell they want (such as buying a
copy of Mad Magazine every week). And the distributors and the shops
will have to be a lot less choosy about content if DC and Marvel are
both gone.

So: E.C. can probably flip the Comics Code Authority a skeletonized
middle finger and get away with it (at least until Reagan's second
term anyway); and if they're hiring, Miller oughta fit right in...

Jim Warren was still around in the late '70s ; Warren Publications
didn't
go bankrupt until 1983. Presumably Frank Miller could be able to do
work
for CREEPY or EERIE.

Which brings up an ObWI: Warren Survives!

"It's unclear what it was, as Warren shies away from the
specifics, but in the early '80s, Warren got sick. "Doctors
were never able to tell me what I had," says Warren, "but
it was some kind of immune deficiency." The energy and
passion that kept Warren up late during marathon Famous
Monsters editing sessions vanished. He stayed away from
the office, which left his employees confused and rudderless.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the beginning of his career, when FM was being edited
">

in his old bedroom in his parents' house and his company
was named "Central Publishing Inc." after his high school,
Warren had been a one-man corporation, driving all creative
and business decisions. There was no Warren Publishing
without Jim Warren.

The sickness seemed to spark a chain reaction: Warren
Communications Corp. went bankrupt in 1983, leaving
artwork and ownership rights in question. A company
called Harris Publishing scooped up some debt and
claimed rights to some of the Warren back catalog.
Warren says that his financial advisers led him astray
and even stole from him; millions of dollars disappeared...."

http://www.citypaper.net/articles/2005-01-06/cover.shtml
(pretty interesting interview with Warren ; I didn't know before
that Diane Arbus had done work for "Famous Monsters")

So, Warren stays healthy and on top of his company's
finances. With Marvel and DC gone, and Charlton and
Gold Key soon to follow, Warren is in a prime position to
dominate the comics world. Drug stores and newsstands
wouldn't start dropping the sale of comics until the early
80s in OTL ; Warren would be in a good position to keep
the direct stores going, at least for awhile. (In OTL, the
decline of Creepy, Eerie and Vampirella in the early 80s as
a result of Warren's troubles made them unpopular in
comics stores ; presumably the quality of the art and
writing will be better in TTL.

In my mis-spent youth I was mostly reading DC - I was big on Batman
and the Legion of Superheroes though did not especially like Superman.

I started losing interest in Batman when a typical issue would be (a)
super-villain makes a big heist, (b) super-villain attempts a second
heist, fails but escapes without the loot and (c) Batman catches
him/her on the third attempted heist.

One of my favorite stories involved the super-villain who got caught
because he did his crimes disguised as Batman (which of course caused
endless grief with Commissioner Gordon since Batman was the last
person the Commissioner would expect to be robbing banks) but got
caught because he had been in prison for 7 years and did not know
Batman had changed his uniform by adding the searchlight yellow oval
behind the bat to his logo...I also recall often enjoying the second
story in the Detective comic better than the lead Batman story.

For the LSH I almost cried when they killed off Ferro Lad.

(For the non-cognoscenti that was roughly 1969-72)

I also had a HUGE collection of Charles Schulz's Peanuts annuals and
still do have my complete set of Len Norris cartooon annuals.

Norris of course was the leading political cartoonist for the
Vancouver Sun starting from the early 1950s to the mid-1980s. He was
definitely one of the 2 or 3 top Canadian political cartoonists of the
era and features prominently in the Editorial Cartoons Collection of
Simon Fraser University which can be found at
http://edocs.lib.sfu.ca/projects/Cartoons/

This site I recommend to anyone who loves political cartoons even if
they don't know a thing about Canadian politics.
