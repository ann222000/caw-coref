Sadly, if not unsurprisingly, this episode doesn't hold the answer to
life, the universe and everything. The title appears to relate to the
number of minutes the Doctor has to save the ship he finds himself on
- as tenuous a connection as a title's ever had to an episode. Since
42 minutes is, more or less, the amount of real time that passes while
watching the story, the name is presumably an allusion to the series
gimmick of &quot;24&quot; rather than to Douglas Adams.

I remember reading a book by Robert Silverberg in which stars turned
out to be intelligent aliens that could telepathically possess people.
It was dreadful. Still, he'll have a case to sue the production ream
for copyright infringement. Once the teams behind the Alien films,
Star Wars, Star Trek and the X-Men have finished.

I've come to the conclusion that it no longer makes much sense to
compare the &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; series of Doctor Who. Increasingly, they'e
one and the same. We've had old characters, most of the old villains
returning and doing what they always do, and more and more use of old
plotlines and story concepts. This one is the environmental parable -
the old stalwart in which humans play the villains through ignorant
exploitation of the planet (or in this case star) of the week. We saw
it in stories like &quot;Kinder&quot; and the one where the Adric was
introduced.

Unusually, in this story the bit-parts actually get to be the heroes,
dealing with the monsters without the Doctor while he fixes the ship.
This takes a while, because in an incredibly contrived plot device
this lowly cargo ship has security that would be the envy of Fort
Knox. With passwords set by a drunk crew no less. Martha's mum is
right - it's cheating to ring her. You only get to phone a friend
once.

I'm not commenting overmuch on the quality of the episode because
thre's not really that much to say. It didn't leave much of an
impression on me.  I could barely be bothered toi wonder why the star
has no apparent gravitational attraction, why its magnetic field is so
weak that the ship's magnet could reattach the jettisoned escape pod,
or whether the monsters wore helmets for any particular reason when
they wanted to fry anyone anyway, and could just close their eyes if
they didn't. Still, you have to admit it's a feat to simultaneously
rip off Darth Vader, Star Trek's Breen and Cyclops from the X-Men with
a single prop. The episode does deserve credit for showing a Doctor
who was genuinely afraid he would die permanently,  but on the
flipside the writers seem to have little imagination when it comes to
writing family dialogue. Martha's conversations with her mother are
remarkably reminiscent of Rose's, with the writers yet to realise that
frantic worry is not enough to give a character a personality.

A nice bit of trivia. 42 was not Doctor who's first real time story-
it was Horror of Fang Rock.
