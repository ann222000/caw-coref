Thailand's 'third sex' demand constitutional rights

BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) -- Gay, lesbian, transgender and
transvestite groups in Thailand are campaigning for a clause in its
post-coup constitution giving official status to the "third sex" to
try to end discrimination.

Along with a guarantee of equal rights for men and women, the charter
should also include a reference to "those of other sexual
orientation," Natee Teerarojjanapongs of the Thai Political Gay Group
said on Tuesday.

"Rome wasn't built in a day, and we hope the guarantee of rights for
the third sex in the constitution will pave the way for amendments in
other laws to give gays equal rights," the 50-year-old AIDS activist
told Reuters.

On the surface, Thailand appears very tolerant of homosexuality, with
many openly gay celebrities.

Transvestites, or "katoeys" as they are called in Thai, are
commonplace in offices, schools and on television, and Bangkok is a
world center of sex-change surgery.

However, Natee said the predominantly Buddhist country remained
deeply conservative at heart and still had many rules and regulations
discriminating against non-heterosexuals.

Natee said he and his male partner were refused life insurance by a
number of companies who viewed homosexuals as carrying a far higher
risk than heterosexuals.

"This is clear prejudice," he said.

Transvestites are barred from compulsory military service, but army
chiefs made a small concession two years ago, branding
them "physically unfit" rather than "permanently insane."

However, many cross-dressers turned away before 2005 still carry
the "permanently insane" stamp on their military draft cards --
documents needed for job applications.
