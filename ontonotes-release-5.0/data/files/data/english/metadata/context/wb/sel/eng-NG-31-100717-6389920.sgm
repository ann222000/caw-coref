[Editor's note: Obtained from our anonymous source in the White House
custodial department, this memo from what appears to be a secret group in
the Pentagon formed at the Vice President's behest proposes a stunning shift
in the way the White House talks about the war in Iraq. While we were unable
to contact any of the members of the group, we were told by several sources
that it had been abruptly dismantled and its members have not been seen or
heard from since.]

TO: Vice President Richard Cheney
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice

CC: Donald Rumsfeld

FROM: Senior members, Pentagon Special Public Relations Review Committee

SUBJECT: Initial recommendations

Sirs:

Last year we were commissioned by the Vice President's office to research
and analyze alternative strategies to better manage domestic public
relations with regard to the war in Iraq specifically, and more generally
the global war on terrorism. While our report is not yet complete, we write
to present our preliminary findings and our primary policy recommendation,
which will surely be met with some controversy.

As you know, we are waging a military campaign in Iraq to secure major
fossil fuel deposits in anticipation of increased global demand for
dwindling energy reserves. In anticipation of this, it was deemed necessary
to create a more marketable pretext for invasion (WMD, liberating Iraqis
from dictatorial oppression) to secure the approval of the media, thereby
the voting public, and thereby congress. This public relations effort was
quite successful in facilitating said invasion and enjoyed continued success
for some time afterward. But, as is painfully obvious, public perceptions
have shifted, and a large majority now opposes continued engagement and
regrets the invasion.

In hindsight, this shift was in some ways unavoidable: in publicly setting
fanciful goals for the invasion, such as finding large caches of dangerous
weapons, establishing freedom and security for the Iraqi people and the
rebuilding of national infrastructure, the fulfillment of which were not
necessary to, and in some cases ran counter to the real policy goal of
energy security, we, in a sense, set up plebian war supporters for
disappointment. While image maintenance projects such as elections shored up
public support in the short term, the lack of any "progress" toward those
so-called goals ultimately translates into a failed effort in the eyes of
the common citizen.

Such a damning perception of the occupation damages the effort, as can be
seen in flagging recruitment levels. But the negative impacts of continued
perception management efforts are myriad and cascading. Some major negatives
aside from low public and military morale due to perceived failure to
achieve fictitious "goals" include diversion of military and funding assets
due to efforts to maintain credibility of mission narrative (exacerbated by
additional diversion to the Afghanistan operation necessitated by pubic
demand following 9/11), and reduced public trust in government due to
repeated falsehoods.

This last disadvantage is already negatively affecting the execution of our
coming operation in Iran. While public relations efforts to vilify Iran's
president and exaggerate the extent of their nuclear effort have been
largely successful, they have met increased skepticism from a media and
public still stinging from the WMD claim about Iraq. This skepticism
translates into weaker support for the Iran operation than the Iraq
operation initially enjoyed.

In summary, the WMD/fostering democracy narrative on Iraq, which served the
mission well at first, has over time degraded to the point that it is a
serious liability. To ensure our mission's success and continuance beyond
the present administration and to retain party electability, this difficult
problem must be addressed.

There are few historical precedents to draw upon, in part because
information control is particularly difficult in this era, despite our
efforts in the area, especially the innovations of former Secretary
Rumsfeld. But we can look to what some of the leading public relations firms
do when faced with similar circumstances in other fields. In Hollywood, for
instance, when a movie star's credibility is impugned by rumors, the first
step is to deny the rumors and discredit those who spread them, as we have
done, with mixed results. But when the problem becomes unmanageable, many
troubled celebrities have salvaged their careers by finally "coming clean"
with their audience, admitting their transgressions and regaining public
sympathy.

It is our contention that the time has come for us "come out" on the Iraq
war. We need to jettison the current narrative for the war effort, as it has
become an albatross for the administration. In its place, we recommend a
bold, new, virtually untested tactic: telling the truth. Obviously we can't
tell the whole truth, especially with regard to our secondary goal of
destabilizing the Muslim world by fomenting sectarian violence throughout
the region (needless to say, it wouldn't help to acknowledge profiteering
efforts or the ad hoc creation of loose money pools for black ops either).
But the truth that we should tell is the simple tale of the necessity of
securing energy reserves in order to maintain American global dominance.

The new story would be short and logical: The nation needs to secure its
energy future, and that means controlling the bulk of the world's oil
reserves, before other nations get to them first. We would endeavor to tie
this broad objective to the lifestyles of regular Americans-SUVs, plastics,
air conditioning, etc., and their continued affordability. Of course, these
messages should be processed through the usual test marketing channels and
should be subjected to the analysis and recommendations of prominent message
consultants.

The new talking points need not come from the POTUS himself, at least not
until the new "true" narrative has been well established in the media. We
recommend giving the bulk of the heavy lifting to administration officials
who are seen in focus groups to be considered more "serious" and
"intelligent" by the public: Vice President Cheney, for instance, or
Secretary Rice. At the same time, we can utilize friendlies in the press to
laud the honesty of the White House, and to elicit sympathy for an
administration that, after all, only had the nation's best interests at
heart. This should also be accompanied by a series of related entertainment
efforts-a major network miniseries about a near-future dystopian scenario in
which the country has run out of oil, for instance.

This suggestion may sound radical, perhaps even suicidal, but when we
examine the facts at hand, it seems we can do no worse in promoting the war
effort than we already have. Polls show support for the war has bottomed out
at about a third of the nation, and research has shown this third, sometimes
referred to as "the base," will support whatever this administration does-we
literally cannot lose them. In fact, market research indicates that this
demographic would be particularly favorable to starkly imperialist foreign
policy goals-they have never quite been comfortable with what they consider
to be "touchy-feely" objectives in Iraq, and would likely be even more firm
in their support for war than before if we revealed an aggressive motive. It
is also a known that this demographic has the least difficulty with the
prospect of being deceived by leaders "for their own good."

With the two thirds of Americans who describe themselves as anti-war,
reactions will be more mixed. Some will be further embittered, but we will
likely win back the majority of conservatives, who will again support the
war effort if presented with a rational reason for it that directly impacts
our economy. Some of the center-left will also peel off from the anti-war
majority, and even the far left will gain some respect for the effort if we
"level" with them. In general, many will feel an appealing sense of
security, preferring a sense of global power over the current media climate
of total fear. All told, the "truth" initiative has a good chance of winning
back majority support for a continued military presence in Iraq.

A secondary positive this recommendation's implementation would generate is
that we can use the same truthful justification for future operations, not
only in Iran, but in Syria, Venezuela, Colombia, and anywhere else we may
conduct operations in the future. This will greatly reduce the expenditure
of assets and brain-power on continued efforts to demonize leaders in these
nations in anticipation of future invasion.

Negatives include increased international umbrage, especially from powerful
and energy-hungry entities such as China and Russia. While these nations and
others surely already suspect our true intentions, such honesty may be
perceived as "impolite" and a sign of disrespect. Still, it is highly
unlikely that either would be willing to challenge us militarily, excepting
minor proxy wars which will no doubt occur regardless of our rhetorical
strategy.

In conclusion, we urge the recipients of this report to look past their
natural human aversion to admitting malfeasance in this matter. Truth be
told, almost everyone has already decided that we are liars, and those who
haven't never will. Our credibility is at its ebb, and can only be bolstered
by changing direction. The truth may seem like a bizarre thing to tell the
public, but it is incontrovertible fact that it can't possibly be worse than
what we're telling them now.

Thank you for your attention.
