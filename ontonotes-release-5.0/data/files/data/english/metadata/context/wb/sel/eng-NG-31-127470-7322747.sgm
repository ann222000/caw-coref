Mugabe Gets the Milosevic Treatment

By Stephen Gowans

http://gowans.wordpress.com/2007/03/22/mugabe-gets-the-milosevic-trea...

Arthur Mutambara, the leader of one faction of Zimbabwe's main opposition
party, the MDC, and one of the principals in the Save Zimbabwe Campaign
that's at the centre of a storm of controversy over the Mugabe government's
crackdown on opposition, boasted a year ago that he was "going to remove
Robert Mugabe, I promise you, with every tool at my disposal." (1)

Educated at Oxford, the former management consultant with McKinsey & Co. was
asked in early 2006 whether "his plans might include a Ukrainian-style mass
mobilization of opponents of Mugabe's regime." (2)

"We're going to use every tool we can get to dislodge this regime," he
replied. "We're not going to rule out or in anything - the sky's the limit."
(3)

Last year Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of an opposing MDC faction, and eight of
his colleagues, were thrown out of Zambia after attending a meeting arranged
by the US ambassador to Zimbabwe, Christopher Dell, with representatives of
Freedom House, a US ruling class organization that promotes regime change in
countries that aren't sufficiently committed to free markets, free trade and
free enterprise. (4)

Funded by the billionaire speculator George Soros, USAID, the US State
Department and the US Congress's National Endowment for Democracy (whose
mission has been summed up as doing overtly what the CIA used to do
covertly), Freedom House champions the rights of journalists, union leaders
and democracy activists to organize openly to bring down governments whose
economic policies are against the profit-making interests of US bankers,
investors and corporations.

Headed by Wall St. investment banker Peter Ackerman, who produced a 2002
documentary, Bringing Down a Dictator, a follow-up to A Force More Powerful,
which celebrates the ouster of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic,
Freedom House features a rogues' gallery of US ruling class activists on its
board of directors: Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Otto Reich, Jeane
Kirkpatrick, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Steve Forbes, among others.

The campaign to replace Mugabe with the neo-liberal standard bearers of the
MDC is rotten with connections to the overthrow of Milosevic. Dell, the US
ambassador, prides himself on being one of the architects of Milosevic's
ouster. (5) He held a senior diplomatic post in Kosovo when Milosevic was
driven out of office in a US-UK engineered uprising.

Dell's mission, it would seem, is to be as provocative as possible, sparing
no effort to tarnish the image of the Mugabe government. In early November
2005, Dell declared that "neither drought nor sanctions are at the root of
Zimbabwe's decline," an implausible conclusion given that drought has
impaired economic performance in neighboring countries, and that sanctions
bar Zimbabwe from access to economic and humanitarian aid, while disrupting
trade and investment.  "The Zimbabwe government's own gross mismanagement of
the economy and its corrupt rule has brought on the crisis," Dell charged.
(6)

When not disparaging Mugabe's government, Dell can be counted on to be
doling out largesse to the opposition (US$1 million, according to one
source, to get the Save Zimbabwe Campaign off the ground earlier this year.
(7))

Responding to Dell's call for the opposition to unite, Mutambara has
declared his new unity of purpose with MDC opponent, Tsvangirai. "Our core
business," he announced, after violent clashes with the police earlier this
month, "is to drive Mugabe out of town. There is no going back. We are
working together against Robert Mugabe and his surrogates." (8)

While Mutambara is certainly working with Tsvangirai to drive Mugabe out of
town, what he doesn't explain is what he wants to replace Mugabe with.  The
opposition, and the powerful Western governments that back it, make it seem
as if they're offended by Mugabe's qualities as a leader, not his policies,
and that their aim is to restore good governance, not to impose their own
program on Zimbabwe.

We should be clear about what the MDC is and what its policies are. While
the word "democratic" in the opposition's Movement for Democratic Change
moniker evokes pleasant feelings, the party's policies are rooted in the
neo-liberal ideology of the Western ruling class. That is, the party's
policies are hardly democratic.

The MDC favors economic "liberalization", privatization and a return to the
glacial-paced willing buyer/willing seller land-redistribution regimen - a
status quo ante-friendly policy that would limit the state's ability to
redistribute land to only tracts purchased from white farmers who are
willing to sell.

Compare that to the Zanu-PF government's direction. Mugabe's government is
hardly socialist, but it has implemented social democratic policies that
elevate the public interest at least a few notches above the basement level
position it occupies under the neo-liberal tyranny favored by the MDC. A
Mutambara or Tsvangirai government would jettison policies that demand
something from foreign investors in return for doing business in Zimbabwe.
Foreign banks, for example, are required to invest 40 percent of their
profits in Zimbabwe government bonds. (9) What's more, the MDC leaders would
almost certainly end the Mugabe government's policy of favoring foreign
investors who partner with local investors to promote indigenous economic
development.  And Zimbabwe's state-owned enterprises would be sold off to
the highest bidder.

Moreover, the land redistribution program would be effectively shelved,
delaying indefinitely the achievement of one of the principal goals of
Zimbabwe's national liberation struggle - reversing the plunder of the
indigenous population's land by white settlers. Mugabe, it is sometimes
grudgingly admitted in the Western press, is a hero in rural parts of
southern Africa for his role in spearheading land reform, something other
south African governments have lacked the courage to pursue vigorously.
South African president Thabo Mbeki's reluctance to join in the collective
excoriation of Mugabe is often attributed to "respect for Mr. Mugabe as a
revolutionary hero (he led the fight that ended white rule in Zimbabwe in
1980, and was a key opponent of apartheid) and because the issue of white
ownership of land in South African is also sensitive." (10)

Contrast respect for Mugabe with the thin layer of support the US-backed
Save Zimbabwe Campaign has been able to muster. It "does not yet have
widespread grassroots support,"  (11) but it does have the overwhelming
backing of the US, the UK, the Western media and US ruling class regime
change organizations, like Freedom House. Is it any surprise that Zanu-PF
regards the controversy swirling around its crackdown on the opposition's
latest provocation as an attempt by an oppressor to return to power by proxy
through the MDC?
