My first bike: Helmet &amp; California License Question

I just bought my first bike and may I ask two questions I can't seem to get
the answer from my brother on?

The first question is about HELMETS for beginners.

What's the difference between Snell full face helmets Shoei or Simpsons or
HJC or whatever? My brother says Shoei is the best but he can't tell me
why. As long as it's Snell, how can I tell the difference between a 125
dollar HJC from a 500 dollar Shoei? They both look, fit, and feel the same
to me in the store and I borrowed my brother' Shoei which didn't fit and it
was horrid.

What REALLY is the TRUE difference (please remove advertising and marketing
from this discussion) between a Snell Shoei and a Snell Simpsons and a
Snell Bell from a cheaper Snell HJC (full face only).

The second question is about the California license. My brother said to not
even think about taking the dumb California DMV motorcycle driving test
saying the DMV designed that test just to make me pay the money to take the
MSF class even though I'm in my mid twenties and don't have to take the
class by law. He didn't take the class because he got his license when we
lived down south, but I never had a license.

Where do I get the information to take the MSF class?

The first part of your post I will leave to those who like to argue
about which helmet is the best and why. As for the second part, you can
go to www.ca-msp.org or www.msf-usa.org to find out any information you
will need to find a local training site in California.

The difference between better grade helmet brands is the fit and styling.
Some are for round skulls, some for pear, etc. Try on lots of helmets until
you find one you like, then buy the same model and size cheaper online.

Take the MSF course. It can't hurt you to know more about riding, and you
won't have to do the dreaded &quot;lollipop test&quot;

In terms of safety, Snell full-face helmets are pretty much all
the same.  And helmets for beginners are exactly the same as
helmets for racers.  The only real difference is that expensive
one typically have lots of vents and whizbang features.  You'll
be perfectly OK starting with a cheaper helmet if you'd like.

If you're not already an experienced rider, I highly recommend
that you not do anything beyond sitting on the bike and making
vroom vroom noises in the driveway without taking the MSF class.
Not only does it save you from the ridiculous keyhole test, but
it will give you extremely valuable accident-avoidance skills in
an environment free of idiot-piloted SUVs.  Wouldn't you rather
learn to panic stop before your life depends on it?

Soooooo, now the important thing... what'd you get?

Fit, comfort, noise level, durability, ability to clean the headliner etc.
Not a lot of it has to do with protection, most of the higher price is for
gee whiz features and wear comfort. Which, mind you, is important if you put
enough miles on the bike, and also if you don't wear earplugs.

Shoei is not a great fit for me personally, by the way, but it is for many
others. You have to try them on - big moey is not a guarantee it'll work for
*you*.

There's no dboubting Shoei quality, but if it's not the right fit for you

Your brother is right. Take the MSF class. Plenty of classes and sources

Great advice, Patti. I hope, too, that she does ZERO riding until it's
during the MSF course.

I also highly recommend the Ride Like A Pro video. It teaches what the
motorcycle cops learn -- with emphasis on &quot;head AND eyes pointed where you
want to go&quot; and the low speed techniques utilizing the &quot;friction zone&quot; and
the rear brake.

There's really no such thing as a &quot;beginner's&quot; helmet, so long as it's Snell
approved. They all have to meet the same safety standards to get the Snell
label, although there's not much doubt you get better quality -and often
lighter weight as well- as the prices escalate.
You *do* want to take the time to try on a lot of helmets and get the one
that fits you best  -and BTW it should be just a bit tight at first. Helmets
loosen up somewhat as the foam lining compresses with age, and you don't
want it to be flopping back and forth on your noggin once it's broken in.

Mostly looks, ventilation, suitability for differing head shapes, and
differing types of visor attachment. Brand differences aren't as important
as getting the proper fit, as an ill-fitting helmet can give you a whopping
headache after a couple of hours.
After a Snell sticker and a good fit, you also want to take weight into
consideration. The lighter the helmet, the more comfortable it will be when
wearing it for several hours at a time.

I didn't find the DMV motorcycle driving test to be difficult at all, but
I'd been riding  -mostly in the dirt-  for over 40 years when I finally took
it. And even if you could pass the dreaded &quot;keyhole&quot; test, it still wouldn't
teach you the hundred and one things the MSF will teach you about riding
safely and sensibly: stuff I and a bunch of my pre-MSF riding buddies had to
pick up the hard way.

There's been many near-endless debates about helmets (search Google) so I
won't comment on that.
As for the MSF course, TAKE IT!  In addition to the good reasons listed in
other replies here, you'll probably save enough in insurance premiums to
more than pay for the course fee.

Enjoy your ride!

Arai, Shoei, Simpson, HJC, etc. are manufacturers of helmets. Snell and
DOT are testing standards. DOT means (United States) Department Of
Transportation and any helmet you wear must have that certification.
Snell is the name of a guy who died in a race car accident; the
foundation named after him does research and testing of helmets for a
variety of sports including motorcycling.

Arai and Shoei are widely held to be the &quot;best&quot;, but as long as a helmet
meets DOT or Snell, it will work. (If it meets Snell requirements, it
meets DOT.) But the most important thing is whether it's comfortable for
you.

As others have written, it's all about materials and comfort. Get the
helmet that fits you best. When I bought my first helmet, my brother

A little OT from OP questions. After riding for 30 years, In abouy 1953
Colorado DMV decided motorcycle riders  must have a designated (M) on their
drivers license or be ticketed. Drove done to the DMV and asked how I would
get my cycle there for the test legally And was told We don't watch to see
how you get here. The TEST was in a small parking lot. Fellow giving test
said go to far end of lot, Drive as fast as you can towards me and slam on
the brakes so as not to hit me. Well I gave theDMV my $$$ and passed test.
What a sham. I still get my (M) on drivers license to this day. But only
trail ride.

You don't learn just watching any DVD. You learn by practicing the exercises
and following the techniques outlined in the DVD. The www.ridelikeapro.com
DVD makes you aware of these techniques and outlines the exercises that
utilize them.

In the few posts I've read of yours, you always manage to show what a real
idiot you are. Try thinking before you post and you'll win some respect.

full face only if you don't like your face).

Nor does passing the MSF course indicate much of anything about your
competence to ride a motorcycle in traffic on a public highway. It
gives you some rudimentary tools to practice with, which is far better
than nothing, but to ride relatively safely on the street requires a
well-developed set of skills which take a significant amount of time,
practice and ability.

The best way to start getting those skills is to practice riding a
light-weight dual sport off the public roads.

But what do I know...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In terms of safety, Snell full-face helmets are pretty much all
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same.  And helmets for beginners are exactly the same as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; helmets for racers.  The only real difference is that expensive
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one typically have lots of vents and whizbang features.  You'll
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be perfectly OK starting with a cheaper helmet if you'd like.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you're not already an experienced rider, I highly recommend
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that you not do anything beyond sitting on the bike and making
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vroom vroom noises in the driveway without taking the MSF class.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Not only does it save you from the ridiculous keyhole test, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it will give you extremely valuable accident-avoidance skills in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an environment free of idiot-piloted SUVs.  Wouldn't you rather
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; learn to panic stop before your life depends on it?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Great advice, Patti. I hope, too, that she does ZERO riding until it's

&gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt; want to go&quot; and the low speed techniques utilizing the &quot;friction zone&quot;

He's her brother, so he'll treat her like a baby and take great care not to

Generally speaking, yeah, but there are exceptions. Brother may well be the
instructor of the year in waiting :-) but I was thinking more along the
lines of &quot;out of the way&quot; instruction (quiet area, parking lots, etc) so the
OP can get to grips with steering and gear changning rather than learning
roadcraft from her bro.

road on trail bikes. I hope they will know how to confidently ride

this way they will only have to worry about the road rules without the

Um, you taken an MSF course lately? If not, would it surprise you to
find out that we do include the watching of &quot;DVD's&quot; as part of the
classroom portion of the BRC? It helps to visually reinforce what we
just went over in class. And several of these &quot;Training-aids&quot; talk about
(and show) techniques that we will be working on when we take to the range.

If you think that the OP's brother can give her some instruction in the
&quot;basics&quot;, why have her take the MSF BasicRider Course? We tell the
students that what they take from the course is just the basics and they
should in no way consider themselves expert riders. We try to make them
understand that they need to get lots of practice, and work on becoming
a proficient rider.

In trying to teach her the so-called basics, what if he (not being a
trained instructor) showed her incorrectly, or showed her the use of bad
habits that might get her hurt? I do work with my wife on her riding
but, if I were not an experienced  MSF riderCoach, I would not be doing
so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of safety, Snell full-face helmets are pretty much all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the same.  And helmets for beginners are exactly the same as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; helmets for racers.  The only real difference is that expensive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one typically have lots of vents and whizbang features.  You'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be perfectly OK starting with a cheaper helmet if you'd like.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're not already an experienced rider, I highly recommend
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you not do anything beyond sitting on the bike and making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vroom vroom noises in the driveway without taking the MSF class.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not only does it save you from the ridiculous keyhole test, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it will give you extremely valuable accident-avoidance skills in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an environment free of idiot-piloted SUVs.  Wouldn't you rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to panic stop before your life depends on it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Soooooo, now the important thing... what'd you get?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Great advice, Patti. I hope, too, that she does ZERO riding until it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during the MSF course.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also highly recommend the Ride Like A Pro video. It teaches what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; motorcycle cops learn -- with emphasis on &quot;head AND eyes pointed where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to go&quot; and the low speed techniques utilizing the &quot;friction zone&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the rear brake.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Never heard anything so daft in my life. No-one ever learned how to ride
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; motorcycle by sitting in front of the TV watching a fucking DVD, they
&gt;&gt;&gt; learned by getting on a bike.
&gt;&gt; I agree.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the OP's brother is a rider, then he could giver some intital
&gt;&gt;&gt; instruction
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the basics, after which she could gain some experience by pootling
&gt;&gt;&gt; about.
&gt;&gt; Uh ... Brother might be a good rider, but how much experience does he
&gt;&gt; have teaching riding?

&gt; Well I don't, but he's probably a caring person :-)

&gt; How do you know that an experienced rider's idea
&gt;&gt; of &quot;basic&quot; is appropriate?

&gt; He's her brother, so he'll treat her like a baby and take great care not to
&gt; steer her up a rough road. At least I hope he would and anything's better
&gt; than an absolute noob trying things on her own with NO help.

&gt;&gt; Just  take the MSF class. :-)

&gt; Indeed, but if she's got to wait for a class, some parking lot riding (with
&gt; the help of her bro) probably wouldn't hurt.
">

It could do far more harm than good. He might be a so-called
&quot;experienced&quot; rider that is completely full of extremely bad habits. I
have had many of these come through our range, and they are very hard to
deal with and it is very hard to get them to change their bad habits and
do things correctly. Leaning, counter-steering, using proper
counter-weight techniques, turning their heads, proper braking are
difficult to teach when they have been doing it differently for a while.

We teach the students to use all four fingers on the front brake for
better control and to keep their fingers from getting hurt in the event
that the bike goes over. When someone with any dirt-bike experience
comes through the BRC, it is next to impossible to get them to use all
fingers when they have been using only two for a long time.

&gt; I'm showing my boys the basics of how to ride and control a bike.....off
&gt; road on trail bikes. I hope they will know how to confidently ride
&gt; before they go for their licences and defensive riding courses. At least
&gt; this way they will only have to worry about the road rules without the
&gt; added distraction of not being confident with the controls.
">

Though I might suggest taking them to the MSF Dirtbike School, as I am
with my daughter, teaching them how ride off-road is far different than
trying to teach them to ride on the road. They are two completely
different animals. But, I have to say, even though I have to work with
dirt riders on changing habits they learned from the trails, they come
into the class with far more confidence and knowledge of the controls
than pure novice riders.

I'm sure you're doing an excellent job, but the 4 finger thing is
baloney :)

It doesn't provide better braking or clutch control, and there is no
significant safety advantage. You need to be able to keep control of
the throttle and hold on to the handle bars for steering input at all
times, which requires at least 2 fingers (counting the thumb) on the
bar grips at all times.

I don't think this needs to become a critique of the MSF course; it
has enough other pressures trying to tear it apart already. I do think
the MSF is a good thing, in general.

I suspect the reason you can't get dirt-bikers to use 4 fingers on the
front brake is because they know how to stop the bike perfectly well
with 2 fingers...

That is a load of crap. If your braking, you had better not need to
worry about steering. Try to brake hard and steer at the same time. I
bet you'll be picking yourself up off the pavement. And if you still
have two fingers under the brake lever when that happens, I hope you
fall to the left because you will most likely break your ring finger and
pinky if you go down to the right. And if you are braking, you need to
be rolling off the throttle, which is all but impossible if you have
your fingers still wrapped around it. I don't know about you but, I have
perfect control of my handlebars and throttle when I use all four
fingers to brake or use the clutch.

It is my experiance with dirt-bike riders that they have trouble with

they can't roll off the throttle quickly and don't use proper braking
technique.

THAT is the load of crap!  Braking and &quot;brake hard&quot; are different
things.   99.999% of my braking is not hard -- that is why you're
supposed to be looking ahead, so you will not have to brake hard. If
you are no where near the edge of performance it is perfectly
acceptable to brake in turns, turn while braking, shift gears,
whatever.  If you are braking you likely will be downshifting as well,
and that requires a blip of the throttle for smoothness.

In an ideal world everyone would have had hundreds of hours of track
time, practicing at high and low speeds, on pavement and dirt,
drilling on emergency procedures, and so on before he ventured onto a
public road.  In the real world if you tried to do that nobody would
ride because the training would cost more than the bike.

You seem to be expecting more than can be reasonably delivered in the
time available in the MSF course.

Please explain to me when, and where you are going to use this
technique. It is not as important as the rest of the evaluations, so it
carries less weight. You very well may have been in a class that had a
had a large share of students that had trouble with the U-turn box.It
has been my experience that by the time the evaluations start 75-80% of
the riders can stay within the boundaries of the box. You need to
remember that the majority of the students that take the MSF BasicRider
Course are pure novice riders and have never even sat on a motorcycle,
let alone have the slightest riding experience.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The other evaluations carry far more weight and include swerving, quick
stopping and proper cornering technique. All you will need to know when
riding on the road and around other traffic. As most of you know, the
number one cause of single vehicle motorcycle accidents is cornering.
Using incorrect cornering technique, or poor cornering judgment. We have
several exercises that try to teach the riders the proper techniques for
cornering, including using proper judgment. we also have an exercise
that attempts to teach the riders the proper technique for quick
stopping in a curve.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I can agree with you about the DMV lollipop test being a big joke.
Riding around circles at slow speed is no indication of how your going
to be able to ride on the road.

While it may not be perfect, the MSF BasicRider Course is far better
than anything that is presently on the market today. Between the range
and classroom, there is a lot of information that Novice and experienced
riders call learn something from, if they come into the course with an
open mind.

If that is the attitude you took into the course, I am not a bit

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Great advice, Patti. I hope, too, that she does ZERO riding until it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during the MSF course.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also highly recommend the Ride Like A Pro video. It teaches what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; motorcycle cops learn -- with emphasis on &quot;head AND eyes pointed where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want to go&quot; and the low speed techniques utilizing the &quot;friction zone&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the rear brake.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Never heard anything so daft in my life. No-one ever learned how to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ride a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; motorcycle by sitting in front of the TV watching a fucking DVD, they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learned by getting on a bike.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the OP's brother is a rider, then he could giver some intital
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instruction
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the basics, after which she could gain some experience by pootling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Uh ... Brother might be a good rider, but how much experience does he
&gt;&gt;&gt; have teaching riding?

&gt;&gt; Well I don't, but he's probably a caring person :-)

&gt;&gt; How do you know that an experienced rider's idea
&gt;&gt;&gt; of &quot;basic&quot; is appropriate?

&gt;&gt; He's her brother, so he'll treat her like a baby and take great care not
&gt;&gt; to steer her up a rough road. At least I hope he would and anything's
&gt;&gt; better than an absolute noob trying things on her own with NO help.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just  take the MSF class. :-)

&gt;&gt; Indeed, but if she's got to wait for a class, some parking lot riding
&gt;&gt; (with the help of her bro) probably wouldn't hurt.

&gt; It could do far more harm than good. He might be a so-called &quot;experienced&quot;
&gt; rider that is completely full of extremely bad habits. I have had many of
&gt; these come through our range, and they are very hard to deal with and it
&gt; is very hard to get them to change their bad habits and do things
&gt; correctly. Leaning, counter-steering, using proper counter-weight
&gt; techniques, turning their heads, proper braking are difficult to teach
&gt; when they have been doing it differently for a while.

&gt; We teach the students to use all four fingers on the front brake for
&gt; better control and to keep their fingers from getting hurt in the event
&gt; that the bike goes over. When someone with any dirt-bike experience comes
&gt; through the BRC, it is next to impossible to get them to use all fingers
&gt; when they have been using only two for a long time.

Yeah, them out of control dirt bike riders. What CAN one do with them?

&gt;I just bought my first bike and may I ask two questions I can't seem to get

&gt; The first question is about HELMETS for beginners.

&gt; The second question is about the California license. My brother said to
&gt; not
&gt; even think about taking the dumb California DMV motorcycle driving test
&gt; saying the DMV designed that test just to make me pay the money to take
&gt; the
&gt; MSF class even though I'm in my mid twenties and don't have to take the
&gt; class by law. He didn't take the class because he got his license when we
&gt; lived down south, but I never had a license.
">

Lots of replies to both of your questions.  I just wanted to chime in and
advise you to take the MSF course.  Basically what it does is give you some
familiarity with riding the bike while in safe controlled situation.  You'll
practice things like stopping quickly, avoiding unexpected obstacles, and
you'll learn techniques that will make you a better, safer rider more
quickly than you might on your own.

When I started riding there was no MSF.  I remember the day I picked up my
first bike.  The sum total of my experience and training had been scanning
the motorcycle test booklet at the DMV, then completing the 15-question
written test before being handed a learner's license.  Basically they said
&quot;go figure it out&quot;.  I recall sitting astride this 500cc beast and
marvelling that they'd let someone as blatantly unqualified as myself
operate such a rocketship amongst other drivers.

Would you give the keys to your car to your 15-year-old child and tell them
&quot;go figure it out&quot;?

Would you consider operating a crane or other piece of heavy equipment
without some rudimentary instruction?

Would you hook up your own electrical service from the transformer on the
pole?

A mistake on a motorcycle is always painful, often debilitating, and
sometimes fatal.  Stack the odds in your favor.  Take the course.

&gt;&gt; It doesn't provide better braking or clutch control, and there is no

&gt;&gt; at all times.

&gt; It is my experiance with dirt-bike riders that they have trouble with any

Time? Not all MSF courses are open when you wnat them to be, so it's ewither
do some off street learning or do fuck all.

We tell the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; students that what they take from the course is just the basics and they
&gt; should in no way consider themselves expert riders. We try to make them
&gt; understand that they need to get lots of practice, and work on becoming a

That's pretty much what ALL courses provide. The basics and no more, so
you're not unique.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In trying to teach her the so-called basics, what if he (not being a

&gt; habits that might get her hurt?

What, like not letting the clutch out too quickly. Get real David, people
have been jumping onto bikes since Adam was a lad and actually managing to
ride them. The big problem these days is the Nanny State mindset. No-one has
the ability to do ANYTHNG unless they've been taught by a teacher, but tell
me, who taught the teacher and who taught the teachers teacher? Go back and
you WILL find the one that had zero instruction from a &quot;qualified&quot; examiner.
And seeing as the MSF isn't anything but a money generator and a way of
avoiding a REAL test, it doesn't actually mean anything. If you had a test
at the end of your course which the rider MUST pass before he/she was
allowed to ride, then it'd have at least SOME weight behind it, but the MSF
is used to avoid a test.

Granted some people will &quot;take something away from the course&quot;, but their
main reason for doing the course is so they don't have to sit the DMV test.

&gt; I do work with my wife on her riding but, if I were not an experienced
