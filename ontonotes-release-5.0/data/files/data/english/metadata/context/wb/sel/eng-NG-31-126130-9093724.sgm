Trying to figure out how to post this to Jungleland or Dime but
haven't figured out how to get it seeded yet.  Sounds very solid,

For those that aren't patient, you can grab it at www.nyctaper.com .
He did a great job and we'll just need to find a complete AL to finish
it off!

Rave On!

This is good news.  That version of Jungleland is the best I've ever

sounded just like every version of Jungleland i heard on the Rising

course was the highlight of the show.
