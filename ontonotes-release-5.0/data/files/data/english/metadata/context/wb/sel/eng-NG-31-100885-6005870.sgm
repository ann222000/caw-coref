Hi all,

Oour house is a two storey with two of the kids bedrooms and a bathroom
downstairs.  It is carpeted and I would say its quite steep.  Can bunnies go
up and down stairs.  If I block this off with a Kid proof gate would Bunny
jump up and over and have a nasty accident?

As for Bunnies on beds.... I have a waterbed and I would imagine a burrowing
Bunny on that would be utter disaster...LOL

Hi Kate,

As with all things bunny, it depends on the bunny!  My first guy (Jasper)
was confined to a single room (the family room) because he wouldn't attempt
the ONE step up out of the room (he lived here, in the room, for over six
years).

When we got Watson, imagine my surprise on his first morning with us when I
turned around upstairs and there stood baby Watson!  He had found his way up
the stairs (through the kitchen and hallway).  For the rest of his life,
Watson pretty much had free rein in the house.  A couple times a week, he
would scoot up the stairs, hang out for a few hours, and then return to
"his" room (aka the same family room).

Now we have two bunnies that live upstairs, and neither of them have figured
out the steps; I generally say, rather unkindly (yet true) that Zeta is too
lazy and Louie is too dopey!

As far as a kiddy gate, again it depends on the height.  Watson was able to
clear any gate (I gave up pretty early in the game with him).  I wouldn't be
comfortable with a gate at the top of the stairs.

I'm guessing a waterbed should be off limits too!

Cathy

Nibbler has never met stairs, but he LOVES going up AND down.  And then
up and down again.  And so on :)  If anyone thought bunnies didn't like
heights or to climb, they haven't met Nibbler. I'd be terrified of a
fence at the top of stairs - he jumps any fence less than 4ft high,
whether he can see over it or not, so I'd feel he would jump it.  It
probably depends on your guy, though, but maybe a bunny gate at the
bottom of the stairs would safer?  Or if that's not tall enough, some
kind of dutch door thing?

Bunny goes up stairs no problem.  She is afraid to go down them, though.

Our bonded pair love to race up the stairs.  First thing when I let
them out of their room in the morning is to bound upstairs. Right now
we are using a baby gate so they can't get to the 2nd floor where our
foster lives.  It's 24" high and I have it on a step that makes it at
least 30" high and they don't try to jump it.
Our guy upstairs hasn't tried the steps, and I made a gate wtih NIC
panels so he want go down and they are high enough that he hasn't
jumped (none of ours are really jumpers), BUT this morning when i went
upstairs he had pushed the gate enough so he could slide under it and
hopped down to the landing.  he was looking a little confused!  One
more thing for me to worry about!

Our first bunny climbed the stairs about 2 days after we brought him
home...Biscuit was more tentative and it took Roxie (Biscuit's lovebun)
not too long to try the steps either.  They all go up faster than come
down....seems a little akward for them.

I keep all bunnies off the beds and a waterbed spells disaster to me.

it's impossible for me to keep my guys off the beds.  while my daughter is
away at school, i have plastic over her mattress with an old blanket over
that for dipper to play on.

morgan just thinks my entire bedroom is her palace!  nothing is off limits
to her.  she will walk on anything, shiny floor, tile, you name it, she'll
do it.  that's why we have a big suitcase in the bedroom doorway.  dipper's
living quarters are only six feet across the hall from morgan's and they are
not friendly.  don't want to come home and see fur all over....that has
happened in the past and it was not nice.

i've been trying to teach dipper how to go up and down the stairs but she
has to step on some bare wood floor and she absolutely HATES to do that.
morgan goes up and down stairs without a care.

mickey, morgan (it is my palace, i just let you hoomins occupy some space!)

lol,
This reminds me of the day we 'lost'  Sweepie......

Sweepie was an outdoors bunni, he loved to romp in the garden, binky and
nibble the grass, but one summer when freely enjoying the garden, he went
missing.  We hunted everywhere for him, every nook and cranny was searched
in the garden and the house......... until we feared he had escaped into the
fields beyond and would never be seen again.

Finally, we searched upstairs, which would have been a near impossibility,
since Sweepie lived outside in a fine house that he shared with Sooty, and
later Dusty, but loved coming indoors to explore, nibble wires and dig in
the carpets!

He was found eventually, upstairs, sniffing about under the boys bunk beds.
After that, he regularly came indoors, climbed the stairs, which are steep,
and would also manage to get back down again, although once he went rolly
polly from halfways down, head over heels, but came to no harm..

Such an inquisitive boy and we loved him for it, kept us all in stitches.

RIP dear Sweepie, bigboy.

Julia

yes kate.  if morgan can't see what is on the other side, she has no desire
to jump on top of the suitcase.  i can't figure it out myself.  she knows
what is on the other side because if the suitcase is moved away, she is
faster than lightening to get across the hall and into dipper's room.  yet
if the suitcase is in the doorway, she won't bother trying to jump on top of
it and then down the other side.

i'm just thankful she isn't as inquisitive as other buns are.

Yes I do ;-)!  I just have to laugh so hard at the lengths we go to to
bunny proof.

I'm finding that my Gooberheads are experts at finding trouble. Thelma
jumped on top of Hershey's cage and ended up behind it stuck in a
space just large enough for her body.  She's also ended up behind the
entertainment center.  I've put Nicholas' toys up on my subwoofer to
block off the back of the entertainment center, but Louise just jumps
up on top of the toys.  How high can I go she says.  No matter what I
do they always find trouble it seems.

Of the 4 I've had, Mr H d.Bun's favourite vantage point was right at
the top of the staircase where he could see into both bedrooms, the
living room, the door into the kitchen and the front door, so when
visitors arrived he could gallop high speed downstairs and see who they
were and what they had that he could eat.  Mrs Rosie sat there with him
and was equally  the stairs, but just kept a watch on visitors from the
top of the stairs.

Cinnamon hates the stairs - she will have nothing to do with them.
Nutmeg has only been here a few weeks, but shows no interest in them at
all.

So I agree, it depends on the bunny.

if your steps are steep, i would go with the baby gate, i have 2 buns, and a
gate at the stairs, as my house has three levels, i find the gates great,
but of course they are supervised.
have fun and enjoy
