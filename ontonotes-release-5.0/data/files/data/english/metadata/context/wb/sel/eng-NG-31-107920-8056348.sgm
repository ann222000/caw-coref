curious as I am unable to watch the race, but followed online as it
were. seemed that lewis came in early and did 3 stops when everone
else did 2- was there a problem ? and was this his 1st or 2nd race on
the engine?

The second stop appeared to be an &quot;early&quot; as he had just caught a gaggle

Agree, very strange tactic.  Perhaps they had in mind Schumacher's 4
stops a few years back.  I'm surprised that he remained ahead of
Kubica.

Maybe something to do with the weather (rain was supposed to hit the
race) ?

Anyway Ferrari were clearly faster while BMW not a real threat so it
did not matter at the end of the day...

3 stops is a legitimate strategy. Because of the short entry into and exit
from the pitlane Magny Cours is the circuit for such a strategy. In one
preview I saw 3 stops suggested as the optimum strategy.

Schumacher won here making 4 stops.

But Hamilton is no Schumacher..

But only if you're out in front.  Good job he got past Kubica as
easily as he did and did not find it as difficult as FA did to get

online, the timing showed about 20seconds for each stop, so if he was
relying on less fuel and fresh rubber to gain him the lead he would
have had to get about .5 sec per lap on the ferrari; but then again
perhaps the bigger picture included staying ahead of the rest of the
pack and limit his point loss to the ferraris over which he already
has a good advantage.

The timing of his first stop showed that he had less fuel than the
Ferraris, and unless he was going to run a long stint somewhere it was
going to be a 3-stopper.

It occured to me that maybe they chose a strategy that allowed for
some flexibility. Fred started with the same fuel load but was able to
run a two-stopper. It also occured to me that since Fred had started
on the softs McLaren now knew exactly how many laps they could get out
of the softs at race pace and decided to set things up so that
Hamilton would get that number of laps on the softs in a light car at
the end and perhaps pick up a place when other drivers had graining
problems.

Hamilton was quite clear about how he intended to start the race in a
pre race interview. He fully expected to pass Massa and be in the lead
by passing him at the first turn or at turn 5. In the post race press
conference, he said he was faster than Kimi, but aerodynamics
prevented him form overtaking.

Had the start worked, and if he had indeed been faster then the
ferraries, the 3 stop strategy might well have worked.

I assume that had he been infront, he would have stopped well before
the others, but rejoined in clear air, thus giving hime the ability to
ram home the advantage.

All that said, I think it would be fairly insane to plan a strategy on
making a start good enough to get in the lead. It not easily
controllable and relies on the other drivers not crashing the party.

Personally, I think Hamilton made a mistake; he screwed up the start.
I know its hard to see on TV but my instant reaction was that Hamilton
was off the line slow and not, wow, what a start form Kimi. Im not so
sure Kimi made a 'great' start. I think Hamilton was slow, and the
entire strategy went to shit.

So, maybe not so perfect after all :)

Perhaps he has been reading too much of his own press.

It was indeed a flawed strategy. LH has rarely been quicker off the
line and being on the &quot;dirty side&quot; was never going to help. He has
mugged others due mainly to great spatial awareness and taking
advantage of them tripping over one another.

As it happened he couldn't even keep up with Kimi in the first stint.

They got it wrong but no real harm was done.

As for LH he's still the new boy on the block. He still has plenty of
time to attain divinity. He's on the learning curve not everything
comes with talent.

Ferrari picking up their game gave me what I wished for, it is just a
shame it coincided with McLaren making a pigs ear of it.

McLaren had their &quot;same tactics for both drivers&quot; system. With
Alonso's problems in the qualifying this was a bad choice, but
nevertheless, Lewis and Fernando made both their first and second
stops on the same laps. This was possible only because Alonso was so
much behind Hamilton.

So, with the same two stops Alonso had a two-stop race, while
Hamilton's tactics was changed to a three-stopper.  Hamilton told this
in the post race press conference. You couldn't really tell from the
first stop how many stops there was to come.

I don't really understand why Hamilton's startegy was changed, since
all the close competitors had a short first stint also, so nobody was
on a one-stopper. Hamilton didn't have any realistic chance to be more
than third at the time of the second stop. Unless indeed they hoped
for rain and a scheduled pit stop to change for wets/intermediates.
Even the third place became a very close call with Kubica, as we saw.

To Alonso the rather short second stint was disasterous. He overtook
both Heidfeld and Fisichella on track, yet they both ended above him
in the final standings. They should have filled him up for a long
second stint. Why didn't they? The &quot;same tactics&quot; rule?

I believe the chosen short first stint was because McLaren noticed in
the practices they didn't have the pace. The only way to get a pole
and ahead of the Ferraris was to be considerably lighter. But Massa
was on pretty light as well, so it didn't work. When Kimi managed to
get second in the start, the race was pretty much over for Hamilton.
He was bound to be third at best (without Ferrari trouble).

Had the Ferraris not taken the lead and pulled away, there would have
been a more interesting race tacticswise, but since that didn't
happen, it was lost for McLaren from the start.

&gt; McLaren had their &quot;same tactics for both drivers&quot; system. With
&gt; Alonso's problems in the qualifying this was a bad choice, but
&gt; nevertheless, Lewis and Fernando made both their first and second
&gt; stops on the same laps. This was possible only because Alonso was so
&gt; much behind Hamilton.

&gt; So, with the same two stops Alonso had a two-stop race, while
&gt; Hamilton's tactics was changed to a three-stopper.  Hamilton told this
&gt; in the post race press conference. You couldn't really tell from the
&gt; first stop how many stops there was to come.

&gt; I don't really understand why Hamilton's startegy was changed, since
&gt; all the close competitors had a short first stint also, so nobody was
&gt; on a one-stopper. Hamilton didn't have any realistic chance to be more
&gt; than third at the time of the second stop. Unless indeed they hoped
&gt; for rain and a scheduled pit stop to change for wets/intermediates.
&gt; Even the third place became a very close call with Kubica, as we saw.

McLaren changed his strategy as a defensive tactic to preserve 3rd place
having conceded they could do no better.

&quot;We then started to evaluate everything that could go wrong, or
everything that was likely to cause us to lose third place, and then we
switched him to a strategy to guarantee third place, and that was really
what that was all about.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To Alonso the rather short second stint was disasterous. He overtook
&gt; both Heidfeld and Fisichella on track, yet they both ended above him
&gt; in the final standings. They should have filled him up for a long
&gt; second stint. Why didn't they? The &quot;same tactics&quot; rule?

Yes - that was odd. They may have gotten Alonso into 4th on strategy.

I don't remember all the time differences and all, but I think it was
pretty clear Hamilton was going to be third anyway. So I'm not sure
what they really were preserving. My note on Kubica was wrong, because
he still had a stop to go at the time of that battle.

Had there been a Safety Car, for example, between Kubica's second stop
and Hamilton's third, it could have all gone very wrong for Lewis.
Then again, the same applies vice versa before Kubica's second stop.
Maybe Mclaren was cautious about BMW Sauber's strategies, which have
often been different from others.

Complain about different tactics, and this is what you get,
Fernando? ;)

Two changes of direction does not constitute weaving, as you well know,
Brendan. And is not illegal, unlike the instances above, which were.

&gt; Had the start worked, and if he had indeed been faster then the

Justify, with numbers, that utterly absurd pronouncement.

Or retract it, of course, which is far easier.
