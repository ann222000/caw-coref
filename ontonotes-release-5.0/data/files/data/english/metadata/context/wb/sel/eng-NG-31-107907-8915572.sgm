A while back I wrote about the possibility of the Corvette, Viper and
our beloved Cobra switching from strictly RWD to all-wheel drive.  The
thinking was with all three cars now offering 500+, further increases
in horsepower to stay ahead of the competition would become a joke.
&quot;Wow, my new Cobra/Viper/Vette, with its extra 50 horsepower this
year, can now roast the tires 25 feet longer than Brand X's car.&quot;
Well, I guess the Corvette engineers have been thinking much the same
thing for a while now.  Seems the next generation Corvette -- due out
sometime around 2010 -- is this close &gt;&lt; to getting the green light to
become a mid-engine sports car.  I figured AWD would be easier and
cheaper, but word has it the Corvette's Chief wants the next-
generation Vette to be a take-no-prisoners World beater.  And word has
it the spy pics are absolutely stunning. Price for this gorgeous next
generation techno-marvel: about the cost of today's convertible
Vette.  If GM can deliver, they will, no doubt, turn the sports car
world upside down.

Which brings us back to our Cobra.  It's obvious Ford has recently --
since the 2000 R model -- been trying to keep the Cobra in the Vette's
rear view, if not its side-view mirrors.  But now with the Vette
likely to get the advantage/traction of a mid-engine design, what is
Ford's well-muscled pony supposed to do to keep up if adding more HP/
tire smoke isn't enough?  Obviously, it wouldn't make sense to design
a mid-engine Mustang, but will Ford offer a Cobra with AWD?

I remember reading a while back, in a well-known car magazine, about the
imminent arrival of the mid-engine Corvette. 1973, I believe it was, and
this beast was supposed to arrive in time for the 1976 model year. Uh,
didn't happen.

Ford will never offer an AWD Mustang in my driving lifetime.  It goes

I agree.  Ford can't polish a $25k V-8 RWD muscle car into an AWD
Corvette chaser.  If Ford wants a Corvette challenger then they need to
design a dedicated chassis and drive train.... just like GM does.

I don't believe GM is going to make the next generation of Vette a mid
engine car as it has excellent weight distribution as is.  I think there
is a good chance it will remain RWD.  Next gen Vettes have been more an
improvement on the last one than a complete redesign.  I don't think the
next one will be that radical a change (i.e AWD) from the current one.

Yes Paul, GM has in the past considered building a mid-engine Vette.
But this is the new GM -- the one that currently builds the best sport
car for the dollar on the planet, period.  It's going to happen...
look for it in 2010.

It is.  That's why I'm not.  I'm simply stating that it's obvious Ford
has recently --
since the 2000 R model -- been trying to keep the Cobra's straight-
line performance comparable to the Vette and Viper.  And in the
Mustang's current configuration, just throwing more horsepower at it
won't get the job done.  Either they are going to have to lighten the
car A LOT or increase traction.  And increasing traction could
increase sales in the North, so offering AWD makes sense.  Do you
disagree with this?

Seeing that the Mustang is Ford's [only?] recent success story, the
fact there's a slew of competition -- from the new Camaro, Challenger
and a RWD Hyundai -- about to make their market debut, and an upcoming
generation of new buyers who like cutting-edge technology, I think it
would be wise for them to keep all their &quot;options on the table&quot; if

I'm confused.

All of these horsepower advances are great, and I really hope that Ford
beats our horse to death.

But aren't we at cross-purposes here?

The surge to Go Green is approaching critical mass. Aside from the whole
global warming thing (whether you believe it to be fact or not), the
political climate alone dictates that we pursue other energy sources. Every
year, there will be stronger forces trying to wean us off of oil-based
internal combustion engines. The clock is ticking.

How is it that developmental engineers have been given the go-ahead to spend
untold millions of budgetary dollars to create ever-more-powerful versions
of a transportation device that may soon go the way of the dinosaurs? Isn't
anyone looking forward, or is this a purposely shortsighted project to make
immediate profit, while delaying the inevitable?

Are the Japanese chasing gas-blown horsepower, or is the bulk of their
creative energies and financial resources being spent on future tech? And is
this yet another indication of the Big Three being so far behind the curve?

Ford sold 160,412 Mustangs in 2005 and 165,762 in 2006. How does that
compare to Chevrolet's Corvette success? Camaro? Challenger?

How many cars constitutes a &quot;success&quot;?

Indeed.

I think they'll have to do both.

No, but I think it's an esoteric point.  The real reason I don't think
we'll ever see an AWD Mustang is because it would require an entirely
new platform.  It's just way too expensive to do.

I agree fully.  But the current Mustang platform simply can't handle
AWD.  The weight increase alone would kill the car.

&gt; I'm confused.

&gt; All of these horsepower advances are great, and I really hope that
&gt; Ford beats our horse to death.

&gt; But aren't we at cross-purposes here?

&gt; The surge to Go Green is approaching critical mass. Aside from the
&gt; whole global warming thing (whether you believe it to be fact or not),
&gt; the political climate alone dictates that we pursue other energy
&gt; sources. Every year, there will be stronger forces trying to wean us
&gt; off of oil-based internal combustion engines. The clock is ticking.

All basically true.  But IMO it has nothing at all to do with
pony/muscle/sports cars.

I'm confident that gasoline-only-powered automobiles will be with us for
the remainder of our lives (dwight, I'm talking about _our_ lives seeing
that we're both on the &quot;downslope&quot;).

In today's paper there was an article about how GM is developing an
engine that approaches the efficiency level of a diesel but runs on
gasoline.  So makers are still tinkering with the good ol' internal

I think the Japanese are moving towards future tech, but in the
meantime, they still need to sell cars today.  I'll gamble that at least
one Japanese maker comes out with a RWD high-hp car to compete with the
Mustang sooner or later.  Keep an eye on Hyundai.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A while back I wrote about the possibility of the Corvette, Viper

&gt;&gt;&gt; our beloved Cobra switching from strictly RWD to all-wheel drive.
The
&gt;&gt;&gt; thinking was with all three cars now offering 500+, further
increases
&gt;&gt;&gt; in horsepower to stay ahead of the competition would become a joke.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Wow, my new Cobra/Viper/Vette, with its extra 50 horsepower this
&gt;&gt;&gt; year, can now roast the tires 25 feet longer than Brand X's car.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I guess the Corvette engineers have been thinking much the
same
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing for a while now.  Seems the next generation Corvette -- due
out
&gt;&gt;&gt; sometime around 2010 -- is this close &gt;&lt; to getting the green light
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; become a mid-engine sports car.  I figured AWD would be easier and
&gt;&gt;&gt; cheaper, but word has it the Corvette's Chief wants the next-
&gt;&gt;&gt; generation Vette to be a take-no-prisoners World beater.  And word
has
&gt;&gt;&gt; it the spy pics are absolutely stunning. Price for this gorgeous
next
&gt;&gt;&gt; generation techno-marvel: about the cost of today's convertible
&gt;&gt;&gt; Vette.  If GM can deliver, they will, no doubt, turn the sports car
&gt;&gt;&gt; world upside down.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which brings us back to our Cobra.  It's obvious Ford has recently
--
&gt;&gt;&gt; since the 2000 R model -- been trying to keep the Cobra in the
Vette's
&gt;&gt;&gt; rear view, if not its side-view mirrors.  But now with the Vette
&gt;&gt;&gt; likely to get the advantage/traction of a mid-engine design, what is
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ford's well-muscled pony supposed to do to keep up if adding more
HP/
&gt;&gt;&gt; tire smoke isn't enough?  Obviously, it wouldn't make sense to
design
&gt;&gt;&gt; a mid-engine Mustang, but will Ford offer a Cobra with AWD?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Comments?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Patrick

&gt;&gt; Comparing a Mustang to a Corvette is absurd.

&gt;&gt; Ford will never offer an AWD Mustang in my driving lifetime.  It goes
&gt;&gt; against the Mustang's philosophy.  Not to mention the fact that they
&gt;&gt; couldn't afford to build it anyway..

&gt; I agree.  Ford can't polish a $25k V-8 RWD muscle car into an AWD
&gt; Corvette chaser.  If Ford wants a Corvette challenger then they need
to
&gt; design a dedicated chassis and drive train.... just like GM does.

&gt; I don't believe GM is going to make the next generation of Vette a mid
&gt; engine car as it has excellent weight distribution as is.  I think
there
&gt; is a good chance it will remain RWD.  Next gen Vettes have been more
an
&gt; improvement on the last one than a complete redesign.  I don't think
the
&gt; next one will be that radical a change (i.e AWD) from the current one.

Bing-freakin'-go.  Agreed 1000%.

GM has nothing to worry about as far as the Corvette is concerned.  It
just keeps getting better and better, and GM will always make it.  It's
one of the cornerstones of the company.

The Corvette has its own niche that has little competition.  Even from
the foreign import segment.  There is a long line of loyal Corvette fans
just waiting for a little better car than the one they own.  It is a
ritual for them to get the new gen Vette every four years or so.  In a
way they aren't that different from Mustang buyers in that they get a
tremendous amount of performance relative to the dollars they spend.

GM has been using the Z06 as the teaser for what the next variant of the
base Corvette will become.  The next Vette will be a tad under 500 hp
and take much of the technology from the current Z06.  Especially the
drive train.  It will likely receive INCREMENTAL improvements across the
board.  IMO, when they moved the transmission to the rear of the car it
gave the Vette the ability to achieve world class handling performance
even without AWD.

OTOH, the Mustang has always been a poor man's performance car.  That
means it is low tech and easy to tweak by the owner.  As an old boss of
mine used to say &quot;You can polish a turd only so much and even then it
will still smell like shit&quot;.  The same goes for the Mustang.  The only
thing Ford needs to do is option it well, offer an affordable GT
package, give it some good looks and keep the after market performance
parts going strong.  They do this and the car will sell.

Why is the current Mustang selling well with an ancient solid axle
design in a world of IRS cars?  IMO, it is because Mustang buyers want
one, or more of those four things I just mentioned.  Mustang owners are
looking to split wood..... not carve pieces of fine art.

Economics 101:

For a manufacturer, a car is a success when enough are sold to make a
profit, after paying the design costs, and the factory startup and
qualification costs.

If the profit margin is thin (e.g., Ford Focus), lots of cars must be
sold; if the margin is fat (e.g., Bentley Continental GT Speed), very
few cars need be sold.

And, of course, many cars use parts from other cars (e.g., the Ford
Mustang Shelby GT500); so, the incremental design/startup/qual costs
are relatively small.

&gt; one, or more of those four things I just mentioned.  Mustang owners
are
&gt; looking to split wood..... not carve pieces of fine art.

Another direct hit.  Well said, Michael.

Don't know what your problem is there, Frank, but you've got at least a
few.

If you seriously thought that units sold is the sole mark of success,
then you are either a high school kid or you are one naive sonofabitch.
If neither is true, then you're just a friggin' troll.

Get off your ass and look up the facts for yourself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A while back I wrote about the possibility of the Corvette, Viper and
&gt;&gt;&gt; our beloved Cobra switching from strictly RWD to all-wheel drive.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The thinking was with all three cars now offering 500+, further
&gt;&gt;&gt; increases in horsepower to stay ahead of the competition would become
&gt;&gt;&gt; a joke. &quot;Wow, my new Cobra/Viper/Vette, with its extra 50 horsepower
&gt;&gt;&gt; this year, can now roast the tires 25 feet longer than Brand X's
&gt;&gt;&gt; car.&quot; Well, I guess the Corvette engineers have been thinking much
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same thing for a while now.  Seems the next generation Corvette
&gt;&gt;&gt; -- due out sometime around 2010 -- is this close &gt;&lt; to getting the
&gt;&gt;&gt; green light to become a mid-engine sports car.  I figured AWD would
&gt;&gt;&gt; be easier and cheaper, but word has it the Corvette's Chief wants the
&gt;&gt;&gt; next- generation Vette to be a take-no-prisoners World beater.  And
&gt;&gt;&gt; word has it the spy pics are absolutely stunning. Price for this
&gt;&gt;&gt; gorgeous next generation techno-marvel: about the cost of today's
&gt;&gt;&gt; convertible Vette.  If GM can deliver, they will, no doubt, turn the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sports car world upside down.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which brings us back to our Cobra.  It's obvious Ford has recently --
&gt;&gt;&gt; since the 2000 R model -- been trying to keep the Cobra in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Vette's rear view, if not its side-view mirrors.  But now with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Vette likely to get the advantage/traction of a mid-engine design,
&gt;&gt;&gt; what is Ford's well-muscled pony supposed to do to keep up if adding
&gt;&gt;&gt; more HP/ tire smoke isn't enough?  Obviously, it wouldn't make sense
&gt;&gt;&gt; to design a mid-engine Mustang, but will Ford offer a Cobra with AWD?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Comments?

&gt;&gt; What a lot of us that grew up with the original Mustangs really need
&gt;&gt; now - is a 4 door Mustang!  A grocery getting, kid (or grandkid)
&gt;&gt; picker-upper with a V-8 deep throated rumble and nostalgia!  Done
&gt;&gt; right, it'll sell very nicely, but done wrong, it'll flop big time.

&gt; John, the car you're referring to is available now at your Dodge dealer.
&gt; It's called a Charger.

Or is the Magnum?  Yeah, I've seen those.  They are nice, but no thanks.  If
Ford is smart, they'll Magnumize the Mustang.

Corvette Goes Midengine? Not So Fast

August 23, 2007
Edmunds.com AutoObserver
Posted by Michelle Krebs at 7:12 AM

Here we go again. Parts suppliers to automotive blog sites are atwitter
about the prospects for a midengine Corvette. Indeed, that discussion --
which has occurred repeatedly since the 1960s -- is heating up yet again
inside General Motors.

Automotive Web site AutoExtremist.com &lt; http://www.autoextremist.com/ &gt;
claims to have inside information that the C7 going midengine is nearly
a done deal; a final decision is due next month, it insists.

Not so, say sources. Such a move is a long way from being a done deal
with the C7 not due until mid next decade, and a decision to go
midengine is not imminent. In the meantime, numerous enhancements will
be made to the C6 Corvette before the C7 arrives, around 2013.

Proponents argue a midengine Corvette would allow them to do things with
the sports car that can't be done with a front-engine version, not the
least of which is boost acceleration. Such a car would go a long way
toward establishing GM's global technology leadership, a top goal for
the automaker, they contend.

But is a fast, high-horsepower midengine Corvette the right symbol for
GM's global technology leadership? Might not be, in this era of more
stringent fuel-economy efforts.

Cost is another major question mark, however. Proponents insist a
midengine Corvette can be accomplished at a cost minimally more than the
cost of the current model, so it would sell at the equivalent of about
$66,000, claims sources talking to AutoExtremist. The Web site adds that
a more luxurious version would replace the Cadillac XLR, which now
shares the Corvette's C6 platform, and would feature a unique motor,
retractable hardtop and different styling.

Other sources and outside analysts don't buy that a Corvette, with its
hallmark for affordability, can go midengine without a significant cost
bump that would have to be passed onto the customer -- or eaten by GM,
not a desirable situation in light of the automaker's struggle to stay
in the black.

Forecasting firm, Global Insight
&lt; http://myinsight.globalinsight.com/servlet/cats?documentID=2114500&amp;se...; &gt;
says GM's move to a midengine Corvette is risky business.

&quot;To replace the Corvette with a halo sports car nearly half again as
expensive as the current model would be an extremely risky move,&quot; Global
Insight said in its daily analysis of news today. &quot;A halo vehicle for GM
could be a good move internationally, but to so dramatically change what
has become an American icon would seriously risk alienating the market
that the vehicle already has in North America, by far its largest market.&quot;

Global Insight warns GM risks the current price advantage Corvette has
over comparably performing competitor sports cars. &quot;But to move the
model into the more rarefied territory occupied by the Porsche 911 and
Audi R8 would move it out of the affordability range presently enjoyed
by its current owners.&quot;

Edmunds' own Jeremy Anwyl, CEO, agrees: &quot;Corvettes should be
front-engine and Porsche should not be a sport-utility. Some things just
shouldn't change, like Classic Coke.&quot;

Actually Ford hasn't sold a GT40 since the 60's I think you are speaking
about the NEW Ford GT Super Car...

The GT is similar to the original Ford GT40 cars, but bigger, wider, and
three inches taller than the original 40 inches (1.02 m) - as a result of
which, a potential name for the car was the GT43. Three production prototype
cars were shown in 2003 as part of Ford's centenary, and delivery of the
production Ford GT began in the fall of 2004

A British company, Safir Engineering, who made continuation GT40s in the
1980s owned the GT40 trademark at that time, and when they completed
production, they sold the excess parts, tooling, design, and trademark to a
small Ohio company called Safir GT40 Spares. Safir GT40 Spares licensed the
use of the GT40 trademark to Ford for the initial 2002 show car, but when
Ford decided to make the production vehicle, negotiations between the two
failed, and as a result the new Ford GT does not wear the badge GT40. It is
rumored that Safir GT40 Spares asked $40 million dollars for the rights, but
this has never been verified. The partners at Safir GT40 Spares state they
have correspondence from Ford declining Safir's $8 million offer. Early cars
from the 1960s were simply named &quot;Ford GT&quot;. The name &quot;GT40&quot; was the name of
Ford's project to prepare the cars for the international endurance racing
circuit, and the quest to win the 24 Hours of LeMans. The first 12 prototype
vehicles carried serial numbers GT-101 through GT-112. The &quot;production&quot;
began and the subsequent cars, the MkI, MkIIs, MkIIIs, and MkVs, numbered
GT40-P-1000 through GT40-P-1145, were officially &quot;GT40s&quot;. The name of Ford's
project, and the serial numbers, thus show the story that &quot;GT40&quot; was only
the car's nickname to be false.

They are not necessarily looking to create more power.  What they're
doing is creating efficiency.  And efficiency creates more power.  The
problem is the more efficient they design things the more we consumers
want -- more features, more safety and yes, more speed.

The Japanese have increased horsepower levels as much as the Big
3s.

Here's the latest Big-3 score card (using boxing analogies):

GM has, for the most part, got their shit together and are climbing up
the rankings.  They just can't pack an audience into the arena.  The
problem is everyone still thinks they're the punch-drunk company of
old.  But in fact, they've trimmed down and muscled up quite a bit.
Look for them to be a real contender soon.

Ford is reeling on the ropes.  However, they at least now have an eye
on some of the incoming punches, so there's still hope they can
weather the barrage.  If they can land a few punches soon, they may
buy themselves time to get their legs back.  They're hoping they can
starting putting a few punches together to start winning a some
rounds.

Chrysler in the past has shown flashes of talent and tons of heart,
but rarely can stay inside the ring long enough to win a fight.  Just
when they start winning a few rounds they get hit by a huge bomb and
go flying through the ropes.  The latest bomb was a crappy manager who
left them flailing away without any direction, and then not wanting to
see the outcome of the fight, left the arena.  Their new manager who
just took over looks like a clueless high-school gym teacher.  Barring
a Hail Mary miracle punch they'll soon take a horrific beating.  We
may even see a stoppage.

&gt;&gt; Seeing that the Mustang is Ford's [only?] recent success story, the
&gt;&gt; fact there's a slew of competition -- from the new Camaro, Challenger
&gt;&gt; and a RWD Hyundai -- about to make their market debut, and an upcoming
&gt;&gt; generation of new buyers who like cutting-edge technology, I think it
&gt;&gt; would be wise for them to keep all their &quot;options on the table&quot; if
&gt;&gt; they want to hold onto their market share.

&gt;&gt; Patrick

&gt; I'm confused.

&gt; All of these horsepower advances are great, and I really hope that Ford
&gt; beats our horse to death.

&gt; But aren't we at cross-purposes here?

&gt; The surge to Go Green is approaching critical mass. Aside from the whole
&gt; global warming thing (whether you believe it to be fact or not), the
&gt; political climate alone dictates that we pursue other energy sources. Every
&gt; year, there will be stronger forces trying to wean us off of oil-based
&gt; internal combustion engines. The clock is ticking.

&gt; How is it that developmental engineers have been given the go-ahead to spend
&gt; untold millions of budgetary dollars to create ever-more-powerful versions
&gt; of a transportation device that may soon go the way of the dinosaurs? Isn't
&gt; anyone looking forward, or is this a purposely shortsighted project to make
&gt; immediate profit, while delaying the inevitable?

The only thing that will move us off our dependency of oil is economics.
All this global warming, go green babble is a money grab by Algore and
a bunch of scientists from both sides.  The price of oil is going to
remain high indefinitely due to the explosive growth of several
underdeveloped countries like China, India, Indonesia etc.  China alone
is going to be gobbling up crude oil at a rate even we here in the USA
can't match.  The oil producers can't suck oil out of the ground fast
enough to feed two 800 lb. energy gorillas.

If oil prices go as high as I think it will in the next 10-15 years the
consumer will create the demand for alternatives which, IMO, will first
be hybrids and then full electrics with a small gas engine to charge
and/or feed the batteries in a pinch.  Once they get batteries that can
recharge to more than 80% of capacity in less than five minutes the
majority of the cars driven in the country will be all electric.

The great thing is that this doesn't mean the death of performance cars
at all.  In fact, I think it will usher in an era of performance the
likes of which we can't imagine.  We will have all wheel drive torque
monsters that will have super low centers of gravity that will scare the
hell out of us as we mash the throttle to the floor and enter curves at
insane speeds and we live to tell about it.

BTW, the Japanese (i.e. Toyota) are embracing hybrids because they are
the test beds for the all electric cars they know are coming.  They just
don't know when the price of gas is going to push the consumer over the
edge to go for all electric vehicles.  The fact we are accepting hybrids
is the indication to them that the change will eventually occur but they
know they have to move slow for now.  Toyota is the smartest of the
bunch because they are putting serious development resources into hybrid
technology.  Their next round of hybrids are going to be designed from
the ground up as hybrids and not a retrofit of a gasoline only based
vehicle.  If the other automakers don't do the same Toyota will own the
hybrid market for a long time to come.

From what I've seen in general it's asses and idiots that use it.
There's really only one reason I can think of to be 100% totally
