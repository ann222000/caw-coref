Here is a running commentary on a prophecy of Daniel concerning the
Antichrist - one remarkably similar to what we are reading in our
daily newspapers:

Daniel 8:1-17  In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I Daniel,
had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me.  In my
vision I saw in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam (located
in Iraq just east of Babylon)...I looked up and there before me was a
ram with two horns (Saddam Hussein), and the horns were long (Saddam
once had the fourth most powerful army in the world). One of the horns
was longer than the others but grew up later (his forces were divided
into the regular armed forces and the Republican army.  The Republican
army was formed later and eventually grew into seven elite divisions
that became the backbone of his forces.).  I watched the ram as he
charged towards the west, the north and the south. (Saddam was causing
a lot of trouble in the Middle East - sparring with Israel in the
west, then brutally suppressing the Kurds in the north, and finally
invading and occupying Kuwait in the south, which triggered the first
Gulf War.) No animal could stand up to him, and none could rescue from
his power.  He did as he pleased and became great. (By 1990, Iraq had
become the greatest military power in the region, and was on the verge
of acquiring nuclear capability.  This would have enabled him to
overrun Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the Persian Gulf oil states.)

As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn
came from the west (United States military forces under President
George HW Bush), crossing the whole earth without touching the ground
(US forces were either shipped across water or airlifted in from
across the globe).  He came towards the two-horned ram (Saddam's
forces) they had seen standing by the canal (the straights of Shatt Al
Arab, an important oil-producing region shared by Iraq and Kuwait, and
crucial in the conflict.  Kuwait was later found to have been slant
drilling for Iraqi oil.)  and charged at him in great rage. I saw him
attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two
horns. (the air war that proceeded ground action in the Gulf War
shattered and demoralized the dug-in Iraqi forces, both the regular
army and the Republican Guard.) The ram was powerless to stand against
him, the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him, and none
could rescue the ram from his power. (US ground forces then rolled
right over Saddam's forces.  Other Arab nations in the region were
either neutral in the conflict or openly supportive of US military
intervention.)  The goat became very great, but at the height of his
power his large horn was broken off. (After the War American prestige
and power in the region soared.  Yet in spite of world-wide acclaim
and a job approval rate of over 90%, George WH Bush nevertheless lost
the presidency a year later, and was no longer commander-in-chief of
the most powerful military machine the world had ever seen.) And in
its place four prominent horns grew up towards the four winds of
heaven. (Having retired from politics, his power and reputation was
now in the hands of his four sons: George, John (aka &quot;Jeb&quot;), Neil &amp;
Marvin.  It was up to them to redeem the family's name and power.)
Out of one of them (that is, from one of his four sons) came another
horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the
east and toward the Beautiful Land. (George W Bush started out failing
at everything, and spent most of his adult life drinking.  He had no
power to speak of - his horn was very small.  Then at the age of 48 he
was suddenly elected governor of the southern state of Texas.  He
gained more power when he was appointed to the presidency, and moved
east to Washington DC to assume the office.  Now he's sent American
forces off to conquer or 'democratize' the Middle East, also known in
the Bible as 'beautiful land'.) It grew until it reached the host of
heaven and it threw some of the starry hosts down to earth and
trampled on them. (Here we have a picture of an arrogant leader whose
great power has gone completely to his head.  He challenges the
authority of heaven by pretending to be on a divine mission to attack
other nations.) It set itself up as great as the Prince of the host;
(With 'Operation Infinite Justice', Bush compared his bloody justice
to that of a patient and merciful God) it took away the place of daily
sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was brought low.
(The United States invaded and destroyed numerous Mosques in the
pursuit of fundamentalist Moslem 'terrorists'.  It has also proclaimed
that any Islamic state offering them sanctuary will be attacked.).
The heavenly host was delivered up (many innocent civilians are being
slaughtered by American forces - over 650,000 at last count , an Iraqi
casualty rate that's the same as killing about 8 million Americans, or
the entire population of New York City - and delivered up as angels
before God), and the little horn (George W Bush) raised itself
impiously against the regular offering and cast true religion to the
ground; (though he claims to be a Christian, and a man of peace
fighting against forces of evil, just the opposite is the case.  He is
a violent and profane man consumed by greed and a lust for power; he
persecutes and murders the poor to increase the profits of the rich,
and trades blood for oil.) It succeeded in all he did, and truth was
thrown to the ground (for a short time his 'war on terrorism' was very
successful. He won every military battle and announced 'mission
accomplished'.  He fooled a lot of people with lies about WMDs, while
pretending he's fighting for freedom and democracy. ).

Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him,
&quot;How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled? -.....&quot; He said
to me, &quot;It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary
will be reconsecrated.&quot;  (The 'war on terrorism' will last about six
and a half years, causing an unbelievable amount death and
destruction.  Then Bush/the Antichrist will be removed by God, and
peace restored to the Middle East)....While I, Daniel, was watching
the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who
looked like a man. (Jesus, the son of God)  And I heard a man's voice
calling, &quot;Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.&quot; As he
came near the place I was standing, I was terrified and fell
prostrate. &quot;Son of man,&quot; he said to me, &quot;understand that the vision
concerns the time of the end.&quot; (This vision is about the last days -
the time of the Apocalypse and the battle of Armageddon.)
