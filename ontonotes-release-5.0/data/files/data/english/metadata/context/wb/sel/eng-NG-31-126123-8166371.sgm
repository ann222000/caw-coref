If you tap any fret two notes come out. Some of them harmonize with each other,
although not always well. If you put a pickup in your fingerboard to pick up the
&quot;back&quot; note and work at the technique you might be the one to come up with
something entirely new....the next step beyond Stanley Jordan or Michael Hedges.

Zappa, for one, experimented with piezo pickups in the neck heel so its not as
crazy as it sounds - that it, if you consider all of Zappa's ideas &quot;sane&quot;.

Use a hair scrunchie fitted over the headstock and on top of the strings to
act as a damper. You can slide it back over the nut when you need to play
open strings.

The 12th fret will give you an octave harmonic.
That's probably what you are hearing.
Just like the 7th Fret will give you a harmonic of a fifth.

Peace,

Vic

He's hearing the open string between the 11th fret and the nut, I imagine.
The scrunchie answer was good ... I've seen mutes that attach to the neck at
the nut, but don't know where to find them. Â  I wonder if the problem is
audible when he's plugged in.
