Get a Linux Live CD, and run that. It doesn't install, you run it right off
the CD. Play around with everything. If you mess something up, just reboot,
and it's back to default. Another suggested option if you have enough HD
space, dual-boot Windows and Linux. You will need something like Partition
Magic, or I suggest Gparted Live CD to resize your HD partitions to make
room for Linux.

We have a good list of reference websites on our LUG homepage:

And welcome to the LUG.

have a look on distrowatch.com for livecd's, as jeremiah said, they
are the best if you haven't got a clue about linux and don't want ruin
your current install!
there is a live cd for every need, i would check out something like
pclinuxos, mint or mepis/simplymepis, if you have never run linux
before!
just play with it for a while and kick your windoze off, whenever your
ready! ;-) only took me 2 weeks, to kill my windoze!
&quot;...and they lived happily ever after!&quot; :)
enjoy linux and, do a lot of reading on the web, there's loads  of
stuff out for starters!

Welcome!

This is a great LUG to belong to if you want to belong where you will
be treated well and get good help. I will say this, though, there is
no better way to learn Linux, most of the time, than to simply dig in
and figure it out. That comes with frustration and great fun- it's all
worth it. As another poster said, start with a LiveCD distro, such as
Ubuntu, and check it out that way. And like everyone else, the distro
you decide on now may not be the one you are running in a few months
or years. I run Ubuntu (and its off-shoots), DSL (Damn Small Linux),
SuSE 10.1 and Xandros 4. But I started off in 1997 or -98 with
Slackware and Caldera OpenLinux 2.2. Slackware was a bad distro for a
noob to cut his teeth on... I also have to use Windows XP at work for
some stuff, which is rather unfortunate but a way of life for most of
us.

DSL, Ubuntu, KNOPPIX and several others offer LiveCDs that you can
find in magazines or download and burn. You can find them easily by
googling the distro name and by checking on various advocacy and
support sites. I recommend an easier one to start with, like Ubuntu.
That's a personal recommendation from practical experience. Others
here will have different recommendations. However, try not to read too
much into recommendations...go with what you are comfortable with.
Doing a lot or reading on the sites already recommended here would be
very helpful.

Once again, welcome! This is a great LUG.

If you should decide on a version of Ubuntu see:-

http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Unofficial_Ubuntu_6.10_.28Edg...
http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Feisty

(according to version installed - 6.04, 6.10 or 7.04 respectively).

Welcome to the group. I'm agreeing with Jeremiah, go check out a load of
live CDs of different distros to choose which one you like best, and then we
can help you through installing the real thing.

I'd like to suggest you to use mandriva 2007, if just wanna kick start linux
life.
This suggestion worked for few friends of mine, all of them started with
mandriva 2007 and within few months they moved to ubuntu, debian and other
distros.

The reason behind suggesting mandriva is, as you are a XP user, you'll find
similarities between them (xp and mandriva). That will help a lot. Moreover,
mandriva supports almost all drivers automatically. AND, it has all audio
and video codes + flash plugins installed. So, you have to installed nothing
just to check out how it looks.

By the way, mandriva installation is easier than windows installation.

Well, what others have suggested is helpful as well, check out some live CDs
to see which one suits you best.
Still there's a question which live cd to choose!

Note: I am not a mandriva fan. I use ubuntu and Mac OS X on my PC.

All recent linux installers for the big distros are much easier than
Windows... the only reason that people think differently is because they buy
their PCs with Windows pre-installed, or they have tried installing linux
pre-2000, or perhaps gentoo or slack.

... plus the Windows environment tends to spoon-feed and nag the user quite
a lot. With Linux, you'd always always have to practice and use plain common
sense, plus no nagging will happen unless you do something way nasty (like
executing commands and installing things without reading its documentations
and readmes ahead of time), without an inkling of an idea of what you are
actually doing.

Now, THIS I agree with. I don't see Linux big distros as easier than
Windows. Ppl think differently becoz:
they have a slightly unusual hardware config
they don't have a minimal RAM
they have an older box, with a slow cpu, or less RAM
they have little hdd space
they want to do a dual boot, and have some circumstance close to the
above

Sorry, but &quot;common sense&quot; ain't common, and it is not to be expected.
There are a lot of choices, and some can destroy the install process.

My recommendation: go slow. Live CD? ya, give it a try. Pay attention
to your limits - cpu, RAM, HDD. And, good luck.
