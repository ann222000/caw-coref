I think the answer Cary Tennis gave to this question is gentle and peaceful
and quite commendable.  A nice, mainstream example.

That is one great article, Karen, thanks!

I love this, for any circumstances:

&quot;So. Take a deep breath. A posture of utter humility before the
mystery and grandeur of life is appropriate. And be cool. It's going
to be OK.&quot;

I'm going to put a link to that Q&amp;A on my sex page

Hi. I've never posted before. I've been reading for a
little over a few weeks now and have been very
inspired. I have a 3 year old and a 7 month old. So
some of what is discussed here isn't yet applicable.
But I'm gaining insight into how I envision our lives
years to come.

I do have a question that may be slightly unrelated to
&quot;unschooling&quot; specifically, but I don't think it's
unrelated to the philosophy of unschooling as it
pertains to everyday family life.

I'm currently tandem nursing both of my sons. Due to
unexpected and unfortunate circumstances (my own), I'm
also pumping breastmilk, storing it for future use. In
January, I will be undergoing a cancer treatment and
will be forced to leave my home for up to 2 weeks
because I will be radioactive and unsafe to be near my
children. Once I'm home, I won't be able to resume
nursing for at least 56 days following the treatment.
So I'm trying to amass enough milk to get my 7 month
old (who will be 11 months old when this happens)
through his first birthday on breastmilk.

I had always envisioned allowing my children to
self-wean. And it saddens me that my 3 year old will
most likely wean because of this forced 2 month
separation. And it utterly breaks my heart that my 7
month old may only nurse for 11 months.

I will continue to pump all throughout the 2 months in
the hopes of maintaining my supply so that I can
resume nursing once it's safe. But I am resigned to
the possibility that my 3 year old may forget how to
latch after that and that my 7 month old may reject
nursing after so long.....

So, on to my question. My 3 year old and I have a very
happy and relaxed relationship. However, the one
source of tension at this point is food - his not
wanting to eat. Prior to my cancer diagnoses and the
pumping that I'm now doing, I never forced my son to
eat. If he wanted to nurse instead of eating solids,
that was fine. But I've been pumping since September.
And let me tell you that nursing 2 children (one of
which is a very active 3 year old!) and pumping is not
only physically exhausting, it's also quite
uncomfortable. I'm sore. I'm tired. And I'm SORE.

I have recently found myself telling my son, &quot;You can
either eat this food while you continue to
play/read/paint/whatever, or we can stop what we're
doing and I will put you in the high chair to eat.&quot;
The high chair is a threat. He doesn't like it. (I
don't blame him.) I hate when I do this. I feel awful.
It feels wrong.

Let me back track by saying that I always indulge his
desire to nurse when I can see that it's for comfort
or emotional support (he wants to nap, he hurts
himself, etc.). But when he's just plain hungry and
refuses to eat but demands to nurse, my nipples just
scream out &quot;UNCLE!&quot; and I find myself making the high
chair threat.

So, how would you deal with this situation? I feel so
bad doing it. I never did it before the damn pumping.
And if we make it to re-nurse after our 2 month
separation, I won't do it again. But during this time
of pumping, it's just too much....I would really love
some insight.

Thanks.

I'm sorry you are going through this.

My dd is about to turn 8 and I am so ready for her to wean. However she
shows no sign of  being ready to do so. And I don't even have any milk
coming anymore! I tell her when it hurts (she inadvertently bites) or if I
am really too tired to do it for long.

I want to just clarify my understanding here - when you say &quot;not wanting to
eat&quot; you mean he wants to nurse rather than eat other foods. So I am
imputing that the real tension is not that you fear he is going to starve
himself, but that you are worried about how he will react when you simply
can't allow him to nurse for his own safety. He may well feel betrayed and
angry and want to express these strong feelings.

I suspect that you will feel better if you shift your mindset to the idea of
supporting his process of mourning the nursing relationship, and not keep
seeing this as a food and eating issue. I think it is worth sharing your
honest feelings of sadness (over not being able to nurse for a while) with
him, and that it need not necessarily be forever.

One of the things that I found was that I was becoming reluctant to hug and
cuddle Jayn as much, because everytime I put my arms around her she would
want to nurse. I think this made her even more demanding of nursing. So now
I just try to hug and cuddle her even more. I sit with her and stroke her
feet a lot. I also try to be physically comfortable for the actual nursing,
including removing my bra or lying down.

I would just stop doing this right now. You are turning eating into a power
struggle. This strategy is probably not going to stop him asking to nurse -
it might in fact be the reverse if he feels that he can exert power by
demanding nursing. It is better to give him his own power back.

Put out the plate of food that you know he likes where he is (and before he
asks, if you can predict his hunger or just at regular intervals). Don't
worry. He is very unlikely starve himself in a home with food freely
available. In the past I have found that Jayn is very good at going to the
food back and just helping herself when we are at the park. What about
packing your insulated food or picnic bag and carrying it to the room in the
house where you are playing? I have done this at night when Jayn is wanting
to stay up, but I know I want to sleep and not have to get up and fetch her
more food.

Just as an aside, how are you sharing the information of your illness and
planned treatments with your son? This must be very hard.
Good luck with the treatments.

If the negatives outweigh the positives, that's important.  I bribed
Kirby to stop weaning when he turned three, because it was stressing
and hurting me.  Marty was six months old.  I still feel deep
emotions about it but I still remember the physical pain and the near-
revulsion when Kirby would latch on as opposed to Marty.  Other
tandem nursing moms weren't experiencing that.

Some moms just stall off a bit with the older kids--they still say
yes, but &quot;yes in a bit,&quot; and offer other food and drink.  Sometimes
that's all the kid really needed, was a &quot;yes&quot; and something to drink
and the mom smile.

If what you're doing is keeping you from saying yes and smiling, and
you're finding yourself saying no and gritting your teeth, put that
into your considerations.

The radioactivity sounds the worst to me--having to avoid the kids
altogether.  Good luck with that, and maybe every time you think a
sad or negative thing (like ages of weaning, or pain or threats of
high chairs) think a positive thing too (either in addition to or
instead of the negative thing).

No. You're correct.  I don't fear that he will starve.

It's two-fold. Yes, there's what you say. I feel
horrible for him when this finally happens. It's going
to be so horrible twice. The first horrible part will
be my actual physical absence for 2 weeks immediately
following the treatment. The second horrible part will
be not being able to nurse after I come home for 2
full months.

During my pregnancy with my 7 month old I had 2
surgeries to remove the cancer. I was in the hospital
for 2 days the first time and a full week the second
time. Both times, my son nursed like crazy when I got
back! I cannot imagine how badly he will take it when
I come home in January after 2 weeks and tell him he
cannot nurse. I am so sad about that.

The other issue is I'm just too tired and sore to
nurse him sometimes. And when eating actual solid food
will fix his hunger, I get irritated that he won't
just eat and let me have a break. I know he's hungry
because he tells me. He says he has a &quot;rumbly in his
tumbly&quot; (like Pooh Bear). Other times he says he has a
boo boo or he's sleepy or whatever. So it's clear to
me when it's hunger or something else that is causing
him to want to nurse. When it's hunger, and with me
being so sore, I just wish he would eat food.

He hasn't even realized yet what's happening. He sees
me pumping and says, &quot;Mommy, don't do that. I want to
nurse.&quot; And I tell him I have to pump to save up milk
for later.

Other times (not while pumping) I have started telling
him that Mommy will be going away for a little while.
He gets tears in his eyes and says, &quot;No, Mommy. Don't
go. I'm missing you.&quot; Ugh. It breaks my heart.

Yes. I find myself standing up a lot. As soon as I

I have done this. And he will take a bite or two while
he's playing. But as soon as I sit down, he will stop
eating and immediately ask to &quot;nurse and read&quot; or
&quot;nurse and tell me a story, Mommy&quot; or whatever. I know
he's hungry. That's why I struggle with this. I feel
resentful, too, that he doesn't care that I'm sore.
(I've told him I'm sore and he will give me a little
break and then come back minutes later.) (Although,
being a rational person, I do realize that he's 3. And
it's not that he doesn't care that I'm sore. In his
time frame, giving me 20 seconds to take a break is a
huge gesture! He doesn't want me to be sore. He kisses
me and tells me he'll make it all better. It's
actually very sweet. Which makes me feel worse for
begrudging his desire to nurse all the time....)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Just as an aside, how are you sharing the
&gt; information of your illness and
&gt; planned treatments with your son? This must be very

Yes. This is hard. It's the worst thing I've ever had
to do in my life. They originally wanted me to do this
treatment when my 7 month old was 2 weeks old. But I
put it off. Yes. It's important for me not to die. But
I just can't see how I could have left my 2 week old
for 2 weeks....We co-sleep. And I don't think I will
be able to co-sleep for the 56 days....I just don't
see how that would have ever worked.

We haven't really started preparing my son yet. Well,
aside from my telling him that Mommy will be going
away in a couple of months. Until today, my
endocrinologist kept dragging his feet in giving me
the referral for the nuclear medicine doctor. I
finally have an appointment on Monday to speak with
the new doctor. We're hoping to schedule this for
January but I haven't confirmed it yet. Monday I will
know for sure. We wanted to have all of the details in
place before we started preparing my son.....

My husband had a brilliant stroke of genius though. I
recently started taking Judo classes at night. 3
nights a week I go to class from 7:30PM to 9:15PM. My
son goes to bed somewhere between 8 and 9PM. So my
husband wanted to be able to get some sort of routine
with my children around bedtime so that when I'm
finally gone in January, the bedtime issue won't be so
hard on them. I currently nurse both boys to sleep.
But now my husband is getting them to sleep 3 nights a
week. We're hoping, come January, they will be so used
to my husband getting them to sleep that they will
adjust more easily to my absence at night.
Sigh.....teaching my babies not to need me so much
really sucks.

Diana,
Facing cancer takes all of your bravery and guts.  So rudely and
unfairly, it has also cut into your mothering ideals.  As a mom who
nursed 4 kids, I implore you to look past this loss of nursing time.
I know you are grieving for what you and the boys should have had, but
your sons are NOT going to suffer as much as you fear.  Your baby is
going to enjoy his bottle, and he is still going to be comforted by
your presence.  Your breasts are not your measure as a mom.  I know
you already know that, but I also remember how vital I thought my
breasts were when my sons were tiny.
It's amazing how much more of you they need (beyond the womb,
beyond the breast... beyond the physical helping hand).  It sounds so
trite, but your love IS going to be enough, Diana.

Sounds like it is time to start preparing him.  A couple of months can
seem like an eternity to a small child.  Maybe get him his own special
calendar where he can mark off days and mark (with stickers or
something) special events coming up that he can look forward to?  Maybe
a watch or clock of his own, too, so he can see time measured.  With a
calendar, you could color the days that you'll be gone a certain color,
then the days that you can't breastfeed once you are home another color,
then he could visually see them getting smaller as he marks them off
right before bed?

Just a thought.  Good luck and stay positive!

My situation is not quite the same as yours.

However, I did tandem nurse when dds were infant and not quite 3yo (now 12 and 14), and  I had breast cancer in 2004, followed by radiation. I would be happy to chat with you off-list and offer any support that I can. nellebe ... @charter.net

I had mixed feelings while tandem nursing. I had LOTS of feelings while undergoing treatment for cancer--as a mother. It is very scary to have cancer and dependent children at the same time.

We haven't done anything like this yet because I still
don't have the exact dates. But on Monday, everything
will be scheduled. This is a fabulous idea. I had
thought about doing something like this for my 2 week
absence. But it hadn't occurred to me to do it for all
3 milestones (leading up to my absence, my absence,
and no nursing). Thanks for this idea. I already told
my husband about it and he's happy too.

It doesn't sound silly to me. I know what you mean, having extended
nursed both of my kids who are now 16 &amp; almost 10.

It's been nearly five years since my nursing career ended and I'll
second what someone before me said, it'll be okay down the road. The
thought of nursing ending now seems very momentous now - it IS
momentous now, but three, four, five years from now what will be most
important is having mommy around and the nursing will be a pleasant
memory.

I had a thought while I was reading Lisa's suggestions.  Can you set
up a computer camera where you will be recuperating from the
radiation treatment away from your kids so that they can see and talk
to you every day?  Kind of like you see soldiers doing with their
families sometimes?  Just a thought.

Yes, beautiful response from Cary Tennis.  As someone who came out
later in life, I can hardly even imagine what it would have been liked
to have a parent that said it didn't matter if you're gay, I love you
no matter what.  It was a different time, mainstream culture was so
different.  My daughter (who has two moms) says she feels a little
pressure to be a lesbian.  We've had alot of discussions about
it . . . I've had to reassure her in the other direction;  it's really
OK if you are attracted to men, I love and support you no matter what.

Your husband's idea is a good one.

Your &quot;finally gone&quot; isn't a great choice of words, and I suspect it
reflects a lot of not-great-choice of words swirling in your head.

Don't think of it as &quot;teaching.&quot;  It's wrong, anyway.  You can't

I don't think Lisa meant to mark off days until you leave.  Bad idea.

I think she meant a real calendar, where he could mark of cool things
coming up in his life, not count down to scary things.

So how do I prepare him for the day that I pack my

without warning worse than giving him a heads up? I
don't know how to do this other than by mentioning it
here and there.

Sometimes with really young kids, mentioning it here and there is
scarier to them--the time frame isn't clear in their heads, and being
reminded of this looming thing can just upset them. That was true
with my oldest in any case. For him, if something like that was
coming up, I would wait and tell him about it maybe a couple days in
advance, and do something like make a calendar to check off days
until we were together again.

I know yours are younger than mine, but I have been separated from
mine twice, against my will. First, when my oldest son was born, I
was discharged from the hospital before he was. I was bereft! But my
partner said, &quot;It's just for a day or two, as soon as it's over, it
will seem like nothing.&quot; And he was right.

I really held onto that in August when I was suddenly separated from
both my older kids for 2 weeks. We crossed state lines to take
custody of a baby girl we're adopting, and the state of Michigan
wouldn't accept our home study--we couldn't legally take the baby
across state lines. Gah! After one week away from home, my partner
took the boys home, so he could work, so we didn't have to pay hotels
and restaurants for four people, and because they were tired of being
gone. The baby and I were in Chicago for 2 more weeks while we got
the mess sorted out and finally got permission to come home.

If you had asked me in July whether my kids, especially my 3-year-
old, could have been without me for two weeks without it being
traumatic, I'd have said no way--it had only been shortly before that
that I was away from Carl overnight for the first time. But they did
fine. Some things were hard--my introverted 6-year-old got tired of
people coming to the house all the time to hang out with them while
their dad was working, for instance. They were happy to see me when I
got home, and stuck close to me for a couple of days, but, again,
almost as soon as it was over, it faded into the distant past in our
minds.

I just want to offer you that during your difficult time--that even
if it's hard, you will all come together and heal from it. I'll be
thinking of you.

Sandra has made the point that counting down to a scary event (like your
leaving) might be a traumatic thing, but what if you shifted your
paradigm a little with that the same way you have your other attitudes?
(I am in awe, by the way, of how you are managing to turn some very
negative circumstances into What if instead of counting down until you
leave, you counted down until he got his &quot;big boy time&quot; with his dad (or
two weeks with whatever caregiver he is going to have -- I don't
remember who is watching and loving him for that two weeks).  Could his
caregiver (dad or whoever) plan some fun events during that time like
camping in the living room or a trip to the zoo or the library or
something fun, free, and relatively stress-free (dad will also be
concerned and scared and even grieving a little) so that this two weeks
becomes less focussed on your absence and more focussed on your son's
relationship with whoever is staying with him?

And what if you looked at it *yourself* as not a separation, but two
weeks to heal, and really took some time to nurture yourself?  Made it
like a spa atmosphere, or brought great (and even junk) books you had a
fancy for, or did lots of meditating or journalling or watched all the
chick flicks (or action flicks) you wanted or whatever recharges your
batteries?  I recognize your attention span might be an issue (friends I
have say it can be really hard to focus immediately after radiation),
but some soothing music and a chance to do all the things you can't do
easily sans children (like decide for yourself when you are going to go
to bed or wake up) and all your favorite foods might help a little and
provide a different view for you as well.  Two weeks to scrapbook (or do
whatever you have wished you had more time for) ... two weeks to try oil
painting or pottery if that's what you've always wanted.

Anyway.  I'll keep you in my thoughts and in my prayers, if that's okay
with you.

How can a three year old &quot;prepare&quot;?

You're worried about him being unhappy, but it sounds like you're
making him and yourself unhappy now as if to build up to greater
unhappiness later.

It sounds like fear and negativity, instead of a buildup of happy,
joyful moments to remember.

Hi, I've never posted before either, been reading for a couple weeks. Your
post just moved me to reply. What a wonderful mom you are. I know exactly
how you feel, I nursed all 6 of my children, all but one till they were two
or older (he was a biter!) If you had only nursed for 6 weeks, it is so good
for your baby. You have given your kids such a wonderful start and you
should feel great about that.  Even a little bit is the best that you can do
for your baby.
As long as your 3 year old is healthy, I wouldn't worry...they do eat
eventually!! Maybe he will be like mine, who always ate so much better for
someone else, the babysitter or my mom.
I wish you the best. I know how exhausting all the nursing can be. But you
have to take care of yourself first and foremost.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hi. I've never posted before. I've been reading for a
&gt; little over a few weeks now and have been very
&gt; inspired. I have a 3 year old and a 7 month old. So
&gt; some of what is discussed here isn't yet applicable.
&gt; But I'm gaining insight into how I envision our lives
&gt; years to come.

&gt; I do have a question that may be slightly unrelated to
&gt; &quot;unschooling&quot; specifically, but I don't think it's
&gt; unrelated to the philosophy of unschooling as it
&gt; pertains to everyday family life.

&gt; I'm currently tandem nursing both of my sons. Due to
&gt; unexpected and unfortunate circumstances (my own), I'm
&gt; also pumping breastmilk, storing it for future use. In
&gt; January, I will be undergoing a cancer treatment and
&gt; will be forced to leave my home for up to 2 weeks
&gt; because I will be radioactive and unsafe to be near my
&gt; children. Once I'm home, I won't be able to resume
&gt; nursing for at least 56 days following the treatment.
&gt; So I'm trying to amass enough milk to get my 7 month
&gt; old (who will be 11 months old when this happens)
&gt; through his first birthday on breastmilk.

&gt; I had always envisioned allowing my children to
&gt; self-wean. And it saddens me that my 3 year old will
&gt; most likely wean because of this forced 2 month
&gt; separation. And it utterly breaks my heart that my 7
&gt; month old may only nurse for 11 months.

&gt; I will continue to pump all throughout the 2 months in
&gt; the hopes of maintaining my supply so that I can
&gt; resume nursing once it's safe. But I am resigned to
&gt; the possibility that my 3 year old may forget how to
&gt; latch after that and that my 7 month old may reject
&gt; nursing after so long.....

&gt; So, on to my question. My 3 year old and I have a very
&gt; happy and relaxed relationship. However, the one
&gt; source of tension at this point is food - his not
&gt; wanting to eat. Prior to my cancer diagnoses and the
&gt; pumping that I'm now doing, I never forced my son to
&gt; eat. If he wanted to nurse instead of eating solids,
&gt; that was fine. But I've been pumping since September.
&gt; And let me tell you that nursing 2 children (one of
&gt; which is a very active 3 year old!) and pumping is not
&gt; only physically exhausting, it's also quite
&gt; uncomfortable. I'm sore. I'm tired. And I'm SORE.

&gt; I have recently found myself telling my son, &quot;You can
&gt; either eat this food while you continue to
&gt; play/read/paint/whatever, or we can stop what we're
&gt; doing and I will put you in the high chair to eat.&quot;
&gt; The high chair is a threat. He doesn't like it. (I
&gt; don't blame him.) I hate when I do this. I feel awful.
&gt; It feels wrong.

&gt; Let me back track by saying that I always indulge his
&gt; desire to nurse when I can see that it's for comfort
&gt; or emotional support (he wants to nap, he hurts
&gt; himself, etc.). But when he's just plain hungry and
&gt; refuses to eat but demands to nurse, my nipples just
&gt; scream out &quot;UNCLE!&quot; and I find myself making the high
&gt; chair threat.

&gt; So, how would you deal with this situation? I feel so
&gt; bad doing it. I never did it before the damn pumping.
&gt; And if we make it to re-nurse after our 2 month
&gt; separation, I won't do it again. But during this time
&gt; of pumping, it's just too much....I would really love
&gt; some insight.

&gt; Thanks.

A horrible situation for you Diana, and I hope everything goes as well
as possible for you, your husband and your baby boys.

I had to wean my DD early (13 months) because of a breast lump which
needed to be removed- the specialist wanted me to stop breastfeeding
when she was 3 months old, but I couldn't do it.

I do know what you mean about nursing being so tied in to
parenting...but right now the important thing is to get you all
better :0)

There are still snuggles, and kisses, and so much more to remain
physically connected.

Is it possible to not mention the separation again until a day or two
before?  I know it feels dishonest, but every time you mention it
again your DS will be anxious again.  We have done this about
unpleasant stuff, and it works better (I think)...tell the child
initially, and answer any questions- say you are there to answer
questions if they think of anything...then leave it alone.

Far better to talk over scary scenarios and your fears and feelings
with your dh or very close friend.

Another great bit from Cary Tennis.  If you want to read it in context, you
can here: http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/col/tenn/2005/07/15/parental_help/

(Frankly -- as one who has no kids and so probably shouldn't talk -- I'm a
little troubled by the carrot-and-stick system of child-rearing: How can it
possibly prepare one for the real-world reward system, whose rules are
strange and random and require problem-solving ability of a whole 'nother
order? How does a kid, raised in such a way, interpret situations where
participants don't spell out their reward programs quite so explicitly? &quot;If
I lose five pounds, then can I have the job?&quot; &quot;What?&quot;)
