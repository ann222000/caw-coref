http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/07/28/ap3963438.html i  read the
car joyrider will be charged with the chopper pilot/reporter deaths!!
so effectively we have learned nothing from this accident!

-if i use my cell phone while driving from A to B that is deemed a
dangerous distraction to my driving, so following a pursuit while
trying to get the best camera pan &amp; commentary is not?
-competing tv channels 'dogfighting' over populated cities &amp; schools
(choppers fell into Steele Indian School Park - luckily it was summer)
-is there any form of highway traffic police for the air?maybe if they
start getting tickets for speeding &amp; erratic flying the news
companyies profits will start to drop
-maybe a satellite can start following news choppers and show us how
many regulations they break while following the joyriders on the
ground

finally the best way to reduce this type risky flying is to ban
transmission of chopper covered reality tv.

how many tragedies have to occur before something is done?

Tragedies of this type are uncommon, and yet you suggest banning part of GA in
order to &quot;do something&quot;?

More than have happened.  Nothing is going to be done.

And if a police car had crashed, the joyrider would have been charged
with that as well.

What knowledge do you have of helicopter operations that lead you to
believe that following a police pursuit is similar to driving while on
your cell phone?

Who said they 'dogfight', as far as I know, you are the only one to
have said that. On what do you base that opinion? What knowledge do
you have of these operations?

On what do you base your opinion that they were flying erratic or
speeding. I've not seen anyone suggest that other than you.

Yelling, 'let's ban it', concerning something you know nothing about
is a pretty typical reaction of the uneducated.

How arrogant and short-sighted can you get? I wonder how many people
died building the dams or other power plants so that you could listen
to rap music. How many died getting the lumber for your home? How many
people die in shipping accidents, or manufacturing accidents, or any
number of other accidents, so that you can sit on your butt at home
playing with your Wii in front of the idiot box?

People die for your entertainment all of the time. Deal with it.

The pilot's job is to fly the helicopter and coordinate with the other
helicopters. His concern is not getting the best 'pan &amp; commentary.'
These people concentrate on flying the aircraft. Your assertions are
offensive to pilots.

Dogfighting? They follow specific rules and the helicopter pilots were
talking to each other. Please, spare us the trite 'populated cities &amp;
schools' howling. It is not raining aluminum on schools, and you know
it.

Who appointed you to be king? The NTSB will determine if there was
speeding and erratic flying. They are far more competent at it than
you. However, it appears that everyone was following the flight rules.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; ground

You know they were breaking regulations? What regulations are you
saying that they broke?

The 'joyrider' trivializes what was actually going on. This fellow a
relative or close friend of yours? Well, he stole a truck, rammed a
police car in an attempt to kill the officer inside, then car-jacked
another vehicle and holed up in a home trying to take the family inside
as hostages. Maybe he would have had a warmer welcome at your house?

I think we learned that the helo crew should have a dedicated pilot
who does nothing other than piloting, a journalist who reports what he
is witnessing, and a cameraman.  Expecting the pilot to do a good job
of maintaining situational awareness while he's focused on the events
occurring on the ground and reporting it over the radio is
unreasonable.

It appears to work in the LA and the sky is full of news helo's.

Better pilots, an agreed upon coordination system?
