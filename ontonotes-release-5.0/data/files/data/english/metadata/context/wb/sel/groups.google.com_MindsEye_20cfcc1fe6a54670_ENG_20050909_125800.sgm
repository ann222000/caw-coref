This is one of the best explanations of why God allows pain and
suffering that I have seen.

It's an explanation other people will understand.

A man went to a barbershop to have his hair cut and his beard trimmed.

As the barber began to work, they began to have a good conversation.

They talked about so many things and various subjects.

When they eventually touched on the subject of God, the barber said: &quot;I
don't believe that God exists.&quot;

&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; asked the customer.

&quot;Well, you just have to go out in the street to realize that God doesn't
exist. Tell me, if God exists, would there be so many sick people?
Would there be abandoned children? If God existed, there would be
neither suffering nor pain. I can't imagine a loving a God who would
allow all of these things.&quot;

The customer thought for a moment, but didn't respond because he didn't
want to start an argument. The barber finished his job and the customer
left the shop. Just after he left the barbershop, he saw a man in the
street with long, stringy, dirty hair and an untrimmed beard. He looked
dirty and unkempt!

The customer turned back and entered the barber shop again and he said
to the barber: &quot;You know what? Barbers do not exist.&quot;

&quot;How can you say that?&quot; asked the surprised barber. &quot;I am here, and I am
a barber and I just worked on you!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; the customer exclaimed. &quot;Barbers don't exist because if they did,
there would be no people with dirty long hair and untrimmed beards, like
that man outside.&quot;

&quot;Ah, but barbers DO exist! What happens is, people do not come to me.&quot;

&quot;Exactly!&quot; affirmed the customer. &quot;That's the point! God, too, DOES
exist! What happens, is, people don't go to Him and do not look for
Him. That's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world.&quot;

Of course! How could I have been so stupid. The reason babies are
tortured, and children are raped and murdered is because they don't
come to God. Or is it because I don't come to God. Am I, a
non-believer, responsible for the suffering of the innocent?

Omni benevolent might mean something very different to what I think it
means but does the design rule 'those that don't believe will be
subjected to the most unimaginable suffering' seem all-good to you?
What about the hypothetical &quot;If Adam should sin then all of his
descendents shall inherit his guilt.&quot;
Sunny, I'm sure that your post was in the spirit of good intentions
but it makes no sense to me at all. The perennial problem of evil was
the reason (other than lack of evidence) that I rejected the idea of
the christian God when I was young. If you can somehow reconcile the
idea of omnibenevolence with suffering and Hell I may reconsider. What
say you?

Although your presentation was un-necessarily harsh, I agree with your
precept. An Omni-Benevolent God would preside over Utopia. One look
around tells us this is not the case.

Omni-Benovolence is not the essence of the problem of evil. The
essence of the problem of evil is the combination of omnibenevolence
and omnipotence. You are all assuming that God is omnipotent, but it
is not an analytic truth that he is. It's a truth that is derived from
the assumption that God creates ex nihilo, or in otherwords out of
nothing. If you reject that assumption and assume that God works
within a pre-existing framework of intellgent beings, and creates from
eternally existing material, then it would follow that God is limited,
finite, and not omnipotent. In this case, the traditional problem of
evil would no longer be a problem.

"/> Very thought-provoking as usual. Thanks for the post. Can you walk me
through this a bit more though? Maybe it is in the archives but as
long as we're on the subject I have two questions... basically why is
rejecting the assumption necessary, and is rejecting it sufficient to
solving the problem of evil.

[on the necessary condition]
Is your argument on omnipotence similar to that on omniscience, i.e.
not knowing the unknowable (freely made decisions) does not count
against omniscience? Or in this case not being able to do the
impossible? To stay with choices for example, not being able to
undo/change the choice made by a murderer as it was freely made? To
this extent the limitation exists only in the sense of being limited by
the rules of logic. I am curious why the assumption that God creates
ex nihilo must be rejected in this case. Once beings were created and
the rules of logic put in place, would God not be just as limited? Or
does this make God not benevolent?

(I suspect you are saying God is limited by more than just logic, but
there's only so much I can cram into one post and expect an answer!
Natually I would be interested in what this means and what you base
this on however, if you can get to it.)

[on the sufficient condition]
Secondly, to follow through with your argument, is rejecting the
assumption a sufficient condition to solve the problem of evil? I'm
not entirely sure what you mean by 'eternally existing material', but
even assuming this was all he had to work with couldn't God create many
things to prevent some evil without having to restrict free will? Ok
clumsy example... but something like changing the shape of the earth to
make a wall between a gun that fires and it's target. Technically the
shooter still has free will to choose to attempt murder, he is
prevented from accomplishing it after the fact. How does rejecting the
assumption limit God from doing something like this? If God is not
limited in this way, wouldn't the problem of evil still be there?

(a) agree with Chris, heavy sarcasm at the expense of a &quot;innocent&quot; (yet
logically bankrupt) analogy for the existence of God could be
considered extreme {which in this case, might be a case of the pot
calling the kettle black, if anyone had seen some of my posts on the
forum I previously posted in} (btw, I am required to use cliches, like
the preceding one, so they don't die out from lack of use)

(b) agree with Kierkecraig's well written response (God, am I suck-up
or what??) on the real issue {I really want to show emphasis/importance
of the last two terms} with the &quot;question of evil&quot;. It doesn't
eliminate the possibility of a supreme diety, just points out
inconguities with the characteristics most people assume this diety
would have. It's MUCH more ominous to consider the ramifications of God
IS omnipotent, however not necessarily ominbenevolent. From J.L.
Mackie: {I should be able to put his quote in italics, damn text
editor!!!) &quot;In its simplest form the problem is this: God is
omnipotent; God is wholly good; and yet evil exists. There seems to be
some contradiction between these three proposistions, so that if any
two were true the third would be false.&quot; Clearly, no one is happy if
&quot;the odd man out&quot; was: God is wholly good. He makes the rules, he says
what's fair, it's lot of fun to have him there {I also find a need to
paraphrase lyrics from old rock songs}. You don't hear much about that
possibility, rather chilling to contemplate {Whatever DID happen to
those pesky dinosaurs?? God: &quot;I got tired of them!&quot;). But I digress,
the point (you knew I had a point, right??) is just as the Ontological
or Cosmological Arguments don't prove the existence of God, the
question of evil does't disprove his (to whom it may concern: please
get over the use of the masculine pronoun in reference to God. I only
used it once!!) existence.

Wow, is this a great forum or what?? {More sucking-up, since I'm
new}.....

Apologies to those who think my point a little harsh, but I think that
sometimes this is the only way to get certain people to question what
they are spewing to the masses. Admittedly the double barreled
sarcastic approach is perhaps not the best way to encourage debate, and
perhaps not in the spirit of this group.

The problem of evil, as has been pointed out, is not an argument
against the existence of a God, but an argument that seeks to show a
contradiction in a certain definition of God. That being Omnipotence
and Omnibenevolence. I'll bet my grandma that this is at least part of
Sunny's definition. Along with all-just and all-merciful. Omniscient
and free. The creator of everything e.t.c. e.t.c. If it were admitted
that, for example, God is powerless to stop such suffering then there
would be no problem. But as the opening post starts with &quot;why God
allows pain and suffering&quot; this would imply that this particular God is
deemed to be, at the least, free to dis-allow it. Not necessarily
omnipotent but at least powerful enough to stop it or restrict it in
some way. So the 'problem of evil' argument in this case is still
appropriate. And the explanation 'because people don't seek him' isn't
really an explanation. It's a causal explanation to a question that
seeks a purposive explanation.

To tell you the truth this kind of thing makes my blood boil, and I
find it insulting to the intelligence of the people for which it was
intended. I think the question 'why does god allow suffering' is
incredibly important, as it's often asked by the very people who suffer
the worst, and the explanations are rarely given with any evidence of
empathy at all. A friend of mine left her church and abandoned her
faith because her daughter, after five years of painful chemotherapy,
died from MRSA. In my experience, all the people I've known who've
turned away from Christianity in particular, have done so because of
this. It's simpler to conclude that there's probably no god looking out
for us than to decide there is a God but perhaps lacking in one of the
traditional attributes. But I admit this is no reason to abandon all
netiquette. Also I've a strange knack of writing things that sound
fairly tame in my head but come across like I'm ranting. I'll try to be
more careful in future. Once again, apologies.

No problem. We do try to be as respectful as possible of differing
belief sets, although every now and then a conversation may become a
bit acerbic (cough, Ian, cough). ;)

Faith is a funny thing. It can make people ignore logical and rational
thought if those things conflict with the belief set which holds it.
It can also provide extraordinary drive and motivation, enhance the
survival instinct, increase the body's natural healing ability, and
provide comfort and even joy in situations which should merit neither.

I have a lot of respect for true faith, whenever I see it. Perhaps
that is due to the fact I have none of my own. It doesn't take faith
for me to see my God. I believe my perception is rational, logical,
and inline with Quantum Mechanics (and String/Unified Field Theory) as
we understand them.

God Does Exist - why does God allow suffering and evil.

Interesting topic and also an explosive one at best. I can only add my
point of view based on personal experience. I have suffered multiple
personal loss and also have a disease that while once considered
terminal is now managed with drugs.

Most people that are part of formalised religions tend to be overly
romantic about God, at least the God of the new testament (a rather
quiet god and not at all like the nasty one that hung out in the old).
The way I see it is that without suffering and pain how do we
understand love and joy? I subscribe to process theology in some part,
all our experiences including joy and pain drive us forward in
evolution, and in our spiritual growth. When we experience loss and
pain we can develop empathy and compassion for our fellow humans as
well at all living creatures and even our planet.

Quantum Mechanics and String theory seem to point to intelligent design
and to me reinforce the notion that theology and science are two faces
of the same coin. however, I would be reluctant to apply human
emotions to a creator, but I do wonder that if we don't have a higher
power to differ to on moral grounds then why would we give a fig if
another person got ill, died, was murdered, or just plain unhappy.

Yes, thank you! To assume a creator - pardon me here, Kierkecraig -
allows for only one &quot;side of the coin&quot; to exist, stunts growth. I
don't know if God is empathetic or scientific or
non-existant...(scratch that - I believe there is an overseeing,
coordinating presence)......but there simply cannot be good without the
bad. Here. Now. Suffering and evil are unpleasant to say the least
but from them often comes good change. All of nature works this way.
Forest fires started by lightening destroys acres of land and its
inhabitants, making room for new growth. It's sad and uncomfortable,
but it is also part of the fabric of existence. We have a pull toward
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;charity&quot; which as it is tends to promote growth - it unites
instead of divides. Cooperation of cells. But if you study, say,
bacteria - for example.....it &quot;evolves&quot;, to quote Moschie, through
overcoming opposition.

There are two different concepts being lumped into one here. The
'good' contrasted with suffering and pain, and the 'good' contrasted
with evil. Suffering and pain may be present without evil.
Theoretically we could live in a world where there was no evil, yet
people still got disease, homes were wiped out in natural disasters,
etc. The 'good' would exist in this world there if people helped each
other out, cared for each other, etc. (I hate to use etc there, but
you know what I mean!) Evil is a different beast.

Also I do not think we as humans tend towards the good, or evolve in
any moral sense. People are just as nasty today as they were thousands
of years ago, despite being more intelligent. Nor have we learned from
the lessons of history. Evolution in the scientific sense I agree with
(for the most part), but I'm not sure it applies here.

&quot;The way I see it is that without suffering and pain how do we
understand love and joy? &quot;

I'm not sure where this idea comes from but for me I personally can't
understand it at all. For example when I tuck my daughter in at night
and she tells me that she loves me, I don't think that experience would
be made any less authentic or powerful if I didn't know what it's like
not to be loved. I find it difficult to believe that I can't experience
true pleasure unless I've experienced true pain. I don't think
happiness or suffering has to be contrasted to anything at all for it
to be real. There are an unfortunate minority of people who live a
brief wretched existence, never experiencing real pleasure or happiness
at all. But I don't think that there lack of happy experiences makes
there suffering benign. I think for me to do so would be groundless and
a kind of injustice. I just can't see how, for example, there needs to
be some people who are born then neglected, forced into child
prostitution, then murdered, for others to be able to be born loved,
fulfill their dreams, and live happily ever after. There's something
heartless about saying &quot;well, if they didn't suffer we'd never know
happiness.&quot;
Also,(back to the thread topic) If a God were to be both all-good and
the all-powerful creator of everything, then it could have come up with
a way to experience joy and love without the need for suffering and
pain. In fact if you believe in heaven then this would show that it's
possible to have happiness without the contrast. Although that idea has
problems of its own.

I sympathise with Steve's anger and I understand his tirade against
Sunny -- after all I've done it myself a few times. I too find that
kind of dumbed down, romanticised, pseudo-theology completely
infuriating. The only thing I find more infuriating are the people who
lap it up as some kind of meaningful testimony and actually reinforce
their faith with it. It's precisely things like what Sunny posted that
drove me away from the church. There's just something plain disturbing
about people being uplifted by such fluffy bunny triteness. I would
contest their testimonies as false; based on ignorance, self-delusion,
misinformation, and outright apostasy.

That said, if someone does want to believe a brand of fluffy bunny
apostasy then all power to them. However, posting such fluffy bunny
theology here to explain the senseless injustice and suffering in this
would is always going to rile people, especially in light of what is
happening right now in the world.

Chris says he as a lot of respect for true faith, and I can completely
understand that. I have found myself in awe of priests who are also
scientists. Invariably the brand of Christianity that they follow
would be unrecognisable to your average church-goer, but, still, at
the end of the day they have reconciled rationality, science, and
faith. I find them utterly intriguing. Most of us live with
contradictions in our lives, but to be pulled apart by two polar
opposites... that's fascinating. I can't help but think, however, that
at some point down one of the roads they made a huge mistake.

That God exsists is to me a question that has already been answered, of
course.

Why God allows evil is another thing. When we talk of evil what do we
mean? What is happing in the States at the moment in New Orleans, I'm
sure that there is evil going on there, but what? The hurricane was
that an example of evil?

No to my mind evil is what we humans do to each other. The fox that
steals the chicken is that evil? Naaaa The man than rapes a woman, now
that is evil,

Evil only comes from us humans. If God has given us free will and we
use that to do evil then that is us allowing evil surley?

The other point I wish to make is what constutes evil? We have to
agree that objective evil exsists before we can ask why God allows it.
Heh and I can't see that happing, anybody?

&gt; at some point down one of the roads they made a huge mistake.

"/> I think one of the biggest mistakes the church has made throughout
history is trying to have an answer for everything. If there is
something it can't explain or rationalize with current theology it just
says it is wrong. Like when Galileo showed that the Sun does not orbit
the earth the Roman Catholic church denounced him as a heretic.
Today's church leaders haven't learned anything either. If they would
just admit that science and religion are not opposites, and they don't
understand all of God's ways in regards to creation, they would do
themselves a service. As the church is made up of humans it is not any
slight on God to say that we don't understand something. It is sheer
hubris to think that God would reveal everything to us, even assuming
we are capable of understanding it.

Science (usually) doesn't misrepresent itself in this way. It doesn't
claim to have all the answers. Perhaps there is something inherent in
God or the way God creates that allows miracles. Science will probably
never advance far enough to say convincingly that what faith calls
miracles are impossible. To do so it would have to either prove there
is no God or it would have to fully understand the nature of God.

At the end of the day, there is a large pool of stuff we don't
understand. Scientists choose to chip at it from the edges, while
religion assumes God does understand it and has told us about the
important parts. They are not polar opposites, just different
approaches to seeking truth. There is no reason we cannot employ both.

Heh and I can't see that happing, anybody?

I don't see what's so hard about agreeing that evil exists as long as
we decide what evil is. If we define evil as some sort of real entity
that Christians call Satan then of course we are all going to disagree.
The easiest way to define what evil is by considering the most extreme
examples of evil. For example a little girl gets raped. Now some
philosophers in their ivory towers may try to argue that evil isn't
real but is merely an illusion, or some other explanation, but for
those of us who live life in the real world, we know that evil is real.
Evil is a general name we give to a set of actions that we consider
reprehensible. I wish I had time to expound upon this, but I'm at
lunch right now, and behind on my school work, so it will have to wait.
In the meantime, a good reading of Aristotle would help us all to sort
through such an issue. Nichomachaen Ethics, and the Catgories would be
two great places to start. Anyone up for starting a reading group on
these two works by Aristotle?

sigh......does no one here consider the possibility of a case where a
God exists but cannot allow or disallow good or evil or anything else
for that matter(note: i say &quot;cannot&quot; instead of &quot;will not&quot;, come to
that in a second....).
Firstly, we as mortal beings, always tend to impart a sort of human
quality to the picture of God that is painted in our hearts or minds. I
don't believe that God would punish ANYBODY.... God CANNOT be
attributed with a quality of seeking vengeance against those who
violate his commandments or prophecies or anything of that sort.
Second, I believe that we cannot impart a personality EVEN IN PART to
such a being. Backtracking step-by-step, as most of us have been told
at some pre-teen time, to convince us of a God, by seeking out the
creation or the beginning of the universe. Yes, there obviously seems
to be some power or force that led to that creation or beginning. It is
further believed that initially there was just energy before the
present day universe began to evolve and shed its cocoon. But what if
we think of time prior to that. Where do you suppose that all that
energy conveniently gathered from? Forget &quot;from&quot;, how was that energy
brought into being?(sorry for the inappropriate choice of words, but
I'm sure you get my point) If we find an explanation to that (which I
sincerely doubt would happen, but it is a possibility), then the next
question arises that how did that certain thing happen to bring this
energy together. Then there is always the question of who made the
rules. Why did the energy have to amalgamate and coalesce into matter?
Why, if it did, did it happen only at extra-ordinarily high
temperatures and pressure? Why not at sub-zero temperatures? (Gets a
little monotonous, but helps getting the flow of it.)
To THAT extent. yes, we can call this infinitely recessive,
inexplicable and paradoxical source/creator of energy as God. But
imparting to it a character or personality may be a little far-fetched.
God does not love. God does not hate. God does not deal retribution on
those who deviate from the religious dogma. God does not stigmatize
those not ascribing to a particular faith. Because God created the
world, made the rules, and just maintains it. All else is our
&quot;perceived reality&quot;.
Our moral system is perceived, our faith is perceived, the world we
build around us, is, in short, a perceived reality.
Suffering, pain, evil, etc. are just random events in our world. What
we &quot;feel&quot;, or &quot;understand&quot; is what we WANT to perceive and nothing
short of it.
Infact, another possibilty that I have recently been considering, is
that we lead a multi-layered existence. That is to say, existing in
several planes of reality, and consciousness simultaneously. And our
every action in one plane, guides the course of our being in the other.
That way, the world that we perceive around us(PS: look me up a
synonymn for perceive) is that of a plane of consciousness that
coincides with all of the others. And this seemingly inexplicable
feeling of , say, love or emotions in general( including faith) are
merely stimulations of our existing forms in one or more of the other
planes of our being, which cannot have a causal effect on a physical
scale in this &quot;world&quot; of ours.... That would also exlpain why we bond
better with some people better than others. Perhaps because our
interactions with them coincide on more than one spiritual platform (if
you would want to call it that).

Hello, Architect,
actually, I posited just that. My concept of God as the sum totality
of all energy in the universe, and thus posessing the traits
attributed to God, does not in any way anthropomorphize the deity, and
in fact presents said deity as passive, if sentient at all.

Oh and also, straying a weeeee bit from the topic, assuming for a
moment that God does retribute, blah, blah, I find it absolutely absurd
to conclude that EVEN such a God would deal retribution or sign you up
for free eternal torture just because you dont ascribe to Christinaity,
or Hinduism, or any religion for that matter. I see no point in making
conversions. You are either good r you're not. Sure there are a lot of
shades of gray in between. You can put in the rainbow too for all I
care, but as long as you do what is said to be &quot;morally correct&quot;, why
would you be punished if you deviate from say, a purely Christian point
of view of God's existence? Also suppose that if you absolutely did not
believe in such a God, while (again for the time-been assuming) He
infact does exist in the context initiated by others in this topic. Yet
inspite of this utter lack of faith in him, you turn out to look after
the welfare of others, are peaceful, etc, etc.... would God then
personally hold it against you and deny you membership at his country
club? Or reject your application for salvation and a free spiritual
massage? Shed some light here....until then I shall grope for the
light-switch.

Not to discourage discussion, but Wikipedia has a good summary of the
issues raised by the Architect. (The ones he didn't tell Neo about,
lol)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_problem_of_Hell

This is probably the biggest problem with religion (or at least
Christianity) for most people, including myself. Personally, I do
think to some degree it is a choice, but not as cut and dry as it
sounds. If I had to pick a position from the wiki page I guess I would
be at the very bottom and think of Hell solely as separation from God
being punishment in itself. Hell's existence logically follows as a
result of free will, (otherwise we would not be free from God), but as
to its nature we don't really have a frame of reference to state it,
since we are never totally separated from God while we are on earth.

Anyone have a position that is not on the wiki? I'd be interested to
hear other solutions to the problem, since none of them seem dominant.

PS: you have not answered the question even remotely. Nice article on
the wiki though...doesn't really provide the answers, but helps explain
the question further in the right perspective.

I have not asked about the nature of Hell or how the suffering is meted
out to those unfortunate enough to land up in such a place if it
exists. To quote the wiki article:&quot;Naturally, the idea of Hell as a
choice depends on a strong account of free will (this seems to be your
stand). If a person's actions and choices are the products of genes and
environment, neither of which the person can control, Hell seems
profoundly unfair&quot;.
The point is that regardless of how it is dealt to us, the fact that
some of us don't even know of such a choice existing in our life, and
are hence unable to take a stand causing an eternal damnation to our
&quot;souls&quot; is my dominant contention. And why, if at all He exists, would
He allow such to happen. Please don't relate this to evil(note this
distinction that we are NOT talking about good &amp; bad here),
omni-benevolence and such. They get quite monotonous, and dont really
end up giving the answers. Of course, you still have free will
though....

You have hit the nail on the head. I understand completely what you
are saying, and no I don't have a great answer for you. However I do
think I remember reading something about Christ going to the halls of
death to liberate those who died before Christ lived. I mean if you
wanna talk unfair, being born before the saviour has to take the cake!
But I think they were not all damned and were given a chance to make
the choice after death, perhaps also based on how they lived, so that
suggests to me that the same may be true for people today who aren't
sufficiently exposed to the choice. Once again we don't have much
information on what happens after death, so I'm willing to give God the
benefit of the doubt on this one because of the rest of the message. I
don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water.

If anyone else knows the details of what I'm referring to or when
Christ was supposed to have done that (I think it was either after
crucifixion or after ascension), please share with us. I may be wrong
about it I just think I remember hearing that before.

Once again trust KC to get to the root of what I'm saying. Yes evil is
the name that WE give to actions that WE consider reprehensible. In
effect does this mean that evil has nowt to do with God, if we cannot
as The Architect alludes to push our human forms and feeling onto God
then does it not become a question of why do we allow evil in the
World? Heh but perhaps I'll save that for the up and coming ethics

Yes, man is evil... but God is more evil. Surely we're only emulating
the perfect example offered by our Heavenly father:

- God killed 50,070 people of Beth-shemesh because they had &quot;looked
into the ark of Jehovah&quot; (1Samuel 6:19-20)

- God strikes Uzzah down for being clumsy (2 Samuel 6:3-7 NAB)

- God commands the sons of sinner to be murdered (Isaiah 14:21)

- God's mercy expires, he will kill children (Hosea 9:11)

- God kills the first-born of Egypt and &quot;there was not a single house
where someone had not died&quot; (Exodus 12:29-30)

- God will unleash wild animals to tear us to pieces (Leviticus 26:21-22)

- Children to be killed and women raped by God's command (Isaiah 13:15-18)

- God saves Sampson from standing trial for 30 murders and arson by
allowing him to kill 1,000 more men (Judges 15:14-15)

- God commands his people to &quot;kill men and women, children and
infants, oxen and sheep, camels and asses&quot; (1 Samuel 15:2-3)

- God will curse us if we do not kill (Jeremiah 48:10)

- God promises more killing and no mercy &quot;I will make Mount Seir
utterly desolate, killing off all who try to escape and any who
return. I will fill your mountains with the dead. Your hills, your
valleys, and your streams will be filled with people slaughtered by
the sword. I will make you desolate forever. Your cities will never
be rebuilt. Then you will know that I am the LORD.&quot; (Ezekiel 35:7-9)

- The command of God comes, kill your family, friends and neighbours
(Exodus 32:26-29

- Kill the followers of other religions (Numbers 25:1-9)

the bible contains very little of Gods own message to us, and very much
of mankinds attempts to control us.

there examples of Gods evil.

In many of those examples God is quoted directly, &quot;and God said&quot; etc.

&quot; It's no good arguing against Christianity to a non
Christian, and agaist Islam to a non Muslim&quot;

So why dont we argue about religion in general. I dont think any of
them can claim that they were infact started by the supposed creator.
Jesus is commonly referred to as the founder of christianity. I doubt
if he ever said, &quot;Thou shalt be a christian and salvation will be thine
and thou who does not accept mine faith will be damned in the eternal
fire&quot;. The whole concept of christianity, hinduism, sikhism, Islam were
never initiated by the supposed founders.
And as lee mentioned, most o the scriptures were written by those who
were the disciples or the followers of the said founders. Why then is
so much importance given to these scriptures? Why are they regarded
with so much reverity?
Neither am I a christian, neither do I have anything against the
Christian faith in specific, but will use it because it is the easiest
example to cite. What exactly is it with the new and old testament. Who
gave the mortals here on Earth, commoners like you and me, to dictate
what is regarded as the word of God, and how it is interpreted. Because
the question of interpretation of the bible is, I am made to believe,
haranguing the Christian society and changes faster than a chameleon
can change its colour.
None...I repeat NONE of them, including Christ wanted to start a
separate faith. For what use is a faith that only helps segregate the
world further into individual chunks that snub each other at every
opportunity. The Hindu-Muslim rivalry, Jew-Christian tensions, and in
virtually every mixed society you have some problems or the other.
Would an all-knowing God have initiated a concept that would bring all
of this? Not possible...

Back to my original point. God is neither good, nor is he evil. It(NOT
He) is just the conglomeration of all energy and forces that led to the
creation of the world. And even after the next two millenia It will
still be as inexplicable as it is now.

You're absoultely right, lee, I should have been more specific (oh and
I'm a sikh too but somehow tend to regard myself as one without
religion). But i still stick to my point, &quot;MOST scriptures were never
written by those who were the disciples...&quot; ;)

and also the previous point that sikh was not started by its
creator...is very much true. It was Guru Gobing Singh...the last Guru
who actually gave sikhs their identity. History does not reveal Guru
Nanak to have ever wanted to establish a separate community. Although
he did explain the inadequacies presented by the then present-day norms
of the established hindu-islamic dominated society and its various
customs/practices and (NOTE HERE) merely attempted to reform their
faith. You may confirm on this if you wish. You'll agree that while
each guru called his heir or successors as the next Guru, they were in
fact nothing more than just disciples of their predecessors who
ultimately carried Nanaks heritage of wealth to the masses.
NOT ONE FOUNDER OF ANY RELIGION ACTUALLY WANTED TO ESTABLISH IT.

Hey then Sat sri akaal!

I have to say though I don't agree with you about Guru Nanak. As you
probably know according to Sikh dogma all ten guru's shared the same
jot(holy light) and are often refered to as the 2nd 3rd 10th, etc
Nanak.

It is historicaly accurate that Guru Nanak did institute sangat, and
langar. It is also correct that throughout the lifetime of the ten
Guru's the Sikh faith and way of life was born, evoulved, and
established. Guru Gobind Singh instuted our outward apperance, the
concept of miri piri, and the taking of Amrit for the Khalsa, but more
of Guru Nanaks writtings are in Guru Granth Sahinb than Guru Gobind
Singh.

If anything the history of Sikhi shows that what Guru Nanak started
grew with each new Guru, and Guru Gobind Singh was the last human Guru
who pulled it all together.
