I know many of you have been around long enough to have heard or
experienced the number of disparate opinions of Mr Hayes by other
members of the booj--in some cases they are former students, and more
recently, other Westerners in Japan.

I think An Shu has a distiguished record of ignoring these negative
comments publicly, but I often wonder why Soke or other Japanese Shihan
do not guide their students--some long-time and highly ranked--from
making comments such as this:

&quot;Hayes was never &quot;banned.&quot; The statement that was delivered via several
True Shihan was that &quot;those who trained with Mr. Hayes would not be
welcome at Hombu.&quot; Considering that the purpose of the statement, imho,
was to encourage Mr. Hayes to actually TRAIN with Soke, the statement
seems to have worked fairly well, wouldn't you agree? By your own
admission, Mr. Hayes did show up to training, and things were resolved
in some form. Whether Soke considers that one appearance as sufficient
for resolving everything has yet to be determined....&quot;

or this:

&quot;If you are going keep opening cans of worms, I'm more than willing to
bite. If you insist, I must say that I hope that Mr. Hayes' Taijutsu
continues to improve. I needn't have seen him in videos, I observed him
during his yearly Ninja Trips to Japan during my time there. At the
time, Mr. Hayes seemed to have been heading in directions that were
inconsistent with Soke's teachings, imho. Perhaps he has righted his
course in recent years. All of us continue to evolve. One could only
hope that it is in the correct direction.&quot;

and:

&quot;If Mr. Hayes wants to train with me, he's more than welcome. The
problem is that Mr. Hayes does NOT train with others. He's been invited
to train with people in the Dayton area, but never does. When he came
to Japan one year, I invited him to join me at Nagato Dojo. He didn't
feel he could learn anything from Mr. Nagato, and so I left it at that.

There are several &quot;elders&quot; to the Bujinkan who have earned the respect
of many people, including Sveneric Bogsater, Doron Navon, etc. Both
these individuals elicit nothing but good feelings with the mention of
their name, even though the latter's path has taken him away from the
Bujinkan.

In contrast, as numerous threads have shown, Mr. Hayes divides people.
There is not an &quot;agenda&quot; as you insist. This reaction is a result of
actions and statements that Mr. Hayes HIMSELF has perpetuated.&quot;

The above was from Ben Cole on Kutaki(
http://www.kutaki.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=1859&amp;forum...
)

Sorry for the length. And I hope no one is offended by me bringing
this topic up, but why are these comments allowed? Why does Soke, or
Mr Hayes, not address this directly with the individuals who keep
saying these things?

Just Curious,

Rob Erman

The answer is in Secrets from the Ninja Grandmaster, which you can buy
at SKHQuest.com.

:)

Ah, you were probably looking for a better answer than that. My guess -
and this is a guess only, since I can't speak for either An-Shu Hayes
or Hatsumi sensei, is that the way things have turned out is more or
less by design.

Why would you consciously and willingly allow or even create an
environment where lots of criticism, backstabbing, and petty sniping is
encouraged? Because you want to know who's the real deal and who isn't,
who you can trust with the deepest secrets, and who will misuse them.
The easiest way to test people, to test their moral and ethical
qualities, is to put them in a kind of sandbox and see what happens.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From time to time, give out pieces of information - some of it true,

"/> some of it not true. See where it spreads. See who immediately gets
hooked by their ego and starts spouting off that they've got all the
real secrets, and you should study just with them and no one else.
Hatsumi sensei has said publicly that he allows what happens not only
as a test of character for those people around him, but also as a test
for his best students - can they weather that level of criticism and
backstabbing and become stronger from the experience?

In a lot of ways, the way Hatsumi sensei manages the Bujinkan reminds
of the culinary world. In that world, if you lose control of your
personal secrets, other chefs, other competitors can not only misuse
your secrets, but blacken your name in the process, and I don't mean
cajun style with pepper. You jealously guard what you do, what you've
worked for decades to perfect, and may even intentionally mislead those
around you until you know they can be trusted, leaving the occasional
recipe on the counter with incorrect ingredients or quantities.

Now, let's say you have a bunch of competitors who do nothing but snipe
at you all day. Some don't even cook anything for themselves, they just
criticize you. If you spend all your time - heck, if you spend ANY of
your time answering their criticisms, what are you NOT doing? Cooking.
Studying. Perfecting and polishing your recipes and dishes.

The real proof of your mastery, the proof that you have got the goods,
that you are an authentic chef in your tradition, is how your food
tastes. Not what other people think of it or how much they talk about
you for good or ill, because if your work is good, you will naturally
find afficionados who enjoy it. The real results are on the plate, and
in the quality of the life you create for yourself.

Think about this - look at the results generated by An-Shu Hayes. Great
career doing what he loves full-time. Great family with kids that made
it to adulthood without being in jail or on drugs or any of the myriad
problems that children of celebrities often have. The results, like
those of a master chef, are in the life you create. Look around at the
critics, look around at the people whispering in hushed voices, and
look at the quality of not only their taijutsu, but their lives
overall.

My two cents.

I think Mr. Hayes summed it up appropriately in his interview. Most of the
rumors we hear about him are started out of petty jealousy and spite for his
achieving the many goals that he has.

WOW, well said, ever since I began training it has been like that,
especially in small countries like Belgium, it has been some time now
since I've seen a real dojo ( I mean with Tatami on the floor, I just
train with 2 friends at their house, we don't have the luck to have a
quest center every 100miles, as far as I know, we are the only ones
training in the An Shu Hayes lineage in Belgium), but still, I just
heard by a friend that lives in the USA that the word was going round
that I had become a black belt, given to me by An Shu Hayes in
person.....
what more proof do you need( I am not a black belt &quot;yet&quot;), everything
you hear is'nt neccesarly truth, altough those who spread the word
sometimes see it as the truth, (at least, they want to believe
it)because they have to keep up their &quot;image&quot; in front of their
students that keep asking questions, what better way to stop them from
asking.......

I always believe(d) that one would live HIS life first, before he would
try to change or dominate the life of somebody else, because it's
useless, you cannot change somebody unless (s)he want's to be changed,
you can tell as many lies as you want, the truth will prevail,
sometimes it takes a while before the truth comes back smacking at your
face, but when it does, it leaves a big impression

Johan (and all): Johan, I enjoyed your post. I spent some time this morning
at some link reading some discussion about an ³SKH controversy²... And it
was 7 pages of posturing. Sometimes I despair at how much of people¹s lives
(mine included) turns out to be just puffing about the barnyard, pecking
first for fear of nothing left to peck at!

I once was at a sanctuary where I saw a poster that really was
instructive... Started off something like... ³It topples governments and
kills marriages, causes pain... (etc).... It is gossip. If it isn¹t true and
isn¹t necessary, don¹t say it.²

I wonder what would happen in the world if people got so focused?

Ron,

I suspect Anshu is too busy training and training others to really even
bother with every johnny-come-lately hoping to raise his or her own personal
stature by taking him on.

I also suspect it goes on because people know that Anshu won't bother to
come &quot;spank&quot; them for behaving so poorly... and so with the distance
provided by the internet, and the knowledge that Anshu doesn't even bother
with them... they feel safe that they can spew things like this
unchallenged.

Now, to me... that sounds like cowardice... but I don't know these people,
so I wouldn't want to judge them.

Personally, when I see how some of these people rant and rave, and how Anshu
simply ignores them and continues along with his work, I'm reminded of a
leadership lesson taught the world by the ancient Egyptians: The true power
of the Pharaoh comes not from his ability to punish his enemies - but from
his ability to grant mercy to them.

I also think that its that kind of positive energy that makes Quest
Centers such great places to train.

Years ago when I was looking for a dojo to train at in Maine I checked
out several. When I would mention I was looking at several dojos in the
area they would always ask me which ones and start telling me why I
didn't want to train at those other places. The Quest center was the
first place they did not do that. They told me what was good about
their dojo and their style, not what was wrong with others. That alone
was enough for me to sign up and give them a try.

Why do they need to address these rumors? As long as you know who you are
and believe in what you do, what others say about you does not matter.
People who want to know you for who you are will take the time. Those that

Hi Chris

I have to put my two pence in sorry I'm from England so no cents.

I have watched this backstabbing since the 80's I would see these people running there mouths off all the time. It used to anger me when I was younger these people when they moved didn't even have knees and they were running there mouths off. Now a bit older and a little wiser I hold in my heart that one day they will find there way.

Until then there will always be people who are consumed by what I would see as negative wind &quot;I don't know what he's got, I don't understand it, I don't want to work hard on the basics to get it, but I want it too&quot;.

Please don't get angry as I used to, don't pity them just be enlightened warriors and hold in your heart that they will find there way one day. Until then endure and sometimes bite your lip and don't get pulled down to a lower level.

Respectfully

No worries about getting angry, Dale! I'm way too busy these days
anyway to get angry. It's still amusing, though, to see the same
&quot;arguments&quot; about Stephen K. Hayes crop up year after year, like
reruns of sorts.

And two pence is technically more than two cents, isn't it? Shouldn't
it be about 1p? (of course, prior to 1971, you could have just said 12
farthings, I suppose...)

Well put Chris,
The technique you describe is eons old and is pretty much security/intelligence 101. If you want to know who can and cannot keep a secret, plant a false one and see who spreads it.
I was reading Anshu's books years before I had the chance to move to the Dayton area and train, and once I was able to train there, I have never been dissapointed by either the quality of training, or the depth, intensity, and sincerity of Anshu's work. As a man is known by his enemys, he is also know by the quality of people he attracts, and I have met some pretty fine people at the Dayton Quest Center.
I suspect that Anshu's work reflects the true quality of Hatsumi Soke's intent.
And the funny part is that none of this is secret, being clearly revealed, as you state, in Secrets from of the Ninja Grandmaster.
I truely look forward to finishing my work here in Kosovo, and returning to Dayton to continue my training in one of the most fun, exciting, honest, and sincere programs I have encountered in over 30 years of living on the path of the Warrior.
To-Shin!

Ah, you were probably looking for a better answer than that. My guess -
and this is a guess only, since I can't speak for either An-Shu Hayes
or Hatsumi sensei, is that the way things have turned out is more or
less by design.

Why would you consciously and willingly allow or even create an
environment where lots of criticism, backstabbing, and petty sniping is
encouraged? Because you want to know who's the real deal and who isn't,
who you can trust with the deepest secrets, and who will misuse them.
The easiest way to test people, to test their moral and ethical
qualities, is to put them in a kind of sandbox and see what happens.
&gt;From time to time, give out pieces of information - some of it true,
some of it not true. See where it spreads. See who immediately gets
hooked by their ego and starts spouting off that they've got all the
real secrets, and you should study just with them and no one else.
Hatsumi sensei has said publicly that he allows what happens not only
as a test of character for those people around him, but also as a test
for his best students - can they weather that level of criticism and
backstabbing and become stronger from the experience?

In a lot of ways, the way Hatsumi sensei manages the Bujinkan reminds
of the culinary world. In that world, if you lose control of your
personal secrets, other chefs, other competitors can not only misuse
your secrets, but blacken your name in the process, and I don't mean
cajun style with pepper. You jealously guard what you do, what you've
worked for decades to perfect, and may even intentionally mislead those
around you until you know they can be trusted, leaving the occasional
recipe on the counter with incorrect ingredients or quantities.

Now, let's say you have a bunch of competitors who do nothing but snipe
at you all day. Some don't even cook anything for themselves, they just
criticize you. If you spend all your time - heck, if you spend ANY of
your time answering their criticisms, what are you NOT doing? Cooking.
Studying. Perfecting and polishing your recipes and dishes.

The real proof of your mastery, the proof that you have got the goods,
that you are an authentic chef in your tradition, is how your food
tastes. Not what other people think of it or how much they talk about
you for good or ill, because if your work is good, you will naturally
find afficionados who enjoy it. The real results are on the plate, and
in the quality of the life you create for yourself.

Think about this - look at the results generated by An-Shu Hayes. Great
career doing what he loves full-time. Great family with kids that made
it to adulthood without being in jail or on drugs or any of the myriad
problems that children of celebrities often have. The results, like
those of a master chef, are in the life you create. Look around at the
critics, look around at the people whispering in hushed voices, and
look at the quality of not only their taijutsu, but their lives
overall.

My two cents.

I like your analogy Chris. There's also a saying to the effect that &quot;the best revenge is living well&quot;. I trained in Dayton from about 1981 to 1984, and then in Tampa with Phil Legare for a couple of years. The rumours and political nonsense were alive back then and they'll be around for another 20 years, I didn't pay attention to the negativity then and I certainly don't bother with it now. What An Shu Hayes taught us was to try to seek the truth, to take from the training what we could, and to try to incorporate it into our lives in a positive way. I know that I certainly have benefited from the few years that I was involved in the training, there are many things that I've learned that I carry with me. Those who want to take the time to learn from it will find out for themselves who is sincere and who isn't. Although it is always good to stand back and take a good look at what you're getting involved in, and ask yourself a few questions about it, don't get bogged down with someone else's petty negativities. Focus on the training and what you can get out of it, and about what you can give in return.

Besides, like one of my other favourite little sayings goes: Never argue with an idiot. You won't get your point across anyway, and those who are watching won't be able to tell the difference.

I've been following the discussion (and many like it) on Kutaki as well.

Personally it's taught me some important lessons on civil online
discourse, and how one's presentation of themselves can severely effect
or undermine their argument (who quotes THEMSELVES in their sig-line
anyway?) While Mr. Cole will occasionally present interesting
historical tidbits, usually his snarky attitude makes me cringe.
Compare this to Mr. Martin's critical, yet genuine and civil, comments.
Clearly there was some significant falling-out between Mr. Hayes and a
number of now-senior Bujinkan instructors and practitioners, but that's
between them.

However, a number of (to me) troubling questions are occasionally arise:

Why do people like Doron Navon, Quintin Chambers, and Terry Dobson
never merit a mention in our discussion of the history of the art?
Their presence as students of Hatsumi-sensei in the 1960s is verifiable
via Ellis Amdur and the late Donn Draeger.

The only consistent request Soke makes of his shihan is that they train
regularly with him, imploring them to make it to Hombu at least once a
year. How often do the senior members of our organization make this
trip?

A friend of mine here at the NC Quest Center was in Tokyo on business
last summer, and dropped in on training both at Ayase and Hombu. Why
was he asked by George Ohashi-sensei (Hombu class administrator) not to
mention that he trained in the Quest organization?

Obviously I'm confident in the instruction of my teachers Mr. Broom and
Mr. Merritt, and the organizational guidance of Mr. Hayes, or else I
wouldn't have stuck with the training as long as I have. However, given
the amount of trust and faith one must turn over to their teachers in a
traditional martial art, the doubt caused by these questions cuts like
a knife.

Oh well, off to the dojo to burn off those doubts through the
undeniable truth of taijutsu!

I think Hatsumi-sensei is being let off a little too easy on this one.
The reason behind Hatsumi-sensei's silence in this matter is even more
basic than 'Intelligence 101', it's Human Nature 101. Look at who has
benefited, and continues to benefit, from the disharmony that is
generated by the rumours and inuendo? The answer may surprise some ....

Chris,

I don't believe that there is some nice benevolent plan at work here,
one that will reveal itself in the course of time, with the Good Guys
proved right and worthy, and the Bad Guys shown to be vile wretches.

Unfortunately I think Mr Hayes will continue to be vilified by various
quarters of the Bujinkan because Hatsumi-sensei choses to run his
organisation in a way that allows and promotes such behaviour.

With respect

Thank you for all of the replies and theories. I've pretty much
accepted what Chris said as the most likely reason in the past, but
Dean brings up a good point as well--and it is one I have also leaned
towards.

Kevin Casey asked what effect all this has on me. The obvious answer
is that it really has no direct effect, and any other effect would be
only what I allow to bother me.

I have alot of respect and admiration for Mr Hayes. I've come to a
point were I no longer feel compelled to defend him on bulletin boards
like e-budo or martialtalk--I've adamantly refused to post on Kutaki.
But it is still somewhat frustrating when the same falsehoods are
re-hashed over and over again. One example would be people disparaging
the golf-course training in Japan An Shu described in Ninja and their
secret fighting art--even japanese shihan have denied this ever
happened--yet Tanemura confirmed this story for John Lindsey. It's
difficult to not jump in and give people this type of information when
they operate off of half-truths and misinformation--even if chances are
they will ignore it...

Anyway, controversy aside, Mr Hayes has an awesome grasp of
movement--he seems to personify pure flow and intention. He also sets
a great example for healthy living. How this could possibly not be in
line with what they are doing in Japan is beyond me.

Thanks again,

Rob Erman

Interesting...

I have stayed quiet on this and on Kutaki because it really doesn't matter. You guys are doing the &quot;Hayes thing&quot; instead of the &quot;Hatsumi thing&quot;... it is your choice and I don't see why there is all of this controversy.

I will say though that it is growing old.

There are a lot of things you you all, as students of Mr Hayes, turn a blind eye to. That is understandable, and commendable... because if you decide to study Toshindo rather than the Bujinkan arts you should have faith in your instructor, but please don't think that the rest of us should put aside the facts due to your faith in your instructor.

There are reasons why I have been in Japan when Toshindo students show up and I see the utter look of disdain on Soke's face, and there are reasons why I think Soke is always pleased when Mr Hayes shows up to training.

I recommend you just let it go and train whatever Mr Hayes is teaching, and the rest of the Bujinkan will try and understand what Soke is teaching.

So I spent a bit of time going thru all the mail on this subject. Kind of
wonder why? The whole subject of Mr. Hayes being some kind of black sheep seems
silly. Like kids saying &quot;My Dad is bigger, stronger and cooler then your
dad!&quot;. Or working with someone who 'sucks up' to the boss all day. Then tries to
appear better then you, since they spend more time with the boss then you do.

Didn't Mr. Hayes just go to Japan and train/visit with Mr. Hatsumi? Kind
stops all the BS right there don't it????? No games, no big plans or anything
else. A man does not have to let another man in his house if that man is
unwelcome there!!!

Hey guys..
kutaki no mura.. post.. LOL..
I try to post things that are true and to the point to allow others to hear
my opinion as well on Hayes shihan.
I get trashed about it too.
But I don't care.. I'm been a blacksheep for well over 15 years now.
So what.
I was brain washed in the mid 80's too.. yes to hate Hayes shihan and what
he has done..
I went for it.. and didn't have any reason to hate him..
It is so immature..
I grew up and got my OWN opinions.

I don't wish to be disrespectful here but what has other done for the
Japanese bujutsu arts that Hayes shihan hasn't done too?
If it wasn't for Hayes shihan, Manaka shihan and a few others... the USA
would not have gotten the information it needed to grow.
But this is just my opinion.

Hatsumi sensei didn't push the ryuha and didn't feed us the information we
needed to grow with in my opinion.

As many have in the Bujinkan I had to go outside the Bujinkan to find
'truth'.

I know I'm a bad student now for doing so..
But I'm happy and better for it.

One of the posters was Mr. Martin. He spoke very down to me in his post. But
his information about me is second hand or from a student who was asked to
leave my dojo and his ranking revoked for his actions with a young lady.
But no one asked about why he post what he did and why he is so hateful
towards me... funny.. he doesn't even know me.

One of the biggest disappointments I had was while in Japan training in
1992.
I was shocked at the non-combative nature of the Bujinkan Dojo there.
The students were just way to soft and had little if no experience with
combative training.

One major point was Hatsumi sensei gave me a hachidan one day and a kudan
the other..
I was embarrassed and didn't take the kudan.
Here I was so young and I was being promoted to such a high ranking to the
level of my seniors.. such as to the level of Hayes shihan...
It doesn't make sense to me..

Yes the forums are good and need more mature posting.. with less ego and
fear.. in my opinion.

Here's a better question for everyone, on the topic of Stephen K.
Hayes' relative position in the Bujinkan. Instead of &quot;why does Hatsumi
sensei allow this or that?&quot;, inquire on this - seeing how Hatsumi
sensei and An-Shu Hayes interact, what can you learn from it that
applies to your own personal training? How can you take the lessons -
whatever they may be to you - and make them work for you?

Personally, in the interaction between Hatsumi sensei and An-Shu Hayes,
one thing that I've picked up is that the quality of questions you ask
is really, really important. I've noticed more often than not that
Hatsumi sensei, responding to questions asked by An-Shu Hayes, responds
with a question or another line of inquiry. That's one of the reasons
why Secrets of the Ninja Grandmaster is such an important book. The
information in it - the data, if you will - is secondary to the
structure of the information itself, the meta-data, to use a
programmer's term.

When I've gone to Bujinkan Tai Kai events, one thing that's struck me
is how silly some people's questions are. Here's the chance of a
lifetime to ask the a living grandmaster of ninjutsu any question, and
you ask &quot;How would you fight in outer space?&quot; or something equally
silly. How do you get useful information out of a master practitioner
of a martial art that's designed to be secret?

What amused me more than anything when watching the discussion about
An-Shu Hayes showing up at the Bujinden to train this past December was
that people were so focused on the politics of the situation that few
actually commented on how Hatsumi sensei and An-Shu Hayes interacted,
what questions An-Shu Hayes asked of Hatsumi sensei, and what answers
came back.

In my own training, I have to learn how to ask better questions of my
teachers. Studying how An-Shu Hayes asks questions to get the
information he wants is an important part of my training, and that's
what I take away from the interaction between Hatsumi sensei and An-Shu
Hayes.

&quot;Quality questions create a quality life. Successful people ask better
questions, and as a result, they get better answers.&quot; - Tony Robbins

"/> Beyond putting the lessons to use as metaphor, you can also learn a lot
about yourself by watching your reaction to controversy. Have you ever had
someone ask you, &quot;Why do you train?&quot;, but found it difficult to put it into
words? It's hard to know all your motivations, but threads like this one
bring out emotions and thoughts in us that reveal the point of view we take.

For example, some people talked about controversy creating a nagging doubt
in their minds. Maybe that tells you that a strong motivator for you is
&quot;being right&quot; or &quot;not being a fool&quot;, and so all these negative comments
worry you with the idea that maybe you are the fool.

Some people responded with a civilized form of the &quot;shut up and train!&quot;
reaction. If that's yours, then you know you find something inherently
distasteful or immature about this conversation. What does that tell you
about who you think you are?

I don't mean we should analyze others' posts, because those are a mix of
what people really think and how they want to present themselves publicly
-- too complex to get to the real person there. But we can consider our
own gut reactions, we can learn about ourselves. This can be a
surprisingly insightful process if you let it unfold and tolerate what you
find in yourself.

Good health!

interesting tought chris,

So why don't we all stop talking about this or that person and focus on
the material we need to go on?

Here's a question that seems interesting (to me)

how come that some techniques from the same Ryu, with the same name,
are done differently in the bujinkan and in the To-shin do method...

Tricky question, especially since some techniques share names, and some
names appear in different schools... example, ichimonji no kamae (the
name) appears in Gyokko Ryu, Togakure Ryu, Kukishinden Ryu, Shinden
Fudo Ryu, and possibly one or two other schools. Each has different
purposes and was created or formulated for different times and
problems. One thing - one question - that An-Shu Hayes consistently
asks with regard to a technique is, &quot;What problem was this technique
designed to solve?&quot;

To-Shin Do is formulated as a response to current conditions in 21st
century America. With the exception of police and a small minority of
civilians, we don't generally have armor on, and so kamae and
techniques designed for wearing armor make no sense now as is, in
textbook form. Equally true is the fact that a large number of people
have training in martial arts that did not exist in Japan at the time
of these schools' founding, such as sport boxing, Greco-Roman
wrestling, arnis, savate, etc.

The reality is that To-Shin Do practitioners have to be able to deal
with these, plus different types of knives and guns that also were
never dreamed of back in historical Japan. Case in point, the Spyderco
Delica knife. It's a 3 inch serrated knife. Against steel chain mail
and plate mail, a Spyderco Delica is profoundly ineffective. A 16th
century samurai would probably mistake it for an eating utensil.
However, in modern times, that same knife can deal a tremendous amount
of damage to the average citizen simply because we have little to no
protective gear.

Why different? Times are different.

I know times are different,

but shoud'nt the buji...students benifit of the same differences as we
are? The couple of times I trained in a buji...dojo, people kept saying
They did'nt do that technique that way...you're doing it wrong!!!

I always learned a technique as it was written in the beginning, then
we learned the &quot;newer&quot; version, apparently most of the students there
only know the original one....

My understanding was that any given technique has an underlying &quot;strategy&quot;,
or effect. The actual physical movements can appear very different to the
eye, and still accomplish the same thing. For a bad example, one can respond to
a punch in one way with one's hands, and handle a kick in the same way using
one's legs. The visual is very different.

I always thought SKH was presenting the same underlying (historical)
ideas with more appropriate (modern) physical movements?

I know times are different,

but shoud'nt the buji...students benifit of the same differences as we
are? The couple of times I trained in a buji...dojo, people kept saying
They did'nt do that technique that way...you're doing it wrong!!!

I always learned a technique as it was written in the beginning, then
we learned the &quot;newer&quot; version, apparently most of the students there
only know the original one....
(I hope i'm offending nobody here )

(Coming from a beginner) As far as ichimonji no kamae: I didn’t really
understand what it was used for until I saw the historical purpose behind
it. The same as the omote shuto being swung behind the head before striking.
I enjoy the way An-Shu puts it together because he takes all these
historical techniques and makes the practical to modern day defense. I
believe that, in and of itself, is the basis of Toshindo. I also remember
hearing that some instructors out there will only teach you the original
kata and no modern day application to it… I’m so glad that is not us.

Let's talk about kamae for a minute. Each of the ryuha in Hatsumi-soke's
Bujinkan (and even in Tanemura-san's Genbukan) have many of the same kamae.
Take Ichimonji no Kamae for example. This is a Kamae that is known for its
many variations. In one ryu, you may be standing high with your rear palm
facing you. You back is straight. In another, your rear hand may be in a
boshiken fist near the bend in your arm. And in yet another, you are low the
the ground with your upper body leaning back.

Is this because of reasons Chris sited? I was picturing the Ichimonji no
Kamae with the rear palm facing you a minute ago and a thought occurred to
me.... Armor. Gauntlets were worn in that period that protected the back
on the hand and arm. Could this be the reason for this variation? It is
the most logical to me, but I may be wrong.

What are your thoughts?

From Jon Kingsley

Charlotte Warrior Heart Association (Quest Affiliate)

Trained under Steve Davis of Charles Daniels Lineage

Trained under An Shu Hayes

Trained under Sifu Li Chi Keung of Lai Tung Pai

Trained under Greg Luna in Tan Su

Trained under Soke West in Han Mu Do Hapkido

Also trained in Kenpo, Aikido, Hapkido under Steve Davis

I put this information first to show that I have been familiarized with the
old and the new training methods and have been a part of many martial
lineages that I value highly all for the same reason: That I can learn a
great deal from each that I did not know before.

The relevance of my statement to this topic of discussion is this:

An Shu Hayes (in my experiences with him) has never offered defenses
regarding disparaging remarks that are found out and about on the web
regarding his life or the experiences therein. He HAS however requested
time and time again that onlookers simply look at his life and allow the
events of that life to speak for themselves. This statement in and of
itself is the eternally standing rebuttal to the good and the bad that has
been said about him or his training groups throughout the years. No actual
words of rebuttal need be spoken in response to this &quot;mess&quot;.

I say that to say this:

As a fledgling school owner and operator and someone who has seen schools
that I have been a part of rise and fall over the years, I look up to An Shu
Hayes as the example to follow out of all my instructors over the years.
This is not to say that I haven't had extremely good instructors over the
years, but none that have offered their own life up to the microscope in the
way that An Shu Hayes has chosen to do. He doesn't mind you asking
questions regarding his marital success, his business success, his martial
success, or anything else you can think of to pry into. For this I am and
will be grateful for the rest of my days. I may not agree with a practice
in his school or a way he phrases something from time to time, but it is
very hard to argue successfully with success. When I underwent my licensing
from An Shu Hayes, he never said that I HAD to do things their way in order
to be a licensed instructor under him. He only said, &quot;You can do things
your way or another way or experiment with the teachings and procedures if
you want to, but I have been doing this and successfully growing in both the
martial arts and the business itself for over twenty years now.&quot; You know
what? He's simply right. No use in arguing about it. Not really any
desire to either. When you're right your right!

Simply put, An Shu Hayes has been around this business and art a LOOOONG
time and hasn't had anything on his record or list of experiences that makes
me think twice about taking his advice. With a guy who is that open with
his experiences and life, in my humble opinion, responding to any of the
statements made about him would discredit his achievements and not allow
them to speak for themselves.

Just another two cents to add to the pot...

It strikes me that there's probably only two people really qualified to
speak on the matter of the current relationship between Mr. Hayes and
Mr. Hatsumi, and since neither of them have weighed in (can't say I
blame them), anything else is just kind of spinning our collective
wheels.

With that said, if you're getting what you want from your training, why
dig on anyone else's? If you're not, then think about what you DO want
and go find it. At no point does taking pot-shots at anyone, their
style, or their instructor need to enter the picture. If something's
not not working for you, it's not working for you. Be mellow and leave
it at that.

Going back and forth about which school has the 'real' training and
who's pandering to the masses just seems to me like so much
ego-by-proxy... it's a pity it seems to crop up so regularly in the
martial arts. When a technique gives me a decent chance at getting out
of a ground-and-pound being applied by someone with a solid forty pound
advantage in muscle on me, I'm happy with it whether it's 'authentic'
taijutsu or something some guy invented in his garage the previous
night. The proof is in the application. If it works, it's real enough
for me.

Anyway, that's a lot more than I originally meant to write on the
topic. Less talking, more mat time! :)

Hi guys,
Relationships in my opinion....
It is not the relationship between Hayes shihan and Hatsumi sensei that I am
concerned with.
Oh no.. not at all. It is the relationship Hatsumi sensei has with his own
organization.
Hatsumi sensei doesn't seem to deal with the relationships of the senior
members of the Bujinkan Dojo as it is called.
Maybe its to large of a group now or he doesn't care to deal with it.
He has the answers to these questions I'm sure.
I am very concerned about the welfare of the people I have in my own
organization and take each and everyone of them to heart.
Personally do not hold Hatsumi sensei lack of or the skills of organization
management as a bad thing.
I just feel he is involved in a totally different way of life than we are
when it comes to organizational understanding.

The question is why is it that so many Bujinkan Dojo members concern
themselves with what other Bujinkan Dojo members are doing or not doing with
their life.. or should I say martial ways and as well as the people who have
stepped out of the Bujinkan Dojo to search for &quot;&quot;truths&quot;&quot; not found in the
methodology of the Bujinkan Dojo?

I for one would like to have that answered. But that is a totally different
deal.

I feel from reading and watching Hayes shihan program tapes he has found
different illuminating ideas that bring to light the lack of or the weakest
of what he felt was &quot;&quot;truth&quot;&quot; in his own research. Results are he looked
elsewhere for answers to these questions that concerned him.
The question is why are so many people troubling themselves with what Hayes
shihan is doing unless they are themselves troubled with their training and
are most likely jealous of his liberation.

I'm not sure if my point or opinion is coming across but maybe someone can
decipher what I'm saying.. LOL..

I think any time you engage in an activity that requires a significant
amount of time and effort there is a natural tendency to think of what
you are doing as the &quot;best&quot;. Its how we reassure ourselves that our
time and effort is being spent in a worthwhile manner. This is perhaps
not the healthiest of attitudes, but it is a common one and can easily
lead to petty arguments and sniping if left unchecked. I see this kind
of situation all over, not just in the martial arts. Programmers argue
over the merits of their language of choice, dieters over which diet is
best, computer users over which platform and OS. Being passionate about
what you do is great, closing your mind to everything that differs is
not. As in all things a balance must be maintained.

I think it speaks highly of An-Shu Hayes that he does not respond or get
involved in these arguments. There is rarely any way to sway the
opinion of a person with a fanatical belief in something, and you tend
to sully yourself by trying. To me it seems the best course of action
is to simply move ahead with what works for you. Be positive, be
passionate, and be open to worthwhile experiences no matter where they
come from.

Help me out if I got this wrong........ if I ever get caught in a bad
situation will it matter who's 'THING' I'm doing???? I hope I'm doing 'MY THING'
and the situation comes out good for me! In the end I have to have confidence
in myself and whatever 'thing' I'm doing.

So if your happy with your thing......... and I'm happy with my
thing........... just stay in your yard and play with your own toys and leave mine alone.

OK change of subject!!!!! Could you guys who know all the Japanese words for
stuff help the rest of us out. If there is an English word could you put it
next to it or something? I get lost between those words and some of the short
hand folks use. Sorry, figure if I get lost others do to.

I got a new question...... is there any books or writings by Takamatsu
Toshitsugu in English a fella could get his hands on?

I agree with what Rich Harang has said, if your training is working for you
then move forward and enjoy the experience. If you don't agree with what
someone else is doing then why in the world would you waist your valuable time
concerning yourself with it?!?

If you are worried about what everyone else is doing then you will miss the
lesson that was meant for you! By the way these topics seem to be dragged to
death, many have already missed the lesson that was meant for them.

Get out from behind your computer and get on the mat!

Steve:

Get Hatsumi-soke's video about Takamatsu-soke if you do not have it already.
It is a good source of information regarding Takamatsu-soke.

hello Munoz,
really what you say is &quot;PRACTICAL MODERN DAY APPLICATION IS USEFUL&quot; I agree with that, as had an experience with my students who were army commondos from the Basantar Brigade in India ( south , Hyderabad) I used my taijutsu tech., ato teach them how to fire from SLR or carbine while balancing on a rope or hanging from it, the CO was astonished to see all the stuff &amp; did not believe that a civilain can do such things, so its the basics of the art which make you confident on using it in typical situations, thankjs, bye
