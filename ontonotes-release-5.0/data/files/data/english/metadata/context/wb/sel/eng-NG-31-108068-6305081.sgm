Well, I haven't PERMANENTLY decided yet.

The direction I'm leaning is to keep my Colt Officer's Model in .45 ACP.
Galco inside the pants holster. It goes everywhere I go except church. Then
it stays in the car. I will carry the gun in C1 and I will get a pounch for
an extra magazine or two. I will also store three magazines in the car. I
might put something with a little more firepower in the car as well. Why
not? Although the FBI lost two submachine guns that way in SW a week or two
ago. The car is securely garaged during working and nighttime hours.

I'm toying with the idea of adding a set of Crimson Trace laser grips. I
handled a set last night at a local gun store. They were very steady in my
hands and easy to activate the laser. The plan is to experiment with some
different color dots on the Colt's rear and front sights. White will
probably be best (that is what was originally on the gun. One day I took aim
and couldn't find the dot that was supposed to be on the right of the rear
sight. It had disappeared :-( Once I settle on a color, I'll use the sight
to aim and confirm with the laser. The laser looks like it might be a pretty
good training device when dry firing too.

Reactions? I handled all of the other autoloaders suggested here last night.
I like the 1911. The Kahr is interesting. The one I handled last night had
an obviously bad trigger. When I asked the saleman about it, he was
surprised and took it off the shelf. The KD's aren't as big as they look.
This might have been an option if I didn't already have a Colt. The Sig
still doesn't feel right in my hand. The salesman said they've never had a
problem with Kimber returns. I still like the Kimbers.

I haven't revisited the revolver option yet.

If this all works out, I'll start solving the next problem.

THE NEXT PROBLEM: How to secure the house and outbuildings.

I may as well say it. I live in Northern Virginia, 24 miles outside
Washington DC. We have six wooded acres (so there is some space but not long
shooting lanes), a well built brick house. Our emergency services can take
some time getting here. We have a monitored GE alarm system which is new and
in good working order. I am both insured and armed to the teeth. Firearms
are stored in a 900 lb. safe. Except the one I carry and the duty AK and 12
guage. I buy ammunition in case lots. My wife has her own Baretta Storm in
.45 ACP. Equipped with a holographic sight. Insurance is for full
replacement value. We won't shoot anyone to protect property. At least I
don't think so.

I don't go outside at night without a gun. I was almost attacked by a feral
rottweiler while taking out the garbage a few years ago. We have a number of
containers of OC foam hidden at strategic locations. We don't want to shoot
any dogs unless we have to. We have two dogs of our own. They bark a lot
when they see strangers or strange cars. It is hard to get near our house
without us knowing. It is impossible to get inside our house without us
knowing. I think.

I built a good deal of redundancy into the alarm system. It communicates
with the monitoring system using both telephone link and a cellular link.
Short of a government agency jamming the cellular link, there is no way to
defeat it. I like the government and they like me. You could put a bullet
into the cellular subsystem, but first you'd have to find it. I've hidden
it. I used to earn my living helping government agencies hide radios and
antennas on airplanes known to fly to Columbia. The pilots looked for them
but didn't find them. A burglar has only seconds before the alarm is sent.
You don't have time to physically get to it even if you know where it is.
There are also multiple sirens and I can move them around easily, so while
you know the location today, it won't necessarily be there tomorrow. In
addition to all of the sensors, and special sensors and alarms around the
safes, each family member has a cell phone and a panic buttom on their
person all the time.

We're not trigger happy. We have drunks stumble out of our woods every few
years. We help them figure out where they came from (invariably they were at
a party, wandered into the pretty woods and got lost) and usually give them
a lift home. We have a sense of humor here.

If you haven't figured it out, I like thirty caliber rifles, .45 caliber
pistols and 12 guages. I like the idea of a .45 ACP carbine. The Baretta
Storm is sweet. The problem is the magazine capacity. Ten rounds isn't
enough. We like thirty round magazines. I got an MPA .45 Defender with a six
inch barrel to play with. It uses unmodified grease gun magazines. I'm
toying with the same gun in a carbine configuration. I'm thinking about an
EOTech sight for it. The one I have functions flawlessly. I keep a 12 guage
and an AK47 semi ready. I worry about shooting either inside the house. I
don't like the AK sights. It is probably 50 yards to the closest house. I
could get an AR15 with an EOTech, but that bullet will go a long way. My 12
guage only holds seven rounds. My plan is to empty the shotgun and then open
up with the AK if anythig is left standing.

Oh, we have lots of exterior lights around the house. Some are motion
sensitive. Some are controlled from within the house. I had some on an X10
module as part of the alarm system, but that posed some problems.

We have an emergency plan. Everyone knows where to go if there is a problem.
If it is a fire, they go outside and meet at a specific location. Other
contingencies exist which I don't need to discuss.

MS13 is setting up shop in Manassas. That is about 8 miles away. Folk Nation
has been here for years. Local police expect a problem sooner or later. They
are pretty aggressive combatting gangs. Lots of people in and out of our
neighborhood at night. If you leave something near the street it usually
disappeasr by morning.

Well, that's the problem space. I know Mel Tappan wouldn't have been happy
with our location, but moving to Oregon is out of the question for now. My
wife doesn't llike snow. Most of our neighbors are OK. We had one neighbor
that did time in Texas for murder. She was passionate, but has since moved.
We currently have a neghbor who is a real problem. He owns a construction
company and has brought drugs and a lot of seedy motorcycle looking guys
around. Not the 50-something couples in live with Harley's.  These are
creeps.

Breaking into a car is as easy as opening a refrigerator. Leaving a gun
there is totally irresponsible. Leave it locked up at home if you're not
willing to take it into church. If you want teenagers to have guns, buy a
bunch of cheap ones and hand them out in a school parking lot.

Your one mistake.  Don't take it off even when you go into the church.  Stop
and think about it from a perp's point of view.  Is he more likely to
assault people at a firing range or someplace where people take their guns
off and leave them in their cars?  In just the past year or two I read news
accounts of someone going homicidal in a church and no one there was armed
and available to stop them.  Preparing yourself to defend your own life and
the lives of others is in no way disrespectful to God.  In fact, it shows
you value His Gift of Life and are willing to honor it and protect it.   In
fact, at one time during the early colonial days, colonists were required to
bring their muskets to church to show their preparedness to protect
themselves and their brethren.  Too bad that practice went away.   Keep your
gun on and keep it concealed.  That way you will offend no one in the church
but you will remain prepared.

I think that's fine. Its a gun you are used to and probably
already shoot well. As long as you dress appropriately, it
should not be a problem

I imagine you saw the recent discussion on this. My take is
that they would be good for practicing point shooting, but
in the real world, its probably something that would break
just when you've come to rely on it and need it the most.
Though if you have bad eyesight, it could come in handy if
you are awoken in the middle of the night.

I take that to mean actually malfunctioning. I'm a little
surprised by that too. The PM9 had some QC problems early
on, but that was years ago. Normally they have a fairly
smooth/short DA pull with a clean break.

I like Kimbers. I would just point out that at least some of
the smaller models have an aluminum alloy frame, so they
probably would not last for as many rounds as an all steel
model.

If that's a serious concern, carry a little bottle of OC
with you. If a dog challenges you, it will probably be from
a distance outside of OC range. Keep the OC in one hand,
don't make any sounds, face the dog, make yourself as big
and self confident as possible, and *do not* turn away under
any circumstances. Wait for the dog to turn away first, or
if it goes after you, don't turn and run, hit it with the OC
and try to remain calm. If the dog tries to go around you to
check out your turf, and you feel confident enough, block
him so that he knows its your territory. Hit him with the OC
if you think he needs it and is in range.

Dogs usually are a really good idea. You can reinforce them
to bark when they hear someone trying to get in or fumbling
around outside. I'm actually a certified dog trainer and
sometimes do a little training on the side. I can give you
some pointers if you want to send me an email.

Yeah but its not really intended as a true self defense
weapon anyway. Its kind of a mutant between a handgun and a
real carbine. It loses the maneuverability of a pistol and
loses the effectiveness of an intermediate rifle caliber.

Actually, Dr. Gary Roberts has done some serious research,
as well as a number of law enforcement agencies, in regards
to 5.56 penetration issues. It will penetrate barriers less
than 7.62x39 and often less than even handgun ammunition,
with satisfactory terminal performance, and an AR will be
more controllable provided your aim is good as well. An
EOTech would be a big help in that regard. Some people also
suggest keeping a set of active hearing protection next to
the rifle or shotgun; if you think you might have the time,
a vest that you can throw on in the middle of the night.

I'll see if I can get hold of Dr. Roberts to ask him about
specific loads that would be most suitable inside a house.
Given the brick structure and the surrounding woods, you
could be OK, other than windows. Just be sure to think about
your fields of fire and train properly. I would think there
are probably some good trainers in that neck of the woods.
Fun and exercise...

Get to know your neighbors well if you haven't already. If
any are so inclined, you can back each other up if necessary.

It's funny ya should word it that way ... here in MN, state law says
no CCW in K-12 ... but ya can dis-arm, re-arm in the parking
lot.  :-0  Also funny, they're werkin' on churches too ... in fact, we
lost our Shall Issue fer a few months specifically 'cause of
churches ... they shopped fer a judge, and found one they liked.

Personally, I don't know that a house is any more difficult to break
into.

Regardless, if state law specifies areas where you CANNOT carry, but
you REALLY need to go into (court-room, school, posted), and if you
CANNOT leave it in your vehicle (which MN law DOES provide for), then
you have a DE FACTO gun ban ... of sorts.  If you need to serve jury-
duty, parent-teacher conferences, or sometimes eat, by your logic,
you'd have to leave the gun at home.  And what about work?  Some of us
simply CAN'T carry at work.

I would be very, very careful making such statements.  Should the dark-
side ever git the idea that pro-gun folks BELIEVE leaving a gun in a
vehicle is akin to handing them out in a school parking lot ... well,
don't be surprised if that becomes SB xxxxx.  :-/

Sure would be nice if auto manufacturers had an option fer a lock-box
bolted thru the body directly to the frame though?  :-0

We had a madman go into a church in Ft. Worth a few years ago. Apparently
everybody there thinks the same way you do. That a church is a sanctuary.
Too bad the dead couldn't be asked about that after it was over. You have
gun(s). It behooves you to have it for yourself and your family wherever you
go.. I can't guess any better than the legislature about where and when I
might need a gun. And when you need a gun you'll need it very badly. Unlike
the legislature, I'm not going to take any chances on being wrong. There's
not a place on their list where unlawful shootings haven't occurred.

Well, the law neither advocates or establishes a religious
institution, nor prohibits the free exercise of religion.
I'd wager that if somebody looks into the law, it probably
goes back for generations.

# Why is your right to protect your life and your family
# less in a religious building than it is in a grocery store?

Because a church is usually regarded as belonging to God and
by extension the congregation. The congregation also has a
right to practice their religion. If they feel its against
their religion to bring a firearm into a house of God, the
owner of the firearm is free to find another congregation
that does not object.

# Besides, if you
# are carrying properly concealed, the issue will never come up for discussion
# anyway.  If you every HAVE to use it in the church, explaining WHY you just
# saved someone's life will be a minor point in your day.
#

Its also a matter of trust. Somebody deliberately concealing
a firearm from a congregation that he/she knows might
object is deliberately being devious and deceiving the
congregation. Regardless of any law, if the members of your
congregation would possibly object on religious grounds,
then you have an obligation to ask them or at least ask the
pastor or reverend or priest or rabbi or imam or whatever.
If they do object, then respect their wishes while in church
or find another congregation. Its that simple.

The Virginia law doesn't say anything about the wishes of the pastor or
congregation. Our pastor probably wouldn't mind. Also, the Virginia law is
fairly vague. What is "good and sufficient cause?" I don't know.

You'd have to research the case law to see if there are any
precedents. I'm not saying the law was a good idea or right,
I just don't see that it would violate the 1st Amendment.
And it would be interesting to discover when it was enacted;
possibly long before what would be considered the modern
"gun control era", which might add some insight to the
motives and historical perspective. For example, if it were
originally enacted to prevent blacks from arming, then that
could be additional political ammunition. 2nd Amendment
issues are certainly in play, especially if the pastor has
no objection. My limited knowledge of the Virginia
Constitution leads me to believe that the statute is in
question on those grounds as well. But the only way to get
it decided is to challenge the law.

Well if kept well concealed then know one but you will know. If it ever
comes to a point where you need to use a gun in church then the good and
sufficient cause will be laying on the floor or at least trailing blood
out the door.

If you ask a minister, priest, rabbi, etc., I have a feeling
he/she will tell you that God will know. It is not your
house, it is God's house, and the congregation abides by a
set of principles as to how it should be respected. If
someone wants to carry concealed in a church, etc., they
should have enough respect for their fellow parishioners and
church leaders to at the very least ask the priest, pastor,
minister, elders, whatever applies, and go from there. If
you can't abide by whatever decision arises, then find
another congregation that agrees with you or start your own
congregation.

I suppose me not carrying a gun in church would be less defiling than a
bunch of dead congregation members when some psycho decides to take
advantage of their helplessness...

Peter's right.  It's ultimately a private property issue.  If
the owners of the property, the church, feels it needs to be
a disarmed victim zone, anyone who goes in armed is a trespasser.

Besides, who would want to go to that church, anyway.  Find
another.

I'll agree with that Peter, and will it would be best to ask the OP does
indicate that he thought the pastor wouldn't mind. My only point was
that a justified shooting would be evidence of 'good and sufficient cause'.

Well, then, if God is unhappy about somebody carrying in church, **He**  can
tell the pastor/priest/etc. and the problem can be dealt with.
Otherwise, if only one person - other than God - knows about it, I do not see
any damage done to the others in the congregation.
Frankly, I don't think God cares much if folks wear underwear, (or guns), or not
as long as they observe His Commandments and so forth. Should we worry about
whether or not to wear underwear as much as we worry about wearing firearms?
Piffle-tish!
Best regards
John

It seems to me that dragging the the congregration and the church

I thought the issue here was the government was *presuming* that the
church would object, and was prohibiting guns for that reason --
stomping on the church's private property rights.

Another thing -- the church officially doesn't approve of sin, but if it
banned all the sinners there wouldn't be a church at all.

Best regards,
Bob

I'm not sure you're likely to meet him, but both of you is going up in
front of The Judge.  ("Here comes the Judge!" with a vengeance.)  And there
you will be, trying to explain why you sent a sinner unshrived to his
judgment.  Of course, if you make a good confession and get right before
_you_ die, that will be taken care of, along with all the other sinning
you've done.
On the other hand, "those who chose to live by the sword, die by the
sword."  Sad, but people make their own choices, and it isn't so much that
I killed them, but that they killed themselves, I just held the bullet.
I am recalling a novel, where the Abby is under siege by the host of
Evil, and the monks manning the wall have prayer as they loose arrows which
ends "... shrive my foe and bless my aim."  I've liked that, ever since I
read it.

"Simple" in the extreme, if "might" and "possibly" are your points
of reference.

If they care, they will have an established policy. If they do not
have a standing policy, why bring it up? They are likely to be
swayed by the same liberal mindset which has made our mainline
churches bastions of political correctness during the past forty
years.

If they don't already have a stated policy, they, like any other
group, are unlikely to make the right decision on the spur of the
moment. They will play it ultra-safe in the interim, while running
the issue through their administrative processes, and then, having
become comfortable with the idea, and not had any incidents which
would change their thinking, they will stick with the "safe"
decision already in force.

Base your expectations on human nature and the modus operandi of all
organizations, and never on wishful thinking. If you are put in the
position of defending CCW in church, then of course it is too late
to do anything but gather supporters, marshal your best arguments,
and pray. If you lose, go elsewhere. You will find God there also.

Pyotr,

The "perp" has made his own decision on both "sudden" and "prepared".

Perhaps it is our responsibility to prepare ourselves and to avoid
sudden death at the perp's hands. Of course, you will not shoot him
in the back in anticipation of his becoming a "perp," if you see my
point.

Suicide by Cop; Suicide by CCW Holder -- all in the hands of the
"perp" as part of his own "preparation", in his own good time. Would
this run counter to the teachings of your faith?
