Hi, I have a 1990 Accord EX and the two right brake lights along with
the center tail light are not working.  Two two left ones work fine.  I
took out the bulbs and they did not look burnt out.  Replacing the
bulbs did not work either.  Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks.

Are the taillights and signal lights working?

Do you have any red lights illuminated on the dashboard?

Check to make sure the wiring is actually plugged in. As I recall there is
a connector that sends power from the left lights over to the right ones.

With a bulb removed and a helper stepping on the brake pedal, can you see
voltage from each of the buttons at the bottom of the socket to a ground?

Yes, the tail and signal lights are all working, just not those brake
lights.  The "brake light" lamp on the dash is on (not the BRAKE).
Also, the cruise control went out about a year ago.  I understand the
stop light switch control both the brake lights and the cruise control,
but can it fail for only some of the brake lights?  Any idea how I go
about testing and replacing the gizmo?

Thanks.

Then the system thinks you have a burned out bulb.

As I said in my previous message:
"With a bulb removed and a helper stepping on the brake pedal, can you see

Try that first. Check the sockets for corrosion. If you definitely see no
voltage at all, from the buttons at the bottom of the socket, AND if all
the electrical connectors are actually conmnected!, THEN you start
investigating other stuff.

O.K. I tried that and when I was messing around with the wires with the
brake depressed the middle and inside left tailight came on
momentarily.  I started to jiggle the wires going into a grey harness
and the lights flickered, so it must be that.  I have no idea how to
get that thing out though.  Any ideas?

Thanks.

Yep. You have a bad connection somewhere. Time for you to take matters into
your own hands and find the break. Car ever been in a rear-end collision?
