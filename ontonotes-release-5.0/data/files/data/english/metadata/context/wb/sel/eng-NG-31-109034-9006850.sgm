POD:  For reasons scientists are still debating, in 1700 the Earth
begins to enter an extreme period of global warming.  It is so severe
that the Ice caps begin melting in 1725 and by 1900 they are all gone
and the Earth looks something like this;

(Europe is not quite this bad, but close.)

What is the 18th, and 19th century going to be like in a time of
intense global warming?

Famine for large numbers of people in Europe obviously, but is this
enough to stop the industrial revolution?  (It's my opinion that the
Industrial Revolution was the biggest event of the last 1000 years, so
if it is aborted or not is a rather important question, even for a TL
that sees as much disruption as this one.)

How will China handle the loss of a rather big chunk of it's territory
to the ocean?  The 18th and 19th centuries were not good to China in
OTL, is this enough to make China completely collapse?

Will the British still end up conquering an India that is even weaker
due to famine and rising sea levels or will they be too busy trying to
leave a sinking British Isle to go to America to do anything of
importance in Asia?  Will anyone in Europe be going to Asia in
significant force or will they be too busy at home?

Will this intense global warming significantly help Russia by opening
up a lot of farmland, or would the other effects negate that
advantage?

How fairs the Ottoman Empire?

Thoughts?

First thought is that if Earth warms enough that _all_ the ice melts (and
what sea-level raise are these pics assuming - I can't seem to find a
consensus when I try to look up how far no-ice levels would rise), then bad
as they are, the sea incursions may be the least of there problems. At a
(very) rough guess, everyone's climate has now shifted about four or five
hundred miles north. Does this cause, say, Spain and Italy to become
&quot;Sahara II?&quot;

And how many die in the Northern climes before they can successfully change
over to more southern crops?

There'e a good chance the &quot;Great American Desert&quot; actually _becomes_ a
desert.

Fishing ought to improve, what with all those nice shallow seas out there.
It's just a pity that said seas are going to make finding any deepwater
ports a bitch.

This is... unlikely.

Rapid global warming is certainly possible; there's plenty of evidence
that ice ages have ended very quickly (and started just as fast).

However, these pictures seem to be assuming that *all* the world's ice
has melted -- in particular, all the ice in Antarctica's ice caps.
That's just not going to happen.  Antarctica's ice caps predate the
ice ages.  They got going way back in the Miocene.  During warm
interglacial periods they get a bit smaller, but they don't even come
close to disappearing.  The Circum-Polar Current isolates Antarctica
from the rest of the planet and keeps it cool even when the rest of
the planet is sweltering.

This is not to say we couldn't have fast global warming and disruptive
sea level rises.  It's conceivable, for instance, that the Greenland
ice cap might disappear within 200 years.  (I don't believe it, myself
-- it would require a faster and sharper warming than ever seen
before, because the Greenland cap is so big it creates its own climate
-- but it's not completely insane.)  Losing Greenland would cause sea
levels to rise about 6 meters or 20 feet.  That wouldn't wipe Florida
off the map, but it would have a noticeable effect on property values
in Key West.

I notice they've gone with a simplistic raising of the sea level for
the Caspian -- which is way wrong; in a warm interglacial, the Caspian
would probably shrink -- but not for the Great Lakes.  Hum.

Anyway.  There is a POD here.  OTL the Little Ice Age, c. 1300-1800,
had a very noticeable effect on European history.  (Europe is only now
recovering the balmy climate of the late first millenium.  When
William the Conqueror sailed, England was /exporting/ wine.)

So, a Little Global Warming is certainly plausible.  Have the Little
Ice Age end a century earlier -- we still don't know why it happened
-- and then have things just heat up fast, so that 1800 is like OTL
2000 and 1900 is... well, like we fear 2100 may be: average
temperatures about 2-3 degrees centigrade warmer, and sea levels a
couple of meters higher.

Note that just two meters is enough to have a serious economic impact;
it may not be flashy disaster-movie stuff, but most coastal cities
will have to be rebuilt, and the Netherlands and Bengal are in for a
world of hurt.

The real impact would come from fast changes in climate and --
possibly -- violent weather.  Although this gets a bit speculative,
and starts to depend sensitively on which post-global-warming climate
models you subscribe to. (i.e., superhurricanes?  desertification?
topsoil loss?  etc., etc.)

The end of Younger Dryas possibly happened in a single year. But after

Actually correct.

The sill in Manych depression is 26 m above sea level. If Antarctica
melts, the ocean would spill over to Caspian depression.

Of course, dry climate in Central Asia would mean that the Caspian
Gulf, unlike Black Sea but like Mediterranean Sea, would be
concentration basin - but the shoreline would indeed match ocean
level.

Whereas Lake Ontario at 74 m asl is slightly too high to be joined to
ocean.

OK, so not enough to stop the Industrial Revolution and really trash
Europe, but pretty disruptive none the less.

Two questions that I think still fit in this scenario:

Is this enough to fully push Manchu China over the edge?  The 19th
century wasn't fun for them in OTL, and with the loss of a lot of
farmland (probable) and more severe climate disruption, is China going
to fall apart completely in this scenario?

and

Is Russia significantly helped by global warming or do the negatives
outweigh the positives even for it?

I'm going to guess that say that Nebraska and what not is going to be
a desert in this TL.  Huge changes for America right there, even
assuming that its history is pretty close to OTL up to 1800 or so.

Actually, most recent historians and economists find the term
&quot;industrial *revolution*&quot; to be so misleading as to be worthless.

As I understand their arguments what they are pointing out is that the
roots of said &quot;revolution&quot; actually go back to the Black Death of the
mid 14th century and the social and demographic consequences thereof.

Or, really, that the whole process was an *evolutionary* one rather
than a *revolutionary* one.

The consensus seems to be that the underlaying basis of the changes
were the development of a market based agricultural economy in the
Netherlands and the spread of the agricultural technology developed
there to the UK where a market based agricultural economy already
existed to a lesser degree and, as a result of the imported changes
(draining of the Fens, for example, was done by Dutch specialists),
became more efficient.

This was underway by the 17th century but really didn't hit its stride
and start to have noticeable effects till the mid to late 18th
century.

Your POD of 1725 and the speed with which the changes occur *might*
just be at the right point to cause it to be stillborn ... I suspect,
in fact, that it would be.

The ongoing disruption would probably delay it indefinitely as the
agricultural production levels required to produce the excess
non-agricultural population needed to fuel the industrial side of
things simply ... stops. Worse, the climate changes probably (almost
certainly) cause a reversion from the then developing pattern of an
end to widespread famine (and widespread die backs) as was the case to
that *of* widespread famine and diebacks.

I suspect that until the climate settled down there would be little or
no chance of an industrialisation process.

YMMV of course.

very.  To get the all the ice to melt that fast would require a crank
of the
global thermostat to + 10 C average.  To happen that fast will cause
MAJOR mass extinctions.  Life would suck far and above what Mike

Please keep in mind that when I say +10 C average that does not
merely mean each place in the whole world is 10 C more.  It'll vary.
Some places more.  Some places less.  The poles get a LOT more.
Other places would even get colder.  Keep in mind the Year w/o a

One difference might be that the Caspian MIGHT get more precip
and grow that way.  Or if the sea level rises high enough you

the superhurricanes and typhoons look pretty strong of a likelihood.
Potentially, the *MED* might generate them.  That will have some
serious havoc causing bits.

The monsoons in India are going to get worse.

North Africa is going to be interesting.  More catastrophic precip,
but
hotter.  The Central Asia gets hotter than the global average by 50 to
100% more than the average as does the Med region.

If the arctic and antarctic warm at their projected future rates (5x
global)
things could get weird.  Russians deflected to the north for their
expansion?
Ice free arctic waters this time period make it rather weird.

China faces serious desertification from the NW coming south.

There is no New Mexico.  Santa Fe withers up and blows away.
The western US faces greatly reduced snow pack which causes
MAJOR issues.  Most precip comes as rain and then there's
little water during the summer save whatever lakes there are.
California gets another major Bay that covers from Tracy to
modern Sacramento.

IDK what to think about SE Asia...

The productivity is caused by the amount of minerals in the water (which
fertilizes the algae, which is eaten by plankton, which feeds the
fish...and so on). The minerals in the water are brought there by the
rising of deep ocean currents - and this  (currently) happens near the
poles.

I _think_ you'll still get major upwellings in these areas, even in an
iceless-world - though to be honest, it'll take someone with a lot more
knowledge of currents than me to even take the emphasis off the word
&quot;think,&quot; let alone give any sort of definite answer.

But shallow seas work almost as well at churning up stuff off the bottom.
And the increased storm level (in theory) of such an iceless (and hot)
world will help too. And it can't hurt that a lot of drowned land is
going to be &quot;fertilizing&quot; the oceans for at least a few decades.

Probably not. It'll help - but I'd still expect the supportable level of
population to drop a lot in the areas majorly hit by sea-level rises.

How does Hungary get flooded?

Looks to me as if the sea water has to flow uphill to get over the
Carpathians, and there is a strip of dry land nbetween Hungary and
Wallachia. Or is the outlet of the Danube somehow blocked, causing _that_ to
flood the Hungarian Plain?

No. It is clear that the key resource was *not* the availabiliy of
coal or iron ... but of food ... with no boost in food production and,
more importanly, no increase in the productivity of agricultural
labour (which predates increases in iron and coal production, and, in
fact, is the reason *for* those increases), then you don't get the
increases in coal and iron production.

Chicken and egg. No food = no population = no increased productivity =
no industry.

The climate changes would ensure, pretty much, that there would be no
surplus food and, most likely, widespread and unpredictable famines
made worse by the impact of the changed weather on transport.

As it was, famine was a problem where land transport had to be used,
and not so much where water transport was available ... but changed
weather patterns would make water transport problematic as well and
impact even those areas that, historically, were less prone to famine
because of their access to it.

All in all, I suspect there's not much chance of any improvements, as
the diebacks will make it unfeasible and unsupportable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Indeed, so they did. But what could they do about the massive changes
in established weather patterns.

Read up on The Great Famine, for example ...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1315-1317

... caused by a relatively moderate weather pattern change far less
nasty than what we suspect will be caused by global climate change
(assuming the climatic models used by those who claim it exist are
correct ... and I have my doubts ... only 20-25 years ago they were
claiming we were heading for another Ice Age!).

Urban die backs were on the order of 10-25% across Europe, IIRC
Finland was estimated to have lost between a quarter and a third of
total population (though some are thought to have fled ... given
transport tech at the time, how many could have done so ... and to
where would they have gone as it affected all of Europe!?)

And that was only three consecutive years, not 175 years!

Well - given that the major food-producing areas in the UK are not
dramatically affected by the rising sea-levels (Wiltshire - for example

*This* might have an impact - if the climate changes significantly (too
wet a summer rotting the corn, too dry a spring withering the young
sprouts) then food supply will be compromised. Fishing will take up
some slack and in the 1800's over-fishing isn't yet a problem.

As an island the UK is fairly well buffered from the extremes of
temperature that will devastate continental Europe - Central Europe
will become a dustbowl in summer and a frozen desert in winter.

It was a considerably different society in the 1800's - yes they would
have had some die-off but I suspect improvements in farming technology,
social organisation and may have mitigated the impact.

Interestingly the year with no summer (1816) caused a famine in various
places[1] and seemed to cause an upsurge in the pace of change in
technology. The same may occur in our scenario as they strive to
overcome the problems (other than by shooting the rioting peasants of

doubled but no mass die-off.

ISTM that ingress of ocean into the _shott_
areas of Tunisia, the Qattara Depression, and
southern Cyrenaica will moderate and moisten
the climate of adjacent areas.

Also, the projected rise IIRC will open the
Straits of Suez. This could allow a current
to pass through the Red Sea, moderating
climate in that area.

(and also radically altering global commerce.)

There are some other questions.

1) How soon do authorities see what is happening?

2) When if ever do they see this is a permanent trend?

2a) Do mariners from northern Europe observe
the melting of Greenland? Do the savants
of the time make the connection?

I could see the Dutch making the connection,
and sending expeditions to measure the Greenland
glaciers to see how bad it could get. Unfortunately
they don't know about Antartica. OTOH, once the
Greenland threat is recognized, I think _someone_
will say &quot;What about the Antarctic?&quot; and ships
will be sent out.

Topo mapping will become a major field of development.

2b) Do they extrapolate, and see how far it will go
before it happens? Does the necessary background
knowledge exist? Can they foresee that in a
century or so, major cities and entire countries
may be inundated?

3) How do they react?

I would expect dismissal. The Dutch _have_ to
pay attention; but their initial reaction will
be higher dikes and more windmills. At some point
though they may have to give it up and start
evacuating.

Venice evacuates sooner. Or do they just try
building higher? But that loses, after a decade
or two. Venice passes into legend as a modern Ys.

4) Where do refugees go? I might predict large
scale migration to America, but I'm not sure
sailing ships can carry enough to matter. It's
an obvious path for Britain, if they see the
isles as substantially doomed. Probably migration
to America from Britain, Ireland, Netherlands,
Germany, and Denmark will be orders of magnitude
larger.

Knock-on from this: these people will be poor
and desperate, and will indenture themselves
_cheap_. The flood of white labor will pre-empt
the African slave trade to North America. The
trade to the West Indies goes away as the islands
drown. (Some colonists evacuate to West Florida,
the Guianas. Jamaica and Hispaniola survive with
crowding.)

Quite. The problem is that we dont know what the conditions will be
like in Britain for the first few decades after the melt starts.
For all we know it will be nice and warm and fairly wet, leading to an
improvement in agricultural output. Alternatively Britain could be
lashed with storms of biblical proportions.
The original POD is lacking in information to make sensible
predictions. It might make more sense to assume that the warming had
been going on for centuries, continuing the Medieval Climate Optimum,
and that the big melt was just a tipping point reached. If so then the
IR might have happened earlier than OTL.

Prosperous does not equate to 'food-producing area'. Yes - there would

I think most readers will understand the social impact of a one year
famine and one continuing for 175 years is *rather* different.

Actually, of course, the famine wouldn't continue for 125 years ...
the die backs would be early, severe, and the &quot;carrying capacity&quot;
would be so reduced that population wouldn't &quot;bounce back&quot; ... but
remain permanently depressed.

All of which makes the Industrial changes that occurred historically
unlikely in the extreme.

Actually iron production started increasing under the Tudors.
Production of iron in the Weald increased about a thousand fold during
the reign of Henry VIII. This was driven in part by the need to produce
guns for the expanding navy. See &quot;Safeguard of the Seas&quot; Off course the
Weald had easily accessible seams and lots of wood. Further north coal
and iron production was limited by the fact that until the coking
process coal was only useful for domestic heating and the transport of
charcoal was expensive.

What the agricultural revolution did was supply capital and food for
industrial cities. Birmingham for example was barely a village in the
early 18th century.

&gt; occurred in the early 14th century) of 10-25% (Finland, as noted,
&gt; suffered between 25-33%, with the caveats noted).
">

And an equivalent one that happened in the 1700's caused nothing like
the problem! Why? Because a) the technology was better b) farming
methods were better and c) the governments had anti-famine provisions
in place (including stockpiles of grain). The places where famine *did*
strike were places where one or more of these factors didn't apply.

Look at the stats - there hasn't been a peace-time famine in England
since 1624. Why do you think that is? After all - there has been
plenty of climate variation during that period!

And I still don't understand where you get the 175 years - people would
adjust fairly quickly to different ways of growing food (different
cereal varieties, switch to root crops rather than cereals, start
planting rice etc etc). Remember by the 1700's Britain already had
access to all these foodstuffs and the knowledge on how to grow them.

These are all assumtions that you are making without proof. Yes - there
would be *some* die-back (the weak, the old and the sick) but no-where
near what you propose. No English famine since 1624 remember? the

I take the opposite view - some aspects would grow faster. If someone

your farmland don't you think you would jump at the chance? Don't you
think that the technologists of the time would be doing everything they
could do to improve the food production?

The *direction* of the change would be significantly different though.

OK - show me how:

a) The main Antarctic ice will melt - even if the global temperature
rises considerably. Maybe over *1000* years - but certainly not in a 3 year
span - or even a 30 year span. Arctic ice melt doesn't raise sea levels
significantly and Greenland gives us about 7 metres.

b) The rising of sea levels will *significantly* change the climate of
the UK.

c) The changes in temperature will *significantly* change the climate
of the UK - such that growing crops becomes all but impossible. Given
that warm, wet periods have existed in recent (well populated) history
without any diminishment of food-growing capacity you may have a
problem.

The Industrial Revolution is a combination of technological and

The revolution will happen - not to make cotton and wool cloth for the

industrialisation won't happen - because it won't be needed - but the
steam revolution will - because it *will* be needed.

You really *do* *not* *have* *a* *clew* as to how the militia were

Which is where the biggest die backs will be ... you really know
nothing of either a) human nature or b) history.

The historical record is quite clear ... the peasants will hide their
food, with a considerable degree of success ... from any marauding
armies as has been their wont throughout recorded history, especially
in cases of extended crises ... and the townspeople will die until
their numbers are reduced to supportable levels.

Indeed, the population will likely die at levels far greater than the
rural populace for the simple reason that the largest urban center in
the UK ... London ... was entirely reliant on sea transport of fuel
and food from elsewhere ... and those transport links are in the
process of being destroyed as soon as this happens. Changed weather
conditions mean disruption of sailing times for what are still
entirely sailing fleets and, indeed, the fairly rapidly rising water
levels under the POD proposed by Mike Ralls (*you* can argue its
likeliness with *him*) mean that, for example, London Docks are
flooded, and, indeed, London *itself* is relatively quickly flooded
(you *have* noted the existence of the Thames Flood Barrier in recent
years?) ...

Disrupting the vital food transport links, even if one believes your
uniquely unbelievable claims as to how easily the food supplies will
remain untouched in the UK while the rest of the world suffers, is
important because, as you would know if you actually knew anything
about the history of the classical-medieval-early modern world and
famine, that is the key basis of famine times ... transport
limitations. In this case, of course, compounded by the fact that the
famine is general rather than localised.

Some old timers talked about how nobody wanted the new hybrids

till they figured that your yield went up 25%, and could be planted
sooner. By WWII, nobody was keeping seedcorn for the following

depriver of its bitumen, sulphur, or other volatile matter by roasting

used where smokeless fire is required. [Written also coak.]

&quot;Englishmen, Abraham Darby invented coke smelting (1709) and advanced
the mass production of brass and iron goods. Coke smelting replaced
charcoal with coal in metal foundries during the process of refining
metals; and this was important to Britain's future since charcoal at
that time was becoming scarce and was more expensive.&quot;

&gt; POD:  For reasons scientists are still debating, in 1700 the Earth
&gt; begins to enter an extreme period of global warming.  It is so severe

&gt; and the Earth looks something like this;

&gt; http://www.exitmundi.nl/images/sealeveleuropeMap.jpg

&gt; (Europe is not quite this bad, but close.)

&gt; What is the 18th, and 19th century going to be like in a time of
&gt; intense global warming?

&gt; Famine for large numbers of people in Europe obviously,
">

This is not altogether obvious, since the world during these
time periods is dealing with a lesser population, which
still, admittably, might expand in different proportions
and to different areas, based the agricultural capability
both possible to be generated in Europe, Asia, and
other areas.  As well as, of course, simply what's
under water.

This seems a likely possibility throughout time, it
also might be a spur to greater emigration.

I think that a lot of estimates predict that Greenland
holds about 5-8 meters of potential sea level water
rise, West Antarctica holds about the same since
a lot of its ice is already under water, and East
Antarctica holds about 50-90m.  A lot of future
global warming scenarios over the next century
or so tend to only go so far as to say about
half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica.

It would have to get Very hot to melt the entire
East Antarctic ice sheet that quickly, and
the climate change needed to do that would
probably cause much greater changes than
the ocean level rise would.

Submerging England, but keeping Scotland
and Wales above water, submerging
all of the Netherlands, Denmark, and
northern Germany, but keeping much of
Scandinavia and northern Russia above
water, however, is also going to have
profound effects.  Is southern Europe
and OTL's southeastern United States
equivalent going to become desert?  I would
guess under these scenarios sailing from
northern Europe to Asia via the Arctic and the
mass migration of settlers to Canada
rathern the United States, making
ATL's US a small appendage of
Canada if it exists at all, is pretty much
a given.

Beyond that it is much harder to say.

Given the state of the world at 1700,
the POD, with Spain, the Netherlands,
England, and France already having
far flung world empires and the fact
that the climactic effects are going
to come first, and the sea level rise
might come later in the ATL, well,
again it is hard to say.  One should
be reminded that the defeat of the
Spanish Armada and the 30 years
war is going to still be at least
half a century if not more before the
POD.

I think that critical questions would
be - what becomes desert, what
becomes tropical and wetter in
both tropical and tempreate regions,
and how is the growing season
affected in northern regions on
what time frames, and exactly
when do the Netherlands, Denmark,
Northern Germany, and England
gradually submerge below the
sea?

It might be reasonable to say that
the ATL Canada in this scenario
might become the equivalent of
the OTL United States with the
ATL land area of the U.S. becoming
a southern appendage of Canada,
but beyond that it is harder to
speculate.

&gt; but is this
&gt; enough to stop the industrial revolution?  (It's my opinion that the
&gt; Industrial Revolution was the biggest event of the last 1000 years, so
&gt; if it is aborted or not is a rather important question, even for a TL
&gt; that sees as much disruption as this one.)

&gt; How will China handle the loss of a rather big chunk of it's territory
&gt; to the ocean?  The 18th and 19th centuries were not good to China in
&gt; OTL, is this enough to make China completely collapse?
">

If in this ATL Europe shrivels up and dies then the emperors
are probably going to remain in China a lot longer, even if it
were to turn into desert and shrink in size, however imposing
the POD at 1700 makes a lot of things rather nebulous.

&gt; significant force or will they be too busy at home?

&gt; Will this intense global warming significantly help Russia by opening
&gt; up a lot of farmland, or would the other effects negate that
&gt; advantage?

&gt; How fairs the Ottoman Empire?
">

Hard to say.  Does the middle east remain a
desert, or does it become lush and tropical?
If Saudi Arabia gradually becomes inundated
by tropical rains and monsoons it is not going
to somehow become a tropical rainforest
filled with tigers and monkeys, however it is
probably going to have some effects on
the region as a whole.

&gt;&gt; Coke \Coke\, n. [Perh. akin to cake, n.] Mineral coal charred, or
&gt;&gt; depriver of its bitumen, sulphur, or other volatile matter by
&gt;&gt; roasting
&gt;&gt; in a kiln or oven, or by distillation, as in gas works. It is
&gt;&gt; largely
&gt;&gt; used where smokeless fire is required. [Written also coak]

&gt;Precisely, it is coked, not coaked.

Are, you are a lying sack of shit.

You deliberately deleted the bit ...

[Written also coak]

... which shows you to *be* an idiot ... or a liar. Personally, I
believe its fairly obvious that you are merely a liar.

And wrong, of course.

Obviously being a lying sack of shit suits you greatly ... does it
dribble out your ears as you drool all over your vocoder?

It must.
