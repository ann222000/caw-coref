I (like everyone else) am considering purchasing a plane. I've looked
up the cost of ownership in this group and came up with some good
information. However, I'm looking for a spreadsheet that I can plug
the numbers into. Has anyone either made this or know where to
download one? It's probebly not hard to do but I thought I would look
here first. Anybody? Anybody? Anybody?

I know there are guys here who have just the spreadsheet you're
looking for, but I've found that I'm much happier when I don't analyze
it too closely.

You can really keep your costs down by doing most of your regular
maintenance yourself.  Oil changes, etc, can all be done by the owner,
and that really adds up over time.

When you want to know how much money it costs to feed an airplane,
just figure "all of it", and you'll be close to right...

AOPA has a couple worksheets on their ownership/partnership page.
Just yesterday I figured our ownership &amp; operating costs for the Aztec over
the past 2.5 years.
I didn't hit the floor too hard.

Lou -- there are fixed costs (hangar, insurance, mortgage if needed)
and variable costs. The fixed costs are easy. The variable are not.

Variable:
fuel &amp; oil
repairs, maintenance,improvements
ADs
Unexpected and surprising costs!

And, as Jay points out, you can do a fair amount of work (Preventive
Maintenance, as per the FAA) yourself. But then you need to make sure
you have tools and equipment to do this. More costs.

On the other hand, if you really total up and make realistic estimates
of a budget, you'll probably decide not to buy an airplane.

"If you have to ask..."

It costs a lot.  The airshares program seems to be reasonably set up.
At first glance it seems expensive though.  They did the work for
you/everyone.  Check out their pricing.  If you can't afford at least a
third to half of that program, you probably have to walk away or find
more co-owners.

http://www.airshareselite.com/airportsServed/documents/asma_NY_SR22_P...

It is a commitment to own a plane.

I would not trade it for the world.  Good to see you are doing your
homework.

Ownership is cheap, maintaining one is expensive. I used to keep a
spread sheet of my budget and expensive. I quit after a couple of years.
If my balance got too low I knew I was getting in trouble. I didn't need
to know the details.

Lou,

It varies tremendously but the one constant is that airplane ownership
is EXPENSIVE when compared against renting. That is unless you fly 200
hours a year (most pilots average 50-75 hours a year).

I don't know about other folks but I have owned for only 3 years so I
don't have much experience but here is what I found.

For a 2 way partnership in a 100k Mooney it costs me about 1000 a month
to fly 5 hours a month. This includes all my fixed costs of $575 (plane
note, hanger rent, XM weather subscription and insurance). We charge
ourselves $85 per tach hour wet. This includes engine reserve, fuel and
some cash put back for annual inspection expenses.

Our first 3 annual's averaged $5000. We have had several times in the
last 3 years where we have had to shell out $1000 here and $1000 there
for things that broke. We like to keep the plane squawk-free so this
could have been cheaper.

Here is the sad part. For me I have come to the realization that I don't
want to shell out this much cash for flying anymore and am offering my
partner the buy-out deal of a lifetime. I am going back to renting but
will probably take a break from flying all together.

Good luck with whatever you do but realize that it will cost you a LOT
more money to own than to rent. That is just a plain and simple fact.

Jon is correct and this goes for motor homes, boats, and any big ticket
item. It is better to rent than own. However, on that day after two
weeks of lousy weather, YOU can go to the hangar and pull out YOUR
airplane and not be told by the FBO that all the planes are out til
9:00PM tonight.

I have had my Skyhawk for 10 years and I paid cash and it is a cheaper
plane than a Mooney, but this is all relative to you disposable cash. I
do owner assisted annuals and that saves. I did have to change out the
O-360 4 years ago and had to get a loan for that (no reserve planning).

My kids are out of college and on their own and I have no college
expenses from that. House is almost paid for and we both work. However,
I am getting close to retirement and my thinking may change. I may try
to get a partner or just sell. What I need is a workaholic partner that
pays the money but does not have time to fly.

Its true that owning almost always costs more than renting. However,
the benefit of owning is having a plane set up the way you want it.
There are a lot of reasons to own a plane but none of them are
financial.

Usually when a prospective owner talks to me about how much it costs

That's funny.  I came to a similar conclusion.  I could just as easily
throw $10 or $20 out the window every day of the year and be about even
for the year.  That does not include the fuel.

I was appalled at the airshares offer I received in the mail.  I was
going to talk to the rep about how ridiculously they priced their rates.
Then I started evaluating how much it REALLY costs me to own/operate
my own plane...  Well, airshares started looking A LOT better.

I stopped tracking my costs.  HEad in the sand for now with me.

There are very few absolute truisms in life.  I believe I know two of them:

1.  If it flies, floats, or fornicates it is far cheaper to rent.

2.  If it has tires, tits, or testicles it will eventually give you trouble.

Having said that, you don't need a $100K Super Bugsmasher as your first
airplane.  There are tens of thousands of elderly 150s, 172s, Cherokees, and
the like that may not have the sex appeal of a 200 knot bent-gear aircraft,
but they will not eat your pocketbook for lunch either.

You don't need a hopped up 172 with a 200 horse twisty prop to get you to
your Sunday fly-in.  The elderly 150 may not get you there in fifteen
minutes ... might take half an hour ... but 90% of the fun of a fly-in is
getting there.  Same with most of life.

Depending on whether you are a low wing wimp or a high wing manly guy, you
can start off with a Tripacer (Piper's Milkstool) and work your way up
through the ranks over the years to what you can afford.  You may have the
milkstool your whole career.  That's the way it goes.  Same with a 150 (or a
120/140 if you are a tailwheel kinda guy) and work your way up through the
170/172 series.

Yeah, after 40 years of the 120-170-172 gig I've got a 182.  It keeps me on
the edge of poverty, but it is what I can afford.  Do I drool at 210s?
Sure.  But I didn't jump into a Citation while the ink was still wet on my
private.

A partnership is a great way to own a plane. The hard part is getting
a partner with similar opinions on things such as upgrades,
maintenance, etc. Many times I've agreed to pay for 1/2 of something I
really didn't care to get but do it for the good of the partnership.
For me, the biggest reason to be in a partnership isn't cost but
rather usage. Flying a plane 50 hours a year is really hard on the
plane, hard on the engine, etc. Planes need to be flying and having a
partner can keep the plane in the air.

Wow! If I did my homework correctly, it would cost over 70k for the first
year to fly for only 100 hours.
Comparing that to my average rental cost of a new C182 with G1000 I would be
able to fly over
600 hours in that same year.

I guess I'll wait till I win the lottery.

Nice work. I played with it and it looked exciting (hmm, I think I can
fly 80 hours if I have to to break even) then I saw that there was no
place to plug in the costs of the aircraft loan.  Depressing to know

do better than my club.  Sigh. Off to buy more lotto tickets.

You could throw the interest in on one of the monthly or annual
expenses.  The value of the airplane itself is largely recoverable,
it's just not very liquid.  The spreadsheet does cover wear and tear
costs like engine reserve.

Perhaps someone else can make a spreadsheet that covers all the
variations in aircraft financing.

Using that work sheet, our Aztec initially comes in at $10 more per hour
than our actual operating costs incurred over 475 hours and 2 1/2 years.
However, the worksheet does not account for maintenance between annual
inspections, which in our case, amounts to $29 per hour flown.  If I add $29
per hour flown to the annual cost the worksheet shows our Total per hour is
$10 less than actual.  It's amazingly close either way and we break even vs.
renting at 68 hours per year.

Forget the spreadsheet.  The single most important thing you should do
as an owner is to fly a lot.  150+ hr a year.  200+ hr is even
better.  Do that for a few years, and if your funds is getting low,
sell the plane and you can say to youself that you had owned a plane
once, flew to many interesting places, and it didn't cost you more
than renting, and you were able to make trips that a renter won't be
able to do.  Mortgage your house if you have to, but you *must* keep
flying a lot of hours a year as long as you own it.  It's worth it.

The worst thing you can do as a owner is to let the maintenance cost
eat up all your gas money, and you ended up keeping a hangar queen for

A far worse injustice is leveled on many airplanes. Namely, the owner
cannot really afford the plane so they choose to buy gas to fly around

In either case, if you have to ask, you likely cannot afford it. Those

Airplane ownership is NOT like a car or boat. You are not an owner, but
a temporary steward of an increasingly rare object. I consider it my

Repairs, absolutely.  Upgrades?  I'd rather see owners skip that
GNS430 install and use that money to fly across the country three
times and visiting places.  Of course it would be nice to do both, but
most people had to choose one vs. another.  A lot of owners chose to
be a curator instead of an aviator.

The problem with GA isn't people not taking care of old planes.  It's
people not flying enough.  Unless your plane is a P-51, I don't see
anything wrong with old plane gets used up and eventually goes to
junkyard if it's used up for good reasons, like 20,000 hr on the wing
spar.  The problem with GA isn't people not taking care of old
planes.  It's people not flying nearly enough.  If GA flying hour is
10x of today and all the old planes get used up in about 10 years,
we'll have a much healthier GA industry and the new planes are likely
to be less than half of what they cost today because of the large
volume production.

The SR22 is expensive and the insurance is quite high. Local couple

with one being close to $5000 due to a bunch of ADs all coming due the

and some other things.

Prior tot he cost of gas going up I was runing about $76 or so an
hour.  Gas has gone up less than a dollar a gallon here, but at a one
dollar increase that'd be $90 per hour. That cost includes everything
including annuals and $10 toward a major which is getting close.  I

That I don't believe, but it depends on how much you fly.  At 100
hours a year it's cheaper for me to own the Deb than rent a 172 around

Lou's right. Owners may not be able to predict every dime they will spend
but they need to do at least a general assessment of the financial
requirements. Every book on ownership [rightly] says to do this. I remember
seriously thinking about getting a Lake Amphibian as my first airplane
because of visions of landing on the lake at my folks' house. I didn't have
to crunch too many numbers to get that idea outa my head.

Now I use my spreadsheet to plan for a possible upgrade in airframes. With
requirement of six seats, I know the approximate costs in buying and
maintaining a Saratoga or an 36-series Bonanza. I don't know when I'll be
able to jump into it, but at least I can be sure I won't jump into it too
early.

Not a dime. Unless soemthing happens to it during the build process before
first flight. In that case insurance will pay my $15/hr up to the insured
hull value.

What kept me from buying at first was the idea that if I didn't fly at least
100+ hours a year, owning didn't make sense.  I never flew 100+ hours a year
as a renter because paying the hourly rates discouraged me from using the
plane for anything other than local flights.  Once I OWNED the plane, the
100+ hours per year came naturally because  it became a hobby and a social
thing, flying with the guys out to breakfast every weekend and taking long
flights occasionally to visit relatives, go to Osh etc.
If you love to fly you practically owe it to yourself to own a plane.  You
just need a plane and a plan that fits your budget, whether it's a simple
one shared with someone else or a complex one exclusively yours.

&gt; Forget the spreadsheet.  The single most important thing you should do
&gt; as an owner is to fly a lot.  150+ hr a year.  200+ hr is even
&gt; better.  Do that for a few years, and if your funds is getting low,
&gt; sell the plane and you can say to youself that you had owned a plane
&gt; once, flew to many interesting places, and it didn't cost you more
&gt; than renting, and you were able to make trips that a renter won't be
&gt; able to do.  Mortgage your house if you have to, but you *must* keep
&gt; flying a lot of hours a year as long as you own it.  It's worth it.

&gt; The worst thing you can do as a owner is to let the maintenance cost
&gt; eat up all your gas money, and you ended up keeping a hangar queen for
&gt; the next owner, one with a rusty engine no less.  There's nothing
&gt; sadder than that.

I must say that I think you hit the nail on the head... My mistake was
getting the Super Bug Smasher as my first plane. Although I could easily
afford it, I found that I wasn't flying enough to justify the cost.

For my life situation I chose to get out of the ownership hassles (and
there are many) and persue other interests. Flying is a hobby of
extremes. At one end is the beauty and excitement of the flying
experience itself. At the other end is the extreme expense and endless
red-tape involved in even the simplest of repairs or upgrades.

And of course after you fork over many AMU's on a repair or upgrade you
hear the horror stories of some inept A &amp; P that fucks up your plane and
there isn't a damn thing you can do about it, except pay the bill to fix
it that is.
