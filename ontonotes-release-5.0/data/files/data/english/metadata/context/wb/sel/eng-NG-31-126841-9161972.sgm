How Do We Cure a Sick Health Care  System?
By Terrence McNally, AlterNet
Posted  on September 4, 2007, Printed on September 4,  2007
http://www.alternet.org/story/61115/

Every day, millions of hard-working people struggle to find affordable
medical treatment for themselves and their families -- unable to pay for
prescription drugs and regular check-ups, let alone for hospital visits.  Some of these
people end up losing money. Others end up losing their  health or even their
lives.
The United States is the only country in the developed world that does  not
guarantee access to medical care as a right of citizenship. As  outrageous as
that fact is, why is it so? What does it mean in the lives  of individual
Americans and their families? And what can we do about  it?
Like Michael Moore's critically and commercially successful  documentary,
SiCKO, Jonathan Cohn's new book, SICK probes  the larger problems by focusing on
the stories of individuals -- most of  them working members of the middle
class -- who are cruelly let down by  our failing system.
Jonathan Cohn is a senior editor at The New Republic, where he  has been
since 1997. Prior to that, Jonathan worked for six years at  The American
Prospect, where he remains a contributing editor. A  senior fellow at Demos, Cohn has
also written for many other publications,  and is the author of _SICK: The
Untold Story Of America's Health Care Crisis -- And The People Who Pay The
Price_ ( http://www.sickthebook.com/ ) .
Terrence McNally: How did you grow to focus as much as you do on  health
care?
Jonathan Cohn: It happened a little bit by accident. In the 1990s, I  was
working at The New Republic both as an editor and a writer, and  picked up some
stories about health care here and there along the way.  This was in the years
not that long after the fight over the Clinton  health care plan. People in
Washington really didn't want to talk very  much about health care, and the
country wasn't in the mood for another big  health care debate. As I started
learning about the issue, it quickly  became apparent that all the problems that
had led to that earlier debate  hadn't gone away. In fact, they were getting
steadily worse. As I read  more about the history of health care in this country,
I learned that we  keep coming back to this debate every 10 to 20 years.
In Washington we talk about numbers, and we have lots of jargon to  refer to
this policy and that policy -- &quot;the crowd-out effect&quot; and  &quot;reimbursement
levels.&quot; That's all well and good, but for too long not  enough people have cared
enough about health care politics to actually  make a change. I set out to
write a book that could build a bridge between  the world of policy and the world
of everyday lives.
TM: You said there haven't been enough people caring enough to fix  health
care. To me, that's similar to the War on Drugs. I believe many  people agree
that drug prohibition doesn't work, but changing it isn't one  of their top
priorities. On the other side, however, there's a moneyed  interest group -- the
correctional unions and the corrections industry --  for whom the status quo is
issue number one. In health care, you have a  diffuse bunch of people who
know something's wrong versus a single minded  and well-financed group for whom
preserving the status quo is their number  one priority -- so far, in both
cases, that's a losing battle.
JC: I'm hardly an expert on the drug war, so it would be wrong of me to
really weigh in on that. But I think your description of the way the fight  over
health care has played out in this country is very true.
If you look over the history going back to the 1920s, which is really  when
our insurance system comes into existence, the roster of people  opposed to
change has evolved slightly. In general, some constellation of  the insurance
industry, drug industry, hospitals and doctors move in and  out of the list,
depending on what period you're talking about and what  particular issue.
People who are making a lot of money off the way we provide health care  now
don't want to change the system, and the number of Americans who find  this
situation a personal threat to their livelihoods and to their lives  has not
been large enough to overcome that.
TM: Not large enough or powerful enough.
JC: Exactly. I'm one of those people who would love there to be a world
where somehow we could limit the power of corporations and special  interest
groups. I'm all in favor of things like campaign finance reform.  But, I don't
think we're likely to achieve that in the next two to three  years, so it's
incumbent upon us to fortify the support.
You know, polls generally find people in favor of universal health  care.
It's a very nice sounding idea. Everybody likes to think that health  care is a
right. But when the fights start, people get cold feet. They say  maybe it'll
mean I have to pay higher taxes or whatever, and they back  off. Work has to be
done on the organizing front.
TM: The nurses union in California put forth a public financing  initiative,
which many believe was intended as a precursor to single payer  health care --
and they failed. Are we unlikely to see single payer health  care unless we
can mobilize the power of numbers to defeat the power of  dollars.
JC: I believe in public financing of campaigns, but I don't think at  the end
of the day you'll ever really tip the balance in favor of the  people.
Business groups with money are going to find a way to influence  politics. I think
that's a reality, there's nothing we can do about  it.
I spend a lot of time looking at history. What happened in 1993 and  1994?
What happened in the 1940s when Harry Truman tried it? What happened  in the
1960s when Lyndon Johnson succeeded, when the Democrats in Congress  created
Medicare and Medicaid?
Compare today and '94 for example. Two differences stand out that I  think
might be really important in the next few months. The business  community has
traditionally been lukewarm at best, but pockets of the  business community are
now not only coming out in favor of universal  health care, they actually seem
committed to putting some muscle into  making it happen.
I think this is not because they're particularly benevolent or because
they've become quasi-socialists overnight. They see this as a bottom line  issue.
They're sick of paying for these benefits. I think they've come to  the
conclusion that they're better off if somebody takes this off their  hands.
The other positive difference is that groups like the nurses in  California,
like SEIU, the Service Employees Union, are really putting a  lot of time and
energy into organizing around this.
It's very easy to focus on all the people in '94 who were against  reform --
pharmaceutical companies, the health insurance associations, the  people who
gave us &quot;Harry and Louise&quot; -- but the big problem back then was  the lack of
push on the other side. During the 1990s, when Clinton was  rolling out his
health care plans, he was also pushing NAFTA. The unions  were so busy fighting
him on NAFTA that they didn't have the stomach or  the resources to really
support him on universal health care.
TM: So they were at best lukewarm allies.
JC: Yes, exactly. Going forward, I hope that whoever is going to push  this
in the next few years would think more strategically about how to  build
support -- because that's what it's going to take.
TM: With regard to the business community, one of the statistics  that we
hear a lot is that every automobile that comes off an assembly  line in our
beleaguered American auto manufacturers includes $1500 or more  for health care.
Their Japanese, Korean and German rivals don't bear that  cost because those
countries have universal health care. For the first  time ever, in July foreign
cars outsold domestic cars in America.
JC: I live in Michigan so this is a local story for me. People throw  around
these numbers pretty easily, so whether it's $1500 or what have  you, it's
unquestionably true that the older industrial companies  committed themselves to
providing a certain level of benefits that their  competitors abroad do not
have to provide.
In California, the grocery strike from a couple of years ago was all  about
health benefits. The grocers feared that Wal-Mart was coming in and  was not
obligated to pay its non-unionized employees health benefits. I  think most
people concluded that the grocers basically won that strike.  The existing union
workers at grocery stores got to keep their benefits,  but new workers don't
and over time, they'll all see the benefits go  down.
TM: Yes, they ended up with a two-tier system of those who were
grandfathered and those who were not.
JC: Which was a pretty big concession from the union. The irony is, one  of
the grocers, Steve Bird, the CEO of Safeway, is probably the most  recognizable
face who's come out very enthusiastically for universal  health care. Now
it's easy to sort of roll your eyes and say &quot;Oh, he's  just looking for PR,&quot; but
I can tell you, I've written about this guy,  he's put a lot of energy into i
t.
His ideas of universal health care are a little different than mine --  in
terms of what kind of benefits should be provided and who exactly  should
administer them. But a few months ago when Senator Ron Wyden, a  Democrat from
Oregon and a very committed advocate of what I would call  good universal health
care, got up to introduce his plan, Steve Bird was  standing right next to him,
saying this is basically a good idea and we  need to go forward with it.
TM: Your book covers the history well. Let's talk for a moment about  why
health care in the United States is linked to employment.
I've read it goes back to World War II, when there were wage and price
controls and a labor shortage. Not allowed to compete on wages, one of the
competitive perks a company could offer was health insurance. Then, though  Truman,
Nixon, Johnson, all wanted to go toward universal health care, we  ended up
with a gerry-rigged system. While America's manufacturing base  and its unions
were strong and workers were less mobile, it seemed to  work, but it doesn't
make much sense anymore.
JC: There are lots of historical circumstances along the way that  encouraged
and propelled it down this path. There was a very logical  reason why at the
end of the day we came to the corporations. The reality  is that to make
health insurance work you need a group of people.
TM: You need a large pool.
JC: At any one time you have a bunch of people who are healthy, and you  have
a few people who are unhealthy and have very large medical bills.  Money from
people who are healthy covers the expenses of those who are  sick. That's the
whole point of insurance.
You need a sort of randomly selected group of people, that's the only  way
insurance can work. This is one of the reasons that every other  developed
country has eventually said &quot;Look, the most logical way to do  this is to take the
largest pool, get the whole country contributing, so  we're all in this
together.
When we started this conversation about health insurance in the 20s and  the
30s, there were people talking about having national health insurance  as part
of the New Deal along with the Social Security Act. At that time  the AMA was
very opposed, and so we didn't get national health insurance.  But they had
to come up with some other way to do it. If you're looking  for large groups of
people in society, where are you going to find them?  The workplace.
TM: Why do you believe people are made so easily afraid of single  payer
universal health care? Let me suggest that it's because of the way  it's been
defined and defamed. People talk about being for or against  &quot;government health
care,&quot; when, in fact, we're really talking about  &quot;government health insurance.&quot;
JC: That's absolutely right. Universal health care, single payer health
care, is a term that a lot of people consider radioactive. But no one's  talking
about taking all the doctors and hospitals in the country and  turning them
into government employees like you find at the Post Office.  The irony, however,
is that some of the best health care in America -- if  you believe the experts
-- is actually the VA, an example of doctors paid  by the government.
But let's leave that out, because we're a long way from creating that  for
the rest of the country. Single payer health insurance basically means  that the
government provides health insurance to everybody. These are  still private
doctors and private hospitals. You can even have universal  health care that is
not single payer. I mean if you're really wedded to  this idea that you can't
have the government be the insurer, you could do  it through private
insurance. I think at the end of the day it's less  efficient, but it can be done that
way too.
If the idea of government run health insurance sounds really scary to  you,
then ask yourself what is the most popular health insurance program  in the
United States today, the one that everybody treasures, that if you  take polls
and ask people, are you happy with your health insurance, you  get the highest
positive response? It's Medicare. And who runs Medicare?  The federal
government.
TM: Exactly. Why the disconnect?
JC: I can tell you, in my own interviews people say, &quot;Don't let the
government get its hands on my Medicare.&quot; Now that's a disconnect.
I think there's two things going on: In America -- and this goes back  to the
founding of the country, back to why we're different than Europe,  back to
the 17th century -- we're more independent-minded and more  suspicious of the
State.
That's one part of it, but another is that we've spent the last 20 to  30
years in a fairly conservative era, hearing over and over again that  the
government screws things up, the government can't do anything right,  the private
sector is better, business is better. This has been drummed  into our heads.
TM: ... When you link that to the confusion between insurance and  care ...
JC: It's a very combustible mix.
You can argue about other parts of the economy, but on health care I  think
the evidence is unambiguous. The government does it better. That's  true here,
and it's true abroad.
There's obviously a demonization of national health insurance abroad --
which takes by the way 30,000 different forms. Every country does it in a
different way that meets its own cultural preferences. But look at  Germany, France,
Switzerland and Japan -- four countries who do health  insurance in radically
different ways. All of them manage to provide their  citizens with good care,
and cutting edge -- when they need it. Nobody  seems to do preventive care
that well, but there they're as good as we  are.
All these countries have convenience, they have choice of doctor, they  cover
everybody and they spend less than we do. To hear conservative  predictions,
you would think that to have universal health care means  you're going to have
to wait five months to get treatment for your heart  attack, you could never
choose your own doctor, and you'd be paying all of  your money in taxes.
TM: What's the overhead in private health insurance in this country  that
goes to insurance, marketing, administration etc.? ... Something like  21, 22
percent?
JC: It depends on the insurer. The best, the most efficient are down to  10,
12, 15 percent, but in general you're talking 15, 20, 25, 30  percent.
TM: And Medicare?
JC: Two to three percent.
TM: How much of our GDP do we pay on health care compared to Canada?  The
last time I looked it was over 15 percent here and around 10 percent  there.
JC: Yes, I think we're at three or four percent GDP more than  Canada.
TM: That means we've got a fudge factor equal to four percent of our  GDP.
Our GDP is enormous. You can ask how long do they wait or how much do  they
ration? But then you have to look at the fact that we would have four  percent of
our GDP to pick up the slack. Do you agree?
JC: Absolutely, no question.
TM: Finally, I believe you can't counter a good story -- even a  false one --
with facts. As persuasive as those numbers we just laid out  might be, you
have to do it with stories. Though your book fills in the  policy questions and
the history -- like Michael Moore's movie,  SiCKO -- it focuses on personal
stories, especially of working and  middle-class folks who probably believed
they were going to be  okay.
JC: At the end of the day, people are going to ask, &quot;How would  universal
health care affect me?&quot; You can throw all the statistics in the  world out there,
but I think stories are finally going to get people's  attention -- which is
why I wrote the book the way I did. They'll remember  a story.
I hope that they read my book or see Michael Moore's movie, and say,  &quot;Oh,
that could be me ... But for a little bit of luck here or there, I  could have
gone through that ... And this is not fair. It shouldn't have  happened to that
person, and I don't want it happening to me. This is  wrong. We need to
change it.&quot;
Personal narrative has the power to make seemingly abstract numbers and
figures suddenly seem personal. I think that's really the whole ball game.
