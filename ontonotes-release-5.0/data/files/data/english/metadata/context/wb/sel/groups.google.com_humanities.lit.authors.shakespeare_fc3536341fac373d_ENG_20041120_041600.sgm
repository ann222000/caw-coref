VVhen in disgrace with Fortune and mens eyes,
I all alone beweepe my out-cast state,
And trouble deafe heauen with my bootlesse cries,
And looke vpon my selfe and curse my fate.
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featur'd like him,like him with friends possest,
Desiring this mans art,and that mans skope,
With what I most inioy contented least,
Yet in these thoughts my selfe almost despising,
Haplye I thinke on thee, and then my state,
(Like to the Larke at breake of daye arising)
From sullen earth sings himns at Heauens gate,
For thy sweet loue remembred such welth brings,
That then I skorne to change my state with Kings.

When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on thee, and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

Bacon's fortunes rose and fell at the whim
of Fortune (Elizabeth). His stipend was abruptly
cut off when he successfully opposed the Triple
Subsidy which would have only excalated starvation
among the English during years of famine.

Bacon went to debtors prison twice for taking
the high moral ground and it was the very moral
principles that secured for him crowds of loyal friends
that ironically cost him estates and offices.

The Tudors were morally primitive.

Henry executed inconvenient wives and Elizabeth
executed inconvenient earls while both profited from
it. It's ironic that Bacon got such careful moral
training from Elizabeth's head lady-in-waiting while
Elizabeth lacked any.

that I would treat with contempt an offer to change places
with a king.

The poem starts sad and ends happy by means of a single
stunning metaphor.

Line 1, 'When'. This is not what he is experiencing at this
moment. It is 'recollected in tranquillity', as Wordsworth
said. Shakespeare often does this: there are ten sonnets
beginning 'when', exacerbating the compositor's shortage of
outsize capital Ws and forcing him to use VV or sometimes an
italic W.

The first four lines describe the speaker's actions as an
observer might. The next four are psychological, describing
his inner thoughts.

Line 7, 'Desiring this man's art'. Not what an aristocrat
would desire, or at least admit to desiring. Learning a
craft is not aristocratic. Compare the aristocrat who, asked
if he could play the violin, answered &quot;I don't know: I have
never tried&quot;.

Line 8. Remarkable how what you can actually do, once you
can do it well, comes to seem less desirable than the things
other people can do.

Line 10 prepares for the leap and at line 11 we have
lift-off - a marvellous effect. The lark is originally a
bird of the steppes. It nests in open ground and takes off
at dawn, not directly from its nest, singing as it goes and
soaring vertically until it becomes very hard to pick out
by eye, though it can still be clearly heard. It was common
until recently but is now increasingly rare.

Line 12, 'sullen'. Cognate with 'sole' and 'solitary',
implying morose ill-humour in people. Often also transferred
to other things, but here it looks more like a metaphor than
a specialised meaning. I suggest the earth is damp and cold
after the night, and also shaded because the rising sun has
not yet penetrated to the flat ground where the lark nests.

Line 14, 'scorn'. Picks up (I suggest) 'despising' from line
9 and turns it round: he now despises not himself but the
rest of the world.

'state'. This word has appeared three times. In line 2 it
means 'situation', the speaker's position in the world. In
line 10 it means 'state of mind'. In line 14 it comes back
close to its meaning in line 2, but also picks up ideas of
grandeur or stateliness from the kings - a good state this
time, when at the beginning it was wretched.

When I am out of luck, and out of favour with society, /
I sit on my own, mourning my loneliness /
and pester God, who is not listening, with useless prayers that will
not be answered /
and think about myself and condemn the situation to which I am
doomed; /
I think of people with better prospects and wish I was like them, /
as handsome as A, as popular as B; /
I wish I had C's skill or D's comprehensive knowledge, /
and the talents I value least are those I have most of. /
But when, thinking this way, I come nearest to contempt for
myself, /
sometimes I happen to think about you, and when I do that my mental
condition /
(like a lark that flies up at dawn /
from the gloomy ground) praises God in the sky. /
For when I remember that you love me, I feel so rich /
that I would not dream of exchanging my position for that of a

quibble I would have with Robert's fine paraphrase would be his
&quot;praises God in the sky&quot; for the poet's &quot;sings hymns at heaven's

the day--that is, the dawn again--which seems to be supported by
*Cymbeline*'s &quot;Hark! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,

sunrise rather than praises God in the sky. Does anyone know of
other, non-Shakespearean, usages of &quot;Heaven's gate&quot; which might lie

At the end of the First Sestiad of Marlowe's *Hero and
Leander* there is both a mention of the gate to Heaven
(to which one &quot;mounts aloft&quot;) and a reference to the
scholar/poet's relative poverty, which is at the Sonnet's
heart.

And but that Learning in despite of Fate
Will mount aloft and enter heaven gate
And to the seat of Jove itself advance,
Hermes had slept in hell with Ignorance.
Yet as a punishment they added this,
That he and Poverty should always kiss.
And to this day is every scholar poor;
Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor.

Fair enough. I did think it was pretty good for one of
us to have knocked off!

My comment was related mainly to those first two lines,
which seem (to me) quite clearly to refer to something
a little more grief-striking than a few bad days at the
office.

In fact this obviously continues the story which we have
been following since Sonnet 25, when (*pace* Buffalo) he
told us of some *unforeseen* happening which deprived
him in some way of the chance (whether he had it before-
hand or not) to boast of 'public honour and proud titles'.

In 26 - and I would suggest because of this, as he can't
'show his head' - he is on his travels, probably overseas:

* it is an 'ambassage', which is typically sent home
from overseas,
* there is a reference to astro-navigation, which we
tend not to use much on the M40,

27 and 28 have him moving ever further away, and the
grief he expresses seems so much more than would be
reasonable for a short separation while the company
is off 'on tour', or for a few days back in Stratford.

Now, in 29, we find out what fortune has done to him.
He is in *disgrace*, and he is an *outcast* and, in
view of the above, most probably banished.

day after day, their 'shrill delight' fell upon me out of

If the Queen was mad at you, you had no friends
because to have her turn Her Majesty turn her back
on you was to have all your friends turn their
backs on you. It was like a JW shunning although
done with more taste.

On the numerous occasions when Bacon got into
trouble with the queen be it James or Elizabeth,
Bacon was on his own, twice in debtor's prison
with no patrons who could bail him out.

When James reneged on The Pardon a hundred
knights on horseback defied the king and accompanied
Bacon's coach outside the verge but many of his
friends were forced to stop speaking to him, at
least those with places at Court.

Otherwise Bacon had more friends than any
historical figure I've encountered. A book on
Bacon's friendships would create an extensive
map of the culture of late Renaissance England.

"/>

All but one of the eleven instances of 'Fortune' in
the Sonnets are personified as opposed to 'fortune'
in the plays which almost always means luck or fate.

Elizabeth was 'Lady Fortune' in the sense that she
arbitrarily promoted and demoted favorites by
redistributing honors, titles and monopolies. She
enriched Dudley and Hatton and ruined Oxford,
Raleigh, Walsingham, Essex and others.

Since Southampton is the logical dedicatee of the
Sonnets (Rowse's theory that Mr. H.W. is William Hervey
is the most robust) it would mean the Sonnets were
written at Court.

O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds

The last two lines reflect the fact that Bacon, while
waiting for the promised appointment--promised
by Elizabeth but unfortunately not promised by
Burghley--had to take cases from the public and
argue them in the public courts accepting money
from members of the public.

Courtiers didn't do 'public work.'

Sonnet 111 reflects the fact that Southampton and
Essex furiously lobbied the Queen to give Bacon an
office:

A few months later Sir Robert Cecil attempted to persuade
Essex to be content with the Solicitor-General's office for
Bacon, which 'might be of easier digestion to her Majesty.'

'Digest me no digestions,' Essex angrily answered,
'for the Attorneyship for Francis is that I must have; and
in that I will spend all my power, might, authority, and amity,
and with tooth and nail defend and procure the same for
him against whom soever; and whosoever getteth this
office out of my hands for any other, before he have it,
it shall cost him the coming by.' In Queen Elizabeth,
J.E. Neale, Harcourt Brace.

Essex and Southampton were so obnoxious that in
the end the Queen told them to 'shut up and go to
bed' and she awarded the offices to Egerton and Coke.

Edgerton, twenty years older than Bacon, was a
working lawyer with a brilliant legal mind, after
the mature Bacon one of the finest lawyers
England ever produced while Coke, a klutz at law,
was assured advancement simply because he was
the Cecil protege.

As Stonehouse notes:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Stonehouse doesn't believe that Bacon wrote the
Sonnets but his interpretation is exactly right.

Elizabeth

***That the Poet's spirits are high at the thought of the addressee,
and that a soaring bird singing at dawn is consistent with this, is
true enough. But, particularly with the Cloten quote to consider, it
doesn't come through to me that &quot;heaven's gate&quot; necessarily implies
&quot;high&quot; any more than it does &quot;the commencing of dawn,&quot; both being
equally concerned with &quot;the heavens.&quot; In each case (Sonnet and
*Cymbeline*), it's dawn, and the lark is singing; but the elevation of
Cloten seems of a thoroughly different nature from that of our Poet,
earthly rather than spiritual. Marlowe's &quot;heaven gate&quot; (below; thanks
for the reference!) seems concerned with something else altogether.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Does anyone know of other, non-Shakespearean, usages
&gt;&gt; of &quot;Heaven's gate&quot; which might lie behind Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; usage of the term?

&gt; At the end of the First Sestiad of Marlowe's *Hero and
&gt; Leander* there is both a mention of the gate to Heaven
&gt; (to which one &quot;mounts aloft&quot;) and a reference to the
&gt; scholar/poet's relative poverty, which is at the Sonnet's
&gt; heart.

&gt; And but that Learning in despite of Fate
&gt; Will mount aloft and enter heaven gate
&gt; And to the seat of Jove itself advance,

&gt; Yet as a punishment they added this,
&gt; That he and Poverty should always kiss.
&gt; And to this day is every scholar poor;
&gt; Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor.

&gt;&gt; ***Hm. If the day's ingress comes via heaven's gate,
&gt;&gt; does the day's egress go via hell's gate? Well, come
&gt;&gt; to think of it, I *have* had days like that...

&gt; Haven't we all? But I think your basic premise is
&gt; wrong.

"/>

***Could be. But why &quot;heaven's gate&quot; here? In the Marlowe quote,
it's obvious that Learning is storming the palace of the gods; that
gate makes sense in the progression of ideas and images. Here, it's
less clear. Are we to consider that the welkin in general is a &quot;gate&quot;
to heavenly feelings? The lark, and the poet's spirits, could be
aloft, and indeed aloft in the heavens, without having to be at a gate
to be elevated. I see it more that the poet's spirit stands at the
eastern &quot;gate&quot; between night and day (perhaps I am influenced by 28)
at which gate each major section (night/day) of the 24 hours makes its
first appearance, and that, as the winging lark sings presumably for
joy at first light, so does the Poet's &quot;state&quot; sing joyful hymns of
thanksgiving at the spiritual sunrise brought about by thinking of the
addressee.

***On the subject of Heaven: This perhaps hasn't much to do with the
question of the &quot;gate,&quot; but Heaven is deaf in the third line of the
poem; I don't know that the poet's hymn-singing means much more to
deaf Heaven than did his bootless cries.

The style and humour here are so distinctive,
that there can be no doubt the author of this
poem is the same as that of the sonnets and
of the rest of the canon. But, one thing for
sure -- he was not a middle-class lad, wary
of upsetting his peers and patrons -- and to
whom the notion of mixing crude scatology
and cheeky bawdy with sublime poetry would

I am no more confident about that than anyone else
(except Paul) is here. I am inclined to think that
Southampton is probably the main contender (mainly
on the basis of the *V&amp;A* and *Lucrece* dedications)
but I have more recently wondered whether the first
seventeen (on stylometric grounds) and some of the
later ones might not have been addressed to William
Herbert instead.

I am quite convinced by Don Foster's argument that
&quot;Mr.W.H.&quot; refers to the *poet* rather than to either
an inspirer or procurer of the sonnets, however. The
initials can, of course, correspond to whatever name
he happened to be using at that time.

My main candidate for the &quot;Dark Lady&quot; currently is
a defrocked French nun called either Ide du Vault or
Madame Vallereine, who was employed at Burley on the
Hill at the same time as the Monsieur le Doux I have
just been discussing with 'Buffalo'.

Finally, I think it possible that the so-called
'dedication' at the start of the Sonnets is written
apparently by Thorpe but actually on behalf of
Southampton or Pembroke (either of whom could have
thought of themselves as adventurers &quot;setting forth&quot;
in 1609), the Sonnets and The Lover's Complaint
having been printed primarily as a gift for the
poet himself.

I find it extraordinary that people can be so
confident about their particular weird theory
about Shakespeare (with the weirdest being.
of course, the Stratfordian) while accepting
that they have only the vaguest of notions
as to what the sonnets are all about.

It is even more strange that when confronted
with a thoroughly worked-out (and directly
contradictory) solution for those sonnets
(specifying dates, people and events) they
they are so incapable of criticising any
aspect of it.

I don't agree with this at all, Robert, and find your argument forced.
First, an art is not a craft. Second, almost all the artists I know wish
they had the talent of someone else, especially if depressed, when their own
art appears to them to be inferior. And the poet is speaking here as an
artist, not as an aristocrat or commoner.

I apologise if this has already been said by someone else. Haven't had time

Art is not craft? I know an Art who is daft -- is that close enough?
Jesting aside, the &quot;craft of poetry&quot; (or of writing) is a very common
expression, and one often refers to an artist learning his or her craft.
Indeed, the University of Northern Iowa teaches a course called &quot;Craft
of poetry.&quot; Second, the OED suggests &quot;art&quot; as a synonym of &quot;craft.&quot;
Finally, as Art will no doubt tell you himself, the Craft refers to
Freemasonry. :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I all alone beweep my outcast state
&gt;&gt;&gt; I sit on my own and cry over my isolation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
&gt;&gt;&gt; and call uselessly on God, who does not hear, to come to my
&gt;&gt;&gt; help,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And look upon myself and curse my fate, 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; and consider my situation and complain of my lot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
&gt;&gt;&gt; wishing I was like some person who has better expectations,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
&gt;&gt;&gt; as handsome as another, with as many friends as a third,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
&gt;&gt;&gt; wanting the skill of one and the opportunities of another,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;With what I most enjoy contented least; 8
&gt;&gt;&gt; and least of all satisfied with the qualities I have most
&gt;&gt;&gt; of;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
&gt;&gt;&gt; still, while thinking like that and viewing myself almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; with contempt,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Haply I think on thee, and then my state
&gt;&gt;&gt; it may happen that you come into my thoughts, and then my
&gt;&gt;&gt; frame of mind
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Like to the lark at break of day arising
&gt;&gt;&gt; like a lark, soaring upwards at dawn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; 12
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the damp, dark ground, pours out sacred music in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sky just below Heaven ;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
&gt;&gt;&gt; for when I remember your dear love, it makes me so rich
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
&gt;&gt;&gt; that I would treat with contempt an offer to change places
&gt;&gt;&gt; with a king.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The poem starts sad and ends happy by means of a single
&gt;&gt;&gt; stunning metaphor.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Line 1, 'When'. This is not what he is experiencing at this
&gt;&gt;&gt; moment. It is 'recollected in tranquillity', as Wordsworth
&gt;&gt;&gt; said. Shakespeare often does this: there are ten sonnets
&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning 'when', exacerbating the compositor's shortage of
&gt;&gt;&gt; outsize capital Ws and forcing him to use VV or sometimes an
&gt;&gt;&gt; italic W.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The first four lines describe the speaker's actions as an
&gt;&gt;&gt; observer might. The next four are psychological, describing
&gt;&gt;&gt; his inner thoughts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Line 7, 'Desiring this man's art'. Not what an aristocrat
&gt;&gt;&gt; would desire, or at least admit to desiring. Learning a
&gt;&gt;&gt; craft is not aristocratic.

&gt;&gt; I don't agree with this at all, Robert, and find your argument forced.
&gt;&gt; First, an art is not a craft.

&gt; Art is not craft? I know an Art who is daft -- is that close enough?
&gt; Jesting aside, the &quot;craft of poetry&quot; (or of writing) is a very common
&gt; expression, and one often refers to an artist learning his or her craft.
&gt; Indeed, the University of Northern Iowa teaches a course called &quot;Craft
&gt; of poetry.&quot; Second, the OED suggests &quot;art&quot; as a synonym of &quot;craft.&quot;
&gt; Finally, as Art will no doubt tell you himself, the Craft refers to
&gt; Freemasonry. :-)

"/>

I agree with *almost* everything you say, David; however, with regard to
common usage, &quot;honing or practicing one's craft&quot; does not in the least mean
the same thing as &quot;learning a craft,&quot; which is the phrase that Robert used.
Learning a craft, in the sense of carving souvenir images of WS of Stratford
out of hardened reclaimed bubblegum or fashioning cartoon animals out of
inflated pigs' bladders, may well not be aristocratic, but I understand that
writing poetry is usually quite acceptable. Depends on the subject matter,
of course.

Whereupon I searched for &quot;poetry craft&quot; and found that poetry is
taught as being both: the craft part is managing composition
principles, language, forms, genre, and especially sound and imagery;
the art part is about the whole being more than the parts, involving
inspiration, fancy, imagination, transcending subject matter and
moving emotions, etc.. bb

&quot;A poem is that species of composition . . . . (snip

WILLIAM WORDSWORTH (from Preface to Lyrical Ballads):
&quot;Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its
origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the emotion is
contemplated till, by a species of reaction, the tranquillity
gradually disappears, and an emotion, kindred to that which was the
subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does itself
actually exist in the mind.&quot;

&quot;Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge; it is the
impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science.
Emphatically it may be said of the poet, as Shakespeare has said of
man, &quot;that he looks before and after.&quot; (snip)

&quot;A piece of writing is poetic when it:&quot;

1. Sings
2. Moves
3. Shimmers
4. Cracks the whip
5. Has an undefinable &quot;woo woo&quot; quality
6. Recreates the early childhood pleasures of moon, Mom, and mud
7. Forces an epiphany
8. Imitates nature
9. Contains the music of plain speech
10. Marries sound and meaning
11. Just sounds good
12. Shatters self-important, secluded views of the world
13. Snaps you into a different state of mind
14. Sets off your indicator lights
15. Is the exact opposite of a gazebungle
16. Connects the reader with an interior &quot;otherness,&quot; sort of like
music
17. Brings the whole soul of man into activity
18. Offers the most accurate possible symbolic image of objects which
when they are actually seen cause distress (corpses, worms, etc.)
19. Instructs by pleasing
20. Proposes pleasure, not truth, as the immediate object of attention
21. Creates a sort of religious feeling

or press an ear against its hive.

I say drop a mouse into a poem
and watch him probe his way out,

or walk inside the poem's room
and feel the walls for a light switch.

I want them to waterski
across the surface of a poem
waving at the author's name on the shore.

But all they want to do
is tie the poem to a chair with rope
and torture a confession out of it.

They begin beating it with a hose

I think I agree with you on this. I also favour the comma. Otherwise &quot;When
in disgrace&quot; becomes a recurring condition, like &quot;When it rains&quot;. Of course,
it *might* be a recurring condition, if the poet is continually dropping
himself in the mire. But your interpretation is supported by the overall
syntax of the poem, whereas the other reading isn't. The &quot;when&quot; we have
here is part of a &quot;when/then&quot; progression, the &quot;then&quot; part starting with the
&quot;haply&quot; of line 10. *When* he does everything listed in lines 2-9, *then* he
haply thinks on thee. It's a &quot;when&quot; with a long reach. Without the comma,
the reach is drastically truncated, as these parallel sentences illustrate

&quot;When it rains, [then] I put up my umbrella&quot;
&quot;When in disgrace, [then] I all alone beweep&quot;

That means that the &quot;haply&quot; of line 10 is left hanging there, unable to
connect with anything, because the syntax is already finished. The &quot;then&quot;
has already been claimed.

I hope that isn't too obscure.

So what have we learned from Sonnet 29 that we
didn't already know?

The poet claims to be in an unfortunate life
position, which is redeemed only by his relationship with
the addressee.

***************************************************

The story so far:

So after twenty-nine sonnets, what do we know?

The addressee or referent of the first twenty-nine
sonnets is probably the same person (although it
has been speculated that perhaps the speaker of the first
seventeen poems is different). At any rate, we are assuming
that the same person is the addressee of these sonnets.

The speaker says the addressee is physically
attractive. The description of that beauty is in terms that
would seem more suitable to a woman than a man. (1 - 7, 9,
13, 17-19, especially 20)

The speaker says that the addressee is narcissistic.
(1 - 4, 6)

The speaker may be chiding the addressee's sexual
habits. (1 - 4, 6, 9)

The addressee is male. (3, 6, 9, 16, 19-20, 26)

The speaker is male. (20)

The addressee is of marriageable age, meaning (I
think) that he would be in the 17 - 26 age range. (1 - 4, 6,
8 - 13, 16, 17)

The speaker claims he has no interest in sexual
relations with the addressee. (20)

The speaker probably wasn't a member of the
nobility. (25) We still don't know which class the addressee
belong to. Some readers have suggested that certain words
and phrases used in the sonnets indicate that the addressee
is of noble birth.

The speaker's life involved travel that took him
away from the addressee. Possibly, the travel involved
service for the addressee. (27-28)

The speaker is preoccupied at night by images of the
addressee. (27-28)

The poet claims to be in an unfortunate life
position, which is redeemed only by his relationship with
the addressee. (29)

The speaker says the addressee has a pleasant
speaking voice and enjoys listening to sad music. (8)

The speaker says the addressee has a gracious and
kind presence. (10)

The speaker seems to think that the addressee has
some sort of love for the speaker. (10, 25)

The speaker seems to have some sort of affectionate
feelings for the addressee, calling him such things as
&quot;love&quot;, &quot;dear my love&quot;, &quot;master-mistress of my passion&quot; and
&quot;Lord of my love&quot;. (13, 19, 20-26)

These feelings are so strong that they leave the
speaker tongue-tied about those feelings in the presence of
the addressee. (23)

The speaker expresses humility about his ability to
express, in writing, his feelings for the addressee. (26)

The speaker is an aesthetic snob. (11)

The speaker may believe in astrology. (15)

The speaker initially thinks that having children is
a better method than a painting or a poem for the addressee
to preserve himself. (16, 17) However, the speaker comes to
say that he can preserve the beauty of the addressee in his
poetry (18, 19).

The speaker, having posed a problem for the
addressee, is offering a solution to that problem - namely
that the addressee should have children - specifically, a
son. (1-14, 16, 17). (But let's remember that it's only the
speaker's assertion that beautiful people have some sort of
obligation to the world to propagate or preserve their
beauty.)

The speaker seems mainly concerned with the
addressee's beauty, and not overly much with the addressee
as a person. (Exceptions: 10, 14, 16, 22)

While seeming to chastise the addressee for his
narcissistic failure to preserve or propagate his beauty,
the speaker is, at the same time, acknowledging that beauty,
and so is flattering the addressee.

We still don't know what the relationship is between
the speaker and the addressee.

One word descriptions of the sonnets:

1) Introduction; 2) Siege; 3) Mirror; 4) Usury; 5) Perfume;
6) Money-lending; 7) Sun; 8) Music; 9) Widow; 10) Self-hate;
11) Snob; 12) Breed; 13) Endless; 14) Astrology; 15)
Transience; 16) Lines; 17) Memorial; 18) Summer; 19)
Permanence; 20) Pricked; 21) True; 22) Hearts; 23)
Tongue-tied; 24) Eyes; 25) Constancy; 26) Humility; 27)
Travel; 28) Exhausted; 29) Remembrance;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Line 7, 'Desiring this man's art'. Not what an aristocrat
&gt;&gt; would desire, or at least admit to desiring. Learning a
&gt;&gt; craft is not aristocratic.

&gt;I don't agree with this at all, Robert, and find your argument forced.
&gt;First, an art is not a craft. Second, almost all the artists I know wish
&gt;they had the talent of someone else, especially if depressed, when their own
&gt;art appears to them to be inferior. And the poet is speaking here as an
&gt;artist, not as an aristocrat or commoner.

&gt;I apologise if this has already been said by someone else. Haven't had time
&gt;to read the whole thread yet.

&gt;Regards,
&gt;Lynne, still trying to catch up with the sonnets, which will no doubt wait
&gt;for her.

"/>

I get the feeling of &quot;time's winged chariot&quot;, but that is
because of the weekly deadline, which does not apply to the
rest of the world!

Now, first, an art IS a craft, in the origin of the idea.
The &quot;Art of Love&quot; is a technical manual, as is the Art of
Poetry. In the Middle Ages, arts were kept secret: 'The Art
and Mystery of Shoemaking'. Hence the Mystery plays: the
shepherds did the Nativity, the fishermen the Flood, the
carpenters the Crucifixion. Hence also Abhorson's protest in
Measure for Measure when people run down the art of the
executioner: 'I say, it is a Mystery!' (Albert Pierrepoint
in his memoirs calls it 'the craft'.) The idea that 'art'
was one thing and 'craft' a distinctly lower one may be no
older than the 19th century.

Secondly, it was not an aristocratic thing, at least when
taken seriously. Certainly Sidney (Apology for Poetry)
thinks his own attachment to poetry is a thing to be
concealed, or treated lightly with aristocratic disdain
('sprezzatura'). He accepts ambition in his career as a
politician, soldier and diplomat: never as a poet. It is
possible that 'art' in this poem means something different
from poetry, though there is no indication what that could
be. More likely, I may be over-interpreting - this is a bit
of a try-on, I admit.

When you are in trouble (or in pain) it will
usually FEEL as though it's a permanent,
never-ending state. Here, the poet is in
trouble, and he is expressing pain and the
feeling that it will never end. His addressee
fully understands his condition. He does
not have to explain it to her -- since she is
primarily responsible for it. He is merely
elaborating on aspects of it, and pleading
for relief.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But your interpretation is supported by the overall
&gt; syntax of the poem, whereas the other reading isn't.

The 'other reading' would be absurd in any
event. This is not a police report nor an
essay on what it is like to find oneself in
recurring situations of disgrace -- a quite
nonsensical suggestion.

&gt; The &quot;when&quot; we have

There could well be a full-stop at the end
line 8, (the end of the octet). The sestet
(lines 9-14) turns the sonnet around, but
that is a very common construction.

A comma after the first 'When' would

Forget the 'then'. It does not help.
&quot;When in disgrace (a) I all alone beweep,
(b) I trouble deaf heaven, (c) . . . (d) . . . &quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That means that the &quot;haply&quot; of line 10 is left hanging there

Ridiculous. The 'haply' is in an entirely new
part of the sonnet, and follows on from the
'Yet . . .' of line 9.

There is no need whatever for your 'long
reach'. The first 'When' does not create
any sense of uncertainty or anticipation.
The reader is not waiting for anything.

He needn't be &quot;continually dropping himself in the mire,&quot; but simply
subject
to depression. I think both readings equal. Which he was thinking of
seems irrelevant to me. He got a terrific sonnet done on the standard
sentiment of a loved one's being more than enough to offset the worst
depression.

Well, it might be relevant to particular anti-Strat theories. In the

investigation into his atheistic activities, and his subsequent banishment.

No, he SAYS &quot;in disgrace with FORTUNE.&quot; This is like saying, when my
luck is goin' bad. Fortune is mistreating him. LIFE is mistreating
him. AND he's in disgrace in the eyes of others. Others look down on
him. He weeps. That's a symptom of feeling ungood, Paul. He curses
his fate. He wishes he had the good future (the hope) of some luckier
person. Or the looks and friends. The good life, in other words.
Nothing really specific. He wants to be happy. He wants the skill in
art of someone gifted, or the scope or breadth of outlook of someone
else. He's not content with even the things he most enjoys. That's
not depression?

I haven't been following this thread, nor do I remember, if I ever

wish for all the different things he wishes for to cure some specific

It seems to me that Bob is doing that here. The poet says

reads it as in a &quot;downcast state&quot;. The two words have very

According to Gary, we have learned that &quot;the poet claims
to be in an unfortunate life position&quot;. Well maybe he does,
but he also says that he beweeps his outcast state. The
word outcast could be taken as a past participle, but with
the word 'state' it makes far more sense as a noun (ie his
state *as* an outcast rather his state as *being* outcast).
This is how 'outcast' is defined as a noun in the Shorter
OED.

A person 'cast out' or rejected; a pariah; an exile;
a homeless vagabond.

Just because it is difficult to relate this to what we
know of Shakespeare's biography does not, in my view,
justify ignoring what the words actually say, as seems
to be happening at the moment.

To remind you, I have also pointed out the relevance of

***Well, but those ink blots mean different things to different
people, depending upon one's predilections. Someone referring to his
&quot;outcast state&quot; could simply mean that he is *feeling* alienated from
society, not that he has been banished. The &quot;travel&quot; of 27 and 28
does not seem to be irremediable. The poet, in 28, indeed
contemplates his &quot;return&quot;; as far as my perhaps benighted
comprehension goes, there is no sense either there or in its
travel-mate 27 of anything preventing his return beyond the simple
necessities of carrying out some personal task or responsibility. Nor
do I get any feeling of &quot;no sense of direction.&quot; Quite the opposite,
the fact that, as we see in 28, he is toiling successively farther
suggests to me a linear progression with a definite, if distant,
destination; had he indeed *no* sense of direction, the idea of
increasing distance would be, as it were, more remote, and he'd be
whining about the aimlessness of his wandering. Further, if the poet
means us to derive an understanding of some sort of official
banishment due to &quot;disgrace,&quot; vis-a-vis &quot;outcast state,&quot; he certainly
fails to give us any clue as to the circumstances or location of this
what would have had to have been an extremely important life event.
And &quot;overwhelming grief&quot;? Mon dieu, a sensitive poetic soul is just
unhappy about being away from his much beloved friend for a while.
The fact that a poet might feel something deeply and express himself
vividly about it doesn't mean that the actual event rises--beyond the
poet's momentary feelings, and our own in empathy--to any level of
significance.

***Given--even considering Fortune and men's eyes--the wide
application of &quot;disgrace&quot; and &quot;outcast state&quot; (&quot;Fred, did you see Will
S. the other day at lunch at the Mermaid? Disgraceful! It wasn't bad
enough with his usual babbling and those naughty jokes and disgusting
puns--he ended up getting crazy drunk and smearing jam all over his
doublet. Then--can you believe his bad Fortune?--he stumbled over the
cat right into a punch bowl at the next table, and the punch splashed
right into the eyes of that fop Sir Wilbert Filbert and his buddy
Fantastico Nutt. Believe you me, he's a downright outcast--can't show
his face there for a year without getting laughed right out the door!
Lucky for him he has to be on the road back and forth to Stratford for
a couple of weeks!!!&quot;), the absence of stated or implied circumstances
concerning banishment, the lack of anything to suggest that his travel
is anything more than a wearisome personal task, and whatever else I
might be blithering about above, Bob's reading of the situation is as
likely as any.

Best Wishes,

Yep. Shakespeare uses the word three times, the other two times as a noun

It's also difficult to relate it to what we know of Marlowe's biography, as
that is understood by the majority, unless Marlowe wrote this and all other
sonnets prior to his death in 1593. If you, the minority, contest this with
some could-have scenario, Strats can do the same for Shakespeare, and can do
it while maintaining a closer proximity to known facts. &quot;He felt humiliated
by Robert Greene's attack....&quot;, &quot;He was ostracised by the University Wits
for his small Latin and less Greek&quot;, etc, etc. Such explanations are

I can't see the relevance of that. Whoever wrote the sonnets, the grief of
the last four is bound to relate to the disgrace of No. 29, and to all the
other sonnets where the poet comes across as glum. It could cover the known
biographical facts of innumerable people, and the possible but unknown facts
of innumerable others. Marlowe belongs in the latter group.You are relating
circumstances in the sonnets not to known facts but to speculation - *if*
Marlowe survived and had to live a secret life abroad, then, yes, he would
have been glum too. That's not what I call a good fit.

It should also not be forgotten that looking for a correspondence between
the contents of the sonnets and the circumstances of somebody's life
presupposes that the sonnets record the poet's real emotional states, rather
than invented ones. The same applies to the identity of the addressee. He
might or might not have existed.

The difference is not trivial because

should have extremely good reasons;

I thought that at first but, in fact, the
period of disgrace may have been in the
past -- IMO probably the very recent
past, and the poet is not entirely free
from all of it. The sonnet implies that
the period is over. He has been (or is
being) lifted out of it by thinking of the
addressee. Obviously, there are conceits
at work, but the overall tone does not
read to me as though he is still deeply
mired in the disgrace.

I (blithely) relate my meaning (exclusively) to what the poem says,

wish I had that man's good looks or that man's talent.&quot; He would say,

says nothing anything like that. Ergo, the context of the poem
absolutely prevents your meaning, however stretched to for rigorously

It is my understanding that you are trying to work out just
what we can learn about the poet and about others from what
he tells us in the sonnets, and without any reference to
what we think we know already or what we know to be coming
later.

In this Sonnet he tells us that his state is that of an
outcast, and that he 'beweeps' this fact. If you are to be
true to your stated aim, then shouldn't you say this,
rather than tuck it away within the phrase &quot;an unfortunate
life position&quot;, in the hope that nobody will notice? :o)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think I agree with you on this. I also favour
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the comma. Otherwise &quot;When in disgrace&quot; becomes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recurring condition, like &quot;When it rains&quot;. Of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course, it *might* be a recurring condition, if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the poet is continually dropping himself in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mire.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He needn't be &quot;continually dropping himself in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mire,&quot; but simply subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to depression.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Could be - if Fortune was the only referent. But we
&gt;&gt;&gt; have &quot;men's eyes&quot; as well. That confirms that it's a
&gt;&gt;&gt; literal, not a metaphorical disgrace.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think both readings equal. Which he was thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of seems irrelevant to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it might be relevant to particular anti-Strat
&gt;&gt;&gt; theories. In the Marlovian view this &quot;disgrace&quot; is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; one-time thing, relating to the investigation into
&gt;&gt;&gt; his atheistic activities, and his subsequent banishment.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The idea of recurrent disgrace doesn't fit his case
&gt;&gt;&gt; very well. So the difference between &quot;When in disgrace&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; and &quot;When, in disgrace&quot; is not trivial. That might be
&gt;&gt;&gt; why Peter favours the version with the comma, but I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to say that I believe the syntax of the poem (which
&gt;&gt;&gt; Crowley doesn't understand at all, by the way) supports
&gt;&gt;&gt; him.

&gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He got a terrific sonnet done on the standard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sentiment of a loved one's being more than enough
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to offset the worst depression.

&gt;&gt;&gt; See above. It's definitely disgrace.

&gt;&gt; In the &quot;Cui-Bono?&quot; thread, re *Straw Dogs*, I just
&gt;&gt; wrote that my reading it as *Pulp Fiction* was &quot;Yet
&gt;&gt; another example of how you see what you expect to see
&gt;&gt; when you read something&quot;.

&gt; I hope you bore that in mind when searching the Monument
&gt; inscription for Marlovian messages.

If that had been what I did, I would certainly have done
so, but it wasn't. On the other hand I was well aware of
the fact that I *might* be allowing my views to influence

&gt; Yep. Shakespeare uses the word three times, the other two

Assuming him to be telling the truth, the &quot;unforeseen

&gt; I can't see the relevance of that. Whoever wrote the

&gt; to the disgrace of No. 29, and to all the other sonnets
&gt; where the poet comes across as glum. It could cover
&gt; the known biographical facts of innumerable people,
&gt; and the possible but unknown facts of innumerable
&gt; others. Marlowe belongs in the latter group.

Why do you keep on and on about Marlowe? Let's stick to
working out what the poet - whoever he is - seems to
mean by the words he uses, shall we?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You are relating circumstances in the sonnets not to

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It should also not be forgotten that looking for a

Absolutely. So why are your fellow-Strats so desperately

Of course it *could*. I would be the last to insist that
it couldn't. This is not what the words actually *say*,

&gt; The &quot;travel&quot; of 27 and 28 does not seem to be irremediable.

It depends, I suppose, how far you experience the grief
as genuine, rather than just a poetic conceit. I simply

the grief being expressed here. If you can, fine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nor do I get any feeling of &quot;no sense of direction.&quot;
&gt; Quite the opposite, the fact that, as we see in 28,

&gt; destination; had he indeed *no* sense of direction,
&gt; the idea of increasing distance would be, as it were,

Yes, I probably chose the wrong way to describe what
I read into &quot;whatsoever star that guides my moving&quot;. To
me this suggests that it doesn't really make much
difference which direction he heads in, he is still
compelled to be far away from the addressee until
his luck changes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Further, if the poet means us to derive an understanding

He beweeps being outcast from (good) fortune AND the esteem of others.
He need not be away from the others to feel outcast in this way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Here, he also feels cast out of the good life by
&gt;&gt; Fortune.

&gt; In *disgrace* with Fortune has nothing to do with &quot;the
&gt; good life&quot;, I'm quite sure. But if you are happy to go
&gt; with that meaning, why should I complain?

"/>

Okay, make it &quot;the ideal life, by his reckoning.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; According to Gary, we have learned that &quot;the poet claims
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be in an unfortunate life position&quot;. Well maybe he does,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but he also says that he beweeps his outcast state. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; word outcast could be taken as a past participle, but with
&gt;&gt;&gt; the word 'state' it makes far more sense as a noun (ie his
&gt;&gt;&gt; state *as* an outcast rather his state as *being* outcast).
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is how 'outcast' is defined as a noun in the Shorter
&gt;&gt;&gt; OED.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A person 'cast out' or rejected; a pariah; an exile;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a homeless vagabond.

&gt;&gt; Yes, a &quot;reject.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because it is difficult to relate this to what we
&gt;&gt;&gt; know of Shakespeare's biography does not, in my view,
&gt;&gt;&gt; justify ignoring what the words actually say, as seems
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be happening at the moment.

&gt;&gt; I (blithely) relate my meaning (exclusively) to what the
&gt;&gt; poem says, Peter. A poet would not say, &quot;I am an unhappy
&gt;&gt; exile; therefore, I wish I had that man's good looks or
&gt;&gt; that man's talent.&quot;

&gt; No, nor does this one.

"/>

Sure, it does. &quot;When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,&quot; it
starts; no exile there, is there? Fortune doesn't like him nor do men
(or men's eyes, if you want to be unfigurative). Then he says, &quot;I all
alone bewail my outcast state,&quot; he's not bringing in his exile, he's
referring to being in &quot;disgrace with fortune and men's eyes.&quot; He's a
reject from &quot;a fortunate life position,&quot; he's been cast out of the
good will of fate and other persons, he's alienated.
He weeps and curses heaven, then tells what he wishes for, which seem
to be that which will repair his bad fate. He mentions having good
looks and talent--but not being home. Why not, Peter? I say it's
because the poem has nothing to do with being literally exiled.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand he might well
&gt; say &quot;When I'm feeling particularly depressed about my

It's more often with me than that. I agree that that's what the poem
says in its octave.

To me the word is implicit in the poem. He wishes for friends because
he feels he has none, for instance--lacking friends, (therefore)
wishing to be &quot;with friends possessed,&quot; for instance. I made it
explicit to help with my explanation. Let me drop it. Then we have,
&quot;He would say, 'I am an unhappy exile. I wish I were home.' This poem

It is a stretch if the context tells us the usual meaning doesn't fit

&gt;&gt; There's been a fair amount of discussion concerning

&gt;&gt; Let me just say that I think the poet is saying in line
&gt;&gt; 2 that he is beweeping his outcast state. What is his
&gt;&gt; outcast state? The state of being in disgrace with
&gt;&gt; fortune and men's eyes.

&gt;And does &quot;an unfortunate life position&quot; adequately describe
&gt;this situation? I think not. Look at that definition of
&gt;'outcast' again. What is there of *any* of that in your
&gt;description?

"/>

Why can't being in disgrace with fortune and men's
eyes be described as being in an unfortunate life position?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Why is he in the outcast state of being in disgrace with

&gt;It is my understanding that you are trying to work out just

Right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In this Sonnet he tells us that his state is that of an

My nefarious Stratfordian ploy is foiled again!
Curse you, Peter Farey!

Be that as it may, I'm not wedded to &quot;unfortunate

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think I agree with you on this. I also favour
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the comma. Otherwise &quot;When in disgrace&quot; becomes a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recurring condition, like &quot;When it rains&quot;. Of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course, it *might* be a recurring condition, if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the poet is continually dropping himself in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mire.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He needn't be &quot;continually dropping himself in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mire,&quot; but simply subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to depression.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could be - if Fortune was the only referent. But we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have &quot;men's eyes&quot; as well. That confirms that it's a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literal, not a metaphorical disgrace.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think both readings equal. Which he was thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of seems irrelevant to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it might be relevant to particular anti-Strat
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theories. In the Marlovian view this &quot;disgrace&quot; is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one-time thing, relating to the investigation into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his atheistic activities, and his subsequent banishment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The idea of recurrent disgrace doesn't fit his case
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very well. So the difference between &quot;When in disgrace&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and &quot;When, in disgrace&quot; is not trivial. That might be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why Peter favours the version with the comma, but I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to say that I believe the syntax of the poem (which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Crowley doesn't understand at all, by the way) supports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He got a terrific sonnet done on the standard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sentiment of a loved one's being more than enough
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to offset the worst depression.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; See above. It's definitely disgrace.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the &quot;Cui-Bono?&quot; thread, re *Straw Dogs*, I just
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote that my reading it as *Pulp Fiction* was &quot;Yet
&gt;&gt;&gt; another example of how you see what you expect to see
&gt;&gt;&gt; when you read something&quot;.

&gt;&gt; I hope you bore that in mind when searching the Monument
&gt;&gt; inscription for Marlovian messages.

&gt; If that had been what I did, I would certainly have done
&gt; so, but it wasn't. On the other hand I was well aware of
&gt; the fact that I *might* be allowing my views to influence
&gt; my thinking, and (helped by Terry in particular) made
&gt; strenuous efforts to minimize any such effect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems to me that Bob is doing that here. The poet says
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite clearly that he is in an &quot;outcast state&quot;, and Bob
&gt;&gt;&gt; reads it as in a &quot;downcast state&quot;. The two words have very
&gt;&gt;&gt; different meanings, and the usual ones for &quot;outcast&quot; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; being blithely ignored.

&gt;&gt;&gt; According to Gary, we have learned that &quot;the poet claims
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be in an unfortunate life position&quot;. Well maybe he does,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but he also says that he beweeps his outcast state. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; word outcast could be taken as a past participle, but with
&gt;&gt;&gt; the word 'state' it makes far more sense as a noun (ie his
&gt;&gt;&gt; state *as* an outcast rather his state as *being* outcast).
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is how 'outcast' is defined as a noun in the Shorter
&gt;&gt;&gt; OED.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A person 'cast out' or rejected; a pariah; an exile;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a homeless vagabond.

&gt;&gt; Yep. Shakespeare uses the word three times, the other two
&gt;&gt; times as a noun meaning what it usually means. A better
&gt;&gt; argument would be to ask why you would beweep your outcast
&gt;&gt; state if an outcast state is a psychological condition
&gt;&gt; rather than a material one. It would translate
&gt;&gt; as &quot;I am depressed by my depression&quot;.

&gt; A very good point.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because it is difficult to relate this to what we
&gt;&gt;&gt; know of Shakespeare's biography does not, in my view,
&gt;&gt;&gt; justify ignoring what the words actually say, as seems
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be happening at the moment.

&gt;&gt; It's also difficult to relate it to what we know of Marlowe's
&gt;&gt; biography, as that is understood by the majority, unless
&gt;&gt; Marlowe wrote this and all other sonnets prior to his death
&gt;&gt; in 1593.

&gt; Quite right. It is you and Gary who have brought Marlowe
&gt; into this, not I. I am simply pointing out what the words
&gt; seem to mean, if unencumbered by any assumptions about
&gt; who wrote them.

"/>

My reference to Marlovian theory was in answer to Bob, who couldn't see why
the presence or absence of a comma could make much difference to the
interpretation. But since you rejoined with your remark about Shakespeare's
biography, I thought you wanted to get stuck into it too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If you, the minority, contest this with some could-have
&gt;&gt; scenario, Strats can do the same for Shakespeare, and can

&gt; Outcast state?

"/>

Yes, they could say that. For all we know there was a strong
anti-Shakespeare faction for which Greene was acting as a mouthpiece. And
let's not forget that there is a hint of a charge of plagiarism in
Groatsworth, which might have been a bit of mud that stuck. In that kind of
ambience, a playwright sensitive about his inferior education could well
feel himself in an outcast state.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&quot;He was ostracised by the University Wits for his small

Why Stratford? Why this determination to make &quot;outcast state&quot; synonymous
with &quot;physical exile&quot;. Oh, yes, I remember...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Such explanations are speculative, but not wildly so,
&gt;&gt; as they are in Marlowe's case.

&gt; Like I said squire, I'm just sticking to what the words
&gt; say. I'm leaving the author-related speculation to you.

If you look back over your last couple of posts to me, I think you'll find
you aren't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; To remind you, I have also pointed out the relevance of
&gt;&gt;&gt; this to the unforeseen change of fortune, the travel -
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly overseas and with no sense of direction

&gt;&gt; That sentence is a fine example of how conjecture, if
&gt;&gt; mulled over often enough, metamorphoses into fact.

&gt; Assuming him to be telling the truth, the &quot;unforeseen
&gt; change of fortune&quot; is a fact, as far as I am concerned.
&gt; The travel certainly is, and the overwhelming grief is
&gt; too. Where there is conjecture, I precede it with the
&gt; word &quot;possibly&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; - and the overwhelming grief revealed in the last
&gt;&gt;&gt; four sonnets.

&gt;&gt; I can't see the relevance of that. Whoever wrote the
&gt;&gt; sonnets, the grief of the last four is bound to relate
&gt;&gt; to the disgrace of No. 29, and to all the other sonnets
&gt;&gt; where the poet comes across as glum. It could cover
&gt;&gt; the known biographical facts of innumerable people,
&gt;&gt; and the possible but unknown facts of innumerable
&gt;&gt; others. Marlowe belongs in the latter group.

&gt; Why do you keep on and on about Marlowe? Let's stick to
&gt; working out what the poet - whoever he is - seems to
&gt; mean by the words he uses, shall we?

"/>

If you like. But in future you'll have to signal that desire some other way

That word &quot;Strat&quot; again! And I thought we were going to drop the authorship
stuff!. But I take no offence, since if you have to talk in absolutes, then
Stratfordian is closer to my position than Marlovian, Oxfordian, Baconian or
anything else-ian. But, to answer your question, why are the 100% Strats so
keen to gloss over the meaning here? Well, they're only doing that up to a
point. On the question of equating &quot;outcast state&quot; with &quot;exile&quot;, I have to
take their side. I see no necessary equivalence. Being sent to Coventry
doesn't have to entail going there. On the other hand, their tendency to
interpret &quot;outcast state&quot; as an emotional rather than material condition is
one I don't support. The wording clearly points to a material condition - of
some sort. &quot;I am depressed by my depression&quot; makes no more sense to me than
it does to you, and the reference to &quot;men's eyes&quot; pretty well nails it down.
His disgrace is seen by others, not just by himself. That's a material
condition.

But if the Strats' interpretation there is authorship-driven, it might be
that they assume a closer correspondence between the work and the life than
I am ever able to do. I've never got free of the feeling that Shakespeare is
taking us all for a very big ride.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To remind you, I have also pointed out the relevance of

&gt;&gt;&gt; That sentence is a fine example of how conjecture, if
&gt;&gt;&gt; mulled over often enough, metamorphoses into fact.

&gt;&gt; Assuming him to be telling the truth, the &quot;unforeseen
&gt;&gt; change of fortune&quot; is a fact, as far as I am concerned.
&gt;&gt; The travel certainly is, and the overwhelming grief is
&gt;&gt; too. Where there is conjecture, I precede it with the
&gt;&gt; word &quot;possibly&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - and the overwhelming grief revealed in the last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; four sonnets.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't see the relevance of that. Whoever wrote the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sonnets, the grief of the last four is bound to relate
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the disgrace of No. 29, and to all the other sonnets
&gt;&gt;&gt; where the poet comes across as glum. It could cover
&gt;&gt;&gt; the known biographical facts of innumerable people,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the possible but unknown facts of innumerable
&gt;&gt;&gt; others. Marlowe belongs in the latter group.

I ignored your speculation about why I might have

&gt;&gt; In *disgrace* with Fortune has nothing to do with &quot;the

&gt;&gt; with that meaning, why should I complain?

&gt; Okay, make it &quot;the ideal life, by his reckoning.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; According to Gary, we have learned that &quot;the poet claims
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be in an unfortunate life position&quot;. Well maybe he does,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but he also says that he beweeps his outcast state. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; word outcast could be taken as a past participle, but with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the word 'state' it makes far more sense as a noun (ie his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state *as* an outcast rather his state as *being* outcast).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is how 'outcast' is defined as a noun in the Shorter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OED.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A person 'cast out' or rejected; a pariah; an exile;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a homeless vagabond.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, a &quot;reject.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just because it is difficult to relate this to what we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know of Shakespeare's biography does not, in my view,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; justify ignoring what the words actually say, as seems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be happening at the moment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I (blithely) relate my meaning (exclusively) to what the
&gt;&gt;&gt; poem says, Peter. A poet would not say, &quot;I am an unhappy
&gt;&gt;&gt; exile; therefore, I wish I had that man's good looks or
&gt;&gt;&gt; that man's talent.&quot;

&gt;&gt; No, nor does this one.

&gt; Sure, it does.

No it doesn't. You have inserted the word 'therefore' where

&gt; It's more often with me than that. I agree that that's
&gt; what the poem says in its octave.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He would say, &quot;I am an unhappy exile; therefore I
&gt;&gt;&gt; wish I were home.&quot; This poems says nothing anything

&gt;&gt; This poems doesn't have any suggestion of the word

&gt; To me the word is implicit in the poem. He wishes for
&gt; friends because he feels he has none, for instance--
&gt; lacking friends, (therefore) wishing to be &quot;with friends
&gt; possessed,&quot; for instance. I made it explicit to help
&gt; with my explanation. Let me drop it. Then we have,

Fair enough. I hadn't adequately considered the 'state

times Shakespeare uses the word, I have been unable to
find a single one clearly with that meaning. Are there any?

Kerrigan does of course protest that the Sonnets aren't
biographical, and certainly there is nothing within
Shakespeare's biography to suggest the *general*
rejection indicated here. He nevertheless works within
the orthodox paradigm, and would therefore not even
consider the equally acceptable (3) position as one in
exile (*state* as status), even though this would go far
better with the loss of &quot;public honour&quot;, the &quot;written

&quot;all alone,&quot; I think, is possibly metaphorical. Or it could tell us when he
gets into these downcast moods. &quot;I am (or feel myself) an outcast from
society, and when I'm on my own I retrace over and over how bad my lot is.&quot;

I always wonder if there's a suggestion of sexual shame in these sonnets,
that he has done something awful in the eyes of society (possibly with the
addressee, not sure), which has led to the feelings, or even the reality, of
being outcast.

I find the sonnets from 24 or so on fascinating because there appears to be
a sea change in them. Before he was talking about how much he adored the
addressee. After about 23-24 there is the language of absence, of
unhappiness, and eventually there are notes of discord in the friendship
itself. I cannot tell if all these different notes are somehow related to
one another.

29 is one of my favourite sonnets. I think there may be a bit of
sexual/bawdy imagery in it (when he thinks of the addressee), but don't
think that's ultimately important to the meaning.

Lynne, sorry not to have been participating much.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It should also not be forgotten that looking for a
&gt;&gt;&gt; correspondence between the contents of the sonnets and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the circumstances of somebody's life presupposes that
&gt;&gt;&gt; the sonnets record the poet's real emotional states,
&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than invented ones. The same applies to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; identity of the addressee. He might or might not have
&gt;&gt;&gt; existed.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. So why are your fellow-Strats so desperately
&gt;&gt; keen to gloss over what the words actually say?!!

"/>

Strats gloss the words in an effort to
drain them of almost all their meaning.
The sonnets clearly say _something_
but since nothing makes sense in any
kind of Stratfordian context, they go
to extreme lengths to find banal
abstractions, generalised proverbs, or
vague biblical allusions. Whenever
they can, they reduce meaning. When
they find what they think is unusual
punctuation or spelling, they assume
a printer's typo. The fact that all this
is the antithesis of scholarship never
even occurs to them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That word &quot;Strat&quot; again! And I thought we were going to drop the authorship
&gt; stuff!. But I take no offence, since if you have to talk in absolutes, then
&gt; Stratfordian is closer to my position than Marlovian, Oxfordian, Baconian or
&gt; anything else-ian. But, to answer your question, why are the 100% Strats so
&gt; keen to gloss over the meaning here? Well, they're only doing that up to a
&gt; point. On the question of equating &quot;outcast state&quot; with &quot;exile&quot;, I have to
&gt; take their side.

"/>

Peter (and perhaps some fellow Marlites)
are the only people reading in 'exile' into
'out-cast state'. Given the rest of the
poem, it's far-fetched in the extreme.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I see no necessary equivalence. Being sent to Coventry
&gt; doesn't have to entail going there.

"/>

I so rarely agree with Buffalo, that it is
a pleasant change to find him making
sense. The poet states that he was in
'disgrace . . with mens eyes'. Peter
ignores that. Being thought dead, but
actually being in secret exile does not
accord with his words -- nor any others
in this sonnet (nor any other sonnet).
The poet would have been in an extremely
unusual condition, about which he would
have left us some clues -- if there was the
slightest truth in the theory.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand, their tendency to
&gt; interpret &quot;outcast state&quot; as an emotional rather than material condition is
&gt; one I don't support. The wording clearly points to a material condition - of
&gt; some sort.

"/>

I think it's only Bob Grumman who makes
the claim that the condition is (or could
be) entirely emotional. That theory is also
defeated by the 'disgrace . . with mens
eyes' -- as you say.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;I am depressed by my depression&quot; makes no more sense to me than
&gt; it does to you, and the reference to &quot;men's eyes&quot; pretty well nails it down.
&gt; His disgrace is seen by others, not just by himself. That's a material
&gt; condition.

&gt; But if the Strats' interpretation there is authorship-driven, it might be
&gt; that they assume a closer correspondence between the work and the life than
&gt; I am ever able to do.

"/>

There is one regular poster who does point
out the extremely close correspondence of
each sonnet to events in the life of the poet,
His posts have to be ignored. But since
they can't be criticised, what other course
is available?

The poet says he is in disgrace for some reason, and

Hi BCD,

Haven't spoken to you for a while. I disagree. The words are very strong.
&quot;Disgrace.&quot;&quot;Outcast.&quot;&quot;Despising.&quot; Have no idea what the poet has done, and
don't expect we'll ever really know, but don't see this as a case of double
dipping or some other little social faux pas.

And by the way, if you're speaking from a point of view that admits of only
the Stratford man as the author (&quot;given his profession and modest
background&quot;), you're going to be hamstrung from the get go because you're
primed to see only certain possibilities. There are lines in these sonnets
that don't mesh well with anyone's idea of who the author is. Best to admit
that and move on.

Almost all the lines in these sonnets
mesh well with my idea of who the
author is. Many fit perfectly. I explain
it in detail, usually line-by-line and week-
by-week. No one here is capable of
finding fault with my analyses.

Of course, there have been surprises --
but relatively minor ones. The character
of Oxford is well-known, as are the major
events in his life, his loves and hates, and
his rivals at court. All these are revealed
in the sonnets. Perhaps the most
surprising revelations are that he was so
precocious, that his relationship with the
Queen was so close, and that their shared
sense of humour was so earthy. But these
are only surprising at first glance. The
broad outlines of these facts are either in
the historical record, or can be inferred by
a little thought. For example, it is obvious
that Shakespeare must have been
extremely precocious. He died when he
was fifty-four, after the most astonishing
achievements; he could only have begun
his that work when very young.

indications and inferences by a sort of triangulation between what the
poems appear to state, what personality I see, and my own experiences
in life with people. If something comes up which plainly indicates
that the writer was, say, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, I'm
not going to look the other way. But neither am I going to accept
fantasies on the basis that, if some concept is &quot;exciting,&quot; it must
ipso facto have more truth than some boring old long-held widespread
belief. Everyone has his or her own preferred method of determining
truth or likelihood. So much the better! Let there be a diversity of
ideas out there for people to choose from; let people respect the
choices others make for themselves; and let them look foolish or wise

&gt;&gt; possessed,&quot; for instance. I made it explicit to help
&gt;&gt; with my explanation. Let me drop it. Then we have,
&gt;&gt;&quot;He would say, 'I am an unhappy exile. I wish I were
&gt;&gt; home.' This poem says nothing anything like that.

&gt; But sonnet 28 did, right?

Sonnet 28 said I wish I were with you. It says nothing about being
literally exiled. Moreover, as I said, it's a different poem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ergo, the context of the poem absolutely prevents

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disinterested unbiographical reasons.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is no stretch at all to give words their usual
&gt;&gt;&gt; meaning, Bob. Try it.

&gt;&gt; It is a stretch if the context tells us the usual
&gt;&gt; meaning doesn't fit and a much better meaning for
&gt;&gt; the context is available.

&gt; The context is that something pretty awful has happened
&gt; to him, that he is in disgrace, and far away.

"/>

Not necessarily. Something, or some things, have happened to him that
bother him a lot, when he's in a certain mood. He's not far away in
this poem. If he's in significant disgrace, why does he wish for the
things he
does? What do having good looks, &quot;scope,&quot; friends and talent have to
do with
overcoming disgrace, real disgrace rather than being in disgrace with
Fortune?
Why doesn't he wish for the truth of his innocence to come out, or the
equivalent? Or that what disgraced him never happened?

I consider the context to be a life that in general is making the poet
allmost despise himself.

That's right! It's not just that he *feels* rejected;

&gt; I would agree with that, Peter. The only thing I would add
&gt; is that though he is far away (as you've already said) it
&gt; is perhaps only from the *addressee.* Not necessarily far
&gt; away from everyone, although he does appear, from earlier
&gt; sonnets, to be travelling.

That's right, and I don't see everyone else travelling with
him, with just his friend staying put (or travelling in the
other direction), do you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; His picturing himself as &quot;all alone,&quot; I think, is possibly
&gt; metaphorical. Or it could tell us when he gets into these
&gt; downcast moods. &quot;I am (or feel myself) an outcast from
&gt; society, and when I'm on my own I retrace over and over
&gt; how bad my lot is.&quot;

"/>

Oh certainly. He (very sensibly) does these things only
when no-one else is around. But the word 'outcast'
does itself suggest that the being &quot;all alone&quot; is likely to
happen to him rather more often than it does to most.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I always wonder if there's a suggestion of sexual shame in
&gt; these sonnets, that he has done something awful in the
&gt; eyes of society (possibly with the addressee, not sure),
&gt; which has led to the feelings, or even the reality, of
&gt; being outcast.

"/>

Could be, based on what we've seen so far. I would still
reject the &quot;feelings only&quot; interpretation, though, using
the Buffalo defence, and (if I may cheat by checking the
answers at the back - eg in Sonnet 36) I doubt if the
addressee is suspected either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I find the sonnets from 24 or so on fascinating because
&gt; there appears to be a sea change in them. Before he was
&gt; talking about how much he adored the addressee. After
&gt; about 23-24 there is the language of absence, of
&gt; unhappiness, and eventually there are notes of discord
&gt; in the friendship itself. I cannot tell if all these
&gt; different notes are somehow related to one another.

I tend to read 25-32 as a group, with a bit of a pause
after that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 29 is one of my favourite sonnets. I think there may be
&gt; a bit of sexual/bawdy imagery in it (when he thinks of

I agree (as I am about to mention to Gary).

I'm sorry you haven't too. This being the third time

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;*outcast state* (1) position as social pariah (*state*
&gt;&gt;&gt; as 'status'); (2) feelings of unwantedness (*state* as
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'state of mind')&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Fair enough. I hadn't adequately considered the 'state
&gt;&gt; of mind' possibility, although of the over 350 other
&gt;&gt; times Shakespeare uses the word, I have been unable to
&gt;&gt; find a single one clearly with that meaning. Are there
&gt;&gt; any?

&gt; How about eight lines down in the same sonnet?

&gt;&quot;Haply I think on thee, and then my STATE...&quot;

"/>

How to be made to look stupid in one easy lesson.
Curse you, Gary Kosinsky!

HOWEVER (You didn't really think I'd let it go at that
did you?)...

It is certainly very unusual for Shakespeare to use
the word in this sense. After another browse, I have
managed to find only a couple more fairly clear ones,
both from *Pericles*:

From the dejected state wherein he is
He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.

and

Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
Did come to see you.

In both of these cases, however, a word is added which
makes it *clear* that it is a mental state being meant.
Similarly, the word as used in line 10 of the Sonnet
clearly refers to the mental state he has already been
talking about - &quot;myself almost despising&quot;.

The nearest definition to this use that I can find in
the OED is I.2.a. &quot;a condition (of mind or feeling); the
mental or emotional condition in which a person finds
himself at a particular time&quot;. None of the illustrations
of this lacks such an indication either.

The first definition(s) offered for 'state' in the OED
are as follows:

I. Condition, manner of existing.
1. a. A combination of circumstances or
attributes belonging for the time being to a
person or thing; a particular manner or way of
existing, as defined by the presence of certain
circumstances or attributes; a condition.

This certainly seems to be the one that best fits the
use in line 2 of the Sonnet, which is indeed given as
an illustration of it. His condition is that of being
cast out, he is an outcast. Only if the associated
word had been 'downcast', for example, rather than
'outcast', would any indication of his feelings come
into *that particular phrase*. In other words &quot;My
outcast state of mind&quot; doesn't mean anything.

What this does, of course, is to give us a very nice
illustration of Robert's observation that Shakespeare
tends to change the meaning of any word that he uses
more than once in close proximity.

In this Sonnet, he uses the word 'state' three times.

1) The first, as Buffalo and I have been arguing, is
his condition, or manner of existing, as an outcast,
whatever he means by that.

2) The second is indeed his mental state, but (as
Paul and Lynne have suggested) almost certainly has
within it thoughts of sexual arousal. The appropriate
definition for that concerns the &quot;physical condition&quot;
of something (for which I quite liked one of the
illustrations, related to the &quot;state of the moon, as
well when he is somewhat increased..as also when he
is in the wane&quot;.)

3) The third, whilst returning to his condition as in
the first meaning, brings in yet another aspect of
'state' too - the idea of (II) &quot;Status; high rank;
pomp&quot; as possessed by Kings.

Interesting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He clearly believes that he IS one,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Because he got drunk and embarrassed himself? Sure.

&gt;&gt; ***Why not?--or choose some other gaffe that appeals to you
&gt;&gt; --no need to hold my little fun scenario against the sonnet!
&gt;&gt; Just another embarrassing moment in his life making him feel
&gt;&gt; like a social outcast,

&gt; That wasn't what you were arguing though! It was that others
&gt; were calling him an outcast for some really trivial reason,

***Yes, I can see that that could have been the impression. I should
have developed my tale further (but thought I was already overstaying
my welcome). My thinking was partially &quot;here's some everyday
triviality,&quot; but then also further along the lines of what Bob G. has
been arguing. Some trivial thing could have happened, set him off
about all the trivial things that perhaps had happened, and so on. It
doesn't take much to make sensitive people feel bad. I'm not going to
turn my back on what I see every day when I come to read a sonnet or
experience any work of art. I don't dispute your right to go about
things in whatever way you see fit; but I think one loses the real
impact of a work of art when one alienates it from quotidian
experience.

I've posted elsewhere that no one should be smug. If you recognize
the above about you and great opera etc.--and this also seems to
relate to your response to the Van Gogh question--bear in mind that,
as there are people who are getting something out of these, the
something that they are getting out and possessing is something which
is not coming your way. Were they to attempt to bring you around to
their state of appreciation, and (as is likely) fail in the attempt,
you would perhaps demand of them that they are not providing semantic
evidence or musical evidence or choreographical evidence or whatever
evidence enough to bring you to understand; but the fact is that, as I
think you recognize above, it is something which you will not
understand, let them try as they will, until the time comes when your

whoever he is, lived in London. That's not necessarily the

The point being that his location is never really specified,
is it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The first definition(s) offered for 'state' in the OED
&gt;are as follows:

&gt; I. Condition, manner of existing.
&gt; 1. a. A combination of circumstances or
&gt; attributes belonging for the time being to a
&gt; person or thing; a particular manner or way of
&gt; existing, as defined by the presence of certain
&gt; circumstances or attributes; a condition.

&gt;This certainly seems to be the one that best fits the
&gt;use in line 2 of the Sonnet, which is indeed given as
&gt;an illustration of it. His condition is that of being
&gt;cast out, he is an outcast. Only if the associated
&gt;word had been 'downcast', for example, rather than
&gt;'outcast', would any indication of his feelings come
&gt;into *that particular phrase*. In other words &quot;My
&gt;outcast state of mind&quot; doesn't mean anything.

"/>

It's unusual, but I think it can be meaningful:

&quot;My depressed state of mind.&quot;
&quot;My happy state of mind.&quot;
&quot;My outcast state of mind.&quot;

We're not going to agree on this, but I don't see
anything wrong in someone saying he feels like an outcast,
without actually being one, either physically or
geographically.

One other thing which may be beside the point: If
the poet was physically/geographically outcast from the
addressee, why would thinking of the addressee cheer him up?
Wouldn't the distance between them make him feel even worse
about his outcast state? The concluding couplet suggests to
me that the speaker and addressee are in close proximity.

I think at least part of the time the poet is away from his home base,
wherever that may be, and perhaps even abroad. The addressee is likely
reasonably close to the poet's home base. I tend to think of it as London
too, but cannot be sure. I tend to doubt, even if the poet is WS of
Stratford, that either the poet or the addressee is there. Too close to
&quot;Hate Away.&quot; ;)
