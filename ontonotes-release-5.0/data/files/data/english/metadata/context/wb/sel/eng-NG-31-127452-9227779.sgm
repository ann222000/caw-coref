Populism's balloon burst?

Experts attack populist policies
Published on November 5, 2007
Handouts won't end poverty, show politicians' poor opinion of rural voters:
panel
All political parties, large and small, are trying to woo the electorate with
populist policies ahead of the election, but experts say it will not bridge the
gap between rich and poor in the long run.
&quot;It will only lead to a phoney poverty-eradication programme,&quot; said
Chulalongkorn University political scientist Prapas Pintobtaeng.
Prapas, who has done plenty of research on rural poverty, said populist handouts
like cheap loans and debt moratoriums will not address the issue of agricultural
production and farmers' debt as the sector will continue to bleed and turn rural
farmers into seasonal unskilled workers in the cities.
He voiced his concerns last week at a roundtable discussion organised by Nation
Multimedia Group.
&quot;It's also risky to fiscal discipline,&quot; said Songtham Pinto, a macro-economist
from the Bank of Thailand.
He said that many of the promised freebies could bankrupt the national treasury.
While acknowledging that populist policies were not wrong per se, he said their
success depended on how they were implemented by political parties.
Viroj na Ranong, a senior research specialist with the Thailand Development
Re-search Institute Foundation (TDRI), said the media's stereotyping of the poor
as rural voters who were &quot;addicted&quot; to populist policies was disturbing because
it revealed a deep-rooted bias against the poor.
Viroj reminded the panel that the rich got their own handouts from the Thaksin
Shinawatra administration through assistance with non-performing loans.
&quot;If you really count it, the cost of assistance given to the rich may be even
higher than that given to the poor. I feel disturbed with the view that the poor
are addicted [to populist policies] because it reflects a belief that the poor
are lazy and do not know how to look after their interests.&quot;
But the panel agreed that the various populist policies are here to stay as long
as politicians feel they can make instant electoral gains from promises made to
voters. Bridging the social and economic gaps will require quality education,
increasing the ability of people to learn and progressive taxes that cover
inheritance tax, land tax and so on.
Songtham said that although farmers made up more than half of the workforce, the
farming sector accounted for only 9 per cent of the GDP.
&quot;In the long run, we must nurture people's ability to think and that doesn't
mean just schooling,&quot; he said, adding that Thai soap operas filled with violence
and romance revealed much about the condition of society.
Viroj agreed, but stressed that middle-class people also have a problem.
&quot;If our population is not a quality population and is easily manipulated over
the past year, such as the middle class [was manipulated by the junta], then
it's tough. People were raised in a culture where followers and those with less
power simply followed and trusted those with power,&quot; he said.
&quot;Any state that reduces its own citizens to docile followers will never achieve
greatness. I feel as if we're living in a cultural revolution [like China].
&quot;Those with reserved power preach to people all the time about morality and
ethics, but look where we are now. Perhaps this is the country with the most
preaching. We ought to let people think more freely.&quot;
Prapas said the issues of natural resources, government budget allocation and
progressive taxes cannot be overlooked.
Another TDRI researcher, Somchai Jitsuchon, said that people must have more to
say about how to manage their own natural resources.
