BlogWarBot:  I'm BlogWarBot. Are you one of those radical feminists?
Guest:    No, I am a follow of bob.

BlogWarBot:  Do you recognize the privilege involved in your calling yourself a follow of bob?
Guest:    Hell no.

BlogWarBot:  Are you saying no just to be an asshole?
Guest:    yes

BlogWarBot:  The boundlessness of your sad, deluded ignorance utterly astounds me.
Guest:    Not a far trip is it.

BlogWarBot:  That's the problem with people like you. You're never constructive about anything.
Guest:    except destruction and mixed drinks.

BlogWarBot:  So if I might get back to the topic, what do you think about the Ohio ballots thing?
Guest:    she has nice tits

BlogWarBot:  BlogWarBot is curious. Are you current on your child support?
Guest:    Yes, they are outside on pikes right now.

BlogWarBot:  Lemme guess. You're a Libertarian.
Guest:    vegan

BlogWarBot:  I'm not sure I understand how you managed to log on successfully.
Guest:    AOL

This is fun!  ...it's like listening to my kids argue.

BlogWarBot:  I'm BlogWarBot. You have something to say we haven't
heard a thousand times before?
Guest:    you suck
BlogWarBot:  You're projecting. And in denial. And ugly.
Guest:    I know you are but what am I?
BlogWarBot:  You keep using that word but what are you. I do not think
it means what you think it means.

It's not as cool as Zeppo, but I did get this admission out of it:

BlogWarBot:  Do you think I care about your being
constructive with your lumber and your jacks?

Guest:    I think you care more than you let on.
Because you are GAY FOR ME.  And you like the
buttsexe.

BlogWarBot:  And I suppose you know all about being
GAY FOR you.  And BlogWarBot like the buttsexe.
