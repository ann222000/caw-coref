Hey,
I am a student doing some research about the traditional and/or modern
make-up used on salsa/latin dancers. Surprisingly, there isn't a lot
resources out there about this... so I figured I'd ask the pros who
have first-hand experience :)

I'm interested in knowing the overall typical colour schemes as well as
unique cultural cosmetics (anything that is uniquely salsa/latin and
not in other dances).
Also the traditional hairstyles that salsa dancers usually have.

I know probably only salsa dancers themselves know these things.. so
not sure if many people are familliar with it.
But ANY input is appreciated!

Thanks!

I am certaily not a cosmetology expert, but I will put in my 2 cents.
It all depends on what your definition of traditional and latin is.
Salsa came about in the 1970s mostly in Miami and NYC,, in Miami the
culture was more from Cuba, in NYC it was more Puerto Rican.  From
what I remember the girls were wearing normal kight  evening make up
for the time.

Latin dance in general had roots in the sane areas, but the hub was
the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan.  The makeup was probably a little
heavier than the later Salsa dancers.

You might check out Dirty Dancing II.  I think that it is prety
accurate as to the culture of early Larin dance.

I think it makes a difference whether you are talking about social club
Salsa dancing or competitive Salsa dancing.

When I think of the Salsa community and how I picture the women
dancers, I always think of "more"... meaning... Salseras tend to dress
up more, wear more skirts, more heels, higher heels, more make-up, more
jewelry, etc.

Paradoxically, while they may be dressing up "more," they are also, in
fact, wearing less... shorter skirts, off the shoulder, midriff baring
outfits, and so forth.

And the Latin performance/competition outfits? Ha! Sometimes they are
no more than little itty-bitty bits of material, LOL. All gorgeous, for
the most part, in bright, flashy gorgeous colors, but in truth there
ain't much to 'em.

As far as hairstyles... from what I've seen in the Latin/Ballroom
circles, and in the competitive Salsa venues I've been to... the women
usually have their hair back and up - off the face, off the neck, out
of the way. It usually looks like some kind of complex up-do, and it's
usually hair spray laminated to the extent that it probably won't move
for a week, LOL... but that's pretty much necessary to keep it
smoothly, neatly out of the way and in place throughout the dance(s).
Non-movement of the hair really helps to showcases the ultra-sharp
spots of the top level Latin dancers. Very sleek effect.

In regards to make-up, I'm not aware of any specific cultural products
that are used although there very well may be some out there. I know
that Mac make-up, especially the brilliant eye-shadows, are
particularly popular among many competitive dancers, I'm sure there are
other high-end brands that are also popular. False eye lashes are also
pretty standard, some lashes are even tipped with crystals or
rhinestones for added effect, and ultra-flashy touches like glitter on
the eyelids are popular as well.

Standard disclaimer - all of the above? Just my personal observations.
Hope it helps.
