Here is another bit of science journalism organized around the theme
of &quot;Everything we used to know about biology was wrong, researchers
find.&quot;

http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070908/bob9.asp

But it appears in a publication I had alway considered just a little
better than the rest of pop-sci journalism - Science News.

Here is the bit that particularly caught my attention:

To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein
can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE
project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes.

I thought I read the ENCODE paper pretty carefully, but I didn't
see anything like that.  What did I miss, or what the hell is this
guy talking about?  He can't be dumb enough to think that the
ENCODE group discovered introns, can he?  Is he saying that
they found a lot of non-standard splicing at low levels including
at least some cases in which an mRNA seems to have been created
by splicing transcripts from different chromosomes?

The latter is what he seems to be saying, though &quot;protein&quot; is ambiguous,
and could potentially apply to an assembly of multiple peptides, as, for
example ATPase, some of whose subunits are coded by the mitochondrion
and others by the nucleus. But that wouldn't be a surprise. If there is
widespread splicing together of RNAs from different chromosomes, that
would indeed be a big surprise. I find this hard to believe, though.
That would mean that most proteins whose sequences have been determined
from DNA sequences are wrong, and most determined from RNA transcripts
will not fit to their genes. And in my experience this is not the case.
There are no mysterious leftovers in mRNA transcripts once you take out
the known exons.

So, like you, I am left wondering &quot;WTF?&quot;

Which version? It was a consortium of 35 groups &amp; 80 organizations
around the world. With academic, governmental, and industry
research organizations in 11 countries.
There was;

1 group paper in 14th June's edition of &quot;Nature&quot;. &amp;
28 companion papers June's issue of &quot;Genome Research&quot;.

Did you read them all?

Director Francis S. Collins is quoted as saying

&quot;This impressive effort has uncovered many exciting surprises and
blazed the way for future efforts to explore the functional landscape
of the entire human genome. Because of the hard work and keen insights
of the ENCODE consortium, the scientific community will need to
*RETHINK* some long-held views about what genes are and what they do,
as well as how the genome's functional elements have evolved. This
could have significant implications for efforts to identify the DNA
sequences involved in many human diseases&quot;.

I'll go with &quot;Francis&quot; over &quot;you&quot; and &quot;Harshman&quot;, me thinks!

But if you don't believe &quot;sciencenews&quot; you could go straight to the
organ grinder.

http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/news/2007/06/13/encode_pilot/index.shtml

&quot;The findings challenge the traditional view of our genetic blueprint
as a tidy collection of independent genes, pointing instead to a
complex network in which genes, along with regulatory elements and
other types of DNA sequences that do not code for proteins, interact
in overlapping ways not yet fully understood&quot;.

I don't believe the first claim here, that the genome contains very
litle unused sequence. Now by that, I think they mean that most
sequences are transcribed at times. While this is surprising, it still
doesn't tell me that all those transcribed sequences are functional. The
second sentence is not surprising at all; that's been known for many years.

That must be the case.  Because I just can't figure out how the quotes
you have provided say anything about the bit in the Science News
article that had me puzzled.  Which was:

... The ENCODE
project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes.

Since you have better eyesight and focus, perhaps you could explain
to me how your quotations are relevant.  Or which of those 28 companion
papers is the one that says 90% of genes possess previously unknown
coding fragments?  I need to read that paper again, paying attention
this time.

Well, I know that they were already discovered and described in the

Well, I notice that in the Kapranov paper I cite below, it is called
a 'non-canonical splicing'.  A non-canonical splicing would be one
which does something other than to excise a single intron.

For example, if the primary transcript is represented as
AAAAXXXXXXXXXXXXBBBBYYYYYYYYYYCCC
where the Xs and Ys represent introns and the other letters represent
exons, then the canonical splicing would produce
AAAABBBBCCC
by cleanly removing both introns.

But it has been known for a long time that you can get a non-canonical
result if you make a single excision of both introns and the stuff
between, yielding
AAAACCC

As I say, it has been known for decades that this sometimes happens.
It has been known for a much shorter period of time that it might
be fairly common and 'intentional' (ie. functional in a positive way).

And I still say I didn't see that in the ENCODE papers.

Thanks.  That gives me a starting place for where to look.

Well, the statement in the wiki article cites both Pennisi and a 2005
paper by Kapranov et al. available here [rejoin the URL]:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;
db=pubmed&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=15998911

But, on rereading the Kapranov paper, I found no mention of splicing
that crosses chromosome boundaries, and not even any clear mention of
splicing which they think joined parts of two distinct primary transcripts.

Odd, because as I look at the wiki edit history, it appears that at one
time that statement was there but only Kapranov (and not Pennisi) was
used as a supporting reference.

So, I'll have to reread the Pennisi article
http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/316/5831/1556
which apparently isn't available online.

Not necessarily. It might also be one that used a different splice
signal from what is found in most introns. I don't know about
non-canonical splicing, but there are non-canonical introns, and they
use start and stop signals different from the usual GT-AG.

&gt; But, on rereading the Kapranov paper, I found no mention of splicing

&gt; splicing which they think joined parts of two distinct primary transcripts.

&gt; Odd, because as I look at the wiki edit history, it appears that at one

&gt; &gt; Doesn't appear so. Do you know all about introns?

&gt; Well, I know that they were already discovered and described in the

&gt; that stretch from one chromosome to another.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Is he saying that
&gt; &gt; &gt; they found a lot of non-standard splicing at low levels including

&quot;We found that the vast majority of the protein coding genes we
studied utilised often in a tissue-specific manner previously unknown
set of exons [the regions of DNA within a gene that are transcribed to
messenger RNA] outside the current boundaries of the annotated genes
&quot;, Professor Reymond will say.

http://www.biomsn.com/html/96/t-896.html
&quot;The mRNA produced from protein-coding genes also held surprises. When
Alexandre Reymond, a medical geneticist at the University of Lausanne,
Switzerland, and his colleagues took a close look at the 400 protein-
coding genes contained in ENCODE's target DNA, they found additional
exons--the regions that code for amino acids--for more than 80%. Many
of these newfound exons were located thousands of bases away from the
gene's previously known exons, sometimes hidden in another gene.
Moreover, some mRNAs were derived from exons belonging to two genes, a
finding, says Reymond, that &quot;underscores that we have still not truly
answered the question, 'What is a gene?' &quot; In addition, further
extending and blurring gene boundaries, ENCODE uncovered a slew of
novel &quot;start sites&quot; for genes--the DNA sequences where transcription
begins--many located hundreds of thousands of bases away from the
known start sites.&quot;

This &quot;vast majority&quot; and &quot;more than 80%&quot; could be references to the
&quot;90%&quot; above, although that didn't appear to be what you originally had

I may have resolved the mystery.  The Gerstein et al. paper in the ENCODE
collection suggests that the ENCODE results make it desirable to
update the definition of a gene.  They propose a new definition
which makes it possible for some pretty weird things to be called
genes.  And in explaining the implications of their proposed definition,
they write:

... In particular, because the gene
is a set of sequences shared among the products, there is no
requirement of connectivity between these sequences and the
sequences that happen to connect them need not be part of the
gene. Thus, members of a sequence can be on different strands of
a chromosome or even on separate chromosomes. This means
that trans-spliced transcripts belong to one gene.

http://www.genome.org/cgi/reprint/17/6/669

Is it possible that some journalists got so caught up in the spirit
of hype that they took Gerstein's proposal - which really amounts to
&quot;You know, I think we need to define things to leave open the possibility
of genes split across chromosomes, just in case we should discover any&quot; -
and interpreted it as a claim that such things had been discovered by
ENCODE and are in fact quite common?

Yes, of course it is possible.

Not all of the alternatively spliced proteins, anyway:
http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/13/5495

&quot;We find that alternative splicing in human genes is more frequent
than has commonly been suggested, and we demonstrate that many of the
potential alternative gene products will have markedly different
structure and function from their constitutively spliced counterparts.
For the vast majority of these alternative isoforms, little evidence
exists to suggest they have a role as functional proteins, and it
seems unlikely that the spectrum of conventional enzymatic or
structural functions can be substantially extended through alternative
splicing.&quot;

Where did those numbers come from?  From this in the Nature paper?

Remarkably, 93% of bases are represented in a primary transcript
identified by at least two independent observations (but potentially
using the same technology); this figure is reduced to 74% in the
case of primary transcripts detected by at least two different
technologies.

Gee, I'm sorry, but I just don't see a relationship between 74-93% of
bases are sometimes transcribed, and the journalist-claimed figure
of 90% of protein-coding genes encode more amino acids than we once
thought.

From the Nature article:

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/nature05874.html

&quot;Consistent with the known presence of overlapping genes in the human
genome, our findings reveal evidence for an overlapping gene at 224
loci, with transcripts from 180 of these loci (50% of the RACE-positive
loci) appearing to have incorporated at least one exon from an upstream
gene.&quot;

The novelty here is that genes can physically overlap, and that mRNA
transcripts can incorporate exons from different &quot;genes&quot;.

I love it!  But I don't see why this constitutes any kind of a paradigm
shift.  By the time the dust clears a decade or two from now, we will
have realized that eukaryotic genomes are about an order of magnitude
more complex than they appeared to be before 2007.  So what?

However, spindizzy, this accumulating evidence makes it increasingly
less likely that an Intelligent Designer had a Hand in designing life,
because the genome looks nothing like it was designed.  Instead, it
looks more and more like an insanely convoluted patchwork quilt that was
thrown together haphazardly by an unintelligent process.  It is the
universe's supreme Rube Goldberg machine.

Yeah, I saw that.  But they didn't seem to say anywhere that those

If a transcript includes an exon from an upstream gene, then the stuff
separating that exon from the first exon of the focal gene will not
be an intron.  So it won't be excised.  And in any case, that transcript
will probably not have a proper translation start signal until you
get to the first exon of the focal gene.  And if the foreign exon
comes from downstream, then it will never be translated as an add-on
to the focal gene, because the focal gene has its own stop codon.

Or am I missing something?

&gt; &gt; Here is another bit of science journalism organized around the theme
&gt; &gt; of &quot;Everything we used to know about biology was wrong, researchers
&gt; &gt; find.&quot;

&gt; &gt; http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070908/bob9.asp

&gt; &gt; But it appears in a publication I had alway considered just a little
&gt; &gt; better than the rest of pop-sci journalism - Science News.

&gt; &gt; Here is the bit that particularly caught my attention:

&gt; &gt;   To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein
&gt; &gt;   can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE
&gt; &gt;   project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
&gt; &gt;   genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
&gt; &gt;   located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes.

&gt; &gt; I thought I read the ENCODE paper pretty carefully, but I didn't
&gt; &gt; see anything like that.  What did I miss, or what the hell is this
&gt; &gt; guy talking about?  He can't be dumb enough to think that the
&gt; &gt; ENCODE group discovered introns, can he?  Is he saying that
&gt; &gt; they found a lot of non-standard splicing at low levels including
&gt; &gt; at least some cases in which an mRNA seems to have been created
&gt; &gt; by splicing transcripts from different chromosomes?

&gt; I may have resolved the mystery.  The Gerstein et al. paper in the ENCODE
&gt; collection suggests that the ENCODE results make it desirable to
&gt; update the definition of a gene.  They propose a new definition
&gt; which makes it possible for some pretty weird things to be called
&gt; genes.
">

What is a gene, PiP?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
- Hide quoted text - - Show quoted text -
">

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And in explaining the implications of their proposed definition,
&gt; they write:

&gt;   ... In particular, because the gene
&gt;   is a set of sequences shared among the products, there is no
&gt;   requirement of connectivity between these sequences and the
&gt;   sequences that happen to connect them need not be part of the
&gt;   gene. Thus, members of a sequence can be on different strands of
&gt;   a chromosome or even on separate chromosomes. This means
&gt;   that trans-spliced transcripts belong to one gene.

&gt; http://www.genome.org/cgi/reprint/17/6/669

&gt; Is it possible that some journalists got so caught up in the spirit
&gt; of hype that they took Gerstein's proposal - which really amounts to
&gt; &quot;You know, I think we need to define things to leave open the possibility
&gt; of genes split across chromosomes, just in case we should discover any&quot; -
&gt; and interpreted it as a claim that such things had been discovered by
&gt; ENCODE and are in fact quite common?

&gt; Yes, of course it is possible.
">

When you put it like that, &quot;just in case we should discover any&quot;, then
add the possibility that Gerstein is bullshitting:

http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/17/6/669
&quot;There are examples of transcripts from the same gene, or the opposite
DNA strand, or even another chromosome, being joined before being
spliced. Clearly, the classical concept of the gene as &quot;a locus&quot; no
longer applies for these gene products whose DNA sequences are widely
separated across the genome.&quot;

I don't know.  I searched through the article but didn't find anything

a really long article and pretty technical so I might have missed it.

My question is, if the exon gets put into a spliced mRNA transcript (one
with all the introns snipped out), why *wouldn't* it get translated?
What would prevent it?

In Glenn's post he had a quote which said: &quot;There are examples of
transcripts from the same gene, or the opposite DNA strand, or even
another chromosome, being joined before being spliced.&quot;

I'm assuming that the process which can insert foreign exons or join
primary mRNAs together is similar to the one which does alternative
splicing.  This occurs after the primary transcripts have been created
from DNA.

Normal alternative splicing must be under some form of regulatory
control which specifies which exons to put into the final transcript.
It's not too hard to imagine an extension to this control which selects
exons from *other* mRNA transcripts.

Of course, this is just speculation.  :P

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;article that had me puzzled.  Which was:

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ... The ENCODE
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes.

&gt; &gt; [snip]

&gt; &gt;&gt; From the Nature article:

&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/nature05874.html

&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;Consistent with the known presence of overlapping genes in the human
&gt; &gt;&gt;genome, our findings reveal evidence for an overlapping gene at 224
&gt; &gt;&gt;loci, with transcripts from 180 of these loci (50% of the RACE-positive
&gt; &gt;&gt;loci) appearing to have incorporated at least one exon from an upstream
&gt; &gt;&gt;gene.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;The novelty here is that genes can physically overlap, and that mRNA
&gt; &gt;&gt;transcripts can incorporate exons from different &quot;genes&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I saw that.  But they didn't seem to say anywhere that those
&gt; &gt; 'foreign-import' exons ever get translated, and they say in several
&gt; &gt; places that they usually *don't* get translated.  Or am I misreading?

&gt; I don't know.  I searched through the article but didn't find anything
&gt; relating to exons not getting translated.  Where did it say that?  It's
&gt; a really long article and pretty technical so I might have missed it.

&gt; My question is, if the exon gets put into a spliced mRNA transcript (one
&gt; with all the introns snipped out), why *wouldn't* it get translated?
&gt; What would prevent it?
">

If the foreign exon were placed somewhere within the coding region of the
spliced transcript - somewhere after the translation start signal and
somewhere before the stop codon - nothing would prevent it.  As far as
I know, it would be translated.  But if the foreign exon were placed
somewhere before the translation start signal or after the stop codon,
then I can't see anything which would allow it to be translated -
which doesn't mean that there can't be some unknown mechanism that would
permit it.

But the ENCODE results you cited were talking about foreign exons placed
into primary transcripts - that is pre-splicing, AIUI.

&gt; &gt; If a transcript includes an exon from an upstream gene, then the stuff

&gt; &gt; will probably not have a proper translation start signal until you
&gt; &gt; get to the first exon of the focal gene.  And if the foreign exon
&gt; &gt; comes from downstream, then it will never be translated as an add-on

As I point out in my reply to Glenn (which I now notice hasn't appeared
yet) the weirder examples of this happen in what is called 'trans-splicing'.
That is something that happens in nematodes, not humans.  And it doesn't
affect the coding portion of the transcript - that is, there is no affect
on the amino acids in the protein.

Before I read the web site about C. elegans trans-splicing, I would have
said that it would be hard to imagine a mechanism that could reliably
splice things from two different primary transcripts.  Now, I am not
so sure.  Your speculation doesn't seem so far out to me today as it

&gt; &gt; &gt; But it appears in a publication I had alway considered just a little
&gt; &gt; &gt; better than the rest of pop-sci journalism - Science News.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is the bit that particularly caught my attention:

&gt; &gt; &gt;   To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein
&gt; &gt; &gt;   can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE
&gt; &gt; &gt;   project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
&gt; &gt; &gt;   genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
&gt; &gt; &gt;   located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I read the ENCODE paper pretty carefully, but I didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; see anything like that.  What did I miss, or what the hell is this
&gt; &gt; &gt; guy talking about?  He can't be dumb enough to think that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ENCODE group discovered introns, can he?  Is he saying that
&gt; &gt; &gt; they found a lot of non-standard splicing at low levels including
&gt; &gt; &gt; at least some cases in which an mRNA seems to have been created
&gt; &gt; &gt; by splicing transcripts from different chromosomes?

&gt; &gt; I may have resolved the mystery.  The Gerstein et al. paper in the ENCODE
&gt; &gt; collection suggests that the ENCODE results make it desirable to
&gt; &gt; update the definition of a gene.  They propose a new definition
&gt; &gt; which makes it possible for some pretty weird things to be called
&gt; &gt; genes.

&gt; What is a gene, PiP?
">

That would take a longer response than I am willing to give, to do it
justice.

Personally, I prefer a definition in the genetics tradition rather than
the molecular biology tradition.  That would mean that a gene has to
1) make a (visible) functional difference, and
2) be small enough that it rarely is broken up by crossing-over, and
3) exist in multiple variants in a population.

But since the topic in question is &quot;protein-coding genes&quot;, we ought
to use a molecular biology definition.  Which makes a gene a larger
thing - large enough to contain a whole translated peptide and all
of its associated regulatory elements.  By this definition, we only
have something like 20,000 of the damned things.

I really have no problem with the proposal that Gerstein makes for
a new definition, except maybe that it will be difficult to apply.
Because Gerstein, as I understands it, demands that before some
chimeric entity qualifies as a gene, it must be shown to possess a
function.  So most of the non-canonical stuff that ENCODE showed
to exist has to be characterized as *candidates* for the status of
'new weird genes'.  But until a function is found, they ain't 'genes'
yet.  I wholly approve.

&gt; &gt;And in explaining the implications of their proposed definition,
&gt; &gt; they write:

&gt; &gt;   sequences that happen to connect them need not be part of the
&gt; &gt;   gene. Thus, members of a sequence can be on different strands of
&gt; &gt;   a chromosome or even on separate chromosomes. This means
&gt; &gt;   that trans-spliced transcripts belong to one gene.

&gt; &gt; Is it possible that some journalists got so caught up in the spirit
&gt; &gt; of hype that they took Gerstein's proposal - which really amounts to
&gt; &gt; &quot;You know, I think we need to define things to leave open the possibility

&gt; &gt; Yes, of course it is possible.

&gt; add the possibility that Gerstein is bullshitting:

&gt; separated across the genome.&quot;

Thank you for pointing that out.  It appeared in a paragraph headed
&quot;Trans-splicing&quot;, and the full text is:

The phenomenon of trans-splicing (ligation of two separate mRNA molecules)
further complicated our understanding (Blumenthal 2005). There are examples
of transcripts from the same gene, or the opposite DNA strand, or even another
chromosome, being joined before being spliced. Clearly, the classical concept
of the gene as &quot;a locus&quot; no longer applies for these gene products whose DNA
sequences are widely separated across the genome. Finally, a number of recent
studies have highlighted a phenomenon dubbed tandem chimerism, where two
consecutive genes are transcribed into a single RNA (Akiva et al. 2006;
Parra et al. 2006). The translation (after splicing) of such RNAs can lead
to a new, fused protein, having parts from both original proteins.

The Blumenthal reference led here:
http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_transsplicingoperons/transsplici...

It is a very nice and elementary description of this operation, common
in C. elegans and other nematodes (~70% of all C. elegans genes).  I
had not heard of this before, so, for the first time in this thread
I have learned something new.  But this trans-splicing apparently does
nothing to combine separate protein-coding sequences.  Instead it appends
a standard non-translated header sequence to mRNAs.
A similar reaction occurs throughout the nematode phylum as well as in
some protists (e.g., trypanosomes) and many other animals including flatworms,
hydra and primitive chordates.
Doesn't say anything about it happening in humans, though.  Nor would it
apply to the original issue which was whether &quot;about 90 percent of
protein-coding genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments&quot;.
Nor was it revealed by ENCODE.  It does make the concept of previously
unknown coding fragments more conceivable though.  I have to admit that.

'Tandem chimerism' does sound more like it would be relevant to the issue
that concerned me.  The abstract of the Akiva article says:

Transcription of a gene usually ends at a regulated termination point,
preventing the RNA-polymerase from reading through the next gene. However,
sporadic reports suggest that chimeric transcripts, formed by transcription
of two consecutive genes into one RNA, can occur in human. The splicing
and translation of such RNAs can lead to a new, fused protein, having
domains from both original proteins. Here, we systematically identified
over 200 cases of intergenic splicing in the human genome (involving 421
genes), and experimentally demonstrated that at least half of these fusions
exist in human tissues.

Yep, that definitely qualifies as 'previously unknown coding fragments'.
Of course, it was reported 2 years before ENCODE and doesn't say that
it happens in 90% of human genes.  Did ENCODE discover that it is
much more common?

The Parra reference abstract says:
...we estimate that at least 4%-5% of the tandem gene pairs in the
human genome can be eventually transcribed into a single RNA sequence
encoding a putative chimeric protein. While the functional significance
of most of these chimeric transcripts remains to be determined, we
provide strong evidence that this phenomenon does not correspond to
mere technical artifacts and that it is a common mechanism with the
potential of generating hundreds of additional proteins in the human
genome.

Well, I can see how a journalist might make the simple mistake of typing
90% when he read 4-5%.  He only meant to multiply by a standard journalistic
factor of 2, but it turned out to be a factor of 20 due to missing the
hyphen.  And if he first learned about the phenomenon via an ENCODE paper
(as I did), then I can see how he might write &quot;The ENCODE  project
revealed ...&quot;.   ;-)

Again, thanks for the responses, Glenn.  Unlike that other guy, you have
been quite close to the target in your cites.  Just not close enough
to exonerate that Science News journalist in my eyes.  But I have learned
some new stuff about mol-bio by conversing with you.

&quot;Our results indicate that accurate joining of two exons 2 occurs by a
trans-splicing mechanism, confirming the potential of these structures
for this process in nature. The trans-splicing can be explained by the
presence of three exon-enhancer sequences in exon 2. Analysis by
Western blot of the COT proteins by using specific antibodies showed
that two proteins corresponding to the expected Mr are present in rat
peroxisomes. This is the first time that a natural trans-splicing
reaction has been demonstrated in mammalian cells.&quot;

So a stretch of nuclear DNA that is expressed or regulates some other
expression, which is present in a species in a single form, is not a
gene?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is another bit of science journalism organized around the theme
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &quot;Everything we used to know about biology was wrong, researchers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070908/bob9.asp

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But it appears in a publication I had alway considered just a little
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better than the rest of pop-sci journalism - Science News.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is the bit that particularly caught my attention:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I read the ENCODE paper pretty carefully, but I didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see anything like that.  What did I miss, or what the hell is this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guy talking about?  He can't be dumb enough to think that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ENCODE group discovered introns, can he?  Is he saying that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they found a lot of non-standard splicing at low levels including
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at least some cases in which an mRNA seems to have been created
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by splicing transcripts from different chromosomes?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I may have resolved the mystery.  The Gerstein et al. paper in the ENCODE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; collection suggests that the ENCODE results make it desirable to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; update the definition of a gene.  They propose a new definition
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which makes it possible for some pretty weird things to be called
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; genes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What is a gene, PiP?

&gt; &gt; That would take a longer response than I am willing to give, to do it
&gt; &gt; justice.

&gt; &gt; Personally, I prefer a definition in the genetics tradition rather than
&gt; &gt; the molecular biology tradition.  That would mean that a gene has to
&gt; &gt; 1) make a (visible) functional difference, and
&gt; &gt; 2) be small enough that it rarely is broken up by crossing-over, and
&gt; &gt; 3) exist in multiple variants in a population.

&gt; &gt; But since the topic in question is &quot;protein-coding genes&quot;, we ought
&gt; &gt; to use a molecular biology definition.  Which makes a gene a larger
&gt; &gt; thing - large enough to contain a whole translated peptide and all
&gt; &gt; of its associated regulatory elements.  By this definition, we only
&gt; &gt; have something like 20,000 of the damned things.

&gt; &gt; I really have no problem with the proposal that Gerstein makes for
&gt; &gt; a new definition, except maybe that it will be difficult to apply.
&gt; &gt; Because Gerstein, as I understands it, demands that before some
&gt; &gt; chimeric entity qualifies as a gene, it must be shown to possess a
&gt; &gt; function.  So most of the non-canonical stuff that ENCODE showed
&gt; &gt; to exist has to be characterized as *candidates* for the status of
&gt; &gt; 'new weird genes'.  But until a function is found, they ain't 'genes'
&gt; &gt; yet.  I wholly approve.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;And in explaining the implications of their proposed definition,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they write:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   ... In particular, because the gene
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   is a set of sequences shared among the products, there is no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   requirement of connectivity between these sequences and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   sequences that happen to connect them need not be part of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   gene. Thus, members of a sequence can be on different strands of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   a chromosome or even on separate chromosomes. This means
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   that trans-spliced transcripts belong to one gene.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.genome.org/cgi/reprint/17/6/669

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible that some journalists got so caught up in the spirit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of hype that they took Gerstein's proposal - which really amounts to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You know, I think we need to define things to leave open the possibility
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of genes split across chromosomes, just in case we should discover any&quot; -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and interpreted it as a claim that such things had been discovered by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ENCODE and are in fact quite common?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, of course it is possible.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When you put it like that, &quot;just in case we should discover any&quot;, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; add the possibility that Gerstein is bullshitting:

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/17/6/669
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;There are examples of transcripts from the same gene, or the opposite
&gt; &gt; &gt; DNA strand, or even another chromosome, being joined before being
&gt; &gt; &gt; spliced. Clearly, the classical concept of the gene as &quot;a locus&quot; no
&gt; &gt; &gt; longer applies for these gene products whose DNA sequences are widely
&gt; &gt; &gt; separated across the genome.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Thank you for pointing that out.  It appeared in a paragraph headed
&gt; &gt; &quot;Trans-splicing&quot;, and the full text is:

&gt; &gt;   The phenomenon of trans-splicing (ligation of two separate mRNA molecules)
&gt; &gt;   further complicated our understanding (Blumenthal 2005). There are examples
&gt; &gt;   of transcripts from the same gene, or the opposite DNA strand, or even another
&gt; &gt;   chromosome, being joined before being spliced. Clearly, the classical concept
&gt; &gt;   of the gene as &quot;a locus&quot; no longer applies for these gene products whose DNA
&gt; &gt;   sequences are widely separated across the genome. Finally, a number of recent
&gt; &gt;   studies have highlighted a phenomenon dubbed tandem chimerism, where two
&gt; &gt;   consecutive genes are transcribed into a single RNA (Akiva et al. 2006;
&gt; &gt;   Parra et al. 2006). The translation (after splicing) of such RNAs can lead
&gt; &gt;   to a new, fused protein, having parts from both original proteins.

&gt; &gt; The Blumenthal reference led here: http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_transsplicingoperons/transsplici ...

&gt; &gt; It is a very nice and elementary description of this operation, common
&gt; &gt; in C. elegans and other nematodes (~70% of all C. elegans genes).  I
&gt; &gt; had not heard of this before, so, for the first time in this thread
&gt; &gt; I have learned something new.  But this trans-splicing apparently does
&gt; &gt; nothing to combine separate protein-coding sequences.  Instead it appends
&gt; &gt; a standard non-translated header sequence to mRNAs.
&gt; &gt;   A similar reaction occurs throughout the nematode phylum as well as in
&gt; &gt;   some protists (e.g., trypanosomes) and many other animals including flatworms,
&gt; &gt;   hydra and primitive chordates.
&gt; &gt; Doesn't say anything about it happening in humans, though.  Nor would it
&gt; &gt; apply to the original issue which was whether &quot;about 90 percent of
&gt; &gt; protein-coding genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments&quot;.
&gt; &gt; Nor was it revealed by ENCODE.  It does make the concept of previously
&gt; &gt; unknown coding fragments more conceivable though.  I have to admit that.

&gt; &gt; 'Tandem chimerism' does sound more like it would be relevant to the issue
&gt; &gt; that concerned me.  The abstract of the Akiva article says:

&gt; &gt;   Transcription of a gene usually ends at a regulated termination point,
&gt; &gt;   preventing the RNA-polymerase from reading through the next gene. However,
&gt; &gt;   sporadic reports suggest that chimeric transcripts, formed by transcription
&gt; &gt;   of two consecutive genes into one RNA, can occur in human. The splicing
&gt; &gt;   and translation of such RNAs can lead to a new, fused protein, having
&gt; &gt;   domains from both original proteins. Here, we systematically identified
&gt; &gt;   over 200 cases of intergenic splicing in the human genome (involving 421
&gt; &gt;   genes), and experimentally demonstrated that at least half of these fusions
&gt; &gt;   exist in human tissues.

&gt; &gt; Yep, that definitely qualifies as 'previously unknown coding fragments'.
&gt; &gt; Of course, it was reported 2 years before ENCODE and doesn't say that
&gt; &gt; it happens in 90% of human genes.  Did ENCODE discover that it is
&gt; &gt; much more common?

&gt; &gt; The Parra reference abstract says:
&gt; &gt;   ...we estimate that at least 4%-5% of the tandem gene pairs in the
&gt; &gt;   human genome can be eventually transcribed into a single RNA sequence
&gt; &gt;   encoding a putative chimeric protein. While the functional significance
&gt; &gt;   of most of these chimeric transcripts remains to be determined, we
&gt; &gt;   provide strong evidence that this phenomenon does not correspond to
&gt; &gt;   mere technical artifacts and that it is a common mechanism with the
&gt; &gt;   potential of generating hundreds of additional proteins in the human
&gt; &gt;   genome.

&gt; &gt; Well, I can see how a journalist might make the simple mistake of typing
&gt; &gt; 90% when he read 4-5%.  He only meant to multiply by a standard journalistic
&gt; &gt; factor of 2, but it turned out to be a factor of 20 due to missing the
&gt; &gt; hyphen.  And if he first learned about the phenomenon via an ENCODE paper
&gt; &gt; (as I did), then I can see how he might write &quot;The ENCODE  project
&gt; &gt; revealed ...&quot;.   ;-)

&gt; &gt; Again, thanks for the responses, Glenn.  Unlike that other guy, you have
&gt; &gt; been quite close to the target in your cites.  Just not close enough
&gt; &gt; to exonerate that Science News journalist in my eyes.  But I have learned
&gt; &gt; some new stuff about mol-bio by conversing with you.- Hide quoted text -

Not to a classical geneticist, as I understand it.  How would he ever

Of course, to a molecular biologist, it would be a gene, though not

have trouble discovering its existence without variation in the population.

&quot;Two mutant alleles of the same gene, each located in one of the two
homologous chromosomes, may in some instances restore the wild-type
function of the gene. This is the case with certain combinations of
mutant alleles in the mod(mdg4) gene. This gene encodes several
different proteins, including Mod(mdg4)2.2, a component of the gypsy
insulator. This protein is encoded by two separate transcription units
that can be combined in a trans-splicing reaction to form the mature
Mod(mdg4)2.2-encoding RNA. Molecular characterization of complementing
alleles shows that they affect the two different transcription units.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's another ref for splicing, in humans:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The discovery from large-scale genomics studies that alternative
&gt; &gt; &gt; splicing may occur in a very large fraction of human genes (35-59%)
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggests a major role for alternative splicing in the production of
&gt; &gt; &gt; functional complexity in the human genome (2-7).&quot;

&gt; &gt; Oh, alternative splicing (involving exons all of which are in the
&gt; &gt; same annotated primary transcript) is relatively old news.  It is
&gt; &gt; trans-splicing which I am surprised to be learning about.  And
&gt; &gt; I still think that the Science News article made trans-splicing
&gt; &gt; seem far more common than I have been able to confirm it really is.
&gt; &gt; But who knows what amazing thing you will show me next?  ;-)

&gt; How did the article make splicing across chromosomes seem far more
&gt; common than already known?
">

I didn't say it did.  But it made splicing outside a single annotated
transcript seem very common.  It gave the impression that it wasn't
talking about tandem chimerism, either.  To quote what it said again:

To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein
can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE
project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes.

&quot;scattered far and wide&quot;
which is then explained as
&quot;about 90 percent&quot;
&quot;possessed&quot;  (not &quot;were sometimes seen holding&quot;)
&quot;previously unknown coding fragments&quot;
&quot;located far from the main gene&quot;

The &quot;*sometimes* on other chromosomes&quot; strikes me as a note of
uncharacteristic, but welcome, caution in the article.

Yes, of course.  They do lots of things.  mRNAs, tRNAs, various functional
small RNAs (including several involved in splicing), replication origins,
centromeres, telomeres - all of these have been known about for decades.

And of course, there is more stuff discovered within the past decade, and
no doubt more to come.  Of course, I have seen the word 'gene' used in a
way which apparently excludes all this stuff, and I know that a lot of
mol-bio people tend to clump regulatory sequences directly associated with
a protein-coding gene as a part of the protein-coding gene even though it
doesn't code for protein.  When someone says the human genome has 20,000
genes, they presumably are excluding and clumping.  That doesn't mean they
are stupid - it means they are using an alternative meaning of the word
'gene'.

Yes it does interest me.  And I can see how trans-splicing would be
mechanistically a lot easier to pull off in this scenario - in which
the two trans-spliced transcripts are homologous.  And it would go
completely unnoticed except if both alleles were mutants (with the
mutations being in different exons).  Makes me wonder whether the same
thing might sometimes happen in tRNA splicing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070908/bob9.asp

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But it appears in a publication I had alway considered just a little
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better than the rest of pop-sci journalism - Science News.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is the bit that particularly caught my attention:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What part of that included &quot;everything wrong&quot;?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Huh?  What part of what?  I'll guess you are asking what it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the Science News article that made me choose my hyperbolic
&gt; &gt; &gt; caricature of the 'organizing theme'.  Just about all of it.  And
&gt; &gt; &gt; if the part quoted immediately below is correct - that 90% of
&gt; &gt; &gt; protein-coding genes possess coding fragments that were previously
&gt; &gt; &gt; unknown, then, boy, it would be true that a lot of what we thought
&gt; &gt; &gt; we knew was wrong.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I read the ENCODE paper pretty carefully, but I didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see anything like that.  What did I miss, or what the hell is this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guy talking about?  He can't be dumb enough to think that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ENCODE group discovered introns, can he?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doesn't appear so. Do you know all about introns?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I know that they were already discovered and described in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; textbooks before the younger researchers in the ENCODE consortium were
&gt; &gt; &gt; even born.  And I also know that there are (were?) no known introns
&gt; &gt; &gt; that stretch from one chromosome to another.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Is he saying that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they found a lot of non-standard splicing at low levels including
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at least some cases in which an mRNA seems to have been created
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by splicing transcripts from different chromosomes?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is &quot;non-standard&quot;?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I notice that in the Kapranov paper I cite below, it is called
&gt; &gt; &gt; a 'non-canonical splicing'.  A non-canonical splicing would be one
&gt; &gt; &gt; which does something other than to excise a single intron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, if the primary transcript is represented as
&gt; &gt; &gt;    AAAAXXXXXXXXXXXXBBBBYYYYYYYYYYCCC
&gt; &gt; &gt; where the Xs and Ys represent introns and the other letters represent
&gt; &gt; &gt; exons, then the canonical splicing would produce
&gt; &gt; &gt;    AAAABBBBCCC
&gt; &gt; &gt; by cleanly removing both introns.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But it has been known for a long time that you can get a non-canonical
&gt; &gt; &gt; result if you make a single excision of both introns and the stuff
&gt; &gt; &gt; between, yielding
&gt; &gt; &gt;    AAAACCC

&gt; &gt; &gt; As I say, it has been known for decades that this sometimes happens.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It has been known for a much shorter period of time that it might
&gt; &gt; &gt; be fairly common and 'intentional' (ie. functional in a positive way).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Looks to me like he is saying that a lot of &quot;genes&quot; are fragmented,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some fragments being far from the &quot;main&quot; sequence and sometimes on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other chromosomes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yep, it looks to me like he is saying that too.  With 'lots' = 90%.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I still say I didn't see that in the ENCODE papers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Even more ground-breaking than the discovery of fused genes is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observation that some proteins can be composed of exons from far away
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regions and even different chromosomes.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This appears to be taken from a review in Science by Elizabeth Pennisi
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the ENCODE results, &quot;DNA Study Forces Rethink of What It Means to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be a Gene&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks.  That gives me a starting place for where to look.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, the statement in the wiki article cites both Pennisi and a 2005
&gt; &gt; &gt; paper by Kapranov et al. available here [rejoin the URL]:
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt;   db=pubmed&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=15998911

&gt; &gt; &gt; But, on rereading the Kapranov paper, I found no mention of splicing
&gt; &gt; &gt; that crosses chromosome boundaries, and not even any clear mention of
&gt; &gt; &gt; splicing which they think joined parts of two distinct primary transcripts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Odd, because as I look at the wiki edit history, it appears that at one
&gt; &gt; &gt; time that statement was there but only Kapranov (and not Pennisi) was
&gt; &gt; &gt; used as a supporting reference.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I'll have to reread the Pennisi article http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/316/5831/1556
&gt; &gt; &gt; which apparently isn't available online.

&gt; &gt; This may be of interest if you don't have access:

&gt; &gt; http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070619083613.htm
&gt; &gt; &quot;We found that the vast majority of the protein coding genes we
&gt; &gt; studied utilised often in a tissue-specific manner previously unknown
&gt; &gt; set of exons [the regions of DNA within a gene that are transcribed to
&gt; &gt; messenger RNA] outside the current boundaries of the annotated genes
&gt; &gt; &quot;, Professor Reymond will say.

&gt; He &quot;will say&quot;?   ;-)

&gt; &gt; http://www.biomsn.com/html/96/t-896.html
&gt; &gt; &quot;The mRNA produced from protein-coding genes also held surprises. When
&gt; &gt; Alexandre Reymond, a medical geneticist at the University of Lausanne,
&gt; &gt; Switzerland, and his colleagues took a close look at the 400 protein-
&gt; &gt; coding genes contained in ENCODE's target DNA, they found additional
&gt; &gt; exons--the regions that code for amino acids--for more than 80%. Many
&gt; &gt; of these newfound exons were located thousands of bases away from the
&gt; &gt; gene's previously known exons, sometimes hidden in another gene.
&gt; &gt; Moreover, some mRNAs were derived from exons belonging to two genes, a
&gt; &gt; finding, says Reymond, that &quot;underscores that we have still not truly
&gt; &gt; answered the question, 'What is a gene?' &quot; In addition, further
&gt; &gt; extending and blurring gene boundaries, ENCODE uncovered a slew of
&gt; &gt; novel &quot;start sites&quot; for genes--the DNA sequences where transcription
&gt; &gt; begins--many located hundreds of thousands of bases away from the
&gt; &gt; known start sites.&quot;

&gt; &gt; This &quot;vast majority&quot; and &quot;more than 80%&quot; could be references to the
&gt; &gt; &quot;90%&quot; above, although that didn't appear to be what you originally had
&gt; &gt; a problem with.

&gt; Oh, they are EXACTLY what I originally had a problem with.  And if it
&gt; turns out that these 'additional exons' are not just the rare results
&gt; of transcription and splicing errors and that they really have a function,
&gt; then I will concede that a paradigm shift is taking place.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Odd, because as I look at the wiki edit history, it appears that at one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time that statement was there but only Kapranov (and not Pennisi) was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used as a supporting reference.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, I'll have to reread the Pennisi article http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/316/5831/1556
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which apparently isn't available online.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This may be of interest if you don't have access:

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070619083613.htm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We found that the vast majority of the protein coding genes we
&gt; &gt; &gt; studied utilised often in a tissue-specific manner previously unknown
&gt; &gt; &gt; set of exons [the regions of DNA within a gene that are transcribed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; messenger RNA] outside the current boundaries of the annotated genes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;, Professor Reymond will say.

&gt; &gt; He &quot;will say&quot;?   ;-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.biomsn.com/html/96/t-896.html
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The mRNA produced from protein-coding genes also held surprises. When
&gt; &gt; &gt; Alexandre Reymond, a medical geneticist at the University of Lausanne,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Switzerland, and his colleagues took a close look at the 400 protein-
&gt; &gt; &gt; coding genes contained in ENCODE's target DNA, they found additional
&gt; &gt; &gt; exons--the regions that code for amino acids--for more than 80%. Many
&gt; &gt; &gt; of these newfound exons were located thousands of bases away from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; gene's previously known exons, sometimes hidden in another gene.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, some mRNAs were derived from exons belonging to two genes, a
&gt; &gt; &gt; finding, says Reymond, that &quot;underscores that we have still not truly
&gt; &gt; &gt; answered the question, 'What is a gene?' &quot; In addition, further
&gt; &gt; &gt; extending and blurring gene boundaries, ENCODE uncovered a slew of
&gt; &gt; &gt; novel &quot;start sites&quot; for genes--the DNA sequences where transcription
&gt; &gt; &gt; begins--many located hundreds of thousands of bases away from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; known start sites.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; This &quot;vast majority&quot; and &quot;more than 80%&quot; could be references to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;90%&quot; above, although that didn't appear to be what you originally had
&gt; &gt; &gt; a problem with.

&gt; &gt; Oh, they are EXACTLY what I originally had a problem with.  And if it
&gt; &gt; turns out that these 'additional exons' are not just the rare results
&gt; &gt; of transcription and splicing errors and that they really have a function,
&gt; &gt; then I will concede that a paradigm shift is taking place.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought I read the ENCODE paper pretty carefully,

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Which version? It was a consortium of 35 groups &amp; 80 organizations
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;around the world. With academic, governmental, and industry
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;research organizations in 11 countries.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;There was;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;1 group paper in 14th June's edition of &quot;Nature&quot;. &amp;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;28 companion papers June's issue of &quot;Genome Research&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Did you read them all?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Pretty much, though the one in Nature is the one I read most carefully.

&gt; &gt; I'd rephrase that as &quot;the one in Nature is the *ONLY* one I read&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Director Francis S. Collins is quoted as saying

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This impressive effort has uncovered many exciting surprises and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;blazed the way for future efforts to explore the functional landscape
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of the entire human genome. Because of the hard work and keen insights
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of the ENCODE consortium, the scientific community will need to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;*RETHINK* some long-held views about what genes are and what they do,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;as well as how the genome's functional elements have evolved. This
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;could have significant implications for efforts to identify the DNA
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;sequences involved in many human diseases&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I'll go with &quot;Francis&quot; over &quot;you&quot; and &quot;Harshman&quot;, me thinks!

&gt; &gt;&gt;I'm not disagreeing with Collins.  I am skeptical about what I read
&gt; &gt;&gt;in the Science News piece.

&gt; &gt; Then do more research!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;But if you don't believe &quot;sciencenews&quot; you could go straight to the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;organ grinder.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/news/2007/06/13/encode_pilot/index.shtml

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The findings challenge the traditional view of our genetic blueprint
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;as a tidy collection of independent genes, pointing instead to a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;complex network in which genes, along with regulatory elements and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;other types of DNA sequences that do not code for proteins, interact
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;in overlapping ways not yet fully understood&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but I didn't see anything like that.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Thats because you'r either &quot;BLIND&quot; or dont &quot;PAY ATTENTION&quot; to what you
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;read!

&gt; &gt;&gt;That must be the case.

&gt; &gt; Really? I didn't notice!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Because I just can't figure out how the quotes
&gt; &gt;&gt;you have provided say anything about the bit in the Science News
&gt; &gt;&gt;article that had me puzzled.  Which was:

&gt; &gt;&gt;  ... The ENCODE
&gt; &gt;&gt;  project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding
&gt; &gt;&gt;  genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were
&gt; &gt;&gt;  located far from the main gene,

&gt; &gt; Thats 74 percent and 93 percent.

&gt; &gt;&gt;sometimes on other chromosomes.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Since you have better eyesight and focus, perhaps you could explain
&gt; &gt;&gt;to me how your quotations are relevant.  Or which of those 28 companion
&gt; &gt;&gt;papers is the one that says 90% of genes possess previously unknown
&gt; &gt;&gt;coding fragments?  I need to read that paper again, paying attention
&gt; &gt;&gt;this time.

&gt; &gt; Yes, you do!

&gt; &gt; I'd start
&gt; &gt; There
&gt; &gt; http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/news/2007/06/13/encode_pilot/index.shtml
&gt; &gt; There;
&gt; &gt; http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/
&gt; &gt; &amp; There
&gt; &gt; http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/nature05874.html

&gt; &gt; If you still dont get it, give me a call &amp; I'll go &quot;real&quot;  SLOW for
&gt; &gt; you!

&gt;  From the Nature article:

&gt; http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/nature05874.html

&gt; &quot;Consistent with the known presence of overlapping genes in the human
&gt; genome, our findings reveal evidence for an overlapping gene at 224
&gt; loci, with transcripts from 180 of these loci (50% of the RACE-positive
&gt; loci) appearing to have incorporated at least one exon from an upstream
&gt; gene.&quot;

&gt; The novelty here is that genes can physically overlap, and that mRNA
&gt; transcripts can incorporate exons from different &quot;genes&quot;.

&gt; I love it!

Nice eh?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I don't see why this constitutes any kind of a paradigm

No by a decade or so from now, ENCODE will sequence more than 1%, and
probably find even more interplay!
