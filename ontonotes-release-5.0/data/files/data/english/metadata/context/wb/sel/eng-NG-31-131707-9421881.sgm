Just came back from VN. I took a few pictures of my grandpa's bike
which has one of the earliest racing URAGO frame imported to VN in
circa 1950. The bike is still in an amazingly good shape:

Seat: http://www.mediamungo.com/data/2857/originalseat.jpg

Gear: http://www.mediamungo.com/data/2857/gear.jpg

Grandpa won a second place with this bike in an annual race back then.
Cheers,

Neat stuff. Are you sure about the age of the bike? It looks exactly
like the design/construction my wife was riding back in the 70's, i.e.,
skinny steel tubing with lugged, brazed joints. The seat looks like it
might be a health hazard. :-)

&gt; Hey, John, I agree with dsi1 that the saddle looks like a health hazard.

But as one feminist once remarked, and I paraphrase her, if the world were
really a logical place, men (not women) would ride horses sidesaddle.

On the other hand, the inclined saddle might make for a guitar chair
designed to test the mettle of only the most dedicated of (male) performers.

There were toe clips. The pedals were the original ones with serated
edge. My dad took the toe clips off so he could ride the bike to work.

The seat used to have a lot of flex when I was a kid. I think it's

&gt; John, did you say &quot;hard as a rock&quot;?  If you did, please send me that
&gt; saddle (I'll send you back a new one) right away.  It sounds as though
&gt; it's got the stuff of which I wish I were made.  Perhaps, some will rub
&gt; off while I straddle it and practice and pray...um...play.

That looks like a well-aged Brooks Pro saddle!  Cantlepiece could stand
some tightening though.

I know what you mean. Grandpa used to have it higher when he's alive.
But my dad is a short guy, and he adjusted the saddle to the minimum
height so he could ride it. Even so, the poor guy still had push the
bike to gain momentum before he hopped on it as his legs were too
short to touch the ground. Same thing with stopping, he slowed the
bike down to a comfortable speed then hopped off the saddle.

John

Those racing seats do look like nutcrackers - sweet! Felice Natividad,
baby! Being a non-biker, I can't figure them out, but obviously, they
were developed over a period of time for male persons with a design goal
towards maximum efficiency of peddling. You must have had one of those
forward-thinking grandpas - those are always fun, it seems.

The seat looks a little crusty from those hot and sweaty Vietnam days.
My guess is that you could probably restore it by scraping the crust
off with a putty knife.
Did you ever go to your dad and ask to borrow the family bicycle on a
Friday night to go out on a date or do some Ho Chi Min trail biking!

I actually did borrow his bike a few times back then. It was a real
thrill for a teenager to ride a bike when most everyone walked,
barefooted. The saddle was still soft back then, though.
