I’m still on the hunt for a WORKING WM5 PDA that doesn’t crash every hour
like the Dell x51v did, so I can run Skype from wifi and/or cellphone
internet when I’m away from my own wifi network.  I have lots of Skype
friends across the planet and would like to have direct access to them
without SkypeIn forwarding their calls to my Alltel cell using minutes.

If anyone has a Blackjack under Windows Mobile, even without Skype, I’d
like to hear from you as to how bad it crashes and how long the battery
will run it between chargers.  The Axim x51v wouldn’t run any longer than
my laptop away from a power source.  How awful.

Thanks in advance.....looks like a really nice replacement for my trusty
V60i that might give me Skype-on-the-roady, direct.....if it doesn’t CRASH!

I've seen reviews of those Skype Wi-Fi phones on Amazon. Most people
say that they're not very good. They may work OK on a home network,
but don't try to use them on the road because they probably won't
work.

I've also heard that battery life is bad on those phones too.

I'm not a fan of VOIP anyhow. Sounds like you're eating mashed
potatoes all the time. Worse than a conversation with someone on a
phone with Stinkular.

It'll run a day without charging IF it's not constantly trying to connect
to a non-existent AP, which runs the transmitter a lot.  Unlike a
cellular phone, these wifi units do a lot of broadcast packets to keep
their links active that your cellphone doesn't do.  If you're leaving a
location's AP, turn the phone OFF until you get to the next AP.  That
solves the battery's shortness of breath.  Cellphones also don't get
constant contact list updates, who's online, what their contact status
is, etc.  You never have to reload a contact list on a Skype phone as
it's stored on the server, not your phone.  Wouldn't THAT be nice, the
next time your cellphone shits itself?!  You logon the new phone, it
connects and downloads your INTACT contact list with no programming
nonsense.  Even if you boot your Skype name on another's computer, you
get your own contact list.  Sometimes I have 4 copies of Skype running on
one computer when friends are over here drinking up my English ale.  All
you need is enter is your username and password into a redundant copy.

I'm amazed at how many open systems the little Netgear Skype phone will
connect to in places like the malls, downtown (other systems than the
city's free wifi which it connects to just fine), but it really needs
some kind of webpage logon function to be really useful on-the-road as
more and more hotspots have spam logon pages where you have to agree to
something to get service...which is unnecessary but reality, so far.  I'm
working on the city marina to dump the logon page ads and just open their
now-free marina wide hotspots.  We don't need to know what company the
marina uses to connect to the internet...(c;

Around any home wifi system, WEP or open, it simply eats spotty
cellular's shorts in service.  There are no dead zones, no places where
the damned cellphone alerts on voicemail but fails to ring an incoming
call, etc.  Short of putting the phone in a screen room, the Netgear
Skype phone has solid service within 300' of my house.  Instead of the
signal going to shit when you walk indoors with it in your pocket, the
signal goes to full scale.

I don't understand this comment, but I haven't bought the other, more
expensive, VoIP service.  Skype uses broadband, MUCH wider bit rates than
any cellphone's pitiful 8K or 11Kbps codec-to-boost-profits does.  Hell,
Skype in Verizon sounds better than Verizon from an Aircard!  We've been
experimenting with that, in town and on-the-road in Florida, now that VZW
has EVDO up and running so Skype's fast codec doesn't overrun 1X's dial-
up-modem speed.  On EVDO Skype sounds great from an Aircard
laptop....completely eliminating the old roaming games.

Skypers calling my home system, either on the computer or the little
Skype phone ask me what that ticking noise is.  There's a pendulum wall
clock above my desk.  It's barely audible tick is loud and clear, even
that short an audio pulse.

Another thing we've all wanted was more than one cellphone on the same
number, something the companies have lied for years and told us was
impossible.  I have yet to find out how many Skypes I can run
simultaneously on just one account name.  Skype doesn't care.  They all
connect, they all receive the contact list from Skype's servers and they
all ring at once when called, either from Skype's landline number or
direct from another Skype.  They can even call themselves...like intercom
mode!...(c;

The only time I hear the sound degrade is when someone is trying to run
Skype on too little bandwidth....under about 150Kbps where it runs out of
data.  Before EVDO, the aircards running Skype were awful.

The Skype phone or on the computer is not meant to be your primary comm
system.  It's one helluva toy and chit-chat-with-your-honey for almost no
money gadget anywhere there's wifi....

That pretty sums it up right there. Nice toy, not ready for prime
time.

Too much echo, garble, etc.
