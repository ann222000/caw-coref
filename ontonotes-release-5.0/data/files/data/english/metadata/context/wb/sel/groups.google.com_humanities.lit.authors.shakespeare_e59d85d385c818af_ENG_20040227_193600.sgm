This column from last week's New York Times will go a long way to explaining
Art Neuendorffer's babblings. Note the similarities in paragraphs 4 and 5
between the book's methods and those of antiStratfordism, especially
Oxfordism.

The Last Word: The Da Vinci Con

February 22, 2004
By LAURA MILLER

The ever-rising tide of sales of ''The Da Vinci Code'' has
lifted some pretty odd boats, and none odder than the dodgy
yet magisterial ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' by Michael
Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln. A best seller in
the 1980's, ''Grail'' is climbing the paperback charts
again on the strength of its relationship to Dan Brown's
thriller (which has, in turn, inspired a crop of new
nonfiction books coming out this spring, from ''Breaking
the Da Vinci Code'' to ''Secrets of the Code: The
Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind The Da Vinci
Code''). ''The Da Vinci Code'' is one long chase scene in
which the main characters flee a sinister Parisian
policeman and an albino monk assassin, but its rudimentary
suspense alone couldn't have made it a hit. At regular
intervals, the book brings its pell-mell plot to a
screeching halt and emits a pellet of information
concerning a centuries-old conspiracy that purports to have
preserved a tremendous secret about the roots of
Christianity itself. This ''nonfiction'' material gives
''The Da Vinci Code'' its frisson of authenticity, and it's
lifted from ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' one of the all-time
great works of pop pseudohistory. But what seems
increasingly clear (to cop a favorite phrase from the
authors of ''Grail'') is that ''The Da Vinci Code,'' like
''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' is based on a notorious hoax.

The back story to both books, like most conspiracy
theories, is devilishly hard to summarize. Both narratives
begin with a mystery that leads sleuths to vaster and more
sinister intrigues. In Brown's novel, it's the murder of a
curator at the Louvre; in ''Grail,'' it's the unusual
affluence of a priest in a village in the south of France.
In the late 1960's, Henry Lincoln, a British TV writer,
became interested in Rennes-le-Chateau, a town that had
become the French equivalent of Roswell or Loch Ness as a
result of popular books by Gerard de Sède. De Sède
promulgated a story about parchments supposedly found in a
hollowed-out pillar by the town priest in the 1890's,
parchments containing coded messages that the priest
somehow parlayed into oodles of cash. Lincoln worked on
several ''Unsolved Mysteries''-style documentaries about
Rennes-le-Château, then enlisted Baigent and Leigh for a
more in-depth investigation.

What eventually emerges from the welter of names, dates,
maps and genealogical tables crammed into ''Holy Blood,
Holy Grail'' is a yarn about a secret and hugely
influential society called the Priory of Sion, founded in
Jerusalem in 1099. This cabal is said to have guarded
documents and other proof that Mary Magdalene was the wife
of Jesus (who may or may not have died on the Cross) and
that she carried his child with her when she fled to what
is now France after the Crucifixion, becoming,
figuratively, the Holy Grail in whom Jesus' blood was
preserved. Their progeny intermarried with the locals,
eventually founding the Merovingian dynasty of Frankish
monarchs. Although deposed in the eighth century, the
Merovingian lineage has not been lost; the Priory has kept
watch over its descendants, awaiting an auspicious moment
when it will reveal the astonishing truth and return the
rightful monarch to the throne of France, or perhaps even a
restored Holy Roman Empire.

All the usual suspects and accouterments of paranoid
history get caught up in this 1,000-year jaunt: the Cathar
heretics, the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, the
Vatican, the Freemasons, Nazis, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Order of the Golden
Dawn -- everyone but the Abominable Snowman seems to be in
on the game. ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'' is a masterpiece of
insinuation and supposition, employing all the techniques
of pseudohistory to symphonic effect, justifying this
sleight of hand as an innovative scholarly technique called
''synthesis,'' previously considered too ''speculative'' by
those whose thinking has been unduly shaped by the
''so-called Enlightenment of the 18th century.'' Comparing
themselves to the reporters who uncovered the Watergate
scandal, the authors maintain that ''only by such synthesis
can one discern the underlying continuity, the unified and
coherent fabric, which lies at the core of any historical
problem.'' To do so, one must realize that ''it is not
sufficient to confine oneself exclusively to facts.''

Thus liberated, Lincoln et al. concoct an argument that is
not so much factual as fact-ish. Dozens of credible details
are heaped up in order to provide a legitimizing cushion
for rank nonsense. Unremarkable legends (that Merovingian
kings were thought to have a healing touch, for example)
are characterized as suggestive clues or puzzles demanding
solution. Highly contested interpretations (that, say, an
early Grail romance depicts the sacred object as being
guarded by Templars) are presented as established truth.
Sources -- such as the New Testament -- are qualified as
''questionable'' and derivative when they contradict the
conspiracy theory, then microscopically scrutinized for
inconsistencies that might support it. The authors spin one
gossamer strand of conjecture over another, forming a web
dense enough to create the illusion of solidity. Though
bogus, it's an impressive piece of work.

Finally, though, the legitimacy of the Priory of Sion
history rests on a cache of clippings and pseudonymous
documents that even the authors of ''Holy Blood, Holy
Grail'' suggest were planted in the Bibliotheque Nationale
by a man named Pierre Plantard. As early as the 1970's, one
of Plantard's confederates had admitted to helping him
fabricate the materials, including genealogical tables
portraying Plantard as a descendant of the Merovingians
(and, presumably, of Jesus Christ) and a list of the
Priory's past ''grand masters.'' This patently silly
catalog of intellectual celebrities stars Botticelli, Isaac
Newton, Jean Cocteau and, of course, Leonardo da Vinci --
and it's the same list Dan Brown trumpets, along with the
alleged nine-century pedigree of the Priory, in the front
matter for ''The Da Vinci Code,'' under the heading of
''Fact.'' Plantard, it eventually came out, was an
inveterate rascal with a criminal record for fraud and
affiliations with wartime anti-Semitic and right-wing
groups. The actual Priory of Sion was a tiny, harmless
group of like-minded friends formed in 1956.

Plantard's hoax was debunked by a series of (as yet
untranslated) French books and a 1996 BBC documentary, but
curiously enough, this set of shocking revelations hasn't
proved as popular as the fantasia of ''Holy Blood, Holy
Grail,'' or, for that matter, as ''The Da Vinci Code.'' The
only thing more powerful than a worldwide conspiracy, it
seems, is our desire to believe in one.

&gt;&gt; Hi Bob. thanks for the compliment, but as you know, who we debate is
out of
&gt;&gt; our hands. I got an e-mail from the Trust &amp; was assigned Foelster just
as
&gt;&gt; soon as his name appeared on the ng. Boy, I'm glad I was taken off
Crowley:
&gt;&gt; the man is too well-read &amp; intelligent, it was all I could do to keep up
with
&gt;&gt; him. I'm damn glad they've never given me Art to debate; I feel sorry
for
&gt;&gt; poor David. Of course that new anagram program they have is sure coming
in
&gt;&gt; handy for him, but I *NEVER* want to go toe-to-toe with Art--he knows
too
&gt;&gt; much, although I doubt if he's even aware of all he knows.

&gt;&gt; Hey, I finally got the check. Something about a computer virus in the
&gt;&gt; mainframe at Stratford. I was glad to see it--the rent was overdue &amp; I
had
&gt;&gt; to pay a late fee.

&gt;&gt; Sorry about that last e-mail appearing on the ng. Apparently I hit
&quot;post&quot;
&gt;&gt; instead of &quot;e-mail.&quot; It won't happen again.

&gt;&gt; My 14-year-old is giving me trouble--the usual ersatz teenage angst. He
&gt;&gt; doesn't want to accept his occupation being already chosen for him. I
told
&gt;&gt; him it was like the Phantom--the ghost who walks--&amp; that it was an honor
to
&gt;&gt; be born into a family with a 400-year old mission, but he just sulks off
&amp;
&gt;&gt; gets on the computer. I'm sure he'll come around--we all do,
eventually.
&gt;&gt; Meanwhile all he does is play on the computer (he's a real whiz at
&gt;&gt; programming) &amp; mutters about how he's going to &quot;fix me&quot;&amp; about some
&gt;&gt; grandoise plan he has to &quot;expose the truth to the world.&quot; Yeah, right,
&gt;&gt; that'll be the day, hey Bob?

&gt;&gt; Who do you think is going to get the old monument in April? Schoenbaum
had
&gt;&gt; it for so long I think they almost completely forgot about it. I vote
for
&gt;&gt; Matus--he deserves it. I've heard some say that Dave or Terry should
get it,
&gt;&gt; but they're a little young yet, I think. I know damn well it'll be
years
&gt;&gt; before I'm eligible, not to mention that whoever gets it keeps it for
life.

&gt;&gt; Say, before they ship it to whomever they give it to we should all
gather
&gt;&gt; around it &amp; have our picture taken &amp; send it to Kennedy! I'd want to
pose
&gt;&gt; atop the woolsack. Wouldn't that be a hoot! I bet the old fart would
think
&gt;&gt; he was having the DTs! If a picture could be printed with some type of
&gt;&gt; disappearing ink that couldn't be copied it would be worth it. Maybe
he'd
&gt;&gt; have a heart attack or something &amp; we'd be rid of that thorn in the side
&amp;
&gt;&gt; make our jobs a lot easier.

&gt;&gt; Well, that's about it for now. Brenda says to tell the family &quot;hi&quot;&amp;
that
&gt;&gt; we'll see you all in Stratford in April.

This actually got into the TIMES, Tom?! The NEW YORK TIMES?!! What happened,

I read the DaVinci Code, a Christmas present. It wasn[t great, but it was

propagandize for a conspiracy theory it was. I expect at least one author to
now take Brown's chase scene and substitute Oxfordianism for Priory-of-Sionism

I'm sure he is. What he is not is a balanced journalist. Either he is
ignorant of what it takes to write a balanced piece -- something I find hard
to believe -- or he slants his writing, which is unethical (even though I
have a hard time keeping a straight face using the concepts &quot;ethics&quot; and

Dear buddy,

Journalists have been writing unbalanced articles for years, but they're
usually slanted the other way. Not that I'm admitting that William would
ever write an unbalanced article, of course.

I mentioned a spotting scope. It's essentially a small, light
refracting telescope intended for birding. Since it's mounted on a
tripod, you can use magnifications of 60x pretty easily (for ordinary
binoculars, the upper limit of practical magnification is about 10x --
any higher magnification than that and you cannot hold the binoculars
still enough to view details of anything you see). Ducks often tend to
be rather far away from where you can observe them (this is especially
true of sea ducks like scoters that often congregate in rafts fairly far
from shore), and they tend to stay put, so a scope is ideal for viewing
them. Of course, the greater the magnification (so the better the
detail), the smaller the field and hence the harder it is to find the
bird; for that reason some scopes have a range of magnifications (say
20x to 60x), the lower magnification for centering the bird in your
field of vision and the higher magnification for scrutinizing fine
details.

Of course, scopes are not cheap (decent optics never are), but it is
definitely worth it. Your scope can also be used in other circumstances
-- for viewing shore birds, for instance. To get a rough idea what's
available, you could begin at &lt;&gt;; you should
be able to try out various scopes to see what you like (and you might
also get some good advice) at a good local shop in Toronto.

Thanks very much for the info. They do seem a bit expensive. I'd better
write and sell another book so I can afford a decent one. Or sell a couple
of my out of print books. *Candles* appears to be selling on Bookfinder or
Abe for between $100-180 US, so we just tried putting one on Amazon for $75.
I'm thinking it must be a mistake. The book was originally $6.95 US. Weird.

&gt; The Last Word: The Da Vinci Con

&gt; February 22, 2004
&gt; By LAURA MILLER

&gt; The ever-rising tide of sales of ''The Da Vinci Code'' has
&gt; lifted some pretty odd boats, and none odder than the dodgy
&gt; yet magisterial ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' by Michael
&gt; Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln. A best seller in
&gt; the 1980's, ''Grail'' is climbing the paperback charts
&gt; again on the strength of its relationship to Dan Brown's
&gt; thriller (which has, in turn, inspired a crop of new
&gt; nonfiction books coming out this spring, from ''Breaking
&gt; the Da Vinci Code'' to ''Secrets of the Code: The
&gt; Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind The Da Vinci
&gt; Code''). ''The Da Vinci Code'' is one long chase scene in
&gt; which the main characters flee a sinister Parisian
&gt; policeman and an albino monk assassin, but its rudimentary
&gt; suspense alone couldn't have made it a hit. At regular
&gt; intervals, the book brings its pell-mell plot to a
&gt; screeching halt and emits a pellet of information
&gt; concerning a centuries-old conspiracy that purports to have
&gt; preserved a tremendous secret about the roots of
&gt; Christianity itself. This ''nonfiction'' material gives
&gt; ''The Da Vinci Code'' its frisson of authenticity, and it's
&gt; lifted from ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' one of the all-time
&gt; great works of pop pseudohistory. But what seems
&gt; increasingly clear (to cop a favorite phrase from the
&gt; authors of ''Grail'') is that ''The Da Vinci Code,'' like
&gt; ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' is based on a notorious hoax.

&gt; The back story to both books, like most conspiracy
&gt; theories, is devilishly hard to summarize. Both narratives
&gt; begin with a mystery that leads sleuths to vaster and more
&gt; sinister intrigues. In Brown's novel, it's the murder of a
&gt; curator at the Louvre; in ''Grail,'' it's the unusual
&gt; affluence of a priest in a village in the south of France.
&gt; In the late 1960's, Henry Lincoln, a British TV writer,
&gt; became interested in Rennes-le-Chateau, a town that had
&gt; become the French equivalent of Roswell or Loch Ness as a
&gt; result of popular books by Gerard de Sède. De Sède
&gt; promulgated a story about parchments supposedly found in a
&gt; hollowed-out pillar by the town priest in the 1890's,
&gt; parchments containing coded messages that the priest
&gt; somehow parlayed into oodles of cash. Lincoln worked on
&gt; several ''Unsolved Mysteries''-style documentaries about
&gt; Rennes-le-Château, then enlisted Baigent and Leigh for a
&gt; more in-depth investigation.

&gt; What eventually emerges from the welter of names, dates,
&gt; maps and genealogical tables crammed into ''Holy Blood,
&gt; Holy Grail'' is a yarn about a secret and hugely
&gt; influential society called the Priory of Sion, founded in
&gt; Jerusalem in 1099. This cabal is said to have guarded
&gt; documents and other proof that Mary Magdalene was the wife
&gt; of Jesus (who may or may not have died on the Cross) and
&gt; that she carried his child with her when she fled to what
&gt; is now France after the Crucifixion, becoming,
&gt; figuratively, the Holy Grail in whom Jesus' blood was
&gt; preserved. Their progeny intermarried with the locals,
&gt; eventually founding the Merovingian dynasty of Frankish
&gt; monarchs. Although deposed in the eighth century, the
&gt; Merovingian lineage has not been lost; the Priory has kept
&gt; watch over its descendants, awaiting an auspicious moment
&gt; when it will reveal the astonishing truth and return the
&gt; rightful monarch to the throne of France, or perhaps even a
&gt; restored Holy Roman Empire.

&gt; All the usual suspects and accouterments of paranoid
&gt; history get caught up in this 1,000-year jaunt: the Cathar
&gt; heretics, the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, the
&gt; Vatican, the Freemasons, Nazis, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the
&gt; Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Order of the Golden
&gt; Dawn -- everyone but the Abominable Snowman seems to be in
&gt; on the game.

"/>

That's a pretty accurate assessment. No doubt both the Abominable
Snowman and the Bermuda Triangle can be tied into the web of conspiracy
in a later edition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'' is a masterpiece of
&gt; insinuation and supposition,

"/>

One of the authors' modes of suggestion is particularly amusing: the
authors report that they are unable to confirm a hypothesis, but hastily
add that they are unable to refute it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; employing all the techniques
&gt; of pseudohistory to symphonic effect, justifying this
&gt; sleight of hand as an innovative scholarly technique called
&gt; ''synthesis,'' previously considered too ''speculative'' by
&gt; those whose thinking has been unduly shaped by the
&gt; ''so-called Enlightenment of the 18th century.'' Comparing
&gt; themselves to the reporters who uncovered the Watergate
&gt; scandal, the authors maintain that ''only by such synthesis
&gt; can one discern the underlying continuity, the unified and
&gt; coherent fabric, which lies at the core of any historical
&gt; problem.'' To do so, one must realize that ''it is not
&gt; sufficient to confine oneself exclusively to facts.''

"/>

Where would conspiracy theorists be if they had to confine themselves
to anything as boringly quotidian as mere facts?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thus liberated, Lincoln et al. concoct an argument that is
&gt; not so much factual as fact-ish. Dozens of credible details
&gt; are heaped up in order to provide a legitimizing cushion
&gt; for rank nonsense. Unremarkable legends (that Merovingian
&gt; kings were thought to have a healing touch, for example)
&gt; are characterized as suggestive clues or puzzles demanding
&gt; solution. Highly contested interpretations (that, say, an
&gt; early Grail romance depicts the sacred object as being
&gt; guarded by Templars) are presented as established truth.
&gt; Sources -- such as the New Testament -- are qualified as
&gt; ''questionable'' and derivative when they contradict the
&gt; conspiracy theory, then microscopically scrutinized for
&gt; inconsistencies that might support it.

And, like many anti-Stratfordians, the authors credulously imbibe all
sorts of hilarious hogwash from sources of dubious reliability.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The authors spin one
&gt; gossamer strand of conjecture over another, forming a web
&gt; dense enough to create the illusion of solidity. Though
&gt; bogus, it's an impressive piece of work.

&gt; Finally, though, the legitimacy of the Priory of Sion
&gt; history rests on a cache of clippings and pseudonymous
&gt; documents that even the authors of ''Holy Blood, Holy
&gt; Grail'' suggest were planted in the Bibliotheque Nationale
&gt; by a man named Pierre Plantard. As early as the 1970's, one
&gt; of Plantard's confederates had admitted to helping him
&gt; fabricate the materials, including genealogical tables
&gt; portraying Plantard as a descendant of the Merovingians
&gt; (and, presumably, of Jesus Christ) and a list of the
&gt; Priory's past ''grand masters.'' This patently silly
&gt; catalog of intellectual celebrities stars Botticelli, Isaac
&gt; Newton, Jean Cocteau and, of course, Leonardo da Vinci --
&gt; and it's the same list Dan Brown trumpets, along with the
&gt; alleged nine-century pedigree of the Priory, in the front
&gt; matter for ''The Da Vinci Code,'' under the heading of
&gt; ''Fact.'' Plantard, it eventually came out, was an
&gt; inveterate rascal with a criminal record for fraud and
&gt; affiliations with wartime anti-Semitic and right-wing
&gt; groups. The actual Priory of Sion was a tiny, harmless
&gt; group of like-minded friends formed in 1956.

&gt; Plantard's hoax was debunked by a series of (as yet
&gt; untranslated) French books and a 1996 BBC documentary, but
&gt; curiously enough, this set of shocking revelations hasn't
&gt; proved as popular as the fantasia of ''Holy Blood, Holy
&gt; Grail,'' or, for that matter, as ''The Da Vinci Code.'' The
&gt; only thing more powerful than a worldwide conspiracy, it
&gt; seems, is our desire to believe in one.

If you haven't read _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_, Tom, I highly recommend
it -- it is *really* funny. Caveat lector, however, if a reading of the
book indeed enhances your understanding of Art -- after all, being
unable to understand what Art is gibbering about is a wholesome,
salutary sign of sanity.

'These people' learned it from Strats, Reedy. Shakspear might or
might not have learned Latin at the Stratford grammar school but
Strats have not seen the impossibility of it being disproven.

You never cease to amaze me with your idiocy. Surely even you can see that
the son of an alderman could attend a local school, and if that school
taught Latin, it would be likely that the alderman's son would study the
language? And, perhaps if you apply yourself, you can understand the
difference between informed speculation and the fantasy-driven musings of a
clueless pseudo-scholar like Christian Lanciai?

And (assuming that kid didn't go off and have a wife &amp; 3 children before
he was 20) how he possibly could go on to write _Venus &amp; Adonis_ and courtly
dramas such as _Loves Labour's Lost_ in his twentys while also becoming a
prosperous business man.
