Is George W. Bush a Catholic Saint?
By W. Christopher Epler
Created Oct 5 2006 - 8:03am

Where the bloody hell has the Catholic Church been during the last 6 years?

Talk about "disconnection"! Here's this gigantic, international religious
organization that's forever talking about morality and God, but boy is it
ever turning a blind eye to someone who arguably is the anti Christ of the
3rd millennia (if you like to play such theological games). A disapproving
word or two from the Pope or some relevant Cardinal or Bishop could have
electrified the planet. But silentio, silentio, silentio.

Dear God, what does Bush have to do to get the attention of these Catholic
prelates? Eat his children? Castrate the Senate Democrats? Give the finger
to the Trinity?

How about murdering New Orleans? Silentio. How about Bushian Texas energy
companies raping Mother Nature? Silentio. How about tax breaks for
multimillionaires and back breaks for the middle class. Remember the middle
class? Remember the "lower" class. Jesus did! Well, Rome apparently doesn't.

The Bush/Republicans are literally exterminating the middle and lower
classes in America. We're being taxed into oblivion, our health programs and
retirement plans are being exterminated. Our science funding (e.g.,
embryonic stem cell research) and education policies are being abandoned.
Millionaires are becoming multimillionaires and multimillionaires are
becoming billionaires.

The main thing Jesus Christ talked about was the agony inflicted upon the
poor by the rich. In other words, EXACTLY what the Bush Family is doing to
America. But, silentio, silentio, silentio.

This is not meant to be flip. The Catholic Church has simply abandoned the
planet to this brain-dead monster.

What is the Church so afraid of? We honestly don't know, but how DARE the
Catholic Church give sermons about Jesus and the poor in spirit (and pocket)
at the same time they systematically, support the Bush/Republicans by
default.

When liars and greed vampires and war lords are running amuck, you're
supposed to say something. You're supposed to speak out.

But do you hear any consistent, strong disapproval and denunciation of the
Bush Family moral toilet coming from Rome or the Pope. Naturally, there have
been a handful of exceptions, but these are simply the exceptions which
prove the rule: silentio, silentio, silentio.

Jesus may be weeping, but it's as if the Catholic Church doesn't even
exist -- certainly not as a religion with conscience and courage.

The silence of the Catholic Church during these last 6 Bush/Republican years
is infinitely contemptible.

He is close to the truth. Actually, the Bush fascists are
trying to destroy the middle class and only leave the
very wealthy and an ignorant peasant class.

Pardon me for assuming you were sincere and giving you the respect of
reading what you posted.  I did not know you were trolling.

Wow, you really believe that, huh?  Why would they do that?  Are you
actually suggesting that the Neo-Con agenda is to revert the USA to a third
world country with no middle class to support the economy?  Who's going to
all the jobs of the middle class?  Are you suggesting they are going to
bring people up from the middle class to the very wealthy just to be middle
managers?  How do they benefit from a country that can not compete with
other countries with middle classes?

So, you think that there are people in the government that wish to
completely subjugate the entire population under slavery, and yet you
support leftist gun laws?  Neo-Cons don't support disarming the population,
so how do you suppose they are going to enforce this Machiavellian power
grab?  An armed population guarantees these things can not succeed.  They
protect liberty.
