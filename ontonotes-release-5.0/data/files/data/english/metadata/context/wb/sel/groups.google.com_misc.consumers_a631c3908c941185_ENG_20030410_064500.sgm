Tonight I was going to dine at a restaurant which I have a gift certificate
for. The gift certificate is for $25.

At the restaurant when I presented the gift certificate, I was told that the
gift certificates were no longer being honored. Apparently the restaurant
got new owners within the last few weeks and they were not honoring the
former issued gift certificates.

I was under the impression that when one bought a business, unless there was
a bankruptcy, the new owners aquired the obligations of the old owners.
This business was operating in the same location under the same name. I
spoke with the new owner and asked him if the old owners filed bankruptcy.
He indicated no--it was just an &quot;asset sale.&quot;

Is this legitimate?

FWIW, the business is Petralla's Italian Cafe in Pensacola, FL.

If I was the person who paid for the gift certificate I'd be pissed.

"/> That wouldn't fly in California - especially if it was a gift
certificate issued and sold by the restaurant. If it was a special
promotional offer (not to be sold), the rules are slightly different,
but in California, gift certificates cannot have an expiration date.

1749.5. (a) On or after January 1, 1997, it is unlawful for any
person or entity to sell a gift certificate to a purchaser containing
an expiration date. Any gift certificate sold after that date shall
be redeemable in cash for its cash value, or subject to replacement
with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder.
(b) A gift certificate sold without an expiration date is valid
until redeemed or replaced.
(c) This section shall not apply to any of the following gift
certificates issued on or after January 1, 1998, provided the
expiration date appears in capital letters in at least 10-point font
on the front of the gift certificate:
(1) Gift certificates that are distributed by the issuer to a
consumer pursuant to an awards, loyalty, or promotional program
without any money or other thing of value being given in exchange for
the gift certificate by the consumer.
(2) Gift certificates that are sold below face value at a volume
discount to employers or to nonprofit and charitable organizations
for fundraising purposes if the expiration date on those gift
certificates is not more than 30 days after the date of sale.
(3) Gift certificates that are issued for a food product.

1749.6. (a) A gift certificate constitutes value held in trust by
the issuer of the gift certificate on behalf of the beneficiary of
the gift certificate. The value represented by the gift certificate
belongs to the beneficiary, or to the legal representative of the
beneficiary to the extent provided by law, and not to the issuer.
(b) An issuer of a gift certificate who is in bankruptcy shall
continue to honor a gift certificate issued prior to the date of the
bankruptcy filing on the grounds that the value of the gift
certificate constitutes trust property of the beneficiary.
(c) (1) This section does not alter the terms of a gift
certificate. The terms of a gift certificate may not make its
redemption or other use invalid in the event of a bankruptcy.
(2) This section does not require, unless otherwise required by
law, the issuer of a gift certificate to:
(A) Redeem a gift certificate for cash.
(B) Replace a gift certificate that has been lost or stolen.
(C) Maintain a separate account for the funds used to purchase the
gift certificate.
(d) (1) This section does not create an interest in favor of the
beneficiary of the gift certificate in any specific property of the
issuer.
(2) This section does not create a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary
relationship between the beneficiary of the gift certificates and the
issuer, unless otherwise provided by law.
(3) The issuer of a gift certificate has no obligation to pay
interest on the value of the gift certificate held in trust under
this section, unless otherwise provided by law.

"/> While they aren't building any customer loyalty, I can see why they
aren't honoring them. A couple years back, I took over an existing
store after their lease ran out. I purchased all the equipment, but
changed the name of the store and the product line. Within days of
being open, I had a large number of customers attempt to redeem their
GC's from the previous store. It seems that once the employees and
managers found out the store was closing, they handed the GC's out to
anyone that made a purchase. To placate the customers that were loyal
to the previous store, I offered a discount off their purchase if they
presented the GC and ended up gaining some loyal customers.

It's not the same situation, but it's possible the previous owners
might be giving them out to friends and family since it doesn't affect
their bottom line, the restaurant has been sold.

specifically stated in the sale. And who would be crazy enough to
accept that deal? Any debt owed to vendors, IRS, etc are paid with the

proceeds of the sale, or at least should be. I would doubt that it's
illegal to refuse the GC, they should have offered at least some sort
of discount to try and rectify the situation.

"/> That might be the case, but it doesn't seem particularly fair. I
can see where it would fit into a prize or something the establishment
gave away, but someone has actually given money to the place to
buy the gift certificate. It's a prepayment. It's like someone
ordering something, being told to pay upfront, and then the company
doesn't deliver, saying &quot;well, we changed our mind and won't give
you this item, but thanks for the money you gave us&quot;.

I might slightly see some limitations on when someone buys a
certificate to a specific item, ie a gift certificate for
a large cone and Ben &amp; Jerry's. If the cost of the ice cream
goes up, one is getting it at the price paid for the certificate,
which might mean a loss for the company as time goes by.

But when someone buys a gift certificate of some denomination,
if the price of food goes up they merely don't get as much
food when they cash in the certificate.

You may want to contact your local legislator's office for information.
Some states require by statute that gift certificates be honored for a
period of time after purchase.

something like five years, guaranteed. Another bank bought the
_assets_ of my bank, and unilaterally announced that they were
reducing my interest rate. I checked with the Feds and it was legal.

So in this case it's at least possible that when the OP said the new
restaurant bought the _assets_ of the old restaurant, that was
actually true. In that case the $25 paid for the gift certificate
passes to the new owners, but the obligation to service the gift
certificate (the liability) remains with the old owners. If that is
true -- and I say _if_, because we don't have all the facts, then
the OP's recourse is probably against the old owners, who will have
to refund the $25 out of the proceeds of the sale, unless of course
those proceeds have already gone to pay off other creditors.

Regardless, the OP should do what nobody (so far) has suggested:
call the consumer protection division or attorney general's office
and ask about this.

I think the question really depends on whether they purchased the
parts of the business or they purchased the business. I believe that
even with the same business name on the outside an argument could
still be made that this is a new business if the paperwork is handled
properly in the sale.

I would also question whether &quot;terms and conditions may change at any
time&quot; is valid. It seems to me that a term such as this is unfair and
may be unenforceable. After all, how can you have agreement on terms
that do not yet exist?

In the end, whether it is legal or not is rarely an issue. A company
will make a decision based on what they want to do. Whether it is a
$25 certificate or a $10,000 contract.

My best suggestion is file a BBB complaint and an attorney general
complaint against the company and leave it at that.

However, the contract would be formed by performance, because why else
would the buyer pay $25 (for example) and the seller accept it if there
was no intent to form an agreement? I don't think it's routine for
people to just give gifts of $25 to restaurants.

A contract can be formed on terms that aren't exactly definite though.
For example, price can be set at &quot;the current market price&quot;, and quantity
can be set as an output contract.

"/> Yes, now that I think of it a little more, you may be able to make a
good arguement regarding false or deceptive advertising or use some
other consumer protection statute to make a case regarding it. After
all, the restaurant is using the name of the old restaurant to promote
their business.

However, believe me the time and expense at court is very expensive.
If you decide to do something on principal make sure that you believe
that the principal of the matter is worth the expense and time that it
will cost. I have sued on principal before and have spent $3,000
before to collect $300, knowing from day one that I would lose 10
times the amount proceeding with the matter.

This is a bit more on the creative thinking/crazy side, but for the
sake of argument. A person purchases the restaurant equipment, signs,
and location. The previous restaurant has existing coupons, specials,
etc. They do not change the signage or store in any way.

The problem this creates is that the store is now portraying an image
that they are in fact the same restaurant. It is very likely that
this would be done or believed to be done in order to retain the
previous business of the restaurant.

If they actively appear to be pretending to be the old restaurant it
becomes clear that they are actively attempting to deceive the public
into believing that they are in fact the old restaurant. This
therefore could possibly be argued to be a deceptive practice.

Of course, it would not be quite this simple to argue, but I think by
keeping the name and elements of the restaurant the same it creates an
opening that allows many other elements to be considered and possibly
argued as a deceptive practice.

Keep in mind that most statutes regarding deceptive practices are not
highly specific as to what creates the deceptive practice. Florida
for example, states:

Unfair methods of competition, unconscionable acts or practices, and
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or
commerce are hereby declared unlawful.

Of course, this would not create a contract when a contract does not
exist. My previous post was not clear and was misleading when I
stated &quot;other consumer protection statute to make a case regarding
it&quot;. What I meant to say was that it may create another cause of
action. Your point regarding novation is valid and even if they were
deemed to violate a deceptive practices act they would not become
contractually obligated as they would remain two separate causes of
action.

&gt; t...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tonight I was going to dine at a restaurant which I have a gift
&gt; certificate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for. The gift certificate is for $25.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At the restaurant when I presented the gift certificate, I was
&gt; told that
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gift certificates were no longer being honored. Apparently the
&gt; restaurant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; got new owners within the last few weeks and they were not
&gt; honoring the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; former issued gift certificates.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was under the impression that when one bought a business,
&gt; unless there
&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a bankruptcy, the new owners aquired the obligations of the old
&gt; owners.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This business was operating in the same location under the same
&gt; name. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spoke with the new owner and asked him if the old owners filed
&gt; bankruptcy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He indicated no--it was just an &quot;asset sale.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this legitimate?

&gt;&gt; Yes, if (as I assume was the case) there is fine print on the gift
&gt;&gt; certificate or the original purchaser's receipt saying something
&gt; like
&gt;&gt;&quot;terms may be changed without notice&quot; or &quot;gift certificates valid at
&gt;&gt; restaurant's sole discretion&quot; or something like that.

&gt; I doubt that--it was not a coupon. The gift certificate is
&gt; essentially a contract with the certificate given in exchange for the
&gt; consideration of $25, and qualifying language of that type would be
&gt; highly unusual. While the new owners personally were not parties to
&gt; the contract, it appears that they purchased the corporate entity that
&gt; was a party, and, as such, the restaurant is responsible. That $25
&gt; is reflected somewhere in the assets acquired by the new owners.

"/> Not necessarily, if the sale of the restaurant was a sale of assets
(and proper notice was given to creditors), the liability would not
transfer and would still be on the previous owners. It isn't unheard
of for small businesses to be transferred this way (and the OP's
followups indicate that that is what the new owners are claiming). If
so, the GC holder's claim would be against the former owners, and a
small claims court would likely hold that they are liable for the GC's
value.

"/> First, if it stays in small claims you can expect the filing fee and 1
to 2 days of court time. This is expensive in comparision of the
amount they are looking to collect. Remember the old saying time is
money. Thus your $30 judgment may cost $300, in comparision of the
amount of the judgment that is expensive.

Second, there is a fatal flaw in your arguement, it might not stay in
small claims. Many jurisdictions have methods in which you may remove
the small claims action from small claims court. Arizona for example
allows either party to request the small claims matter to be
transfered to the Justice Courts. Once that happens you are subject
to the regular rules of civil procedure.

When you consider court you have to consider that it might not result
in a legal, logical, or responsible result. It is not uncommon for a
person to counter sue you for no reason and drag the matter out in
regular court if they are allowed to do so in their jurisdictions.
Unfortunately, time missed at work, travel time, many costs and
expenses, are not covered, thus they come out of your pocket.

The Feds (whatever agency it was that supervised the S&amp;L 'cleanup';
this is more than a decade ago so excuse the hell out of me for not
remembering the agency name) said that the legislation allowed banks
to void contracts with their depositors when they were acquired by
other banks. They had to pay back the principal and the interest
accrued to date (I guess we should be grateful for that), but did
not have to honor the contracts after that.

It's rather interesting that the Constitution forbids _states_ to
void contracts (Art I sec 10) but puts no such prohibition on
Congress.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this legitimate?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, if (as I assume was the case) there is fine print on the gift
&gt;&gt;&gt; certificate or the original purchaser's receipt saying something
&gt;&gt; like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;terms may be changed without notice&quot; or &quot;gift certificates valid at
&gt;&gt;&gt; restaurant's sole discretion&quot; or something like that.

&gt;&gt; I doubt that--it was not a coupon. The gift certificate is
&gt;&gt; essentially a contract with the certificate given in exchange for the
&gt;&gt; consideration of $25, and qualifying language of that type would be
&gt;&gt; highly unusual. While the new owners personally were not parties to
&gt;&gt; the contract, it appears that they purchased the corporate entity that
&gt;&gt; was a party, and, as such, the restaurant is responsible. That $25
&gt;&gt; is reflected somewhere in the assets acquired by the new owners.

&gt; Not necessarily, if the sale of the restaurant was a sale of assets
&gt; (and proper notice was given to creditors), the liability would not
&gt; transfer and would still be on the previous owners. It isn't unheard
&gt; of for small businesses to be transferred this way (and the OP's
&gt; followups indicate that that is what the new owners are claiming). If
&gt; so, the GC holder's claim would be against the former owners, and a
&gt; small claims court would likely hold that they are liable for the GC's
&gt; value.

"/> That's generally how such small businesses are transferred
(assets sale, including perhaps the name). One corporation buys
the assets of another, but not the corporation itself. My
understanding is that this is primarily a liability issue. The
new corporation cannot be held liable for anything before the
date of sale, since all they're buying is fixtures and perhaps a
name. The new corporation is often dissolved, so there would be
no one to go after.

As sleazy as it is, I think the OP is stuck. I'd think the
restaurant would eat the thing, rather than lose a customer for
life though. Some businesses aren't very forward looking.

&gt; I'd have to do some research, obviously, but the practice is so common that

&gt; now, if it's tortious.

"/> You may be right, however, I expect a deceptive practice will be
highly dependant on the situation.

By keeping the same name I see an opening where you can consider
various factors that may create a situation of a deceptive practice.
Consider the difference between a Mcdonalds and a world renowned
restaurant. Do you think the result would be the same between a mass
produced product compared to that of a specialized product? Also,
consider is there name value to a product or service? People actively
protect trademarks as it is understood the name itself often caries a
reputation, product expectation, and belief that people rely on when
purchasing an item or service.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The better course is to sue both the new and old owner under breach of
&gt;&gt; contract and let them figure out who is responsible.

&gt; Wouldn't that lead to sanctions against the plaintiff (or at least his
&gt; counsel) for the new owner, if the argument is that weak and the court
&gt; agrees? I mean, I wouldn't risk sanctions on an argument that I myself
&gt; thought was weak.

"/> It is common practice for an attorney to sue all parties involved.
This is a generally accepted practice.

Keep in mind the liability regarding the certificate can rest in
either the new or the old owner. We do not know at this point the
exact particulars of the transfer of ownership nor do we know if there
exists an assumption of the obligations by the new owner. There also
may be situations where the new owner may still be liable.

The problem is that we do know at this point if the arguement is weak
and we probably will not know this until after such time as we receive
discovery from the appropriate parties. If we have reason to believe
the arguement is weak we should not proceed with a suit against the
party where the arguement is weak. If we find out later the arguement
is weak we should dismiss the case against that party for which the
case is weak.

I also believe that we should be proactive and attempt to determine
liability prior to filing a lawsuit against either party, however, my
past experience has shown that most people are not willing to provide
any information until they are required to do so by law.

"/> Oh no, it's the offset argument! You notify a company of non
conformity, they have your personal property in their possession, when
the notice regarding non conformity expires and the default is not
cured you then send them a formal notice regarding breach and advise
them of termination. They then grab all your property as collateral
for the debt which is either a penalty for cancellation or the
remaining contract term of the contract they breached by not curing
their default.

Sorry, but when you take action that you might not have legal recourse
to take, you lose all validity in my book. However, I guess this is
more a moral argument than a legal argument, but I think businesses,
people, our legal system, and attorneys would get a far better

&gt;&gt;&gt; For instance, I had a CD with some bank back when interest rates
&gt;&gt;&gt; were high in the reign of George I. I was getting 10% a year for
&gt;&gt;&gt; something like five years, guaranteed. Another bank bought the
&gt;&gt;&gt; _assets_ of my bank, and unilaterally announced that they were
&gt;&gt;&gt; reducing my interest rate. I checked with the Feds and it was legal.

"/> That may have something to do with _how_ the new bank acquired the
&quot;assets&quot; of your old bank. If our old bank &quot;failed&quot; (didn't have
enough assets to pay its liabilities), the FDIC probably stepped in
and arranged a deal where the new bank took over. In that case, the
new bank gets to reduce the _future_ interest on CDs. The theory
behind all this is that the old bank may have &quot;failed&quot; because of
offering more interest than it market conditions would allow it to
pay. Without this little wrinkle, nobody would be willing to take over
the bank unless the FDIC (read _taxpayers_) threw a lot of money into
the deal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; So in this case it's at least possible that when the OP said the new
&gt;&gt;&gt; restaurant bought the _assets_ of the old restaurant, that was
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually true. In that case the $25 paid for the gift certificate
&gt;&gt;&gt; passes to the new owners, but the obligation to service the gift
&gt;&gt;&gt; certificate (the liability) remains with the old owners.

"/> Well, there's a special rule about this, called something like the
&quot;bulk sales&quot; rule. It says that if somebody acquires all or most of
the assets of a business, the liabilities automatically go with them.
Otherwise you get cute sham transactions like this one:

. Company A is having troubles. So the top executives start a new
company, Company B.
. Company B buys the assets of Company A at a discount.
. Company B then goes merrily on its way, leaving the creditors of
Company A in the lurch.

Federal law won't allow that trick or others like it.

However, *if* the old owners of the restaurant have enough money to
cover the outstanding liabilities (including gift certificates), it
would probably be better to just get them to repay you instead.

Of course, if you have time on your hands, you can walk back and forth
in front of the restaurant with a picket sign. I have plans like that
for a restaurant in Solvang if/when I retire...

is a little dull one time. Or if I have to send something back once

Oh, there's some restaurants that can afford to lose a customer or
two. Losing one customer won't kill The Cheescake Factory or Tommy's
or The Original Pantry. But it's a funny thing about most of those
places that _could_ afford to lose a customer. Just try complaining
about something. I bet they either re-do it or say &quot;you eat for
free&quot;.

I recall one chinese restaurant, Tum Sum Low in the Palms area of LA.
We went there every couple of weeks, then for some reason got bored
and didn't go back for a few months. Next time we went by, they were
closed. Too bad, in a way. They were our first introduction to Kung
Pao Chicken, and *boy* was it hot. (Partly because they made it with
fresh peppers instead of dried, so they weren't obviously inedible,
and we didn't know you weren't supposed to eat the peppers.) But,
masochists that we are we loved it and kept going back for more.
Now, it probably wasn't just two people, but if we got bored then
probably a few other customers got bored too. And they went below the
line where they could pay their employees and the rent, and that was
the end.

90% of all restaurants die in the first year. It's a tough business.
Any restaurant with the kind of attitude documented by OP is on it's
way out.

&gt; time. But if my first experience is bad, it's all over.

waitress didn't see the issue. That pushed me over the edge and
we didn't go back for ten years.

&gt; Oh, there's some restaurants that can afford to lose a customer or
&gt; two. Losing one customer won't kill The Cheescake Factory or Tommy's
&gt; or The Original Pantry. But it's a funny thing about most of those
&gt; places that _could_ afford to lose a customer. Just try complaining
&gt; about something. I bet they either re-do it or say &quot;you eat for
&gt; free&quot;.

&gt; I recall one chinese restaurant, Tum Sum Low in the Palms area of LA.
&gt; We went there every couple of weeks, then for some reason got bored
&gt; and didn't go back for a few months. Next time we went by, they were
&gt; closed. Too bad, in a way. They were our first introduction to Kung
&gt; Pao Chicken, and *boy* was it hot. (Partly because they made it with
&gt; fresh peppers instead of dried, so they weren't obviously inedible,
&gt; and we didn't know you weren't supposed to eat the peppers.) But,
&gt; masochists that we are we loved it and kept going back for more.
&gt; Now, it probably wasn't just two people, but if we got bored then
&gt; probably a few other customers got bored too. And they went below the
&gt; line where they could pay their employees and the rent, and that was
&gt; the end.

"/> That's a different issue really. I get bored of restaurants too.
We go one place most Sundays for brunch. The food is so-so
(getting bored ;-) and reasonable but the wait-staff is
delightful. It's more like seeing friends than going to a
restaurant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 90% of all restaurants die in the first year. It's a tough business.
&gt; Any restaurant with the kind of attitude documented by OP is on it's
&gt; way out.

"/> Agreed. Perhaps they should be pointed to this thread. ;-)/2

&gt; We never went back there either. My wife didn't enjoy smelling
&gt; like a brewery for a night. They didn't comp us squat. Any
&gt; management worth their pay would have given us a next-meal-free,
&gt; just to try to get us back into the place. That's fine, there
&gt; are other places that want our money more

"/> I didm't go back to a restaurant becaause the waitress lied to me. She said
her name was Sand and she alleged that her parents
had conceived her on a beach and hence the name
but not true
i saw her name on the receipt and her name was really sandra
