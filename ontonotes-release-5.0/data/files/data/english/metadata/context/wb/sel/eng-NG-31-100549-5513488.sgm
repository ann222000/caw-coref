Ok, please tell me someone knows what is going on here!

I have a '97 9000 Aero with 200k miles. Recently (about 300 miles ago)
developed a weird metallic knock in the left front drive train (it
actually sounds like the 'click' from a torque wrench, just 20 times
louder). It occurs when I accelerate and also when I let off the
accelerator. The more gently I accelerate, or decelerate, the softer
the noise. If I disengage the clutch before decel, I don't hear it.
The noise sounds like a light clunk in the cabin with the windows up,
but with the left window down, it's up to full volume. You can not
hear much from the right window, so it's definitely on the left side.
The weird, and disturbing, point is that it came on very suddenly, I
did not notice it building at all.

Listed (far) below are the steps I have taken to isolate the problem
(so you can skip over as much of my OCD babble as possible). Being the
cynic I am, I have now assumed that the problem has maximum PITA
potential. There seems to be an abnormal amount of play (in terms of
how many degrees you can rotate the wheel) in the transmission when
rotating the left wheel back and forth (tranny in gear, right wheel on
the ground). In addition, it sounds a little loud the differential
housing when I rotate the wheel. It's much less noticeable if the
tranny is in neutral and you can freely spin the left wheel, but it is
still there. My thought is there is some slop in the gearing in the
final end of the trans, and the application of power, and also the
compression braking of the engine during decel, are making two gears
slap together over some excessive play, but I have no idea where!

If anybody has any experience with this problem, or even any advice on
what to do next (other than going to a mechanic, transmission shop, or
the local theivin' Saab dealer), I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Charlie

What I have determined thus far:

The caliper is firmly in place and the pads show no problems (~60%
thickness). The rotor retaining screw and wheel locating stud are snug
and there is no play in the rotor/spindle mounting.

The ball joint is tight and shows no signs of problems. The steering
rack and links are tight and visibly fine.

The inboard universal joint on the left side appears to be OK. The
rollers and their needles seem to be fine and the drive cup shows no
abnormal wear spots.

The outer CV new, but I checked it anyway. There appears to be no
slack and it moves smoothly. It is a OEM replacement (Lobro, not
ScanTech) that has about 2 years and 30k miles on it, so it should be
fine.

The wheel bearing was shot, but it was replaced before this came up,
so that should not be an issue. Just to be paranoid (a frequent
problem of mine, you may notice), I swapped out the new bearing for an
old one I had. The knock was still there, it was just harder to hear
over the noise of a bad bearing. After returning the new bearing to
it's proper place (with a new axle nut), the noise remained the same.

The struts are new and their bearing pads seem fine. All mounting
bolts are snug.

Upper motor mounts, lower tranny mount and front lower hydraulic motor
mounts are all new and snug, no issues there. The rear hydraulic mount
appears to be fine as well.

Exhaust does not seem to be knocking on anything.

Intentionally or unintentionally I think your doagnosis is steering us
(and you) to the gear box, to which professional help may be required.

Might be the driveshaft test it by drive approximately 25 mph in a wide
circle test one direction first then the other and it's a great help if you
are two when performing this one drives the other listen,and it needs a
large preferly empty space,when testing this steer as snug you can cause the
harder the louder the noice will be.
Be precausious when performing this
Driveshaft is a common problem on SAAB especially the 900 models but even on
the 9000 series it occures.
I have a friend who owned a1989 9000 a couple of years ago and we did this
test when he got those weird noices.
Hope this was for some help
Regards
