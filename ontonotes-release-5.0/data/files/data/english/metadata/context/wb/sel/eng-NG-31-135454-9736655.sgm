Getting this error when attempting to install 10.3 rc1 x64 on sda, it
has a primary ntfs partition, a primary ext3 partition, and a extended
partition with reiserfs installed as a logical partition. The message
says something is beyond the physical disk size.The disk works with no
problems at all, xp(hda3, 46.68 gb, Yoper(hda1 23.0 gb) and home(hda5
23.68 gb) respectively. The parted boot cd shows no problems at all. Had
10.2 on hda1 with no problems, tried to put 10.3 on hda1(sda1)and these
errors showed up, Installed Yoper 3.01 on it with no problem at all.
Any advice, really don't want to blow away the xp partition, microsoft
can really be a pita about updating and registeration even though it's a
legal version.
Thanks,
Jack

I have the same problem with this new Lenovo AMD Athlon 64x2 and a 220GiB
SATA drive.  Best answer the the obvious WTF? question was from the author
of DFSEE (multi-platform disk maintenance program).  According to Jan, Win
has begun to partition the drives to the nearest sector rather than setting
the partitions to start/end on cylinder boundaries.  On mine, the mapping
defined for the drive actually indicates that the end of the drive is
beyond the physical end of the disk using the Linux algorithm for
partitions.  Even the disk utility I use sees a number of sectors beyond
the last partition it will allocate using cylinder boundary rules.  In this
case, it appears that Linux will round Win-created partitions up to the
next cylinder bound and truncate the disk to the last full cylinder.  The
net result is that you may lose some sectors at the end of the disk, there
may be some unused sectors between the Win partions and the partitions
created by Linux but the disk will still work just fine.

I didn't try the Linux partitoning - some OS's don't like the way Linux
computes the partiton table and EBR links, especially OS/2, so I use DFSEE
for disk setup work.  From the tests I've run, Linux may bitch about the
partition boundaries but 10.2 and 10.3 definitely handle the result just
fine.  No lost data or wrap-around write as far as I've been able to test.
