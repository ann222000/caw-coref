Okay... so how many people here think the $100 price drop is enough to
justify a purchase of the PS3?

I'll admit openly that I'm tempted... but now that I have a baby to
support, my $500 needs to be spent on diapers, formula, clothing, etc.

If this had happened 3 1/2 weeks ago, I might have seriously
considered it since I was still in &quot;last shopping of my life&quot; mode,
but the second Alexander came out my priorities changed completely.

So does the $100 help? The system still needs games, of course, but
supposedly those are coming a little bit later in the year.

How about this scenario... Lair comes out, Metal Gear Solid 4 comes
out, Ratchet &amp; Clank comes out, Final Fantasy XIII comes out... now is
the system worth $500?

I'm just curious about what the 360'ers and other people in general
are thinking.

If it was just for the PS3 system and I didn't have one in my home already?
I don't think $100 price drop would do it for me unless games like Warhawk,
Heavenly Sword, Lair, Ratchet &amp; Clank, etc were already out. Actually if one
or 2 of those games were out and scored welll I would probably pick it up
for the price drop.

The thing that does motivate me and most likely will others is the 5 Blu Ray
movies you get with the summer deal going on right now. Circuit City is
rumored to be offering 5 Blu Ray movies of their own plus the Summer deal. I
don't think CC will be able to keep them in stock when this happens. I am
almost considering purchasing another PS3 at CC just to get that deal.

I have no clue if it's enough or not. I do hope the PS3 takes off, and
I am pretty sure it will by years end. I'll buy one at some point.
After having a few Xbox problems, it would totally suck for MS to be
the only console. MS makes half assed products when there is alot of
competition, I can't imagine the crap they would produce if there were
no competition.

Game playing experience without the rumble effect on the PS3 wireless
controller is one of the two reasons I am not interesting in getting the
PS3 console now.  The second reason is that PS3 does not include a HDMI
cable.  So, the $100 price drop is not quite a good deal just yet.

The lack of an HDMI cable isn't too big a deal for me right now since
I can just use component and get the same 720p I get with my 360.

Plus HDMI has been a pain in my ass because of the receiver I have,
which only support pass-through with HDMI cables (meaning the audio
doesn't get processed by the receiver if I'm using an HDMI cable to
connect the source).

Someone posted a possible work around involving optical audio cables
but I haven't tried it yet.

In any case, I can certainly live with component cables for HD.

I'll probably just hold out for another price drop, though. If Sony
dropped the price a second time before the holidays, I would be MUCH
more inclined to pick a unit up since by that time a few interesting
games should be out.

As much as I don't like Sony and have never been a fan of the
Playstation brand and most of the associated library of games, I would
hate for Sony to completely fail out of the industry like Sega did.

Competition is ALWAYS good... plus wouldn't usenet get boring if we
lost Blig Merk and all the other PS fans? :-D

That's certainly very tempting. 10 Blu-Ray movies for AT LEAST $20 a
pop even on sites like Amazon and Deep Discount... that's $200 right
there! Theoretically, you could look at it as a PS3 for only $300 at
that point...

Unfortunately, even then my wife would probably not be impressed. When
I got the HD-DVD player, she told me that I wasn't allowed to buy any
movies that I already owned on DVD to which I responded that would be
idiotic because that would eliminate movies like LOTR, Matrix, etc.
She DID relent on the Matrix movies though...

She's of the mind that while the visual upgrades are nice they're not
THAT significant and not worth having to spend upwards of $20 for a
movie.

The only one she's shown any interest in is the Planet Earth HD-DVD
because she likes to look at nature scenes in HD...

LOL

As a 360 player, I can admit that getting Blu-Ray, a more stable platform
and basically a small number of exclusives is tempting. However, after you
spend a fortune just getting the 360 and the games that you want, you don't
have another fortune to spend on a PS3.

Yes! In answer to your original question, another hundred dollars and

I purchased my Xbox 360 from the second shipment in December of 2005
so I count that initial small fortune spent as ancient history. :-D

Unfortunately, to my wife, it might as well have been yesterday. :-(

She thinks I should be grateful just to have 2 of the 3 systems plus
all of the portable systems... I can understand that point of view to
a degree.

She says the money is bad enough but an additional video game system
would also result in less time spent with her. :-P

Also, I can't really argue with her current logic that another system
would be a gargantuan waste of money when I don't have time to play
games anymore. Hell, it's hard just to find a couple of hours to pop
in an HD-DVD. I have all of 5 titles - Happy Feet, Letters from Iwo
Jima and the 3 Matrix films - and I haven't even come close to
finishing a single one.

$500 is still too expensive.  I'm still waiting for the 360 to price-drop.

By the time FFXIII comes out, we'll be in mid-2008 at the earliest.  The
360 will have most definitely have had a price drop by then as well.  Also,
the 360 will have Blue Dragon for your J-RPG fix.

On the other hand, I notice that Dynasty Warriors Gundam is coming out for
the PS3 this August (huzzah!)  Being a both a Dynasty Warriors fan AND a
Gundam fan, this could truly be the first real 'Gotta Have It!' title for
me for the PS3.  But at $500...I'll have to pass for the time being.

$500 - closer...but still too expensive.
$400 - tempting...depends on the library at the time.
$300 - Going shopping.

My fourth is coming in September so I am praying that I can get all the kick
ass games that I can stock pile before then  because I will be on video game
&quot;restriction&quot; once that one happens.  I was hoping for at least $150 price
drop for the PS3 before then but it looks like $100 is all I am going to
get.

In all honesty, I think they all believe that.  I think the money has VERY
little to do with it. That is why I love non-shooter co-op games like Marvel

&gt; $500 is still too expensive.  I'm still waiting for the 360 to price-drop.

&gt;&gt; How about this scenario... Lair comes out, Metal Gear Solid 4 comes

&gt;&gt; the system worth $500?

&gt; By the time FFXIII comes out, we'll be in mid-2008 at the earliest.  The

Buy one with the 10 Blu Ray DVD's and sell them off on ebay.
There yah have your PS3 for $300 bucks. Even if it doesn't have games you
want right now you will get it for your price point that most likely won't
happen for real for another 2 years.

Fourth?! Kudos, man, but I don't know how you have a budget for video
games with 3 already in the house...

If Microsoft drops its prices in reaction to the PS3 price drop, it's
very possible Sony may try to cut its prices again come the holiday
season. I'll probably look for that as a possibility but if it's still
$450-470 it's very likely still way too much for me right now.

My wife was into Hexic for a little while but for the most part she
has no interest. She did try for a few weeks to play some of the more
casual games but she doesn't feel she has the coordination or the
patience for most games.

The Nintendo Wii is the only one she can really get into but again
only for short bursts of time. She loves bowling mainly because it's
something we can play together and with our 7-year-old nephew (who
used to hit 4 or 5 strikes in a row each game).

She also likes the tennis game as primitive as it is because 4 people
can play that at the same time.

Well, if you buy a $500 PS3 at Circuit City, you get 5 movies from

Here's the problem, those are all potentially decent games, but:

Lair - not out until August and the preview video didn't look that
hot.
Heavenly Sword - September
Ratchet and Clank - Never been a fan, but that's because the PS2
versions looked like crap. I'd look at it on the PS3, but it's not out
until October.
MGS - March, 2008
Final Fantasy XIII - Not until Spring, 2008 at least.

So really the first game I'd consider doesn't come out until September
and then after that there's a looooong drought until 2008.

&gt; I'll admit openly that I'm tempted... but now that I have a baby to
&gt; support, my $500 needs to be spent on diapers, formula, clothing, etc.

&gt; If this had happened 3 1/2 weeks ago, I might have seriously

&gt; I'm just curious about what the 360'ers and other people in general
&gt; are thinking.
">

See my other post, but here's a summary:

At launch Sony offered two price points for the PS3 they were $499 and
$599. After this &quot;price drop&quot; Sony will be offering two price points
for the PS3 they are $499 and $599.... Ah, but we get a big hard drive
and card reader, etc... Right &quot;But that 20-GB $499 was discontinued
months ago, so IT IS A PRICE CUT&quot; I hear you say, but No it's not....
When Microsoft announced a 120-GB drive would be in the Elite Sony
likely planned a hard drive upgrade anyway (easy part to price match
on), the thing of it is to just announce a hard drive upgrade for the
$499 and $599 models isn't sexy and it doesn't draw headlines.

So they discontinued the 20-GB $499 model so they could (now) &quot;drop
the price&quot; (sorry it has to go in quotes) of the $599 PS3 SKU (you'll
notice they actually pointed out the $599 SKU # in the press release,
they think we're all morons and in this case their marketing
department wants us to chase the $599 SKU down to $499).

The bottom line is the PS3 price has not dropped below the $499 price
it was at launch. This is a clever marketing parlor magic that's been
in the works for a while now and phase I one of this plan was when
they discontinued the 20-GB model, it's sole purpose of being phased
out was to make way for this &quot;price drop&quot;.

&gt;Okay... so how many people here think the $100 price drop is enough to
&gt;justify a purchase of the PS3?

&gt;I'll admit openly that I'm tempted... but now that I have a baby to
&gt;support, my $500 needs to be spent on diapers, formula, clothing, etc.

&gt;If this had happened 3 1/2 weeks ago, I might have seriously
&gt;considered it since I was still in &quot;last shopping of my life&quot; mode,
&gt;but the second Alexander came out my priorities changed completely.

&gt;So does the $100 help? The system still needs games, of course, but
&gt;supposedly those are coming a little bit later in the year.

&gt;How about this scenario... Lair comes out, Metal Gear Solid 4 comes
&gt;out, Ratchet &amp; Clank comes out, Final Fantasy XIII comes out... now is
&gt;the system worth $500?

&gt;I'm just curious about what the 360'ers and other people in general
&gt;are thinking.

It will help but what they really need are some great exclusive games.

I bought one. Amazon's deal was too good to pass up on (been looking
for one as a cheap blu-ray player player). You get the remote ($25)
the movie Memento ($20), both of which I would have bought right off
the bat anyway, for free. And you also get the 5-disc deal on top of
that and free shipping. Couldn't pass up on that for $500.

Too bad there aren't many games on it worth buying yet, or I might
have gotten some of those too.

&gt; Not now, I'll consider it when Heavenly Sword comes out (if Heavenly
&gt; Sword is any good.)

&gt; &gt; How about this scenario... Lair comes out, Metal Gear Solid 4 comes
&gt; &gt; out, Ratchet &amp; Clank comes out, Final Fantasy XIII comes out... now is
&gt; &gt; the system worth $500?

&gt; Here's the problem, those are all potentially decent games, but:

&gt; Lair - not out until August and the preview video didn't look that
&gt; hot.
&gt; Heavenly Sword - September
&gt; Ratchet and Clank - Never been a fan, but that's because the PS2
&gt; versions looked like crap. I'd look at it on the PS3, but it's not out
&gt; until October.

Are you kidding me?  You do realize that none of the reviews out there
accuse the games of poor graphics- rather, the opposite is true in
that the R&amp;C games are universally praised for having great graphics.
The framerates are pretty high, and the animations are top notch.  You
probably should actually play them for more than 1 minute before
dismissing them.  Oh, well.

&gt; MGS - March, 2008
&gt; Final Fantasy XIII - Not until Spring, 2008 at least.

&gt; So really the first game I'd consider doesn't come out until September
&gt; and then after that there's a looooong drought until 2008.

Agreed there, but don't forget Sony nearly had a monopoly in their hands
when Sega pulled out. In fact, Sega gave Sony that generation all to
themselves when they pulled out, as Nintendo and Microsoft weren't going to
enter until the end of the year. That was a whole year Sony had to
themselves to entrench their PS2 and when Xbox and Gamecube arrived, it was
too late to make a dent in PS2's dominance.
But thankfully, we have Microsoft for saving us from a Sony monopoly and
also the surprising resilence of Nintendo. (But then again, they also had
other sources of proffit. Gameboy and Pokemon anyone?)

We'll see what happens with Ps3 and the price cut soon. But I must confese,
I'm enjoying seeing Microsoft and Nintendo on top of Sony for once. :)

Peace.

Believe me, I'm totally with you on Sony being in last place... as
long as they're still in the game...

I've never been a fan of the Playstation brand. I bought the first
system simply for Resident Evil 2. I never bought a Playstation 2. I
realize that there are some great games but there are way too many
crappy games on it. Plus, many of those great games just don't fall
within my tastes.

I'm not a fan of Final Fantasy or Metal Gear Solid, 2 of their big
franchises. I never liked Crash Bandicoot. I never liked their other
mascot-type games like Jak, Ratchet, Sly, etc.

I don't play very many sports games, either, which was a big
contributor to PS1's success in the first place.

I'll assume you're asking about games exclusive to the Playstation
platform.

I love Grand Theft Auto III and everything within that series that
came after it. I know it hasn't been a Playstation exclusive for a
while... I played them on the PC at first and then later on the Xbox
when they were ported.

I haven't had a chance to play Kingdom Hearts yet but I imagine I
would love it because I love the Disney brand and a Disney RPG has
always seemed like a natural idea to me. Incidentally, I'm not a fan
of most RPGs, especially Square ones. Go figure.

Okami looks pretty sweet but I may not ever have a chance to play it.
I was going to buy my friend's PS2 but then realized I might not have
any time for it with the new baby and all. I've lost time on my
current gen consoles already. I'm hoping for Capcom to produce a
version of Okami for the Wii (it fits so well to the gameplay style)
but that's probably just a pipe dream.

I love the Resident Evil franchise and I'm kind of fond of the Silent
Hill franchise. Both were Playstation exclusives at one point although
that point has long passed.

There were a couple of others that I can't remember right now off the
top of my head but you get the picture. It's just a handful of games
that interest me on the Playstation side of things.

I'm a big fan of first-person shooters so games like Halo, Rainbow
Six, GRAW, Gears of War, etc. appeal to me. Oh yeah... SOCOM... that's
another PS exclusive I'm interested in. :-)

I loved KOTOR and KOTOR 2 to a much lesser degree. The BioWare PC-
style RPGs were much more interesting to me... plus it helps that
BioWare's work has been based on licenses that I like (which is
probably why I haven't mustered the incentive to touch Jade Empire
even though I own it).

I like many of Nintendo's classic franchises since they were the games
I grew up on. Mario, Paper Mario, Super Smash Bros., Zelda, Donkey
Kong... love all those.

While everyone was busy bashing the Nintendo 64, I was enjoying Mario
Kart, Mario Tennis, Diddy Kong Racing, Donkey Kong 64, Ocarina of
Time, the original Super Smash Bros., Mickey's Speedway, the Mario
Party games, etc.

Technically correct, but...

The $500 model was never &quot;really&quot; available, was it? I know they had
some at launch, but ever since the PS3 became plentiful I haven't seen
the 20 GB version. Most likely because retailers stopped stocking them
(source: http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/17/best-buy-done-with-ps3-20gb/
).

The 80 GB version isn't available yet.

So people browsing the stores that are aware of PS3 prices see the 60
GB version that they've been watching for months drop fro $600 to
$500. Clerks who never saw the 20 GB model are all excited over the
new price point.

You can see the results already, sales of the PS3 have doubled. In the
end, cutting the price will have been a good idea and the $600 version
will be the new 'tard pack. Because you'd have to be retarded to pay
$100 extra for 20 GB of space and a game.

&gt; some at launch, but ever since the PS3 became plentiful I haven't seen
&gt; the 20 GB version. Most likely because retailers stopped stocking them
&gt; (source: http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/17/best-buy-done-with-ps3-20gb/
&gt; ).

&gt; The 80 GB version isn't available yet.

&gt; So people browsing the stores that are aware of PS3 prices see the 60
&gt; GB version that they've been watching for months drop fro $600 to
&gt; $500. Clerks who never saw the 20 GB model are all excited over the
&gt; new price point.

&gt; You can see the results already, sales of the PS3 have doubled. In the
&gt; end, cutting the price will have been a good idea and the $600 version
&gt; will be the new 'tard pack. Because you'd have to be retarded to pay
&gt; $100 extra for 20 GB of space and a game.

'Doubled' - hahaha - they sold less than half the number that the 360
has all over, except Japan - but they had their price cut since
launch, and yet the Ps3 is languishing at less than 35k sold in a
whole month (compared to the Wii, which has outsold every other system
combined).

The Ps3 really needed to double sales, otherwise it would look even
worse.

My prediction for June NPD is that the PS3 sold less than half the
360, and less than 1/4 the Wii.
Doubling sales in July would mean simply catching up. And it's a
temporary blip anyway - once the 60 gigs have sold out, there will no
longer be any PS3s at $500.

&gt; Sega Saturn = best system ever made for 2D fighters.  Especially with the

I thought the Sega Saturn's gamepad was MUCH better than the PS1's for
2D fighters. I had loads of fun thrashing my college buddy in Street
Fighter games on his Saturn.

Retailers made the decision to stop stocking that version only a
couple months ago.

The main problem was that Sony simply wasn't shipping them after the
holiday season.

I'd love for Sony to post actual statistics supporting this claim.
Thus far, everyone has to just take their word for this...
