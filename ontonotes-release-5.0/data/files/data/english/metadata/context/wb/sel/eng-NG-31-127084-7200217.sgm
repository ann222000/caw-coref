Thank you all for your prayers.  The surgery went well.  My doctor was
quite surprised at how bad the inflammation and impingement of the
nerve were.  It was much worse than the emg and nerve conduction study
showed. He theorized that some of my meds may have masked the
damage.

Before surgery, he said I could remove the bandage on Sunday and
shower with it unprotected and he wanted me to do gentle stretching
and range of motion exercises with it. After surgery, he said NOT to
unbandage it, had it immobilized, and wants to see me Monday a.m. to
unbandage it and check it out.

It is quite painful and he is concerned about pain management over the
weekend but didn't know what else to give me along with what I already
take... oxycontin 40, lortab 10, soma or flexeril (day, night
respectively).  My pain management doc's assistant told me to let the
surgeon decide what to give me post-surgically when I called earlier
this week in an attempt to NOT wind up where I am now.  My meds barely
(if at all) take the edge off.  And since they gave a massive dose of
steroids along with being wired from the after-effects of the
anesthesia, i can't sleep.

Anyway, sorry to ramble on, whining. just wanted to let you all know I
was home and all things considered, it went well.  Again, thank you
all for your prayers.

((((((((Angela)))))))  I'm amazed you managed to type such a long report!  It
must be the steroids keeping you wired.

I'm sorry to hear the situation was so bad with the nerve, but glad that,
under the circumstances, you had the surgery done.  If the pain doesn't get
any better by tomorrow though, get ahold of whoever is on call for your docs.
Something should be done - you'll never heal well if your pain stays so
high.
sending healing, no-inflammation thoughts.

(((((((((((((((((angela))))))))))))))  i'm glad the surgery went well, but
saddened by how much more damage there was than was anticipated.

boy, you must have been as confused hearing as i was reading what he said
about his being concerned with pain management and not knowing what to give
you "along with" (?) your other drugs.  what the heck could he possibly mean
by he "doesn't know"?   like, did he think you were going to take both,
oxycontin and the post-op pain med?  of course you wouldn't; you have more
sense than that.  and even if he thought you didn't, he could have
instructed you to stop the other meds and use just the post-op med, like my
surgeon automatically does.  he knows, there are other post-op pain meds he
could have prescribed that would help you, unless you have alergies to them,
like morphene or morphene derivatives or demerol.  i hope, by now, you've
already called to get better post-op pain management for yourself.

he sounds a teensy bit spacey to me.  i could be wrong, but it seems to me
that pain meds would mask the symptoms/how much the damage affects your
function, not the amount of damage itself.  the emg/nc study should have
given a reasonable indication of the amount of damage.

here's hoping your post-op recovery goes smoothly, angela, and that you heal
quickly.
