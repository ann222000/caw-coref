&gt;&gt; Feminism boosts sexual satisfaction for both men and women, a new
&gt;&gt; study suggests.

&gt;&gt; Busting stereotypes that peg feminists as men-haters, a new study
&gt;&gt; shows that having a feminist partner is linked with healthier, more
&gt;&gt; romantic heterosexual relationships.
">

60% of the NOW membership are lesbians.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The study, published online this week in the journal Sex Roles, relied
&gt;&gt; on surveys of both college students and older adults, finding that
&gt;&gt; women with egalitarian attitudes do find mates and men do find them
&gt;&gt; attractive. In fact, results reveal they are having a good time, maybe
&gt;&gt; a better time than the non-feminists.

&gt;&gt; Both men and women are prone to holding negative views of feminists,
&gt;&gt; the authors say. Along with the sexually unattractive stereotype,

It happens to be true. If it weren't true no one would even comment on it.

&gt;&gt; women also view feminism as a movement for victims, or for women who
&gt;&gt; aren't competent enough to achieve success on their own merit,
&gt;&gt; according to the Rutgers University researchers.
">

That's true

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Psychologists Laurie Rudman and Julie Phelan carried out a laboratory
&gt;&gt; survey of 242 Rutgers undergraduates and conducted an online survey of
&gt;&gt; 289 older adults who had an average age of 26 and typically had been
&gt;&gt; in their current relationship about four years.
">

So these 2 lesbians took a poll of  brain washed college kids between the
ages of 18-22 with some older ones thrown in with an average age of 26
haha
Let's take another poll 10 years from today when those 20yo males are 30 and
are older and wiser and see what they have to say.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Older adults have more life experience &quot;and thus may be more likely to
&gt;&gt; show an incompatibility between feminism and romantic relationships,&quot;
&gt;&gt; Rudman and Phelan write. While younger females likely grew up with the
&gt;&gt; attitude that &quot;women can have it all,&quot; the researchers note older
&gt;&gt; women may have come of age in the era following U.S. women's suffrage
&gt;&gt; (1919) or during the women's movement that emerged in the 1960s.

&gt;&gt; The researchers looked at people's perception of their own feminism,
&gt;&gt; their partner's feminism and whether they had positive views of
&gt;&gt; feminists and career women. Other survey measures included overall
&gt;&gt; relationship quality, agreement about gender equality, relationship
&gt;&gt; stability and sexual satisfaction.

&gt;&gt; For example, relationship quality was measured with questions such as:
&gt;&gt; How often do you and your partner laugh together? And how often do you
&gt;&gt; and your partner quarrel?
">

Why would any male college student even have a partner or gf? At his age he
should be fucking as many girls as possible  lol

For stability measures, participants

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; answered how often they considered terminating the relationship, as
&gt;&gt; well as how often they thought their romantic relationship had a good
&gt;&gt; future.
">

This is funny. Many females think they're in a &quot;relationship&quot; ( a female
term) but if you ask the guy he'll just say he was &quot;hooking up&quot; or she was
his fuck buddy  lol

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Among the findings:

&gt;&gt; College-age women who reported having feminist male partners also
&gt;&gt; reported higher quality relationships that were more stable than
&gt;&gt; couples involving non-feminist male partners.
&gt;&gt; College guys who were themselves feminists and had feminist partners
&gt;&gt; reported more equality in their relationships.
">

This is nonsense. These guys are just pussy whipped types who give the girl
everything she wants. That's a female's idea of equality.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Older women who perceived their male partners as feminists reported
&gt;&gt; greater relationship health and sexual satisfaction.
">

Disgusting. Old females should not be having or thinking of sex. As a doctor
I've seen many over 40 yo females and I can tell you it ain't pretty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Older men with feminist partners said they had more stable
&gt;&gt; relationships and greater sexual satisfaction.
">

Yes, that's believable   lol  Mr. Hefner, do you prefer the Playmate of the
Month or Betty Friedan?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Overall, feminism and romance do go hand in hand, the scientists say.

&gt;&gt; While they aren't sure how feminism works to enhance relationship
&gt;&gt; health, the researchers have some ideas. Feminist men might be more
&gt;&gt; supportive of their female partner's ambitions than are
&gt;&gt; traditionalists. Men with feminist partners may enjoy the extra
&gt;&gt; breadwinner to share the economic burden of maintaining a household.

&gt; LOL! Beam me up Scotty

&gt; heavy spin at work.

&gt;   [What] feminism pretends to be is nothing more than a

I'm against equality, it is a silly abstract idea which is out of touch with
Natural Law. Sure, we want to have some sort of fairness if only to placate

&gt;   Feminism in the Men's Movement
&gt;   by Henry Salivator
&gt;   Thought Crime Research Institute, source at:

&gt; &lt; http://www.users.bigpond.com/sarcasmo/sexpolitics/personifestopart1.h... &gt;

&gt; Remember, masculism is the belief that men deserve equal
&gt; rights too.  Therefore, everywhere the word &quot;feminist&quot; appeared
&gt; in that article, one could substitute &quot;masculist&quot;.  Odd tho' that
&gt; no one has, eh?

&gt;   [A] movement called Feminism isn't about equal rights
&gt;   between men and women anymore than a movement called
&gt;   Masculism would be.

&gt;   Raj Kumar Singh
&gt; http://www.backlash.com/content/gender/votemale/raj.html

&gt; Color me distrustful of anyone who considers &quot;egalitarian&quot;
&gt; to be feminist until the feminists (as Rutgers researchers
&gt; define them) march on Washington in the millions to demand
&gt; that women be subject to military conscription just as men are.

&gt; The media spin being placed on that Rutgers study is a
&gt; variation of this tired, old feminist bit of trickery:

&gt;   Trick:  You can't criticize Feminism because no statement
&gt;           you make is true of _all_ Feminists.

&gt;   This trick tries to block discussion by making it impossible
&gt;   to express your thought. The writer simply specifies that by
&gt;   &quot;Feminism&quot;, he means mainstream Feminism, misandry.
&gt;   Another approach is to qualify the term: &quot;Gender Feminism&quot;,
&gt;   &quot;Biofeminism&quot;, or &quot;Radical Feminism&quot;. And if Feminism
&gt;   really was so random, by the same token you wouldn't
&gt;   be able to say anything positive about it.

&gt;   From the post &quot;FAQ: Feminist myths and tricks
&gt;   frequently used to disrupt discussion&quot;.

&gt;   The entire FAQ can be found at:

&gt; http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=stever.FADC.0 ... @cygnus.ieu.comtra.org

&gt; I suspect that had that &quot;study&quot; been done in the Bad Old Days (tm),
&gt; say the 1950s, as many or more of the women would have put
&gt; themselves in the &quot;more fun&quot; category and self-labeled their
&gt; relationships with men &quot;egalitarian&quot;.  (Duh.)

&gt; Let me know when there's something peer-reviewed
&gt; published in a reputable journal and the data those
&gt; researchers used is made available.  I remember
&gt; feminist Arlie Hochschild's hoax and how that
&gt; furthered feminist propaganda efforts.

&gt; --
&gt;   If feminists are as egalitarian as Rutgers researchers claim,
&gt;   feminists would be picketing these bastions of campus sexism:

&gt;   They aren't picketing.

is that females don't even respect the honest fair man but consider him a

&quot; The singular of 'anecdote' is NOT 'citation'. &quot;

That Feminism has led to women reproducing at far lower levels,
such that they, themselves, find needs for extraordinary assistance
with reproducing at older ages, is simply a matter of fact.

No rebuttal even attempted ? Excellent, Rob's accurate point stands.

Trick:  You're a misogynist!

Misogyny has a clear, precise meaning: Hatred of women _as a
class_. Those who use the term irresponsibly are both unfairly
pretending there's much more misogyny than there really is and
are demonizing people. If someone calls you a misogynist just
because you speak harshly to an individual woman or you don't
support special privileges for women, they owe you a huge
apology. (But good luck getting it)

I think that people - are people - are people and we all want to be
treated equally, regardless of age, gender and race.

Of course there are people that will take advantage of others, be they
male or female but do not blame all the males when your spouse is
abusive and controlling, or blame all of the females when you spouse
is same.

Its not because of their gender, its because of who they are and their
personality.

Ah, so femminists then have no tollerence for anyone who does not
agree with their position/point of view. Just as I have observed.
Well, at least you are honest about it.

So from this we can also conclude, then, that femminists are not
interested in discussing issues of equality with various take-holders
and groups - they are interested only in superiority (as the sinlge
permissable point of view and voice allowed).

Not to worry, the real world wont miss you either.

And don't answer &quot;They must be, or their views would be the same as mine.&quot;
A group of 242 may be fairly small, but I would believe the average result
with 242 against one man whose samples are always one person.
A &quot;wilderness of single instances&quot; cannot produce a scientific, general
result.

Just as I cannot say that my doctor, who handed me a few toy farm animals
from his jar of rewards for 4-year-olds and told me to offer them to senior
citizens as competition prizes, is like that because he is married and his
wife never lets him out of her sight.  More likely, it is the other way
around; such a childish man needs to be under constant supervision for his
own safety.

A fact which is not in dispute anymore. Different bodies, different

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Feminism boosts sexual satisfaction for both men and women, a new
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; study suggests.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Suggests&quot;.  Not proves.  Correlation is not causation.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Busting stereotypes that peg feminists as men-haters, a new study
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shows that having a feminist partner is linked with healthier, more
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; romantic heterosexual relationships.

&gt;&gt; &gt; How does that bust the stereotype that feminists are man-haters?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Isn't the stereotypical patriarch misogynist a father and husband?

&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, while feminists are not attractive to men

&gt; Many men insist - INSIST - that feminists are extremely attractive to
&gt; them and that they wouldn't have it any other way.  Who was that
&gt; engineer dude who was in this ng a few months ago?

&gt; I think that's one of the horrifying things about feminism is that
&gt; it's turned men into self-enabling liars.

&gt; There are a lot of horrors in Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, but maybe the most
&gt; pervasive is when Winston Smith really does start to &quot;see&quot; that two
&gt; plus two equal five.  There's O'Brien holding out an oustretched hand
&gt; with fingers spread and thumb hidden -- but Winston really really does
&gt; begin to see FIVE fingers.

&gt; That's more horrifying than any of the physical torture that he went
&gt; through to arrive at that viewpoint.  The fact that Winston REALLY
&gt; sees five fingers and is not just saying &quot;five&quot; to avoid more torture.
">

Yes, but that was after he was tortured, drugged and brainwashed. He was in
a weak condition and has lost a lot of weight and even his teeth. What you
see today is from social conditioning over a period of time but that can
very easily be reversed since the feminist &quot;philosophy&quot; is against Nature.
People, and especially females are like cattle and will go along with the
herd. Once feminism gets the reputation of being unfashionable, stupid or
uncool, no female will want to be associated with any of it. All we have to
do to start a stampede is get a few female cattle and the rest of the herd
will go along :o) Even the word &quot;feminism&quot; will become taboo just as the
word nigger is today.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A lot of atrocities are committed against men in the name of feminism
&gt; or of &quot;empowering women&quot; -- but maybe the fact that so many men come
&gt; to appreciate them is the most horrifying of all.

&gt;&gt; I have seen
&gt;&gt; them take more masculine approaches to dating and therefore tend to land
&gt;&gt; men more quickly than many passive women in the states.

You're not very experienced or you'd know that it has always been females

&gt;&gt; If anyone &quot;loves&quot; men, it's feminists.  Without men, there's nobody for
&gt;&gt; them to blame all the world's problems on (besides themselves and we all
&gt;&gt; know they won't do that! :-) and in addition most are beneficiaries of
&gt;&gt; patriarchal men giving them the luxury to indulge in such nonsense in
&gt;&gt; the first place.

&gt; Nonsense, hell!  Look at our next president!  Receiving the White
&gt; House as a gift isn't trivial.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The study, published online this week in the journal Sex Roles,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; relied
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on surveys of both college students and older adults, finding that
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; women with egalitarian attitudes do find mates and men do find them
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attractive. In fact, results reveal they are having a good time,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a better time than the non-feminists.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The key here is &quot;egalitarian attitudes&quot;.  Feminists today are not
&gt;&gt; &gt; about egalitarian attitudes anymore.

&gt;&gt; Victim-anti-male feminism has been dominant since the late 70's.  Even
&gt;&gt; before then there were usually more &quot;bad feminists&quot; in charge of things
&gt;&gt; and making the decisions with a few nice feminists providing cover.  But
&gt;&gt; after they sensed that their legal agenda was pretty solid they
&gt;&gt; abandoned the silly pretense of egalitarianism.

&gt;&gt; &gt; In modern society saying &quot;Do you
&gt;&gt; &gt; think women should have equal rights as men?&quot; and saying &quot;Are you
&gt;&gt; &gt; feminist?&quot;  are NOT the same question.

&gt; It IS the same question.

&gt;&gt; I find that even with most leftists I know, they don't believe feminists
&gt;&gt; are for equality either.  But that said, sadly, many MRA even now
&gt;&gt; believe in &quot;equal rights for women&quot; even as women clearly require
&gt;&gt; special protections and privileges that are not available to men or most
&gt;&gt; men.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Both men and women are prone to holding negative views of feminists,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the authors say. Along with the sexually unattractive stereotype,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; women also view feminism as a movement for victims, or for women who
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; aren't competent enough to achieve success on their own merit,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; according to the Rutgers University researchers.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I find the negative views the article chooses to present interesting.
&gt;&gt; &gt; In particular I note the absence of the view of feminists as being
&gt;&gt; &gt; sexists themselves and wanting special entitlements.  The only
&gt;&gt; &gt; negative views the article presents are either patently stupid -
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;sexually unattractive&quot; - or are actually pro-feminsim in disguise -
&gt;&gt; &gt; saying that women are too strong and too confident to consider
&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves feminists.  No resonable anti-feminist attitude is even
&gt;&gt; &gt; covered.

&gt;&gt; Of course, it's because they don't want to give that view ammunition or
&gt;&gt; even coverage.

&gt;&gt; What they ARE afraid of is that many normal women themselves are afraid
&gt;&gt; of being perceived as a hairy legged feminists and even worse, expected
&gt;&gt; to foot their own bill.

&gt;&gt; Feminism is a movement that sold itself successfully to normal women by
&gt;&gt; saying that they would be able to &quot;double dip&quot; and get wealthy men to
&gt;&gt; pay the bills while they could have well paying hobby jobs.  That isn't
&gt;&gt; panning out and they're concerned that angry women are going to get the
&gt;&gt; torches and pitchforks and come for them.  Which they should.

&gt; I really wish that I lived in your world.

&gt; You see feminism dying.

&gt; I see a Holocaust on the horizon.  The science behind it is in place.
&gt; Remember, the Y chromosome is said to be some sort of genetically
&gt; defective organism which is going to die out in a matter of time
&gt; anyway.

&gt; Given that males (it isn't believed) aren't really human and (it is
&gt; believed) aren't good for anything, what harm in speeding up the
&gt; process by eradicating them?.  It can start by encouraging females to
&gt; abort male children and thereby start to eradicate the virus.

&gt; The eradication of men and boys is is a platform that women (and many
&gt; men) can get behind, regardless of whatever else divides them.

&gt; You see this in terms of left and right, but many conservatives feel
&gt; the same way.

&gt; http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire082801.shtml

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Psychologists Laurie Rudman and Julie Phelan carried out a laboratory
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; survey of 242 Rutgers undergraduates and conducted an online survey
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 289 older adults who had an average age of 26 and typically had been
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in their current relationship about four years.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So it is an online survey which means it is self selected.  Not a good
&gt;&gt; &gt; sign for it being valid.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Older adults have more life experience &quot;and thus may be more likely
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; show an incompatibility between feminism and romantic relationships,&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rudman and Phelan write. While younger females likely grew up with
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attitude that &quot;women can have it all,&quot; the researchers note older
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; women may have come of age in the era following U.S. women's suffrage
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (1919) or during the women's movement that emerged in the 1960s.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The researchers looked at people's perception of their own feminism,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their partner's feminism and whether they had positive views of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; feminists and career women. Other survey measures included overall
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship quality, agreement about gender equality, relationship
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; stability and sexual satisfaction.

&gt;&gt; &gt; What I would like to know is how many people were forced into being
&gt;&gt; &gt; identified by the survey as feminists by defining feminism as being
&gt;&gt; &gt; for equal rights.  I believe this could account for what I mentioend
&gt;&gt; &gt; above -- the idea of feminism not actually being about equality being
&gt;&gt; &gt; completely missing from the objections to feminism.

&gt;&gt; Sounds like a &quot;cosmo quiz&quot;.   :-)

&gt;&gt; The very notion of &quot;women having it all&quot; is a sexist one and highly
&gt;&gt; unrealistic.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, relationship quality was measured with questions such
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; as:
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; How often do you and your partner laugh together? And how often do
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and your partner quarrel? For stability measures, participants
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; answered how often they considered terminating the relationship, as
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; well as how often they thought their romantic relationship had a good
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; future.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Among the findings:

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; College-age women who reported having feminist male partners also
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reported higher quality relationships that were more stable than
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; couples involving non-feminist male partners.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; College guys who were themselves feminists and had feminist partners
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reported more equality in their relationships.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Older women who perceived their male partners as feminists reported
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; greater relationship health and sexual satisfaction.

When you say that this group is this specific way, and this group is
this specific way - you are pigeon holing people and not giving them
the respect they are due.

Anywho... I am a grown up with a substantial amount of responsibility
because the man I married preferred to be drunk 24-7, rather than help
his wife take care of the bills, the children and live a good life.

Instead, I had to bear rants, abuse and cruelity and sure, say I was
at fault but our children was not.

So would you have me now believe that all men are this way?  Because
one is - all are?

I have seen many very sweet, kind and gentle men - who are great
husbands and fathers and friends. It is wrong to believe if one is
blue all are blue, or one is green all a green.

We all live very different lives and are molded by same.  Our opinions
are different as are our thoughts, goals and dreams.

Yup, the rest of us appreciate that meaningful classification is the
source of all knowledge. Even natural, purposeless processes use it,
'discriminate, select and replicate' is the evolutionary algorithm,
after all. ChewsCrayons wants to deny this because otherwise she is
forced to be more specific about what she means by the relationship
between provable and consistent sex differences (in e.g. brain, body,
hormones and emotions) and 'respect' and how and where these two
concepts interact.

Quite. When one acknowledges that the two sexes are different, one
must therefore also acknowledge that each sex provides societal
goods in differing amounts, and ways. That means that total equality
cannot be attained.

You feel that I am incorrect in my assumtion that all men and all
women are different, that men do not all act the same and all women do
not act the same.

So, in this - you are saying that all men / or / all women hold the
same values, are pursuing the same goals and hold the same values?
That since this man was behaving this way, all men behave that way and
since this woman behaved this way, all women behave that way also?

Or is it thought?  Are you saying that all men love to watch sports on
tv, and all women love to shop?

I am not really feeling your point here - would you like to give a few
examples to clarify?

How do feminists have more fun actually?  And what, in your opinion
defines a feminist? It is a woman that feels she should have the right
to vote?  The right to work outside the home and earn an equal wage
for equal work or it is the woman that feels 'all' people whether male
or female should have the same opportunities, the same education, and
basically be treated as equals?

I am not a feminist, however I do feel that regardless of gender, men
and women should be held equal in all things, and this is in respect
to divorce and child custody.  (since this is a divorce newsgroup).  I
do not feel that gender automatically makes anyone better at anything,
including being a parent.

Try looking in any magazine shops, and comparing the publications
for men, with the ones for women. You will find that the ones for men
concern politics, policy, technology, history and economics. Matters
of fact, learning, and relatively immune to empty &quot; opinion &quot;. The
ones
for women are vapid, empty, idiotic, narcissistic, and materialistic
in
the nature of their publications and audiences.

http://www.fathers.bc.ca/feminist_myths.htm

Feminist myths and tricks frequently used to disrupt discussion

Trick: &quot;Feminist&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; are interchangeable terms. The opposite
of &quot;Feminists&quot; is &quot;men&quot;. Feminist interests and women's interests are
interchangeable terms.

False and absurd. Our opinion of all women could never be so low.

Trick: I'm a male and I agree with the Feminists that [particular
Feminist
lie]

Not impressed. You're far from the first man to sell out their own.
You
may believe that as what you call a &quot;male&quot; you're in the perfect
position to backstab men's rights, but we've heard it all before.

Then, provide proof that YOU have opposed biased family courts in
awarding women more rights than men.

Its a fact that 79.6% of custodial *mothers* get a Child Support
award, while only 29.9% of custodial fathers do. Feel free to prove
your actions opposing this sexist violation of children raised by
custodial fathers to the Support that the Law says that they have a
right to.

Also, append copies of your letters opposing Title IX ( Since its

men's ), and VAWA.

If ChewsCrayons wants a discussion on feminism (yes, its not called
equalism for good reason) she should start a new thread in an
appropriate (set of) newsgroup(s). If she chooses soc.men and lurks
for a bit she'll realise that the exchanges are rather more direct
than she's used to and so be prepared for your well-known reposts.
Currently she seems to think 'we men' have muscled into a divorce
newsgroup and probably doesn't realise either where this discussion
started or that there are people like Avenger who enjoy stirring
things up with dubious cross-postings.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although your phrase 'you men' suggests that you don't really believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you say.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, you men was referring to the people using the cartoon to
&gt; &gt; &gt; validate what they were trying to say and infact he did point to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; cartoon as some type of viable truth.

&gt; &gt; And, he was right about that. Whether or not that bunches your
&gt; &gt; panties, affects that truth not one whit.

Indeed. Accurate commentary can come from many sources, and satire
works by being accurate in what it is satirizing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How do feminists have more fun actually?  And what, in your opinion
&gt; &gt; &gt; defines a feminist? It is a woman that feels she should have the right
&gt; &gt; &gt; to vote?
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; The right to work outside the home and earn an equal wage
&gt; &gt; &gt; for equal work or it is the woman that feels 'all' people whether male
&gt; &gt; &gt; or female should have the same opportunities, the same education, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; basically be treated as equals?

&gt; &gt; Feminists believe in NONE of those things. Humanists do believe in
&gt; &gt; those things, but Humanists also believe that MEN are People, too,
&gt; &gt; and have an EQUAL claim to equal rights.

What can I say, I have a good knowledge base on this topic, and I
take foolish whiny &quot; No, its not &quot; replies not at all sympathetically.

&quot; Everybody has opinions: I have them, you have them. And we are

entitled to his or her opinion. Well, that's horsepuckey, of course.
We are not entitled to our opinions; we are entitled to our informed

Try looking in any magazine shops, and comparing the publications
for men, with the ones for women. You will find that the ones for men
concern politics, policy, technology, history and economics.

dude.. does ANY of your posts have any actual intellect or depth to

or are you just basically sounding off here ... on a continual rant
against women in general.

I keep hoping for something of substance, a shred of .... something we
both can 'discuss' but I see that is more of a scream-fest, hissy-fit
for you...

so, I know enough to 'not feed the trolls' and am by passing your
posts from now on.

You know, what is sad is, if you had given facts, real facts with
honest to goodness citations from say journals or respected
publications - and talked on the subject with some air of authority,
lending some dignity - I would of listened intently to see your side
of the equation.

In the end, men and women are unique because of their personalities -
and your perception of women is formed by your own personal
charasteristics, personality and life experiences.

In this, you have formed a hypotheses, a type of expectation for each
action or event - relating to women.  But your perception is and can
be peppered with your own beliefs, motives or incentives.  And this is
very clearly seen in your posts.

But what is interesting is, that you feel all men feel the same as
you... I sincerely hope not.

Trick: &quot;Feminist&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; are interchangeable terms. The
opposite of &quot;Feminists&quot; is &quot;men&quot;. Feminist interests and women's
interests are interchangeable terms.

False and absurd. Our opinion of all women could never be so low.

Trick: I'm a male and I agree with the Feminists that [particular
Feminist lie]
