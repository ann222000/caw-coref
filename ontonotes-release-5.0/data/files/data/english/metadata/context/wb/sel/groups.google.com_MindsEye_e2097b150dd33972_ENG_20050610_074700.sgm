Kari, I think that tolerance means refraining from agressions against other people. It doesn´t mean approval or complicity. Since nobody appointed me as judge of other people, I can´t act as executioner, either. If some restrictions must be applied to the liberty of other people, let it be done by legal and fair process, with due care. There´s always the possibility of being wrong, and punishing the inocent. There´s also a big probability of unfairness, of punishing a few and letting a lot of others, many of which are maybe as guilty as the punished ones or even more guilty, go unmolested. I insist in that often there´s a very serious social problem underlying antisocial conduct, and punishment is at best a partial solution, at worst no solution at all.

Ok, let's examine this. I am going to pick a group who are
intrinsically related to the tolerance discussion: LGBT. (And I'll
say upfront that yes, I am Catholic, and yes, some of my best friends
are gay / lesbian. Must admit, I don't know anyone who is bi / trans
to my knowledge.) I'm not picking on anyone; just using an example.

Tolerance -- what does it mean for LGBT?

~ Attempt protections against violence?
~ Entrance to the military?
~ non-discrimination on the job?
~ Right to civil unions?
~ Right to marriage?
~ Right to partners' benefits?

I agree with all but the last two. Am I intolerant?

Kari's list of issue's we can be either tolerant or intollerant about
made me think of something. She said that the last three are the only
two she disagrees with. Funny thing is the last two on the list are
the last two to be fought over in the legal system. 20 years ago the
greatest majority of people would have been intollerant against any of
those issue's. Makes me wonder what we're going to allow in twenty
more years and call it tollerance.

Heh tolerance is easy. Look at what the word means.

If you tolorate some body, you may or may not like them, but you
certianly do not agree with them on certian issuses.

To tolorate something, means right from the start that you do not like
it. yet in accepting that you do not like, it you are saying that the
idea is still viable, just not for me.

So tolorance should be seen for what it is, to tolorate, rather than
what the word seems to be becoming, open minded.

Lee

Using your example, Kari.......Rodrigo disagrees with your statement, but he is not seeking to stifle your opinion or, worse yet, attempting to by direct or indirect action. He disagrees, but he is &quot;putting up&quot; with it........he is mentally &quot;allowing it to be&quot;. THAT is toleration.

On the other hand, Rodrigo, neither is Kari being intolerant for holding her personal views on LGBT.......she is merely stating her opinion. If she took an active role in attempting to stifle Gays, THEN she could be accused of intolerance.

TOLERATION a : sympathy or indulgence for beliefs or practices differing from or conflicting with one's own b : the act of allowing something

You are right, Rodrigo, but you don't go far enough. Tolerance doesn't mean &quot;approval or complicity&quot;, it specifically MUST contain the aspect of DISAGREEMENT. ie..It must contain 2 things........restraint of action AND disagreement.

I think the issue comes to light on matters which are important, and
then is used to wield power over matters which are not.

People should not be discriminated against in any way because of their
religion, ethnic background, or sexual preference, even if you disagree
with or dislike said religion, preference, ethnicity. This is a
tolerance issue which is important.

Schools should NOT be forced to remove Christmas decorations because it
offended someone. This is not tolerance, this is oppression. Someone
mentioned earlier they believed this to be an establishment clause
issue. I disagree. Christmas is a secularized holiday with a purely
commercial front that is an American tradition. Allowing Christmas
trees does not in any way make a law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. &quot;Tolerance&quot; has
been the basis for many &quot;freedom from offense&quot; actions that do nothing
to make our society better. The establishment clause has been used to
seek out freedom FROM religion. The two combined have given us Public
Offices where Christmas and Hannukah are outlawed, and Kwaanza is
welcome.

It may be legal, it may have some strict interprative basis in law, but
it's not right.

(Pottsie)

The establishment clause for those who are not familiar with the US Constitution comes from the 1st Amendment:

&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion ...&quot;

The problem comes in where people think that celebrating Christmas in schools, or in City Hall is the government attempting to &quot;establish&quot; a state religion. BS, as far as I'm concerned. When my ability to practice my religion anywhere (as long as I am not trying to force my beliefs on someone else) is being restricted because of a misinterpretation of the 1st amendment, that is, in actuality, the government establishing a &quot;Religion of Atheism&quot;, and IMHO is in itself a violation of the 1st Amendment.

The 1st Amendment is a &quot;Hand's off Religion&quot; amendment. The government should have, IMHO, no connection whatsoever with religion one way or another.....except to intervene when one group tries to impose its beliefs upon another.

Methinks I smell the fragrant aroma of sarcasm... ;)

Lee,
If the personal religion of the the members of a government make the
government biased, can you explain to me how we could have a government
which is not biased? Whether you practice theism, agnosticism, or
atheism, you are going to have a bias inherent to that belief set. It
is impossible for a government without bias to exist, unless of course
we turn over power to the machines. The founders of the US were all
very religious, but recognized the dangers inherent in having a true
theocracy, as evidenced by the history of both the Catholic and
Anglican Churches's influence on the governments of Western Europe.
This is why the constitution of the US guarantees both freedom to
practice any form of religion, and forbids legislating in favor of a
specific religion. It does not mean that religion has no place in the
democratic process. The voters who are religious will certainly vote in
line with their religious doctrine and morality, so even if you forbid
politicians from using the word God in some abominable
misinterpretation of the seperation clause, you would still not
eliminate the influence of religion on government. Considering the UK
has its share of religious politicians, I don't think there is real
backing for this bit of humor, except to elicit a giggle, which it did.

hey Chris yeah the stecnh of sarcasm is in the air. My point though is
valid. Obviously we cannot say anybody of any faith is not alowed to
be a politician, other wise we have a goverment of Atheists(who to my
mind is just another faith based idea). No of course we can have
religious politicitans and even religious World leaders. When though
we see religious ideas creeping into goverment polocies then we're
heading for trouble. Because obviously what laws suit one fiath is
going to be tothe detriment of another.

Yes over here in Britian, our glorious leader is also well known for
his Christian faith, and long myay he be allowed to continue in that,
but the moment I see a change to Christian based ideas in goverment,
then I shall be out on the streets protesting.

Oh, I agree 100%. When politicians start making laws based on their
religious beliefs, you get drivel like this:

&quot;When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and
equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle
them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with CERTAIN [inherent
and] inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are
instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive
of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it,
and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.&quot;

I mean really, who would want that kind of drek as the basis of a
government?

:) Yeah, I do know what you mean. However, the point remains valid.
Religious beliefs are an integral part of the democratic process, as
the whole point of democracy is that the individuals vote their
conscience, and the majority of the individuals set the law for the
entire society. Religious reasons have been used to create bad law, or
have prevented the creation of good law, but it has also been the basis
for much of our civil protections. Religious beliefs simply cannot be
removed from the political process.

I agree, to some extent, with the need for the most basic concepts of
religious morals being an influence on society's laws. Since most
people are weak--and thus predisposed toward hurting each other--they
need laws (which carry penalties in this life if they are not obeyed),
or they need religious doctrine (which if not followed carry penalties
in the next life), or they need the concept of a loving &quot;Heavenly
Father&quot; to invoke guilt for their misdeeds. They are not naturally
pre-disposed toward higher ethics.

Nietzsche hoped for the Ubermensch. Something above all this which is,
though he wouldn't put it in such terms, the next step in Darwinist
evolution. Sadly, if religion gets its way we won't ever crawl out of
the ocean and onto the land or come down out of the trees.
Metaphorically speaking...

Morality is legislated all the time, and has been since government
began. People enact laws based on their moral understanding of right
and wrong. That understanding is often based on religious belief,
therefore my statement that it cannot be removed, as long as religious
people participate. I don't see any problem with Sikhs in Government,
anymore than Christians in government. I do disagree however, with a
Christian BASED government, or a Sikh BASED government. Then it truly
does become a theocracy.

Waaahaa we agree on somthing, yeah I don't mind religious people in
goverment as long we don't have their religous beliefs behind policy
making descions.

As to the moral understanding, I disagree that we get this from our
religous belifes. Granted we get some, but a sense of right and wrong
in short your morals/ethics does not come with relgious convictions.
In fact as we all know some religous convictions are down right wrong,
umm moraly that is.

Example from todays Sun newspaper:

'African boys are being smuggled into Britian and killed as human
sacrifices, says a Scoland Yard report. Police belive they are bought
for as little as £10 and offered as sacrifces in rituals among
fundamentalist Christian sects....'

Also:

'Evil islamic cleric Omar Bakri has made an internet speech calling on
followers to murder non-Muslims....'

Again, I'll say of course laws are made based on peoples moral
understanding of right and wrong, this right and correct, however when
this 'understanding' involves a religious aspect then we cannot allow
politicians of one faith to make laws for all of the people.

Cheers,

Lee.

I think that government and religion should be ketp apart, precisely because
I do care about religion. Religion and morals mean deep personal comittment
or they mean nothing. The people who act in politics, or in any other field,
however, do it from their religious and philosophical foundations. But they
do it from their INTERPRETATIONS of those beliefs. That´s why there are so
many differencies between Muslim countries, Christian countires, etc.
