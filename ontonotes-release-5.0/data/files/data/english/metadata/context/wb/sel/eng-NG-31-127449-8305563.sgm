I stumbleuponed this page, which I felt might be of interest to
AFCAns in the struggle agaonst ignorance:

http://www.mcrosolv.demon.co.uk/getwrong.html

The author goes through a list of commonly-held &quot;facts&quot; and discusses
how each is wrong.

The author goes on to describe a retarding force that acts so as to
oppose the motion of a body through a fluid, with the net result of
converting kinetic energy into thermal energy...how is this not a
form of friction?  It is no more bogus than &quot;tidal friction&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The author goes on to say that this is in fact the case at the north
pole.  It is less so at lower lattitudes, but still a good first
stab at answering the question &quot;How do we know that the Earth rotates?&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

When something is this arbitrary, you can't really say that 7 is the
&quot;wrong&quot; answer, any more than you can say that it is the &quot;right&quot;
answer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Anyone who says something like &quot;But Earth's rotation is another source
of potential energy&quot; is in no position to point fingers at others who
call supersonic fluid drag a form of friction.

Most things do.  That is what makes the one exception so special.

He explains that the heating is from compression, rather than
friction.

Wouldn't there be at least 2 exceptions.  Certain plastics shrink when

They get thicker when you heat them, and the process is not reversible.
This is not thermal expansion/contraction, but a chemical change in the
material.

I'll bet if you take a fully shrunk Shrinky Dink, then carefully measure
its dimensions as you bring it from, say, 0C to 50C, you would find that
the plastic does in fact expand.

Ice, shirley.  And it's in a *class* of exceptions.  The polar structure
of DHMO molecules causes the liquid to expand as it turns solid.  Any
substance with a similar attribute would crystallize in a similar fashion.

I think the author was refering to water.  Not only does water expand
upon freezing (which I would argue is not thermal expansion, since solid
and liquid water are two different materials just as diamond and graphite
are two different materials), water actually expands *just before*
freezing. It reaches maximum density at 4 deg C, then *expands* as it
cools.  This has all sorts of important effects on lakes and oceans,
and supposedly prevents them from freezing completely.

I'm sure that the author was referring to water.  I was referring to
Paul Ciszek's use of the phrase &quot;the one exception&quot;.

And there are others.
