Let me say right off that I'm not a collector, that I have a whole
bunch of stamps that I inherited, and that I'm selling them off on
eBay.  I'm retired, I like selling on eBay, I like researching things,
and I don't mind piddling around with this for a return of about 3
cents an hour.

I have done some homework, I do have a copy of Scott's, and I do know
some of the terms.  Certain things, though, I find I can't learn by
research (or I don't know how to research properly).

I randomly selected a few stamps and put them up at
http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f244/cooper213/question.jpg

These are all unused, uncanceled, unhinged stamps.  None of them show
any signs of glue on the back.  The backs are flat-looking.

How does this happen?  If the stamps have never been used, what
happened to the glue?  How is this condition described?

The reason that I ask is that I have run some stamp auctions and the
"Questions from Sellers" have always been about the glue condition or
the hinging.  I know what to look for on the hinge question, but I
don't know how to answer the glue questions other than there is, or is
not, glue indication.

P.S.  Most of what I'll be working with are US stamps pre-1940.  I'm
setting aside the foreign, the recent, and the
stamps-still-attached-envelopes and dealing the with US pre-1940
first.  I've put up for auction a few other things, but only because
they are bit unique and easy to separate out.

The Glue is called Gum, that being said collectors sometimes spot a
stamp that went through the mail and missed getting canceled. They are
then soaked off the piece and appear to have never been used. a Second
reason for no gum, not canceled could be that the stamps were stuck down
on something (such as an album)because the previous owner stored them in
an area that was too humid and caused the gum to become sticky and
adhere. The third reason could be that the gum in itself can damage the
paper the stamp is made from over a long period of time, so some
collectors choose to soak the stamp early on to remove the gum and ward
off that type of damage.
