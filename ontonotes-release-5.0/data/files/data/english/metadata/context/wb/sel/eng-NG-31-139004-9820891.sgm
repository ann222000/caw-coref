*Keralite** set to be India's first space tourist*
15 Mar 2007, 0127 hrs IST,Ananthakrishnan G,TNN

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Santosh George Kulangara, a travel freak from a Kerala
village will have the rare honour of being perhaps the first Indian tourist
in space.

Global space tour operator Virgin Galactic just confirmed his reservation
for the space flight sometime in 2008.

&quot;I'm thrilled. It will be a historic moment. Space is the last destination
known to man and I'm excited to be able to see it,&quot; Kulangara told TOI over
the phone from his home in Marangattupalli in Kottayam district.

According to the letter from Virgin Galactic president Will Whitehorn,
Kulangara has been allotted voyager reservation number 38.

The confirmation comes on a payment of $20,000. But that's only part of it.
The total expense for the trip is $2, 00,000, roughly Rs 90 lakh.

&quot;Some weeks ago, I got the welcome pack introducing me to the various
aspects of the tour,&quot; a visibly excited Kulangara said.

&quot;I will be travelling with five other tourists and two navigators. The tour
operator has called a meeting in Paris in May this year, where I will be
able to meet my fellow passengers,&quot; he said.

There will be no real landing in space, but we will be able to experience
zero gravity and the re-entry of the spacecraft into the earth's atmosphere.
The sojourn in space will last only 2-3 hours,&quot; Kulangara explained.

The take off will be from the US. Virgin's craft for the sub-orbital flight
is being put to shape at Rutan's base in Mojave, California.

&quot;What I'm told is that it will be ready by the end of 2007. Then there will
be a week-long training programme. The actual journey will take place
sometime in mid-2008.&quot;

Kulangara confessed that he had not broken the news even to his two
children. &quot;Only my wife and a few friends know about this,&quot; Kulangara said
adding that his wife Soncy was stunned by the news.

&quot;It's difficult to believe that an Indian can achieve such things,&quot; he said.

&quot;My message to the younger generation is that if you have a dream, it is
achievable,&quot; said Kulangara who hosts a popular travel show 'Sancharam' on
local TV.

&quot;People never believed when I said I had travelled 50 countries. But this
proves, we can also do it.&quot;

&quot;The tour operator has agreed to allow me to shoot the trip so that I can
pass it on to the rest of the world,&quot; he said.

Kulangara is also a successful entrepreneur running one of the country's
largest educational publishing houses.

*Santhosh George Kulangara Experienced Zero Gravity
*
Florida : Santhosh George Kulangara, the first Indian space tourist
designate, has successfully completed the 'zero gravity' training. It was in
the special aircraft named G Force One which took off from Kennedy Space
Centre in Florida, USA that he got the training. The special training for
zero gravity state was conducted at the fag end of the three-day-long
training programme meant for the space tourists. The zero gravity training
that started at one o' clock IST on August 12, lasted for about four hours.
The travellers on board were in zero gravity state for about one hour,
during the training.
Besides Santhosh George Kulangara from India, two British and ten Americans
had undergone the training during this time. There were also 12 other
members inside the training vehicle, including trainers, technical experts
and medical team. The G Force aircraft was taken to a height of 40,000 feet
above the ground level and was brought down quickly to create zero gravity.
During this time, the travellers including Santhosh George glided along
inside the hall-like area in the aircraft. During these four hours the G
Force aircraft went up several times and came down vertically. After each
training flight, the medical team examined the travellers. Santhosh George
was found ok in the medical examination.
Santhosh George said it was an exciting experience to glide inside the
G-Force vehicle with the co-travellers. He has captured all these training
sessions in his camera as well.
The training programme for the space tourists was organised by the Zero
Gravity Corporation in association with Virgin Galactic. The same facilities
used for training the NASA astronauts were used for training the space
tourists.
The G Force vehicle took off from the same Space Port from where the
Endeavour Space Shuttle had been launched to the International Space Station
with seven astronauts recently. It was informed earlier that the zero
gravity training might be postponed if the Endeavour launching faced any
delay. Santhosh George said that he had seen the preparations for the
re-entry of Endeavour there.
