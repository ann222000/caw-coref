I never said that the Strat man did not invest in a theater. All I
said was that from his own financial-legal records there is no proof that he
did.

Like all good and experienced genealogists, I would never assume that
just because I see the name &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; on a London-based document,
that this must be the particular William Shakespeare from Stratford-on-Avon.
Buckeye Pete employes much higher standards of proof than Stratfordians..or for
that matter Diana Price and Nina Green...who like the Stratfordians assume for
the sake of convenience and their various theories that there was only one
William Shakespeare in London from 1590 through the early 1600s.

I seriously doubt that...especially since Malone had discovered a
document proving continuous residency in Southwark of someone named William
Shakespeare from about 1596 to 1608. This does not jive with the Stratford man
living with the Mountjoys and at St. Helen's parish etc. inside the walls of
London. There were other William Shakespeares, even in the region around
Stratford town, one a small money lender with the name also born in 1564 but
who lived into the 1620s. Just as there was this John Hemynge, an intimate
friends of the Hathaway family who became the Stratford town crier in 1592 and
was close to the Stratford man. He is not to be confused with John Hemmings
the actor.
In any case, something is very murky and strange with these theater shares.
Malone never got around to publishing the aforesaid document but his
professional standards were high and he was the one that exposed the Ireland
forgeries. It is also not clear that the Wiliam Shakespeare in the Clayton
loan document of 1592 is the guy from Stratford and so on. Unless
Stratford-on-Avon or some other evidence is present in the documentation that
points to him specifically, we cannot be 100 percent certain. If shares were
part of his own personal records or estate, then that would be different. But
instead zippo.

But then what really happened here? Well, I do not totally exclude
that as a money bags the Strat man might have wormed his way into the position
as an investor in the Globe in 1598-1599. That is not totally impossible but a
rock hard tail of documentation is just not there, when we have every reason to
expect to find it given the fairly impressive records on all the other
activities of the materialistic Strat man. I think that another possibility
is that &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; in these documents is a place holder name....a
legal ficiton of sorts...for the shares owned by Oxford and/or Derby,
especially the latter since the Lord Chamberlain's Men was formed from the core
of actors from the acting company of his family, Lord Strange/Derby's Men.

I have other evidence in my book in preparation that points in this
direction.
But it is not totally out of the question that the Strat man invested in the
Globe or Blackfriar's. The incontrovertible evidence is just not there.

The point was that you accept documentation that, to you, supports
your catholic crap but not equal or better documentation that supports
rival views.

Not convenince, wack, but a VARIETY of documents linking the Stratford
man to Burbage, Heminges and Condell. Not to mention that the
coincidence of one Will Shakespeare with theatre shares, another said
to have written plays put on in that theatre, and a third whose real
name was something else.

Ah, here we supposedly have ONE document supporting Buckwack's
position, so it's &quot;proof.&quot; Care to say more about this alleged
document?

Only one Will Shakespeare was ever called a writer.

Will S. of Stratford definitely owned the Blackfriar's gatehouse--you
agree with this because it supports your delusional system. How is it
that a different Will Shakespeare would've owned shares in the nearby
Blackfriar's Theatre? (With, supposedly, a different John Heminges
than the one who put his name on the gatehouse deed.)

Face it, Buckwack: you're a cherry-picker. Evidence you like is
&quot;proof.&quot; Evidence you don't like can be dismissed. A few documents
concerning the sale of grain or loans such as exist for almost all the
property-owners in Stratford make Shakespeare, for you,
&quot;materialistic&quot; merchant, but a far greater number making him a
writer, like the title-pages, are fraudulent.

Can this be true? Dickson is writing his own book to join the ranks of such
authors as Stephanie Caruana, Paul Streitz, Roger Stritmatter, et al? I can
hardly wait.

Any day now I expect Paul Crowley, Richard Kennedy and Elizabeth Weir to
announce their own first heirs of their anti-stratfordian inventions.

And there is much less proof that Edward De Vere ever did, but you won't

Where are your standards of proof when it comes to the complete lack of
contemporary evidence suggesting that your idol, Oxford, wrote so much
as a single word of Shakespeare's works? Never mind incontrovertible
proof -- cite a single contemporary document that indicates that Edward
de Vere had a hand in Shakespeare's work. Provide just one piece of
evidence that shows how high your standards are.

Given your self-asserted high standards, no doubt you can provide
evidence of murk and strangeness regarding the Globe theater shares?

Which 'aforesaid document'?

So what? We have the name William Shakespeare incontrovertibly
connected with the plays, as writer, Globe shareholder, and actor. It
matters not a whit to me whether he was the William Shakespeare from
Stratford or not; but then, as I have often said, I am a Shakespearean,
not a Stratfordian.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But then what really happened here?

"/>

A man named William Shakespeare wrote plays, acted with the King's Men,
and was a shareholder in the Globe theater. Looks pretty
straightforward to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There is certainly a fiction of sorts here, but it has nothing to do
with the records in question and everything to do with your desperate
need to salvage Oxford. Do you have any evidence at all that real
individuals were used as &quot;place holder names&quot; in Elizabethan England?
If so, would you mind sharing it with us?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; for the shares owned by Oxford and/or Derby,

"/>

There is no evidence, &quot;rock hard&quot; or otherwise, that &quot;Oxford and/or
Derby&quot; ever owned any shares in the Globe. Your pathetic attempt to
claim, on the basis of airy nothing, that William Shakespeare was
anything other than a shareholder in the Globe fails miserably.

As I expected, you dispensed with the requirement for incontrovertible
evidence as soon as I showed, for the umpteenth time, that your
Oxfordian idol had feet of clay. William Shakespeare, whether of
Stratford or no, was a shareholder at the Globe; Edward De Vere was not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; especially the latter since the Lord Chamberlain's Men was formed from
&gt; the core of actors from the acting company of his family, Lord
&gt; Strange/Derby's Men.

"/>

Which of the Lord Chamberlain's Men came from that company? If Stanley
had maintained an interest in any acting troupe, it would more likely
have been the Admiral's Men, headed by Ned Alleyn, the former lead actor
of Lord Strange's Men.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have other evidence in my book in preparation that points in this
&gt; direction.

"/>

I'd bet good money that you have no evidence whatsoever for your
suppositions, assuming that there was anyone foolish enough to bet
otherwise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But it is not totally out of the question that the Strat man invested
&gt; in the Globe or Blackfriar's. The incontrovertible evidence is just

"/>

So what? There is incontrovertible evidence that William Shakespeare
invested in the Globe. There is incontrovertible evidence that William
Shakespeare was a playwright and an actor. You may pretend, if you
wish, that the aforesaid William Shakespeare was only a namesake of
William Shakespeare of Stratford, but he remains the incontrovertible
author of his own works, no matter how badly you want to replace him
with your indigent nobleman.

Really, it would be better for you if you stayed away from the
historical record entirely; it will never bring you comfort.
