A few more wins combined with a few more Brewers / Cubs losses and I
expect we'll see the troll count begin to climb.

Let the good times roll.

You're not considering the Cubs factor. That is, the Cubs can make any
team look like world beaters.

I don't care how much the Cubs spent in the off season, when a player
puts on the accursed Cubs blue, he is doomed to the team's history.

After coughing up a 6-3 lead, the Reds have now plated two in the 8th
on a Josh Hamilton homer to pull ahead again 11-9.  Stay tuned.

Well, the Redlegs managed to bring that trainwreck into the station
and the standings are now:

Milwaukee     62-58    ---
Chicago          60-59    1.5
St. Louis         57-60    3.5

Who woulda thunk it?  Two out in the loss column, with one left at
Milwaukee and four this weekend in the World's Largest Outdoor Beer
Garden and Gay Bar.

The Cardinals' poor performance (1-5) at Pittsburgh and Washington
last week hurts more every time I think about it.

I checked and the Brewers and Cubs have only 3 games left against each

2 of 3 by the Reds was better than I could have hoped for.

&quot;Ya know, it's a shame what happened to think tanks.  They used to
produce valuable, apolitical analysis, but partisanship crept into many
of them and the Bush administration doesn't just come up with something
as stupid as, 'if we leave now, they'll follow us home.'  No, they have
someone from a think tank say it first.  It's a way to lend
respectability, the same reason a tittie bar has food.&quot;
