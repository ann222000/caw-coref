Shakespeare gets a shaking out in scenes from tragedies

Troupe takes drama and asks 'what if?' questions

Sunday, August 15, 2004

BY JENN MCKEE News Arts Writer

Tom Stoppard's innovative 1967 play &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are
Dead&quot; built a fully realized alternative world within the periphery of
Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet.&quot; Now, in a similar spirit, the Brass Tacks
Ensemble has compiled &quot;The Shakespeare Variations,&quot; an original show
of short sketches inspired by 10 of the Bard's tragedies.

&quot;All of us kind of took a part of a play that intrigued us and we
gave it a 'what if' kind of a twist,&quot; said Anne Rhoades, a co-director
and performer.

Another point of departure is that the Brass Tacks Ensemble, in the
midst of all the humor, incorporates a few serious scenes into
&quot;Variations&quot; - specifically, a scene concerning the adaptation of
Hamlet's
&quot;To be or not to be&quot; speech,
as well as one imagining the Earl of Oxford's potential unmasking,
via the seemingly autobiographical play &quot;Timon of Athens,&quot; as the true
Bard.

I think we might wonder what Shakespeare was about in selecting and
treating material the way he did--whether we should understand the box
office requirements and constraints he had to be successful and
sympathize with compromises, sometimes imagining what he would like to
have done if he was more in control of his own wit, as Jonson
observed.

Like, in Hamlet he shows us the central character struggling with
conscience in an antique scenario, not developing an existential
philosophy of his own. So I feel justified in looking for humor where
Shakespeare's ironic wit may be at play, as in Hamlet's asides.

The Marx Brothers' Duck Soup (1933)

Secretary of War: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Enough of this.
How about taking up the tax?

Firefly: How about taking up the carpet?

Secretary of War: I still insist we must take up the tax.

Firefly: He's right. You've got to take up the Tacks
before you can take up the carpet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Gustavus III of Sweden [was] a gifted, complex, and controversial man.
From his somewhat eccentric and rather despotic German-born mother --
Queen Louisa Ulrika, sister of Frederick the Great -- Gustavus inherited
a love of the arts and patronage of artistic endeavor ... As a young
prince, Gustavus developed a fondness for the theater. During a brief
visit to Paris in 1771, he impressed Rousseau with his intelligence ...
Crowned King at age 25, Gustavus pursued his artistic inclinations by
writing plays and even acting in some of them. He also designed scenery
and supervised productions in the tiny Drottningholm Theater. More
importantly, he founded the Swedish Academy and the first Royal Opera
House ... But, as music prospered, the country found itself in financial
distress and political turmoil. For all his sympathies with French
enlightenment, Gustavus turned against the Revolution after the capture
of Louis XVI. He did continue to entertain the vision of social equality
but, in so doing, he antagonized the nobles. Convinced that the king was
leading the country to ruin, a group of conspirators -- among them
Counts Ribbing and Horn -- decided to overthrow him. One of the
conspirators, Captain Ankarstroem, harboring a personal grievance,
carried the plan a fatal step further and shot Gustavus at a masked ball
on March 16, 1792. The scene was the Royal Opera House, the very house
the king had founded. The bullet -- a combination of lead and carpet
Tacks -- struck Gustavus below the heart; death came to him, after much
suffering, only twelve days later. Ankarstroem was executed in a savage
manner after a public flogging, by decapitation, his body quartered.
Ribbing and Horn were sent to permanent exile.&gt;&gt;

some of the story of the play Timon of Athens...

(quote)

SCENE v

&quot;The entire scene is a tissue of contradictions expressly contrived,
one would suppose, to set us thinking of the relations of crime, law,
war, and justice&quot; (Goddard 176). But there's much more in this scene.
The reflections of de Vere's financial woes and need to sell lands are
obvious parallels in this play, but this scene provides another
connection.

The relevant incident is of the 17-year-old Oxford mortally wounding
an under-cook &quot;se defendendo,&quot; which is thought to be the result of
his discovering one of Burghley's spies in his household (Ogburn
454-455). This scene seems to address this, and certainly very little
else in the context of the play, where it merely serves to motivate
Alcibiades' military action against Athens later.

Here in front of the Senate he pleads the case of an unnamed,
condemned friend who &quot;with a noble fury and fair spirit, / Seeing his
reputation touch'd to death, / He did oppose his foe; / And with such
sober and unnoted passion / He did behoove his anger, ere 'twas spent,
/ As if he had but prov'd an argument&quot; (III.v.18-23). In other words,
he killed a man.

Alcibiades acknowledges the anger involved but argues justifiable
homicide and self-defense. But the Senate is adamant and declares,
&quot;He's a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often / Drowns him and takes
his valor prisoner. / ... / In that beastly fury / He has been known
to commit outrages / And cherish factions&quot; (67-72).

Alcibiades then argues that if he owes his life, why not let him die
in war? The Senate gets fed up and banishes Alcibiades, who regrets
suffering the life of a poor soldier while senators grow wealthy and
fat on their usuries.

So there's yet another self-advertisement for soldiery, plus
confirmation of various aspects of public or court opinion of Oxford
circulating, and even that obsession about reputation reputation
reputation that Cassio spazzes out about in Othello and that de Vere
seems elsewhere obsessed by.

SCENE vi

Lords gather at Timon's house for the latest banquet, rationalizing
that he cannot be as destitute as has been reported. Timon dismisses
as insignificant their regrets for not sending the requested funds.
After a bitter blessing over the covered dishes, Timon shouts,
&quot;Uncover, dogs, and lap!&quot; (III.vi.85). The dishes turn out to be
lukewarm water. As he curses them for the parasites they are, he
splashes them, then throws the dishes at them. He hopes his house will
burn down and Athens will crumble; he will despise humankind from now
on. A few guests rummage for their hats and coats and declare Timon
insane.
