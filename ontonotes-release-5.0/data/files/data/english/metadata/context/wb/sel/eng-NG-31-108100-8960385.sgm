Hi!

About a year ago there was a thread here about different methods for backing
up computers with external hard drives. I, myself, use a Maxtor One Touch
80GB for my laptop which has an 80GB HD. Now I need to choose one for my
Dad's new Dell desktop with a 250GB HD.

I bought him an 80GB Iomega from Dell and, using the XP backup utility,
tried to back up and got an error message saying there wasn't enough space.
We have less than 10GB of data on the new computer at this point.

My question is: Do I have a get a 250GB external hard drive to match the
size of the desktop's HD, even though we'll never have anywhere near that
much data? Anyone using a brand other than Maxtor that they like?

TIA for any advice from the computer gurus that hang out here.

Camille

No. You should only need enough space for the data (and some overhead, of
course). Make certain you've configured the backup utility correctly and
that the destination drive is formatted properly with a partition large
enough to hold the data you want it to hold..

Nate,

I think you hit the nail on the head. My intention was to just back up the
data but I had selected &quot;entire contents of the drive&quot; in the XP backup
utility. I tried it again this afternoon and instead of copying all the
contents of the hard drive, I just backed up &quot;All Users Documents, Files &amp;
Settings&quot;. This time it took, with no error message about there not being
enough space.

Thanks,

Camille

Anyone using a brand other than Maxtor that they like?

Maxtor is the only HDD that I have ever had a problm with.
A few years back my HDD quit and I bought a maxtor.
It lasted about a week and quit spinning.
I didn't want to get another Maxtor so I bought a Western Digital.
I gave the Maxtor to a friend and he returned it to Maxtor and they sent him
a knew one.
That one died a few weeks later.
Since then I have bought all Western Digital and have been satisfied.

A couple of months back I bought a Hitachi &quot;The Easy Hard Drive&quot;.  It's a
pre-programmed packaged device that includes its own backup software.
Although I couldn't find a link for it on the Hitachi webpage, here's one
that at least shows it:
http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/06/hitachis-external-easy-hard-drive-...

Unfortunately, it came formatted FAT32...which for a 1-terabyte HDD seems
absurd to say the least.  In any event, I reformatted it (converted it,
actually) to NTFS, and use it as my backup destination for my automatic MS
LiveOne Care backups.  Now I do a full backup every night.  Besides the full
backup, I moved some DVD's, doc files, webfiles, music, video &amp; other
pictures to it.

Donno how well this would suit anyone else, but it's working great for me!

Just a note of caution here on backing up to an external hard drive.  I had
been doing so on a regular basis.  Then, back in August, we were hit by a
very nearby lightning strike.  All my computer gear that used 120 VAC was
plugged into a surge protector.  No matter.  The lightning entered via my
broadband cable connection.  Destroyed the cable modem, wiped out the PC,
both mother board and both hard drives,  then proceeded to destroy
everything connected to the computer via USB connectors; printer, mouse,
keyboard, and of course the external back up hard drive.

So to be on the safe side, disconnect the external HD from the computer when
not actually using it.  Fortunately, I have most of my stuff also backed up
to CD-RW's, but teaching Vista to use all the programs is a PITA.

Ya but, have you encountered WGA(Window Genuine Advantage) yet? The reason I
bring that up is, I have a 250gb drive that was cloned from a 80gb drive.
Since that cloning I accidentally got suckered into installing WGA. This
allowed me to download the latest patches for Winxp, but little did I know
that with WGA installed, everytime you boot up it contacts MS server to
check for authenticity of the operating system. Not a problem until you
decide to replace the original drive with the clone. From what I have heard
on some forums is that the MS authenticity server gathers up info and checks
it against their database. Some of this info is your hard drive serial
number, your bios checksum, and various other sundry  bits.
So when I put the 250gb in service and booted up, waahla there was a message
telling me that my hardware configuration had changed significantly and I
had to go through a revalidation process. I wasn't in the mood for that and
just put the original drive back in service. Since then I have been
gathering info on this WGA and it's genesis, trying to understand the
ramifications concerning cloning. As it's implemented right now, It appears,
that if I clone to a larger drive, I might not be able to pass the
validation process and will have to fork over $99 to MS to use the same
operating system that I originally  paid $99 for on the larger drive. I
think that I'm being taken advantage of, but I also believe that under the
terms of their EULA they are in the right. I have since learned there are at
least two class action suits and will watch them, but in the mean time will
explore Linux.

Possibly.  OTOH; I've read somewhere that there are ways to do that without
getting charged for it...but to be honest I've not done that so I have no
credible, actual experience to tell you about.  Given that my C: &amp; D: drives
are both 300GB's, I'm not likely to have to migrate to more storage any time
soon.

FWIW; when I add HDD's, I add them as ancillary drives to the original.
Keeps you from having to muck with the original (and getting those problems
you were having), and makes it easier to add and remove more in the future.

Fortunately, with a terabyte of storage in the new Hitachi, I'm probably not
gonna hafta do that for some time...(:-o)!

This information about Windows Genuine Advantage is sort of right.  At
the time I ran into the problem, MS reported that a score is calculated
based on the hardware.  If you change out a hard drive, you add to that
score.  If you change out a DVD player, HD, floppy and video card, you
will have a higher score.  At some point MS will decide the computer the
operating system (OS) is registered in is different than the one it
is in.  This is done during updating, not during booting.

At the time, I had a number of identical laptops.  One computer failed
and I wanted to place the drive from that computer in another.  The
failed computer was to go to warranty repair.  MS reported the OS was
invalid.  I called MS, explained, read off the stickers on both
machines, was given a new validation number and off I went.

Of the methods to protect their rights to their operating system, this
method was inconvenient but not insurmountable.

I recently moved another drive into a like computer and found MS didn't
complain.  Perhaps something changed.  Perhaps it was because the two
drives were the same model.

Don't think that was such a good idea IF that was the drive you were
expecting to restore from.  IF you have to restore from down at the DOS
level, DOS can't read NTFS.

There is a reason why new computers that come formatted NTFS and include
a partition for restoring problem primary partitions are formatted FAT
or FAT32.

&gt;&gt; Ya but, have you encountered WGA(Window Genuine Advantage) yet? The
&gt;&gt; reason I bring that up is, I have a 250gb drive that was cloned from
&gt;&gt; a 80gb drive. Since that cloning I accidentally got suckered into
&gt;&gt; installing WGA. This allowed me to download the latest patches for
&gt;&gt; Winxp, but little did I know that with WGA installed, everytime you
&gt;&gt; boot up it contacts MS server to check for authenticity of the
&gt;&gt; operating system. Not a problem until you
&gt; I don't think that's the case, Frank.  I think it only checks when
&gt; you try to do an update.

I don't think so. All I did was boot up into windows. But I will put the
drive back into service and see what happens.

&gt; Possibly.  OTOH; I've read somewhere that there are ways to do that
&gt; without getting charged for it...but to be honest I've not done that
&gt; so I have no credible, actual experience to tell you about.  Given
&gt; that my C: &amp; D: drives are both 300GB's, I'm not likely to have to
&gt; migrate to more storage any time soon.

&gt; FWIW; when I add HDD's, I add them as ancillary drives to the
&gt; original. Keeps you from having to muck with the original (and
&gt; getting those problems you were having), and makes it easier to add
&gt; and remove more in the future.

Have you read about some of the comments by Steve Balmer? He indicates that
lawsuits are going to be instigated in the future, with Redhat as one of the
future targets. This is in regards to Microsofts IP(intellectual property)
that he hinted Redhat was violating.

If you have been watching the SCO lawsuit against Redhat, Novell and IBM,
where SCO claimed code in the kernal of Linux and Unix was SCO's property,
you know that the judge in the case ruled in favor of Novell and the no-sue
license money that SCO has been extorting from companies is now going to be
reclaimed by Novell if there is any money left after SCO filed for
bankruptcy.

I read somewhere that Microsoft has just spent about a billion and a half in
the last year acquiring patents, which I believe is going to be the basis
for future income for Microsoft.  They see Linux as a real threat and are
preparing for war.

Good point, &quot;Mickey&quot;!  OTOH; I don't know why I'd ever expect to have to
resort to DOS to restore a backup.  I mean the system has to be up and
running to even be able to read and restore the backup files, doesn't it?
Cuz it's not gonna be able to access a USB drive w/o considerable OS
support.  And if it's up and running, why not use the designated tools?

Yep.  Certainly true.  But not (for me, at least) a conclusive reason to
aschew NTFS.  Or did I miss something?

&gt; number, your bios checksum, and various other sundry  bits.
&gt; So when I put the 250gb in service and booted up, waahla there was a message
&gt; telling me that my hardware configuration had changed significantly and I
&gt; had to go through a revalidation process. I wasn't in the mood for that and
&gt; just put the original drive back in service. Since then I have been
&gt; gathering info on this WGA and it's genesis, trying to understand the
&gt; ramifications concerning cloning. As it's implemented right now, It appears,
&gt; that if I clone to a larger drive, I might not be able to pass the
&gt; validation process and will have to fork over $99 to MS to use the same
&gt; operating system that I originally  paid $99 for on the larger drive. I
&gt; think that I'm being taken advantage of, but I also believe that under the
&gt; terms of their EULA they are in the right. I have since learned there are at

From a recent discussion on another forum I frequent.  MS uses a point
system with each of the major components given a point value.  Believe
the number for requirement to contact MS for reactivation is 7.  The HD
is good for 1 or 2 points.  MOBO is given 4 pts. If on-board audio,
video and network controller, that adds a few other points so mobo
replacement is likely going to require you to phone home.
