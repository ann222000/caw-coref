&gt;   I May Have Gone Insane
&gt;    By William Rivers Pitt
&gt;    t r u t h o u t | Columnist

&gt;    Wednesday 19 September 2007

&gt;    We dance round in a ring and suppose,
&gt;    But the Secret sits in the middle and knows.

&gt;    - Robert Frost, &quot;The Secret Sits&quot;

&gt;    It is a legitimately demented phenomenon, all the more so because
&gt;it all started with a joke. Not even a funny joke, either, but a sad
&gt;and threadbare thing I told only to myself, and no one else. When the
&gt;clustered elements of our collective national burden erupted in
&gt;masterfully synchronized bedlam, as they so often seem to, I had that
&gt;joke to tell myself, and it may not have helped much, but it was
&gt;there.

&gt;    Every time another cacophony of freshly minted lunacy was
&gt;unleashed - lunacy regarding Iraq, the NSA domestic surveillance
&gt;program, White House defiance of subpoenas, timorously flaccid
&gt;performances by the Congressional majority, or merely when enduring
&gt;the repeated &quot;nukyalur&quot;-ized butchery of public political rhetoric was
&gt;required by my employers, all of which emphatically pegged the needle
&gt;on my Pandemoni-O-Meter - I had that joke to tell myself.

&gt;    The joke is spherically terrible, i.e. bad in every possible
&gt;direction in three dimensions and across 360 rounded degrees. It isn't
&gt;even a joke, really, which may be why it went so abruptly and
&gt;bewilderingly sideways on me months ago. The joke, to be
&gt;embarrassingly honest, is more like some half-bright mantra than
&gt;anything else. As I came to discover, however, it managed to settle my
&gt;mind when the needle was in the red. Perhaps the thing is best
&gt;described as my self-generated Zen koan; though it did not actually
&gt;stop my mind in proper koan fashion, it kept me from putting my head
&gt;through the wall, and that made it valuable indeed.

&gt;    The joke: people say Bush and his people want to raze the core
&gt;nature of the country itself by wrecking the Constitution, and they're
&gt;correct. People say Bush and his people are enriching their friends
&gt;beyond dreams of avarice at our actual expense, by way of war-inflated
&gt;oil prices; war-captured Iraqi oil infrastructure; the orgiastic
&gt;plunder of Treasury money through calamitously unsound tax cuts for
&gt;Bush's pals; and through an Iraq war profiteering scam so unutterably
&gt;corrupt that it bends the very light. That, and more besides, is what
&gt;people say, and they're correct.

&gt;    But all that, along with everything else the Bush crew has done,
&gt;just isn't enough for them. What Bush and his people really seek, at
&gt;bottom, is to destroy the basic definition and literal existence of
&gt;reality itself. They want to destroy reality, rebuild it according to
&gt;their own blueprint, so the sum and substance of this new reality will
&gt;accept as axiomatic the idea that lying, stealing and wholesale
&gt;carnage are badges of integrity and moral clarity. In other words, our
&gt;comprehensively understood reality today would be replaced by whatever
&gt;madcap anti-reality currently exists within the walls of 1600
&gt;Pennsylvania Avenue.

&gt;    I warned you.

&gt;    As bad as that chaotically crossbred joke/rant/mantra thing is, it
&gt;wasn't meant to be anything other than a harmless sliver of wordplay,
&gt;something that settled my nerves and gave me a private little chuckle
&gt;- that alone, and nothing more.

&gt;    Things are different now. It isn't a joke anymore, at least not to
&gt;me. The premise that the Bush administration has literally been trying
&gt;to shatter elemental reality on planet Earth has steadily gained
&gt;traction in my mind. It started as that sort-of joke, then it became
&gt;an idea, and then it became an actual hypothesis, a working theory
&gt;requiring research and evidence and argument so that, someday, I can
&gt;prove it to be an unassailable bone-basic truth.

&gt;    And yes, the fact that I'm quite serious about this has me quietly
&gt;yet legitimately concerned for my own mental health. What worries me
&gt;the most, however, is a freshly minted suspicion that it is already
&gt;over, that the deal already went down, but almost nobody actually
&gt;noticed when it happened. I think these Bush folks may have
&gt;successfully pulled it off right in front of our noses over the course
&gt;of this past August. I think they may have actually broken reality,
&gt;cobbling together a chaotic replacement, and I think I can back up
&gt;that supposition all the way down the block and back again.

&gt;    Bear with me.

&gt;    The process began in earnest more than a year ago with a publicity
&gt;campaign that deliberately made no sense whatsoever. Day after day,
&gt;statements and declarations came from all manner of White House
&gt;officials that were little more than bags of over-the-moon nonsense -
&gt;all patently inaccurate to nine decimals, yet spoken shamelessly into
&gt;cameras with bare faces hanging out.

&gt;    With this, the Bush folks laid the mental foundation of the new
&gt;reality to come; that foundation had to transmute lies into facts
&gt;while still stuck in the old reality, but they had an edge that may
&gt;have proven decisive: trust. If the American people hear the White
&gt;House repeatedly claim that water is not wet and Godzilla is real,
&gt;many of those Americans will believe it after a fashion.

&gt;    The rumored totality of America's cynical scorn for politics and
&gt;leaders notwithstanding, this country has many citizens who still
&gt;believe, even after what has happened, that if the president of the
&gt;United States says it, then it must be true. This isn't a conscious
&gt;thing; it happens way back in the slushy part of the brain, where
&gt;unpleasant facts or disquieting fears are submerged and drowned like
&gt;rats in an applesauce vat. Bush and his crew counted on that, using TV
&gt;news messaging to furrow the field in preparation for seeding time,
&gt;and their trust in the trust of Americans was shown to be well-placed.

&gt;    When the serious push came, it came fast and furious. Dick Cheney
&gt;declared that the Vice President's office no longer existed within the
&gt;Executive branch because he didn't want to give any of his documents
&gt;to the National Archives as is required by law, and actually went on
&gt;to defend the legitimacy of his astonishing, arrogant, galactically
&gt;mistaken declaration, and he got away with it.

&gt;    Bush's lawyers put forth a claim of Executive Privilege that was
&gt;the very living essence of overheated hubris run amok - a claim that
&gt;for all intents and purposes declared Bush and his people to be fully
&gt;and completely above the rule of law, and he got away with it.
&gt;Subpoenas issued by Congress were either utterly ignored or smugly
&gt;slapped aside, and the lawyers got away with it.

&gt;    Another piece of draconian surveillance legislation aimed at
&gt;shattering our remaining rights arrived in Congress, so the Bush folks
&gt;brazenly bullied the majority into passing it by threatening to blame
&gt;them for the next terrorist attack to come, whereupon the majority
&gt;instantly wilted like orchids in a snowbank, the bill passed with room
&gt;to spare, and once again they got away with it.

&gt;    Cheney's chief of staff was convicted for lying about lying about
&gt;lying about outing a deep-cover CIA agent and sentenced to federal
&gt;prison, initiating the single most observably crooked bag-job in
&gt;modern political history: Libby took the bullet for his boss, got
&gt;rewarded for his service with a presidential get-out-of-jail-free
&gt;card, and they all got away with it.

&gt;    All of this was deployed in rapid succession, presenting the
&gt;American people with a sudden feast of gibberish that has redefined
&gt;incoherence across the board: the VP is not in the executive branch,
&gt;and the executive branch is above the law, and the majority in
&gt;Congress is actually the minority, and obstructing justice to protect
&gt;Cheney from being prosecuted for annihilating a CIA operative isn't
&gt;anything to get in a snit about. If that is not prima facie evidence
&gt;that a new reality has been imposed upon us, then I don't know what
&gt;is.

&gt;    After all that came August, and if I'm right, the process was
&gt;brought to a successful conclusion. In a way, this was the greatest
&gt;challenge for Bush and his people, because they all had to argue time
&gt;and again that Iraq was doing fine, that the whole thing was about
&gt;freedom, that there was no civil war, that the &quot;surge&quot; worked, that
&gt;the American people truly supported the whole bloody carnivorous
&gt;process, and be damned with poll numbers and pundits and contradictory
&gt;facts. General Petraeus was rolled out on cue, he hummed his bars and
&gt;faked it at the same time, and as far as the mainstream press was
&gt;concerned, the White House won the argument and that's that.

&gt;    Think about it. The weapons of mass destruction were not there,
&gt;connections to 9/11 and Osama bin Laden were not there, the hearts and
&gt;flowers were not there, thousands upon thousands have been killed,
&gt;billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars have been translated into
&gt;the bank accounts of administration allies, a civil war is raging
&gt;beyond any semblance of control there, Iraq's much-ballyhooed
&gt;democracy is almost as chaotic as the streets outside Parliament, and
&gt;the entire disaster has become a Quantico training ground for scores
&gt;of bomb-makers looking to ply their trade in the wider world beyond.

&gt;    And they got away with it. If that is reality, I want no part of
&gt;it.

&gt;    It must be clearly understood, however, that I do not discount the
&gt;very real possibility that I have, finally and for all time, gone
&gt;insane because of all this. My theory is not proven beyond doubt; my
&gt;suspicions grow stronger by the hour, but I could simply be this
&gt;barking madman no longer able to recognize reality even when it is
&gt;staring me in the eye. I'm pretty sure of my footing, but the truth is
&gt;that if I did go over the high side somewhere along the line, I'd be
&gt;the last person to figure that

&gt;declared that the Vice President's office no longer existed within the
&gt;Executive branch because he didn't want to give any of his documents
&gt;to the National Archives as is required by law, and actually went on
&gt;to defend the legitimacy of his astonishing, arrogant, galactically
&gt;mistaken declaration, and he got away with it.

&gt;    Bush's lawyers put forth a claim of Executive Privilege that was
&gt;the very living essence of overheated hubris run amok - a claim that
&gt;for all intents and purposes declared Bush and his people to be fully
&gt;and completely above the rule of law, and he got away with it.
&gt;Subpoenas issued by Congress were either utterly ignored or smugly
&gt;slapped aside, and the lawyers got away with it.

&gt;    Another piece of draconian surveillance legislation aimed at
&gt;shattering our remaining rights arrived in Congress, so the Bush folks
&gt;brazenly bullied the majority into passing it by threatening to blame
&gt;them for the next terrorist attack to come, whereupon the majority
&gt;instantly wilted like orchids in a snowbank, the bill passed with room
&gt;to spare, and once again they got away with it.

&gt;    Cheney's chief of staff was convicted for lying about lying about
&gt;lying about outing a deep-cover CIA agent and sentenced to federal
&gt;prison, initiating the single most observably crooked bag-job in
&gt;modern political history: Libby took the bullet for his boss, got
&gt;rewarded for his service with a presidential get-out-of-jail-free
&gt;card, and they all got away with it.

&gt;    All of this was deployed in rapid succession, presenting the
&gt;American people with a sudden feast of gibberish that has redefined
&gt;incoherence across the board: the VP is not in the executive branch,
&gt;and the executive branch is above the law, and the majority in
&gt;Congress is actually the minority, and obstructing justice to protect
&gt;Cheney from being prosecuted for annihilating a CIA operative isn't
&gt;anything to get in a snit about. If that is not prima facie evidence
&gt;that a new reality has been imposed upon us, then I don't know what
&gt;is.

&gt;    After all that came August, and if I'm right, the process was
&gt;brought to a successful conclusion. In a way, this was the greatest
&gt;challenge for Bush and his people, because they all had to argue time
&gt;and again that Iraq was doing fine, that the whole thing was about
&gt;freedom, that there was no civil war, that the &quot;surge&quot; worked, that
&gt;the American people truly supported the whole bloody carnivorous
&gt;process, and be damned with poll numbers and pundits and contradictory
&gt;facts. General Petraeus was rolled out on cue, he hummed his bars and
&gt;faked it at the same time, and as far as the mainstream press was
&gt;concerned, the White House won the argument and that's that.

&gt;    Think about it. The weapons of mass destruction were not there,

&gt;flowers were not there, thousands upon thousands have been killed,
&gt;billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars have been translated into

&gt;democracy is almost as chaotic as the streets outside Parliament, and

&gt;of bomb-makers looking to ply their trade in the wider world beyond.

&gt;    And they got away with it. If that is reality, I want no part of
&gt;it.

&gt;    It must be clearly understood, however, that I do not discount the
&gt;very real possibility that I have, finally and for all time, gone
&gt;insane because of all this. My theory is not proven beyond doubt; my
&gt;suspicions grow stronger by the hour, but I could simply be this

&gt;   I May Have Gone Insane
&gt;    By William Rivers Pitt
&gt;    t r u t h o u t | Columnist

&gt;    Wednesday 19 September 2007

&gt;    We dance round in a ring and suppose,
&gt;    But the Secret sits in the middle and knows.

&gt;    - Robert Frost, &quot;The Secret Sits&quot;

&gt;    It is a legitimately demented phenomenon, all the more so because
&gt;it all started with a joke. Not even a funny joke, either, but a sad
&gt;and threadbare thing I told only to myself, and no one else. When the
&gt;clustered elements of our collective national burden erupted in
&gt;masterfully synchronized bedlam, as they so often seem to, I had that
&gt;joke to tell myself, and it may not have helped much, but it was
&gt;there.

&gt;    Every time another cacophony of freshly minted lunacy was
&gt;unleashed - lunacy regarding Iraq, the NSA domestic surveillance
&gt;program, White House defiance of subpoenas, timorously flaccid
&gt;performances by the Congressional majority, or merely when enduring
&gt;the repeated &quot;nukyalur&quot;-ized butchery of public political rhetoric was
&gt;required by my employers, all of which emphatically pegged the needle
&gt;on my Pandemoni-O-Meter - I had that joke to tell myself.

&gt;    The joke is spherically terrible, i.e. bad in every possible
&gt;direction in three dimensions and across 360 rounded degrees. It isn't
&gt;even a joke, really, which may be why it went so abruptly and
&gt;bewilderingly sideways on me months ago. The joke, to be
&gt;embarrassingly honest, is more like some half-bright mantra than
&gt;anything else. As I came to discover, however, it managed to settle my
&gt;mind when the needle was in the red. Perhaps the thing is best
&gt;described as my self-generated Zen koan; though it did not actually
&gt;stop my mind in proper koan fashion, it kept me from putting my head
&gt;through the wall, and that made it valuable indeed.

&gt;    The joke: people say Bush and his people want to raze the core
&gt;nature of the country itself by wrecking the Constitution, and they're
&gt;correct. People say Bush and his people are enriching their friends
&gt;beyond dreams of avarice at our actual expense, by way of war-inflated
&gt;oil prices; war-captured Iraqi oil infrastructure; the orgiastic
&gt;plunder of Treasury money through calamitously unsound tax cuts for
&gt;Bush's pals; and through an Iraq war profiteering scam so unutterably
&gt;corrupt that it bends the very light. That, and more besides, is what
&gt;people say, and they're correct.

&gt;    But all that, along with everything else the Bush crew has done,
&gt;just isn't enough for them. What Bush and his people really seek, at
&gt;bottom, is to destroy the basic definition and literal existence of
&gt;reality itself. They want to destroy reality, rebuild it according to
&gt;their own blueprint, so the sum and substance of this new reality will
&gt;accept as axiomatic the idea that lying, stealing and wholesale
&gt;carnage are badges of integrity and moral clarity. In other words, our
&gt;comprehensively understood reality today would be replaced by whatever
&gt;madcap anti-reality currently exists within the walls of 1600
&gt;Pennsylvania Avenue.

&gt;    I warned you.

&gt;    As bad as that chaotically crossbred joke/rant/mantra thing is, it
&gt;wasn't meant to be anything other than a harmless sliver of wordplay,
&gt;something that settled my nerves and gave me a private little chuckle
&gt;- that alone, and nothing more.

&gt;    Things are different now. It isn't a joke anymore, at least not to
&gt;me. The premise that the Bush administration has literally been trying
&gt;to shatter elemental reality on planet Earth has steadily gained
&gt;traction in my mind. It started as that sort-of joke, then it became
&gt;an idea, and then it became an actual hypothesis, a working theory
&gt;requiring research and evidence and argument so that, someday, I can
&gt;prove it to be an unassailable bone-basic truth.

&gt;    And yes, the fact that I'm quite serious about this has me quietly
&gt;yet legitimately concerned for my own mental health. What worries me
&gt;the most, however, is a freshly minted suspicion that it is already
&gt;over, that the deal already went down, but almost nobody actually
&gt;noticed when it happened. I think these Bush folks may have
&gt;successfully pulled it off right in front of our noses over the course
&gt;of this past August. I think they may have actually broken reality,
&gt;cobbling together a chaotic replacement, and I think I can back up
&gt;that supposition all the way down the block and back again.

&gt;    Bear with me.

&gt;    The process began in earnest more than a year ago with a publicity
&gt;campaign that deliberately made no sense whatsoever. Day after day,
&gt;statements and declarations came from all manner of White House
&gt;officials that were little more than bags of over-the-moon nonsense -
&gt;all patently inaccurate to nine decimals, yet spoken shamelessly into
&gt;cameras with bare faces hanging out.

&gt;    With this, the Bush folks laid the mental foundation of the new
&gt;reality to come; that foundation had to transmute lies into facts
&gt;while still stuck in the old reality, but they had an edge that may
&gt;have proven decisive: trust. If the American people hear the White
&gt;House repeatedly claim that water is not wet and Godzilla is real,
&gt;many of those Americans will believe it after a fashion.

&gt;    The rumored totality of America's cynical scorn for politics and
&gt;leaders notwithstanding, this country has many citizens who still
&gt;believe, even after what has happened, that if the president of the
&gt;United States says it, then it must be true. This isn't a conscious
&gt;thing; it happens way back in the slushy part of the brain, where
&gt;unpleasant facts or disquieting fears are submerged and drowned like
&gt;rats in an applesauce vat. Bush and his crew counted on that, using TV
&gt;news messaging to furrow the field in preparation for seeding time,
&gt;and their trust in the trust of Americans was shown to be well-placed.

&gt;    When the serious push came, it came fast and furious. Dick Cheney
&gt;declared that the Vice President's office no longer existed within the
&gt;Executive branch because he didn't want to give any of his documents
&gt;to the National Archives as is required by law, and actually went on
&gt;to defend the legitimacy of his astonishing, arrogant, galactically
&gt;mistaken declaration, and he got away with it.

&gt;    Bush's lawyers put forth a claim of Executive Privilege that was
&gt;the very living essence of overheated hubris run amok - a claim that
&gt;for all intents and purposes declared Bush and his people to be fully
&gt;and completely above the rule of law, and he got away with it.
&gt;Subpoenas issued by Congress were either utterly ignored or smugly
&gt;slapped aside, and the lawyers got away with it.

&gt;    Another piece of draconian surveillance legislation aimed at
&gt;shattering our remaining rights arrived in Congress, so the Bush folks
&gt;brazenly bullied the majority into passing it by threatening to blame
&gt;them for the next terrorist attack to come, whereupon the majority
&gt;instantly wilted like orchids in a snowbank, the bill passed with room
&gt;to spare, and once again they got away with it.

&gt;    Cheney's chief of staff was convicted for lying about lying about
&gt;lying about outing a deep-cover CIA agent and sentenced to federal
&gt;prison, initiating the single most observably crooked bag-job in
&gt;modern political history: Libby took the bullet for his boss, got
&gt;rewarded for his service with a presidential get-out-of-jail-free
&gt;card, and they all got away with it.

&gt;    All of this was deployed in rapid succession, presenting the
&gt;American people with a sudden feast of gibberish that has redefined

&gt;billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars have been translated into

&gt;it all started with a joke. Not even a funny joke, either, but a sad
&gt;and threadbare thing I told only to myself, and no one else. When the
&gt;clustered elements of our collective national burden erupted in
&gt;masterfully synchronized bedlam, as they so often seem to, I had that
&gt;joke to tell myself, and it may not have helped much, but it was
&gt;there.

&gt;    Every time another cacophony of freshly minted lunacy was
&gt;unleashed - lunacy regarding Iraq, the NSA domestic surveillance
&gt;program, White House defiance of subpoenas, timorously flaccid
&gt;performances by the Congressional majority, or merely when enduring
&gt;the repeated &quot;nukyalur&quot;-ized butchery of public political rhetoric was
&gt;required by my employers, all of which emphatically pegged the needle
&gt;on my Pandemoni-O-Meter - I had that joke to tell myself.

&gt;    The joke is spherically terrible, i.e. bad in every possible
&gt;direction in three dimensions and across 360 rounded degrees. It isn't
&gt;even a joke, really, which may be why it went so abruptly and
&gt;bewilderingly sideways on me months ago. The joke, to be
&gt;embarrassingly honest, is more like some half-bright mantra than
&gt;anything else. As I came to discover, however, it managed to settle my
&gt;mind when the needle was in the red. Perhaps the thing is best
&gt;described as my self-generated Zen koan; though it did not actually
&gt;stop my mind in proper koan fashion, it kept me from putting my head
&gt;through the wall, and that made it valuable indeed.

&gt;    The joke: people say Bush and his people want to raze the core
&gt;nature of the country itself by wrecking the Constitution, and they're
&gt;correct. People say Bush and his people are enriching their friends
&gt;beyond dreams of avarice at our actual expense, by way of war-inflated
&gt;oil prices; war-captured Iraqi oil infrastructure; the orgiastic
&gt;plunder of Treasury money through calamitously unsound tax cuts for
&gt;Bush's pals; and through an Iraq war profiteering scam so unutterably
&gt;corrupt that it bends the very light. That, and more besides, is what
&gt;people say, and they're correct.

&gt;    But all that, along with everything else the Bush crew has done,
&gt;just isn't enough for them. What Bush and his people really seek, at
&gt;bottom, is to destroy the basic definition and literal existence of
&gt;reality itself. They want to destroy reality, rebuild it according to
&gt;their own blueprint, so the sum and substance of this new reality will
&gt;accept as axiomatic the idea that lying, stealing and wholesale
&gt;carnage are badges of integrity and moral clarity. In other words, our
&gt;comprehensively understood reality today would be replaced by whatever
&gt;madcap anti-reality currently exists within the walls of 1600
&gt;Pennsylvania Avenue.

&gt;    I warned you.

&gt;    As bad as that chaotically crossbred joke/rant/mantra thing is, it
&gt;wasn't meant to be anything other than a harmless sliver of wordplay,
&gt;something that settled my nerves and gave me a private little chuckle
&gt;- that alone, and nothing more.

&gt;    Things are different now. It isn't a joke anymore, at least not to
&gt;me. The premise that the Bush administration has literally been trying
&gt;to shatter elemental reality on planet Earth has steadily gained
&gt;traction in my mind. It started as that sort-of joke, then it became
&gt;an idea, and then it became an actual hypothesis, a working theory
&gt;requiring research and evidence and argument so that, someday, I can
&gt;prove it to be an unassailable bone-basic truth.

&gt;    And yes, the fact that I'm quite serious about this has me quietly
&gt;yet legitimately concerned for my own mental health. What worries me
&gt;the most, however, is a freshly minted suspicion that it is already
&gt;over, that the deal already went down, but almost nobody actually
&gt;noticed when it happened. I think these Bush folks may have
&gt;successfully pulled it off right in front of our noses over the course
&gt;of this past August. I think they may have actually broken reality,
&gt;cobbling together a chaotic replacement, and I think I can back up
&gt;that supposition all the way down the block and back again.

&gt;    Bear with me.

&gt;    The process began in earnest more than a year ago with a publicity
&gt;campaign that deliberately made no sense whatsoever. Day after day,
&gt;statements and declarations came from all manner of White House
&gt;officials that were little more than bags of over-the-moon nonsense -
&gt;all patently inaccurate to nine decimals, yet spoken shamelessly into
&gt;cameras with bare faces hanging out.

&gt;    With this, the Bush folks laid the mental foundation of the new
&gt;reality to come; that foundation had to transmute lies into facts
&gt;while still stuck in the old reality, but they had an edge that may
&gt;have proven decisive: trust. If the American people hear the White
&gt;House repeatedly claim that water is not wet and Godzilla is real,
&gt;many of those Americans will believe it after a fashion.

&gt;    The rumored totality of America's cynical scorn for politics and
&gt;leaders notwithstanding, this country has many citizens who still
&gt;believe, even after what has happened, that if the president of the
&gt;United States says it, then it must be true. This isn't a conscious
&gt;thing; it happens way back in the slushy part of the brain, where
&gt;unpleasant facts or disquieting fears are submerged and drowned like
&gt;rats in an applesauce vat. Bush and his crew counted on that, using TV
&gt;news messaging to furrow the field in preparation for seeding time,
&gt;and their trust in the trust of Americans was shown to be well-placed.

&gt;    When the serious push came, it came fast and furious. Dick Cheney
&gt;declared that the Vice President's office no longer existed within the
&gt;Executive branch because he didn't want to give any of his documents
&gt;to the National Archives as is required by law, and actually went on
&gt;to defend the legitimacy of his astonishing, arrogant, galactically
&gt;mistaken declaration, and he got away with it.

&gt;    Bush's lawyers put forth a claim of Executive Privilege that was
&gt;the very living essence of overheated hubris run amok - a claim that
&gt;for all intents and purposes declared Bush and his people to be fully
&gt;and completely above the rule of law, and he got away with it.
&gt;Subpoenas issued by Congress were either utterly ignored or smugly
&gt;slapped aside, and the lawyers got away with it.

&gt;    Another piece of draconian surveillance legislation aimed at
&gt;shattering our remaining rights arrived in Congress, so the Bush folks
&gt;brazenly bullied the majority into passing it by threatening to blame
&gt;them for the next terrorist attack to come, whereupon the majority
&gt;instantly wilted like orchids in a snowbank, the bill passed with room
&gt;to spare, and once again they got away with it.

&gt;    Cheney's chief of staff was convicted for lying about lying about
&gt;lying about outing a deep-cover CIA agent and sentenced to federal
&gt;prison, initiating the single most observably crooked bag-job in
&gt;modern political history: Libby took the bullet for his boss, got
&gt;rewarded for his service with a presidential get-out-of-jail-free
&gt;card, and they all got away with it.

&gt;    All of this was deployed in rapid succession, presenting the
&gt;American people with a sudden feast of gibberish that has redefined
&gt;incoherence across the board: the VP is not in the executive branch,
&gt;and the executive branch is above the law, and the majority in
&gt;Congress is actually the minority, and obstructing justice to protect
&gt;Cheney from being prosecuted for annihilating a CIA operative isn't
&gt;anything to get in a snit about. If that is not prima facie evidence
&gt;that a new reality has been imposed upon us, then I don't know what
&gt;is.

&gt;    After all that came August, and if I'm right, the process was
&gt;brought to a successful conclusion. In a way, this was the greatest
&gt;challenge for Bush and his people, because they all had to argue time
&gt;and again that Iraq was doing fine, that the whole thing was about
&gt;freedom, that there was no civil war, that the &quot;surge&quot; worked, that
&gt;the American people truly supported the whole bloody carnivorous
&gt;process, and be damned with poll numbers and pundits and contradictory
&gt;facts. General Petraeus was rolled out on cue, he hummed his bars and
&gt;faked it at the same time, and as far as the mainstream press was
&gt;concerned, the White House won the argument and that's that.

&gt;    Think about it. The weapons of mass destruction were not there,

&gt;   I May Have Gone Insane
&gt;    By William Rivers Pitt
&gt;    t r u t h o u t | Columnist

&gt;    Wednesday 19 September 2007

&gt;    We dance round in a ring and suppose,
&gt;    But the Secret sits in the middle and knows.

&gt;    - Robert Frost, &quot;The Secret Sits&quot;

&gt;    It is a legitimately demented phenomenon, all the more so because
&gt;it all started with a joke. Not even a funny joke, either, but a sad
&gt;and threadbare thing I told only to myself, and no one else. When the
&gt;clustered elements of our collective national burden erupted in
&gt;masterfully synchronized bedlam, as they so often seem to, I had that
&gt;joke to tell myself, and it may not have helped much, but it was
&gt;there.

&gt;    Every time another cacophony of freshly minted lunacy was
&gt;unleashed - lunacy regarding Iraq, the NSA domestic surveillance
&gt;program, White House defiance of subpoenas, timorously flaccid
&gt;performances by the Congressional majority, or merely when enduring
&gt;the repeated &quot;nukyalur&quot;-ized butchery of public political rhetoric was
&gt;required by my employers, all of which emphatically pegged the needle
&gt;on my Pandemoni-O-Meter - I had that joke to tell myself.

&gt;    The joke is spherically terrible, i.e. bad in every possible
&gt;direction in three dimensions and across 360 rounded degrees. It isn't
&gt;even a joke, really, which may be why it went so abruptly and
&gt;bewilderingly sideways on me months ago. The joke, to be
&gt;embarrassingly honest, is more like some half-bright mantra than
&gt;anything else. As I came to discover, however, it managed to settle my
&gt;mind when the needle was in the red. Perhaps the thing is best
&gt;described as my self-generated Zen koan; though it did not actually
&gt;stop my mind in proper koan fashion, it kept me from putting my head
&gt;through the wall, and that made it valuable indeed.

&gt;    The joke: people say Bush and his people want to raze the core
&gt;nature of the country itself by wrecking the Constitution, and they're
&gt;correct. People say Bush and his people are enriching their friends
&gt;beyond dreams of avarice at our actual expense, by way of war-inflated
&gt;oil prices; war-captured Iraqi oil infrastructure; the orgiastic
&gt;plunder of Treasury money through calamitously unsound tax cuts for
&gt;Bush's pals; and through an Iraq war profiteering scam so unutterably
&gt;corrupt that it bends the very light. That, and more besides, is what
&gt;people say, and they're correct.

&gt;    But all that, along with everything else the Bush crew has done,
&gt;just isn't enough for them. What Bush and his people really seek, at
&gt;bottom, is to destroy the basic definition and literal existence of
&gt;reality itself. They want to destroy reality, rebuild it according to
&gt;their own blueprint, so the sum and substance of this new reality will
&gt;accept as axiomatic the idea that lying, stealing and wholesale
&gt;carnage are badges of integrity and moral clarity. In other words, our
&gt;comprehensively understood reality today would be replaced by whatever
&gt;madcap anti-reality currently exists within the walls of 1600
&gt;Pennsylvania Avenue.

&gt;    I warned you.

&gt;    As bad as that chaotically crossbred joke/rant/mantra thing is, it
&gt;wasn't meant to be anything other than a harmless sliver of wordplay,
&gt;something that settled my nerves and gave me a private little chuckle
&gt;- that alone, and nothing more.

&gt;    Things are different now. It isn't a joke anymore, at least not to
&gt;me. The premise that the Bush administration has literally been trying
&gt;to shatter elemental reality on planet Earth has steadily gained
&gt;traction in my mind. It started as that sort-of joke, then it became
&gt;an idea, and then it became an actual hypothesis, a working theory
&gt;requiring research and evidence and argument so that, someday, I can
&gt;prove it to be an unassailable bone-basic truth.

&gt;    And yes, the fact that I'm quite serious about this has me quietly
&gt;yet legitimately concerned for my own mental health. What worries me
&gt;the most, however, is a freshly minted suspicion that it is already
&gt;over, that the deal already went down, but almost nobody actually
&gt;noticed when it happened. I think these Bush folks may have
&gt;successfully pulled it off right in front of our noses over the course
&gt;of this past August. I think they may have actually broken reality,
&gt;cobbling together a chaotic replacement, and I think I can back up
&gt;that supposition all the way down the block and back again.

&gt;    Bear with me.

&gt;    The process began in earnest more than a year ago with a publicity
&gt;campaign that deliberately made no sense whatsoever. Day after day,
&gt;statements and declarations came from all manner of White House
&gt;officials that were little more than bags of over-the-moon nonsense -
&gt;all patently inaccurate to nine decimals, yet spoken shamelessly into
&gt;cameras with bare faces hanging out.

&gt;    With this, the Bush folks laid the mental foundation of the new
&gt;reality to come; that foundation had to transmute lies into facts
&gt;while still stuck in the old reality, but they had an edge that may
&gt;have proven decisive: trust. If the American people hear the White
&gt;House repeatedly claim that water is not wet and Godzilla is real,
&gt;many of those Americans will believe it after a fashion.

&gt;    The rumored totality of America's cynical scorn for politics and
&gt;leaders notwithstanding, this country has many citizens who still
&gt;believe, even after what has happened, that if the president of the
&gt;United States says it, then it must be true. This isn't a conscious
&gt;thing; it happens way back in the slushy part of the brain, where
&gt;unpleasant facts or disquieting fears are submerged and drowned like
&gt;rats in an applesauce vat. Bush and his crew counted on that, using TV
&gt;news messaging to furrow the field in preparation for seeding time,
&gt;and their trust in the trust of Americans was shown to be well-placed.

&gt;    When the serious push came, it came fast and furious. Dick Cheney
&gt;declared that the Vice President's office no longer existed within the
&gt;Executive branch because he didn't want to give any of his documents
&gt;to the National Archives as is required by law, and actually went on
&gt;to defend the legitimacy of his astonishing, arrogant, galactically
&gt;mistaken declaration, and he got away with it.

&gt;    Bush's lawyers put forth a claim of Executive Privilege that was
&gt;the very living essence of overheated hubris run amok - a claim that
&gt;for all intents and purposes declared Bush and his people to be fully
&gt;and completely above the rule of law, and he got away with it.
&gt;Subpoenas issued by Congress were either utterly ignored or smugly
&gt;slapped aside, and the lawyers got away with it.

&gt;    Another piece of draconian surveillance legislation aimed at
&gt;shattering our remaining rights arrived in Congress, so the Bush folks
&gt;brazenly bullied the majority into passing it by threatening to blame
&gt;them for the next terrorist attack to come, whereupon the majority
&gt;instantly wilted like orchids in a snowbank, the bill passed with room
&gt;to spare, and once again they got away with it.

&gt;    Cheney's chief of staff was convicted for lying about lying about
&gt;lying about outing a deep-cover CIA agent and sentenced to federal
&gt;prison, initiating the single most observably crooked bag-job in
&gt;modern political history: Libby took the bullet for his boss, got
&gt;rewarded for his service with a presidential get-out-of-jail-free
&gt;card, and they all got away with it.

&gt;    All of this was deployed in rapid succession, presenting the
&gt;American people with a sudden feast of gibberish that has redefined
&gt;incoherence across the board: the VP is not in the executive branch,
&gt;and the executive branch is above the law, and the majority in
&gt;Congress is actually the minority, and obstructing justice to protect
&gt;Cheney from being prosecuted for annihilating a CIA operative isn't
&gt;anything to get in a snit about. If that is not prima facie evidence
&gt;that a new reality has been imposed upon us, then I don't know what

&gt;all patently inaccurate to nine decimals, yet spoken shamelessly into
&gt;cameras with bare faces hanging out.

&gt;    With this, the Bush folks laid the mental foundation of the new
&gt;reality to come; that foundation had to transmute lies into facts
&gt;while still stuck in the old reality, but they had an edge that may
&gt;have proven decisive: trust. If the American people hear the White
&gt;House repeatedly claim that water is not wet and Godzilla is real,
&gt;many of those Americans will believe it after a fashion.

&gt;    The rumored totality of America's cynical scorn for politics and
&gt;leaders notwithstanding, this country has many citizens who still
&gt;believe, even after what has happened, that if the president of the
&gt;United States says it, then it must be true. This isn't a conscious
&gt;thing; it happens way back in the slushy part of the brain, where
&gt;unpleasant facts or disquieting fears are submerged and drowned like
&gt;rats in an applesauce vat. Bush and his crew counted on that, using TV
&gt;news messaging to furrow the field in preparation for seeding time,
&gt;and their trust in the trust of Americans was shown to be well-placed.

&gt;    When the serious push came, it came fast and furious. Dick Cheney
&gt;declared that the Vice President's office no longer existed within the
&gt;Executive branch because he didn't want to give any of his documents
&gt;to the National Archives as is required by law, and actually went on
&gt;to defend the legitimacy of his astonishing, arrogant, galactically
&gt;mistaken declaration, and he got away with it.

&gt;    Bush's lawyers put forth a claim of Executive Privilege that was
&gt;the very living essence of overheated hubris run amok - a claim that
&gt;for all intents and purposes declared Bush and his people to be fully
&gt;and completely above the rule of law, and he got away with it.
&gt;Subpoenas issued by Congress were either utterly ignored or smugly
&gt;slapped aside, and the lawyers got away with it.

&gt;    Another piece of draconian surveillance legislation aimed at
&gt;shattering our remaining rights arrived in Congress, so the Bush folks
&gt;brazenly bullied the majority into passing it by threatening to blame
&gt;them for the next terrorist attack to come, whereupon the majority
&gt;instantly wilted like orchids in a snowbank, the bill passed with room
&gt;to spare, and once again they got away with it.

&gt;    Cheney's chief of staff was convicted for lying about lying about
&gt;lying about outing a deep-cover CIA agent and sentenced to federal
&gt;prison, initiating the single most observably crooked bag-job in
&gt;modern political history: Libby took the bullet for his boss, got
&gt;rewarded for his service with a presidential get-out-of-jail-free
&gt;card, and they all got away with it.

&gt;    All of this was deployed in rapid succession, presenting the
&gt;American people with a sudden feast of gibberish that has redefined
&gt;incoherence across the board: the VP is not in the executive branch,
&gt;and the executive branch is above the law, and the majority in
&gt;Congress is actually the minority, and obstructing justice to protect
&gt;Cheney from being prosecuted for annihilating a CIA operative isn't
&gt;anything to get in a snit about. If that is not prima facie evidence
&gt;that a new reality has been imposed upon us, then I don't know what
&gt;is.

&gt;    After all that came August, and if I'm right, the process was
&gt;brought to a successful conclusion. In a way, this was the greatest
&gt;challenge for Bush and his people, because they all had to argue time
&gt;and again that Iraq was doing fine, that the whole thing was about
&gt;freedom, that there was no civil war, that the &quot;surge&quot; worked, that
&gt;the American people truly supported the whole bloody carnivorous
&gt;process, and be damned with poll numbers and pundits and contradictory
&gt;facts. General Petraeus was rolled out on cue, he hummed his bars and
&gt;faked it at the same time, and as far as the mainstream press was
&gt;concerned, the White House won the argument and that's that.

&gt;    Think about it. The weapons of mass destruction were not there,
&gt;connections to 9/11 and Osama bin Laden were not there, the hearts and
&gt;flowers were not there, thousands upon thousands have been killed,
&gt;billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars have been translated into

&gt;   I May Have Gone Insane
&gt;    By William Rivers Pitt
&gt;    t r u t h o u t | Columnist
&gt;    Wednesday 19 September 2007
&gt;    We dance round in a ring and suppose,
&gt;    But the Secret sits in the middle and knows.
&gt;    - Robert Frost, &quot;The Secret Sits&quot;

&gt;    It is a legitimately demented phenomenon, all the more so because
&gt;it all started with a joke. Not even a funny joke, either, but a sad
&gt;and threadbare thing I told only to myself, and no one else. When the
&gt;clustered elements of our collective national burden erupted in
&gt;masterfully synchronized bedlam, as they so often seem to, I had that
&gt;joke to tell myself, and it may not have helped much, but it was
&gt;there.

&gt;    Every time another cacophony of freshly minted lunacy was
&gt;unleashed - lunacy regarding Iraq, the NSA domestic surveillance
&gt;program, White House defiance of subpoenas, timorously flaccid
&gt;performances by the Congressional majority, or merely when enduring
&gt;the repeated &quot;nukyalur&quot;-ized butchery of public political rhetoric was
&gt;required by my employers, all of which emphatically pegged the needle
&gt;on my Pandemoni-O-Meter - I had that joke to tell myself.

&gt;    The joke is spherically terrible, i.e. bad in every possible
&gt;direction in three dimensions and across 360 rounded degrees. It isn't
&gt;even a joke, really, which may be why it went so abruptly and
&gt;bewilderingly sideways on me months ago. The joke, to be
&gt;embarrassingly honest, is more like some half-bright mantra than
&gt;anything else. As I came to discover, however, it managed to settle my
&gt;mind when the needle was in the red. Perhaps the thing is best
&gt;described as my self-generated Zen koan; though it did not actually
&gt;stop my mind in proper koan fashion, it kept me from putting my head
&gt;through the wall, and that made it valuable indeed.

&gt;    The joke: people say Bush and his people want to raze the core
&gt;nature of the country itself by wrecking the Constitution, and they're
&gt;correct. People say Bush and his people are enriching their friends
&gt;beyond dreams of avarice at our actual expense, by way of war-inflated
&gt;oil prices; war-captured Iraqi oil infrastructure; the orgiastic
&gt;plunder of Treasury money through calamitously unsound tax cuts for
&gt;Bush's pals; and through an Iraq war profiteering scam so unutterably
&gt;corrupt that it bends the very light. That, and more besides, is what
&gt;people say, and they're correct.

&gt;    But all that, along with everything else the Bush crew has done,
&gt;just isn't enough for them. What Bush and his people really seek, at
&gt;bottom, is to destroy the basic definition and literal existence of
&gt;reality itself. They want to destroy reality, rebuild it according to
&gt;their own blueprint, so the sum and substance of this new reality will
&gt;accept as axiomatic the idea that lying, stealing and wholesale
&gt;carnage are badges of integrity and moral clarity. In other words, our
&gt;comprehensively understood reality today would be replaced by whatever
&gt;madcap anti-reality currently exists within the walls of 1600
&gt;Pennsylvania Avenue.

&gt;    I warned you.

&gt;    As bad as that chaotically crossbred joke/rant/mantra thing is, it
&gt;wasn't meant to be anything other than a harmless sliver of wordplay,
&gt;something that settled my nerves and gave me a private little chuckle
&gt;- that alone, and nothing more.

&gt;    Things are different now. It isn't a joke anymore, at least not to
&gt;me. The premise that the Bush administration has literally been trying
&gt;to shatter elemental reality on planet Earth has steadily gained
&gt;traction in my mind. It started as that sort-of joke, then it became
&gt;an idea, and then it became an actual hypothesis, a working theory
&gt;requiring research and evidence and argument so that, someday, I can
&gt;prove it to be an unassailable bone-basic truth.

&gt;    And yes, the fact that I'm quite serious about this has me quietly
&gt;yet legitimately concerned for my own mental health. What worries me
&gt;the most, however, is a freshly minted suspicion that it is already
&gt;over, that the deal already went down, but almost nobody actually
&gt;noticed when it happened. I think these Bush folks may have
&gt;successfully pulled it off right in front of our noses over the course
&gt;of this past August. I think they may have actually broken reality,
&gt;cobbling together a chaotic replacement, and I think I can back up
&gt;that supposition all the way down the block and back again.

&gt;    Bear with me.

&gt;    The process began in earnest more than a year ago with a publicity
&gt;campaign that deliberately made no sense whatsoever. Day after day,
&gt;statements and declarations came from all manner of White House
&gt;officials that were little more than bags of over-the-moon nonsense -
&gt;all patently inaccurate to nine decimals, yet spoken shamelessly into
&gt;cameras with bare faces hanging out.

&gt;    With this, the Bush folks laid the mental foundation of the new
&gt;reality to come; that foundation had to transmute lies into facts
&gt;while still stuck in the old reality, but they had an edge that may

&gt;    And they got away with it. If that is reality, I want no part of
&gt;it.

&gt;    It must be clearly understood, however, that I do not discount the
&gt;very real possibility that I have, finally and for all time, gone
&gt;insane because of all this. My theory is not proven beyond doubt; my
&gt;suspicions grow stronger by the hour, but I could simply be this
&gt;barking madman no longer able to recognize reality even when it is
&gt;staring me in the eye. I'm pretty sure of my footing, but the truth is
&gt;that if I did go over the high side somewhere
