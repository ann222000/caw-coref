*How Nigeria Can Survive*

By Moses Ochonu

Nigeriavillagesquare, an online news, commentary, and discussion forum
recently organized a call-in webcast around the theme of being positive
about Nigeria. I called into it to share my thoughts on Nigeria and came
away deeply impressed with the persistence of the Nigerian idea even among
the critics of Nigeria's defective structural composition. It was a
profoundly enriching experience—one that has caused me to contemplate more
seriously one aspect of the discussion.

One of the panelists, my good friend, Rudolf Okonkwo, asked a question that
goes to the heart of every discussion on the viability of Nigeria as a
nation-state. He wanted to know if there has been any country in
history—African or not—that experienced the same challenges of nationhood
that Nigerian has been grappling with and came out of it intact, with its
spatial integrity and tropes of nationhood secure. It is a question that
invites deep reflection on the meaning, trajectory, and evolution of
nationhood itself. In one poignant question, Rudolf insinuated into our
discussion the knotty contradiction of simultaneously celebrating Nigeria
and acknowledging its seeming temporariness.

Britain approximates the example of a country that has overcome centuries of
turbulence, political uncertainties, and structural indeterminacy to forge a
pragmatic, workable, if tense, union. Britain is our colonizing power and it
is ironic that one would advance it as a prototype of a troubled but
functional political union. But the parallels between British political
history and Nigeria's are as remarkable as the differences between the two
countries.

The British have not always been a coherent, organic nation. In many ways,
they are still not; ask many Irish and, to some extent, Scots and they will
tell you that Britain is an imposition that hardly approximates their
aspirations for nationhood. For a long time, the idea of Great Britain was
neither great nor even British. The British were first seen as British by
others before they saw themselves as such. As is the case with Nigeria,
there is nothing natural about Britain—or about any nation for that matter.
Yet, somehow, Britain is a nation that works for its constituents.

A small, vulnerable Island, Britain was invaded and ruled for many centuries
by the Romans. The &quot;pagan&quot; Saxons invaded in the 5th century from the Nordic
plains. It was the commingling of the Saxons and autochthonous English that
produced the compound ethnic category of Anglo-Saxons, which some people
today take for granted as the foundational ethnicity of England. Even this
process was marked by vicious, bloody wars between factions of the Saxon
invaders and between them and the English states and kingdoms on the Island.
The wars between the English kingdoms and Saxon invaders were as much over
differences in religion and culture as they were over territory.

Britain knew neither peace nor a discernible geopolitical trajectory for the
next six centuries. The French invaded in the 11th century, grafting yet
another cultural influence and complex onto the Anglo-Saxon tradition.

Also inhabiting parts of the same Island were the Welsh and the Irish. Both
were fiercely anti-English in their ways.

Given this ethno-linguistic and religious chaos, a nation seemed impossible
to imagine, let alone build.

When the French withdrew or were defeated (depending on which version of the
history you believe), the momentary political unity that coalesced in the
struggle against French imperialism was replaced by a retreat to the
animosities and divisions of old. I have, of course, taken some liberties
with British history here but the outline is basically correct.

In fact, the British, like Nigerians, could never agree among themselves
about which political system or national religion to adopt—or whether to
adopt a national religion at all. Oliver Cromwell's effort to settle these
questions through an anti-monarchist revolution plunged Britain into a civil
war. Britain is still a country divided about the role and influence of the
monarchy, and by the Catholic-Protestant divide which is a direct result of
its encounters with Roman Catholicism and the European Reformation.

The parallels between Nigeria and Britain are instructive. Like Britain,
Nigeria was colonized. Nigerians, like Britons, share a common memory of
resisting foreign colonial invaders and of being oppressed by these
invaders. Like Britain, the nation-space called Nigeria was by and large
bequeathed by, and consummated through the self-interested actions of,
foreign invaders and imperial powers. Like the British, Nigerians argue
eternally about what form of government to adopt to satisfy most of the
country's constituents. Like the British, Nigerians argue about how to
structure the relationship between the various ethno-national regions that
constitutes the country.

Like Britain, which is effectively a confederacy of several nations—Ireland,
Wales, Scotland, and England—Nigeria is a country of many nations, with each
one striving to define its relationship to the tenuous symbols of Nigerian
nationhood—and to maintain its residual cultural and political autonomy in
the face of an increasingly unitary Nigerian government.

Like the British, Nigerians argue about whether to adopt a national religion
and about whether the Nigerian state can or should remain a neutral arbiter
in religious matters. The Catholic-Protestant debate in Britain is just as
volatile and as occasionally bloody as the Christian-Muslim divide in
Nigeria.

Like Britain, Nigeria fought a devastating civil war. Britain actually
fought several civil wars throughout its history. The passionate rejection
of the &quot;imposition&quot; called Britain by some Irish and Scots is strikingly
similar to the repudiation of the &quot;Nigerian imposition&quot; by many segments of
the Nigerian populace, especially constituents like the Niger Delta and the
Igbo whose sacrifice for Nigeria clearly outweigh their rewards and
investments in it.

Like Nigerians, Britons received a defective national contraption that was
designed more by the interests of a succession of external invaders than by
the interests and aspirations of Britons. The British colonizers crafted
Nigeria purely to fulfill a British imperial administrative and economic
imperative. The African peoples who would constitute the nation had no say
in its emergence. Nigeria, in short, emerged outside and in spite of the
multiple nationalist aspirations of Nigeria's many nations, just as Britain
emerged largely outside the free volition of, and even against, the
aspirations of many Britons.

Yet the British overcame these historical and preexisting handicaps to build
themselves a workable union that, however imperfectly, offers more belonging
to its constituent units than it alienates them. The British decided to use
the outline of the received &quot;foreign&quot; imposition to evolve a new
nation-state that could unite Anglo-Saxons, Welsh, and Irish in one diverse
commonwealth of mutually shared symbols and aspirations. They did this so
well that not only did they build a great nation; they used it as a linchpin
to conquer almost half of the entire world. You can't go out to conquer and
colonize other nations if you are not a nation yourself.

How did Britain do this and what lessons can Nigeria learn from its
experience?

It is my considered opinion that the British first made one crucial
decision: to be pragmatic about their nation building. They decided not to
destroy Welsh, Irish, English, or Scot identities and autonomies in the
process of evolving a British nation-state. They didn't see these national
identities and aspirations as enemies of the emerging British nation; they
saw them as essential components of Britain. This is a crucial difference
between Britain and Nigeria.

It was a sound premise from which the idea of a new, representative
Britain sprouted and won adherents. The British adopted a political
structure that allowed each people to hold on to practices, cultures,
institutions, resources, and developmental aspirations that are dear to
them. But they all came together under the Union Jack and the Crown to
transact political businesses that were mutually beneficial. One of these
businesses was that of empire-building and colonization. There was something
in it for everyone. The impoverished Irish needed jobs and economic
lifelines and were all too happy to be sent to govern colonized territories
in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean on behalf of the British crown.

The Welsh, English, and Scots fulfilled their business and missionary
aspirations by serving as Christian missionaries and traders/extractors of
raw materials in the colonies. Some people argue that the &quot;dominant&quot; English
offloaded the Irish to the colonies to uproot a growing Irish disavowal of
the &quot;British imposition.&quot; This may be true, but the Irish were eager to
represent the crown in the colonies because they felt British enough to do
so, and because they craved the benefits and recognition of Britishness.

Whatever its faults then, the British nation represents a pragmatic model of
nationhood. It recognizes that, for a nation to work, its constituents have
to see it as beneficial to their interests and aspirations while not
perceiving it as a threat to their way of life. The British Empire and its
attractions is no more, but more Britons still believe in Britain than those
who do not. This is because the foundational principle of cultural, fiscal,
and political autonomy and of inclusion remains intact.

Some segments of the Irish and some Scots will continue to call for the
dissolution of Britain but the overwhelming majority will continue to
believe that they have more invested in the British project than they are
willing to give up.

The lessons for Nigeria here are many.

First, no nation is a given. A nation is what the people who desire it make
of it. The British inherited a defective union, but they worked at it until
it became fairly workable. Unlike Nigeria, they did not do this by becoming
more unitary and more homogenizing. They did it by allowing the expression
of the nationalist autonomies that predated the idea of Britain. Homogeneity
followed logically as a voluntary pragmatic process which saw Irish, Scots,
and Welsh assimilate in various degrees into English culture. Although today
some Britons decry what they see as English cultural and linguistic
imperialism over the rest of Britain, it is generally not a deep felt
sentiment that threatens to tear the country apart.

For a nation to survive it must mean more than a concept to its constituent
units; it must approximate their interests and aspirations while allowing
them considerable autonomy over fiscal, cultural, and political affairs. The
British made Britain such a nation. Nigeria's solution, on the other hand,
has been to homogenize everyone into a shared national ethos underwritten by
a unitary political system that brooks no centrifugal agitation. This
approach doesn't work. It is counterproductive.

Second, nations, as Benedict Anderson posits, are imagined communities, not
natural occurrences. You work to build a nation-state; you don't take it for
granted. If you desire a nation, you have to work hard at it. Nations are
therefore being constantly re-imagined to remain relevant to the evolving
aspirations and interests of their constituents. This should be especially
true for Nigeria, which was set up since independence to function not for
its constituent units but for the interest of a small multi-ethnic political
collective. This is the reason why I find the expression &quot;the unity of
Nigeria is non-negotiable&quot; ludicrous and dangerous.  Only documented divine
revelations like the Bible and the Quran are settled, non-negotiable
subjects. Even those are subject to diverse interpretations. How much less a
nation that was conceived and created by a foreign European power without
the consultative or deliberative input of Nigeria's peoples.

On the face of it the rhetoric of non-negotiability sounds lofty. But it is
actually quite dangerous. It forecloses the process of nation-building in
its proper sense of crafting and recrafting a nation until it is acceptable,
however tentatively, to its constituents. It forecloses the tweaking of the
union to make it relevant to the aspirations of those who constitute it. It
is tyrannical in the sense that it forces those who do not or no longer
believe in Nigeria to refrain from imagining alternatives or creative
structural solutions to the dysfunctional status quo. It also impels
believers in the Nigerian project into a complacency that prevents them from
appreciating the ways in which many constituencies are being alienated from
the project.

What's more, it dismisses and demonizes the separatist agitations of
ethno-nationalist  pressure groups instead of celebrating them for, if
nothing else, serving to remind us of what is wrong with the union.
Separatist agitations are, contrary to popular perception, instruments of
nation-building; for they reflect legitimate disaffection and
disillusionment with the union and should be taken seriously as a point of
departure for at the very least reforming the nation's political
arrangement. Unlike Britain, we do not brook discourses of secession and
separation. The British not only tolerate such discourses; they use them to
remind themselves of how hard they need to work to preserve their troubled
union.

Third, a nation will never be a final product, being constantly remade in
the interests of its constituents, but a nation has to *work* to be relevant
and to endure. The difference between Nigeria and Britain is not that
Britain is more coherent or more of a nation than Nigeria is. The difference
is that Britain *works* for its constituent ethno-nations—however
imperfectly—and Nigeria does not.

The British national idea was partly forged in the crucible of external
aggression and British empire-building. Nigeria does not need to invade or
be invaded to craft a workable Nigerian union. We should do the other thing
the British did: be pragmatic in our nationalist aspirations. That would
entail the difficult decision of doing away with the de facto unitary
composition of Nigeria. It is founded on an erroneous view of nations as
incubators of sameness and homogeneity.

The Irish, Welsh, English, and Scots are free to dream and aspire relatively
independently of one another while sharing geo-national symbols, loose
central government, and a common memory of external oppression.  This is a
model for Nigeria. Like the British, we are diverse. But as the British did,
we should use our common memory of colonial oppression as a basis for
(re)negotiating a union that *works* and is acceptable and meaningful to
Nigeria's many constituents.
