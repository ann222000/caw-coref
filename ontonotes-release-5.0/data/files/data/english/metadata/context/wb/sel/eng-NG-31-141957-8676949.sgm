Does such a thing actually exist?

And, if so, where can I download it?

There's been a blurry video circulating the internet for years, from before
she turned eighteen, of somebody who might be her, but probably isn't,
giving a double blow job.  I have no idea where it can be found, but you
might try Limewire or one of the groups dedicated to the topic of sharing
celebrity videos.

Yeah, I've seen that before.

I'm looking for the one she supposedly made with K-Fed.

Has it made it to the Internet yet?

Is it even real?

It might be real, but if it is, it was effectively suppressed early in
their divorce proceedings, when Federline was trying unsuccessfully to
use it to extort his wife for a better settlement.  Maybe somebody has
seen it, but if Britney has any brains, she has destroyed it by now, and
I doubt that it will ever turn up.
