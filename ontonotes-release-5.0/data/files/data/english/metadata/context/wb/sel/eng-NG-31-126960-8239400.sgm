Not just *knew* him, but *discovered* him and she said that he was one
of the strongest dancers she had ever known.  She lost her last shred
of credibility with that one.

When she made the offer to Cedric, I didn't catch her wording, but it
sounded like she was offering to teach him for free, but last night
she said that he has a scholarship and that two people she named are
*sponsoring* him. So, she still gets her revenue. What a giver.

Her involvement in this show needs to be restricted to pulling people
from the auditions that she wants to come join her troupe and that's
it. She adds nothing of value.

What ever happened to Dan Karaty? After the first couple of weeks, he
never appeared as a judge OR a choreographer. He at least offered
constructive critiques.

He always looks like a kid in a too-big suit, sitting on a booster
seat, but at least he doesn't gush over the dancers. Just because it's
all viewer votes now doesn't mean the judges can't judge.

With all four being so good, we need some guidance to separate them. I
was showing my DH the tango that Neil and Lauren did weeks ago (he's
suddenly interested because Neil is from our hometown) and he liked
it, but when Mary described what was off about it, even my DH
understood what she was talking about.  That's helpful.  Debbie Allen
and her, &quot;Chile, that's the way ah like it!&quot; tells us nothing.

Yeah, I read about that. I wonder if his absence was pre-planned
(working on other projects) or if that incident caused him to pull
away from the show or TPTB to not want to use him as much.  Since he
is a recognized face, his appearance on the finale may have already
been agreed upon, or maybe things have smoothed over.

Actually, I read that Dan was also upset with Robson; after all, it
appeared that the concept was Robson's idea. Who knows, though, maybe
TPTB asked him to come up with a routine with this theme.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Funny you should mention him.
&gt;&gt;&gt;He's the guest judge tomorrow.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't care for him much, he seems like a bit of a weenie.

&gt;&gt;He always looks like a kid in a too-big suit, sitting on a booster
&gt;&gt;seat, but at least he doesn't gush over the dancers. Just because it's
&gt;&gt;all viewer votes now doesn't mean the judges can't judge.

&gt;&gt;With all four being so good, we need some guidance to separate them. I
&gt;&gt;was showing my DH the tango that Neil and Lauren did weeks ago (he's
&gt;&gt;suddenly interested because Neil is from our hometown) and he liked
&gt;&gt;it, but when Mary described what was off about it, even my DH
&gt;&gt;understood what she was talking about.  That's helpful.  Debbie Allen
&gt;&gt;and her, &quot;Chile, that's the way ah like it!&quot; tells us nothing.

&gt;&gt;KC

&gt; Yeah, when you look past her screams, Mary has a lot of knowledge.

I definitely pay attention to her ballroom critiques because I know so
little about it other than what I got from DWTS. The contemporary I can
judge for myself, and hip-hop...ummm, don't much care.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;CatNipped

&gt;&gt; &gt;Not just *knew* him, but *discovered* him and she said that he was one
&gt;&gt; &gt;of the strongest dancers she had ever known.  She lost her last shred
&gt;&gt; &gt;of credibility with that one.

&gt;&gt; &gt;When she made the offer to Cedric, I didn't catch her wording, but it
&gt;&gt; &gt;sounded like she was offering to teach him for free, but last night
&gt;&gt; &gt;she said that he has a scholarship and that two people she named are
&gt;&gt; &gt;*sponsoring* him. So, she still gets her revenue. What a giver.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Her involvement in this show needs to be restricted to pulling people
&gt;&gt; &gt;from the auditions that she wants to come join her troupe and that's
&gt;&gt; &gt;it. She adds nothing of value.

&gt;&gt; &gt;What ever happened to Dan Karaty? After the first couple of weeks, he
&gt;&gt; &gt;never appeared as a judge OR a choreographer. He at least offered
&gt;&gt; &gt;constructive critiques.

KC, let's be fair:

Debbie Allen's school is a non-profit. That in and of itself makes her a
giver.

The school benefits (or doesn't) based upon it's income, which comes by
way of tuition fees or charitable contributions, tax breaks, falling
snow, or most likely a combination of all. But she shouldn't have to
forgo an income just so you can determine how generous and giving she
may be. Donors and contributors are what support non-profits.

Cedric, like many students will face incidentals required during the
term their study: housing, meals, books and supplies, transportation
costs, industry-related incidental costs. Is it your contention that a
Not-for-profit organization Allen absorb all ? Are there plenty of
students that have earned scholarships that still need help?

Well, that's not always true.  In her case, she founded the school for
lots of great reasons, but she gets some non-tangibles out of it, too,
I'm sure.

Not everybody who works for one is all that &quot;charitable.&quot; Some people
use their positions in a high-profile non-profits to gain exposure to
lead to other things. Some people, shocker, don't even believe in the
particular cause; it's just a job.

I worked for a nonprofit for years. I get how they work.  Of course
she shouldn't have to forgo an income, but that doesn't mean she can't
forgo fees for a certain number of students. I'm not suggesting that
she stop collecting an income, but her incolme from appearances might
allow her to cover all the fees and expenses for a certain number of
special students. Her remarks about Cedric's talent gave me the
impression that she thought of him as being worthy of that level of
special consideration.

No, that's not my contention.  Debbie made a big deal of telling
Cedric that she was inviting him to attend her school. I assumed that
meant that he didn't have to audition and that she was either waiving
the tuition or arranging for whatever aide he needed. Fine. Great.

My beef was that she felt she had to reveal what those financial
arrangements were, which was none of our business. She stated that he
was starting classes in the fall or something and that was all we
needed to know about it.  She could have plugged the school by saying
that if anyone would like to sponsor a dancer, or hel defray the cost
of a student's travel or housing expenses, they could check out her
website.

But, she started talking about how two people were sponsoring Cedric
and covering his expenses, etc. and it came off, to me, like she was
saying, &quot;He can come to my school, but that's as far as I'm going to
go.&quot;

I'm NOT saying she has any obligation to do this for ANY dancer, but
I'm also not the one who told her to make what appeared to be an
extremely generous offer and then start explaining the fine print.

You know those store coupons that say 50% OFF!!! Then in small print,
say, &quot;not valid on watches, jewelry, designer clothing, cosmetics,
fine china, furniture, men's suits, salon services, Nautica
sportswear, Liz Claiborne, or specially priced items&quot;  Oh, so I can
use it to buy a $10 pack of white t-shirts. Thanks for the generous
offer.

I have no &quot;beef&quot; with Debbie Allen. I liked her back in the day, but
she has offered nothing of substance to SYTYCD. I'm not the only
person here who has said that.

I like Cedric just fine. I said nothing negative about him. I think he
has natural talent and will probably do well with training, since he
showed great improvement when taught by professionals during his time
on the show.

Back pedaling? I implied the first time, and I reiterated the second
time, that I felt Debbie Allen was self-serving. Other people here saw
what I saw in her &quot;offer&quot;.

Now, my question to you is this: provided Debbie Allen did just that as
you described to plug the school, how would it make any difference?
Unless the audience and viewers were in a coma, wouldn't they deduce
that's what must have happened in Cedric's case?

As far as what we needed to know, that's only your opinion. Not saying
it's wrong, just not committing it to hard fast rule. As you are aware
of how not-for-profits work, you needn't be reminded that it is the
donor who determines based on their own motives if and how they want
their gift acknowledged or if they prefer being anonymous.

Since you mentioned it, what is it that you see that she should have
been doing? To bring more substance that is. I'd really like to know.
And &quot;not being there&quot; doesn't count.

Yes, back pedaling. You hadn't given consideration at all to the fact
that Debbie Allen represented a not-for-profit organization.
Other people? They don't remember anymore than you. I wouldn't go
garnering support from them until it's understood what you &quot;saw&quot; (as
