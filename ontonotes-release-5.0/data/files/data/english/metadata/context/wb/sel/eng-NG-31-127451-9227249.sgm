Mormon's frequently dismiss Darwinian evolution science as being no
more of a threat to Mormonism than to other churches such as the
Catholics and Protestants, for example. But is that true? Here's an
article that says it isn't true and, in fact, refers to Mormons as the
world's preeminent creationists. Here's an excerpt:

The official statement of the Mormon church on the origin of the earth
and life is in Moses chapter 2 and Abraham chapter 4 in the Pearl of
Great Price. The Pearl of Great Price is one of Mormonism's standard
works. It is held by the Mormon church and its leaders as revelation
from god, and official church doctrine. Chapter 2 is supposedly a
revelation from god to Joseph Smith describing how god created the
earth, and life on it. Chapter 4 basically repeats chapter 2, with
some minor modifications. The heading for chapter 2 reads &quot;As revealed
to Joseph Smith the Prophet, in December, 1830. The first verse reads
&quot;And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moses saying: Behold, I
reveal unto you concerning the heaven, and this earth; write the words
which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by
mine only Begotten I created these things; yea, in the beginning I
created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou standest.&quot;

So much for the oft-asserted claim by Mormon apologists, that their
prophets never claimed to have communicated with god about how the
earth and life were created. Please note that the creation story in
the Pearl of Great Price was supposedly a direct revelation from god
to Joseph Smith depicting a tutorial between god and Moses on the
creation of this earth. Not surprisingly Joseph Smith's creation story
is a modified plagiarism of the Hebrew creation myth found in the
Bible. I have listed some of the claims of this official version
below.

1. According to official Mormon doctrine, god created grass, herb
yielding seeds, and fruit trees on day three (see verses 11-13). Then
he created the sun on the fourth day (see verses 14-19). [Have Mormons
ever wondered how these plants survived without the sun?].

2. According to official Mormon doctrine, god created the earth and
dry land on day three (Moses 2: 9-13) and then created the sun and
moon on day four. According to the best theories of how the solar
system formed, the sun formed first. The planets formed later in the
solar system's development through a gradual process of accumulation.
Here, in Joseph Smith's fanciful fairy tail, we have an earth complete
with grass and fruiting trees before the sun is made. Furthermore, the
implication seems clear enough that god created the stars on the same
day he created the sun and moon (Moses 2:16; 3:1, Abraham 4:16). The
best theories of the moon's creation have it being formed when a
planetesimal impacted with the early earth. This likely happened
before any life evolved on earth, and most certainly would have killed
any life on earth that had been &quot;created&quot; in the out-of-sequence story
we find in the Pearl of Great Price. The idea that the stars were
created after the earth is, of course ludicrous. The best scientific
evidence has the earth being formed partially from the heavy elements
that can only be created in a super Nova. [For a good introductory
explanation of the formation of the solar system, earth, and life, I
highly recommend The History of Earth by William K. Hartmann and Ron
Miller].

3. According to official Mormon doctrine, god created water animals,
whales, and birds on the fifth day (Moses 2:20-22) and then created
land animals such as cattle on the sixth day (Moses 2:24-31).
According to the theory of evolution, birds evolved from land animals,
as did whales. In Joseph Smith's &quot;revelation&quot;, however, we have god
creating whales and birds before creating land animals.

Joseph repeated his creation myth in Abraham chapter 4. In this
account, he has the &quot;god's&quot; creating grass and fruiting trees on the
third &quot;time&quot;, and then the sun and moon during the fourth &quot;time&quot; (see
Abraham 4:9-19). Again, Joseph has the &quot;god's&quot; creating whales and
fishes on the fifth &quot;time&quot;, along with birds (Abraham 4:20-23) and
then cattle and other land animals on the sixth &quot;time&quot;, along with man
(Abraham 4:24-31).

Mormons are the world's preeminent creationists. Other religions can
waft away the Hebrew creation myth in the Bible as being allegorical,
figurative, or simply borrowed from the Babylonians. Mormons could, if
they chose, discount the Genesis account as a bastardized version long
since corrupted by many translations. However, the Pearl of Great
Price does not afford Mormonism any of these luxuries. Here in the
book of Moses and the book of Abraham we find a personal tutorial from
god to Joseph Smith describing the earth's formation and the creation
of life. No millennia of translations. No corruption from the church
of the devil. Just pure revelation from god to the founder of
Mormonism. If Mormonism is true, then the creation account in the
Pearl of Great Price should be verified by science. That Joseph's
creation account is diametrically opposed to the best physical
evidence is one of the best proofs I know that he was not inspired of
god.

After you finish with the Pearl of Great Price, get a copy of &quot;Mormon
Doctrine&quot; by Bruce McConkie. (Some individuals in the Mormon church
view McConkie as a fallen prophet, but most do not. &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;
contains only a small fraction of the quotes I'm providing here.)
McConkie, by the way was sustained in general conference, along with
other members of the Mormon &quot;council of twelve apostles&quot; as a prophet,
seer, and revelator. To see just how significant this is in Mormon
theology, read chapter 8 of Mosiah in the Book of Mormon. Mormons
believe that through their seers &quot;all things [shall] be revealed.&quot;
Most Mormons regard this book as an authoritative source of
information about Mormon church doctrine. Look up the section on
evolution, science, geology, and astronomy. In case you don't have a
copy, or access to one, here are a few quotes:

&quot;There is no harmony between the truths of revealed religion and the
theories of organic evolution.&quot; [page 256].

&quot;Evolutionary theories assume that hundreds of millions of years were
involved, first in the creation of the earth as a habitable globe, and
again in the evolution of spontaneously generated, single celled forms
of life into the complex and multitudinous forms of life now found on
its face. We have rather specific scriptural indications that the
creative period was of relatively short duration.&quot; [page 255].

&quot;There were no pre-Adamites. Any assumption to the contrary runs
counter to the whole plan and scheme of the Almighty in creating and
peopling this earth.&quot; [page 254].

&quot;Adam and Eve and all forms of life, both animal and plant, were
created in immortality; that is, when first placed on this earth, all
forms of life were in a state of immortality. There was no death in
the world; death entered after the fall.&quot; [page 252].

The highest ruling body in the Mormon church, the first presidency
consisting (at the time) of Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and
Anthon H. Lund issued an official declaration regarding the church's
official stance on evolution. [Man: His Origin and Destiny, pp
354-355]. The statement is carefully worded and never answers the
issue of evolution directly, as McConkie did, but the constraints laid
down by the first presidency essentially precludes evolution from ever
happening within the Mormon framework of theology. McConkie quotes
large sections of this official pronouncement in &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;,
under the section on evolution.

Another reference is the June 1993 issue of the Ensign. The Ensign is
the Mormon church's official magazine publication, and is used by the
president of the church to convey official church doctrine. It also
has &quot;faith promoting&quot; articles, and articles of general interest.

On page 21 there is an article by George R. Hill III, an emeritus
member of the Quorum of Seventy. Members of the quorum of seventy are
all general authorities. The quorum of seventy has equal authority
with the quorum of the twelve apostles, and with the first presidency.
The article by Mr. Hill illustrates the Mormon position on evolution
better, I think, than most. According to Hill, evolution violates the
second law of thermodynamics (untrue, by the way, and probably a lie
since Hill, having a Ph.D. in chemistry, almost certainly knows
better). He does not say whether or not evolution actually occurs, but
says if it happens it must be directed by god.

Back to &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;, by Bruce McConkie. Bruce shows how Mormon
church theology is at odds with many other areas of science, besides
just evolution. For instance, Mormons believe in a literal flood at
the time of Noah, and that it covered the entire earth. According to
McConkie, &quot;In the days of Noah the Lord sent a universal flood which
completely immersed the whole earth and destroyed all flesh except
that preserved on the ark. (Gen. 6; 7; 8; 9; Moses 7:38-45; 8; Ether
13.2.) &quot;Noah was born to save seed of everything, when the earth was
washed of its wickedness by the flood.&quot; (Teachings, p. 12) This flood
was the baptism of the earth; before it occurred the land was all in
one place, a condition that will again prevail during the millennial
era. (D&amp;C 133:23-24)&quot; [page 289]. Mormons cannot interpret the flood
figuratively, or as just a local phenomena, because in Mormon theology
the flood represented the literal baptism of the earth. Mormons teach
that baptism must be by immersion. At a Mormon baptism there are
always two witnesses who watch the person being baptized. If any part
of their body comes above the surface of the water, they perform the
baptism over.

This points out another area where Mormonism is at odds with modern
science: Mormonism teaches that the division of the continents took
place after the flood, within a matter of a few days or months, and
that during the millennium the

Mr. Darwin, and a kindred school of modern philosophers, would fain try
to impress upon us their theory of evolutions, and would have us believe
we are descendants from, and only a little in advance of our ancester,
the monkey; and that other inferior grades of animals are aspiring to
become monkeys; they fail to demonstrate their theories, simply because
they are not demonstrateable.

~~Erastus Snow, Apostle of Joseph Smith the Seer
Journal of Discourses, Vol.19, Pg.327, January 20, 1878

There is a theory put forth by Mr. Darwin, and others, that is the school of
modern philosophers, which is termed in late years, the theory of Evolution,
that man in our present state upon the earth, is but the sequence and
outgrowth of steady advancement from the lowest order of creation, till the
present type of man, and that we have advanced step by step from the lowest
order of creation till at last man has been formed upon the earth in our
present sphere of action; in short, that our great-grandfathers were apes
and monkeys.  And how much satisfaction these philosophers have in the
contemplation of their grandfather monkeys, we are left to conjecture; but
such are the theories put forth by some of our modern philosophers.

~~Erastus Snow, Apostle of Joseph Smith the Seer
Journal of Discourses, Vol.19, Pgs.271-273, March 3, 1878

What Is the Purpose of Existence?

... a moment's reflection is sufficient to teach every man of common
intelligence, that all these are not the mere productions of chance, nor
could they be supported by any power less than an Almighty hand; ...

~~Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Section Two 1834-37 Pg.56

Where was there ever a son without a father? And where was there ever a
father without first being a son? Whenever did a tree or anything spring
into existence without a progenitor? And everything comes in this way.

~~Joseph Smith, Jun., Messages of the First Presidency, Vol.1, Pg.228-229

16 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the
potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not?
or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no
understanding?

(Old Testament | Isaiah 29:16)

27 And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord! And
their works are in the dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and who knoweth us?
And they also say: Surely, your turning of things upside down shall be
esteemed as the potter's clay. But behold, I will show unto them, saith the
Lord of Hosts, that I know all their works. For shall the work say of him
that made it, he made me not? Or shall the thing framed say of him that
framed it, he had no understanding?

&gt; happening within the Mormon framework of theology. McConkie quotes
&gt; large sections of this official pronouncement in &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;,
&gt; under the section on evolution.

&gt; Another reference is the June 1993 issue of the Ensign. The Ensign is
&gt; the Mormon church's official magazine publication, and is used by the
&gt; president of the church to convey official church doctrine. It also
&gt; has &quot;faith promoting&quot; articles, and articles of general interest.

&gt; On page 21 there is an article by George R. Hill III, an emeritus
&gt; member of the Quorum of Seventy. Members of the quorum of seventy are
&gt; all general authorities. The quorum of seventy has equal authority
&gt; with the quorum of the twelve apostles, and with the first presidency.
&gt; The article by Mr. Hill illustrates the Mormon position on evolution
&gt; better, I think, than most. According to Hill, evolution violates the
&gt; second law of thermodynamics (untrue, by the way, and probably a lie
&gt; since Hill, having a Ph.D. in chemistry, almost certainly knows
&gt; better). He does not say whether or not evolution actually occurs, but
&gt; says if it happens it must be directed by god.

&gt; Back to &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;, by Bruce McConkie. Bruce shows how Mormon
&gt; church theology is at odds with many other areas of science, besides
&gt; just evolution. For instance, Mormons believe in a literal flood at
&gt; the time of Noah, and that it covered the entire earth. According to
&gt; McConkie, &quot;In the days of Noah the Lord sent a universal flood which
&gt; completely immersed the whole earth and destroyed all flesh except
&gt; that preserved on the ark. (Gen. 6; 7; 8; 9; Moses 7:38-45; 8; Ether
&gt; 13.2.) &quot;Noah was born to save seed of everything, when the earth was
&gt; washed of its wickedness by the flood.&quot; (Teachings, p. 12) This flood
&gt; was the baptism of the earth; before it occurred the land was all in
&gt; one place, a condition that will again prevail during the millennial
&gt; era. (D&amp;C 133:23-24)&quot; [page 289]. Mormons cannot interpret the flood
&gt; figuratively, or as just a local phenomena, because in Mormon theology
&gt; the flood represented the literal baptism of the earth. Mormons teach
&gt; that baptism must be by immersion. At a Mormon baptism there are
&gt; always two witnesses who

As a rule, most religions are usually able to paper over their
contradictions with science, at least to the satisfaction of the true
believer. However, the LDS church obviously has some serious and
unique problems in that regard. I don't believe this will cause the
church to disappear at anytime in the foreseeable future, but I do
believe their membership will decline over time and the science vs the
LDS church issues (and some other problems) will eventually relegate
them to the dust bin of history.

Thanks for the article, by the way.

&gt; American Quarter Horse: The ultimate all-terrain vehicle

&gt; &gt; Mormon's frequently dismiss Darwinian evolution science as being no
&gt; &gt; more of a threat to Mormonism than to other churches such as the
&gt; &gt; Catholics and Protestants, for example. But is that true? Here's an
&gt; &gt; article that says it isn't true and, in fact, refers to Mormons as the
&gt; &gt; world's preeminent creationists. Here's an excerpt:

&gt; &gt; The official statement of the Mormon church on the origin of the earth
&gt; &gt; and life is in Moses chapter 2 and Abraham chapter 4 in the Pearl of
&gt; &gt; Great Price. The Pearl of Great Price is one of Mormonism's standard
&gt; &gt; works. It is held by the Mormon church and its leaders as revelation
&gt; &gt; from god, and official church doctrine. Chapter 2 is supposedly a
&gt; &gt; revelation from god to Joseph Smith describing how god created the
&gt; &gt; earth, and life on it. Chapter 4 basically repeats chapter 2, with
&gt; &gt; some minor modifications. The heading for chapter 2 reads &quot;As revealed
&gt; &gt; to Joseph Smith the Prophet, in December, 1830. The first verse reads
&gt; &gt; &quot;And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moses saying: Behold, I
&gt; &gt; reveal unto you concerning the heaven, and this earth; write the words
&gt; &gt; which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by
&gt; &gt; mine only Begotten I created these things; yea, in the beginning I
&gt; &gt; created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou standest.&quot;

&gt; &gt; So much for the oft-asserted claim by Mormon apologists, that their
&gt; &gt; prophets never claimed to have communicated with god about how the
&gt; &gt; earth and life were created. Please note that the creation story in
&gt; &gt; the Pearl of Great Price was supposedly a direct revelation from god
&gt; &gt; to Joseph Smith depicting a tutorial between god and Moses on the
&gt; &gt; creation of this earth. Not surprisingly Joseph Smith's creation story
&gt; &gt; is a modified plagiarism of the Hebrew creation myth found in the
&gt; &gt; Bible. I have listed some of the claims of this official version
&gt; &gt; below.

&gt; &gt; 1. According to official Mormon doctrine, god created grass, herb
&gt; &gt; yielding seeds, and fruit trees on day three (see verses 11-13). Then
&gt; &gt; he created the sun on the fourth day (see verses 14-19). [Have Mormons
&gt; &gt; ever wondered how these plants survived without the sun?].

&gt; &gt; 2. According to official Mormon doctrine, god created the earth and
&gt; &gt; dry land on day three (Moses 2: 9-13) and then created the sun and
&gt; &gt; moon on day four. According to the best theories of how the solar
&gt; &gt; system formed, the sun formed first. The planets formed later in the
&gt; &gt; solar system's development through a gradual process of accumulation.
&gt; &gt; Here, in Joseph Smith's fanciful fairy tail, we have an earth complete
&gt; &gt; with grass and fruiting trees before the sun is made. Furthermore, the
&gt; &gt; implication seems clear enough that god created the stars on the same
&gt; &gt; day he created the sun and moon (Moses 2:16; 3:1, Abraham 4:16). The
&gt; &gt; best theories of the moon's creation have it being formed when a
&gt; &gt; planetesimal impacted with the early earth. This likely happened
&gt; &gt; before any life evolved on earth, and most certainly would have killed
&gt; &gt; any life on earth that had been &quot;created&quot; in the out-of-sequence story
&gt; &gt; we find in the Pearl of Great Price. The idea that the stars were
&gt; &gt; created after the earth is, of course ludicrous. The best scientific
&gt; &gt; evidence has the earth being formed partially from the heavy elements
&gt; &gt; that can only be created in a super Nova. [For a good introductory
&gt; &gt; explanation of the formation of the solar system, earth, and life, I
&gt; &gt; highly recommend The History of Earth by William K. Hartmann and Ron
&gt; &gt; Miller].

&gt; &gt; 3. According to official Mormon doctrine, god created water animals,
&gt; &gt; whales, and birds on the fifth day (Moses 2:20-22) and then created
&gt; &gt; land animals such as cattle on the sixth day (Moses 2:24-31).
&gt; &gt; According to the theory of evolution, birds evolved from land animals,
&gt; &gt; as did whales. In Joseph Smith's &quot;revelation&quot;, however, we have god
&gt; &gt; creating whales and birds before creating land animals.

&gt; &gt; Joseph repeated his creation myth in Abraham chapter 4. In this
&gt; &gt; account, he has the &quot;god's&quot; creating grass and fruiting trees on the
&gt; &gt; third &quot;time&quot;, and then the sun and moon during the fourth &quot;time&quot; (see
&gt; &gt; Abraham 4:9-19). Again, Joseph has the &quot;god's&quot; creating whales and
&gt; &gt; fishes on the fifth &quot;time&quot;, along with birds (Abraham 4:20-23) and
&gt; &gt; then cattle and other land animals on the sixth &quot;time&quot;, along with man
&gt; &gt; (Abraham 4:24-31).

&gt; &gt; Mormons are the world's preeminent creationists. Other religions can
&gt; &gt; waft away the Hebrew creation myth in the Bible as being allegorical,
&gt; &gt; figurative, or simply borrowed from the Babylonians. Mormons could, if
&gt; &gt; they chose, discount the Genesis account as a bastardized version long
&gt; &gt; since corrupted by many translations. However, the Pearl of Great
&gt; &gt; Price does not afford Mormonism any of these luxuries. Here in the
&gt; &gt; book of Moses and the book of Abraham we find a personal tutorial from
&gt; &gt; god to Joseph Smith describing the earth's formation and the creation
&gt; &gt; of life. No millennia of translations. No corruption from the church
&gt; &gt; of the devil. Just pure revelation from god to the founder of
&gt; &gt; Mormonism. If Mormonism is true, then the creation account in the
&gt; &gt; Pearl of Great Price should be verified by science. That Joseph's
&gt; &gt; creation account is diametrically opposed to the best physical
&gt; &gt; evidence is one of the best proofs I know that he was not inspired of
&gt; &gt; god.

&gt; &gt; After you finish with the Pearl of Great Price, get a copy of &quot;Mormon
&gt; &gt; Doctrine&quot; by Bruce McConkie. (Some individuals in the Mormon church
&gt; &gt; view McConkie as a fallen prophet, but most do not. &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;
&gt; &gt; contains only a small fraction of the quotes I'm providing here.)
&gt; &gt; McConkie, by the way was sustained in general conference, along with
&gt; &gt; other members of the Mormon &quot;council of twelve apostles&quot; as a prophet,
&gt; &gt; seer, and revelator. To see just how significant this is in Mormon
&gt; &gt; theology, read chapter 8 of Mosiah in the Book of Mormon. Mormons
&gt; &gt; believe that through their seers &quot;all things [shall] be revealed.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Most Mormons regard this book as an authoritative source of
&gt; &gt; information about Mormon church doctrine. Look up the section on
&gt; &gt; evolution, science, geology, and astronomy. In case you don't have a
&gt; &gt; copy, or access to one, here are a few quotes:

&gt; &gt; &quot;There is no harmony between the truths of revealed religion and the
&gt; &gt; theories of organic evolution.&quot; [page 256].

&gt; &gt; &quot;Evolutionary theories assume that hundreds of millions of years were
&gt; &gt; involved, first in the creation of the earth as a habitable globe, and
&gt; &gt; again in the evolution of spontaneously generated, single celled forms
&gt; &gt; of life into the complex and multitudinous forms of life now found on
&gt; &gt; its face. We have rather specific scriptural indications that the
&gt; &gt; creative period was of relatively short duration.&quot; [page 255].

&gt; &gt; &quot;There were no pre-Adamites. Any assumption to the contrary runs
&gt; &gt; counter to the whole plan and scheme of the Almighty in creating and
&gt; &gt; peopling this earth.&quot; [page 254].

&gt; &gt; &quot;Adam and Eve and all forms of life, both animal and plant, were
&gt; &gt; created in immortality; that is, when first placed on this earth, all
&gt; &gt; forms of life were in a state of immortality. There was no death in
&gt; &gt; the world; death entered after the fall.&quot; [page 252].

&gt; &gt; The highest ruling body in the Mormon church, the first presidency
&gt; &gt; consisting (at the time) of Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and
&gt; &gt; Anthon H. Lund issued an official declaration regarding the church's
&gt; &gt; official stance on evolution. [Man: His Origin and Destiny, pp
&gt; &gt; 354-355]. The statement is carefully worded and never answers the
&gt; &gt; issue of evolution directly, as McConkie did, but the constraints laid
&gt; &gt; down by the first presidency essentially precludes evolution from ever
&gt; &gt; happening within the Mormon framework of theology. McConkie quotes
&gt; &gt; large sections of this official pronouncement in &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;,
&gt; &gt; under the section on evolution.

&gt; &gt; Another reference is the June 1993 issue of the Ensign. The Ensign is
&gt; &gt; the Mormon church's official magazine publication, and is used by the
&gt; &gt; president of the church to convey official church doctrine. It also
&gt; &gt; has &quot;faith promoting&quot; articles, and articles of general interest.

In 1893, George Q. Cannon, Apostle of Joseph the Seer, said:

As I have told many of our young men when they have been going to college,
how valuable it is to know that these doctrines of Darwin are incorrect, and
that man has not come up from that low condition, through thousands or
millions of years, to his present stature and reasoning faculties, etc.  It
is worth something to know that, to begin with, and not spend time over it.
So it is with many things that are taught by scientific men.  It gives the
Latter-day Saints an advantage over every other people and our young men
will make progress in science that will surprise the world because of this,
having certain fixed principles of truth to commence with which God has
revealed, and which they know are true.  This is our condition as an entire
people.  There are cartloads of books being written from time to time to
prove certain things that are not true.  The Lord having revealed to us the
truth, and having His Spirit to enlighten us, by which we can go to Him and
ask concerning matters about which we are ignorant, He will give us light
and dispel darkness.

Farewell to Eden -- Coming to terms with Mormonism and Science

By Duwayne R. Anderson

1st Books Library, 2003.
Quality Paperback: 348 pages.
ISBN: 1-4107-5384-0 (Paperback, other bindings available)
Suggested retail price: $22.95 paperback, $29.95 hardback(US)

Reviewed by: Jeffrey Needle

The author explains in an introduction that he is, in effect, a disaffected
Latter-day Saint. Active in leadership roles early in life, when his career
path led to the study of science, specifically physics, he began to sense
some lack of agreement between what his religion taught vis a vis the
sciences, and what he was learning as a working scientist.

His major problems are with the Book of Abraham and Moses, both from the
Pearl of Great Price, inasmuch as these documents deal more directly with
science than with other LDS scripture.
...
All of this raises the question of how a Mormon scientist can reconcile two
such diverse points of view. I believe it was Henry Eyring who talked about
his own need to compartmentalize his thinking, to separate his religious
life from his vocation as a scientist. Can one really so thoroughly divide
his intellectual apparatus without weakening both aspects? Eyring seemed to
think so. Anderson, alas, thinks not.
...
I commend Anderson for his hard work and commitment. The book deserves to be
read, if only for the sake of discussion.

*Farewell to Eden: Coming to terms with Mormonism and Science*

Back in 1995 I was exploring my beliefs regarding the religion I was born
with. I lurked on alt.religion.mormon, and it wasn't difficult to see that
many of the former Mormons made much more sense than the Mormon apologists,
which was ironic considering I thought of myself as a Mormon apologist at
the time. My conversion to the other side did not take long once I decided
to approach life with honesty and holistic, reasonable evidences rather than
ad hoc explanations. Duwayne Anderson was one of those posters on
alt.religion.mormon in those days that influenced me.

Almost a decade later his thoughts are now organized into a book dealing
with the same topics as most of his posts: namely, the differences between
(the ever undefinable, yet Duwayne tries to define) Mormon doctrine and
science. ...

from the publisher:
*Farewell to Eden* is the first comprehensive reference book that examines
virtually every aspect of LDS doctrine relating to the world of science.
From subjects as diverse as the age of the earth, extinction, evolution,
quantum mechanics, and ancient American archeology, this book captures the
essential elements of LDS doctrine and illustrated in clear and concise
prose the gulf that exists between it and science.

The book's layout includes five chapters that deal individually with
specific issues relating to Mormonism and science. Within each chapter,
Anderson first describes Mormon doctrine regarding the subject and then
describes what we know of the matter from science. Summary sections at the
end of each chapter contrast the two, pointing to specific and important
areas of disagreement.

*Farwell to Eden* also describes the personal toll taken upon the lives of
individuals who strive to hold to their Mormon upbringing while pursuing a
carrier in science. A seminal work on the subject, *Farewell to Eden* is an
essential reference guide destined for the personal libraries of every
intellectual associated with or interested in the subject of Mormon theology
and modern science.

A fourth-generation Mormon, Duwayne Anderson has a Bachelors degree in
Physics from Brigham Young University, and is a Principal Engineer for a
major Test and Measurement company, where he specializes in fiber optics. He
is the co-author of a leading textbook on optical time-domain reflectomery,
and a frequent presenter at national and international conferences on fiber
optics, especially in the field of telecommunications. Duwayne is also the
author of several dozen trade journal articles and papers, and holds 16
patents.

You can purchase the hardcover edition of this book here.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1410753832/rpcman

Duwayne is a former Cultural Mormon and a frequent contributor
(for the worse) to alt.religion.mormon; Jeff is a collector of books on
Mormonism and a contributor not only to The Association for Mormon
Letters but also occasionally to alt.religion.mormon. Duwayne does
(unfortunately) re-enact the role of the anti-Christ Korihor (in the Book of
Mormon), though there's no question that he is brilliant.

Henry Eyring
February 20, 1901 - December 26, 1981

By Walter Kauzmann

HENRY EYRING was fortunate in entering the arena of chemical physics at the
time that quantum mechanics began impinging on the fundamental problems of
chemistry. He was also fortunate in possessing to an unusual degree a
fertile imagination, unbounded curiosity, a warm and outgoing personality, a
high degree of intellectual talent, the ability to work hard, and a
determination to succeed. The result was that, beginning in the early years
of the 1930s, he exerted an important influence on the large numbers of
students and colleagues lucky enough to come into contact with him. This
influence continued to spread throughout the chemical community for the rest
of his life.

He broke new ground in a wide sweep of scientific activities, involving
matters that ranged from fundamental principles of chemistry to problems of
a highly practical and applied nature. Some of his ideas contain elements
that remain controversial and a considerable number of contemporary
scientists continue to work on them.

Eyring was born in 1901 in the prosperous Mormon community of Colonia
Juarez, Mexico (about 100 miles south of Columbus, New Mexico). He was a
third generation Mormon, his grandparents on both sides having participated
in the early migration (1850-60), first to Salt Lake City and then to
outlying communities. The move to Mexico by his grandparents took place in
the late 1880s following the admission of Utah to the United States and the
consequent persecution of those Mormons who refused to accommodate to the
new state of affairs. Henry was born and raised as a Mormon and he remained
a devoted follower of that faith throughout his life.
...
In 1946 Eyring was approached by the University of Utah to explore his
interest in becoming the dean of its graduate school, with the aim of
building a major research activity at the university. The attraction of Salt
Lake City was strong. While at Wisconsin Eyring had married Mildred Bennion,
also a devout Mormon. The marriage had produced three sons, Edward Marcus,
born in Oakland in 1931, Henry Bennion born in Princeton in 1933, and Harden
Romney born in Princeton in 1936. Mildred especially was concerned

&gt;&gt; to say about Darwin evolution theory since then?

&gt;In 1893, George Q. Cannon, Apostle of Joseph the Seer, said:

It's been 115 years since Cannon predicted that Mormon
men would make &quot;progress in science that would surprise
the world&quot; specifically because they alone can go to God
and &quot;ask concerning matters about which we are ignorant,
He will give us light and dispel darkness.&quot;

This is a very bold claim that requires much more than
merely citing the accomplishments of a few Mormon scientists.
Cannon is predicting nothing short of that the world would
come to recognize world-shaking scientific achievement as
a hallmark ability of Mormon men.

An unbiased historian such as myself draws from the evidence
that Cannon's prediction is an example of 19th century Mormonism's
tendency to make brash and outrageous &quot;you'll soon see&quot; boasts
based upon their claims that Mormon men could obtain objective
knowledge from God.

Jong, what do YOU draw from the evidence of the past 115 years?
Do you have the courage to face squarely the fact that the simple
fact is that Mormon scientists have NOT amazed the world as a group?
What happened to all the revealed objective scientific knowledge
that Mormons were supposedly going to get?

You frequently write at length about scientists -- why do you not
have hundreds of examples of Mormon scientific greatness to crow
about as Cannon predicted you would have? Why do you spend 99.9%
of your writing denouncing the science of &quot;Gentiles&quot; instead
of pointing to the obvious scientific achievements of Mormons?

Mormons seem to believe in a limited form of evolution:

&quot;Man is the child of God, formed in the divine image
and endowed with divine attributes, and even as the
infant son of an earthly father and mother is capable
in due time of becoming a man, so the undeveloped
offspring of celestial parentage is capable,
by experience through ages and aeons, of evolving
into a God.&quot;

John A. Widtsoe studied biochemistry at Harvard University and in 1899
received a Ph.D. in chemistry from Göttingen University in Germany.
http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/education/science_scientists...

The Elder John A. Widtsoe, editor of *Discourses of Brigham Young*, wrote in
1943:

The majority of the advocates of the theory that all life came from one
stock believe that the primeval cell originated by the chance assembling
under favorable conditions of the constituent elements of cellular
substance. That means that life is only an accidental intruder into the
universe. The immediate logical weakness of this view is that if life on
earth began by the fortuitous assembling of inorganic materials in a slimy,
primitive pool, other equally favorable pools for the generation of life may
have existed, thus providing more than one origin of life.

Those who insist that all life on earth has come from one source are almost
obliged to rule God out of the picture; for, if a Supreme Being is allowed
to create a living cell in the beginning, He may at will create other life
at different periods of time. Even believers in God who accept the theory of
evolution as a final explanation of the origin of life forms, are inclined
to insist that the theory represents Gods only method of creation. Nearly
always, those who so believe refuse to admit that any other process may also
be in operation. They would limit God to one method of operation. Fettering
God, or unbelief in Him, or making Him merely a universal super-force, have
been usual companions of the theory of evolution (W. W. Keen, *I Believe in
God and Evolution*).

Latter-day Saints accept every scientific fact, but rate theories based upon
the facts as human explanations of the facts, likely to change as new facts
appear. They do not deny that an evolutionary process, a reflection of the
gospel law of progression, may be one of the methods of the Lord's labor in
the universe. That does not mean, however, that the Almighty cannot perform
other acts of will for the promotion of His plan, as, for example, the
special creation of man. God is a purposeful Being; whatever is on earth or
in heaven has been designed for the accomplishment of the divine purpose --
the welfare of man. The spirit of man, itself intelligent, purposeful, is an
eternal pre-existent being. He reaches beyond the confines of earth. He was
with God before the earth was made. The theory of evolution does not explain
the external man.

Any theory that leaves out God as a personal, purposeful Being, and accepts
chance as a first cause cannot be accepted by Latter-day Saints.

~~Evidences and Reconciliations, Pgs.163-164

As a scholar and scientist, Widtsoe is best known for his book *Dry Farming,
A System of Agriculture for Countries Under Low Rainfall*. Published in
1911, the book remains the definitive work on dry farming throughout the
world. ...

As an educator, he is the only person to serve as president of Utah's two
oldest public institutions of higher education, Utah State University and
the University of Utah. ...

As a spiritual leader, he emphasized the search for truth and the need for
an intelligent understanding of church doctrine and principles rather than
simple blind obedience. This approach was followed during his tenure as
editor of The Improvement Era, the primary monthly publication of the LDS
Church, and in his numerous church books and articles, among which include:
*Joseph Smith as Scientist* (1908), *Rational Theology* (1915), *In Search
of Truth* (1930), *Priesthood and Church Government* (1939) and *Evidences
and Reconciliations* (1943).
http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/w/WIDTSOE,JOHN.html

... there had appeared in the April, 1908, issue of the Improvement Era an
article announcing the death of William Thompson or Lord Kelvin on December
17, 1907. The article was written by a prominent L.D.S. scientist, Dr. John
A. Widtsoe, President of the Agricultural College of Utah at Logan, now Utah
State University.

... the Improvement Era was an official organ of the L.D.S. Church and
widely read throughout the Church, ...

Pertinent to the subject of the Origin of Man are the following quotations
from Widtsoe's review of the views of Lord Kelvin on this subject:

&quot;Not only did Lord Kelvin believe that God lives and rules, but he had no
sympathy with the idle notion of the day that life began upon this earth and
will disappear with death. He believed in the eternity of life, and that
life had come to this earth from other heavenly bodies. True, he did not
understand the full philosophy of life's beginnings on this earth, but
certainly with all the power at his command as the great scientist of his
day, he refuted many of the modern theories which teach the origin of life
on this earth without the intervention of an overruling Providence.&quot; (IE
11:402)

After quoting again from the writings of Lord Kelvin, Widtsoe comments:

&quot;Carefully read, this paragraph [from Kelvin] will be found to teach that
life is eternal; that life on this earth came from other spheres; that the
law of natural selection is imperfect, and does not account for the variety
of living things; that the law of evolution is true only as it conforms to
the law of progression; that the whole of nature teaches the existence of a
great designer or great governing power; and that finally; the power of free
agency encircles our lives.&quot; (IE 1:403)

Widtsoe then quotes at length from the Presidential Address of Lord Kelvin
to the British Association, Edinburgh, 1871, including Kelvin's statement
that he could not accept the hypothesis of the origin of species by natural
selection, &quot;because I have always felt that this hypothesis does not contain
the true theory of evolution, if evolution there has been, in biology.&quot;

Widtsoe's final paragraph had said:

&quot;Does 'Mormonism' agree with the sane talks of Lord Kelvin? All who
understand it will say, yes. The science of the world is, and can be no more
than one phase of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ which embraces all
truth.&quot;

... the issuance of the statement of the First Presidency on The Origin of
Man in 1909, ... there are some very close parallels between the viewpoints
expressed in the Widtsoe article and this statement of the First Presidency
nineteen months later. Time enough would have elapsed between the two to
have given the Widtsoe article a rather wide airing in L.D.S. circles.

Messages of the First Presidency, Vol.4, Pgs.199-200

THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF MORMONISM. --
Is there a true principle of science in the world?
It is ours.
Are there true principles of music, of mechanism, or of philosophy?
If there are, they are all ours.

~~The Gospel Kingdom, by John Taylor

&lt;* To discuss Lord Kelvin's hypothesis of vortex-atoms, from the scientific
point of view, is beyond my ability. From the philosophical point of view,
however I may say that since it postulates a homogeneous medium which is
strictly continuous (non-molecular), which is incompressible, which is a
perfect fluid in the sense of having no viscosity, and which has inertia, it
sets out with what appears to me an inconceivability. A fluid which has
inertia, implying mass, and which is yet absolutely frictionless. so that
its parts move among one another without any loss of motion, cannot be truly
represented in consciousness.
...
Deep down then in the very nature of Life, the relativity of our knowledge
is discernible. The analysis of vital actions in general, leads not only to
the conclusion that things in themselves cannot be known to us, but also to
the conclusion that knowledge of them, were it possible, would be useless.

§26. There remains the final question - What must we say concerning that
which transcends knowledge? Are we to rest wholly in the consciousness of
phenomena? Is the result of inquiry to exclude utterly from our minds
everything but the relative? or must we also believe in something beyond the
relative?

The answer of pure logic is held to be that by the limits of our
intelligence we are rigorously confined within the relative, and that
anything transcending the relative can be thought of as a pure negation,
or as a non-existence.

Mormon Farm Boy: Inventor of Television
By: Vince Horiuchi
Date: 20 March 2000
Source: Salt Lake Tribune
URL: http://www.sltrib.com/03202000/utah/35029.htm

It seems almost unfathomable that one of the century's greatest inventions
was conceived in a muddy hayfield on a ranch in Rigby, Idaho.

But that's where Mormon farm boy Philo T. Farnsworth was in 1921 -- breaking
up soil with his uncle's horse-drawn harrow -- when the idea walloped him.
He gazed at the plowed rows of dirt behind him, and a vision of a line of
excited electrons danced in his head.

And so, the idea for television was born. Farnsworth was only 14 years old.

&quot;He had it all pretty well figured out, but he couldn't figure out how to
scan a picture -- to turn it into an electrical impulse that can be
transmitted,&quot; said Farnsworth's widow, Elma &quot;Pem&quot; Farnsworth. &quot;All at once
it hit him that that is what he could do, that he could scan a picture like
reading a page one line at a time. This was the one thing that was holding
the industry up.&quot;

And a new information revolution began.

They called him &quot;Phil,&quot; a seemingly run-of-the-mill man with extraordinary
intellect whose far-reaching vision and mind-numbing calculations created a
device that opened the world inside our living rooms.

Events such as the moon landing, the Vietnam War and the Watergate hearings
unfolded on cathode ray tubes like the one he invented. Thanks to him, such
quips as &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; and &quot;Plop, plop, fizz, fizz&quot; became a part of
the American lexicon. Then again, we might condemn him for &quot;Laverne and
Shirley,&quot; &quot;The Gong Show&quot; or &quot;Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?&quot;

Yet can we accept the notion that one man -- especially a homely chap born
in a log cabin near Beaver, Utah, who used to ride horseback to school --
could diagram the complex computations that make up television?

For decades, electronics giant Radio Corporation of America (RCA) would
fashion a public relations machine to say otherwise. It was their engineers
who brought TV to the world, they exclaimed, because television is too
complicated to be the brainchild of just one man.

A Sad End: Though he won a patent war with RCA in the 1930s, Farnsworth was
pushed out of the television race by RCA's corporate juggernaut. And he
eventually faced bankruptcy, depression, drinking and illness before he died
in 1971. Near the end of his career, Farnsworth was anything but well-known.
About his only acknowledgement then was as a mystery guest on the game show
&quot;What's My Line?&quot; (In fact, he stumped the panel and walked away with a pack
of Winstons and 80 bucks).

But history is making amends. Farnsworth is now getting the recognition many
say he deserved. He was given an honorary Emmy. His statue was erected in
Utah and Washington, D.C. The peak in the Oquirrh Mountains where Utah's
television station antennas sit was named after him. The U.S. Postal Service
commemorated him with a stamp in 1983. Last year, Time declared him one of
the 20 most important scientists and thinkers of the 20th century. U.S. News
&amp; World Report called him one of the world's greatest inventors, alongside
the Wright brothers and J. Robert Oppenheimer.

Brigham Young University, the same college that Farnsworth attended for two
years, has now turned his life into a stage play.

&quot;A Love Affair With Electrons&quot; is about Farnsworth's life told in a series
of vignettes, each like a television program.

&quot;What interested me more was not so much who invented television but what it
means&quot; said Eric Samuelsen, BYU associate professor of theater and
writer-director of the play. &quot;Whoever invented television changed the
world.&quot;

But let's get some misconceptions out of the way: No, Philo Farnsworth was
not from Rigby, nor did he build the first TV there. And while Utahns can
call him their own, he really built and projected the first television image
in his loft in San Francisco.

The grandson of a pioneer who settled with Brigham Young, Farnsworth was a
boy growing up in Indian Creek, Beaver County, when he realized how to make
his mark.

&quot;He decided that when he was 6 years old he was going to be an inventor,&quot;
said Elma Farnsworth from her home in Fort Wayne, Ind. &quot;This was when the
telephone and gramophone came to the country. He thought it was magic and
his dad said, 'No, it's an invention.' He thought an inventor was a pretty
good thing to be.&quot;

Hard times forced the Farnsworth family to move to Rigby, where they helped
take care of their Uncle Albert's ranch. By the age of 12, Farnsworth
already was adept at fixing the ranch equipment, including the broken-down
Delco power system.

&quot;The older people stood around very apprehensively watching him take it
apart. He washed all the parts good and put them back together and asked for
some light oil, and it turned on,&quot; Elma Farnsworth said. &quot;That was the first
time he had much response to the fact he was a pretty smart boy.&quot;

He loved magazines such as Popular Science and was way ahead of his
classmates in math and science at Rigby High School. And in his head, he
carried this idea: You could transmit an image of an object from one place
to another by converting the picture into electricity and shooting the
stream of electrons at a fluorescent screen in a vacuum tube.

To show his chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, how it worked, Farnsworth
scribbled a diagram of his idea on the school blackboard. He was 15.

That later would prove auspicious. During Farnsworth's battle with RCA over
the patent, Tolman would be called to testify, and he reproduced the sketch
in detail -- a key piece of evidence in favor of Farnsworth.

Back to Utah: Because of economic hardships, his family moved back to Utah,
and Farnsworth attended BYU for two years until his father's death forced
him to pull out. Meanwhile, he began working on his concept for television
while taking odd jobs. (The term &quot;television&quot; had been around for some time,
but at that time it referred to various mechanical devices for projecting a
moving image similar to movies.)

He later met George Everson and Leslie Gorrell, two California fund-raisers
who were in Salt Lake City to recruit college students. Farnsworth was hired
as a survey manager, but he told them about his idea for electrical
television. Intrigued, the three formed a company to start the project.

&gt;&gt; &gt;So it is with many things that are taught by scientific men.
&gt;&gt; &gt;It gives the Latter-day Saints an advantage over every other

&gt;&gt; &gt;go to Him and ask concerning matters about which we
&gt;&gt; &gt;are ignorant, He will give us light and dispel darkness.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;~~Collected Discourses, Vol.3, September 24th, 1893

&gt;&gt; It's been 115 years since Cannon predicted that Mormon
&gt;&gt; men would make &quot;progress in science that would surprise
&gt;&gt; the world&quot; specifically because they alone can go to God
&gt;&gt; and &quot;ask concerning matters about which we are ignorant,
&gt;&gt; He will give us light and dispel darkness.&quot;

&gt;&gt; This is a very bold claim that requires much more than
&gt;&gt; merely citing the accomplishments of a few Mormon scientists.
&gt;&gt; Cannon is predicting nothing short of that the world would
&gt;&gt; come to recognize world-shaking scientific achievement as
&gt;&gt; a hallmark ability of Mormon men.

&gt;&gt; An unbiased historian such as myself draws from the evidence
&gt;&gt; that Cannon's prediction is an example of 19th century Mormonism's
&gt;&gt; tendency to make brash and outrageous &quot;you'll soon see&quot; boasts
&gt;&gt; based upon their claims that Mormon men could obtain objective
&gt;&gt; knowledge from God.

&gt;&gt; Jong, what do YOU draw from the evidence of the past 115 years?
&gt;&gt; Do you have the courage to face squarely the fact that the simple
&gt;&gt; fact is that Mormon scientists have NOT amazed the world as a group?
&gt;&gt; What happened to all the revealed objective scientific knowledge
&gt;&gt; that Mormons were supposedly going to get?

&gt;&gt; You frequently write at length about scientists -- why do you not
&gt;&gt; have hundreds of examples of Mormon scientific greatness to crow
&gt;&gt; about as Cannon predicted you would have? Why do you spend 99.9%
&gt;&gt; of your writing denouncing the science of &quot;Gentiles&quot; instead
&gt;&gt; of pointing to the obvious scientific achievements of Mormons?

I knew you were going to do that.

Apostle Cannon's boast isn't satisfied by pointing
to that a Mormon perfecting electronic television,
because he was predicting the worldwide recognition
of the future greatness for Mormon men of science
in general because they had the advantage of revelation.

The fact is that Mormons are NOT known for producing
more or higher quality scientists than any other particular
group sorted by religion or nationality -- and have had
over 100 years in which to show the world that Cannon
was right.

Like so many other 19th century Mormon boasts, this one
has been laid bare by time so that it may be see for what
it always was -- the propaganda of a religious sect whose
leaders regularly issued claims that were one part
religious theology and one part bar-room style
Wild West bravado.

And, getting back to the topic, where are all the Mormon
scientists who have used their powers of revelation to
overturn the Theory of Evolution?

Where is the 100 years-worth of of Mormon-produced SCIENCE
that counters ToE? -- and please, spare me an enormously
long recounting of Mormon-inspired THEOLOGY that counters
ToE. That exists in spades and is obviously not the same thing.

Where is the Mormon-produced SCIENCE on the subject that
has EVER amazed the world with its genius -- even to the
point that one could only conclude that it must have come
from a deity.

That's the sort of stuff what Apostle Cannon was promising
-- and no Mormon has ever delivered.

they are not putting forth anything new. They do, however, say that
&quot;It is held by some that Adam was not the first man upon this earth
and that the original human being was a development from lower orders
of the animal creation. These, however, are the theories of men. The
word of the Lord declared that Adam was &quot;the first man of all

John Moses Browning

&quot;It is not thought that any other individual has contributed so much to the
national security of this country as Mr. Browning in the development of our
machine guns and our automatic weapons to a state of military efficiency
surpassing that of all nations...&quot;

- Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis, 1926

John Moses Browning, the United States' most prolific and accomplished
weapons designer, was born on January 21, 1855 in Ogden, Utah. John's
father, Jonathan Browning, was a Mormon settler, one of the original Mormons
that made the move from Nauvoo, Illinois to Utah. Jonathan Browning set up a
gunsmith shop in Ogden in 1852, and this is where John got his interest in
weapons. John was one of his fathers 22 children, his father, being a good
Mormon, had three wives. John was always an active member of the church,
going, for instance, on a two-year mission to Georgia in 1887.

John Moses Browning is most well known, however, for the weapons that he
designed. John worked in his father's gun shop until his father passed away
in 1879, the same year he married Rachel Teresa Child. Working with his
brothers: Matthew, Jonathan Edmund, Thomas Samuel, William and George, John
established the Browning Brothers Company in Ogden. The company made roughly
600 single shot lever rifles by hand. Soon, the demand for these weapons was
far beyond their (John and his brothers') ability to produce them. They were
unable to expand on their business because they didn't have enough money to
expand and had poor distribution channels to market their products. John was
very unhappy that the production of weapons consumed his time, and he was
prohibited from working on new ideas.

In 1883, a salesman from the Winchester company named Andrew McAusland
happened to bump into one of John's Single Shot rifles. McAusland
immediately bought it and sent it to Winchester Head Quarters. T.G. Bennet,
VP and General Manager of Winchester quickly went to Ogden and negotiated to
buy the rights to produce the weapon for $8,000. Browning knew that he was
more interested in designing guns than actually manufacturing them, and used
the money to convert his shop from a factory into a design shop. From 1883
until 1902, John Browning designed many weapons for Winchester. While some
were never produced, all of these weapons were innovative and ingenious.
Browning's

Model 1886 Lever Action Repeating Rifle
Model 1887 Lever Action Repeating Shotgun
Model 1897 Pump Action Shotgun
Model 1894 Lever Action Repeating Rifle
Model 1895 Lever action Repeating Rifle

all became Winchester best sellers.

In addition to his numerous weapon designs, Browning has patents on pieces
of weapons technology that remain standard to this day. While watching a
clump of weeds bent backwards by the blast of air escaping the muzzle of a
shotgun, Browning had the idea of building a mechanism to cock a weapon
using the expanding gasses. Browning invented and patented the gas operated
return mechanism, which was a new way of returning a weapon to a loaded and
ready to fire condition. The earliest rifles, required the user to grab a
lever above the magazine, turn it, and pull the bolt back, which released
the case from the previously fired shell, and then move the bolt forward
again after it had picked up a round from the clip. The gas operated return
mechanism automated this process by using the expanding gas from the
gunpowder (when the weapon was fired) to slide the bolt back, eject the
shell, and use a springs to load another round and return the bolt to its
place. The gas is collected from a port very near the muzzle of the weapon,
and diverted through a tube either above of below the barrel; once the gas
is in the tube, it presses a piston back which is connected to the bolt.
This invention is the difference between a regular and semi-automatic
weapon: in a regular weapon, you have to load a round yourself between each
firing, but with a semi-automatic weapon, a new round is fired every time
you pull the trigger. Browning used his design to build the Auto-5, the
first semi-automatic shotgun in 1900, the Colt Model 1895 Peacemaker and of
course, the Browning Automatic Rifle.

The Browning Automatic Rifle, a sturdy weapon that saw service from the end
of WWI until Korea, is the weapon that John Browning will forever be
remembered for. Meanwhile, his Colt Model 1911 is the weapon with the
longest period of use in the USA's military, from 1911 to 1986. Updated
versions of this weapon are still used today by the FBI's Hostage Rescue
Team and the Marines. His M2 &quot;ma deuce&quot; .50 caliber heavy machine gun was
designed prior to WWI and is still in active use today.

Browning's repeating shotgun was the primary reason that his relationship
with Winchester came to an end. Winchester denied production of the gun, and
Browning built one, threw it in a suitcase, took it across the Atlantic, and
sold it to fledgling arms manufacturer Fabrique National de Belgique (FN).
FN was desperate for new products to produce, and scored a major victory
when Browning's automatic shotgun revolutionized the hunting market. This
shotgun was later rebranded as the Remington Model 11, and reproduced by all
the large shotgun manufacturers like Bereta, Franchi and Savage.

Another of John Browning's revolutionary inventions was the slide that
encloses the barrel and the firing mechanism of an automatic pistol. Pistols
using this now standard breakthrough invented by Browning were produced by
FN and Colt and include the baby .25 caliber pistol and the .45 Government
Issue automatic. The first automatic pistol redesigned by Browning was
produced by FN as the .32 caliber Model 1900. The most famous of John's
automatic pistols is the Colt .45 ACP M1911 Government Model and the FN
High-Power Model P-35 9mm parabellum.

In 1926 the Browning Arms Company was formed, and is widely known for its
Auto-5 semi-automatic shotgun, the BAR, the Hi-Power 9mm pistol, and the
famous M2. The Browning Arms Company grosses more then one hundred million
dollars in US sales alone every year. During his lifetime, Browning was
awarded 128 individual patents and is given credit as the inventor of the
semi-automatic shot gun, the pump action shot gun and the water-cooled
machine gun.

John Moses Browning died the day after Thanksgiving, 1926 of heart failure
in his son Val's office at the FN factory in Belgium. FN produced a special
collectible medal to commemorate the death of John Browning. John Browning's
body was repatriated and buried with full military honors. John Browning
will always be remembered as an innovator and a driving force behind firearm
innovation and design. From the first gun he hand built out of scrap iron at
13, to the 128 patents in his name, Browning left behind a legacy of weapons
and innovation that is impressive and functional to this day. No other
person has invented as many weapons

One could compile a similar list for damn near any

The history of Mormon achievement in the sciences
is not even close to justify attributing it to
that they they were uniquely privy to revealed knowledge
from God.

I will also point out the curious fact that one does
not find Mormon prophets leading the way to scientific
achievement -- one of them proclaimed that space travel
would prove impossible while genuinely intelligent men
were busy figuring it out how to do it.

Mormon prophets proclaimed that Joseph Smith was

There are &quot;signs galore&quot; that Mormons have FAILED
to overturn the Theory of Evolution WITH SCIENCE.

Anybody can &quot;overturn&quot; ANYTHING with theology.

If they HAD succeeded scientifically, you'd be crowing
about THAT as a sign just as you are crowing about
Farnsworth perfecting electronic television
-- but since they obviously haven't, you turn a blind eye
to THAT being a sign, and brand anyone who points it out names.

You define &quot;lightheaded&quot; -- you're high on dishonest delusion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That's the sort of stuff what Apostle Cannon was promising
&gt;&gt; -- and no Mormon has ever delivered.

&gt;Don't confuse Cultural Mormonism with the pure Gospel of Christ taught by
&gt;Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and Art Bulla, who wrote:

&gt;Why, I ask, if they [Mormon hegemony] are true prophets, have they not,
&gt;through the revelations of Jesus Christ, exposed this delusion upon the
&gt;world?

&gt;If there had been an Orson Pratt alive today, he would have thundered
&gt;from the stand indignation upon the heads of such as perpetrate patent lies.
&gt;It is I, who shall fulfill this mission in this the latter day.

Stop confusing theology for science.

ANYBODY can &quot;thunder&quot; with theology pretending to be science
all they like -- that seems to be all Mormon prophets have
EVER been capable of, Art Bulla ESPECIALLY.

&quot;Revelation&quot; on scientific subjects that yields
NO NEW OBJECTIVE FACT is obviously just hot air.

You claim that &quot;revelation&quot; was responsible for electronic
television, some of the greatest weaponry of the 19th century,
and various other advances.

These all resulted in new and very obviously real objective facts.

Why has &quot;revelation&quot; not resulted in the same thing when it
comes to overturning the Theory of Evolution? Or to prove
that the Book of Mormon is really a genuine historical account
of an actual civilization, for that matter?

Why is the crutch of &quot;faith&quot; still needed there to prop up
the supposed &quot;facts&quot; revealed on these subjects?

&gt; One could compile a similar list for damn near any

&gt; The history of Mormon achievement in the sciences

&gt; I will also point out the curious fact that one does

The Van Allen radiation belt is a torus of energetic charged particles (i.e.
a plasma) around Earth, trapped by Earth's magnetic field. The Van Allen
belts are closely related to the polar aurora where particles strike the
upper atmosphere and fluoresce. The presence of a radiation belt had been
theorized prior to the Space Age and the belt's presence was confirmed by
the Explorer I on January 31, 1958 and Explorer III missions, under Doctor
James Van Allen.

The trapped radiation was first mapped out by Explorer IV and Pioneer
III.Qualitatively, it is very useful to view this belt as consisting of two
belts around Earth, the inner radiation belt and the outer radiation belt.
The particles are distributed such that the inner belt consists mostly of
protons while the outer belt consists mostly of electrons. Within these
belts are particles capable of penetrating about 1 g/cm2 of shielding (e.g.,
1 millimetre of lead).

Previously, it was discussed how electrons _always_ attract, and positive
charges do not necessarily repulse, for it depends on the aethereal
condition.

New Atlantis (1626?):

&quot;We have also houses of deceits of the senses, where we represent all
manner of feats of juggling, false apparitions, impostures and illusions,
and their fallacies. And surely you will easily believe that we, that have
so many things truly natural which induce admiration, could in a world of
particulars deceive the senses if we would disguise those things, and
labor to make them more miraculous. But we do hate all impostures and lies,
insomuch as we have severely forbidden it to all our fellows, under pain of
ignominy and fines, that they do not show any natural work or thing adorned
or swelling, but only pure as it is, and without all affectation of
strangeness.
...
&quot;We have certain hymns and services, which we say daily, of laud and thanks
to God for His marvellous works. And forms of prayers, imploring His aid and
blessing for the illumination of our labors; and turning them into good and
holy uses.

Hannes Alfven:

The first decade of space research mainly concentrated on the exploration of
space near the Earth: the magnetosphere and interplanetary space. These
regions earlier were supposed to be void and structureless but we now know
that they are filled with plasmas, intersected by sheathlike
discontinuities, and permeated by a complicated pattern of electric currents
and electric and magnetic fields. ...

The second decade of space research seems to display a different character,
at least to some extent. As several of the basic problems of the
magnetosphere and interplanetary space are still unsolved, one can be sure
that these regions will still command much interest. However, the lunar
landings and also the deep-space probes to Venus and Mars have supplied us
with so many new scientific facts that the emphasis in space research is
moving towards the exploration of the Moon, the planets, and other celestial
bodies in the Solar System.

... Already at an early data NASA stated that the main scientific goal of
space research should be to clarify how the solar system was formed. ...

... outside this lecture hall - perhaps over a small island in the
archipelago of Stockholm - we may also see in the sky an aurora,
which is a cosmic plasma, reminding us of the time when our world
was born out of plasma. Because in the beginning was the plasma.

6 ¶ I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given
them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast
thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

7 ¶ And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: [so] that thou didst not
lay these [things] to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of
it.

8 Therefore hear now this, [thou that art] given to pleasures, that dwellest
carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I [am], and none else beside me; I
shall not sit [as] a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:

9 But these two [things] shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss
of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection
for the multitude of thy sorceries, [and] for the great abundance of thine
enchantments.

10 ¶ For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me.
Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in
thine heart, I [am], and none else beside me.

11 ¶ Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it
riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it
off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, [which] thou shalt not
know.

12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy
sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be
able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.

13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save
thee from [these things] that shall come upon thee.

14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall
not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: [there shall] not [be] a
coal to warm at, [nor] fire to sit before it.

15 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, [even] thy
merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none
shall save thee.

(Old Testament | Isaiah 47:6 - 15)

23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the
voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in
thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy
sorceries were all nations deceived.

24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all
that were slain upon the earth.

Albert Einstein,
Time Magazine's Person of the [20th] Century.

In awarding Eyring the Swedish Berzelius Gold Medal in 1979, King Karl
Gustav of Sweden said, &quot;You are the only true alchemist; you have turned the
hydrogen atom into pure gold.&quot; Eyring had started the development of his
theory of rate processes by treating the reactions of hydrogen atoms and had
rapidly expanded it to the more complex reactions in polymers and textiles,
chemiluminescence and enzyme mechanisms, biological connective tissue and
membrane permeability, and the physical chemistry of nerve action.

In New Jersey Henry Eyring served his church well. He became branch
president (1942-44) and then was called as president of the New Jersey
District (1944-46), the spiritual head, as he said, of three million persons
&quot;though most of them were blissfully unaware of the fact.&quot;9
...
Albert Einstein was at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton during
this period, and Eyring enjoyed that association. Of Einstein he said, &quot;He
was first rate, there is no question about it,… but the picture some people
have of him as a lone intellectual giant is a wrong one. I prefer to think
of him as a man with few peers. There are other people who are comparable.
Neils Bohr was another physicist of comparable scientific influence.&quot;10
