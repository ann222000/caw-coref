We have just acquired for our own collection (ie it is not for sale) an
Italian mains powered valve radio. The make is Safar, the only model
number discernable is TIPO &quot;527&quot; . It has two bands shortwave and
mediumwave (Onde Medie and Onde Corte). It is a desktop model, in white
bakelite/hard plastic (there is after all no such thing as white
bakelite).

It is amazingly slimline (about four inches wide) and about twelve
inches tall. It sits on two folding legs in the shape of wings.

Can anybody date it? Or give us any more information? Please :-)

"/> well, if you ask it nicely, it might go on a date with you (I couldn't
resist...)

Does the radio work? If not, someone is r.a.r+p should be able to
point you to the right place for parts (if you're a do-it-yourself
type) or to a service repair place.

I have a Silvertone console radio/record player that was my
grandfather's. It dates back to the mid 1940's according to my
mother &amp; grandfather. And, it works (but Grandpa was a radio
repairman until his vision deteriorated so much he could no
longer continue in that line of work.)

Hello LeAnne,
In article &lt;33B38B53.6 ... @ti.com&gt;, LeAnne Davis &lt;leanne.da ... @ti.com&gt;

"/> The trouble with rec.antiques.radio+phono is that is full of articles by
people who write things like this.....

&quot;If we call the &quot;in-phase&quot; modulation signal 1+L+R
(for mono) and the quadrature signal (L-R), an envelope detector will
output (square root of)((1+L+R)^2+(L-R)^2), which is not equal to
the mono signal. Which means an old AM radio with an envelope detector
will sound bad listening to a quadrature AM signal (QUAM). '......etc
What Motorola did to get around this problem was to produce a signal
that would have an envelope detector yield the correct mono signal
(!+L+R). Call the angle between the in-phase modulation and what the
envelope detector detects &quot;T&quot; for theta. '...........

Unlike the hardworking staff of Texas Instruments we are rather simple
bunnies and and our eyes glaze over in the full glare of techno babble.
We were rather hoping for a simple answer. But yes I have also posted to
rec. antiques. radio+phono

"/> Yes it does thank you.

Hows life treating you? Thank you for your email. I am sorry about the
screen of your computer; try windolene

"/> aw, gee...I guess you're not a techie-type.... ;)

I have all of my grandfather's old radio repair equipment &amp; someday,
I will go through it, catalog it &amp; check it out &amp; perhaps, begin to
put it to use again...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Does the radio work?
&gt; Yes it does thank you.

"/> that's great...so you don't have to do any repair work to it? I have to
fix the tuning cord on Grandpa's Silvertone. It will power up &amp; the
phonograph will work, but I can tune the radio to a station...Like I
said, I need to catalog &amp; organize - Grandpa said he had a new tuning
cord for it somewhere in all the boxes of radio supplies he gave me.

Works for BBQ as well (I am just kidding...please don't tell my mother,
she claims she taught me manners...)

Guess I like most about rec.antiques that it allows alot of
self-aggrandizement, ego-pumping and obviates the need to email personal
irrelevent information, by instead including same in a public post:)

"/> Actually what myself and Leanne were discussing (if you care to read
between the lines) was the fact that rec. antiques.radio+whatever is a
very good place to discuss radios as technical items but that
rec.antiques is more suitable for discussing their artistic and iconic
merits.

Kris and I are not interested in the kind of valves that are used to
power this Safar radio. Our interest lies in the outward design.

You are very welcome to join in.
