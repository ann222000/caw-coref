Hey folks,
Someone asked me the other day about the lead content in the ruby red
glasses and dinnerware from the 40's and 50's (notably the anchor hocking
royal ruby) but others as well.
I told them I didn't think it would be of any harm but that I have never
seen any tests to that effect.
Anyone like to comment on the concern of lead in glassware in general?

"/> I've never heard that there was/might be lead in AH glass. Did one of those
crazy hardware store test your dinnerware for lead kits confirm the presence
of lead? Personally, lead content in glass doesn't concern me. I wouldn't
leave Bacardi 151 in a lead crystal decanter for a year and then drink the
contents, but in ordinary use with cold liquids, I see no reason for
concern.

i wouldn't be concerned about lead in glass. I wish I remembered the
scientific terms to explain the properties of glass but I know that
things don't leach out of glass as they do in substances like
ceramics. This is why they use glass to store nuclear
wastes--&quot;glassification.&quot;

"/> Ah, but glass melts in water (see &quot;soda bloom&quot; )
and whatever is stored therein is slowly released
as the surface erodes. Still feel OK about
glassification of nuclear wastes? ;&lt;) There was
a scare about 10 years ago about storing wine for
long periods of time in lead crystal decanters.
Sales of my wine glasses slowed, mostly because
people didn't understand the difference between
lead crystal and soda/lime glass. My guess is
that the red glass in question is an iron red
soda/lime glass, as opposed to a copper ruby, a
selenium/cadmium ruby or a gold ruby. If any of
the iron leached out, you'd just be getting a
boost in needed minerals.

Best regards,

Tom

"/> I never said that I was exactly happy about storing nuclear wastes in
glass but there they are and I guess you have to put them somewhere
and glass does take a long time to deteriorate expecially if you keep
it dry!

&gt; Hey Gang,

"/> Thanks a lot for the good answers.
I told my friend yesterday and she feels much better about using her set
now.
Thanks again,
