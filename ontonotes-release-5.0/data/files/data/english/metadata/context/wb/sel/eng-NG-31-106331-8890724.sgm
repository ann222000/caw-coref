What defines a generation? Are their major differences? I think the
answer to both questions is yes, and while events like wars and civil
rights movements, etc. play important roles, they do not explain
everything. Take music. I think music defines generations as well as
anything. Take YouTube to be specific if you aren't convinced.

I discovered many of my favorite songs, groups, artists on YouTube.
They're there usually, at least a sample or two. The Animals singing
House of the Rising Sun, or Segovia playing classical guitar such as
Variations on a Theme, or Credence Clearwater in concert playing
Midnight Special. These are music from my generation and I am loyal to
them and listen and watch them religiously. They bring back fond
memories and I just think they are wonderful musicians. But then I
type in &quot;guitar&quot; and start going through the list hoping to fine my
favorite Spanish guitar players...they too are there, but not so many
people seem to appreciate them..names like John Williams (the guitar
player, not the writer/conductor) playing Asturias, Pepe Romero,
Segovia of course, or Bream playing Study in A Major, PLEASE do listen
to this one. I also do not find Buddy Holly or Charlie Byrd. Again,
they are there, but not on the first hundred or so pages. What you
find is a lot of view counts for people who are YOUNG. That is the
defining requirement. Secondly the musicians are into musical
gymnastics where they tap out their music on the guitar as if it is a
bongo drum or hold it in some unique way and play it like a zither, or
worse yet play loud, and play poorly. That's just my opinion of
course, but that's the whole point. YouTube is obviously most popular
with the young people who are more in tune with the technology and
fewer older folks. The music these younger people like is completely
different than my own. And you know what? My 10-year-old daughter
doesn't like any of the songs either. My boomer songs are ancient, and
the generation X songs are not much better to her. Different
generations. In fact, I forced myself to listen to her IPOD song
list....songs which I asked her to really screen well before
downloading because I have to pay for them. She assured me &quot;these are
all great songs Dad, by the best artists&quot; I listed for about an hour
to all her songs, and I must say, the best thing about them is that I
can't remember a single melody or lyric...OK I remember a couple of
slang references to sex, but not much else.

What else do you think defines generations? dkw

I think tragedies define a generation.  My mothers generation would
ask each other where were you when JFK was shot.  My grandmothers was
where were you when Pearl Harbor was attacked.  For my generation it
would probably be where were you when you heard about Columbine.  For
my little cousins generations it might be where were you on 9/11.

Another way we might define generations is technology, my grandmothers
generation didn't grow up on tvs but her kids sure did, my mothers
generation didn't grow up on computers and cell phones but mine did
what will the next generation grow up with that we didn't?

I don't usually define a generation based on simply the years.  I was
born in 82, which according to some people means I'm generation x
while others say that means I'm generation y.  I have cousins that are
in their late 30s and are considered generation x.  We never had
anything in common because of such a big age gap so how can I be
grouped with them?  They were learning how to drive when I was still
in diapers, they were graduating high school when I was starting
kindergarten.  How can we be considered part of the same group?

If you have to define a generation based on some sort of a time line
then I would go by a decade.  When most people reminisce they think
back to the 60s or 70s or 80s or 90s.  That's how I define my
generation, I consider myself a 90s kid.

It's not any one thing that defines a generation, but dkw and Heather both
make superb points about music and tragedies.

A factor that is playing a bigger part than ever is technology, specifically
computers and the Internet. Not only are they massively changing our work
life, but our social life and our exposure to information too. In this age
of Wikipedia, it's quite rare for people to have what I can &quot;deep knowledge&quot;
of a subject. In the past, if you wanted to find something out you would
need to visit the library and read one (or possibly several) full books to
get your information. Now, you can type a very specific phrase into a little
search box and find exactly what you need. People tend to end up with
isolated pockets of detail in their education, but no deep knowledge or
broader context in which to frame it. I think this is the first generation
to see that, and I think it's bad news.

Thinking about what defined my generation, I would have to say politics
played a huge role. Specially, the nightmare that was Thatcherism. I was
born in '77 and grew up under Thatcher's government here in Britain -- race
riots in London, the miner's strikes, poll tax riots, and endless economic
recession. My parents struggled; they were hard times for our family. It
certainly seeded in me a distrust of conservative governments, both in terms
of social policy and their management of the economy.

I know the feeling...though i'm never sure if it's just bad music, or
the alarmingly inevitable gradual loss of memory function:)

To be fair, there are some very talented modern artists out there.

A great question, fiendishly difficult. I think you know for sure
you've crossed the generational divide when you can see further back
than you can forward.

Good points. I agree generations can be thought of by earth-shaking
events and technology...change in other words. dkw

Yes, in fact technology has been used to broadly describe ages as
well...stone age, bronze age, etc, and in this regard it might be
something like evolution, where some species with can change rapidly,
whereas others change very little over time. At least that's one
theory. dkw

Yes, as it means forget 'missing the forest for the trees', it's hello
'missing the forest due to the chlorophyll in the leaves on the
trees'.  Which is one reason I've started taking my sons on little
nature walk around the woods, pointing out things like which trees,
rocks, minerals, bones (if any) are which, adding as much detail as I
can in order to pass on a little practical knowledge that suburban
'youf' aren't usually exposed to in today's world.  Hopefully, they'll
have a bit more data and a better general understanding of their
environment from it.

I started becoming aware of the news with the Viet-Nam war and
the first President I remember was Johnson, although not terribly
well.  1969, when I was 6, was the first year where I have strong
memories of events.  I certainly remember watching the Moon landing
(another big 'where were you when' event) and I remember hearing about
Woodstock and the murder of Sharon Tate et al.  I was quite influenced
by the hippy era, although more indirectly through my sister, who's 5
years older than me; not that one could tell from my theology...LOL!!
And from Watergate on, I suppose I've kept up with things.  But I find
my earlier years were almost equally defined by music and TV,
especially comedy.  From early on, I remember watching Ed
Sullivan(variety) and The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery (both horror/
supernatural short stories, so 2-3 stories per half-hour).  The
comedies early on were The Smothers Brothers (later replaced by Hee-
Haw), The Sonny and Cher Show and, of course, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-
In.  Then comedy went away for a few years (those years of The Donny
and Marie Show and The Bobby Goldsboro Show) but came back with a
vengence with Saturday Night Live and HBO's Not Necessarily the News.

Ah yes, I remember all those events well, but what I remember mostly
about Viet Nam was meeting a man who grew up in Saigon during the war
and moved to the US at age 14. He talked about going to school under
the French system where they would knock off for a couple of hours and
take a nap...I thought this was the Spanish Siesta or even British tea
time...go figure. Anyway he told me about life in Saigon. I asked him
about the war and he said: &quot;It really didn't affect us&quot; WHAT? My image
of Saigon from the news and movies was this war zone where everyone
cowered in fear of their lives. Not so, apparently. Certainly not for
him.  In fact, he said except for an occasional distant roar of guns
which he thought might have been thunder, everything was routine.
Gosh, perceptions are such misleading ideas. I think you really have
to experience something yourself to know about it. This lesson also
makes me wonder what life is REALLY like in Baghdad. Occasionally I
see news reports with background markets and cars seemingly going
about their everyday business. I wonder how good or bad it really is?
All I know is that my idea of it is almost certainly wrong. dkw

Heh and I always though it was age which defined a generation?

Musicly speaking I of course listen to music from my youth, but I also
get great enjoyment of listening to music form my dads generation, yep
and even his dad's.  I also love most modern music (with the exception
of that crud they now call R&amp; B), which I guess can realisticly be
termed the popular music of the present generation.

I think politics is a better way to define which generation one
belongs to, but technolgy also goes a long way, as does 'perception'
changing news.  Ultimatly though I guess if you where to ask as many
people as you could, it would simply be what they can remember.
