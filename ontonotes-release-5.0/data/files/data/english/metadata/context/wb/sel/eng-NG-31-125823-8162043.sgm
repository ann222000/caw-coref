Has anyone got any sensible ideas of how NE is going to pay the large
premium. Yes fares will rise, but London Edinburgh has airline to
compete with etc. The number of trains is going to increase, so
higher  leasing costs etc. Lincoln is not going to be a large money
spinner, GC will take money from KX to York. The full resturant
service is remaing on the trains. The papers reported that they made a
10m per year loss. Also 8 stations are going to be gated, anyone know
which ones.

Get Richard Bowker to pay it personally if the whole thing goes pear-
shaped? :-) To be honest, I was very surprised that NX could think
that agreeing to pay even higher premiums than those which sank GNER
would make sense. Being a cynic, I wonder if NX are working on the
principle that the DfT won't want another &quot;hand-back-the-keys&quot;
debacle.

On the subject of gating, I would imagine that Durham, Peterborough
and Newark NG must be prime candidates, as they have regular barrier
checks.

What I had not really appreciated is that the £1.4bn is over a shorter
franchise length than the old GNER bid.  Thus the payment profile is
much higher than for GNER - I think a rough guess in an article in Rail
Manager On Line suggested that NatEx will pay DfT £500K a day (!) for
the privilege of running the ECML service.  I have to say I am
struggling to see quite how the economics will work - especially with
the &quot;investment&quot; expenditure on establishing new routes and getting
trains refurbished is in the early part of the franchise.

They must be banking on some heroic growth numbers and also their
ability to get the train paths they need (not guaranteed apparently)
while keeping Grand Central and Hull Trains in check. They must also
hope and pray that Network Rail can keep the overhead wires dangling in
the air rather than collapsed on the tracks or wrapped round a
pantograph.

The final element is how and when the &quot;cap and collar&quot; provisions about
gain / risk sharing kick in. It remains to be seen how these provisions
will work on any of the new financially aggressive franchises but my
hunch is that the train companies have got the better side of the deal
just when it becomes really very hard for them in terms of their premium
payments. It'll be interesting to see if any of them actually meet their
profiles.

The situation is actually much worse than that, because GNER were
supposed to pay £1.3 billion over ten years, whereas NXEC are supposed
to pay £1.4 billion over only **eight**.

I know the premium profile changes over the length of the franchise,
but a comparison on the basis of average (arithmetic mean) annual
premium payments gives the following figures:

GNER: £1,300,000,000 / 10 = £130,000,000 per year.
NXEC: £1,400,000,000 / 8 = £175,000,000 per year.

That's a difference of £45 million per year, or a whopping 34.6%
increase in average annual premium payments over what GNER were
supposed to pay.

Ouch!!

Surely that is a bit unreasonable.  It might be cheaper to hire a taxi

Perhaps, of course, they want people off the trains and into the air

How will they pay for this - let me guess
Increasing car parking charges
Reducing availability of off peak tickets by redefining terms such as
&quot;late morning&quot; and afternoon
Relieving passengers of valuables by staff dressed in Lincoln Green
uniforms whilst transiting Nottinghamshire aka Penalty Fares.
Closing ticket offices to facilitate above
Aggressive negotiation of staff terms and conditions resulting in a
collapse of front line passenger interface
Adopting a Ryanair attitude to customer complaints
Unbundling fares to include signalling supplements, excessive baggage
charges and tips
Bitter and pedantic &quot;not me governor rows&quot; with other TOCS and the
infrastructure provider
Increasing fares to price off excess demand
Answering the question how much is the fare to Peterborough with the
answer how much have you got?
Soaking the Rich - After the next election suggesting a wizard scheme
whereby season ticket prices rise in line with other fares - plays
well in the home counties who will not vote for existing government
anyway.
Taking legal action for libel against passenger watchdogs who dare to
criticise the business model adopted by the TOC and condoned by the
DfT
Creative accountancy is always a useful last resort.

Not sure what point you're making. If you think all fares will rise to
silly levels then I doubt it. Trains will have empty seats if that
happens. The pressure to offer segmented prices and service offers will
continue because they need bums on seats to bring in lots of
discretionary marginal revenue. I'd not be surprised to see an East
Coast train version of what Nat Ex do with their coach ticket pricing.
I would agree that &quot;turn up and go&quot; passengers are those who will feel
the financial squeeze from higher fares.

I don't think it has anything to do with a policy of transfer to roads.
I think the government has decided it can no longer afford nearly £6bn
per annum from general taxation to support the railway.  This is why
everything is screwed down so tight in terms of specifications and also
why they've decided to play the private sector at their own game.

DfT and Treasury have sussed that the big transport groups are desperate
to get their hands on big cash flow businesses like railway franchises
and are prepared to pay to do so. This is why we've seen the apparently
crazy bid values for recent franchises because it's a game of who blinks
first in the negotiations. DfT seem to have learnt not to blink very
much. If demand for rail travel and the economy generally continues to
grow then the franchisees might just get their money. If there is blip
then I think the government will find the funding demands go up via the
cap and collar mechanism.

That one's not likely, as air is moving away from it under duress from

Not good in the long run. I work in the mobile industry, and the
stupid payments for 3G licences means that we now have 18 and 24 month
contracts, reduced commissions for dealers (so independent dealers are
making way for high street network-owned retailers that use pressure
sales techniques to sell to you), minimum call charges, ridiculous
international call charges (and even the EU action to reduce roaming
charges only affects Europe - so you still pay through the nose for
calls outside, or calls from the UK to abroad), fair use policies that
sting you if you exceed your 'unlimited' bundle, charges for itemised
billing, voice mail, calling customer services, not paying by direct
debit and on some networks you're even charged to receive a
confirmation that your text has been delivered. The list goes on and
on and on.

When One 2 One (now T-Mobile) and Orange launched, they 'broke the
mold' by offering a combination of free voicemail, per second billing,
free itemised billing, free calls to 0800 numbers and cheap
international calls (that were still cheaper than today unless you're
paying up front for sort of international package). Now they've done a
U-turn and re-introduced many of these charges or created new ones.

I do thefore believe every TOC paying a large premium for a franchise
will adopt some rather unpopular tactics to recoup the money. They
HAVE to and, worse, are EXPECTED to by the Government.

Off topic, John, but I disagree with you about at least one mobile
operator - T-Mobile.  Their Flext tariffs offer remarkable value.  For
£35 a month I get 900 minutes, any network, any time, or 1800 texts,
or any combination thereof.

If you travel a lot outside the EU, and use your phone a lot, it is a
simple matter to buy and install a local SIM card, or get an
international SIM that still offers good savings over the T-Mobile
roaming charges.

I have just upgraded my phone on a new 12 month contract and the new
phone (a four-band PDA with built-in GPS and 2.0MP camera) retails at
£300.  I think this is remarkable value for money.  For an extra £30
could have added SatNav software, but I chose instead to buy the
market leading software for £58 and it works fine.  So I now have
SatNav, a PDA and a camera phone, all the things I need in one
package.

As I think I've mentioned elsewhere, I suspect part of the purpose of
the York/Lincoln additionals will be to create additional capacity for
the likes of Newark and Grantham while allowing more of the Leeds
services to be speeded up.  Many of these already run more or less
full to capacity-the difference will be that these will now be full of
people from Leeds and Wakefield paying £70+return rather than from
further down the line paying less.  There's a limit to how much you
can grow Edinburgh and further north as markets because internal
flights start becoming competitive for business travellers on
expensive, so I'd imagine the new franchise will see Leeds in
particular as its growth market.

&quot;Lincoln is not going to be a large money spinner&quot;. Hull Trains grew
the Humberside market, and perhaps NatEx noticed this and hopes to
grow the Lincoln market. Lincoln is an important regional centre, and
of course it can add revenue from Grantham and Newark, where the
Lincoln trains will call - these stations have experienced huge growth
in passenger numbers, as NR's RUS documents.

If Leeds trains are to be speeded up through missing out stops covered
by the additional York and Lincoln trains, this will add revenue -
faster journey times always produce increased revenue.

I hope the new 2-hourly Lincoln service will run throughout the day.
NatEx's 'One' Railway's through trains to/from Bury St Edmunds and
Lowestoft generally don't run (except a 0925 arrival at Liv St from
Lowestoft) in the morning and evening peaks.

It's good that Lincoln is to get direct trains. What about
Middlesbrough? Teesside is a huge conurbation without direct trains to
London. GC will go to Eaglescliffe, which is nearer than Darlington,
but is still not Middlesbrough. GC seems to be aimed mainly at
Sunderland and Hartlepool rather than Teesside.

Hull Trains has looked at Lincoln in depth and has never applied to go

while growth in patronage may occur, all that seems to be happening is
that the &quot;Leeds stopper&quot; is to be divided into two trains - one train

yes, cos it sees a much larger market there, given the cost of running

There are not many people choosing to live within walking distance of
Middlesbrough station.  Who can blame people for not wanting to?

Given that the vast majority of passengers will go to the railway
station by road, Eaglescliffe is actually a good choice.  It serves
the whole of Teesside, not just Middlesbrough, and there is easy
access from the A66.

Other ghood choices would have included Thornaby and Yarm, the latter
already being quite a popular park and ride.  But I assume that Grand
Central were not allowed to use either of those stations.

I would be surprised, but I don't know, if the new franchise has (had)
any affect, save that NXEC is now going to Lincoln. I thought the HT had
discounted the northern half of the route you show (which it looked at
for lack of paths Pterbro-Newark) because it was so slow, and were going
to Liverpool St, an idea that stems from when HT was part of GB which
ran Anglia, because of pathing issues into KX.......but it still had the
problem of getting thru P'bro,which was hard.  HT seems to have gone
quite quiet since First took over, except for continuing success to
Hull, and of course it is now well over half way through its track
access agreement.

No, but having split the trains you have twice as many seats to sell.  If
growth is really 15%/year &quot;on key intercity routes like east coast&quot; (as
reported in the Sunday Times article today) and it continues then demand
will double in five years.

The price you manage to sell the seats for will then determine the success

I think First taking over 80 per cent of HT led to any
lets-explore-new-markets moving solely Renaissance Trains who own the
other 20 per cent.  Renaissance have proposed at least three other Open
Acces operators -
http://www.renaissancetrains.com/renaissance-trains-projects.html

I would imagine that in order to make a Cleethorpes-Lincoln-London
service pay its needs to be quick, or at least not that much slower than
existing services.  The fact that one of their major markets (Lincoln)
is now going to have a two-hourly direct service to London means that
fewer people are going to want to go via the slower route unless it's
significantly cheaper?  It puts more emphasis finanically on
Grimsby-London, and they will be served by ICEC+TPX via Doncaster and
ICEC+East Midlands Trains via Lincoln/Newark (a better service than today).

Perhaps the DfT should have got the Lincoln services to start back at
Grimsby?

Phone calls are almost nil-cost, and texts are ridiculously cheap
(and, you'd have expected that when messaging started at 5p a shot on
some networks, it wouldn't now be 10 or 12p; Costs usually reduce over
the years!). It's easy to offer bundled minutes, as the most important
thing is revenue per month - and you're paying £35, which is pretty
good for T-Mobile. Flext is indeed probably the best value deal
around, but T-Mobile is reducing the allowances, starting with the 12
month deals. Make the most of it!

T-Mobile has also got the excellent Web 'n' Walk deals. On prepay,
this meant capping charges once you spent £1. Fine and dandy, until
recently they changed it to be a FLAT rate of £1. What? Now once you
go off the T-Mobile portal, it's a quid for doing anything! Then
there's the 10p minimum call charge. Believe me, operators are
desperate to find new ways to make money, so your average bill will
remain the same - or higher.

Yes, but most people don't do it. For a start, it means giving out

If you look at the capacity studies by Network Rail (available in
quite a bit of detail on the FCC website), it seems that there are to
be quite a few changes in the inner and outer suburban areas to allow
more paths. One such change in the morning and evening peaks will be
changes to the Letchworth trains (313s in the evening, 365s in the
morning - usually) as the 313s are too slow. Solutions could include
new rolling stock (321s?) or stopping services short - so they don't
choke up the Digswell viaduct. In fact, there are lots of options but,
rest assured, the timetables will be radically changed in the next few
years.

In the meantime your costs have doubled, and GNER is still advertising
heavily in the local press a £16 Leeds-London return. A bid predicated
on 15% annual growth going on for much longer is indeed optimistic,
assuming that means passenger numbers and not revenue aided by large

profile is:

Year   1 2 3  4  5  6 7  8
Year ending 31st March Notes 31-Mar-08   31-Mar-09   31-Mar-10   31-
Mar-11   31-Mar-12   31-Mar-13   31-Mar-14  31-Mar-15

200,937  255,137  283,177  311,276

Note:

1 Franchise Payments are taken directly from the Franchise Agreement
and represent the sum of the fixed, RPI and AEI related payment
elements in 2007/08 prices.
2 Nominal Franchise Payments are determined by applying DfT's forecast
of RPI and AEI to the Franchise Payments in the Franchise Agreement.
3 The Present Value (PV) of Nominal Franchise Payments are calculated
using HM Treasury's real discount rate (3.5%) adjusted for inflation.

2. Revenue Share/Support:

Revenue Share - If actual revenue out-turns between 102% and 106% of
target revenue, then 50% of the excess between 102% and 106% will be
shared with DfT. If it out-turns above 106%, then 80% of the further
excess will be shared with DfT.
Revenue Support - If actual revenue out-turns between 98% and 94% of
target revenue, then DfT will provide support equivalent to 50% of the
shortfall between 98% and 94%. If it out-turns below 94%, then DfT
will provide support equivalent to 80% of the further shortfall.
Revenue support arrangements only apply after the first four years of
the franchise.

Yes, that's the one.

I have noted your comments above, but I am really happy, both with the
phone and with the deal they gave me.  If I was with Vodafone, O2,
Orange or 3, I would be less than happy.  I have been with all of
those operators at one time or another, and their deals just don't add
up for the kind of usage I need.

The fact that calls/textx cost the phone company very little is
absolutely not the point.  What is the point is that they have
invested massively in the network, and they need (and are entitled to
expect) to get a return on the capital invested.

I don't mind paying for that as long as what I get in return
represents good value for money *for me*.   I am not asking you or
anyone else to approve, because I'm the one paying the bill.

One complaint   that I do have is that all cell phones, regardless of
network, often seem to work badly on trains, with some trains worse
than others - the Voyagers being very poor indeed.

1.9BN  1.4BN

These [gner] figures, although not adding up to 1.3BN are the same as
quoted by Christian Woolmar: &quot;£58m this rises to £164m by 2010 and a
staggering £396m in the year to March 2015.&quot;

Net present value seems to be the key:

&quot;When GNER retained the franchise last month, it declined to
reveal the profile of premium payments, citing commercial
confidentiality. At the time it would only say it was paying
£1.3billion over the life of the franchise.

&quot;However, that sum was &quot;a net present value&quot; calculation, which
is adjusted for inflation. In today's money, GNER has undertaken
to pay £1.94billion over 10 years. Last year it paid £22m to run
the franchise, which has current annual passenger revenues of
£410m-£420m.

&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/04/18/cnrai
l18.xml&gt;

Maybe someone could do us all a favour and if this is true, convert the
NXEC figures into &quot;today's money&quot; values.  Here's my attempt (using a
straight line interest rate that transforms GNER's 1300M into 1936M):

2006    58
2007    36
2008    81       -8
2009    114     101
2010    164     163

2014    344     479
2015    396     563
1936    2220

Also from the telegraph article: &quot;Over 10 years, GNER expects to make
£190m profit from the franchise, which averages out at about half what
it is currently making.&quot;  but only £19M a year.

Just diving in here - sorry I'm a bit late on the story but I've been
on a little holiday.

All I can add in is that the NarEx bid was the LOWEST of the four in
terms of payments to the DfT/Government.
Arriva was the highest.

I understand that much of the rest of the deal is very similar to that
proposed by the other bidders - this was a highly specified bid in
terms of timetable, rolling stock and even catering provision.

So - whatever is put into place its roughly what we'd have got whoever
won. BUT I do expect performance to improve significantly - but then
looking at some of the reasons behind GNER being rooted to the bottom
of the performance table I'd expect any of the four bidders to have
improved matters!

&gt;&gt; &gt; 10m per year loss. Also 8 stations are going to be gated, anyone know
&gt;&gt; &gt; which ones.

&gt;&gt; Get Richard Bowker to pay it personally if the whole thing goes pear-
&gt;&gt; shaped? :-) To be honest, I was very surprised that NX could think
&gt;&gt; that agreeing to pay even higher premiums than those which sank GNER
&gt;&gt; would make sense. Being a cynic, I wonder if NX are working on the
&gt;&gt; principle that the DfT won't want another &quot;hand-back-the-keys&quot;
&gt;&gt; debacle.

&gt;&gt; On the subject of gating, I would imagine that Durham, Peterborough
&gt;&gt; and Newark NG must be prime candidates, as they have regular barrier
&gt;&gt; checks.

&gt; Just diving in here - sorry I'm a bit late on the story but I've been
&gt; on a little holiday.

&gt; All I can add in is that the NarEx bid was the LOWEST of the four in
&gt; terms of payments to the DfT/Government.
&gt; Arriva was the highest.

&gt; I understand that much of the rest of the deal is very similar to that
&gt; proposed by the other bidders - this was a highly specified bid in
&gt; terms of timetable, rolling stock and even catering provision.

&gt; So - whatever is put into place its roughly what we'd have got whoever
&gt; won. BUT I do expect performance to improve significantly - but then

Yes, but my point is that T-Mobile are reducing the allowances,
introducing minimum charges and so on. Now you've signed your
contract, you should be fine (and if not, you can cancel at any time
when they increase certain charges by certain amounts). In other
words, Flext isn't going to be as good in the future.

Normally, things get cheaper - but the mobile industry is trying to
make things more expensive. In many ways, they're succeeding because
the operators are all happy to increase charges together (cartel
anyone?) just as they did with roaming charges before the EU - finally
- intervened.

That's the solar reflective film to reduce the heat (and aid the air-

the same film. Virgin are working on a way to improve coverage
(presumably some sort of external antenna with internal repeater) I
believe. When Wi-Fi is added, you'll at least be able to get the
Internet via that - and if GNER goes free for all classes in December,
then I suspect Virgin will go free too. However, that introduces a new
problem; the company fitting Wi-Fi was going to do it FOC and recoup
the investment via usage charges. If Virgin opts to go free, who will
pay to fit it?

&gt; These [gner] figures, although not adding up to 1.3BN are the same as
&gt; quoted by Christian Woolmar: &quot;£58m this rises to £164m by 2010 and a
&gt; staggering £396m in the year to March 2015.&quot;

&gt; Net present value seems to be the key:

&gt;         &quot;When GNER retained the franchise last month, it declined to
&gt;         reveal the profile of premium payments, citing commercial
&gt;         confidentiality. At the time it would only say it was paying
&gt;         £1.3billion over the life of the franchise.

&gt;         &quot;However, that sum was &quot;a net present value&quot; calculation, which
&gt;         is adjusted for inflation. In today's money, GNER has undertaken
&gt;         to pay £1.94billion over 10 years. Last year it paid £22m to run
&gt;         the franchise, which has current annual passenger revenues of
&gt;         £410m-£420m.

&gt; Maybe someone could do us all a favour and if this is true, convert the

Great stuff Roland and I am sure you are spot on, another example of the

are in a way capped, if they make more the DfT gets more, and vice versa.

Actually, I think there's a small error in my maths, so I've
recalculated. The figures I posted were inadvertently for &quot;2006 prices&quot;
for NXEC, whereas I think 2008 prices are more appropriate.

So here are the values in real money (not discounted money) for each
year, and the difference that NXEC will pay compared to GNER. Note how
the &quot;slow start&quot; means that the total is only 6% more than GNER's bid,
not 36.4% as claimed elsewhere.

gner    nxec    diff
2006            58
2007            36
2008            81      -7     -108% [somewhat meaningless]
2009            114     88       77%
2010            164     143      87%
2011            208     198      95%
2012            251     261     104%
2013            284     349     123%
2014            344     420     122%
2015            396     493     125%

2008-2015      1842    1946     106%

But it does shown some serious pain kicking in around 2013, after four
years where there's less to pay than under the GNER regime.

That's because they made the basic call charges cheaper and
overshot the amount that is profitable.

15 years ago a minute of call time cost 50p on all networks,
now they are falling over each other to offer calls for 2ppm.

They can't cover their fixed costs at this price, and they daren't
put their prices up because they'll lose market share, so they
have to make the money elsewhere.

FWIW, Orange never in their corporate life made a profit,
their business model (the one which broke the mould) plain
did not work, but no-one saw it at the time.  Now they are
part of a bigger group and their performance is more difficult
to assess, they could still be making a loss year on year.

Calls started out as 33p a minute in the M25 and 25p outside (+VAT),
and 10p off peak. Later, the VAT was dropped (absorbed within the
price) and Vodafone did many deals that offered calls as low as 5p/
minute (Metro Digital). 50p was only on the low user tariffs that pre-
dated pay as you go. International calls on Orange in the early days
were actually cheaper than BT and Mercury, and Orange advertised
heavily that you didn't need a landline to call abroad. Now you would
be mad to use a mobile, unless you pay another £xx a month - and on
some networks, you have to dial a shortcode to make cheap calls (a
real PITA).

Text messages were the life saver the networks needed. Vodafone never
saw the market value when they launched, and even Orange began by
offering it free with a monthly charge of something like £1! When they
realised people would pay to send short messages (and it really took
off when you could send messages to any network, not just your own), I
bet they were very relieved!

Calls aren't actually that cheap now, but you get a load bundled each
month - but you do pay for them in the line rental. People could have
line rental for £9.99 or £15 before but how many do now? £25 offers a
reasonable bundle (albeit very good compared to what you did get) but
operators are always pushing for £35 line rental or above. Then they
add on itemised billing, insurance, data bundles and other 'bolt on'
style offerings.

The question is, what are people paying now compared to 10 or 20 years
ago. It's all down to the revenue, not the number of calls made.

No - perfectly fair - the DfT has to be sure that the bid is
&quot;deliverable&quot; - and several bidders for franchises have confirmed that
if the DfT team think that the &quot;bottom line&quot; is completely
undeliverable they can ignore that bid. Its all modelled against a DfT
Rail base case for the franchise.. which is itself re-modelled as the
bids come in.
Its all tied in with the &quot;cap &amp; collar&quot; protection - where DfT will
take some or most of any profits above a certain level achieved and
will also offer a subsidy of profit targets aren't met. Obviously DfT
isn't going to accept a massively undeliverable bid on the assumption
that it will just prop up the failing company - it is working on the
assumption that it won't have to pay any support - so will want a bid
that, in its view, will deliver about what it promises
Clearly DfT Rail felt the other three bids were just TOO high and it
wasn't prepared to sign off a franchise that had a cast-iron certainty
that it would be baling the winner out in four years time.

I've not heard any of the other bidders complaining - and my guess is
that when they got the feedback from the DfT they were told &quot;there was
no way you were going to get the income you forecast, and we couldn't
accept your projections.&quot; They accepted that they had probably bid too
high and took the decision without complaint.

In the case of one of the other franchise awards two bids were
financially the same - but one included some extra commitments - which
did cause a small complaint by one of the losing bidders as it felt
the DfT had specifically told it NOT to include the commitments that
the winner was now agreeing to deliver.

Arriva bid too much - see the answer earlier - if DfT knew it would
have to step in and give that TOC massive support under the Cap &amp;
Collar protection then it could turn down the bid as being completely
undeliverable.
Its not the first time the highest bid didn't win. First were the
second highest for Thameslink/GN - and Nat Ex offered the highest
payment.

Of course - one of the other aspects was the strong &quot;guidance&quot; given
to bidders that the catering had to remain much as with GNER (pressure
from MPs and other lobbyists). It is possible that Arriva's bid
included too many cuts to the catering - given what is proposed for
XC. Either way we are repeatedly told that the &quot;bottom line&quot; is a key
factor in winning, but not the olnly factor - and DfT has to weigh up
the whole package.

The losers get feedback and as we've not seen one raise a complaint I
guess that the reasons given for not selecting any of the others have
been accepted. I think if there had been a &quot;political&quot; decision the
lawyers would have been in rather quickly!

&gt;&gt; If Arriva bid the highest premium, the franchise should surely have

&gt; Arriva bid too much - see the answer earlier - if DfT knew it would
&gt; have to step in and give that TOC massive support under the Cap &amp;
&gt; Collar protection then it could turn down the bid as being completely
&gt; undeliverable.
&gt; Its not the first time the highest bid didn't win. First were the
&gt; second highest for Thameslink/GN - and Nat Ex offered the highest
&gt; payment.

&gt; Of course - one of the other aspects was the strong &quot;guidance&quot; given
&gt; to bidders that the catering had to remain much as with GNER (pressure
&gt; from MPs and other lobbyists).

Hum,

MP's aren't prepared to subsidise rail services out of Government
money and then they expect a loss making catering service to
be subsidised by paying passengers.  How hypocritical.

Which are these MPs that I have to vote out to get cheaper rail
fares?

&gt; XC. Either way we are repeatedly told that the &quot;bottom line&quot; is a key
&gt; factor in winning, but not the olnly factor - and DfT has to weigh up
&gt; the whole package.

&gt; The losers get feedback and as we've not seen one raise a complaint I
&gt; guess that the reasons given for not selecting any of the others have
&gt; been accepted. I think if there had been a &quot;political&quot; decision the
&gt; lawyers would have been in rather quickly!

Thank you for an exceptionally informative reply.

Now I won't lose any sleep worrying about whether National Express
should have been awarded the franchise!

The one voted in by constituencies along the ECML, I suspect.

No doubt the voters don't equate &quot;saving our catering&quot; with &quot;paying
higher fares&quot;. The tooth Fairy is alive and well and living on the East
Coast Main Line :)

the feedback probably contains the phrase &quot;you lost and if you complain

&gt; No - perfectly fair - the DfT has to be sure that the bid is
&gt; &quot;deliverable&quot; - and several bidders for franchises have confirmed that
&gt; if the DfT team think that the &quot;bottom line&quot; is completely
&gt; undeliverable they can ignore that bid. Its all modelled against a DfT
&gt; Rail base case for the franchise.. which is itself re-modelled as the
&gt; bids come in.
&gt; Its all tied in with the &quot;cap &amp; collar&quot; protection - where DfT will
&gt; take some or most of any profits above a certain level achieved and
&gt; will also offer a subsidy of profit targets aren't met. Obviously DfT
&gt; isn't going to accept a massively undeliverable bid on the assumption
&gt; that it will just prop up the failing company - it is working on the
&gt; assumption that it won't have to pay any support - so will want a bid
&gt; that, in its view, will deliver about what it promises
&gt; Clearly DfT Rail felt the other three bids were just TOO high and it
&gt; wasn't prepared to sign off a franchise that had a cast-iron certainty
&gt; that it would be baling the winner out in four years time.

then Arriva could surely call the DfT's bluff, put their money on the
table and  and renegotiate the cap and collar to give the best
guaranteed price to the DfT..... they can't have it both ways,a though
they clearly have, it's called Buggins.
