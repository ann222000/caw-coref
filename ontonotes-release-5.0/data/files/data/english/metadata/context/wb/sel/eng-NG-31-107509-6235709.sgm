http://girls-gamesfrahmfqck.blogspot.com/2007/02/what-drives-repeat-v...

this post begins with:
"1. High-Quality Content.

We have all read that "Content Is The Thing" according to Michael Dean
of Kittyfeet.com...."

-------

This is hilarious to me, and really shows me why one should "Be
careful what you say on the Internet, because getting rid of it is
like 'trying to take pee out of a pool with a teaspoon'."

Not that I'm ashamed to be quoted on this, but here's the story:

In 1996, I wrote a little blog post on my website (ok, they weren't
called blogs then, but it certainly was blogging by any broad
definition of this newish word.) My blog post was about what I hated
about the Internet (flashy great looking websites with no content, or
hard-to-find content.) It was a little rant saying that people should
instead make simple, easy-to-navigate sites with great content.

No one read it, except some guy who did a "How to market on the
Internet" site, and he quoted me. (His "We have all read..." is pure
hyperbole. Not many people read my site back then.)

The page on my site he was quoting has long long ago been deleted.
Probably nine years ago. And I forgot about his quoting of me for just
as long.

I use Google alerts to do my ego surfing for me now, I have alert
subscriptions for all the terms I used to surf....my name, my
podcasts, my films, my books, my cats, ad nauseam.

The last few days I've gotten ten or twelve Google alerts about
different splogs (fake blogs...created by bots, only to drive up
search engine listings and get people to click on pay-links) that
quote this guy's article from a decade ago where he quotes me.

SO........"Be careful what you say on the Internet, because getting
rid of it IS like 'trying to take pee out of a pool with a teaspoon'."

Are you really that embarrassed by being quoted for saying "Content is
the thing?"  Heck, it's the clearest and most comprehensible part of
that article.  &gt;8-&gt;

There's nothing wrong with being randomly quoted.  No publicity is bad
publicity.  I was amused to learn over a year ago that a doctrine I'd
made up for a satirical religion -- the Faith of the Invisible Pink
Unicorn -- was cited, with my name, in a textbook used in Methodist
Sunday schools:

"Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of great spiritual power. We know
this because they are capable of being invisible and pink at the same
time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is
based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we
logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them."

The same quote's in Wikipedia, BTW:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn

Before Escape Pod, when I Googled myself that was the top thing that
came up.  It was on a couple dozen pages.

==================
Which leads me to the corollary of "Be carful what you say..." which
is, "Any single, random thing you do could be the thing you're most
remembered for."

No, I'm not embarrassed. I liked what I said. I'm just using it as an
analogy of how permanent things can be on the internets, even if we
just say them in passing.

===================
Um....actually, "Invisible Pink Unicorn" still IS your top
contribution to the internets, according to Google:

"Steve Eley" = 27,000 hits on google.
"Stephen Eley" = 20,100 hits on google.
Total = 47,100 hits (and a small percentage of them seem to be guys
with the same name, so let's guess 45,000 of these are you.)

"Invisible Pink Unicorn" = 67,900 hits on google. (That's all you,
brother.)

------
I did mine charts too:

"michael w. dean" =  32,600 hits on google. (and probably 5000 of mine
are splog hits, and probably 1000 are repostings of yahoo pod board
posts on other boards, some of them sploggy.)

"michael dean" + "content is the thing" gives 44 hits on Google, one
of them on a page in Arabic.

"michael dean" without the dubya gives 337,000 hits, and a lot of the
first page are me, but it's a common name, which is why I use the
dubya. There are six published writers named "michael dean". There is
only one other named "michael w. dean", a hip hop guy without a whole
lot of ink, but he's podcasting now too, so he's getting a few more hits.

About a thousand of the links for "michael dean"  without the dubya
are the college football player, "michael dean perry", little brother
of "the Fridge."

Actually, no, it isn't.  I had nothing to do with IPUs as an atheist
movement (which may or may not predate my own participation with them
on the old ISCA bulletin board), or with the various splinter sects,
or with the T-shirts.

My contribution is somewhat minor.  Just that one quotation, and
serving briefly as the Chief Advocate and Spokesguy, and the raisin
bread model of the universe.

That must be something like.....

"The world is a raisin on a slice of raisin bread."

"What's underneath the slice of raisin bread?"

"Another slice."

"But what's underneath that slice?"

"Another slice."

"But what...?"

"Look.  It's raisin bread all the way, okay?"

(With apologies to a big ol' stack of giant turtles....)

Did any of you catch that most of the sites and links mentioned in

Believe it or not, I'd not done my name before.  This is so funny.  When I
enter "george l smyth" into Google, the number one return is a redirect from my
old website back when it was on Comcast's server.

More amusing is that further down the first page is a link to a series of
articles I wrote for ST-Log magazine back in 1989 - I had forgotten all about
them.
