Uncommon Manifestations

&quot;God usually prepares the souls of His people for uncommon manifestations
of Himself by the quickening, sanctifying influences of His good Spirit.
Those who would enjoy communion with God on the Lord's day must endeavor
to abstract their thoughts and affections from flesh and fleshly things,
and be wholly taken up with things of a spiritual nature.&quot; - Matthew
Henry

&quot;The more we abstract ourselves from all corporeal things, the more fit
we are for communion with God; the body is a veil, a cloud, and clog to
the mind in its transactions with God.&quot; - Matthew Henry

So many people settle for so little of God. They are so satisfied just
occupying a pew on Sunday morning - when God is desiring to take them
into dimensions of the Spirit unknown to mankind.

It was said of the Apostle John while on the Isle of Patmos in both
Revelation 1:10 and 4:2 - &quot;I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and
heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet&quot; and &quot;And immediately I
was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and One sat
on the throne.&quot;

In Revelation 1:10, it says about John that he &quot;was in the Spirit on the
Lord's day.&quot; Here, it  is referring to a state of trance or a spiritual
ecstasy. It denotes a divine release from his ordinary ways and an
elevation above the limits of his body and the present world. His
connection with the surrounding objects through the senses is suspended
for a period of time and a connection with the invisible world takes
place. The outer world is shut out whereby he becomes insensible of
outward things. He is so overwhelmed with the power of God and totally
overtaken by the blessed and gracious influences of the Holy Spirit. This
is no normal spiritual condition. He had yielded to a spirit of true and
elevated devotion and entered into a state of high and uncommon spiritual
enjoyment.

Revelation 4:2 relates a similar encounter - &quot;And immediately I was in
the spirit:...&quot; - only this time he finds himself in a higher degree than
before. This time, he was completely rapt in vision into the heavenly
world. The Spirit of God possessed and filled him in an extraordinary
manner whereby his soul and spirit were immediately taken from
consideration of all sensible objects. Once again, all bodily sensations
and actions were suspended. He found himself wholly under a divine
influence.

For John, these were uncommon manifestations of God. They came about
through the quickening, sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit. He met
the criteria of being totally abstracted from the corporeal things of
this world. He abstracted his thoughts and affections from his flesh and
all fleshly things and was wholly taken up with things of a spiritual
nature. As a result, he was lifted into dimensions of the Spirit realm
where he saw and heard things out of this world.

God has the same kind of experiences in store for all believers who will
&quot;pay the price&quot; - so to speak. He has &quot;uncommon manifestations&quot; of
Himself in store for all His children who will go after Him with all
their hearts and divorce themselves from the corporeal things of this
world.

Believe it or not - there are spiritual songs that the saints have yet to
sing...prayers that believers have yet to pray... sermons that Preachers
have yet to preach...Bible lessons that have yet to be
taught...revelations of the Word that have yet to be tapped into...and
ideas for cures or businesses that have yet to be revealed. There are
prophetic dreams and visions depicting the future days that have yet to
be disclosed.

But, the only problem is - who will be found &quot;in the Spirit on the Lord's
day&quot; as John the Revelator? Who will break through the &quot;body&quot; which is a
&quot;clog to the mind&quot; in its transactions with God? Who has abstracted his
thoughts and affections from the flesh and fleshly things and been wholly
taken up with things of a spiritual nature?

Do you hunger for more of God or all that He has for you, or are you
satisfied with your &quot;churchianity&quot;?

The Apostle John was no different from you and me. What happened to him
and the other disciples can and should happen for the rest of us - since
we are disciples and followers of the Lord Jesus as well.

The Holy Spirit wants to &quot;guide us into all truth&quot; and &quot;show us things to
come&quot;(John 16:13). But we must find ourselves in a place where we can
receive from Him.

The Scriptures offer us some guidelines on how to get &quot;in the Spirit&quot; as
John did. They are as follows:

1. Strive After Heavenly Aims Rather Than Earthly Ones

Colossians 3:1 says - &quot;If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things
which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.&quot;

Live for heaven. Set your heart there. Strive to secure heavenly things.
Seek them as objects of pursuit and affection.

2. Think Heaven

Colossians 3:2 says - &quot;Set your affection on things above, not on things
on the earth.&quot;

Don't make the things of this world your aim, goal, or master. Love
heavenly things. Study them. Let your heart be entirely engrossed by
them. Mind them. Think on them. Favor and approve of them. Be
affectionately desirous of them. Esteem them above all other things.

3. Seek Jesus As Your Chief Good &amp; Highest End

1 Chronicles 22:19 says - &quot;Now set your heart and your soul to seek the
LORD your God...&quot;

Go after God. Place your happiness in finding His favor. Keep your eyes
upon His glory. Seek Him as your chief good and highest end.

4. Allow Your Heart To Become Enamored Of The Lord

Psalm 91:14 says - &quot;Because he hath set his love upon Me...&quot;

Be on fire for God. Let your love for Jesus be of the most ardent kind.
Let your heart be taken up with Him. Let it be intensely attached to Him.

5. Root Out The Love Of The World

Psalm 119:36 says - &quot;Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies, and not to
covetousness.&quot;

Allow the Holy Spirit to root out the love of the world and root in the
love of God into your heart. Have no inordinate love for gain of any
kind. The love of money and gain will surely hinder you from receiving
the Word of the Lord and profiting from it.

6. Don't Dwell Upon The Vain Things Of This World

Psalm 119:37 says - &quot;Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and
quicken Thou me in Thy way.&quot;

Don't allow the riches, honors, and pleasures of this world to catch your
eye or allure your heart.

Pastor Henry said - &quot;God usually prepares the souls of His people for
uncommon manifestations of Himself by the quickening, sanctifying
influences of His good Spirit...&quot;

Will you allow the Holy Spirit to take you higher in your walk with the
Lord?

You know that it will cost you something, don't you?

Just how desperate are you for all that God has for you?

May God Bless His Word.
