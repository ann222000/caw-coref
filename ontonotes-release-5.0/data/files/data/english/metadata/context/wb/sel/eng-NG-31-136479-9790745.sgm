Good morning, Friends!

I am going to be very careful how I type... I have a cold.... AGAIN,
and don't want to pass it on!!
Wipe down your keyboards and monitors after you read!

Windy and rainy, here still..sigh. And c-man wanted to come home and
harvest. Now tempers are starting to get testy. They say sun and drier
weather is on the horizon, but it just doesn't seem to want to
materialize.

I am so looking forward to a nice &quot;do nothing&quot; weekend. I have my
projects (knitting) lined up, and that's about it for me. No heavy
lifting, just getting well.

Anybody getting a flu shot? I think I need to get one again. I did
late last year (escaped any early bouts) and I think I'll do it the
first part of Nov this year. Jimmy, I think you do, right?
My immune system seems to be a bit ragged right now, so I think I
won't take chances.

I hate to say it, but I am going to just drag my sorry carcass off to
class and smile like no bodies business for one hour... then come home
and crash!!

I hope you all have an AB-FAB Friday!!

Yippee! Its cold here in Austin, Texas. Perfect running weather. Of
course, it never seems to fail - today is an off day on the Austin Fit
Running calendar and I spent the 6 - 7 a.m. hour in the basement of the
YMCA doing a strength conditioning class. Hoping it stays cool until
tomorrow when we run to St. Edwards University.

We have two eight month old kittens and my sister sent us a box of
Halloween costumes for them. The kids had a great time dressing them up.
CatCat, the male, looked best as Captain Jack Sparrow and Mia, the
female, looked best as the Candy Witch.

My dad must be rolling over in his grave double time. He always
considered dressing animals in human attire to be the ultimate form of
pet abuse.

Simba, our twelve year old tabby, would have nothing to do with such
foolishness and hissed at anyone who came near him

Tonight we are traveling to San Marcos to attend the Grand Opening of a
Natural Furniture Store (Its owned by the Assistant District Attorney
who handles CPS cases in Hays county.)  Who says the Williams clan
doesn't know how to have a good time?

Chili here this a.m. as well Glenn.  I am toying with the idea of
hitting the 9 oclock class near my home this morning.

ME, so sorry to hear you are under the weather.

Allison, congrats due to you for you recent appointments.  You must do
a great job, else the principal would not have selected you for those
positions.

Glenn, too funny about the cats and your dad.  My mother always swore
her cat could talk to her.  Cat was smart as a whip, could turn on
water, flush the toilet, and open the cabinet with her food in it.  So
maybe she did converse with my mom, who knows.

It's Leah's birthday this weekend and we are taking her to a really
nice restaurant for dinner.  She is excited.  She's getting a nice
piece of jewelry that was handmade by an artist in Colorado.

The Mister and myself are traveling to Ft. Worth tomorrow for our last
summer musical.  It's a Cirque themed performance which I will love.
The couple we go with doesn't care for that kind of thing, so they may
be miserable.

I have a family reunion of sorts in the country on Sunday.  Some of
you may be able to relate.  Many many many years ago, families that
owned the cemetery there in the country would pick a Sunday of the
month and go and tend maintenance to their families plots.  They would
bring a covered dish to share and everyone would have lunch there.
Well, we now have a company that maintains the plots, but we still go
once a year to have the meeting and make a payment for maintenance of
the cemetery.  We still take covered dishes and have lunch.  It's a
really nice time.  I will place flowers at my mom's site and have a
moment of prayer and reflection.  Then it's back home to start a new
week.  The Mister does not come along for this activity.

I've just about worn out my welcome, so I will be leaving and getting
ready to hit the class.

Take care all and have a great weekend.

On Oct 19, 7:47 am, &quot;WILLIAMS, GLENN H&quot;

TGIF!  ME, feel better soon.  I already got my flu shot - a doctor
came to the building and we lined up like military recruits, rolled up
our sleeves and got stuck.  Nobody cried.

Root rot eradication this afternoon.  Whoo hoo!

Car's back from the shop - very expensive trip - $0!  Love those
warranties!

Glenn, hope you're running in the a.m. before the temps climb back
toward 90!  It was simply lovely this morning - dry and cool.

Have a good one!

I'm a slacker -- I slept in till 7:30.  Woke up long enough to kiss
the mister goodbye, then rolled right back over.  It's the first time
in a week or so that I slept so late. Since it's cloudy and
threatening rain I had no motivation to get up and at 'em.  Tomorrow
is a hilly hundred mile ride from UC Davis to Napa and back, right
through our neighborhood, along some of our favorite roads.  So
there's plenty of working out in my future.

I have &quot;costumes&quot; for the boys; TH was appalled that I purchased such
things but admitted that they did look awfully cute when dressed.
Beau has a striped t-shirt with an embroidered ship's steering wheel
and &quot;Captain&quot; on it; Oliver's is an anchor and says &quot;First Mate.&quot;
Yes, I'll take pictures.

No flu shot here -- haven't gotten one in 5 years.  Every year I get
one I have a reaction.  So, what's the point?

Hope you feel better soon, ME, and get that harvest done.  What are
you harvesting this late, anyway?

TGIF!

Congrats to Ms. Allison!

OMG, I have the rest of today and all of Sat/Sun off.  I found someone
to work the Jazzercise booth for me tomorrow at the Boo at the
Columbus Zoo.  Heading to PA this afternoon to help the folks out (and
probably won't go back till Thanksgiving.)  I have to enter some EFT's
and then call to transfer my account to the new owner.  It happens
instantly, so I gotta print off all reports and paperwork I might
need!

Still warm here (in the 70's) and breezy!  Got up early enough to have
a good breakfast before class (boy what a difference that makes.)

Everyone have a great Friday!

ME: I'm wearing a mask over my mouth and nose AIT (as I type)!  After
you come back from class and get ready to relax, I recommend a snuggle
with a kitty.  That always works wonders for me.

A couple of years ago at Christmas, I tied a bow around Babette's
neck. If looks could kill .... I guess you have to teach them
early ... although she eventually got used to the t-shirt she had to
wear while we were tube-feeding her (my, seems like a long time ago!).

Well, I'm still working on Hubster to get lil' Scooter in.  But every
time one of our cats has an &quot;accident&quot; in the house, her prospects
dim.  Sigh.

coco: about your yearly trek, that reminds me of a someone in my
husband family who attended a well-attended wake.  When she left, she
said it was the best time she ever had.  The funny thing is everybody
understood what she meant (and no, she wasn't happy about the death.).

We're taking the flu shot ... if we remember.

Off to start the day.  It's cool here, so pretty soon, I'll have to
forgo my afternoon reading session on the patio.

No shot here, allergic to eggs so it's contraindicated.

ME - Hope you're feeling better.  I have my little group of meds I
take whenever I've got a cold and need to teach.  Like you said, put
on a happy face then crash at home.

Pet costumes?  We don't normally do them, though our dog frequently
gets dressed up.  Last year the child created a Rudolph outfit and
even tied her sled to the poor animal.  Marsailles loves the attention
and sits very still for the costuming.  More often than not she sports
hairdo's and capes of various sorts.

coco - I thought your chilli day meant you were making chili!  It's
been awfully stormy here and the chili sounds great.

Did you get the email warning you not to return any area code &quot;809&quot;
numbers on your cell? Charges will be in the thousands of dollars.
Very hard to get it reversed, too. I think it's best not to return any
calls, unless you are sure of the person you are calling. Why take the
chance.

It took me over 2 hours to get home from nursing home last night as a
young 19 year old lad (that I think was either high on life or high on
red bull or high on something else) plowed into my rear end on an
extremely busy section of the road. I know it will cost over a couple
of thousand to fix my rear end, but he probably did way more damage to
his car. He was driving a Jeep Cherokee and he had no front drivers
headlight or fog light left and his front fender and hub over his tire
was bent so bad the tire was scraping against it. We waited for about
75 minutes for the police to come because he couldn't produce me his
registration. (He said he didn't have registration?) Finally after all
that time he called his Dad (he didn't want to tell his Dad as it was
his Dad's car and he is going to college here-his Dad lives about 6
hours away) and his Dad told him where the registration was. I
reported it to the Police station today and started the long
procedures with the insurance company to get the car fixed.

So, I was pretty late getting to the Trendy Totes party last night.
Decided I deserved a new tote after all that aggravation and found a
cute one from Texas of all places. I just love it. I am going from a
fanny pack to this big purse that is like a briefcase and it is brown
fabric with bright turquoise polka dots and bright turquoise handles
and even a polka dot bow. I will be able to take everything with me,
now and I haven't seen anything like this in the stores.

Sue: good thing you weren't on your way to teach class!  Sorry about
the extra troubles, but I had to laugh at BEJ's comment about your
rear end!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Did you get the email warning you not to return any area code &quot;809&quot;

&gt; Very hard to get it reversed, too. I think it's best not to return any
&gt; calls, unless you are sure of the person you are calling. Why take the
&gt; chance.

&gt; It took me over 2 hours to get home from nursing home last night as a
&gt; young 19 year old lad (that I think was either high on life or high on
&gt; red bull or high on something else) plowed into my rear end on an
&gt; extremely busy section of the road. I know it will cost over a couple
&gt; of thousand to fix my rear end, but he probably did way more damage to
&gt; his car. He was driving a Jeep Cherokee and he had no front drivers
&gt; headlight or fog light left and his front fender and hub over his tire
&gt; was bent so bad the tire was scraping against it. We waited for about
&gt; 75 minutes for the police to come because he couldn't produce me his
&gt; registration. (He said he didn't have registration?) Finally after all
&gt; that time he called his Dad (he didn't want to tell his Dad as it was
&gt; his Dad's car and he is going to college here-his Dad lives about 6
&gt; hours away) and his Dad told him where the registration was. I
&gt; reported it to the Police station today and started the long
&gt; procedures with the insurance company to get the car fixed.

&gt; So, I was pretty late getting to the Trendy Totes party last night.
&gt; Decided I deserved a new tote after all that aggravation and found a
&gt; cute one from Texas of all places. I just love it. I am going from a
&gt; fanny pack to this big purse that is like a briefcase and it is brown
&gt; fabric with bright turquoise polka dots and bright turquoise handles

LOL, BEJ. Yes, let me clarify.....that would be the car's rear end and
not mine. Although a couple of thousand $$ worth of work on my rear
end would probably make me look years younger. :-)

I don't know if your rear end needs *that* much work, Sue.  &gt;ducking&lt;

Glad you're okay.

I'm off to bed so early because we have our last organized (read:
We've paid for it) century tomorrow.  We leave Davis at 7 a.m. and
hope to be back there by 1, but since we haven't done a ride this long
since August (please, let us be upright the entire ride), we may be
slower.

Then our son is due to come over to talk about moving home.  Life
takes many twists, doesn't it?

So, happy Saturday!  May your classes be full and your workouts be
fun.

We'll be looking on the bike side of life.  (c;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and don't want to pass it on!!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wipe down your keyboards and monitors after you read!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Windy and rainy, here still..sigh. And c-man wanted to come home and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harvest. Now tempers are starting to get testy. They say sun and drier
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weather is on the horizon, but it just doesn't seem to want to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; materialize.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am so looking forward to a nice &quot;do nothing&quot; weekend. I have my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; projects (knitting) lined up, and that's about it for me. No heavy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lifting, just getting well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anybody getting a flu shot? I think I need to get one again. I did
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; late last year (escaped any early bouts) and I think I'll do it the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first part of Nov this year. Jimmy, I think you do, right?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My immune system seems to be a bit ragged right now, so I think I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; won't take chances.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hate to say it, but I am going to just drag my sorry carcass off to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class and smile like no bodies business for one hour... then come home
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and crash!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you all have an AB-FAB Friday!!- Hide quoted text -
