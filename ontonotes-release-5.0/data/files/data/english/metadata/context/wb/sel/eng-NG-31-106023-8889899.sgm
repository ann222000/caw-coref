MangumTC'ers,

Just wondered how many of you folks planned to run either the 20 or 40
mile event in February? I have signed up for the Umstead 100 and was
looking at Uwharrie as one of the last long training runs. To you
veteran ultra marathoners...would that 40 be spaced too close together
with Umstead? Definitely do not want to over train...

Matthew,

I plan to run Uwharrie and the Mount Mitchell Challenge before
Umstead.  With proper diet you can recovery from those races prior to
the 100-miler.  I would also like to run at least 3 training runs on
the Uwharrie trail prior to that event.  Dec and Jan should be a good
time for that.  I will post info about those training runs to this
board if any others would like to join us.

I will see a bunch of you at Hinson Lake this coming weekend for the
24 hour event.  Ton Gabell has a record crowd coming for the event.
You can see the list here http://www.hinsonlake24hour.com/

Shouldn't be a problem for you Matthew. I ran three 50k's and a marathon
from Jan to March before my first 100 at Umstead and you are much younger
and in better shape than I.

Unfortunantly, there is no Uwharrie for me again this year/

Matthew,
Should be plenty of time between them. Just watch the ankles. I love
Uwharrie though despite having my best falls ever there.

This past year, I ran NCFA 50 Mile(Jan), Uwharrie 40(Feb), Holiday Lake(Feb),  MMC 40(Feb), Umstead Marathon(Mar), and Ellerbe Marathon as hard as I could til I blew up at mile 20 and limped in with cramps the week before Umstead 100. This was the 1st time in 4 attempts I finnished a 100 and sub-20 hours to boot! I subscribe to the RayK more is better camp! ( as long as you're not gettting injuries)
