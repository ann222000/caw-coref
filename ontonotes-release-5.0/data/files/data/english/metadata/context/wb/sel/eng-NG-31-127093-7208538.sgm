Ok, take thhe emotion out of it and give me your opinions on the
following. I am asking this for a friend of mine (really people). It's
a little complicated and I think she is getting bad advice.
**********************************
Circumstances

Father presently has physical custody

Mother has joint custody

Father is remarried

Father makes around $55,000 a year

Mother makes around $30,000 a year

Two kids

At present, the kids live 50% with Dad and 50% with mother, although
there is no support order.for either and Dad has full physical custody.
He also travels a lot for his job but as I said, he is remarried.

Mother has history of illegal substance abuse (meth) and served jail
time for it (fairly recently too-hence custody). She is however, in a
recovery program and now attending night school to finish her degree.

They live 1/2 mile apart.

Father does not abuse them, no history of drug using, kids love both
parents. Pretty normal guy, remarried.

She has asked him to help buy little things for the kids..normal
stuff..backpacks, clothes, etc. He reminded her he has cuustody and
said he will fight it
**********************************************************************

She is being advised to go for custody and child support and her lawyer
and friends say she could win. I think she is going to end up getting
screwed. As of right now, no support order exist, and she has the kids
50% of the time..more than the order stipulates. I think he will
certaiinly, if brought back into court, ask for support from her. My
advice to her is to leave things as it is for now, get more recovery
time under her belt and then go for joint physical custody and forget
the support..to call it a "draw"

Don't be judgemental on this. Just what do you guys think?

Would have to know how the kids are doing with the current arrangement.  If
they are thriving, then neither parent should shake the tree, if not that's
a different issue.

Going to court to try to extort some amount of money from the father would
not be good for anybody.  What does she get if she "wins"?  On the other
hand, if the mother is not being irresponsible with her money, and is asking
for truly small amounts, then the father should try to be generous and chalk
it up to the cost of being a parent.

Hey Ray, thanks. Kids are doing great. See both parents all the time,
love them both and neither is pissing away money. Her state calcs
support off of both incomes, If she wins, she gets arouund $750 a month
in support. If he wins (if it stays the same and he finally asks for
support), he would get $350 a month. My advice was go for joint
physical and settle ona reasonable amount betweem $150-$350..or better
yet, not to do anything and as an exconvict/addict, be happy she even
see's her kids at all.

----------------------------
My advice is to /not/ give her any advice. Why? Chances are good,
50-50 I'd say, that whatever you say will turn out to be wrong.  But
if you want to put yourself out there, what she needs to know is that,
unless she can prove that he is unfit to be a parent, objectively, not
just in her opinion, w-some identifiable harm, it ain't gonn'a happen.

She may well find herself paying CS, have less time with the kids,
and now have a judge pissed with her for taking time from his golf
game. =R=

The judge is likely to stay with the current arrangement because change
affects kids. In most cases there has to be a strong reason to upset
the current arrangement e.g. abuse, neglect etc and it has to be
substantiated. Is it worth risking lessparenting time with her kids
over relatively little money? I wouldn't think so. If the kids are well
adjusted and doing well with the arrangement as it is then its in the
kids best interest to keep things stable and thats what both parents
need to put first.
I am not sure why the lawyer thinks she will win. Perhaps because they
are only hearing part of the story but lawyers are trained to enter
disputes sticking up for one side. In this case, both parents need to
get their priorities straight i.e. the kids otherwise they are the ones
that suffer from a combative court process.

Sounds like its already a draw. Is there a reason why the father won't buy
small things for the kids? I have joint custody with our son and he stays most
of the time with me. If he needs something, he'll get it. I pay no support to
the X.

I tend to agree with you, for a lot of reasons. First, it sounds like
the dad is letting her have the kids 50% of the time not because of a
court order, but out of the goodness of his heart. If she pushes in
court, she could very well loose both the court action *and* his
goodwill in that regard.

Also, she's still in a recovery program, going to school, and generally
faces an uphill process of trying to get her collective shit together.
The time and freedom to work on herself that she enjoys by not having
the kids full time is--in the long run--more important and valuable than
any child support she might get in the extremely unlikely event that the
court were to reverse itself and award her full custody.

Finally, she screwed up her life through her own choices, and if she's
experiencing financial hard times because of it, it's not fair, right,
or even conducive to her long-term development as a healthy human being
to expect her ex-husband to bail her out.

She should pin her financial hopes on getting through school and getting
a better job. In the meanwhile, if she doesn't think the kids have
enough clothes or they need backpacks and dad's such a big meanie that
he won't buy them, there are things called thrift stores and garage sales.

Dad has physical custody and won't buy the kids a backpack? Sounds like an
unreasonable statement originating from Mom? How old are the kids?

WTF is she thinking? She's a recent drug abuser. I hope the dad goes the
John Mcenroe way and makes sure that the kids are staying residing with him.
He should be commended for even giving them to her 50% of the time. I mean,
damn.

A judge, any judge is going to turn her down until a sufficent period
of time has passed and the judge is sure the durg use is history. If
she get's the degree, a job and sets up a stable environment for a
year, her chances would be much better.

Dont forget that ANY time a court gets involved the outcome can be what
you want or something terribly strange! Sounds like the present
arrangement works OK. If you try to get something in writing it may work
or it may backfire. Some courts might see the past discretion and give
full custody to dad and mom would get kids less or some would just say
kids belong with their mother as it used to ALWAYS be.

Choose wisely weedhopper. (-:
