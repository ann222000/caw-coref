I still have a few jars of canned pears left from last year.  Anyone have a
creative use for them?  I used a couple of cans and made a pear crisp but it
wasn't a big winner.  I'd like to get them used up before the pears on the
trees are ripe.  Not that we're going to have enough to can this year mind
you.  Husband attacked the trees with his pruning shears and it wasn't good.

OK, I reread this after posting.  You don't need to be in that big a
hurry to use them, especially if you don't have a large crop this
summer.  I'd just make sure I used the FIFO principle. I wouldn't toss
them unless they'd been around for three years ‹ and then I sure as heck
wouldn't put up any more.  :-)

&gt; Mom was just talking about this 2 nights ago. Only diff was that she'd put
&gt; a dollop of cream cheese in the cored half pear, then cottage cheese, a
&gt; couple of slices of canned peaches and then a bit of sour cream on top. As
&gt; a kid I didn't like the ice berg lettuce leaf, but the rest was great!

I used to make bunny salad.  Lettuce leaf, then upside down canned pear
half.  Use two cloves for eyes, red hot for nose, almonds for ears and a
little dab of cottage cheese for the tail.

Caramelized pears

Strain out the pears and simmer the juice in a wide pan, uncovered.
It will start to darken at some point as the water cooks out and
the sugar begins to caramelize.

Add the pears back in and continue cooking until the &quot;sauce&quot; is
thickened and fully caramelized and the pears are cooked through.

Serve hot with a scoop of ice cream on top.

Because I never see a recipe for them.  I asked about them last year and
nobody seemed to think I could can them.  They may be what I used for the
papplesauce.  I can't remember now.  At any rate, I am not canning them this
year.

Daughter loves canned pears.  But in cute little single serve cups or small
cans that I can tuck into her lunch box.  MY canned pears are another
matter.  Last year after we'd put them all up, Alberston's had a sale on the
little cans.  She stood there jumping up and down and pleading with me to
buy them for her lunch.

I used to make caramelized pears from a recipe in a Julia Child's cookbook.
They were poached from scratch, and I believe they were left whole.  I think
the pears were poached in one pan and the sauce in another.

I don't think the juice from my pears would caramelize too well since I made
extra, extra light syrup.  And we have a dairy allergy, so ice cream is out
of the question.  But thanks!

A favorite of mine was canned pears with chocolate sauce on them.  Nobody
else in the family liked it though.

Sorry -- fruit sauce.  Canned pears in a dish with some of the juice

IIRC, I used to eat them (in the 60's) atop a lettuce leaf with a small
dollop of Miracle Whip in the center and a little grated &quot;rat cheese&quot;
(sharp cheddar cut from a wheel at the butcher shop) over the top.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I still have a few jars of canned pears left from last year.  Anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt; have a
&gt;&gt;&gt; creative use for them?  I used a couple of cans and made a pear crisp
&gt;&gt;&gt; but it
&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't a big winner.  I'd like to get them used up before the pears on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; trees are ripe.  Not that we're going to have enough to can this year
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind
&gt;&gt;&gt; you.  Husband attacked the trees with his pruning shears and it wasn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; good.

&gt;&gt; OK, I reread this after posting.  You don't need to be in that big a
&gt;&gt; hurry to use them, especially if you don't have a large crop this
&gt;&gt; summer.  I'd just make sure I used the FIFO principle. I wouldn't toss
&gt;&gt; them unless they'd been around for three years &lt; and then I sure as heck
&gt;&gt; wouldn't put up any more.  :-)

&gt; I thought they had to be used up within a year.  I guess I'm safe then.  I
&gt; don't think I will have any to put up this year.  The bartlett tree is the
&gt; one he attacked.  I see a few pears on there but certainly not enough to
&gt; put up.  The other tree has some pears but I believe they are Comice.  I
&gt; don't think they can be canned.

Your pears from last year will start to lose quality, but they are still
safe to eat.  If you keep them long enough, they won't be worth eating, but
will probably still be as safe as they were when they came out of the BWB.

Last year the only pears available to me were Comice, so I canned them.
They are a bit softer in texture than the Bartletts and not grainy like the
Bartletts sometimes get.  They did turn slightly pink in the processing, but
it's very slight.  We decided we like them better.

Okay.  Thanks!  If I ever get a ton of those again, I will can them.

&gt; &gt; With a dollop of cottage cheese in the center, atop a lettuce leaf.  Top
&gt; &gt; the cheese with a maraschino cherry.  Right out of the 1950s.  :-)

&gt; &gt; Puree and cook to fruit butter consistency.
&gt; &gt; Dice and combine with other fruits as &quot;sauce.&quot;

&gt; IIRC, I used to eat them (in the 60's) atop a lettuce leaf with a small
&gt; dollop of Miracle Whip in the center and a little grated &quot;rat cheese&quot;
&gt; (sharp cheddar cut from a wheel at the butcher shop) over the top.

That's the way Mom makes them with a substitution of Mayo for the MW and
topped with a cherry.

Take your favourite lamb stew or curry recipe, and add the canned pears.
Yum!

Works well with other meats too, and well complimented by spices such as
clove and cardamom.

Sorry but lamb or curry aren't very popular here.  I have no favorite
recipes, nor would my family eat such things if I did make them.  Whenever
I've tried to add fruit to dinner dishes, they don't go over well.  But
thanks.

&gt; &gt; try putting them in a blender or food processor with some berries and
&gt; &gt; make fruit leather.

&gt; &gt; Vicky

&gt; Ooh!  Or even smoothies.  But it wouldn't have much distinct taste
&gt; unless other berries were added.

IMLE berries and pears arent good smoothie partners. The best thing to
do with pears is make pancakes and put pears and chocolate mousse on,
with optional dollops of cream cheese.

Pears make a nice snack on their own too, like yogurt, if stored in
suitably small/tiny containers.

Pear pie, pear cobbler, pear tarts, any dessert that can be made with
apples or peaches can be made with pears.
