Queen of Arabia: Janabe Khadijatul Tahera binte Khuwailid (s.a.)

Ayesha narrates that the Kuniyyat of Janabe Khadija (s.a.) was Umme
Hind (Tabaqate Ibne Saad Waqedi vol. 8 pg. 8) She is from the Quraish
and her ancestry (the third one) goes back to the pure ancestry, which
continues to give shelter to the Islamic nation even today and for
whom the holy Quran declares:
'...a good tree, whose root is firm and whose branches are in heaven.'
(Sura-e-Ibrahim : 24)

Her father Khuwailid b. Asad b. Abdil Uzza b. Qasiyy. Qasiyy was also
the ancestor of the Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.s.). Janabe Khadija's
(s.a.) and the Holy Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) ancestry unites in Qasiyy.
Her mother was Fatima binte Zaidah. Her maternal and paternal
grandparents are the same. The lineage of her grandmother and her
great grandmother joins to the ancestral lineage of the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.s.) (Ibne Hesham and other historians). She was also well-known
by the title of 'Tahera' (the pure one) as she was from a noble and
honorable family which was distinguished by its members and their
virtuous traits.

With her father's demise all the responsibilities fell on her tender
shoulders. Despite being a woman she remained undeterred with this
tragedy and struggled intensely to handle all responsibilities. Allah
had bestowed her with pure lineage along with beauty and wealth.
Possessing even one of these characteristics is sufficient for a woman
to earn respect and admiration. Janabe Khadija (s.a.) possessed all
the three characteristics and this made her the most sought-after
woman in the region. Handsome youths of Arabia, renowned warriors and
chiefs of the tribes were eager to marry her. But the creator had
already chosen another man for her. Janabe Khadija (s.a.) had a large
trading business, which had expanded from Syria to Iraq. Her business
was established in Arab and non-Arab countries. After her father's
demise she had to choose between continuing the trading business and
closing it down. She decided to continue the business.

She could continue the business because she possessed innate patience
and self-control to face the difficulties and problems of business,
which was predominantly a man's domain. She kept this trade working in
the benefit of those workers who earn their livelihood through it. The
death of her father had robbed her of happiness and created a feeling
of desolation in her.

Once Janabe Khadija (s.a.) was observing her friend worshipping the
idols in a monastery. A Jew happened to pass by from there while
reciting some couplets from the Torah - The news of the Prophet's
(s.a.w.s.) advent, the last fruit of Ibrahim's tree (of lineage), so
soon before the night followed the day. When the sun rises it will
leave no scope for the moonlight, he will come and he will definitely
come, O Maidens of Quraish!

This was a small message uttered by the tongue but it pierced the
heart. Only Allah knows from where that Jew came and where he went.
His recitation of the awaited prophet reverberated in the heart of
Janabe Khadija (s.a.). The woman worshipping the idols gave another
opinion about the Jew's prediction but the message had already left a
profound impact on her. She became restless for that sun to rise. She
was waiting for that hour and on the other hand Janabe Abu Talib
(a.s.) was waiting for his nephew to declare prophethood. The Holy
Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) childhood had passed in the loving care of his
aunt and uncle (Abu Talib (a.s.) and Fatima binte Asad (a.s.)).

The Islamic nation helped the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) a little and
offered him a little wealth but Abu Talib (a.s.) gave to the nation a
Prophet like the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). Hazrat Abdullah (a.s.) was
not the father of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.), but deserves to be
respected and honoured as if he was his (s.a.w.s.) father. Hazrat
Abdullah (a.s.) he departed from the world before the Prophet's
(s.a.w.s.) birth. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) was deprived of his
loving care and nurturing. It was Hazrat Abu Talib (a.s.) who
fulfilled these responsibilities as a foster father. Despite knowing
all this, some of the Muslims label Hazrat Abu Talib (a.s.) as a
Kafir. They disregard all his obligation and services in the way of
Islam and the Prophet (s.a.w.s.). But we are Muslims and we recognise
his position and realise that no disbeliever or polytheist can render
an obligation in these matters. Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) with the help of
the flow of Nile reached Firaun's palace. At that moment Janabe Aasiya
(s.a.) was alongside Firaun in the palace. When the basket containing
Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) drifted to the banks of the Nile, it was of Janabe
Aasiya the concealed believer, who welcomed the basket. She was the
one who took Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) out of the basket and she was the one
who nurtured him as her own son. But as God wished, neither the nation
of Firaun nor Firaun himself could refer to Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) as his
son. But the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) who was an orphan, had Hazrat Abu
Talib (a.s.) as his guardian, and even the nation refers to him so.

If in the place of Janabe Aasiya (s.a.), Firaun who was the king of
the time and the owner of the house where Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) was
raised, then history would have accepted him as Hazrat Moosa's (a.s.)
guardian. But Allah does not like the obligation of a polytheist on
His servant. The purity of Prophet Moosa (a.s.) demands that it be
kept far away from the uncleanness of the polytheist's guardianship.
That is why Janabe Aasiya (s.a.) was chosen for his nurturing.

It is quite astonishing that this kind of arrangement for Hazrat Moosa
(a.s.) is considered to be appropriate and for the last Prophet
(s.a.w.s.), the purified one, it is unimaginable that he be nurtured
by a polytheist and that the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) be associated with a
polytheist. Abu Talib (a.s.) was not only a believer but the greatest
well-wisher of Islam. He would always command Hazrat Jafar-e-Tayyar
(a.s.) and others to accompany the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and join him in
prayers and other Islamic acts like Jehad. Hazrat Abu Talib (a.s.)
devoted his entire life in helping the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) in his
prophetic mission.

Keeping the circumstances in view Hazrat Abu Talib (a.s.) advised the
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) to accompany the trade caravan of Janabe
Khadija (s.a.). Janabe Khadija (s.a.) learnt about this and called the
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) if he would accept the charge of her trade
caravan. Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) consented to it and Janabe Khadija
(s.a.) accepted it.

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) was well known for his honesty,
truthfulness and excellent ethics. Therefore it is not surprising
Janabe Khadija (s.a.) selected the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) for her trade.
The most important trait, which is of great concern to a trader when
handing over charge of his/her trade caravan is honesty. She admired
this quality and promised to give double wages to the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.s.) for handling her trade. Under the Prophet's (s.a.w.s.)
trading caravan, Janabe Khadija (s.a.) earned double profit. And as
quoted by Maysarah, the slave of Janabe Khadija (s.a.), - this trade
earned her so much profit than she had never earned so much in 40
years.

Janabe Khadija (s.a.) was at her window when she saw her caravan
returning. She noticed that the entire caravan was traveling under the
hot sun but the leader of the caravan was sheltered by the cloud. When
the caravan reached her house she first looked at the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.s.) and then looked above to see the divine shelter in the form
of a cloud. Janabe Khadija (s.a.) wanted to be convinced that the
cloud is truly Allah's blessing and not a coincidence. So she first
asked the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) the whereabouts of Misar. When the
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) told her that he was with them in the caravan,
she requested him to call Misar. When the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.)
turned to find Misar, the cloud cover also turned along with the
Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and when the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) returned with
Misar, the cloud cover was still accompanying him (s.a.w.s.). Janabe
Khadija (s.a.) was now sure of the Holy Prophet's (s.a.w.s.)
prophethood as she realized that the winds could not change the
direction of the cloud so easily. Then Misar started narrated the
Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) excellent qualities and the meeting with Rahib in
their journey and Rahib commanding them to obey the Prophet
(s.a.w.s.). Misar narrated that the angels were definitely sheltering
him (s.a.w.s.). As evidence Misar narrated some miraculous related to
the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) viz. the food quantity never decreasing
from the blessed hand of the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and such other events.

Janabe Khadija (s.a.w.s.) was very astonished on hearing about these
incidents. She narrated all this to her cousin brother, Warka b.
Nawfal, who was considered to be a very learned person by the Meccans.
Warqa said, 'if all this is true, then definitely Mohammed (s.a.w.s.)
will be the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) of the nation.' In order to testify the
truthfulness of Misar's narration, Janabe Khadija (s.a.) invited the
Holy Prophet for a meal with some other people and she witnessed the
miracle herself (i.e. what Misar had narrated to her).

Seeing the Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) excellent ethics Janabe Khadija (s.a.)
felt a desire in her heart to marry him (s.a.w.s.). She sent a
marriage proposal through her special maidservant Nafisa. Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.s.) accepted the marriage proposal after consulting his
guardian - Hazrat Abu Talib (a.s.). Hazrat Abu Talib (a.s.) before
solemnising the marriage ceremony gave an excellent sermon, which
Allamah Zamakshari has narrated in detail in his book Rabiul Abrar and
Tafsir-e-Kashshaf. When the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) proclaimed
prophethood, she was the first to accept it. Her wealth offered a
financial refuge to Islam at a time when Islam had no wealth. Besides
sharing her wealth, she also shared with the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) his
grief and sorrow. Her high ethical level laid the foundation for the
admirable ethical traits of the Ahle Bait (a.s.), since she was the
grandmother of all Imams (a.s.).

The first to help the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) with their money were
his uncle Hazrat Abu Talib (a.s.) and Janabe Khadija (s.a.). Both
these individuals did not care for their own financial well-being and
bestowed everything in the way of the Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and Islam.

When Janabe Khadija (s.a.) got married to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.),
the Quraishi women severed all relations with her on the pretext that
she had married a pauper. She was spending most of her time in the
house in solitude, but yet she did not complain nor expressed any
anguish at this. This continued till she conceived Janabe Fatima
(s.a.), after which her difficulties increased even more.

One day the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) heard her talking to herself. On
being asked who she was talking to, she replied that she was talking
to the infant in her womb. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) told her that
Jibraeel (a.s.) had informed him (s.a.w.s.),
'The child in the womb is a girl who is pure, immaculate and blessed.
Very soon my progeny will continue through her, and through her
progeny will be the Imams (a.s.), whom Allah will appoint as Caliphs
on the earth after the ceasing of the revelation.'
(Amali-e-Sadooq (r.a.))

Holy Quran and praise for Janabe Khadija (s.a.)
The Holy Quran has mentioned twelve women, one of which is Janabe
Khadija (s.a.). She has been mentioned as the one having commendable
ethical traits. The Quran says to the Prophet (s.a.w.s.)
'And find you in want and make you to be free from want (through
Khadija's wealth)'
(Sura-e-Zoha : 8).

In Sura-e-Kausar Allah has referred to the children from Janabe Fatima
(s.a.), therefore also including Janabe Khadija (s.a.) since she was
the mother of Janabe Zahra (s.a.) and the grandmother of all Imams
(a.s.). Traditions in praise of Janabe Khadija (s.a.)

Janabe Ayesha narrates that the first to woman to accept Islam was
Janabe Khadija (s.a.)
(Tabaqaate Ibne Saad pg. 9).

It is narrated by Zohri that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and Janabe
Khadija (s.a.) prayed Namaz secretly till Allah wished.
(Tabaqaate Ibne Saad pg. 10)

The interval between Janabe Khadija (s.a.) and Ameerul Mo'mineen
(a.s.) accepting Islam is very less and they both were the foremost to
testify in the prophethood of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). In praise
of Janabe Khadija (s.a.) Imam Jafar Sadiq (s.a.) narrates that Allah
has chosen four women above all other women of the world - Janabe
Maryam (s.a.), Janabe Asiya (Firaun's wife), Janabe Khadija (s.a.) and
Janabe Fatima (s.a.)
(Nasikh, vol. 4, pg. 176)

Ibne Hesham narrates from authentic sources that one day Jibraeel
(a.s.) came in the presence of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and told
the Prophet to convey Allah's salutations to Janabe Khadija (s.a.).
The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) conveyed this to her. Upon this Janabe
Khadija replied, 'Allah is Peace (Salaam) and Peace is from Him. And
my salutation is for Jibrael also.' (Sirat-e-Ibne Hesham pg. 106) This
tradition has also been narrated in Sahih-e-Bukhari with slight
discrepancies.

Janabe Ayesha narrates that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) would always
mention about Janabe Khadija (s.a.). He (s.a.w.s.) would never get
tired of praising her and would often seek forgiveness for her.

She continues, 'One day I became jealous of this fact and remarked
that now God has given you a young woman in place of an old woman. I
noticed that he became very furious. I got scared and said to myself
that if Allah cools the Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) temper, I will never ever
say anything bad regarding Janabe Khadija (s.a.). (At this moment),
the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). asked - what was your intention in saying
this. I swear by Allah, Khadija had reposed her faith in me when all
were professing infidelity. She stood by me when everybody forsake me.
She testified in me when others denied in me. Allah gave me a child
through her, whereas you are deprived of this.'

The Holy Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) love for Janabe Khadija
Janabe Ayesha says, 'I was very jealous of Janabe Khadija (s.a.), more
than I was for any of the Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) other wives. I cannot
imagine would have been my state if I was staying with her. My
jealousy stemmed from the fact that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) often
remembered her. When he would slaughter a goat, he would send it to
all her friends.'
(Asadul Ghaabah, vol. 5, pg. 438)

Opinion of Islamic scholars
Janabe Khadija (s.a.) was the true helper of the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.s.) (Sirat-e-Ibne Hesham pg. 16). Ibne Hesham records that the
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) had fixed 20 camels as mehar (dowry) and she
was the first wife of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). As long as she was
alive, he (s.a.w.s.) never married another woman. (Ibne Hesham)

'Janabe Khadija (s.a.) testified to the Prophet's (s.a.w.s.)
prophethood and in all what the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) received from
Allah as revelation. She was a helper in his prophetic mission. She
was the first to accept the faith and testify in his prophethood.
Through Janabe Khadija's (s.a.) companionship, Allah lessened the Holy
Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) grief.

But Allah through Janabe Khadija (s.a.) gave joy and tranquility to
Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). He (s.a.w.s.) was never pained or distressed
with her talks. Rather when he (s.a.w.s.) would come to her (s.a.) she
would encourage him (s.a.w.s.) for his mission and testify to all that
he (s.a.w.s.) said and would tell him (s.a.w.s.) to ignore the taunts
of the infidels. May Allah have mercy on her.
(Ibne Hesham pg. 105, Isteaab pg 12)

Ibne Ishaq says that with the demise of Janabe Khadija (s.a.) and
Hazrat Abu Talib (a.s.), the Holy Prophet's (s.a.w.s.) life became
miserable and grief-stricken. (Asadul Ghabah vol. 5 pg. 439)
