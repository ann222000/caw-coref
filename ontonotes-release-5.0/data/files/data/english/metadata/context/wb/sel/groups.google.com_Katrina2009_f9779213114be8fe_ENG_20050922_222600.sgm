yeah, so? were all in a bad position right now, non of us are enjoying
it and weve been stipped away from our homes and some of the people
weve for a good deal of our lives, thats plenty enough a reason to
complain, though i do agree people are of worse, on the trees in my
backard fell on some dude house i think, or it has just taken up the
enterity of his lawn.
