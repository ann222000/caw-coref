I think it's easy to find a strong definable psychological reason for
Snape to have hated Harry *and* for that hate to endure for year after
sorry year.

Remember from Snape's perspective it wasn't *he* (Snape) who caused
Lily's death... he could even argue, to himself at least, that it
might not even have been Voldemort's fault... even though he
(Voldemort)  was the one who actually committed the act...

... from Snape's twisted perspective the *real* agent in Lily's death
was Harry!!!

Had Lily not been pregnant... had Harry not been born... Lily would
have lived. Therefore Snape had every reason to hate Harry and that
hate would be reinforced every time he looked into those eyes

Every time he looked at Lily's son he'd remember that the *only*
reason Harry lived... was because his mother died!!

And Lily had Harry only because of James, his old nemesis. So it's James
who's the *real* cause of Lily's death, and he wasn't good enough to take
his son with him too.

I was just going to say the same thing.  And furthermore, it was James
who ruined Snape's life (in his mind) by &quot;stealing&quot; Lily from him, and
he hates Harry for being James' son.  Because of the prophecy, he's
forced to help Harry, in his peculiar fashion, in order to get back at
Voldemort -- to say nothing of the fact he's in Dumbledore's back
pocket anyway -- but he hates Harry till the moment he dies.

Snape was revealed at the end to be a sympathetic character --
ultimately a good person.  Snape died as a result of his efforts to
protect Harry.  We may choose not to accept Snape as a good character at
the end just as we may choose not to accept Darth Vader as a good
character at the end.  But the point of both stories is that good won
out, the presumably evil characters saved the day and after their deaths
they were remembered fondly by the protagonists.  Snape made a mistake
when he believed Voldemort would spare Lily, and he spent the rest of
his life doing what he could to make up for it.  He was Dumbledore's spy
in Voldemort's camp.  He fed some information to Voldemort but withheld
the essentials as Dumbledore directed.  He swore to protect the children
of Hogwarts.  He spied and lied and put himself in mortal danger to keep
Lily Potter's son safe.  He killed Dumbledore as an act of mercy. Harry
and Ginny even named one of their kids after Snape.

Snape's true nature was hinted at throughout the books.  His revelation
as a good character is one of the big &quot;reveals&quot; at the end of a story,
like the revelation in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; that Pip's benefactor was
the criminal we met at the beginning.  We are intended to view Snape as
good.  As I said, we may choose not to, and that's our business, but in
the world of Harry Potter Snape turned out to be a good guy.

I would say that in the world of Harry Potter Snape turned out to be a guy
on the good side, not a good guy. Subtle but important difference.

&quot;Good&quot; is too simple.  Snape repeatedly does things that qualify him as
a creep who should never have been allowed to work with children.  My
position before this book came out was that Snape had his own agenda,
known to Dumbledore, that gave Dumbledore reason to trust him.  I saw
nothing in the Pensive to contradict that.  I agree with Harry that it
took courage to do what Snape did, but I think Harry is being to generous
in considering him to be &quot;good person&quot;.

Believe it or not, there're plenty of Real World teachers like Snape. And as
is the case for Snape, the reason for their continuous nastiness lies
perhaps in unfulfilled desires and bitter personal disappointments. Also,
they invariably gave of the feeling that they were stuck in jobs that they
did not like, much like how Snape always wanted to teach DADA instead of
Potions.

Given how they named one of their children, Harry and Ginny clearly
disagree with you.  This is a fairy tale, a children's story.  There are
good guys and bad guys, white hats and black hats.  Any ambiguity you
want to assign to the nature of Severus Snape comes from your mind, not
JK Rowling's.  She has told us that contrary to what we may have
believed (due to her clever storytelling), Snape always had Harry's best
interests at heart.  If you cannot acknowledge that we are supposed to
be surprised and pleased at the end to learn Snape was a good guy after
all, I'd say the problem is less with you than with Rowling.  She
pounded us over the head with the notion that Snape is good when she
dramatically revealed the next-generation Potter child's full name in
the Epilogue. If that's too much for you to accept, then she failed
earlier in the series in her depiction of Snape.

I had no problem with the revelation.  I expected it.

I don't claim it can't be donef because it's a children's story.  I do

Agreed.

I think &quot;good&quot; is just to simplistic a term for Snape.  He was a
complicated character.  The truth that we learn about him is that he
had actually loved someone once, and very strongly; he felt terrible
remorse when he accidentally got her killed; and he spent the rest of
his life trying to keep her son safe (and to destroy the man who had
murdered her, which, given the circumstances, was more or less the
same thing). We know that in following this chosen course, Snape
willingly took huge risks (so we have to give him &quot;brave&quot;), and paid
the ultimate price at the end - and that his final action provided
Harry with the information he needed to ultimately defeat Voldemort.
On the other hand, we also know that, after Lily's death,  Snape
remained a mean-spirited, cruel person who mistreated and insulted his
students at every opportunity, that he made life miserable for Harry
in particular (despite keeping him physically safe), and that he
maintained a murderous grudge against his old school rivals for over a
decade (and was more than willing to see two of them fed to dementors)
- which are not the attributes of a nice guy.  The man was a definite
shade of gray, and doesn't fit well into either the black or white
category.

I think that Ms Rowling is much better at coloring her characters in
shades of gray than you give her credit for.  There are countless
examples of &quot;good&quot; characters behaving badly, and &quot;evil&quot; characters
showing signs of redemption.  Snape is a prime example of both.

She has told us that contrary to what we may have

I was not surprised by Snape's revelation in the pensieve.  It
followed the pattern that Rowling had set up since the very first
book, making Snape a very, very, very nasty man, who despite all the
people he is responsible for killing, never the less convinces
Dumbledore, Harry, and ultimately some readers that he is &quot;more good
than bad&quot;.

The subtext, which I disagree with on moral grounds, is that a person
(fictional or otherwise) can be regarded as having a &quot;good heart&quot;
without actually behaving that way.

I agree.  FWIW, the moral ambiguity is one of my favorite elements of the
books; I find it refreshing, and it tends to make the characters (e.g.
Snape) less predictable.

Yes, it is.  Even when he became Headmaster, to (unknown to Voldy&amp;Co)

I think that at some point, he might have accepted that he was the

eventually, he chose denial and decided to blame someone else, like

Just out of curiosity, are you a fan of the Sopranos?  And if so, did
you think the final scene was ambiguous?  I think it was not and I can
demonstrate why it was not -- to my own satisfaction, anyway.  If you
like, we can go to another newsgroup and get into a nice long discussion
about that one as well.

Uh..  Snape did a hell of a lot more than one &quot;bad&quot; thing.  Remember

&gt; Agreed.

&gt; I think &quot;good&quot; is just to simplistic a term for Snape.  He was a
&gt; complicated character.  The truth that we learn about him is that he
&gt; had actually loved someone once, and very strongly; he felt terrible
&gt; remorse when he accidentally got her killed; and he spent the rest of
&gt; his life trying to keep her son safe (and to destroy the man who had
&gt; murdered her, which, given the circumstances, was more or less the
&gt; same thing). We know that in following this chosen course, Snape
&gt; willingly took huge risks (so we have to give him &quot;brave&quot;), and paid
&gt; the ultimate price at the end - and that his final action provided
&gt; Harry with the information he needed to ultimately defeat Voldemort.
&gt; On the other hand, we also know that, after Lily's death,  Snape
&gt; remained a mean-spirited, cruel person who mistreated and insulted his
&gt; students at every opportunity, that he made life miserable for Harry
&gt; in particular (despite keeping him physically safe), and that he
&gt; maintained a murderous grudge against his old school rivals for over a
&gt; decade (and was more than willing to see two of them fed to dementors)
&gt; - which are not the attributes of a nice guy.  The man was a definite
&gt; shade of gray, and doesn't fit well into either the black or white
&gt; category.

Everything you say here is 100% correct.  But, if I'm not mistaken, you
still accuse JKR of cheating.

? GJW was the most persistent and articulate proponent of the &quot;Snape
loved Lily&quot; theory on this group, although I choke a bit on that still
since what Snape felt toward Lily bears little resemblance to an adult
understanding of &quot;love&quot;.  Regardless, everything GJW said above he
predicted long before the book came out.

What he called &quot;cheating&quot; was the revelation that DD was terminally ill.
He says the evidence for /that/ before DH was thin as pumpkin juice, and
I agree.

So what's to reconcile?

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think it was more his hatred of James, especially since Harry looked
&gt; &gt;&gt; just like his father.

&gt; &gt;Snape was revealed at the end to be a sympathetic character --
&gt; &gt;ultimately a good person.  Snape died as a result of his efforts to
&gt; &gt;protect Harry.  We may choose not to accept Snape as a good character at
&gt; &gt;the end just as we may choose not to accept Darth Vader as a good
&gt; &gt;character at the end.  But the point of both stories is that good won
&gt; &gt;out, the presumably evil characters saved the day and after their deaths
&gt; &gt;they were remembered fondly by the protagonists.  Snape made a mistake
&gt; &gt;when he believed Voldemort would spare Lily, and he spent the rest of
&gt; &gt;his life doing what he could to make up for it.  He was Dumbledore's spy
&gt; &gt;in Voldemort's camp.  He fed some information to Voldemort but withheld
&gt; &gt;the essentials as Dumbledore directed.  He swore to protect the children
&gt; &gt;of Hogwarts.  He spied and lied and put himself in mortal danger to keep
&gt; &gt;Lily Potter's son safe.  He killed Dumbledore as an act of mercy. Harry
&gt; &gt;and Ginny even named one of their kids after Snape.

&gt; &gt;Snape's true nature was hinted at throughout the books.  His revelation
&gt; &gt;as a good character is one of the big &quot;reveals&quot; at the end of a story,
&gt; &gt;like the revelation in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; that Pip's benefactor was
&gt; &gt;the criminal we met at the beginning.  We are intended to view Snape as
&gt; &gt;good.  As I said, we may choose not to, and that's our business, but in
&gt; &gt;the world of Harry Potter Snape turned out to be a good guy.

&gt; Pip's benefactor had reformed... Snape never reformed... just amended
&gt; his nastier side slightly.
">

Off topic aside about &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (and possible spoiler for
the same)
:
When I was assigned this book for high school English class, I had not
read very far into the story before realizing that Mrs. Haversham
wasn't who Pip thought she was.

However, during class discussion over these early chapters, My English
teacher refused to entertain discussion of my theory.  She presented
the story only from Pip's POV, without any higher level analysis.
When I questioned the reliability of Pip's naration, I was accused of
&quot;reading ahead&quot; and pretty much told to shut my mouth.

Just a note, if there are any English teachers out there:  Don't ever
teach that way.

' Snape never reformed'

He did but could never show it other than in very private moments with
Dumbledore. He was 'locked in' to his cover which because Dumbledore
believed that V would return he wanted Snape to maintain. Snape had to
convince all the other DE's who were still around , Malfoy, McNair,
Rookwood and others that he was still loyal to V. he could od nothing
publically 'good' or his cover was blown. The other DE's could remain
'evil' as long as they acted 'good' in public, Snape had the opposite
problem. He probably wanted to cut all ties with his past life but his
commitment to protect Harry meant that his desire to change had to be
buried deep beyone the reach of Voldemorts ability to read his mind.

But neither did he posit that Snape was on the bad side. IIRC, his opinion
was of an &quot;independent&quot;, but anti-Voldemort Snape, provisionally on
Dumbledore side, but ready and willing to strike out on his own, if and
when he found Dumbledore lacking or disagreeable.

He, (gjw), was wrong with his independent Snape theory, but was spot-on with
the fact that Snape was all along anti-Voldemort, (well since Lily's death
anyway).

Unfortunately, Troels just popped in long enough to say that since he
was wrong about a lot of his predictions, anything he might say now
against the book would probably be interpreted as sour grapes, so he
was just going to bow out.

Personally, I hope he reconsiders and posts his views.  He is missed.

No one was right about everything in the book. And Troels had a long,
noble history of being right on most things in past. (As I recall, he
was the only one to come extremely close to guessing the exact nature
of Voldemort's horcruxes before HBP came out.)

His level-headed policy of taking most of Rowling's writing at face
value (with little speculation) worked well for him for the first six
books, and saved him from falling victim to many of the wild-eyed
theories that had been floating around.  The final book was an
exception to the rule because, in order for Rowling to spring her big
surprises, she needed to keep a lot of secrets in the earlier books,
and to indulge in some less-than-logical machinations in the last book
- so that speculation was essential to have any hope of guessing the
ending(s).

I think she meant the ambiguity. One of her acknowledged influences, the
&quot;Dark is Rising&quot; sequence, has a message on this point. Early on, there
are glimpses of a Dark Rider, cloaked in black and on a black horse,
menacing our heroes. Then, late in the series, there are a bunch of Dark
Riders and White Riders, wearing white and on white horses... but
the White Riders are evil too. The message is that the rigid division
into good and evil is itself a tool of the badguys.

You have no problem oversimplifying.
Many of us think it inappropriate.

:&gt;&gt; I think &quot;good&quot; is just to simplistic a term for Snape.  He was a
:&gt;&gt; complicated character.  The truth that we learn about him is that he
:&gt;&gt; had actually loved someone once, and very strongly; he felt terrible
:&gt;&gt; remorse when he accidentally got her killed; and he spent the rest of
:&gt;&gt; his life trying to keep her son safe (and to destroy the man who had
:&gt;&gt; murdered her, which, given the circumstances, was more or less the
:&gt;&gt; same thing). We know that in following this chosen course, Snape
:&gt;&gt; willingly took huge risks (so we have to give him &quot;brave&quot;), and paid
:&gt;&gt; the ultimate price at the end - and that his final action provided
:&gt;&gt; Harry with the information he needed to ultimately defeat Voldemort.
:&gt;&gt; On the other hand, we also know that, after Lily's death,  Snape
:&gt;&gt; remained a mean-spirited, cruel person who mistreated and insulted
:&gt;&gt; his students at every opportunity, that he made life miserable for
:&gt;&gt; Harry in particular (despite keeping him physically safe), and that
:&gt;&gt; he maintained a murderous grudge against his old school rivals for
:&gt;&gt; over a decade (and was more than willing to see two of them fed to
:&gt;&gt; dementors) - which are not the attributes of a nice guy.  The man was
:&gt;&gt; a definite shade of gray, and doesn't fit well into either the black
:&gt;&gt; or white category.

:&gt; Everything you say here is 100% correct.  But, if I'm not mistaken,
:&gt; you still accuse JKR of cheating.
:&gt;
:&gt; Difficult to reconcile.

: ? GJW was the most persistent and articulate proponent of the &quot;Snape
: loved Lily&quot; theory on this group, although I choke a bit on that still
: since what Snape felt toward Lily bears little resemblance to an adult
: understanding of &quot;love&quot;.  Regardless, everything GJW said above he
: predicted long before the book came out.
:
: What he called &quot;cheating&quot; was the revelation that DD was terminally ill.
: He says the evidence for /that/ before DH was thin as pumpkin juice, and
: I agree.

The idea that the blackened hand might be something eventually lethal
could be inferred from PRINCE,but all we're given in HALLOWS to support
it is Snape's making a diagnosis that was never supported by apparent
increasing debility on Dumbledore's part as PRINCE unfolded.If I were
given a year to live by a doctor and was still healthy eight months
later I'd see another doctor for a new prognosis.Dumbledore,however,
set out to make his condition catch up with the pessimism by drinking
poison under circumstances where his dismissal of alternatives was
hard to swallow,so that he would be at death's door in time.

: So what's to reconcile?
:
:&gt; I am happy, at least, that you've apparently accepted Snape's role in
:&gt; things and, perhaps (I hope) can appreciate it.
:
: The only part of Snape's role he missed before DH came out was exactly
: why Snape killed DD.

You assume too much.
