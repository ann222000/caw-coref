Curious as hell about this.

Was taught by the parents to drive in general on a 65 Chevy with an auto
tranny.

Then the parents taught me to drive a stick on a 67 Dodge 3-on-the-tree
Dart.

None of them had a tach.

I presently drive a 5-speed sedan with a tach but I never notice it as I
shift based on what my ear (and obviously "experience")  tells me.

Obviously I understand what the  tachometer is for but.....my friends
and relatives various vehicles are universally automatics and almost all
- depending of course on the options they took - have tachometers on
them.

What's the point of the tachometer on a vehicle with an automatic
transmission?

Seriously, based on my understanding of WHY the tachometer exists, why
are there tachs on vehicles with automatic transmissions?

tach's are in cars today for a very simple reason. they make the idiots who
buy and drive them feel "sporty". it has nothing to do with finding the
shift points.a honda civic is a honda civic. but put a tach in it and a big
wing on the back, and it is a CIVIC!!! see? it gots a tach . now i can go
racing cause i gots a race car!!! its got to be one, cause its got a tach in
it!!

A tachometer on an automatic transmission vehicle can be very useful,
especially for one that is electronically controlled.

If I want to get the transmission to shift smoothly at something like 3000
rpm in each gear, I can gradually accelerate and then let off the throttle
just a bit as the tachmeter nearly reaches 3000 rpm, at which time, the
transmission will shift at the desired RPM's.

Same goes for if I want the transmission to shift at 2500 RPM's or less
(although that's really slow acceleration generally only used in residential
areas) or at 4000 RPM's or more (climbing a bit of a grade). The accurate
shifts at a given RPM can continue to occur until the transmission reaches
its final gear and torque converter lockup subseqently occurs, thanks to the
visual feedback of the tachometer.

After a while, I've learned the acceleration rates for shifting at a given
RPM, so I can maintain the throttle in a constant position such that the
transmission shifts smoothly at the desired RPM.

Without a tachometer, I could judge by engine sound, but not know the exact
RPM's. And, it's also helpful to know when the engine is approaching redline
under more spritied acceleration (e.g., flooring it on a very short
interstate onramp that merges rather than joins with an extra lane, giving
very little distance to get up to the 65mph freeway speed) rather than just
waiting for the transmission to automatically shift to the next gear when
the engine hits redline.

Since my car's specifications indicate a maximum of 126 horsepower at 5500
RPM, there's really no need to exceed 5500 RPM, but I wouldn't know if I
reached or exceeded that max engine torque RPM under higher acceleration
without a tachometer.

Others may vary in their usage or requirements for a tachometer.

Same here.  I use mine all the time for forcing up-shifts and as a
general check on engine performance.  Example: Hmmm...last month I was
climbing this hill in 6th (od), what happened that I am now in 5th?.  I
can't feel or hear the diffeence in the 6/5 or 5/6 shift so see of the
pants is no indicator.

ive found factory tach's handy in diag. some questionable tranny shift
probs.without having to hook up the scanner...shift points, shift slip,

I found it useful to diagnose a TCC problem in my X-car,
I could easily see what RPMs the clutch locked up and
unlocked, and when I noticed that it wasn't locking and
unlocking at the proper RPMs for the conditions I knew
something was up. Sure enough, a few thousand miles later
it failed, but thanks to the tach I had plenty of warning
and was prepared to immediately repair the problem.

Well, if you want to hold a low gear for acceleration up a hill or
something, it's nice to know how hard you're thrashing the engine.

Or setting your idle speed....

Tell you what, why do cars have oil pressure warning lights? I mean, you
know if your car loses all oil pressure, right? The engine grinds to a halt
and seizes...
Why does your car have a temperature gauge? You'd know if it was overheating

It's getting hard to find cars with oil pressure gauges today, and even
BMW is now promoting fake temperature gauges.  Soon, even the idiot lights
will all be replaced by one red light that says REPLACE ENGINE.

A tach is a whistle and bells item mostly these days. I use the one in
my truck towing sometimes because I know what RPM rpm is the most
efficent power and MPG wise when towing a heavy load. There is not
much gained by taking a engine to its power peak because the torque is
usually dropping off fast after 4000 RPM with most V8’s and it will
run the best and use the least fuel if kept within its best torque RPM
range when it is working hard. Also when towing if you are at 2500 RPM
or better under throttle your tranny will run cooler because you are
past the effective stall of your converter and when a tranny is
stalling under load it is making more heat.

If the idiot light for oil is working and you catch it when it first
comes on, you will limit any possible damage. Some people are more
likely to see a idot light than a gage too. The best setup would be
both (gage and light). I remember when cars came with hot and cold
idiot lights too for engine temp.

Probably cheaper to produce one instrument cluster for everybody in
models that can be bought with either an automatic or a stick, as is
often the case.

At the higher end of the market, it's also useful for the growing
number of automatics that you can optionally run by hand.

With LCD's getting cheaper and faster and brighter, I wonder when (at
least in performance cars) they're going to start superimposing a

The implicit assumption in that sort of "rule of thumb" is that you NEED
all the power that the engine can produce. Its a good rule for, say, an
industrial generator engine or irrigation well engine that is expected
to run most of its life at maximum load Cars cruising down the highway
NEVER need all the power that the engine can produce, so they play by a
different set of rules.

Cars have engines that are capable of producing several hundred
horsepower in order to achieve good acceleration, but when cruising
steady-state they require a few tens of horsepower at most. So how do
you run a 300-horsepower engine at an output of 35 horsepower and do it
most efficiently? It turns out that the best way is to "lug" the engine.
IOW, run it so that its way down on the lower RPM side of its torque
curve, but do so with the throttle held relatively wide open at that low
RPM. that's why overdrive works so well. Lugging the engine does a few
things simultaneously:

1) it raises the starting pressure in the cylinders by decreasing the
amount of manifold vacuum. Higher pre-combustion pressure -&gt; more
efficient combustion

2) it allows the spark timing to be retarded. Spark "advance" is really
only needed because when you operate an engine against very high
manifold vacuum (throttle mostly closed) you are LOWERING the starting
cylinder pressure so much that the burn rate is reduced, so that in turn
you need to start the burn very early in order to finish it before the
exhaust valve opens. The downside to spark advance is that a portion of
the combustion cycle is working against the movement of the piston. If
you lug the engine with the throttle open, the pressure is high so the
burn rate is high, and you don't need much spark advance, and therefore
less of the combustion cycle is spent working against the crankshaft.

The proof is in the pudding. If you look at that (otherwise useless :-)
) tach in any modern car, you'll see that when cruising in O/D at 70
mph, the engine is only turning 2000 RPM or even less. And this is
usually with engines that have redlines of 5000-7000 RPM and torque
peaks up at 3000-4000 RPM. By any rule of thumb relating to their
MAXUMUM power, the engines are being operated way, way off optimum. But
for the NEEDED power, they're right in the sweet spot.

Ummmmm, no.  The most fuel-efficient RPM of an Otto Cycle engine is well
below the RPM that will produce the most horsepower.  "Lugging" the engine
is not fuel-efficient, as the engine RPM is too low.  At low RPM, too much
energy is wasted as heat.  (a lesser percentage of energy is converted to
kinetic energy while the engine is lugging)  Overdrive is meant to improve
fuel efficiency at higher speeds.  (OVER drive speeds)  It can't do this by
"lugging" the engine.  It does this by reducing the RPM into a more
fuel-efficient range while still NOT lugging it.  Good example:  My car is
at 3500RPM/43%(redline) and .6 (of max horsepower RPM) at 78MPH in
OVERdrive, where it easily gets 42MPG.  That's just the way it was designed.
If I downshift it to drive, the most fuel-efficient
3500RPM/43%(redline)/.6(of max horsepower RPM) equates to exactly 55MPH.  I
have no idea how fuel-efficient it is at 55MPH in drive, as there is nowhere
near me where I could safely test that.  Even the highways posted at 55MPH
have average traffic speeds well in excess of 70MPH, and it's just not a
good idea to hold a steady speed 20MPH below the flow in any lane.  BUT, I
suspect my vehicle would be quite fuel-efficient at 55MPH, as that is how it
was designed.  The most fuel-efficient RPM of my engine happens to fall
right AT 55MPH, when the car is in drive gear.  No way was THAT a
coincidence, so it had to be by design.

Yet since I learned how to find the most fuel-efficient RPM of an engine, I
have discovered that a lot of vehicles are geared incorrectly.  My wife's
car is one of them.  Her car should be most fuel-efficient at ~ 3400RPM, yet
it is hard to get her engine to even hit 3000 (without driving fast enough
to lose your license), which is the point of maximum torque.  A lot of cars
I've driven have been similarly geared incorrectly.  In one extreme example,
I drove a chevy with a 4-cylinder engine that rarely hit 2000RPM.  It was
horrible, as far as fuel economy goes.  Now I know why.

If "lugging" the engine was such a good idea, I'd expect to see more 7 or
8-speed trannies, both automatic and manual.  That is, there should be more
"over"drive gears to keep the engine running really slow.  But if the car is
geared correctly, only one overdrive gear is needed.  This allows the car
engine to max out the EPA estimate at 55MPH (where it is tested, in drive
gear), and yet still get decent fuel economy closer to speeds that the car
is actually driven.  Thus, more overdrive gears would be redundant on a
street-legal car.  -Dave

A better question would be, "Why do modern cars have useless instruments

Yeah, but an electronic auto trans will force a shift before "redline"
no matter what you do ANYWAY. Hell- go out and get in many new cars (one
I know for certain- Ford Expedition) and floor it in neutral and see
what happens. OK, I'll tell you- the throttle-by-wire revs it up to
about 3600 RPM and it sits there happy as a clam.. Some aren't quite as
graceful- a GM 3800 I had as a rental didn't have throttle-by-wire, so
it just cuts the fuel and the engine will "surge" around 4000 RPM.

A tach would have been more useful in a 1970 car with an automatic than
in a 2005 car with an automatic (not useful at ALL). Muscle cars
frequently got tachs with automatics, because they do come in useful
when manually shifting an auto. But back then, tachs went primarily in
stick-shift cars where they REALLY belong.

And frankly, you have to be a pretty incompetent driver to actually
*use* the tach to decide when to shift on a routine basis. I always
shift by engine sound, although I will check the tach a time or two the
first time I drive a stick car that I'm not accustomed to (insert

Well, my feelings on this subject are mixed.  Your Otto Cycle engine in your
auto-tranny equipped vehicle will be most fuel-efficient in the powerband
range of certain RPMs.  SO, if you know how to find that fuel-efficient
point*, you can try to run your engine at a certain RPM to maximize fuel
economy.   Obviously, if you don't have a tachometer, you can't do this.
But then again, for some vehicles, it doesn't matter whether there is a
tachometer or not.  Take my wife's car for example.  I ran the numbers to
determine where it would be most fuel-efficient.  It should be most
fuel-efficient from 3200-3600RPM.  Problem is, I discovered that 75MPH was
somewhere below 3000RPM with overdrive enabled.  So to get to 3200 minimum
would be ummmmm, not a good idea.  With overdrive OFF, RPM jumped up above
4000.  Basically, I discovered that my wife's car was geared incorrectly.
So in the case of that specific vehicle, a tachometer is useless.  I can't
drive it legally AND keep the engine in the powerband.  -Dave

*  Various sources say 40% of redline, 40-45% of redline, or 60% of RPM at
maximum horsepower RPM.  In the case of my wife's car, this means it will be

In practice, only one cruising-only gear is required for
good highway economy (which, as Steve correctly informed
you, is achieved by lugging the engine at highway speeds).

That's precisely how cars like late-model Corvettes can get
close to 30 mpg with 300-400+ hp.  The manual trans cars are
geared for ~40 mph/1000 rpm in top gear, which allows just
enough surplus power to climb most freeway grades at normal
fuel mixtures without downshifting.  That top gear is
useless for any purpose other than maximizing highway fuel
economy, but it serves that purpose very well.

Say, have you been able to figure out what kind of mpg a
Corvette should get at 125 mph in 6th?  According to your
bogus (40% of redline/60% of power peak/x% of whatever)
rpm-based rule, that should be the sweet spot for fuel
economy, right?  Whaddya think?  40 mpg at 125 mph?

Maybe one day, you'll allow yourself to learn the difference
between engine efficiency and fuel economy, but until then,
I guess you'll have to consider Corvette fuel economy to be
one of those weird Mysteries of the Universe.

&gt; Curious as hell about this.

&gt; Was taught by the parents to drive in general on a 65 Chevy with an auto

&gt; Dart.

&gt; None of them had a tach.

&gt; I presently drive a 5-speed sedan with a tach but I never notice it as I
&gt; shift based on what my ear (and obviously &quot;experience&quot;)  tells me.

&gt; Obviously I understand what the  tachometer is for but.....my friends
&gt; and relatives various vehicles are universally automatics and almost all
&gt; - depending of course on the options they took - have tachometers on
&gt; them.

&gt; What's the point of the tachometer on a vehicle with an automatic

&gt; Seriously, based on my understanding of WHY the tachometer exists, why
&gt; are there tachs on vehicles with automatic transmissions?

They are little more than visual entertainment for virtually all
drivers.  You can watch the needle move up and down as the automatic
transmission shifts itself.  For those who are truly bored or need to
feel in control a tiptronic type automatic transmission in combination
with a tach can provide hours of road-racer-like thrills.

The space could be used more effectively with a good analog clock and a
couple of useful gauges like oil pressure and voltage.

While I don't disagree entirely; a tach is not completely useless.  When I'm
sitting a a light with the stereo up and the car is idling a little rough the
tach might indicate that I'm only idling at 400 rpm.  If I'm at the same light
and the car is idling exceptionally smooth the tach might indicate that the
engine has died completely.  Until I recently diagnosed a faulty idle speed
stepper motor either of these was a regular occurrance.

haven't read the entire thread but looks like this is the first
"correct" answer:

When descending a hill, with the automatic transmission selector lever
in low gear, like "L" or "2", the tachometer can be used to insure you
do not exceed redline and incur engine damage, which when locked
manually in the lower gear is possible.

True for older purely hydro-mechanical transmissions. But name me an
automatic transmission currently made that won't upshift at or before
redline REGARDLESS of what gear is selected. There are probably a few
still out there, but not many.

Please don't take this personally, but if you don't have a good idea
what will happen to engine speed when you downshift a tachometer will
not do much to solve that problem. If you drop it into an
inappropriately low gear the tach will only tell you after the fact
that you screwed up and overrevved the engine. Engine noise will tell
you roughly the same thing.  I would strongly suggest that you just
leave the transmission in Drive and let brakes do the work of slowing
the car.

If you don't know what will happen prior to moving the shift lever a
tachometer won't solve that problem.  You would be much better off
leaving the car in drive if you can't avoid overrevving an engine by
dropping to the next lower gear.

A tach is for the most part low grade visual entertainment - watch the

The above may not (yet) represent the opinions of my employer. I offer the following; it hasn't to do with why or when to use a tach
with an automatic transmission, but rather why there's a tach in an
automobile with an automatic transmission at all.

It's more cost effective for the manufacturer to include a tach in all
models where a tach would otherwise be an option.  As I postulate, it's
cost effective from the design, manufacturing, procurement, assembly,
and all other aspects for the manufacturer, not necessarily the
consumer.  All consumers pay a small price for a gauge few will ever
use, even those with a manual transmission.

This is especially apparent when you consider the similarities (i.e.,
cost effectiveness) among models, not only with the gauges, but also
the supporting electronics as well.

Similar to, but different than...why are automatic transmissions even
offered in certain vehicles, for example: Jeep Wrangler, Corvette, and
4x4 Trucks.  I already know the answer, but it still makes me laugh a
bit when I pull up next to a "sports car" and look down and see an
automatic shifter.

Here's another idea.
After cleaning and adjusting throttle body, removing and plugging a
vacuum line on the throttle stop, the final adjustment calls for
holding engine speed at 2500 rpm, then releasing the throttle and
checking the engine speed, then loosening a small locknut and
adjusting.
Tachometer was helpful.

It could be to make the driver think that the car is "high end" or "sporty".

I can't think of any other reason why a Ford Taurus, which only comes
with an automatic transmission, comes with a tachometer standard, but
a Ford Focus can be equipped with a manual transmission and no tachometer.

In keeping with my prior opinion, consider not just a specif model, but
also...

"similar" models, for example the Taurus and Sable
as well as the
Canadian, European, and other market varieties
internationalization of auto manufacturers, for example Ford and
Mazda - the Probe and MX-6
cross model pollinization

a US model may not offer a manual transmission, but an
international market model may I'd argue that very few people actually need a tach, regardless of
transmission type.  As others have pointed out, with most new
cars/trucks having rev limiters, a tach is a "nice thing to watch", but
not very useful, as well as how many people and how often does one red
line their engine.

I think you can blame market research, focus groups, product testing,
grabbing a piece of the after market pie, business decisions (e.g.,
"I'll give you a deal on 10 million fuel gauges, if you buy 3 million
tachometers."), and just the general American mind-set of wanting
things you don't really need for the reasons why there are tachs in
cars with automatic transmissions.

At this point though, I think most people would notice that they didn't
have a tach...even though they might not have a clue what it does :).
I commend you for noticing just the opposite and questioning the
meaning of things.

Now, if someone can tell me why people don't use their cruise control,
I'd be interested.

Most drivers push on the gas and the electronic transmission shifts
properly and does what it is supposed to and little attention is given
to shift points.  The tach becomes for most people a bit of moving eye
candy as the needle goes up and down betweeen 2,200 and 2,900 rpm in
response to automatic gear changes.

The very limited space available in most cars could be more effectively
used to display a couple of truly useful gauges and a small analog
clock.  Most of us really don't need (or know how) to monitor rpm's and
time shifts accordingly.  Ditching it may not be so easy because the
tach has become such an automotive fixture that if it were eliminated
it would be seen as step backwards.

I have never known this to be the case.  In fact, I was driving a rented
Chrysler Sebring last week.  Found an opening into traffic and punched
the pedal hard.  The tachometer whizzed up, as the engine also whizzed
with a sound like a sewing machine out of control... but the car did not
accelerate whatsoever for a good second after the pedal was pressed.

Is this normal?  It's been more than a decade since I last drove an
automatic.  Do people really put up with this?

I would agree that oil pressure, temperature, and maybe battery voltage
meters would be more useful than a tach... however we are entering a world
where these things are either being removed or replaced with fake meters
that give only a go/no-go indication because it is feared they will confuse
the driver.  Even BMW is now selling cars with temperature gauges that read
cold, hot, and nominal, with no real steps in-between.  This is horrifying.

Can't tell you about that specific car, but it sounds like a mechanical
problem and not one that a tachometer could solve.  If it really took a
full second for the car to begin any acceleration at all then there is
a problem with that vehicle.  The numerous car's I've driven over the
years have all been responsive when consideration is given to the
engine and size of car involved.  A Hertz chevy with a low-end v-6
won't have the same punch as a turbo-charged Volvo S80 T6.  Both will
accelerate when the gas is pushed however.

&gt; I would agree that oil pressure, temperature, and maybe battery voltage

I test drove a Mercedes Benz about 4 years ago that had the poorest

through a couple of menus to find information that should be available
at a glance while driving down the road.

In my experience most cars with auto trannies do this, although of
course some are better than others.  One reason why I hate AT is because of
this.  My husband has a Saturn which is an ok car, but it does this.  When he's
driving and punches it to get around traffic, I usually can't resist a snicker
along with a comment like "the hamster's running as fast as he can, poor
thing", implying he's got a hamster in a cage instead of a combustion engine.
I'm no perfect driver by any means, but I'm still better at timing my
shifts (in my manual Dakota) than his auto tranny is.
I've also noticed a habit many AT drivers have, of punching it and when
the engine finally shifts, they let off the accelerator and slow down, thus
rendering the whole exercise meaningless.

No, that is an improperly designed transmission.  I drive a manual tranny
very well.  The main thing that annoys ME about automatics is that every
single one of them I've driven (dozens) are designed to shift up WAY too
soon.

You can adjust the upshift point somewhat by nailing the accelerator to the
floor.  Even if you do that though, the tranny will STILL upshift too soon.
Or, if you are going slow enough, you could manually shift the auto tranny
down to "2" or "1" until you are ready to let it upshift again.  But if you
have to put so much thought and effort into making the tranny shift right,
what's the point of owning an automatic, exactly?  The manual tranny is
easier to control, if you HAVE to control it.

My point?  Many of these AT drivers you observe, who you thought were
letting off the accelerator, probably were not letting off the accelerator.
More likely, they applied steady pressure to it.  It is the *^*(*&amp;#(
automatic tranny that downshifts for about a half-second only to upshift
again, unless the driver takes extraordinary measures to prevent such
foolishness.

Yeah, there are some automatic trannies designed to be shifted often.
Sometimes there's buttons on the shifter or even steering wheel, and
sometimes the shifter itself can be moved into different gears, kind of like
a clutchless manual.  Call them manumatics or something.  :)  What's the

Most automatic transmissions are adaptive and will modify shift points
to an extent.  If someone wants to play race driver with an automatic
transmission then get one with a Tiptronic-like adaptor.  Several
brands have them.  In my experience most drivers of manual transmssion
cars really don't know how to maximize milage or performance however
and would be better off with an automatic. Most manual transmission
drivers I've seen either hold their car in too low a gear and waste gas
like crazy or don't know when to downshift.  It's a disappearing art
unfortunately.

One more point, many automatic transmission are easy to control.  I can
force mine to start in first, second or third gear as needed for
traction, and can hold shifts for downhill driving, etc.

Now that is an authoritative sounding but truly misleading statement.
Since the power or torque curve is just that...a curve that begins at
zero, any time the transmission shifts above zero it will be someplace
in the power band.  Its a question of where on the curve you want to
shift.  In addition to controlling quickly you can accelerate, the
place you select on the curve will also govern how much fuel you burn
and how much wear and stress you place on the engine.  You appear to
have little concern about fuel economy and engine longevity - playing
the race driver seems to be your focus.

Interesting but rather bizarre statement that is not supported by the
real world of driving that I've encountered.  I drove numerous stick
shifts before switching to an automatic several cars ago.  The
electronically controlled automatic of today does a far better job of
shifting than most drivers I've encountered.  Most guys with manual
shift transmissions seem to like keeping the engine in a lower gear
than needed presumably for the imagined race car thrills from hearing
the engine at 4,000 rpm.

A couple of rules of thumb, gathered from various sources that know a lot
more about car engines than I ever will:

Aim for 40-45% of engine redline

Aim for RPM at (60% of RPM at which engine produces maximum horsepower)

In several cars I've done the math on, these two formulas produce results
pretty close to each other.  For my own car, it works out to (3200 to
3600RPM) or 3480RPM, depending on which formula I use.  Over ten years of
driving this car, I have noticed that maximum fuel economy is achieved at
3500 RPM.  Not coincidentally, my engine is most efficient right where it
should be, according to the experts.  So use either of the above formulas,
and you should be pretty close to where you want to be.  If you can't find
the horsepower/torque curves, you should at least be able to dig up the
manufacturer's published horsepower specs. for the engine, showing (for
example) 150HP @ 5800RPM  or whatever your engine produces at X rpm.  They
always list this by maximum horsepower RPM, so just multiply that RPM by .6
to get a pretty good estimate of what to aim for.

Unfortunately, it might not be that easy if you own a slushbox.  :(  But I
gathered from what you wrote that you have a real tranny, so you should be
all set.  -Dave

gear.

Cruising.  Yes, some cars are designed for efficient high-speed cruising.  I
thought my own car was one of them, until I realized that I was in
OVER-drive.  Shifting down to drive put me at 3500RPM at (ta daaaaa!!!!)
55MPH.  So my car was designed to be most efficient at 55MPH.  That makes
perfect sense, as it has to meet CAFE requirements.  I don't know about your
car, but in over-drive, my most fuel-efficient engine RPM is at 78MPH.
While I doubt your car would be most fuel-efficient at somewhre over 80MPH,
it wouldn't terribly shock me, if that was true.  I've owned several cars
myself that were most fuel-efficient somewhere above 70MPH.  Many people
have observed that their own cars are most fuel-efficient at similar speeds.
This makes perfect sense.  If you designed a car to be most fuel-efficient
at 55MPH in over-drive, it would have a 0-60 time measured in minutes, and
nobody would buy it.  So it's not surprising at all that many cars are most
fuel-efficient at speeds above 55MPH in over-drive.  -Dave

For 99% of us we are just cruising along or accelerating at a moderate
rate.  The shift points in most every car I've driven hold shifts at
around 2,500 or so and thereby balance reasonable acceleration witth
fuel economy.  A simple press on the accelerator shifts down as needed.

OK, I have to ask what the goal is by maintaining an artificially high
rpm all the time.  If you are running along at 3200 or 3600 rpm when
you could be in a higher gear you are wasting gas and inducing more
wear on the engine.

You say that the formulas will get you pretty close to where you want

down the highway at 60mph in 3rd gear to maintain 3,600 rpm what is

Tell that to your local legislators who thought it necessary to mandate that
you waste fuel in order to minimize safety and maximize revenue to the local
governments and maximize carnage on our highways.  In other words, you are
looking at this wrong.  I'd gladly upshift and drive safely at the most
fuel-efficient speed of my engine in overdrive gear, if it was legal for me
to do so.  [Often, I do so anyway.  :)]   But at 78MPH, I am risking my
license by driving in a very safe, sane, logical and fuel-efficient manner
in over-drive.

Yes, I could do 55MPH in 4th gear everywhere.  I would get decent fuel
economy that way.  But I'd have to put up with the extra engine noise
generated at 3500RPM, while it's taking forever and a day to get anywhere.
Plus, it's harder to hold a constant speed in 4th gear.  Because I'm lazy, I
generally shift up to overdrive even at relatively low speeds like 55MPH.
But then, I pay for my laziness at the gas pump.  The only time I get really
good gas mileage is when I'm in a hurry and not as worried about getting
hassled by the cops.  IF I can maintain an average speed close to 78MPH for
long enough, my MPGs go way up.  But again, that's not exactly legal in most

The following service procedures made mine a great deal more
responsive, overcoming the characteristics you describe to the point
that the transmission will hold the gears for better acceleration when
desired to the point of maximum safe engine speed, downshift quickly
when appropriate, and upshift early under light acceleration to
maximize fuel economy.
1) put a piece of 2x4 and a concrete block to hold the gas pedal to the
floor, then check the throttle butterfly valve for full opening at WOT.
I found a cable adjustment that needed to move apx. 1/4". The
transmission shift cable was also linked to the same assembly, so once
the cable was adjusted, the trans.cable was fine.
2) factory service manual lists a number of procedures for cleaning the
throttle body and adjusting the throttle position sensor (TPS) and I
performed all of them with the aid of a digital multimeter including an
audile continuity test. The TPS position was off by a few thousandths.
Once the IDL stop was set correctly, the reading at WOT was fine.
3) there are some tiny orofices in the throttle body that direct vacuum
to the EGR vacuum modulator. After following directions and cleaning
with carburetor cleaner, then blowing out the passages with compressed
air, one of the smaller passages emitted a burst of dark colored fluid
- presumably gum had been occluding that port to some degree if not
completely blocking it.
4) adjust throttle stop at vacuum dashpot with vacuum line removed
according to directions.
As stated, transmission now shifts exactly as one would wish, although
it has taken practice to learn the throttle mapping, so as to be able
to feather the downshift points to activate or not as desired - roughly
between 50 - 60 per cent throttle opening.

I noticed on a vehicle years ago with a automatic overdrive transmission
which will dramatically lower engine rpm to about 2000 to 2200 rpm at 60
to 65 mph at a true longer distance cruising speed outside the outer belt
in rural areas.

I read these on a C body Coupe DeVille Cadillac with both (BCM) body
control module and (ECM) engine control module engineered with built in
on-board diagnostics with a FWD THM440 xmission and HT4100 V8
transverse engine.  The year is not important.

Before the days of Interstates, the best fuel economy was at about 35 mph
due to urban and rural driving habits at $ .12 to $ .17 per gallon.

Very few vehicles had overdrive transmissions, a Uncle once stated a 82
hp.
1939 Plymouth Coupe during WWII he owned got 20 to 21 mpg driving from
Columbus OH to Chanute Field in "Illinois" at 50 to 55 mph.  This Plymouth
Coupe had a flathead 6 engine with a 1 barrel carb, leaded fuel, 3 speed
manual with a 4.11 rear end ratio, and 6.00 by 16 bias ply tires!!!!!

Imagine the true meaning of the "KISS" (keep it simple stupid" principle
with
NO fuel injection controlled by onboard computer, NO catalytic converter,
NO AOD transmission problems, and a $ 845 car FOB Destination delivered.

This topic was recently discussed at length in r.a.d.  In a
nutshell, Dave C doesn't understand the difference between
engine fuel efficiency (e.g., power out / fuel flow rate)
and vehicle fuel economy (e.g., miles / gallon used).

He is under the delusion that the engine's most efficient
operating rpm will coincide with the vehicle's best fuel
economy speed.  I'm still waiting for him to estimate my
car's fuel economy at 125 mph (at his recommended rpm).

If you follow his extremely poor advice, the result will be
excessive cruising fuel consumption.

If you drive a modern car (roughly 1990-up, but true for
most older cars too) in good running condition, save fuel by
cruising in top gear when possible.  Simple.

What the hell does 78mph have to do with anything.  Put the car in
drive and most likely at 60mph the engine will be turning a very fuel
efficient 2,000 rpm or so.  Push the car to 78 or whatever magic number
gets you off and the car will be much much less fuel efficnent.  In
simple language even you should be able to understand the car will burn
more fuel to traverse the same distance at 78mph as it will at 60mph.
That is a well established fact.

Most cars today use torque converter lockups to bring rpms down to
around 2,000 at 60mph and be reasoably fuel efficient.  Most manual
transmissions today have a built overdriven 5th gear if that is of any
help.  Whether the car uses an overdrive or not is not as important to
fuel economy as how factrs like the overall drive ratio, number of
gears available, the circumference of the wheels, the engine power and
size of the vehicle are tied together.

Interesting. My car's redline is 7000rpm, and they quote the
horsepower at 6000rpm. So, the redline suggests a target of
2800-3150rpm, and the horsepower a target of 3600rpm. Sounds

In at least some cars and some scan tools (that plug into the OBD port),
you can get fuel consumption readings at various speeds and gears.  You
can record them and then calculate which speeds and gears give the best
fuel economy.
