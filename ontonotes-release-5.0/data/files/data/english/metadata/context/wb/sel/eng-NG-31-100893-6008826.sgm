= May we have compassion for Allah(God)'s creation so that the
reception of His compassion is attained.
= The Prophet whom Allah/God  has called the compassionate and the
merciful had extremely tender feelings for his own as well as the
outsiders and would feel overwhelming kindness at the most trivial of
things.
(1)  Once a Companion stepped over the Prophet's foot with his hard
leather boot, which caused the Prophet pain and he quickly removed the
leather boot with a slight strike of his whip. The Companion spent
that night in utter remorse over causing pain to the Prophet. Next
morning some people came looking for him and took him to the Prophet,
who said 'yesterday you nearly crushed my foot with your boot,
however, I struck you with my whip to remove you, take these 80 ewes
in return of that [hurt].'
(2)  The Bedouin of Arabia were unrefined people and once a Bedouin
pulled hard at the Prophet's mantle (cloak) which had hard edging and
this grazed his blessed neck. On top of this the Bedouin demanded that
he is given some of the provisions that 'Allah had bestowed the
Prophet'.  When the Prophet asked whether the Bedouin's earlier act
should be retaliated, he replied no, explaining that the Prophet did
not respond to bad with bad. The Bedouin was then given the provisions
as he had asked.
(3)  The Prophet was extremely mindful of the natural disasters that
had obliterated the earlier people and would be acutely aware lest
calamity befell due to any slip-up of his people. Therefore, each time
there was wind or rain he would engage in prayer and would ask the
Muslims to pray as well. He would enjoin not to condemn the wind per
se for it was a source of mercy that carried both calamity and mercy;
he enjoined to seek its good and to seek protection from its harm.
(4) A poor woman who lived at the out skirts of Medina fell ill. The
Prophet would always ask after her and advised that in case she died
she should not be buried until he had said her funeral prayer. When
the poor woman passed away her funeral was brought to Medina late at
night and the Prophet was found to be asleep at the time. Not wishing
to disturb him the people said her funeral prayer and buried her. Next
morning the Prophet asked after her and was told of what had happened.
The Prophet asked to be taken to her grave where he said her funeral
prayer with four takbeers and advised that in future he should always
be informed and that his prayer was a source of mercy for the
deceased.
(5) The Prophet once related that a man who saw a tree branch in the
pathway thought of removing it lest it caused difficulty to any
believer. The man was granted Paradise on this act of his.  He also
told of a man who was parched with thirst and saw a well. He went down
the well and quenched his thirst. When he came up he saw a panting
thirsty dog, so he down the well again, filled up his sock with water
for the dog and brought it up. The Companions asked the Prophets if
there was a reward in kindness to the living creatures. To which the
Prophet replied that Allah indeed forgave the man's past sins.

(6)  Once the Prophet kissed his grandson Hassan and a man remarked
that he had ten children but he had never kissed them to which the
Prophet replied, 'one who is not merciful is also not shown mercy to
[by God].'
Expression of love for children should be out of compassion and that
this attracts Allah's compassion.
(7) Once a man related his earlier deeds to the Prophet, including
taking his young daughter to a well and throwing her it and walking
off to the sounds of 'O my dad, O' my dad', this brought tears to the
eyes of the Prophet. The assembled people censured the man that he had
saddened the Prophet but the Prophet asked the people to remain silent
and said the man was seeking his advice over something very
significant. So he asked the man to repeat his episode, which he did.
Tears kept streaming down the Prophets blessed face and he told the
man that Allah forgives deeds done in ignorance and that he should
make a fresh start.
Significance of the matter was that the man had come to find out if he
stood a chance after committing grievous acts as he had.
(8)  Prophet advised to treat women with good will and kindness. [With
a hearty metaphor] he explained, 'Woman has been created from a rib
and the most crooked part of the rib is the uppermost. If you try to
straighten it you will break it and if you leave it alone it will
remain crooked. So treat women kindly.'
Women should be handled/engaged/employed in the manner that they are
created. Welfare of families depended on overlooking slight issues
relating to women otherwise not only is the household peace destroyed,
one also loses Allah's mercy.
= One should turn to Allah with thankfulness and seek a measure of His
Rahimiyyat (mercy by virtue of God's attribute Rahim), or else one
would be a transgressor if one creates ones worldly idols. [ref:4:37-
Quraan].
= Shirk (associating partners with Allah)  is the only sin that Allah
will not forgive and that by partaking a measure of Divine Rahimiyyat
one is inclined to avoid any overt or covert shirk.[ref 4:49-Quraan]
It is most unfortunate that some Muslims are involved in covert shirk
by idolising the graves of earlier saints as well as by going to
pseudo holy men and mendicants.
=  There seems to be a great trend towards the false beliefs of
sorcery and such like. By absorbing  the spirit of Rahimiyyat (Mercy
of God), these things should be avoided with a noble struggle against
them.
=  Promised reformer, the promised Messiah (on whom be peace) who, in
following the footsteps of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of
Allah be on him) demonstrated extraordinary compassion and kindness to
people. May the master and servant be followed.
= May compassion for Allah's creation be shown so that the reception
of Allah's compassion be attained.

A'isha (Hazrat Ayesha) Mohammed's Nine-Year Old Wife

The paedophile Mohammed married a 6 year old girl, Aisha, daughter of
Abu Bakr.

He married her when she was 6 and then had sex with her when she was
9. Look at all the excuses Muslims make. It just goes to show that
they think Mohammed could do anything he wanted, no matter how sick or
immoral it was

Putting age limits on sex was not really a moral question until modern
times.  Now sex can be seen on par or worse than torture and murder.

So, you are trying to justify paedophillia!
People did  not worship those paedophiles or start wars
or bomb planes to defend them.

Does this compassion extend to the thousands murdered by muslims in the name
of their God? All I know about islam is that it brings conflict wherever it
goes.
