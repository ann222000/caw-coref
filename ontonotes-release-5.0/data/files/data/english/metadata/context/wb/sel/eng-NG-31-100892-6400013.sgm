In another thread devout Kantian Park, gloats and assaults from his
Ivory Tower.

QUOTE
"It is one thing to "refute" Kant, as you claim to do, but a more
difficult task to understand Kant BEFORE attempting to refute him."
QUOTE UNQUOTE.

Notice how that statement was not backed up with any specifics, its
called gloating and assaulting from the Ivory Tower, the mystics do
the same sort of thing when trying to define their god nonsense, its
quite evil in intent.

When a person is blind then it is cruel to gloat that they cant see
when you can, I digress.

Perhaps other Kantians might like to join in, this is just getting to
the interestning bit.

So you (Park in his gloat) are saying that I dont understand Kant when
he clearly referred to space and time "as a priori knowledge", and you
refute it when I say that Kant, referred to "a priori knowledge" as
being or as meaning, "the necessary and universal knowledge we have
independent of
experience"?

I want you to explain then, how the fuck Kant can even talk about time
and space, as being the oxymoronic contradicting crap of *a priori
knowledge* i.e. knowledge man has independent of experience, FFS, if
he could not experience something about them both, in sensory reality,
to talk about?

Are you saying that Kant just had a dream, and or invented these ideas
of his out of the blue?

Explain the process that you reckon Kant must have used to claim
knowledge of something which he claims he cant and or doesn't and or
didn't experience, if it wasn't just a dream?

And then explain HOW ANY of Kant's trash of "a priori knowledge"
differs in principle from accepting any idea without experience of
sensory evidence such as, the claptrap which gives rise to the god
crap.

Hmmmm, obviously we're not talking about the same twit.

One web site

"Kant draws two important distinctions: between a priori and a
posteriori knowledge and between analytic and synthetic judgments. A
posteriori knowledge is the particular knowledge we gain from
experience, and a priori knowledge is the necessary and universal
knowledge we have independent of experience..."

Another web site, which claims to be a translation of Kant's exact
words.

"In what follows, therefore, we shall understand by a priori
knowledge, not knowledge independent of this or that experience, but
knowledge absolutely independent of all experience. Opposed to it is
empirical knowledge, which is knowledge possible only a posteriori,
that is, through experience. A - priori modes of knowledge are
entitled pure when there is no admixture of anything empirical. Thus,
for instance, the proposition, 'every alteration has its cause', while
an a priori proposition, is not a pure proposition, because alteration
is a concept which can be derived only from experience."

*******

Its pretty clear to me, that *a priori* is referred to as knowledge,
indeed, I have yet to find a web site about Kant that supports your
claim that *a priori* is not referred to as knowledge, nothing like
your statement at all, the exact opposite of your claim is more like
the truth.

Answer the question, if space and time are knowledge of what Kant
claims is *a priori*, and given that Kant clearly defines, a priori as
meaning,

"knowledge absolutely independent of all experience"

Kant's WORDS NOT MINE, then explain HOW is it that Kant even KNOWS
what to talk about, in regards to space and time, if he had NOT
experieced something in sensory reality which gave rise to his
knowledge of space and time.

Did Kant have a dream about space and time?

Kant's argument derives, in part,  from Hume's argument regarding causality.
Hume argued that neither necessity nor universality could ever be derived
from experience (and in so doing made a universal statement). Kant saw
Hume's proposition as a devastating debasement of science; if Hume was
correct, then we would never have certainty, and science itself could offer
no better assurance to knowledge than the most specious metaphysics.

This is but a part of the context that MUST be considered if one is to
understand Kant as Kant intended.

In the foot-steps of Locke and Descartes, Kant attempts an analysis of the
objects of our experiences, arguing that if we can uncover some aspect(s) of
experience that can't be thought away or abstracted away, then we have
ourselves both a necessity and a universality. For Kant the necessity and
universality were found in space and time. Since space and time are both
necessary and universal they can't be a part of the Humean world, they must
be of the mind.
So no, Kant wasn't dreaming; rather, he was reasoning. Whether or not he was
right, well... .

The question preceding "In order of time, therefore, we have no

is clearly saying that Kant regards man's knowledge of time as NOT

is saying that man's knowledge of time is a priori, a priori as in HIS
OWN definition, "knowledge absolutely independent of experience"

The ", and with experience all our knowledge begins."

He is clearly sayng that, experience begins with something that he
says previously, man doesn't experience but must just accept a priori.
Bizarre.

You will also note that, and contrary to your claim, Kant DOES mention
*objects* - *awakening* man's senses and he therefore leaves time and
space out as having objects that awakens man's senses.

Indeed YOU said so yourself, according to you (and you're wrong) that
space is not a mass of particles.

That's not even in the same universe as reasoning.

Saying that space and time are needed for things to exist, or that
man's experience required for his knowledge of everything begins with
space and time, is as silly as saying, trees cant exist without man's
knowledge of roots, water leaves and branches, meaningless
metaphysical piffle, which tells absolutely NOTHING of the meaning,
gives NO explanation, no epistemology, no theory, of what it is that
trees exist as.

I am saying that the application of reason to space and time, requires
man to give both space and time an objective meaning, which means to
LINK directly TO SENSORY EVIDENCE.

That BOTH space and time, must be linked directly to and perceived as
originating from matter of sensory evidence, to be identified without
contradiction.

Because if they are not, then they exist as meaningless of the mind
regurgitations of typical Kantian piffle, the identical faith based
nonsense, ideas about ideas about NOTHING substaniated by sensory
evidence, as is used by the mystics and their god nonsense.

&gt; &gt;ourselves both a necessity and a universality. For Kant the necessity and
&gt; &gt;universality were found in space and time. Since space and time are both
&gt; &gt;necessary and universal they can't be a part of the Humean world, they must
&gt; &gt;be of the mind.
&gt; &gt;So no, Kant wasn't dreaming; rather, he was reasoning. Whether or not he was
&gt; &gt;right, well... .

&gt; That is the question, not whether or not Kant happens to agree with

The arrogance and the gloating have all but gone, the white flag now
be there fluttering in the breeze, from being so fucking arrogant,
gloating stuck-up and certain that I was wrong and that I didn't
understand anything about Kant, from telling the world that Michael
Gordge didn't understand the first thing about Kantian's nonsenses,
such as Kant's meaning of his oxymoronic "a priori knowledge" crap.

To now, Park is agreeing with another brain dead Kantian zombie,
Timberina, devout Kanian Park is now saying that, the question is not
whether or not Michael Gordge is right or wrong, but turning his back
on his own absurd regurgitations, Park NOW agrees with Tim, the
question now is, not about Michael Gordge's ideas on Kant, but really
its all about whether or not Kant was right or wrong, why is that
Park?

So lets deal with it, the first paragraph, which sets the scene of his
bizarre epistemology of what he calls, *experience* and is repeated
pretty much word for word by all those who claim to be translating
Kant's piffle.

"THERE can be no doubt that all our knowledge begins with experience.
For how should our faculty of knowledge be awakened into action did
not objects affecting our senses partly of themselves produce
representations, partly arouse the activity of our understanding to
compare these representations, and, by combining or separating them,
work up the raw material of the sensible impressions into that
knowledge of objects which is entitled experience? In the order of
time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to experience, and
with experience all our knowledge begins."

****************

First sentence clear and unambiguous, agree disagree? explanation.

Second sentence, asks a 57 word rhetorical question which serves as
much a statement as to his explanation to say that, *objects* are
required to *awaken* man's senses and cognition, as his meaning of
*experience*.

Agree or disagree? explanation.

He then says *In respect of time therefore...*, clearly Kant is
meaning he wants to seperate man's knowledge of time as being
something as NOT having had his senses *awakend* by *objects*.

Agree or disagree? explanation.

Now read his last sentence again, several times if you have to,
because this is where it all starts to go pear-shaped. You will need
to understand this, so read it again:

"In the order of time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to
experience, and with experience all our knowledge begins."

In his first senstence he says, that all of man's knowledge begins
with experience, he then explains that experience requires objects to
awaken senses, however he then says, that there are no objects that
awaken man's senses for his knowledge of time, here read it again, "In
the order of time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to
experience,"

Now, are you still paying attention? there is an *and* following the
"...we have no knowledge antecedent to experience," to finish off the
first paragraph.

The and, is Kant now saying, that all of man's knowledge actually
begins with *time* HOWEVER, the meaning of *time* Kant says is,
knowledge that is something which is, HERE READ HIS WORDS, "In the
order of time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to
experience,"

Kant is saying, that, all of your knowledge starts with the experience
of something which he says starts without experience, bizarre but
true.

Now Tim, devout Kantian Park waving a white flag, accuses me of using
*mirrors* in my explanation of Kant's piffle, but he didn't
substaniate HOW I was, perhaps you can for him.

You've now regurgiated that totally unsubstaniated accusation and
waved that exact same white flag many times now.

Sooooooo when Kant says that, all of man's knowledge begins with
experience, of which there is no doubt, and when he then says, there
are objects needed to awaken man's senses for him to have his
experiences, and when he then says, and in the exact same paragraph,
that all of man's knowledge of his experiences begins with what Kant
also says, man has knowledge of, but this time its knowledge NOT from
any actual experience (time - bizarre but true) - he didn't actually
mean that?

And I am supposed to be ignorant of Kant just because I dont
understand any of that contradicting mumbojumbo?

I say, if you can understand any of that, then it is you who is
grossly ignorant of non-contradictory identification.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But of course you dont even attempt to substaniate why its nonsense,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; therefore you are only expressing your opinon, which I therefore
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; regard as unsubstaniated crap, anyway.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; He is proposing an epistemology of how we have any
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experience at all.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So lets deal with it, the first paragraph, which sets the scene of his
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bizarre epistemology of what he calls, *experience* and is repeated
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pretty much word for word by all those who claim to be translating
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kant's piffle.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;THERE can be no doubt that all our knowledge begins with experience.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; For how should our faculty of knowledge be awakened into action did
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not objects affecting our senses partly of themselves produce
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; representations, partly arouse the activity of our understanding to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; compare these representations, and, by combining or separating them,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; work up the raw material of the sensible impressions into that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge of objects which is entitled experience? In the order of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to experience, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with experience all our knowledge begins.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ****************

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; First sentence clear and unambiguous, agree disagree? explanation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Second sentence, asks a 57 word rhetorical question which serves as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; much a statement as to his explanation to say that, *objects* are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; required to *awaken* man's senses and cognition, as his meaning of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; *experience*.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Agree or disagree? explanation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He then says *In respect of time therefore...*, clearly Kant is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meaning he wants to seperate man's knowledge of time as being
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something as NOT having had his senses *awakend* by *objects*.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Agree or disagree? explanation.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now read his last sentence again, several times if you have to,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because this is where it all starts to go pear-shaped. You will need
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to understand this, so read it again:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;In the order of time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; experience, and with experience all our knowledge begins.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In his first senstence he says, that all of man's knowledge begins
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with experience, he then explains that experience requires objects to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; awaken senses, however he then says, that there are no objects that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; awaken man's senses for his knowledge of time, here read it again, &quot;In
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the order of time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; experience,&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now, are you still paying attention? there is an *and* following the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;...we have no knowledge antecedent to experience,&quot; to finish off the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; first paragraph.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The and, is Kant now saying, that all of man's knowledge actually
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; begins with *time* HOWEVER, the meaning of *time* Kant says is,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge that is something which is, HERE READ HIS WORDS, &quot;In the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; order of time, therefore, we have no knowledge antecedent to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; experience,&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kant is saying, that, all of your knowledge starts with the experience
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of something which he says starts without experience, bizarre but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; true.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now Tim, devout Kantian Park waving a white flag, accuses me of using
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; *mirrors* in my explanation of Kant's piffle, but he didn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; substaniate HOW I was, perhaps you can for him.

&gt; &gt;&gt; No, why should I? You are under a very unwarranted delusion if you think
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm
&gt; &gt;&gt; here to answer questions for you. Further, you suffer from a pathetic
&gt; &gt;&gt; memory, need I repeat why?

&gt; &gt; Oh looook more white flags

&gt; &gt; MG

&gt; No, again. The contention is that you do not have a good enough
&gt; understanding of Kant,
">

Why dont you have a crack at getting specific? All I am trying to do
is to get a handle on what Kant is actually in non-contradicting
reality saying in his very first paragraph of his silly epistemology.

Here try this, its the same challenge Park is facing.

Sooooooo when Kant says that, all of man's knowledge begins with
experience, of which there is no doubt, and when he then says, there
are objects needed to awaken man's senses for him to have his
experiences, and when he then says, and in the exact same paragraph,
that all of man's knowledge of his experiences begins with what Kant
also says, man has knowledge of, but this time its knowledge NOT from
any actual experience (time - bizarre but true) - he didn't actually
mean that?

Kant calls his diatribe a critique of reason, however when reason is
being applied, then one is supposed to keep and talk about things in
the same context, identify and intergrate real ideas by identification
and elimination of contradiction, and NOT by dropping and mixing
context and introducing and applying contradiction.

Kant talks of the means or the meaning of ALL of man's knowledge
(epistemology) as being, *things* existing (Kant uses *objects*) which
man needs to *awaken* his senses to experience, which is fine, not how
I put it, but its ok and the meaning is clear.

HOWEVER, he then talks about man having knowledge of time, without any
object to experience, he's done two things wrong here, he has just
contradicted himself and he's introduced metaphysics into a topic of
epistemology.

In one breath he gives a *meaning* or explains the theory, the
epistemology of how man goes about gaining ALL of his knowledge, next
breath, he talks as if there is an automatic knowledge existing inside
man's mind, *a priori* he calls it, that just pops into his head
somehow and he wants man just to accept that explanation of time,
without anything like the explanation he has given for all of man's
other knowledge, which is a contradiction of his statement that ALL of
man's knowledge comes from objects.

Your interpretation makes as little sense now as it did before.

Everything occurs in the order of time; and knowledge, which also
occurs through time, comes after experience. But knowledge of time is
also a later development, and Kant never claimed that knowledge of
time is required to have a progressive order of things in time. Formal
time is not the same thing as conceptual 'time,' yet you seem to want
to interpret formal time as conceptual time, thus converting 'time'
into a concept of the understanding. But 'time' is not included in
Kant's table of concepts.

">

Knowledge of time comes with experience -- we learn it from others.
But formal time is simply there, accompanying our first perceptions
of things and always thereafter. Anybody can have a percept without
yet having knowledge of what the thing is being perceived, such
as a native from the African jungles seeing a house for the first
time. In the case of 'time,' it is not a thing but the order of things
perceived. Formal time accompanies all perception, whether or not
we know what 'time' is, it is found in the order of their
representation. And in this theory, everything perceived, whether
internally or externally, is representation.

Nobody doubts that there is an order of things in the realm of the
thing-in-itself, this is in evidence by the fact that things progress
in time even when there is nobody around to perceive this order,
like the proverbial tree falling in the forest which fell hundreds of
years before anybody ever visited that forest. Obviously it didn't
require your perception for it to fall. But Kant is not talking about
that order of things, it is not the topic at hand. He is talking about
the synthesis of time within an ongoing awareness, Kant is talking
about perception and what makes for direct awareness of a temporal
order.

That's an arbitrary regurgitated slogan of metaphysics and gives no
meaning or origin, its NOT the epistemology of time.

So lets get back to Kant's piffle that originates that mindless
regurgitation, specifically his claim that all of man's knowledge
comes from experience, e.g. that man's knowledge of what he calls
trees, comes from his experience of matter, or as Kant would say,
there is an object awakening his senses.

Kant also says and very clearly that man has knowledge of time, now
all I want you to do is, to do what Kant didn't, explain, HOW is it
that Kant can say in one breath, that man cant have ANY knowledge
without experience, and in the next breath, say that man has knowledge
of time which is not dependent upon experience, indeed he says totally
independent of experience, WHERE and HOW does man get his knowledge of
time if not from an experience, if all of his knowledge comes from
experience.

I just want you to deal with this ONE blatant contradiction.

This is all about YOU defending YOUR accusation that YOU know more

You can NOT make a claim that I know nothing about Kant UNLESS you are
at the same time claiming to know more about the dumb cunt and his
stupid fucking ideas than me. Why are ewe struggling to understand
that very logical assessement?

Getting To The Nitty Gritty Of Kantian A Priori Knowledge Stupidity.

When Kant says, that all of man's knowledge begins with experience of
which there is no doubt (HIS words NOT mine), and when Kant then says,
(HS words not mine) that objects awaken man's senses so as he can gain
all of his knowledge, and when Kant then says, (HIS words not mine)
there are no objects to awaken man's senses for his knowledge of time,
then YOU need to explain HOW one should not regard that as, as blatant
a contradiction as there can be.

Come on Tim its time for ewe to show the world that you are not just

Go back to the beginning of Kant's COPR

Kant says, and he makes it very clear, that all of man's knowledge
begins with experience, of that thee is no doubt, he then explains
what he means by experience, by saying, there are objects to awaken
man's senses, and THIS IS ALL HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH, he
then says, that in respect of time therefore, clearly he has chosen to
seperate man's knowledge of time, and he states very clearly, that man
has knowledge of time WITHOUT, he uses the term *INDEPENDENT OF*, the
experience of objects which he talks about, to explain the origin of
ALL of man's knowledge in the first two sentences.

Sure.

But what are "real ideas"?

An "idea" is some thing ("Begriff" in German, probably "concept" in
English) that has _no_ real counterpart ("object") in real life or
in the (real) world. The term "real idea" is a self-defying thing in
philosophy as I see it. (Because "real idea" follows from the
standpoint of philosophical realism, but realism is a philosophical
point of view that is _under_investigation_ in philosophy)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Kant talks of the means or the meaning of ALL of man's knowledge
&gt;(epistemology) as being, *things* existing (Kant uses *objects*) which
&gt;man needs to *awaken* his senses to experience, which is fine, not how
&gt;I put it, but its ok and the meaning is clear.
&gt;HOWEVER, he then talks about man having knowledge of time, without any
&gt;object to experience, he's done two things wrong here, he has just
&gt;contradicted himself and he's introduced metaphysics into a topic of
&gt;epistemology.
">

First I do not see the contradiction (because time can be regarded
as an idea (though it has empirical consequences) and secondly he
is, as I see it, not _introducing_ metaphysics, he's _attacking_ it
and he takes the point of view that there is a realm (empirical
sciences) that is both: objective and it does _not_ fit in the older
former metaphysics. (because old metaphysics is messing things up).
Kants idea was _not_ to say something about the physical world but
about a lack of distinctive power within the former metaphysics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In one breath he gives a *meaning* or explains the theory, the
&gt;epistemology of how man goes about gaining ALL of his knowledge, next
&gt;breath, he talks as if there is an automatic knowledge existing inside

&gt;somehow and he wants man just to accept that explanation of time,
&gt;without anything like the explanation he has given for all of man's
&gt;other knowledge, which is a contradiction of his statement that ALL of
&gt;man's knowledge comes from objects.
">

There is a sphere of things regarded as objects and there is a
sphere of things regarded as ideas (single: "begriff", plural:
"begriffe"). There was no clear-cut between those two things,
Therefore Kant has to create such a clear-cut. (Within the thinking,
not within the "real world") Thats where time and space enter the
picture. Time and space are no things at all! (Kant calls them
"unding", "no-thing") but al (empirical) things are subject to those
two (time and space) otherwise empirism (in the proper way) isn't
possible anymore.

Kant was attacking old-line metaphysics (about which Gouge knows
nothing), but then he reintroduced it in a Critical format.

"The title 'metaphysics' may also, however, be given to the
whole of pure philosophy, inclusive of criticism, and so as
comprehending the investigation of all that can ever be known
a priori as well as the exposition of that which constitutes a
system of the pure philosophical modes of knowledge of this
type -- in distinction, therefore, from all empirical and from
all mathematical employment of reason." (A841/B869)

"Metaphysics, in the narrower meaning of the term, consists
of transcendental philosophy and physiology of pure
reason. The former treats only of the understanding and of
reason, in a system of concepts and principles which relate to
objects in general but take no account of objects that may be
given (Ontologia); the latter treats of nature, that is, of the
sum of given objects..." (A845/B873)
