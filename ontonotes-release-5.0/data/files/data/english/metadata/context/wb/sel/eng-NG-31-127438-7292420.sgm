1. Thirty Days Against Borders - Children of Nablus against the
Occupation

by the Palestinian Body for Peace, Dialogue and Equality (HASM)

Sunday 14th of January

School children from Nablus dressed up like Native Americans will
gather in a peaceful demonstration at Huwarra checkpoint. On the other
side of the checkpoint, Israeli peace activists will be gathered to
support their demonstration.

We are not demonstrating to end the Occupation together as no Israeli
civilians are allowed to enter Nablus, and the children from Nablus
will have great difficulties getting out through Huwarra Checkpoint.

Over four weekends in January and February, Palestinian, Israeli and
international peace organizations will gather at both sides of Huwarra
Checkpoint to protest against the regime of barriers which severely
restricts movement in the West Bank. They will sing and play, have a
photo exhibition and in other ways demonstrate for peace.

Nablus under siege

We are doing this as Nablus is the most imprisoned city in the West
Bank. Since 2002 it has only been possible to enter through six
checkpoints. It is even more difficult to exit. Men between 16 and 45
(it varies from day to day) can only exit their city with a special
permit that can be obtained only outside Nablus. Almost nightly its
citizens are the victims of violent military
raids and their lives have not been peaceful, or normal for years.

The people of Nablus are regarded as terrorists by the Occupying Forces
who deny them their human rights and subject them to collective
punishment.

Internal Palestinian political conflicts have resulted in large numbers
of Palestinians refraining from participation in collective resistance
against the Israeli Occupation. We support non-violent methods of
resistance and cooperation between different Palestinian, Israeli and
international groups. Until now there has not been a clear strategy to
coordinate various peace activities to achieve justice for all.

The lack of progress towards peace has made the new generation of
Palestinians disillusioned and made them lose faith in their abilities
to improve their situation.

· This project expresses the will of most Palestinians and represents
their rejection of the Occupation without sacrificing their children or
themselves.

· We designed these activities to express our resistance to the
Occupation in general and the closures around Nablus in particular

· We hope that people from all countries and organizations will
support the children of Nablus in these peaceful demonstrations at
Huwarra Checkpoint .

2. Human Rights Defenders targetted in Hebron again

by ISM Hebron, December 31st

An international Human Rights Worker (HRW) was arrested by the IDF in
the Hebron district of Tel Rumeida at 1:40 p.m today. He was
accompanying five Palestinian men along Shuhada Street in their attempt
to exercise their right to walk past the Beit Hadassah setlement as
stipulated in a recent Israeli High Court ruling. Three Palestinian men
succesfully crossed this boundary on Friday 29 December which has been
off-limits to Palestinians for the last six years. To travel from the
Bab Al Zawiye market district in the north of the city to the south,
Hebronites have to either drive around, taking 15 minutes, or walk,
which takes over an hour. The roads on this circuitous route are often
clogged with traffic. Walking from Bab Al Zawiye down Shuhada street to
the other side of the Old City takes around 10 minutes.

As the five men and the HRW reached the settlement, the soldier on duty
stated that they were to wait to be "escorted" by his commander
even though this condition is nowhere in the ruling which was shown to
the soldiers. The commander was however in a meeting and only arrived
50 minutes later. By this time three of the five men had already left
as it was raining heavily. The commander escorted the remaining two men
down Shuhada Street as far as Gross Square, but stated that the HRW was
not allowed to use this road. The HRW obeyed and followed the group
from a pathway above the road, which is perfectly permissable.

The HRW reached the end of the pathway and was observing the
Palestinian men who had passed through Shuhada Street succesfully with
a IOF escort. A bypassing Jewish settler colonist who noticed the HRW
stopped his car, rolled down his window and began shouting at the HRW
in Hebrew. The HRW did not react to this in any way. The settler then
put his car indicator on and began making a U-turn in order to approach
the HRW. Being trapped, and fearing attack, the HRW ran onto Shuhada
Street in the direction of the soldiers in the hope that this would
deter the settler.

Upon reaching the group of soldiers the HRW immediately apologised to
the commander and told him that he had only run down Shuhada Street
because he was being threatened by a settler and sought protection from
the soldiers. The commander refused to listen and ordered the HRW to
stand and place his hands against the wall. The HRW was searched and
his hands then tied together behind his back. He was then put into the
back of an IOF Jeep and blindfolded. These actions of the IOF are
illegal as they are not allowed to arrest internationals - according to
Israeli law this has to be done by the border police.

After being driven around and waiting in the Jeep the HRW was taken to
a police station where the blindfold was removed and plastic tie-wire
cut from his wrists. He was then charged with "disobeying a
soldier's orders" and finally released at 4:00 p.m on condition
that he not enter Shuhada Street again, or would be liable to pay a
fine of NIS 2000.

After this HRW was arrested another nine Palestinians adults and four
children waited for almost one hour in the rain to be allowed to walk
down Shuhada Street. In this time they were all extensively searched.
Whilst walking along the street two settler girls started throwing
stones and hitting them. The police approached but didn't do anythng
and the Palestinians continued walking.

One Palestinian who had already had his ID checked and been searched,
was being detained again on Shuhada street. Mary Baxter, the HRW who
was arrested two weeks ago, asked the soldiers why he was being
detained again. She was shouted at to move away and asked to show her
passport. On doing this the soldiers snatched her passport from her
hands and refused to return it. They also refused to let her shelter
from the rain and cold for over half an hour. The police arrived to
take Mary away in a police jeep to the police station where she was
told she was charged with assaulting a police officer. She was however
also told that she hadn't been arrested but would be summoned to
appear in court. Mary was released an hour later.

HRWs who spend an extended period of time in Tel Rumeida are regularly
targetted by the police. This involves being detained and taken to the
police station on trumped up charges before being released after a few
hours.

3. Bil'in Demo Cancelled by IOF Violence

by the ISM media team and IMEMC,

Officials and supporters of the Palestinian Fateh movement joined
together with residents of Bil'in, as well as international and
Israeli activists for the commemoration of the forty-second anniversary
of the founding of the Fateh movement and a demonstration against
Israel's Annexation Wall.

Jabril Rajoub, of Fateh, commended the unanimity amongst Palestinians
fostered within Bil'in, and cited the death of Yasser Arafat as
significant catalyst toward the curent political crisis. The void left
by Arafat, he said, combined with an absence of unified leadership, has
led to endemic problems such as a lack of security, employment and such
basic necessessities as food and education. Kais abu Leyla, also of
Fateh, echoed the call for unity between Islamic and nationalist
parties, to put an end to factionalism and restore a cohesive
Palestinian resistance to the Occupation.

Muhammad Baraka, member of Knesset, condemed ongoing Palestinian
infighting and called for an immediate cessation of factional violence,
commending the village of Bil'in for the example it has shown.

Before commencing the march toward the Wall, featured speakers extended
their thanks to
international and Israeli activists who have worked alongside the
residents of Bil'in in their efforts against the Annexation Wall. The
village has lost approximately 60% of its land, primarily agricultural,
to the construction of the barrier and the illegal expansion of the
Modin Illit settlement directly adjacent. Residents of Bil'in and
their supporters have demonstrated and conducted non-violent direct
action against the Wall every Friday for nearly two years.

Following the rally in the village center, over five hundred
demonstrators marched toward an access gate to the Wall where Israeli
Occupation Forces (IOF) awaited them. A much bolstered force
accompanied the soldiers typically stationed in the area, possibly in
advanced preparation of the well-publicized march and in the aftermath
of Thursday's Israeli invasion into Ramallah that claimed four
Palestinian lives and left twenty wounded, several critically. A large
contingent of Israeli Border Police indicated a preparedness to conduct
mass arrests.

Israeli soldiers took positions at several locations along the expanse
of the primary fence and almost immediately attacked the peaceful
demonstration, though the majority of marchers had not yet arrived at
the barrier. The IOF fired a vehicle-mounted water and tear gas cannon
which some of the youth responded to by throwing stones.

The soldiers then began firing tear gas canisters indiscriminately into
the crowd spread out over a large area as well as rubber-coated metal
bullets and percussion grenades.

After the crowd had dispersed due to the massive amounts of tear gas
used, the IOF pursued villagers well into a residential area of the
village, firing continuously at the youth who were resisting with
stones, with the water cannon and rubber-coated bullets.

Several Bil'in residents were injured, including at least one who was
taken to the hospital for treatment and some other marchers with
breathing difficulties suffered the effects of tear gas inhalation. An
Israeli activist also received first aid after suffering burns from a
tear gas canister.

4. IOF block access to Shuhada Street, defying court order

by ISM Hebron, January 9th

Local Palestinian residents were yesterday prevented from walking down
Shuhada Street, which cuts through the centre of Hebron. This is
despite a recent High Court Order ruling that the closure of Shuhada
Street to Palestinians for the past six years was a 'mistake' and
their recent access to this street.

At 10am four local Palestinians accompanied by Israeli activists and an
Israeli Channel 1 TV crew walked down Shuhada Street with copies of the
High Court Order. They were stopped outside the Beit Hadassah colony by
a large group of soldiers and some border police officers. An IOF
Commander claimed the existence of a new military order forbidding
access to Shuhada Street for Palestinians, but refused to show the new
order. On Channel 1 later, an IOF spokesperson denied the existence of
this new order and said it would be 'investigated'. The Commander
threatened to arrest the Palestinians if they didn't leave within
five minutes but failed to carry out this threat as the local residents
negotiated unsuccessfully for over half an hour for access to Shuhada
Street.

During this time settler colonists came out of Beit Hadassah and
started to call the Palestinians names. A settler representative
rejected the pleas of the Palestinians for them to live in peace and
walk together down Shuhada Street, claiming that Shuhada Street was
exclusively for Jews.

International observers from different groups had gathered on the path
that leads to the Palestinian Qurtuba girls school overlooking Shuhada
Street to document the events. Three soldiers approached them and asked
them to move on but failed to take action when they stayed.

5. Apartheid Road on Bil'in Land Laundered by High Court

by the ISM media team, December 9th

The Israeli High Court of 'Justice' today gave its decision
concerning the request of construction companies "Heftsiba" and the
Canadian-registered Green Park to overturn the temporary injunction
forbidding building in the Matityahu East colony, and to legitimize a
planning process that would launder an illegal road built by the
construction companies. The case was heard at a hearing on January 7th.

Judges Prokachya, Rivlin and Na'or decided to allow "Heftsiba" to
retrospectively change the new scheme for the colony (scheme 210/8/1)
and to mark the road already built as a temporary road. At the same
time, the judges decided to order Green Park and Heftsiba to pay
expenses of 100,000 shekels for contempt and violating the temporary
injunction issued by Court.

This is yet another example of the theft of Palestinian land being
sanctioned at the highest level by Israeli authorities. The whole of
the Matityahu East colonist block was built on Bil'in village land
and the whole of the colony of Mod'in Ilit was built on the land of
Bil'in and neighbouring villages. Mod'in Ilit is now the largest
colony in the West Bank with a population of 35,000 after 4,000 new
colonists moved there in 2006.

6. IOF beat peaceful demonstrators in Bil'in

by the ISM media team

Today in Bil'in one hundred internationals and local villagers
gathered to protest the apartheid wall running through the village. The
theme of today's demo was solidarity with Maan photographer Fadi
Arouri who was shot in the stomach with live ammo during a recent
invasion into Ramallah.

As soon as the march reached the gate in the Wall the IOF fired tear
gas at the peaceful demonstrators. After about ten minutes of chanting
slogans opposing military violence, some of the local children started
throwing stones but were quickly stopped by village adults. This was
met quickly with tear gas and concussion grenades by the IOF. As the
IOF began to open the gate in the wall and move forward, many
internationals and locals attempted to block the entrance of IOF jeeps.
They were beaten with clubs, shoved, tripped and generally roughed up
by the IOF.

At least five people were injured including one old man, who needed
treatment from a medic, and an AP journalist who was injured in the leg
with shrapnel from a concussion grenade. Villager Wael Nasser was
hospitalised after being beaten in the head with a baton. The jeeps
invaded the village firing rubber bullets and tear gas at children and
returning groups of protesters.
