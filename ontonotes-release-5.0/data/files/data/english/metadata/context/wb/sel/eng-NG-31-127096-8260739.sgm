I can find any number of sources that simply repeat that Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII were divorced on the grounds of consanguinity. But none of them gives the exact details of the supposed relationship, and I have not been able to discover them, in my own research. Does anyone have this data, or a link to where they can be found?

Similarly, it is nearly as often repeated that Eleanor and Henry II were, themselves, related in the same degree as Eleanor an Louis. But the only connection I can find between them is that Ermengarde of Anjou (Fulk V's [Henry's grandfather's] *half*-sister) was the *first* wife of William IX of Aquitaine; and she was NOT even the mother of William X (Eleanor's father).

Does anyone know if there are any more substantial grounds for these two oft repeated claims of consanguinity?

Thank you.

Blessed Be,

Dana

According to &quot;Eleanor of Aquitaine&quot; by Alison Weir (Pimlico, 2000) at
p 23, Eleanor and Louis were fourth cousins.

One way of computing this is via the comital family of Burgundy, viz:

1. Otto William, Count of Burgundy
2. Agnes of Burgundy
3. William VIII of Aquitaine
4. William IX of Aquitaine
5. William X of Aquitaine
6. Eleanor of Aquitaine, married Louis VII of France
2. Renaud of Burgundy
3. William I of Burgundy
4. Gisela of Burgundy
5. Adelaide of Savoy
6. Louis VII of France, married Eleanor of Aquitaine (his
4th cousin)

I suspect it's worse than that:

1. Ermengarde of Anjou
married (a) Geoffrey, Count of the Gatinais
2. Fulk IV of Anjou
3. Fulk V of Anjou
4. Geoffrey of Anjou
5. Henry II of England, married Eleanor of Aquitaine
married (b) Robert I, Duke of Burgundy
2. Hildegard of Burgundy
3. William IX of Aquitaine
4. William X of Aquitaine
5. Eleanor of Aquitaine, married Henry II of England (her half-
third cousin)

Eleanor and Henry II were reportedly half THIRD cousins and also half THIRD
cousins once removed.

So, if that's true, she was more closely related to Henry than to Louis.

Michael provided details on the 3rd half-cousins relationship. Can you give
details on the 3rd cousins once removed relationship? Thanks.

I leave that as an exercise for the reader.

Leo and Peter can surely thrash it out -- playing the genealogical leapfrog
they so delight in.

There's more:

Eleanor and Louis VII were reportedly THIRD cousins, once removed.

Eleanor and Henry II were reportedly half THIRD cousins and also half THIRD
cousins once removed.

So, if that's true, she was more closely related to Henry than to Louis.

Third cousins, once removed.

Just a nit, but...

In my humble opinion it helps to be consistent.  Since you
use the names &quot;Eleanor&quot; and &quot;Henry&quot;, why not &quot;William&quot;
instead of Guillaume?

The ususal convention is that a person is known by the names
most often associated with them *today*.  And Eleanor's
father is widely known today as William X of Aquitaine.

&gt;&gt;Dear Dana, et al.,

&gt;&gt;     The following gives the 3rd cousin 1x removed relationship
&gt;&gt; between Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

&gt;&gt;                    Robert I, K of France
&gt;&gt;           ______________I________________
&gt;&gt;           I                             I
&gt;&gt;       Henry I of France         Robert I, Duke of Burgundy
&gt;&gt;           I                             I
&gt;&gt;           I                             I
&gt;&gt;       Philip I of France         Hildegarde = Guillaume VIII
&gt;&gt;           I                             ____I   of Aquitaine
&gt;&gt;           I                             I
&gt;&gt;       Louis VI of France         Guillaume IX of Aquitaine
&gt;&gt;           I                             I
&gt;&gt;           I                             I
&gt;&gt;           I___________           Guillaume X of Aquitaine
&gt;&gt;                      I                  I
&gt;&gt;                      I                  I
&gt;&gt;             Louis VII of France = 1) Eleanor of Aquitaine

&gt; Just a nit, but...

&gt; In my humble opinion it helps to be consistent.  Since you
&gt; use the names &quot;Eleanor&quot; and &quot;Henry&quot;, why not &quot;William&quot;
&gt; instead of Guillaume?

&gt; The ususal convention is that a person is known by the names
&gt; most often associated with them *today*.  And Eleanor's
&gt; father is widely known today as William X of Aquitaine.

OOPS! Robert I the Strong, of course, is NOT a Carolingian, but a Capetian.
What I meant to indicate, of course, is that he reigned prior to Hugh Capet,
prior to 987.

The convention nowadays is to call the dynasty 'Robertian' from Robert the
Strong (who was the father of King Robert I, not the same man) down to Hugo
Magnus (who wa sthe father of King Hugo Capet).

Calling Robert the Strong or his son Robert I Capetians is rather like
calling Hugo Capet a Bourbon - they are of the same agnatic line, and all
decendants of the Roberts in male line today trace through Hugo Capet, just
as all the latter's agnatic descendants today (I think - but there may be
some illegitimate offspring of the Courtenays) trace through the Bourbons.

More backing and filling by Hines. The statement of Paul Gans was
perfectly true, Eleanor of Aquitaine's father IS widely known as
William. The English-speaking world is wide by any reckoning. And he
would not have regarded himself as living in &quot;France&quot;.

Where he lived is irrelevant.
The language in which you are writing is the relevant thing.

You should have written: 'In France the father of Aliénor d'Aquitaine
is not known as William.'

However, there are other countries in the world which speak other
languages than French. It has always been common practice to translate
names, especially the names of rulers, and especially when writing
about the Middle Ages..

So it is true to say in French that
Aliénor d'Aquitaine was the daughter of Guillaume

but in Catalan they say that
Elionor d'Aquitània was the daughter of Guillem

and in German they say that
Eleonore von Aquitanien was the daughter of Wilhelm

and in Czech they say that
Eleonora Akvitánská was the daughter of Vilém

and in Spanish they say that
Leonor de Aquitania was the daughter of Guillermo

and in Dutch they say that
Eleonora van Aquitanië was the daughter of Willem

and in Portuguese they say that
Leonor da Aquitânia was the daughter of Guilherme

and in Italian they say that
Eleonora d'Aquitania was the daughter of Guglielmo

and in Hungarian they say that
Aquitániai Eleonóra was the daughter of Vilmos

This topic is being discussed in English-language newsgroups, and
therefore it is perfectly acceptable to follow the time-honoured
practice of English historiography and say that
Eleanor of Aquitaine was the daughter of William.

And I for one will continue to call him William the Conqueror, not
Guillaume le Conquérant.

Once again, my bad! That's what I get for writing from  memory, rather than
consulting my database first.

And, a propos of another current thread, I prefer to refer to *Hugh* Capet
(rather than Hugo or Hugues), and his great-uncle Odo (rather than Eudes,
Otto  etc.)
