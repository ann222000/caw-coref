&gt; ONE BLOOD, LANGUAGE, HEART AND SPIRIT

&gt; Richard Barrett

&gt; On the occasion of the continued and, even, increased clampdown on
&gt; anti-Communists, it is telling to fathom the minds of those who simply
&gt; will not yield, who would rather sit in jail than betray their people, their
&gt; country or their own conscience.  One has to wonder, during the seventy
&gt; years of Communist rule in Russia, what kept those going, who struggled
&gt; to get out from under the damnation.  They held no offices and, when
&gt; &quot;convicted&quot; in carefully-orchestrated show-trials, their names and faces
&gt; were blotted out, the way some pharaohs would chisel away the likenesses
&gt; of their predecessors.  The pattern is repeating itself during the forty
&gt; years of minority and alien sway over America, but, just as their
&gt; counterparts in the Soviet Union, the champions of freedom refuse to
&gt; apologize, yield, scrape, bow or surrender.

&gt; It has been pointed out how the tyrants disregard rights, laws, constitutions
&gt; and human-decency, to &quot;show their authority,&quot; sandbagging their despotism
&gt; with ruthlessness and treachery.  But, the American experience is even more
&gt; horrific, because, in Russia, the Reds, actually, seized power, by killing off so
&gt; many, who stood in their way.  In America, enemies -of-the-people have been
&gt; named to high-office, from which, unawares, they plunder the rights and
&gt; pillage the freedoms of the people.  Remember, it was not a Mexican, who
&gt; installed a Mexican in the President's Cabinet.  Neither was it a Negro, who
&gt; impressed a Negro into a federal-judgeship.  Nor was it a Chinaman, who
&gt; placed a Chinaman over forced-housing, forced-hiring and forced-labor.

&gt; One attribute of a patriot is vision, the ability to see beyond the depravity
&gt; and woefulness of the day, to know that &quot;the day of triumph is at hand.&quot; Just
&gt; as freedom-fighters, behind the Iron Curtain, envisioned the day when the
&gt; statue of Joseph Stalin would be hauled down, so modern-day Minutemen,
&gt; in America, know that the edicts of Earl Warren will be trashed.  Along
&gt; the way,  I was speaking with a man in his nineties, who said that &quot;it looks
&gt; like all is lost.&quot;  Then, he quickly added, &quot;But I still have hope.&quot;  The hope
&gt; is simple and straight-forward.  That the nation will be one.  One blood,
&gt; language, heart and spirit.  The people will rule.  Every office, court,
&gt; institution and body.  The land will be free.  No foreign, criminal, polluted,
&gt; subversive or deceitful presence.  The darkness will flee.  No more fear,
&gt; helplessness, hopelessness, apathy or cowardice.

&gt; A young man asked me, if the new day will come about by reformation
&gt; or revolution, whether it will be peaceful or violent.  He added that he was
&gt; ready to go either way.  But, one thing he was clearly unwilling to do was
&gt; to recant, as Galileo had done.  Even though the great astronomer was correct,
&gt; he was compelled to renounce his own works, to save his skin.  On the other
&gt; hand, there are those, of our own day, who stand erect and by their stoney
&gt; silence say, &quot;Do your darndest, but you cannot break me.&quot;  Their reasoning
&gt; is that Communism is wrong, their persecution is a fraud and, most of all,
&gt; the oppression is temporal.  There is something noble about those who
&gt; lay down their lives for their friends, who give up their freedom for their
&gt; countrymen.

&gt; Perhaps the great-turnabout will come, when a young Charles Lindbergh
&gt; or William Jennings Bryan appears on the scene and, with a golden tongue,
&gt; appeals for Americans to take back America.  It might be some climactic
&gt; event, such as the sledge-hammering of the Berlin Wall or the posting of
&gt; the Ninety-Five Theses, to turn heads and lift hearts.  It is not the minority
&gt; judges, alien prosecutors or sell-out politicians, who determine the outcome.
&gt; They, merely, lap up the milk and honey from the vessels they have smashed.
&gt; They pontificate, in their broken-English, fidget, with their primate-appendages,
&gt; and count the pieces of their ill-gotten gold.  But, they know that it is only a
&gt; matter of time before their illegitimacy is forfeited.  The ostracism has
&gt; already begun.  Will they be given time to vacate or be tossed out?  Will
&gt; they exit quietly or in great commotion?  The result is the same.

hings aren't that bad in the US. If the next election beings about a
centerist administration (of either / any party) I will be pleased and
look forward to a better future.
If it brings another extremeist one, of either party, I may loo at
other options.
