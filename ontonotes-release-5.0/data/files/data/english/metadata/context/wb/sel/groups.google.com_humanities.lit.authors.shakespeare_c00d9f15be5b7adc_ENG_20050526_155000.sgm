Alice in Wonderland (Carroll): This time there
were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.

Les Miserables Hugo, (Victor Enjolras presented him with a glass of
water himself, and, as JaVERt was bound, he helped him to drink

GulliVER's Travels (Swift, Jonathan) (For I had about me

We are the hollow men

Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw, Alas!
Our dried voices, when

Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass

In our dry cellar.

I was working up something about:

Verre = Glass (French) = Worse (Norwegian).

but I spent so much time in the garden that I didn't finish.

Glas, [p-Celtic and assimilated into A. Sax] means grey or green or
transparent. The name &quot;Glastonbury&quot; has nothing to do with glass or Vitrine
[L.]

I also note your references to cups and chalices. These are from the A.N.
Arthurian romances. There are 3 sets of Arthurian reference, and the chalice
idea is a late one, and French.

Wm of Malm. wrote of one other, the historic Arthur-figure who resisted the
Saxons in 450-500, there is no cup in these sagas, but a cauldron. The
cauldron legeneds are also alluded to by WM, but are very much older than
ealy Saxon times, and are set in the Welsh mythos in tales of Ceriddwyn.

That is my ignorance, Tom, if it is ignorance, not Oxfordian ignorance. I
understand that it means &quot;super&quot; or extra. But it had a ring to it. In fact,
to me, both parts of the term were unfortunate, as indeed they were meant to
be.

Um, if you'd like me to post a full and true account of what happened, I can
certainly do so, Harold. You've left out several salient points as well as
making public my private mail to you. That is going beyond the pale. Or

I thought the flurry of activity to identify &quot;Howard Staunton&quot; was fun. You
are mischaracterising that exchange or any other exchange by saying we were
in an uproar. Most of us who know you, knew very well who Howard was,
anyway. I did from your first or second post. It took a couple of others
rather longer.

Sad that you have resorted to this kind of posting for reasons I can't even
fathom. I hope you will reconsider as it's extremely painful to me to see
you paint us so black when in fact we, and especially I, bent over backwards
to accommodate you.

The word uber is often paired with the word Nazi, like it or not.

Besides, remembering the context, I cannot believe that Howard made the
comment in any kind of positive way, although I don't think he meant it to
have a Nazi connotation. He just wasn't thinking, especially as he was
addressing someone Jewish. But to quote what he said would only inflame
another argument that's going on at HLAS right now, so I'd rather not.
Besides, he already apologised for it, so I have no idea why he's so intent
at picking at a previously forgotten sore. In fact I'm at a loss to know why
he posted the things he did about the Fellowship forum in the first place.

It's a long story. No doubt Howard will tell it to you when he has time...

The birds are singing outside my living room. There are two cardinals in the
back garden and the lilac is out. In fact I planted a lilac sucker that I
had cut off from the main bush a few years ago, and that's blooming too for
the first time. Ah, spring. In Canada, no less. :)

I think there are others who have been attracted to the &quot;uber&quot; side,
usually in later years. Thomas Carlistle had a well-entrenched
position on the heroic, as in Heroes and Hero Worship, and even
mentions Shakespeare as such a one, as I remember. And what about
Kipling? Seems like the 19th C. had many authors who took themselves
seriously as carriers of the flame of British Imperialism. It remains
to be seen if present-day authors will similarly take up the torch and
champion militarism for World Democracy, possibly someone like Tom
Wolfe who knows the &quot;right stuff,&quot; Tom Clancy, for sure. bb

Not at all. Bassino spent a great deal of time and bandwidth trying to

uncomfortable matters such as the spelling of Oxenford's name got the

This thread is an excellent advertisement for the Shakespeare
Fellowship discussion boards. In particular, anyone offended by vulgar
language here now knows where they can go to find a more refined group.

On the other hand, do you really think it is of any interest to anyone
on HLAS who is not also participating in the SF? Do you really think
it is even comprehensible to anyone who did not participate in the
initial dispute? I find it amazing that a group that prizes its
separateness to the degree the SF does can find it necessary to use
this newsgroup as, in effect, its sewer.

As if it is not &quot;nannyish&quot; to make continual comments about the

You obviously cannot write in any consistently tactful manner, so

at

in an

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We are, Neil? Over Howard Staunton? I hadn't noticed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LynnE

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Last I heard one of the admin objected to the term &quot;uber&quot; in a
post
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claimed it was meant to invoke Godwin's Law. I think that
qualifies as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an over-reaction.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That was me, and the word was Uber-Oxenfordian. You were addressing
one
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our members. I asked you privately and politely to desist.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You threatened to ban &quot;Howard Staunton&quot; from the forum, and claimed
use
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the prefix &quot;uber&quot; was an attempt to invoke Godwin's Law. Did you
&gt;&gt;&gt; know paranoia can be treated, Lynne?

&gt;&gt; Um, if you'd like me to post a full and true account of what happened, I
can
&gt;&gt; certainly do so, Harold. You've left out several salient points as well
as
&gt;&gt; making public my private mail to you.

&gt; I've done no such thing - I've alluded to an exchange of
&gt; correspondence, and only after you insisted on your ridiculous PR spin
&gt; about what happened.

&gt; That is going beyond the pale. Or
&gt;&gt; would you prefer to let things rest?

&gt; Do whateVER you feel like doing.

"/>

I've written to you privately. I felt that more reasonable than gumming up
hlas with even more posts. I have no wish to escalate matters. If you want
to recount publicly what I've written privately to you today, please be good
enough to post the whole email, so people can see the context this time.

I have nothing else to say.

Lynne, it seems that you're incapable of posting anything that doesn't
escalate matters. Was there anything you posted on this thread that
anybody in HLAS wanted to read, that didn't raise more questions than
it answered? Every single post, it seems like, said, &quot;It was quite
horrible -- here's another tidbit -- but actually it's worse than that,
only I don't want to get into it.&quot; (Except for those that, like this
one, made sure we all knew what you thought about Neil.) I have no
idea what attracted others to the discussion, but you were the one
fueling it.

If you feel you need to straddle both HLAS and the SF forums, for some
reason, I guess it's not really any of my business, nor do I care,
really, ultimately. But the &quot;scandal&quot; as you are reporting it is, in
my opinion, absolutely ridiculous. If there is more than that, as you
are hinting, say it or stop talking about it. If you don't think it's
ridiculous, as you've described it, and you don't think you look
ridiculous carrying on about it here, however, that's your choice.

What I object to is that it can seem you and a few others treat these
groups as extensions of each other, intentionally or not. The only way
that can work is if everybody belongs to both groups, isn't it? And
doesn't it make that worse if you deliberately attempt to impose rules
on HLAS in order to protect your own members?

Bianca,

Whether I agree with them or not, I have great respect for Dave Kathman, Tom
Reedy, Terry Ross, David Webb, Art Neuendorffer, Neil Brennen, Tom Veal, Ken
Kaplan, and many others, simply because they all have the courage to back up
their convictions with their identities. You do not.

When I know who I'm talking to, I'll be much happier to listen to your
criticisms. It is very easy to criticise from behind a mask--a mask which
you have used, by the way, both here and on the Fellowship forum.

Regards,
Lynne

Lynne, I'm sure that you write all your posts to HLAS yourself and that
you don't rely on a secretary, a research assistant, Roger, or anyone
else to monitor this group for you and edit your posts. All the same,
you know at least as much about me as I know about you. And I'm also
sure that when you hint to new participants that &quot;SOMEBODY here is
using a pseudonym, I know *wink wink*, don't you?&quot;, you are just
flirting, and don't mean to imply you are anyone other than you pretend
to be. I did enjoy the aspect of the SF forum where people's profiles
were sometimes changed, so that their real identities also changed from
one week to another. Thank you for insisting that I could not know
what I was talking about until I had tried the more reasonable folks
over at the Fellowship.

I'm sure, as well, that you don't intend to imply to new participants
that they ought implicitly to respect any of the people you listed, or
any other participants, as invariably reliable and trustworthy, because
nobody on Usenet (or, for that matter, elsewhere) is *that* reliable,
and I'm sure you don't intend to take that much responsibility on
yourself. I doubt they intend to take responsibility for others,
either.

I also know that if I disagreed with you as to what was probably
anti-semitic in effect, if not in intent, you would ignore my opinion,
no matter &quot;how Jewish&quot; I am. So please don't pretend you are ignoring
my opinion for the reason that I've supposedly &quot;lied&quot; to you.

&quot;Bianca Steele&quot; has no entries in credit databases, etc. It's nice to
know you think Lynne is so important that I should put my actual name,
and some indication of my activities, online, so the information can be
used by anyone, just because Lynne is not inclined to trust people who
don't agree with her and makes unreasonable demands on those she
doesn't trust. I should be one of only two or three women in HLAS who
uses her legal name? I can tell that you find it very difficult to
criticize anyone, but it is no less unpleasant for me to be attacked
under a pen name than under my own. A pen name is not the same as a
mask. You do not have the right to know personal information about
people you're debating with, here or anyplace else. If you want to
ignore me, that's your right; if you want to imply I have to become
*your* personal friend or else participate at my own risk, you are the
one who looks ridiculous.

You, Lynne, are not the only person who participates in both groups.
Perhaps you should stop attempting to speak for the others. If neither
you nor they are willing to stop, you are creating a problem, and the
only solution is for others to drop out. Don't pretend everything
would be okay if we would all only join *your* club, or your HLAS
ladies' auxiliary.

Are the two forums being compared as arenas above similar to that of
the University Wits and the theater playwrights of Shakespeare's time?
If so, there's a nice set of images in Greenes Groatsworth of Wit you
can use for lampooning each other while obscured behind literary
allusions. I suggest you use the brickbats I have emphasized in
CAPITALS, with apologies to Greene and or Chettle.

Greene's Groatsworth of Wit
, , , ,
BASE MINDED men all three of you, if by my miserie you be not warnd:
for vnto none of you (like mee) sought those BURRES to cleaue: those
PUPPETS (I meane) that spake from our mouths, those ANTICS garnisht in
our colours. Is it not strange, that I, to whom they all haue beene
beholding: is it not like that you, to whome they all haue beene
beholding, shall (were yee in that case as I am now) bee both at once
of them forsaken? Yes TRUST them NOT: for there is an UPSTART CROW,
BEAUTIFIED WITH OUR FEATHERS, that with his TYGERS HART WRAPT IN A
PLAYERS HYDE, supposes he is as well able to BOMBAST out a blanke
verse as the best of you: and beeing an absolute IOHANNES FAC TOTUM,
is in his owne CONCEIT the onely Shake-scene in a countrey. O that I
might intreat your rare wits to be imploied in more profitable
courses: &amp; let those APES imitate your past excellence, . . . .

You have a regular managerie of animals here to use as comparison
figures: puppets, crows, tigers, players, Johannes fac totums, and
apes. Then, you can plead repentance as Greene does. bookburn

These are interesting indicators of orientation and methodological
approaches from contributors. Essentially the questions is &quot;what is
awareness?'

To keep asking questions is to maintain an open mind on the general subject
which accommodates new information. Obviously we do this with a corpus of
knowledge as our base, and also by our evaluation of it as either diffident
material historically, or as a substantiation of what we previously held to
be true.

The difficulty in every kind of historical research is thereby this
confrontation or contrast between a prescriptive approach, which fits in or
discards new aspects of knowledge to an existing bias, with that which
maintains the open Question, rather than the fixed Answer.

Both means are entirely respectable and can be called 'awareness', unless
the original basis topples over by virtue of not being able to cognetly
contain knew information.. But the difference in approaches; in asking
questions to maintain an awareness of the overall body of information, may
be contrasted with the prescriptive approach to containing or discarding a
pre-disposed point of view.

The goals of either approach are different thereby: The person who ask
questions may be maintaining an open frame of reference to possibilities
whereas the pre-disposed opinion may simply be resisting re-framing what was
originally comfortable, but is no longer tenable except by rhetorical rather
than more profound orientation.

I submit this is the salt and pepper of most fields of endeavor!

Cordially, Phil Innes

Pretty much every tradition has a similar question, though many use a
different word for &quot;awareness,&quot; and there are different approaches to
proceeding to look for answers to the question.

The difficulty in particularly *historical* research is that it is not
possible to identify the right and wrong parties to a dispute, merely
by means of abstract attributes. The only way to do this is by limited
dichotomies like -- man good, woman bad -- teacher good, student bad --
Christian good, Jew bad -- wealthy, educated, well-mannered government
official good; poor, dirty, ignorant, ill-mannered criminal bad --
fully qualified professional expert good; ignorant, illiterate amateur
bad. It is indeed possible to bundle these all together so that we
may, in some limited area, act in cooperation with those who refuse to
abandon such a dichotomy. The psychological effects on the individual
of such self-identification have been extensively studied.

&gt; Both means are entirely respectable and can be called 'awareness', unless

&gt; be contrasted with the prescriptive approach to containing or discarding a
&gt; pre-disposed point of view.

The purpose of asking questions, in the tradition deriving ultimately
from Socrates, is to become certain of (a) what we really believe and
(b) what is true. If we have become aware of the irreducible
complexity of the world, of nature, of human society, and of history,
as well as of the human mind in its best as well as its worst aspects,
we will surely expect to find new information that cannot be
assimilated to our existing knowledge. We will know that chemistry,
for example, explains some phenomena well, but does not explain other
phenomena so well as cell biology does; we will not say that the
chemistry student is someday going to learn that chemistry and cell
biology are &quot;really&quot; interchangeable, or in some way delusive aspects
of Maya that the better-educated humanist or priest has overcome. It
is only the specialist who thinks he or she has learned everything an
educated generalist could possibly need to know. That is not to say
that people educated as specialists are not really educated, nor that
they should feel guilty about not having become more like generalists.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The goals of either approach are different thereby: The person who ask
&gt; questions may be maintaining an open frame of reference to possibilities
&gt; whereas the pre-disposed opinion may simply be resisting re-framing what was
&gt; originally comfortable, but is no longer tenable except by rhetorical rather
&gt; than more profound orientation.

"/>

We can, of course, replace historical research with practice in
supporting our ideologies. Thus the study of history becomes the study
of how bureaucracies can persuade a populace that the particular regime
at this moment in power has always been in power, will remain in power
at all times in the future, and ought to be in power according to any
conceivable moral principle. This kind of study is clearly useful both
to future inhabitants of bureaucratic positions, and to dissidents and
everyday critical thinkers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I submit this is the salt and pepper of most fields of endeavor!

Whether it is or not, most fields probably flatter themselves that it

True again, but have studies much to do with our behavior. Perhaps
superadding the point that any reduction of the person to a claque cultural
commodity is inevitably not to address a more wholesome sense. Isn't this
why people run away from the chattering classes and write books in a bothy
in the Scottish highlands - at least I know several who have.

If &quot;moral&quot; = &quot;customary&quot; or &quot;conventional,&quot; there is no way to claim
anything wrong with any customary discipline or practice: what I find
being done is morally correct and to criticize or interfere would be
unethical. And I can see why a discipline might require fresh meat,
but of what use could &quot;fresh blood&quot; be?

On the other hand, &quot;custom&quot; might mean only formal rules, without
concern for content. Appearing to follow the rules would *be*
following the rules. All those who had never broken the rules would be
seen to know the rules. There would not necessarily be any ability to
teach the rules to new participants. It might be impossible to teach
the rules, because they did not make sense. Obviously, it would in
this case also be moral not to criticize or interfere.

I don't tend to lie, and to prove it...

Here's one public exchange:

You: Mouse, if you want to boot me off after repeatedly inviting me to post,
then feel free.
Me: I certainly don't want to boot you off.
You: But you would if I don't play nice with the Oxenfordians. I want to see
how closely the Forum is censored. I understand both Our Ever-Posting Poet
and Mr. Ross have been asked to leave before.

This was on the Light Blue vs. Dark Blue thread if anyone wishes to check
it.

But here's the post where you said what I suggested you said: &quot;As for the
door swinging both ways, thanks for the reminder. Now please go complain to
the admin and get me booted before I do something radical like criticize
Price's book.&quot; This was to KC on the same thread. It's easily checkable.

My response to this and other worse nastiness was as follows in a private
message:

&quot;If you have come on our boards with the express intention of being thrown
off, we can do that for you. We don't mind if you then report back to HLAS,
especially as I will be glad to explain the circumstances over there. But it
seems a rather negative way to behave, and I would prefer that you stay and
take an honest and non-inflammatory part in the proceedings.&quot;

And yet for some reason, after apologising and behaving much better, you
decided to come back over here and characterise what was happening thus:
&quot;The Oxfordians are in an uproar and resorting to police-state tactics to
restore order...&quot; and to me, &quot;You threatened to ban 'Howard Staunton' from
the forum...&quot;

You came to the Fellowship to try to create an uproar, Neil, and you didn't
get it. So you invented it. Shame on you.

That is because you keep goading me, so the only way to desist is to go
away. This is truly my last response on hlas for the time being. I have no

try to discredit my Tempest/Strachey threads. But whatever the reason, you
have got what you apparently wanted. Perhaps everyone will think you a great
hero for trying to browbeat me as well as calling me a liar. I thought I was
tough, but I am unwell, and frankly my heart isn't strong enough for this
kind of gratuitous nastiness, offered for no reason that I understand.

Goodbye everyone, at least for now. It's been really fun with most of you.
And I've enjoyed our friendships very much. You know where to find me--over
at the Fellowship, or you're welcome to email. Perhaps I'll come back at
some point.

Lynne

&gt; tough, but I am unwell, and frankly my heart isn't strong enough for this
&gt; kind of gratuitous nastiness, offered for no reason that I understand.

&gt; Goodbye everyone, at least for now. It's been really fun with most of you.
&gt; And I've enjoyed our friendships very much. You know where to find me--over
&gt; at the Fellowship, or you're welcome to email. Perhaps I'll come back at
&gt; some point.

&gt; Love,
&gt; Lynne

&quot;Lynne, it seems that you're incapable of posting anything that doesn't
escalate matters. Was there anything you posted on this thread that
anybody in HLAS wanted to read, that didn't raise more questions than
it answered? Every single post, it seems like, said, &quot;It was quite
horrible -- here's another tidbit -- but actually it's worse than that,
only I don't want to get into it.&quot; (Except for those that, like this
one, made sure we all knew what you thought about Neil.)&quot;

&gt; what I find

&gt; unethical. And I can see why a discipline might require fresh meat,
&gt; but of what use could &quot;fresh blood&quot; be?

"/>

what is a transfusion?
to follow my top note, if the overall sense of the custom becomes degraded
by process of entropy, determinations from a degraded system become
increasingly of lower quality and or lessening value. this might be an axiom

in terms of these studies an original base of knowledge now competes with
new knowledge not developed on the same basis as the old. that is, what
might once have automatically accrued to Wm Shakespeare as some sort of
default, is now attributed to others, or questionable attributed, or simply
is not known [also a valid conclusion] - so we have a situation where
received knowledge competes with current research, and comes into conflict
with it to greater or lesser degrees

i think sometimes this is of not much import, but sometimes it can be
spectacularly useful; only recently did we discover that Chaucer scans, and
had to admit that our reading of much Anglo Norman was wrong, missing a
whole syllable in some words

in other words, the thousands of children who were read Canterbury Tales
were misinformed, not only as to the sound, but with the re-established
meter, also of an emphasis in the text

in this case all scholars were wrong, and this transfusing insight changes
not only study of Chaucer, but mcuh of the language we call Anglo Norman.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand, &quot;custom&quot; might mean only formal rules, without
&gt; concern for content. Appearing to follow the rules would *be*
&gt; following the rules. All those who had never broken the rules would be
&gt; seen to know the rules.

"/>

yes. i follow. my long note [too long!] also illustrates that following the
rules as is the custom does not make one right, and so i personally prefer
to use the term 'moral' without an imperative sense as is inherent with
'ethical' - acting ethically does not make one right either, but it does
differentiate between habit which is herd-oriented, and perhaps even
unconscious, and more consciously elected behavior in ethics

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There would not necessarily be any ability to
&gt; teach the rules to new participants. It might be impossible to teach
&gt; the rules, because they did not make sense. Obviously, it would in
&gt; this case also be moral not to criticize or interfere.

I have cut your paragraph to such an extent introducing my own material,
that I lost the sense of your last sentence, and can't regain it. Can you
offer an illustration of it?

These practices are human, logical constructs, not organisms that age
and die. What exists in the mind and can be described in language does
not degrade. Entropy is a concept from physics, and although attempts
to apply it to the human sciences were once fashionable among a certain
type of politically-correct elite (e.g., Henry Adams), they were -- at
best -- simple impressionistic borrowings that never had any scientific
or even rational backing. These borrowings were not close to
sufficient even to force an apparent establishment of a consensus where
one had not really already existed.

I don't have time to respond to the rest of this. After this point it
probably gets too complicated to be dealt with here.

But I do not see the advantage in focusing on what is &quot;new and
therefore better&quot; to the exclusion of &quot;what people are doing right
now.&quot; The only sense I can make of that particular focus is that you
are trying to persuade people to change what they are doing, and you
assume the possibility of change has never occurred to them.

I am assume that the Idea of the Questioner [how Blakian of me to so
capitalise] to remain aware, awake, is not shared by those who
philosophically comtemplate only on Answers, which can be only a closed
attitude rahter than an attention, as if the matter was already predisposed
to be solved.
