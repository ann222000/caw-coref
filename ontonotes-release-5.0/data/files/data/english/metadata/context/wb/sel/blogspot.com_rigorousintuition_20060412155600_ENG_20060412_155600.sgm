When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose

You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal - Bob Dylan

Funny, that, how the public face of the "Satanic Panic" flap was a
black-clad Dr Evil with an Eddie Munster 'do, and its fearless vampire
hunter an almost impossibly bumbling everywhere-man of the far right
with an FBI backstory. And how the leading proponents for the
"disclosure" of extraterrestials have been military careerists or
intelligence assets, while the most noisome "researchers" supporting the
ET hypothesis have also been disseminators of military disinformation.
Or how, suddenly, the loudest voices for "9/11 Truth" are those of
former Bush aides and lifelong Republicans, beating the drum for - dig
it - no passenger aircraft having struck the World Trade Center.

It's more than just theme and content that evoke The Outer Limits .
It's our uncritical digestion of dubious information that becomes our
fattening hobby. We will control the horizontal. We will control the
vertical.... Sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear .
If we're open to all channels and lack the discernment to know what
we're watching, we're nothing but passive consumers of conspiratainment.

Ritual abusers aren't likely to be the overt occultist and the kid
getting his hate on to Black Metal, but the priest in Toledo and the
preacher in Ponchatoula; the prominent Nebraskan belting out the
national anthem at two Republican national conventions. More often than
not, the abuser isn't the self-marginalized outsider of caricature, but
the insider: the one who already has power by the world's measure, and
who means to gain more of it. But that caricature is too good to let go,
and on all sides, because on all sides can be found the allies and the
assets of power that encompass and define the discourse. And so the
foolish and imprecise caricature becomes the defining image of the crime
- likely to become an uncrime - for both those disposed to discount
everything and those who eat it all up.

Who profits by the You're with us or you're against us essentialism
of the advocates for the most contentious and spurious speculations on
9/11, and how far does it carry us from the scene of the crime and its
high criminals? The pods, the holograms, the missiles, the demolitions:
how did we arrive at this familiar position of irrelevance, and who do
you think means to keep us here? Popular Mechanics , CNN and the great
Anglo-American dailies don't shy from drawing strawman caricatures of
conspiracy and then delight in setting them ablaze with all of us
supposedly inside like some springtime wickerman sacrifice, yet the meat
of the case for criminal intent rots on the offering plate. Why do you
think that is, and who do you think might like it like that? The
conspirators, who create both a false opposition and a false conspiracy,
remain invisible and free to deal more death.

It's a conceit of liberalism to believe knowledge is power, and it's
a deceit of the "Information Age" to mistake information for knowledge.
Gone missing, for the greater part, is wisdom. Find that, and maybe we
find our power.

"Big Brother is watching, so learn to be invisible." That's some
advice dished out early on in Grant Morrison's The Invisibles . It's a
comic book from the mid-90s, a knowing caricature of a guerrilla war
waged by the "Invisible College" against an occult elite that Morrison
claims was determined by his own abduction/shamanic experience in
Kathmandu. It also happens to contain more wisdom about the world than
yet another cut and paste contending that the hole in Tower Two was too
small for a Boeing 767. Art can do that. Even comic art.

A few years ago Morrison said , "Fuck man, I tell you when I was a
kid I read Robert Anton Wilson and all this shit and here we are, we're
standing here, talking about this shit and it's real!"

If the popular culture - even the popular alternative culture - gives
us little but caricature, at least we have a good comic book.

I get the same feeling as the kid who read Robert Anton Wilson except
my author was Eco and the book was Foucaults Pendulumn. It shouldn't be
a surprise that the artists are ahead of the rest of us and yet I'm
surprised.

Given the shitty choice of living in Wilsons universe or Eco's I
would go for Wilsons but I fear we're in Eco's.

Conspiracy must be understood in cybenetic terms, information
control, distortion, etc etc are all quantifiable. I say this only
because Human Conspiracy, i.e. win lose buisness as usual, fails in the
long run and those strategies are simple to spot. However, there is a
evolutionairy conspriacy, perhaps controlled simply by nature, or DNA,
that simply has the last word on how humanity will play out her term on
earth. There is both a conscious and unconscious conspiracy to elevate
humanity to the next level of evolution, life extention, intelligence
increase through non zero sum global administrative orders and vast win
win networks, migration into technology and then outer space.

Funny when you think that when the world was at war in 1942, the
technologies that made the rest of the 2oth and 21st centuries what they
are were developed when we were trying to kill each other...

Now that's a conspiracy that only mother nature could pull off.

You mean those technologies which our controllers have been insisting
since the Industrial revolution would result in more free time for
humanity ?

More time to reflect on the nature of our existence, and help us to
work out the obvious - namely that killing one another is like pointing
a gun at our own heads in the greater scheme of things ?

Whatever happened to that ? Too funny .

War is progress, and beneficial ?

For whom exactly ? The usual suspects would be my best guess. The
people who dont want you to think about the bigger picture. Those who
would have you believe their actually is no bigger picture, and which
subsequently perpetuates the grab it while you can mentality that
reduces us all to the ignorant savages that we arent - if we were only
given time to understand that of course.

There was a dichotomy in the 60's that still trips us up. Either you
bought in to the prevailing narrative or you dropped out entirely. There
was no third way.

But buying in is moral death and dropping out -- which is to say,
rejecting all accumulated wisdom and morality -- is cultural death.

I've been brooding over this problem for 30 years, and the best
answer I can come to is that we have to reclaim the heartland. Rather
than shying off from the fundamental documents of our culture, we have
to become incarnations of them. Rather than being as wild and wacky as
imaginable, we have to be utterly and uncompromisingly sane.

I'm not talking about "conventional knowledge" here. Conventional
knowledge is soul-death. I'm talking about "the letter killeth but the
spirit giveth life." I'm talking about heart-knowledge -- and by that, I
don't mean knee-jerk emotionalism. I mean the kind of knowledge that
comes out of complete attunement to the universe.

Jeff understands this, I'm sure, but the way he's pitching it might
be taken as pragmatic guidance -- at least by us superficial and
self-interested American types. In fact, there's nothing "pragmatic"
about it. It isn't a question of "whatever works." It's a question of
"What is truth?"

Conspiracy theory is not a flavor of the month. It's a deadly serious
matter of discerning truth from lies and purging the falsehoods from our
collective system.

How real do you dare to get?

"...suddenly, the loudest voices for "9/11 Truth" are those of former
Bush aides and lifelong Republicans, beating the drum for - dig it - no
passenger aircraft having struck the World Trade Center."

Thanks for "refuting" the crazy theory of some of us that no
passenger airliner hit the WTC and for being so worried about less
sophisticated theorists getting so easily caught up in the clever
disinformation traps set by nasty Bush aides and lifelong Republicans.
And lucky we have one who by his regular mentions of his shamanic
connections guarantees us such a link to universal truth and is here to
straighten us out.

But may I enquire (and hopefully without links for answers but in
plain words for all to read), not just what did not happen which you've
broadly hinted at quite a lot, but just what DID happen on 9/11/01 ?
Presumably to say what did not happen means you know what did.

And can you tell us your belief whether 911 was an inside job and
were the 19 Arabs patsies?

Classic stuff, Jeff.

And great comments, Starroute. I'm with you all the way. I brood on
that exact same topic. I sometimes feel like discerning up from down is
impossible.

The only thing even close to an answer that I've found has come from
studying buddhism - particularly zen. There, the focus is on moment by
moment authenticity and a trueness (sic) to the world around us. You
'just sit'. You see what comes up. You acknowledge it. You let it be.
Similarly, you 'just cut the carrots'. You just cut them. That's all you
do. It's very simple and very beautiful. Just be there, utterly present.
This practice does change things.

I'm wary of saying it 'tunes you in' or giving it some other label
but it certainly alters the frequency of perception (another label,
sorry).

I wonder if we're in danger of erring in this age where our
intellects can get so much exercise but midst all the clammer it's ever
harder for our 'beingness' to just be?

How real do you dare to get? It's possibly the biggest question
facing all of us right now.

If the 9/11 truth narrative is just a distraction, is the RA
narrative also just a distraction? Why is one a distraction and not the
other, is it the background of the distractor that makes one more valid
than the other? Or is it more complicated than that? It seems to me that
911 truth movement whistleblowers and RA witensses/victims alike all
come from a variety of backgrounds. Even if all the 911 truth storylines
are disinfo and hoax meant to mislead, don't they ultimately serve the
purpose of attempting to identify the real perpetrators? It's not like
we'll ever know anyway, the real bad guys are never going to willingly
give themselves up. Any admission of involvement would most likely arise
from hubris in an unintentional moment of candor and just vanish in the
ether, like GHWB's usless eaters commment. I suppose you're right, it
all makes for a good comic book.

Petition by physicists on nuclear weapons policy - You can sign under
non-physicists and under institution many people wrote "Student" or
"Self"

Petition by physicists on nuclear weapons policy, September 2005 As
physicists we feel a special responsibility with respect to nuclear
weapons; our profession

brought them into existence 60 years ago. We wish to express our
opposition to a shocking

new US policy currently under consideration regarding the use of
nuclear weapons. We ask

our professional organizations to take a stand on this issue, the
Congress of the United States to conduct full public hearings on this
subject, and the media and public at large to discuss this new policy
and make their voices heard.

http://physics.ucsd.edu/petition /

Will The U.S. Nuke Iran?

Professor of Physics Highlights The Dangers....

===NO ONE in the reality-based world could ever be prepared for the
foreign policy of this administration. In a sense, it's the perfect
storm: bigots, a population of disinterested, seemingly decorticate
workers clinging to their jobs with a hope and a prayer (for those
outsourcing said jobs), greedy economic ideologues, Protestant,
Catholic, Jewish and Muslim nutjobs,and the reins of government of the
most powerful nation on the planet held by a group of people so severely
pathological it's amazing they're able to function. Now what training
could every prepare anyone for that?

===pertinent here as well. (re NRFE *ilson #19)

When Truman faced the decision of whether or not to use the A-bomb in
1945, no one outside of the project (except numerous Soviet spies) knew
about it. HST himself didn't learn about it until he was informed (by
Stimson, IIRC) a few hours after FDR died. Also, obviously, no one had
any idea of the long term affects such as fallout, etc. But the key
factor was that he was getting estimates from the JCS that the invasions
of Kyushu and Honshu, planned for October, 1945 and Spring, 1946,
respectively, would likely result in 500,000+ KIA for the US forces
alone. This, plus growing concern about the geopolitical implications of
the Soviet Union entering the war against Japan, led to his decision. If
he had not used it and the casualty rates of the invasions of the home
islands had been in accord with projections he would have been
villified.

Things are very different now, and there's no excuse for the use of
nuclear weapons, even

"tactical" ones, not being dismissed out of hand. In today's
environment there is no such thing as a "tactical" nuclear weapon
because their use would have profound strategic blowback. In this I
disagree with Billmon's awsome post of yesterday.

Anyone morbid enough to want to pursue this topic should check out
The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes.

====BC, i keep on mentioning this, but no one has picked up on it
yet. If there is an order to nuke Iran, this will have to go to officers
who are especially trusted. Who are those?

People like Boykin--crazy, end-timer christians who want to bring on
Armageddon, whom Bush will use for his own purposes, whatever they are.
I really think that if there is a way to look at recent officer
promotions for suspicious

patterns, it would be worth doing.

=I try to keep up with Prof. Cole and others as often as I can. All
of my int'l relations studies never really prepared me for a foreign
policy analysis of an Administration THIS out of whack. SIGH

===And while we're discussing Iran and nuclear weapons, Mr Preznit
really needs to get out the bubble.

His saber-rattling appears to be causing a crisis of conscience in
the military's officer corps.

Apparently some general officers who would have to counter-sign an
order to use WMD have announced they would not do so. I know quite a few
of the ROTC cadets on our campus and the more thoughtful among them are
trying to figure out what to do.

I've never heard ROTC cadets questioning the command authority
before. Not even during the Vietnam wind down.

to expound on what tim in san francisco said: Your wisdom and powers
of discernment ARE infectious and it gives me hope. a reinvigoration of
positive energy, positive everything. and i'm working toward following
my words that i have written here in recent days. basically, to live
responsibly, a hard thing to do. a core reason why this country is
falling.

its springtime in america once again and people will begin to become
more aware, i pray (prayer through action) that more people will. i
think you have too.

but, in response to the issue at hand, i do find it interesting the
idea that the no plane theory seems to have a major pal on its side.

but even further..we must move forward..these are distractions.

days after 911 happened president bush urged america to shop and
portrayed for us, as a nation, a framework for the future of america
into a simple manichean, dualistic model: you are with us or your with
the terrorists. it is a completely irresponsible and manipulative idea.

and everything leads off and away from there. this simple dualism is
the way the PTB wanted us to continue to exist in, the way we had
consistently existed through out history.

i remember in the months after 911 i had this glowing hope that the
world would change for the better. that this event would birth a third
way, or maybe a fourth, i don't know. that we as a country atleast would
learn to get along in a productive manner. to actually help the world
NOT invade countries in some imperial march of revenge. i knew exactly
the potential for change that would exist for only a short time, maybe a
year. every fucking country on earth said how sorry they were that we
were attacked. this scum bag of a president squandered it all.

shop!

but this was before i knew what this was really about.

it was the pearl harbor of the information age. a catalyst for the
distruction of sanity. a chaos created in order to inject a false
understanding of reality, even if the order before it may have been
strange too.

it was the twilight zone before, now it is the outer limits
manifested.

with 911 the 'debate' was narrowed to a single issue: security. and
thusly everything else was exploitable. fear was exploited to eat up
peoples rights so that we could feel 'safe'.

and its just grown from there. we are now actually talking about the
merits of torture, the boundaries of executive powers, the nuking of a
country and the impeachment of a traitorous president in the coming
months...

honest, sober and reasonable intuiton/wisdom is our way out of this
maze.

and as the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy says: Don't Panic.

i like what starroute said: we have to be utterly and
uncompromisingly sane.

we have not let fear cloud our judgement.

Conspiracy has many levels.

The greater conspiracy seems to me to be the proliferation of peurile
theories (some now accepted as fact in many circles) -The X-files type
stuff that leads us nowhere except away from where all the real shit is
going down.

The truely frightening conspiracies are the ones that are reaching
fruition in the current activities of the American Empire. It appears
that the corruption of power is absolute and it requires no further
justification for what it does. The media conjecture on the motivation
behind the actions of those in power is meaningless - these guys are
running headlong at the abyss - tomorrow does not exist for them; they
are living in a collective mid-life crisis where they refuse to
contemplate their imminent demise and therefore have no problem in the
annihilation of millions (if not of everything.)

Get them out now.

I agree. The problem is that in an age when information is cheap,
wisdom is in short supply. Mainly because it's hard work and there are
some scary characters out there stirring up shit. I would be a whole lot
easier to dismiss it all, or believe every word. Then you aren't
responsible for your own errors in judgment or some fact that you over
looked.

It doesn't help any that math and physics have advanced to the point
where everything I was taught in grade school is wrong. And I mean just
about everything. I am kind of a nerd and have always kept up, or tried
to, but man... when compter scientists talk about computing with quantum
knots and cosmologists about M-brane theories and multiverses and the
set theorists say that everything we know is but one archipelego in an
infinite fractal sea.... my head starts to swim. I start thinking "It
sure would be nice to let someone lese tell what to think 'cause I sure
don't know any more."

But then I snap out of it and try once again to slog through it all
and put the pieces together myself. Bleggghhh!

Richard M. Dolan studied at Alfred University and Oxford University
before completing his graduate work in history at the University of
Rochester, where he was a finalist for a Rhodes scholarship. Dolan
studied U.S. Cold War strategy, Soviet history and culture, and
international diplomacy. He has written about "conspiracy" in the
following way:

The very label serves as an automatic dismissal, as though no one
ever acts in secret. Let us bring some perspective and common sense to
this issue.

The United States comprises large organizations - corporations,
bureaucracies, "interest groups," and the like - which are
conspiratorial by nature. That is, they are hierarchical, their
important decisions are made in secret by a few key decision-makers, and
they are not above lying about their activities. Such is the nature of
organizational behavior. "Conspiracy," in this key sense, is a way of
life around the globe.

Anyone who has lived in a repressive society knows that official
manipulation of the truth occurs daily. But societies have their many
and their few. In all times and all places, it is the few who rule, and
the few who exert dominant influence over what we may call official
culture. - All elites take care to manipulate public information to
maintain existing structures of power. It's an old game.

America is nominally a republic and free society, but in reality an
empire and oligarchy, vaguely aware of its own oppression, within and
without. I have used the term "national security state" to describe its
structures of power. It is a convenient way to express the military and
intelligence communities, as well as the worlds that feed upon them,
such as defense contractors and other underground, nebulous entities.
Its fundamental traits are secrecy, wealth, independence, power, and
duplicity.

Hey Jeff,

Love the reference to Grant Morrison and The Invisibles. It's
interesting

how much truth is revealed in caricature.

I think the time is coming where we, including and especially, the
scientific community, will have to embrace future causality.

The current paradigm is not holistic and perpetuates division. It
cannot explain our circumstance. We are collectively a dog chasing its

Haven't seen John Judge on Ali G, but from this it sounds hilarious:

"I'm amazed it even aired," said John Judge of the Washington Peace
Center, who was interviewed by Ali G for a panel on corporate control of
the media. Judge said he was paid for his appearance and told it would
reach 4 million people in Britain. "It was perhaps the most surreal
interview I have ever done."

Answering questions via e-mail, Judge recalled that before the show,
Ali G asked him to spell his name and then crossed out the "d" in Judge,
explaining that this was so he could pronounce it. Judge said he was
also surprised when Ali G asked the panelists why people still read
books when everyone can now afford television. After telling Ali G that
he had read thousands of books, Judge said that Ali G "told me not to be
'bragging' about it and asked me to name one" to prove it. "In the final
analysis," Judge concluded, "either this fellow is as dumb as a box of
rocks" or "he was, as they say, just having us on."

http://s15.invisionfree.com/Loose_Change_Forum/index.php?showtopic=847

Demolitions - !?

I find your blog very interesting, informative and fantastically
well-written, Jeff, but that's the second time recently I've seen you
disparage theories that refer to the possibility of a controlled
implosion at the WTC on 9/11 without offered any reason or link to
support your remarks.

As far as I know (having only stumbled upon this forum recently,
though I have gone through a lot of the old posts) you have never said
what you think caused WTC building 7 to collapse. This, to my mind, is
the Achilles Heel of the official conspiracy theory, as it's collapse
does not fit in there; hence the inconsistent and always vague
explanations of how it came down or (more often) banishment of its
destruction from the narrative. If ordinary American citizens are to be
convinced that the official conspiracy theory is untrustworthy, I think
this is the best place to direct them to look. This is why your sneering
of the demolition theory as "spurious" and "irrelevant" troubles me; I
personally can't come up with (and have not come across) a better
explanation of what happened to WTC building 7.

So, Jeff, could you kindly tell your readers what your take on the
implosion of building 7 is? From what I've read here so far, it seems
you generally ignore such requests, which I find rather disingenuous. If
I am mistaken, please direct me to the appropriate post and accept my
apologies in advance.

I'm inspired by starroute also. 30 years well spent. Reminds me of a
song by the Flaming Lips. Fine music for the conspiracy minded (from the
Soft Bulletin):

And it goes fast

You think of the past

Suddenly everything has changed-

Funky bass grooves, bizzare pneumatic drum, Wayne Coyne falsetto,

http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/niger-gate.html

In his January 28, 2003 State of the Union Speech, President Bush
uttered 16 words that have since come back to haunt him. "The British
government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant
quantities of uranium from Africa."

Bush was quoting a statement by the British, "There is intelligence
that Iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium
from Africa. Iraq has no active civilian nuclear power programme or
nuclear power plants and therefore has no legitimate reason to acquire
uranium." This quotes came from a document issued by Number 10 Downing
Street titled, "Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction: The assessment of
the British Government". This document has since become more widely
known as the "Dodgy Dossier" following exposure that it was written from
plagiarized student thesis papers. In one case, information in the Dodgy
Dossier was 12 years old, dating from before the UN sanctions on Iraq,
hopelessly outdated and obsolete, but included because it portrayed Iraq
as heavily armed with banned weapons. Prime Minister Tony Blair has
since apologized for this document.

Bush made his claim about Iraq buying uranium from Niger even though
former Ambassador Joe Wilson, who had a great many contacts in Niger,
had traveled to that country in February of 2002 to verify the
accusation and on his return had reported the claim to be without
foundation. Following Bush's speech repeating the Niger claim that
Wilson knew to be false, Wilson went public, writing an op-ed piece in
the New York Times in July of 2003 that exposed the claim as deceptive.
As part of a campaign to discredit Wilson and prevent him from further
exposing the truth of the matter, Joe's wife, Valerie Plame was revealed
as a CIA operative. Not only was Plame's career ruined, but the company
she worked for, Brewster Jennings & Associates, was exposed as a CIA
front. In one of the ironies of the scandal, Brewster Jennings &
Associates' mission was to track nuclear weapons in other countries.
Since compromised and shut down, this has left the United States without
the means to track just who does and does not have nuclear weapons.

Originally, George Bush tried to dump the blame for the Niger claim
on the CIA's George Tenet. The CIA then demanded an investigation into
the outing of Plame. Then Attorney General John Ashcroft stalled for
months, then handed the investigation to Patrick Fitzgerald.

However, months before Joe Wilson's article appeared, the
International Atomic Energy Agency had examined the documents which had
surfaced in Italy purporting to document the sale of uranium to Iraq and
determined that they were forgeries, and indeed, very clumsy ones.

This is the scandal behind the scandal. The outing of Valerie Plame
was not done out of revenge, or as the Washington Post reports, part of
a feud between Karl Rove and the CIA. Joe Wilson's article started to
focus attention on the fact that the documents used to claim that Iraq
was buying uranium from Niger were fakes!

The fact that the Niger documents were fake is hard proof that the
lies that tricked this nation into war were not an accident, not
"misinterpreted" or "bad" intelligence, but deliberate falsehood with
malice aforethought.We The People were lied to intentionally to trick us
into supporting a war of conquest against an innocent nation that had
done us no wrong.

Where did the forgeries come from? The documents had first surfaced
in Italy, and in July, 2005 the Italian Parliament released a report
naming four men as the likely forgers of the documents; Michael Ledeen,
Dewey Clarridge, Ahmed Chalabi and Francis Brookes. Ahmed Chalabi is the
former bank embezzler who was at one time expected to lead Iraq in the
post-Saddam period. Of the remaining men, Michael Ledeen deserves
special note. Shortly before the forged documents surfaced in Italy,
Michael Ledeen paid a visit to the head of Italy's secret service,
SISMI. Ledeen's entourage included Larry Franklin, since exposed as a
spy for Israel operating in the Pentagon Office of Special Plans, an
operational partner to the White House Iraq Group charged with "selling"
the war in Iraq to the American people. Larry Franklin has confessed to
handing classified information to AIPAC, the Israeli lobby. Presumably
the information went from AIPAC to Israel. Less discussed is what
disinformation flowed back from Israel through AIPAC, to Larry Franklin.
What is known is that the claims regarding Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction that came from the Office of Special Plans were as
groundless as the claim that Iraq was buying uranium from Niger.

Larry Franklin is not alone in handing classified documents to
Israel. Larry's boss at the DPB, Richard Perle, likewise was caught
giving classified information to Israel in 1970. Yet another official
caught handing America's secrets to Israel is Michael Ledeen himself, as
a result of which he (briefly) lost his security clearance. Ledeen was
hired by Douglas Feith to start up the Office of Special Plans. As a
side note, it was Michael Ledeen who arranged Jonathan Pollard's job
with the US Navy, which led to US Nuclear Deterrent Secrets being given
to Israel, who in turn traded them to the Russians for increased
emigration quotas.

The exploding Plame-gate scandal is more than just the illegal outing
of a CIA agent and her associates. It is more than just the shutting
down of Brewster Jennings & Associates, leaving the US without a means
to track foreign nuclear weapons. It is more than the extent to which
the people of the United States were lied to in order to trick them into
a war. Running through every single aspect of this horrible mess are the
clear traces of a foreign spy operation that has infiltrated the
government of the United States to the highest levels and subverted the
nation to the purposes of that foreign government.

As of this typing, the men who gave classified information to Israel
are still in their positions. AIPAC, the Israeli lobby implicated in the
spy scandal, still donates money to US politicians. US Politicians, more
damning still, continue to take it.

The following actors in the Niger forgery imbroglio have Ties to
JINSA , The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs 1) Dick
Cheney ,Vice-President of the United States 2) Michael Ledeen , former
Pentagon consultant to Doug Feith , head of Office of Special Plans 3)
Ahmed Chalabi ,former Head of Iraqi National Congress , deputy prime
minister of Iraq 4) Major General Amos Gilad , head of Sharon's Office
of Special Plans 5) Duane Claridge , JINSA member , military advisor to
Iraqi National Congress 6) General Wayne Downing , JINSA , military
advisor to Iraqi National Congress 7) John Bolton , UN Ambassador ,
touted forgeries in State Department "Fact Sheet" 8) Antonio Martino ,
JINSA defence minister of Italy 9) Michael Mason JINSA Assistant
Director of FBI /Head of Washington Field Office.

Americans are the victims of the greatest and most deadly hoax in
history; lied into a war of conquest. As we are Americans, and as we are
at heart moral and just people, we cannot allow a single person who took
part in that lie to remain in a position of authority or public trust,
whether in government or in the media.

Jeff,

I, too, ask if you could provide clarification on what you are
implying regarding controlled demolition(s).

I couldn't give a hoot about pods, holograms or missiles. Mere
trivialities for the teams of evidentiary experts at the trial.

As for the issue of explosives being used to bring down the three
towers: it is there to be seen. Just see it.

I am with David Ray Griffin; the fact that the three buildings
collapsed at all is enough reason to doubt the "official" story.

It's our uncritical digestion of dubious information that becomes our
fattening hobby.

Isn't that -- in a nutshell -- how we got into Iraq?

I don't understand how you author a blog called "Rigorous Intuition"
without having some very rigorous, very intuitive objections to the
official version of 9-11.

You seem to mock those that call to question the illogical and
never-proven tale told by the government -- but base your objections on
the culture of conspiracy, not on anything "factual".

I've been a 9-11 skeptic since about 10:30 am on 9-11-01, when the
second tower collapsed in the same manner as the first, evn though it
had sustained sifferent damage, at different height and different angle.

My intuition gave me a RIGOROUS kick in the gut as I watched this
happen. It seems that the govt has done nothing but confirm my intuition
in the ensuing years...

The 9-11 Truth movement is a response -- so many are trying to figure
this out...

As for the issue of explosives being used to bring down the three
towers: it is there to be seen. Just see it.

As I've posted before, my point is this: I've seen "9/11 Truth" be
hijacked by speculation, whether valid or not , and the best and hardest
evidence for conspiracy neglected.

I know what the collapse of the buildings look like, and I have
questions about WTC 7, but we have answers about other things re 9/11
that I consider to be much more dangerous to the conspirators if only
they could get some traction.

I'm talking about things like the coincident wargames including the
live-fly simulation of hyjackings; the al-Qaeda-ISI-CIA triangle and
Omar Saeed Shiekh; Ptech; insider trading, Cheney taking on the new role
of coordinating a response to terror attacks on US soil in May, 2001;
the standing order for shootdowns changing in June 2001, discretion
taken away from field commanders and entrusted to the Secretary of
Defense (the order was rescinded after 9/11); names like Dave Frasca,
Mahmood Ahmed, Wally Hilliard, Randy Glass, Michael Springmann, Robert
Wright, Sibel Edmonds and Indira Singh; Atta's drugs and spooks Florida
odyssey; the destruction and cover-up of evidence; Jeb Bush's hand in
purging flight school records, and on and on - that's the kind of stuff
I'm talking about. That's the kind of stuff I wish I was reading when
"9/11 Truth" hits corporate media, but it's not, is it? (Or not usually.
I'll give credit to Alex Jones: I saw his appearance on CNN a couple of
weeks ago, and he really gave it his all to show there's much more to
the case than suspicion of demolition.)

Do the people arguing the loudest for demoltion, who suggest I accept
the "official story," even know half this stuff?

Jeff, again two implications you keep slipping in just don't add up
to me and are important enough to ask for clarification on:

1. That wild theories about demolitions and such were really created
by "bad" Bush and longtime Republicans to fool us.

2. That these same nasty Republicans want to fool us about the
official versions of 911 they themselves relentlessly disseminated, to
fool us.

Jeff said... "Have anything to back that up? I have no objection to
being persuaded I'm mistaken or misled." regarding "Grant Morrison never
went to Nepal"

Jeff, "Have anything to back that up" that demolitions are false?

Interesting your reply to the Nepal post was lightning fast Jeff (12

others raised too, we are still waiting.

About being "lightning fast," I've been out all day and responded
first to the last thing I read. It's also the first time Grant
Morrison's come up here, and I feel like I've beaten around the 9/11
bush on these issues enough elsewhere.

"Have anything to back that up" that demolitions are false?

My point, again, is not whether it's true or false, but unproven and
speculative, and so irrelevant and disruptive. There is so much more of
greater merit. It's a tragedy that so few seem interested in that these
days.

Jeff I was writing my last post while you were posting yours
immediately before mine.

To respond to your insinuation we advocates of demolition are
uninformed, I for one DO know about all these other aspects of 911 that
you mentioned, and suspect most advocates of demolition do too. Most if
not all seem very valid issues, to be expected in such a vast coverup.

But I think demolition keeps getting most of the attention because it
is simple, rests on fundamental laws of physics verifiable by anyone and
without sophisticated instruments, and on it's own proves 911 was an
inside job (using the establishment's own video clips).

Therefore I am baffled how you could respond it is "unproven and
speculative, and so irrelevant and disruptive."

Dr. Steven Jones, tenured professor of physics at BYU published a
paper on this at the BYU web-site:
http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/energy/htm7.html

How is this "unproven and speculative, and so irrelevant and
disruptive" in the slightest ? (and this is just scratching the surface)

The other points of 911 you raised are much more complex requiring
much contextual knowledge that most of the public (not demolition
advocates) are not willing to digest, plus on their own they tend not to
prove 911 was an inside job.

I notice you again dodge taking a position on the truth of demolition
and again only try to discredit those who see it as a valid issue.

Let me ask you this: if it were established that there were

go? Why couldn't bombs be just as easily ascribed to "al Qaeda"? The WTC
was bombed before after all.

A coincident, live-fly simulation of hijacked aircraft has been
established. What does that suggest, and how high must it go? Do you
recognize the difference in evidentiary value, and their consequences,
and why some parties would like us to circle jerk over certain arguments
to the neglect of others?

"Does anyone else here find it at all odd that Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who said yesterday..."

I don't find it 'odd', I find it obvious... The money power is
setting the world up for WWIII.

"Love of money (power) is the root of great evil."

Really, how long are we going to keep saying and thinking things are
'odd' and such. We need to get past this language. Let me illustrate
with a perfect analogy.

In Peru and vicinity are the huge pictographs that span miles of the
desert landscape. To the unaware observer on the ground, stubbing his
toes on the rocks and geography of the pictograph, he might notice an
'oddness' of the layout of the surface details of the land. Then again,
how many people would just pass thru, or even dwell there and never
notice much at all? But the observant would notice an 'oddness' about
apparent pathways, yet may remain mystified as to the the
meaninglessness of these vague pathways going nowhere in the desert. But
to those whose perspective has gained sufficient altitude, the 'oddness'
is replaced with obviousness. Once one has viewed the 'Big Picture' the
surface details are no longer odd. Not in the least. The significance of
the surface details has become obvious beyond question. The details are
indeed odd - for those who are not yet aware of the full perspective.
But now, once the big picture is seen, for all those having done so, it
becomes absurd for them to return to the details and stand around
remarking "how odd".

So, if you don't get the big picture yet, I fully understand how odd
the details seem. But for those who 'get the picture', it is tantamount
to denial for them to continue using the language of ingnorance
regarding what is now obvious. For those, it should no longer be 'odd',
but rather damnably obvious what those senseless pathways compose.

Please, no retorts that no one knows everything. I know that. I
certainly do not know everything about it all. Far from it. And likely a
good thing too for my mental health. But I also know the 'odd' details
make a picture.

The Iranian is part of the set-up. Another incompetent, reliable
puppet, playing his role, following his cues.

Jeff,

"Why couldn't bombs be just as easily ascribed to "al Qaeda"? The WTC
was bombed before after all."

Silverstein and the previous WTC bombing would just add precedence to
this current case. WTC7 and the physics of the situation make demolition
the only logical conclusion. Whether or not it's important to focus on
this is debatable, but calling it speculation is just plain wrong.

P.S.

"Let me ask you this: if it were established that there were
explosives planted, what would it prove?"

Because then you could start tracing WHO rigged the building. WHO
hired them. WHO looked the other way. WHO was watching and then lied
about it. WHO paid them.WHO was connected to the '93 attack. WHO
protected all of these people for 13 years.

The war games are already PROVEN. You can look them up in CNN
articles. But for whatever reason we are having a hard time proving they
were intentionally used as cover. The majority of people don't want to
consider that possibility.

Rigging the WTC with explosives has only one purpose. To take them
down. Knowing it was true would mean:

1. It was an inside job (like the OKC bombing?) where the involvement
of some is being protected/hidden

2. You can no longer deny the intentions of any connected to it...
unlike the wargames, there is no secondary reason for taking down 3
skyscrapers other than to kill people.

I think it's important for readers to fully understand what Jeff is
saying here. Focus on what is obvious, rather than detailed speculation.
This would be far more revealing and damaging to McGuffin Inc.

It's not that the controlled demolition may or may not be true, but
by focusing on that, we diminish our case and allow the other side to
eventually sweep all commentary to the fringe where it will finally be
catalogued with other conspiracy theories, not even worth a footnote in
history.

I talk to spooked up people every day, and there is really only one

The hijackers--on whoever's payroll--knew about the exercises ahead

If it really was al-Qaeda-- and it probably was --the real clue to

http://tomsupfrontnews.blogspot.com/2006/01/its-all-in-family-george-w-bush-big.html

I spent a lot of time on a link one of the other anonymouses left
sort of endorsing webster tarpley in the comments to a post you did a
couple of days ago. Alas, webster doesn't identify himself as being
affiliated with the crypto-fascist Lyndon Larouche on his website, but I
shoulda figured it out as soon as I started reading an excerpt of one of
his books at his site talking about "British" financiers having been
behind the economic manipulation of this country. The guy may have lots
of good information and research, but his stuff seems as much a
territory strewn with mis and disinformational landmines as anything
that comes out of the larouche camps. i wonder if the anonymous poster
knows about this stuff or just sincerely thinks tarpley is the most
credible information source on the stuff going on re: 911 and the war on
terra. anyway, suffice to say, it sure felt like synchronicity to read
your new post after getting through my digging and questioning of my own

Jeff, your points are well taken. I am aware of the other trails you
have pointed out. But take Sybil Edmonds for instance. From what we know
(e.g. Vanity Fair article last year) her testimony is explosive - there
couldn't be better evidence - yet no action yet.

Hard for buddy sitting in front of television to get his head around
her allegations and push for traction on the issue. But it is easy for
the average working family to understand things that go boom.

Once understood for what it is, you can guarantee that the families
of the victims will be running in the streets with pitchforks .. the
fury these poor people will feel will know no bounds. They will know
that officials destroyed those towers with their husband, sister, son
standing helplessly on the 85th floor pathetically trusting in those
same officials to save them ..

look, WTC 7 WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPLODED. Precision blasted. it fell onto

Jeff you are simply stunning me to death.

Jeff said... "Let me ask you this: if it were established that there
were explosives planted, what would it prove?"

This is really incredible coming from one so intelligent and gifted
in subtlety.

First of all, demolition is proven! (see link I provided in my
previous post).

And second, this proof proves everything!

It proves the government did it, and proves Arab terrorists didn't do
it.

This is because since planes couldn't and didn't do cause WTC to
collapse, only demolition could, and only the government had the means,
opportunity, and skill to make it look like the planes had something to
do with it (and motive); nobody else on this whole earth had all that.

It means the timing of the planes and the demolition of the WTC were
not coincidental unrelated events. It exposes one event (planes) was
launched to coverup the real event (demolition).

Had the government not done it, their control over the crime-scene
would have enabled them to find the truth and tell us who really did do
it; instead they blamed some patsies, invented novel pancake theories,
destroyed evidence, and took part in the mother of all coverups (lies).

Everywhere they went afterwards they left their DNA, contradicting
their cover story.

Why they did it is an important discussion and I have my own views on
that, but that they did it is beyond discussion at this point, IF
DEMOLITION IS LET OUT FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE.

I think they did it because it's about massive profit and
geopolitical dominion (empire) comes from wars that some staged
"terrorist" attacks against us can justify, and the fact is that
somewhere along the line, the government became mafia or mafia became
the government.

The details of how some types of sausage is made is unknown to me,
all that I know is that it was made.

Why they launched 911 is also about enhancing the police state, which
protects the ability of government to inflict future 911's and get away
with it (i.e., Patriot Act).

I think Blogbart hits the nail on the head there, Jeff. It's about
what is easiest to sell to generally uninformed Joe Sixpack. He's not
going to draw the line from wargames/ISI/insider trading or whatever to
those smug grins on the TV screen; these are highly suggestive pieces of
evidence but don't conclusively prove anything on their own and can
easily be 'explained' away if someone is determined to do so. Through
experience, I find the WTC7 route is the quickest and most effective one
to take if you want someone who instinctively trusts the system to sit
up and take notice, and we desperately need a lot of that very soon. I
can see why you consider it condescending, but at this stage I think the
effectiveness of an approach in shaking people out of their stupor is
more effective than how good you feel about the approach. The 'destroyed
evidence' angle is very useful in conjunction with this though.

As an aside, I don't know if it's been mentioned here before, but
Silverstein did actually elaborate on his infamous "pull it" comment
which caused so much pointless debate. On September 9, 2005 a statement
was issued by Silverstein Properties spokesperson Mr. Dara McQuillan,
which supported the conclusions in FEMA's report (i.e. that fire
probably caused the collapse) and cast a new spin on Mr. Silverstein's
comments in the 2002 documentary:

"In the afternoon of September 11, Mr. Silverstein spoke to the Fire
Department Commander on site at Seven World Trade Center. The Commander
told Mr. Silverstein that there were several firefighters in the
building working to contain the fires. Mr. Silverstein expressed his
view that the most important thing was to protect the safety of those
firefighters, including, if necessary, to have them withdraw from the
building.

Later in the day, the Fire Commander ordered his firefighters out of
the building and at 5:20 p.m. the building collapsed. No lives were lost
at Seven World Trade Center on September 11, 2001."
http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Sep/16-241966.html

So, apparently, Larry now wants us think that by "pull it", he meant
"pull the firefighting team from the building", not "pull the building",
an interpretation that had been doing the rounds for a while before
this.

Unfortunately for him, FEMA's report states that, with regard to WTC
building 7, "...no manual firefighting actions were taken by FDNY"
(section 5.6.1) and "...the firefighters made the decision fairly early
on not to attempt to fight the fires..." (section 5.5.3), which would
seem to indicate that the above statement contradicts the official
story.

Furthermore, one life was lost that day; Secret Service Special
Officer Craig Miller's body was found in the rubble of WTC7. It was
claimed that "he went back into the towers to help the wounded" and then
"lost his life when the building collapsed" (according to a resolution
passed by the House of Representatives on April 23, 2002), which sounds
a mite suspicious when you consider that there was no one else left in
the building to help, it having been evacuated many hours before the
collapse.

http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r107:FLD001:H51497

It's something that I presume has been noted before, but its always
worth mentioning, as that Silverstein comment and all the meaningless
debate that surrounds it comes up a lot in other places; at least now we
have an unequivocal lie to attribute to him. "If nothing suspicious
happened then why did Larry lie?" is always good to pull people back to.

I have to say Jeff, I honestly don't understand your reservations
about the WTC7 argument as it seems fairly rock-solid to me. I don't
think people will ever be able to pin the implosion of WTC7 on the
official bad guys outside of the fire theory as the building was so full
of government agencies that to suggest evil arabs got in and planted
detonators will never fly with anyone, no matter how gullible (I hope!).
Thanks for addressing the topic anyway, though.

One more small point; it's not so much that I'm convinced of the

that we don't know jack about), but of the impossibility of the official
story of fire taking it down. That's probably what we should all

an alternative hypothesis, and the controlled implosion's the best we've
got right now.

Perhaps it's not the angle so much as it is some of the anglers.

I balk at the insinuation that If you don't see this, you're one of
them , and there is a lot of it coming from those pushing demolition to
the fore . A number of the most prominent are on the Right, and
Republican, including a "former Bush team member."

I also distrust movements, because I know that attempts will be made
to infiltrate, subvert and demolish any of value.

Also: Is there a structural engineer in the house? I know it looks
like a controlled demolition, and I know witnesses heard what sounded
like explosions, but how many other examples of 767s at excess speed
striking structures of the towers' construction do we have against which
to measure our expectations? The opinions of theologians and
astrophysicists and philosophers are all very interesting, but what do
professionals in the field say about why the towers fell? (Towers, not
WTC 7.)

I've speculated before that at some point during the New York and
Washington flights on 9/11, the hijackers were themselves hijacked by
remote control so only the desired damage would be accomplished. For me,
this best explains Hani Hanjour's sudden aeorobatic skill, the 270
degree turn to hit the virtually unoccupied and hardened face of the
Pentagon, and the deception regarding the recovery of the black boxes.
But that's speculation, and I don't lead with that. And I don't say that
if you don't think as me, you think as them .

Kennedy's dead 43 years and there's no justice, while researchers are
still sifting the sands on the grassy knoll. Microanalysis is the death
of this work , and good intentions are easily misdirected.

Where do you think "9/11 Truth" will be in 40 years? (As if we have
that long.) Do you see 9/11 Justice? I don't at this rate. And without
justice, this is all just a good wank, isn't it?

The thing I find most telling is the UL report on the towers
desecration and the action within the insurance business. Have insurance
rates gone up for steel buildings? Basically mine frames built upward
insted of down.

The twin towers, for my money, were part and aprcel of the "mystical
hoodwink/bondage" spells that the cryptocracy weaves.

Where was Kennedy going when he was murdered? The Dallas "Trade
Mart." And some of the conspirators were involved with setting up "Trade
Marts/Centers. Most Americans outside NY cared little about the twin
towers. Part of the op (and it was/is a long -running op) has been to
"place" the WTC as an "archetype" within the American psyche. Because by
'attacking" archetypes one shatters "reality" and then puts it back
together in a way mo' bettah

Maybe it's too late to jump in here, but in all of the commentary
I've ever seen on 9/11 and CD, I've never seen my personal theory. If
someone has seen it, I would appreciate it if you'd direct me to it.

OK, it goes like this: Yes, of course it was CD, and the PTB had to
cover it up, but not for the reasons commonly stated. Imagine you're
building the largest structures on the planet in the midst of huge
population centers. What if something unidentifiable or unforeseen does
happen and the structures threaten to collapse? Not only would the
building itself collapse, but many, many more surrounding it
would--unless it could be brought down by CD first. What if, at some
point, either while being built or in some later, more paranoid time, it
was decided that it would be wise to rig up these huge buildings with
explosives to avoid potentially greater damage and loss of life?

If this were the case, and most giant public buildings in densely
populated areas have the option for CD built into them, the government
or whoever is making these decisions could not, of course, let this
information become common knowledge, for a variety of reasons. For one
thing, terrorists could take advantage of the fact. For another, people
would panic at the thought that they work in a building designed to blow
up easily. For a third, those who brought down the buildings would be
seen as murderers, even if, perhaps, bringing them down were for the
greater good and saved more lives than had they not.

Thus if the towers were brought down by this built-in feature, there
would have to be a massive cover-up.

I don't necessarily subscribe to my own theory, BTW, but I find it
interesting to speculate about, especially since it doesn't seem to have
occurred to anyone else. Maybe there's some really good reason it
hasn't--like it's dumb! It also doesn't account for many of the ragged
edges of a long-term plot we seem to find, and that Jeff points out
often and in the commentary for this post.

Still, it seems to me that often we can be right about the facts
while being wrong about the motive. Good people do bad things, not
realizing they're bad, duped by other people with different motives.

When examining the mechanism of conspiracy, we have to allow for
elements of natural chaos. We're not working with a closed system here.
The chances of error, especially human error, are great, and greater
still when more people are brought into the system. As complexity is
layered on, predictability declines. Minutely examining fragments of
evidence can become an exercise in infinite regression, leading us
further and further away from the Big Picture (cf. the Nazca lines post,
above). On the other hand, perhaps the fragments hold within them all
the answers, as they might well do in a holographic universe.

Hm, sorry to become so discursive.

I remember quite clearly, watching the news that day, that they were
discussing about possibly bringing down building 7 with demolition. The
anchors discussed it with an expert, even. They said that the structure
was on the brink of collapse anyway, but that everyone was most likely
evacuated so that some sort of CD was a good option. I got the
impression that this could be done on the fly, contrary to what people
usually say about CD. Perhaps the "C" part of CD would be less likely if
done quickly, but it would still be preferable to having the building
collapse on its own.

I also remember hearing them say that there were reports of snipers
on the roofs surrounding the WTC complex. For hours they talked about
it, it seemed to me.

It's always those little details, reports that persist or just stick
out like sore thumbs amongst the rest...when events give us live
reporting like that, it pays to pay attention to those sorts of things.
Maybe it's true, maybe not. Maybe important, maybe not. Maybe what it
seems, maybe not.

Again, I apologize for the discursion--these are things I've been
needing to get off my chest for a while and I don't get over here for
stimulating discussion nearly often enough.

jeff says: Kennedy's dead 43 years...Where do you think "9/11 Truth"
will be in 40 years? (As if we have that long.)

we don't have nearly that long. by 2043 (after the jfk-equivalent
interval), the ecological process will have run most of its course.

i think that cheney knew all about that process and what it portends,
and i think that he has done things in part because he could and in part
because he felt that he had to.

years ago i was greatly affected by robert heilbroner's book "an
inquiry into the human prospect," which was written during 1972. in it
he said, with anguish, that the ecological situation that humanity would
encounter in a few decades, which he anticipated pretty accurately,
would necessitate authoritarian forms of government.

heilbroner seems to have meant that authoritarianism would be needed
in order to implement policies that were in the public interest. but in
the actual event it appears that elites are getting ready to save
themselves and probably to do some winnowing among the rest of us.

jeff's excellent thumbnail of the 9/11 case in his 2:37pm comment is
a reminder that there isn't one piece of it that is going to bring the
public around, at least not yet. we don't know what will come to light,
but thus far the case is more or less on the jfk track.

meanwhile we encounter the peak and decline of oil and gas
production, the probably peak and decline in production of other
minerals, the depletion and poisoning of topsoil, the depletion of
fossil water, the continuing growth of the population, and unpredictable
climate change.

all of that will overtake us before we can find enough 9/11 truth to
affect the course of history.

The argument that authoritarianism may be necessary to carry out
unpopular policies during times of crisis may be one of those
semi-plausible falsehoods that only play into the hands of would-be
authoritarians. In fact, it seems far more likely to me that a
fully-informed citizenry with agreed-upon goals is the essential
prerequisite for major shifts of cultural direction.

There was a somewhat odd opinion piece by economist Joseph Stiglitz
in the Guardian today, headed "Development in defiance of the Washington
consensus: China has carried off the world's largest reduction in
poverty by grasping that market economies cannot be left on autopilot."

After going on at some length about China's attempts to lift its
people out of poverty, reduce economic inequality, and attend to its
environment, all at the same time, he reaches what I take to be his real
point:

With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge will be
implementation. China is a large country, and it could not have
succeeded as it has without widespread decentralisation. But
decentralisation raises problems of its own. . . . To translate its
vision into action, the Chinese government will need strong policies,
such as the environmental taxes already imposed.

As China has moved toward a market economy, it has developed some of
the problems that have plagued the developed countries: special
interests that clothe self-serving arguments behind a veil of market
ideology. Some will argue for trickle-down economics. And some will
oppose competition policy and corporate governance laws. Growth
arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental
policies. Such allegedly pro-growth policies would not only fail to
deliver growth; they would threaten the entire vision of China's future.

There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic
policies to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to
the challenges facing China. George Bush has shown the dangers of
excessive secrecy and confining decision-making to a narrow circle of
sycophants. Most people outside China do not fully appreciate the extent
to which its leaders, by contrast, have engaged in extensive
deliberations and consultations as they strive to solve the enormous
problems they face.

Link

Now, I don't know what Stiglitz's own agenda may be -- or the
Guardian's in publishing him -- or to what extent his rosy vision of
Chinese policy-making corresponds to reality. He may even be using China
the same way European social critics used it in the 18th century, as a
heavily idealized object-lesson in policies they wished to recommend to
their own governments.

But what did jump out at me from these paragraphs was a striking
contrast: that the United States can afford to move towards
authoritarianism and secrecy only because it has no shared vision and
isn't asking its people to aim for any demanding goals, whereas
autocratic China is forced to become more open and more decentralized in
its decision-making precisely because it is asking so much of its
people.

That notion is in striking contrast with the idea so widespread in
the US (including among liberals, though they tend to decry it even as
they subscribe to it) that authoritarianism (or torture, or any other
aspect of state coercion) may be the only way for a government to
respond quickly and efficiently in emergencies.

At the very least I'd like to see it given greater consideration.

<POSTER> WakeUp </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> ????-??-??T01:20:00 </POSTDATE>
Hi all,

I know I've posted in the last couple of entries about this, but
since the discussion is so relevant here, I wanted to point out that
many of the more damning points of evidence Jeff listed earlier are
discussed in All You Need To Know About 9/11 , the 93-minute first
episode of WakeUp , a new podcast which will circumnavigate the various
tentacles of the octopus before flying right up out of the water and
discussing physics, astronomy, geology, consciousness and more, in an
attempt to empower the listener with the biggest possible picture of our
situation and, most importantly, what we can do about it .

I disagree wholeheartedly that we are running out of time per se ,
but every day we stand by and let the police state take over is one day
closer we get to

barbed-wire fences pointing inward to herd us methodically into the
massive gas-fired ovens created by companies founded and contracted by
the criminal elite occult Nazi bastards who have taken over the System
and are now flaunting their treasonous fascist intentions for all to see
and cower before.

They think they channel the dark powers of Lucifer or whoever, but
whether they really >do< B> or not, they certainly don't have what the
Greeks and JW's call agape on their side, and that's about the only
thing humans have to use against them, and our one remaining truth in
this increasing sea of uncertainty. David Icke may be a polarizing
figure, but he's not wrong about the human experience of "infinite love"
being the only thing that isn't a holographic illusion. I feel it, and I
doubt I'm alone.

When Antonin Artaud said "there is no more firmament," I think he had
simply lost sight of the fundamental interconnectedness of all things,
the quantum super-state of existence, the Oneness of all being, and
those damned little DMT elves who are, as we speak, dilligently
maintaining the intricate machinery which comprises the fabric of
reality. :-D

We have more control than we realize, and I hope to effectively
document this evidence on WakeUp . for the next wave of truth seekers
just joining us, especially the increasingly-aware friends and relatives
of the contributors to brilliant blogs and discussion groups such as
this one. I hope my podcast helps people spread the truth a little
faster and easier, and hopefully with as little disinfo as possible.

Thanks, Jeff, for everything you've ever written, and also for RI
Radio -- if you give the first episode a listen, you'll know why. :-)

Take care and take heart!

understand your reluctance to "go the way of the Kennedy reaearch" with

every case IS unique and the uniqueness of 9/11 is that a building
collapsed (WTC7) in front of our very eyes in a manner of a controlled
demolition without any explanation. THIS IS THE CHINK IN THEIR ARMOUR -

Odd. I would have thought a site such as this one would be a place
where the idea that there were no planes at all on 9/11 might be easily
accepted - as a possible world, not a hypothesis that urgently requires
rigorous verification (or debunking for that matter), as that task might
be perceived as too complex or a waste of time, if not impossible.

Things are not what they seem, there are layers of reality,
interpretation and intuition must be marshalled to gain any
undertanding, be it interpretive or objective or whatever one fancies.

But no! CNN showed planes. That's it. Like it or lump it. It is often
said that those who claim there were no planes are fantasists,
self-agrandising conspiracy theorists, disinfo agents, governement
shills, hysterical groupies, and other suspicious people. Which goes to
show how one can selectively use the 'conspiracy' meme, turning it into
'distraction'.

Besides being epistemologically shortsighted, it seems to me that
such an attitude is pragmatically misguided. How this crime was carried
out is not only intimately tied to who carried it out but understanding
the means may serve to bring the culprits to justice.

I highly recommend carrying out an exercise in the imagination: What
if in fact, there were no planes? Where does that lead us? Is it not a
measure of sanity to question the media and the Gvmt? To entertain
possibilities?

------

Demolition wakes people up. It serves as a starting point, and
moreover latches into the intuitions of many people - they somehow could
not believe...but then did as 'it was so'...and now someone is saying
what they thought all along! Demolition, too, can enter the public space
because it is neutral as to guilt, it points the finger nowhere and
leads to no (few) conclusions, except for the fact that the Gvmt.
scenario is false. That's an important step, if in some ways
frustrating, because on has to ask, what next? However that the 9/11
truth community has through explicit strategy and because of the sway of
public events adopted Demolition as a 'wake up call talking point' is
clever.

It is clever (and was carefully thought out, I assure you, let me
give some of the reasons...), because the evidence is very compelling,
very strong, it is visible and physical, material; it concerns images
that were seen; the debunkers will be scientists, people of some
credibility and status.

Morevoer how the buildings fell or were originally damaged cuts to
the heart of the event.

Demolition (whether true or false) adresses the only core, rock hard,
certain, material result of the events of the day. (I mean no disrespect
to the dead, but the dead are an outcome of planes or bombs or melting
steel or whatever). The most parsimonious and brief description one can
give of the event is that "WTC 1, 2 and 7 fell down". This is
incontrovertible fact. Everything else can be questioned, has been
questioned, or seems tangential, or may be unrelated, etc. (I am not
saying all other things are, just that they can be considered to be so.)
So the reasoning is, and this is very important, one starts from the
result (insofar as it is known, can be described, etc.) to then address
*causes*. The first cause sought is the most *proximal cause*. This is
how logicians and experimental scientists think. And the concensus, for
the moment, is that the proximal cause is demolition, and not planes.
And certain conclusions follow from that. If you sweep away one unknown,
you gather some knows.

As for my knowledge of 9/11, lets just say it is considerable.

I admit I don't have the knowledge that many on this board (and
certainly Jeff) possess on 9/11. What I'm wondering at this moment is
this: are whole, unedited tapes of real-time media coverage on the day
and day after readily available anywhere?

I'd like to verify my memory of one news outlet or another (I
frantically switched between them all that day) saying that
*someone*--gov't, NYC, don't know--was considering demo of building 7,
and they had an expert on to discuss the possibility. I recall the
expert as being off camera, either via phone or simply because there was
a nearly uninterrupted stream of images broadcast.

I'd also like to verify my memory of reports of snipers on the roofs
around the area.

If we mean to pursue unconventional knowledge, then we need to aspire

Thanks Jeff for finally taking some firm and revealing positions. By

You reject demolition caused WTC collapse.

" admit belief planes caused the collapses.

" " " a plane slammed into the Pentagon.

" " " Hani Hanjour piloted that plane.

I could go on and on.

Your position is then much closer to the Bush regime official version
in 911 than many if not most of ours'. You even tell us the Bush and
oldtime Republicans are behind our views of 911.

To top it off, while disagreeing with us you've preached to us on
what strategy NOT to pursue (demolitions) to prove our belief the
government was behind 911. Thanks for the help. A bit disingenuous?

Hey, this is self-deprecation because I am buddy sitting at home in

UK-US memos, Sybil Edmonds, Larry Franklin, affaire Plame, mailed
anthrax, dead microbiologists, torture, theft of 100's billions, deep
politics as true political reality, and on and on. I am also the guy
that is now amazed to see the towers are exploding now, whereas before
they were "collapsing" due to fire.

Is it valid and just to win someone over with a sexy yet suspect
argument?

Sure it is. I do it every time I flirt with a woman : )

And what happens when it loses its sex appeal?

It will never lose it appeal because I am the one for her. (see above
re flirting) Seriously though, it is a specious argument to not pursue
something for fear it will be a bust later especially when you believe
in it.

James Fetzer of 911 Scholars for Truth writes of the dissenting
positions on various aspects of members of their association, that it is
normal for a field to have dissenting views (he was specifically
referring to a "former republican", Morgan Reynolds). Fetzer is
absolutely correct to accept that dissenting opinion occurs within
movements. Science is all about theory and hypothesis. To help separate
dissenting opinion from outright bollocks, Fetzer has proposed, and I
believe is in process of putting together a proper journal for 911
studies with an editorial board and review.

So, sure movements have their susceptibility to subversion but where
would we be without cooperative, social efforts? Better to have tried
than not.

"Newtonian parapolitics can't account for Magonia..."

Jeff I love this site precisely because you are attempting to map
uncharted territory in "Magonia." But what bothers me a bit is that I
get the feeling that you take the concept too far sometimes by
disregarding cold hard reality in favor of some type of soft reality
that you feel is being bent by Cthulu or somewhere.

Personally I think science is the only way to know the truth about
9/11 because any other path will simply take us down a road of he
said/she said magical thinking in which the truth can't possibly ever be
known.

So let me suggest another way of looking at "Magonia". Have you ever
considered the possibility that high strangeness and synchronicity is
not the work of some unknown beings out there but the workings of the
unconscious mind which itself is a part of reality?

Personally, I believe that parts of our govt. in collusion with other
govt. were involved with 9/11 and they are being protected because it
would expose widespread shady dealing in D.C. I ALSO believe that there
is a strange trickster effect occuring precisely because people fear the
truth.

If you read books on synchronicity you will see that this trickster
effects tends to manifest itself at times of extreme change or stress in
peoples lives. I think the same thing is occuring to our country as a
whole(of course in addition to the hidden trickery by some that is
helping to manifest it).

So the difficult part is figuring out what is Magonia and what is
parapolitics. Alot of things related to 9/11 fit into that murky Magonia
area of coincidence where it is hard to determine if something was just
a coincidence or was actually planned that way...like the whole wargames
thing... I believe it was planned to be used like a trojan horse... but
the question I can't resolve in my mind is : planned by WHO?

Proving demolition would bring us out of that murky Magonia space
down to hard reality. And yes there is a cold hard reality out there.
It's the thing that causes most of us not to be millionaires although we
would like to be.

So I don't think reality is being bent or warped... it is simply
being misreprensented or concealed... akin to a magician's stage trick.
There is nothing magical about synchronicity other than that material
things can come together in space in time in a way that you can't
*physically* explain. The magic of it is to understand that you and the
world in which you exist are ONE and that in such a world strange
coincidences in space and time can and do happen from a deeper source.

Still love the site although I disagree with parts of it. You are
still charting new ground and that is a good thing!

I could be mistaken, but I haven't gotten the impression that Jeff
has ever come out and said 'I don't believe controlled demolitions were
used to bring down the 3 towers.' What he's said is that without hard
physical evidence, he would be very reluctant to use that for the main
basis of arguing for an alternative explanation for the events of
9/11/01.

To me, it sure as hell looks like demolitions were used, but I'm not
an engineer. And yes, there are engineers and scientists who have
presented very compelling arguments that demolitions were used, but
unfortunately, the government doesn't seem to have any trouble producing
scientists and engineers who are willing to back up their version of the
story as well (sort of like medical doctors making supportive statements
for tobacco companies).

I personally don't see a problem using some of the 'sexier' stuff to
help shock people out of their usual frame of reference (even if it
isn't proof positive), as long as you've got other, if not quite as
shapely, legs to stand on. The main point, I think, is to get people to
realize that, regardless of how water-tight the alternative is, it's
painfully obvious that the official story has holes you could fly a 757
through, and it's up to each of us to determine the best way to do that
from our own perspective. And, this being Jeff's blog, it's up to him
how he wants to frame his argument.

And to tie this back into topic....

I've been circling the rabbit hole for some time now, but have been
reluctant to pass the event horizon. Fact is, though I've known several
people who claim to have witnessed paranormal events, I've never
personally experienced anything other than the occasional wild
synchronicity or deja vu, and I'm reluctant to believe that which I
haven't seen (been burned by blind-faith before).

Sooo, the RA stuff has always been one of the hardest things for me
to swallow. Not sure exactly why, because I have to concede that people
do some amazingly fucked-up things, but I think it has a lot to do with
the fact that the messengers have always seemed a bit too
hysterical/crazed for me to take seriously, and so I never pursued it.
Anyway, what originally drew me into the Rigorous Intution site was
Jeff's 'Coincidence Theory' post. From there, I began perusing the
High-Wierdness/Military/Occult stuff, and I have to say that, though I
wouldn't call myself a 'Believer', I strongly suspect that SOMETHING is
going on, and it appears to be organized and firmly entrenched in the
halls of power (regardless of wether you believe these people are
actually contacting dark forces, or if they believe that they are, or
are just using this all for mind control and political blackmail).

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that the way you deliver your
message is just as important as the message itself, and that not
everyone is going to be reached by the same approach. In this case, I
needed someone with Jeff's particular touch to allow me to seriously
consider the RA stories. Everyone needs to be free to tell the truth as
they see it.

exactly blogbart.

i was a little shocked by jeff's comment about movements.

i mean it's a very idealistic and adolescent idea to just completely
disown the idea of joining a movement simply because you think it will
inevitably be infiltrated. the fact of the matter is, you must grow a
tough skin, you have to use your brain. you have to work for what you
believe in.

jeff, what other option do we have but to organize?

nothing ever changes unless a group of people who are organized, with
a common goal raise awareness.

or do we just sit at home, staring at computers being armchair
revolutionaries?

you are part of a movement to expose the lies subjugating most of

" that the United States can afford to move towards authoritarianism
and secrecy only because it has no shared vision and isn't asking its
people to aim for any demanding goals, whereas autocratic China is
forced to become more open and more decentralized in its decision-making
precisely because it is asking so much of its people.

That notion is in striking contrast with the idea so widespread in
the US (including among liberals, though they tend to decry it even as
they subscribe to it) that authoritarianism (or torture, or any other
aspect of state coercion) may be the only way for a government to
respond quickly and efficiently in emergencies."

This raises some real issues about totalitarianism. (And ultimately
about getting apublic response on 911 and any govt
complicity/responsibility).

Ultimately successful authoritarian powers need the support of the
people. Nazi Germany could not have started ww2 if it had been torn
apart by internal strife (IMO) simply because at the start of the war it
was so organised and efficient. To compare the US today and Nazi germany
may be valid on many levels, but the Germans would have probably not
made the same mess of Iraq.

They would never have entertained the idea that Hitler was going
against THEIR INTERESTS. He appealed to their spirituality, and used
that to fuel the excessive nationalism of the time.

If the majority of the population feel they have neither the strength
nor the wit to achieve what someone claims "must be done for the
national interest", but that someone else does, perhaps they are willing
to submit to that authority, because they feel that they have no
strength themselves.

War focuses the collective mind, for millenia it has been a matter of
survival, a matter of first with the most wins. It creates a sense of
unity and a sense of purpose. It puts the ego in perspective against the
tribe or nation. Many of the things that spiritual discipline and the
like do for individuals, war does.

Maybe not for the soldiers in battle. But for those people who feel
the soldiers "represent" them.

If that sense of pupose and power have been unleased in the US
psyche, does anyone really think any evidence of anything is gonna make
a shred of difference.

War possesses souls. It fills up all the empty space that their (self
perceived) inadequacy has left. You can protest for or against the war.
Feel the outrage or the bloodlust, but iof it moves you to such
emotional extremes, the war has possessed you. Given you a greater
emotional range that you thought you were capable of without it.

Grief and compassion are the only suitable responses to war, (and joy
where you can find it) but since grief, joy and compassion are probably
the most suitable responses to most things...

War is about possession, of territory, of assets and of souls. It
even convinces pacifists that agressive emotional intensity is OK so
long ass its against "the war".

So my thoughts on 911 are this, and I guess are similar to Jeffs in
that regard:

"Let me ask you this: if it were established that there were
explosives planted, what would it prove?"

It would simply prove that explosives were planted.

Its already 5 years ago, so lets be careful about how we use the word
"proof" (legal, scientific and mathematical proof all have different
standards).

It would open all sorts of cans of worms about the trivial details of
the explosives.

Its a bit like busting people on a street corner for a $10 bag of
crack, in the hope of leading to Pablo Escabar or whoever has taken his
place.

The path from the event on the street to place or production/origin
is to complicated and back and forth to ever be of any use in tracking
our ultimate target.

In some ways whether the Dubya administration was even complicit in
the attacks is irrelevent. Their actions afterward have been base and
treasonous to someone outside the US looking in. Yet no one wants to
deal with these issues. (IE the US treatment of its own military in the
process of a blatent grab by its officials for cash.)

I suppose, if nothing else 911 was incredibly traumatic, and the
focus on it as some key to all the fascism that followed makes sense.

But now its a distraction from the reality of what is happening now.
I mean why are you still whinging about 911. What about Katrina for
Vucks sake.

"Have you ever considered the possibility that high strangeness and
synchronicity is not the work of some unknown beings out there but the
workings of the unconscious mind which itself is a part of reality?"

Ultimately such distinctions are also a distraction. Does it matter
if the effects in the world are caused by one or the other?

Not really. Become responsible for your actions, seek to cultivate
yourself and develop the talents you were born with.

However for those people that understand the high weirdness concept
and its implications, what would you say. Ignore those things cos they
are only unconscious projections of your own mind?

Perhaps high ritual is a process that only involves engagement of
those areas of our mind that we are normally unable to access. Not all
"altered states" are involved with high weirdness. I have played sport
for years, at a high level and have also been involved in many life
threatening situations with various causes and threat levels.

To be successful at the first, one must engage the mindset or
pathways that become active in the second. Often referred to as "fight
or flight", this state of mind would more accurately be called hyper
situational awareness from my perspective. Time moves at the pace you
choose in this state of mind, physical limitations are there, but far
beyond what you might normally assume were posssible, and information
processing is so far beyond what it is in my current state of mind.

The ordinary capabilities of a human are so beyond what we normally
give ourselves credit for, they are often referred to as magic, usually
in awed tones.

The extraordinary capabilities of a human can verge on the godlike.

A simple example is Aussie Rules football. The ball is oval shaped
and follows a random pattern when bouncing on the ground. If you focus
on it totally, you know where it will bounce. You see it hit the ground,
you notice the shape, the forces and where it will bounce to.

Doing this seems magical to onlookers. But it simply using your hand
eye coordination to its ... its doing what its designed to do. You don't
have to do the maths to work out the trajectory of the ball, its done
for you, by some sub or un conscious part of you. You are given the
results and that is the only part of the process you need - the
knowledge of where to be when the ball gets there.

However, there are times when you know the ball is beyond your reach,
you can see it bouncing away you know you can't get there. In those
cases sometimes it seems as if...

Ok I call to the ball with will and desire and it comes to me. Its
rare, but it happens. The ball seems to disobey the laws of physics.
Usually something spectacular follows.

Every good footy player I have ever seen has done this on more than
one occasion.

Is that an unconscious manifestation of the mind? Or of amgic? Whats
the difference.

BTW Micheal Franti just came back from Iraq.

He went to iraq with some friends, a guitar and a video camera. Spent
the days walking around playing music for people, and getting them to
talk about their lives since the war on camera, and show him something
to film and show the rest of the world.

He's been flogging the film on JJJ radio in Australia.

That is a sane compassionate and gutsy response to war.

Lets face it. It would be great to stop the war, but what about if we
all did what he did, just upped and went to make some human connection
with people who have suffered so much.

He is releasing a film about the whole thing.

He said some interesting things. The iraqi guides he was with warned
him not to film the American troops, as that was a sure way of getting
shot.

He also said he was shitscared the entire time, except when he was
playing music, it was the only time he felt safe, cos he knew no one
would hurt him while he was playing music.

Hows that for a stand, Charlie Sheen can say what he likes about
shit, lets see him go to Iraq and do street theatre or something. (That
would be good for a laugh, he'd last about a minute).

When any event seemingly defies reason or far surpasses even the
worst of probable or most likely outcomes, or in the case of the WTC
goes literally beyond the bounds of all previous knowledge and
experience, it is certainly neither reasonable nor logical to insist
that such an anomalous event be simply accepted at face value.

It has been stated by more than one former tenant of the WTC that
missed the fate that was planned for them on 9/11, that all the security
systems at the WTC had been completely overhauled only a little more
than a month beforehand.

They have also stated that while that occurred there was a period of
at least two full weeks during which there was no genuine security
system or cameras operating at all in which they were advised to take
extra precautions with their own suites.

Meanwhile all the entrance ways and exits to the buildings were fully
open and accessable to literally anyone as numerous technicians moved
throughout the buildings tearing out and removing old systems and
carting in and installing their endless crates of new "equipment" and
stringing wire throughout the complex.

So lets not pretend about any inability to possibly plant explosive
charges throughout either the WTC or any other structure when it comes
right to it.

Time and opportunity could either be fortuitously had, or made, or
even bought, by anyone with right kind of knowledge, connections,
planning expertise and sufficient cash behind them.

The problem here is that what we know even in the most common sense
from daily life directly clashes with what we've witnessed. I also
personally believe that that particular "psychological effect", and the
continuing debate that it has engendered was the only true purpose for
the purpetration of the crime.

Living in the heart of one of the largest cities in North America for
more than half a century now I have seen more than my share of
skscrapers both being built and torn down. Some for many months on end
right outside my 20th story balcony.

Now it's no easy or simple matter to take down any building and
besides using controlled explosives it's always an extremely difficult,
time consuming and very much a piecemeal affair that only increases in
difficulty the closer it gets to the ground.

Buildings are built from the ground up and from the inside out,
layered, overlapped, reinforced and layered some more. The whole being
incredibly stronger and far more unyielding to any exterior forces than
the sum of it's parts might ever suggest.

Their internal resistance and strength is by no means uniform either,
but a graduated affair from the tremendous strength growing from the
base that bears the entire weight as well as the immense windforces
thrown against all it's sheer surfaces to only modestly tapering off as
loads and stresses diminsh very much higher up.

Should any building fall from the top down that increasing resistance
heading downwnward would also just as increasingly and quite
dramatically slow the progress of any collapsing materials from above,
not simply go with the flow.

Now none of these simple facts or observations can just be set aside
regardless of any appearances to the contrary no matter how obvious the
situation simply looks.

I, as you likely do too, also know that jetliners, even the jumbos,
for all their imposing size are little more than lightweight buses with
wings that could certainly damage the looks of any tall skyscraper but
by no means ever level one completely to the ground. This too should be
patently obvious to any thinking mind.

So the jets themselves couldn't have caused any more damage than they
did on impact. If the buildings didn't immediately fall to pieces when
they were first hit there was no reason for them to fall later unless
something else entirely accounted for it.

At this point it is both prudent and reasonable to discount any
damage caused by the planes altogether, just as the firemen on the scene
did. The damage was localized on the affected floors themselves and the
superstructure wasn't compromised.

All that leaves is the fire itself. Now there have been more than a
few skyscrapers of similar design that have been completely gutted by
fires. Those fires generally took days to bring under control or burn
themselves out and none of those buildings ever fell or had their steel
frameworks or concrete floors even compromised.

Similar skyscrapers have even been shaken by massive earthquakes
which have twisted, distorted, and even partially caved-in portions of
them but once again none of ever them simply collapsed to the ground
like some house of cards.

We know or should know that neither a plane nor a fire nor even an
earthquake can or would disintigrate a skyscraper in the fashion that
was witnessed. Not singly or even collectively. Not even once let alone
twice and within mere hours. In the case of WTC7 there is nothing at all
to supposedly account for it.

The speed at which these massive structures are supposed to have been
completely compromised simply flies in the face both reason and all
known experience.

That speed also defied the reason, experience and quite professional
assessments of hundreds of professional firefighters and emergency
workers who staked but nevertheless lost their lives with the odds
clearly on their side.

So what else could have escaped observation by all those trained
professionals and just how could so very many of them end up "dead
wrong" as consequence?

Their assumptions about both the structural damage and the fire were
both first hand and ongoing throughout.

Are we to merely believe that their judgement was that uncritical or
unsound or is there reasonable suspicion for some other unpredictable
force at play?

Explosions were, however, reported by many witnesses. The janitor in
one of the towers not only heard an explosion in the basement he dragged
a badly burned victim from the basement and into the streets only
seconds before the building came down.

No one apparently wants that fellow's testimony or that of the
numerous witnesses that both saw and helped him to do it.

Now the main reason an elaborate and controlled demolition is
significant is that it places the planes themselves in a far different
context. They are not the event, merely the rallying call to come and
see it.

Not just a simple circus act in two parts to impress New Yorkers with
the outlandishness or reckelss abandon of any mere terrorist hijackers.
It becomes a contrivance to draw as many people and as much media to the
scene to witness the buildings coming down.

As a matter of fact as soon as that attention could be seen to have
reasonably peaked the first building was blown.

After giving the shock and dust just enough time to settle even if
people's wits hadn't, the second one followed to reinforce and hammer
home "the message".

So the conspiracy that needs to be tracked and found is not just the
one to blow the buildings but the one determined to create and use the
"psychological effect" from that to maximum advantage.

Everyone can do their bit ... The guy playing music in Iraq certainly

Charlie Sheen has got a lot to loose and he's put his kneck well over

machinations (although uf I were him I'd stay out of private planes for
the time being) but he's gone and made a stand in his way as a patriot
who does not want to see his beloved country completely overrun by the
Bush junk.

" it is certainly neither reasonable nor logical to insist that such

Nonetheless it has been accepted at face value and wars waged because
of it.

"They have also stated that while that occurred there was a period of
at least two full weeks during which there was no genuine security
system or cameras operating at all "

"so lets not pretend about any inability to possibly plant explosive

even bought, by anyone with right kind of knowledge, connections,

So even Al Quaida could have prepped the world trade centre. And who
knows what damage the 93 attack actually did, perhaps the building was
slightly more unstable. (Reason and logic are away for the eater hols
remember).

"At this point it is both prudent and reasonable to discount any
damage caused by the planes altogether, just as the firemen on the scene
did. The damage was localized on the affected floors themselves and the
superstructure wasn't compromised."

This is not necessarily true.

If the firemen die in the process of saving 2 individuls, perhaps
they would see their sacrifice as worth it. Regardless of structural
safety there are people in danger from fire, right now above 50 floors
somewhere.

Your job is their safety, you are paid and trained to do life
threatening work, in the assumption that if you do it right you will
save lives and not lose your own. Perhaps you can enter the building and
get everyone out before it falls. Perhaps you expect 2 minutes warning,
and the order and control you will bring to the situation mean more
people do get out in the time you spend in an unsafe building.

That assumption is neither reasonable nor prudent given the situation
and the fact that emergency workers are trained to do heroic things for
a living.

"So the conspiracy that needs to be tracked and found is not just the
one to blow the buildings but the one determined to create and use the
"psychological effect" from that to maximum advantage."

Perhaps, or perhaps things were as they were and what you are saying
is part of the psychological effect of a horrible random event and a
governments(Remember Dubya was a joke before 911, "Thats My Bush" and
all that) inability to protect us from it. We live in the illusion of
security after all. Remember Katrina? Compared to Larry, where they knew
they were basically "on their own".

Follow the money. What is insider trading? What inside?

Silverfox, I don't necessarily disagree with you, I agree, or at
least part of me feels that way. Part of feels that 19 people with box
cutters destroying the symbol of global capitalism is pretty
significant, and that saying the US government or some other non al
quida conspiracy is responsible takes away from the power of ordinary
people who are committed to their cause.

Pity about about all the dead people tho. Dunno if the price was
really worth it, probably not to be honest.

My point is that I agree with you on some levels, questions about the
collapse of the towers are there. But I am on your side and can find
those possible flaws in your arguement.

Anyway the questions that shouldn't go away are:

What is insider trading?

What is the inside?

One of the many ironies of 911 (some downright fortean) is what had
happened on that date in the previous few years, and what movements were
silenced as fundamentalist Islam was presented as the only alternative
to "western Democracy" bush style.

Too much weirdness surrounds 911. A very down to earth friend of mine
once remarked "I dreamt about planes 3 days in a row before sept 11th.
No plane crashes, violence or horror, just dreams of planes.

He didn't even think about it till afterward. His l;ife is about as
far from NY and planes and stuff as is possible, and it meant nothing
till afterward.

People moving money around in prior knowledge of the event has a
whole higher level of meaning. Much greater significance.

As Sam Vimes says "follow the money".

Yeah fair point.

I was just impressed, cos I like most of M Franti's music, and I am
glad to see him living up to the concepts he seems to sing about. Seems
a rare thing, that sort of integrity. Maybe integrity is the wrong word.
He has a sense of self as well as his image.

Good on Charlie Sheen, but I wish he'd follow up abit. One outbusrt
could be put down to a little to much coke. Consistancy over other
stuff, like money trails, would really improve his standing in my eyes,
thats just me tho. And generating momentum, he could if he made more
noise I guess, but then maybe hes having doubt's about some of the
details.

I guess that is why Jeff goes on about the money trail being the one
to follow. Details are one thing, cash tells its own story.

Just to make it clear: I don't fault Jeff Wells for not putting
towers' demolitions front and centre. Those who have should look at the
things he has put forward as more worthy of investigation.

He has signficant justification to consider pursuing the following as
more important:

"Omar Saeed Shiekh; Ptech;Dave Frasca, Mahmood Ahmed, Wally Hilliard,
Randy Glass, Michael Springmann, Robert Wright, Sibel Edmonds and Indira
Singh Jeb Bush's hand in purging flight school records."

I concede gladly that these things (and many others) have more
substantial in terms of actual documentation and people ie
whistleblowers, actual investigations, than do the purposeful demolition
of the WTC towers 1, 2 & 7.

I am just saying the towers' collapses were seen by nearly everyone.

sophisticated evidence and the more holistic viewpoint on 9/11 is what
is needed. It is only really by looking at it in the round and reading
the deep, and real, shit like Ptech that one begins to find out what is
REALLY going on. BUT keeping to demolition (and focussing on WTC7) has
two advantages: it can serve as an entrance portal for the unitiated
(some people thrive on being chucked in at the deep end - and Ptech IS
the deep end - but MOST like to go step by step) and 2/ it has the great
advantage that THEY START OFF ON THE BACK FOOT. Their explanations for
WTC7 are counter-physical, counter-intuitive, manifest bollocks. As
anyone knows, in normal/conventional forms of combat it's key to get
your opponent onto the back foot and then press home the advantage. For
whatever reason (folly/hubris or whatever) THEY HAVE GIVEN US THIS
ADVANTAGE!! (WE MUST NOT BE NEGLIGENT IN EXPOINTING IT - NEXT TIME THEY
MAY NOT LEAVE SUCH A GLARING FLAW IN THEOR CASE!)

Well Jules...

Your "doubts" and mistrust of your own judgement in the matter is
part of that overall "psychological effect" I was referring to.

It's like some spreading disease that weakens the cognitive processes
with feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty about the ability to judge
or determine the truth of things for yourself.

What I'm trying to tell you is the event was staged to get the
maximum emotionally shock AND just as importantly be incomprehensible,
inconcievable, or simply astonishing at the same time.

My point to you is that it wasn't any of that in reality. None of it.
Not the ruse to keep the hijackings a secret, the timing of the planes
crashing, and certainly not the "piece de resistance", the blowing up of
the buildings.

The whole thing was planned and scripted from start to finish right
down to it's mind (and body) blowing climax for maximum psychological
effect and minimal risk for those who actually staged it.

There was no blind "luck" or anything left to chance about any of it.

Everyone was set up like pins in a bowling alley with a little "high"
human drama and some arial action scenes worthy of Hollywood to keep
them looking up.

Meanwile the ball that was silently rolling down the alley right at
their feet had a fuse on it and they never knew what hit them when it
went off. Most still don't.

More than two thousand people were deliberately and brutally blown to
bits and incinerated right before the eyes of a completely unsuspecting
audience. Just think about that...hmmm?

No warning at all. No normal creaking, groaning or rending of steel
or popping of glass. No bending, shaking or tilting either. Just
"Prest-o-change-o!" and just like magic a huge piece of reality just
dissappears forever in a collosal puff of smoke!

And just in case you missed what a really fucking nifty trick it was
you got to see it again and the second tower went kabango the very same
way. Not to be outdone as a parting gesture these magicians even
sneeringly tipped their hand and took WTC7 with them too, but people
were just too dazzled and frazzled to notice. They still are.

All any mind could think of is "I don't believe this...", "This can't
be happening..." but it was, and it was real people just like you and me
that were permanently dissappeared in their thousands right along with
them too....

You don't want to believe it. You still can't believe it. No one
could possibly ever be as rotten, despicable, callous, and inhuman
enough to cold bloodedly calculate and carry out something like
that...hmmm? Staggers the imagination, doesn't it?

There just has to be some other explanation even if it's bizarre or
freakish, as long as it's got the remotest possibility it's damn sight
better than having to imagine or think about that...hmmm?

Well I have news for you. There are ruthless bastards who can and do
do those kind of things all the time. Not only that, there are whole
agencies chock full of them on the payroll of the US government who will
do that and a good deal more for the "America" they happen believe in.

Now if you want to co-opt and completely control something the size
of the United States, push it towards a fascist dictatorship, wage
unlimited wars for fun and profit and be able to walk away from it all
at the end of the day with a smile on your face and having wrung just
about everything and anything you possibly can out of it, that's exactly
what you do.

You simply deliver a massive and crushing blow to both individual and
collective psyches while everyone is totally off guard in the honest and
deep felt concern for what they are aleady intently watching and they're
putty in your hands after that.

And don't forget how Bush even helped to push that hopelessnes and
being out of it along by telling people essentially that there was
really nothing they could even do. He said the best thing to do was "go
shopping" for God's sake!

Perhaps to wander the streets and malls utterly stunned by just how
completely powerless and out of the loop they really were to have
nothing better to do about it than that...hmmm?

Well you're only "out of the loop" if you don't realize what you're
actually dealing with and what depths the real monsters behind this will
stoop to.

The event has already forced far too many as it is to simply defer or
abandon their personal power and judgement to "someone" or the "experts"
or higher "authorities" who simply must know better...hmmm?

If people can't trust their own eyes and judgement on this key
element they can't trust themselves on any of the other equally
important things that were served up right in it's wake, or question or
logically challenge the altogether disturbing oddities and anomalies in
them either.

So the Patriot Act, the war and so forth all roll forward, despite
the fact that they're not quite making any real sense either and minds
are all still locked in that same damaged pattern of looking for a
bizarre or freakish excuse any excuse rather than face the reality of
what they are too.

Now in the little matter of rescue workers, firefighters and other
emergency workers. They are NEVER allowed to place their lives directly
in harms way regardless of who or what is at stake, nor do they ever
allow themselves the luxury of being anything but practical and level
headed even in the worst possible scenarios imaginable.

They are literally "drilled to death" on their methodolgy and always
aware that to deviate from it in any way can only make things worse for
all concerned. Every risk is carefully balanced, every avenue of escape
duly noted and confirmed. Equipment and additional staff are all well
placed ahead of everything and based on options. There is NEVER any move
forward towards that danger without enough of those options on the table
to ensure they all come back alive.

DEMOLITIONS AS A HEGELIAN DIALECTIVE

Demolitions is a powerful Hegelian Dialectic tool for us to give the
New World Order a taste of their own medicine, i.e, Thesis, Antithesis,
Synthesis; or Problem, Reaction, Solution.

Thesis = Problem = "3 Demolitions occurred on 911."

Antithesis = Reaction = "People everywhere wake up, and get very
angry."

Synthesis = Solution = "Innoculation from further manipulation, catch
and punish the criminals, & restore freedom in America."

The beauty of it is it's a true thesis (unlike the Illuminati's
normal thesis' like 911 itself, all founded on webs of deceit).

The more they try to debunk demolitions with false arguments, the
dirtier they look, the more attention they give the demolitions, the
more others wake up, and the more angry everyone gets. At some point the
anger will explode and be unstoppable.

The terror of 911 is being replaced by anger, not at innocent Muslims
but at domestic parasitic tyrants who hide behind them.

Therefore let us CONSTANTLY play the hand that we have, especially if
it's a good one like demolitions is.

911 was immensely bold and clever but as a crime it will fail
miserably because it's arrogance forgot to cover all the DNA traces
leading to the foul rabbit hole.

Hi Folks -- Rudy Giuliani here.

Now is the time to admit that it's true. We did demo WTC7. You see,
the building was on fire, and we couldn't stop it before it spread. We
had to keep the demolition on the down low because the place was loaded
with asbestos and we didn't exactly have the proper permits. (Now
there's probably going to be a lot of lawsuits, but oh well.)

As for it taking "weeks" to plan a demo, nonsense. Blowing up burning
buildings is a standard Fire Dept procedure for a century, and they've
got the necessary plans for everything in lower Manhattan.

I gotta hand it to you conspiracy dogs hounding us on this one. The
truth may never have come out! I take full 100% responsibility.

As for WTC 1 & 2, let's just say that some Sicilian families were
involved in the construction. Before my time! I suggest you consult your
Conspiracy Almanac of 1975.

Cheers,

Rudy

Jeff,

Good job staying the course in the face of all these trolls who seek
to derail our collective train of thought. Or should that be a train of
collective thought? You can tell these thread-jackers are intentionally
trying to derail you, not only because they bring up 9-11 regardless of
what the discussion is currently centred on, but, more importantly, by
the trollish way they ignore (or show their ignorance of) your nuanced
arguments and perspective on 9-11 which is laid out clearly in many past
posts. If you feel like writing an article on WTC#7, go ahead and do so;
but, do it when you're ready, if you want to. Your blog, your writing,
your thoughts are nothing except what you choose for them to be. Reminds
me, though, of a phrase I love to quote from time to time: "The mind has
no firewall" (attr: US mil, or course).

While I'm in the middle of ranting and rambling, let me give a shout
out to starroute, dougoboy, kris, and all the others who consistently
make the comments worth reading!

Material rationalism has its uses, or its relevance in the minds of
many, so .. anyway I am rather attached to it!

As for passports, the passport found in the WTC rubble was reported
as that of Satam al Suqami (many alternate spellings.)

It was found by a NY cop and turned over to the FBI, as found
passports are supposed to be given in to 'authorities.'

Now, I am not an expert on Arab names. But a short burst of google
will show that many Arab names in their shortened Western versions boil
down to very common ones, equivalent in English to John Roberts, Alan
Smith, James Brown, and so on, as the second or surname adopted is often
a tribal one. Tribes can be up to 100 000 strong I have read (no
personal knowlege.)

For example, the distinctive and unique (?) Mohamed Mohamed Elamir
Awad Elssyed Atta becomes MOHAM ATTA on a flight manifest.

Found passports and so on are splendid red herrings, accidents
created by busibodies, hype, poor (or on the spot) reporting, Gvmt.
silence and the indignation of nay-sayers who are very cleverly never
corrected.

Silverfox has it right I reckon.

Ppl can't believe it. They just well...can't. If they believe in
conspiracy, it is Ptech, foreknowledge acquired by reckless or canny
traders, many other things, but the fullblown 'reality' of the WTC 1,2,7
being brought down by planes is *just so*. (Never mind the bombed out
WTC 6, and more.)

P. S. Magonia went right over my head. never heard of it it.

I originally came to this site shortly after discovering the
"Coincidence Theorist's Guide to 9/11", but your far-ranging, essential
work continues to draw me back.

As you said, we ARE responsible to wake ourselves up. To pretend to
be more "awake" is to , but unless there is something compelling to get
them out of bed, they'll go back to sleep. And the sound of thermite
from across the river may indeed be a wakeup call to some, but once the
fireworks have subsided, is it time to pack up the lawnchairs and head
home, or

LHO was the lone gunman is to the JFK story.

as

Controlled Demolitions is to the 9/11 story.

Computer artists who "recreate" Dealey Plaza, proving that a kill
shot COULD have been fired from the Book Depositiory, do nothing to
invalidate LHO's past as a CIA and FBI asset.

Computer artists who "recreate" airliners impacting the WTC, to prove
a foregone conclusion do nothing to invalidate Atta's visit to Jack
Abramoff's gamblin' river boat, or the $100,000 that Mahmoud Ahmed sent
to him a month earlier.

If one is to use fireworks to wake up a slumbering friend, I always
recommend having a hearty breakfast ready for them, before Morpheus
reclaims them.

Starroute said:

"How real do you dare to get?"

That's what I posited, in my own fashion, in my comment at/near the
end of the Abaddon thread.

I believe the collective pent-up emotional energy being denied by
most individuals can shift this planet's situation for the better if
released SAFELY. Blame, but do it in private. Pure wordless Sound
vibrates change. Read my other comment for more context.

We need more of us to be practicing this. This is a very real,
practical thing we can all do to change it Out There. In the privacy of
our own rooms, cars, etc.

Guilty as charged, it is not wilful.

But, hey man, I am just some chump who sees something wrong, wants to
make it right. Don't confuse my singlemindedness and lack of elegance
with trolling.

I do confess to often leave a post thinking, aw damn, I am off topic.
Its not that the subtleties escape me; I can't articulate them like Jeff
can. That's why I am here.

Jeff, that's what you get when you talk to Philistines : )

Please don't lose that subtle feeling. I am listening.

Hello these are interesting comments. May the holy Lord bless you in
his Word.

Former Rep. Charles Key of Oklahoma stated the fact that it is an
outrage that the US gov't is investigating itself. This relating to the
9/11 tragedy. Yes we are charging the US gov't with organizing,
subcontracting, and covering up the terrorism of that day. People in
high places of the State Dept., FBI, Wall Street, and military being the
prime suspects along with the executive branch in Washington. But this
will never be tried in a criminal court. The federal gov't will not
indict itself.

I'd like to share some uplifting thoughts. On December 8, 1999 a
Memphis civil court jury had ruled in favor of the Martin Luther King
Jr. family's wrongful death lawsuit versus Loyd Jowers "and other
unknown co-conspirators." Loyd Jowers was never their primary concern
though. The Kings and their lawyer William Pepper charged the US
intelligence agencies - particularly the FBI and Army intelligence with
the death of Martin Luther King Jr. The twelve jurors after the historic
3 1/2 week trial ruled that the federal government is guilty as charged.

Historic is an understatement.

This knowledge is on the web at www.ratical.org/ratville/ The
Ratville Times.

So what do you think about that? Guilty as charged.

Guilty as charged.

Guilty as charged...
