MAKING SOY MILK
-- WITH OR WITHOUT A MACHINE

A person asked a question about a Soy Milk Maker in another
group/forum.  My response may be of interest to readers
here.

-----------------------

I read your post about a Soy Milk Maker and I thought I'de
take a stab at it to help you and other readers out.

I've had an automatic soy milk maker since 2002 although I
have been making soy milk off and on since the 1970s using
simple kitchen equipment that you probably already have --
more about that later.

My first machine stopped functioning correctly after the
third batch. I returned it for an exchange. My machine was
manufactured by Shunde Keshun (China.) Although I can still
use the machine, and I do so from time to time I have to be
very careful to prevent &quot;foam overflow.&quot; This is a problem
that has been discussed on Internet forums by others who
own various soy milk makers and is a concern.

POINT: Be careful when and if your purchase one that there
is a return policy and a warranty.

POINT: Although I can use mine, you may not want to be
bothered by the extra precautions that I have to take.

POINT: The more people that can provide you with their
experiences the better off you are in making a decision.

SOY MILK MAKER MACHINES

There are many machines on the market.  Not all of them
will be available to you and it is impossible to tell from
the write-ups which is the one for you -- but you can get
some sort of an idea.

Lots of people seem to like the SoyaJoy models.  This was
one of the early ones that had WEB presence and were
available for purchase, so much of the forum writings
centered around this machine. Also, their WEB site is
probably one of the best for presenting information and
propaganda (not necessarily a bad word) for their machine
and soy milk. You should at least take a look at
http://www.soymilkmaker.com/

When I was looking, years ago, I found it too expensive
when compared to others, but I just noticed that they are
discounting it for a while with almost $50 off for a $90
sale price. To compare, most soy milk machines run between
$60 and $150 with some topping $200. I believe that these
expensive ones also shine your shoes.

There are other popular models on the market that you can
see on the Internet such as Soyabella, SoyQuick, SoyLover,
Tayama, SoyToy, HomeSmart, etc.  Check out Amazon.com
http://amazon.com &quot;soy milk maker&quot; for some information.

Other popular ones include the Salton, Miracle Soy Wonder,
Hurricane Soy Milk Maker, etc.

reviews are probably valid someone once wrote that some
reviews, like these, may be &quot;salted&quot; by the sellers.

SOY MILK MAKER FORUMS

Although there used to be several USENET groups that had
regular conversations going about soy milk and soy milk
makers -- I don't see them anymore [If you find them let me
know.] Perhaps the popularity of the machines have
diminished, or, they are so good now that no one needs to
discuss them anymore.

PLACES TO BUY SOY MILK MAKERS

If you are fortunate enough to live in cities that have
large Asian sections -- like San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Las Vegas -- to name a few, you can find great Asian
electronics stores where a variety of soy milk makers are
on display and you can ask questions (hopefully the clerk
will know the answers) and have a hands-on comparison.

Anyway, stores such as the LA area's Marukai Market
(nicknamed the Costco of Asian Markets), Las Vegas'
Chinatown Plaza (99 Ranch Market), and San Francisco's
Asian electronic stores (I think on Pacific between
Stockton and Grant -- someone correct me if they are more
accurate with the location) have many on display.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR

Some things you should look for:

- The container (where the milk is heated should be glass
or stainless steel)

- The technique of adding the beans -- some you can load
the strainer basket before hand others you have to funnel
the beans into the basket after the unit is closed. Don't
think that putting the beans in the basket first is
necessarily the best, for the cutting blade will later have
to go into the same area and it may be a chore negotiating
it in.

- How much soy milk will it make at one time.  Mine makes
5 cups which is fine as I am single. But if you have a
family who drinks much do you want a bigger device.

- How easy is it to clean -- mine is HARD. The milk cakes
on the heating element and has a tendency to burn.  It is
difficult to remove the cake.  Some units don't use an
immersible heating element and heat from the bottom of the
unit.  I've never used one of these but it sounds like a
good idea.

- Usually the container of all models is very easy to clean.

- With some you have to be extremely careful not to splash
water where it can get to the electronics. If your unit is
very heavy, this might be a task.  So weight of the unit is
a consideration.

- How easy is it to clean the bean holding filter basket?
It can be of fine mesh so you will have to treat it with
care while cleaning -- or you might puncture it.

- If you order a maker from an overseas Asian source (not
recommended incase of a problem) make sure it is for 110
Volts not 220 Volts.  Probably not a good idea anyway
because it might be lacking the UL approval unless they
have a US inspector at their factory.

- Cost may be a concern. Will the more expensive machine
be better or will the cheaper one be more cost effective?
[I don't know - you will have to judge] I make most of my
soy milk without the use of a soy milk maker machine -- see
below.

USING DRY OR SOAKED BEANS

Some models of soy milk makers can produce soy milk from
both dry and soaked soy beans. It is generally agreed that
you should soak your beans for 6 hours even though your
machine might be able to use dry beans. The strain on the
machine, plus the lower quality of soy milk produced is
generally not desired.

MAKING YOUR SOY MILK WITHOUT A MACHINE

When I first started making soy milk, over 30 years ago,
it wasn't for drinking.  I was using it to make home made
Tofu -- which I still do from time to time. The same soy
milk that I make for Tofu can be drunk as soy milk.

The quick recipe is:

Soak beans for 6 hours
Grind beans with a little water in Smoothie Machine till a
fine puree then add more water.
In Microwave heat till just boiling and maintain simmer
for 5 minutes.
Strain okra (solids) from soy milk
Add flavoring and sweetener if desired and store soy milk
in refrigerator.

-----

- Soak beans for 6 hours

I've tried using dry beans but soaking first is preferred.
You don't want to soak for too long and six to eight hours
seems about right. I believe the structure of the bean
begins to change if you soak the beans for double digit
hours.  What I like to do is to soak a bunch of beans [Use
ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER - or water at 70F degrees; don't use
hot water] the required time in lots of water, rinse a
couple of times, and store them in small baggies in 1 cup
amounts in the freezer. Then, when I am ready to make a
quart batch I just thaw the beans under running water in a
colander and I am ready to go.

- Grind beans with a little water in Smoothie Machine till
a fine puree then add more water.

I use a Smoothie Maker Machine although a blender will
work as well. Place the beans in with just 1 or 2 Tbs. of
room temperature water and turn the machine on.  What you
are trying to do is to make a puree without lumps. If you
add too much water you will probably produce unwanted
chunks. Dribble in additional water very slowly with
machine running -- scraping sides if necessary. Remember,
no chunks. Increase your flow of water till you've added a
little over a quart of water. You don't have to be too
accurate.

You can use a food processor too. But, again, add water in
very little amounts at first and stop to scrape the sides.
You must make sure you have processed enough so that it is
a puree.

- In Microwave heat till just boiling and maintain simmer
for 5 minutes.

I place the liquid in a wide top Pyrex bowl or pitcher of
at least 2 quarts or more of volume and heat the mixture in
a microwave. My microwave has a great temperature probe so
I don't have to watch it. I bring it up to 200 degrees -- I
don't have to worry about it foaming and overflowing. From
this point I continue to microwave causing it to boil. I
watch for the rise in foam -- the bigger the bowl and the
wider the rim the less foaming will take place. If it
starts to foam to the rim of the bowl I stop the microwave
for 5 seconds or so, the foam immediately dissipates, and I
continue to microwave. After 5 minutes of this -- I am done
with this step.

You can use a pot on the stove for this BUT you'll
probably burn the milk and impart the burnt taste to the
milk.

You might try a double boiler, or make one yourself with a
pot with the soy liquid resting in a pot of boiling water
or a glass bowl in a pot of boiling water -- make sure you
have a small grate or lift on the inside bottom of the
large pot so that the inner pot or bowl only sees the hot
water and not the bottom of the hotter pot.

- Strain okara (solids) from soy milk

Filter the okara from the soy milk.  You can use cheese
cloth resting in a round colander (but don't -- see my
suggestion). You might try using a metal coffee filter
basket or a yoghurt filter basket. Layers of cheese cloth,
which is normally recommended, tends to clog and is very
difficult to clean. Several layers of &quot;tulle&quot; (bridal veil
material -- use the finest mesh)(available cheaply in
fabric stores) is better.

** FANTASTIC FILTER **
***********************

But strangely the best, and I found this by accident, is a
Japanese shower cloth (Beauty Skin Cloth) named Salux.
