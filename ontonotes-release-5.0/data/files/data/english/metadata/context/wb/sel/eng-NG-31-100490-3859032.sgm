So, have a question for you regarding that power booster you
recently replaced on you '91 C4.
Do you have cruise control/ASR/ABS?

I have both and I'm have a bitch of a time giving the booster
enough room to pull it with the MC &amp; ASR unit unbolted but
still attached. As it is I have already broken a vacuum line
from the ASR to the manifold (probably needed to be replaced
as it was VERY brittle).

This didn't look as easy to me as you described.
Am I missing something?

I'm not familiar with ASR or what components it surely places in your
way.  My '91 has cruise control and ABS.  The ABS module is in the rear
of the car and had no affect on the procedure.  The cruise control
actuator had to be removed (I might have forgotten to mention that in
the other thread) - just four screws, the cable, and the connector were
all that had to go (don't forget which hole the cable is hooked into).
I might have been able to work the booster out around the cruise
control actuator but I figured it would probably break the cable.

Is the frame brace in the way?  Could it be moved enough?  Perhaps
removing the side body panel and the battery would make it easier to
drop the booster out from the bottom.

Got it in.
Seems the '91's didn't have ASR as an option.
Had the disconnect the module to give the MC the room it needed.
And the vacuum harness that I broke is a discontinued part.
The good news, Vintage Parts 877.846.8243 had it in stock.
And they didn't gouge me on the price.
I did have to remove all the bolts on the brace.
And thanks for the tip on the extention, it saved me an additional
trip to the store.
Noticed LOTS of brittle/dry lines/hoses as well.

Anyway thanks for the input!!!
