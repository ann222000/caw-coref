National extinction and natural law
By Spengler

National Geographic made headlines last week out of my favorite object
lesson in human frailty, namely the extinction of half the world's
languages by the end of the century (some other estimates are even
more alarming). But it is not just the Nivkh of the Siberian tundra or
the Kapayo of the Amazon rain forest who will disappear. At present
fertility rates so will the Russians, Japanese, Germans and Italians,
not to mention the Persians.

The death of a culture is an uncanny event, for it erases not only the
future but also the past, that is, the hopes and fears, the sweat and
sacrifice of countless generations whose lives no longer can be
remembered, for no living being will sing their songs or tell their
stories.

When nations go willingly into that dark night, what should we
conclude about human nature? Unlike extinctions of the past, today's
cultures are dying of their own apathy rather than by the swords of
their enemies. People of dying cultures kill themselves at a frightful
rate, as in the case of Brazil's Guarani Indians, who after their
displacement from traditional life have the world's highest suicide
rate. I long have argued, for that matter, that the Arab suicide
bomber is the spiritual cousin of the despondent aboriginal of the
Amazon rain forest (Live and let die, Asia Times Online, April 13,
2002).

In the ancient world of perpetual war, nations perished by violence,
and it was assumed that they would have preferred to survive. The
modern world, with few exceptions, removes the violent threat to the
national existence of small peoples, yet the rate of their extinction
by strictly voluntary means is faster than ever before in history.

We find it hard to come to terms with the suicide of an acquaintance;
how do we come to terms with the suicide of a nation? In the aftermath
of World War I, Sigmund Freud claimed that human beings possessed a
death-drive as much as an instinct for self-preservation. If we judged
by the numbers alone, we would have to agree with Freud, given that
most of the world's cultures, advanced as well as aboriginal, seem
likely to annihilate themselves.

Freud offered in effect a Satanic parody of the old-fashioned Catholic
view of &quot;natural law&quot; (today's Catholic view is more nuanced). The
Catholic Encyclopedia of 1911 defined it as &quot;those instincts and
emotions common to man and the lower animals, such as the instinct of
self-preservation and love of offspring. In its strictly ethical
application - the sense in which this article treats it - the natural
law is the rule of conduct which is prescribed to us by the Creator in
the constitution of the nature with which He has endowed us.&quot; Sadly,
most human societies evince no instinct for self-preservation, and
certainly no love of offspring, for they do not bother to have
sufficient offspring to survive.

No matter what assumption we make about God and human nature, we land
in logical trouble. If our nature inclines us toward the moral law
without the help of revelation, it is not clear why God is strictly
necessary. That was the position of the Catholic Church as of the
First Vatican Council (1870), which proceeded from the view of St
Thomas Aquinas. Again, the Catholic Encyclopedia:
Theoretically speaking, man is capable of acquiring a full knowledge
of the moral law, which is ... nothing but the dictates of reason
properly exercised. Actually, taking into consideration the power of
passion, prejudice, and other influences which cloud the understanding
or pervert the will, one can safely say that man, unaided by
supernatural revelation, would not acquire a full and correct
knowledge of the contents of the natural law (cf Vatican Council, Sess
III, cap ii). [1]
In this system, God isn't strictly necessary, merely convenient,
because humankind is &quot;capable of acquiring a full knowledge of the
moral law&quot;, although prone to mistakes without the aid of supernatural
revelation. That helps explain why a certain kind of Marxist
philosopher always has found it easy to become a certain kind of
Thomist; in both cases, nature is in the driver's seat. [2] Either
human reason can work everything out on its own, or it can't. Natural
theology leaves humankind half-pregnant with reason.

It does not help much to reject natural theology and argue instead for
&quot;divine command ethics&quot;, in other words, to assert that what is good
is simply what the Bible (or some other preferred scripture) tells one
to do. That was the view of Karl Barth, the great Reformed theologian
of the 20th century. Whatever the Bible might require, humankind still
is God's creation, and if God intended us to hearken to his
revelation, he must have made us capable of responding to it in some
fashion.

There must be some correspondence, in other words, between the nature
of human beings and any divine revelation that makes it possible for
humans to accept Grace. We know that there is a correspondence between
nature and the human imagination, or we would not have discovered
planetary orbits or split the atom; why should there not be a
correspondence between nature, that is, Creation, and the imagination
of our hearts? If it is divine love that elicits from us a response to
Grace, how can we separate our capacity to respond to love from our
nature?

Thus the debate between &quot;natural theology&quot; and &quot;command ethics&quot;
continues around the circle, and I see no end to it. Of course, we can
argue that some people are pre-programmed to receive grace and others
are pre-programmed to reject it, but that is no more satisfying than
Freud's contention that some people follow eros while others follow a
death-drive. We are left watching Â .. (cont)

Fertility rate of Russians, Japanese, Germans and Italians are going
down, Â not to mention the Persians. Â How comes National Geographic not
mention America?

I mean white fertility rate Â going down while Mexican/Hispanic/Latino/
Chicano rate is going up. Look at the street. Most mom strolling on
street with babes are Mexicans or Latino. Many are anchor babes. Is
this not amazing the worrying of disapperance of human race simply is
not possible in growing and expanding Â Mexican and Latino race in this
society? Â What race disappering in my city my state is Â White race of
all economic class from underclass to upperclass. Lowerclass white
Americans are throwing out in street. They don't produce children
living in the bottom at the foodchain. So is the middleclass whites
and upperclass. All white class on economical foodchain is facing
lower fertility rate. It's happed all state while the Mexican/Lation/
Chicano/Hispanic is growing and expanding more faster than any race.

The odd is National Geographic does not want to tell the truth about
the growing and expanding Mexican and Latino race and it's consequence
of the dying American culture. It's about what border, soverignty and
language do matter
that Liberal media like Â NG do not want to admit it.
