I was very much cheered by the news that Saddam had found his way to the end
of a rope and I'll bet you a ton of money so were thousands upon thousands
of others. It wasn't a pretty sight but served him fucking well right.
There's a ridiculous essay in today's paper by Andrew Roberts claiming that
Saddam - as well as Stalin and Pol Pot - were brave as a well as evil.
Hasn't he ever heard of psychopaths?
In George Orwell's day - he was anti-death penalty - people were hanged far
too often and for trivial offences. We have a different problem in the
modern world: far too many people getting away with far too much.
Of course, the Labour Party ought to be concentrating on reinstituting the
death penalty for certain cases of murder here in England instead of getting
the poorly-equipped British Army (adequate body armour or gay rights
counsellors? Socialism knows the true answer) gallivanting around distant
serfdoms helping to hang foreigners. The prigs never miss an opportunity to
prig off about the death penalty - though I never hear them getting too
outraged about violent murder being committed: probably because violent
murder is committed by 'the underprivileged' or because murder and mayhem
doesn't actually exist, it's just a racket got up by the Daily Mail to make
people dislike certain sections of society.

If Orwell was dodging around now, I have a horrible feeling he'd end an
essay with one of those sign offs that must make his essays troublesome
reading for a modish lefty: '...but given the choice between seeing an oaf
serve an easy six years for kicking a father to death in the street over a
small altercation or seeing him plunge through a trapdoor with a rope around
his neck...'

Happy New Ear - as Van Gogh used to say.

They always spout that poverty is not associated with crime, but their
own think tank report is suggesting the building of more prisons due
to the predicted effects of the forecast economic downturn.

Roberts does have a point, in a country and region full of hot headed
psychopaths you better ensure there isn't a more fuckwitted psychopath about
to dethrone you, so in a way he must have been brave to hang on so long (you
can say the same for Blair), there's plenty of people out there in Iraq
publicly auditioning their tyrannical ambitions on a daily basis. Thousands
of fully kitted out US and British troops certainly can't hold the fucking
place together despite their best efforts yet Saddam managed to do it for
over three decades, so you have to give him some credit, he clearly
understood his native land better than London or Washington ever will.

Robbie, I thought you had shifted your views to that of the modern British
left and anti-war lobby, the contention being that Iraq is just another
backwards, irredeemable and ungovernable state deeply divided along ethnic
and tribal lines in a de facto civil war, incapable of basic democracy or
functioning as a nation state. That's what makes the Indy and Today so
enjoyable sometimes, they've totally hung their little Iraqi trade unionist,
feminist and academic friends out to dry along with their former
international leftism, this speaks volumes.

Perhaps it's because all forms of violent murder are illegal. You of
course hear people get outraged about murder all the time, but you
choose not to listen so you can make your ridiculous little "points"
like this one.

You have a horrible feeling? You have a case of wishful thinking, you
mean. Do you not know what anti-death penalty means when you say
that's what Orwell was?

Hrm, so why was Saddam only tried for the killing of 148 Shias and a
comparable number of Kurds in the second trial, was the >1m killed in the
Iran/Iraq war, for example, some form of legal violence and sanctioned
murder undeserving of punishment?

As a riposte I suggest you implicate Western support in the campaign
therefore introducing a nice undercurrent of hand-wringing.

I'm not surprised, because I believe the Iraqi government has no
legitimacy. But they mustn't try to pretend it was all done under the
rule of law and due process. In particular, our own government, via
the likes of Blair and Beckett, should be ashamed of weaselling their
own supposed opposition to the death penalty by reference to Iraq's
sovereignty.

In the first place, Iraq is a broken state that cannot claim to even
be a nation, let alone a sovereign one. In the second place, there is
no sovereignty under military occupation. In the third place, the
Americans arrested Saddam and held him the whole time he was being
tried. They turned him over at five to six on Saturday morning, and
took delivery of the corpse at about ten past. We've all by now seen
that they handed him over -- in flagrant breach of the Geneva
Conventions -- to a lynch mob of masked men representing one of the
warring factions, and not at all to any sort of governmental
authority.

The logical next step would be to try the US official holding Saddam
in custody for war crimes. And whoever else may have approved his
handover. But do you think the Americans really believe in the rule of
law?

Yeah, cos its not like the lynch mobs in the Old South were
christians, and its not like the UK got rid of hanging at
the exact time, the late 60's when everything went to pot
according to you.

Am I right in my belief that the Plutonium we produce goes to the States
to be turned into nuclear(*) weapons, and we buy, borrow or rent those
weapons?

(* Or "nucular" if you prefer.)

I have often heard it said that the British nuclear (and don't be
snotty) deterrent was independant only in name.I don't know the facts
but this policy has been pursued by different democratically acountable
governments since the end of  WW2.Maybe it has something to recommend
it.

Surely that is all just a yaboo sucks argument from those who oppose
the nuclear deterrent at all costs?
If Britain has live warheads in its submarines that seems independent
enough to me even if some of the parts are made abroad.-unless you
subscribe to the view that the US is an evil empire I suppose and
expect to be attacked by them when it suits their whim.
If the warheads are live on the subs how can they be kept in storage in
USA?
