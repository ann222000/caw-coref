hi everyone.
my name is tracy ,and i wanted to sound in on this subject if its ok.
i raise game chickens. its against the law right now to fight them and
jail is not my
idea of raiseing birds.
the game chicken in my learning is misunderstood by everyone.
even the people that fight them.
when a person dose as i have done and trys to raise these birds
in a natural invironment ,they will see a bird they have never seen
before.
or should i say a flock. ive spent a little of my lifes, time ,trying
to understand there real
nature ,i did this by introdusing a flock into the wild.
or as close as i could to a certian point.
these are the things ive learned.and some of the understandings ive
realized.
game birds are the wild chicken. the jungle fowl is its oldest known
relitive.
but is not the sole producer of the modern chicken.
the traits it takes to live in the wilds of our world has shaped the
gamebird.
these traits or natural ability to live are present to keep the birds
alive.
everything about these birds and the things they do are done for the
flocks sake
as a whole. the pecking order has a very needed place in there world.
it keeps only the strongest of the flock alive.
and in a world where everything loves to eat chicken they better be
strong.
the roosters fight each other to prove there worthyness to the flock.
everything wants a strong leader and the game bird lives by this
natural rule of life.
even the hens will kill each other at times.
in a flock of game birds there is a pecking order that sets the stage
of life for the flock.
the best hens will live and the best rooster will live......
never do these birds try to change this rule. its brutal but no more
so then a cat eating a mouse.
or a dog eating a cat or lion eating a gazell .
gambling is the motivator to most modern pitts of the world today.
but in years long past having a strong strain of chickens was a gift
from god.
these birds can and will live in the wild very readly. ive seen this
myself.
meat and eggs are good sources of food even today.
whats over looked in our world today is the importants of keeping
these birds.
the traits the game bird has are needed and if we as a world lose
them.
it would be travesty beyound compare ...what would be lost?
the natural desire to live and reproduce .
the game hen is the broodyest chickens alive today. most of our food
chickens today
wont even set on there nest. these strains are worthless in the real
world.
without man to protect them, there food for everything and wouldnt
make it 1 year before they
were gone.and this includeds most every breed we have today .
stop and think this over with a clear mind.why would we comit genicide
on the real chickens of our
world. these birds are the natural chicken nobody has ever seen live
naturally.
nobody .im saying. not even cockers understand to its fullest the ways
of the game flock.
but people who fight game birds understand them better then any other
group of people on earth.
they are keepers of these almost lost treasures of the world.
i say a flock because only in a flock can a person witness there true
nature.
when in a flock here is what i learned
a rooster will run off every young male these young males will hang
around at the edge of the flock
with the young female or stags stags being males and pullets being
young females.
the hens do the same thing to the pullets.
now the older original flock will be kept as is in the pecking order.
and will only change when one of these flock members are defeated by
the younger
offspring. and death is almost always a result of the challange.
the main flock will be the hub of all the offspring .and as a flock
grows the number of
smaller flocks will increase on the out side of the main flocks
territory .
layer by layer the flock will increase. year after year i susppect it
will take
many years to see how far it will go.
when a sibling wants to challange an older flock member it simply dose
so.
the winner if its the older member may at that time be challanged by
a
lower level memeber of the flock as fighting takes its toll on all
involved.
and at times the older member may be sent to the bottom of the pecking
order
even if they beat the younger challanger.
if the youngster wins they will have to meet any and all challangers
from the flock members.
sometimes the hens will all jump on one hen killing her im thinking
this is done to thin out a flock
if its over crowded in there territory . keeping the balance needed to
keep the flock alive.
young roosters will fight each other to gain strength and learn how to
fight.
this thins them down to a small number very fast. ive seen young
roosters at 8 weeks old
beat each others eyes closed trying to be the dominate rooster .mostly
at this age one will run off
and try again later.
this will change soon in a game rooster as he will not give up his
quest to be the breeder of the flock.
at ages ranging from 10 months old to two years old they mature and
will do 1 of 2 things
fight to take over a flock or take the younger pullets thats lived and
make a flock of his own
ive seen five young roosters jump an older rooster. and ive seen that
older rooster run them all off.
at two years old the spurs are not even close to the same size as a 4
year old roooster.
ive seen three inch long spurs on 4 year olds but mostly there 2
inches and are pointed to a needles
point and will grow the whole life of a rooster.ive seen a game
rooster jump a jack russle and whip the dog out of it with its spurs..
a cat will mostly run off from a rooster.
hawks will  find less threating food then a rooster or a full grown
hen.
but will eat anything it can swoop down and fly off with .
the roosters will feed his hens finding food and protecting the hens
is his job and he will do so even against man. i have had roosters
challage me when i
catch one of his hens. and beleive me you dont want him to sink a 2
inch spur
into you, it will be a lesson you will always remeber if ya do.
the main thing to remeber about the game bird  is its a wild fowl its
not the domesticated
food source that mankind has breed to supply food for themselves.
every utility bird or food bird was made to feed us. the best egg
layers will very  very seldom hatch
there eggs. man hatches there offspring to keep them in numbers for
food.
even farmers of a hundred years ago dont even understand the game
bird.
there memories are of the food birds like rhode island reds . not of
game birds
the fact that most people only know of the traits of food birds leaves
the gamebirds
lost in a world of misunderstanding .
talk to people and they say things, like ive read here, i didnt have
roosters that fight each other
like game chickens do. its because they have never seen a real chicken
of nature.
they only know of the birds breed to be food.
in the wild a coward rooster like a food bird would never live,
ever.....
he would not pass on his weak nature. the rules of nature see to this.
a hen that wont hatch its eggs will never pass that trait on in the
gene pool.
even the way the birds pass on there genes is designed to make a
strong flock.
rooster passing some things to his daugthers and the hens passing some
things to her son.
yet mixing many genes at the same time.this
creats a crossing of dna that promotes a health breeding pattern .
they will inbreed and out cross themselves as the rooster in the flock
changes
as well as when the hens are demoted in the pecking order.
why anyone would choose to change what these birds stand for is beyond
my understanding.
chicken !!!!!!!the word stands for coward in most of the world.
but the game bird is the icon of bravery and nobility in the natural
world.
the roosters will to often decide to die as to give up his desire to
be the flock leader.
dose that sound like a chicken? of course not   most of the world has
been tought
to beleive that the real nature of a chicken is to run be a coward.
when people want the truth about the game birds real nature they will
see that most of what
ive stated is true.. im not a real educated person as my dislexic mind
will prove in my grammer.
but my time with these birds has no other agenda then the keeping of
this treasure we have all but
erased from the earth.
under the endangered spiecies laws these birds should be listed as
well.
as there numbers are dropping fast from the pressure of the LIKES OF
THE  HSUS AND PETA.
ive seen reports and news articals stating the killing of hundreds of
these birds as if they were a
blimish to mankind. how anyone that loves animals can see this as ok
is sickening
anyone that gives money to these groups have been  responsible for the
killing of these birds
as well as the senceless killing of many pets . the donaters are also
responsible for
the starvation of many humain beings in our world as well. by
increasing animals production cost
so much that poor people cant afford meat.
for decades now the donaters to these groups cause harm to poor
children in all countrys.
with hr137 these birds will see there demise in our world.
how a race like humans could think they have the right to stop the
preservation of these birds
is again sickening to my heart. im ashamed to be a part of a race that
kills babies yet
saves pets.
eats chickens but denies a chickens rights to its own way of life.
to force a chicken to be a food source alone. and to erase there real
natural ways of life from
the face of the earth and not let them be what they are will soon
become these groups demise.
they have all but killed off these birds for the sake of humain
practices .
but its the game bird that shows the real monster hidding in there
agenda.
the equalization of man and beast.
sounds great at first thought dont it. but lets think this over.
if they meet there goal you wont have pets will you .
do you think its ok to keep people as pets. if not thats 1 strick
against there agenda.
if your baby is hungry and a chicken is the only food do you want the
right to eat your chicken.
well you wouldnt eat a person now would you ??thats strick 2.
strike 3 is a biggy would you keep people in cages to feed your family
as most of the world
dose to animals now, with out this food source many will die of
hunger .
many want us to beleive that the earth could support every person
without animals foods.
is this really poosible in your minds why do we have dying children
today with it then.
do you not see that people will be the slaves to grow food for the
rich with no animals food sources.
do you thing wayne pecell or ingid whats her last name would grow and
toil the land with there oun hands
to feed themselves. dose anyone belonging to either of these groups
really understand how much
work it really takes to grow there oun food. a veggin wants you to
beleive live eating only veggies
is possible well it is if you have 2 dollar an hour mexicans living in
vans working 16 hour days
traveling from town to town picking and growing it for them.veggins
promote poverty with there agenda.
they all would die if they didnt have vitemin supplements to give them
what animals provide.
so wheres the supplement tree at .can a person let themselves think
there right in being a veggen
when it take modorn mans ways to supply the needed industry to live.is
this not an unatural way of life.
do the rich haave the right to dictate to the poor there choices of
foods as they do now.
do people of the citys and suberbs that wont let animals in there life
have the right to tell farmers how to raise
there animals that feeds the city dwellers ?i think not.  animals
rights activist often are the main cause of
of mistreatment of farm animals. if they didnt demand cheap food every
farmer would raise the best well taken care of food in the world as
this food would demand the highest prices and be the less work.
only a farmer that works a farm and raises animals can even closely
understand this truth in this matter.
how city dwellers can let themselves think they understand more then a
farmer is a rediculess frame of mind.
every animal rights activest or ARA GROUP is run by rich people that
pay themselves rediculess wages
that dwarfs most peoples wages. they are a money gathering group..
nothing more.
the hsus has never supported locals dog shelters they charge them for
every service they give.
your donations pay lobbyest and wages and increase silly laws that
protect animals more then people.
your donations to these people help them take your pets away. like it
or not thats there agenda.
you may think its not but if you look behind there hype you will find
this out yourselves.
the lies they spread make farmers seam uncarring about there animals.
they take a few farmers as exsamples and make the city dwellers
beleive that all farmers
are like the few bad apples. this is lie that can be proven to anyone
farmer or not.
farmers are like most people they protect there living.
its to there best intrest to raise healthy well feed happy animals.
why people think they would choose to
do less is silly .ive never meet any person that would do this to
there lively hood farmer or not.
how anyone lets themselves think they would is an insult to the very
people that feeds the world.
all farmers should stop growing food for 1 year.. let these silly ARA
groups see what its like in a world
without farmers. why should a farmer let the people they feed make
rules with animals and farms
that they have choosen to elliminate from there space in the citys.
its a double standard beyound
anything in our world today. the people that support these agendas and
ara groups are being lied to
mislead and are responsible for the laws being made today that will
seperate the poor and the rich even
more then anyone can understand today.reallity will prove these groups
are cutting there oun livelyhood
trying to help animals. and it serves them right i guess there the
ones that dont have the dirt nessasry to feed themselves not the
farmers people in the country learn life for real raise there food
kill there pigs chickens and cows that they raised and cared for.
the cut there own meat get up in the early am to feed water and care
for there beast and crops.
the city people go to the store and buy unhealthy foods in a box. meat
that has sit on a shelf waiting to be bought
buy them. people in the city cant afford to pay for organic foods. i
get 8 bucks a chicken for organic chickens
a dollar or two if i cant prove there organic what city dweller wants
to pay 10 dollars for a chicken to eat.
or 4 dollars for a dozen of eggs. well if you city dwellres dont wake
up ,this what you can look forward to.
and if you think the money your giving will help animals be raised in
a humain way you lack the understand of whats taking place in your
world. as the deveopled countrys make laws that raise the cost of food
in the states and rich countrys the food production is moved into poor
countrys with no regulations and even worse
condtions then they are raised here in the states . its already
happening and has been happning for well over 20 years.
the game bird is the first of the animals that will be taken off the
earth by these ara groups.
there agenda is to end all animal use period .no pets, no food
animals ,no horse riding ,no hunting, no fish stores
no zoos ,. thats there real agenda, read, listen and see for
yourselves donaters.
you are the sheep that they intend to shear and you give them money to
do it to you all in the name of a
more humain world ,,...this world  they seak makes man and beast of
equal value.
meaning you dont have the right to eat or keep any beast as you do
now.
when the gamerooster is gone and the world must listen to storys of
there courage and nobility then
the donaters will see how they themselves cause a spieces to be killed
off from the face of the earth.
and people ,donators ARA groups you commite genicide on them you are
responsible for the deliberate
exsicktion of the game bird. even if we start now it may already be to
late to save them.
who on any of these list and sites that determine there fait has ever
seen these birds in the wilds of nature.
let them present the case and all others that assume should stand
aside and learn the truth. rather then
push an agenda that spreads lies and misleads the truth .
is there one member of the hsus or peta or any ara group that has
raised these birds to be a decider
in there fait do they know the facts of the life of a game bird. all
they know is what the hear.
they dont seak the truth just your money to pay there outragous
salarys.
donators of these groups . do you really want to be apart of there
agenda that creates such starvation
and control of every life on earth one that only gives the rich health
foods
well you are and shame on you for being sheep that follows without
question to your own slaughter.
hope your proud of yourselves you should be ashamed and hide the fact
that you ever gave them 1 penny

many will suggest spell check .many will call me iliterate and
uneducated dislexia old me
cant use spell check some things i cant do like spell right . so feel
free to exsploit this
im used to it from the ara people and dont mind anymore.
i seam to be among the parts of the world that is being killed off for
the sake of these groups agendas.
when people like me are gone  then what people thats ok with smelling
chicken shit or steping in  cow shit
as i work and do my job or breaking nails and get blisters from the
hard work farming is.
what then people who will feed your citys then will you let chickens
live with you then.
will you tolerate the shit smell in your yard when the likes of me are
gone.
will you want us back when you find that it takes hard working people
that is happy with little free time and money in life  and is content
with the job of feeding you will you then leave us alone and let us
care for the beast
who wants this job not a city dweller if you did you would live in the
country. and be doing it now.
who of you will stand annd care for the beast as the farmers do.
