URGENT HELP! - can't disable alarm

Hope someone can help, or have an idea!

i've got a 1997 146 1.6TS , alfa factory alarm
1 x red key with remote
1 x brown master key - no remote

Problem is when i press the button on the remote key, the little red
light on the key blinks, but doesn't disable the alarm!

I had this problem 2 weeks ago and changed the batteries in the remote
key, this worked ok so i thought nothing more of it, but it's done it
again today, so i can't get into the car without setting off the alarm!

i know i can get into the car ok with the physical key and should be
able to start it as well, but obviously the alarm will sound! and
probably not stop either!

any ideas on a way around this? , i've spoken to a dealer who suggested
waiting until the car cools down a little, or trying to shade the
windscreen area and try it again as the sunlight might be affecting it
in some way, i'll try that later on.

other than that, is there another way of disableing the alarm system or
just the sounder? , i know the alarm is located in the rear wing, can
you get to the box at all under the car? , or can you pull a fuse on
the sounder unit?

any help very much appreciated! , as i'm a little stuck at work at the
moment!

thanks

In the boot, offside, there should be a lift up flap on trim, revealing
the alarm box. You should have a small 'round' key which fits the socket
under the flap. This will disable the alarm.
Had a problem with my 146; 10 mins after parking, alarm goes off. Turns
out to be bonnet pin switch - when hot, expands enough make contact, but
as it cooled and contracted, no longer made contact and alarm goes off!

thanks for that steve, dont have the key tho, and alfa wont give it to
me! , or say it's not available

managed to open the car at around 5pm when the car was in the shade,
spoke to a local dealer who suggested the sun might be a problem, looks
like he was right, doors and alarm worked fine all last night and this
morning

have left the window open a touch with the interior sensors off today,
but want to find out if i can disable the alarm somehow and just use
the remote key to open and lock the doors, can't get stuck like that
again!

I would use the key to lock the door until you sort the problem.
