Should the cistern be fixed to the wall in all cases ?? A local plumber
fitted the suite abt 18 months ago and now I find a leak has developed
between the pan and cistern due to the movement of the pan/cistern
when used..I have tightened the screws that bolt the pan/cistern
together but after a while they leak again..I did notice that the fixing
holes in the back of the cistern had not been used...

Thanks Ted

Yes the cistern should be fastened to the wall.

It will probably need a new doughnut washer between the
pan and cistern once it's started leaking. They aren't
reusable as they deform to the shape of the parts.
