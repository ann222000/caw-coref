If you have a Mandrin badge I will be jealous. Warman's and
Wallace-Homestead publish oriental price guides. Also, Sandra Anracht (I
think that's how you spell her name has some information about Chinese
textiles.

Some time ago I ordered a British article on badges. I believe Gardner
was the author, but I will check and get back to you. The crane is the
highest ranking scholar. Military badges depict wild cats and other
feroious animals, while the badges of scholars are birds. I love these,
and I am glad you care enough to search the topic.

As a final note, not all birds are badges. Badges are usuall split down
thecenter.
