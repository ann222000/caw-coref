If a New Jersey company were to sue a Connecticut-based company for
breaching an oral contract, which state's Statute of Limitations would
apply?

Thanks ....

When you answer the above interjected questions and also preferably
(though not necessarily) the two below, someone will be able to
suggest and informed answer.

Are you asking because more than three years has elapsed and, if not,
what difference would the answer make?

Do the parties disagree about which state's limitation period shall
apply and, if they do, what reasons does each proffer in support of
the position each advances?

Not sure. It hasn't happened yet.  But, all work was done in CT for this
NJ-based company.

We didn't have any kind of agreement, formally.  The NJ company and CT
company held phone calls to discuss work to be completed, in CT.  Then, the
CT business issued invoices to the NJ company net-30 days.  The CT business
only visited the NJ company's office one time, for a few hours.  Otherwise
all time spent working in CT.  If the NJ company were to persue this, the CT
co doesn't believe any kind of breach occured.  Just hearing rumors about
this 4.5 years later....  The CT co believes that all work was performed to
professional standards and delivered on time ...

It's been 4.5 years.  I read that the CT Statute of limitations for verbal
contracts is 3 years and 6 years in NJ.

This whole thing is just at the rumor stage, so no info on this.
