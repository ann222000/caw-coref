I'm installing a 250 gallon oil tank for the shop furnace.  For
reasons I'm not gonna get into here  I'm mounting it on two right
angle frames secured to the foundation wall.

The frames are 3&quot; x 3/16&quot; angle- approximately 16&quot; on the verticals,
with the horizontals extending about 37&quot; out from the wall.    Theres
diagonals running from the bottom of the uprights to the outboard ends
of the horizontals.The tank's weight will be centered about 24&quot; out
from the wall.

On one of the frames I can run a bolt through the wall but for the

I just ain't good enough to figure the tension/shear ratios on the rod
( :( ) but I figure 1000 lbs worst case tension on the rod as the tank
fully loaded will weigh
about 2000 lbs.

Q.- will an 50-50 epoxy/sand mix gooped into the hole &amp; onto the
threaded rod hold it in?  FWIW the epoxy is West Systems 300 series,
really designed for fiberglassing but its what I got handy.  The sand
is 40 mesh silica from my sandblasting stock.

I'm figuring it will hold O.K. but I'd like some sort of learn-ed
reassurance, 250 gallons of oil spilled in the back yard is trouble I
*Don't* need. :/

I would really dig deep into the Boston Underground epoxy failure history
before committing yourself to your mix... which sounds risky to me... I
think microbaloons or fiber might be better than sand to mix with the glue.

Rather than experimenting with epoxy, is there any reason not to resort to a
proven fastener like Hilti Quickbolt

its competition?  I have been using them for decades without a hint of a

Actually, it's 3,000 pounds on the bolts, or 1,500 pounds per bolt,
minimum, since the horizontal arm is longer than the vertical.  And
that's only if the top bolt is at the very top of the arm, which it
won't be.  So it will be more.

Read up on the accident in Boston's &quot;Big Dig&quot; tunnel for an example of
what creep or flow in an epoxy - and using the wrong epoxy in the
first place - can do.

Sorry I can't give you the reassurance you seek.  Maybe someone else
can.

I would go to a real construction supply house and ask for proper
cement fasteners (rated for your pull rating) and rent a tool to
properly get them seated. I figure that for $100, you will be all set,
based on nothing but a gut feeling.

Maybe this might be a good time to get into the reasons you don't want to
mount it on something that has straight down compression strength.

It's a flammable liquid.  You better be right, and I like things three times
stronger than they need to be.  Particularly when dealing with flammable
fluids.

Let us know where you live so we can keep an eye on the newspapers.

I'd say your plan looks like nothing but potential trouble.

First, you better check the building codes in your area. What you are
trying to do may violate those codes and require you to completely
rework your entire situation......after you have drilled holes in your
foundation and had the certain to appear cracks show up. The building
inspector may require you to rip the entire thing out just to satisfy
the code and issue you a citation which could lead to all sorts of
legal nonsense.......particularly if you ever put your place up for
sale.

Probably the code says to pour a concrete pad of some given thickness
and set the tank on it. If that's what the code says, that is what I'd
do.

Second, do you really want to screw with the foundation of the
building? I can see stress fractures developing and spidering out from
the bolt holes, along with a nice concrete plug pulled out from the
foundation, as the torque on the system varies with the oil load in
the tank: particularly if you anchor the bolts to the concrete with
some type of epoxy. This will not allow the bolts any &quot;wiggle room&quot; as
the oil load changes and will likely crack out a big plug of your
concrete foundation.

A possible solution to this is to use two 3/8's inch steel
sheets....one on the inside of the foundation and one on the outside
of the foundation. Use one inch bolts with only threading where the
nuts will be applied....no threads in contact with the shear forces
created by the downward pull of the plate and load. Silicon caulk
around the bolts to prevent water seepage through the bolt holes.

The plates with spread the load over a wide area on the inside and
outside of the foundation....if you use enough bolts and tighten them
properly.

Then weld the required brackets to handle the oil tank on the outside
foundation plate.

Rethink your plan. Check the code. Pouring a pad is the best way to go
IMO.

Your wall is designed for a vertical load, not a cantilevered load. You
don't mention of what material your wall is constructed. If it is solid,
poured, steel reinforced concrete, you may be ok (maybe). If it is block
construction, you are asking for trouble. You could modify your design to
use two vertical legs on the outside, supported on concrete pads, and
place only vertical loading on the wall. The safest thing is to self-
support the tank on it's own legs. Note that your local building codes
may require a sealed spill containment dike around/under the tank. (You
can get polypro spill containment units from companies like US Plastics,
Global Industrial Equipment and the like.

Is this a custom made tank? Most steel tanks for home heating oil are 275
gallon capacity..

At any rate heating oil is classifed as haz-mat, and the tanks must be
either on the ground/slab or buried as per building code, unless it's a 5
gallon day tank/transfer pump setup to feed hanging furnaces.

Sounds to me like you need to get into the reasons - if we know what
the design restrictions are, we may be able to come up with better
alternatives that you hadn't considered.  Why don't you just want to
KISS and pour a simple concrete slab with a secondary containment dike
wall around it (or a poly containment tank on top) and put the tank on
the ground?

Or build a concrete 'crypt' and slab underground and bury a
double-wall fiberglass tank bedded in pea gravel?

If you are trying to cantilever this out over the property line it
won't work, you don't have rights to intrude on someone else's lot
line just because it doesn't touch the ground.  Same thing with
lot-line setbacks in the side or back yard that need to stay clear.

The design you propose IMHO looks like it would work IF your
foundation wall is poured well-reinforced concrete and way overbuilt
now, and IF you put three or four L-brackets across the width of the
tank to spread the loads to multiple bolts, and IF you used two bolts
at the top of each bracket that went all the way through the wall at
each bolt location, AND put big spreader plates on the inside of the
foundation wall.

I would also consider a set of vertical supports from the outer end
of the L-brackets going down to a concrete footing.  Or taking some
tension rods UP and anchored to the wall at a high angle overhead or
to the roof joists.

Or continuing the tension bolts (or other tension members off the
reinforcing plates) inside the basement and catching the floor joists
to transfer some of that tension load to the floor.

You are putting one hell of a tension load on the bolts at the top
and a lot of overhanging load on the wall.  Concrete is not very
strong in tension, and if the rebar wasn't placed with this load in
mind it probably isn't enough or in the right places.  And you are
also putting some serious compression load from the bottom of the L
into the wall.  If it was only vertical load it would handle it.

And NO WAY would I try using epoxy anchored bolts for this.  Way too
much tension.

I have seen brackets like this used to hang electrical transformers
off the wall, but ONLY with through bolts and gussets on the other
side of the wall, and ONLY when accompanied by tension rod supports
from the outer end of the support arms to the ceiling or wall brackets
well above.  You need to spread the load out a whole lot more than you
are doing here.

Note that I Am Not An Engineer, just a lowly electrician - but my
learned experience says this would take a WHOLE LOT of work to make
sufficiently safe and sturdy.

And the stuff in the tank qualifies as HazMat - you sure don't want
the EPA Guys (Or the Canadian equivalent) in bunny-suits showing up at
your front door, saying you get to pay the bill to dig up half your
yard to a depth of 10 or 20 feet and ship the contaminated dirt to an

O.K. folks, thanks for the reality check- in response to your
gratefully accepted advice:

Wayne, good point on Boston, I had forgotten about that.  I will look
into it.

Vaughn, I've used Hiltis  &amp;  other wedge type solutions in thier
various configurations, usually they work, sometimes they don't.  Due
to the holes proximity to the edge of the foundation I have concerns
about their expansion causing cracking.

John &amp; Nick, you are of course correct, the tension on the bolts will
be greater due to the longer horizontal vs. the verticle. I can only
plead pre-senility brain farts. :(   In point of fact the weight will
be centered 20&quot; out on the horizontal vs. 14&quot; from the top mounting
hole to the bottom of the arm.  For all intents the top mount is in a
line with the horizontal arm.  I'm not sure I buy the 3000 lbs per arm
though, my calculations say 250 gallons of oil weigh aproximately 2000
lbs. , or 1000 lbs per arm.  (1000x20)/14= 1428 lbs force.  Ne C'est
Pas?

Et Tu, Iggy?  Actually I will get the proper hardware if it turns out
the wall will handle it, Hilti has a line of epoxy fasteners that at
3/4&quot; are rated for something like 14,000 lbs tension, other
manufacturers list 3/4&quot; at 27,000 lbs.

Steve, I could tell you why, but then I'd Have To Kill You :(.  Sorry
to dissappoint but it's waste oil, not fuel oil,  put your
marshmallows back in the bag-

Anthony, the wall is poured concrete, 8&quot; thick.  The top mounting
holes are aprox. 16&quot; above grade, &amp; one is on a corner so for that one
the wall is effectivly 20' thick.  This is the &quot;blind&quot; hole I
mentioned &amp; why I need something that won't pull out. For the hole
that does go through I will certainly have a backing plate of some
sort on the inside.

Tony, here in Canada we have Man Sized Gallons. :).
Oddly e'nuff I can't find anything in the building codes about
mounting oil tanks, &amp; this is on a garage anyhow which they don't tend
to get so picky about.

Bruce, I'm not mounting it on the ground for reasons of simplicity,
theres only one spot where the tank can go &amp; meet code requirements
for distance from exits &amp; the ground in that spot is, to put it
mildly, sloped.  Even if I excavate there a lot of run-off goes
through right there, I'gd really be concerned about the slab shifting,
thats half the reason I want it mounted to the foundation. Don't have
the $$$ for a vault, don't think they're legal here anymore anyhow.

Looks like I'll have to dig up an engineer to go over this before I do
it.  If it won't work the way I want I'll probably go with a couple of
(deep) concrete posts &amp; supports ( $$$ :( ) for the outboad ends.

Never said 3,000 pounds per arm.  Nick said &quot;Expect the rod tension to
be MORE than the weight of the tank&quot;, I said &quot;3,000 pounds on the
bolts, or 1,500 pounds per bolt, minimum&quot;.  You'll note we are talking
about tension on the bolts, not shear.  The shear on the bolts would
be the weight only - 2,000 pounds over 4 bolts is 500 pounds per bolt.

My apologies  John, that it indeed what you wrote.

Hi Guys:

I'm going through the current topics to hopefully suggest a way to tag
valid RCM traffic.

Add RCM: on the beginning of the title line - BEFORE the obligatory OT?

Hang tiugh - keep posting.

Your guess at about 1000 # may be right for shear, but I think the
tension number will be higher on a 24&quot; lever.  Your choice of 3/4
all thread  overkills your numbers anyway.   Those fellas in
Boston thought they could outguess their own epoxy formula too.
It is too bad that they drug Powers into the deal as their
literature defines applications, and the contractor did not follow
the requirements or use the correct product.

Epoxy executed properly is rated to be stronger than other forms
of concrete anchors.  there are epoxy systems made by many major
manufacturers made to work with conventional all-thread.

Powers
Simpson
Red Head
They all require a particular bolt size in a particular hole size
with sufficient cleaning of the hole. I use quite a bit of the Red
Head  C6 product.  Here is their tension and shear table for their
C6 product, showing 28, 779 # in tension on a 3/4 threaded rod @ 6
3/4 embedment in 2000 # concrete:

For those who were suggesting mechanical anchors:
Their wedge anchor :  3/4, embed 6, 2000 conc, = 10, 980

&gt; I'm installing a 250 gallon oil tank for the shop furnace.  For
&gt; reasons I'm not gonna get into here  I'm mounting it on two
&gt; right
&gt; angle frames secured to the foundation wall.

&gt; The frames are 3&quot; x 3/16&quot; angle- approximately 16&quot; on the
&gt; verticals,
&gt; with the horizontals extending about 37&quot; out from the wall.
&gt; Theres
&gt; diagonals running from the bottom of the uprights to the
&gt; outboard ends
&gt; of the horizontals.The tank's weight will be centered about 24&quot;
&gt; out
&gt; from the wall.

&gt; [    ]

&gt; On one of the frames I can run a bolt through the wall but for
&gt; the
&gt; other I had to drill a 3/4&quot; blind hole 8&quot; deep into the
&gt; foundation.

&gt; I just ain't good enough to figure the tension/shear ratios on
&gt; the rod
&gt; ( :( ) but I figure 1000 lbs worst case tension on the rod as
&gt; the tank
&gt; fully loaded will weigh
&gt; about 2000 lbs.

&gt; Q.- will an 50-50 epoxy/sand mix gooped into the hole &amp; onto the
&gt; threaded rod hold it in?  FWIW the epoxy is West Systems 300
&gt; series,
&gt; really designed for fiberglassing but its what I got handy.  The
&gt; sand
&gt; is 40 mesh silica from my sandblasting stock.

&gt; I'm figuring it will hold O.K. but I'd like some sort of
&gt; learn-ed
&gt; reassurance, 250 gallons of oil spilled in the back yard is
&gt; trouble I
&gt; *Don't* need. :/

&gt; Thanks,
