The Connection - Part V

<TEXT>
<P>Just have to print this article today by Andrew C. McCarthy about the
connections between Saddam and Al-Qaeda: President George W. Bush
forcefully explained last night — some of us would say finally
forcefully explained last night after too long a lull — why our military
operations in Iraq are crucial to success in the war on terror. It was
good to hear the commander-in-chief remind people that this is still the
war against terror. Specifically, against Islamo-fascists who
slaughtered 3000 Americans on September 11, 2001. Who spent the eight
years before those atrocities murdering and promising to murder
Americans — as their leader put it in 1998, all Americans, including
civilians, anywhere in the world where they could be found. It is not
the war for democratization. It is not the war for stability.
Democratization and stability are not unimportant. They are among a host
of developments that could help defeat the enemy. But they are not the
primary goal of this war, which is to destroy the network of Islamic
militants who declared war against the United States when they bombed
the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993, and finally jarred us into
an appropriate response when they demolished that complex, struck the
Pentagon, and killed 3000 of us on September 11, 2001. That is why we
are in Iraq. On September 12, 2001, no one in America cared about
whether there would be enough Sunni participation in a fledgling Iraqi
democracy if Saddam were ever toppled. No one in lower Manhattan cared
whether the electricity would work in Baghdad, or whether Muqtada
al-Sadr’s Shiite militia could be coaxed into a political process. They
cared about smashing terrorists and the states that supported them for
the purpose of promoting American national security. Saddam Hussein’s
regime was a crucial part of that response because it was a safety net
for al Qaeda. A place where terror attacks against the United States and
the West were planned. A place where Saddam’s intelligence service aided
and abetted al Qaeda terrorists planning operations. A place where
terrorists could hide safely between attacks. A place where terrorists
could lick their wounds. A place where committed terrorists could
receive vital training in weapons construction and paramilitary tactics.
In short, a platform of precisely the type without which an
international terror network cannot succeed. The president should know
he hit the sweet spot during his Fort Bragg speech because all the right
people are angry. The New York Times, with predictable disingenuousness,
is railing this morning that the 9/11 references in the speech are out
of bounds because Iraq had “nothing whatsoever to do with the terrorist
attacks.” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and the tedious David
Gergen, among others, are in Gergen’s words “offended” about use of the
9/11 “trump card.” If the president is guilty of anything, it's not that
he's dwelling on 9/11 enough. It's that the administration has not done
a good enough job of probing and underscoring the nexus between the
Saddam regime and al Qaeda. It is absolutely appropriate, it is vital,
for him to stress that connection. This is still the war on terror, and
Iraq, where the terrorists are still arrayed against us, remains a big
part of that equation. And not just because every jihadist with an AK-47
and a prayer rug has made his way there since we invaded. No, it’s
because Saddam made Iraq their cozy place to land long before that. They
are fighting effectively there because they’ve been invited to dig in
for years. The president needs to be talking about Saddam and terror
because that’s what will get their attention in Damascus and Teheran.
It’s not about the great experiment in democratization — as helpful as
it would be to establish a healthy political culture in that part of the
world. It’s about making our enemies know we are coming for them if they
abet and harbor and promote and plan with the people who are trying to
kill us. On that score, nobody should worry about anything the Times or
David Gergen or Senator Reid has to say about all this until they have
some straight answers on questions like these. What does the “nothing
whatsoever” crowd have to say about: Ahmed Hikmat Shakir — the Iraqi
Intelligence operative who facilitated a 9/11 hijacker into Malaysia and
was in attendance at the Kuala Lampur meeting with two of the hijackers,
and other conspirators, at what is roundly acknowledged to be the
initial 9/11 planning session in January 2000? Who was arrested after
the 9/11 attacks in possession of contact information for several known
terrorists? Who managed to make his way out of Jordanian custody over
our objections after the 9/11 attacks because of special pleading by
Saddam’s regime? Saddam's intelligence agency's efforts to recruit
jihadists to bomb Radio Free Europe in Prague in the late 1990's?
Mohammed Atta's unexplained visits to Prague in 2000, and his alleged
visit there in April 2001 which — notwithstanding the 9/11 Commission's
dismissal of it (based on interviewing exactly zero relevant witnesses)
— the Czechs have not retracted? The Clinton Justice Department's
allegation in a 1998 indictment (two months before the embassy bombings)
against bin Laden, to wit: In addition, al Qaeda reached an
understanding with the government of Iraq that al Qaeda would not work
against that government and that on particular projects, specifically
including weapons development, al Qaeda would work cooperatively with
the Government of Iraq. Seized Iraq Intelligence Service records
indicating that Saddam's henchmen regarded bin Laden as an asset as
early as 1992? Saddam's hosting of al Qaeda No. 2, Ayman Zawahiri
beginning in the early 1990’s, and reports of a large payment of money
to Zawahiri in 1998? Saddam’s ten years of harboring of 1993 World Trade
Center bomber Abdul Rahman Yasin? Iraqi Intelligence Service operatives
being dispatched to meet with bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1998 (the year
of bin Laden’s fatwa demanding the killing of all Americans, as well as
the embassy bombings)? Saddam’s official press lionizing bin Laden as
“an Arab and Islamic hero” following the 1998 embassy bombing attacks?
The continued insistence of high-ranking Clinton administration
officials to the 9/11 Commission that the 1998 retaliatory strikes
(after the embassy bombings) against a Sudanese pharmaceutical factory
were justified because the factory was a chemical weapons hub tied to
Iraq and bin Laden? Top Clinton administration counterterrorism official
Richard Clarke’s assertions, based on intelligence reports in 1999, that
Saddam had offered bin Laden asylum after the embassy bombings, and
Clarke’s memo to then-National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, advising
him not to fly U-2 missions against bin Laden in Afghanistan because he
might be tipped off by Pakistani Intelligence, and “[a]rmed with that
knowledge, old wily Usama will likely boogie to Baghdad”? (See 9/11
Commission Final Report, p. 134 & n.135.) Terror master Abu Musab
Zarqawi's choice to boogie to Baghdad of all places when he needed
surgery after fighting American forces in Afghanistan in 2001? Saddam's
Intelligence Service running a training camp at Salman Pak, were
terrorists were instructed in tactics for assassination, kidnapping and
hijacking ? Former CIA Director George Tenet’s October 7, 2002 letter to
Congress, which asserted: Our understanding of the relationship between
Iraq and Al Qaeda is evolving and is based on sources of varying
reliability. Some of the information we have received comes from
detainees, including some of high rank. We have solid reporting of
senior level contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda going back a decade.
Credible information indicates that Iraq and Al Qaeda have discussed
safe haven and reciprocal nonaggression. Since Operation Enduring
Freedom, we have solid evidence of the presence in Iraq of Al Qaeda
members, including some that have been in Baghdad. We have credible
reporting that Al Qaeda leaders sought contacts in Iraq who could help
them acquire WMD capabilities. The reporting also stated that Iraq has
provided training to Al Qaeda members in the areas of poisons and gases
and making conventional bombs. Iraq's increasing support to extremist
Palestinians coupled with growing indications of relationship with Al
Qaeda suggest that Baghdad's links to terrorists will increase, even
absent U.S. military action. There's more. Stephen Hayes’s book, The
Connection, remains required reading. But these are just the questions;
the answers — if someone will just investigate the questions rather than
pretending there’s “nothing whatsoever” there — will provide more still.
So Gergen, Reid, the Times, and the rest are “offended” at the
president's reminding us of 9/11? The rest of us should be offended,
too. Offended at the “nothing whatsoever” crowd’s inexplicable lack of
curiosity about these ties, and about the answers to these questions.
Just tell us one thing: Do you have any good answer to what Ahmed Hikmat
Shakir was doing with the 9/11 hijackers in Kuala Lampur? Can you
explain it? If not, why aren't you moving heaven and earth to find out
the answer? Previous: The Connection - Part IV The Connection - Part III
