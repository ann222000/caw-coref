Money cures whatever ails the band
Friday, October 05, 2007
Michael Heaton - Cleveland Plain Dealer

Did you read John Soeder's cover piece today on Van Halen and the
band's storied and fractious history? Rather than ask why the band
can't get along, it probably makes more sense to ask how any band ever
gets along. Rock 'n' roll is a hard road. Literally and figuratively.

As Robbie Robertson said in the documentary &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; about The
Band, &quot;It's a goddamn impossible way of life.&quot;

Van Halen was the perfect storm for a band implosion. You have an
egomaniac jerk of a lead singer in David Lee Roth. You have a
brilliant and hard-drinking lead guitarist and founder of the band in
Eddie Van Halen. Add to that mix 75 million album sales translating
into millions of dollars and watch the whole thing go BOOM.

The issues that break up bands are the same ones that break up all
partnerships, whether they be businesses or sports teams or marriages.
The terra firma of all human interaction is fraught with these land
mines. It's just that rock band conflicts are more visible than
others.

Bands fight over money, power, workload, attention and women. Then
there's the stupid stuff such as not liking the way the drummer eats
his soup. Being on the road magnifies all the little irritations. If
you've ever been on a family vacation that involves long-distance
driving, you know what I mean.

Did I mention money?

Money changes everything. If one or more members of the band are
getting more ching than the others it can lead to a work slowdown.
This results in the disgruntled musician being late for rehearsal,
late for the gig, skipping the in-store promotion party, getting high
all the time or all of the above. In this scenario all of the band's
grunt work (payroll, promotion, booking, van maintenance) falls to the
leader of the band, resulting in even more resentment and discontent.

The power issue boils down to the question, &quot;Who's the leader of the
band?&quot; The answer to which almost always is, &quot;You're not the boss of
me.&quot; People not in bands don't realize the phrase Battle of the Bands
has a whole different meaning for professional musicians.

Of course, being the leader of the band is a blessing and a curse. The
leaders usually write and/or pick which songs get recorded. If they
happen to write songs, guess which ones they pick? That's right.
Whoever owns the publishing rights gets more money. Which leads to
disputes over . . .

Money. See above.

Then there's the occasional jealousy when the leader of the band is
not the media darling. It's usually the lead singer. Some people would
tell you that David Lee Roth is Van Halen, or that Peter Wolf was the
J. Geils Band. Fallout Boy has the opposite situation in which lead
singer Patrick Stump labors in the shadow of glamour-puss bass player
Pete Wentz. But so far the band remains intact.

Last, but certainly not least, meddling, two-timing, trouble-causing
women have been threatening band harmony since, well -- do the names
Pattie Boyd, Anita Pallenberg, Yoko Ono and Courtney Love sound
familiar? That's what love's got to do with it.

But of all the factors that contribute to breaking up bands, only one
-- money -- also reunites them. Van Halen, the Eagles, Genesis and all
the other groups that have re-formed to go back on the road aren't
doing it for sentimental reasons.

They're doing it for the money. And if the tour is successful enough,
they'll earn more of it. Which can make annoying bandmates tolerable.

At least for the duration of the tour.

I don't buy all that.  Ed has plenty of money and wouldn't play with
Roth 'just for money'.  I think he genuinely wants to give Roth and
the fans a good show of it and he wanted to play with his son.  The
money is a plus...

what's always been weird about the roth/vh rift is that, while it was
probably the bitterest one ever, it apparently *never* had anything to
do with either women or money.

Unless you count the oft-told rumor of Dave screwing Alex's wife.

circumstances.
