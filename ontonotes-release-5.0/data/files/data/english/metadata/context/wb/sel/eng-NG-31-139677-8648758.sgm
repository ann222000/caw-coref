Or; Why I'm now taking tickets for hitting my father.

I'd just come back out of the bathroom this morning to collect my new facial
scrub (which I had forgotten to take in with me).

Dad: Did you get kicked out? (talking to the dog in the hall because that
was what he could see from his angle).
Me: No, I forgot my new scrubber
Dad: LOL A new scrubber for a scrubber.
Me: Yes, but I'm not really an old one, many of the ladies in my Sims group
think of me as 'young', quite a few of them are your age or older.
Dad: (shocked) That's just wrong!
Me: Why? &lt;thinking it was me enjoying the fact that some people think of me
as young, and trying to come up with biting retorts&gt;
Dad: Women, especially women my age, playing The Sims.

So, what's more offensive? The fact that I don't get classed as a woman. The
fact that The Sims is somehow the perogative of 'not-Women' or something I
missed?

*grah*

Honestly, like most (or a lot of) parents, he probably still thinks of you
as a child, not a grown woman, and thus might consider the Sims a game for
children.

Glad you started an OT topic on this, MM. So, what are women his age
supposed to be playing with? At least they're not out in the bars picking up
26 year old guys with cool cars and big muscles.

hmmmmmmm...

Oh well, back on topic. It used to drive me nuts when the hubby left
toothpaste and all his shaving mess all over the sink for me to have to
clean up. ( I tried but I couldn't NOT clean it up!) He still won't wipe the
kitchen counter after he makes a sandwich or something. It's maddening! I
took to spraying Lysol Kitchen Cleaner on the counter and leaving it there.
Makes his sandwiches taste &quot;nasty&quot;! LOL! He'll learn sooner or later.

On the bathroom issue, 10 years ago we bought this place and it has 2
bathrooms. One is his and the master bath is MINE ALL MINE! It's friggin'
heaven! I could never go back to sharing a bathroom again. Same with the
bedroom closets, he has the one in the spare bedroom and I have the one in
the master bedroom. Now, as soon as I can get him to start sleeping in the
spare bedroom I'll consider it a job well done. ;-p

As for his whining about me moving his stuff off of the dining room table,
keys, wallet, glasses, old receipts, etc., I just tell him he sounds soooooo
much like his mother when he whines like that. It's cut down on a lot of it,
but once in a while he gets worked up and then I even call him by his
mother's name. It's hilarious and it really ticks him off! LOL!

Makes me want to go move some of his stuff around. ;-D

LOL How could anyone think women wouldn't enjoy playing
the Sims?  To me, it's like a dollhouse where the dolls
walk and talk!  Sounds pretty girly to me ;)

The guy who built my computer is about 40 or so.  I told him I wanted a
computer strong enough to play the Sims 2 and all it's expansions.  That's
all I wanted.  He knew immediately what I needed and said he and his wife
both play the game, too, but his wife dearly loves it.  I told him I liked
to build houses and had several yahoo groups to share them and that they
seemed pretty popular, especially my TV Land sims and houses.  He perked
right up and said, &quot;You're Madame Jeanie?&quot;  ROFL  Seems they've got a TV

You tell him that after putting up with our husbands, we like to play a game
where the house stays clean, men eat even burnt food and sometimes scrub
toilets and wash dishes, and the kids actually do what we tell them to do.

Ya know, that might be a great idea, Jeanie. I've often thought that if I
wore a Sims 2 t-shirt when I go out to the mall or whatever, that I'd likely
get some people to acknowledge their addiction also. Might be a good way to
locate other Sims 2 players in your area. If you'd want to even do that.

Truer words were never spoken! I've been married to this man for 25 years,
and if I had it to do over again... well, it would have to be very
different, that's for sure. Love has nothing to do with it anymore.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe I ought to design a tshirt....  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jeanie

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ya know, that might be a great idea, Jeanie. I've often thought that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if I wore a Sims 2 t-shirt when I go out to the mall or whatever,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that I'd likely get some people to acknowledge their addiction also.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Might be a good way to locate other Sims 2 players in your area. If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you'd want to even do that. This is the part where I think &quot;Naaahh!&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Me Marie

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I wouldn't mind finding people who share my addiction on a local
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;basis. Sometimes I want to talk about what's going on in my game and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if I don't come in here to do it, I see eyes glaze over and smiles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;become forced as people start edging for the door....  When I try to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;share my sim stories with my husband, he says I should &quot;use my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talent to write a /real/ novel.&quot; Pffft.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jeanie

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, they're all just full of stuff we &quot;should&quot; be doing. Mine never
&gt;&gt;&gt;does anything I want him to do so he's just flat out of luck on
&gt;&gt;&gt;getting me to do anything he suggests. Two way street or I don't play.

&gt; The guy who built my computer is about 40 or so.  I told him I wanted a
&gt; computer strong enough to play the Sims 2 and all it's expansions.  That's
&gt; all I wanted.  He knew immediately what I needed and said he and his wife
&gt; both play the game, too, but his wife dearly loves it.  I told him I liked
&gt; to build houses and had several yahoo groups to share them and that they
&gt; seemed pretty popular, especially my TV Land sims and houses.  He perked
&gt; right up and said, &quot;You're Madame Jeanie?&quot;  ROFL  Seems they've got a TV
&gt; Land neighborhood with my stuff in it.  Made me feel almost famous there for
&gt; a minute.

LOL!  How cool.  I wish I'd be spotted like that.

Hey, hobby is hobby, work is work.  I play with computer all the time, but
if someone hand me a computer-related work (and I don't mean doing office
suite kind of thing, I mean hard-core programming), I'd say no.

Sometimes it's hard for outsiders to understand why we spend so much time
with a game....
