This one is a little obvious after some thought, but I haven't heard it
mentioned before.

The frequency of light is like a clock in itself - if the frequency is lower
then the clock at the source is slower as measured by an observer who also
measures that redshift.  If the redshifted electromagnetic radiation was a
radio carrier wave then the frequency the observer must tune to is further
down the dial, as expected, but the sounds transmitted via that carrier wave
will also appear to be slowed down, like an audio tape running at the wrong
speed.

This is true regardless of the cause of redshift - source moving away from
observer, source near a gravitating body, or source at a very great distance
(Hubble shift).

The Hubble redshift observed on Earth must also be accompanied by time
dilation.  If the frequency of light received is half, for instance, then
the clock at the emitting end of that electromagnetic transmission is
running at half the pace as the clock at the receiving end.

I assume that this time dilation is taken into consideration when observing
pulsed transmission of the rotation of galaxies (pulses will be measured as
slower than the actual rate, galaxies will appear to rotate slower then than
actually do etc.)

Anyone know more on this?

As you indicate, this is pretty well known.  One familiar application

take longer to fade than supernovae at low redshift.  This rules out
tired-light models for redshift.
There's also an extra factor of (1+z) in the equation when you

There is a difference between the measured time dilation and actual time
dilation.  In expanding space we expect redshift in both directions.  But
time dilation is still measured at the receiver end.  The frequency of light
is known for certain elements, which is how redshift is established - I
assumed this knowledge above.

Instead of a light wave, let's consider photons.  The time it takes for a
photon to pass from emitter to receiver is t=d*c where d is the distance, t
is the transit interval and c is the speed of light.  For two photons
transmitted 1s apart, the first photon travels distance d in dc seconds.
But space expands continually so that when the second photon is emitted d
has expanded to d' where d', the distance travelled by the second photon, is
greater than d ie d'&gt;d therefore t'&gt;t

Thus a stream of photons emitted at 1s intervals arrives at a remote
receiver at intervals greater than 1s.  Thus any temporal information
emitted will also be time dilated (the intervals are dilated).

But as you point out, this is true *in either direction* ie if the receiver
emits photons at 1s intervals back to the original emitter then they will be
received at intervals greater than 1s.

We know that in one's own frame, time dilation never occurs (by one's own
measure).  That is not at issue.  Also, when two high velocity objects pass
each other they both measure time dilation and redshift in the other.

In the case of the expansion of spacetime, redshift indicates time dilation.
Thus if the redshift halves the frequency of the emitted light, the
intervals of transmitted photons will also double by the receiver's clock -
time dilation halves the speed of the emitters clock by the receivers
measure.

Amazingly, others are arguing against it.  For me it was just a penny
dropping - how obvious when you think about it...

Tired light would also have to incorporate time dilation. I don't see how
one can change the frequency of an emitted source without dilating time in
some way.  Tired light would necessarily have to include tired time as well.

I'm also interested to know how redshift data is effected by the concept of
a universe made up of so much dark matter.  Surely dark matter contributes
to space curvature and so would have to contribute to gravitational
redshift, and with a universe made up of &gt;90% dark matter this must
constitute an appreciable component of the redshift in the form of
gravitational redshift.

As I recall, earlier (1990s?) calculations that considered the accumulated
effect of gravitational redshift were insufficient to counter an expanding
spacetime model, but not by that much.  With the large portion of dark
matter in the universe, the accumulated gravitational redshift would be more
than sufficient to account for all the observed redshift plus a bit, though
I don't have those earlier calculations to hand (doing a bit of hand waving
myself...:)

Robert

I agree absolutely with you on that point.  It is such a 'given' that I may
not have made it clear that I make the assumption that no effect on the
emitter is caused by anything that happens to the emitted light or the
opinion of the receiver.  Time dilation is always a measured phenomena -
there is no such a thing as actual time dilation in the frame of the
observer no matter how fast that observer is travelling or how curved the
spacetime in his/her area.

When one measures redshift one is also measuring time dilation UNLESS the
redshift is caused by optical effects, scattering etc.  I have been
discussing light travelling in free space.

We can consider the whole thing in a slightly different context.  Let me
consider the transmission of individual photons across expanding space.  The
emitter emits photons at one second intervals.  But as space time is
expanding, the distance that each successive photon must travel is greater.
So the interval between each received photon is going to be greater than one
second.  If the photons were indicating a clock signal then time is clearly
dilated (as measured by the receiver.).  The same would be true is we now
transmit photons in the other direction- time dilation will be measured.

No wedge needed, believe me - we are in furious agreement on the issue of
remote measurement and local conditions.

I'm not sure what you mean by "would have to."  The tired-light idea

Gravitational redshift is a reality and has been measured, back in the 60s :
Effect of Gravity on Gamma Radiation
R. V. POUND and J. L. SNIDER

There must be some gravitational component in the observed cosmological
redshift, even if that component is immeasurably small.  Light coming from a
planet, star, galaxy, cluster of galaxies or even larger structures is
redshifted by those structures.  The greater the distance the light travels,
the more the gravitational redshift.

If the said structures have a large dark matter component then the
gravitational redshift will be greater.

But this does not mean that gravitational redshift forms a significant
portion of the measured cosmological redshift - one would have to quantify
the redshift component.  Of course light received by a detector on a massive
body is blue shifted, and as we measure redshift on a planet near a star in
a galaxy that is part of a cluster of galaxies etc this may well be
sufficient to cancel out any gravitational redshift at the emitting end of
that radiation.

The question is one of whether a beam of light emitted from one massive body
and received on an identical massive body will be frequency shifted due to
gravitation.

Light passing through a gravitational well falls into it
before climbing out again.  What's the net gravitational
red shift?  For gravitational wells of small extent (the
mass being bound by gravity and not subject to cosmological
expansion) the net effect is nil.  For loose systems that
are not gravitationally bound, which are sublect to
cosmological expansion and for which the traversal time
of light is not (relatively) negligable, there will be a
net red shift, as the light is 'stretched' during the
traversal.

The red shift caused by the gravitational field in which

I think Robert is missing the basic Doppler effect where the

not affected.

The second order component by which relativistic Doppler

that's a separate aspect. It gets complicated in the

I did not at any time think that the source was effected by what happens to
the light after transmission.  Time dilation is a measured phenomena - time
dilation never occurs in ones own inertial frame.

Transverse Doppler also causes a temporal distorting in the received
signal - a transmitted clock signal would be slower (but only in the
transmitted media eg sound).

The two are largely equivalent. There are a number of
ways to look at the situation. One is that light from
a distant source has its wavelength 'stretched' while
in transit so it is something that "happens to the light
after transmission". When thinking of supernovae, the
overall light curve gets stretched so a curve that would
last 20 days if nearby might seem to last say 25 days at
some large distance. That is because the light at the
end of that period was emitted from 5 light days farther
away. You can think of that as the source moving away by
5 light days in 20 days or a speed of 0.25c, or you can
think of the space between expanding by 5 light days in
the time. None of those views treats the effect as being
at the source.

In terms of gravitational time dilation, it gets trickier
and take this with a pinch of salt, I don't really know
the details of GR. However, bear in mind in the simple
expanding universe and no acceleration (dark energy),
the kinetic energy of galaxies relative to their
neighbours is decreasing implying their gravitational
potential energy is increasing, like an object thrown
vertically. If the universe is homogenous and isotropic,
the potential at any time should be roughly the same
everywhere, local clusters of mass cause dimples on the
surface only. Looking at high redshift objects is then
like looking at an atomic clock in a valley from the top
of a nearby hill. This time it does look like a source
effect but as usual the source is still running at its
normal rate in its local frame.

In all the interpretations, it is the angle between the
source and observer worldlines that causes the effect.

There is one very important difference.  Space time is a manifold -
basically, one can think of three spatial dimensions and one time dimension
OR to consider just three (flat) spatial dimensions and time separately. -
the results are the same.  Kip Thorne in 'Black Holes &amp; Time Warps' goes
into some detail to explain this and gives examples with illustrations to
make the point.

Thinking of gravitational time dilation, for instance, we can think of light
as being stretched as it climbs out of the gravity well or we can think of
the clock on the surface of the massive object as running slower relative to
the clock of the observer (somewhere away from the gravitating object).

The two are equivalent except that GR does not model the conditions whereby
no light is emitted ie the clock simply sits on the planet for a couple of
years.  GR is light temporal snapshots of spacetime - the time that is
modelled does not account for today and tomorrow, for instance.

Thus a clock on, say, the Earth will lag ever more behind a space clock.
The amount of time dilation is the same as the equation for gravitational
redshift ie
gamma=(1-2GM/c^2r)^.5

Note that space is NEVER curved, stretched or 'expanded', it is spacetime -
space does not change.  It is the time dimension that changes.

In the case of expanding space there is no way of expressing the manifold in
three flat spatial dimensions plus time (separately) as it is for
gravitational or relative motional time dilation.

Thus the expanding space model is one gaping hole in it.

There is a further problem with it.  As we approach the speed of light, the
distance between emitter and absorber falls to zero and the interval of ANY
transit also falls to zero.  Thus light can not change in frequency during a
zero interval transit across a zero distance space.

This is not a problem in all other relativistic redshift as one can explain
the phenomena using three spatial dimension and time (not together as
spacetime).  Eg gravitational time redshift is explained by the
gravitational time dilation at the emitter (the frequency of light is
actually lower at the point of emission).  This was measured by Pound and co
in the 60s.

One can not explain expanding space redshift in this way nor account for how
light can change its frequency in transit.  In the spacetime model we can
point to light being stretched as it passes over expanding spacetime.  But
the accompanying explanation from a frame closer to the speed of light or
from space and time separately is not forthcoming - simply put - there isn't
one.

Here are three quotes from P403 of the above mentioned book:-
-) As an example, in the curved spacetime paradigm, the verbal picture of
Einstein's field equation is the statement that "mass generates the
curvature of spacetime."  When translated into the language of the flat
spacetime paradigm, this field equation is described by the verbal picture
"mass generates the gravitational field that governs the shrinkage of rulers
and the dilation of ticking clocks."  Although the two versions of Einstein'
s field equations are equivalent, their verbal pictures differ profoundly.

-) Some problems are solved most easily and quickly using curved spacetime
paradigm; others, using flat spacetime.

-) This freedom carries power.  That is why physicists were not content with
Einstein's curved spacetime paradigm, and have developed the flat spacetime
paradigm as a supplement to it.

What is the flat space equivalent of expanding space - the version using
rods and clocks?  Only the concept of expanding spacetime fails this simple
test of consistency.

Within limitations, that is correct of course. What you
get then is pseudoforces such as gravity and other
coordinate effects. However, you need to keep in mind

Yes, what you are doing is selecting an arbitrary orientation

That appears to be nonsense. GR deals with spacetime as a

Bear in mind that even in SR, there is no 'absolute' demarcation
between space and time. What is bent in GR is spacetime and you
then choose a direction within that to call the time axis and
set up the spatial axes orthogonal to that. One man's space is
another man's time so it makes no sense to say only time can be
bent.

For example the old story is that when Einstein first predicted
the bending of light by the Sun he forgot the time part and got
the same result as Newton, however Eddington's first attempt was
unsucessful and Einstein corrected the prediction before the
actual measurement was made to double that of Newton. Half the
bending was spatial while half is temporal.

That is utter rubbish.  3D+Time copes with black holes etc and not all
spatial expansion involves faster than c totals.  The fact of the matter is
that there is no 3D+ time equivalent for ANY spatial expansion.  Also, there
are conditions where c is exceeded in SR.  Two photons emitted in opposite
directions from some point move away from each other at 2c such that at 1s
there is a 2*c distance between them.

There is no cause for this spacetime expansion.  In all other examples of
spacetime expansion or spacetime curvature, gravity or motion is involved.
But not with the expansion of spacetime.

Let me give you a clear analogy which you should be able to solve quite
easily if naked spacetime expansion is a valid concept:-
consider a volume evacuated to replicate the density of space (a near vacuum
by Earthly standards).  Now, given whatever tools you need, including those
that exist only 'in principle', how would you go about expanding or
contracting the spacetime in this volume?

Few can even offer an 'in principle' example.  Or maybe dark energy may be
called upon even though it was only dreamt up some 40~50 years after the
naked (away from gravitating bodies) expansion of spacetime became a widely
accepted concept (but not by Einstein).

Three space plus time is not a simple approximation.  As Thorne says - the
two are equivalent.  You are confusing Newtonian approximation with two
different accounts of the same thing and with the same precision ie one can
use the standard GR model of clocks and rods to explain ANY GR phenomena,
except for the expansion of spacetime.

A manifold by definition can be mapped onto three dimensions+time.  It
should be possible to do this with expanding spacetime (even if precision is
lost ie an approximation), after all, space is not changing in dimension -
space is not expanding.

Curved spacetime can always be mapped onto three dimensions+time.  All valid
forms, anyway.

Let's start with the basics - can space expand or contract?  The answer is
no.
What is the agent of spacetime expansion?
How would you replicate the expansion of spacetime *in principle*??

Saying that it is all too hard just doesn't wash.

And GR can not model time except where motion is involved.  The closest you
get is a light cone that expands, but it is still a temporal snapshot.  You
can not model a simple experiment where a clock is left on a massive body
for one hour as measured by that clock and show why that clock is losing
ever more time to a space based clock.

Consider three identical clocks A, B and C.  Let all three clocks be in
space well away from any massive body.  Let the clocks be synchronised.  Let
two of the clocks B and C be conveyed to the massive body.  Let one of the
clocks, B, be immediately conveyed back to clock A and the difference in
their measured time be compared.  B will show that less time has passed than
A.  GR has no problem modelling this.

Now, after some interval, let C be conveyed back to A and B (the conveyance
being identical for each trip to and from the massive body).  C will have
measured less time than A OR B.  GR can not model this because it involves
an interval that does not include any motion.  Kip Thorne mentions the
'snapshot' nature of GR in his book, so I don't think I need to rigorously
prove this point.

Yes, in fact, it is.  You understand gravitational time dilation,
how light emitted in a place of a higher curvature (mass per unit
volume is higher) and detected in a place of lower curvature
(mass per unit volume is lower) is apparently red shifted.  This

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is not a problem in all other relativistic redshift
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as one can explain the phenomena using three
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spatial dimension and time (not together as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spacetime).  Eg gravitational time redshift is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; explained by the gravitational time dilation at the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; emitter (the frequency of light is actually lower at
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the point of emission).  This was measured by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Pound and co in the 60s.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One can not explain expanding space redshift in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this way ..

&gt; &gt;&gt; As I explained you can, and in fact GR works even
&gt; &gt;&gt; beyond the horizon where the apparent recession
&gt; &gt;&gt; speed reaches c and your 3D+time model fails. All
&gt; &gt;&gt; you are showing is that the traditional view cannot
&gt; &gt;&gt; cope.

&gt; &gt; That is utter rubbish.  3D+Time copes with black
&gt; &gt; holes etc

&gt; It does not without &quot;curvature&quot;.
">

It certainly does.

GR Specifically models the effect that gravity has on the motion of objects
as they pass through a gravitational field - the curvature of spacetime.
That is where GR is in its element.  But if we just want to know about how a
Black Hole is different from, say, a planet then there are several ways of
modelling that.

No discipline can model the evolution of a black hole from a star than
quantum mechanics.  Special relativity plays a secondary role and general
relativity a tertiary role in the  QM description of the evolution of Black
Holes.

Schwarzschild's formula describes how a black hole can have any density at
all - the visible universe could be such a black hole (Schwarzschild'
Radius) if density and radius are in the correct proportions ie
r=2GM/c^2=(3c^2/8Gdpi)^.5 for radius=given mass=given density.

Light failing to escape from a black hole can be explained as photons being
unable to escape the gravitational pull, as light losing all of its energy
or of light being unable to climb out of the gravity well.  Each of these
explanations fail to take into account that as we approach the speed of
light the distance the photon travels falls to zero and the interval of
transit also falls to zero - photons can not be held in suspended animation.

The flat space model says that clocks near to the singularity are so dilated
that they never tick, so to speak, so an emitting source never emits a
photon.  This flat space model is the only one that is consistent with the
known conditions close to the speed of light.

Obviously GR is a specialist tool that is the most accurate tool when
applied to its specialisation (it explains the way that matter curve space
and the way that objects move in curve space).  But there are other
specialist tools that do far better than GR in their own areas of
specialisation.  Even so, each tool can explain the other, even if only in
principle (or very tentatively, such as the 'graviton' account of gravity
proper by QM), even if badly, not particularly accurately, or in a
convoluted manner.

Thus I await the alternative explanations of expanding space.  What is the
QM model?  What is the flat space model?  What is the SR model?  How would
you curve space in the lab given unlimited resources?  Of course I accept
that should the phenomena be valid it is GR that yield the most accurate
prediction of the path of objects in such expanding space etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; and not all spatial expansion involves faster than c
&gt; &gt; totals.

&gt; It is a fact in this Universe now.  But it is not necessarily
&gt; true.
">

Space is expanding between the Milky way and Andromeda.  As the net motion
of Andromeda is toward rather than away from the Milky Way I postulate that
light speed expansion is not involved.

Some commentators say that all space expands, others that only the space
between major structures expands (which was my original understanding).
I've given up any hope of finding a convincing argument one way or the
other.  Even so, light speed expansion between objects is not necessary in
all cases.  My point is that if faster than light expansion is a problem for
non GR models of expansion then those models should still be able to at
least model the very beginnings of expansion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The fact of the matter is that there is no 3D+ time
&gt; &gt; equivalent for ANY spatial[time] expansion.

&gt; Is that because you have one extra dimension?
">

No.  The extra dimension is only time - in three D plus time the time
dimension is still present.  In fact GR is often, indeed USUALLY explained
in just two dimensions - sheets.  John Wheeler said that he could only think
in two dimensions when contemplating GR.

What is the two dimensional (granny's incontinence rubber sheet version)
model of expanding space?

What is the rods and clocks version - wherever there is curved space the
length of rods and the intervals measured by clocks change.  Indeed, where
there is no gravitational force, the only measure of spatial curvature
should be the relative length of rods and dilation of clocks.

As space (three dimensions) never expands, it is ALWAYS possible to consider
and so model that flat space.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Also, there are conditions where c is exceeded in
&gt; &gt; SR.  Two photons emitted in opposite directions
&gt; &gt; from some point move away from each other at
&gt; &gt; 2c such that at 1s there is a 2*c distance
&gt; &gt; between them.

&gt; And?  No single thing is moving FTL.
">

Indeed.  And neither is any single thing 'moving' faster than light due to
expanding space.  The two are often differentiated by considering SR type
motion as 'inertial' motion.  Note that if an object is moving away from you
faster than the speed of light then it is invisible.  Somehow objects can
manage this if they are only carried along by expanding spacetime.  In flat
space, then, distant objects are never travelling greater than the speed of
light.  If we switch to expanding spacetime, the situation is different.
Thus SR can not only model the conditions (in principle) it is instructive.

&gt; Yes, in fact, it is.  You understand gravitational time dilation,
&gt; how light emitted in a place of a higher curvature (mass per unit
&gt; volume is higher) and detected in a place of lower curvature
&gt; (mass per unit volume is lower) is apparently red shifted.  This
&gt; works between aeons too.  Emitted in a smaller, denser Universe,
&gt; and absorbed in an older, larger, less dense Universe.
">

That is close to how I would model the conditions in flat space.  But though
your thoughts are intuitive and pleasing, I am not convinced that this is
how spacetime expansion is modelled (in any generally accepted way).

If you think that this is the way most cosmologists understand expansion of
spacetime then I'd like to see some reference or other evidence that this is
the case - believe me it would greatly simplify things if there were
consensus on this issue.

If it does prove to be the case that your (apparent) conjecture is the
generally agreed upon method of modelling curved spacetime then we can move
on to discuss modelling it in three dimensions plus time and the
implications of that.

However there is still the expansion of spacetime that occurred in the early
universe.  From what I can gather the current model (Lambda CDM) considers
the Big Bang beginning as quantum fluctuations in space ie there was no
super compressed matter as in earlier models (eg 1970s and the question a
singularity at T=0).  Just why spacetime would expand from this point is
even more problematic, in my view, as the first space curvature must be
explained in terms of quantum mechanics, as the original expansion and
subsequent inflation.  Only after a billion years or so does your large
scale structure model begin to make sense.

I've found another quote, this one from John Wheeler in 'Geons, Black Holes
&amp; Quantum Foam', P.270 (paperback):

"In general relativity, for instance, it is sometimes easier to talk of the
three dimensional geometry of space evolving through time, and sometimes
easier to talk of the four-dimensional geometry of spacetime that just "is".
It is not a question of one description being right and the other wrong, or
even of one being better than the other.  They are simply two ways to
describe the same physics."

I hope that this, along with Tom Robert's clear insight, is sufficient
explanation of the point I was trying to make.  I don't particularly want to
have to trawl through Thorne's book in search of the particular quote you
questioned (I didn't make a note of it at the time).

Note the 'snapshot' imagery to which I refer.

All you are doing in your trivial solution is to lower the density of matter
in the volume.  That can also be achieve by evacuating the volume.  This is
not expanding space-time by any measure that I am aware of.

Consider this question - will light passing through your trivial example be
redshifted due to the lower density of the gas and will a clock signal
projected across the volume show time dilation (due to the transit across
your expanding space)??

Sorry, no.  Expansion is not a function of dust particles in space.
Redshift is not caused by scattering (specifically, interaction with the
dust particles).  Indeed, if that were the case then we would see greater
redshift where the density of matter is greater, not less as in expanded
spacetime.

Your solution smacks of a personal conjecture rather than a reference to
generally agreed cosmological principles or cosmological models.  If I am
wrong in this, please supply some form of reference so that I can study your
position in greater detail eg book or paper, online resource etc.

Such a the famous GR book 'Gravitation', by MTW.  MTW stands for Misner,
Thorne and Wheeler.  The 'Thorne' is 'Kip Thorne', which book I refer to.  I
do have the book Gravitation.  One of its other authros says this:-

"In general relativity, for instance, it is sometimes easier to talk of the
three dimensional geometry of space evolving through time, and sometimes
easier to talk of the four-dimensional geometry of spacetime that just "is".
It is not a question of one description being right and the other wrong, or
even of one being better than the other.  They are simply two ways to
describe the same physics."

That's from John Wheeler in 'Geons, Black Holes
&amp; Quantum Foam', P.270 (paperback).  Wheeler, after Einstein, *is* General
Relativity.

Perhaps you might like to give me a reference refuting Wheeler's and
Thorne's position?? (I have 'Gravitation', so a page number for that book
will do).

Note that even if one approach is simpler or yields better or more accurate
result, the other approach can still be utilised.  It just means that less
applicable approach yields poorer results, is more convoluted, more
complicated or whatever.

You have not answered the question.  Distant galaxies are not moving

They are not accumulating inertial motion relative to us (observers here on

&gt; &gt; Saying that it is all too hard just doesn't wash.

&gt; &gt; And GR can not model time except where motion is involved.  The closest
you
&gt; &gt; get is a light cone that expands, but it is still a temporal snapshot.

&gt; What on earth are you talking about, a light cone by
&gt; definition is a 4D structure. It describes a 3D sphere
&gt; which expands as a function of time such that the
&gt; radius is c*t. The 4D view is a &quot;snapshot&quot; but not in
&gt; the usual sense of 3D at some instant, the time axis
&gt; is extended in the 4D picture.

&gt; &gt; You
&gt; &gt; can not model a simple experiment where a clock is left on a massive
body
&gt; &gt; for one hour as measured by that clock and show why that clock is losing
&gt; &gt; ever more time to a space based clock.

&gt; Of course you can, how do you think gravitational
&gt; slowing is predicted?

&gt; &gt; Consider three identical clocks A, B and C.  Let all three clocks be in
&gt; &gt; space well away from any massive body.  Let the clocks be synchronised.
Let
&gt; &gt; two of the clocks B and C be conveyed to the massive body.  Let one of
the
&gt; &gt; clocks, B, be immediately conveyed back to clock A and the difference in
&gt; &gt; their measured time be compared.  B will show that less time has passed
than
&gt; &gt; A.  GR has no problem modelling this.

&gt; &gt; Now, after some interval, let C be conveyed back to A and B (the
conveyance
&gt; &gt; being identical for each trip to and from the massive body).  C will
have
&gt; &gt; measured less time than A OR B.  GR can not model this because it
involves
&gt; &gt; an interval that does not include any motion.

&gt; Utter nonsense, of course it copes with it without
&gt; the slightest problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is not a problem in all other relativistic redshift
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as one can explain the phenomena using three
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spatial dimension and time (not together as
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spacetime).  Eg gravitational time redshift is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; explained by the gravitational time dilation at the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; emitter (the frequency of light is actually lower at
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the point of emission).  This was measured by
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Pound and co in the 60s.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One can not explain expanding space redshift in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this way ..

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As I explained you can, and in fact GR works even
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; beyond the horizon where the apparent recession
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; speed reaches c and your 3D+time model fails. All
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you are showing is that the traditional view cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cope.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is utter rubbish.  3D+Time copes with black
&gt; &gt; &gt; holes etc

&gt; &gt; It does not without &quot;curvature&quot;.

&gt; It certainly does.

&gt; GR Specifically models the effect that gravity has on
&gt; the motion of objects as they pass through a
&gt; gravitational field - the curvature of spacetime.  That
&gt; is where GR is in its element.  But if we just want to
&gt; know about how a Black Hole is different from, say,
&gt; a planet then there are several ways of modelling that.

&gt; No discipline can model the evolution of a black hole
&gt; from a star than quantum mechanics.  Special
&gt; relativity plays a secondary role and general relativity
&gt; a tertiary role in the QM description of the evolution
&gt; of Black Holes.

Since there is no gravitation, time, or space in QM... I'd be
fascinated in how you think QM describes any such "evolution".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Schwarzschild's formula describes how a black

&gt; proportions ie  r=2GM/c^2=(3c^2/8Gdpi)^.5 for
&gt; radius=given mass=given density.

&gt; Light failing to escape from a black hole can be
&gt; explained as photons being unable to escape the
&gt; gravitational pull, as light losing all of its energy or
&gt; of light being unable to climb out of the gravity well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

One can drop an object from very near the EH starting essentially at
rest, on a very large black hole, and the infalling object will not be
"approaching the speed of light" for some long time later.  I think
you invoke an image that will not serve you well later.

Additionally, light has been held to very near zero speed, such that a
material object outside the BE condensate envelope can outpace it.
And I understand you meant "in vacuuo".  But...

Light does not randomly lose a little energy in passing.  That is how
we recognize ancient objects... because their spectra are unaltered
(absorption notwithstanding).  Light very much is in suspended
animation, when you consider it never loses energy, and were you to be
able to travel alongside it, would appear as a stationary E and M
field... a 'standing wave' as it were.

&gt; No.  The extra dimension is only time - in three D

Space *must* expand.  Consider that perhaps there is only time, and
the laws of physics.  Early mathematicians in studying the
interactions of billiard balls noted that two body interactions define
two orthogonal axes, and three (or more) bodies generate 3D space.
Space is simply the *result* of time and conservation of momentum.
Since space is not some rigid structure, but is dependent, its
expansion can be generated by diddling with clocks.  The laws of
physics will maintain a local "normality".

Inflation models start with Quantum fluctuation - the 'free lunch'.

See Cosmology for Beginners: Inflation for Beginners by John Gribbin
http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/John_Gribbin/cosmo.htm

The universe, if it started from a quantum fluctuation, was no hotter or
denser than any other vacuous spatial extension at T=0.
We also have to accept a near infinite number of paralell universes etc.

Photons are not objects and they do not accelerate.

By "approaching the speed of light" was referring to the math ie at 0.5c,
0.75c, 0.9c, 0.99c, that is, as we approach the speed of light.  As there is
no light frame, conditions at c can only be inferred by conditions at
c-1/infinity ie very slightly slower than c, which is a valid inertial
frame.

For instance in the frame of a neutrino emitted at a speed of almost c just
after the big bang and absorbed by a detector here on earth interval of
emission to absorption will be a few seconds and the distance that the
neutrino travelled will be just a few millimetres.

Light travelling through a medium is absorbed and re-radiated numerous
times.  The speed of light may thus seem to be less but it is in fact no
slower at all.  Between particles *is* a vacuum, regardless of the density
of the material, and through that vacuum light travels at c.

You are confusing the transmission of a light beam through a medium with the
speed of a photon through space, which is always c and NEVER slower.  It

You can not travel alongside a photon, even in principle.  The reason is
that the universe is far too small.  For the interval at c as a photon
travels from one side of the universe to the other is zero and the distance
that the photon travels at c is zero ie the point of emission and absorption
are touching in the c frame.  In essence, the speed of a photon in the light
frame is zero, because it travels no distance in no time.

You are confusing the basics of photonic radiation and Special relativity
with Newtonian physics, where one could happily travel alongside a photon
*in principle*.

Here are some SR basics - the speed of light is always c regardless of the
frame of the observer (assuming the beam of light is travelling through a
vacuum or the speed of single photons is being observed).  Thus if you
managed to get yourself to c-1/infinity speed and shone a torch, the light
would leave that torch at the speed of light *relative to you and your

You're confused.  If time is sufficiently dilated then no observer outside
the frame of that clock will observe the clock ever ticking eg if the clock
were travelling at the speed of light it would never tick even if it
travelled from one side of the universe to the other in 20 billion of our
Earth years.  It may well tick in its own frame, but just what that means is
beyond our purchase as there is no way that we can witness that ticking,

&gt; &gt; account of gravity proper by QM), even if badly,
&gt; &gt; not particularly accurately, or in a convoluted
&gt; &gt; manner.

&gt; &gt; Thus I await the alternative explanations of
&gt; &gt; expanding space.  What is the QM model?

&gt; There is no spacetime in QM.  A thing has happened or it hasn't.
&gt; Where the participants are located is inconsequential.  And there is
&gt; no entropy... a proton a billion years old and one that just formed in
&gt; pair creation have thh same identical quantum properties.

Photons are quantums of light are regularly modeled in spacetime.

From Wikipedia:
"Much of the difficulty in merging these theories at all energy scales comes
from the different assumptions that these theories make on how the universe
works. Quantum field theory depends on particle fields embedded in the flat
space-time of special relativity. General relativity models gravity as a
curvature within space-time that changes as mass moves. Historically, the
most obvious way of combining the two (such as treating gravity as simply
another particle field) ran quickly into what is known as the
renormalization problem. In the old-fashioned understanding of
renormalization, gravity particles would attract each other and adding
together all of the interactions results in many infinite values which
cannot easily be cancelled out mathematically to yield sensible, finite
results. This is in contrast with quantum electrodynamics where, while the
series still don't converge, the interactions sometimes evaluate to infinite
results, but those are few enough in number to be removable via
renormalization."

Special Relativity, including spacetime, have always been part quantum
mechainics.  Only large scale general relativity is not currently modeled in
QM

Actually no.  There is no quantum state (short of the magic

&gt;&gt; &gt; Each of these explanations fail to take into account

&gt;&gt; &gt; in suspended animation.

&gt;&gt; One can drop an object from very near the EH
&gt;&gt; starting essentially at rest, on a very large black
&gt;&gt; hole, and the infalling object will not be
&gt;&gt; &quot;approaching the speed of light&quot; for some long
&gt;&gt; time later.  I think you invoke an image that will
&gt;&gt; not serve you well later.

&gt; Photons are not objects and they do not accelerate.

&gt; By &quot;approaching the speed of light&quot; was referring to
&gt; the math ie at 0.5c, 0.75c, 0.9c, 0.99c, that is, as
&gt; we approach the speed of light.  As there is no light
&gt; frame, conditions at c can only be inferred by
&gt; conditions at c-1/infinity ie very slightly slower than
&gt; c, which is a valid inertial frame.

&gt; For instance in the frame of a neutrino emitted at
&gt; a speed of almost c just after the big bang and
&gt; absorbed by a detector here on earth interval of
&gt; emission to absorption will be a few seconds and
&gt; the distance that the neutrino travelled will be just
&gt; a few millimetres.

That is all fine and good.  However, I can emit a particle with
near zero speed near the event horizon, and it will be travelling
nowhere near c when it crosses the EH.  Only for objects "falling
from infinity", or directed towards the EH with significant speed
is the phrase "approaching the speed of light" correct.

&gt; Light travelling through a medium is absorbed and

&gt; You are confusing the transmission of a light beam

We have held photons in suspended animation (BE condensate).  We
have trapped photons in quantum wells (we can even "measure" them
there without absorbing them).  You seem to be saying that we

&gt; You can not travel alongside a photon, even in principle.
&gt; The reason is that the universe is far too small.  For the

c has no frame.  You cannot apply / infer the LT and say
something about what a photon sees, however much poetry you see

In 1974, John Gribbin and Stephen Plagemann published The Jupiter Effect, a
book predicting that an alignment of the planets would create a number of
catastrophes, including a great earthquake on the San Andreas Fault in 1982.
The predicted catastrophes did not occur, as the gravitational effect of the
other planets on the Earth's crust is minimal even at their closest
approach. In his 1999 book "The Little Book of Science," Dr. Gribbin said of
his theory "...I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with
it."

John Gribbin has been mainstream science for a long time now.
But one must be cautious.  Interestingly, most scientists go weird at the
end of their careers eg Heisenberg, Schrodinger etc etc.

I'll deal with this issue separately.  Here is a quote from John Wheeler:-

"Others had thought about these questions before me. Back in the 1930s,
Fritz Zwicky of Caltech had postulated neutron stars; Subrahmanyan
Chan-drasekhar, then at Cambridge University, had calculated the largest
mass of a white dwarf that could withstand the crushing imperative of
gravity; and Robert Oppenheimer with George Volkoff and Hartland Snyder at
Berkeley had discussed the collapse of heavy stars. But much more remained
to be learned about the ultimate fate of stars of all sizes. What they do
depends on whether they are small, medium, large, or extra large. I set some
of my good students to work on questions of stellar death, and they came up
with answers. By 1958, Kent Harrison, Masami Wakano, and I had learned
something about three conceivable ultimate fates of burned-out stars. A star
like our own Sun, we reckoned, would shrink to become a white dwarf. There
is nothing extreme about a white dwarf. It is small, but not terribly small;
dense, but not terribly dense. Spacetime is "flat" within it (that is,
relativity plays no special role), and the atoms in its core remain atoms.
A second fate awaits more massive stars. Stirling Colgate, an energetic
weapons scientist turned astrophysicist, used the increasingly powerful
computers becoming available in the late 1950s at Livermore Laboratory to
trace the final stages of a star appreciably more massive than the Sun. His
calculations showed that such a star becomes a supernova. Its calculated
properties matched observed properties of supernovas that astronomers had
seen from time to time in other galaxies. (In July 1054, Chinese astronomers
had seen an outburst that was, in fact, a supernova in our own galaxy. Its
residue, the Crab Nebula, remains an object of great interest.)

A supernova is a star that both collapses and explodes. The energy released
by its collapse powers the explosion of its outer layers. Left behind,
according to theory, is an object far smaller and denser than a white dwarf.
It is called a neutron star because it is literally one giant nucleus made
up of neutrons. Its atoms have been crushed out of existence, with their
electrons and protons forced by the extreme gravity to unite, becoming
neutrons. What Wakano's calculations showed is that the neutron star, within
a certain range of size and density, is a stable object. Like the much
larger white dwarf, it is a possible end state of a burned-out star. The
white dwarf and the neutron star last indefinitely, unable to release more
energy and not inclined to shrink further. A stable neutron star, we
calculated, would have a diameter of only about 15 miles and a density a
million billion times that of our Sun. Its mass would be comparable to that
of the Sun, at most about 2 solar masses.

When we reported this work in 1958, the neutron star was still a theoretical
object. It would be another decade before Antony Hewish and Jocelyn Bell in
England would report the discovery of pulsars -quickly identified as
rotating neutron stars. Then we could bolster our belief in these
astronomical oddities with real observational evidence. Today we know that
at the center of the Crab Nebula, exactly where the sky brightened so
dramatically in July 1054, sits a neutron star, blinking at us 30 times per
second as it spins on its axis.

The third possible fate of a dead star is the most dramatic. We are
convinced now that if a star is massive enough, it will neither contract
gently to a final state as a white dwarf nor transform itself into a
neutron-star nugget after exploding as a supernova. It will collapse to a
point of infinite or near-infinite density from which neither light nor
anything else can escape. Only its gravitational aura will remain.

For some years this idea of collapse to what we now call a black hole went
against my grain. I just didn't like it. I tried my hardest to find a way
out, to avoid compulsory implosion of great masses. At first I thought that
a collapsing star might radiate so much light and throw off so much matter
in the early stages of its contraction that its mass would shrink below the
value needed to keep the collapse going. It would stop contracting as it
became a white dwarf or neutron star. Before long we learned that this
mechanism won't save the day for a star of great mass. So I looked to
elementary-particle interactions for salvation. Is it possible, I asked,
that repulsive forces between particles can prevent the particles from being
squeezed to densities much greater than the density of an atomic nucleus? In
due course we learned that this mechanism won't save the day either. The
enormous pressure that builds within collapsing matter actually adds to the
mass of the material and contributes more to the gravity that is driving the
collapse inward than to the outward forces that would stop the collapse.

At this point in the evolution of my thinking (the early 1960s), I realized
that nothing could prevent a large-enough chunk of cold matter from
collapsing to a dimension smaller than the "Schwarzschild radius." Within a
sphere of this radius, everything, including light, is trapped. The surface
of this sphere defines what we call the "horizon," the boundary of a black
hole. Yet I could still entertain the idea that within the black hole, "new
physics" stops the collapse short of a mathematical point of infinite
density. In 1964, Roger Penrose offered a powerful theorem showing that such
new physics would have to be new indeed, for his theorem establishes that,
for just about any description of matter that anyone has imagined, a
singularity must sit at the center of a black hole.

Where I stand now is to imagine that the yet-to-be-discovered true blending
of the quantum with general relativity will indeed provide that new physics,
operating at the "Planck scale," the incredibly small dimension where
quantum foam makes its appearance, and that the core of a black hole will
prove to have some structure, albeit tiny beyond all imagining."

From 'Geons, Black Holes &amp; Quantum Foam', P293~295.

I have read the about the quantum mechanical processes that force the
electon into the proton to form neurtons.  There are process with names like
'confinement principle' (I don't recall exactly) and there are several
steps, described by quantum mechanics.  Wheeler, a virtuouso General
Relativity scientist, blieves that Quantum mechanics is needed to describe
the singularity and I concur with his view.  Of course there is currently no
such description beyond the neutron star stage (I think).

mathematical accounts concur with presumed observations.  The calculation of
gamma at close to c applies to the relatively stationary observers
observation of high velocity objects and of the high velocity observer's
observation of the relatively stationary observer ie
gamma=1/(1-u^2/c^2)^.5 ('u' being the speed of the object)

The calculation does not provide for a speed of c ie 1-c^2/c^2=0 though an
infinite gamma is rapidly approach as the speed approaches c.  Electrons and
neutrinos can be emitted at very high speeds.  Indeed, they are not exactly
collecting dust inside some of these bigger accelerators :)

from 'Q is for Quantum: Particle Physics from A to Z':
"Relativistic Quantum Mechanics: The version of quantum mechanics that also
takes account of the requirements of the special theory of relativity (see
relativity theory). As yet, there is no satisfactory theory that includes
quantum mechanics and the \ general theory of relativity (see theory of
everything), but this does not matter when dealing with practical problems
such as the way atomic spectra are produced, because quantum gravity is
likely to be important only at the Planck scale.

But the requirements of the special theory are extremely important in
practical applications such as spectroscopy. This is most easily understood
by thinking of the electrons in an atom as tiny particles moving very fast
in their orbits; any system in which high speeds are involved (that is,
speeds that are a sizeable fraction of the speed of light) has to be
described in terms of the special theory if we want to predict its behaviour
accurately.

The first person to achieve this marriage of quantum theory and the special
theory was Paul Dirac, in 1928.  Among other things, his development of
relativistic quantum mechanics led to the prediction of the existance of
antimatter."

Minkowski's 'SpaceTime' is a special relativistic concept.

Note that photon's are quantum particles and the path of photons does follow
curved spacetime eg in the vacinity of a massive object such as a star.

The history of space-time in QM is not new - here the abstract of paper by
Feynman from 1948:-

Space-Time Approach to Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
R.P. Feynman Cornell University, Ithaca, New York
Reprinted in "Quantum Electrodynamics", edited by Julian Schwinger

Abstract Non-relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated here in a
different way. It is, however, mathematically equivalent to the familiar
formulation. In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can
happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex
contributions, one from each alternative way. The probability that a
particle will be found to have a path x(t) lying somewhere within a region
of space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one from each path in
the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an
exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of ~)
for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching x,
t from the past is the wave function  (x, t). This is shown to satisfy
Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is
discussed. Applications are indicated, in particular to eliminate the
coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum
electrodynamics. "
http://dbserv.ihep.su/~elan/src/feynman48c/eng.pdf

Here is a short extract from 'The History of Quantum Mechanics':
"Heisenberg's work used matrix methods made possible by the work of Cayley
on matrices 50 years earlier. In fact 'rival' matrix mechanics deriving from
Heisenberg's work and wave mechanics resulting from Schrödinger's work now
entered the arena. These were not properly shown to be equivalent until the
necessary mathematics was developed by Riesz about 25 years later.
Also in 1927 Bohr stated that space-time coordinates and causality are
complementary. Pauli realised that spin, one of the states proposed by Bose,
corresponded to a new kind of tensor, one not covered by the Ricci and
Levi-Civita work of 1901. However the mathematics of this had been
anticipated by Eli Cartan who introduced a 'spinor' as part of a much more
general investigation in 1913.

Dirac, in 1928, gave the first solution of the problem of expressing quantum
theory in a form which was invariant under the Lorentz group of
transformations of special relativity. He expressed d'Alembert's wave
equation in terms of operator algebra.

The uncertainty principle was not accepted by everyone. Its most outspoken
opponent was Einstein. He devised a challenge to Niels Bohr which he made at
a conference which they both attended in 1930. Einstein suggested a box
filled with radiation with a clock fitted in one side. The clock is designed

No, you have been claiming that the two were perfectly

&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a 2*c distance between them.

&gt; &gt; The distance is 2c and both photons are moving at

&gt; Neither has it been exceeded in expanding spacetime, which is the point I

Again that just highlights the difference. Over short
distances galaxies recede with distances increasing by
less than c m/s and you can say the galaxy is moving
away at that speed, or you can say space is expanding
at the Hubble rate and there is an additional proper
motion relative to the local flow, the descriptions
are pretty much equivalent. However for high red shifts
that gets problematic and eventually for large enough
distances the rate of increase exceeds c. Bear in mind
the current models suggest the universe is probably
infinite so Hubble speeds go to infinity. Your simple
mapping doesn't cater for that.

&gt; &gt; Cosmology at large scales treats matter as 'dust' where
&gt; &gt; each 'grain' represents a gravtiationally bound object
&gt; &gt; such as a cluster of galaxies.

move apart.

Yes, a photon emitted by a particle of dust on one side of the

other side because they are moving apart. Bear in mind each

&gt; Your solution smacks of a personal conjecture rather than a reference to
&gt; generally agreed cosmological principles or cosmological models.  If I am
&gt; wrong in this, please supply some form of reference so that I can study your

Treating the largest gravitationally bound structures as 'dust' is
the basic approach in cosmological models. I did a web search and
at the top here's a reference from a FAQ on dark matter:

http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~jpl/cosmo/bad.html#CDM

"First of all, be very careful using the word "dust" in
cosmology, as it has two completely different meanings:
To astronomers, "dust" consists of micron sized grains
made of carbon and heavier elements (or their compounds)
which float around in space and absorb light passing by,
obscuring distant stars; dense clumps of dust. are
visible as "dark nebulae".  .... To cosmologists, "dust"
means any form of matter which does not exert a pressure
which is comparable to its energy density, or in other
words any form of matter which is cool enough that its
particles are not moving at relativistic speeds.  Most
cosmologists think of entire galaxies as constituting
the "grains" of this dust!"

But in general if you look up how the acceleration parameter
is found for any model, the contribution of the non-zero mean
matter density is described as a dust model. Have a look in
MTW, I don't have a copy but I'm sure the term will be covered.

In 3D plus time one has to calculate the amount of time dilation at each

I think you mean that *spacetime* is expanding.
In the simple mapping, space is not expanding (only space-time).  The
simpler mapping needs to refer to the cause of the spacetime expansion eg
around a gravitating body it is the gravitational potential that causes
spacetime it expand.  The only problem with Hubble expansion is that the
cause is aesthetic rather than scientific.

Not necessarily.  Objects are not moving inertially ie that are not moving
with respect to the space around them.  One can measure this inertial speed
in principle by comparing the motion of the object to the motion of comoving
space debres, as there are always other objects in space.  If the object
under observation ios moving with respect to all other objects then we can
say that it motion is inertial, but if all objects in the area are moving in
the same direction with approximately the same speed then we would conclude
that the motion is not inertial.  If it is not inertial then the motion is
not apparant in a 3d space model. The redshift will have the same cause as
that which cause the spacetime expansion in the first place.  For the
redshift of an object in the vacinity of a gravitasting body it is the
gravitational 'force' that causes the redshift in 3D+T.

In other words, in 3D+T, distant galaxies are not moving away from the
obsever.  This was, however, the assumption in the early days (that galaxies
had inertial motion).

This density theory requires a reference - or is this your own conclusion?

It is my understanding that earlier theory predicted that the density would
fall with distance and so there should be fewer galaxies with larger spatial
gaps between them as we peer deeper and deeper into space.  The voids were
thought to be a sign of just this.  But Hubble was pointed into the voids
for a deep space probe and found that no only were they teeming with
objects, but the density of objects was no different to what it is locally.

Note that the only matter visible at ever greater distances is stars,
galaxies and then blusterers of galaxies.  The density of these objects
should decrease along with the spatial expansion.  There is no evidence that
this actually happens.

In fact one would expect spacetime to be more compact at greater distances.
But it isn't - there is more of it.

That does not make your conjecture correct. I asked you how you would expand

particles would move apart.  That is hardly an answer.  Further, we would

been expanding for the last 15 billion years) than distally (where spacetime
has had less time in which to expand).  But these observations have not been

I'm not disputing the definition of dust.  I was challenging you to expand
space in the laboratory *in principle* and you referred to gas molecules and
dust.  Are you suggesting that you can fit galaxies into the lab?  It is
reasonable to refer to particles in my reply.  Further, your explanation
with gas particles was flat out wrong, or you missed out the essential part
of the explanation.

You said:
"Trivial, move the boundaries of the volume outwards and the mean distance
between the gas molecules increases.  Cosmology at large scales treats
matter as 'dust' where each 'grain' represents a gravitationally bound
object such as a cluster of galaxies."

in response to:
"consider a volume evacuated to replicate the density of space (a near
vacuum by Earthly standards).  Now, given whatever tools you need, including
those that exist only 'in principle', how would you go about expanding or
contracting the spacetime in this volume?"

All you have managed to provide is a lame explanation of the condition of
your volume after the expansion occurs and then to go on to carefully
explain a well known definition of the word 'dust'.

And don't try to bring in the Friedman equation - stochastic local expansion
found in the equation does not explain the orderly expansion of the entire

"Observation of coherent optical information storage in an atomicmedium
using halted light pulses
CHIEN LIU, ZACHARY DUTTON, CYRUS H. BEHROOZI &amp; LENE VESTERGAARD HAU

Electromagnetically induced transparency is a quantum interference effect
that permits the propagation of light through an otherwise opaque atomic
medium; a 'coupling' laser is used to create the interference necessary to
allow the transmission of resonant pulses from a 'probe' laser.  This
technique has been used to slow and spatially compress light pulses by seven
orders of magnitude, resulting in their complete localization and
containment within an atomic cloud. Here we use electromagnetically induced
transparency to bring laser pulses to a complete stop in a magnetically
trapped, cold cloud of sodium atoms. Within the spatially localized pulse
region, the atoms are in a superposition state determined by the amplitudes
and phases of the coupling and probe laser fields. Upon sudden turn-off of
the coupling laser, the compressed probe pulse is effectively stopped;
coherent information initially contained in the laser fields is 'frozen' in
the atomic medium for up to 1 ms. The coupling laser is turned back on at a
later time and the probe pulse is regenerated: the stored coherence is read
out and transferred back into the radiation field. We present a theoretical
model that reveals that the system is self-adjusting to minimize dissipative
loss during the 'read' and 'write' operations. We anticipate applications of
this phenomenon for quantum information processing."

RKS:
no single transmission of light is frozen.  What is frozen is the "coherent
information initially contained in the laser fields" and not the photons per
se.

We experimentally demonstrate emission of two quantum-mechanically

temporal storage of photonic states in an ensemble of rubidium atoms. The
experiment is based on Raman scattering, which produces correlated pairs of
spin-flipped atoms and photons, followed by coherent conversion of the
atomic states into a different photon beam after a controllable delay. This
resonant nonlinear optical process is a promising technique for potential
applications in quantum communication."

From the comments:-

"Speeding up light
The article refers to the speed of light in an optical fibre. This means the
speed of light in glass, which is closer to 2.10^8 than 3.10^8.

Furthermore the speed of light in various media travels at different speeds
depending on the exact wavelength of the light. So it is possible to speed
up light by, for example, changing the wavelength that travels through the
fibre. You can look at the original article on: http://www.opticsexpress.org
"

The Paper can be downloaded from here.
http://www.opticsexpress.org/abstract.cfm?id=116587
They are, of course, not referring to light travelling faster than c as the
poorly written article claimed nor are they referring to the slowing of an
actual light beam but to scattering ie the absorption and re-radiation of
light.  Between each of these events is vacuous space through which light
charges along at c (between each atom in a material is a vacuum like the one
found out there in space).

The science backs me up, the magazine article seems to support you.

Are you saying that it doesn't apply to light?  Whist it is not possible to

these conditions).

One can not say what happens at c, which is why I can't say that time

relativistic time dilation and length contraction do not apply to photons.

If your statement is derived from science theory then I would very much like
to know what that theory is - what theory outlines the conditions for a
photon as it travels at the speed of light?  If you have no science to back
you up then the statement "Only applies.." is your opinion and should be
stated as such ie "In my opinion, this only applies to massive particles."

&gt; We experimentally demonstrate emission of two quantum-
&gt; mechanically correlated light pulses with a time delay that
&gt; is coherently controlled via temporal storage of photonic
&gt; states in an ensemble of rubidium atoms. The experiment
&gt; is based on Raman scattering, which produces correlated
&gt; pairs of spin-flipped atoms and photons, followed by
&gt; coherent conversion of the atomic states into a different
&gt; photon beam after a controllable delay. This resonant
&gt; nonlinear optical process is a promising technique for
&gt; potential applications in quantum communication.&quot;

&gt; RKS:
&gt; Again, it is the state of the photon emission that is stored
&gt; and not the photon per se.

The *readout* is written to another photon beam at a later time.
At which time the original photon's existence ends.  The photon
is trapped.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And of course you know that charge is (modelled as)

&gt; &quot;Speeding up light

&gt; This means the speed of light in glass, which is closer

And probably phase or group velocity at that...

&gt; Between each of these events is vacuous space through

It is a reasonable conclusion... for massive particles.

Not so far in this thread.  You have provided only your
interpretation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; The path that photons take is the shortest

&gt;&gt; &gt; path will be likewise curved.  That does not
&gt;&gt; &gt; mean that decisions are made 'in flight'.  Indeed,
&gt;&gt; &gt; the very idea is an illusion.  As u approaches c the
&gt;&gt; &gt; length of the path taken by a high velocity object
&gt;&gt; &gt; approaches zero and the interval of transmission
&gt;&gt; &gt; approaches zero.

&gt;&gt; Repeating it does not make it more true.

&gt; I don't think you can falsify it.

I have provided counter evidence, which has so far been
unremarked.  From emission to absorption, light "responds" to all
the intervening stuff, curved space and diffraction effects
(which both provide non-Euclidean paths, but diffraction is not
curved space).  So between emission and apsorption there are
"intermediate effects", how sure are you that time is not much
more than this?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is the path through spacetime that is the shortest,

You insist on applying the LT where they cannot go.  Obtain a

&gt;&gt; No, you have been claiming that the two were perfectly

&gt;&gt; time axis and map to 3D plus time, but the time for in
&gt;&gt; infalling object to reach the horizon is infinite in
&gt;&gt; that mapping while it is finite in the proper time of
&gt;&gt; the object, and in fact it takes a finite time to reach
&gt;&gt; the physical singularity at the centre.

&gt; In 3D plus time one has to calculate the amount of time dilation at each

At the event horizon, the time dilation factor becomes
infinite and I don't think the region within the horizon
maps onto any part of the 3D coordinate system.

No, it isn't a question of approximation. Outside the

&gt;&gt; &gt; Neither has it been exceeded in expanding spacetime, which is the point
&gt;&gt; &gt; I
&gt;&gt; &gt; was making ie if we consider only the speed of the objects (eg
&gt;&gt; &gt; galaxies)
&gt;&gt; &gt; through space then none are exceeding the speed of light.

&gt;&gt; Again that just highlights the difference. Over short
&gt;&gt; distances galaxies recede with distances increasing by
&gt;&gt; less than c m/s and you can say the galaxy is moving
&gt;&gt; away at that speed, or you can say space is expanding
&gt;&gt; at the Hubble rate and there is an additional proper
&gt;&gt; motion relative to the local flow, the descriptions
&gt;&gt; are pretty much equivalent. However for high red shifts
&gt;&gt; that gets problematic and eventually for large enough
&gt;&gt; distances the rate of increase exceeds c. Bear in mind
&gt;&gt; the current models suggest the universe is probably
&gt;&gt; infinite so Hubble speeds go to infinity. Your simple
&gt;&gt; mapping doesn't cater for that.

&gt; I think you mean that *spacetime* is expanding.
">

No, I meant space. Distances increase as a function of time
and in the standard GR description space is said to expand.
The uniform homogenous approximation is called the "Hubble
Flow" and individual galaxies have "proper motions" relative
to that mean.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the simple mapping, space is not expanding (only space-time).
">

"spacetime" is the 4D view so includes time as an axis, it
cannot expand because that implies a change with time, but
time is inherently part of it. Again, look at the spacetime
diagram or better the one below it with "US" shown:

http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_03.htm#mstd

Note the horizontal grey lines which are "space" at different
epochs. The length of those lines between the worldlines of
the galaxies increases as you go up the diagram which is what
is meant by space expanding. Note also the worldlines near the
bottom edge of the diagram slope more than the edges of the
lightcones on our worldline meaning the speeds of those
galaxies are more than the speed of light in that mapping.

On the other hand, if you drew a small box just large enough
to encompass one lightcone, you could approximate that with a
Minkowski patch hence it is a box of spacetime in that sense.
Thus the choice of the worldline for the time axis is a global
preference but is not significant in a local sense.

&gt; The

&gt; around a gravitating body it is the gravitational potential that causes
&gt; spacetime it expand.  The only problem with Hubble expansion is that the
&gt; cause is aesthetic rather than scientific.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  I was making the
&gt;&gt; &gt; point that greater than light speed can be noted (as with my example
&gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; with the apparent speed of objects carried along with expanding
&gt;&gt; &gt; space-time)
&gt;&gt; &gt; without the speed of light actually being exceeded (as you most
&gt;&gt; &gt; correctly
&gt;&gt; &gt; noted above).

&gt;&gt; Indeed, but expansion of space _does_ result in recession
&gt;&gt; velocities in excess of c when you try to map to a 3D plus
&gt;&gt; time view.

It is necessary in all the standard models as you could
see from the earlier example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Objects are not moving inertially ie that are not moving

Only at relatively low speeds due to gravitational interactions
with other nearby galaxies, that is what is called proper motion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One can measure this inertial speed
&gt; in principle by comparing the motion of the object to the motion of
&gt; comoving
&gt; space debres, as there are always other objects in space.  If the object
&gt; under observation ios moving with respect to all other objects then we can
&gt; say that it motion is inertial, but if all objects in the area are moving
&gt; in
&gt; the same direction with approximately the same speed then we would
&gt; conclude
&gt; that the motion is not inertial.  If it is not inertial then the motion is
&gt; not apparant in a 3d space model.

Inertial has a fairly specific meaning but yes, you can
decompose the speed of any galaxy into a speed relative
to the mean of all its neighbours and that mean relative
to us.

&gt; The redshift will have the same cause as
&gt; that which cause the spacetime expansion in the first place.  For the
&gt; redshift of an object in the vacinity of a gravitasting body it is the
&gt; gravitational 'force' that causes the redshift in 3D+T.

&gt; In other words, in 3D+T, distant galaxies are not moving away from the
&gt; obsever.
">

No, that is incorrect. The gravitational redshift due to
a single galaxy is the same regardless of distance, it
depends on it mass and how deep within the galaxy the
light originated. The Hubble redshift is proportional to
distance and is additional to individual gravitational
redshift.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This was, however, the assumption in the early days (that galaxies
&gt; had inertial motion).

&gt;&gt; &gt; All you are doing in your trivial solution is to lower the density of
&gt;&gt; &gt; matter
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the volume.

&gt;&gt; That's right, just as cosmological expansion is reducing the
&gt;&gt; mean density of matter in the universe as clusters of galaxies
&gt;&gt; move apart.

&gt; This density theory requires a reference - or is this your own conclusion?
">

It is a common factor in all cosmologies and falls in all
the models I know about except the de Sitter model of an
empty universe, Einstein's original static model and the
old steady state model where new matter was created
continuously counteracting the thinning caused by expansion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is my understanding that earlier theory predicted that the density
&gt; would
&gt; fall with distance and so there should be fewer galaxies with larger
&gt; spatial
&gt; gaps between them as we peer deeper and deeper into space.  The voids were
&gt; thought to be a sign of just this.  But Hubble was pointed into the voids
&gt; for a deep space probe and found that no only were they teeming with
&gt; objects, but the density of objects was no different to what it is
&gt; locally.

I don't know which earlier model you are thinking of. It is
poosible to form a non-homogenous model which is spherically
symmetric, basically a ball of stars in an empty universe,
but I don't think that has been seen as a realistic model
since GR.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Note that the only matter visible at ever greater distances is stars,
&gt; galaxies and then blusterers of galaxies.  The density of these objects
&gt; should decrease along with the spatial expansion.  There is no evidence

&gt; this actually happens.

&gt; In fact one would expect spacetime to be more compact at greater
&gt; distances.
&gt; But it isn't - there is more of it.

It should decrease as time progresses but looking at greater
distances you look back to the past and expect higher densities
and there is some evidence for that. Be careful though because
often papers discuss co-moving volumes so normalise out the
effects of scale factor.
