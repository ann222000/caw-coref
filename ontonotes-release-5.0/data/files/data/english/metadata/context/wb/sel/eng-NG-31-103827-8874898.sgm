Web 2.0 - or is it more like Web 16.0?

With people generating many new phrases and terms in modern
technology, it has become hard to keep up with what they all
mean. One of the most commonly used terms on the world wide web
(www) today is the phrase &quot;Web2.0&quot;.

It seems like every web solutions company trying to make a living
is selling their stuff off the phrase. So to the average Joe who
is not a geek, what is &quot;Web2.0&quot;?

Well according to Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia...

The phrase Web2.0 refers to a perceived second generation of
web-based communities and hosted services - such as
social-networking sites, wikis and folksonomies - which aim to
facilitate collaboration and sharing between users. The term
became popular following the first O'Reilly Media Web 2.0
conference in 2004, and has since become widely adopted as
shorthand for user generated content shared with other users.

Although the term suggests a new version of the World Wide Web
(www), it does not refer to an update to Web technical
specifications, but to changes in the ways software developers
and end-users use and interact with the web as a platform.
According to Tim O'Reilly, &quot;Web2.0 is the business revolution
in the computer industry caused by the move to the internet as
platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on
that new platform.&quot;

Some technology experts, notably Tim Berners-Lee, have questioned
whether one can use the term in a meaningful way, since many of
the Technology components of &quot;Web2.0&quot; have existed since the
early days of the Web.&quot;

There is no doubt the www has advanced significantly since
inception and it seems every year the advancements outstrip the
sum total of all the previous years put together.

The point to note is there really is no new version of the www.
It is simply that it is now much more useful and usable to the
everyday person. As offerings are developed, various players try,
buy and dump what works less well, a Darwinian of what works,
works. You will often read and hear about an &quot;amazing wave of
technology and innovation on the web&quot; which is usually more
marketing than meaningful changes.

In reality more and more people are finding the www to be an
increasingly reliable and useful tool in their work and everyday
life needs.

There has been a large volume of banter and amazement at this new
flood of 'amazing' innovation, especially so since almost all
of the technology supposedly &quot;driving the Web2.0 revolution&quot;
has been around for a while. Maybe the most significant change is
increasing bandwidth and anywhere access.

So why do people think all of this technology is brand new? And
why are we calling it Web2.0 when realistically if we counted
each major innovation as a number and each minor revision as a
sub-number we are already into double digits.

If you have seen the latest Die Hard movie, or even bought
software for your computer, you will understand why we are not in
the Web2.0 revolution, Like Die Hard 4.0 and MS Office 2007 they
are all still the same movie or tool you used before only they
are the latest version. What we are really experiencing now on
the www is something more like Web16.0.

And if you manage to get into an in-depth, honest conversation
with your web designer then they will tell you that Web2.0 is a
myth. So to explain how we get to Web16.0 we have compiled a
history of the most significant events in the history of the
www.

WEB 0.1 ----- 1958 - SAGE - Radar systems are first networked
WEB 0.2 ----- 1960 - Packet Switching is first created

WEB 1.0 - EMAIL - &quot;A New Way to Send Unsolicited Mail Is Born&quot;

Although the exact history of E-Mail is a tad murky, it is
generally accepted that it appeared in 1965, and was created so
that people accessing a mainframe could communicate with each
other. This was the first step in the interconnection of people,
and also facilitated almost instant communication at no cost to
the user.

WEB 1.1 ----- 1967 - Markup - Markup language is created &lt;/end&gt;
WEB 1.2 ----- 1969 - ARPA - A link is established between
computers
WEB 1.3 ----- 1696 - ARPA Net - First packet switched network
created

WEB 2.0 - WYSIWYG: &quot;What You See Is What You Get (sometimes)&quot;

With the invention of WYSIWYG in 1970, users could now be
presented with a basic display of what their finished product
would look like, as they were working on it. This removed the
need to memorize complex code, much in the same way you need to
know code to create a web-page.

WEB 2.1 ----- 1970 - ASP - First Application Service Provider
(SAAS)
WEB 2.2 ----- 1970 - Style sheets are created
WEB 2.3 ----- 1971 - @ is created to separate hosts and users
WEB 2.4 ----- 1973 - TCP/IP is created to simplify networking.
This is probably the real starting point.
WEB 2.5 ----- 1973 - First connection to another country
established
WEB 2.6 ----- 1974 - The term &quot;Internet&quot; is adopted
WEB 2.7 ----- 1976 - X.25 - The first network standard is
approved
WEB 2.8 ----- 1978 - International packet switching service
created

WEB 3.0 - USENET: &quot;The Black Market of the Internet&quot;

Usenet was established in 1980 to offer mail and file transfers
as well as give personal users access to news. Usenet is in fact
a large network of servers all in communication with each other,
a user posts something to the local server and that item is sent
to the other servers and passed along in a giant network. Usenet
was a major turning point because now users can have an open
conversation with anyone on the net, as opposed to having to
specifically know the user (unlike E-Mail). The downside is that
with a sometimes un-policed net capable of file transfers, the
Usenet of today is a haven for piracy of all types, where
anything you can imagine is accessible.

WEB 3.1 ----- 1979 - Email is made available to personal computer
users, millions of Nigerian Princes suddenly need public help

WEB 4.0 - REAL TIME CHAT - Going Outside Deemed &quot;Obsolete&quot;

Real-Time Chat was created in 1980 following users' frustrations
with Usenet articles taking sometimes 24 hours to be updated.
This signalled a turning point whereby online conversations
became instant, albeit isolated into segregated groups.

WEB 4.1 ----- 1980 - First ISP's created providing dialup
internet
WEB 4.2 ----- 1981 - TCP/IP becomes a standard
WEB 4.3 ----- 1981 - US/Europe/Canada/Hong-Kong/Australia
Connect
WEB 4.4 ----- 1983 - TCP/IP becomes the only standard
WEB 4.5 ----- 1983 - First wide area network using TCP/IP
operational
WEB 4.6 ----- 1985 - FTP - The File Transfer Protocol is created
WEB 4.7 ----- 1988 - IRC - Internet Relay Chat is created
WEB 4.8 ----- 1988 - Bulletin Board Systems and Forums created

WEB 5.0 - HTML/HTTP/Web-Pages - &quot;It Has Begun&quot;

Around 1980 there were many researchers using the internet, but
no single way to create/display &quot;documents&quot; (web-pages). A
physicist Tim burners-Lee and his colleagues needed a simple
system for creating/displaying &quot;documents&quot; (web-pages) but
found that they were too commercial, platform-specific or
complicated for the average user.
So they created their own relatively simple system consisting of
browsing software called &quot;WorldWideWeb&quot;, a protocol for
transmitting the information (HTTP) and a document annotation
convention &quot;HyperText Markup Language&quot; (HTML). This meant
anyone could now create web-pages using a simple language for
page creation.

WEB 5.1 ----- 1989 - Images can now be animated, Oh the horror!
WEB 5.2 ----- 1990 - The network now covers the entire world
(publicly)

WEB 6.0 - Search - &quot;Did You Mean: Google&quot;

Before search engines were created there was no way to find a
page, you had to specifically know the location. With the advent
of search engines in 1990 you could now search within a directory
if you could provide the directory location. Around 1991 search
engines begun indexing (storing) the content they found, giving
users the ability to search for pages even if they didn't know
the page's location.

WEB 6.1 ----- 1991 - DNS - A Dynamic Naming System is created
WEB 6.2 ----- 1991 - The first text-based browser is created

WEB 7.0 - DHTML - &quot;Because Non-Scrolling Text Is Boring&quot;

The web was static until Dynamic HTML (DHTML) was created. DHTML
introduced client-side scripting, allowing authors to include
code in their web-pages that performed an action upon being
downloaded onto a user's computer, introducing rollover buttons
and drop-down menus on web-pages. DHTML is an extremely broad
concept, and encompasses any web-page that is generated
differently for each user, it goes a long way to making the web
more personalized.

WEB 7.1 ----- 1993 - The first graphics based browsers are
created
WEB 7.2 ----- 1993 - Screen casts are first created
WEB 7.3 ----- 1994 - Wiki's are created, Britannica begins
holding breath
WEB 7.4 ----- 1994 - The world-wide web consortium is formed
WEB 7.5 ----- 1994 - CSS - Cascading Style Sheets created

WEB 8.0 - ONLINE DIARIES - -Teens Reportedly Misunderstood&quot;

Online diaries were first created in 1994 as a means for people
to store their diaries online for personal or public reading. As
other diarists discovered each other, a web-ring was set up to
link them together and eventually a community web-site was setup
and began giving &quot;Diarist Awards&quot; quarterly. Writers could now
reach almost anyone worldwide at practically no cost, and
everyone can create an editorial on whatever subject they like,
without fear of censorship.
WEB 8.1 ----- 1996 - The first social bookmarking site created

WEB 9.0 - RANKED RESULTS - &quot;The Online Popularity Contest&quot;

Search engine results helped find things, but many of the results
were useless or had nothing to do with the keywords you had used.
As of 1996 search results started to be ranked based on a
multitude of things, like how popular a page is. This made
searching faster and easier, and significantly less painful.

WEB 9.1 ----- 1996 - Flash is created, whole websites can now be
animated
WEB 9.2 ----- 1997 - The term &quot;Blog&quot; is adopted

WEB 10.0 - HIRED BLOGGERS - &quot;Wow Isn't Product X Great!&quot;

As of 1997 personal diaries began to evolve to what became known
as &quot;blogs.&quot; Many corporate websites and personal homepages had
(and still do have) news sections, these were traditionally
manually updated in a back-end system. With the advent of blogs,
tools had evolved to facilitate the production and maintenance of
web articles, and the commercial sector jumped on, seeing blogs
as a new marketing medium.

WEB 10.1 ----- 1998 - The first Audio news site is created
WEB 10.2 ----- 1999 - The first web-based operating system is
created

WEB 11.0 - RSS - -Newspapers Deemed Obsolete&quot;

Really Simple Syndication (RSS) was created due to the lack of a
feed format that was universal. The creation of RSS means that
users can now &quot;subscribe&quot; to feeds containing video, audio,
text, or graphics. Users no longer have to trawl the web for new
information, they can &quot;subscribe&quot; to a feed and have it sent to
them directly, tailoring the news they read to the content they
enjoy.

WEB 12.0 - REMOTE SCRIPTING - &quot;Waiting For 4 Seconds Now
History!&quot;

Remote scripting allows scripts running inside a browser to
exchange information with a server, so that scripts can be
triggered locally, processed remotely and have information
returned directly to the browser, requiring no refresh. This
makes the web faster and easier to use, and removes the need to
refresh the page to do simple things like sorting.
WEB 12.1 ----- 2001 - Blogs evolve from online diaries

WEB 13.0 - PODCASTING - &quot;Now Everyone Can Not Listen To You by
Choice not Circumstance!&quot;

Podcasting originated as a portmanteau of the iPod- and
broadcast, though it has become widely accepted that the term
means &quot;portable on demand broadcast.&quot; Originally podcasting was
created to allow individuals to distribute their own radio shows.
But it has become popular for a wide variety of things, from
distribution of educational materials, to the latest gaming news.
Podcasting opens up distribution of audio content to anyone with
a server, with users &quot;subscribing&quot; the RSS feed's that appeal
to them.

WEB 13.1 ----- 2002 - Folksonomy is created, giving rise to
&quot;Tags&quot;

WEB 14.0 - VIDEO PODCASTING - &quot;Web-Based One-Sided
Conversations&quot;

Shortly after Podcasting became popular, video Podcasting was
created as a means to send the equivalent of TV episodes to
users, though similarly to podcasting, the content was not
limited to just &quot;TV episodes&quot;. Video Podcasting opens up the
video medium so that making a TV show is not possible for
anyone.

WEB 15.0 - VOIP - &quot;High Tech, Dodgy Sounding Free Calls&quot;

With the Voice over Internet Protocol (IP) instead of using a
traditional phone line to send audio, the audio is sent over the
internet. This removes almost all cost involved, and also removes
the need to have a physical phone line to plug into. What this
means for consumers is calling becomes much simpler, easier and
significantly cheaper.

WEB 16.0 - SAAS - &quot;The Industry Makes a SaaS of Itself.&quot;

Software as a Service (SaaS) is in-fact just a new term for a
concept that has been around since the dawn of the internet (ASP
from 1970). &quot;Software as a Service&quot; is the concept of using a
piece of software run/provided through the internet, and instead
of paying a large one-off purchase price, you &quot;rent&quot; the
software for as long as needed. So whilst &quot;SaaS&quot; is the
buzzword of the day, the concept is decades old.

...The CONCLUSION?

So if you follow the basic rule that each total upgrade is a new
&quot;.0&quot; then we are nowhere near Web2.0. The story is really one
of falling price, increasing reliability and bandwidth coupled
with ubiquitous access.

We have made significant strides in technology, and chalking
these up as a recent affair is both factually incorrect as well
as just plain rude to the original inventors. But then why is
&quot;Web2.0&quot; used on an almost daily basis when describing the
latest venture Google has gotten into, or a new &quot;simple
looking&quot; piece of software released by an unknown Swedish
developer?

Simply put, &quot;Web2.0&quot; is just shorthand for the development
process outlined above. Bottom line, the web really becoming what
the web really always should have been.

The web, once seen as a commercial gains-platform, is now seen as
more user driven. The rules are different, there is a need to
figure out new web ways. Consumers have jumped on and realized
that the playing field has levelled, a 15 year old blogger can
reach as many people in the world as a famous BBC journalist.

Users are customers, the guiding principles &quot;look after the
users&quot; and &quot;make it appealing to the eye&quot;. We don't need
newspaper editors to tell us what the news is, we read our news
with all the content tailored to our tastes, we listen to music
not by artist, but instead based on the &quot;tags&quot; that we have
come to know and love.

Call it what you will, the web is the power of difference,
everyone can have a say but nobody need listen - it's scary,
irreverent, anarchistic and fun!
