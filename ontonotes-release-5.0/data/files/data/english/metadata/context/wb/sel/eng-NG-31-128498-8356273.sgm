My very liberal priest from our old church downtown (Holy Cross) is blogging
his homilies (sermons) and I'm still getting them. I thought youguys might
appreciate this one as it's so incredibly open minded and different from the
stereotypical Catholic priest. Wooglet would appreciate his view of the
scripture &quot;People from the east and west and from the north and south&quot;
meaning people of all religions will be seated with God in the end.

I think I may have mentioned that Fr. spent some time as a state legislator.
Anyone care to guess what party he ran under?

Today's readings at Mass contain several images that are important and yet
seem to conflict. I'd like to &quot;throw them out&quot; to you.

&quot;Strive to enter through the narrow gate.&quot; Scriptures are full of concern
for the right way to worship, the right way to live, the right belief. How
you worship, how you believe, how you live are all very important and are
often described as a narrow path which we must strive to walk.

Scriptures are also full of stories and images and possibilities that warn
us that there are many who consider themselves &quot;slam dunk&quot; candidates for
salvation who will find themselves on the outside looking in. Didn't we go
to Mass every Sunday? Didn't we believe the right things? Didn't we say all
the right words? Didn't we do good works? And still the door is shut.

Scriptures are also filled with promises of the universality of salvation.
&quot;People will come from the east ad the west and from the north and the south
and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.&quot; I believe there will be
Christians of all varieties of belief, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus,
atheists and all sorts at the table. God's call and desire for salvation is
universal.

So how do we combine all these things? When I was in grade school, &quot;Sister&quot;
said we should work as if everything depended on us and pray as if
everything depended on God. St. John Eudes said: &quot;It is not that we should
make no use of the things I have mentioned, and bring to our aid everything
we can to help us overcome our faults, practice virtue, manage and carry out
the work God has put into our hands, and fulfill the duties of our station
in life. But we must give up all idea of expecting support from these
things, and all the confidence we might have in them, and rely entirely on
the goodness of our Lord. For our part, therefore, we should take as much
care and work as hard as if we expected nothing from God: and yet we should
rely no more upon our own care and work than if we had done nothing at all,
but look for everything solely from the mercy of God.

He is awesome. All he cares about is spreading love and teaching people to
love. I guess he has really embraced programs at the women's prison which is
in their parish boundaries.

I never asked what was wrong with his speech? Did he have damage to his
vocal cords (sp?) at one point or something?

Shortly after leaving Holy Name, he caught a virus which started out as a
sore throat.  The virus paralyzed him and nearly killed him.  It took him a
while to speak again. :(

I always loved his masses because he was sing the mass.  I don't if he's
able to do that anymore.  I cried when he left Holy Name.  He's a fabulous
guy!
