No. 1 mistake was not signing top pick quickly

Nancy Gay

Sunday, September 9, 2007

Some readers may not buy this, but the job of covering a losing or
dysfunctional sports team is a lot like buckling yourself into the
seat of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride: You know you're setting yourself up for
a dark journey to nowhere. It's kind of thrilling. And it's not always
fun.

Everybody likes a winner: owners, front office personnel, coaches,
players, media and fans. Winning makes everyone happy and relaxed.
It's more enjoyable covering a winning franchise. Losing, especially
extended stretches of calamity, makes everyone bitter and tense.

So there has been no particular glee in watching the Raiders thrash
about the past few months with the agents for top draft pick JaMarcus
Russell. Just when you thought the organization was poised to retool
and bring in an exceptional athlete who could change the fortunes of
the franchise - does Vince Young ring a bell? - a crippling contract
impasse doused the excitement.

Despite fielding the NFL's third-ranked defense last season, the
Raiders' 2-14 record gave them the rights to the No. 1 player in the
2007 draft. In their estimation, Russell - the strong-armed,
playmaking, promising quarterback from LSU - was that player.

Russell generated positive buzz in minicamps and organized team
activities. His arm strength was praised, his attitude was good. He
was figuring out the playbook and learning about his teammates.

Had Russell been under contract and on the field in Napa when training
camp opened in late July, you wonder how many more season ducats the
Raiders' marketing and ticket services departments might have sold.

Probably quite a few. The days of the embarrassing television blackout
might have finally been over.

The fact that today's 1:15 p.m. game at the Coliseum was declared a
sellout is a testament to the Raiders' commitment to push tickets, and
their fans' belief - with the record sitting innocently at 0-0 - that
rookie coach Lane Kiffin is on the right track.

If Russell were in uniform on the sideline today, there would likely
be no quarterback cloak-and-dagger histrionics hovering over the
regular-season opener against the Lions.

Not that Russell would have been the starter. No way. But had he been
in camp on time, the Raiders might not have felt compelled to gamble
$3.2 million on out-of-work free agent Daunte Culpepper as a temporary
patch.

It's possible all the training camp snaps and focus would have
centered on Josh McCown as starter, Andrew Walter as backup and
Russell as the franchise-in-waiting.

Culpepper may remind Al Davis of Jim Plunkett - ready for reclamation
- and he appears to have earned the support of his new teammates. But
there is something about &quot;The Pepper&quot; - either he came in too late and
isn't fully up to speed on the offense, or there is some other flaw we
don't know about - that prevented Kiffin from outright naming him the
starting quarterback over McCown.

Each quarterback had 47 pass attempts in the exhibition season.
Culpepper completed 26, McCown 24. McCown is alleged to be the more
mobile quarterback of the two, a plus given the still unsettled state
of the Raiders' improved offensive line.

Yet McCown was sacked three times for 15 yards; Culpepper was sacked
twice for nine yards.

Then there is this: The Pepper tossed four touchdowns, along with an
interception. McCown was 0-for-0 on both.

Kiffin did not want to publicly name any starting quarterback this
week, which is a little strange in the realm of the NFL but not
extraordinary. Kiffin's recent background is at the college level,
where depth chart moves aren't always advertised. And Kiffin is now
the face of the most cryptic organization in professional sports,
where truth and honesty often become blurred in the &quot;Just Win Baby&quot;
mentality.

So we head into today's kickoff wondering who will be the No. 1
quarterback, Culpepper or McCown (who took all the first-team snaps in
practice), and which player will be the starting center, incumbent
Jake Grove or experienced veteran free agent Jeremy Newberry. When you
know who your quarterback will be, you usually know who will be
snapping him the ball.

Wouldn't it have been a lot more reassuring if these important issues
were settled long ago in training camp? The effort required to vault
from 2-14 to a .500 record or better already is challenging enough.
Who needs this drama?

Nobody.

The Raiders and Russell, by failing to get their business settled in a
reasonable, timely manner, owe their followers better than that.

This isn't fun, at all. It's unnecessary.
