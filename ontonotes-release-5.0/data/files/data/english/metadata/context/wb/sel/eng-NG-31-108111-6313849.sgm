I finally had a chance to try out the eye game with Harriet.  Oh.
My.  God.

It took about four or five repetitions for her to get the idea that
eye contact = treat.  Then, I started tossing the kibble in random
places instead of right at her, but still in front of me.  We did
that 5-6 times, and she was very good at returning to sit in front
of me and finding my eyes.  Then I started tossing the kibble over
my shoulder.  There is an old chunk of mirror on the floor at the
end of the room, so I was able to watch in it to see what she was
doing back there.  She was staring very intently at my head,
sitting.  Then she tried downing, still staring at the back of my
head.  After awhile, I decided we'd be there all night, so I
stepped backwards, into her, to force her to move.  She jumped
around me, landed in front of me, and found my eyes.

This is where clumsiness of handler is a handicap.  I had a hard
time tossing the treats behind me without turning around and
looking.  I made a few goof-ups that I'm sure slowed her down.
However, she did pretty well, I thought.  After she got the idea
that she had to come *around* me, I started moving in a circle.  I
was *amazed* that she caught on immediately, and moved right with
me, with eyes locked on mine.  This was turning clockwise.  I
switched to counter clockwise, and her brane started to melt down.
Since I was moving into her, and not away, she boinked up in the
air a couple of times.  She did figure it out, but it was more
difficult for her.  I decided to stop (on a high note!) because I
wanted to make sure to end before she'd totally lost her brane.

Not bad, I think, considering who she has to work with.  I was
amazed at how patient she was when she first was behind me.  I
would have sworn she'd have thrown some sort of hissy fit, but she
was very collected.  *Intense* but collected.  I'm also impressed
at how quickly she initially figured out eye contact = treat.

Also, I didn't use stinky treats or anything--just plain ol'
kibble.  Treats are kind of overkill for Harriet.  She's plenty
motivated by kibble, and treats just make her so keyed up that she
loses control of her brane.

Harder than you think, isn't it?

Good training choice!

I'm finding this with Cala too. It's easy for her to move to my left,
toward heel position. It's hard for her to move to my right, away from
heel position. And I don't think she *really* gets that she has to
solicit eye contact yet. But we're getting there. She seems to start
cold then "get it," and when she's getting it it's fun, because then I
can just stop and move her with my eyes, without moving my body. Right
now I still need to move my head though.

It is!  But watching the light bulb go off in Harriet's head was
beautiful.

That's the next step, though I think there will be quite a bit of
restarting at square one.  That's okay.  It's a *very* fun game to
play while doling out the lunch and dinner kibble.

One thing I'm having trouble with--and this is a good example of
why working *with* someone is an advantage--is not turning my head
and looking for Harriet's eyes.  Duh!  But I keep finding myself
doing it, and have to mentally smack myself for it.  It's also
difficult for me to tell when she's found my eyes without cheating
and moving them to her.

I found myself having exactly the same problem.

It caused me to realize I was MUCH farther away from accomplishing this
than I had thought. So, I'm starting the focus exercises from scratch
and having Annie hold *eye contact* for 3 seconds if there are no
distractions, one or two if we're on the street or on an elevator. For
that part, she doesn't have to fully seek it since I am looking at her,
and she just has to bring her focus to my own eyes that are already
there. Cuz, yeah....it turned out that if I didn't cheat for her, it
didn't happen. I took that as a clear sign that she wasn't ready and
that I had to be much more specific about what the actual starting
criteria was.

I was going to clarify this with Robin as well (I couldn't find the
actual exercise she's doing with Cala on Sue's Watch page), but my
assumption is that I would *know* that Annie got it right specifically
*because* I wouldn't have to look towards her to see if she got it
right: if she got it right, she'd be staring directly into my pupils,
and I'd be (by definition) staring back. But I'm nowhere near getting
this with Little Miss yet, so I'd be curious about the specifics of
that.

Also, I was curious about how to go about making *certain* you don't
move your eyes. Do you stare at a specific spot on the ground and wait
for the dog to enter that field of vision and meet your eyes there? Or
is it more of a soft focus thing?

For this particular exercise (and not, it's not specified on Sue's
site), the dog should move directly into your area and seem focused
upward, then you can move your eyes to see if the dog is truly looking
at you. I think it's getting the dog to "lock on." Later, of course, you
do want the dog to keep looking at you even when you look away, but at
first the game is to find your eyes, lock on, and get rewarded.

Sue does associate the word command of "Watch" with this.

For me it's looking ahead, soft focus. When Cala was having a difficult
time once, I actually took both hands and cupped them by my eyes so she
*couldn't* see my eyes unless she moved in front of me.
