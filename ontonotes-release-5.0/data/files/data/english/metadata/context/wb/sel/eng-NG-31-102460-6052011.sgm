Illegal War spells MURDER INC.

The TRUTH is NOT WANTED
Fighting the Cultural War in America
by Charlton Heston
---------------------------------
I was astounded to read these courageous remarks by Charlton Heston.  I am thankful to hear a man with such high esteem say essentially the same things for which I have been reviled by the liberal media. His words should be reproduced and put into the hands of every American.

---------------------------------
Actor Charlton Heston, born October 4, 1924, was one of some performing artists who received the Kennedy Center honors on December 6, 1997. Mr. Heston remained in Washington D.C. and addressed the 20th Anniversary of the Free Congress Foundation and the 4th Birthday of the NET TV network. The following are excerpts from his Insightful remarks. Mr. Heston and Mrs. Heston celebrated 50 years of marriage in 1994.

A cultural war is raging across our land-storming our values, assaulting our freedoms, killing our self-confidence in who we are and what we believe. (Mr. Heston then asked those present who owned a gun to raise their hand.)

I wonder how many of you own guns but chose not to raise your hand? How many of you considered revealing your conviction about a constitutional right, but then though better of it?

If so, you are a victim of the culture war being waged against traditional American freedom of beliefs and ideas. You have been assaulted and robbed of the courage of your convictions. Your pride in who you are and what you believe in has been ridiculed, ransacked, and plundered! It may be a war without a bullet or bloodshed, but with just as much liberty lost: You and your country are less free!

Because you choose to own guns- affirmed by no less than the Bill of Rights- you embrace a view at odds with the cultural war lords. If that is the outcome of cultural war, and you are the victims, I can only ask the obvious question. What will become of the right itself? Or other rights not deemed acceptable by the thought police? What other truth in your heart will you disavow with your hand?

Rank-and-file Americans wake up every morning, increasingly bewildered and confused at why their views make them lesser citizens. The message gets through; Heaven help the God fearing, law-abiding, Caucasian, middle- class Protestant-or even worse, evangelical Christian, Midwestern or Southern- or even worse, rural, apparently straight-or even worse, admitted heterosexuals, gun-owing-or even worse, NRA-card-carrying, average working stiff-or even worse, male working stiff-because, not only don't you count, you are a down-right obstacle to social progress. Your voice deserves a lower decibel level, your opinion is less enlightened, your media access is insignificant, and frankly, mister, you need to wake up, wise up, and learn a little something from your new-America and until you do, would you mind shutting up?

That is why you didn't raise your hand. That's how cultural war works. That's what happens when a generation of media, educators, entertainers, and politicians- led by a willing President-decide the America they were born into isn't good enough anymore. So, they contrive to change it through cultural warfare of class distinction! Ask the Romans if powerful nations have ever fallen as a result of cultural division. There are ruins around the world that were once the smug centers of small-minded, arrogant elitism. It appears that, rather than evaporate in the flash of a split atom, we may succumb to a divided culture!

The Constitution was handed down to guide us by a bunch of wise old dead white guys who invented our country! Now some flinch when I say that. Why! Its true-they were white guys! So were most of the guys that died in Lincoln's name opposing slavery in the 1860's. So why should I be ashamed of white guys? Why is "Hispanic Pride" or "Black Pride" a good thing, while "White Pride" conjures shaven heads and white hoods? Why was the Million Man March on Washington celebrated by many as progress, while the Promise Keepers March on Washington was greeted with suspicion and ridicule? I'll tell you why, Cultural warfare!

You don't see other Hollywood luminaries speaking out on this do you? Its not because there aren't any. Its because they can't afford the heat! They dare not speak for fear of CNN or the IRS or the SAG or NBC! It saps the strength of our country when the personal price is simply too high to stand for what you believe in. Today, speaking with the courage of your convictions can be costly, the price of principal can be so high that legislators won't lead and citizens can't follow, and so there is no arm to fight back. That's cultural warfare!

Mainstream America is counting on you to "draw your sword" and fight for them. These people have precious little time and resources to battle misguided Cinderella attitudes, the fringe propaganda of the homosexual coalition, the feminists who preach that it is a divine duty for woman to hate men, blacks who raise a militant fist with one hand while they seek preference with the other, New Age apologists for juvenile crime who see roving gangs as a means to only the merchandising violence as a form of entertainment for impressionable minds, and gun bans as a means to only the Lord-knows-what. We have reached that point in time when our social policy originates on Oprah. Its time to pull the plug!

“This engagement for Hawaiian Telcom is not only a testament to BearingPoint’s ability to build and operate systems for clients,” said Scott Parr, Senior Vice President of BearingPoint’s Commercial Services sector. “It also shows that progressive-thinking telecommunications firms are willing to undertake new strategic initiatives if clear returns can be delivered to the business.”

HOW MANY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS DOES One Billion Buy ?

Waxman to Bremer: Show Me the Money

Washington Dispatch: The CPA handed out planeloads of cash but no one knows where it went.
By Daniel Schulman
February 6, 2007

Depending on who you ask, today's hearing by Henry Waxman's Committee on Government Reform, convened to examine the Coalition Provisional Authority's handling of reconstruction funding in Iraq, was either a demonstration of aggressive oversight or a shameless exercise in political grandstanding. The minority side of the committee, whose ranks were thinly represented, seemed to regard the proceedings as the latter, characterizing the hearing, variously, as a "blame meeting" (Dan Burton), "Monday morning quarterbacking" (Mark Souder), and an attempt to "discredit the president" (John Mica). "Self-righteous finger wagging and political scapegoating won't make Iraq any more secure," cautioned Tom Davis, the Virginia Republican who previously chaired the committee. While the impetus for the hearing was a point of contention, there was one thing everyone could agree on regardless of their political persuasion: No one — not the committee members or the distinguished panel
assembled to testify — had any idea how billions of dollars in reconstruction funds were ultimately spent.

Shipped to Iraq by the ton on C-130 cargo planes laden with bricks of U.S. tender, the funding in question, held in the Development Fund for Iraq and totaling some $8.8 billion, was doled out by the CPA to Iraq’s fledgling government ministries between October 2003 and June 2004. Ostensibly, the cash went to pay for such things as salaries and overhead. Where it actually wound up is another story entirely. A 2005 audit by the Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that the "CPA did not exercise adequate responsibility over DFI funds provided to Iraqi ministries through the national budget process" and sought no "assurance the monies were properly used or accounted for." The report raised the possibility that portions of the funding went to so-called ghost employees (whose only job responsibility would appear to be collecting a paycheck). It noted that though one Iraqi ministry had 8,206 on the payroll, CPA officials could confirm that only 602 of them actually
worked there. Today, Waxman raised another, more ominous possibility — that reconstruction funding may have wound up in the hands of insurgents and other militant factions.

OR WORSE says JW

American Political Operatives
WE STEAL ELECTIONS Inc.

The man ultimately responsible for overseeing the disbursement of the funds (money belonging to Iraqi citizens, not U.S. taxpayers) was L. Paul Bremer III, the U.S. envoy dispatched to head the CPA in May 2003. Testifying before Congress today for the first time since he left that post in June 2004, Bremer acknowledged mistakes while also describing a dire situation in Iraq where sound financial management was next to impossible. When he arrived, Bremer said, Baghdad was literally "burning." "The country was in chaos — socially, politically, and economically. The deep crisis had been brought about not by war, not by sanctions, but by the decades'-long corruption and incompetence of Saddam's regime." Unemployment, he said, was over 50 percent and the country's already primitive banking system had effectively shut down. The imperative, as he saw it, was to "get money into the hands of the Iraqi people as quickly as possible." Under the circumstances, he said, "we met our
obligations."

Seated directly to Bremer's left was Stuart Bowen Jr., a former White House official who, during his more than two-year tenure as the inspector general for reconstruction, has earned a reputation as a hard-nosed investigator. Since 2004, when he was appointed to the post, Bowen's office has issued a series of withering reports exposing the fraud and abuse of reconstruction funds. (Most recently, Bowen's office was responsible for the successful prosecution of former CPA comptroller Robert Stein, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in January for his role in a massive fraud scheme.) "There was a lack of accountability," Bowen told the committee, "and that's the ultimate conclusion here." Asked by Davis how he would have administered the reconstruction funding had he been in Bremer's shoes, he responded, "I would have required some reporting from each ministry about how the money was being used." The chaotic situation in Baghdad, Bowen added, called for "for more
oversight... not less."

Though Bremer was supposedly the one in the hot seat, it was Bowen who frequently found himself on the receiving end of pointed questioning, as Republican committee members sought to hammer home the point, which Bowen readily acknowledged, that his audit had not uncovered outright fraud. This reached a crescendo when Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican, angrily accused Bowen's office of "relying on second and third hand information" and of failing to investigate how the reconstruction funds had actually been spent by the ministries. To this criticism Bowen calmly explained that the point of the audit was to investigate the CPA's financial and managerial controls, not those of the Iraqi ministries. An exasperated Burton shot back: "You ought to be a politician!"

While Republicans hammered Bowen, Democrats set their sights on Bremer and David Oliver, once the CPA's director of management and budget. At one point, Diane Watson, the California Democrat, replayed comments Oliver made to the BBC in November, in which he expresses indifference over how the reconstruction funds were spent. "I have no idea, I can't tell you whether or not the money went to the right things or didn't — nor do I actually think it is important," he says on the recording. "Billions of dollars of their money disappeared, yes I understand, I'm saying what difference does it make?"

"Do you stand by these statements today?" Watson asked.

Apparently measuring his words more carefully this time, Oliver replied, "…We decided the best way to make sure we could withdraw as quickly as possible and for the safety of the troops was to rely upon the Iraqi system to distribute that money. Therefore, we made sure that it was transparent what we were doing with the money to the ministries and then relied upon the ministries’ system, the entire financial system they had, to do that."

During what seemed to be a particularly uncomfortable moment for Bremer, he was asked about NorthStar Consultants, the firm that received a $1.4 million CPA contract to evaluate the management of the Development Fund for Iraq. The firm’s consultants, Bowen’s office later reported, "were not certified public accountants and did not perform a review of internal controls as required by the contract. Consequently, internal controls over DFI disbursements to and from Iraqi ministries were not evaluated." To emphasize the company’s shoddy operations and the CPA’s negligence in relying on them, Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat, displayed a photograph of NorthStar’s California headquarters, a ramshackle looking home outside of San Diego. Fortunately for Bremer, Darrell Issa, the California Republican, soon came to his rescue. Asking that the picture remain up on a screen, he remarked that Congress "has encouraged telecommuting" and small businesses "run out of homes very
similar to that."

A LITTLE HISTORY LESSON FIRST

Every Arizona County and hundreds of thousands of trusting land purchasers were victimized by the rampant land scams of the 1960’s. Artist renditions showed trees and lakes with boating and all the modern facilities: streets, street lights, golf courses, a real piece of the American dream. The true picture was a section of dry Arizona deserts with no development whatsoever. Although Arizona has the reputation of being the worst in the nation, Florida was not far behind and many states had similar swindles take place during the same time period.....

Land fraud, bankruptcy, murder, suicide, incarceration and greed surround the history of Cochise College Park subdivision. Located in Cochise County, consisting of 2 phases of 12 units totaling 8,647 lots, it was the worst fraud in the states and possibly the Nation. The scenic lake at Cochise College Park was filled several times but never would hold water. They sold lots throughout the Midwest, Florida, Canada, across the United States and around the world. Some lots were sold twice. Some mortgages were sold twice. Many documents remain unrecorded today. Some owners never received their deed. Some received deeds but never received satisfaction of their mortgage. Some paid mortgages in full and received satisfaction of the mortgage only to learn the mortgage was sold and the second sale never recorded. The original mortgage is still on record at the County Recorder’s office. They paid on an unrecorded mortgage. This story was repeated in various degrees across the State
creating tangled subdivisions with many unbuildable lots.....

The U.S. Land Fraud Crisis

Scarred by the Savings and Loan Crisis of the late 1980's and get rich quick artists, greed is abundant in America’s real estate markets. Real estate prices in some of America’s strongest markets have seen land prices increase as much as 300 to 400 percent and even higher in many places in the last three years. Now nearly frozen, the Nation’s land market is slowly starting to show its ugly head. A major U.S. Land Fraud Crisis has resulted, which has the potential to cost hundreds of thousands of investors millions of dollars in losses, if not more.

California probes title insurance kickback scheme

Insurance commissioner subpoenas suspected companies
Wednesday, February 23, 2005

Federal lending guidelines strictly prohibit lending on a piece of property less than one year before its last sale on property, which is federally insured. The majority of mortgages are federally insured. The practice of selling land before the one-year period became common. A massive land frenzy resulted. Flipping land as quickly as possible to the next buyer under the one year limit triggered the end of a nearly run away land sales market.

At least one of the causes of the crisis appears to be a hole in the lending system itself. Many lenders make loans on property without even checking to see when the property was last sold.

A sampling of real estate land recordings in 5 Sunbelt states shows land closings over the past two years to be up an average of more than 200% with recorded prices increasing at more than an estimated 40% to 60% on average per closed transaction.

It is reminiscent of the old pyramid scheme selling the land from one buyer to another until fortune finally evades the last owner. In many cases the last buyer to make the purchase is left "holding the bag." But in this case the bag isn’t full of money at all. In fact, that mystical bag may be leaking dollar bills out with every day that goes by and many owners don’t even realize what is happening yet.

Robert L. Vickers, 58, partner of WB Etheridge, Thomas Eikel, WG Horne III and Donald Clesson the "Pinewood Village gang" was sentenced to five years in prison on Oct. 12, 1988, in Arizona for money laundering and conducting an illegal enterprise.

Spitzer opens title insurance probe

New York Attorney General, insurance dept. investigate possible kickbacksThursday, March 02, 2006

By Janis Mara
Inman News

America’s investors have short term memories and want "instant satisfaction" on investments. Some are becoming slowly aware of the fact they might be victims of either their own greed or lenders who prey on unknowledgeable buyers. Most of the fraud appears to have occurred in the Nation’s Sunbelt states, where growth is abundant.

The looming onslaught of foreclosures in markets from California to Florida and many places in between, coupled with many builders refusal to buy property due to over inflated prices has slowed building. New building starts are down.

The National Association of Realtors® use to say that only 3% of all land buyers made a profit on land purchases. Although reliable statistics aren’t yet available on how much that percentage has changed, when the majority of real estate speculators get wind of how they can make a fortune on any investment it’s usually a sign that the markets will deflate.

Land prices in many parts of America, fear lenders and economists alike, are going to come crashing down. The U.S. land fraud crisis has the potential to be a multi-billion dollar problem with tens of thousands of investors on the losing end.

Typically regulators of federally insured mortgages only investigate mortgages in the case of a foreclosure, but with the crash of land in some markets lenders are wondering whether legal investigations will occur sooner rather than later.

The over abundance of real estate speculators in land is sure to trigger foreclosures. "Something has to happen," said Florida builder Tate Watson. "I wonder how big it will be or should I say how bad it will play out in the markets."

The extent to which greed and fraud has occurred in land transactions cannot possibly be known this early in the investigatory process. How much of an effect it will play out in the market place is also nearly impossible to tell, according to several real estate economists.

One old-time real estate investor says the fraud has been so rampant it reminds him of 1989 when real estate markets came to a tumbling halt. "You can feel it," said California investor Tom Taylor. "It’s just like 1989 all over again

The Ghosts Of  "EAGLE TITLE CO."  of CONROE TEXAS

Regulators Probing Title Insurance Kickbacks
Wednesday, March 02, 2005 - By Andrew Countryman and William Sluis -
Chicago Tribune

CHICAGO, (KRT) - State regulators across the country are conducting a widening investigation into what they call a kickback scheme under which developers and lenders steer title insurance business to certain companies.

However, most investors say this is a different sort of fraud, perpetuated by investor’s greed, some lenders willingness to make questionable loans and the Fed’s drastic raising of interest rates to the highest level in five years. The Federal Reserve Board controls the nation’s vital lending rates, effecting mortgages and loans of all types in an attempt to control the nation’s economy.

If history is any sort of guide post, the prices of land increased to staggering levels in many real estate markets effected by the fraud caused by the Savings and Loan Crisis, and it took years for land prices to come down to a level where investors would buy land up in mass again. But the Savings and Loan crisis scenario of the late 1980's was caused by the deregulation of Savings and Loans.

The complexion of the U.S. Land Fraud Crisis will take many months, if not years to fully unravel and play out in the market place, according to economists, many of whom feel it will not have the large scale impact of the Savings and Loan Crisis. Most contend privately however, that it will have at least significant effects on the nation’s economy. Congress could be called upon once again to bail out the banks.

Many economists are hesitant to talk about the situation publicly, fearing that markets could react in mass. Most interviewed for this report chose to stay off the record publicly, instead choosing the path of least resistance. However, a few did estimate the crisis will cost hundreds of thousands of land owners and investors many millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars. They also estimate it will cost banks and other lenders fortunes.

"A whole lot of people are going to get hurt," said one economist. "We know that much. Just how many people it will effect is hard to tell."

Many investors have made fortunes in the U.S. Land Fraud Crisis, which will soon turn into a public scandal. Some say it’s because of the capitalistic market place running its natural course, a sort of disturbing view with a perception of how greed eventually destroys all business markets one at a time.

http://www.mail- archive.com/ ctrl@listserv. aol.com/msg24399 .html

A hastily formed land company purchases a huge chunk
of wilderness, maybe 10,000 acres for $100 an acre. Next step is the bulldozing of crude dirt roads and the plotting of the land into lots. The 10,000 acres become 40,000 quarter-acre lots. Then, through fancy advertising and lots of slick blueprints, those 40,000 lots are sold nationwide for $1,000 a lot. That's a $40 million return on a $1 million investment. By the time sales commissions have been paid, engineering and planning costs met,and the heavy advertising budget absorbed, the actual profit is closer to $20million.

(TIME, April 13) -- Remember Whitewater? Hacking through that thorny bramble of failed land deals and shady bank loans was supposed to be Ken Starr's big mission. But since January, it has often seemed that the independent counsel, in his zeal to prove the President tried to cover up extramarital sex, had forgotten all about Arkansas. Now Starr appears ready to close up shop in Little Rock. And there's no sign that his effort--which will have consumed four years and as much as $50 million when all is said and done--will result in any charges being filed against Bill or Hillary Clinton.

Tucker's first day of secret testimony, March 18, was devoted to a six-hour tour of the Clintons' real estate history. Starr apparently hoped he would provide more details about Hillary's role in a house-of-cards residential development called Castle Grande, which Jim McDougal financed through his savings-and- loan, Madison Guaranty. Federal regulators called Castle Grande a sham. After earning $2 million in commissions and fees for McDougal's associates, it collapsed in 1989 (cost to taxpayers: $4 million), helping trigger the $50 million failure of Madison. In sworn statements to federal regulators, Hillary said she recalled doing little or no work for Castle Grande. In 1988 Castle Grande records were destroyed in what Hillary and her Rose law colleagues later called a housekeeping effort. In 1996 her billing records for the deal, which Starr had sought for two years, turned up in the White House residence; they showed that Hillary had billed at least 30 hours of work
on Castle Grande. Her lawyer said that she had known the project by another name and that she was not involved in any fraud.

Why is the Arizona Republic bringing up the Don Bolles issue when they would like the issues ignored

Ernest Hancock
Website: www.ernesthancock . com

Why would dozens of Investigative Reporters and Editors come to Arizona to report on our corruption and the death of a reporter of the Arizona Republic? Why would the Arizona Republic not run the reports from a 5 month investigation while the rest of the country was focused on the stories?

LANDOWNERS FACE LONG, HARD BATTLE FOR ROAD REPAIRS

VICTIMS OF 'SHYSTERS' Date:
SUN, 3/30/1986
WILLIAM PACK, Post Reporter  Post photos  by Jerry Click

Dreams of paradise have been shattered for scores of Montgomery County landowners who face a seemingly never-ending struggle to obtain various public services.

"You really feel like you're being abused," said Tommy Gage.

Gage moved to a southwest Montgomery County subdivision four years ago only to find the roads there so bad that school buses were not allowed on them.

Vicki Burleigh, who lives at a mobile home subdivision in the southeast part of the county, said many residents have moved out because of poor roads, bad drainage, troublesome septic tank systems and uncaring neighbors who litter their property with junk.

"My husband doesn't want to leave," Burleigh said. "We had to clear the land and put in a lot of work out here. But I'd almost rather take a loss and start over somewhere else than get this place paid for in a few years and be living in a slum."

Donna Meek, one of Burleigh's neighbors in Pinewood Village, said her family's move five years ago was part of a dream to get "farther out and have some room to breathe."

"We love it out here," Meek said. "We don't want to move, but we may be forced to."

Landowners with similar problems voice their complaints at almost every meeting of the Montgomery County Commissioners Court.

"We all pay county taxes and yet the county won't do anything to keep the roads from tearing up my truck," Gage contended.

But it appears the county's attitude is changing.

Officials say the problems many of the landowners describe are the result of unscrupulous developers who never recorded plans for their subdivisions with the county.

"They would buy up some acreage, mark off a road, grade it and put a little gravel on it and say the county will take care of it," said Precinct 1 Commissioner Oliver Hance. County Judge Jimmie C. Edwards III described such developers as "shysters who came in, did the deal, made some money and hooked it."

By failing to have the development recorded, developers avoided requirements in effect since 1967 that stipulate, among other things, how roads should be built, what type of drainage studies should be done and when septic tanks are allowed.

Officials contend they have no authority to make improvements in unrecorded subdivisions where county building specifications have been ignored. They also concede there are more than 600 such subdivisions in the county.

"Can you believe that number?" asked the county's new health director, Dr. Sydney Garrett.

He said drainage, sewage and septic tank problems can generate health hazards that should be addressed in any proposed remedy.

The focus of the county's initial response will be poor roads, since officials said that is the problem most often identified by landowners.

Gage and other landowners said the roads have deteriorated despite their efforts to maintain them.

"My brother and I had a tractor and we tried to keep the roads up as best we could until times got hard and we had to sell the tractor," said Johnny Thibodeaux, who lives in an unrecorded subdivision north of Splendora. "But grading the road doesn't take care of the holes or clean out the ditches."

If the roads are bad enough, buses, postal officials and at times garbage haulers will not come down them, landowners said.

"We're on our fourth garbage hauler," said Burleigh. "I assume they quit coming because of the roads . . . I imagine one of the reasons family doesn't come visit anymore is because the roads are so bad." Hance said landowners are perplexed when they learn the county can't improve their substandard roads, noting that commissioners often have yielded to political pressure and provided such improvements.

"Commissioners did that in the past when the county had 40,000 people," observed Precinct 2 Commissioner Carol Shelton. "But now, the county has grown so much and funding is so limited, you don't see it anymore."

Shelton said commissioners do not have enough money to keep existing county roads in proper shape. Adding improvement and maintenance costs on roads from unrecorded subdivisions would "penalize the rest of the citizens for the benefit of these few taxpayers," Shelton said.

Others contend the county simply does not have enough money to improve all of the roads in unrecorded subdivisions, now estimated to cover some 450 miles.

Edwards said he is most interested in finding those developers "who misled their investors" by telling them roads and other facilities would be upgraded.

He contended the worst violations occurred in the 1960s and 1970s when the area economy was robust and land was cheap.

W.B. Etheridge, a real estate attorney in Conroe who has developed small subdivisions, said some landowners were victimized during those years by high- pressure salespeople who "made promises but never followed up on them."

"That should never happen," Etheridge said.

He and other developers contended, however, that in recent years, subdivision regulations have been honored.

It is primarily moderate-income families that were victimized by developers who never recorded their subdivisions, officials reported. They say solutions will take a long time to accomplish.

"Inadequately Developed Issues"  The Understatement Of The Millenia
Du ROI urged that its rights had been violated, arguing that it had been singled out for unfair treatment. We think these issues were not adequately developed. They may be important as equitable defenses since the county sought equitable relief. The doctrine of balancing the equities and the doctrine of clean hands may become relevant. There was more than a scintilla of evidence to show that the father of a county-wide elected official was alleged to have developed an unrecorded subdivision as well as the husband of the secretary of the elected official. Further, reviewing the whole posture of the case, we perceive that the City of Conroe was a proper party to the litigation and may well have been a necessary party. R.V. King may be a necessary party also.

An order had been entered in this appeal concerning the problem of overburdening this record. That order was improvidently granted. It is set aside. We have examined the entire record.

OPINION

BROOKSHIRE, Justice.
Montgomery County (hereafter “County”) was plaintiff and cross-defendant in the trial court. La COUR Du ROI, INC., (hereafter “Du ROI”) was defendant and cross-plaintiff below. County sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief and damages based on Du ROI's failure to comply with statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to subdivision development in the County. Du ROI pleaded for a declaratory*180

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *180)

---------------------------------
judgment that those statutes, rules and regulations were void and unenforceable. Du ROI also pleaded for relief declaring the nature and extent of the County's power, rights and jurisdiction concerning the subdivision, “The Wilderness”, as well as the rights and obligations of the parties under the statutes, rules and regulations concerning subdivisions. Du ROI additionally counterclaimed for damages under the Civil Rights Statute, 42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1983 (West 1981), and for reasonable attorney's fees in part under TEX.REV.CIV. STAT.ANN. art. 2524-1 (Vernon 1965 and Vernon Supp.1985), popularly known as the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Alternatively, Du ROI pleaded that the County had no power to regulate subdivisions within 5 miles of an incorporated city. In brief, County complained of Du ROI's development of “The Wilderness”, an unrecorded subdivision of land. County contended that the counterclaim below involved solely the controversy between it and Du ROI
regarding “The Wilderness”, attempting to defeat recovery of attorney's fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act. Judgment was rendered that the County take nothing and that Du ROI take nothing as to any of its claims, including attorney's fees. Both parties appealed.

Contentions on Voir Dire
To the venire panel the County announced its theory of the case. It contended that R.V. King's corporation, La COUR Du ROI, INC., had sold subdivided tracts in Montgomery County to purchasers. King and his corporation had laid out roads either for public use or for the use of the owners in the subdivision, failing to make a proper plat or map of the same. County also contended that King had not obtained acknowledgements to the plat. He failed to file the plat. He failed to record the plat. The reason for these failures was that King had not met the requirements to make the plat recordable. He did not approach the Commissioners Court with his plans or plat.

The County said that those requirements were that he, King, provide adequate right-of-way for the roads; that he provide an adequate street cut; that he properly build the roads; adequate drainage should be provided. King had failed to give the Commissioners Court a bond to secure the performance by the subdivider. The County additionally contended that, if the subdivider had approached and communicated with the Commissioners Court, the plat would have been refused. The County ( THE STATE OF TEXAS ) maintained that he should have come to the Commissioners Court, complied with County's rules and regulations, obtained approval and filed the plat before selling the parcels of land.

The trial attorney for Du ROI stated that the corporation was R.V. King's and that King owned its stock. The defendant's attorney stated that there were 500 unrecorded subdivisions in Montgomery County and that people who lived in some of these unrecorded subdivisions wanted better roads and maintenance. Du ROI's attorney said that King's name was on the list of about 36 or 37 people who had put on unrecorded subdivisions. He said the County did not want to accept the subdivision plat; yet, it wanted the roads improved at the developer's expense.

The defense further contended that the County, for the first time in 1983-being about 7 years after inception of the subdivision- sent a letter to King saying that his corporation (as to “The Wilderness” subdivision) did not meet the county standards on roads and that King had not prepared a recordable subdivision plat. The defense also contended that the county wanted King and his corporation to file a subdivision plat with the Commissioners Court and improve the roads according to the 1980 subdivision rules, standards and regulations. The defense pointed out that the 1980 rules and regulations were adopted by the County after the subdivision was platted in 1976. Most of the tracts were sold by the end of 1978. The County also wanted a bond to insure performance.

It was explained that the corporation had a lawsuit against the County under the civil rights statutes. Basically, it was contended*181

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *181)

---------------------------------
that the County had no authority to make the demands that it was making in this litigation and that the corporation should recover attorney's fees, plus a money award from the jury for violation of civil rights.

Du ROI purchased 1,140 acres of land from King. This acreage is located on and adjacent to the Egypt-Honea Road, a county road for many years. There was an oilfield road located on the tract. Several smaller roads were put in. From 1976 to 1978, the subdivision sold about 135 to 140 parcels. The defense lawyer conceded that King was in the business of subdividing land and that is what the corporation did. At the time of the trial King or his corporation still had about 40 of the original parcels of land. In each case, someone had contracted with Du ROI or King to purchase the title.

Some of “The Wilderness” subdivision was in the Lake Creek area. When Lake Creek rose some of the property was submerged and for sale signs appeared in substantial numbers. Voir dire was concluded.

Narrative of Background
The first witness was Robert V. King. He was, at the time of the trial, President of La COUR Du ROI, INC., a Texas corporation. He stated that it was a solvent corporation. King was also the President of Northlands, Inc., which was claimed to be the same as Du ROI. King owned all the shares in La COUR Du ROI, INC. He ran Du ROI. He could not remember the names of the vice-president or the secretary-treasurer . They did nothing, having no duties.

In November, 1974, Du ROI obtained title to a tract of land containing 1,140 acres. King stated the corporation divided that property into parcels to be sold to the public and that the development had been referred to as “The Wilderness” subdivision. He said nearly all the property was sold in 1977 or 1978. He testified that “The Wilderness” subdivision had roads but that they were not laid out for public use. He did collect a road maintenance fee for some years. It amounted to $2.50 per month per acre in the beginning. It was raised to $3.50. Later the maintenance of the roads was turned over to a Civic Club. At first road maintenance fees were sent either to King or the corporation. King admitted Du ROI laid out the roads for the purpose of the subdivision and that these roads were for the use of the lot owners in “The Wilderness”. King affirmed that. He also said the roads had been used by the Superior Oil Company and Hill Oil Company. King testified that the purchasers
owned the roads. Du ROI had sold the property to each lot owner to the center line of the road. “The Wilderness” subdivision was for sale to the general public. He had a plat prepared of the subdivision to show to prospective purchasers, but only a few saw it.

County's Exhibit No. 30 was introduced into evidence. It is a map showing the subdivision of the 1,140 acre tract, being certified to by Michael Case, a registered public surveyor, on January 12, 1976. The certificate is:

“I hereby certify that this is a true representation of a subdivision of the above tract as surveyed on the ground by me. All corners are shown both natural and artifical [sic] are as found or set by me at this date.”

Lake Creek was shown on County's 30, as was the Egypt Road, being blacktopped. The map of the subdivision shows “Valley Wood Acres” adjacent to the north. King conceded that the Egypt-Honea Road was a public road and Du ROI subdivided land into lots straddling that road. King examined a deed from Du ROI to James R. Vancourt which read in part:

“Tract One Hundred-Four (104) of the Robert V. King, a [sic] unrecorded subdivision of 1140.54 acres of land in THE ARCHIBALD HODGE Survey, A-18 of Montgomery County, Texas and more particularly described by metes and bounds as follows:” (Emphasis added)

Tract 104 was deep in the interior of the subdivision. Referring to certain covenants or restrictions on 104, he read:

*182

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *182)

---------------------------------
“12. ··· This land and the public road in front of this land shall be kept free of litter or trash.” (Emphasis added)

King said that he did not know if it was a public road or not and did not know if it had been a public road prior to the time he purchased the land. He maintained that it was a prior existing road that touched on two sides of Tract 104. King testified that the road had probably been in existence for 20, 30 or 40 years. His attorney had a picture that showed a gate across the road with a “Keep Out” sign. King conceded that he had laid out one or two roads for the use of the purchasers.

He further conceded that there existed between 130 and 145 legal instruments, involving either deeds or contracts for deeds, and that a good number of them were on file in the County Clerk's office and that each contained the public road language or designation. County's Exhibit 30, however, had not been filed or recorded in the County Clerk's office and he had not sought in any manner to obtain the approval of the Commissioners Court prior to, or subsequent to, the sale of any of the tracts. He admitted that he had not made himself known to the Commissioners Court or to the County Clerk.

The subdivision was not used for residential purposes before 1975. After it was sold, however, the subdivision was restricted to residential use. Nor had King approached the government of the City of Conroe about the approval of the subdivision. King admitted that he did not have 32 feet of street cut or compacted subgrade on all the roads. King said some of the subdivision was in the flood plain. He also testified that the roads did deteriorate a good deal in wet weather especially if heavy trucks used them.

King testified that he did seek a permit from the Montgomery County Health Department. After the department examined the acreage, it determined that it was permissible to use septic tanks. Building permits were issued allowing septic tanks.

There are no street lights in the subdivision. King further testified that he did not intend to further plat the subdivision more than that already done, nor did he have any intention of further improving the roads nor of putting in drainage structures or improvements. He did not intend to tender a bond for performance. He had no intention of entering into any written contract with Montgomery County and a court order would be required to make him do so.

King changed the name for La COUR Du ROI, INC., to Northlands, Inc., by filing a name change with the County Clerk in Harris County. King thought that the land was within 5 miles of the City of Conroe and that, therefore, it was subject to the city's jurisdiction. He said he never went to the city to have his map or plat approved by the city.

The Roads
King estimated about 18,000 linear feet of roads exist in “The Wilderness” that need to be maintained. The County contended that it would cost $15.00 per linear foot to construct these roads, thereby showing that it would cost $270,000 to properly complete those roads, but that only $405 a month was being collected for maintenance. King said he was willing to help on the maintenance through the Civic Club but that he was not willing to pay any money to the County to rebuild roads. He said he would not be willing to pay money to condemn the rights-of-way if the roads were private and classified as such.

One Foot Strip Annexation
The ordinance concerning the Conroe annexation along F.M. 1488 was called a spoke or strip annexation, having been passed in 1966. A large portion of that annexation was deannexed in March, 1976. King agreed he was still making contracts for deeds in 1977 and he had some repossessions in 1981 and 1982. At trial time he still had a number of deeds to make out; that is, the actual conveyances of the property, for the corporation.

The County Engineer
James D. Blanton, the County Engineer and Flood Plan Administrator for Montgomery*183

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *183)

---------------------------------
County testified. He was a professional engineer. The engineer proved up Exhibit 24 as the County's 1980 regulations for subdivisions, drafted in the engineer's office. Blanton testified that the County and his department were concerned with getting the subdivisions recorded so that they would know where the subdivisions were within the county, especially with respect to the flood plain. Where the lot lines lie was important. The County was interested in the type of drainage work and construction that were done within the subdivisions. Another major concern was the road construction itself. The concern was that the roads should be constructed according to County's standards so that the County would not have to spend the taxpayers' money on subpar roads. The Engineer's Office inspects the roads and the plat. These inspections are made in person by members of the engineering department.

The County's Rules and Regulations
The 1967 rules required a 60&amp;#8242; right-of-way, with the surfaced, traveled roadway of 20&amp;#8242;. Beneath the traveled portion were required 4 inches of compacted base. Each shoulder was required to be 6&amp;#8242; wide; the 20&amp;#8242; traveled part was to be a paved surface. These requirements were necessary because Montgomery County had an average of 53 inches of rain each year and the surfacing was required to keep the moisture out of the base materials so that the road would not deteriorate.

Blanton explained the 1980 requirements. The 60&amp;#8242; right-of-way and the shoulders remained the same in 1980 as they were in 1967. Another requirement was that the amount of the bond was changed from the $3.00 per linear foot in 1967 to $15.00 per linear foot in 1980. The 1980 regulations were based on public hearings and the experience of road failure with resulting potholes. Blanton testified that King had never come to the Engineer's Office to offer this subdivision plat nor to offer a drainage plan for approval.

Flood Plain and Floodway
Blanton further testified that about 56% of the 1,140 acres of the subdivision was in the 100 year flood plain and that 30% actually lies within the floodway. He testified that the flood plain by definition is the area where a flood can be expected once every 100 years, or 1 chance in a 100 each year. The actual history of Montgomery County shows that it has experienced 100 year floods as frequently as three times in a given year. In layman's language, the floodway is the area containing the swiftest and the most dangerous water within the flood plain. Usually the boundaries of floodways are on either side of a creek or a river. In the flood plain a person can obtain a type B building permit which requires a permittee to elevate the slab about the 100 year flood plain. But in the floodway, itself, the County will not issue a building permit of any kind for permanent structures.

Blanton had personally inspected the subdivision known as “The Wilderness”. He testified that some of the roads were basically impassable and that they did not meet the 1967 rules and standards of the county. He testified that most of the subgrade was not 32&amp;#8242; wide, meaning a 20&amp;#8242; roadway or travel way with 6&amp;#8242; shoulders. He said most of the roads in the subdivision appeared not to have had any base at all. Most of the bridge structures did not have railings and appeared to be inadequate in size to take care of the drainage. He further testified there was no hard surface on the roads that he was able to find during his inspection. Some of the roads were too narrow and would quickly deteriorate under use by heavy trucks. Some of the roads were too narrow for two opposing vehicles to pass. One road had but one lane. He testified that it would cost about $20.00 to $25.00 per linear foot to construct a road to county specifications. Later he said $12.00 to $15.00
per linear foot might be an overall average. Some of the roads needed both base and surface and would require widening and ditches.

*184

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *184)

---------------------------------
He said the 18,000 linear feet of roadway in the subdivision, at $15.00 per linear foot, would cost $270,000. But he testified there was probably more like 23,000 linear feet rather than 18,000 linear feet of roadways. The engineer estimated that 23,000 feet of roadway (60 feet wide) would amount to more than 30 acres of right-of-way. This acreage would cost about $3,000 per acre, totaling an additional $90,000. $90,000 would be needed for condemnation purposes as well as $270,000 to construct the roads to comply with the 1967 standards.

The engineer testified that Montgomery County's rules and regulations were less stringent than those of the City of Conroe in 1967. The engineer testified that most of the subdividers or developers cooperated with the county voluntarily but that Mr. King had not voluntarily cooperated in any way to bring “The Wilderness” subdivision up to standard. Blanton said King had never brought any subdivision plat into the County Engineer's office.

Purchaser Vancourt
James Vancourt, 39, lived on Windmill Lane in “The Wilderness” subdivision. He purchased his lot in November, 1976, and paid an average of $2,850 an acre. He bought six acres; he had been paying a road maintenance fee. He understood King was to maintain the roads. He testified that King promised him an all weather road. He had talked to King personally on several occasions. Vancourt was on the road maintenance fund committee of the homeowners association. From his observation, the combination of heavy trucks and a good rain devastated the roads. He testified that there were between 3 1/2 and 4 miles of roads in “The Wilderness” subdivision, but only 1 mile was usable by school buses and mail carriers. He testified that there were 6 permanent homes in the subdivision.

Vancourt conceded that there was a sign on the road coming into the addition declaring it a private drive. When Vancourt bought his first tract, he was shown a plat. Vancourt expected access to his lot in all seasons. He did not expect that during a heavy rain his property would become unreachable. He testified the roads in 1976 and 1978 were maintained by King. Vancourt testified that he helped in handling the maintenance monies. He said these monies were not adequate to improve the roads, with about $1,900 that was on hand. He swore the maintenance fees were not adequate to maintain the roads in their present condition.

Purchaser Larry Thompson
Larry Thompson is 48 and lives on Possum Hollow Road in “The Wilderness”. He purchased tract No. 72. He received two tax bills one year. He went to the tax office and found a change in his tract number. This occurred about three years after he bought tract 72. Later No. 116 was assigned to his tract. Both numbers applied to the same tract. He actually received two different tax bills. He bought a little over 5 acres and paid $3,200 an acre. He maintained that there was nothing in his contract about a road maintenance fee.

At the time Thompson bought his land there was no road to his tract. He had to walk to it. He asked the land agent how he was going to get to this property. The land agent showed him a plat showing a road easement to his land. The easement was going to be cleared for the Thompsons, resulting in an actual road to his tract. But until the day of the trial there was no road where the land agent had promised. Thompson said he was driving on the dirt. He claimed, on the day he testified, that there were puddles of water standing “clear across the road and it's eight to ten inches deep.” He testified that the land agent said: “Well there'll be a road big enough that you can get in and out year around with your car.” Thompson testified that several months after his purchase King called saying that he wanted to talk with Thompson. King explained that Thompson was driving in on a pipeline easement. King wanted to change that. King wanted to take a certain corner off the property and
add a foot on the side. Thompson replied he had already registered his contract with the county and he *185

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *185)

---------------------------------
refused King's request. He then questioned King about the need for the requested easement, especially a 60&amp;#8242; easement. He asked King: “Why do we need it?” Thompson sworn that King said: “Because the county says we have to have a sixty foot road easement when you're in a subdivision.” (Emphasis added) Thompson maintained that there was no road to his property. He claimed that his tract number was changed from the original tract number on his lot and the road easement had been moved from where it was shown on the plat he received when buying his tract. Thompson maintained that King had afforded him only an easement which was placed on the top of a pipeline. He used it to drive into his property but he said it was not a road, stating: “It's where the pipeline cuts trees down.” Thompson possessed a plat the salesman gave him at the time of his purchase. This plat was marked County's 26.

The Foot Wide Strip Annexation
[1]  Du ROI argues that “The Wilderness” lies within 5 miles of Conroe's limits. Hence, the County has no jurisdiction over it. Conroe annexed a foot wide strip of land along F.M. 1488. It appears the city did not and could not extend the usual utilities and municipal services as far along F.M. 1488 to a point approximately south of “The Wilderness”. A major purpose of TEX.REV.CIV. STAT.ANN. art. 974a (Vernon 1963) is to cause plats of subdivisions near or adjacent to cities to conform “to the general plan of said city” and its streets, parks, utility facilities, etc., with regard, inter alia, for extension of sewer, water mains and public utilities. Other important purposes of art. 974a simply vitiate and negate 1 foot strip annexations as being a basis for exclusive jurisdiction of the cities within a 5 mile radius. Conroe repealed most of this strip annexation in March, 1976. The repeal ordinance declared in relevant part:

“Section 1.: The Council finds that the strips of land hereinafter described are not suitable or necessary for City purposes, are uninhabited, and do not contain any property subject to taxation by the City.”

The City “detached” all of the one foot wide strips along the north side of F.M. 1488, annexed by Ordinance 303, situated westerly of the west line of the Henry Proseus Survey. We are unwilling to hold the 1 foot strip annexation when considered with art. 974a -and its purposes-defeats the County's jurisdiction in the 5 mile zone. “The Wilderness” is more than 5 miles outside of the regular, ordinary limits of Conroe. We perceive after the March, 1976, deannexation the remaining 1 foot strip was more than 5 miles from “The Wilderness” Many of the sales were after March, 1976. We hold the 5 mile zone rule does not apply to 1 foot strip annexations.

Article 6626a
The trial judge ruled that the statutes, county rules, and regulations were valid and constitutional but that before September 1, 1983, Montgomery County had no jurisdiction to regulate Du ROI in its activities and actions concerning “The Wilderness” subdivision and denied any injunctive relief. The County forcefully asserts this is error. We agree. We sustain the County's Point of Error One and hold that the trial court's ruling is reversible error. The trial judge also denied attorney's fees to Du ROI.

Du ROI appealed from the denial of declaratory judgment relief and from the refusal to grant attorney's fees. The County appealed the judgment denying its power to regulate Du ROI before September 1, 1983. The Attorney General of Texas appeared and participated to defend the constitutionality of TEX.REV.CIV. STAT.ANN. art. 6626a (Vernon 1969).

[2]  Article 6626a, as amended by the Acts of 1961, effective June 17, 1961, is a logical threshold statute. Article 6626a, as originally enacted in 1957, vested definite powers in the commissioners court concerning construction of streets or roads in subdivisions outside of corporate limits. The commissioners were also empowered to require adequate drainage in accordance with standard engineering practice as well as a *186

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *186)

---------------------------------
bond for performance. The 1957 enactment of art. 6626a provided that Home Rule cities could regulate and restrict subdivisions within a 5 mile radius of their corporate limits. But in that same statute the legislature also found that there were no adequate laws giving supervision to subdivisions outside the corporate limits of a city.FN1 We hold that it was the legislative intent and, indeed, the legislative mandate that concurrent jurisdiction was granted to the counties and the cities in the supervision of subdivisions outside the corporate limits but within a 5 mile radius thereof.

FN1. Act of June 6, 1957 (55th Legislature) , Ch. 436, sec. 7, 1957 Tex.Gen.Laws 1303.

The 1961 amendment to art. 6626a, in relevant part, simply provides that the Act, as amended, “does not limit the requirement of prior approvals of plats by cities”.FN2 We hold that a prior approval also contemplates a subsequent approval. The subsequent approval would necessarily be by the counties. Hence, the only logical, sound, deducible conclusion is that the counties must also have concurrent jurisdiction of subdivisions outside of cities. We so hold. This holding applies to art. 6626a as it existed in 1957 and after it was amended in 1961.

FN2. Act of June 17, 1961 (57th Legislature) , Ch. 449, sec. 2, 1961 Tex.Gen.Laws 1023.

Article 6626a with the 1961 amendment dictates, in mandatory commandments, every owner of land who divides land in two or more parts in any subdivision outside the corporate limits, shall cause a plat to be made which shall accurately describe all of the said subdivision in detail. Further, such plat shall be duly acknowledged by the owners or some agent and shall be filed for record and be recorded in the office of the County Clerk. A bond shall be made conditioned that the owners will construct the roads according to County's specifications. The commissioners court shall have the authority to refuse approval of substandard plats. The provisions of this article (art. 6626a) shall control and be effective (in case of conflict with other laws). These repetitive, mandatory, obligatory, affirmative, and dutiful “ shall ” provisions set out in Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of art. 6626a , we find, clearly express the legislative intent. They empower the commissioners court with
concurrent, mutual jurisdiction involving subdivisions outside city limits but within the 5 mile zone. We are compelled to this holding especially where, as here, the City had not acted, nor had been approached. Neither King nor Du ROI approached the City. Neither King nor Du ROI obtained the City's approval of “The Wilderness”. King unequivocally admitted the same.

Article 6626a, as amended in 1961, and art. 974a, as amended in 1975 and 1981, are harmonious, compatible and complimentary when properly construed. They permit and, indeed, require that counties have concurrent jurisdiction with the cities concerning subdivisions outside the city limits but within the 5 mile zone. There is nothing in the language of either statute which indicates a legislative intent to create exclusive jurisdiction in the cities concerning subdivisions outside of their boundaries but within a 5 mile radius thereof. Article 974a addresses the needs of cities. Article 6626a addresses the needs of counties.

Rules of Statutory Construction
The paramount rule for statutory construction is set out clearly in Eddins-Walcher Butane Company v. Calvert, 156 Tex. 587, 298 S.W.2d 93 (1957), where the holding and rule was announced in the following language:

“Every word of a statute is presumed to have been used for a purpose, and a cardinal rule of statutory construction requires that each sentence, clause, phrase and word be given effect if reasonably possible···· This rule is not altered by the fact that the Legislature has not defined a particular word or phrase, and in the absence of such a definition the words of the enactment will usually be given their ordinary meaning····”

Generally laws relating to the same subject should be construed as though they were *187

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *187)

---------------------------------
incorporated in the same act. If these laws can be harmonized and effect given to each such law or article when so construed then there is no repeal by implication. Repeals by implication are not favored. We deem the proper construction of these statutes, arts. 974a, 6626a, and 6626, is to harmonize them and give effect to each when it is reasonable to do so. We find it reasonable. Gordon v. Lake, 163 Tex. 392, 356 S.W.2d 138 (1962); see also Conley v. Daughters of the Republic, 106 Tex. 80, 156 S.W. 197, 157 S.W. 937 (1913). We quote from Conley, supra, 156 S.W. at page 201:

“··· hence, if repealed, it must be by implication, which is not favored. The two laws relate to the same subject, and should be considered as if incorporated into one act. If being so considered the two can be harmonized and effect given to each, there can be no repeal. Neill v. Keese, 5 Tex. 23, 51 Am.Dec. 746. ‘There [sic] statutes, being in pari materia, and relating to the same subject, are to be taken together and so construed, in reference to each other, as that[,] if practicable, effect may be given to the entire provisions of each. * * * Thus considered, there is no repugnancy between the provisions of these statutes. They may stand together, and effect may be given to the entire provisions of each. And thus to construe and give effect to them, is in accordance with the established rule of construction.’ Brown v. Chancellor, 61 Tex. 438 [sic].”

There is a separate opinion on the motion for rehearing in Conley v. Daughters of the Republic reported at 157 S.W. at page 937, and from the second opinion we quote:

“It is the duty of this court to so construe the laws that both can stand, if fairly susceptible of such construction.”

Our reasoning, we maintain, is harmonious with the reasoning in Trawalter v. Schaeffer, 142 Tex. 521, 179 S.W.2d 765 (1944). We have adhered to these rules of statutory construction in construing art. 974a, art. 6626 and art. 6626a and hold that under this record the Commissioners Court of Montgomery County was not divested of concurrent jurisdiction over “The Wilderness”. This holding is correct because art. 6626a was enacted in 1957 and amended in 1961; whereas, the last amendment to art. 6626 was enacted in 1951.

[3]  To construe these statutes otherwise would allow the undesirable results that have taken place in this case; namely, the replatting of parts of a subdivision, the renumbering of tracts in the subdivision without the consent of the owner and the rendering of duplicate ad valorem tax statements on the same tract of land for the same year. None of these could have been the intention of the Legislature. We cannot ignore the well-established presumption that when construing a statute the Legislature' s choice of words is important and each and every word has significant meaning and purpose. See Riverside Nat. Bank v. Lewis, 603 S.W.2d 169 (Tex.1980). See also Jessen Associates, Inc. v. Bullock, 531 S.W.2d 593 (Tex.1975).

Constitutional Grant of Power
TEX. CONST. art. V, sec. 18, in relevant part, provides:

“The County Commissioners so chosen, with the County Judge as presiding officer, shall compose the County Commissioners Court, which shall exercise such powers and jurisdiction over all county business, as is conferred by this Constitution and the laws of the State, or as may be hereafter prescribed.”

Following that constitutional grant of power the Legislature enacted TEX.REV.CIV. STAT.ANN. art. 2351 (Vernon 1971) which provides, in relevant part:

“Each commissioners court shall:

····

“6. Exercise general control over all roads, highways, ferries and bridges in their counties.” (Emphasis added)

[4]  No subdivider could thwart the constitutional grant of power or the consistent legislative intention to repose into the commissioners court the duties and authority to control and regulate the roads and bridges in their respective counties. In *188

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *188)

---------------------------------
construing TEX. CONST. art. V, sec. 18 with art. 2351, we hold that they conveyed to the commissioners court ample authority and full power to do all things necessary to bring about and fully accomplish the objectives of the grant of power. See Terrell v. Sparks, 104 Tex. 191, 135 S.W. 519 (1911). See also West v. Ellis County, 241 S.W.2d 344 (Tex.Civ.App. -Waco 1951, no writ). We find this clear holding in Terrell v. Sparks, supra, 135 S.W. at 521:

“··· For the rule of construction by which we are to be governed, we copy from Sutherland on Statutory Construction, sec. 341, as follows: ‘Whenever a power is given by statute, everything necessary to make it effectual or requisite to attain the end is implied. It is a well-established principle that statutes containing grants of power are to be construed so as to include the authority to do all things necessary to accomplish the object of the grant. The grant of an express power carries with it by necessary implication every other power necessary and proper to the execution of the power expressly granted. Where the law commands anything to be done, it authorizes the performance of whatever may be necessary for executing its commands.’ ”

Attorney Generals' Opinions
Although we have carefully considered and weighed all of the attorney generals' opinions that were submitted to us, we find them in conflict. They are certainly not harmonious. In view of this, there is added impetus on us to construe the relevant statutes anew and afresh. This we have done.

Equitable Estoppel
[5]  Since it is admitted by King, both for himself and his corporation, Du ROI, that he did not at any time approach the City of Conroe or any of its officers or governing bodies concerning the approval by the City of his subdivision, “The Wilderness”, and since, therefore, the City of Conroe never acted, nor was ever asked to act, nor was ever approached about the plat of the subdivision known as “The Wilderness”; therefore, we hold that R.V. King and his corporation are estopped equitably from arguing and urging that the City of Conroe had exclusive jurisdiction in the 5 mile extra-territorial zone.

Du ROI's Attorney's Fees
[6]  The trial judge committed no error when he refused attorney's fees to La COUR Du ROI, INC. We think his action was correct in the first instance because he did not award La COUR Du ROI, INC., a judgment based on the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Nevertheless, TEX.REV.CIV. STAT.ANN. art. 2524-1 (Vernon 1965 and Vernon Supp.1985) certainly reposes in the trial judge broad discretion in the matter of attorney's fees. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT.ANN. art. 2524-1, sec. 10 (Vernon Supp.1985) provides as follows:

“In any proceeding under this Act [Declaratory Judgments Act] the Court may make such award of costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as may seem equitable and just.” (Emphasis added)

The trial judge's judgment or final decree states, in relevant part:

“The Court further concluded that it is unnecessary to render any declaratory judgment respecting the validity of any of the statutes in controversy and that it would not be equitable or just to award attorney's fees to Defendant. ···” (Emphasis added)

The statute requires the fees to be equitable and just in the mind of the trial court. Under this unusual record, the trial judge had ample reason and discretion to find that the awarding of attorney's fees would not be equitable. Since injunctive relief was involved, the proceeding below was in equity. Under our blended system of law and equity, the court could and doubtlessly did apply the doctrines, either singularly or collectively, of clean hands, balancing the equities and other well-known and well-established cardinal principles of the equity practice. Under this entire record the trial judge, sitting as a chancellor in equity as the keeper of the *189

---------------------------------
(Cite as: 698 S.W.2d 178, *189)

---------------------------------
sovereign's conscience, could and did properly deny Du ROI's attorney's fees. This same reasoning and rationale would apply as to whether the awarding of attorney's fees would be just. The trial judge, well within his prerogative and discretion, decided that it would not seem equitable and just. We affirm the trial court's action in denying the award of attorney's fees to Du ROI.

Inadequately Developed Issues
Du ROI urged that its rights had been violated, arguing that it had been singled out for unfair treatment. We think these issues were not adequately developed. They may be important as equitable defenses since the county sought equitable relief. The doctrine of balancing the equities and the doctrine of clean hands may become relevant. There was more than a scintilla of evidence to show that the father of a county-wide elected official was alleged to have developed an unrecorded subdivision as well as the husband of the secretary of the elected official. Further, reviewing the whole posture of the case, we perceive that the City of Conroe was a proper party to the litigation and may well have been a necessary party. R.V. King may be a necessary party also.

An order had been entered in this appeal concerning the problem of overburdening this record. That order was improvidently granted. It is set aside. We have examined the entire record.

Estoppel by Deed or Estoppel by Written Legal Instrument
We have examined in excess of 40 contracts for the sale of land, general warranty deeds, and conveyances. In virtually every one of these written legal instruments we find such language as:

“5. Furthermore, any mobile homes on this land will be kept concealed from passersby on the public road and from neighbors;

····

“12. ··· This land and the public road in front of this land shall be kept free of litter or trash.”

These “covenants and conditions are imposed as conditions running with the land on the property described ···” and are serious, written recitals, covenants and conditions. They, themselves, constitute strong, probative, primary evidence. These types of covenants and conditions have been characterized as a type of absolute estoppel. They arise from instruments of legal dignity; indeed, from the deeds, themselves, and from the contracts for the sale of land. Therefore, both King and La COUR Du ROI, INC., are firmly and finally estopped from taking the position that the roads in question are not public roads.

The learned, able trial court certainly committed reversible error in this regard. See Kimbro v. Hamilton, 28 Tex. 560 (1866); Havard v. Smith, 13 S.W.2d 743 (Tex.Civ.App. -Beaumont 1929, no writ); Elliott v. Langham, 60 S.W.2d 287 (Tex.Civ.App. -Waco 1933, no writ).

For the reasons, findings and holdings set out above, we reverse the judgment and remand the whole cause for a new trial on the entirety of the cause of action consistent and harmonious with this opinion. And as an additional, separate and independent basis for our decision, we reverse the judgment and remand the entire cause for a new trial because some of the important issues in the case were not adequately or fully developed. Having found reversible error, and as an additional, separate and independent basis for our decision, we reverse and remand in the interest of justice.

REVERSED AND REMANDED.

Every Arizona County and hundreds of thousands of trusting land purchasers were victimized by the rampant land scams of the 1960’s. Artist renditions showed trees and lakes with boating and all the modern facilities: streets, street lights, golf courses, a real piece of the American dream. The true picture was a section of dry Arizona deserts with no development whatsoever. Although Arizona has the reputation of being the worst in the nation, Florida was not far behind and many states had similar swindles take place during the same time period.....

Land fraud, bankruptcy, murder, suicide, incarceration and greed surround the history of Cochise College Park subdivision. Located in Cochise County, consisting of 2 phases of 12 units totaling 8,647 lots, it was the worst fraud in the states and possibly the Nation. The scenic lake at Cochise College Park was filled several times but never would hold water. They sold lots throughout the Midwest, Florida, Canada, across the United States and around the world. Some lots were sold twice. Some mortgages were sold twice. Many documents remain unrecorded today. Some owners never received their deed. Some received deeds but never received satisfaction of their mortgage. Some paid mortgages in full and received satisfaction of the mortgage only to learn the mortgage was sold and the second sale never recorded. The original mortgage is still on record at the County Recorder’s office. They paid on an unrecorded mortgage. This story was repeated in various degrees across the State
creating tangled subdivisions with many unbuildable lots.....

$14 million frozen in lawsuit alleging mortgage fraud

By RAD SALLEE
Staff
.
A federal judge here Friday agreed to freeze up to $14 million in South Texas bank deposits after a New York lender alleged that officials of five companies in Corpus Christi and Houston , including two lawyers, engaged in mortgage fraud.

A lawsuit by Pioneer Commercial Funding Corp. says the defendants created bogus documents to obtain funds from Pioneer, ostensibly to be reloaned to buyers of homes in Houston 's Runningbrook subdivision and elsewhere. Instead, it says, the money was stolen.

The lawsuit accuses the defendants of racketeering, which allows the court to award triple damages if proven. Pioneer is seeking $14 million in actual damages and $42 million in punitive damages.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt signed an order taking control of the deposits in two accounts held in the Bank of Robstown by Mortgage CreditCorp Inc. of Corpus Christi .

Pioneer's attorney Steven Zager said he does not know how much money is in the accounts. He said Pioneer will go after any funds held by any of the defendants, but knows only of the two accounts in Robstown.

The list of 19 defendants is headed by William J. Cartwright Sr. of Corpus Christi , named as president and majority owner of Mortgage CreditCorp and two other companies there, The Cartwright Group Inc. and First State Investors Inc.

Other defendants in Corpus Christi are his sons, William Jr. and Robert H. Cartwright, and Veronica J. Cartwright, who are officers and stockholders in the three companies; Rosmare Saldivar and Melvin Smoots, officers of Mortgage CreditCorp and The Cartwright Group Inc.; William H. Whittle, an attorney and stockholder in Mortgage CreditCorp; and James P. Page. The companies are also defendants.

The Houston defendants are John S. Pipkin, an officer and majority stockholder in Beau-Bay Development Corp. here; his brother Roger W. Pipkin III and his son Roger W. Pipkin IV, both officers and stockholders in the company; and three persons employed by C&amp;P Realty here, attorney Robert L. Vickers, real estate appraiser Steven F. Thomae and Kelly Alan Wohlers.

Pioneer, a "warehouse lender," advances funds to mortgage companies, which lend them in turn to home buyers. To obtain funds, a mortgage company sends Pioneer a package that includes the home buyer's credit application, promissory note, deed of trust, property appraisal, title policy commitment and proof of insurance.

The lawsuit says Pioneer agreed to provide Mortgage CreditCorp up to $35 million for such loans, but sometime in 1989, the defendants began creating packages including "fictitious deeds of trust, counterfeit title commitments, fraudulent credit applications, phony appraisals and bogus insurance policies.' The lawsuit says William J. Cartwright Sr. and others conspired to buy more than 90 vacant lots, most of them in Runningbrook, at foreclosure sales at bargain prices, then transferred the titles to Beau-Bay and C&amp;P Realty.

Fraudulent packages for a number of fictitious buyers were prepared by other defendants, who presented them to Pioneer.

"Neither the houses nor the underlying mortgage transactions actually existed," the lawsuit says. It says Pioneer lost at least $14 million as a result.

Zager said that attorney Whittle's signature is on the deeds of trust and that attorney Vickers' is on the title policy commitments.

The latter were on Stewart Title letterhead, but a Stewart official said the company did not provide them, Zager said. The title tracking numbers are assigned to Associated Title, but that company also disclaimed them, Zager said.
