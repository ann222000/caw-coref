Cat #1: &quot;Mickie&quot; 12 y.o.Scottish Fold polydactyl neutered female, my
wife's since before marriage. She had a three cat household, but the
other two neutered male Siamese died of old age related causes. So, we
replaced them with:

Cat #2: &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; 3 y.o. domestic short hair neutered male, nephew
to Cat #1. Ears short, not folded. Born in a horse trailer, had
giardia when we got him, so lots of care and nursing until that was
cured. Top Cat in the house; very vocal, very adventurous, the only
one of the three who pushes the envelope and sneaks outdoors. He plays
too hard with #1 and #3.

#1 and #2 use three litter boxes on the ground floor of our 1,800 sq
ft split level.

Cat #3: &quot;Angelus&quot; 3 y.o. longhair neutered male, looks like a flame
point Siamese. We got him to soak up some of #2's energy and to keep
#2 from playing so rough with #1, which has not worked well.  A claw
injury tore an eyelid on #3 before we got him was corrected at the
vet, but his vision ain't what it should be. He is phobic about
heights (very un-Siamese!) and definately not the sharpest knife in
the drawer. In the past year, he's gotten positively phobic about #2
to the point of constantly living under our bed, and even
inappropriate elimination. He hid and stopped taking care of himself
for a while, with impacted glands; took him to the vet to clean him up
and give him a 'lion cut'   We gave him his own space; 20 hrs a day he
has the bedroom, bathroom and litter dome in the bath to roam, with
the other two cats locked out. He will come out, mostly at night,
knead the covers on top of us, sleep on top of us, and move back and
forth from one to the other of us as if to see who's warmer.

Feliway has not been effective in quelling the combat. We have three
of the wall-socket dispensers and keep them loaded and dispensing
whatever that stuff is.

We've been thinking about gettting #2 a puppy to play with, since he
obviously thinks he's a labrador retreiver.

However, in seriousness, we will have to get rid of one of #2 or #3 if
we can't get #2 to mellow out.

Your on-topic suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

I think that's very good. Cats love to run away from things they
don't like. They can't do that indoors. A hostile environment
probably causes major stress to an indoor cat.

Cats don't take conventional discipline well, you have to adjust
things. One thing I would do for sure is keep #2's claws trimmed.

lol

I have one that is incredibly playful and incredibly affectionate.
He is getting neutered so I can allow him to cohabitate with my
feral female (will be spayed when I think she won't have a heart
attack). His claws will be kept trimmed and hers will be kept sharp
so she can slap him as needed. I doubt she will play much, but I'm
keeping him off of the bed, so, hopefully they will at least snuggle
this winter.

Good luck.
