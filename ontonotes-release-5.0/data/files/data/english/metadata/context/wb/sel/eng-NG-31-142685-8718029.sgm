Bill Introduced to Eliminate Birthright Citizenship

Bill would eliminate birthright citizenship!
HR 1940 would end the practice of granting automatic citizenship to
the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens. Nearly every other country,
including all members of the European Union, requires that at least
one parent be a citizen or permanent resident for a child to
automatically become a citizen.

The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2007, by Representative Nathan Deal
(R-GA), would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate
birthright citizenship.

Our current policy results in over 300,000 additional citizens from
anchor babies each year. The demographic impact is far greater because
their families stay and bring in additional relatives. Anchor babies
are eligible to sponsor their illegal alien parents and other
relatives when they turn 21. Moreover, taxpayers pick up the tab for
the medical costs and subsequent welfare outlays because of the
child's citizenship status.

I think he must have assumed (as did the lawmaker) that it would
require 2/3s to amend the Constitution.

The weakness then is the assumption that granting automatic birthright
citizenship to persons whose parents are illegal, amnestied or, one
way or the other, not citizens was what was meant by the Constitution
(which it wasn't).

Because one of his jobs is to flood the US with illegal aliens.

Why?

Because:

1.  he believes this will increase business;

2.  doing so will weaken national sovereignty and increase the
speed of transition to a regional government.

I would assume GWB would veto the bill if it wasn't passed with a
veto-proof majority.
However I consider the chances of this bill passing as slim.
Even if it did pass and Jorge allowed it to become law without his
signature, the Supreme Court of the U.S. is likely to have the final word;
that would be very interesting!

Excellent. Let's hope it passes.

If it doesn't, perhaps we should all get out and march on our
respective state capitals. You know, hold something like &quot;A Day
Without AMERICANS&quot;. See where that gets illegal-ass kissing
politicos.

The Founding Fathers had nothing to do with it. The 14th amendment was
passed 13th June 1866, and ratified 9th July 1868. It was designed to
give former slaves US citizenship, along with the rights and
privileges of all other citizens.

If the crafters of the 14th could see to what use it's being put
today, they'd shit bricks.

There's only one way they CAN interpret it.  Any one born in the USA or
any territory to parents subject to the jurisdiction of the USA or of
any State is a citizen.  That includes the children of illegals.  There
is no wiggle room in the Amendment.

I understand exactly what it means.  The question, though, is do you
understand what the (entire) U.S. Constitution means?  Article V (among
others) was included by the Founding Fathers  precisely to deal with future
ssituations which may arrise.

Article V
The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary,
shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the
legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention
for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all
intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the
legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in
three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be
proposed by the Congress; provided that no amendment which may be made prior
to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect
the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and
that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage
in the Senate.

Perhaps you also should read The Declaration of Independence to gain some
further insight.

Of course. And it is precisely the &quot;entire&quot; Constitution which you
ignore.

You are maintaining that the amendment to make U.S. citizens of former
slaves was intended to usurp the very reason for the U.S. Constitution
as plainly stated by its preamble. That is worse than ridiculous.

To maintain that the authors of the amendment must have anticipated a
hostile power such as Mexico would export even for even profit such a
mass of illegal human labor parenting children as is now occurring is
again &quot;worse than ridiculous.&quot;

To maintain that they had and thus had to have presumed that, unlike
any other law, such application of the amendment as yours must be an
exception to any law being based on the very lawfullness of that which
has brought about the condition under question (children of parents
illegal to the U.S. to begin with), is again &quot;worse than ridiculous.&quot;

It is paramount to such attempted co-option of the U.S. Constitution
itself to be a crime in itself.

The authors of the Constitution and authors of later amendments were
also bound, as you should be, even such legal precepts of &quot;Conflict of
interest.&quot;

Once again:

&quot;We the People of the United States (and not anywhere else) in Order

Even if the 14th Amendment's interpretation was meant to be taken
literally, time changes everything.    We now have millions taking
advantage of it by giving birth in our country while here illegally.
We are one of the very few countries that allots birthright
citizenship to children with two illegal parents.   In most countries
at least one parent has to be a citizen of the country their child was
born in.   It only makes sense to adopt the same policy.   I hope that
HR1940 passes.   It is the right thing for this country considering
the scrams that have been going on for an illegal to anchor themselves
unto our country this way.

&gt; &gt;&gt; We could only hope that they would. I think they now would but I am

&gt; &gt;There's only one way they CAN interpret it.  Any one born in the USA or

&gt; &gt;any State is a citizen.  That includes the children of illegals.  There
&gt; &gt;is no wiggle room in the Amendment.

It doesn't say slaves.  It says &quot;ALL PERSONS born or naturalized in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of
the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&quot;

All persons was written to include slaves and EVERYBODY ELSE born or
naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof.

If you want to change that, a new AMENDMENT is required.

I have few problems with the illegals whom I regard quite correctily
as evictees from Mexico.

I did live with them for nearly 20 years in Mexico's truly rigid and
corrupt two-class system.

The major problem is the Mexican government, which is nothing more
than a extortion racket enforced by its police state and the upper-
class it supports particularly in the States as 'dual-citizens'
including, but not only, functionaries (still) of Mexican Government.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We need to erect barriers to keep the barbarians out, right?

Mexico's legal, commercial and political culture is corrupt beyond
redemption. If that what it takes to stop the Mexican Government and
its enablers, such as yourself, stateside: yes.

Mexico is not &quot;democratizing&quot; and, instead, Bush is emulating Mexico's
governance not only for the U.S.A. but also for an imposed North
American Union.

Mexico's central government is also intent on co-opting NAFTA and the
now being imposed North American Union to subjugate the U.S.A..

Do not bother trying to tell me it is not. I learned that in Mexico
before returning stateside to see the massive inundation into the
States that the Mexican Government coerced on its nationals.

Did you know that, since 1981, it was illegal in Cancun, Mexico to
teach ESL which could benefit Mexican wishing to stay and prosper in
Mexico? Only the so-called ESL course &quot;Follow Me to America&quot; was
allowed including its final chapter where Mexican Government is
actually instructing its own nationals who have arrived stateside to
not only obtain (dual) U.S. citizenship but also maintain contact with
the Mexican Consulate and its approved Latin American Associations on
just who and on what to vote for in U.S. elections.

I have met since my return from Mexico, persons I knew there but now
here including functionaries of Mexican government registering
Hispanics stateside to vote in U.S. elections, plain-clothes Federalis
and even Policias Judiciales.

For only one, I will do everything I can to stop Mexico's central
government from inserting its so-called police as (dual) citizens of
the U.S. and U.S. police.

So will the illegals stateside. They are already beginning to turn on
their masters (the MxConsulates) stateside.

How do you maintain the idea that the illegals are in fact immigrants
essentially from a government which, nonetheless, manages and directs
their very existences (with coercion) as so-called &quot;immigrants&quot; even
stateside?

Here is my proposal:

http://www.radicalcenter.org/issues/legal/amendment.php

A Proposed Amendment to the Constitution of the United States

Article ###

1. It is the duty of the President of the United States
to defend the integrity and sovereignty of the United States,
from all enemies foreign and domestic; and from any Invasion
whether armed or unarmed. If the President should
fail to defend the United States from Invasion, that duty
may and must be assumed by the several States, and failing that,
by the People of the United States.

2. A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security
of a free State, and to the security of the Republic,
the right of sane and law-abiding citizens of the United States
to keep and bear arms appropriate to light infantry
shall not be infringed by legislative action of the United States,
by any of the several States, or any other level of government;
nor shall any executive of any level of government decree
a general disarmament except in specific and limited
times and places which may not include any public space
within 20 miles of any national border.

3. If any sane and reasonable person, not debarred from the vote
by felony conviction, shall present themselves to
a judge or justice-of-the-peace and request
a permit to carry a concealed weapon appropriate
to light infantry towards any lawful end such as self-defense,
or defense of home, or defense against Invasion or Riot,
and shall present documentary evidence or prove
by personal demonstration that they are physically capable
and sufficiently trained to use such a weapon,
within no less than one week and no more than twenty-one days,
such a permit shall issue and shall be honored in any and all
of the United States; such a permit shall be considered to
have no date of expiration and can be recalled only upon
conviction of a felony causing a loss of State voting priveleges,
or by medical certification for unfitness due to
violent insanity or physical incapacity. The several States may,
by actions of their legislatures, extend permissions
as they see fit, to carry concealed weapons within that State
to various individuals not meeting all of the qualifications
listed in this section, but under no circumstances
may any person not a legal resident of the United States
be issued a permit to carry concealed weapons,
nor shall they be considered as having any right whatsoever
to keep and bear arms.

4. Any person naturalized in the United States, or born
in the United States to a mother legally resident in the United States,
is a citizen of the United States, and of the State wherein they reside.

5. No State, or any part of any State, shall deny to
any persons under their jurisdictions the equal protection
of the laws, nor deny them the due process of law
in a timely manner; or deny to any citizen access
to representative counsel, nor shall a citizen be denied
access to such effective law-enforcement as may be needed
to assure equal protections of the law.

The incapacity of a weak and distracted government may

I should pause briefly to point out that recently the KKK and similar
white-supremacist groups have begun quoting the logic of the mainstream
immigration-reform/border-security groups, rather than the other way around.
While they may take our arguments and attempt to use them to support their
racism, we find that rather appalling and do not support the racism.

That being said, failure to defend the borders -- even against generally
unarmed invasion -- is to fail to defend the interior. In the modern day and
age, to fail to defend the interior is to fail to defend mass population
centers, and to fail to defend mass population centers is to risk the
placement and use of weapons of mass destruction.

Clearly there will be ways to get personnel or materiel into the country,
other than by sneaking them across the border. Yet those ways will be more
costly and perhaps far more difficult to achieve than would be sneaking
across the border with a deadly payload disguised as mere contraband.
There's no reason why we should leave the borders wide open to any and all
uninspected traffic. No traffic nor person should transit the border without
inspection.

The KKK has always been not just about race, but about TRIBALISM.
It includes culture and religion as well.  They hate the Jews,
although the Jewish people are white, like them.  The KKK spread their
hate against Catholics, too.  Because Catholics were... not Protestant
enough for them.  Anybody they see as not inside the boundary of their
tribe as they define it is an enemy, to be excluded, insulted, maligned
and discriminated against.

You are acting the same way.  You just draw a different boundary.

...that by enabling Mexico's consulates and their many proxies
stateside, as you certainly do, you are in fact heeding Mexico's
version of Simon Legree.

The illegals were evicted: systematically robbed, since 1981, of their
properties, jobs, educations, pensions, social services and any future
in Mexico for the sole purpose of their being trafficked to the USA as
cheap labor to &quot;capture U.S. dollars,&quot; and, if given a &quot;path to
citizenship,&quot; as lobbied strenuously by Mexico's central government,
to be doubly extorted by Mexico's central government to control their
votes cast in U.S. elections (as also instructed in Mexico since 1981).

I do not consider that a major risk of allowing Mexican laborers to
cross into the US illegally.  I'd consider it far more likely that
they'd &quot;spread the word&quot; about the Mexican guys who crossed with them

To place the magnitude of that task into perspective, consider rush

every vehicle entering or leaving that city every day.

Now do this for the whole country.

&gt;1. It is the duty of the President of the United States

&gt;fail to defend the United States from Invasion, that duty

&gt;the right of sane and law-abiding citizens of the United States
&gt;to keep and bear arms appropriate to light infantry
&gt;shall not be infringed by legislative action of the United States,
&gt;by any of the several States, or any other level of government;
&gt;nor shall any executive of any level of government decree
&gt;a general disarmament except in specific and limited

&gt;within 20 miles of any national border.

&gt;3. If any sane and reasonable person, not debarred from the vote
&gt;by felony conviction, shall present themselves to
&gt;a judge or justice-of-the-peace and request
&gt;a permit to carry a concealed weapon appropriate
&gt;to light infantry towards any lawful end such as self-defense,

&gt;by personal demonstration that they are physically capable
&gt;and sufficiently trained to use such a weapon,
&gt;within no less than one week and no more than twenty-one days,
&gt;such a permit shall issue and shall be honored in any and all

&gt;to various individuals not meeting all of the qualifications
&gt;listed in this section, but under no circumstances

&gt;be issued a permit to carry concealed weapons,

&gt;to keep and bear arms.

Too many words, much of this is covered elsewhere as separate
legislation with which nobody has a problem, there is no definition
for some terms such as &quot;violent insanity&quot; or &quot;light infantry&quot; as well

I have an issue with explicitly requiring access to counsel only for
citizens.  Practice what you preach, I always say.  If we're going to

even illegal ones get Miranda and representation.
