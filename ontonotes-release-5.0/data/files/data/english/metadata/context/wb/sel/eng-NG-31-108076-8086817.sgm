Thanks Dimi, what a great resource!

It's interesting to note that MT punching techniques are virtually identical to
those in Western boxing. When you actively train with resisting opponents, what
works and what doesn't work becomes blatantly obvious, so little wonder both arts
boiled down to pretty much the same techniques. Conversely, static training,
hitting wooden dummies and most kata create endless lines of improbable,
unworkable techniques that never get found out to be useless until it's too late.
