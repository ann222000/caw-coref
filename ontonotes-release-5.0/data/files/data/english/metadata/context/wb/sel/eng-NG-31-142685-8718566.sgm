&gt;New Romney Ad Targets Illegal Migrants

&gt;Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney criticizes &quot;sanctuary cities&quot; for illegal
&gt;immigrants - and by implication Republican rival Rudy Giuliani - in a new
&gt;radio ad.

&gt;&quot;Immigration laws don't work if they're ignored. That's the problem with
&gt;cities like Newark, San Francisco and New York City that adopt sanctuary
&gt;policies,&quot; an announcer says in the ad, which runs in New Hampshire and
&gt;Iowa. &quot;Sanctuary cities become magnets that encourage illegal immigration
&gt;and undermine secure borders.&quot;
">

He's so right.  It's a fine line for the candidates to say what the masses (us) want
to hear while at the same time not losing all the legal Hispanic votes and Romney is
fine tuning his stance better and better all the time.....AAC

&quot;.....sanctuary cities not only encourage further lawbreaking by offering refuge to
illegal immigrants, but also contribute to unfunded mandates to cover the resulting
hospital, incarceration and educational costs.

Because most of these costs are then unfairly borne by the American taxpayer, they
should have some recourse against those sanctuary cities.  If the federal government
will not cut off funds to the offending cities, perhaps citizens should have access
to filing class-action lawsuits against their local governments.&quot;....Jim Redhead

&quot;Promoting sanctuary cities is totally antithetical to protecting the sovereignty of
our nation.&quot;.....Jim Redhead

&quot;A country without borders is not a sovereign nation.&quot;.....Michelle Malkin

&quot;Talk about being unclear.  Checking immigration status at schools, ERs and police
stations will certainly encourage illegal aliens to 'abandon those services.'  That's
the point -- By making it less pleasant and more expensive to remain here, many will
self-deport.&quot; .....Randall C. Sink

He NEVER hired illegals.

He did contract a lawn service who employed illegals.

Try to get the facts right.

Romney gets a pass on that illegal alien gardener thing.  He was
running a large corporation at the time, then was Gov. of Mass.  I
doubt he even paid one iota to who was cutting his lawn.  He probably
had a personal assistant who managed such menial tasks.  Meanwhile,
Giuliani sued the Feds in order to keep the social freebies flowing to
illegal aliens living in New York City.

Calling Romney on that is akin to calling all of us willing employers
of Illegals because we ate at a Denny's.

When you hire a company the burden is on the company not you.
