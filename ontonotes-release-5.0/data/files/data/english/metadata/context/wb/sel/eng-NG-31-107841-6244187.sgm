Tolerance

I have been struggling with the concept of tolerance lately. For many years
I have advocated personal tolerance as the cornerstone of a healthy society.
I guess I still do providing we do not see our toleration as being the
ability to overlook the faults of others, but rather our ability to respect
our differences. Harmony comes from living together not from just accepting
adversarial relationships. So I still basically believe that tolerance is
good and intolerance is bad.

Tolerance is defined by some as

*       the power or capacity of an organism to tolerate unfavorable
environmental conditions
*       a disposition to allow freedom of choice and behavior
*       a disposition to tolerate or accept people or situations

On the surface it all sounds good. But have we become so tolerant that we
ignore problems that we face as individuals and as a society. Would their
have been the oppression and slaughter of the Jews in Germany during the
30's and 40's if people like you and me had not tolerated the evil action of
others. Is the willingness of most of the world's people to tolerate the
current slaughter of innocents in Africa the act of a civilized populace?

Many of us are given the opportunity to stand up and say no to things that
should not be in our own personal world, yet how many of us just sit by and
tolerate the existing condition because it just is not all that important to
us. Many think the answer rests in democracy, yet democracy with out civil
liberty often results in the oppression of the minority. We should really
care and raise our voices in opposition to what should be the intolerable
for each of us are minorities of one kind or another. As an example I belong
to an age group is only a small percentage of the total population and my
personal beliefs are not shared by everyone else. We are all different in
one way or the other and we need to stand up and demand our right to be
different for if we don't who will?

Sorry for the long winded diatribe today, but I worry about our toleration
of things that darken the future. Sadly nothing will change unless we decide
to take some responsibility to at least leave the world no worse than we
found it, we owe it to future generations.

A Blonde's Cookbook

Monday: It's fun to cook for Tom. Today I made angel food cake. The recipe
said beat 12 eggs separately. The neighbors were nice enough to loan me some
extra bowls.

Tuesday: Tom wanted fruit salad for supper. The recipe said serve without
dressing. So, I didn't dress. What a surprise when Tom brought a friend home
for supper.

Wednesday: A good day for rice. The recipe said wash thoroughly before
steaming the rice. It seemed kind of silly, but I took a bath anyway. I
can't say it improved the rice any.

Thursday: Today Tom asked for salad again. I tried a new recipe. It said
prepare ingredients, lay on a bed of lettuce one hour before serving. Tom
asked me why I was rolling around in the garden.

Friday: I found an easy recipe for cookies. It said, put the ingredients in
a bowl and beat it. There must have been something wrong with this recipe.
When I got back, everything was the same as when I left.

Saturday: Tom did the shopping today and brought home a chicken. He asked me
to dress it for Sunday. For some reason, Tom keeps counting to ten.

Sunday: Tom's folks came to dinner. I wanted to serve roast, but all I had
was hamburger. Suddenly, I had a flash of genius. I put the hamburger in the
oven and set the controls for roast. It still came out hamburger, much to my
disappointment.

Well, good night, dear diary. This has been a very exciting week. I am eager
for tomorrow to come, so I can try out a new recipe on Tom. If I can talk
Tom into buying a bigger oven, I would like to surprise him with chocolate
moose.

Some people will like me and some won't. So, I might as well be myself, and
then at least I'll know that the people who like me, like me.

The little sexy housewife was built so well the TV repairman couldn't keep
his eyes off of her. Every time she came in the room, he'd near about jerk
his neck right out of joint looking at her. When he'd finished she paid him
and said, "I'm going to make a . . . well . . . unusual request. But you
have to first promise me you'll keep it a secret."

The repairman quickly agreed and she went on. "Well, it's kind of
embarrassing to talk about, but while my husband is a kind, decent man,
'sigh', he has a certain physical weakness. A certain disability. Now, I'm a
woman and you're a man . . . "

The repairman could hardly speak, "Yes...yes!"

"And since I've been wanting to ask you ever since you came in the door..."

"Yes... yes!"

"Would you help me move the refrigerator?"

Now that the metric system is in wide use all over the world, we can see why
Americans have not adopted it:

A miss is as good s 1.6 kilometers.

Put your best .3 of a meter forward.

Spare the 5.03 meters and spoil the child.

Twenty-eight grams of prevention is worth 453 grams of cure.

Give a man 2.5 centimeters and he'll take 1.6 kilometers.

No sense being pessimistic, it probably wouldn't work anyway.

One afternoon, a woman was in her back yard hanging the laundry when an old,
tired-looking dog wandered into the yard. The woman could tell from the
dog's collar and well-fed belly that he had a home. But when she walked into
the house, the dog followed her, sauntered down the hall and fell asleep in
a corner. An hour later, he went to the door, and the woman let him out.

The next day the dog was back. He resumed his position in the hallway and
slept for an hour. This continued for several weeks. Curious, the woman
pinned a note to his collar: "Every afternoon, your dog comes to my house
for a nap."

The next day he arrived with a different note pinned to his collar: "We have
ten children. He's trying to catch up on his sleep.

She said: My husband and I found a charming bed-and-breakfast nestled in the
White Mountains of New Hampshire. Though enchanted, I nonetheless had some
questions about the accommodations.

"Does the room have its own bath?" I asked.

Nodding, the proprietor answered, "If no one else checks in, it does."

Collective fear stimulates herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity
toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd.
