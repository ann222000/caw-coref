Arming the Left: Is the time now? --by Charles Southwell*

I hope you didn't open this page to read what we already know: that this is
the most rightwing government we have ever had in the US, even far right of
Bush I, that our rights are being eroded daily, and that our democratic
process is all but gone, if it isn't already gone.

I hope you came here to read about tactics for action that will finally have
some consequence. I hope you agree that our protests, petitions, letters,
and on and on, have been utterly ignored. The fascistas that run our country
laugh at us. They believe they can do anything and that we haven't got the
guts to revolt, but only to wage a war of words. I have seen the Bush
cavalcades, as they drive away, his aids sneering and jeering and laughing
and mocking our protests. They think we are a JOKE. Tens of millions of
Americans protested the war, but because we posed no REAL THREAT to their
power, we were UTTERLY IGNORED.

As long as we pose no REAL threat to the powers-that-be, to what is shaping
up into a dictatorship, we will continue to be ignored. Right now, we are
ignored because we present no organized power to fight this onslaught of
anti-democratic, totalitarian government that we are up against.

It will take time, but it's time to get more left-leaning liberals and
outright leftists to at least POSE a threat, by getting organized and
getting ARMED. It's time to get well past this liberal phobia and taboo
about weapons and force. After all, our liberalism was won with a
REVOLUTIONARY WAR! they used real guns in that war. The French Revolution
was also a WAR and they used real weapons there too.

Perhaps people believe that since the US federal government has the fire
power to blow up the world X times over, that we have no chance, and that
the 2nd amendment is therefore moot. I used to think the same thing. In
fact, this was the major if not the only lasting upshot of the Cold War! the
Cold war wasn't about one opposing ideology against the other; it wasn't
about the East vs. the West. In the end, it was about the respective
governments against their own peoples. The Cold War resulted in the
repression of the peoples in those countries, and likewise, of peoples
around the world.

But, it is still a myth that the US citizens are powerless against their
government, a government that has become tyrannical and has usurped our
democratic rights. We are not powerless against it. If we get organized and
armed, and form a force of hundreds of thousands, we can overcome this
government, or pose enough of a threat to have power. The government cannot
drop a nuclear bomb on DC. It cannot risk the lives of whole cities, without
revealing its own contradictions that is. Further, there is no guarantee
that the military will remain loyal to a government that continually reveals
itself as imperialistic and ruthless and having no real concern for its own
personnel. The Iraqi occupation is teaching many of them that hard lesson.
They are realizing that not Hussein, but the Bush regime, is their real
enemy.

So I ask you, isn't it time that left-leaning liberals and leftists
exercised their 2nd amendment rights and got organized and prepared? Isn't
it time, before it's too late? Isn't it time, before another Bush coup and
the following four years of increased repression and economic ruin?

We should remain committed to the absolute condemnation of individual acts
of violence or terrorism. Read Trotsky's essay on
terrorism< http://socialist.csn.ul.ie/moit-1.html >,
in the political education
section< http://www.legitgov.org/political_education.html >of this
website. Our reference to Trotsky does not mean that we are
Marxists. I am merely referring to a good argument for any real
revolutionaries against terrorism. We want a democratic government, which is
not predicated on a Marxist state. In fact, we leave that to the future of
the new movement for democracy, given that the future should be democratic
and in a democracy, the people will decide. But, our goal is to make a
future wherein the people CAN and WILL decide!!!!!!
