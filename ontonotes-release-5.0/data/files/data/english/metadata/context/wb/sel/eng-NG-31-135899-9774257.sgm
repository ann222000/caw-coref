I know there were DESTERM, NOVATERM, andseveral others that could be used
via the unix/shell.  I tried em all and finally settled on DIALOGJE V2D
due to its huge editor size and.  I even use it for writing letters,
and keeping records in lieu of Speedscript, Poc wrtr series, and other
word
processorys.  Even TWS is'nt good enuff for me.

I always liked to use darkterm 4.0b on CBM bbs's in 64 mode, mostly
because it simply worked properly.

I liked UltraTerm III for the C128.  It's greatest shortcoming was no ANSI
mode.  For ANSI boards, I used DesTerm.  UltraTerm worked fine on CBM and
ASCII boards.

It also has a large capture buffer which can be edited, saved, loaded into,
sent over the modem, etc.  60 Kb if I remember correctly.

I used a PC for word processing.  Whenever I wanted a large CBM text file, I
would use the PC word processor to create it.  Then save as ASCII, transfer
it to the good ole C128 and convert it to PETSCII.  Just made an important
discovery.  The substitution of ole for old may have originated as a typo
that slipped by a proofreader.    ;-)

Little Red Reader on the C128 made it easy to combine transferring the file
and translating it into a single step.  As another side note on translation
methods, UltraTerm could also be used to translate either way between ASCII
and PETSCII.  Just load a file, translate it (a quick operation as
translation was done in memory), then save it.

For a small CBM text file I would use a text editor such as Ed Parry's Goofed
128 to create it on the CBM side of things.

Now, that's a name I haven't heard of in a long time! Ed Parry. As a
matter of fact I met him when he sold me some of the last C= things he
had. He gave me his issue of the Twin Cities Compendium book. It had his
scribbles all over it. :-)

As Snogpitch said, it was available on GEnie.  I got it in the distribution
archive for EBBS 128.  There was also a C64 version that was distributed with
EBBS 64.  Below is a brief description.

Goofed.128 runs on a C128 in either 80 or 40 column mode.  It was released
by Ed Parry as freeware in 1990.  Documentation is internal.

Goofed is a line based text editor.  It has built-in directory and DOS wedge
functions.  Word-wrap is automatic and adjustable from 20 to 254 columns.

I can send it as an email attachment.  If you, or anyone else, would like a
copy, either leave a message here, or de-spam my email address and send an
email request.  It is about 19 Kb in size.

I never met Ed in person, but I registered my copy of EBBS 128 with him, and

Thanks for looking that up.  I thought about looking up the address(es) last
night but I was in a hurry.    :-)

BTW, the C128 version is posted to comp.binaries.cbm occasionally as part of
the &quot;One From The Vault&quot; series.  (Last time was Sept. 1st, 2006.)

Gee, I slipped and reposted it again completely coincidentally. Wonders

If you can't locate your copy, you should be able to pick it up from Maurice

Do you mean weird as in unearthly, or as in strange?    ;-)    If I remember

Weird as in strange. :-)

I had understood he worked in a financial intitution... at least that is
what I remember he telling me back in 1989 when I finally met him in
person. He lived in in San Fernando Valley, Ca.
I don't recall if it was Panorama City or somewhere around there.

I started calling his board and others in the San Fernando Valley area
since 1985.
