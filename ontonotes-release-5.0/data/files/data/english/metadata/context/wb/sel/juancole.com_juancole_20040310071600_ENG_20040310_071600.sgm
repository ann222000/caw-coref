US Press as "Stenographers" for Bush War

Reuters reports that the University of Maryland's Center for
International and Security Studies released a report on Tuesday slamming
the US press for not questioning the arguments put forward by the Bush
administration for war, and acting as a virtual stenographer for the
White House.

Interestingly, Susan Moeller, the author of the report, argued that "
The 'inverted pyramid' style of news writing, which places the most
'important' information first, produced much greater attention to the
administration's point of view on WMD issues at the expense of
alternative perspectives ."

I suppose she means that in an American context, whatever the
president says would always go in the first paragraph, and Scott
Ritter's comments would come several paragraphs down--even though Ritter
knew what he was talking about with regard to Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, and Bush did not.

The inverted pyramid style is favored in US journalism, but is not
necessarily used in other countries. French news columns often are more
essayistic, and likewise Arabic news. I spent a year one time mainly
putting Arabic-language wire reports into English and arranging them in
inverted pyramid form, which is not how they arrived.

While it may be appealing to journalists to try to blame the form of
their writing for such lapses, however, there are many better
explanations in my view.

1) The US print press is largely a capitalist press, which means you
are trying to sell newspapers. (The old saw was that "Anyone can own a
newspaper, all you need is a million dollars.) That makes it a reader's
press, not a writer's. You have to give readers what they want, or else
they won't plunk down their 50 cents. If the mood of the country is such
that 85% of the people are supporting a war in Iraq, challenging the
need for that war could make the newspaper unpopular and its sales might
plummet. Advertisers could also pull their ads from an "unpatriotic"
rag.

2) Journalists thrive on access. If you anger the Bush
administration, then you are likely to be completely cut off from leaks.
There is a strong incentive not to call Bush administration officials
liars, if you have to deal with them every day and hope to get more than
platitudes from them. This is why Paul Krugman, who is in Princeton and
writes abstract analysis of policy that does not depend on insider
sources, is such a brilliant dissector of the dishonesty and hypocrisy
of the Bushies. He can tell them to jump in the lake.

3) Journalists are mostly generalists. They are talented at pulling
information about a new subject out of the experts and putting it
together coherently. I worked for a newspaper once and so know a little
about how hectic their lives are, and what new challenges they face
every day. But the fact is that most American journalists in the fall of
2002 had no idea what Iraq was like, or what a Shiite was, or the
difference between an ayatollah and a grand ayatollah. They had no
independent means of gauging whether Iraq had a nuclear weapons program
or not, and had to go by what the experts said. If you don't follow a
place like Iraq for thirty years, as I have, you don't have a good sense
of what is plausible and what is not. Then, how do you tell what an
expert is? Judith Miller of the NYT thought Ahmad Chalabi looked like an
expert--he was a major expatriate Iraqi politician. Khidir Hamza, a
former Baathist nuclear scientist looked like an expert. I think the
journalists' preference for powerful "insiders" as sources is a problem
with the trade. In this case, Scott Ritter was the better source, and
even he exaggerated Iraqi WMD.

4) Journalists are often part of the political establishment
themselves. Judith Miller is a Neocon who co-authored with the highly
unreliable Laura Mylroie, and so was predisposed to buy the nonsense she
was fed by Chalabi and his contexts. (The NYT seems to have a fair
number of Neocons on its staff, for a supposedly liberal newspaper).

5) Journalism does not practice, or sometimes sufficiently respect,
peer review. As editor of the International Journal of Middle East
Studies for Cambridge University Press, when I receive an article on
Iraq I send it out to five or so of the major experts on Iraq in
universities. If they all come back and say it is weak in evidence and
argument, I don't publish it. This way of proceeding ensures that
articles in my journal are solid. There is no time to referee newspaper
articles, though some national magazines, like The Nation, do excellent
fact checking. We can contrast academic peer review to the practice at
think tanks. The American Enterprise Institute just publishes the book,
without peer review. It publishes books that push or support policies to
which the think tank is dedicated. This is why silly books like those of
Mylroie or Khidir Hamza can see print, and sometimes even sell well.
Some journalists do not know the difference between a solid book by
Peter Sluglett on Iraq, published by a major academic press, and some
screed put out of a Washington think tank by someone who does not know
Arabic and has never been in an archive. (I hasten to add that there are
lots of real intellectuals in the ranks of journalists, and there are
even many former academics, who know these distinctions all too well,
but I believe they are a minority). Lee Bollinger at Columbia University
is thinking seriously about how this sort of problem could be solved by
tinkering with the degree program in journalism there.

I have to say that often when I watch television or read the
mainstream press, and I see this parade of self-proclaimed "experts" who
say the damnedest things, I feel like Alice in Wonderland. No such
shoddy rhetoric or posturing could be gotten away with in my department,
but here are people who make literally hundreds of thousands of dollars
from peddling unsound information.

The rise of expert and journalistic blogging, and the way it is
interacting with professional journalism, may well change these dynamics
a bit. Blogging needn't be a capitalist enterprise, and where it is not,
it can afford to be more writerly. It can tell readers things at some
length that are too complex or controversial for the print media. It can
allow voices to be heard that contradict whoever the White House
spokesman is that year. It should not be overestimated as a force for
change. It is still a relatively minor phenomenon. But at the margins it
may begin making a difference.
