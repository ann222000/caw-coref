Here is the scenario:

The population of earth is 4 billion.
There are 4 religions, Religion "A", "B", "C", and "D"
Each religion has 1 billion follower.

Every religion claims they are right and the others one are wrong. And
the right religion believers will end up in heaven, while the rest will
end up in hell despite their actions in life (good or bad).

And here is the judgement day comes and god comes from the sky or from
among us and say the following: "Here I am! Religion C is right. Thus,
all its followers will end up in heaven..while the rest will be
examined and most probably end up in hell...."

So is that fair? how can we blame that innocent mother from religion B?
She thought that she believed in the right religion all along....in
fact she was born with it... so why should she not be guranteed to
heaven? While that person believed in religion C and sinned many times,
but they are forgiven.

Let me know what you think.

The scenario pretty much sums up the history of religion in general. But as a scenario it makes it impossible to believe that it is a good one if the goal is the salvation of the world.
In the old days it was the Catholics condemning all the Protestants. Now it is the born-agains condemning every other kind of Christian. Persistent madness.

Good question.  The trouble with us is that we tend to think in terms
of right and wrong.

I think religious truth is fluid and may be shaped by the eye of the
devotee.

To actually behave in a Godly manner, however, requires being able to
rise above the divisivness of religion.

I think if we can do this, we will have arrived where we need to be.

I haven't really read sacred texts but isn't there the notion of
different Gods.
I know we can find it in Buddhism (Although as Nietsche says, following
his beliefs in Zarathustra, Buddhism is a way of life and he would'nt
downgrade it to the row of religion.)
In greek mythology there are several gods too, and even the good old
Celtics had several gods. so did the Romans.
I know that in the Bible there is also  several mentions of other gods,
but for christians you should love the Lord your God.
In Deuteronomy chapter 20 for instance,
"...18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, wich
they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the Lord your
God."

Now with this in perspective, every Religion can be right, just as the
gods can have a giggle at how man always was and always will be Stupid!

Thanks Anthropologus, I didn't think of this topic as "Theoretical
theology."
I was just acting like a fool finding the whole thing incoherent.
Your post made me act serious for some unknown reason.

"Which religion is right?" found its answer in the first post and is
probably the reason why not many people bothered answering it.
"C"
The first post also goes on with further questions:
"So is that fair?  How can we blame that innocent mother from religion
B?"
No it isn't fair, and We are not the ones blaming the innocent mother.
"So why should she not be guaranteed to heaven?"
The answer is above "the right religion believers will end up in
heaven, while the rest will end up in hell despite their actions in
life (good or bad). "

(As someone who has spent a great deal of time studying religion) This
is an oversimplification... to say that this represents the entire
history of religion simply isn't true. Hindus don't believe that
followers of all other religions will necessarily have a bad rebirth,
or that they are incapable of moksha (liberation, the ultimate goal of
Hinduism, sort of like nirvana in Buddhism). I know plenty of Muslims
that believe Hell is only temporary (eventually everyone goes to
heaven), and Christians and Jews can go straight there.  And whoever
quoted Nietzche about Buddhism not being a religion, I am pretty sure
it is. Part of it is just living a moderate, mindful lifestyle, but in
order to achieve nirvana one must be dedicated and have faith in the
teachings. Christianity is the only "big" religion I know of that
preaches that you can only be saved by following one religion, and
everyone else will go to Hell forever. I'm not even sure all Christians
believe this - even if Jesus is the only way to salvation, he doesn't
necessarily need to be worshipped in order to grant a person entrance
to Heaven.

So, like everything else, religion isn't simply A vs. B vs. C vs. D.

The question of multiple gods in Buddhism is complicated. Throughout
the Tipitaka, the Buddha makes clear that the devas do not deserve our
worship any more than other human beings, since they too are subject to
death and rebirth through the devastating cycle of karma. Prayer and
devotional worship to the devas are just a sign of more attachment to
the world. Thus, it isn't really a justification for other religions.

All I can say is that if, by some strange chance, I someday get to
Heaven and find a bunch of Christians still trying to get me to repent,
I'm going to ask to be reassigned to Hell where, at least, I'll have
agreeable company.

Not all Christian denominations believe you will go to Hell if you do
not follow them.

Mormonism, for want of a more convenient example, teaches that when
you die you will have a chance to repent your sins and be saved by
Christ. This handy piece of theological footwork explains the obvious
inequality of a denomination like Catholicism, where people living in
(for example) deepest darkest Borneo may never even hear the name of
Jesus Christ but still end up surfing the lake of fire with me, Bill
Hicks, and Hendrix on harp...

Yeah, I also believe in that too. There are many ways to reach God and it's
up to us to choose one. All religions should point out to God in the first
place. I don't believe that one religion is better than another. I do
believe we were born with "natural laws" written in our souls (or spirits,
as you wish) and these natural laws are the ones we must follow. We all know
you're not supposed to kill someone. Why's that? Because someone told you
so? Of course not. We all know that. It's wriiten on us.  That's something
you don't learn, you live.

No matter what path you choose, being good to others is all that matters.

Religion is just a tool to reach God. You can even reach Him without any
religion at all.

The key to be in touch with Him is your heart.
No strings attached.

Peace for you all.

I am the one who did a very bad quote of Nietzsche. Sporkubus was the
only one to point it out.
Whatever anybody thinks, he was still a great mind unlike me.
(Nietzsche, sporkubus I don't know?)
If you happened to read some of my later posts, I was playing "Acting
Stupid." because I didn't see the point and still don't really of this
post. Talking about religion  is probably the easiest way to upset
people who don't agree.
I must even admit that my quote was a very bad one too, and doesn't
resemble Nietzsche.
It is easy to deform things when you are acting stupid and take them
out of context.
I recommend  reading Philosophy and will now quote the out of context
quote. It is closer to what Nietzsche said but still remains out of
context (well sort of, because it is just thrown in) it may avoid
people doing stupider quotes than mine.
The quote I was thinking of is the one in "Why I Am So Wise." when
Nietzsche is talking about about Freedom from ressentiment.

"Ressentiment is the forbidden in itself for the invalid - his evil:
unfortunately also his most natural inclination. -This was grasped by
that profound physiologist Buddha. His 'religion', which one would do
better to
call a system of hygiene so as not to mix it up with such pitiable
things as Christianity, makes its effect dependant on victory over
ressentiment: to free the soul of that - first step to recovery."

I have 2 previous Posts, One really Stupid, One slightly less stupid
where I tried to be serious.
And this post still has stupidity in it because I don't really like
talking about religion and spirituality.
My problem is that I thought this seemed like an interesting place to
post because whatever we post we can never really be right.
I don't want to remove my stupid comments, I like them, if in society
we got rid of stupidity, there would be a lot less things on TV, a lot
less books to read, a lot less music and life would probably be even
more boring than it can be at times.
I am sorry if my posts offended anybody, glad if I got giggles.
I must admit that religion isn't my brightest subject.

Sporkubus, please clarify your statement:  Quote: "And whoever quoted
Nietzche about Buddhism not being a religion, I am pretty sure it is."
... As much there's a lot to be specified in regards each religious
dogmas, the definition of religion is just one.    I am curious to have
your undertsanding in regards to your statement above.   Is Buddhism a
religion? Is it really?  Also, please clarify if you see Himduism as a
religion.

Your "enlightment" is apporeciated.  A different approach to my views
is always welcomed.

Good topic.  I've enjoyed reading all the comments.  The premise to me
states the conundrum that any thinking person on a spiritual path faces
when trying to reconcile a religious practice with a spiritual
philosophy.  I think that's where the truth lies.  Spiritual
enlightenment is not furthered by religious tenents.  It does not,
however, invalidate the fact that most humans find spiritual truth
through the practice of some organized set of beliefs.  For instance, I
pray every day to some form of a Christian God.  I know that all forms
of Christianity have tenents with which I do not agree, but without
prayer, my chances of growing are severely lessened.  We are limited as
humans, in our ability to perceive the infinite in our finite state.
We have to create imperfect rules to help us keep stumbling along.  I
think that as long as we understand the imperfect nature of our efforts
and keep an open mind, the danger of using our particular religion's
dictates to condemn those who don't believe as we do is negated.

A number of years ago I read William James "Variety of Religious
Experiences"  It affected me profoundly at the time to discover that we
really are all chasing the same thing and that it is only the imperfect
rules of the religion we choose through nothing more profound than the
accident of birth that causes the problem.

I know very few people who "religiously" follow the rules of their
chosen religion or really believe that your soul is lost for not having
like beliefs.  I prefer to believe this is a result of the fact that
the spiritual in all of us acknowledges the imperfections of our own
particular groups' crude attempts to codify the unknowable

The fact is the debate is meaningless to further our real goal.  But
the question is good to review on a regular basis to renew our
understanding of true unity with all faiths.

Ahh the old god has sent prophets since time began.  Well where are
they now?  Which religion is right? none of them.  Each and every one
of them is a creation of a story teller around a campfire who couldn't
answer the question, "What are the stars and who created them?"   And
from this the world went to hell in a hand basket.  Religions were born
and have been the nemesis of mankind ever since.  Religion does not
promote happiness it generates the worst in people.  Nothing good has
ever come from a religion. Goodness comes from people who help others
without pushing a religious belief on them.  If you believe there is a
god then why on earth do you need a religion to validate him or here
whatever.  The problem with religions is that they promote greed.
Greed in money and greed in controlling the minds of those who just
want to be left alone.

&gt; &gt; the right religion believers will end up in heaven, while the rest will
&gt; &gt; end up in hell despite their actions in life (good or bad).

&gt; &gt; And here is the judgement day comes and god comes from the sky or from
&gt; &gt; among us and say the following: &quot;Here I am! Religion C is right. Thus,
&gt; &gt; all its followers will end up in heaven..while the rest will be
&gt; &gt; examined and most probably end up in hell....&quot;

&gt; &gt; So is that fair? how can we blame that innocent mother from religion B?
&gt; &gt; She thought that she believed in the right religion all along....in
&gt; &gt; fact she was born with it... so why should she not be guranteed to
&gt; &gt; heaven? While that person believed in religion C and sinned many times,
&gt; &gt; but they are forgiven.

&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think.

In a moment of time in a discussion about god in a war zone someone
once asked me. "What if god were insane?"  It's a heavy thought and if
you consider the reasoning behind wars, no matter who has it, that's a
hell of a question.

&gt; God is an illusion.
&gt; All the followers from religions a,b,c and d will die and will not go

&gt; How could such a god allow such a state of affairs to exist?

Insanity can only be defined by comparison to one's peers.
Eg if everyone on earth thought they were called Hitler then the one
person in the world who thought his name was Nigel would be insane.
As god is (by most definitions) peerless then his behaviour is beyond
comparison.
Anyway, everyone knows god is dead.

One cannot be dead if they never existed in the first place.
