Sen. Larry Craig is alleged to have engaged in oral sex in a Union
Station stall. He didn't climax. No surprise there.

By Jason Cherkis Posted: September 12, 2007

Theres only one story in the saga of Sen. Larry Craig that involves
actual dick-sucking, and it happens to be set in Union Station.

The tale involves an anonymous 40-year-old ex-Republican. Since
August of 2004, this man has claimedin digitally altered audio, of
courseto have had a very frustrating few minutes with the senator
in Union Stations mens rooms. He alleged that he twice tried to get
it on with Craig. In both instances, the trysts were interrupted
when the stalls started filling up.

But still. Just about every news organization from MSNBC to the
Washington Post has picked up the story. They generally hide behind
an attribution to a suddenly famous blogger, Mike Rogers, who has
reported extensively on these aborted hookups. At this point, pretty
much any piece on the Craig situation must reference the
train-station-restroom moment, as in this recent piece from the
Post: Rogers disclosed in October that he had spoken with men who
said theyd had sexual encounters with Craig, including in the
restrooms at Union Station.

The reportorial overkill has amped up the romance factor at Union
Station.

Imagine the thrill of itgetting off in a nearly 100-year-old historic
building with its 96-foot-high barrel-vaulted, coffered ceilings
adorned with 70 pounds of 22-karat gold leaf. Theres fast food too,
so you get a blowjob and Sbarro. Sexy.

Wrong. There are other places to take up Craigs legacy. Safer places.

Cleaner places. Places with just as much historic significance.
Were talking park land. Go wide-stance it in the great outdoors.

Union Station is not for amateurs.

1. The Kid Factor

Uncle Steve? Where are you? a boy says from a stall.

The middle, repliesIm guessingUncle Steve.

Im here, the boy says. Are you the one with the key [ring]? he asks.

Yes, Uncle Steve says. See the one?

Thats you? the boy says.

Thats me, Uncle Steve says.

Kids go to Union Station. Its a fact. They are tourists. They are
hanging out at the food court or the shitty movie theater. Kids go
to the bathroom.

When kids go, theyre not quiet about it. They will insist on talking
to Uncle Steve, or theyll gasp at the sight of a badly picked stall.
Kids will do play-by-play. They will complain about the poop and
the smell. Thats what kids do.

A 38-year-old man who wants to be called Charlie tells me one night
while sitting alone at DC Eagle, a bar on New York Avenue NW, that
hes been arrested three times for messing around in publicin Mesa,
Ariz., Long Beach, Calif., and Arlington. He doesnt seem to care
about his criminal record. He says hes a socialist and just likes
the thrill of fucking in public. But Union Station, Charlie says,
is off-limits. No one does it there, he claims. Because its full
of breeders and kids. Who wants to get hard in front of kids?

There are two public mens roomsthe Gate A bathroom is upstairs; the
other is downstairs near the Johnny Rockets.

Its around 9 p.m. in the food-court stalls. A boy and his father
take up the stall next to me. The kid starts goofing off, drawing
a reprimand from Dad.

No means no, says the father. A lesson for us all?

2. Passengers Prefer to Dump at the Station

I am being cruised.

Our eyes catch for a second. I am washing my hands for no real
reason. Hes staring up from a urinal.

He is wearing jeans, an all-american jersey T-shirt, and a ballcap
fixed over his short brown hair. He has an empty-looking backpack
slung over his shoulders like its the first day of school.

He follows me out onto Union Stations concourse and walks to the
nearest trash can.

Pause.

He walks past a row of empty seats.

Pause.

He walks past where I am standing outside Hudson News.

Pause.

And then he disappears back into the Gate A mens room.

A minute or two passes before he is back outside pausing among the
tourists, commuters, and homeless crowding the concourse. This time,
Backpack Boy stands 5 feet from me, inside Hudson News. He could
stare at the floor-to-ceiling rack of Harry Potter books or back
at the bathrooms comings and goings. He stares at the bathroom,
goes back inside and parks it at his original urinal.

Maybe hes killing time before boarding the 8:30 Regional to New
York. Maybe hes waiting to pick up his girlfriend. Its possible hes
working off his Sbarro.

Or he could just be cruising.

I jot down the action in my notebook. Before I can finish, the guy
disappears. Game over. There are just too many people around.

People still like to ride trains, despite the cost and the Acela
debacle and the fact that the bagel with cream cheese is a stale
bagel with cream cheese.

They believe in Amtraks All Aboard slogan and cheesy train names
like the California Zephyr, the Texas Eagle, and the Empire Builder.
Until we Americans invent a teleporter or solve the traffic problem,
32 million people will continue to pass through Union Station each
year.

From 7:30 to 7:40 p.m. on this night, 28 men go to the Gate A
restroom.

Even when Union Station appears dead, the bathroom is not. Between
8:45 and 8:55 p.m. on a Wednesday, the Gate A stalls receive 22
visitors, a lot of them still wearing Hill laminates around their
necks. And half the stalls were closed down for their daily scrubbing.

This aint like the attendance for that last workforce protections
subcommittee hearing. Bathrooms are different. Everyone has to go
sometime.

No matter how much you want to hook up, the odds are just daunting.

Take Backpack Boy. Chances are he didnt succeed that night, and he
seems like an experienced cruiser. I noticed him only because Im
assigned to camp out there. To take notes and stuff. Maybe he was
another reporter.

3. You Will Get Pee on Your Kenneth Coles

In Union Stations stalls, there are tons of excuses to get handsy.
Just look down.

A large black comb wrapped in what appears to be used TP, a Miller
Lite can three-quarters empty, a plastic bottle of Smirnoff premium
triple distilled vodka (one swig left), one bag of cheddar-flavored
Goldfish (unopened!), one pair of jeans (dirty), one stubbed cig,
a Hdagen-Dazs soda cup (empty), one giant TP donut, and one turd
smear.

Some people complain. Like the guy at the urinal across from me on
a Saturday night: Damn. Faggot fuck. Shit. Ahh, fuck.Nasty motherfucker.

Then I hear the sound of spit hitting urinal water. A moment later,
the guy who takes the stall next to mine says:

Shit out on the toilet seat. Cant they [have] respect for what they
do? He toughs it out in that stall.

Still horny?

4. You Will Hurt

You want instant gratification? Theres no instant gratification
here. Youre gonna have to wait. That means squatting in a stall.

I take one on the Wednesday after the Labor Day holidaymore than
enough time for lonely dudes to get horned-up, I figure. At the
food-court bathroom, all the good stalls are taken. There are five.
Im left with the one that doesnt flush. Lucky me, there are no
floaters and only limited pee splash on the seat. I wipe it down
thoroughly and take up my position. Its 5:05 p.m., just in time for
the commuter rush. Im feeling lucky.

Seven minutes in, my feet start to tingle and go numb, like theyre
made out of Nerf. The guy in the stall to my left is popping pills.
The guy to my right is doing some serious toe-curling. I start
longing for the sound of the hand dryer. The hand dryer is my friend,
my little white noise machine. It has the power to drown out both
sound and smell.

Someone yells through the door: Rapido! then claps his hands. This
is met with sniffles and moans. Fuck you, man. Were working here.

Fifteen minutes in. I cant feel my feet at all. I try to shake the
ice out of my right foot. Instead, the numbness spreads up my calf.

After a half-hour, I get the idea I should stand up and stretch.

Immediately, I get the sensation of falling. I come within an inch
of dipping ass into the bowl. At the last moment, I grip the top
of the stall door.

Notebook and other stuff fall on the floor, inches from pee drops
and toilet paper nubbin.

I start to get concerned that the guy next to me is jerking off.
He stopped pissing a long time ago. Yet he is still in the stall,
feet facing the toilet. I can see his hairy toes through his sandals.
There is the curling, still, and a final intensity. After a while,
I start to get paranoid. Every sound, every movement seems dirty.
Why are they leaving me out of the good times?

Hairy Toes, a few minutes later, is back in his stall. I hear a
soft, sputtery trickle, and then hes gone. He doesnt wash his hands.
My left foot is an ice block. My forehead starts to sweat.

After nearly an hour, I discover several peepholes.

The TP rack must have been there. Now its just the holes where the
screws were. I can see into the next stall. This occupies some time.
A bonus.

I see a sunset of TP and then pants, then fumbling of pants and a
blur of arm and arm hair. No dick. No blowjob.

Ten minutes later, I realize farts can travel through peepholes.
It is overwhelming. For several seconds, I cant breathe. Or rather,
choose not to.

After an hour and a half, I have to get up. I do so slowly this
timelesson learned. I do lunges, pressing my right foot against the
back of the toilet.

Then I do left foot against the toilet. I do mini windmills. I skip
the part where I touch my toes. Im feeling better.

I hear a cops radio: All agents ready. Stand by. I think theyve
found me.

Another 15 minutes go by before I notice that my heart is racing,
the pain in my right foot has spread to my butt cheeks. Claustrophobia
kicks in. I remind myself that the slit between stall and door is
maybe the diameter of a dime.

Amid boredom and paranoia, I start thinking about Hairy Toes and
how sandals are just a bad idea. I am alone except for the sound
of water running from a sink.

A janitor arrives. I sit up, peel the streamer of TP off my ass,
button up my pants, and stumble out. You want a sure thing? Try the
jalapeqo-cheddar bagel at Au Bon Pain.

5. The After-Hours Party

Saturday at around 11 p.m.the stalls fill up with mumblers with
carts, old coats and work pants, gray goatees, and canes. No walking,
talking Abercrombie ads here.

Were all friends. Or friendly enough to start talking on cell phones
and kill more than a half-hour on the can. Let a giant TP donut
roll to the edge of the stall. Fuck it. Steal it. Who cares?

People bring their stuff, fill the stall up with it. A day or two
later, a guy uses the stall to count his earnings, dropping change
into a plastic bag.

I can see his wad of singles. Not a bad take. Ive seen a man park
his cart inside the bathrooms entrance like its a handicap spot.

Tonight feels like the saddest after-hours party in the city. After
a whilea reasonable period of timeI get up, leave the revelers, and
wait outside.

Back inside, a man with a cane sees me standing, waiting for a stall
and flips out. I dont quite understand him. Hes mad at me for simply
wanting to take his stall.

I see him again outside. He waves his cane at me. He tells me that
hed fuck me up good if it wasnt for the fact that his legs are bad.
Im pretty sure I could have taken his cane.

End of night tally: I am offered weed, Jordache jeans, and a really
complicated story from a dude about needing $12 to prevent the cops
from seizing his car. He tells me his name. It sounds like he said,
Everybody calls me Drill. I am not offered a blowjob or any anonymous
drilling.

6. Everything Changed After 9/11

There are cameras everywhere. There are three on the way to the
food-court mens room. One eyeball is focused directly on the entrance.
You could be recorded on one of those cameras.

The authorities keep the tapes for a month or so, says Donald Lantz,
senior executive vice president of IPC International Corporation,
the private security firm that patrols the food-court and shops.

Do you think you can sweat it out for a month? Think IPC International
Corporation is just fancy for rent-a-cop agency? Think again,
Senator.

The officers of the IPC wear crisp white shirts with patches and
flat drill-sergeant-style hatswhat the industry calls Campaign Hats
(they sell for $60 a popthats no joke). They also carry radios and
clipboards.

Before they can set one shiny boot in Union Station, the officers
go through 48 hours of training that includes foot patrol, CPR,
report writing, and fire suppression. But where do mens fantasies
come in?

Does it cover bathroom stuff? I ask Lantz. It would, he says.

Just past midnight on Monday, I am sitting in the Gate B section
when I hear a disturbance coming from the mens room. It sounds like
two men yelling.

IPC white shirts rush over. Amtrak cops zip to it on Segways. They
separate the two men. A man in sweatpants complains about St. Es,
not getting his meds or getting the wrong meds, and that there are
people outside the building who want to kill him. He is let go.

The other, a slightly Eurotrash-looking man, is ordered to stay and
have a seat at the closed Sbarro. Plainclothes, a police dog, more
Amtrak cops, and more IPC dudes appear. His license is taken. He
is questioned.

(Photograph by Darrow Montgomery)

Im sorry, the man pleads to an Amtrak cop. I didnt mean it.

They let him stew for a good 30 minutes. IPC staff takes a Polaroid
of him.

Amtrak police let him go.

The mans crime: pissing against a wall downstairs in the food court,
which was closed. The camera caught him. The police just happened
to find him in the upstairs bathroom with the ranting, missing-meds
guy.

The pissing man would return a short while later with a woman. Both
look upset, traumatized. Theyve come to get that Polaroid destroyed.
After pleading their case to IPC staff, they leave claiming everything
is OK.

Yeah, right.

The man, Lantz says, a few days later via phone, has been potentially
barred from Union Station. Eventually hell be able to be there
again, he explains. But not in the near future.

While you contemplate how to explain to your constituents that you
are temporarily banned from a 100-year-old historic building, there
is one bit of good news you should know.

Lantz reports that there are no cameras in the mens rooms. Only
peepholes.

7. Mike Rogers

Do the math.

Gay activist and blogger Mike Rogers has been following Craigs
travels with a jizz mop since he first got that tip about a Union
Station blowjob in August 2004.

Rogers took his materials to Idaho. The Idaho Statesman had been
investigating Craigs alleged homosexuality since last fall. And
what did they find? One college classmate who claimed the senator
came on to him, one anonymous man who claimed Craig had cruised him
at an REI, and the original Union Station man. Thats it.

It took me two years and two months to build a story, Rogers says.
To do research, to travel. I went to Boise. I went to Seattle. I
went to Columbus.

The first thing I did was do research on Sen. Craigabout a half a
day, Rogers explains, adding that he Googled the anonymous Union
Station man to check him out.

Of his source: We had a long e-mail relationship and then a phone
relationship. To begin with, he called me from a phone with caller
ID that matched the name. I knew when I read who he was that I was
familiar with his work.

But Rogers admits hes not really a reporter. I used techniques, and
Im convinced. I have a different standard than you. I dont have [an
editor] standing over [me] saying I need more evidence.

Rogers describes his style as unconventional. Not bad, he says. Not
good. Just different. I do a different kind of a reporting than the
mainstream media.

Even with the unconventional methods and the reliance on anonymous
sources, Rogers could produce only one source for the Statesmans
expose on Craig. So far this anonymous man has not gone public with
his identity. And Rogers adds that since the story broke, no one
else has come forward to claim theyve commingled with Craig.

What does this mean for you? A man who doesnt adhere to the reporting
standards of the mainstream media needs another story.

&quot;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight
you, then you win.&quot;
