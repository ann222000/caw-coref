Senate Begins All-Night Session of Iraq War Policy Debate

By Nicholas Johnston

July 18 (Bloomberg) -- The Senate began a marathon debate on the
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq as Democrats forced a rare
overnight session to pressure Republicans to back legislative efforts
to end the war.

Cots were rolled into a room near the Senate chamber and food was
prepared as senators took part in a night of debate that Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid pledged would last past dawn.

``We have no choice but to stay in session and to continue to speak
out on behalf of our troops and all Americans,'' Reid, a Nevada
Democrat, said last night.

Democrats and Republicans are at odds over amendments to defense
policy legislation, including one calling for a withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Iraq beginning within 120 days. Reid wants amendments
related to Iraq to be able to pass with a simple majority, while
Republicans demand 60 votes for passage, as is sometimes required
under Senate rules.

Democrats said they will use the overnight session to capitalize on
growing Republican unease with a war that has lasted longer than four
years and resulted in the deaths of more than 3,600 U.S. troops.

`Won't Stop'

``We won't stop fighting until we end this war; that's what tonight is
all about,'' Reid told an anti-war rally last night across the street
from the Capitol, where he was joined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
and other Democratic members of Congress.

Republicans criticized the overnight session as a political stunt.
``It may be healthy debate,'' White House spokesman Tony Snow told
reporters yesterday. ``It's also likely to be theatrical.''

The overnight debate will lead to a procedural vote this morning on a
troop withdrawal amendment sponsored by Democratic Senators Carl Levin
of Michigan and Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Under Senate rules, 60
senators will have to vote to end debate and bring the amendment to a
final vote.

Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the all- night
session was unlikely to change any minds and he was ``optimistic''
Republicans would stick together in the morning to prevent Democrats
from getting the needed votes to move ahead with the withdrawal
measure.

`Bad Theater'

``We're going to be subjected to theater tonight and bad theater at
that,'' he told reporters.

Democrats, who control the chamber 51-49, say they are short of the 60
votes required. Only three Republicans, Olympia Snowe of Maine, Gordon
Smith of Oregon and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, have signaled their
support.

``We must find a new way forward,'' said Smith, who faces re-election
next year.

The withdrawal amendment would require U.S. troops to begin leaving
Iraq within 120 days of the measure's adoption and that the
redeployment be completed by April 30, 2008. Some forces involved in
counter-terrorism operations or the training of Iraqi troops could
remain under the measure.

``It is the only amendment that will bring this war to a responsible
end,'' said Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat.

A Letter

In a letter to Senate Sergeant-At-Arms Terrance Gainer, Reid yesterday
requested the beds that were set up in a room near the Senate chamber
for senators to use. Reid wrote he may hold ``live quorum calls''
during the night, which could require the sergeant-at-arms to
``request, and if necessary, compel the attendance of absent
senators.''

The first of such votes to instruct the sergeant-at-arms, at
approximately 8:30 p.m. Washington time last night, failed 44-47, with
nine senators missing the vote.

Earlier, the Senate voted 94-3 in favor of an amendment expressing the
sense of the Senate that it isn't in the national security interests
of the U.S. to let Iraq become a safe haven for terrorists.
