&lt;&lt;His life has been found to mirror the evolution of The Bard's works
so precisely that the authors believe that it cannot be dismissed as
coincidence. In the history plays, Neville's ancestors - for
instance, Richard Nevil, the Earl of Warwick in Henry VI, Part II -
are described with an accuracy that could have been written only by
someone with Neville's knowledge. His ancestors, such as John of
Gaunt, in Richard II, are always mentioned sympathetically. The authors
have unearthed in Lincolnshire's Public Record Office a notebook of
1602 belonging to Neville while he was imprisoned in the Tower of
London. Crucially, they say, it includes background notes for the
procession in Henry VIII some 11 years before the play was produced.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
Was that before or after Henry VIII's actual procession?
------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;They also discovered that, as a director of the London Virginia
Company, a trading venture, Neville had access to a 20,000-word letter
detailing the Bermuda shipwreck of 1609, &quot;a base&quot; for The Tempest
two years later. Shakespeare could not have known of this letter, they
say, as releasing it might have devalued the shares in the Virginia
Company.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
The Strats needn't worry since
they can always reference Kositsky &amp; Stritmatter.
------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Such evidence was strengthened by Neville's letters,

dedication to Shakespeare's sonnets.&gt;&gt;

ONE WHOLE CLUE!!!!
------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;After seven years of research she contacted Professor Rubinstein of
University College Wales and an Associate of The Shakespeare Authorship
Trust, a body set up to provide a &quot;neutral forum&quot;. Although
agnostic in the authorship debate, he agreed to co-write the book. He
told The Times yesterday: &quot;The coincidences of Neville's dates and
the chronology of the plays are so overwhelming, they are compelling in
themselves. There are no awkward bits.&quot;&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
But there are ALWAYS awkward bits!!!
------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Shakespeare had no Court experience and did not apparently ever visit
the Continent - yet his writings show him deeply familiar with court
life, Elizabethan high politics and Italy and France.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
But Shakspere had extensive small claims Court experience
and he was also inContinent...hence the dung pile.
------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;In contrast, Neville, an almost exact contemporary of Shakespeare
(1564-1616), travelled extensively to the Continent, visiting various
places that featured in the plays.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
Henry probably returned home and told Will EVERything!
------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;From 1601-03 Neville was imprisoned in the Tower for his part
in an attempt to overthrow the Queen. Professor Rubinstein said
that the trauma - &quot;his head was almost chopped off&quot; - would
explain the seminal change in the plays, when he moved
from comedies and histories to tragedies and problem plays;
a break unexplained in Shakespeare's life.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
Based upon the DROESHOUT, Shakspere's head WAS chopped off
...which explains why Titus Andronicus was written so early.

--------------------------------------------------------
Now Falstaff gets the role of man who wrote Shakespeare
By Dalya Alberge, Arts Correspondent
_The Times_ October 05, 2005

&lt;&lt;ENTER stage left: a dramatic new candidate for the authorship
of Shakespeare's plays. The real author of the works that
have been attributed to William Shakespeare for more than
400 years has beenunmasked, according to research.

A book to be published this month by a leading academic publisher,
with a foreword by Mark Rylance, the artistic director of the Globe,
will claim that the greatest plays and verse in the English language
were written by Sir Henry Neville (c1562-1615). He was a leading
Elizabethan figure, though a minor character in today's history books.

Whether Shakespeare's Stratford-on-Avon birthplace will be consigned
to a tourists' backwater, and the vast publishing industry devoted
to him condemned to pulp, remains to be seen, but the authors,
the academics Brenda James and William Rubinstein, are in no
doubt that they have finally uncovered the 'real Bard'.

They say that Neville, a rotund man nicknamed 'Falstaff'
by close friends, had the *virtue* - unlike Shakespeare,
who lacked an appropriate background - of being an educated
man of culture, a courtier and a well-travelled linguist.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------
&quot;is there no *vertue* extant?&quot;
--------------------------------------------------------
[Henry the Fourth, Part One (1598 Quarto) 2.4]

Enter Falstaffe.

Poin. Welcome Iacke, where hast thou bin?

Falst. A plague of al cowards I say, and a vengeance too,
mar-ry and Amen: giue me a cup of sacke boy. Eare I lead
this life long, ile sow neatherstocks and mend them, and
foote them too. A plague of all cowards. Giue me a cup
of sacke rogue, is there no *vertue* extant?

he drinketh.

Prin. Didst thou neuer see Titan kisse a dish of butter,
pittifull harted Titan that melted at the sweet tale
of the sonnes, if thou didst, then behold that compound.

Falst. You rogue, heeres lime in this sacke too: there is no-
thing but rogery to be found in villanous man, yet a cowarde is
worse then a cup of sacke with lime in it. A villanous cowarde.
Go thy waies old Iacke, die when thou wilt, if manhood, good
manhood be not forgot vpon the face of the earth, then am I a
shotten herring: there liues not three good men vnhangde in
England, and one of them is fat, and growes old, God helpe the
while, a bad world I say, I would I were a weauer. I could sing
psalmes, or any thing. A plague of all cowards I say still.

Prin. How now *Wolsacke* , what mutter you?

Falst. A kings sonne, if I do not beat thee out of thy
kingdom with a dagger of lath, and driue all thy subiects
afore thee like a flock of wild geese, ile neuer weare
haire on my face more, you prince of Wales.
------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;M.H. Spielmann makes a revealing remark in his Studies in the First
Folio, 1924, as follows, speaking of the Woolman's age, his moustache:
'The portrait is no portrait at all: it shows us a sickly, decrepit
old gentleman, with a falling moustache, much more than fifty-two years
old. Had Shakspeare really been such in his last illness would the
London sculptor have so rendered him? Do sculptors, in their monuments,
represent the great departed in their dying state, pressing pillows to
their stomachs?' (Spielmann, see http) Of course if the effigy is of
John Shakspeare, he was an old gentleman indeed, and might have been
decrepit. He was seventy when he died. The 'pillow' was a woolpack,
any Englishman would have twigged to that.

Hal to Falstaff, 'How now, Woolsack?'

In 1725 the English Antiquarian artist George *Vertue*
engraved the Shakspeare monument for Alexander Pope's
edition of Shakespeare's plays.

This is the first time we are shown the figure of Shakspeare writing on
a cushion. But the figure is wearing the head of the well-known Chandos
portrait of Shakspeare, as all close observers agree, the nicely
trimmed-up head of a much younger man, nothing like the head that
Dugdale pictured, nor yet very much like the head as we see it today.
Vertue (not an eyewitness in 1725) ignores the published eyewitness
testimony of the Woolpack Man in Holy Trinity, and instead gives us
an imagined version of the monument, a sort of speculation perhaps,
a suggestion of how the monument might be improved if were to honor
a great poet, and not merely a gentleman of local renown.

*Vertue* also differs from the proved eyewitnesses in setting down
the inscription beneath the figure, entering new text both of words
and phrasing. Vertue's picture in Pope's edition is an invention,
being unlike the eyewitness images of the Woolpack Man, and also
unlike the monument as we see it today.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------
&quot;Is there no *Vertue* extant?&quot;
--------------------------------------------------------
[Henry the Fourth, Part One (Folio) 2.4]

Enter Falstaffe.

Poin. Welcome Iacke, where hast thou beene?

Fal. A plague of all Cowards I say, and a Vengeance
too, marry and Amen. Giue me a cup of Sacke Boy. Ere
I leade this life long, Ile sowe nether stockes, and
mend them too. A plague of all cowards. Giue me
a Cup of Sacke, Rogue. Is there no *Vertue* extant?

Prin. Didst thou neuer see Titan kisse a dish of Butter,
pittifull hearted Titan that melted at the sweete Tale of
the Sunne? If thou didst, then behold that compound.

Fal. You Rogue, heere's Lime in this Sacke too: there
is nothing but Roguery to be found in Villanous man; yet
a Coward is worse then a Cup of Sack with lime. A vil-
lanous Coward, go thy wayes old Iacke, die when thou
wilt, if manhood, good manhood be not forgot vpon the
face of the earth, then am I a shotten Herring: there
liues not three good men vnhang'd in England, &amp; one of

manner of songs. A plague of all Cowards, I say still.

Kingdome with a dagger of Lath, and driue all thy Sub-
iects afore thee like a flocke of Wilde-geese, Ile

In the hope of subtly pushing the Indecipherable Innes, the Infallible

Thanks Tom!

I'm not there - yet - but, who knows!

At least, this Neville fellow seems to have been a real flesh-and-blood
character unlike you know who.

But all seriousness aside, you make one comment -

The great conundrum for anti-Stratfordians is, inevitably, why the
secrecy?

- which is rooted in the Strat THEORY of the case.

A *theory* which mirrors the Queen Gertrude view of things as reflected
in her answer - &quot;Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.&quot; - to Prince
Hamlet's question, &quot;Do you see nothing there?&quot;

The audience, having just witnessed an exchange between the Ghost and
the Prince in the Queen's presence, *knows* that something doesn't
make sense - that *somebody* is mistaken in his/her perception of
reality.

If it is Prince Hamlet, then Shakespeare's play reduces, as it were, to
an early version of &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, with Queen
Gertrude cast as Nurse Ratched alias Orthodox Strazi scholar in
contemporary debate on the Authorship Issue.

Tom - I read your reaction, it's very good. It appears this book is a
different name, but the same old same old. I wonder if Brenda and
William will explain how busy Neville found the time to write the
plays? Like other writers, they probably have no knowledge about
theatre. Over at the Fellowship site, the usual gang are having hissy
fits. A live debate between Brenda and William vs Mark and Lynne or
Roger would be fun to watch. I wonder if Neville underlined passages
in his Bible too?

Jan Hendrik OORT (1900-1992), Dutch astronomer, proposed

they are occasionally deflected into the inner solar system
by gravitational perturbation from the passing of nearby stars.

You can do better than this crummy straw man statement. Why would one
expect any letters sent to Burghley (the bulk of his correspondance) or
letters to the Queen about money to contain any references to the
theater. Its possible if there were such letters Burghley burned them.

Whatever else you may think of &quot;Oxenford&quot;, you know quite well his
career demonstrated not only an intense interest in literature and
theater, but acumen as well.

This is totally disingenuous on your part.

BTW, where is ONE letter from Will expressing any literary interest, or
ANY interest? Where is ONE personal contemporary validation,
particulary from folks, like say, his COUSIN?

And don't give me the dedications to the narrative poems.

No, I don't know of anything in Oxenford's career that demonstrated &quot;an
intense interest in literature and the theater&quot;. He published a handful
of poems and wrote comedies or interludes for court performances. That
is a record consistent with gentlemanly dilettantism but indicates
nothing more. There is no sign that he took any interest in the
theatrical companies of which he was patron. Maybe literature and the
theater were in fact the great passions of his life, but they've left
nary a trace behind.

No, they are deserving of respect if they contain validity and points
worth considering. Intelligent design is a bad analogy. In and of
itself it has merit. I believe in it because as a great teacher I had
once said, &quot;the idea that the complexity of the world happened
haphazardly is akin to believing that a cyclone roared through a
junkyard and assembled a fully functional down to the last detail 747
airplane.&quot; The problem with intelligent design, which is not
incompatible with evolution, is that it is a stalking horse for
creationism and the religious right. The issue of &quot;how&quot; intelligent
design might work is a far more complex issue than the popular state of
the debate, and currently is hostage to political and religious
ideology.

If Price is so undeserving, why did Tennessee have her in their series?
And Stritmatter. Please give me a cogent answer to Stritmatter's
challenge on Venus and Adonis.

BTW, why is Veal's discussion on Neville on his blog &quot;scholarly&quot;, while

Excuse me. Your quote is
&quot;..not an iota
of interest in literature or the theater.&quot;

So the books he patronized, and supprted, the praise he received from
Spenser and others, and the commendations of his time, such as
Puttenham of course mean nothing. You, 400 years later, know better
than his peers. Of course for you, it has to be written down somewhere
explicitely and in detail to validate it.

But the fact vthat we don't even have a letter or significant piece of
writing or contemporary personal testamonial for Will of course is not
needed. He was &quot;middle class&quot; (Kathman) which somehow makes all the
difference. So the author of a giant best seller goes continually under
the radar.

How do you know what his relationship with his companies were? Go to
the SOS site and read Ever Reader #8, &quot;The Knight of the Tree of the
Sunne&quot;. It might provide a glimpse into what escapes the eye of mundane
historical myopia.

Contemporary praise for Oxenford's literary attainments is very mild;
dozens of other poets garnered as much. Books were dedicated to him in
the hope that he would give money to the authors. He probably did; many
other nobles did likewise. None of that demonstrates the &quot;intense
interest in literature and the theater&quot; that you hypothesize. Again, it
may have existed, but it can't be proven from the evidence.

This silence is significant, because a fairly large quantity of
evidence is extant. By contrast, relatively little material of any sort
survives about Shakespeare of Stratford, so silence means much less. It
happens, however, that the remnants include clear signs of his close
connections to the theater and explicit statements that he was an
author of note. That testimony (e. g., the First Folio, Jonson's
Timber, Davies' epigram, etc.) isn't as conclusive as
anti-Stratfordians desire (and I don't wish to spark another round of
debate about its merits), but it constitutes vastly more evidence of
literary and theatrical interests that all of Oxenford's papers
contain.

&gt; So the books he patronized, and supprted, the praise he received from
&gt; Spenser and others, and the commendations of his time, such as
&gt; Puttenham of course mean nothing. You, 400 years later, know better
&gt; than his peers. Of course for you, it has to be written down somewhere
&gt; explicitely and in detail to validate it.

&gt; But the fact vthat we don't even have a letter or significant piece of
&gt; writing or contemporary personal testamonial for Will of course is not
&gt; needed. He was &quot;middle class&quot; (Kathman) which somehow makes all the
&gt; difference. So the author of a giant best seller goes continually under
&gt; the radar.

&gt; How do you know what his relationship with his companies were? Go to
&gt; the SOS site and read Ever Reader #8, &quot;The Knight of the Tree of the
&gt; Sunne&quot;. It might provide a glimpse into what escapes the eye of mundane
&gt; historical myopia.

You have &quot;been involved in alternative and holistic supplements and

ago for which &quot;alternative and holistic supplements and approaches&quot; have
provided a general cure?

Genuine medicine has its successes. Do you remember when peptic ulcers
were the result of a chronic disease? Avoid stress; eat a bland diet;
drink your milk -- these became part of the maintenance program for this
chronic disease. There were medicines that could help somewhat, but no
cure, and thus there was room for &quot;alternative&quot; non-solutions. The
much-despised medical community now knows that most peptic ulcers are the
result of an infection that can be cured with antibiotics. Of course one
can still find &quot;alternative means&quot; to treat peptic ulcers, but even an
&quot;alternative&quot; healer ought to recommend that a person suffering from the
condition should see a real doctor and see if real medicine can help. If
nothing can help, then the choice of placebos may not matter much.

Intelligent design is not compatible with natural selection. It is not

the ALMO, which flows into the Tiber just below the walls of Rome.

Intelligent design is not compatible with natural selection. It is not

Intelligent design assumes an intelligent designer. Who designed that
designer -- another designer, even more intelligent? At some point
intelligent design must have an undesigned designer, aka God. This is

Here's - ah - something aka God:

Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the
potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me
not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no
understanding? (Isaiah, Ch. 29:16)

Who the hell do they think they are kidding with this God stuff?

Not us Strazis, that's for sure!

For, as the offspring of what Carl Sagan labeled &quot;primordial slime&quot;,
Strazis know God-like drivel from slime - blessed be its name.

Hi Mark,

Doesn't this statement that the presentation was &quot;scholarly&quot; imply then
that their antiStrat writing is not up to the standard this
non-&quot;authorship&quot; paper pretends to? And what examples of their work did
the committee that is allegedly uninviting Strit-matter and Kos-itsky
have to judge them? Canadian young adult novels (of a high standard,
but fiction nevertheless) and a doctoral thesis that is controversial
(to put it mildly). I can understand some groups being very squimish
about inviting these two individuals to speak. Would you invite the
authors of &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; to lecture on 19th century nature
writing in the Galapagos Islands?

Hey, Neil:

I don't know much about how papers are submitted, reviewed, and approved. I
don't know if publications and meetings have minimum requirements for the
writers, but even so, doesn't Lynne's co-author have an appropriate degree
and teach? I really don't think it should make any difference that one
writer is not known as a scholar and the other ... not respected, shall we
say. My inclination would be to read the abstract and the first few pages;
if I liked that, I'd read more. If I thought the paper was worthy, I'd send
it around for review, and then publish. In the case of a controversial
paper, I'd prefer to err on *their* side, and maybe send it around for
review anyway. (Again, it seems to me that the authors may be
controversial, but that the paper itself is not, particularly - I imagine
people get published all the time with alternative source proposals.)

Yes, if the nitwits who put together &quot;Pandas&quot; could put together a paper
that made an actual contribution to scholarship/science (a highly dubious
proposition), I'd publish it.

That is a shameful response, Neil. What has it to do with us? Our work
on The Tempest is carefully researched. In fact one of the adjudicators

Thank you so much, Mark. I don't think the work can be bad. A prominent
traditional expert on The Tempest is impressed by it, and a rather big
scholarly publisher has decided to publish our edition of The Tempest,
which we'll start working on in a couple of months. The truth will out,
as it has been said. It's just depressing to meet with so many road
blocks because of who we are rather than what we've done. To be invited
to a conference only to be disinvited was a terribly harsh blow, as I
was immensely excited, and it was probably my only chance in this life
to visit the country concerned. But if you were to see the entire
correspondence, I believe you would understand that this &quot;give and
take&quot; had nothing to do with our work; it had to do with the mindsets
of the conference organizers, one of whom has steadfastly refused to
communicate with us since he first enthusiastically accepted our paper.

Regards,
Lynne

&gt; Hey, Neil:

The procedure is pretty much what you've outlined below, with some
slight variations depending upon the discipline.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I
&gt; don't know if publications and meetings have minimum requirements for the
&gt; writers,

"/>

They don't -- except for a very few.

Some professional society meetings require that presenters either be
members of the society or be introduced by members of the society; of
course, nonmembers present their work at such meetings all the time
(indeed, I have done so myself) because it is a trivial matter to find a
society member who will sponsor one's talk.

As for journals, almost all of them publish articles by people with
no advanced degrees or other credentials, provided the quality of the
work is adequate and the paper passes the usual scrutiny of peer review.
(By the same token, some very good papers by well-known researchers with
all the advanced degrees, credentials, and academic honors that one
could wish are *rejected* by professional journals. Editors' and
referees' opinions of what is significant and interesting vary, as the
editors and referees are human.) Some excellent scientific papers have
been published by undergraduates and amateurs. Of course, most papers
in the scientific and scholarly professional literature are by authors
with advanced degrees, but the reason is obvious: few amateurs possess
the requisite training to make worthwhile original research
contributions to fields that often require formidable technical
expertise; however, there are notable exceptions.

The situation is somewhat different with the e-print archive in
mathematics and physics, a relatively recent phenomenon that has altered
the dynamic of publication in those fields. The papers appearing there
are unrefereed *preprints* that will presumably be submitted in due
course for publication elsewhere, but are being circulated throughout
the professional world in advance. It is understood that the results
are provisional, as they have not been peer reviewed; indeed, some
useful peer review occurs by means of the site itself, as interested
readers find errors in the preprints and notify the authors, and it is
not uncommon for a paper to be substantially revised before publication
or withdrawn altogether as a result of reader feedback from the paper's
informal preliminary dissemination via the archive. (Indeed, prior to
the archive's existence, most researchers sent out paper copies of their
preprints to scores of potentially interested people at the author's own
expense (many still do), so the same mechanism was in action -- but it
operated less efficiently, as there was no suitable means of &quot;mass
mailing&quot; one's preprint to the entire world.) When the archive first
began, anyone could submit a preprint. My understanding is that now one
must be either an established submitter or one's submission must be
endorsed by an established submitter; this change was instituted in
order to avoid the plethora of crackpot submissions (trisections of the
angle, etc.) that began to proliferate as cranks got wind of the free
global forum that the archive afforded. Indeed, the hilarious
Altschuler preprint appeared there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but even so, doesn't Lynne's co-author have an appropriate degree
&gt; and teach?

"/>

He does; but those circumstances will have little or no influence
upon the eventual publication of the paper in question. If the work
passes muster, it is simply a matter of finding the right venue. For
example, some journals would be reluctant to publish a paper that long
(indeed, my most recent paper was submitted to a journal that normally
does not accept any paper exceeding ten pages in length), but other
journals certainly do publish longer papers; one must simply choose
one's venue wisely. If the work is worthwhile, then getting it
published is simply a matter of finding the appropriate venue. This may
take time and patience, and one's work may be rejected several times
before it is accepted (sometimes before it is accepted by a very good
journal). Lynne and Dr. Stritmatter should not be discouraged by such
rejections, which are part and parcel of the process. In particular,
they *certainly* should not conclude that there is some orthodox
academic conspiracy dedicated to silencing alternative viewpoints. In
most academic fields, vigorous disputes are the rule rather than the
exception.

I do not conclude that. I am, however, pretty sure that the climate
changed with regard to this particular conference. That someone went

Yes. And of course, If no one will take our paper(s), we can of course

I don't, unfortunately, but I'm certainly not the person to ask about
mechanisms for preprint circulation in English literature. In fact, the
e-print archive is relatively new in even in high-energy physics (where
it originated) and in mathematics, which are relatively technology-savvy
fields, and it utilizes the server space and other resources of one of
the national laboratories. I suspect that the technology will soon
spread to other fields as well -- it probably just requires someone
willing to furnish server space and someone willing to administer it.

Not knowing which conference that was or what the procedure for the
acceptance of submissions was, I could not comment upon what happened in
that instance, much less upon its propriety. However, I would emphasize
that academia in general and the humanities in particular, _pace_ the
paranoia of Mr. Crowley and a few others who have evidently never been
near a major research university, is an unusually sympathetic venue for
innovative and controversial ideas, provided that those ideas are backed
by solid intellectual groundwork. Indeed, those outside the academy
(e.g., politicians and sometimes the press) have often criticized the
academy for being too *uncritical* of half-baked ideas.

If I were you, Lynne, I would do so only as a last resort. Don't

between a paper's first submission and its eventual publication. (The

circumstances in that case).

I don't know of such a thing within the discipline -- the closest thing I
can think of is Hardy Cook's SHAKSPER site, where people can post
pre-publication versions of articles for general comment. Of course Hardy
as banished authorship discussion &lt;per se&gt; as generally productive of more
heat than light, but there's no reason why your work should be presented in
that light. You'd need to join first, but that's not a problem (_both_
Kennedys are members)..

&gt; Actually, Neil, I have had very few rejections. But I've never been
&gt; rejected before my work has been read before.

&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the organizers of a big conference who at first enthusiastically
&gt;&gt;&gt; invited us to speak are now apparently doing everything in their power
&gt;&gt;&gt; to disinvite us.

&gt;&gt; Was this the allegedly non-authorship related paper on 15th and 16th
&gt;&gt; century travel writing, or some Oxfordian &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; thing?

&gt; It wasn't Pandas and people. I don't write well about animals.

&gt;&gt; I suppose this is what one calls academic freedom--the
&gt;&gt;&gt; freedom of academics to refuse to let material that contradicts
&gt;&gt;&gt; cherished beliefs be heard or seen.

&gt;&gt; I would think part of academic freedom is to protect academics from
&gt;&gt; wasting their time with evidenceless conspiracy theories.

&gt; This had nothing to do with any conspiracy theory, unless there was a
&gt; previous conspiracy to keep the truth of the Strachey &quot;letter&quot; from the
&gt; public, which I don't happen to believe. I think it was just poor
&gt; scholarship and passing on the Strachey baton.

&gt;&gt;If a Dr.
&gt;&gt; Groves chooses to amuse himself reading posts by people who claim Old
&gt;&gt; English is still spoken today, that's his choice. Why inflict that
&gt;&gt; drivel on a roomful of conference-goers?

&gt; That is a shameful response, Neil. What has it to do with us? Our work
&gt; on The Tempest is carefully researched.

&gt;&gt;&gt; with advanced degrees, but the reason is obvious: few amateurs possess
&gt;&gt;&gt; the requisite training to make worthwhile original research
&gt;&gt;&gt; contributions to fields that often require formidable technical
&gt;&gt;&gt; expertise; however, there are notable exceptions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The situation is somewhat different with the e-print archive in

&gt;&gt;&gt; course for publication elsewhere, but are being circulated throughout
&gt;&gt;&gt; the professional world in advance.

&gt;&gt; David or anyone else, do you know of anything like this for papers in
&gt;&gt; English Literature?

&gt; I don't know of such a thing within the discipline -- the closest thing I
&gt; can think of is Hardy Cook's SHAKSPER site, where people can post
&gt; pre-publication versions of articles for general comment. Of course Hardy
&gt; as banished authorship discussion &lt;per se&gt; as generally productive of more
&gt; heat than light, but there's no reason why your work should be presented in
&gt; that light. You'd need to join first, but that's not a problem (_both_
&gt; Kennedys are members)..

&gt; Peter G.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It is understood that the results
&gt;&gt;&gt; are provisional, as they have not been peer reviewed; indeed, some
&gt;&gt;&gt; useful peer review occurs by means of the site itself, as interested
&gt;&gt;&gt; readers find errors in the preprints and notify the authors, and it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not uncommon for a paper to be substantially revised before publication
&gt;&gt;&gt; or withdrawn altogether as a result of reader feedback from the paper's
&gt;&gt;&gt; informal preliminary dissemination via the archive. (Indeed, prior to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the archive's existence, most researchers sent out paper copies of their
&gt;&gt;&gt; preprints to scores of potentially interested people at the author's own
&gt;&gt;&gt; expense (many still do), so the same mechanism was in action -- but it
&gt;&gt;&gt; operated less efficiently, as there was no suitable means of &quot;mass
&gt;&gt;&gt; mailing&quot; one's preprint to the entire world.) When the archive first
&gt;&gt;&gt; began, anyone could submit a preprint. My understanding is that now one
&gt;&gt;&gt; must be either an established submitter or one's submission must be
&gt;&gt;&gt; endorsed by an established submitter; this change was instituted in
&gt;&gt;&gt; order to avoid the plethora of crackpot submissions (trisections of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; angle, etc.) that began to proliferate as cranks got wind of the free
&gt;&gt;&gt; global forum that the archive afforded. Indeed, the hilarious
&gt;&gt;&gt; Altschuler preprint appeared there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but even so, doesn't Lynne's co-author have an appropriate degree
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and teach?

&gt;&gt;&gt; He does; but those circumstances will have little or no influence
&gt;&gt;&gt; upon the eventual publication of the paper in question. If the work
&gt;&gt;&gt; passes muster, it is simply a matter of finding the right venue. For
&gt;&gt;&gt; example, some journals would be reluctant to publish a paper that long
&gt;&gt;&gt; (indeed, my most recent paper was submitted to a journal that normally
&gt;&gt;&gt; does not accept any paper exceeding ten pages in length), but other
&gt;&gt;&gt; journals certainly do publish longer papers; one must simply choose
&gt;&gt;&gt; one's venue wisely. If the work is worthwhile, then getting it
&gt;&gt;&gt; published is simply a matter of finding the appropriate venue. This may
&gt;&gt;&gt; take time and patience, and one's work may be rejected several times
&gt;&gt;&gt; before it is accepted (sometimes before it is accepted by a very good
&gt;&gt;&gt; journal). Lynne and Dr. Stritmatter should not be discouraged by such
&gt;&gt;&gt; rejections, which are part and parcel of the process.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, David. That is helpful. We will, of course, submit
&gt;&gt; elsewhere, and in addition we are speaking at a different mainstream
&gt;&gt; conference in the spring.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In particular,
&gt;&gt;&gt; they *certainly* should not conclude that there is some orthodox
&gt;&gt;&gt; academic conspiracy dedicated to silencing alternative viewpoints. In
&gt;&gt;&gt; most academic fields, vigorous disputes are the rule rather than the
&gt;&gt;&gt; exception.

&gt;&gt; I do not conclude that. I am, however, pretty sure that the climate
&gt;&gt; changed with regard to this particular conference. That someone went
&gt;&gt; from an extravagant acceptance to absolute silence in a day, while
&gt;&gt; others have covered for him for the past THREE MONTHS as he has
&gt;&gt; continued to refuse to reply or forward our papers to adjudicators or
&gt;&gt; even communicate to us whether we are welcome to speak, is suspicious,
&gt;&gt; to say the least. And rather heart-breaking.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I really don't think it should make any difference that one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writer is not known as a scholar and the other ... not respected,
&gt; shall we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say. My inclination would be to read the abstract and the first few
&gt; pages;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if I liked that, I'd read more. If I thought the paper was worthy,
&gt; I'd send
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it around for review, and then publish.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That is indeed what journal editors routinely do.

&gt;&gt; Yes. And of course, If no one will take our paper(s), we can of course
&gt;&gt; publish in an Oxfordian newsletter or journal. We have already received
&gt;&gt; offers. But I think that would be a terrible shame in this case,
&gt;&gt; although we will publish our updated response to Dr. Kathman's essay in
&gt;&gt; our own newsletter. We'll also have it up on the web soon.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for your input, all. Thanks particularly to you, David, and to

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not qualified to judge whether or not the specific paper Lynne refers to
&gt;&gt;&gt; represents *good* scholarship and should be published, but from what she's
&gt;&gt;&gt; posted here on it, they have taken a scholarly approach - it is not fantasy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It also has nothing directly to do with anti-Stratfordianism. They attempt
&gt;&gt;&gt; to show that the widely accepted source for the Tempest is unlikely to be

&gt;&gt;&gt; even bring his name up in the paper.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be very sad *if* their work is being rejected because of their
&gt;&gt;&gt; anti-Stratfordian connections rather than on the quality of the work.

&gt;&gt; Hi Mark,

&gt;&gt; Doesn't this statement that the presentation was &quot;scholarly&quot; imply then
&gt;&gt; that their antiStrat writing is not up to the standard this
&gt;&gt; non-&quot;authorship&quot; paper pretends to?

&gt; The organizers themselves said that our papers showed admirable
&gt; scholarship. They intimated that their audience was not intellectual
&gt; enough to understand them.

&gt;&gt;And what examples of their work did
&gt;&gt; the committee that is allegedly uninviting Strit-matter and Kos-itsky
&gt;&gt; have to judge them?

&gt; They had two thirty minute papers, from which we were going to fashion
&gt; powerpoints. The papers are available to members of the Fellowship and
&gt; other interested persons to read, although we are still holding out
&gt; hope that a mainstream journal will be kind enough to publish them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey, Neil:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know much about how papers are submitted, reviewed, and
&gt;&gt; approved.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The procedure is pretty much what you've outlined below, with
some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slight variations depending upon the discipline.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don't know if publications and meetings have minimum requirements
for
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writers,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They don't -- except for a very few.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some professional society meetings require that presenters either
be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; members of the society or be introduced by members of the society;
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course, nonmembers present their work at such meetings all the time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (indeed, I have done so myself) because it is a trivial matter to
find a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; society member who will sponsor one's talk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for journals, almost all of them publish articles by people
with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no advanced degrees or other credentials, provided the quality of
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work is adequate and the paper passes the usual scrutiny of peer
review.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (By the same token, some very good papers by well-known researchers
with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the advanced degrees, credentials, and academic honors that one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could wish are *rejected* by professional journals. Editors' and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; referees' opinions of what is significant and interesting vary, as
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; editors and referees are human.) Some excellent scientific papers
have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been published by undergraduates and amateurs. Of course, most
papers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the scientific and scholarly professional literature are by
authors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with advanced degrees, but the reason is obvious: few amateurs
possess
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the requisite training to make worthwhile original research
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contributions to fields that often require formidable technical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expertise; however, there are notable exceptions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The situation is somewhat different with the e-print archive in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mathematics and physics, a relatively recent phenomenon that has
altered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the dynamic of publication in those fields. The papers appearing
there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are unrefereed *preprints* that will presumably be submitted in due
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course for publication elsewhere, but are being circulated
throughout
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the professional world in advance.

&gt;&gt; I don't know of such a thing within the discipline -- the closest thing

Our papers don't mention Oxford so it may be
ok.

Do tell Lynne! I thought the whole purpose of your Tempest paper was to
discredit the William Strachey letter. Once you and Dr. Strittmatter (I
just love how Roger refers to himself in the third person on that
Oxford site) did this, you could hop, skip and jump to prove that The
Tempest was written long before Eddie de Vere died.

As for William Shakespeare's, of Stratford upon Avon, The Tempest, it
is full of pitfulls for actors, directors and designers. If Prospero
is a strong actor and the actors who play Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio,
and Gonzalo are weak, then the production turns into a one man show.
If the sound designer goes wild with the tempest, the lines in the
opening scene get lost in the noise. Without an actor who knows how to
use Shakespeare's language, Act I Scene 2 is dull. Ariel is a tricky
role since most actors have never played an airy spirit. It's
important to find variety in Caliban or the character will become one
long shout. Prospero controls much of the action, so the director and
actor need to find the character's conflict and find the place in the
script where Prospero decides to change.

In best production I 've seen, a woman played Prospero which brought
some interesting colors to the role. Doing the magic
wasn't easy for Prospero. In fact, at one point, Prospero almost
&quot;killed&quot; Ariel. The production was moving.

Lets not beat around the bush - since this thread has been ostensibly about
scholarship; OE in C19th series of commentaries is the same subject: nothing
to do with anyone's scholarship particularly, but pointedly about abusive
writing by people who display no scholarship at all. Instead they infer an
authority due only to themselves and their point of view.

I'm sure a conference room of people won't want to hear about the under-side
of 'research and expertise' as a subject of professional deformation, but
the subject of propaganda and authoritarianism is certainly of wider
interest to other disciplines, and of some importance in the world in the
last century and this - and certainly of greater contemporary impact than
the subject of this conference -- which is not to take a fling at the
conference, but the terms of reference evoked above for this conversation.
Goebells had a PhD!

I resent these people's pretence to a form of knowledge that is of such a
narrow vein as to make it specious, and which is couched in such terms as to
make it a form of credulousness, a belief rather than a knowing, and nothing
at all to do with 'scholarship'.

Almost all reactions are emotional ones; reactions to what has not been
allowed to inform the writer, and so rejected and exteriorised.

This very subject is one of the core elements of the Author's Works!

You demand that a stalker's conditions should be acknowledged. I don't think
so! Neither does the other woman you insulted and who left the newsgroup. I
see that a number of male writers have left also - after a little unfriendly
wordplay on your part.

Try and write a few on-topic posts, here or in the chess groups, if you want
any repect - playing follow-the-leader gives up entirely too much
responsibility to someone, in this case to someone who can't handle it, and
besides, is not really a very healthy thing to do in most circumstances.

As a Fellowship member, I feel I ought to somewhat defend it. The few
Fellowship people who participate in the authorship threads there tend,
most of them, to get annoyed with people like me and treat us somewhat
badly (as I do them) but my impression is that only Dr. Stritmatter
(and only when he's annoyed, which is only half the time) lays down
laws and makes it fairly clear that if you don't sign a loyalty oath,
and discuss the topics he thinks you ought to, he doesn't want you
around. Others, like Ken, keep telling me that if I don't reform, they
won't bother arguing with me, anymore, but they keep arguing with me,
anyway.

I think we've had some productive threads, but not of late. When I

Yes, I once began an interesting discussion on the free boards with
Robert Detobel, one which inspired me to do some additional reading and
research (and to conclude that he was wrong), but then Bassanio (whose
profile at first identified him as Dr. Stritmatter and later did not)
interjected and Herr Detobel seemed to lose interest in me. I also
agree that Bob G. does an admirable job of defending all at HLAS, even
though he's forced into it by the attitudes of the other SF members.

Actually not, Robert. I began idly reading, almost certain that the
Strachey &quot;letter&quot; presented a problem for Oxford's authorship, as I was
pretty sure Shakespeare was the author of _The Tempest_; however, once
I'd read the letter, I was astounded by all the problems I saw, and
went from there. It has been a very fascinating journey, posing all
sorts of interesting questions about sources, some of which are not
answered yet. And it has filled my time rather effectively, as I didn't
feel well enough to write a new novel.

Thank you. I believe we just did that in Ashland to the satisfaction of
everyone present. As time passes, I will tell HLASers what we found out
about the play, which we now believe to be an occasional play written
to be performed on the cusp between Shrovetide and Lent.

&gt; As for William Shakespeare's, of Stratford upon Avon, The Tempest, it
&gt; is full of pitfulls for actors, directors and designers. If Prospero
&gt; is a strong actor and the actors who play Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio,
&gt; and Gonzalo are weak, then the production turns into a one man show.

I can quite see that. I do find some of the characters very two

morality play.

I have never liked Scene 2 in any case. It tends to drag on stage.
There is far too much to be explained to Miranda, imo, and then we
still need to be introduced to Ariel and Caliban--and Ferdinand. We
might discuss at some point why Scene 2 isn't broken up into smaller
discrete scenes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Ariel is a tricky
&gt; role since most actors have never played an airy spirit. It's
&gt; important to find variety in Caliban or the character will become one
&gt; long shout. Prospero controls much of the action, so the director and
&gt; actor need to find the character's conflict and find the place in the
&gt; script where Prospero decides to change.

&gt; In best production I 've seen, a woman played Prospero which brought
&gt; some interesting colors to the role. Doing the magic
&gt; wasn't easy for Prospero. In fact, at one point, Prospero almost
&gt;&quot;killed&quot; Ariel. The production was moving.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is a shameful response, Neil. What has it to do with us? Our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on The Tempest is carefully researched. In fact one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjudicators
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has now said that both adjudicators admired our work but felt it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be published in a specialised journal. And round and round it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goes...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; L.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lets not beat around the bush - since this thread has been ostensibly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scholarship; OE in C19th series of commentaries is the same subject:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do with anyone's scholarship particularly, but pointedly about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abusive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing by people who display no scholarship at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Speaking about abusive people, Philth,

&gt;&gt; LOL - yes we are having a little demonstration of who here could possibly
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; abusive, and its interesting that they all seem to come out of one mold -
&gt;&gt; puns apart

&gt;&gt;&gt; would you finally answer the
&gt;&gt;&gt; question I've asked repeatedly of you:

&gt;&gt; You may repeat it as much as you like, but you demonstrate the case by
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; writing, more substantially than I need redeliver your words to you - the
&gt;&gt; ones you don't deny, but demand 'proofs' of.

&gt;&gt;&gt; did you have Lynne Kositsky's
&gt;&gt;&gt; permission to repost some of her HLAS posts to the chess groups and
&gt;&gt;&gt; present them as evidence I was stalking her? A yes or no answer,
&gt;&gt;&gt; please, and not another off-topic rant in the British Language.

&gt;&gt; You demand that a stalker's conditions should be acknowledged. I don't
&gt;&gt; think
&gt;&gt; so! Neither does the other woman you insulted and who left the newsgroup.
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; see that a number of male writers have left also - after a little
&gt;&gt; unfriendly
&gt;&gt; wordplay on your part.

&gt;&gt; Try and write a few on-topic posts, here or in the chess groups, if you
&gt;&gt; want
&gt;&gt; any repect - playing follow-the-leader gives up entirely too much
&gt;&gt; responsibility to someone, in this case to someone who can't handle it,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; besides, is not really a very healthy thing to do in most circumstances.

&gt;&gt; Phil Innes

&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead they infer an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authority due only to themselves and their point of view.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure a conference room of people won't want to hear about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under-side
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of 'research and expertise' as a subject of professional deformation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject of propaganda and authoritarianism is certainly of wider
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interest to other disciplines, and of some importance in the world in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last century and this - and certainly of greater contemporary impact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject of this conference -- which is not to take a fling at the

I recall reading, long ago, the proposition that Tempest was originally
conceived as a much longer play, structurally similar to the other Romances,
with multiple locations, treachery, banishments, etc. Act V proved to be
enough material for an entire play, though, so Scene 2 provides all of that
talky exposition. I can't recall if the writer was making the case that it
was actually a revision (in which case, it might have been Dover Wilson) or
merely that Shakespeare realized in the early going that Act V was the best
part of the Romances anyway, so why not cut to the chase.

(I say all this realizing I am offereing another rabbit hole for the
Oxfordians to run down.)

Hello. I hope you're well.

I'm still not sure whether you and Roger consider
the Strachey letter to be defective as a letter or if a
pamphlet, it would be acceptable evidence.

If it can be proven to be a draft for a Virginia Company
pamphlet would that create problems for your hypothesis
or would you reject the substance of both letter and
pamphlet?

Can you tell us if the Strachey letter is necessary to
your hypothesis or have you categorically rejected it?

There is evidence in the Strachey letter/pamphlet that
points to Bacon as its author. Since Bacon was notoriously
a pamphleteer (never ad hoc, always for patrons),in addition
to the identification of Bacon by Spedding and Brown, any
further evidence that points to Bacon as the author would
tend to confirm that the Strachey letter is a pamphlet.

I have put off posting on Purchas' evidence for months because
I fear Art's reaction. I'm already the stereotypically evil
Lucy Van Pelt with stereotypically bushy black eyebrows
(as if the Normans did not commit genocide). I'm not eager
to provoke Art lest he have a fit when Purchas connects
the KJV to Bacon (who else was the greatest English prose
stylist in 1610?)

Cordially,

Elizabeth

Yes, thank you, Elizabeth, only a little travel tired. How are you?

It is copied from a number of earlier sources to which Shakespeare
would have had access, as well as several later sources that prove it
couldn't have been sent to England July 15, 1610. There are also other
problems with it. It doesn't much matter what you call it, letter or
pamphlet or book. It wasn't a source. Whether The Tempest was a source
for Strachey is a matter for conjecture.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Wouldn't make any difference. We can show that The Tempest was likely
written much earlier, certainly by 1604/1605, very possibly by 1602. We
can also show you another play that looks very much as if it copied the
premise for its subplot from Strachey--if you use Kathman's essay as a
yardstick--but was in fact performed and I believe published (would
have to check that) in 1605.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Can you tell us if the Strachey letter is necessary to
&gt; your hypothesis or have you categorically rejected it?

"/>

I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. We can show that
Shakespeare used much earlier sources from which Strachey copied,
sometimes verbatim. The Strachey letter is rejected by us as a source
for The Tempest.

The letter/pamphlet is, imo, definitely by Strachey. His MO is all over

That's a beautiful bit of imagery. I've been paying particular
attention to that facial feature in actors to see what degree of evil
they might represent.
I notice eyes, but I don't always notice the resemblance.
For instance,
One really good show where the evil eyes thing was used to great
effect: Carnivale.
And rain, they seemed to use rain a lot though I missed that ofttimes.
I don't know about the justin thing, just quoting someone else. Though
that same
person seemed to think this rain and Justin thing happened more than
once in various
episodes. The seed thing was mentioned several times too.

I don't know man, he didn't look like he was having an orgasm at all.
Hey it's rainin'. Weird sort of orgasm if you ask me.

I did notice one thing that keeps freakin me out. The eyes in the
masks. The mask keeps changing appearance.
Sometimes it looks like Jon Savage, sometimes like Justin, sometimes
like the kid
and sometimes like that intermediary devil, whatsis face the one
carting around the two smelly bodies in his car....

While I was writing this, I got a very unexpected email DING from
someone who I haven't heard from in maybe five years. His studio
burned to the ground. Fire man, what a weird peice fo synchronicity.

====================================
Pussycat, Pussycat where have you been
I've been to London to visit the Queen
Pussycat, pussycat what did you there
I frightened a little MOUSE under her chair

This song involves the Tudor Queen Elizabeth. One of the nurses in
the castle had an old tomcat that liked to roam. She constantly had
to collect it from the throne room. The old tom's favourite spot
was to sit underneath the Queens throne. Once when the nurse went
to collect her cat, the Queen had just sat down in her chair. The
cats tail innocently brushed the Queen's foot. The Queen leapt up
in surprise. The Queen then declared that the cat should live
under the throne but only if he kept the throne room free of MICE.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Alice...was always ready to talk about her pet: 'Dinah's our cat.
And she's such a capital one for catching mice you can't think!
And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!
Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.

Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old *Magpie* began
wrapping itself up VERy carefully, remarking, 'I really must
be getting home; the NIGHT-air doesn't suit my throat!'
----------------------------------------------------------------
a cat named TRIXIE

--------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;The Tower of London has been a home for many prisoners during its
long history. A grim and foreboding place like this seems to be an
unlikely home for two cats to set up home. But during the Tudor and
Elizabethan eras, a cat gave loyal comfort to one of those unfortunates
incarcerated there. During the bitter struggle between the Yorkest and
Lancastrians in the War of the Roses, Sir Henry Wyatt was taken
prisoner by King Richard III, in 1483, and sent to the tower. This was
quite a difference in life for him, as he had once been the Governor of
the Tower, and now he had a rather different view on life in the tower.
Being a well known cat lover living in Allington Castle it was said of
him that he &quot;ever used to make much of a cat&quot;. Stories say that while
in the Tower he was visited by a stray cat which made its way to his
cell through a chimney. The cat often used to leave the cell and come
back with pigeons which it gave to Wyatt. It is said these were cooked
for him by a friendly gaoler and made up for the meagre rations that
were fed to the prisoners. It was surmised that when he was first
incarcerated he would become succumb to illness &amp; starvation, but the
gifts of food that the cat brought kept him alive until he was later
released. Later Sir Henry had a memorial built to his cat friend in a
church at Boxley in Kent. He also remembered him in a painting of him
in 1532. Several years later, in 1601, when the reign of Queen
Elizabeth was nearing its end, Henry Wriothesley, the third Earl of
Southampton, was incarcerated in the Tower of London for supporting The
Earl of Essex's rebellion. During his stay there he was joined by his
favourite cat, a black &amp; white female called Trixie. The Earl being a
nobleman, had two houses, one country mansion in Gloucestershire and
another, Southampton House, in London. One story says the cat made its
own way across London from Southampton House, scaled the walls &amp;
clambered across the roofs until it found the chimney of his cell and
climbed down to join the Earl. We know that the cat kept Wriothesley
company because many years later after the event, the tale was put into
writing by Thomas Pennant an antiquarian. The cat was also included in
a portrait commissioned by Wriothesley around 1603, &amp; painted by John
de Critz the Elder. Trixie is shown as a black cat with white markings
to her face, a snowy white bib, and white forepaws, sitting by the
right arm of the Earl with a quizzical look upon her face. Trixie kept
her master company in the tower for about two years. The queen died in
1603 and was succeeded by James I who ordered his release.&gt;&gt;

October 6, 1542 =&gt;&quot;Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------
a cat named ACATAR: To obey (Spanish, Portuguese)
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;SIR HENRY WYATT (1460-1537), the father of the poet, resisted
the pretensions of Richard III to the throne, and was in consequence
arrested &amp; imprisoned in the Tower for two years. According to his
son's statement he was racked in Richard's presence and vinegar &amp;
MUSTARD were forced down his throat. There is an old tradition
in the family that while in the Tower a cat [named ACATAR]
brought him a pigeon every day from a neighbouring dovecot and
thus saved him from starvation. The Earl of Romney, who is directly
descended in the female line from the Wyatts, possesses a curious
half-length portrait of Sir Henry seated in a prison cell with a cat
drawing towards him a pigeon through the grating of a window.
Lord Romney also possesses a second picture of 'The cat that
fed Sir Henry Wyatt,' besides a small bust portrait of Sir Henry. The
pictures, illustrating the tradition of the cat, represent Sir Henry
Wyatt
in advanced years, and were obviously painted on hearsay evidence
very long after the date of the alleged events they claim to depict.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is a shameful response, Neil. What has it to do with us? Our

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be published in a specialised journal. And round and round it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goes...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; L.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lets not beat around the bush - since this thread has been ostensibly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scholarship; OE in C19th series of commentaries is the same subject:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do with anyone's scholarship particularly, but pointedly about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abusive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing by people who display no scholarship at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Speaking about abusive people, Philth,

&gt;&gt; LOL - yes we are having a little demonstration of who here could possibly
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; abusive, and its interesting that they all seem to come out of one mold -
&gt;&gt; puns apart

&gt;&gt;&gt; would you finally answer the
&gt;&gt;&gt; question I've asked repeatedly of you:

&gt;&gt; You may repeat it as much as you like, but you demonstrate the case by
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; writing, more substantially than I need redeliver your words to you - the
&gt;&gt; ones you don't deny, but demand 'proofs' of.

&gt;&gt;&gt; did you have Lynne Kositsky's
&gt;&gt;&gt; permission to repost some of her HLAS posts to the chess groups and
&gt;&gt;&gt; present them as evidence I was stalking her? A yes or no answer,
&gt;&gt;&gt; please, and not another off-topic rant in the British Language.

&gt;&gt; You demand that a stalker's conditions should be acknowledged. I don't
&gt;&gt; think
&gt;&gt; so! Neither does the other woman you insulted and who left the newsgroup.
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; see that a number of male writers have left also - after a little
&gt;&gt; unfriendly
&gt;&gt; wordplay on your part.

&gt;&gt; Try and write a few on-topic posts, here or in the chess groups, if you
&gt;&gt; want
&gt;&gt; any repect - playing follow-the-leader gives up entirely too much
&gt;&gt; responsibility to someone, in this case to someone who can't handle it,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; besides, is not really a very healthy thing to do in most circumstances.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead they infer an

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure a conference room of people won't want to hear about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under-side

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject of propaganda and authoritarianism is certainly of wider

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last century and this - and certainly of greater contemporary impact

But this does not relieve you from the facts of your actions - and if your

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there a British Language interpreter handy?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Peter G.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What good would that do you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Almost all reactions are emotional ones; reactions to what has not been
&gt;&gt;&gt;allowed to inform the writer, and so rejected and exteriorised.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Tell me Peter, in what language does the word British first appear? After
&gt;&gt;&gt;that try Old, then English, then go for &quot;it&quot; and &quot;and&quot; and &quot;I&quot; and &quot;is&quot;

Little reward in being right, since its almost unprovable if inferentially
indicated, but only as much as Brutus coming to Britain from Troy - what
difference did it make if this is an apochryphal reference?. But at least
they found Troy!

There are many inter-borrowings with other early languages, and inter-mythic
questions. I have been trying to establish when the Phoenicians setled in
the Hayle estuary, Cwll, which is probably not a late date, not later than
300 bce, and probaly tin and lead trading, though poss. also kaolin, and
though Dahphne du Maurier writes about it, and her family investigated these
subjects, she only recorded vagaries, and preferred to talk of her family's
lost searches for the &quot;Baconian&quot; manuscripts in a certain river. Her own
cited sources are famous, but unpublished now, and my guess is that they
will be equivocal.

Timing early exchanges is difficult, since BCE the damned Greeks never
mentioned Bognor Regis! nor Torquay! but only the Hesperidies! And the
Islands of Eternal Spring guarded by great giants in the second eden of
apple trees.

Mary Caine has some ideas. She is still alive, and I have a friend who
corresponds with her.
