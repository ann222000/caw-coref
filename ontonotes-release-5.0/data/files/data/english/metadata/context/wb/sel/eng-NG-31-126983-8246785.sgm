Our cheerleading squad is looking for a way to raise money for travel to the
local away football games.  Some of the girls are getting tired of doing car
washes where they prance around like Hooters waitresses on the street
corner.

So some of us came on the idea of brewing some home-made corn liquor.  Being
very naive about this, the first thing we did was to ask the man down at the
ABC store, but he was not much help.

Does anyone know what the laws are for selling it.  Does it depend on what
state or county you are in?

Thanks!

I'm not familiar with the area, but there is a feller who frequents this
newsgroup who shall remain nameless* but who goes out of his way to help
college girls like yoreself with all kinds of projects.  Hopefully he will
chime in and offer to fly you all over Asheville also.

Yes, my next door neighbor went off to law school and told me there was a
nice man named Larry Smith who was going to show her around Asheville and
even let her and her friends stay at his house.

I would surely like to get in touch with Mr. Smith!  Do you know how to
reach him?

The best way to reach him is to stand on the street corner dressed like a
Hooters waitress.  He will no doubt drive in for a car warsh as his old
truck is always caked with mud.

Good luck!

Thank you, Mr. Bob.  I will get my Hooters outfit out from the cleaners
tomorrow.

Mr. Smith, be on the lookout for a car-wash this Saturday at WalMart on
Swannanoa River Road near 240.

See you there!

for

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the

&gt; tired
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; car
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; washes where they prance around like Hooters waitresses on
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; street
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corner.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So some of us came on the idea of brewing some home-made
corn
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liquor.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very naive about this, the first thing we did was to ask the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ABC store, but he was not much help.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know what the laws are for selling it.  Does it
&gt; &gt; depend
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on

He needs his Zoloft adjusted, I fear.  Maybe he has a tumor like John
