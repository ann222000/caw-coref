156 2.0 SP3 04/2001 135000Km
Am now having a clutch pedal problem, which only appears when the car is
cold.
1. At morning startup the clutch pedal engages very near to the floor.
2. When clutch is released pedal travels half way back and then after 1/2 to
1 second flicks back out fully.
3. The problem progressively diminishes over the next 30 minutes of driving
and the clutch bite point changes during this period also.
4. If I come back to the car a few hours later, the clutch pedal is
completely normal with a biting point not on the floor, probably about half
travel of the pedal. Although saying that I've noticed from drive to drive
that the biting point can change.

The brake fluid is only slightly off max.
No difference when cold if I pump the pedal several times.

Only possibly related issue I can think of is that after its last service at
Mangoletsi 1.5 years ago the di@@@ead left the brake fluid top off, but I
found that after 1 hour as soon as I checked under the bonnet when I got
home.

I had noticed before the clutch pedal release problem started suddenly this
week that the biting point was almost at the floor, but other than that I
hadnt noticed any other problems (other than the usual performance issue
when cold, hunting/sense of power change).

Any ideas anyone?
Cheers G

Sounds to me as if there's a cylinder/fluid problem..... I had something
similar on a Celica I one had.

Are you sure it was the brake fluid and not the clutch? If any moisture's
got in this could cause problems......

....anyway, 1/5 years is a long time between services!!

The clutch fluid is fed from the brake fluid reservoir, or so I understand.

I service it mostly myself, but let a garage do brake fluid changes and
cambelts etc. Thats the reason its 1.5 years since last going near a dealer.
When they do idiot things like they did, I get reluctant to pay the
privilege of 80quid + VAT!

Think i'll try changing the fluid all the way through to the clutch
cylinders then and also push new stuff through the brakes.

Hi G,

I've been suffering from the same problem more than one year with my
156/2.0 JTS 2005.

Luckily my dealer was very kind and serious about this problem. Every
time I brought my car they changed brake/clutch fluid and even clutch
master cyclinder twice, though the problem still persisted. It was ok
for a while, say 3000km after the service, but it will almost always
recur.

Eventually they did the right thing (which I can't remember) at the
last service and I haven't seen the problem recur more than 10,000km.
I think the problem is gone.

I'll check with my garage what they have done and get back to you.

Hi,

Just talked with the mechanic and he said it was the slave cylinder
assembly including release bearing, actuator etc.
However, to do the work you have to remove the mission assembly.

I asked him to send me a drawing pointing which parts they actually
replaced. Drop me an email so I can forward it to you.
