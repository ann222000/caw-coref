Just picked up a 1992 535i with 110k miles on it.  Looks to be in good shape.  This is my first BMW car, though I do own a BMW motorcycle.

What would you do first?  I've heard new relays, fluid changes, new water pump, new air filter etc... mentioned.  Thanks for the help and advice.

Nice car, we have a '90 :-)

There's a good chance your distributor cap and rotor arm are original.
I'd replace the rotor arm and check the dizzy cap for wear. When worn
they cause poor mpg and lack of high rpm performance. You want Bosch
single electrode spark plugs.

Water pump is likely OK. Good chance she has a LSD so be careful when
buying final drive fluid that you get the right type.

Thanks for the advice.  The E34 web site gave me the heeby jeebies on the
water pump and the worse-than-death outcome if I let it go bad.
