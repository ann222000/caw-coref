&quot;Globalization is not a new trend. It is the natural policy for all empire building.
Globalization under modern capitalism began with the British Empire, marked by the
repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, five years after the Opium War with China (I have
written on the historical parallel between the Corn Laws and WTO), and two years before
the Revolutions of 1848. Great Britain embarked on a systemic promotion of free trade
and chose to depend on imported food, which gave a survivalist justification to empire.
France adopted free trade in 1860 and within 10 years was faced with the Paris Commune,
which was suppressed ruthlessly by the French bourgeoisie, who put to death 20,000
workers and peasants, including children. Despite a backlash movement toward protective
tariffs in Britain, Holland and Belgium, the global economy of the 19th century was
characterized by high mobility of goods across political borders. As Europe adopted
political nationalism, international economic liberalism developed in parallel, until
1914. Only World War I, the 1929 Depression and World War II caused a temporary halt of
free trade.&quot;

China vs the almighty dollar
By Henry C K Liu, chairman of New York based
Liu Investment
This article appeared in  &lt; http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/DG23Ad04.html &gt; AToL on
July 23, 2002

The Italian Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci, while under Fascist imprisonment, developed
the concept of cultural hegemony: control people's minds, and their hearts and hands
will follow. Gramsci explained how one dominant class can establish its control over
others through ideological dominance. Whereas orthodox Marxism explains social structure
as shaped by economic forces, Gramsci adds the crucial cultural dimension. He showed
how, once ideological authority (or &quot;cultural hegemony&quot;) is established, the use of
overt violence to impose control can become superfluous.

Today, the world lives under the virtually undisputed rule of a market-dominated,
ultra-competitive (yet not fairly competitive), globalized society with its cortege of
manifold iniquities and legalized violence. Many public and private institutions in all
nations that genuinely believe they are working for a more equitable world have
unwittingly contributed to the violent triumph of neoliberalism. Field evidence,
however, shows that perpetual prosperity for anyone, let alone all, under market
fundamentalism is merely an empty promise of neoliberalism. And the time may be ripe for
China, as Asia's largest economy, to break free of a global market economy that nears
collapse.

The chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, Allan Greenspan, now proudly uses the term
&quot;hegemony&quot;, in congressional testimony to describe officially US financial preeminence
and structural advantage. Unlike ideology, politics deal not only with moral validity,
but also with power. The ideology of neoliberalism appears empirically operative because
it has the hegemonic power to construct a &quot;real&quot; world that appears internally
consistent and theoretically rational, with the aid of &quot;scientific&quot; neoclassical
economics theories. No matter how many socioeconomic disasters the neoliberal globalized
system of market fundamentalism has visibly caused, no matter what financial crises
neoliberal free markets have engendered, no matter how many losers and outcasts it has
created, market fundamentalism is still promoted as indispensable, like the word of God,
as the only possible economic and social order available for human salvation. Margaret
Thatcher's TINA (There Is No Alternative) explains it all. Economic slavery, though
unfortunate, is preferable to starvation, according to neoliberal doctrine, which
falsely poses slavery or death by starvation as natural alternatives of human
civilization. The World Bank has estimated that neoliberal globalization has created 200
million newly poor people around the world in the past decade. Yet claims of
globalization's contribution to global prosperity continue unabated.

Former US president Bill Clinton's claim at the 2000 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) meeting that open economies have shown the highest growth rate is part of this
cultural hegemonic push. Clinton had it backwards: it is the countries that have the
highest growth rates resulting from complex conditions of structural advantage that are
pushing for further selective openness in the poorer economies. The most fundamental
flaw in the neoliberal logic is that the selective push for full and unregulated
mobility for capital across national borders is not accompanied with the same mobility
for labor.

It is self-evident that capital cannot exist without labor. Without labor, capital is
merely an idle asset, unable to contribute to productivity. Until labor can move freely
in the globalized system, there is no real openness. The current system is not true
globalization. It is merely a global expansion of US financial hegemony through dollar
hegemony: the domination of the global economy by the US national currency.

Dollar hegemony is a structural condition in world finance and trade in which the US
produces dollars and the rest of the world produce things dollars can buy. In 1971, the
late US president Richard Nixon abandoned the Bretton Woods regime of a gold-backed
dollar and fixed exchange rates to stop the gold drain from the US Treasury caused by
chronic lapses of US fiscal discipline. At that point, the dollar, as a fiat currency,
theoretically abdicated its reserve-currency status for world trade. Yet for more than
three decades since, the dollar has remained the reserve currency for world trade
despite continued chronic US government and trade deficits and the transformation of the
United States into the world's most indebted nation. Notwithstanding its role as the
leading proponent of market fundamentalism, the United States maintains a strong-dollar
policy as a matter of national interest, in defiance of market forces.

A reserve currency for world trade without the necessary disciplinary backup is in
reality a tax by the issuing sovereign on all other sovereigns participating in world
trade via that currency.

The State Theory of Money (Chartalism) holds that the acceptance of a currency is based
fundamentally on a government's power to tax [to pay interest to the fraudulent Banking
Dynasties who create money from nothing]. It is the government's willingness to accept
the currency it issues for payment of taxes that gives the issuance currency within a
nation. The Chartalist theory of money, as summarized by economist Randall Wray, claims
that all governments, by virtual of their power to levy taxes payable with
government-designated legal tender, do not need external financing and should be able to
be the employer of last resort to maintain full employment. The logic of Chartalism
reasons that an excessively low tax rate will result in a low demand for the currency
and that a chronic budget surplus is economically counterproductive because it drains
credit from the economy. The colonial administration in British Africa learned that land
taxes were instrumental in inducing the carefree natives into using its currency and
engaging in financial productivity.

Thus, according to Chartalist theory, an economy can finance its domestic developmental
needs to achieve full employment and maximum growth with prosperity without any need for
foreign loans or investment, and without the penalty of hyperinflation. But Chartalist
theory is operative only in closed domestic monetary regimes. Countries participating in
free trade in a globalized system, especially in unregulated global financial and
currency markets, cannot operate on Chartalist principles because of the
foreign-exchange dilemma. Any government printing its own currency to finance domestic
needs beyond the size of its foreign-exchange reserves will soon find its currency under
attack in the foreign-exchange markets, regardless of whether the currency is pegged to
a fixed exchanged rate or is free-floating. Thus all economies must accumulate dollars
before they can attract foreign capital. Even then foreign capital will only invest in
the export sector where dollar revenue can be earned. But the dollars that Asian
economies accumulate from trade surpluses can only be invested in dollar assets in the
United States, depriving local economies of needed capital. The only protection from
such attacks on currency is to suspend convertibility, which then will keep foreign
investment away.

Precisely to prevent such currency attacks, tight controls on the international flow of
capital were set up by the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates pegged to a
gold-backed dollar after World War II. Drawing lessons from the prewar 1930s Depression,
economic thinking prevalent immediately after the war had deemed international capital
flow undesirable and unnecessary. Trade was to be mediated through fixed exchange rates
pegged to a gold-backed dollar. The fixed exchange rates were to be adjusted only
gradually and periodically to reflect the relative strength of the participating
economies. Under principles of Chartalism, foreign capital serves no useful domestic
purpose outside of an imperialistic agenda. Thus dollar hegemony essentially taxes away
the ability of the trading partners of the United States to finance their own domestic
development in their own currencies, and forces them to seek foreign loans and
investment denominated in dollars, which the US, and only the US, can print at will.

The Mundell-Fleming thesis, for which economist Robert Mundell won the 1999 Nobel Prize,
states that in international finance, a government has the choice between (1) stable
exchange rates, (2) capital mobility and (3) policy autonomy (full employment/low
interest rates, counter-cyclical fiscal spending, etc). With unregulated global markets,
a government can have only two of those three options.

Through [military enforcement of] dollar hegemony, the United States is the only country
that has managed to defy the Mundell-Fleming thesis. For more than a decade, the US has
kept the dollar significantly above its real economic value, attracted capital account
surpluses and exercised unilateral policy autonomy within a globalized system dictated
by dollar hegemony. The reasons for this are complex but the single most important
reason is that all major commodities, most notably oil, are denominated in dollars,
mostly as an extension of superpower geopolitics. This fact is the anchor for dollar
hegemony. Thus dollar hegemony makes possible US finance hegemony, which makes possible
US exceptionism and unilateralism.

The Chinese economy is at a point where it also can defy the Mundell-Fleming thesis and
free itself from dollar hegemony.

China has the power to make the yuan an alternative reserve currency in world trade by
simply denominating all Chinese export in yuan. This sovereign action can be taken
unilaterally at any time of China's choosing. All the State Council (the Chinese
government's cabinet) has to do is to announce that as of, say, October 1, 2002, all
Chinese exports must be paid for in yuan, making it illegal for Chinese exporters to
accept payment in any other currencies. This will set off a frantic scramble by
importers of Chinese goods around the world to buy yuan at the State Administration for
Foreign Exchange (SAFE), making the yuan a preferred currency with ready market demand.
Companies with yuan revenue no longer need to exchange yuan into dollars, as the yuan,
backed by the value of Chinese exports, becomes universally accepted in trade. Members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which import sizable amount
of Chinese goods, would accept yuan for payment for their oil.

In 2000, the United States exported US$781.1 billion (12.3 percent of world exports - 11
percent year-to-year growth) and imported $1.2576 trillion (18.9 percent of world
imports - 19 percent year-to-year growth). Germany exported $551.5 billion (8.7 percent
of world exports - 1 percent year-to-year growth) and imported $502.8 billion (7.5
percent of world imports - 6 percent year-to-year growth). Japan exported $479.2 billion
(7.5 percent of world exports - 14 percent year-to-year growth) and imported $379.5
billion (5.7 percent of world imports - 22 percent year-to-year growth). France exported
$298.1 billion (4.7 percent of world exports - 1 percent year-to-year decline) and
imported $305.4 billion (4.6 percent of world imports - 4 percent year-to-year growth).
The United Kingdom exported $337 billion (5.1 percent of world export - 5 percent
year-to-year growth) and imported $284.1 billion (4.5 percent of world imports - 6
percent year-to-year growth).

China exported $249.3 (3.9 percent of world exports - 28 percent year-to-year growth)
and imported $225.1 billion (3.4 percent of world imports - 36 percent year-to-year
growth). Hong Kong exported $214.2 billion (3.2 percent of world exports- 19 percent
year-to-year growth) and imported $202.4 billion (3.2 percent of world imports - 16
percent year-to-year growth).

China (including Hong Kong) exported more than $463 billion (7.3 percent of world
exports) in 2000 and imported about $428 billion, yielding a trade surplus of around $35
billion. If all Chinese exports are paid in yuan, China will have no need to hold
foreign reserves, which currently stand at more than $200 billion. And if the Hong Kong
dollar is pegged to the yuan instead of the dollar, Hong Kong's $100 billion
foreign-exchange reserves can also be freed for domestic restructuring and development.

China's spectacular export growth has not reversed the shrinking of world trade volume
since 1997. Its growth has come at the expense of the now wounded &quot;tigers&quot; of Southeast
Asia. China is on the way to becoming a world economic giant but it has yet to assert
its rightful financial power.

There is no stopping China from being a powerhouse in manufacturing. With the Asian
economies trapped in protracted financial crisis from excessive foreign-currency debts
and falling export revenue resulting from predatory currency devaluation, the
International Monetary Fund, orchestrated by the US, has come to their &quot;rescue&quot; with a
new agenda beyond the usual IMF austerity conditionalities to protect Group of Seven
(G7) creditors. This new agenda aims to open Asian markets for US transnational
corporations to acquire distressed Asian companies so that their newly acquired Asian
subsidiaries can produce inside Asian national borders. The United States, through the
IMF, aims to break down the traditionally closed financial systems all over Asia that
mobilize high national savings to serve giant national industrial conglomerates, for
massive investment in targeted export sectors. The IMF, controlled by the US, aims at
dismantling traditional Asian financial systems and forcing Asians to replace them with
a structurally alien global system, characterized by open markets in products and,
crucially, in finance and financial services. The real target is of course China. For
the US knows: as China goes, so goes the rest of Asia.

Trade flows under neoliberal globalization have put Asian countries in a position of
unsustainable dependency on foreign loans and capital to finance export sectors that are
at the mercy of saturated foreign markets while neglecting domestic development to
foster productive forces and to support budding domestic consumer markets. In Asia,
outside the small circled of well-heeled compradores, most people cannot afford the
products that they produce in abundance for export or the high-cost imports. An average
worker in Asia would have to work days making hundreds of pairs of shoes to earn enough
to buy one McDonald's hamburger meal for his family while Asian compradores entertain
their Western backers in luxurious five-star hotels with prime steaks imported from
Omaha. Markets outside of Asia cannot grow quickly enough to satisfy the developmental
needs of the populous Asian economies. Thus intra-region trade to promote domestic
development within Asia needs to be the main focus of growth if Asia is ever to rise
above the level of semi-colonial subsistence.

The Chinese economy will move quickly up the trade-value chain, in advanced electronics,
telecommunications, and aerospace, which are inherently &quot;dual use&quot; technologies with
military implications. Strategic phobia will push the United States to exert all its
influence to keep the global market for &quot;dual use&quot; technologies closed to China. Thus
&quot;free trade&quot; for the US is not the same as freedom to trade. Still, China will
inevitably be a major global player in the knowledge industries because of its abundant
supply of raw human potential. Even in the US, a high percentage of its scientists are
of Chinese ethnicity. With an updated educational system, China will be the top producer
of brain power within another decade. As China moves up the technology ladder, coupled
with rising consumer demand in tandem with a growth economy, global trade flow will be
affected, modifying the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; predatory competitive game of a decade of
globalization among Asian exporters.

Asian economies will find in China an alternative trading partner to the United States,
and possibly with more symbiotic trading terms, providing more room to structure trade
to enhance domestic development along the path of converging regional interest and
solidarity. The rise in living standards in all of Asia will change the path of history,
restoring Asia as a center of advanced civilization, putting an end to two centuries of
Western economic and cultural imperialism.

The foreign-trade strategies of all trading nations in the decade of neoliberal
globalization have contributed to the destabilizing of the global trading system. It is
not possible or rational for all countries to export themselves out of domestic
recessions or poverty. The contradictions between national strategic industrial policies
and neoliberal open-market systems will generate friction between the United States and
all its trading partners, as well as among regional trade blocs and inter-region
competitors. The US engages in global trade to enhance its superpower status, not to
undermine it. Thus the US does not seek equal partners. With economic sanctions as a
tool of foreign policy, the US government is preventing, or trying to prevent, an
increasing number of US companies, and foreign companies trading with the US, from doing
business in an increasing number of countries. Trade flows not where it is needed most,
but to where it best serves the US national interest.

Neoliberal globalization has promoted the illusion that trade is a win-win transaction
for all, based on the Ricardian model of comparative advantage. Yet economists recognize
that without global full employment, comparative advantage is merely Say's Law
internationalized (Say's Law states that supply creates its own demand, but only under
full employment, a condition supply-siders conveniently ignore). After a decade, this
illusion has been shattered by concrete data: 30 percent of the world's population live
on less than $1 a day, and global wages, already low to begin with, have declined since
the Asian financial crisis of 1997, and by 45 percent in Indonesia.

Yet export to the United States under dollar hegemony is merely an arrangement in which
the exporting nations, in order to earn dollars to buy needed commodities denominated in
dollars and to service dollar loans, are forced to finance the consumption of US
consumers by the need to invest their trade surpluses in US assets (as foreign-exchange
reserves), giving the US a capital account surplus to finance its current account
deficit.

Furthermore, the trade surpluses are achieved not by an advantage in the terms of trade,
but by sheer self-denial of basic domestic needs and critical imports. Not only are the
exporting nations debasing the value of their labor, degrading their environment and
depleting their natural resources for the privilege of running on the poverty treadmill,
they are enriching the US economy and strengthening dollar hegemony in the process. Thus
the exporting nations allow themselves to be robbed of needed capital for critical
domestic development in such vital areas as education, health and other social
infrastructure, by assuming heavy foreign debt to finance export, while they beg for
even more foreign investment in the export sector by offering still more exorbitant
returns and tax exemptions. Yet many small economies around the world have no option but
to continue to serve dollar hegemony like a drug addiction.

Japan provides the perfect proof that even a dynamic, successful export machine does not
by itself produce a healthy economy. Japan is aware that it needs to restructure its
domestic economy, away from its export fixation and upgrade the living standard of its
overworked population and to reorder its domestic consumption patterns. But Japan is
trapped into helplessness by dollar hegemony.

Japan sees its sovereign credit rating lowered by international rating agencies while it
remains the world's biggest creditor nation. Moody's Investor Service downgraded
Japanese government bonds by two notches recently to A2, or one grade below Botswana's,
not to mention Chile and Hungary. Japan has the world's largest foreign-exchange
reserves: $446 billion; the world's biggest domestic savings: $11.4 trillion (US gross
domestic product was $10 trillion in 2001); and $1 trillion in overseas investment. And
95 percent of the sovereign debt is held by Japanese nationals, which rules out risk of
default similar to Argentina. Japan has given Botswana, where half of the population is
infected with the AIDS virus, $12 million in grants and $102 million in loans.

Why does the New York-based rating agency prefer Botswana to Japan? The Botswanan
government budget is controlled by the foreign diamond-mining interests to protect their
investment in the mines. Botswana does not run a budget deficit to develop its domestic
economy or help its poverty-stricken people. Thus Botswana is considered a good credit
risk for foreign loans and investment. Japan, on the other hand, is forced to suffer the
high interest cost of a low credit rating because its government attempts to solve,
through deficit financing, the nation's economic woes that have resulted from excessive
focus on export. Dollar hegemony denies a good credit rating even to the world's largest
holder of dollar reserves.

The Asia-Pacific trade system has been structured to serve markets outside of Asia by
providing low manufacturing production cost through the use of cheap Asian labor. This
enables the United States to consume more without inflation and without raising domestic
wages. Yet all the trade surpluses accumulated by the Asian economies have ended up
financing the US debt bubble, which is not even good for the US economy in the long run.
Cheap imports allow the US to keep domestic wages low and contribute to a rising
disparity of both income and wealth within the US where consumer purchasing power comes
increasingly from capital gain rather than rising wages. The result is that when the
equity bubble of inflated price-earning ratio finally bursts, wages are too low to keep
the economy from crashing from a collapse of the wealth effect.

After thoroughly impoverishing the Asian economies with financial manipulation of crisis
proportions, the US now works to penetrate the remaining Asian markets that have stayed
relatively closed: notably Japan, China and South Korea. Control of access to its
markets has been Asia's principal instrument for its sub-optimized trade advantage and
distorted industrial development. This strategy had been practiced successfully first by
Japan and copied with various degree of success by the Asian tigers. Protectionism will
survive in Asian economies long after formal accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO).

China, with a giant integrated market composed of a fifth of the world population, can
swap market access for technology transfer from the world's transnational technology
corporations. Once free from dollar hegemony, China can finance its domestic development
without foreign loans and capital. The Chinese economy then will no longer be distorted
by excessive reliance on export merely to earn dollars that by definition must be
invested in dollar assets, not yuan assets. The aim of development is to raise wage
levels, not to push wages down to achieve predatory competitiveness. Yet export under
dollar hegemony requires keeping wages low, a prerequisite that condemns an economy to
perpetual underdevelopment.

Terms such as &quot;openness&quot; need to be reconsidered away from the distorted meanings
assigned to them by neoliberal cultural hegemony. The contradiction between globalizing
and territorially based national social and political forces is framed in the context of
past, present and future world orders.

The emerging world order has always been, and will again be, the result of a struggle
for the direction of structural transformation of the current order, involving economic,
political and sociocultural changes. The prevailing trend of the past two decades toward
the marketization and commodification of social relations has led to the argument that
socialism needs to be redefined away from the total visions associated with
Marxism-Leninism, and toward the idea of the self-defense of society and social choice
to counter the disintegrating and atomizing effects of globalizing and unregulated
market forces. But this is precisely a Marxist-Leninist vision: that under
globalization, national sovereignty in the form of nation-states and governments will
give way to a pervasive socioeconomic order. In other words - the withering away of the
state.

The sole function of government is to protect the weak, because the strong is itself
government and needs no other. This truth gave birth to monarchism: the king's function
was to protect the peasants from aristocratic abuse. So in modern terms, the
government's function is to maintain socialist/populists values in the context of
capitalist market fundamentalism. So the withering away of the state prior to the end of
economic exploitation is putting the cart before the horse.

The unwitting by-product of the rightist quest to get government off the back of the
people is a Marxist dialectic. The only flaw is the economic structure. The right wants
the withering away of the state prior to the progressive transformation of capitalism
into socialism.

The perpetual boom has not replaced the business cycle, new economy or not. In the age
of information and communication, the majority interest will prevail - with luck,
without violence. Despite US fixations, majority interest does not necessarily spell
capitalism, corporatism or representative democracy. Socialism collapsed in the 1980s
not because its economic theories were inoperative, but because in defending the
authority to make socialist principles work, socialist governments had to adopt a
garrison-state mentality that overshadowed all other potential benefits. On the other
hand, capitalist market fundamentalism appeared more desirable as long as this mutation
of socialism was posed as a false alternative. Now, as the sole surviving operative
system, capitalist market fundamentalism is faced squarely with its own internal
contradictions. Unregulated markets have produced the debt bubble and financial
manipulation and corporate fraud that impoverish unsuspecting investors and workers who
placed their pensions in the shares of the companies that employed them. And the war on
terrorism runs the risk of instilling in the United States the same garrison-state
mentality that brought about the demise of the Soviet bloc.

Finance capitalism may turn out to be the deadliest enemy of industrial capitalism, and
it may well be the last transformation of capitalism. There are clear indications that
insufficient demand is caused by the abandonment of the labor theory of value and the
wholesale acceptance by neoliberalism of the theory of marginal utility. Lack of demand
caused by insufficient wages is more deadly to finance capitalism than the fear of
socialism. Technology has finally turned Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times into reality.
The rhetoric of the current political debate in the United States on corporate fraud is
more populist than those of the New Deal, and the recession has yet to begin in earnest.
Socialism, by other names (the Wall Street Journal calls it mass capitalism), is now
about to be viewed as the vaccine against a catastrophic implosion of the capitalist
system in its home garden.

Globalization is not a new trend. It is the natural policy for all empire building.
Globalization under modern capitalism began with the British Empire, marked by the
repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, five years after the Opium War with China (I have
written on the historical parallel between the Corn Laws and WTO), and two years before
the Revolutions of 1848. Great Britain embarked on a systemic promotion of free trade
and chose to depend on imported food, which gave a survivalist justification to empire.
France adopted free trade in 1860 and within 10 years was faced with the Paris Commune,
which was suppressed ruthlessly by the French bourgeoisie, who put to death 20,000
workers and peasants, including children. Despite a backlash movement toward protective
tariffs in Britain, Holland and Belgium, the global economy of the 19th century was
characterized by high mobility of goods across political borders. As Europe adopted
political nationalism, international economic liberalism developed in parallel, until
1914. Only World War I, the 1929 Depression and World War II caused a temporary halt of
free trade.

Like the United States now, Britain was a predominantly importing economy by the close
of the 18th century. Despite the Industrial Revolution's expanded export of
manufacturing goods, import of raw material, food and consumer amenities grew faster
than export of manufacturing goods and coal. The key factor that sustained this
imbalance was the predominance of the British pound, as it is today with the US dollar
and its impact of the trade deficit. British hegemony of marine transportation and
financial services (cross-currency trade finance and insurance) earned Britain vast
amounts of foreign currencies that could be sold in the London money markets to
importers of Argentine meat and Canadian bacon. International credit and capital markets
were centered in London. The export of financial services and capital produced the the
returns which serves as hidden surplus to cushioned the trade deficit. To enhance
financial hegemony, the British maintain separate dependent currencies in all parts of
the empire under pound-sterling hegemony. This financial hegemony is now centered on New
York with the dollar as the base currency. When the Asian tigers export to the United
States, all they get in return are US Treasury bills, not direct investment in Asia.
Asian labor in fact is working at low wages mainly to finance the expansion of the US
economy.

Market fundamentalism, a modern euphemism of capitalism, is thus made necessary by the
finance architecture imposed on the world by the hegemonic finance power, first
19th-century Great Britain, now the United States. When the developing economies call
for a new international finance architecture, this is what they are really driving at.
Foreign-exchange markets ensure the endless demand for dollar capital import by the poor
exporting nations. John A Hobson and Lenin identified the surplus of capital in the core
economies and the need for its export to the impoverished parts of the world as the
material basis of imperialism. For neo-imperialism of the 21st century, this remains
fundamentally true.

Then and now, the international economy rests on an international money system. Britain
adopted the gold standard in 1816, with Western Europe and the US following in the
1870s. Until 1914, the exchange rates of most currencies were highly stable, except in
victimized, semi-colonial economies such as Turkey and China. The gold standard, while
greatly facilitating free trade, was hard on economies that produced no gold, and the
gold-based monetary regime was generally deflationary (until the discovery of new gold
deposits in South Africa, California and Alaska), which favored capital. William Jenning
Bryan spoke for the world in 1896 when he declared that mankind should not be &quot;crucified
upon this cross of gold&quot;. But the 50-year lead time of the British gold standard firmly
established London as the world's financial center. The world's capital was drawn to
London to be redistributed to investment of the highest return around the world.
Borrowers around the world were reduced to playing a game of &quot;race to the bottom&quot;.

The bulk of economic theories within the context of capitalism were invented to
rationalize this global system as natural truth. The fundamental shift from the labor
value theory to the marginal utility theory was a circular self-validation of the
artificial characteristics of an artificial construct based on the sanctity of capital,
despite Karl Marx's dissection that capital cannot exit without labor - until assets are
put to use to increase labor productivity, it remains idle assets.

Mergers and acquisitions became rampant. Small business capitalism disappeared between
1880 and 1890. Workers and small businesses found that they were not competing against
their neighbors, but those on other sides of the world, operating from structurally
different socioeconomic systems. The corporation, first used to facilitate the private
ownership of railroads, became the organization of choice for large industries and
commerce, issuing stocks and bonds to finance its undertakings that fell beyond the
normal financial resources of individual entrepreneurs.

This process increased the power of banks and financial institutions and brought forth
finance capitalism. Cartels and trusts emerged, using vertical and horizontal
integration to eliminate competition and manipulate markets and prices for entire
sectors of the economy. Middle-class membership was mainly concentrated in salaried
workers of corporations, while the working class were hourly wage earners in factories.
The 1848 Revolutions were the the first proletariat revolutions in modern time. The
creation of an integrated world market, the financing and development of economies
outside of Europe and the consequence of rising standards of living for Europeans were
the triumphs of the 19th-century system of unregulated capitalism. In the 20th century,
the process continued, with the center shifting to the United States.

Friedrich List, in his National System of Political Economy (1841), asserted that
political economy as espoused in England at that time, far from being a valid science
universally, was merely British national opinion, suited only to English historical
conditions. List's institutional school of economics asserted that the doctrine of free
trade was devised to keep England rich and powerful at the expense of its trading
partners and that it had to be fought with protective tariffs and other protective
devices of economic nationalism by the weaker countries. List influenced revolutionaries
in Asia, including Sun Yatsen, who until coming under the influence of Marx and Lenin
after the October Revolution was primarily relying on List in formulating his policy of
economic nationalism for China. List was also the influence behind the Meiji Reform
Movement in Japan.

The current impending collapse of neoliberal globalized market fundamentalism offers
Asia a timely opportunity to forge a fairer deal in its economic relation with the West.
The United States, as a bicoastal nation, must begin to treat Asian-Pacific nations as
equal members of an Asian-Pacific commonwealth in a new world economic order that makes
economic nationalism unnecessary.

China, as the largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region, has a key role to play in
shaping this new world order. To do that, China must look beyond its current myopic
effort to join a collapsing global market economy and provide a model of national
domestic development in which foreign trade is reassigned to its proper place in the
economy from its current all-consuming priority. The first step in that direction is for
China to free itself from dollar hegemony.

IX CONCLUSION
The replacement of the US dollar as the
international currency for world trade, specially for
oil, with other competing currency as the Euro, for
the European Union or by the Yuan or Yen for the Asia
Pacific Region, will cause a just and fair World
Trade. It will also devalue the US dollar to its true
worth of about 40-20%. This means a reduction of
Thirld World Debts by about half.
The ASEAN LAW ASSOCIATION is a potent force
for this advocacy for an international currency for
World Trade, whose issuance is not in private hands,
to achieve just and fair trade, for the prosperity of
all, specially the underprivileged third world
countries.
