Kilini is in a tough spot, I just found out, G'ganna and I are in
shock. Kilini sent me the skinny about what is going on, they left
today for the Mayo Clinic. I need an address for them in Tampa, I have
Allans cell # but don't want to intrude.
Any help my brothers?

I knows ya and trusts ya, Bruce, but like I told Jill, IMNSHO it's kili and
TFM's place ta give ya their address. Call me and ask me for their phone #,
I'll call them and ask if they want me to give it to ya. I respect your
privacy in the same way.
