A very good friend of ours, sweetest lady in the world, got laid off
from our (Diane's and mine) company a month ago.  Tomorrow, two more
good friends, and a friend are getting laid off.  I know this because I
am the IT Systems Administrator and I have the job of shutting down the
login accounts, changing the access passwords, closing email, etc and I
can't tell them that they're getting the boot.  It's not that they're
bad at their jobs.  They're not.  They're good as a matter of fact.  But
the company has reached that stage of growth where it's no longer a
family-and-friends environment, and is now a &quot;business&quot; environment.  We
traded a warm, caring, adept, 50s-something receptionist that everyone
loved for a 20s-something blonde with perky tits that clients could
ogle.  Warm and family and reliable is out.  Eager and hungry and perky
is in.  It's kind of amazing to me that after almost 8 years of being
mostly quit, that I would still want to walk out behind the building and
smoke a butt to calm my stomach and my mind.  Just when you think you're
out of it, it tries to pull you back in.  I'm not going to.  But damn, I
want to. And I'm going to support Diane not doing so when she finds out
about the names of two of the people tomorrow.  This too shall pass.
This too shall pass.  This too shall pass.

Folks, I'm not telling you this to make you commiserate or to elicit
some kind of sympathy from you.  You just need to know that triggers are
going to come along.  And if you deal with them, they don't have to beat
you.  Smoking will not remove a problem.  It will add to it.

Stand strong.

I'm in the same boat Eddie, this company is constantly laying people off
then you hear about hiring and opening facilities in China, India, or
Eastern Europe. The CEO's and top executives today are all about managing
cost, they couldn't come up with an original idea if their bonus depended on
it, which it doesn't. When you hit the fifty mark and have been around long
enough to earn a decent salary that makes you a target when they can hire
someone right out of college and from a part of the world where they don't
have to worry about providing for health care and can pay a much less
substantial salary, it's cold but that is the reality of a global economy.
If parents are smart they should encourage kids to go into the trades; that
way can bilk the yuppie scum that don't care how much they pay to have their
toilet fixed because they have more disposable income then they know what
the do with. And through this all I never once consider smoking, but
hydrocodone that is another story ;)

Ugh Eddie, horrible stuff.  I am sorry you and your lovely wife must be part
of this mess.
Thoughts of smoking?  Natural, right?  I think that after 10-20-30-40 years
of smoothing our emotions over with a nicfix, it is bound to come back from
time to time.
You know better than most, it passes.  Not just the silly crave, my
dear...also the job-stress.

I think you are letting me know that I had better become very
comfortable with tools available to me.
No matter how long I've been without a cigarette, the time will come
when I'm blindsided by life.
Without thinking, I'm gonna reach out for something........
What's it gonna be...............

If those two are as good as you say, they will land on their feet.

I think that I had mentioned something like this in a previous message.
We all have triggers when we quit smoking.  One of my worst triggers
was being at bars and restaurants with friends...  Actually, that was
THE worst...  But I've beat them all, one by one.  I've handled one
death since I quit... so the next one will be less of a trigger, and
please don't misunderstand me... I'm not being cold about it... I'm just
saying... but I haven't handled a friend being laid off in 8 or 9 years,
so this particular trigger is just as powerful as any other stressful
situation I had handled at the beginning of quitting.  I'm frustrated
and I want relief.  But gawd... I don't want a cigarette.  I really
don't.  I don't want to feel my throat invaded by something burning and
dry.  I don't want to let myself down.  I've worked hard to get here as
you've worked hard to get to where you are, and we can never allow all
that work to be forgotten.  So, I reach for my wife and my dog (Bear)
and this group and a firm grip on my will.  I am going to be fine just
like you will be fine when...

&gt; Without thinking, I'm gonna reach out for something........
&gt; What's it gonna be...............

Life and self-determination and the power to help others win?

It's a good feeling to be strong and free, ya know??  It's good to be
independent.  It's good to be in control over one's self.  I wish I knew
at the beginning of my quit, what I know now.  I would have respected
people a lot more and not been so judgemental.  But I have grown as we

Eddie!  You are so right that there can always be a situation where a
trigger elicits a crave that can get out of control.  Part of our
gaining smobriety is learning how to handle and deal with them, but
it's an on-going process for the rest of our lives as there can always
be 'something' out there that we just are not prepared to deal with
that can end up with our smoking or sorely considering it.  I can
totally relate to how your company is changing and becoming a bean
counting bottom-line business that has no sole as most places are like
that any more.  It is definitely difficult to know ahead of the rest
of the organization who is going to be fired, especially when you have
worked with them for a long time and know how good a worker they are.

I am definitely glad that you did not give into your crave as it
certainly would not have solved a thing and only hurt your quit which
you have worked hard to gain.

Thanks Mike.  I just found out from one of your previous messages today
that you had in fact been here a year or two before I first showed up in
'99.  Good to meet another Maggie fan.  She gave me my first Ferrari
(silver Maranella 550) ya know....  For services rendered... (wink,
wink, nudge, nudge).  And when we last performed together... I was one
of her three backup singers...  But getting back to the stress thing for
a second...  Mike, I gotta tell you...  I hate liver.  I hate blood
pudding.  I hate cod liver oil.  I hate colonoscopies and
sigmoidoscopies.  And I especially hate bean-counters.  Some people
might say that all that hate isn't good for a person.  But every man
needs a hobby, and I haven't cleared out the garage to setup a new
N-Gauge layout yet, or get my ShopSmith working again, or help Diane
catalog her stamps.  So bean-counters (Voldemort/Sauron curse their
reproductive habits...) will have to remain my favorite target of
derision.  Thanks for the words Mike.

GREAT POST!
hang in there eddie!

when i came to AS3 as some of the &quot;old-timers&quot; will tell you, i did not know
the first thing about computers, and most times had my young son standing
behind my chair guiding me.
i KNEW that i needed the support of this group to stay stopped, but all
those computer mistakes of mine, sure seemed like a GREAT reason to smoke.
instead, i sucked like crazy on soda straws, sometimes making myself quite
dizzy, from inhaling so much air at once!
good lung exercise, and certainly got me through!

Hey Eddie!  I was around here from sometime in '96 through probably
the end of '99 as I did my first AIDSRide that year and I do remember
posting after finishing the ride from Boston as well as celebrating my
DOF while the 'Hallowe'eners including Miss Maggie, Slackr and Oeyvind
and others.  We used to write each other privately quite a bit,
especially at first as well as participating in AS3.  While I did not
keep that quit, I am still glad that I had over 3 years of good
breathing before screwing up and sucking poison again.  All I can say
now is that it's GREAT to be back here among the living and kicking
butt!

Seems to me that the company is trying hard to become a &quot;Bankruptcy&quot;
environment. If they are dumping good workers because they prefer
temporary workers, first of all the productivity will decrease but
also other good workers could think to send CV away.

Even if I'm a novice in quiiting smoking, I realize that I have learned
to cope with some problems with nicotine. People that never smoked
don't know this and don't think to smoke cigarettes.
I never learned to drive an Harley-Davidson motorbike, so it's
difficult that on a sunday afternoon I decide to relax making
a ride around some lake nearby on a 883.
By the way I can't drive an Harley Davidson: have to pass a motorbike
drive exam.

Hey Eddie,

I am so sorry to hear about this.  I go through it at my job too.  We're
not outsourcing but, because of the contract nature of the work we do,
contracts end and things change.  I sometimes find out about it before
they do, and I know that our IT guy often does.  it's stressful for him.

All I can say is that as much as we may all wish we could keep things
forever and ever the way we think we want them, it's just never going to
be that way.  With any luck, the people who move on will move on to better
situations, where they are appreciated.  At least, I hope so.  It sucks,
though.

Hugs to you and the missus :)

Eddie?  Diane?

You know I love you guys, eh?

I'm sorry to tack on to your message about the sadness of losing
friends.

I am thrilled to see you name, oh Mr. and Mrs. Otter -- it's otterly
lovely, is what it is.

I haven't been here in weeks, and I missed marking my eight year
anniversary on October 31, so this makes it absolutely wonderful
to see your name.

*smooch*!

mmm

Eight years and three days!
Yay, me!
Yay, you!
Yay, all of us who have quit for 1 second!
Yay!

Hi beautiful !! (shyly digging the toe of my shoe into the dirt)

Well... I don't mind I suppose... when she gets up, I'll ask Diane if
she wants to... and I have to say... it sounds a bit exciting... I've
never done it with two before...

We dropped by Norma's house for lunch on Friday, and she's doing fine.
She's going to stay home until pogey runs out, and then maybe get a part
time job helping out with local small businesses that don't need a
full-time employee.  I think that Suzi, Christie, and Nicole are going
to make out just fine as time goes on...  Here's the kicker Marilyn...
did you know that they can sack your sorry ass here without a reason,
and at any time?  No shit.  No worker protections to speak of.  As a
Canadian, you know that hit me with a shock at the beginning...

Aha!  Don't hand me that faux-worship (or is that fox-worship???)  I
know for a fact that you've got a giant life-sized nude poster of Jef
hanging and dangling above your bed... I know who your favourite
cheesecake (or is that beefsteak???) is my little Ottawegian strumpet!!! :-)

That is more than wonderful darlin.  Congratulations.  How are the lungs
(the inside ones... I'm sure the outside ones are just fine) and
everything else doing?  Consider yourself enveloped in a
nipple-flattening otter hug and being kissed by the second sexiest man
in the USA (I let Jef take first place cos he's &quot;delicate&quot;)...

It is stressful.  My problem right now is that I think it's making me
&quot;harder&quot; or colder.  God, I hope not...

The indications I'm getting are that life is moving on... as it would if
it were me or Diane in that position.  Deal with the shock, wake up and
have a coffee, call a few friends, go to a few interviews, get a new
job, and feel sorry for the poor shmucks stuck at the old place...

And you! :-)  How's the R man and married life doing?

...nice to see red paint all over the joint again...
