&quot;Hi! I was sent a request to join. I have a 10 week old great dane &amp; a
chocolate lab. We live in North Phoenix. I look forward to getting to
know fellow dog lovers!&quot;

Welcome to the group! I LOVE puppies!!! We will call you &quot;sam&quot; until
you have the chance to formally introduce yourself!

I'm Jennifer and also live in the North Phoenix Area. I am owned by 2
Great Danes, Bleu (8.5 yrs old) and Hank (3 yrs old). I can't wait
until your pup is old enough to visit at the park!! It will come SO
soon! But please feel free to come to any of our events in the
meantime, just to get to know some of us! This is a great group! I
hope you enjoy it!

Hi all! I didn't know how many letters I could fit in that small box.
Anyway, I'm the proud mommy to a wild 10 week old Great Dane named
Navy and my parents have a 4 year old chocolate lab named Abbie. Where
do I upload pictures of my trouble makers?

By the way thanks for the invite Dee!

You will see on the right menu bar &quot;Files&quot; you can upload pictures
there. This is a fairly easy site to navigate, but if you have any
questions just ask!!

So I uploaded pictures of the pups for everyone to see. Navy is a male
brindle pup. His name really has nothing to do with his colorings. My
boyfriend's a Fire Fighter so it was a toss up between Navy or Hoser.
I'll certainly be asking lots of questions, he's been much more of a
handful than my parent's Lab was!

Thanks for the warm welcome!!

Welcome to the group Samantha, Abbie and Navy.  I just took a look at
your photos!!!  What cuties!  I love puppies.  I am Erica and my
fiance is Jason.  We are the proud parents of great danes Luna and
Dakota.  I hear you when you say that Navy has been a handful.  Luna
is going on two years old and I never know what I might come home to.
She listens really well, it's just leaving her by herself.
Urgggghhhh!  I can't wait til she mellows.  Anywho, hope to meet you
out at one of the bark parks.

Erica, Jason, Luna &amp; Dakota

I am so jealous... I wanted either a brindle or a harlequin... well we ended
up with a semi-harlequin.... he's harlequin and merle mix.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome to the group Samantha, Abbie and Navy.  I just took a look at
&gt; &gt; &gt; your photos!!!  What cuties!  I love puppies.  I am Erica and my
&gt; &gt; &gt; fiance is Jason.  We are the proud parents of great danes Luna and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dakota.  I hear you when you say that Navy has been a handful.  Luna
&gt; &gt; &gt; is going on two years old and I never know what I might come home to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; She listens really well, it's just leaving her by herself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Urgggghhhh!  I can't wait til she mellows.  Anywho, hope to meet you
&gt; &gt; &gt; out at one of the bark parks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I uploaded pictures of the pups for everyone to see. Navy is a
&gt; male
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brindle pup. His name really has nothing to do with his colorings.
&gt; My
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boyfriend's a Fire Fighter so it was a toss up between Navy or
&gt; Hoser.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll certainly be asking lots of questions, he's been much more of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handful than my parent's Lab was!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the warm welcome!!

I really wanted a light merle mantle when I was looking. But they we
came across Zoe, who was Zoie at that point, and she was just too good
to pass up.  Her parents were selling her when she was about 5 months
old due to the fact that they were pregnant and didn't they didn't
think they could give her the attention they wanted to. She was
advertised as being in training with a &quot;Julie&quot; (I don't know her last
name!) but she runs the Great Dane drill team I think. She was coming
home with all of her toys and everything and the training would
transfer to the new owner.  That and she was just gorgeous when we met
her and such a good girl. We had to go through a little training of
our own, like teaching her she had to sleep on her own bed and not in
ours (drool... yeck!) and she had a little of a dominance problem when
we got her... she'd snap at your hands if you disciplined her. Luckily
she doesn't do that anymore and she listens well now. She's AKC, just
not registered because her previous owner's didn't have the money to
pay for her paper's and I only paid $350 for her!!!!! I love her, I
love her, I love her!!!!!!!
