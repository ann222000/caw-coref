To all you philosophers out there; time to earn your bread...

I probably have an old car battery laying about somewhere.  It's taking
up space in the garage.  I could use that extra room to get rid of it.
Now, I could drive down to the local gas station which is about 5 miles
down the road or I could dump it along the side of the road in a
drainage ditch which is only 1 or 2 miles down the road.  Driving to
the gas station is a pain you know when I could be playing on the
Internet instead.  If I drive to the gas station to "properly" dispose
of it, I'll miss probably 20 minutes of Internet time.  If I dump it
somewhere close I may only miss 5-10 minutes.  Of course if I drop it
in a drainage ditch the acid will eventually flow out into the local
eco-system or whatever it is we suburbanites have.  If I properly
dispose of it, maybe it could be chemically neutralized and its
constituent components returned harmlessly to the environment, I don't
know.  But what effect is that going to have on me if I dump it along
the side of the road?

Anyway, I really like doodling around on the Internet and am wondering
if there is any substantial reason at all why I should NOT dump the
battery along the side of the road somewhere.

Also I have another question for the enlightened.  I've been pretty
regularly donating blood for a few years now.  And I am now wondering
why should I bother doing this?  I could think of a lot more
entertaining things to do with my time.  In fact, I'm wondering why I
should do any charitable things.  What am *I* getting out of it?  I
could just as easily stop doing charitable things.  No big deal.  I
mean, why am I even doing them to begin with?  Is there any marked
difference at all between me and a guy who has never done a charitable
act in his life?

Yes, their brain structures are enough different that their behaviors are
different and their subjective experiences are different. That is a marked
difference. That consideration applies to your previous questions as well.

I really don't care about anyone's brain structures or subjective

to get rid of!  Where should I dump it off?  I'm thinking the curb down
the street is just as good a place for me as the closest "officially

Some points:

It's in your best interest not to pollute your own environment since
you live in that environment. People who don't grasp this are often
self-destructive in other ways since there own bodies are part of
the environment, as well. So you are basically asking me why you
shouldn't take a dump in the kitchen sink.

In general, when considering breaking the law, you need to do a
risk/benefit assessment. This is why there are often large fines
for doing trivial things you are not likely to get caught at, such as
$500.00 for littering.

It is often most efficient simply to do the right thing since it requires
the least effort in the long run. That battery may turn out to cost
you much more than a twenty minute schlep when you consider
you may be on the path to even greater social deviancy.

It depends. People contribute to society in different ways. If you
truly get nothing out of helping people, then you can save time
simply not. Not giving blood is better than polluting ground
water.

So I throw the battery a little further down the street away from my

from there.

Yeah, like anyone is going to catch me.  I'll do it in a wooded area.

"Greater social deviancy?"  So I'll just dump batteries by the road

Wait, you don't even know if you have the battery but you can use the
extra room it takes up? If your time is that valuable, move it out of
the garage to the side of the house. Keep it upright so the acid doesn't
drain out. The environment is safe, and more importantly you don't have

Now you got it. :-) Of course my wife says you should continue giving
blood because, "we are all part of the human race, and it serves all of
us good to do so."

The church says you should do charitable things (i.e., give them money)
because such selfless acts will get you rewarded in heaven.

I'm just a little more honest. I'll be nicer to you if you do charitable
things.

If you make a special trip to the battery disposal centre you will do
more environmentla harm then leaving it in your garden. Becasue 1) the
extra carbon emission from your car, 2) the battery centre is a place
that concentrates pollutats  - very bad - they sort of create their own
problem by gathering bad resources in one place.

Acid is not the real problem, Get a handful of chalk or a pack of
bicarbonate of soda - better still just pour it into the soil - it will
soon neurtalise. So tip it out.
The other potential problem is the palstic container and the lead alloy
inside. - Build the battery into a wall or somthing - or bury it more
than 2 feet under the soil - the lead will trickle out over the next
hundred years in such minute quantities that it will not harm anyone -
it will form harmless compunds in the soil.
The battery collection centre will only pollute the environment by
re-cycling or trying to make it safe.
Much of our so called "re-cycled" waste ends up being transported to
Indonesia where it is dumped cheaply inot a fukcing big hole in the
ground which ahs become a polluting mountain.

Have a good life!

True.  I could buy them from the store via six-pack instead of out of a
typical drink machine.  Then it may cost me something like 25 cents a
can.  So I am wrong.  I can combine the benefit I have gained from
giving blood (compared to someone who does nothing charitable) along
with 25 cents and buy a coke.  Still it seems that I and the one who
does nothing charitable are paying an identical amount for a coke.  My
charitable contribution doesn't seem to be helping me much.

Building the battery into a wall might take a bit of effort, probably
more than hopping in the car and dumping it along the road a short

sounds easier still.  If the acid won't hurt anything in the ground,
then what about the lead?  Will it do any harm laying in the ground?

Finally a somewhat 'worthwhile' post by our Mr. Childress [:)]...though of
course, cloaked in the facetiousness of his wry humor.  The question has
been tossed around here from time to time and it is about Altruistic
behavior.  Right?

Most rational models of human behavior I believe take the 'self interest'
approach.  Much of social science is based upon this rational model where a
person acts to maximize their personal gains [or to minimize their losses].
If we took these models 'absolutely', we'd all be doing just as Mr.
Childress suggests...throwing our batteries into the nearest ditch rather
than expend the extra energy to take them for proper disposal.   And our
local blood banks would have gone dry long ago as well.

2 Salient excerpts from Wikipedia:
"Neitzche asserts that altruism is predicated on the assumption that others
are more important than one's self and that such a position is degrading and
demeaning. He also claims that it was very uncommon for people in Europe to
consider the sacrifice of one's own interests for others as virtuous until
after the advent of Christianity. Ayn Rand argued that altruism is the
willful sacrifice of one's values, and represents the reversal of morality
because only rationally selfish ethics allow one to pursue the values
required for human life."

I think both of these people were idiots however [especially Rand].  Most
people exist with conscience and some sense of duty back to the whole and
need not defend such 'socially responsible' existence.  That intellectuals
could unravel such 'responsible behavior' and actually argue to dismantle
conscience should be eye opening to us that the intellect should always be
held highly suspect and always accountable to that conscience BEFORE our
conscience is accountable to it.

In fact, I think a deeper explanation of altruism comes by way of a
discussion of "Conscience"...what it is, how it is.  I think a clue [not in
Wikipedia] is to look at our mammalarian trait to 'nuture' our young.  That
trait, honed to elevated levels, inspires an 'emotional' state whereby
'self' is abstracted 'into' the group.  A parent sacrificing for their young
is no great thing to understand.  And the individual sacrificing for the
whole is extrapolated from this innate nature of the animal, to become
defining of the human [as conscience].

But it is emotional in origin I believe...this binding force that ties us.
I say fuck Neitzche and Rand and the horse they rode in upon.  The
intellectual, present and past, would dismantle that conscience and thereby,
revert us to dumb animals with no redemptive qualities whatsoever [and
cruelty maximized...not to mention let's trash the countryside]. Another
reason I hold onto my Christian roots OUT OF CHOICE. And Wikipedia is
becoming tyrannical in scope BTW [another important subject].

Considering that your doodling on the internet includes asking
questions such as the above, I strongly recommend that you dispose of
the battery with due regard to the Golden Rule, and to take your time
doing it.

In case you have never heard of the Rule, here's a time-saving

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also I have another question for the enlightened. I've been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty regularly donating blood for a few years now. And I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am now wondering why should I bother doing this?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If your reason isn't enough anymore then stop. Unless you have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my blood type and live near my city, I couldn't care less.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You get awfully upset when someone doesn't serve your specific
&gt; &gt; &gt; needs. Is that why I've been donating all this time, to keep you
&gt; &gt; &gt; mollified.

&gt; &gt; Why else? You apparently haven't gotten anything from it.

&gt; Then perhaps, in the future, I should simply lie and say that I am
&gt; donating blood when I am not. Then you would be happy and I would be
&gt; less inconvenienced. Perhaps this is the ideal solution, better even
&gt; than actually donating blood! Why would anyone want to donate blood?
&gt; We could all lie and say we donate and then spend the time surfing
&gt; the Internet!
">

You can certainly lie. It won't matter much anyway. It's not like I'm
going to be much nicer to you simply because you give blood.

If you really want me to be nice to you, you will be generous to me in
more direct ways (for example by buying goods from me or selling me
goods I need.) Ways in which lying is difficult. Of course, I doubt you
care to be all that nice to me, it's not like you are inviting me to
your house or anything.

Here are some dilemmas also;

What is the morally right thing to do in the following cases?

Be sure to discuss your reasons and possible alternative solutions to
the one that you propose. Is what you would 'actually' do different
from what you 'should' do? If so, why?

1. The sheriff in a southern town is guarding the courthouse against a
mob that is about to storm it by force, in order to capture a black
prisoner and lynch him even before his trial. If the mob is frustrated,
many people may be killed in the ensuing riot. Should the sheriff
deliver the prisoner to the mob?

2. Should the wealthier members of society be forced to pay through
taxation, for the poorer members? If so, how much?

3. A man has been sentenced to prison for armed robbery, and admits
guilt for the deed. "But", he argues,"I'll never do anything of the
kind again. I'm not insane or a danger to society. I would be happier
out of jail than in. My wife depends on me for support and she and the
children would be far happier if I were able to be the family
breadwinner again. As to the influence on others, almost no one would
ever know about it; you can keep the matter out of the newspapers and
no one except you will ever know that the crime was committed.
Therefore, you should release me" Assuming he is correct, what would
you do?

4. A rich man and a poor man commit the same type of crime. The rich
man is fined $10,000 while the poor man is sent to jail for one year.
Is this fair?

5. You are on a country road and see two neighbouring farm houses on
fire. One is yours and the other belongs to a new couple who just moved
in. Your wife and child are at home as are your neighbours. You can
only save one house. Which one do you save?

6. You run an orphanage and have had a hard time making ends meet. A
car dealership offers you a new van worth $15,000 for free if you will
falsely report to the government that the dealership donated a van
worth $30,000. You really need the van and it will give you an
opportunity to make the children happy. Do you agree to take the van?

7. You are shopping and notice a woman stuffing a pair of stockings
into her purse. Do you report her?

8. You are waiting with a few other people to board a bus. The bus
pulls up and before you can board the driver gets out and goes into the
convenience store to get a coffee. You are the last to get on the bus.
Do you pay your fare?

9. You discover Bill Gate's wallet lying on the street. It contains
$1000.00 Do you send it back to him?

10. It is 3 a.m. and you are late getting home. As you approach the
intersection you notice that no one is around. Do you drive through the
red light?

11. In Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment the main character
plots and carries out the murder of an old woman who has a considerable
amount of money in her apartment. After killing her, he steals the
money. He argues that 1) she is a malicious old woman, petty,
cantankerous and scheming, useless to herself and to society (which
happens to be true), and her life causes no happiness to herself or to
others; and 2) her money if found after her death would only fall into
the hands of chisellers anyway. Whereas he would use it for his
education. Is this action justified?

12. As a nurse, you are the last person to see Mr. Doe before he dies
in hospital. You believe that he has become mentally incompetent in the
last few hours and in that time he has rewritten his will. In the new
will he viciously attacks each member of his adopted family and reveals
that he actually was born a woman. He then cuts every family member out
of the will leaving his fortune to a Psychic Chatline . Mr. Jones asks
you to make sure that the new will gets to his lawyer. Knowing that the
document will most likely be thrown out of court but not before the
damage to Mr. Doe's family is done, do you carry out Mr. Doe's last
request?

13. Would it be justifiable to whip pigs to death if more succulent
pork resulted from this process, giving the consumers of pork more
pleasure?

14. Why punish the theft of $1000 more than the theft of $100?

15. Why punish attempted murder less than murder?

16. You are on a boat and nearby are two large rocks filled with
persons waiting to be rescued; there are five people on one rock and
four on the other. Assume that you cannot rescue both groups and that
you are the only one able to rescue either group. Which group do you
rescue?

17. You can only rescue one of each of the following, which do you
save?

a) A child or an adult

b) A stranger or your dog

c) Hitler or lassie

d) Your spouse or a Nobel Laureate

e) A dog or a weasel

f) Your entire family or the entire canine species

g) A bottle with the cure for cancer or your brother

h) A bottle with the cure for cancer or your brother who just gave you
one of his kidneys

18. Are the following acceptable grounds for a person to the life of a
non-human animal?

a) Its noise bothers you at night.

b) The wolf is killing your sheep.

c) Its meat makes a tasty dish.

d) You enjoy seeing it squirm.

e) The gophers are destroying your vegetable garden.

f) You just don't like snakes

g) The condor (an endangered species) keeps killing your prized carrier
pigeons.

h)I enjoy hunting.

19. Are any of the following situations objectionable?

a) Raising and killing rabbits for food.

b) Raising and killing rabbits for fur.

c) Clubbing baby seals over the head for fur.

d) Raising chickens under crowded conditions on wire netting.

e) Slitting open the bodies of cattle in slaughterhouses before they
are unconscious.

f) Using spontaneously aborted fetal tissue for treating Parkinson's
disease victims.

g) Using intentionally aborted fetal tissue for purposes of art.

h) A highly rated television show which depicts the actual torture of a
convicted criminal.

i) A highly rated television show which depicts the actual torture of a
poor homeless orphan.

j) Torturing a person (who will die from the injuries) as the only
means to find out where they have hidden a nuclear bomb.

20. Pick any one of the above 19 questions and try to consider why
someone might answer it differently than you. Can you offer reasons for
their views? Are any of these reasons persuasive?

Kindness explained
Skeptical Inquirer,  May-June, 2005  by Peter Lamal
Kindness in a Cruel World: The Evolution of Altruism. By Nigel Barber.
Prometheus Books, Amherst, New York. 2004. ISBN 1-59102-228-2. 415 pp.
Hardcover, $28.

Why do people donate their blood, leave tips for people they will never
see again, and throw themselves on hand grenades that are about to
explode? Nigel Barber makes a convincing case that altruism can be
understood as the result of evolutionary-adaptationist processes, and
he consistently applies an evolutionary-adaptationist framework
throughout his new book Kindness in a Cruel World. And in doing so, he
addresses questions about, and criticisms of, the concept of altruism
and its origins.

Barber defines altruism as "actions that help another individual at
some cost to the altruist." This approach enables us to include
nonhuman species in our consideration of altruism. As Barber notes, the
biological definition of altruism he advocates is sometimes criticized
on the grounds that supposed acts of selflessness are really only
selfishness in disguise. If altruistic behavior is biologically based,
it is only undertaken to make the altruist feel better, to increase the
reproductive success of the altruist, or to increase the prevalence of
genes for altruistic behavior. In response, Barber maintains that
altruism is real because it is predicated on evolved moral emotions
like empathy and shame. Furthermore, humans and other species can
engage in altruistic actions that have no ulterior motive, other than
whatever pleasure comes from the altruistic behavior itself. And there
might also be no delayed benefit for the behavior. In order for
altruistic tendencies to have evolved, it was not necessary that every
altruistic act should have a reproductive

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If your time is that valuable, move it out of the garage to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't have to waste the time and energy to even go the 1 or 2

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It would look sort of trashy laying outside, around the house.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Down the road I wouldn't have to look at it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, who are you trying to impress? It's easer to change your

&gt; &gt; Suppose I have company come over? Then they may see the battery

I crap not too far from where I eat.  The potty room is in the hallway

Does not similar apply to dumping the battery.  If I dump it just far
enough away from my house as to not pollute my ground water, then
should I not do that?  How far from my house is not far enough to leak
into the ground water which would directly affect me?  It sounds like

&gt; 2 Salient excerpts from Wikipedia:
&gt; &quot;Neitzche asserts that altruism is predicated on the assumption that others
&gt; are more important than one's self and that such a position is degrading and
&gt; demeaning. He also claims that it was very uncommon for people in Europe to
&gt; consider the sacrifice of one's own interests for others as virtuous until
&gt; after the advent of Christianity. Ayn Rand argued that altruism is the
&gt; willful sacrifice of one's values, and represents the reversal of morality
&gt; because only rationally selfish ethics allow one to pursue the values
&gt; required for human life.&quot;

&gt; I think both of these people were idiots however [especially Rand].  Most
&gt; people exist with conscience and some sense of duty back to the whole and
&gt; need not defend such 'socially responsible' existence.  That intellectuals
&gt; could unravel such 'responsible behavior' and actually argue to dismantle
&gt; conscience should be eye opening to us that the intellect should always be
&gt; held highly suspect and always accountable to that conscience BEFORE our
&gt; conscience is accountable to it.

&gt; In fact, I think a deeper explanation of altruism comes by way of a
&gt; discussion of &quot;Conscience&quot;...what it is, how it is.  I think a clue [not in
&gt; Wikipedia] is to look at our mammalarian trait to 'nuture' our young.  That
&gt; trait, honed to elevated levels, inspires an 'emotional' state whereby
&gt; 'self' is abstracted 'into' the group.  A parent sacrificing for their young
&gt; is no great thing to understand.  And the individual sacrificing for the
&gt; whole is extrapolated from this innate nature of the animal, to become
&gt; defining of the human [as conscience].

&gt; But it is emotional in origin I believe...this binding force that ties us.
&gt; I say fuck Neitzche and Rand and the horse they rode in upon.  The
&gt; intellectual, present and past, would dismantle that conscience and thereby,
&gt; revert us to dumb animals with no redemptive qualities whatsoever [and
&gt; cruelty maximized...not to mention let's trash the countryside]. Another
&gt; reason I hold onto my Christian roots OUT OF CHOICE. And Wikipedia is
&gt; becoming tyrannical in scope BTW [another important subject].

All of this seems a little abstract to me.  I don't see how I am going
to decide what to do with this battery based upon all this blabbering.

&gt; &gt; I probably have an old car battery laying about somewhere.  It's taking

&gt; &gt; the side of the road?

&gt; &gt; Anyway, I really like doodling around on the Internet and am wondering
&gt; &gt; if there is any substantial reason at all why I should NOT dump the
&gt; &gt; battery along the side of the road somewhere.

&gt; &gt; Also I have another question for the enlightened.  I've been pretty

&gt; &gt; why should I bother doing this?  I could think of a lot more

&gt; &gt; should do any charitable things.  What am *I* getting out of it?  I
&gt; &gt; could just as easily stop doing charitable things.  No big deal.  I
&gt; &gt; mean, why am I even doing them to begin with?  Is there any marked
&gt; &gt; difference at all between me and a guy who has never done a charitable
&gt; &gt; act in his life?

&gt; Considering that your doodling on the internet includes asking
&gt; questions such as the above, I strongly recommend that you dispose of
&gt; the battery with due regard to the Golden Rule, and to take your time
&gt; doing it.

I thought this was a pretty important question to ask.  I really want
to dispose of this stupid battery.  I guess I could go ahead and just
dispose of this battery without asking others where to dispose of it,
though.  I mean, why am I even consulting others about this?  That is
the strangest part.  Like anyone else is going to give me an answer
that is in MY best interest.  Everyone else is just going to tell me
what is in THEIR best interest.

I've heard of the golden rule.  But if I do unto others and then run,
that might be the better thing for me to do, especially since I'm

&gt; &gt; the side of the road?

&gt; Here are some dilemmas also;

&gt; What is the morally right thing to do in the following cases?

&gt; Be sure to discuss your reasons and possible alternative solutions to
&gt; the one that you propose. Is what you would 'actually' do different
&gt; from what you 'should' do? If so, why?

&gt; 1. The sheriff in a southern town is guarding the courthouse against a
&gt; mob that is about to storm it by force, in order to capture a black
&gt; prisoner and lynch him even before his trial. If the mob is frustrated,
&gt; many people may be killed in the ensuing riot. Should the sheriff
&gt; deliver the prisoner to the mob?

&gt; 2. Should the wealthier members of society be forced to pay through
&gt; taxation, for the poorer members? If so, how much?

&gt; 3. A man has been sentenced to prison for armed robbery, and admits
&gt; guilt for the deed. &quot;But&quot;, he argues,&quot;I'll never do anything of the
&gt; kind again. I'm not insane or a danger to society. I would be happier
&gt; out of jail than in. My wife depends on me for support and she and the
&gt; children would be far happier if I were able to be the family
&gt; breadwinner again. As to the influence on others, almost no one would
&gt; ever know about it; you can keep the matter out of the newspapers and
&gt; no one except you will ever know that the crime was committed.
&gt; Therefore, you should release me&quot; Assuming he is correct, what would
&gt; you do?

&gt; 4. A rich man and a poor man commit the same type of crime. The rich
&gt; man is fined $10,000 while the poor man is sent to jail for one year.
&gt; Is this fair?

&gt; 5. You are on a country road and see two neighbouring farm houses on
&gt; fire. One is yours and the other belongs to a new couple who just moved
&gt; in. Your wife and child are at home as are your neighbours. You can
&gt; only save one house. Which one do you save?

&gt; 6. You run an orphanage and have had a hard time making ends meet. A
&gt; car dealership offers you a new van worth $15,000 for free if you will
&gt; falsely report to the government that the dealership donated a van
&gt; worth $30,000. You really need the van and it will give you an
&gt; opportunity to make the children happy. Do you agree to take the van?

&gt; 7. You are shopping and notice a woman stuffing a pair of stockings
&gt; into her purse. Do you report her?

&gt; 8. You are waiting with a few other people to board a bus. The bus
&gt; pulls up and before you can board the driver gets out and goes into the
&gt; convenience store to get a coffee. You are the last to get on the bus.
&gt; Do you pay your fare?

&gt; 9. You discover Bill Gate's wallet lying on the street. It contains
&gt; $1000.00 Do you send it back to him?

&gt; 10. It is 3 a.m. and you are late getting home. As you approach the
&gt; intersection you notice that no one is around. Do you drive through the
&gt; red light?

&gt; 11. In Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment the main character
&gt; plots and carries out the murder of an old woman who has a considerable
&gt; amount of money in her apartment. After killing her, he steals the
&gt; money. He argues that 1) she is a malicious old woman, petty,
&gt; cantankerous and scheming, useless to herself and to society (which
&gt; happens to be true), and her life causes no happiness to herself or to
&gt; others; and 2) her money if found after her death would only fall into
&gt; the hands of chisellers anyway. Whereas he would use it for his
&gt; education. Is this action justified?

&gt; 12. As a nurse, you are the last person to see Mr. Doe before he dies
&gt; in hospital. You believe that he has become mentally incompetent in the
&gt; last few hours and in that time he has rewritten his will. In the new
&gt; will he viciously attacks each member of his adopted family and reveals
&gt; that he actually was born a woman. He then cuts every family member out
&gt; of the will leaving his fortune to a Psychic Chatline . Mr. Jones asks
&gt; you to make sure that the new will gets to his lawyer. Knowing that the
&gt; document will most likely be thrown out of court but not before the
&gt; damage to Mr. Doe's family is done, do you carry out Mr. Doe's last
&gt; request?

&gt; 13. Would it be justifiable to whip pigs to death if more succulent
&gt; pork resulted from this process, giving the consumers of pork more
&gt; pleasure?

&gt; 14. Why punish the theft of $1000 more than the theft of $100?

&gt; 15. Why punish attempted murder less than murder?

&gt; 16. You are on a boat and nearby are two large rocks filled with
&gt; persons waiting to be rescued; there are five people on one rock and
&gt; four on the other. Assume that you cannot rescue both groups and that
&gt; you are the only one able to rescue either group. Which group do you
&gt; rescue?

&gt; 17. You can only rescue one of each of the following, which do you
&gt; save?

&gt; a) A child or an adult

&gt; b) A stranger or your dog

&gt; c) Hitler or lassie

&gt; d) Your spouse or a Nobel Laureate

&gt; e) A dog or a weasel

&gt; f) Your entire family or the entire canine species

&gt; g) A bottle with the cure for cancer or your brother

&gt; h) A bottle with the cure for cancer or your brother who just gave you
&gt; one of his kidneys

&gt; 18. Are the following acceptable grounds for a person to the life of a
&gt; non-human animal?

&gt; a) Its noise bothers you at night.

&gt; b) The wolf is killing your sheep.

&gt; c) Its meat makes a tasty dish.

&gt; d) You enjoy seeing it squirm.

&gt; e) The gophers are destroying your vegetable garden.

&gt; f) You just don't like snakes

&gt; g) The condor (an endangered species) keeps killing your prized carrier
&gt; pigeons.

&gt; h)I enjoy hunting.

&gt; 19. Are any of the following situations objectionable?

&gt; a) Raising and killing rabbits for food.

&gt; b) Raising and killing rabbits for fur.

&gt; c) Clubbing baby seals over the head for fur.

&gt; d) Raising chickens under crowded conditions on wire netting.

&gt; e) Slitting open the bodies of cattle in slaughterhouses before they
&gt; are unconscious.

&gt; f) Using spontaneously aborted fetal tissue for treating Parkinson's
&gt; disease victims.

&gt; g) Using intentionally aborted fetal tissue for purposes of art.

&gt; h) A highly rated television show which depicts the actual torture of a
&gt; convicted criminal.

&gt; i) A highly rated television show which depicts the actual torture of a
&gt; poor homeless orphan.

&gt; j) Torturing a person (who will die from the injuries) as the only
&gt; means to find out where they have hidden a nuclear bomb.

&gt; 20. Pick any one of the above 19 questions and try to consider why
&gt; someone might answer it differently than you. Can you offer reasons for
&gt; their views? Are any of these reasons persuasive?

&gt; http://www.tru.ca/ae/php/phil/mclaughl/courses/ethics/bioeth/dilemmas...

&gt; &gt; Anyway, I really like doodling around on the Internet and am wondering
&gt; &gt; if there is any substantial reason at all why I should NOT dump the
&gt; &gt; battery along the side of the road somewhere.

&gt; &gt; Also I have another question for the enlightened.  I've been pretty

&gt; &gt; why should I bother doing this?  I could think of a lot more

&gt; Hardcover, $28.

&gt; Why do people donate their blood, leave tips for people they will never

&gt; explode? Nigel Barber makes a convincing case that altruism can be

&gt; throughout his new book Kindness in a Cruel World. And in doing so, he
&gt; addresses questions about, and criticisms of, the concept of altruism
&gt; and its origins.

&gt; Barber defines altruism as &quot;actions that help another individual at
&gt; some cost to the altruist.&quot; This approach enables us to include
&gt; nonhuman species in our consideration of altruism. As Barber notes, the
&gt; biological definition of altruism he advocates is sometimes criticized
&gt; on the grounds that supposed acts of selflessness are really only
&gt; selfishness in disguise. If altruistic behavior is biologically based,
&gt; it is only undertaken to make the altruist feel better, to increase the
&gt; reproductive success of the altruist, or to increase the prevalence of
&gt; genes for altruistic behavior. In response,

&gt; &gt; addresses questions about, and criticisms of, the concept of altruism
&gt; &gt; and its origins.

&gt; &gt; Barber defines altruism as &quot;actions that help another individual at
&gt; &gt; some cost to the altruist.&quot; This approach enables us to include
&gt; &gt; nonhuman species in our consideration of altruism. As Barber notes, the
&gt; &gt; biological definition of altruism he advocates is sometimes criticized
&gt; &gt; on the grounds that supposed acts of selflessness are really only
&gt; &gt; selfishness in disguise. If altruistic behavior is biologically based,
&gt; &gt; it is only undertaken to make the altruist feel better, to increase the
&gt; &gt; reproductive success of the altruist, or to increase the prevalence of
&gt; &gt; genes for altruistic behavior. In response, Barber maintains that
&gt; &gt; altruism is real because it is predicated on evolved moral emotions
&gt; &gt; like empathy and shame. Furthermore, humans and other species can
&gt; &gt; engage in altruistic actions that have no ulterior motive, other than
&gt; &gt; whatever pleasure comes from the altruistic behavior itself. And there
&gt; &gt; might also be no delayed benefit for the behavior. In order for
&gt; &gt; altruistic tendencies to have evolved, it was not necessary that every
&gt; &gt; altruistic act should have a reproductive payoff; rather, altruistic
&gt; &gt; behaviors should generally increase the biological success of those
&gt; &gt; acting altruistically.

&gt; &gt; The well-established principle of kin selection provides support for
&gt; &gt; the biology-driven perspective on altruism, and Barber points out that
&gt; &gt; the simplest and most widespread type of altruism is parental care of
&gt; &gt; offspring. The principle of kin selection is valuable, because it
&gt; &gt; allows us to make important predictions about people's behavior. But it
&gt; &gt; is important to bear in mind that the predictions derived from
&gt; &gt; evolutionary-adaptationist theory are about the behavior of groups, not
&gt; &gt; individuals. And Barber provides numerous examples of individuals who
&gt; &gt; have behaved selfishly.

&gt; &gt; Organisms are not born into and do not live in vacuums. As Barber
&gt; &gt; shows, environmental variation has as much to do with altruism (or its
&gt; &gt; absence) as with genetics. The famous experiments of Stanley Milgram
&gt; &gt; and Phillip Zimbardo are part of a large body of research that
&gt; &gt; indicates that aggression and discrimination, in addition to altruism,
&gt; &gt; are traceable to powerful forces of the social environment. As we have
&gt; &gt; been adapted for group life, the influences of our social environment
&gt; &gt; are understandable. This history explains the capacity of humans for
&gt; &gt; altruism toward strangers as well as the frequent hostility of members
&gt; &gt; of an in-group to members of an out-group. The sensitivity of human
&gt; &gt; altruism to the social environment means that it is weakened in
&gt; &gt; developed countries because of the lack of close relationships between
&gt; &gt; people and their neighbors. During our evolutionary history, we behaved
&gt; &gt; most altruistically toward those with whom we lived in close proximity
&gt; &gt; for long periods of time.

&gt; &gt; Barber maintains that among some mammals, including primates and
&gt; &gt; humans, &quot;moral emotions&quot; may be necessary for altruistic behavior. Such
&gt; &gt; moral emotions as guilt, embarrassment, outrage, empathy, and gratitude
&gt; &gt; are expressed in all human societies. For example, moral outrage at
&gt; &gt; cheats or &quot;free riders&quot; is a necessary enforcement system of reciprocal
&gt; &gt; altruism among humans, and it plays an important role in keeping people
&gt; &gt; honest.

&gt; &gt; In addition to his exposition of the concept of altruism and its
&gt; &gt; development in humans, Barber discusses the social impact of altruism
&gt; &gt; (kindness) on health, kindness among strangers, conformity as altruism,
&gt; &gt; and when altruism fails. As throughout the book, the topics are
&gt; &gt; illustrated with interesting examples. The book's last section deals
&gt; &gt; with altruism and politics broadly conceived and includes discussion of
&gt; &gt; the potential benefits and costs of religion, saving the environment,
&gt; &gt; and criminals (&quot;evil people&quot;). With respect to religion, it is clear
&gt; &gt; that religious belief is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition
&gt; &gt; for altruistic behavior.

&gt; &gt; Readers should be aware of the following: Contrary to Barber's glowing
&gt; &gt; description of Pitcairn Island, in 2004 (presumably after this book was
&gt; &gt; sent to the printer), the island's mayor and five other Pitcairnian men
&gt; &gt; were sentenced to prison for a string of rapes and sexual assaults
&gt; &gt; dating back forty years. Barber also conveys the distinct impression
&gt; &gt; that the Kyoto agreement to deal with the world's polluted atmosphere
&gt; &gt; is dead. This is not true. This book is written for a general audience
&gt; &gt; and includes citations of references for those who wish to delve
&gt; &gt; deeper. I highly recommend this book.

&gt; &gt; &gt; on the grounds that supposed acts of selflessness are really only
&gt; &gt; &gt; selfishness in disguise. If altruistic behavior is biologically based,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is only undertaken to make the altruist feel better, to increase the
&gt; &gt; &gt; reproductive success of the altruist, or to increase the prevalence of
&gt; &gt; &gt; genes for altruistic behavior. In response, Barber maintains that
&gt; &gt; &gt; altruism is real because it is predicated on evolved moral emotions
&gt; &gt; &gt; like empathy and shame. Furthermore, humans and other species can
&gt; &gt; &gt; engage in altruistic actions that have no ulterior motive, other than
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever pleasure comes from the altruistic behavior itself. And there
&gt; &gt; &gt; might also be no delayed benefit for the behavior. In order for
&gt; &gt; &gt; altruistic tendencies to have evolved, it was not necessary that every
&gt; &gt; &gt; altruistic act should have a reproductive payoff; rather, altruistic
&gt; &gt; &gt; behaviors should generally increase the biological success of those
&gt; &gt; &gt; acting altruistically.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The well-established principle of kin selection provides support for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the biology-driven perspective on altruism, and Barber points out that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the simplest and most widespread type of altruism is parental care of
&gt; &gt; &gt; offspring. The principle of kin selection is valuable, because it
&gt; &gt; &gt; allows us to make important predictions about people's behavior. But it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is important to bear in mind that the predictions derived from
&gt; &gt; &gt; evolutionary-adaptationist theory are about the behavior of groups, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals. And Barber provides numerous examples of individuals who
&gt; &gt; &gt; have behaved selfishly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Organisms are not born into and do not live in vacuums. As Barber
&gt; &gt; &gt; shows, environmental variation has as much to do with altruism (or its
&gt; &gt; &gt; absence) as with genetics. The famous experiments of Stanley Milgram
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Phillip Zimbardo are part of a large body of research that
&gt; &gt; &gt; indicates that aggression and discrimination, in addition to altruism,
&gt; &gt; &gt; are traceable to powerful forces of the social environment. As we have
&gt; &gt; &gt; been adapted for group life, the influences of our social environment
&gt; &gt; &gt; are understandable. This history explains the capacity of humans for
&gt; &gt; &gt; altruism toward strangers as well as the frequent hostility of members
&gt; &gt; &gt; of an in-group to members of an out-group. The sensitivity of human
&gt; &gt; &gt; altruism to the social environment means that it is weakened in
&gt; &gt; &gt; developed countries because of the lack of close relationships between
&gt; &gt; &gt; people and their neighbors. During our evolutionary history, we behaved
&gt; &gt; &gt; most altruistically toward those with whom we lived in close proximity
&gt; &gt; &gt; for long periods of time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Barber maintains that among some mammals, including primates and
&gt; &gt; &gt; humans, &quot;moral emotions&quot; may be necessary for altruistic behavior. Such
&gt; &gt; &gt; moral emotions as guilt, embarrassment, outrage, empathy, and gratitude
&gt; &gt; &gt; are expressed in all human societies. For example, moral outrage at
&gt; &gt; &gt; cheats or &quot;free riders&quot; is a necessary enforcement system of reciprocal
&gt; &gt; &gt; altruism among humans, and it plays an important role in keeping people
&gt; &gt; &gt; honest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to his exposition of the concept of altruism and its
&gt; &gt; &gt; development in humans, Barber discusses the social impact of altruism
&gt; &gt; &gt; (kindness) on health, kindness among strangers, conformity as altruism,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and when altruism fails. As throughout the book, the topics are
&gt; &gt; &gt; illustrated with interesting examples. The book's last section deals
&gt; &gt; &gt; with altruism and politics broadly conceived and includes discussion of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the potential benefits and costs of religion, saving the environment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and criminals (&quot;evil people&quot;). With respect to religion, it is clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; that religious belief is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition
&gt; &gt; &gt; for altruistic behavior.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Readers should be aware of the following: Contrary to Barber's glowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; description of Pitcairn Island, in 2004 (presumably after this book was
&gt; &gt; &gt; sent to the printer), the island's mayor and five other Pitcairnian men
&gt; &gt; &gt; were sentenced to prison for a string of rapes and sexual assaults
&gt; &gt; &gt; dating back forty years. Barber also conveys the distinct impression
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the Kyoto agreement to deal with the world's polluted atmosphere
&gt; &gt; &gt; is dead. This is not true. This book is written for a general audience
&gt; &gt; &gt; and includes citations of references for those who wish to delve
&gt; &gt; &gt; deeper. I highly recommend this book.

Well if it's a pretty girl I might want her to be impressed with me.
Most pretty girls seem to be somewhat concerned with neatness.

Of course, you could be on to something here.  Perhaps I shouldn't
worry about company.  To heck with them.  I'll leave the battery out in
the yard somewhere along with the garden hose and mulch bags.  What do
I care if anyone sees it.   If a pretty girl doesn't like my way of
life, then maybe she isn't the right girl for me.  Maybe I'll do that
then.

Of course. However, maybe it's in YOUR best interest to defer the

This seems to make a lot of sense to me.  I mean, dumping the battery
down the street.  I would have to keep it secret for the rest of my
life or else face communal scorn.  It is difficult to keep secrets.
The more secrets I keep the less I trust and confide in others.  The
less I trust and confide in others, the more lonely and isolated I will
feel.  The more lonely and isolated I feel the poorer my quality of
life.  Right?

&gt; I concede your point. Perhaps there isn't much reason for me to do
&gt; anything with the battery except lay it out in the yard somewhere. If
&gt; I'm acting on self interest, then I should definitely leave the battery
&gt; in the lawn somewhere.

&gt; &gt; You started off this thread acting like you were going to be selfish and
&gt; &gt; now all you seem to be able to do is worry about others.

&gt; Well I don't want other people to be after me. That's why I suggested

Again, you are worrying about what others think. If they "come after
you" just go somewhere else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True. I could buy them from the store via six-pack instead of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of a typical drink machine. Then it may cost me something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like 25 cents a can. So I am wrong.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still being charitable I see. You are spending 25 cents a can for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that harms you simply so the coke-a-cola company can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How is coke-a-cola harmful?

&gt; &gt; It cost 25 cents, that's how.

&gt; But if I want a coke more than I want the 25 cents then it would be in
&gt; my interest to buy the coke wouldn't it?

No, the only reason you want the coke is because they keep begging you
to buy it for more than they think it's worth. Why should you be so
generous?

Sure, but it depends on the person. Some can keep secrets without the
associated guilt, some cannot. If you are the former type, you can
just dump the battery wherever, and be happier for it.

&gt; I probably have an old car battery laying about somewhere.  It's taking
&gt; up space in the garage.  I could use that extra room to get rid of it.
&gt; Now, I could drive down to the local gas station which is about 5 miles
&gt; down the road or I could dump it along the side of the road in a
&gt; drainage ditch which is only 1 or 2 miles down the road.  Driving to
&gt; the gas station is a pain you know when I could be playing on the
&gt; Internet instead.  If I drive to the gas station to &quot;properly&quot; dispose
&gt; of it, I'll miss probably 20 minutes of Internet time.  If I dump it
&gt; somewhere close I may only miss 5-10 minutes.  Of course if I drop it
&gt; in a drainage ditch the acid will eventually flow out into the local
&gt; eco-system or whatever it is we suburbanites have.  If I properly
&gt; dispose of it, maybe it could be chemically neutralized and its
&gt; constituent components returned harmlessly to the environment, I don't
&gt; know.  But what effect is that going to have on me if I dump it along
&gt; the side of the road?

&gt; Anyway, I really like doodling around on the Internet and am wondering
&gt; if there is any substantial reason at all why I should NOT dump the
&gt; battery along the side of the road somewhere.

Great question.  You've found a new and interesting twist to the 'why
be moral?' question.  Note that for a reason to be 'substantial', it
has to be one you find convincing.  Lots of reasons have been given by
philosophers in the past, but no one finds any one of them convincing.
They can be roughly assigned to five different groups:
1)  Social:  Someone will see you, not like it, and do something to
you; or tell the owner, who'll do something to you.
2) Legal: Someone will see you and 'report it to the proper
authorities', who'll do the same.
3) Religious: a god will see you and do the same.
3) Psychological: Some will tell you that you're motivated by other
things than self-interest - empathy and honor are biggies - and that
either you'll feel guilt after the fact, or you're a psychopath.
4) Ethical: Some will offer you reasons why it is in your self-interest
to have (and therefore support) a system where people do not inflict
their garbage on others..

&gt;&gt; &quot;A little further down the road&quot; is the gas station. Without
&gt;&gt; that presumption, there really isn't any way to have a
&gt;&gt; meaningful discussion about this.

&gt; But the closest gas station in my neighborhood is about 5 miles away,
&gt; in my original post.  I could probably find a secluded wooded area much
&gt; closer than that.  So it seems to make more sense to dump the battery

"[M]akes more sense" is most likely meaningless without
a context. We know it doesn't make more sense when the
environment is the primary concern. We know it doesn't
make more sense when the welfare of others is the primary
concerned. We know it doesn't make more sense when
obeying the law is the primary concern.

It is here we see the perverseness of your reasoning: it is
precisely *because it would be easier for you not to dispose
of the battery properly* that there is a moral imperative for
you to do so. "

"Makes more sense in my own selfish self-interests" can't
be a legitimate standard since there are so many competing
interests. Two people couldn't make the same statement
and have it mean the same thing since ethical statements
would be of the sort "Here I am."

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Also, if you bought the battery, it was implied that you would
&gt;&gt; dispose of it properly.

&gt; The only thing I recall signing when I bought the battery was the
&gt; credit card receipt.  I don't remember there being a clause on it about
&gt; disposal of the battery, however, I could be wrong about that.  If I am
&gt; wrong and there was an implied duty to dispose of the battery properly,
&gt; then I'm thinking that breaching this agreement is just as favorable,
&gt; if not more so, than abiding by it.  Who would know if I breached the
&gt; contract?  So I breach it and save all that time.  Big deal.
">

Since my main line of argument for things like this is based
on the concept of a social contract of some sort, this reply
nips that in the bud.

There simply is no reason to do anything other than what is
in accord with your own nature. All attempts to instill
conformity in you can only be seen as crimes against your
humanity, such as it is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; That's part of the social contract.

&gt; I haven't signed any &quot;social contract&quot; that I can recall.  Is anyone
&gt; here a signatory of this contract.  I have certainly heard of it, yet
&gt; no one has ever produced it to me nor given me a good reason to sign
&gt; such a document.
">

You derive benefits from living in a civilized society. Only an
extremely naive or immature person would feel there is no
price to be paid for this. Some people go out of there way not
to pollute the environment because it lowers property values.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But anyone even moderately clever can come up with objections
&gt;&gt; to my suggestions. So it really comes down to the kind of
&gt;&gt; person you are.

&gt; I must be a bad person then, because I seem to be coming up with all
&gt; these objections.  Still, tossing the battery down the road somewhere
&gt; sounds like a good idea on the face of it.  Or is there some kind of
&gt; dissadvantage to being a &quot;bad&quot; person which I am not seeing?
">

The main one for things like this is "loss of social currency"
if you are found out. You also lose the ability to complain
without being a hypocrite if some one dumps garbage on
your property.

It's also more difficult to determine what others could justify
using your own logic. "You broke the law against me" would
likely mean very little; now it's what degree of harm is justifiable.

Accidental poisoning? That seems fine because your conduct
may result in that for others. So some toxic waste disposal
company decides to dump stuff right next to your well water
because they could all get home 20 minutes sooner and
watch TV.
