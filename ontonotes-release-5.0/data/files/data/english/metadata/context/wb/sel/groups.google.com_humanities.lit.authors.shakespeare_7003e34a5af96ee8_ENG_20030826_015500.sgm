Welcome to the club, Janice. Nice job. (Farey might call you on
&quot;text-complex&quot; though, if he treats you the same as everyone else.)
By the final couplet do you mean HLASers prefer prose speculation to
poetry or what?
Thus far, by my count, besides me, only Lorenzo, Farey--and now
you--have posted serious rime royal verses on teh authorship topic.
Reedy, Grumman, Brennen and Kennedy have also attempted it with uneven
success. Still waiting for Big John Kennedy to weigh-in. And I
wouldn't be suprised if Farey composes 265 stanzas all by himself (as
Shakespeare did for Lucrece). I wish Lorenzo would post some more,
though. I was just beginning to get the hang of it.

yo, yo, Lorenzo, my new friend,
Won't you compose new verses for this thread
About old Ned--or better, Kit? Pretend
You read the news of Marley first instead,
And learned the muses' darling wasn't dead!
For if that's so, you've got a richer story
About a broken bough, and fallen glory.

Anyone who wishes to &quot;set me straight&quot; please do so in RIME ROYAL, or
take it to another thread, okay? This one is reserved for
high-falutin' verse, the form used by the great poet William
Shakespeare in his narrative masterpiece about the the end of tyranny
and the founding of a republic.

Found your guy, Dave. However, being old news, it may not suit your drift...

&quot;Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The
register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name was good upon
'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to.

Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to
regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the
wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not
disturb it, or the Country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat,
emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.&quot;

whatever, dude. It still doesn't scan, and you stole two of Marlowe's
lines, but it's better than your first abysmal effort. But you are SO

going to start making a POSITIVE contribution to the group? I hope you

Well, it scans if you accept the 6th line as sprung:

And a-GAIN / SHOWS / that DOG- / ger-EL / is KING!

-- though I'm not sure that &quot;sprung rhyme royal&quot; is a recognized
category, and, unfortunately, once you allow sprung rhythm, the
consonant clusters make the 7th line read more naturally as an Alexandrine:

TRU-ly, / it SEEMS, / that DUMB / BIRDS / MAY / now SING.

Lorenzo, you're the dickens, sure you are,

I can't come up with a truly convincing non-sprung scanning of the sixth

AND a- / GAIN shows / that DOGG- / er- EL / is KING!

and

AND a- / GAIN SHOWS / that DOGG- / er- EL / is KING!

are both theoretically possible, but I can't make myself believe in
either one. That &quot;-gain shows&quot; is just too damn quantitatively spondaic
to be a single foot in non-quantitative iambs, and lacks the rhetorical
weight to justify it.

Egeus and Peter Quince. (At one point I was also to be Philostrate, but
the text is somewhat cut and the director decided to drop the character
altogether, with a handful of his lines distributed to other characters.)

It's an amateur production. The director, some staff, and about half
the cast are people I know from the NJ Renaissance Kingdom, though it is
under another aegis.

This should be interesting for me. It's a basic little-black-box space,
with about 75 seats, and, having done mostly musicals, opera, operetta,
and Ren-faire, I've never before performed in a venue with a capacity of
less then about 500. Quite a few of my performing instincts will have
to be readjusted.

Well, Peter, that makes you an expert...but it contradicts what others

ELS monograph series. ; no. 74?

Just so you can clarify for me and others who thought that iambic
pentameter was dominantly dah-DAH (repeated five times per line,
although variation can break monotony and boost the meaning, if not
handled skillfully, the reader will trip on the lines, as I did on the
ones above).

The last three lines of the verses above do not:

for instance the line

Lowercase does go on, and on, and now

would scan better as:

Old lowercase goes on and on, and now ...

wouldn't it? The other lines also fall short of that standard as well.

Even the line &quot;and burned is Apollo's laurel bough&quot; isn't pentameter
(because only the very pretentious would pronouce it burn-ED, as
Marley would have. Better as

And burned [to ash] Apollo's laurel bough

So enlighten me -- us-- how those lines are iambic pentameter. Or must

The truth is that explaining how metre works is a complex issue, even though
it feels simple to recognise and produce metrical lines, exactly as
explaining how grammar works is a complex issue, even though it feels simple
to recognise and produce grammatical utterances: this is just the way that
language-systems work. So yes, you'll need to read the book if you really

My own work doesn't suggest that quantity, though hugely important to poetic
rhythm, has any input into the metrical determination of a line (thank
goodness, since it already involves lexical and syntactic stress,
contrastive and focal accent and syntactic juncture). Quantity in English
verse is like stress in Classical Latin verse: a rhythmical embellishment
that cannot be 'seen' by the metrical rules. Metrically (though not
rhythmically) &quot;And again shows that doggerel is king&quot; is similar to a line
of Pope's such as &quot;And the press'd watch returns a silver sound&quot; (&lt;Rape of

You seem to be ignoring sprung rhythm altogether. And even if quantity
is not a recognized aspect of formal English scansion before Hopkins, it
has always been active in folk verse, and I truly think both that it can
be sufficient to make a train wreck of a line, and that in this case it has.

Maybe it's the lightness of &quot;a-&quot; in &quot;again&quot; compared to &quot;the&quot; in &quot;the

John is correct that there is a rhythmical difference between the two lines,
and that the Pope is smoother, but we speak such different languages that it
didn't seem worth trying to explain it. In terms of my theory, the second
syllable of &quot;again&quot;, being fully stressed (because not syntactically
subordinated under the Nuclear Stress Rule to the word that follows, unlike
&quot;press'd&quot;), constitutes a 'heavy mapping', which is legitimate but always a
little strained (Milton uses it to suggest effort or difficulty, most
notoriously in the line &quot;*Rocks, caves, *lakes, fens, *bogs, dens and shades
of death&quot;, heavy mappings asterisked). Scansion doesn't work too well in
Usenet, because the fonts make it hard to get vertical alignment, but I'll
have a go (@= 'inhibited syllable', because I can't find an O-macron):

&quot;And the press'd watch returns a silver sound&quot;
O @--a------A o-A o-A-o A
S-----w w------S w-S w-S w--S

&quot;And a*gain shows that doggerel is king&quot;

Just think about it, folks, for a short spell:
Rime Royal (when it's right) can not be false!
That's why no Strat or Oxfrod [sic] dudes can tell

Since neither camp has evidence or balls.
True poets will agree Kit wrote *Lucrece*
Unless Will's fans &quot;step up&quot; and state their piece.

I doubt it can be done, to tell the truth:
The facts cannot be forced to fit his case--
Like thinking an old man can cut a tooth.
In 1594, none scribbled plays:
The bard back then wrote narrative most days.
But William would've had to earn a living;
He had close kin to whom he would be giving.

And how'd he learn to write without a trace
Of Warwick dialect in that long poem?
And write rhetorically in every phrase?
At 12, he'd left his school to work at home
And six years on, hitched up, a kid to come.
Now how in all gods' names could it be done?
Though smoking, there're no bullets in Will's gun.

And Oxford is another instance of
A lack of Latin credibility,
Though his supporters think he is above
All others born of no nobility.
(Though Bacon is possibility.)
We'll never know, I guess-- their tongues are tied,
But I, like Lord Randall, can say &quot;I tried.&quot;

Third to last line should read &quot;*a* possibility&quot;.

Other than that, the silence of the Strats and Oxfrodians proves my
point. Both camps are like groupies, who can't write poetry
themselves, so they worship an illiterate bumpkin (or a highborn
lowlife) who didn't have the education or technical skill to write a
literary masterpiece like *Lucrece* in 1594 (or any other year, for
that matter).

The attempt by Crowley and other ignoramuses to belittle Shakespeare's
achievement, by calling it juvenile only reveals their own
incompetence. Crowley can't even write ONE single stanza of rime
royal, yet he says the author wrote it before puberty. Stratfordians
have a different problem: their man was an &quot;upstart crow&quot; when Venus &amp;
Adonis was written. And apparently they can't write
&quot;Shakespearean-style&quot; poetry.

Others have doubted my contention that the inability to write poetry
diminishes one's authority for judging poetry competently. Of course,
everyone is entitled to an opinion, but not all opinions are equally
valid. Out of shape arm-chair quarterbacks can toss and catch a
football. Most tennis fans can hit the ball over the net a few times.
Even people in wheelchairs can shoot baskets, but Stratfordians can
not write even a single stanza of &quot;rime royal&quot; to prove that their
(unlettered) hero could have written it.

I'm certain that of those who have written &quot;acceptable&quot; rime royal in
this thread (acceptable meaning ABOUT Shakespeare, not about me,
written in true iambic pentameter, riming ababbcc)...none would
minimize the author's great achievement in *Rape of Lucrece* -- 265
STANZAS of rime royal on an important topic (the elimination of
tyrants and establishment of republic), dedicated to a young nobleman
on the rise. Most definitely superior to oranges this time of year.
And much better than shallow (if entertaining) concoctions like Titus
Andronicus and Comedy of Errors. Lucrece was deep, in more ways than
one.

Now here's one for the grave and wiser sort:
The man who wrote *Lucrece* had been to court.
He wrote the poem on purpose, not for sport,
To give a revolution his support;
For most who read Lucrece, well understood
Between the lines the message: change was good--
Especially from tyranny, and well it should
By Jove and folks be overthrown (it would).

Not rime royal verse I know,
but maybe soon it will so flow,
But now it's your turn, reader, yo,
stop arguing in so-so prose
and picking one another's nose
if you know who wrote all those
rime royal verses, prove it:
william, francis, ned or kit--
In verses lyrical and accurate,
perhaps a metaphor, if one will fit.

Actually, very few Shakespeare-affirmers worship him. Crowley will

Comedy of Errors was vastly superior to Lucrece. Have you ever

That's nonsense, as usual. Here are some of the reasons the non-self-deluded
believe that Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the works:

His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
(&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST,
READ IF THOV GANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST
WITH IN THIS MONVMENT SHAKSPEARE: WITH WHOME,
QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

(&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm! ...

I'm glad you said people &quot;like&quot; Keats, rather than people &quot;such as&quot;
Keats. Keats was extremely highly educated. He attended Enfield
Grammar School (Grammar School in England was akin to high school in

my favourite poet and I passed the exams which allowed me to go to
Enfield County, the school for girls next door. However, he did attend
a little earlier than I. :)

He then went on to study medicine and become an apothecary, studying
privately (with an apothecary and a surgeon) and at Guy's. His test
results were exemplary. I believe he was the youngest man ever to
pass.

Although one likes to believe that Shakespeare attended Stratford
Grammar School, we of course have no confirmation of this as the
records are lost. It appears he didn't attend university. Whether he
was or was not the author of the canon, his formal education can in no
way be compared to that of Keats.

No, I actually wrote what I meant. Shakespeare may have attended

what we now call post-secondary education. Not only that, we have a

I have no idea, Jim. I don't believe I suggested that there was
anything particular in his formal education which gave him the ability
to write great poetry, although I imagine a study which investigated
parallels between his education and his poetry would turn something up
about the kind of topics he chose and the mythopoeic language he
employed. In addition, I expect that his being taught to read was
somewhat helpful.

Baloney. He didn't &quot;study privately,&quot; but became an apprentice
surgeon, just as Shakespeare almost certainly became the equivalent of
an actor's apprentice.
He then spent a year at a trade school, so--technically--had slightly
more formal education than Shakespeare. He got a tradesman's
certificate at the age of twenty. I quite doubt he was the youngest
to achieve this.

It was closely similar to Keats's but not as similar to Keats's as to

Actually, Bob, i only recall that you did, I quote:

&lt;&lt;His name was on a group of major plays
that have become so widely shown and known,
and given such (at times excessive) praise,
they've sent a shock wave through the looney zone
that's energized a horde of wacks to drone,
&quot;He never wrote a line of poetry!
Forget the facts, what we dream up must be!&quot;&gt;&gt;

Not a bad effort. Can you explain how he could have written Lucrece or
Venus &amp; Adonis? (in verse, of course. :-))

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; so they worship an illiterate bumpkin

&gt; Actually, very few Shakespeare-affirmers worship him. Crowley will
&gt; certainly verify that. Aside from that, we KNOW Shakespeare of
&gt; Stratford was not illiterate. And, if a bumpkin, an oddly successful
&gt; one.

"/>

I should have said &quot;unlettered&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; (or a highborn
&gt;&gt; lowlife) who didn't have the education or technical skill to write a
&gt;&gt; literary masterpiece like *Lucrece* in 1594 (or any other year, for
&gt;&gt; that matter).

&gt; Many poems better than Lucrece have been written by people like Keats,
&gt; who had no more formal education than Shakespeare.

"/>

No one in teh Renaissance did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The attempt by Crowley and other ignoramuses to belittle Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; achievement, by calling it juvenile only reveals their own incompetence.

&gt; Hazlitt said about the same thing. I certainly wouldn't call it
&gt; juvenile, just less than great.

&gt;&gt; Crowley can't even write ONE single stanza of rime
&gt;&gt; royal, yet he says the author wrote it before puberty. Stratfordians
&gt;&gt; have a different problem: their man was an &quot;upstart crow&quot; when Venus &amp;
&gt;&gt; Adonis was written.

&gt; How is that a problem?

"/>

Because V&amp;A and Lucrece are major poetic achievements. Not the work of
an upstart. They're mature masterpieces.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And apparently they can't write &quot;Shakespearean-style&quot; poetry.

&gt; We've shown at HLAS that we can write it as well as you. See my play
&gt; Werebird for a demonstration of dramatic blank verse. It's on the
&gt; Internet.

"/>

You wrote a stanza, yes you did. That's all the Strats have offered.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Others have doubted my contention that the inability to write poetry
&gt;&gt; diminishes one's authority for judging poetry competently. Of course,
&gt;&gt; everyone is entitled to an opinion, but not all opinions are equally
&gt;&gt; valid. Out of shape arm-chair quarterbacks can toss and catch a
&gt;&gt; football.

&gt; And tell a good player from a poor. For decades in the middle of the
&gt; last century Yale had the best collegiate swimming team. It was
&gt; coached by a man who could not swim.

So maybe an unlettered man wrote Lucrece?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Most tennis fans can hit the ball over the net a few times.
&gt;&gt; Even people in wheelchairs can shoot baskets, but Stratfordians can
&gt;&gt; not write even a single stanza of &quot;rime royal&quot; to prove that their
&gt;&gt; (unlettered) hero could have written it.

&gt; Dave, what is wrong with you? You even admitted yourself that some of
&gt; us did. I most certainly did. Not that one must write it at your

&gt;&gt; this thread (acceptable meaning ABOUT Shakespeare, not about me,

&gt;&gt; minimize the author's great achievement in *Rape of Lucrece* -- 265
&gt;&gt; STANZAS of rime royal on an important topic (the elimination of
&gt;&gt; tyrants and establishment of republic), dedicated to a young nobleman

My hard evidence is those two narrative poems. I'm saying it would be

work whose felicities transported Mr. Crowley into raptures -- indeed,
Mr. Crowley was confident that it was a genuine, hitherto undiscovered
poem by the Earl of Oxford, the greatest poet in English or any other
language. In fact, Mr. Crowley wrote of the sonnet:

&quot;Seriously -- is there anyone alive with that sort of talent,
experience, knowledge and understanding?&quot;

I'll grant you that writing a work that induces a tin-eared crank like
Crowley to salivate is not exactly the touchstone of poetic talent, but
nonetheless it is surely some indication that Jim's bona fides as a
versifier are not to be so casually dismissed.

challenge I offer is to write original *rime royal* about how William
(or Edward or Francis) wrote V&amp;A and/or Lucrece.

To me, the fact that no Stratfordian or Oxfrodian in this ng can
produce such verses tells me one of two things a) Strats aren't very
versatile poets (pace Grumman) or, b) Strats don't know much about
Shakespeare's narrative poetry (the works that &quot;made his name,&quot; so to
speak). (Ditto for the Deverites)

Note to Crowley: Why would Devere (as a pre-adolescent) write about an
event that lead to the establishing of a REPUBLIC when Q. Elizabeth
was a fairly new monarch?

Note to Brennen: this isn't about me, it's about writing poetry about
Shakespeare. If you don't like mine, write better.

Note to Farey: since you're so proficient in rime royal, why don't you
write your next Hoffman essay in that form. If you do I can almost
*guarantee* that you will win. If you do, and you do, you can thank me
later.

Note to Elizabeth: You're right: it's down to Marley and Bacon. I'm
ready whenever you are...in poetry or prose.

Note to Lorenzo: keep it up.

Note to Shakespeareans (of all persuasions)--

rime royalling is not to be despised
by anyone who loves the old bard's verse;
by foiling each other we'll get wise
despite a metric lapse, off-rime, or worse,
if all the evidence is set down first.
so here's a fact that can be tersely told:
a greyhound sign showed where *Lucrece* was sold.

As for your description of me at your on-line diary, it's seriously
flawed. My corrections are in brackets:

&quot;That's Brennen pictured above [in a stolen photo]. Before I found
this photo [and stole it], I imagined him to be 5'8&quot; [6'1&quot;] and
overweight. I'm not certain how tall he is. He edits a chess magazine
in Allentown [which is wrong]. Although he's a large man, in in
Shakespeare studies [what sane people would call a newsgroup, I call
&quot;Shakespeare studies&quot;] he's a lightweight, because he hasn't read
enough [compared to who?] ....and he would do well to follow the
example of his Stratfordian betters: David Webb, Peter Groves, Terry
Ross, David Kathman, [agreed; all of these posters are better-read in
Elizabethan Lit than I, and I have learned a great deal from their
posts. Notice they all know Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare.] and others
who know their stuff, but never resort to cheap shots, except for
maybe Kathman and Groves, and Webb occasionally. ;-)&quot;

Hi, Janice,

As I recall, Keats was (after Enfield School) first apprenticed to an
apothecary. Afterwards he attended Guys--because an act had been
passed which required him to. While at Guys, he became a &quot;dresser&quot;
(only a few students were chosen each year) and was then apprenticed
to a surgeon. When I said he studied &quot;privately&quot;, I meant he was the
only assistant. He was not part of a large group.

Best wishes,
Lynne

There was not the remotest thought in De Vere's
mind -- nor in the Queen's -- that a republic could
be established. AFAIK no one else in the country
seriously proposed it around this time -- in spite
of the monarchy's appalling record with the Wars
of the Roses, of Henry VIII and of Mary.

Don't you think that the aristocracy at the time
were capable of privately discussing classical
history and theories of politics? Also Lucrece
remained in manuscript for 30 years or so. As
a highly intelligent lad in an intensely politically
active and learned family -- with, apparently, a
wonderful future in the government of the
country, Oxford would have been expected to
ask every kind of conceivable question about
such matters -- and get honest answers from
his elders.

How do you think that the authorities of the day
came to allow the staging of 'Julius Caesar' and
many other plays which (under most theories)
discussed such political matters -- in front of the
common mobs.

Paul.

Hi Lynne,
you've shown some talent as a versifier. Will you contribute some rime
royal verses to this thread? I gather from other posts of yours that
you're a DeVerean, which poses an additional degree of difficulty, but
one stanza's all it takes to join the exclusive rime royal club (two
in Crowley's case, since he thinks a pre-adolescent child could have
written *Lucrece*, Shakespeare's graver labor).

Well, it is a fact that, for over 400 years, almost no-one has regarded
them as particularly important, either in terms of Shakespeare's career,
or in terms of the English canon -- Cousin Dickie's recent hilarious
nomination of V&amp;A as &quot;the greatest narrative poem of the age&quot;
notwithstanding. In neither does Shakespeare play to his strengths, and
&quot;Lucrece&quot; descends more than once into unmitigated bathos. Not until
&quot;The Tempest&quot; was he able to handle pure myth with assurance, and the
form cuts off his genius for creating verse dialog that is both good
dialog and good verse.

I've read 'em. But I'm not at all sure I want to do it again, except as
a scholarly exercise, and I've got two scholarly irons in the fire
already: collating the Dublin text of &quot;Double Falshood&quot; with the London
editions and preparing an errata sheet for the Graham edition of 1920,
as I already have for Muir's 1970 facsimile. (Moreover, I have to write
some Latin verses in the next week or so, and I've 40 years out of
practice at that.)

Actually none of them is headless (unless in line 2 you're proposing to
squeeze &quot;college&quot; into one syllable, which isn't really on); 1, 3 and 4 scan
nicely with initial reversals, and the last three are indeed unmetrical (if
you'd finished the book you'd know why).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oh gawd, are you stupid, neil, or what?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this isn't about SHAKESPEARE OR HIS CONTEMPORARIES... Get it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's mocking your stupidity in the formn of your stupidity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Neil. YOu still don't get it. Put up or shut up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm surprised you'd want to reprint without even bothering to improve.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It shows you are not only stupid, but lazy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Groves said it scanned. That's enough for me. Unlike you, I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make claims that this is poetry. Speaking of which, have you finished
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Groves' book? Started it yet? Or did you stop with scanning the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cover?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No. I didn't read it. Not many in this world will. If you read a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pages yourself, you'll know what I mean. It's a text book. Very dry.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; STill it's the best there is in the field. BUT Groves was wrong about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your verse and he admitted it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you show me this admission? Last I recall he was annoyed that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you were pouting because he refused to condense his book into a
&gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroup post.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (Snip greydoggiedogcrap (&quot;haven't read V and A&quot;, &quot;bad Rime Royal&quot;,

&gt;&gt;&gt; POTM King John.)

&gt;&gt; Groves agreed with JWKennedy.

&gt;&gt; You're right, I should read the POTM threads. Yours on Guy of Warwick
&gt;&gt; was intesting. Good job. I guess this isn't a rime royal crowd.

F for substance abuse.
In his dedication, Shakespeare tells his prospective patron
that he (Shakespeare) is untutored. It is not something you
tell a classmate. It matters not whether his Lucrece sources
were schooled or not.

Dave seems to be preoccupied with his ditties, and has
no regard for substance. The dedication is not written by
a university educated man, AND it is the only part that is signed.

Calling the poet a liar is no solution.

F for the fun of it.

&gt;&gt; Hi, Janice,

&gt;&gt; As I recall, Keats was (after Enfield School) first apprenticed to an
&gt;&gt; apothecary. Afterwards he attended Guys--because an act had been
&gt;&gt; passed which required him to. While at Guys, he became a &quot;dresser&quot;
&gt;&gt; (only a few students were chosen each year) and was then apprenticed
&gt;&gt; to a surgeon. When I said he studied &quot;privately&quot;, I meant he was the
&gt;&gt; only assistant. He was not part of a large group.

Still don't know the rules because the first post seems to harken back
to a previous thread. But in the meantime:

Though I to hlas late have come, I weep
For all I have endured these seven days,
To toss and turn and meanwhile lose all sleep
While entering a dozen bloody frays
Is not my way. I walk round in a daze,
And try to come to terms with such abuse:
To turn the other cheek seems not much use.

I'm often bid to piss off, go away,
Am called a fascist moron, wack times ten,
For on this list Stratfordians hold sway,
De Vereans may *whisper* now and then.
But I persist, return thrice, then again.
Though they think they'll insult me till I run,
I won't leave till the insults stop. What fun!

My gosh, Mark, what brought on that incredibly angry remark?

Note: I rarely get very angry, as I judge anger. I've almost never
been &quot;particularly angry&quot; at HLAS. I'm very susceptible to mild
annoyance, though, as now. Of course, you only have my word for this,

Don't take offense that I didn't finish reading your book. It's a
textbook and I'm really to busy to read it cover to cover. But I still
have it, if you will direct me to the pertinent section that will
explain why those lines aren't &quot;headless&quot; I'll read it a write a
report on it for the class.

I pointed out that they were unmetrical without reading your book. As
I tried to explain to Farey, you can hear an engine or lounge singer
humming smoothly, and appreciate the sound, and recognize a false
note, without knowing the mechanics. Your particular knowledge is
useful, though, and I appreciate your willingness to share it. For
instance, you can probably identify the many tropes and rhetorical
constructions found in V&amp;A and Lucrece, the &quot;first heirs&quot; of the
poet's invention. William must have learned these devices as a student
before he was 13 years old. Is that what you think? Or did he just
grok them?

Both the words are pronounced as two syllables. WILLyum and MYStree.

It is my understanding that Chaucer would not have been taught at
Stratford school, because Latin was emphasized. Is this wrong? What
does T.W. Baldwin say?
With a poet with a heightened sense of wordplay like Shakespeare's,
why wouldn't &quot;untutored&quot; suggest &quot;untudored,&quot; especially given the
theme of the poem: the demise of tyrants and establisment of
republican government. The name &quot;Tudor&quot; was a very familiar one to the
Elizabethans.

What other &quot;untruths&quot; are my verses comprised of, Dr. G?

Do you truly believe that the author of *Venus &amp; Adonis* and *Lucrece*

Twee, schmee: the point is that it's available. Scansion is a record not of
individual performances but of the potential of a given linguistic string
for being performed as a (in this case) pentameter. Shakespeare sometimes
forces a non-syncopated pronunciation for expressive purposes: comparing
milksop husband with dashing lover, Goneril utters the headless &quot;Oh, the
difference of man and man&quot;. To get a pentameter she has to linger
(salaciously) on trisyllabic &quot;difference&quot;, and the headlessness permits a
similar protraction of the &quot;Oh&quot;.

How was Republicanism an established trope?

In the Prologue to Lucrece, the author wrote:

acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state government
changed from kings to consuls.&quot;

I fear you misunderstood the gist of my comment. I wasn't wondering

You may recall that Terry's comment about your 'wrath' came after you
referred to Lynne's 'fascism' and called her a 'hyper-sensitive moron.'
Moreover, Terry was making an allusion to the Bible; I don't think he
intended his comment to be read as a literal diagnosis of your emotional
state.

For my own part, I never assumed that you were angry, just a poor judge
of character -- Lynne is not hypersensitive, fascist, or a moron.

You can take a single line from ANY POEM OR PLAY and say it ain't the

The fact that WS wrote a prequel to the Roman republican revolution,
is signficant since England had its own a few decades later. It wasn't
merely &quot;a trope,&quot; but a choice of subject matter made by the poet, who
could have chosen one of many other established tropes, no?

Very nice.

But if Stratfordians indeed &quot;hold sway,&quot; it is by virtue of the
strength of their arguments -- the group was founded (as I understand
it) by an Oxfordian, and a great many Oxfordians have held forth here
since then. Also, I wouldn't call what Mr. Crowley and Art are doing
&quot;whispering&quot;! Art alone accounts for nearly 10,000 posts -- not that
very many people read them any more.

However, I don't think that anyone wishes that you would just go

makes me ponder, now that Bob Grumman has left off, whether I and others

&gt;&gt; No particular wrath involved, Terry: it's possible to describe people

&gt; It's very difficult, though, I think, to describe people accurately,

I should have said that it's possible to describe an aspect of a
person accurately without being particularly angry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and a
&gt; refusal ever to be particularly angry seems to make it somewhat difficult to

Where does &quot;a refusal ever to be particularly angry&quot; come in? I
certainly don't refuse ever to be particularly angry (nor could I), so
not infrequently am, especially when I bungle an easy shot in tennis,
or read about some politician's desire to take another freedom from
us.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But being particularly angry in the way needed to describe people
&gt; accurately doesn't usually lead to using insulting undefined terms,

"/>

You're losing me, I fear, Janice. None of the terms I used in my days
of villainy were undefined, although most of them were very general in
meaning.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; except
&gt; among writers, or speakers, who think it's necessary to be really
&gt; particularly angry in order to describe people accurately, and who then
&gt; project &quot;particularly angry&quot; onto every adjective they use.

"/>

This has nothing to do with what you're saying, which I don't exactly
follow, but my experience is that insulted people tend to assume great
anger is behind every negative word aimed at them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Turning them back into superficially neutral terms doesn't really change
&gt; their nature, does it? They weren't accurate to begin with, because they
&gt; had the negative connotations, added because there was felt to be emotion
&gt; involved, injected into them. Turning them into clinical, and thus
&gt; superficially neutral, terms, which still have negative connotations that
&gt; are only there because the observer has, inaccurately, been perceived as
&gt; biased, leaves the description inaccurate.

&gt; On the other hand, if you had used a neutral procedure to arrive at terms
&gt; that were, thus, also neutral (or alternatively, probably, were using the
&gt; terms in a way that was as consistent as possible with what would be
&gt; produced by a neutral procedure), one could only accuse you of poor judgment
&gt; in using insulting terms you ought to have known would be insulting, in a
&gt; forum where, obviously, you hadn't been called upon to give a neutral
&gt; judgment.

&gt; It's especially very difficult, I think, to describe people accurately
&gt; through the smoke created by all that inaccurate perception of perceivers,
&gt; and projection of imagined negative emotions.

I think it's pretty easy to desribe people's rationality (most of the

&gt; you ever run into him.

I've never owed a woman money, but have had women owe me money (which
amused me because I've never been involved with a woman who didn't
make quite a bit more money than I did). I think if your ex-boyfriend

&gt; Very nice.

&gt; But if Stratfordians indeed &quot;hold sway,&quot; it is by virtue of the
&gt; strength of their arguments -- the group was founded (as I understand
&gt; it) by an Oxfordian, and a great many Oxfordians have held forth here
&gt; since then. Also, I wouldn't call what Mr. Crowley and Art are doing
&gt;&quot;whispering&quot;! Art alone accounts for nearly 10,000 posts -- not that
&gt; very many people read them any more.

It was a poetic turn of phrase.

Thank you, David. That is such a kind thing to say. I won't be on much
over the next two weeks, as I'm travelling, but I'll try to pop in
every now and then and will come back in a fortnight. In the meantime,
no one should feel an obligation to insult me. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He even pretended to read Dr. Grove's book on verse...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oh gawd, are you stupid, neil, or what?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this isn't about SHAKESPEARE OR HIS CONTEMPORARIES... Get it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's mocking your stupidity in the formn of your stupidity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Neil. YOu still don't get it. Put up or shut up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm surprised you'd want to reprint without even bothering to improve.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It shows you are not only stupid, but lazy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Groves said it scanned. That's enough for me. Unlike you, I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make claims that this is poetry. Speaking of which, have you finished
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Groves' book? Started it yet? Or did you stop with scanning the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cover?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No. I didn't read it. Not many in this world will. If you read a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pages yourself, you'll know what I mean. It's a text book. Very dry.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; STill it's the best there is in the field. BUT Groves was wrong about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your verse and he admitted it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you show me this admission? Last I recall he was annoyed that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you were pouting because he refused to condense his book into a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroup post.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Snip greydoggiedogcrap (&quot;haven't read V and A&quot;, &quot;bad Rime Royal&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;contributes nothing&quot;, etc) from someone who has yet to post on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; POTM King John.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Groves agreed with JWKennedy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're right, I should read the POTM threads. Yours on Guy of Warwick
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was intesting. Good job. I guess this isn't a rime royal crowd.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In another thread, Greg Reynolds weighs in with:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mystery solv'd, as far as that's concerned,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dave reminding us which college taught Kit:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cambridge is where his poetry was learned...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will had no schooling, come to think of it,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proving then Lucrece is something Will writ!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Authorship questions are thereby neutered:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (The poet said his lines were &quot;untutored.&quot;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nice job, Greg!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A for rime scheme
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A for argument
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; C for meter (everyone but the last is 'headless', last three lines not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iambic -- just passing on what i was taught by my betters)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wha? That was gangsta rap.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You're the one reposting it here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the poet claimed &quot;untutored lines,&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The story came from older language sources:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; William wouldn't recognize those signs,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since Chaucer wasn't one his resources,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He was too busy tending theater horses.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The poet plainly lied unless he meant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; UnTudored, and republic government.

&gt;&gt;&gt; F for substance abuse.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In his dedication, Shakespeare tells his prospective patron
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he (Shakespeare) is untutored. It is not something you
&gt;&gt;&gt; tell a classmate. It matters not whether his Lucrece sources
&gt;&gt;&gt; were schooled or not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; F for deportment.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dave seems to be preoccupied with his ditties, and has
&gt;&gt;&gt; no regard for substance. The dedication is not written by
&gt;&gt;&gt; a university educated man, AND it is the only part that is signed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; F for problem solving.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Calling the poet a liar is no solution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; F for the fun of it.

&gt;&gt; Yo Greg, is that a way to treat a brother?
&gt;&gt; My facts are straight: the part about old Chaucer--
&gt;&gt; Would Willyum bother reading that old author,
&gt;&gt; Or other sources? When? Don't duck, or toss
&gt;&gt; or whack the question back. A flying saucer
&gt;&gt; Likelier would 'light on th' Avon river
&gt;&gt; Than Willyum reading Middle English ever.

&gt; F for feminine, as in endings. :)

&gt; Lynne, who wrote a pretty fine rime royal (even if she says so herself
&gt; and even if it might have been on the wrong topic), in fact two, which
&gt; everyone has ignored.

"/>

Ha, Lynne. You're right! There are nearly enough feminine endings in
those verses for a line of Rockettes. And the rime scheme isn't
perfect either. It's a good thing I got the facts straight. Sorry I
didn't notice your rime royal verses. Were they posted in this thread?
I see that Peter Farey has reposted them. Nice job. Only a handful of
posters have managed an entire flawless stanza of rime royal. You're
one of that select group.

You will notice that Lynne says nothing whatever about your

is right or wrong where you are concerned, it is a perfectly
legitimate point, and is not the slightest bit &quot;insulting&quot; to
you, unless to try to show how someone may be wrong is to
insult them.

As for my being an &quot;insulter who avoids calling people names&quot;,
I do not recognize this as a description of what I do either.
My own self-image is of one who tries to *respond* to argument
in a way that matches the tone of what has been thrown at me
by someone, whilst not finding it necessary either to insult
them *or* call them names.

In some cases this approach may indeed make the recipient
feel a bit stupid (as I guess you know), but that is not a
view of them that I would usually share, let alone say about
them myself.

&gt;&gt; you've shown some talent as a versifier. Will you contribute some rime
&gt;&gt; royal verses to this thread? I gather from other posts of yours that
&gt;&gt; you're a DeVerean, which poses an additional degree of difficulty, but
&gt;&gt; one stanza's all it takes to join the exclusive rime royal club (two
&gt;&gt; in Crowley's case, since he thinks a pre-adolescent child could have

You got it Lynne. Sorry I didn't see them. Busy time for me in the
&quot;real world&quot; lately. The &quot;rules&quot; so far as I can tell are:

1. write about Shakespeare and/or his contemporaries (especially on
authorship matters) in rime royal (predominantly iambic pentameter
with rhyme scheme ababbcc, which should be exact.)

that's the concept, though some non-participants have quibbled about
rules.

Write when the spearit moves you.

My main grievance with you is not that you call me, or make me feel,
stupid but that you describe me as close-minded. You consider this an
accurate description--but I consider &quot;excessively irrational&quot; an
accurate description of the people I (formerly) insulted with names
which are merely short-cut ways of describing people as excessively
irrational.

You have just described me, also, as having committed a contemptible
act. That, too, seems insulting to me. No matter, as insults don't
bother me (and I
Think I was justified in popping off at a stated belief that people
whose ideas bother someone should not be allowed to state those
ideas).

I think name-calling has great value. It's a form of honesty. I
think (to insult you worse, I suspect, than by calling you some name
having to do with irrationality) refusal to call people names is a
form of hypocrisy. That in turn is due to inhibitedness, or fear of
letting people see you as your are.

There is a lot more to the subject than that. Someday, I hope to sort
it all out and discuss it in an essay on the value of anger.

uncontemptibly yours this time, I hope, Bob G.

I'm sure they don't hate you, Bob. They may just not have thought you
as funny as you thought you were. In any case, you can't expect to
name call and name call (me) without getting a small sting in return.
I am so glad you've stopped. It means I can stop too.

But I will relate a story. My daughter was called dumb all through
school, by other students and occasionally teachers. When we got her
at 17 months she was supposed to be microcephalic (sp?) and extremely
mentally handicapped. This was not the case. She'd just been
neglected, had been through 10 foster homes in her short life. Her
head size came up from the second to the fiftieth percentile in the
initial six months after we adopted her. She has, in fact, an IQ in
the high nineties though she also has some serious emotional problems
left over from her early life and a learning disability. Due to her
own efforts she has gone all the way through school and qualified as a
veterinary receptionist. She has now held a full-time job in her field
down for over two years. She was never amused when anyone called her
dumb, even in fun, but forgave them immediately by saying they didn't
know any better.

When you name call or insult people, you usually know little about
them. You have no idea what they've suffered, what their lives are
like, what obstacles they've overcome. I've overcome quite a few
myself in the last year so I'm somewhat sensitive to potential misery
or hardship in the lives of others. That's why I prefer not deride or
abuse anyone. But of course, I will sting back, rather mildly, if
stung. In this case it was either do that or run, and anyone who knows
me well will tell you it's not usually my practice to turn tail.

It didn't, really. It had a Presbyterian/Puritan revolution that

country in triumph without anyone at all having done anything in particular.

The intellectual underpinnings of the American Revolution and all that
followed it came after, not before, the English Civil War, and when the

I wish your daughter well but would rate her hyper-sensitive. If it's
true that no one ever amused her by teasing her. While I hate trying
to defend myself, expecially against a charge of being unnice, I
should say that I probably would never have teased your daughter. I
don't call all my exceptional students dumb, just those who seem to me
able to take it, in appropriate circumstances.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When you name call or insult people, you usually know little about them.
&gt; You have no idea what they've suffered, what their lives are
&gt; like, what obstacles they've overcome. I've overcome quite a few
&gt; myself in the last year so I'm somewhat sensitive to potential misery
&gt; or hardship in the lives of others. That's why I prefer not deride or
&gt; abuse anyone. But of course, I will sting back, rather mildly,

&gt; me well will tell you it's not usually my practice to turn tail.

I think people who are hyper-sensitive about words ought not to
participate in forums like HLAS. I think it's up to them to avoid
people like me, not up to me to muzzle myself for their benefit.
There are other forums, such as yours, where they can go and avoid
trauma. In any case, I doubt seriously that I've assaulted anyone who
didn't assault me first--although probably unknowingly in some
cases--by, for example, automatically assuming, and indicating by his
tone, that he knew a lot more than I and all the scholars who believe
Shakespeare was Shakespeare.

But Pax with you is fine by me--since I, too, greatly admire Autolycus
as a comic character (though outdone by Falstaff because Falstaff got
around more; and by Launce, for one one scene).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would expect Peter to be especially sympathetic to a fellow insulter
&gt;&gt;&gt; who avoids calling people names, LynnE. How do you and he rate your
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting description of my exceptional students as hating me?
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Don't worry, I was not offended, but I like to point out hypocrisy.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; --Bob G.

&gt;&gt; I'm sure they don't hate you, Bob. They may just not have thought you
&gt;&gt; as funny as you thought you were. In any case, you can't expect to
&gt;&gt; name call and name call (me) without getting a small sting in return.
&gt;&gt; I am so glad you've stopped. It means I can stop too.

&gt;&gt; But I will relate a story. My daughter was called dumb all through
&gt;&gt; school, by other students and occasionally teachers. When we got her
&gt;&gt; at 17 months she was supposed to be microcephalic (sp?) and extremely
&gt;&gt; mentally handicapped. This was not the case. She'd just been
&gt;&gt; neglected, had been through 10 foster homes in her short life. Her
&gt;&gt; head size came up from the second to the fiftieth percentile in the
&gt;&gt; initial six months after we adopted her. She has, in fact, an IQ in
&gt;&gt; the high nineties though she also has some serious emotional problems
&gt;&gt; left over from her early life and a learning disability. Due to her
&gt;&gt; own efforts she has gone all the way through school and qualified as a
&gt;&gt; veterinary receptionist. She has now held a full-time job in her field
&gt;&gt; down for over two years. She was never amused when anyone called her
&gt;&gt; dumb, even in fun, but forgave them immediately by saying they didn't
&gt;&gt; know any better.

&gt; If someone walked into her office and started questioning, aloud, whether
&gt;&quot;people like her&quot; had a right to be there, or if a new technician started
&gt; who asked the same thing, she might, I'd think, react differently? If you,
&gt; as her mother, knew there was a law being considered to make it impossible
&gt; for her to work anymore, by instituting an IQ minimum or a college-diploma
&gt; requirement, and you came across people discussing arguments that had a
&gt; bearing on that requirement or on that law, you probably wouldn't (whether
&gt; you spoke up or not) think nothing of it, I'd suppose? If your daughter had
&gt; a rival for a promotion, and you happened upon people telling lies about
&gt; your daughter and assigning her own actual on-the-job accomplishments to her
&gt; rival, I'd have to think, you wouldn't just shrug that off (again, whether
&gt; you spoke up about it or not)? If you offered your opinion, going back to
&gt; that proposed law, and had someone like one of the more &quot;perky&quot; participants
&gt; here on hlas, throw at you a point-by-point Q&amp;A designed to get you to
&gt; concede that you couldn't, as a matter of principle, oppose the law change,
&gt; and that in fact your daughter oughtn't have rights that were more justly
&gt; assigned to someone smarter, for no other reason than that the other were
&gt; smarter? If you've been lucky enough not to have to consider these
&gt; possibilities, great.

&gt; My tendency, generally, has been to do, in those situations, what you say
&gt; your daughter does: when people say women ought not be able to do certain
&gt; things, for instance, to shrug it off. It's been my _experience_ (so far)
&gt; that in this instance, there's really no way anyone's going to be able to
&gt; turn back the clock, and I'm on the right side (which also happens to be the
&gt;&quot;winning&quot; side), so I can be the gracious one. I'm _beginning_ to be
&gt; annoyed by a kind of &quot;absolutizing&quot; argument, which says, &quot;always turn the
&gt; other cheek&quot; and which takes two similar situations to be identical.

&gt; Or...

&gt; If someone said to you, &quot;All these people would lose their jobs if they
&gt; admitted someone like your daughter ought to be able to work in their field
&gt; -- you need to take them into account before you offer _your_ opinion&quot;?

&gt; If you happened upon people using arguments such as, &quot;I know for a fact that
&gt; her IQ is less than 100, and in general people with under-100 IQ's are
&gt; unable to complete training programs, and I know for a fact that in this
&gt; particular field a training program is required&quot;?

"/>

I'm sorry, Janice, but I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.
But I would like to say that I've fought for all three of my children
all the way down the line: to make sure they got a decent education,
to make sure they had access to training programs, to get them
psychological help when they needed it.

Not sure whether this will please or disgust you, but have never
turned the other cheek where my kids are concerned.

Lynne

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Janice, but I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.
&gt;&gt; But I would like to say that I've fought for all three of my children
&gt;&gt; all the way down the line: to make sure they got a decent education,
&gt;&gt; to make sure they had access to training programs, to get them
&gt;&gt; psychological help when they needed it.

&gt; Lynne, as the thread was a discussion of inappropriate behavior here on
&gt; hlas, I understood you to be offering a general statement, to be applied by
&gt; or with reference to other people, in other words, suggesting that they
&gt; might want to behave (perhaps including in this forum) in the same way your
&gt; daughter did, and for the same reasons. I'm not sure what reading-in you
&gt; would have to do, or what kind of discussion you think this is, that would
&gt; permit you to start looking for some &quot;point&quot; I might be trying to make -- as
&gt; if I had some hard-to-discover ulterior motive, rather than being engaged in
&gt; a conversation the same as anyone else might be.

&gt;&gt; Not sure whether this will please or disgust you, but have never
&gt;&gt; turned the other cheek where my kids are concerned.

&gt; Nor am I sure why you think I would expect to be pleased _or_ disgusted by
&gt; anything you would say, regarding your children or your raising of them. It
&gt; bothers me a bit that you think I'm emotionally invested in this discussion
&gt; in the _kind_ of way that would suggest I am going to &quot;be pleased or
&gt; disgusted&quot; with what you say about yourself and your own life, much less
&gt; with the idea of your being a good mother.

&gt; It seemed to me, Lynne, that you were saying something like, &quot;Some people
&gt; are just not going to succeed in the way most people succeed, and the people
&gt; who are best-adjusted and most ethical simply accept this and plow ahead
&gt; with their limited abilities, without complaining and without expecting
&gt; other people to accept them.&quot; You were also, I think, defending your own
&gt;&quot;mildness.&quot; In context, here, I think it sounds a lot like -- you'll let me
&gt; know if I'm wrong -- you're advising people not to get upset when they reach
&gt; their limits and are told so, and telling other people not to worry about
&gt; using derogatory terms that happen to be &quot;objective&quot; (because there's no
&gt; real downside to them).

"/>

No, absolutely not. Bob had been talking about calling exceptional
students dumb, and I was trying to show that I had personal experience
of how unfunny that might be. My daughter turned the other cheek with
authority because there was simply nothing else she could do in the
circumstances. We were not so mild. In addition, I think it's very
presumptuous for some people to tell others what their limits are,
unless a teacher is telling someone who's mentally handicapped or of
low normal intelligence with severe learning disabilities that s/he
can be anything he wants to be--my daughter also encountered this and
couldn't understand why she couldn't qualify as a vet--and I was
absolutely arguing against people using derogatory terms (even in fun)
to describe others. I was in fact, trying to show Bob how hurtful it
was, but it's all water under the bridge now.

I didn't expect you to be emotionally invested in the conversation,
nor did I think you had an ulterior motive. I don't generally ascribe
negative characteristics to people I don't know at all (though I
suppose I do usually have an expectation that people engaging in
conversation here or anywhere will have some kind of point to make).I
just didn't understand how your remarks fitted in with what had
previously transpired in the discussion. Now I do. I think.

Best wishes,
Lynne
