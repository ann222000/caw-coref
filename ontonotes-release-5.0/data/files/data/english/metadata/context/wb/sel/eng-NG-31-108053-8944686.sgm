Hi;
I am working on a Taito Arkanoid Tournament and had to replace the
entire wiring harness. Using the manual,  I fabricated the wiring
harness to the P/S and the edge connector back up to the C/P. I
haven't hooked up the speaker yet because I don't know what resistance
pot I should place in circuit, anybody know?
There is 3 wires, (red, black and white) attached to a connector
hanging off the PCB, does anyone know what this is for?
Another question I have, does the ground from the spinner go to the P/
S or the PCB ground?
I cannot find a schem' for this game and was wondering if someone had
a copy in PDF?
Thanks
Jeff

I traced an old wiring harness and found that the GND from the spinner
terminates to the PCB not the P/S - thats one down.

I still need info on the 3 wire connector hanging from the PCB - any
ideas????

The board has its own volume pot... you just wire up an 8 Ohm speaker
directly to the edge connector.
It doesn't matter where you ground your spinner... GND should be GND
(if you've hooked your PS up correctly).  Unless you're confusing the
FG on the supply with GND....
There is no publicly available Arkanoid PCB schematic.
As for the 3-wire thingy, you'll have to post a pic.

I checked the board and the manual and did not see a volume control
pot, but then again, I've missed bigger things than that. I'll go back
and look again.
As for the wire thing, I'll take some pic's tonight and post them.
Thanks for the reply,

I thought about the ground issue and your right, I was trying to find
out why the spinner did not work and was going through all possible
ideas. It seems that the machine I had bought had a bootleg PCB
installed and I never checked the pin out on the spinner.
Anyway, I could not find a volume pot on the board, I checked a couple
of times.
I have a link below of pictures of the wire coming off the PCB.
Thanks again.

Hi Jeff,

the three wires that are soldered to your board represents the site where a
trimmer potentiometer for sound volume should be.  Perhaps the previous
owner wanted a remote potentiometer for his game; you see this in pinball
games.  The sound pot is usually NOT on the sound board/main board for a
pinball game, it is remotely located...

I will try to measure that pot's resistance on one of my Arkanoid boards
when I get home from work...have to go now.

Regards,
Dan

Looks like you found where the volume pot goes!
I believe VR1 is a 1K pot (I don't have access to board at the moment
to verify... Dan will probably beat me to it).

BTW, I can tell from the EPROM labels that you have the upright
version of Tournament Arkanoid.  Hopefully you're not planning on
using it in a cocktail....

Thanks for the heads up.
Now I have another dilemma.
I bought this game non-working. I took out the wiring harness (hacked
to death), PCB - which is what I think is a bootleg, pics below:

http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z269/jeffiejames/Unknown2.jpg
http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z269/jeffiejames/Unknown1.jpg

and proceeded to fabricate and install a wiring harness, switcher and
Tournament Arkanoid PCB. After I fired it up, the game comes up but
the spinner did not move the vaus. I checked the c/p and found that
the wiring on the spinner was not the same as the manual stated, (the
GND and left were reversed- the right and the +5v were in the correct
positions).
I pulled the spinner and checked the optics board. The printing on the
pcb shows the left and right outputs opposite of what the manual
states but the 5v and GND are in the same positions as the manual
shows.
The manual also shows 4 X 150 ohm resistors in the circuit but the
optics pcb I have has 2 X 150 ohm resistors, (in the +5vdc side) and 2
X 2.2k ohm resistors (in the GND side).
Would you happen to know if this a typo in the manual or is this
spinner to be used with the other bootleg PCB and now a &quot;legit&quot; PCB?
What do you think?
Thanks again

What's funny is that when I powered it up the display was upside down
and I was thinking that I had to disassemble the monitor chassis and
turn the tube 180 Deg. I finally got a manual and just had to flip a
dip switch.
By any chance, do you know who makes the bootleg PCB I have, I need to
get a copy of the pinouts / p/s plug.

Jeff,

I wouldn't worry too much about the optic board.  I have seen both
types..  You could maybe post a picture of the optics board (and
spinner).  The normal pinout has +5 at pin 2 and gnd at pin 3.  You
can determine yourself which two are the signal lines by looking at
the opto-interrupters on the board (or I can do it for you if you post
a pic).

Arkanoid has to be the most copied board... I've seen dozens of different bootlegs.
The pinouts for the bootlegs are all pretty much the same as the original Taito though.  Most have additional power lines
(5V,12V,GND) routed to the edge connector (so you don't need to use the extra power connector, which is completely missing on some
bootlegs).  They often cheap-out on the power connector (like on your bootleg) and not use the full complement of pins, but the
ordering is still the same, so you can still use the Taito power harness if you carefully figure out how to offset it.
It's possible to make one harness that runs original and bootleg boards.  The edge connector pins that the bootlegs use for power
are not used by the Taito board, so it is safe to apply power to them.

Hi;
I took out the DMM and gave it a shot.......
I changed the wiring on the connector going to the optics PCB and
plugged it in and.................
I have a working Arkanoid, except for the sound. If you know what
resistance the pot should be, please let me know and I'll go from
there.
Thanks for the boost.

Hi Jeff,

congratulations on your successes; you are not far from enjoying Arkanoid!
:-)

I have two different Arkanoid boards I just tested the pots on.  The results
were strange; probably an electrical thing Matt may be able to explain.  I
think his guess of 1000 ohms is a good one.

When I tested the pots, here is what I found.  They are both about 3/4 of a
turn.  At one end I measured 1-2 ohms. and at the other end I measured
750-800 ohms.  However, in about the middle of the turn (3/8 of a turn)  the
resistance went up to 1500 ohms.  Maybe those findings have something to do
with the fact the pot is still soldered into the circuit.  Whatever the
explanation, these boards have fine sound in my games (I have two), and I
don't think you could go wrong with a 1000 or 1500 ohm pot.

Regards,
Dan

&gt;&gt; &gt; I wouldn't worry too much about the optic board.  I have seen both
&gt;&gt; &gt; types..  You could maybe post a picture of the optics board (and
&gt;&gt; &gt; spinner).  The normal pinout has +5 at pin 2 and gnd at pin 3.  You
&gt;&gt; &gt; can determine yourself which two are the signal lines by looking at
&gt;&gt; &gt; the opto-interrupters on the board (or I can do it for you if you post
&gt;&gt; &gt; a pic).

&gt;&gt; Of course, the non-moving vaus is also a possible symptom of a bad
&gt;&gt; optic board... you can check the outputs in circuit and see how they
&gt;&gt; look.

&gt; Hi;
&gt; I took out the DMM and gave it a shot.......
&gt; I changed the wiring on the connector going to the optics PCB and
&gt; plugged it in and.................
&gt; I have a working Arkanoid, except for the sound. If you know what
&gt; resistance the pot should be, please let me know and I'll go from
&gt; there.
&gt; Thanks for the boost.

Interesting.  I measured one I had handy and found similar results.  I
get about 700 ohms at one end and about 1.5K ohms at the other.

Yeah, somewhere around 1-2K is probably fine.

&gt; Hi Jeff,

&gt; congratulations on your successes; you are not far from enjoying Arkanoid!

&gt; I have two different Arkanoid boards I just tested the pots on.  The results
&gt; were strange; probably an electrical thing Matt may be able to explain.  I
&gt; think his guess of 1000 ohms is a good one.

Thanks for everyones' help.
I have sent a request to one more person who might be able to get me
an exact spec, if I do I'll post the resistance if not, I'll get the
2K pot and see what happens.
I'll post either way.
Thanks again
Jeff
