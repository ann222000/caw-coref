Study: Drivers on Cells Clogging Traffic
New Study: When Other Drivers Use Cell Phones, They Slow Down and You Sit
More in Traffic
http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=4078804

Excerpts:
...
Motorists yakking away, even with handsfree devices, crawl about 2 mph
slower on commuter-clogged roads than people not on the phone, and they just
don't keep up with the flow of traffic, said study author David Strayer, a
psychology professor at the University of Utah.
...
&quot;The distracted driver tends to drive slower and have delayed reactions,&quot;
said Strayer, whose study will be presented later this month to the
Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences. &quot;People
kind of get stuck behind that person and it makes everyone pay the price of
that distracted driver.&quot;
...
Overall, cell phone drivers took about 3 percent longer to drive the same
highly traffic-clogged route (and about 2 percent longer to drive a medium
congested route) than people who were not on the phone. About one in 10
drivers is on the phone so it really adds up, said Strayer, whose earlier
studies have found slower reaction times from drivers on the phones and
compared those reaction times to people legally drunk.

The problem is that in LA one can't drive 2-3% slower, they'd be going
backward.

Of course I believe people drive slower while on the cell phone. I know when
I do it... I tend to pick a speed and choose a lane, and within reason, stay
there. If someone is in front of me, I stay about 1 second behind them at
the speed they are travelling. Just another dot on the traffic map.

I roll my eyes, because the numbers cited are ridiculously small for the
hype. And the conclusion seems overblown, too.

A 3 percent reduction in speed does not equal &quot;clogging traffic&quot;. They list
results of the 9.2 miles simulated driving taking up to 19 seconds longer
when the drivers were on a cell phone. I dunno, but a few seconds saved by
not talking on a cellphone doesn't seem like a big deal to me.

Also, the article quotes one simulation was performed in &quot;congested
traffic&quot;. Congested traffic in LA can mean a 20-30 minute trip to go 10
miles. Those 19 seconds saved by more frequent lane changes around slower
cars becomes even less important.

(It's still not clear to me what speed they were going, or how long the 9.2
mile trip took overall. 3 percent would mean about a 10 minute trip, which
is around 60 mph. In other words, not congested. So who knows until the
study actually comes out.)

So yeah, I roll my eyes because 1 minute extra on a 30 mile commute is no
big deal. Especially when I'm staying connected on the trip.

its a load of old bollocks, distraction causes the problems, its just the constant paranoia and hatred of cell phone users thats the popular thing at the moment. Its easy to sway peoples views with sensational emotional statements such as this, any distraction during driving is bad, cellphones, radios, nav systems, video, kids, but we don't see anyone banning all of the above. I'd like to see a similar study of a soccer mom with jacked up kids in the back of car, or a couple arguing about directions. How many stories have you heard about nav systems making people drive off cliffs. Applying makeup, reading papers, cigarettes, chatting away.

Being drunk gives you less awareness, inhibitions, as well as self preservation skills, talking on a cell phone, makes you less aware.

40% of the 42,000 accidents in the USA are alcohol related.

Read the report from the university, its full of words like 'similar', 'maybes' etc, they even admit they tested the drunk drivers at the best time for them, not at the time where most drunk drivers get into accidents, ie during the fatigued periods.

its a good idea to ban cell phones during driving, but cop a dose of reality in there as well and don't just lap up the constant propoganda that allows them to be senstionalist about important things.

It'd be a lot more of an improvement if the driving tests were improved, education is the key to better road conditions, as well as better roads and less congestions, so better public transport, not just cheap politically friendly small university studies that grab the attention of the masses and make them forget about the real issues.

In a place like LA where the distances are large and traffic is bad, it
should be a ticketable offense to slow down traffic over something as
being on a damn phone.

I do 80 every chance I get and even when I'm on BT I find myself driving
more slowly when on the phone. I hate the damn things. Find someone with
40 carlengths between them and forward traffic, moving under the prevailing
limit (which is what really matters) and changing lanes in times measured
with a calendar and I'll almost guarantee they're on the damn phone.

In LA, I do 20mph every chance I get.  Sometimes if I take the freeway at
night, I can use 3, 4 &amp; 5th gear! I dream of 50 !  I clean the carbon out
on the I5 between Grapevine and SanFran.  And, I use a phone, and
sometimes,
the conversation is    sporadic as I ignore
the   phone and   drive the car. Too bad for the other person on the
phone. Driving gets my full attention. It's no less that having the radio
on, people talking, brass band in the trunk. I just set my priorities to
drive, and everything else is 2nd.  It's the jerks who cannot prioritize,
and think they can do it all, that botch it for the rest of us.

...and tell the conversation to pipe down, or hit the &quot;Brass Band Eject&quot;
button on the dash.

We are in control of our own fates, and while the &quot;final solution&quot; is always
waiting to take us, we can also hush up and pay attention rather than die.

It's the &quot;other guy&quot; we need to have laws against!  (sigh, I hate more laws)

The best solution is better training. If people can not pass the drivers
training course, then they don't get to drive.

The thing about this report that I got, was how cellphone users were less
aggressive. Changing lanes around slower cars 20% less often. That is,
there's a slow car or truck in front of them, and they just followed that
car. I don't recall it saying that cellphone users drove slower (i.e. 63 mph
instead of 65.) Just that they didn't go around obstacles as often.

Skipping the cellphone factor, one could reinterpret that report to mean
passive drivers get to work 1 minute later.

By the way, I also take exception to the story's claim that cellphone use
adds 20 hours more to a commute per year. Which just doesn't add up at 19
seconds per ~10 minutes of driving. You would have to be commuting 2 hours a
day, 280 days per year to rack up 20 hours extra. Seems like your cellphone
would be a godsend if that much of your day is spent going to and from work.

The numbers are all over the place. We won't even know what the hype is
based on until it's published. And, like the drunk driving report, it will
already have taken hold in the public consciousness before actual results
are available.

I take it you have a short commute?  2 hours a day is not unreasonable -- that's only an hour each way -- but 280 days is a little high (5 work days X 50 work weeks [i.e., two weeks vacation/year] is only 250 days, but throw in a random accident every week and that will account for the remaining 30 days pretty quickly

take my tidbits w a grain of sale please.

regarding the adds 20 hrs of commute per year, doesn't add up.

the way it was explained by Cal-Trans

it's the domino effect:

if driving on the free way, one person hits their brakes, this adds 15
minutes to everyone behind him/her bc every car now has to brake and/or
space out, (allow space in front of them)

so same thing w cell phones, the slow driver, cause same domino effect

e.g. another example, I've always thought Cal-Trans should post signs near
hill upward climbs saying &quot;use cruise control uphill&quot;, or &quot;maintain same
speed up hill&quot;.
I travel the 60 Fwy, and it always slows, and backs up for the hills at
Montebello, (between Paramount &amp; Wilcox) &amp; and again at Puente Hills , (at
605 &amp; Turnbull Cyn), and on 605 at Rose Hills, at Beverly Blvd.
People slow down going up hill, instead of maintaing the same speed, and
hence the same domino effect.

as for me, I pull off the freeway when I have to take a call, or let it go
to VM

and when I see a driver on the cell, I give them a good blast of my horn as
I'm passing them (my way of saying get off the phone and drive)

Oh that really helps. By blasting your horn you simply increase the
amount they are distracted. Best to just let them be and stay out of
there way. If you add additional distraction you increase the chance of
an accident.

Which is exactly my point. The study showed that students driving 9.2 miles
resulted in 19 seconds longer drive-time when on the cellphone in congested
traffic.

Then somehow, that got extrapolated to a soundbite something like, &quot;cell
phone users cause 20 hours extra drivetime per year.&quot;

It just doesn't add up, unless your commute is loooong and has a lot of
congeeeestttion and you drive more days than a typical workweek worker.

And, by the way, my commute varies. Sometimes it's driving 2 hours each way,
other times it's mere seconds walking to my desk.

&gt; By the way, I also take exception to the story's claim that cellphone
&gt;  use
&gt; adds 20 hours more to a commute per year. Which just doesn't add up at
&gt;  19
&gt; seconds per ~10 minutes of driving. You would have to be commuting 2
&gt;  hours a
&gt; day, 280 days per year to rack up 20 hours extra. Seems like your
&gt;  cellphone
&gt; would be a godsend if that much of your day is spent going to and from
&gt;  work.
&gt; ==========

&gt; I take it you have a short commute?  2 hours a day is not
&gt; unreasonable -- that's only an hour each way -- but 280 days
&gt; is a little high (5 work days X 50 work weeks [i.e., two
&gt; weeks vacation/year] is only 250 days, but throw in a random
&gt; accident every week and that will account for the remaining
&gt; 30 days pretty quickly

Morale:

As often as you can, ride a motorcycle.

Corollary:

Don't use the phone on the motorcycle, or you won't pass as often . . . for
lane splitters that could be a very time-consuming choice.

You may be sure of that, and it's easy to leap to that conclusion. Of course
traffic delays propogate. I've heard CHP say for every 1 minute of delay it
takes 5 minutes to clear up. But that's not what the report was stating. The
report (as much as we've seen) said that cellphone talkers don't change
lanes, causing longer commutes.

Then the stories jumped to the conclusion that cellphones clog traffic. But
it's the driver in front: the old guy, the truck, the Prius, or Nissan
Pulsar NX loping along in front of Mr. Aggressive-But-Not-Paying-Attention
college student who normally zooms around those slowpokes but since he's on
the phone, he skips that manuever 20% of the time.

There's a lot of animosity towards cellphone users everywhere. But let's not
make them the scapegoat for our traffic problems.

============

This is a no-win argument -- years ago my commute took me along the 10 from El Monte through &quot;downtown&quot; -- for those not familiar with that stretch, the on and off ramps had a &quot;common section&quot;, so you could drive &quot;around&quot; traffic by taking an offramp and not-actually-exit and re-enter a good 1/4 mile or more &quot;ahead&quot; of where you were &quot;stopped&quot;.    Of course, you had to merge with two sources of oncoming traffic (one for each direction of traffic on the surface street you were crossing with that ramp), then merge with traffic actually on the freeway.  All this &quot;merging&quot; caused such a tremendous slowdown that when all was said and done, you might have gained one or two car-lengths against anyone who stayed on the freeway in the right-most lane  (or, as I often got to chuckle over, you'd actually lose ground...)

As to your point about the &quot;normally-aggressive, but on the phone&quot; drivers not actually changing lanes, this is a good thing -- it's those &quot;sudden lane changes&quot; that cause the overly cautious driver that they have cut off to slam on their brakes and start a chain reaction [at the time I drove a stick shift, and most of the time when I saw this happening I would simply downshift and let the engine slow the car without hitting the brakes -- since I wasn't participating in the propogation of red-light-madness, I hoped I was doing more good than harm...]

actually, most of the drivers get the message and vacate the fast lane (left
lane), as in the fast lane is supposedly for passing only, or the fast lane,

another thing, I use my horn VERY liberally when I drive, it's not just cell
phone drivers on the freeway, but those asleep at the wheel, or those in the
front waiting at the light, that don't go when the light turns green,
ESPECIALLY for the shorter timed, left turn arrow lights, I even bought an
air horn for my volvo for that purpose, drivers should focus on their
driving for the safety of themself, and all their passengers, and those
around them.

one guy, narrowly missed pedestrians crossing the street recently, and
almost killed them all, I blasted my horn and he woke up and swerved and
narrowly missed them at the crosswalk.

what gets me is those drivers that do what were complaining about in the
fast lane, because their reasoning is it's safer to talk and slow down in
the fast lane, because they only have to worry about the car to their right,
and because in the other lanes, they have to worry about cars to their left
and right, and the right side lanes, have merging traffic that they have to
deal with as they are driving, mean while they're holding everyone up in the
fast lane.

as for me, like I say, I pull off the freeway, If I have to chat, or don't
take the call, (VM),
and if i see some one coming up, faster than me in the fast lane, I vacate
it and move over for them, and that's the way it should be

the U.S. freeway was built, and modeled after the German Autobahn, after
General Eisenhower, saw it, and later became president, he wanted one built
just like it here, and so in Germany, when some one comes up behind you in
the fast lane, and flashes their lights, IT'S THE LAW, you have to move over
and vacate it for the faster traffic, that's the way it should be here

A re-reading of the California driver's handbook could be in order.
It's been a while, but IIRC:
- it's actually illegal to flash your lights at traffic
- the recommended practice is to stay in your lane and to avoid lane
changing for, eg, passing cars.
- excessive use of the horn is discouraged

Cell phone users aside, nobody actually drives like that. Theory and
practice can be radically different. Good job on saving the lives of
the pedestrians in the crosswalk.

negative,

I'm a firm believer in communication, audio (horn) &amp; visual (lights), I have
a firm belief that the automakers put the horns on cars so we could use them
to communicate,

example, someone lets me make a turn in traffic, a light tap of the horn and
wave, indicates a thank you, or
I see a trucker-semi-tractor trailer/18 wheeler, with his signals on, to
change lanes, I back off the throttle, flash my headlights a few times so he
can see them, (indicating I see him and am letting him move over) and he
makes the land change, then flashes his lights at me, indicating a thank
you. I do it all the time for truckers.

It's not illegal to flash your lights, it's illegal to use your high beams
on within 1000' of another car, the new law is, your head lights must be on,
even in daylight, if your windshield wipers have to be on, meaning it's
raining or snowing

&gt; &gt; traffic delays propogate. I've heard CHP say for every 1 minute of

&gt; &gt; takes 5 minutes to clear up. But that's not what the report was
&gt; &gt;  stating. The
&gt; &gt; report (as much as we've seen) said that cellphone talkers don't change
&gt; &gt; lanes, causing longer commutes.

&gt; &gt; This is a no-win argument -- years ago my commute took me along the 10

&gt; &gt; &quot;around&quot; traffic by taking an offramp and not-actually-exit and re-enter a
&gt; &gt; good 1/4 mile or more &quot;ahead&quot; of where you were &quot;stopped&quot;.    Of course, you
&gt; &gt; had to merge with two sources of oncoming traffic (one for each direction of
&gt; &gt; traffic on the surface street you were crossing with that ramp), then merge
&gt; &gt; with traffic actually on the freeway.  All this &quot;merging&quot; caused such a
&gt; &gt; tremendous slowdown that when all was said and done, you might have gained
&gt; &gt; one or two car-lengths against anyone who stayed on the freeway in the
&gt; &gt; right-most lane  (or, as I often got to chuckle over, you'd actually lose

Don, that is a lost art.

It used to be that trucks were the masters at communication and on
pre-super-highway two-lane roads would utilize just the kinds of signals you
recall. But these courtesies are not taught anymore by anyone but &quot;serious
truckers&quot; and then to each other. Now flashing lights and honking horns are
actually cause for a call to 911 to report &quot;road rage&quot; by the person
signaling.

With any kind of communication, it is not communication unless meaningful
information is passed. If a driver does not know that your slowing and
flicking the brights means he can move in front of you (he IS signaling that
intention after all...) there is no communication, only an indication that
you are FLASHING YOUR LIGHTS AT HIM and he will swerve in his lane while
wondering what he is doing wrong.

Try flashing your marker lights (in my motor home, there is a switch labeled
&quot;ICC Flashers&quot;) on and off once you have completed your safe lane change in
front of a big truck and that driver will likely turn his headlights off and
back on to say &quot;your are welcome.&quot; Only on the road, and only with
&quot;Professional Drivers&quot; anymore.

&gt; negative,

&gt; I'm a firm believer in communication, audio (horn) &amp; visual (lights), I

&gt; them to communicate,

&gt; example, someone lets me make a turn in traffic, a light tap of the horn
&gt; and wave, indicates a thank you, or
&gt; I see a trucker-semi-tractor trailer/18 wheeler, with his signals on, to
&gt; change lanes, I back off the throttle, flash my headlights a few times so he
&gt; can see them, (indicating I see him and am letting him move over) and he
&gt; makes the land change, then flashes his lights at me, indicating a thank
&gt; you. I do it all the time for truckers.

&gt; It's not illegal to flash your lights, it's illegal to use your high beams
&gt; on within 1000' of another car, the new law is, your head lights must be on,
&gt; even in daylight, if your windshield wipers have to be on, meaning it's
&gt; raining or snowing

&gt; &gt; It's been a while, but IIRC:- it's actually illegal to flash your lights
&gt; &gt; at traffic
&gt; &gt; - the recommended practice is to stay in your lane and to avoid lane
&gt; &gt; changing for, eg, passing cars.
&gt; &gt; - excessive use of the horn is discouraged

&gt; &gt; Cell phone users aside, nobody actually drives like that. Theory and
&gt; &gt; practice can be radically different. Good job on saving the lives of the
&gt; &gt; pedestrians in the crosswalk.

&gt; &gt; actually, most of the drivers get the message and vacate the fast lane

&gt; &gt; another thing, I use my horn VERY liberally when I drive, it's not just
&gt; &gt; cell phone drivers on the freeway, but those asleep at the wheel, or those
&gt; &gt; in the front waiting at the light, that don't go when the light turns green,
&gt; &gt; ESPECIALLY for the shorter timed, left turn arrow lights, I even bought an
&gt; &gt; air horn for my volvo for that purpose, drivers should focus on their
&gt; &gt; driving for the safety of themself, and all their passengers, and those
&gt; &gt; around them.

&gt; &gt; one guy, narrowly missed pedestrians crossing the street recently, and
&gt; &gt; almost killed them all, I blasted my horn and he woke up and swerved and
&gt; &gt; narrowly missed them at the crosswalk.

&gt; &gt; what gets me is those drivers that do what were complaining about in the
&gt; &gt; fast lane, because their reasoning is it's safer to talk and slow down in
&gt; &gt; the fast lane, because they only have to worry about the car to their right,
&gt; &gt; and because in the other lanes, they have to worry about cars to their left
&gt; &gt; and right, and the right side lanes, have merging traffic that they have to
&gt; &gt; deal with as they are driving, mean while they're holding everyone up in the
&gt; &gt; fast lane.

&gt; &gt; as for me, like I say, I pull off the freeway, If I have to chat, or
&gt; &gt; don't take the call, (VM),
&gt; &gt; and if i see some one coming up, faster than me in the fast lane, I
&gt; &gt; vacate it and move over for them, and that's the way it should be

Good luck with that; more than any of the 6 states I've lived in or the
35 others I've driven in, Californians have an irrational attraction to
the leftmost lanes; they'll jump right over regardless of conditions,
sometimes getting in front of faster traffic to do so.

Many times I've been on the 5N in the Camp Pendelton area at 2am coming
back from San Diego (i.e., 4 lanes of W I D E - O P E N highway), and
someone will get on and get right over into the left lane doing all of 70
and all by themselves.

The only thing I can figure is mediocre drivers hate making lane changes
(which is obvious if you see how long they take to make 'em, heads turning
and being sloppy doing so) and if they're as far left as possible they
only have to worry about changing lanes again when it's time to get off.

If 40% are alcohol related, that means 60% are non-alcohol related.
Therefore, driving drunk is MUCH safer...

yeah, but they rarely or never enforce it.

I've NEVER heard of anyone getting a ticket for that.

I have heard of people getting tickets for doing 45 or less on the freeway,
and this was back when the limit was 55.

I sound my horn crossing every speed hump.  Especially the ones a
block from my house. On the street with the fancy houses.
I mean there is some sort of problem there
if they need a speed hump (right next to the 35mph sign), so I
make sure everyone is alerted. Extra loud when it's dark, and I
can't see so well !   Mike
