*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
So you want to be a Fitness Model do you? Well let's see what that means. You might think that having a hot body is enough? Well a great body is an excellent start, but it's not enough.

Are you tough, and I mean tough because fitness modeling is a tough big business. The fitness model industry can be cut-throat, with thousands of beautiful, hard bodies all competing for the few jobs that are available.

Success in this industry has to be earned. That means hard work and personal investment from you. Overnight success stories are almost unknown. And even if you did find an "instant success story" you will find that they will have put in long hours, days, weeks, months, and years of unseen work into their careers before they were discovered.

Here then is an action plan for you if you still want to continue:

1. Plan. Lay out and decide on your personal, specific goal. The better you lay out your plan before you begin, the better chance you will have of creating success with it.

2. It's important to know exactly what kinds of fitness modelling jobs you want. There are many different types of jobs such as posing with clothes and fitness equipment at one end to sexy fitness models posing for fitness photos and even naked fitness models at the other.

3. Decide the kinds of photographers, fitness model agencies, and magazines you want to work for. Know whether you are willing to move house, and exactly how hard you are willing to work to get your career moving.

4. Educate yourself. If you are serious about making it as a fitness model. The more knowledge you have, the better prepared you will be. Arm yourself with precise information about how to find photographers, become irresistibly attractive, find work, and market yourself as a top fitness model.

5. Carry out your plan. The best plan in the world won't mean anything to you if you don't complete it. Set small, actionable goals and follow your plan consistently, and work it without fail, until you reach your goal.

6. Network, Network, Network. Research and attend the various trade and fitness shows. If you don't network and market yourself properly, you can forget about having any real success as a fitness model. There are millions of beautiful women out there, who want to be noticed, and like everyone else you have to hustle to get that business and that's by networking.

But remember you will be in the fitness industry; part of the entertainment business, and that attracts some unsavory types. I can't go down the list of all the possible pitfalls out there. Be careful and check and double-check everyone you do not know, or know about. Again do your research.

You may be beautiful and have a beautiful body but always remember this is a business and act professionally, it's expected. Stand out from the crowd and always carry good business cards with you, and don't be shy about handing them out.

When I say good business cards I mean properly printed quality business cards and not printed on your home computer, however good the software and paper is. The people you give them to will notice and it will reflect on your image.

There is no one secret to becoming a fitness model. There are many reasons that will influence how well you do. By committing yourself to hard work and fully educating yourself in the industry, you will stand a much better chance of becoming a successful fitness model.
