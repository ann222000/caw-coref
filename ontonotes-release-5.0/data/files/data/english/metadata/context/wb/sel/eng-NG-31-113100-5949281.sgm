<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When I was in India during World War II, I heard the word
&gt; &quot;anglo&quot; used to refer to people of mixed British and Indian
&gt; descent.  In the cases I heard it, it seemed to be being
&gt; used as a derogatory term.

&gt; I have two questions:

&gt; 1. Is the word &quot;Anglo&quot; still used for people of mixed
&gt; British and Indian parentage?

&gt; 2. If it is so used, is it used only in a derogatory way, or
&gt; can it be used inoffensively?

&gt; Any help anyone cares to give me will be greatly

Yes, "Anglo" is still used in Bharat to refer to mixed folk,
except that the foreign component can be British, American,
European, Australian, Canadian or any western-white looking
features. Moreover, "Anglo" can also refer to any white
westerner, mixed or not, although this usage has decreased.
This is similar to the term "haole" in Hawaii, even though
the word technically refers to any foreigner

No, the use of "Anglo" is not necessarily derogatory, though
often so.  "He's got an Anglo wife" is not usually said in
an insulting way, but "He's an Anglo, what do you expect!" is.

my questions in those newsgroups.  There was a time when
that would have been a deplorable violation of netiquette.

&gt; &quot;Anglo&quot; is still used in Bharat
">

Was anyone besides me puzzled by the word "Bharat"?

The way the word is used by Dr J M, it could be a language,
a region, or a nation.  But now I see in the _Information
Please Encyclopedia_ the following explanation under
"Bharat":

Some Indians, particularly Hindu nationalists,
prefer this name to that of _India_, a name they
believe to be of foreign origin.

Note incidentally that that sentence is not good English.
It's saying Hindu nationalists prefer the name Bharat to the
name of the word _India_.  I assume the writer's intended
meaning was

Some Indians, particularly Hindu nationalists,
prefer this name to _India_,

"This name" and "India" are properly parallel.  "This name"
and "that of India" are not.

There are times when it's appropriate to crosspost to another newsgroup,

original posting realizes there's a better place for it, or a place
where the residents are more likely to have an answer for a question

The problem is that J-Doc can claim he "feels" that postings about
Reincarnation in Judaism and Christian Priests Accused of Sexual Abuse
will be of interest to people on sci.lang. So he cherishes this
unfortunately loosely-worded bit of text from a decade ago as his
license to continue his obnoxious activity.

during ww2, india was under british subjugation and the anglos were thought
to be on the british side. this may be the reason - then. however, anglos
were treated with sympathy if not courtesey, more or less in line with the a
certain sympathy the muslims have in the hindu hearts because they are seen
as the result of foreign oppression and barbarity. to some they are a
unhappy reminder of a terrible past they would rather forget. obviously it
is not their fault. (the english, govt instead of paying for their welfare
secured privileges for them from the indian govt.)
however, years have rolled and history faded.

&gt;&gt; 1. Is the word &quot;Anglo&quot; still used for people of mixed

i have not heard anybody using it. however, i had one encounter with an
anglo a few years back. it was really strange. a man accosted us in a wide
mumbai street, and said somebody had picked his pocket, and he didn't have
bus fare to get back home, and if we would lend him the money. he looked
honest and i could see he was feeling low and embarassed. as we were getting
the money together for him, he said he was anglo, perhaps to look more
credible or more deserving. instantly there was a loud giggle in the party,
and we gave him the money, told him to be careful, wishing him luck.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2. If it is so used, is it used only in a derogatory way, or
&gt;&gt; can it be used inoffensively?
">

i have not heard it either way. actually, many people used to think that
most kirastanis in india are anglos. there are accounts in history that
inform that kirastanis never participated in the freedom struggle and were
well wishers of the colonial rule which justified the british prime
minister's policy that missionaries were 4th wing of the royal military.
however, the anglos receive good treatment, 180deg from the kids of vietnam
vets in vietnam.
i am not sure if the anglos are scattered over india or concentrated in some
place like kolkutta where most ww2 guys were i think. were you in kolkutta?

&gt; Yes, &quot;Anglo&quot; is still used in Bharat to refer to mixed folk,

&gt; European, Australian, Canadian or any western-white looking

&gt; This is similar to the term &quot;haole&quot; in Hawaii, even though

&gt; No, the use of &quot;Anglo&quot; is not necessarily derogatory, though

&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't &quot;hindu&quot; pejorative? At least you and this doc make me think so.

&gt;&gt;Hindu is the standard term for a practitioner of the Hindu religion
&gt;&gt;or a believer in the Hindu gods.  Thus used the name seems in no
&gt;&gt;way pejorative.

&gt;Unless, maybe, you're a Pakistani Muslim.

Not long ago we had a similar discussion in which it was suggested that "Jew"
and "Democrat" as nouns is fine, but "Jew" and "Democrat" as adjectives are
pejorative (and that the forms "Jewish" and "Democratic" are preferred)....r

I have heard "gringo" used even in New Guinea, Fiji, Tahiti

Honolulu, and at another in Los Angeles, the word is even
on the menu.  But to you think that linguists care to

They are very envious of us and our superior Vedic-Hindu past -- even after
the westerners massacred, looted and pillaged in Bharat for centuries.
Bharat, and Hindus have managed to climb back out of the hole in
which Muslim and Christian invaders pushed us, and this fact bothers
these savages to the extreme.  Their frustration is one measure of
our success.

Yes, especially since the Brits were pushed out Anglos
have enjoyed Hindu sympathy and compassion, that is,

&gt; i have not heard anybody using it. however, i had one encounter with an
&gt; anglo a few years back. it was really strange. a man accosted us in a wide
&gt; mumbai street, and said somebody had picked his pocket, and he didn't have
&gt; bus fare to get back home, and if we would lend him the money. he looked
&gt; honest and i could see he was feeling low and embarassed. as we were getting
&gt; the money together for him, he said he was anglo, perhaps to look more
&gt; credible or more deserving. instantly there was a loud giggle in the party,
&gt; and we gave him the money, told him to be careful, wishing him luck.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. If it is so used, is it used only in a derogatory way, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; can it be used inoffensively?
&gt; i have not heard it either way. actually, many people used to think that
&gt; most kirastanis in india are anglos. there are accounts in history that
&gt; inform that kirastanis never participated in the freedom struggle and were
&gt; well wishers of the colonial rule which justified the british prime
&gt; minister's policy that missionaries were 4th wing of the royal military.
&gt; however, the anglos receive good treatment, 180deg from the kids of vietnam
&gt; vets in vietnam.
&gt; i am not sure if the anglos are scattered over india or concentrated in some
&gt; place like kolkutta where most ww2 guys were i think. were you in kolkutta?

I have a feeling that Bob Cunningham is not going
to answer that question because this thread is also
posted in the language newsgroups, which he doesn't

Perhaps as a defense mechanism for their shame, Brits have
always mocked Kolkata.  I recall a joke the Brits had going
at college in Lundun years ago:

Do you know how Calcutta got its name?

No, how?

There was an Englishman who asked his
Bengali gardner when the grass had
been last mowed. The gardner replied,
"Kul katta, sahab."

The above is an example of how the Brits make fun of those
whom they loot, plunder and enslave.

&gt;&gt; BRITISH MADE HOLOCAUST OF 1943-44 KILLED 5 MILLION PEOPLE

&gt;&gt; The british starved millions of bengalis to death in
&gt;&gt; order to prevent Netaji's planned uprising. Netaji was
&gt;&gt; coming into India with the Indian National Army and the
&gt;&gt; Japanese. He was counting on the mass support of millions
&gt;&gt; of Bengalis. This plan fell through when millions died of
&gt;&gt; starvation.

Perhaps as a defense mechanism for their shame, Brits have
always mocked Kolkata.  I recall a joke the Brits had going
at college in Lundun years ago:

Do you know how Calcutta got its name?

No, how?

There was an Englishman who asked his
Bengali gardner when the grass had
been last mowed. The gardner replied,
"Kul katta, sahab."

The above is an example of how the Brits make fun of those
whom they loot, plunder and enslave.

And yet you suggest calling Republicans "Fascists" because some
Republicans (not me, by the way) have used the term "Democrat Party" in
referring to those who celebrate Jefferson-Jackson Day.  As I've said
here before, I have heard Democrats say they are members of the
"Democrat Party." Yes -- and right here in Detroit. What would you call
/them/?

You know, the Democratic Party is a party of Democrats. So saying "the
Democrat Party" is not quite as bad as some make it out to be. (Or so it
seems to me, but then, of course, I admit I'm not a Democrat.)

Frankly, I think this whole matter is overblown. I hear more Democrats
complaining about the term "Democrat Party" than I hear Republicans
actually using the term.

Some have criticized the political positions that some of the people

Yeah, right. One of my girlfriends a couple of decades back told me
that she wasn't jealous because she had lived in a menage a trois with
some guy and another woman in California for a year. But after she told
me that she needed some space, she did her damndest to seduce me the
afternoon of every day she knew that I had a date with another woman.
She didn't throw a jealous fit or anything, but she expressed her
concern about those dates. I would call that possessiveness.

The problem with your claim to accept all with perfect equanimity is
that it contradicts the content of your posts, especially the snide,
insinuating attacks you are so fond of making. You wouldn't use
judgmental terms such as "frothers", you wouldn't say judgmental things
about Martin like "he's a permanent resident of the deep end when it
comes to politics", and you wouldn't say things like "Someone who was
in a perpetual flying-off-in-rants phase.  Not someone to be paid
attention to." You would be non-judgmental. You would not allow your
negative opinions to show. You would be totally equanimous (self-
possessed), but you aren't and you never have been. Padraig came close,
but even he failed at the end when Rey's taunts got the better of him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, it was Charles, a few years ago, who made some vicious ad hominem
attacks directed at Maria, you, me, Rey, and a few others. But he was
just at the perigee of one of his bipolar swings.

&gt; Rey?  You? Someone who was in a perpetual flying-off-in-rants

to the "Republic Party."  It seemed the least I could do (and this
thread shows how much more could be done.)  Thought experiment: How
would Dick Cheney react if introduced by, say, Tim Russert on Meet the
Press as "Our Republic Vice President, Dick Cheney"?  How would Maria
react if everyone in AUE started calling her "Mary"?

I'll stay tuned for further developments.

No, I don't.  Few would.

To say that "The Democrat party leaders are a bunch of incompetent,
bumbling, corrupt, and lying bastards" is no more a vile slur than
saying  "The Democratic party leaders are a bunch of incompetent,
bumbling, corrupt, and lying bastards".  The insult lies in the words
after "Democrat".

The above is used for example only, by the way.   It's not my position
that Democrats are any more likely to incompetent, bumbling, corrupt
or liars than are their Republican counterparts.  Or less.

My guess: He'd laugh. To comment beyond that, I'd have to know if the VP
is someone who uses the term "Democrat Party." I've never heard him say
it, but I don't listen to *everything.*

Of course, Cheney is "our Republic's Vice President," (note the
possessive) more than he is "our Republican Vice President."  (How many
Vice Presidents do we have at any one time? And, is Mr. Cheney the only
Republican VP we've ever had?)

Anyway, calling him "our Republic Vice President" would be like calling
Al Gore "our Democrat Vice President, so if that's what Republicans
called Al Gore, then go for it. All's fair in love, war, and politics.
(Or do I mean horseshoes?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ....How would Maria

">

I'd say, nicely, "Oh, it's 'Maria,' but I've been called "Marie" or
"Mary" many times." If the person persisted with "Mary," I'd just let it
go. There are longtime friends of mine who usually call me "Marie." I'm
not insulted. "Mary" is less commonly used for me -- it's doesn't sound
as similar to "Maria" as "Marie" does.

And now that I'm thinking about it, the Italian janitor ("Italian" as in
"from Italy") where I worked in the '60s and '70s used to call me "Mary"
all the time. I never said anything about it to him. Maybe he thought
"Maria" was my name only in Italian.

That doesn't answer your question, though -- you were refering, I think,
to written posts, not conversation. Well, I don't know. There's a chance
I might not recognize "Mary" as referring to me. There's also a chance
that I might adopt "Mary" as my screen name. Why not? It's better than,
say, "Murgatroyd". NTTAWWM.

We may have discussed this (Maria/Marie) thing before, and I have no
idea what I might have said then. And IATLTLIU. Also, my opinions
sometimes change. Ex: There was a time when I really had no use for Sen.
Carl Levin, but now, I see him differently. That is, he's not as bad
when it comes to things that matter to Michiganders* as I previously
thought.

*"Michiganians" may be the official term, but no one I know actually
uses it. It's just too wussy.

I think that on John Stewart's "The Daily Show ( I don't recall his

adjectival "Democrat Party", while smirking during the SOTUA.  Stewart
asked his guest if that was a partisan dig.  I can't recall the guest's

"Wisconsonites." I think this group (aue) might find "Wisconsonants"

Btw, if I had to choose between the terms "Michiganian" and
"Michiganite," I'd plump for the latter every time. The "gan" in
"Michiganian" is pronounced like "gain." Michigan doesn't have that 'a'
and wouldn't really want it. And note that I would pronounce
"Michiganite" with the accent on the first syllable, and the "ganite"

If it were later in the day, I'd now say "g'night" all.

Not usually, at least not that I've heard in lower Michigan. The Upper
Peninsula is the "Upper Peninsula"; "Northern Michigan" is the upper

I've spent many a vacation week in Northern Michigan, but I've been the
the UP only a few times -- for a total of maybe five days.

Michigan is a beautiful state, especially outside the metro-Detroit
area. I suppose the "outstate" areas of most states are prettier than

I have driven the UP (on US 2) from Ironwood to St. Ignace, staying
