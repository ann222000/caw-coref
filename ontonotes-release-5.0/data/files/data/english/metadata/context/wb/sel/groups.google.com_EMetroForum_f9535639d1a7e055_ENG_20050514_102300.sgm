I often use the Enneagram (similar to Myers-Briggs Type Indicator-MBTI)
along with AA's 12-step program (and other tools!) to shed light on
unhealthy patterns that prevent us from living life to the full. What
attracted me to the Enneagram is its premise that it's only when people
have an understanding of God as one who loves - unconditionally - can
they have courage to explore what's hidden and destructive and is
undermining their true God-given identity. (i.e. destructive patterns
of control, people-pleasing, etc. to get needs met.)

I joined an Enneagram discussion board awhile back. Because the
Enneagram has the spiritual foundation of grace, I wanted to find out
if anyone knew who the God of grace really is. I posted the following
two days ago as a springboard for discussion.

What I wrote to Enneagram discussion board:

&quot;I reject teachings that make the God of the Bible look like he's out
to get people if they do wrong or offend him - as if he's a &quot;policeman
in the sky&quot;. I see the God of the Bible as merciful, loving,
all-powerful and the giver of freedom and identity. I believe in Jesus
Christ and I'm not religious. He is as real to me as are my children or
husband even though I can't &quot;see&quot; Him. I know He's with me. It's a
spiritual thing. I can't conjure him up. He's separate from me; though
we are one. He can't be put in a box. I don't have any desire to
convince anyone of his existence because only He can do that. I'm
putting this out there because I want to gain an understanding from how
you who want to will respond.&quot;

Responses so far:

*I believe in Jesus Christ as an historical figure. I'm assuming that
you're talking about Jesus Christ as more than just an ordinary human
being. This is foreign to me.

*I agree with most of Jesus' proposals for how humans should treat each
other. But I have major problems with the way that the major religions
have twisted and used his teachings in order to control and dehumanize
people.

*The point at which religious beliefs become offensive to me is when
they become an excuse for trying to judge, control, or kill others.

*I believe that he did exist however I believe he was a man and son of
God as we all are. I'm able to perceive this way of thinking and it
makes sense TO ME. Religion has a lot of negative issues attached to it
for me. It is about not being good enough and not having personal
value. Actually, I think of what most call &quot;the church&quot; as corporations
or buildings of people who often come together for social reasons more
than to seek spiritual growth. The Church that Jesus started is built
on himself, spirituality and IS converted people of God. We're told
that God seeks those who worship him in truth and spirit. So, yes, I
agree with you about feeling the presence of God and Christ in my life.
I always have, even as a small child.

*I really enjoy studying scriptures when it is not filtered through
organized &quot;religion&quot; which I believe is often just big business instead
of spirituality. I find the Old and New Testament extremely
interesting.

PLEASE respond: How do what these people say impact you? Can you
relate/empathize? How would you minister to them. Or, perhaps, they
can minister to us!!!

The fields are ripe!!!!!

For those who do not like organized religion:
I can see why people do not like organized religion.
I would be careful, though, to seperate religion from Jesus.

I mean, fine, don't go to church. Don't read the bible, don't love your
neighbor..But give Jesus a chance.
He's full of the truth you're probably really hungry for.

I personally identify with points 3-5. The first two I disagree with
as far as my personal belief goes. I don't think I am good at
ministering to people, so I don't know what I would say to those
people, Pam, and for that I think the Holy Spirit will guide you, since
they are in your &quot;sphere of influence&quot;, or ministry (can you tell I
studied politics? ha ha...).

I really appreciate the responses from those on the Enneagram
discussion board. I expected these kinds of comments AND it's easy to
see that people are at least trying to separate religion from Jesus.
What I hear in the responses is that churches that are controlling are
turning people away from them - but not necessary away from Jesus!
That's exciting to me. People who use God's Word to control don't have
as much impact on people as I once thought. Some, like the ones above,
are healthy enough to stay away from a controlling religion. That's
comforting. It proves to me, once again, that Jesus is Lord of the
church and will not allow it to control His Gospel.

I don't hear things like, &quot;I don't go to church because all they talk
about is forgiveness for sin and how much Jesus Christ loves me no
matter what I do.&quot; or, &quot;I don't go to church because I am offended by
the teaching that when I relapse, the Lord is going to be there to help
pick me up,&quot; etc.

If I heard people say those things, I'd know they are rejecting the God
of the Bible - the God of Redemption. It's pretty interesting that
some people have wanted nothing to do with Metro West Outreach because
they are angry that we're not saying, for example, to the addict or
homosexual, etc. &quot;If you don't shape up God will not be with you.&quot; We
say the opposite, that our Lord is with them ESPECIALLY when they mess
up. That has RILED people. I question whether they know Jesus - but -
that's Jesus' problem, not mine. He loves THEM, too.

When I hear what those on the Enneagram discussion board are saying, I
know they are not rejecting our Jesus. They are rejecting a false god
- legalism - AND I thank God for that!!!!! I'm with them 100%. (See
Metro's web page for information on what legalism is if you are having
trouble with the term. It is well-defined there.)

The Apostle Paul said in Galatians 1:6: &quot;I am amazed that you are so
quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a
differet gospel - which is really NO Gospel at all. Some are
disturbing you and want to distort the Gospel of Christ. BUT even
though we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel
contrary to that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.
As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to
you a Gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be cursed.&quot;

Thank God that those of us who have the call to teach, preach, witness,
etc. (that's ALL of us!) have a Savior with the nail-scarred hands who
forgives us for in any way distorting the Gospel of our Jesus! And
thank God, when we do, He's still Lord of those we've hurt and WILL
lead them in the Truth of the Gospel when we do not!!

What a mighty God we serve!

The other day at work, a group of extremely religious folks came in to
purchase some bread. This group of people has come in on many
occasions, and handed out religious brochures with titles like, &quot;Are
You Really Saved?&quot;

One of my buddies at work is extremely anti-religious. When these
people come in, he doesn't just laugh it off, he gets ANGRY. He feels
as if these people are attempting to control his thinking and beliefs,
and telling him that he isn't good enough.

We got to talking about this the other day, and I mentioned to him that
I could remember a time when I was about 12 years old, my school friend
asked me, &quot;Are you saved?&quot; I had no idea what that meant, and I
finally figured out that she was asking me if I was going to Heaven.
It was a very intrusive way to ask such a personal question. My friend
replied, &quot;Yeah, that's bull-s**t. How does anyone know that they're
'saved'? I mean, what the hell makes people think that they know what
they're even talking about is so true?&quot;

I nodded my head and said, &quot;Yeah, it's crap when people impose
themselves on others.&quot;

I know that my friend grew up in a very legalistic church, and has a
lot of anger built up in him because of it. I bet he actually does
believe there is a real God, but religion has at least temporarily
ruined it for him.

In the past, I may have been tempted to fix his line of thinking, but I
have realized over the years that that would make me just as
incredulous as the girl who asked me if I was saved. My friend's
problem is a God problem. All of the people who responded to the
original comment in the same sort of way also have God problems.

I certainly can relate to what several of the people who responded to
your post said. Religion has at best not offered me much that's
relavent to my life, and at worst, ministered judgement, comdemnation
and control.

Comments like theirs minister to me because they let me see what other
people out there whose perceptions aren't colored by the same religious
background that I've come from are thinking. They also confirm that a
gospel of love and acceptance is what people need to hear about.

I think it's great that people know in their hearts that God is good
even if they don't hear it from any religious organization. He's
talking to people and they're hearing Him. That's exciting!

Listening-Hearing what the other person is saying- is so important.
Laura, you took the time to listen to your co-worker. In the process,
you found out a tidbit of why religion is so frightening to him.
Hopefully, your listening to him will in turn help him listen to you
when you tell him about your Jesus.

Kim- I agree with your response to Laura. Jesus preached compassion.
I think we often think we &quot;know&quot; what compassion is... like the folks
in the bakery... hoping people are saved. But compassion is serving
and identifying with people, giving of your time, with love. I have
been told by many people that they don't like organized religion
because they aren't LISTENED to. People just preach at them. I find
that amazing. I think, well, if that's all it takes! ha ha...
Laura's ears are important in her co-worker's life. That's awesome,
and hopefully he'll be able to confide in her more in the future.

Love the comments. It is really dawning on me big time and I thought I
was &quot;over it&quot;: I still have the tendency to &quot;look over my shoulder&quot; to
see if I'll be caught doing, saying, thinking or feeling something
wrong. AND, it's not my Lord who I'm thinking will &quot;catch me&quot;. I'm not
afraid of Him. If I'm out of line, He'll directly let me know and give
me help to change stuff around. He certainly won't reject me. He's an
excellent disciplinarian and my close friends who point out to me -
with love - that I'm headed in the wrong direction are part of that
discipline. (Discipline makes disciples!)

This all hit me when Sarah pointed out that I cussed (previous post).
I know Sarah and that word did not bother her at all and I know she was
kidding. And I know that even if it DID bother her, she'd not reject
me. (By the way, a few of us have talked about not using anything that
looks like profanity on this discussion board because it can give a
very wrong impression to some people and we don't want to do that here.
I DID mess up! and I apologize.)

Anyway, I started to think, &quot;What will Christians think of me?&quot; Not,
&quot;What will people who don't know Christ think of me?&quot; Not, &quot;What will
Jesus think of me?&quot; And my answer was, &quot;Christians will think I'm not
walking with Jesus. They'll think I don't have faith. They'll think,
they'll think, etc.!&quot; I'm still thinking I have to live up to some
kind of standard within Christianity. Like I said, I thought I was
OVER that. Because of where I've been in the body of Christ, and not
just in any one denomination but in many churches I've visited,
calling myself a &quot;Christian&quot; has been very difficult for me. Like
Laura has had a difficult time with the word &quot;sin&quot;, my buzz word is
&quot;Christian&quot;. To me what Christianity has meant is: &quot;If you want to
call yourself a Christian, you have to live by all the rules - most of
which you don't know until you break them. If you don't, God will
reject you and so will we.&quot;

What I know is that I've been around a lot of legalistic teaching that
is called &quot;Christian&quot;. So, since I reject legalism - with the help of
God!!! - I have somehow rejected the term &quot;Christian&quot;, also.

Not good!!!

So from here on in I'll proudly wear the word &quot;Christian&quot; because I
think it's original meaning is someting like &quot;a person who believes
that Jesus Christ came to save sinners from hell, will give them faith
to believe that's true, will proclaim them clean by His blood and will
continue to walk in them until He leads them home.&quot; At least that's
what I thought it meant before I got involved with a lot of legalistic
teaching back in the day.

I'm not going to let legalism steal anything more from what Jesus has
won - including the name, &quot;Christian&quot;.

So there!

That bit about &quot;I started to think, &quot;What will Christians think of me?&quot;
Not, &quot;What will people who don't know Christ think of me?&quot; -- that
really hit me. From my experience, when churches make decisions about
stuff like worship formats, musical styles, etc. the primary
make-or-break question is NOT, &quot;How might this affect people whom we
want to connect with Jesus?&quot; The primary question is more like, &quot;Will
this make anybody in church mad?&quot;

I heard a presentation last week by the senior pastor of a progressive,
growing church in Green Bay who said that their church operates by the
&quot;99/1&quot; principle: In Jesus' story about the good shepherd, the shepherd
leaves the 99 sheep who stayed with the flock and focused his energies
on the one sheep who got lost.

(And, by the way, Pam, don't give me that crap about &quot;no crap.&quot; That's
as far from being a &quot;cuss word&quot; as, say, &quot;doo-doo.&quot;)

I was surprised just now reading that you reacted right away &quot;What will

I'm not judging you for reacting that way (mind you), I'm just
surprised.
I know you are sensitive, but I think you've become less people
sensitive than you are truth sensitve over the yeras....

AND THE TRUTH THAT YOU USUALLY HEAR FIRST:
&quot;You're forgiven..You're clean. I love you Pam!&quot;

I think your christiany reaction was just a little brain slip..

I have made it a point to understand where people are coming from -
that doesn't mean I am obligated to agree! Jesus does that!! He
honors each one of us and listens FOR understanding (that doesn't mean
He's obligated to agree either!) In my May 14 post, I shared what I
had posted on the Enneagram Discussion board and responses I received.
(Enneagram is Greek for &quot;9 points&quot;. It refers to our 9 points of view.
We've used the Enneagram a lot at Metro as another tool in the
recovery process. It helps us to know ourselves better - our strengths
and weaknesses - so that we can better live in the freedom Christ won
for us.)

Anyway, my topic is still alive on the Enneagram board. I posted the
following there and I'm sharing with you more responses. These people
have much to say I think. I am not posting these to condemn
church!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm posting these because I
think what happens in some churches is destructive and hurts people.
Since I'm calling myself a Christian and AM part of the body of Christ,
I want to hold myself accountable for any damage I've caused others &quot;in
the name of Jesus.&quot; When I taught Sunday School to 7th and 8th
graders years ago, on the first day I asked them, &quot;Why do you not like
coming to Sunday School.&quot; I wrote down all their responses on the
board. AND I then told them they had excellent points and that as
their teacher I'd pray for help in not hurting them the way they had
been hurt in the past. I think that's only fair.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From Pam (posted on Enneagram Discussion Board)

"/>

I'm back for a minute on this topic. Thanks so much for taking time to
share. I think that a lot of people who reject Jesus are seeing him
through the eyes of what churches say about him. I met him apart from a
church and apart from reading the Bible. What I'm thinking is that
many of you who have replied to my post are looking at the religion of
Christianity as judgmental, controlling, conditional and condemning.
I've been rejected a lot within Christian groups because I reject the
teaching that God is conditional, a punisher, etc. The place of my
greatest pain is within the churches. My unhealthy 8 thrives in
churches that try to control me because I refuse to be seduced by that
teaching. I'm often much safer with people who do not agree with me
that my Jesus is with me no matter what than with people who say they
believe in Him and who are control freaks.

I have had a relationship with Jesus all of my life and had &quot;joined&quot;
the religion of Christianity many years later. Many times I've had
to separate Jesus from that religion and, at the same time, not throw
the baby out with the bathwater. Jesus is a judge - but not
judgmental; He's about freedom - not control; His love is unconditional
(I never say &quot;conditional&quot; love anymore. They are oxymorons! Love
simply is not conditional); and He has mercy and not condemnation (The
whole point of His going to the cross was that He'd take the
condemnation that we deserved. And His Father chose to condemn His only
son because He loved us so much.) Anyway, thanks for responding. I'm
learning with the help of the enneagram to set big-time boundaries with
Christians who are into legalism (as described above) and to not
stereotype others who are not.

Responses:

1. I have felt deeply a &quot;god presence&quot; with me all my life - sometimes
I call that presence Christ, and sometimes I do not. I think Christ is
one face of God. In my younger years I felt a calling to Christian
ministry, and that led me to examine my beliefs and open myself to
other experiences of the divine. And while I am an ordained Christian
minister, I have a great deal of trouble identifying with Christianity
anymore. &quot;Christians&quot; I have encountered lately are just downright
mean, and they are mean in the name of Jesus. And they're mean to my
kids, and you just don't want to go there!

2. It is the born again christian zealots that give christianity a bad
name, I don't think that you have to go to church to have a personal
relationship with god. Anyone, regardless of religion, who use their
sacred texts or religious beliefs as a weapon, is a pain in the butt.
Or worse.

3. But even in &quot;liberal&quot; Christian denominations there is very little
emphasis on spiritual growth. It's all about being political. I have
sat through many nauseating meetings in which people want to change
something, only to be met with &quot;but we've always done it that way...&quot;
Or, &quot;We can't change how we do communion because Mr. and Mrs. Golden
Schnauzer donated that communion set to the church in 1903...&quot; Or,
&quot;Change the hymnal? But why, we've used these for 60 years and we can
always get them rebound. Besides, those new ones have inclusive
language, and everyone knows that god is male...&quot; Anything new will be
met with fierce resistance, even if the church is dying.

4. People will never be perfect, it's just something we have to live
with. We fall in love with the world, and some people don't want to end
that relationship. The minute people in any type of organisation get
together it always descends into an orgy of politics.

5. Gandhi said it very well: &quot;I like your Christ. I do not like your
Christians. They are so unlike your Christ.&quot;

Churches house christians, not christ, subsequently, if one truly wants
to know christ, he is better off standing in a parking lot, or a
shopping mall, or an apartment complex than standing in a church. It is
you christians that need to find christ in a parking lot, shopping
mall, or apartment complex. It is you christians who are inhibited by
the existence of churches. Everyone else doesn't really care either
way. Sometimes you people make it really hard for people to care about
you.

I just got back from a run-walk that I went on right after I wrote what
I did here earlier today. I was asking myself why am I so passionate
about differentiating between legalism and the message of redemption.
Am I obsessed? Probably. Or, is it a God thing. Probably both!!!
Most of us have mixed motivations in all that we do. Anyway, I really
want to know if people reject what they hear in church or are rejecting
Jesus. Keep in mind that my calling and career are about helping
people come to grips with what's keeping them unhealthy. I, for
example, have not set foot in a church that teaches legalism for years.
I turn the radio off immediately if I hear a preacher go anywhere near
describing a god that is conditional. However, I'm hearing from people
I minister to and to people that hire me to help them sort things out,
that they are leaving churches or are struggling with leaving churches
that teach legalism. These people are NOT rejecting Jesus, they are
rejecting a different god - a god of conditions. (who I call Satan)
They are getting healthier and closer to Jesus as they reject that
which is NOT Jesus Christ.

How many times have we heard, &quot;I don't think he/she is a Christian.
They don't go to church.&quot;&quot;My child just hates going to church.&quot;&quot;My
husband is not spiritual. He doesn't go to church with me.&quot; I ALWAYS
respond to people who tell me this stuff, &quot;Maybe they have a good
reason. Did you ever ask them?&quot;

I believe our Lord is protecting His people from churches that are
heavily into legalistic teachings that aim to set Him up to be somebody
He is not. When they follow the clear voice of the Lord that
encourages them to set boundaries - which might mean leaving a
denomination or a particular church they've been involved with for
years, they become healthier. The false god of conditions is replaced
with Jesus Christ. These people then, and I'm one of them, are very
stand-offish about entering &quot;church&quot; ever again. We have to learn to
not throw the baby out with the bath water. (Some of you have been so
blessed by your church, you won't understand this. PRAISE God!)

I really want to know when I talk to people if they are rejecting Jesus
or rejecting teachings that have nothing to do with Him. If the
latter is true, I encourage them to look for places that teach grace
so they don't isolate - even if that &quot;place&quot; is sitting around the
campfire with some buddies (almost said &quot;buds&quot;) or sitting in a cafe
drinking coffee. If it's the real Jesus who they reject - the Lord of
mercy and redemption - then it's our Lord I run to, asking Him to open
that person's heart to trust Him - just like He opened mine.

Pam said If its the real Jesus who they reject-the Lord of mercy and
redemption-then it's our Lord I run to, asking Him to open that
person's heart to trust Him-just like He opened mine. I know every
person who knows their Jesus will confront a father, mother, sister,
brother, friend, neighbor, stranger who doesn't know their Jesus. This
is where difficult questions about faith, church, religion, God,
legalism, sin, grace, godly living, death and life come into play.
These issues are not easily explained and do not have pat answers. Life
is just too complicated and people who live in this world are even
more complicated then the life they exist in. I think giving it to
Jesus, like Pam said, is the best we can do. Ephesians 1:17-18

I only say that because Jesus reveals himself to us. All the talking
and preaching in the world won't and cannot do a thing until Jesus open
us up to &quot;see&quot; Him. That's why I NEVER put pressure on people who
don't believe in Him!! I wouldn't believe in Him either unless He
showed Himself to my heart!

You go, Kim!!!! I've known you for almost 30 years? and you have never
let legalism/control rule you - although your fight for freedom against
it almost cost you your emotional sanity! That's why you know that
JESUS reigns because you did NOT lose it in the long run!

Thanks Pam for the shot of encouragement. As you know, I have always
follow the beat of a different drummer, and it is good to hear that I'm
an ok person for doing so. I was rake over the coals for 8 years and
it is nice to be sitting next to a spring-fed cool stream. Have a
blessed day in Jesus. I know you will.
