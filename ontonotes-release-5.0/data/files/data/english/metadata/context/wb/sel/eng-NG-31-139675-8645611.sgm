Never had that before... Got Cleaver from my god, blessed two scrolls
of enchant weapon, read one scroll (weapon glowing for a while), read
the second scroll (weapon glowing for a while), and Cleaver is already
vibrating. Identify showed it as the +7 Cleaver! With just two scrolls;
usually I need 4 or 5 blessed scrolls to get above +5. Is it possible
that I got Cleaver already at +3 from my god?

Still need some way to kill that troll with his wand of dead who missed
me the first time so I could flee... - I have no MR and no reflection.
Though, I have a lot cockatrice corpses, but I cannot safely approach
that critter. :-/

But that would involve lining up with the source of possible

It's the touch of death monster spell that you're thinking of.

The only defences against wands of death are:
- MR
- Reflection
- being polyselfed into one of the types of creature that are immune to
death rays.

You can safely approach as long as you're not lined up with him.
In an open room, you only have to be lined up when you finally
approach him.  If you have speed, you should be able to make the
final approach, and hit him with the cockatrice corpse, without
his getting a turn in between.  (Trolls are, I believe, fairly
slow.)

Of course, &quot;safely&quot; isn't perhaps the appropriate word.  When I
had that problem, it was an elf with the wand; elves are fast,
and I was a Barbarian without speed, and I ended up leaving a
bones file.  In general, it's a very delicate solution.  But it
might be worth trying, *if* you've got speed.

That's the problem. As a barbarian my quest artifact does not provide MR.
Sokoban did have the bag. I've checked a blessed smoky potion that I had.
I tested quite a couple of fountains for wishes. No silver dragons, yet.
No Ludios. The troll is around level 19. Once I dig past that level I'll
be trapped between a possible titan at Medusa or purple liches at the
Castle on the one side and the troll with the wand of death on the other.
I could of course also wait until XL:14 to see what's in the quest levels;
maybe a random &quot;AoRefl there. But currently I've only XL:13/~50000 points.
Now, wait for XL:14 (less risky) or dig past dlvl:19 (less boring)? (I am
inclined to do the latter.)

This is true, but as such it just means you dismiss the Quest from the

Your call.  I would just dig for the Castle, bang the bridge, wish up

There are still some fountains left, but not yet successful with them.
No thrones (and the quest leader immediately dismisses me, so I can't
yet try the throne he's sitting on). The single blessed smoky potion I

Well, XL:14 is not really helpful, since the quest artifact is crap.
Just the faint possibility to find the specific amulet on the additional
levels makes it worth, I guess.

Still say this is selective perception combined with over-paranoia.

You fear them more than I ever did, so you remember the times it occurs
far more vividly.  Yet I ascended all 13 roles on NAO and remember _zero_
purple Ls at the castle.  It is equally likely that I discount/misremember
the possibility of purple Ls to the same degree that you overemphasize it; I
really need to have a good look at the source and see what exactly the
chances are of any of those castle Ls being generated as purple for an xl14
character.  This would give us something concrete to work from, rather
than relying on the anecdotal (ie. unreliable) evidence of both our

10% chance per hit that you'll wake up a sleeper.  Unless you're doing
lots of damage, that will add up rapidly over a few swings, and when
it's carrying a wand of death you want it to get exactly 0 turns.

(Plus, trolls are stalkers, meaning that if you're banging on it from
melee range and it wakes up, most of the standard escape methods are
ineffectual.)

A full fort will work... assuming nothing picks up the boulders, you
have a suitable ranged attack to zap at the troll, and the troll doesn't
revive during the turns it will take you to open the fort and get to his
corpse.

A single boulder will just get you zapped when the troll goes around the
boulder to get to you, unless you can guarantee the troll stays in a
corridor; but this magnifies the problem of &quot;how do I get to the wand
before the troll revives?&quot;

Better choice than the fort: dig for the wand and wish up MR/Reflection.

I think a fort with a big stack of missile weapons is a fine idea.
Rocks are cheap, too.  But it has some big drawbacks including
wandering giants and hostiles with wands of striking.  Also, you need
to be certain that you can both not be zapped when you enter the level
and get the troll lined up well enough for you to be able to attack it
from range.  It's fraught with peril but certainly feasible with some
clever tactics.  How about trapping the troll with a boulder that you
keep pushing toward it?  A double pit &quot;^^&quot; will also keep the troll
out of an area.  However, you might not have sufficient time for such
&quot;corralling&quot; techniques.  Another problem is that hanging around too
long on Lvl 19 might see the generation of golden nagas or covetous
liches; and that would be bad.

As for the reviving troll: after you kill the troll, it should only
take you 2 moves to push the boulder and autopickup the wand.  If he
revives after 1 move, then he will revive off of the wand anyway with
the boulder on the loot square.

Digging for the castle is a fine idea, but you'll need that wand of
digging to potentially instantly drop through the titan's level.  I've
been surrounded there before by titan storms.  It can happen and it'd
be a shame to kill off a level 14 hero.  Also, be sure that you don't
dig all the way to the castle, take the stairs if possible so that you
don't end up in the middle of the maze with a lich on the upstair and
a minotaur in the maze.  Remember also that Elbereth doesn't protect
against all of the nasties.  If you have a cursed scroll of teleport
you might consider keeping it out of your bag.

Good luck!

The biggest problem that I can see with this is that taking care of the
troll (known to be carrying an instantly-lethal ranged item that you
have none of the binary defences against) is the 'hard' way to go.  Why
do things the hard way when the easy way is available?

The troll is on DL19.  There's time before Medusa; you only need one
level to retreat to.

Why force the issue?

You say yourself that this is &quot;fraught with peril but feasible with
clever tactics&quot;, which I pretty much agree with.  Possible, yes.  But
it's the hard way.  The easy way (go for the item that will give you
both of the binary defences, MR and reflection) is available, and he
has all the tools to precisely execute such a maneuver.

This, I think, is where a lot of people kill ascendable characters;
getting fixated on a particular problem and trying to solve it _right
then_, even if it means doing it the hard way or a really complex way
that requires a lot of careful attention.

Nethack is, in many ways, not so much about solving problems as it is
about obviating them completely, so that they require no attention.
The troll with a wand of death is either a problem to be solved (if
you insist on killing him now) or moot (if you go for the Castle and
come back for him).

Unless he turns to flee at some point -- meaning you have to wait and

He only has to dig past the troll's level and the titan's level; that's
two charges.  All the rest of the levels are _not_ guarded by trolls

The castle _can_ be generated directly below Medusa, so this is always a

Well, certainly.  :)  It may be no good against the troll, but that

Looking at the sources would be interesting, indeed. I've chosen another

Do you have a non-cursed scroll of earth? And some potions? And a dart
trap that you can disarm?

Get a cat or dog.
Make yourself a stack of poisoned darts.
Read that scroll of earth.
Throw darts until troll is dead.

Quickly retrieve the wand.
Let your cat or dog eat the troll.

Problem solved.

Alternatively, you can tame a horse, raise it up to a warhorse, haste
it with a potion or wand, then let it kill the troll for you, while
you are in another room.

Happy hacking.

I am presuming &quot;selective perception&quot; on both our sides.  I think it is
highly unlikely that I actually went through 13 games without seeing a

I _always_ presume &quot;selective perception&quot; on anecdotal evidence until I

Yes.  But you have the tools to avoid needing to retreat.

-- You have a wand of lightning.  Only @, A, minotaurs, and Riders are
meaningful threats to you in melee.  A purple L at the castle is both
rare and meaningless at the same time.  (You may even have a potion of
hallucination available, which fails against the troll but _does_ work
for a purple L.)

-- You are an XL13 Barbarian with Cleaver.  You can melee minotaurs and
captains and win, because you have a gazillion HP and a big weapon that
will hit every time.

-- You have the wand of digging needed to escape the Titan Medusa.  If
you accidentally dig to the Castle (unlikely if you're careful) and
land in the maze, see the previous two points; neither a purple L nor
a minotaur is a big deal.

There aren't any other threats.  The Castle is dealt with via banging
the drawbridge; this will give you MR and reflection, which renders the
wand of death meaningless.  And more importantly, the Castle is
somewhere you were going _anyway_.

The elaborate &quot;kill the troll&quot; method is the hard way. Really. :)

&quot;Summarizing&quot; was a bad idea in this case. Why? Take the example for

problematic situation in question.

Sorting by level is not too meaningful anyway, given the small amount

25: 17%     26: 67%     27: 50%     28: 50%     29: 0%

What I mean is; risk = probability of event * severity of event

Meeting a titan is 50%, meeting a purple lich at Castle is, say, 33%;
severity is, say, medium (opinions differ).

&gt; &quot;Summarizing&quot; was a bad idea in this case. Why? Take the example for

Not really, because what we want is to figure out what the chance is
that any given L is purple.

We already know one truth from castle.des that can be gleaned from
direct observation:  there will be some L's at the castle.  27 random
monsters are generated, spread evenly across 10 swap slots and 10 types
of monsters; this means that 3 slots are only used twice.

What this means is that there is a 70% chance of the castle having three L,
and a 30% chance of the castle having two L.  From that, once we know the
chance that any given L will be generated purple, we can extrapolate that
over the 70%-chance-of-three and 30%-chance-of-two to determine what the
actual chance is of seeing a purple L at the castle.

In this case, we saw 56 liches, 7 of which were purple, giving a (very
inaccurate) 1/8 chance of any given L being purple.  If there are three
liches that's a 33%-ish chance of one being purple; if there are two that's
a 25%-ish chance; works out to about 30% or so overall.

We both agree that the sample size is far too small, of course, so the
above paragraph serves as nothing more than handwaving until I get a
chance to look and see what the _real_ chances are per level.  But this
is why I summarised it the way I did.  :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What's really non-negotiable is: you cannot go near the troll.

&gt;&gt; &gt; He woke up very early without me hitting him! :-(
&gt;&gt; _That_ is just unlucky.  :)

&gt; Actually, no; I was lucky!  Because I approached to kill him, and if
&gt; I'd have made one or two more steps I most probably would have been
&gt; unable to retreat.

Well, if you were going to try to kill him, that creates a different
issue.  Monsters like that I don't bother trying to kill; if they wake
up, they get a turn immediately, and that gives me a 10% chance of death
just for swingin' the sword.  No way; rather go to the Castle, since I
have all the tools.

&gt;&gt; Yes.  But you have the tools to avoid needing to retreat.

&gt; What I mean is; risk = probability of event * severity of event

&gt; Meeting a titan is 50%, meeting a purple lich at Castle is, say, 33%;
&gt; severity is, say, medium (opinions differ).

I'd worry more about the titan summoning a stalker the minute you move
off the stairs than I would an arch-lich at the castle.

There are no random factors in this.  You won't &quot;accidentally&quot; retreat
to the level with the troll on it unless you're outright sloppy.  Good
Nethack players long ago trained the sloppy out of themselves.  You've
ascended often enough.  Stop worrying that you'll be sloppy.

I usually don't count &quot;good maybes&quot; when I'm considering risks unless

If you're still concerned about descending and want to level up, you

Three ways of IDing random wands you are carrying in Nethack.

A: Engrave.

B: Get zapped with one.

Quite :-)  I think Mike is referring to my saying that I found an
altar and decided to BUC-id some objects and engrave-id the wand.
It's indeed the case that if I have an uncritical game I don't do
every sensible action immediately; that's just for my playing
convenience. For example I carry scrolls of enchant armor/weapon
with me and don't use them, I carry rings and don't pet-test them
immediately, etc. etc. Most of my objects are identified, though,
just single objects may temporarily be of unknown state or type.
The one unidentified wand (of wishing) I picked up just recently,
and I got it (AFAMS) *after* the encounter with that troll.

Well, in the early game I generally don't use scrolls of enchant

I save the enchant weapon for artifacts that I want to keep, and enchant

Yeah, actually, let me chime in here.  I wasn't kidding when I said you
were a good player -- I know a lot of players who die in that situation,
rather than bail out while the bailing's good.

&gt; Heh. Who would've thought. That's the RNG taunting you for calling it
&gt; biased.

I've always said that the RNG is actually on _our_ side -- look at all
the items and equipment it gives us throughout the game, as well as all
the random Archons it DOESN'T generate.

There's been a tag on the Spork idea page forever about &quot;nightmare
mode&quot;.  It sits there because I don't really have a good idea of how to
best implement this, but the idea is basically to show the player what
it'd look like with a _mean_ RNG... ie. any roll that would be exactly
the minimum needed to hit would miss instead, etc., etc.  The player
would enter it much like Explore mode, and it would of course be
nonreturnable.

It's a lot harder to actually implement than it is to talk about, sadly,
and probably even harder to do _properly_.  But it's a nice idea.  :)

Because engraving with a wand of lightning blinds you.
Of course, you can engrave the E-word thus greatly reducing the bad effect
of being blind.

I usually engrave-test my wands asap for a lot of reasons, including BoH
accidents, permanent Elbereth, random WoW/WoDeath, effective ranged weapon.
I generally just wait to be at reasonably full health and in a corridor.
The former because of create monster, the latter because I'm playing
Slash'em and it has the nasty create horde...

Being blind is indeed a condition that demands some carefulness, but as
those conditions go, it's among the easiest. It can be cured by the horn, a
spell, a food item and prayer. It is less relevant the more non-vision
means of locating monsters you have. It is even an advantage when you have
telepathy, which most characters get long before they encounter unicorns.
Plus, only one wand can blind you when engrave testing, and it belongs to
the group of wands that monsters will zap, thus it might well already be
identified.

All in all, the benefit of knowing your wands far outweigs the risk of
blinding.

You seem to agree.

CM is another slight danger, but having an escape route open and being
reasonably healthy should suffice. 22 times in 23, only one
(level-appropriate) monster will be summoned, which shouldn't be a problem
at all. In the other cases, E-word and running away should save you. Doing
it in a corridor might even be a bad idea, since monsters will be summoned
on both sides, obstructing your escape.
