'Twas doon by the inch o' Abbots
Oor Johnny walked one day
When he saw a sicht that troubled him
Far more than he could say
A fanatic muslim bastard
Wiz doin what he'd planned
And intae Glesca's departure hall
A Cherokee he'd rammed.
A big Glaswegian polis
Came forward tae assist
He thocht &quot;a wumman driver&quot;
Or at least someone half-pissed
But to his shock nae drunken Jock
Emerged to grasp his hand
But a flamin Arab loony
Frae Al Qaeda's band
The mad Islamist nut-case
Had set hissel' on fire
And swung oot at the polis
GBH his clear desire
Now that's no richt wur Johnny cried
And sallied tae the fray
A left hook and a heid butt
Required tae save the day.
Now listen up Bin Laden
Yir sort's nae wanted here
For imported English radicals
Us Scoatsman huv nae fear
Oor hame grown Glesca Asians
Will have nae bluidy truck
So tak yer worldwide jihad
An get yersel tae F***

&gt; &amp; finally, two quotes from aneye-witness.........john smeaton (these are

&gt; real)

&gt; John just surpassed himself on the National ITV news.
&gt; The interviewer asked

&gt; &quot;What message do you have for the bombers&quot; -
&gt; he replied &quot;This is Glasgow we'll just set about you&quot;

&gt; John done an interview on cnn and they asked
&gt; how he restrained the guy and he said

&gt; &quot;me and other folk were just tryin 2 get the boot in and some other guy
&gt; banjoed him&quot; !
