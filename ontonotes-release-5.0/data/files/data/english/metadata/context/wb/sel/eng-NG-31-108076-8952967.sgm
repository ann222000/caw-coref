I understand that I'm in the virtual company of the biggest collection of
badasses the world has ever known.  I know that I am in the company of
badasses, due to the number of times my esteemed comrades have announced
themselves as badasses.  This is usually a reliable indicator on the richter
scale of badness.

Now, to my question: as a member of the badass class, what do your martial
arts skills do for you or allow you to do, that you couldn't do with just
your innate badness?

For instance, those of you who legally carry guns, what would become of your
badness if your gun was stripped away?  Might it accidently snag on your
badness and carry that off, too?

What is the difference between my gran holding a .45 and one of your
badasses?  I say this in all seriousness, as although a .45 has bit of a
kick, my gran has strong wrists and well toned forearms due to many years
practise in the ancient art of crochet.  I don't even want to mention the
amount of damage she could do with a knitting needle.  It's enough to make
your eyes water.

So, what's the difference?  Do you just put up with any shit from anybody
big and ugly enough to cause your little knees to knock?  What are you like
without a weapon, or if similarly armed but outnumbered?  Does having
martial arts skills mean you no longer need stones?  Are you only a badass
when you have a weapon?

You begin by asking &quot;what do martial arts skills do for you&quot; then
inexplicably veer off into some sort of muddled rant about badasses
and what they would do without weapons. You seem to juxtapose martial
arts skill, which can't be removed, with weapons, which can.

I'll begin by answering your original question. Martial arts skill
allows me to speak on the subject of martial arts from a relatively
informed perspective. Unlike yourself, who has none and can't either.

Now allow me to ask some questions:

This post is orders of magnitude dumber than your usual provocative
bullshit. Are you a) abusing some substance b) suffering from some
neurological trauma (stroke, brain tumor, early onset alzhiemers) or
c) jealous of all the other trolls on the board and willing to discard
any credibility, however tenous, to garner the attention you crave?

What (on the off chance that you've actually trained at all in some
martial art) does martial art skill do for *you*? You've made claim to
badass status as much as anyone on this board and more than many. How
do you see yourself as in any way different? Why are you unable to
answer your question for yourself?

As far as I can tell, your sole purpose on this board is to provoke
the enmity of martial artists. What is the nature of the thrill you
derive from that? What hole in your soul is filled when you receive a
shitty response? What do you feel you've accomplished in the time it
took to post that was worth more than what you would have
accomplished, say, washing the dishes?

Personally, I believe this is the only sparring you've ever done or
ever will do. That's just me.

Actually, I think the rant was quite concise.  If your training is soley
predicated on your having a weapon and that is removed, then yes, your
martial arts skill is also removed.  I'm just getting a picture of people as
sitting ducks, without a weapon.

Crave attention from who, men?  Hardly any women post here, so that most be

What bullshit. Every reg here has stated in one way or another what art they
practice. New posters often introduce themselves with a little info...it's a bit

You however have assiduously avoided stating what art or arts you putatively
practice, and I believe I know why.

You don't want anyone calling you on what you do. You don't want to have to

Every art has its weaknesses, or perhaps more accurately, areas of
non-specification.

Considering you have acquired the amazing ability to:

a) kill skilled knife-wielding assailants (in your kill-zone)

b) learn this skill with less than frequent practice

and

c) learn this skill using rubber knives

it seems only fair that you disclose what incredible martial art you study, so we
may all follow in your Batman-like footsteps.

I haven't avoided anything.  I've already been asked and I've already said.
I started by listing the arts I've studied and I've informed you of aspects
of my study.  It's not as if no-one knows about such a post, as I've
conversed with this group, in regards to that.  I initially called what I
did MMA, then was told that my training methods did not meet the criteria to
be regarded as such, therefore I should be called an eclectic martial
artist.  If you persist in this lie, I'll pull up the posts, and you're

Yeah, pull up the posts. Pull up the posts where you give concrete
answers.

You are a fraud. You pretend that you don't care what anyone else
thinks, but you go to extravagant lengths to pile up the bullshit.

You are a puppy who offers up vagueries by not defining what you mean

Yes, you're quite correct. I recently asked Hal why he didn't post any ma-related
stuff at all, and his response was that we're all at war so political comments
are somehow his 'martial' contribution.

I assume that when the US eventually pulls out of Iraq, Hal leaves rm-a.

fight.I used to always lose.now 99% of men are no prob.

I never put up with shit.i come off as meek and am hassled once or
twice a month, i always call people on it.and they always back
down.every single time.Frankly, it barely occurs to me even as i say
&quot;sir, may i interject that youre being an idiot?&quot; that they might now
even back down.someday i'll probably get my ass kicked, cause i so
badly know theyll cjhicken out cause the last 100 guys did.
I mean you know how in westerns and shit the guy sez &quot;what if i dont
back down?&quot; and the hero sez&quot; we'll see what happens&quot; or &quot;i dont know
what ill do, because youll back down&quot; and you think it's fake and the
heroes being cool.but really honestly, i never even think about what
id do if they dont back down.i havent thought about it in years.and
whats weird is im such a softspoken googy looking dude.i was shocked
when i learnmed to figyt and the first few chickened out.but now i
know it will happen.
Ive had one three occasions that come to mind groups of guys chiken
out.Two were youngish, like late teens early 20's, and one said theyd
get me outside, but when i went out a minute latter they were gone.
But it is totally true that bullies do not seem to want
confrontation.This big dangerous looking gentelman in what was the
combat zone boston asked me for money.i said &quot;no&quot; in a nasty way.he
was comically huge, called me a bitch and said &quot;ill see yout outside&quot;
i finish my coke, walk out.stare eye to eye with him.stop.he doesnt
look scared at all, almost bored.but he turns around and walk off.
Men are pussies.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, it's difficult to see how words on a screen lead to such a

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For instance, if I told you that I was going to burn your house
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; down,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they are only words on a screen.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When did this happen to you? Who posted it? What was the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The point is moot, as you fail to see how words on a screen could
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; satisfy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the critera for the auther being a 'thug'.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I didn't think it had really happened. Remember when you said, &quot;I'm
&gt;&gt; &gt; not a thug and I don't lie.&quot;?

&gt;&gt; &gt; I just caught you in a lie.

&gt;&gt; No, asshole, I don't lie, so there can be none for you to catch me out

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I understand that I'm in the virtual company of the biggest collection of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; badasses the world has ever known.  I know that I am in the company of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; badasses, due to the number of times my esteemed comrades have announced
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; themselves as badasses.  This is usually a reliable indicator on the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; richter
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; scale of badness.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Now, to my question: as a member of the badass class, what do your
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; martial
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; arts skills do for you or allow you to do, that you couldn't do with just
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your innate badness?

&gt; &gt; &gt; fight.I used to always lose.now 99% of men are no prob.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Makes me a living too.Gives me a hobby, makes my bloodpressure
&gt; &gt; &gt; great.So ill probably live alot longer.

&gt; &gt; Ok, some reasonable side benefits.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And it lets me communicate with wonderful people such as yourself.

&gt; &gt; Ah, there we go.  That should make it all worthwhile.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; For instance, those of you who legally carry guns, what would become of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; badness if your gun was stripped away?  Might it accidently snag on your
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; badness and carry that off, too?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; What is the difference between my gran holding a .45 and one of your
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; badasses?  I say this in all seriousness, as although a .45 has bit of a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; kick, my gran has strong wrists and well toned forearms due to many years
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; practise in the ancient art of crochet.  I don't even want to mention the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; amount of damage she could do with a knitting needle.  It's enough to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; make
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your eyes water.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So, what's the difference?  Do you just put up with any shit from anybody
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; big and ugly enough to cause your little knees to knock?  What are you
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; without a weapon, or if similarly armed but outnumbered?  Does having
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; martial arts skills mean you no longer need stones?  Are you only a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; badass
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; when you have a weapon?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I never put up with shit.i come off as meek and am hassled once or
&gt; &gt; &gt; twice a month, i always call people on it.and they always back
&gt; &gt; &gt; down.every single time.Frankly, it barely occurs to me even as i say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;sir, may i interject that youre being an idiot?&quot; that they might now
&gt; &gt; &gt; even back down.someday i'll probably get my ass kicked, cause i so
&gt; &gt; &gt; badly know theyll cjhicken out cause the last 100 guys did.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean you know how in westerns and shit the guy sez &quot;what if i dont
&gt; &gt; &gt; back down?&quot; and the hero sez&quot; we'll see what happens&quot; or &quot;i dont know
&gt; &gt; &gt; what ill do, because youll back down&quot; and you think it's fake and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; heroes being cool.but really honestly, i never even think about what
&gt; &gt; &gt; id do if they dont back down.i havent thought about it in years.and
&gt; &gt; &gt; whats weird is im such a softspoken googy looking dude.i was shocked
&gt; &gt; &gt; when i learnmed to figyt and the first few chickened out.but now i
&gt; &gt; &gt; know it will happen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ive had one three occasions that come to mind groups of guys chiken
&gt; &gt; &gt; out.Two were youngish, like late teens early 20's, and one said theyd
&gt; &gt; &gt; get me outside, but when i went out a minute latter they were gone.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But it is totally true that bullies do not seem to want
&gt; &gt; &gt; confrontation.This big dangerous looking gentelman in what was the
&gt; &gt; &gt; combat zone boston asked me for money.i said &quot;no&quot; in a nasty way.he
&gt; &gt; &gt; was comically huge, called me a bitch and said &quot;ill see yout outside&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; i finish my coke, walk out.stare eye to eye with him.stop.he doesnt
&gt; &gt; &gt; look scared at all, almost bored.but he turns around and walk off.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Men are pussies.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Like 95% I guess anyways.it's weird.

&gt; &gt; Ok, that was interesting.  But surely you aren't the only badass in the
&gt; &gt; newsgroup.  Where are the others?  Are they in hiding; too busy watching
&gt; &gt; fight clips?  Speak now, or forever hold your codpieces in shame!

&gt; What's your definition of 'badass', Wayne?

You said that you didn't see how words on a screen could qualify someone as
a thug, I gave you an example of words on a screen and your subsequent
question took for granted that words on a screen could indeed qualify
someone as a thug, thereby proving my point.

It is down to your stupidity and inability of your brain to process two
ideas in parrallel, that you've come to think that my presentation of a
hypothetical case qualifies as a statement of what happened.  It is clear
that any thought you have, has to travel single-file through your calcified
brain, any other thought having to wait in a que.  It is therefore
understandable that once your false assumption started on it's journey, we
see a shutdown of any other processing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; curiosity, yet revel in and even beg for &quot;new lines&quot;, which I take to
&gt;&gt; &gt; mean better insults? Would it please you if I make up some improbably
&gt;&gt; &gt; vile vignette involving your mother and all the posters on this board?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Is that what this is all about for you? Because it surely has nothing
&gt;&gt; &gt; to do with martial arts.

&gt;&gt; It's a transparent ploy to attempt to emulate my obvious intelligence by
&gt;&gt; spouting pseudo-intellectual fluff.

&gt; Is spouting pseudo-intellectual fluff what makes your intelligence

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It's your word, Wayne-o.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Read your original post.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't need to, I can remember what I wrote.  You wrote the word,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;buffoon&quot;.  I guess that would be your word.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My word for you.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No thanks.  You keep it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You've certainly lived up to it in *this* thread.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; An accusation based soley on malice does not carry the weight of one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; supported by evidence, no matter how much you wish it to be otherwise.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I told you before and I meant it, Wayne, that I bear you no enmity.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Only the curiosity that I'd have for an unusually distastful smell.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Where is that coming from?&quot;

&gt;&gt; Some of you people really are like The Borg.  One of you starts up with
&gt;&gt; some
&gt;&gt; new weird shit and it spreads.

&gt; Awww, should we stick to the same old shit so as not to tax you?

&gt; Whine, whine, whiney, whine, whine.

I think you've had enough.  They should have stopped serving you long ago.

You've even managed drag Trav down to your low standards.  He's usually able

&gt; What's your definition of 'badass', Wayne?

Due to the fact that my definition appears to me to be considerably
different from the impression I get of others' definition of it, I'll hold
onto my thoughts, for now.  I have no intention of having others modify
their statements, in light of my own, as I feel is inevitable, if I disclose
mine first .

If all of that is a fair characterisation of my general behaviour, you
should have no trouble discrediting me.  As it is, the consensus is shifting
to a more balanced view, away from the rabid, indoctrinated, trite
propoganda which yourself and certain others have been trying to ram down
people's throats.  You are losing.

&gt; &gt; You said certain people on this board were thugs. I asked you to

&gt; &gt; to realize has nothing to do with how you've classified anyone on this
&gt; &gt; board as a thug, since it never happened.

&gt; You said that you didn't see how words on a screen could qualify someone as
&gt; a thug, I gave you an example of words on a screen and your subsequent
&gt; question took for granted that words on a screen could indeed qualify
&gt; someone as a thug, thereby proving my point.

So, as the above quoted clearly shows, you cuntishly evaded my initial
request for clarification of who on this board you consider to be
thugs and why. Instead, you decided to attack my scepticism that
shittalk on a message board could constitute thuggish behavior. An
amatuerish attempt at a bait and switch because you're more
comfortable asking the questions than answering them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is down to your stupidity and inability of your brain to process two

Wait, did you just &quot;get mean&quot; and &quot;thug&quot; me just then?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; That's exactly what you do.  You start a fight, then whine when you get

&gt; &gt; I would think you'd be the first one to deride the notion that an
&gt; &gt; exchange of words on an internet forum is remotely a &quot;fight&quot;.

&gt; Buy a dictionary, you dunce!

Go train, you fraud.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; But like
&gt; &gt; I said, this is the only sparring you ever do, and I'm sure it means a

&gt; Words cannot constitute a fight, but they can constitute sparring?  When the

Verbal sparring is a phrase that's familiar to me. &quot;Fighting&quot; is what
mommy and daddy did before I learned the word &quot;argue.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; As for me, I'm not fighting, whining or being beat.

&gt; That's an interesting statement.  Usually it's made after someone has taken
&gt; a good beating.

Did you see someone take a good beating somewhere? Because you sure
didn't deliver it yourself. A beating is self evident; you don't need
to make pronouncements like &quot;You start a fight, then whine when you
get
beat.  I don't whine, I warn.  I'm good at fighting.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't whine, I warn.  I'm good at fighting.

&gt; &gt; Bwahahahaha! That's as good as &quot;I thug thugs&quot; and &quot;I don't get mad, I
&gt; &gt; get mean&quot;.

&gt; I think so, too.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You wish I were like you, so that you wouldn't have to continually
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; demean
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no effect.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What's demeaning about exploring your motivation for being a douche?

&gt; &gt;&gt; You see me as a jet of cleansing water?  Is that what you're thinking, as
&gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; piss all over you?

&gt; &gt; No fool! That's what I think as you piss all over yourself! I'm dry as
&gt; &gt; a bone.

&gt; Nah, only bent folk such as yourself have the ability to piss all over
&gt; themselves.  You remind me of a cab driver who deliberately cut me up in the
&gt; street and thought it was funny.  He called me a bitch as he drove away,
&gt; wiping away two throatfuls of flem from his face.
