You know, there is something to be said about a private, moderated
site.  Just a thought.

No one said you can't speak your drivel, Postal.  But the First
Amendment does not guarantee you a forum, or the right to impose your
views on a private group.  Those who wish not to read your bile are
&quot;free&quot; to go to a private, moderated site.

Guarantee a forum?  How's this Dimple Dong....&quot;Don't Read It!&quot;
You stupid Ass, have you no check on your appetite? Strap.

Impose my views? Am I playing some Mind Controlling game here
where you don't have access to your own decisionmaking.

Free to go to a private, moderated site? Go ahead. Don't let
the door hit you on your way out. You Fuckstick!

Your almost as big a pussy as busk, fvicar and some of the
other retarded rubber heads on here.

I'm stayin'! So get used to it!

I've been here longer than most of you others, even that fence walker
Michael Schey who doesnt have the gonads to stand up for himself,
instead he quivers because he's afraid to deal with any kind of
conflict.
