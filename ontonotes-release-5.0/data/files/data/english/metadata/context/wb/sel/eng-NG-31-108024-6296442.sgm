Last weekend I made my normal recipe of WW SD bread.  Normally I use a very large bowl and let the dough rise until it fills the bowl to the top before kneading or punching down for the next rise.  This time I let the dough barely double then punched down and let it go thru a 2nd rise allowing it to only double in volume.  Then put it in it's pans for the final rise.  The bread is much more flavorful and milder tasting (which I prefer).

Normally my bread has a sour flavor that gets stronger as the bread stays at room temp during the week, but this bread has been mild tasting all week.

Basically, it appears that I have been allowing the bread to rise too much before punching down.  I think there is definitely a difference between sour dough flavor and flavor that comes from allowing it to rise too long before punching down/kneading for the next rise.

I am still learning after only one year of baking SD bread!

You might also play with higher inoculation of starter and letting it
rise the same as before. You might get similar results but less dense
bread. Or it might not work that way - play with it. If you're in the
mood also try different proofing temperatures - higher temperatures
proof faster and might have less sour (or might not).

Don't knock the super sour or you'll be attacked by jealous hordes that
tear their hair out for that ultimate sour. I'm with you though.

Oh, probably the biggest factor in your very sour WW bread is that WW
has a lot of mineral content which buffers the acid. If you can
compromise by cutting it with white flour you can adjust the sourness
that way too. I prefer slightly tangy, and I've made some WW sourdough
that was about like drinking vinegar. I gave it away to some of my more
masochistic friends and family.

Good luck!
