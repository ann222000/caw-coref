Video game lets players be immigrants

By Laura Wides-Munoz, Associated Press
MIAMI - A Japanese computer science student fails to take a full load
of university classes and loses his student visa. A 10th-grade Indian
girl is detained because of a high school essay she wrote on the
Department of Homeland Security.

These are two of the characters in ICED!- a new video game that
invites players to step into the shoes of foreigners who run afoul of
the U.S. immigration system. It is part of a burgeoning genre of video
games that examine major social and policy issues such as the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the situation in Darfur and the
Electoral College.

MORE ON THE GAME: ICED! I Can End Deportation video game

&quot;The game allows you to get into the body of a person, so you can
experience what they are going through. There are very few
opportunities to get that perspective,&quot; said Mallika Dutt, head of the
non-profit Breakthrough, which produced the game and uses new media to
highlight social issues around the world.

ICED!- a play on the acronym for the Department of Homeland Security's
Immigration and Customs Enforcement office - is scheduled to be
available for free download next month. It differs greatly from games
like Border Patrol, which popped up on the Internet last year and
exhorted players to kill illegal immigrants as they entered the
country.

ICED! seeks to show how immigration laws passed in 1996 expanded the
number of crimes that can trigger deportation and limited immigrants'
rights to appeal.

Players try to avoid deportation by keeping a low profile and
performing community service. Shoplifting or jumping a subway
turnstile loses points. Lose too many, and your character ends up in a
federal detention facility.

&quot;You can get a lot out of a game, more than from film and other media
in some ways, because you are actively engaged rather than just a
passive consumer,&quot; said Suzanne Seggerman, head of the non-profit
group Games for Change.

Barbara Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for ICE, declined to comment on the
game. ICED! gamers can become a Mexican high school graduate whose
family overstayed its visa, or a Haitian war veteran who faces
deportation when he turns to alcohol and crime after returning from
Iraq.

In the first level, players keep a low profile in a city vaguely
resembling New York. In the second level, they must navigate an
immigration detention center. Programmer Heidi Boisvert estimates the
game can take 10 to 30 minutes to play.

Boisvert and Natalia Rodriguez came up with the idea in graduate
school and approached Breakthrough about helping them develop it.
Boisvert said they didn't talk to immigration authorities, but they
did speak to immigration experts, attorneys and advocacy groups, as
well as their target audience of voting-age teens.

All of the characters they chose were based on real situations,
including the case of a 16-year-old New York girl from Guinea who was
accused of planning a suicide bombing and detained for six weeks in
2005 before the charges dropped.

Steven Camarota, head of research at the Washington-based Center for
Immigration Studies, questioned the value of a game that focuses on
individual cases rather than the complex issues surrounding
immigration. While the U.S. immigration system is flawed, it is also
one of the most generous in the world, said Camarota, whose
organization favors strict enforcement of current laws.

&quot;Any reasonable person should say your immigration system should
always be tempered with mercy and justice,&quot; he said. &quot;But it's like
anything else. What exactly do you gain by looking at a small aspect
of the debate?&quot;

Louis DeSipio, a University of California, Irvine, political science
professor and immigration expert, believes players do gain something.

&quot;It's very important, especially for younger people, to understand the
diversity of American society. It's easy to assume that everyone is
like you,&quot; he said. &quot;A game like this can show that.&quot;

But unless they want to preach solely to the converted, such games
need widespread distribution - something most non-profits like
Breakthrough lack the resources to do - and to be part of a larger
outreach campaign, he added.

That was the thinking of PeaceMaker creator Asi Burak, whose game
allows players to act as both Israeli and Palestinian leaders as they
seek to diffuse tension in the Middle East. It is one of the few such
games to be sold commercially, including on Amazon.com. Burak claims
it has sold thousands of copies in 60 countries at $20 per download.

Burak said he conceived PeaceMaker as a way to promote empathy between
the two sides. To his surprise, those who played were more excited
about finally understanding the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Even if such games can explain political and social issues, they are
only effective if they are fun to play, he cautioned.

&quot;It's like a film,&quot; he said. &quot;If it's not good, it's going to bore the
audience.&quot;.
