Dean, I know you collect all things Soul so I posted two rather rare
Canadian soul singles from 1968, which I like very much. Since I make no
claim to know anything about Soul I thought I'd post them and YOU (or
others) tell me what you think. Neither single was released in the US
and only generated interest in the Vancouver area as far as I know.
&quot;King Size&quot; seems to be still played today on Vancouver Oldies radio
since I have heard it online. But &quot;Ain't Love Wonderful&quot; is lost to
time. Fortunately I found an extremely rare mint copy in a record store
in Eastern Canada for the laughing price of 33 cents. I would have
easily paid $50 for it since it charted on my personal chart (#7) and is
therefore a &quot;must have&quot; for me. I thought they might be of interest for
you since you do a radio show. . .

&quot;Ain't Love Wonderful&quot; - Sy Risby, Chuck Flintroy &amp; The Night Train

(Charted #20 at CKLG Vancouver on April 6th, 1968)
Original single: 6th Avenue AV-601

View label from my website: http://www.colba.net/~andresk/page20.html

&quot;King Size&quot; - The Trials of Jayson Hoover

(Charted #8 at CKLG Vancouver on January 10th, 1969)
Original single: New Syndrome 5006

Posted to alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.1960s and a.b.s.m.

Swampwater??? . . . I know enough not to DRINK it!  Same with
Riverwater, Lakewater, Oceanwater, Creekwater, and Rivuletwater! . . .

Springwater is OK though. And so is Creedence Clearwater, it helps with
one's revival and quenches thirst. Down the hatch! . . .

Are you asking about the country-rock group &quot;Swampwater&quot; that did one
LP on Starday and one fold-out die-cut wood-looking Lp on RCA? That
includced Gib Gibleau, future Burrito Brother? The same group that was
Linda Ronstadt's backup band for awhile and I believe also did some
time with Arlo Gothrie...THAT SWAMPWATER?

They were actually a pretty good band. The RCA LP isn't TOO hard to
find but the Starday (their 1st) Lp I would guess to be near
impossible since I don't think it had anything more than promotional
distribution.  I never saw another copy save the one I had in 30 years
of working in record stores.  Now I have to go check to see if it is
listed anywhere.

Is this the same band? I think I have part of this song on
tape from WLVR 91.3 FM circa 1991.

Don't know for sure and can't seem to find out because the
current volunteers at 'LVR never heard of 'Swampwater';
will have to start asking at WMUH 91.7.
