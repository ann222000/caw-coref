Sunrise always runs downstairs if the door is open and unguarded for a
split second. It was worse at the old house, where the basement was a
real basement with a furnace and pipes and lots of hidey-holes. She
would get down there and then scream to be rescued, _while hiding in a
corner or on some pipes_ When she was found, after anywhere from ten
minutes to two hours, she would always be so greatful but that begged
the question: &quot;Why do you run down here in the first place?&quot;

Our &quot;basement&quot; now is just the ground floor of the condo. It isn't
dank or nasty and there isn't nearly as much choice of hiding spots.
However, the door down is much harder to guard due to its location. So
off she goes once or twice a week. With all the open space, I just see
her and herd her up the stairs. She isn't scared of THIS basement,
however, and it is harder to get her up the stairs.

My Mingus had the same anxiety but a bit more sense about the garage.
When we moved in, we had the place piled full of boxes, and used to
go out there regularly when unpacking.  Then one day I realized I
hadn't seen Mingus for a while.  Couldn't find him anywhere.  Then
I happened to go to the garage for something and saw these two little
eyes looking back at me in the dark from the top of the boxes and
heard a pitiful meow.  He'd been in there for a bit over a day, which
meant he'd missed at least THREE MEALS.  The horror!

From then on, he would never go near it.  And when *I* went in there
he'd be following me as far as the doorstep meowing pathetically...
&quot;DON'T GO IN THERE!!!  IT'S DARK AND YOU MIGHT MISS YOUR DINNER!!!&quot;

For that to happen the diva would have to think that she had a weight
problem. Sunrise does not stand. She poses. It is very likely that she
thinks _I_ need the exercise.

No, his was quite high.  With his brother Zeke and father Ishmael
(both lower pitched), they formed a little furry male voice choir
that performed for us every dinnertime to ask for some of whatever
we were having - they could all stand on their hind legs and keep
the serenade up for an entire course.

May as well ask &quot;what's with the closet&quot; or &quot;what's with the box&quot;?  Cats
like hidey holes.  I don't have a basement but sometimes I have to hunt
Persia down... she's usually in the closet back behind my long dresses.
It's nice and dark back there.  They like the dark except when they want to
lay in the sun.  A paradox, if you will :)  I think they commune better with
the Mothership in the dark.  Sunlight just makes them want to stretch out
and take a nap.

We had a minor &quot;incident&quot; Monday.   Jake and his dignity and his ECollar
have a hidey hole under the head of our bed that is very difficult for a non
cat to access.

Camille is an inquisitive 14 week old Chihuahua who is getting bolder and
exploring the nooks and crannies.

Monday afternoon we are watching TV in the family room when Camille come
running down the hall screaming at the top of her lungs.  I pick her up and
check her over but there is no damage.  We are just deciding that she must
have found Jakes hideout when Jake saunters into the room meowing,  Telling
us, I swear, &quot;I never laid a paw on her!&quot;

Just like a couple of siblings, I swear.
