I'm after some advice please.  I came back to cycling in the spring after a
good 20 year break and I'm thoroughly enjoying myself.  I'm far healthier
and I've lost weight to boot!  Due to work etc. I'm generally out riding
after 7.00pm and, of course, it's dark now at that time.  My usual ride
splits into roughly one third local roads, one third main roads and one
third country roads / lanes.  To ensure that I'm seen, I'm using an EL-520
and an HL-500BS on the front and a TL-LD260BS and a TL-LD1100 on the rear,
all being Cateye lights.  The front lights are great until I hit the unlit
country roads, whereupon, seeing where I'm going can become a bit of
guesswork.  I'm thinking of going the rechargeable twin light route, but the
variance in wattage, battery life and cost is tremendous.  Can anybody
recommend something that should be adequate to use but will not break the
bank please?  I'm normally out for about 45 minutes to an hour at a time.

Thanks in advance,

Kevin the Lurker

These things are OK:

http://www.parker-international.co.uk/ProductDetails/mcs/productID/64...

Mine were 6W+6W instead of 10W+2.4W and were a bit cheaper I think, but
otherwise similar.

The idea of 10+2.4 is presumably that you turn it down to 2.4 when
you're going through a village with street-lights to save batteries.

But if the ride home is only 1hr then I wouldn't bother-- just give it
four hours charging every day.

Quite bulky but very bright and you can certainly see where you're going
in pitch darkness. 4/5 stars.

I would recommend these too. I've used them for 5 or 6 24hr MTB races,
and have never crashed at night!
They are nowhere near the brightest lights out there, but they are
clearly adequate for country lane use, and off-road riding - on mine I
rarely turned the 10w bulb on, as the 2.4w is fine for the speeds I do.

I've seen them for as little as £25. A spare battery can be bought from
Maplins for around £7, though the battery easily has 3 hours use on it,
probably more.

The next step up is something like the Busch and Muller Ixon, which can
be bought for use with 4 AA batteries at ~£50, or a rechargeable version
around £20 dearer at £70. Good bright light from this one, but I dont
think you'd get 2 hours from a set of Duracell betteries - NiMh
rechargables are recommended for it.

I was heading towards this type of thing anyway, so it's quite reassuring
that I'm going in the right direction.  I'd be interested to know where
you've seen the smart ones for £25 - the going rate seems to be about £50.
Again, they also do a 6W + 6W version for about the same cost - is that
overkill or would it be worthwhile?  The country lanes I use are totally
unlit.

Thanks for the help so far

Alan,

Thanks for this.  SJS Cycles have the 6W+6W on their web site for £25 as
well.  I think I will go for that.

AIUI the only difference between the 10+2.4 and the 6+6 is the bulbs
carried in the lights.
If you want these lights then I would recommend buying the cheapest
option, and then buying bulbs to suit, keeping the other bulbs  for spare.

I used to run a similar cateye system with 10+6, keeping a 2.4W bulb as
a spare, or for use if the battery was low.

I bought these:

http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=15442

for my commute which is about 45 minutes almost entirely on unlit
couontry roads, often with potholes. They seem to do a good job of
lighting the road ahead, plus you can switch the 10W bulb off when
going through streetlit areas to conserve battery power.

Alternatively you could get a decent battery light (think German here)
with a sensible beam shape (not a wasteful cone) e.g. Trelock LS 730
(been pleased with mine) - less than £30 delivered from www.roseversand.de
Best if you invest in a decent AA charger too: but I guess you have
already done that for all your other lights?

If you do buy these (and I've just bought my second set), it can be
worth a trip to Maplin to buy a charger like this
http://www.maplin.co.uk/module.aspx?ModuleNo=27701&amp;doy;=25m10
for 15 quid to cut the risk of overcharging the battery.  If you don't
fancy this, use the charger that comes with the lights on a timer so
you don't forget it and &quot;cook&quot; the battery.  Always unplug the battery
when it starts to fizz (just press the container of heating lead-acid
gel which is plugged into the mains to your ear...).

Folks will steal anything really. I'd take them off if I were you.  I
leave the Smart lights fitted on the bike but they are pretty
knackered and covered in tape.  I take the battery with me as I think
it is unlikely they'll just nick the lights and I usually charge the
battery at work.  Also the parking is pretty secure.  When I was
parking somewhere less secure I took the whole thing off. They slide
off the permanently fitted bracket in a jiffy.  If you buy anything
decent, I'd make this a consideration.

I'd recommend you both consider hub dynamos. Good light, don't need
recharging so you can't forget, don't run out if you're out longer than
you expected, hard to steal, price competitive with rechargeable rigs.
