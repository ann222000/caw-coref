If you're like me, the sight of Pat Leahy, Dick Durbin, Carl Levin, and, yes, John McCain going on about &amp;quot;torture&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the moral high ground&amp;quot; is enough to make you spew like Linda Blair with a bad case of food poisoning. Journalist Mark Bowden , author of Black Hawk Down and Guests of the Ayatollah , knows a thing or two about &amp;quot;the dark art of interrogation&amp;quot; and Islamic extremism, and has concluded that it would have been immoral to refrain from waterboarding the likes of al-Qaeda creep Abu Zubaydah. Bowden's argument is unanswerable and should be tattooed word for word on the backside of the Lindsey Grahams of the world with a dull needle:

No one should be prosecuted for waterboarding Abu Zubaydah.

Several investigations are under way to find out who ordered the destruction of CIA interrogation videotapes, apparently an effort to cover up evidence of torture. Leaving aside for a moment the wisdom of destroying the tapes, I'd like to take a look at what was allegedly done to Zubaydah, and why.

When captured in Pakistan in 2002, Zubaydah was one of the world's most notorious terrorists. The 31-year-old Saudi had compiled in his young life 37 different aliases and was under a sentence of death in Jordan for a failed plot to blow up two hotels jammed with American and Israeli tourists. The evidence was not hearsay: Zubaydah was overheard on the phone planning the attacks, which were then thwarted. He was a key planner of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, was thought to be field commander of the attack that killed 17 U.S. sailors on the USS Cole, and was involved in planning a score of other terror attacks, successful and unsuccessful. He was considered to be a primary recruiter and manager of al-Qaeda training camps.

He was, in short, a highly successful, fully engaged, career mass murderer. Think back to those pictures of workers crouched in windows high up in the burning World Trade Center towers, choosing whether to jump to their death or be burned alive. This was in part Abu Zubaydah's handiwork.

At the time of his capture in 2002, just six months after the Sept. 11 attacks, there was strong reason to believe Zubaydah knew virtually the entire organizational structure and agenda of al-Qaeda around the world. He was supervising ongoing plots to kill hundreds if not thousands of people. He was, for obvious reasons, disinclined to share this knowledge. Subjected briefly to waterboarding - less than a minute, according to published reports - he became cooperative and provided information that, according to the government, resulted in preventing planned attacks and capturing other key al-Qaeda leaders.

In the six years that have passed since the Manhattan towers collapsed, we have gained (partly through the interrogation of men like Zubaydah) a much clearer understanding of al-Qaeda and the threat it poses. While the chance of further murderous attacks is always with us, it is fair to say few of us feel the same measure of alarm we did then. The diminishment of this threat is at least in part due to the heroic efforts of the CIA, the military, and allies around the world in targeting terrorist cells.

In the process, the menace of Zubaydah himself has deflated. Today, he is just another little man in a orange jumpsuit at Guant√°namo. Our national concern has shifted from stopping him to figuring out what to do with him.

And to second-guessing what was done to him. Waterboarding is a process by which a detainee is strapped down and forced to ingest and inhale water until he experiences the terror of drowning. It is not torture in the traditional sense of inflicting pain; it inflicts fear, intense, visceral fear, without doing physical harm. It is a method calculated to straddle the definitions of coercion and torture, and as such merely proves that both methods inhabit the same slippery continuum. There is a difference between gouging out a man's eyes and keeping him awake, and waterboarding falls somewhere in between.

In the unlikely event that Zubaydah knew nothing of value and that every bit of information he divulged was false, it was still reasonable to assume in 2002 that this was not the case. If his interrogators were able to stop one terror attack by waterboarding him, even if they violated international agreements and our national conscience, it was justified. All nations have laws against killing, but all recognize self-defense as a legitimate excuse. I think the waterboarding in this case is directly analogous, except that Zubaydah himself, although he richly deserves it, was neither killed nor permanently harmed.

I can understand why someone at the CIA ordered the videotapes destroyed. It was both to protect those who did it (more from their own government, I suspect, than from terrorist reprisals) and to prevent the images from ever becoming public. We have seen the disastrous, self-defeating consequences of such pictures, which untethered from context assume a damaging life of their own. Whoever made the call now runs the risk of being prosecuted for obstruction of justice, a risk I am sure was evaluated before making the choice.

Here's where the issue gets confusing. No information gained by coercive methods ought to be admissible, ever, in a trial or tribunal. Torture can be used to twist (the word torture literally means &amp;quot;to twist&amp;quot;) testimony in any desired direction. The goal of any criminal proceeding is justice, and torture produces only the kind perfected during the Inquisition.

The goal of an intelligence operation in wartime, on the other hand, is to elicit accurate, timely information to thwart attacks. In this setting, interrogation is a process, one in which a prisoner is rewarded for the truth, and punished for lying. It is designed to save lives and ensure the success of a military operation. Coercive methods are rarely necessary. Most often, prisoners can be induced to cooperate by being nice to them. There are many other interrogation methods proven to be useful that do not require so much as raising one's voice. But there will always be hard cases like Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheik Mohammed, another mastermind of Sept. 11. With prisoners like these, defiant and dangerous, the only right question to ask is, What works?

What does work? Opponents of torture argue that it never works, that it always produces false information. If that were so, then this would be a simple issue, and the whole logic of incentive/disincentive is false, which defies common sense. In one of the cases I have cited previously, a German police captain was able to crack the defiance of a kidnapper who had buried a child alive simply by threatening torture (the police chief was fired, a price any moral individual would gladly pay). The chief acted on the only moral justification for starting down this road, which is to prevent something worse from happening. If published reports can be believed, this is precisely what happened with Zubaydah.

People can be coerced into revealing important, truthful information. The German kidnapper did, Zubaydah did, and prisoners have throughout recorded time. What works varies for every individual, but in most cases, what works is fear, fear of imprisonment, fear of discomfort, fear of pain, fear of bad things happening to you, fear of bad things happening to those close to you. Some years ago in Israel, in the course of investigating this subject exhaustively, I interviewed Michael Koubi, a master interrogator who has questioned literally thousands of prisoners in a long career with Shin Bet. He said that the prisoner who resisted noncoercive methods was rare, but in those hard cases, fear usually produced results. Fear works better than pain.

It is an ugly business, and it is rightly banned. The interrogators who waterboarded Zubaydah were breaking the law. They knew they were risking their careers and freedom. But if the result of the act itself was a healthy terrorist with a bad memory vs. a terror attack that might kill hundreds or even thousands of people, it is a good outcome. The decision to punish those responsible for producing it is an executive one. Prosecutors and judges are permitted to weigh the circumstances and consider intent.

Which is why I say that waterboarding Zubaydah may have been illegal, but it wasn't wrong.

Rog,

I have read in more than one source that Abu Zubaydah, although a major league creep, was a bush league operative who greatly exagerrated his importance and involvement and I have no idea which is true. Do you?

Meanwhile, to say that waterboarding isn't torture not only sounds sounds stupid but also is stupid. It isn't simulated drowning. It is actual drowning. If you waterboard a person enough, you will kill him. Killing someone isn't the end of waterboarding as dead men tell no tales. Whether we should commit torture to obtain information is another issue.

One last thought, if waterboarding isn't torture, what is your working definition of torture?

Neither I nor Bowden claim waterboarding isn't torture. But it's good torture. A good old-fashioned waterboarding session can provide a refreshing interlude in an otherwise boring day, particularly if the right brand of bottled water is used.

Tony,

if waterboarding is drowning, why bother with the term waterboarding ?

D,

I am an egalatarian at heart and possessed of a well w/ good water so tap water would suffice for me. I can appreciate, however, how al Qaeda operatives would attempt to shun city water given its chlorination, which we know is a Communist plot. Still, employing Perrier, Evian, or even Poland Spring seems like a waste sio I say, use tap water or pehaps the filtered stuff.

Mark,

It's called waterboarding b/c we don't drown them. We stop in an attempt to persuade them to speak.
If we kept it up though, drown they would.

Tony, there is no poisonous substance, only toxic doses of everything. Water is necessary for life but too much can drown you, of course, or kill you by electrolyte disruption. Too much oxygen kills you. 45 seconds to a minute and a half waterboarding is not torture, in my opinion. 30 minutes of it is. You can put saran wrap over the face of the guy so that no water goes in his nose or mouth and the feeling of drowning is just as strong as with no saran wrap. So it's not actual drowning after all, just an autonomic reaction. In Vietnam, they handcuffed the guy behind his back, put him on his back and put a wet handkerchief over his face. Did exactly the same thing. Shutting me up in a dark box would be the worst torture I can imagine, even for a few minutes; it probably would cause you guys to yawn.
