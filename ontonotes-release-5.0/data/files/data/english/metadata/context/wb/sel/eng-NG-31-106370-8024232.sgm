Cop shoots at snake, kills boy, 5

NOBLE, Oklahoma (AP) -- A police officer shooting at a snake apparently
killed a 5-year-old boy who was fishing at a nearby pond, officials said.

Austin Haley was fishing with his grandfather, Jack Tracy, when Tracy
said he heard a shot and saw something hit the water just a few feet in
front of the boat dock where he was standing. Moments later, a second
shot hit Austin in the head.

A Noble police officer who had responded to a report of a snake in a
tree apparently fired the deadly shot while trying to kill the snake on
Friday, City Manager Bob Wade said.

(snip)

Wade refused to identify the officer but said the person had been placed
on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

Tracy has little doubt. &quot;I'm not saying the cop shot him on purpose,&quot; he
said. &quot;But let me tell you -- if I had a kid and put him in this car and
didn't put him in a car seat and he got killed on the way to town,
they'd charge me with murder ... and what this cop did is a lot worse
than that.

No - if you or I did this, we'd be charged by that same cop with a
felony.  Talk about the &quot;double standards&quot; that have alienated even

Noble OK is in Cleveland Country the DA of Cleveland (and several
neighboring counties that make up district 21) is Greg Mashburn. The
District attorneys office number is (405) 366-0269. He's elected so unless
he thinks you are a local resident he probably doesn't care what you think.

Same scenario. Coraliville, IA cop wanted to shoot coon in a
steel dumpster outside our complex. I stopped him advising him
the bullet could stray or reflect back even killing him! The moron
told me to stop interfering and go inside and mind my own business. Two more
squad cars pulled in to help in the RACOON EMERGENCY! I came back out and
told the Sgt what his cop was about to do, the Sgt walked over and stopped
his fellow cop
from killing himself.

The cop in question is the same &quot;kid&quot; I used to send home for throwing rocks
at fellow kids in my neighborhood! This fellow
is no longer a Coralville policeman ...... thank God!

If you or I did this, the cops would bury us under the jail for
negligent homicide, while the boy's family sued us for everything we have.

Watch what happens to the cop.  A little paid vacation while the anger
fades away, then reinstatement in his position.  And if he's sued, the
PD will pay the bill.

You no doubt recognize the similarities between Noble OK Ctiy Manager
Bob Hale protecting the man who killed Austin Haley and the protection
ICPD Officer Jeffrey Gillaspie received from  Iowa City City Manager Steve
Atkins, Johnson County Attorney J. Patrick White, Iowa Attorney General Tom
Miller and ICPD Chief R.J. Winklehake.

http://www.bobthompson.org/miscellanea/shaw.htm

Tom Miller was the experienced hand in the matter having previously protected
Iowa State Trooper Gregory Cox from prosecution after Cox killed an unarmed,
non threatening civilian.

Indeed.  I'm surprised the cops didn't put a &quot;throw-down&quot; gun next to

Apart from the incredible recklessness of the officer, there's one other
thing I don't understand -- don't the police down there have shotguns in
their cars?  He might have actually hit the snake, and even if he'd
missed, the kid would still be alive.

A shotgun, while better than his pistol, is still overkill for that
situation.  The story reported they tried several ways to dislodge the
snake, and it wouldn't budge.  This suggests they had some time, the
snake was not an immediate threat, and they could have sent another
officer a few minutes down the road to pick up some snake shot.  The
snake shot would have 1) Likely allowed the cop to hit the snake,
assuming he'd ever handled a firearm at all in the past, 2) likely not
cleared the lake &amp; 3) been near harmless to anyone it hit.  Firing
standard rounds in that situation was reckless to begin with, and
unfortunately fatal in this case.

We do not know, and have no reason to think, they were standard
rounds.  All we know for sure is that Noble City Manager Bob
Wade is circling the wagons to protect the killer.  The ammo
could just as easily be deadly hollow point rounds or windshield
piercing &quot;tactical&quot; rounds.
