Is there a quick way to roast a turkey?

Somehow I spent more on groceries than the needed amount during the
specified period at one supermarket to earn a free turkey. The one that
was picked up for me is 15 pounds. This creates a problem.

(Please note that I am not planning to roast this turkey _on_
Thanksgiving. It was picked up this afternoon, so it won't defrost in
time. This is OK, as Thanksgiving was never a marquee holiday for me.)

The USDA says that at 325º it will take 3 3/4 to 4 1/4 hours to roast.
However, my attendant is here for at most six hours a day. Also, he
doesn't work alternate weekends, and so won't be here this weekend. The
agency still doesn't have a permanent assignment for the alternate
weekends yet, meaning they use fill-ins, who may or may not be able to
give me the full six hours per day I'm eligible for.

So if the turkey takes longer than the USDA recommended roasting time,
or if the aide isn't here for a full shift, I have a problem.

Is there a faster way to cook a turkey?

A local supermarket is heavily advertising a way to roast a turkey in
two hours (less for a 15-lb. bird), but it calls for a V-shaped rack for
the turkey to sit on while it's in the roasting pan, which I don't have.
The market is selling a kit with everything needed but the turkey, but
at $25 it defeats the purpose of getting the free turkey. (It also calls
for an oven temperature of 475º and recommends thoroughly cleaning the
oven the day before so nothing bursts into flames. This is unsettling.)

Dom, if you don't stuff it, it will roast much faster.  A 15-lb turkey
should be done in 2.5 hours or so.

350º is fine and a 15 pound bird (unstuffed, I am guessing), would not
take anywhere near 4+ hours anyway, unless you plan on using it to
re-sole shoes.

They say 3.5 hrs at 325. I say go for 350, but tent the sucker.

In fact, the whole site may be helpful for you.

Only other solution is to wait until Monday, when you get a regular,
full 6 hr aide, so you needn't worry.

Hmm...what about Friday? You have a regular or fill-in?

I been around, after AOL closed all of their USA call centers I had to
look for work, which took a while. Once I started looking, the looking
took a while too. Finally, in desperation, I took a customer service job
for Verizon Wireless in what must be the hugest call center ever, CS has
nearly 2 acres of pods. Their tech floor is nearly as big. I get a
discount on wireless internet though, that's pretty cool.

I still want a biology job, I took a test for APHIS PPQ, and got an 87 on
it, which apparently is pretty good, now all I have to do is wait for an
opening.

I've still been looking after my friend, her kid is 2 1/2 now, and a true
delight and joy. She had another one a couple months ago... he sleeps a
lot, and cries a little bit, and likes to sit up and look around, but
isn't big enough to sit up by himself.

Nothing really prevents you from cutting the turkey into pieces. That

Damn. See, this is what I *wish* for - a life where a 15 pound turkey would
last  8 weeks. I have a 22 pound turkey, and I'm thinking of ways to hide a
little bit of the white meat in the back of the fridge somewhere so I can
have a sandwich on Friday.

With Paul in the house, I'm quite sure there will be no evidence of
Thanksgiving food come Friday. There might be a bunch of turnip left over -
but only because he doesn't like turnip. But other than that, I'm sure we
will be leftover free.

Malone? I'm guessing about 2057.

I think you're more likely to get internet service through your power

Uh, markings showing people who excavate where utilities are buried would

In Toronto the people who do these markings always use spray paint.
Different utilities generally use different colors and each type of

Yes, I have seen those flags, usually marking gas lines when
construction is about to begin.  My cable company/Internet provider,
though, did not bury their fiber optics in this town, but ran them
pole to pole as the electric and phone lines and I don't expect
Verizon will do anything different. So save your &quot;uh,&quot; because they
won't dig up where I live, nor anywhere in this town except in a new
development where they have buried phone and electric lines.

There are flags, paint and stakes used at times,  as well as lots of
permanent signs along roadways that say  &quot;Call before you dig&quot; and
often have an ideogram of a crossed out shovel as well as a phone
number.

http://pseg.com/customer/town/damage/images/SignChannel3.JPG

http://www.dasmanufacturing.com/locate/gas.html

In many places in NJ, both gas and electric is provided by the same
company, although there are several companies that provide dual
service. I have seen flags from them along major road re-construction
sites. If only paving is being done - at least in residential areas in
my town - spray paint of different colors  is used on the existing
pavement to indicate where sewer, water or gas lines are.

They use flags here (fl.us).   Well, not universally; I've seen paint
too, if the thing involves digging through the street.  Surveyors use
plastic ribbon on stakes.  Somebody ties plastic ribbon around trees
to remove (for e.g. road widening).

This summer in Burnaby, a city contractor doing road work whacked an
underground crude oil pipeline with a backhoe. There was a huge fountain
of crude and a really bad mess in the (residential) neighbourhood. The
cause boiled down to an argument about whether the contractor had just
dug in the wrong place, or whether the pipeline company-provided map --
as the city claimed -- showed the pipeline to be 12 feet or more from
its actual location. Lawsuits have been filed.

Sure -- and then anyone who excavates for some other reason has to know
where to find them.

I haven't seen a water main installed in front of my house (built 1924),
but I have seen a gas main installed.  A few years ago they replaced the
existing metal gas mains in our neighborhood with new plastic ones.
They're supposed to be more durable, but they're also obviously more
vulnerable to impact, so I was surprised how shallowly they laid the
new main under my front lawn -- I didn't think to actually measure it,
but I think less than a foot down.

When we moved to Connecticut 34 years ago, more than half
the homes in the state had their own wells and on-site
septic systems. Even now there are many developments being
built which rely on wells and on-site septic, especially
the more expensive subdivisions. Occasionally there is
an established area where some of the homes start having
problems with their well water, either quantity or quality,
and eventually a water main is extended into the area. More
common is to have a sewer main extended into an established
area.

When we sold my mother's house from her estate, the contract was
signed and the lawyers started their monthlong grind towards the sale.
We then received a notice from the city that they were going to be
installing sewer lines down her street.  There would be an $8000
assessment due about four months from that point, with an option to
pay it over two years.  (Since the assessment was clearly unknown to
the vendors, and the money wasn't due till after the sale, we were
completely off the hook.  It went through cleanly.)

The water had been in place when she moved there.

I grew up in a &quot;semi-rural&quot; town with chickens, cows, onions and
apples growing nearby.  We had a well.  City water came through in
1972 or so.  My parents had it hooked up in 1986 or so.  Some
neighborhoods &quot;grow&quot; rather than &quot;are built by a developer&quot;.

I'm thinking of (actually dithering) investing in a residential

Come to think of it, my aunt's house was on a dirt road, had well water
and no AC (in Florida!).  It has been there since I-don't-know-when, but
she was there from at least the early 70s until 1983 or so.  It probably
had no water main when she was there.  I'm pretty sure that this house
(b. 1984) had no sewer main when we moved here, as we got a septic tank
and have had no reason to change (even though sewer service is an option
now).  (No electricity either, but that was fixed in a few days.)

&gt;&gt;to look for work, which took a while. Once I started looking, the
&gt;&gt;looking took a while too. Finally, in desperation, I took a customer
&gt;&gt;service job for Verizon Wireless in what must be the hugest call
&gt;&gt;center ever, CS has nearly 2 acres of pods. Their tech floor is
&gt;&gt;nearly as big. I get a discount on wireless internet though, that's
&gt;&gt;pretty cool.

&gt; Ah, yes...life's ups and downs.  Well, maybe I'll get to talk to you
&gt; one of these days when I call Verizon Wireless to kvetch.
">

That doesn't seem likely, although we are trying to unite the 4
regions, calls are still going to be routed to the closest call center
by preference.

&gt;&gt;I still want a biology job, I took a test for APHIS PPQ, and got an
&gt;&gt;87 on it, which apparently is pretty good, now all I have to do is
&gt;&gt;wait for an opening.

&gt; Can you tie it in with the photography? If so, post some pictures of
&gt; quarantined plants.
">

I am aiming at tying it in with my degree first... Plants might be
quarantined for a variety of reasons though, such as being on an
endangered species list and not having an import permit, to being
infected, infested, or all kinds of things while at the inspection
station. (yeah, it's thanksgiving.)

&gt;&gt;I've still been looking after my friend, her kid is 2 1/2 now, and a
&gt;&gt;true delight and joy. She had another one a couple months ago... he
&gt;&gt;sleeps a lot, and cries a little bit, and likes to sit up and look
&gt;&gt;around, but isn't big enough to sit up by himself.

&gt; Ahhh...you are still keeping an eye on her...nice to hear about the
&gt; older one and your devotion, and if I remember well, your friend was
&gt; young to have the first one...goodness me, now there are two for you
&gt; to play with and three to look after!
">

She recently moved to Tucumcari, and a day later her BF was crying
because he missed her, even though he broke up with her just before she
left. I visited them yesterday when his mother brought them some
furniture. Juanito didn't want to let me go.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I must say that I was thinking of you just last week. It finally got
&gt; cold enough here that I had to bring the Joshua tree in from the back
&gt; porch to its winter home in the kitchen.  It is now a bit over 2 feet
&gt; tall and quite happy.
">

It might flower when it gets about 12 feet tall, which is also a sign
of happiness.

&gt; Ooooohhh - lucky! Is that Fios?  I want Fios internet service really

&gt; know when it might become available, would you?

Er, uh, no, it would be Verizon Wireless internet access. It is access
only, no email, no usnet, no nuffin.

Well, besides text messaging an voicemail, like I need voicemail on an
internet connection.

Oh, and Fiber optic isn't wireless, but Verizon communications and Verizon
Wireless aren't the same company either.

I plan on being more back than driving by.

I don't have a car now, and my scooter needs a new wheel. It is a Trikke,
and you generally shop for wheels 3 at a time.

&gt; So if the turkey takes longer than the USDA recommended roasting time,

&gt; Is there a faster way to cook a turkey?
">

The better way: prep it the day before, toss it into the oven at about
200 - 220 and let it go overnight.  Do it below 212 and you can
practically let it cook indefinetly.  Prep on the day involves removing
the tent of foil (put a tent of foil over it when you cook it, did I
mention that?) and turn the heat up to 400 or so for five to ten minutes
to brown the outside.  Your turkey is ready to eat whithin 20 minutes of
you deciding to do so.

Take non bendable substance.
Pass through a series of smaller holes, or heat and pull until it gets
thin.
I don't see why the resulting material can't be called a wire.
