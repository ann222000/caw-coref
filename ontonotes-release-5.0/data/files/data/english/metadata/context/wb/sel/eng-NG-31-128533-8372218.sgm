Unlike on what I see on Blogger Help, I do not have the Add Page
Elements button. Also, although the cursor changes to the 'move' mode,
I can't move my page elements around. They just stay there.

I'm also having trouble editing my HTML. Whenever I try clicking any
of the three &quot;Clear Edits&quot;, &quot;Preview&quot;, or &quot;Save Changes&quot; buttons,
nothing happens. It's as if they never worked.

How do I overcome this? Please help.
