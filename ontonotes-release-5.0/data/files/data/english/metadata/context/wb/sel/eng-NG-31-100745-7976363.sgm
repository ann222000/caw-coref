Pizza Stone on the Grill

Does anyone have a pizza stone that works on a gas or charcoal grill without
cracking up. Has anyone used fibrament. If so does fibrament absorb enough
of the dough moisture to crisp the bottom of the crust?
Has anyone used any other stone material on the grill.

I made a great Pizza Margherita on the grill today. I used fresh basil,
seeded sliced tomato, and fresh mozzerella and nothing else.  This was the
second time in 10 years I've tried this, and the second time I cracked the
pizza stone on the grill. The stone temp. was about 600F; several drops of
liquid spilled onto the stone when I took the pizza off and it cracked. I'm
pretty sure it's because the bottom of the stone was 600F or higher, and the
top suddenly became 100F or so.

If any make pizza routinely successfully, I would sure like to hear how you
do it, and what kind of stone do you use?

TIA

It works very well, it's made of the same ceramic material used to make
the Egg and thicker than most stones you'll come across.

the stones don't really 'absorb' the moisture. a 500°+ object just isn't

I don't agree with that, and I don't think stone oven pizza makers do
either. The pizza hits the 600F +/- stone, with about a 65-70% water to
flour ratio, by weight. The moisture on the bottom of the pizza round goes
into the stone, and the pizza becomes crisp on the bottom. The stone doesn't
pull moisture. The moisture equilibrates between the bottom of the crust and
the stone. On any other metallic cooking surface, the moisture all stays in
the crust. If you don't use a stone, you'll have a soggy crust.

Yes BGE sells stones. I don't think you can make a stone.
I suspect BGE stones crack just like mine did when subjected to
rapid temperature changes.
Fibrament is a fake stone that requires a metal pan underneath it to shield
it from a live flame.

Actually, I went to a company that imports and sells slate.  Got a
piece about a half inch thick (natural -- without any glaze).  Then I
got a metal baking sheet about the same size (slightly larger).  I put
the slate on the sheet, then put both on the cold grill.  Start the
grill and crank it right up.

Research I did at the time ('bout three years ago) suggested that the
&quot;stone&quot; had to heat up with the &quot;oven&quot; and could not take direct
flame.  My approach addressed these two points and I've used it
successfully on a number of occasions.

You might want to Google on &quot;ZaGrill&quot;.  No stone involved.  These work
well, but are made out of mild steel and are very rust-prone if you
don't keep everything completely dry.  If you're handy with tools, it
wouldn't be hard to make something similar yourself out of stainless
and/or heavy aluminum pans available at restaurant supply places, and in
larger sizes, if needed.

You know I gues that may well be it. The temp. at the center of a propane
flame is probably in the 1500F range.
Look at this interesting site: http://www.doctorfire.com/flametmp.html
That probably cracks a stone grill. It must be the flame, rather than the
grate below. I suspect charcoal would be less likely as the high temp. heat
is farther away from the bottom of the stone.
I was looking at the Fibrament site last night as possible way to solve
this. They sell their &quot;stones&quot; for grills with a metal protector underneath.
I'm off to Walmart for a large cheap baking sheet.

Thanks for your post.

We have purchased pizza &quot;stones,&quot; at WalMart that seem to work well.
They're about 16&quot; or so in diameter and of a heavy pottery material.  I use
mine in the grill with good success and have not had one break. One thing to
consider is keeping it from moisture, like rain.  I put it on the grates
when I first light them, letting the heat increase gradually to drive out
any moisture.

&gt; I don't agree with that, and I don't think stone oven pizza makers do
&gt; either. The pizza hits the 600F +/- stone, with about a 65-70% water to
&gt; flour ratio, by weight. The moisture on the bottom of the pizza round goes
&gt; into the stone, and the pizza becomes crisp on the bottom. The stone
&gt; doesn't pull moisture. The moisture equilibrates between the bottom of the
&gt; crust and the stone. On any other metallic cooking surface, the moisture
&gt; all stays in the crust. If you don't use a stone, you'll have a soggy
&gt; crust.
">

hmmmm, go to the fibrament webpage and look under faqs where they say that
you can cover the stone with aluminum foil. go to the pizza forum (
http://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/ )  read about those that cook on
parchment paper on top of thier stones. also on the forum you can read about
cooking pizza on plate steel.

water vaporizes at that temperature and creates pressure that seeks the
least resistance, out along the interface between the dough and the stone.
elvis leaves the building.

your beliefs don't affect my pizza or my respect for thermodynamics.

exactly what we do. the stone is for the oven. though the stone would help
to provide a more uniform heat to the dough avoiding the hotspots that are
normal over a charcoal, etc fire.

&gt; We have purchased pizza &quot;stones,&quot; at WalMart that seem to work well.

Nonny are you baking your pizza over charcoal or over gas? Have you measured
the temp. on the grate[I usually put an oven thermometer on the stone to see
where it is]?
What kind of grate are you using? Someone at William Sonoma today told me
she used to put
the pizza round on the steel grate of a Weber charcoal, bake it for one
minute, then flip it and top the pizza. Then the rest gets baked on the
grate without any stone.  Your point about the slow heating  and the
evaporation of water is a very good one. Mine cracked when some unknown
aqueous material dribbled from the pizza to the stone, I'm sure.

&gt;&gt; You might want to Google on &quot;ZaGrill&quot;.  No stone involved.  These work
&gt;&gt; well, but are made out of mild steel and are very rust-prone if you
&gt;&gt; don't keep everything completely dry.  If you're handy with tools, it

Villaware makes a pizza stone for grills. It is meant to be used on a
gas or charcoal grill with the lid off. The stone sits in a metal holder
that raises it up and allows hot air to flow around over the top to cook
the toppings. It also has a temp monitor. As was mentioned earlier, go
to pizzamaking.com. It has everything you want to know about pizza
making. I have made pizzas on the grill by raising up my stone like the
Villaware. I make most of my pizzas in a wood fire outdoor oven I built.
My pizzas cook in about 90 seconds at about 900 to 1000 degrees.

Kent, I cook it with charcoal, (I wouldn't think that gas is much
different) be sure there's an indirect part of the grill that you can
move the crust to. Lightly brush your crust(the bottom) with olive
oil. Plop your crust on the clean grates with spatula in hand and cook
as you would a pancake; check for how fast it's cooking, and manuver
the crust with the spatula until the bottom is done to your liking.
Its a work in progress, keep an eye on it; it will cook relatively
quickly. You can keep the lid up.  You'll end up with some nice
marks.
Remove the crust to a cutting board, lightly brush the topping side
with evoo to the now cooked side, and apply the toppings. Continue
cooking manuvering the pizza from the hot to the indirect side until
the cheese has melted, and you've got a nice crust on the bottom.

Its not very complicated, and a bit of fun.  As it should be.

Yes, got it from Walmart a few years ago, I fire the grill up to as hot
as it will get.  Fresh homemade dough, then simple toppings, boom done.

No cracking at all.

for grilled pizza you can drop the stone as well. Make your dough, place
all the crusts you've made between separate sheets of wax paper. Get the
grill ready, put raw dough on grate, I can usually  do two at a time. It
does not take long to crispy up one side. When all crusts are done on
one side, start doing the toppings a the grilled side, take it back out,
put is over indirect heat to finish the bottom and top.

Thanks, Pierre, I'm going to try this.
I do something very similar in the kitchen. I use leftover pizza dough to
make a pizza round, and then precook it
at 550F on a stone for 90 seconds. When you take it out it collapses. I
freeze the rounds for a quick pizza when I don't have time to go through the
whole ritual. It works great. When I make the pizza with the frozen round, I
thaw it before topping it, and proceed exactly as you do. I haven't tried
that directly on the grate, and shall.
Thanks again, for the idea.

I've been using a porcelain coated cast iron grate with the flat side up for
fish and other flaky foods
that don't do well with steel rods. It seems that would make your technique
easier. I'm going to have a go at that. As I said in the preceeding post, I
freeze the partially cooked rounds, and use them later. Thaw them first.
