About 3 weeks ago I was cleaning gutters while standing on an extension ladder.  Ladder was equipped
with &quot;no-slip&quot; rubber feet and leaning at 30 degrees, or so, against the gutter.  This is prescribed
&quot;safe&quot; way to use an extension ladder, except I had not accounted for the rubber feet sitting on wet
tile deck.  I remember thinking in that crystal clear millisecond of rationalization on the way
down:  &quot;Hey, it must be possible for a rubber footed ladder to slip ( hydroplane ?) on a wet tile
deck&quot;.

At this writing, I am slowly recovering from a broken left ankle (medial malleolus) and a broken
heel bone (calcaneous) on the right.

Next time use scaffolding. It's cheap to rent, not too expensive to own
(I own some), extremely versatile, gives you space to put tools and
supplies, and it generally far more stable than any extension ladder.
I've even strapped two levels of scaffolding (12') in the back of my
truck and driven it around my back yard pruning trees. One level
strapped in the truck makes a very functional if odd looking temporary
rack for transporting long items. The time it takes for one person to
setup a simple scaffold tower is not significantly longer than to setup
an extension ladder properly and the scaffolding will let you access
about an 11' span safely (7' scaffolding) vs. about 4' for an extension
ladder.

Actually, 15 degrees (75 from horizontal) is considered safest.  This is
about 1 foot out at the bottom for each 4 in height.

A week after Hurricane Charlie, getting ready for the next one, I was
trimming broken branches off the large Oak next to the house. I had 1 foot
on the branch and 1 on an old 8ft step ladder. just finished the branch,
straighten up, when the ladder broke. I had enough smarts to throw the chain
saw, but I landed on 1 arm and poked a branch into my hand. After I
determined that nothing was broken I got up and went into the house, then
the blood started flowing. Made a mess on the rug inside the door before I
got to the kitchen to get something to stop the flow. Waited 2 hours for my

I was on an extension ladder up at the peak of the house I was siding
a few months ago when I needed to pull a nail to adjust the siding
1/4&quot; up. The nail head popped through the bloody cheapass OSB and the
hammer came loose in my hands. I was leaning only about 1.5' out to
the left of the ladder but it was enough to cause me to lose my
footing on the right foot. While I was slowly tilting to the left,
getting ready to fall 14' (head height), I quickly adjusted my body
with my left foot and jumped from the top of the ladder. I landed on
both feet equally but they were slightly ahead of my body mass, so I
rolled back after hitting. My head struck the lowest rung on the
ladder and took a nice dent, leaving an L-shaped ding down to the
bone. It didn't bleed much at all, but the birdies spinning in my head
were bright and noisy for about 10 minutes. I healed up just fine in 2
or 3 weeks with no stitches or anything. I even finished the job
afterward so it caused no work loss.

A month later, I was walking down a 2' slope with tool bags in both
hands when my foot caught a branch. I quickly moved my foot and went
to step again when the shoelace caught. I gave it one more valliant
try before I knew I was going down for sure.  I landed on my right
knee. The impact was at the patellar ligament at the base of the
kneecap. It hurt so bad that I felt the tool bags slip out of my hands
as I fell face first toward the debris from the tree, unable to move
my hands to brace myself for the fall. (Shock is not a fun thing to
discover when you're hurt, is it?) Luckily, I recovered just in time
to keep my face out of the dirt and branches. My knee, however, was
hurting like hell for a few months afterward. It's OK now, thankfully.
I turned down about half the work for a few weeks because of it, and
didn't put up the lady's billboard for about 6 weeks because of the
crap in her yard which she'd said would be gone before I came to
repair the fencing from the downed branches.

Hopefully, I won't have any more horror stories to tell for a long
while. I don't have insurance and hate hospitals/doctors, anyway.

P.S: To the OP, it's spelled &quot;HANDYMAN&quot;, you fidiot!

I did same thing in '88 only the ladder was on freshly sealed concrete. I
went over the side as the ladder slipped. Landed on my back and whip action
gave me a concusion on the back of my head. I laid there for hours as I was
by myself.

The back still hurts. I have sense learned to hire a teenager for any job

Happened so fast I was on the ground in pain before I knew I was falling.
You can really mess up your shoulder from just a few feet up the ladder.
Going from 6+ ft tall to full horizontal landing on one's shoulder does add
a bit of distance to the fall.

Luckily for me, I didn't break anything though I'm sure something snapped
back in place once I moved my arm.  It was weeks before I could stretch my
arm straight out and about 1/2 a year before things felt normal again.

I'm not the neatest person in the world except when ladders and scaffolds
are in use.  I pick up every thing I see that ends up on the ground during
construction.  I'm always cleaning up the fall zone.  I'd rather land on
lawn or sand then a tool or piece of lumber.  I have had this healthy
respect for ladders and gravity long before this fall.

A year ago my boss told me to use a 16 foot step ladder to go fix a light
since the high reach was broke.  I told him he might as well fire me now,
I'm not going that high over concrete.

Ladders remind me of a guy I worked with, his motto was one hand for the
company, one for yourself.  IOW, if you can't do it one handed stay off of a
ladder.

I was felling a tree, and it fell not exactly where I wanted. It
crushed a military surplus compressor that I was about to start
fixing.

In another accident, I was about to take off a lawn mower blade, but
the wrench slipped and I seriously hurt my finger. It recovered, but
to this day it bends a little wrong.

Geez!  Been there, done that, and lived to tell about it!

I was going to go up on the roof, and was using an older ladder
without the feet.  I had put this thing on the asphalt driveway
hundreds of times, but this time I must have had it at more
angle than before, and the bottom started to slide, and didn't
stop.  I could have jumped off the thing and just had sore
heels, I was only about 6 feet off the ground!  But, I thought
the ladder was going to catch, and I also had to get rid of the
pole saw I was carrying.  I landed across the ladder, bending
the top rung like a big U with my abdomen.  I broke two fingers
which were no biggie, I think I dislocated my shoulder, and had
internal bleeding.  The hospital kept me on ice chips for two
days in case they had to do surgery.  Eventually they did
nothing but splint one finger, for a total of $8000 or so!

Well, I hope you are in better shape than I was, although I
could walk when they let me out.

I now set that ladder firmly in the ground whenever I go up on
the roof - that works great.

Bob,

Sorry to hear about this. I hope you make a quick recovery.

A similar thing happened to me a few years ago. It was mid summer and
I put a ladder up against our barn. It was an extension ladder with
pivoting (i.e., self-levelling) metal feet with a large rubber pad on
the bottom. Like you, I put the ladder at about 30 degrees to the
vertical. It was standing on grass, so I didn't think there was much
chance of it slipping. But I was wrong. When I was almost up to the
height of the gutter (10 feet or so), the bottom of the ladder started
to slide backwards. It seems the hot weather had made the grass dry
and slippery. Luckily it was a long ladder (18 feet or so), and it
came to rest before the top fell off the barn. But it gave me a real
fright.

It sounds like you had an unlucky experience. But if you can afford
some scaffolding like Pete suggests, it's probably the safest thing to
do in the future.

Best wishes,

Chris

I had heard it was growing too fast, like several other parts of
Florida. I grew up just outside of a town of 50,000 in Ohio, so I know
what you mean.

The only person I knew that lived in Deltona was J. Whitehurst (sp),
but he's probably dead by now. I haven't seen him in 12 to 15 years.  He
was disabled, and using an electric scooter.  A large guy, and sometimes
hard to get along with. He would have fit right in on this group. :)

I always wanted to ride the service elevator to the top work platform
on the Ch 55 tower, but never had the two hours+ to spare, after
finishing the transmitter maintenance. I DIDN'T want to go up when the
195 KW of TV RF, plus five 50 KW FM stations were on the air.  Ch 68 was
on 24/7, but at a lower power. (They had a lousy Japanese NEC
transmitter.)

It looks to me as if the ladder went up onto one leg and folded from
the weight at that angle. Are you sporting a Class I body on a Class

I'm thankful I ended up in one piece after my jump from the top.
Rather than fall, I had the presence of mind to jump and was able to
control the angle at which I impacted. It was grass, too, so I'm
thankful for that as well.

Agreed.  The recommendation I'd always heard was to stand with your toes at
the base of the ladder, and stick your arms out in front of you, elbows
straight. If you can lay your palms on the rung that's closest to shoulder
height, it's at the proper angle. If your wrists hit it, it's too steep; if
your fingers touch it (or worse, you can't reach it), it's not steep enough.

For most people, I think that's a lot closer to 15 degrees than it is to 30.

&gt;I know how you feel. Last June, I took a 6' header off a step ladder and
&gt;landed on my left hip on concrete. Broke my pelvis in half. Now, 15 months
&gt;later, I'm still recovering, and clearly no more triathlon comps in my
&gt;life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A week after Hurricane Charlie, getting ready for the next one, I was
&gt;&gt;&gt;trimming broken branches off the large Oak next to the house. I had 1 foot
&gt;&gt;&gt;on the branch and 1 on an old 8ft step ladder. just finished the branch,
&gt;&gt;&gt;straighten up, when the ladder broke.

&gt;It looks to me as if the ladder went up onto one leg and folded from
&gt;the weight at that angle. Are you sporting a Class I body on a Class
&gt;III ladder, boy? (Hmm, no, I see that you were on a Class I.) Had the
&gt;lower step been placed on something which deformed it before you went
&gt;up?

Well there was a 5# margin at the time.  I never did anything to bend or
deform the step.  I just don't use ladders in poor condition

&gt;&gt;Luckily for me, I didn't break anything though I'm sure something snapped
&gt;&gt;back in place once I moved my arm.  It was weeks before I could stretch my
&gt;&gt;arm straight out and about 1/2 a year before things felt normal again.

&gt;I'm thankful I ended up in one piece after my jump from the top.
&gt;Rather than fall, I had the presence of mind to jump and was able to
&gt;control the angle at which I impacted. It was grass, too, so I'm
&gt;thankful for that as well.

I'm glad you had some control and were able to exercise it.  At the ages we
are getting to be we don't land very well anymore.

&gt; About 3 weeks ago I was cleaning gutters while standing on an extension ladder.  Ladder was equipped
&gt; with &quot;no-slip&quot; rubber feet and leaning at 30 degrees, or so, against the gutter.  This is prescribed
&gt; &quot;safe&quot; way to use an extension ladder, except I had not accounted for the rubber feet sitting on wet
&gt; tile deck.  I remember thinking in that crystal clear millisecond of rationalization on the way
&gt; down:  &quot;Hey, it must be possible for a rubber footed ladder to slip ( hydroplane ?) on a wet tile
&gt; deck&quot;.

&gt; At this writing, I am slowly recovering from a broken left ankle (medial malleolus) and a broken
&gt; heel bone (calcaneous) on the right.

People used to laugh at me for tying ladders off, sometimes to a stake
at the base, sometimes to a 2x across a doorway. Beats limping.
Glad you didn't break your neck.
