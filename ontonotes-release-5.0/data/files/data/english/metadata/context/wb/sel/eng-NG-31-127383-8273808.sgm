Prakash Karat on the N-deal

'These are vital issues which cannot be ignored'

By Prakash Karat
Rediff
Monday, August 20, 2007

The Indo-US bilateral agreement on nuclear cooperation is
in the eye of a political storm. The UPA government's
announcement of the conclusion of the agreement has led to
a political crisis.

It may be difficult for ordinary people to grasp the
implications of the nuclear agreement with all its
technical aspects and intricacies. The supply of nuclear
fuel, the fuel cycle, the enrichment and reprocessing
technologies and the safeguards agreement are all not
within the knowledge of lay people.

Without going into the complex issues concerning nuclear
cooperation, one way to understand and assess the agreement
is to ask: does this agreement advance India's interests,
does it protect our capacity for an independent foreign
policy and sovereignty? Is this an agreement only on
nuclear cooperation or is it part of a wider agreement?

Firstly, the nuclear cooperation deal is only one part of
the wide-ranging alliance that the UPA government has
forged with the United States. This was spelt out by the
Indian prime minister and the American president in the
joint statement in July 2005 in Washington.

This agreement covers political, economic, military and
nuclear cooperation. This alliance entails not just nuclear
cooperation but talks of the two countries promoting global
democracy, revamping the Indian economy to facilitate large
scale investment by the Untied States and a strategic
military collaboration.

Prior to the joint statement of July 2005, the UPA
government signed a 10-year Defence Framework Agreement
with the Untied States. It is evident that without the
defence agreement, the Americans would not have agreed for
the nuclear cooperation. This is part of a quid pro quo.

Even before the nuclear cooperation agreement was
finalised, the government began to tune its foreign policy
to the strategic alliance with the United States. The
United States held India's attitude to Iran to be a test.
India responded by voting against Iran not once, but twice,
in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The first serious conflict with the Left arose when the UPA
government did a volte-face on the Iran nuclear issue. The
government voted along with the US and the Western
countries in September 2005 and was not even prepared to go
along with the position adopted by the bloc of Non-Aligned
Movement countries.

The Left parties have been watching with disquiet the way
the UPA government has gone about forging close strategic
and military ties with the United States. The Left came out
in strong opposition to the Defence Framework Agreement.

As per the agreement, India is taking steps to interlock
our armed forces with that of the United States in the name
of 'inter-operability.' The framework agreement is leading
to various steps like the Logistics Support Agreement and
the Maritime Cooperation Pact.

The Left has been vehemently opposed to the joint military
exercises as the one that took place in the Kalaikunda air
base in West Bengal. These exercises were held despite the
strong protests of the Left parties and the Left Front
government of West Bengal. The years 2005 to 2007 have seen
a sharp increase in joint exercises between the two armed
forces.

This is now being extended to the 'quadrilateral' exercises
as desired by the US with Japan [Images] and Australia in
the September naval exercises in the Bay of Bengal.

Following the footsteps of the previous BJP government, the
UPA government has been deepening collaboration with Israel
in the military and security spheres which violates our
long-held policy of support to the Palestinian cause and
friendship with the Arab countries.

The major pitch being made for the nuclear cooperation
agreement is that it will help India meet its energy needs.
This ignores the very limited contribution that nuclear
power makes to our overall energy generation which is just
3 per cent and which cannot exceed 7 per cent even if the
ambitious plans for expansion are implemented in the next
25 years.

To make India's foreign policy and strategic autonomy
hostage to the potential of nuclear energy does not make
sense except for the American imperative to bind India to
its strategic designs in Asia.

The bilateral agreement with the United States is going to
be governed on the American side by the legislation passed
in the US Congress called the Hyde Act. The Hyde Act
expects India to have a foreign policy 'congruent' to the
United States.

Every year, the US president will be reporting to the US
Congress on how India is complying with the provisions set
out in the Hyde Act. Though the Indian government says the
Hyde Act provisions are not binding on India, it is binding
on the future presidents of the United States.

After the Hyde Act was adopted in December 2006, the CPI(M)
had analysing the American legislation, stated that it
contains provisions which are contrary to the assurances
given by the prime minister to Parliament on August 17,
2006. The CPI(M) had repeatedly asked the government not to
proceed with the bilateral negotiations for the 123
agreement, till this matter was cleared up. But the
government did not heed this advice too.

Many of the provisions under the Hyde Act which impinge on
nuclear cooperation with India are not mentioned in the
bilateral text. Already India is lining up with the United
States in its targeting of Iran. Certain Indian companies
have been warned not to export to Iran due to American
pressure. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline will not
proceed if this nuclear agreement is put in place despite
protestations to the contrary by the government.

When the UPA government was being installed in 2004, a
Common Minimum Programme was drafted. When the Left was
consulted, we had insisted on the deletion of a reference
to 'strategic relations with the United States.' There is
no mention of strategic ties with the US in the Common
Minimum Programme. But soon after, the government proceeded
with forging a wider strategic alliance with the United
States.

The Left parties have, after carefully assessing the
implications of the 123 agreement, demanded that the
government not proceed further to operationalise the
agreement. The objections to the deal have been spelt out
in detail in the statement issued by the Left parties. The
Left is clear that going ahead with the agreement will bind
India to the United States in a manner that will seriously
impair an independent foreign policy and our strategic
autonomy.

A wise and expedient step for the government would be to
acknowledge that there is widespread opposition to the
agreement. The question is not whether it should be put to
vote in Parliament or not. It is clear that a majority in
Parliament is opposed to the agreement. The best course
would be for the government not to proceed further with the
operationalising of the agreement. Till all the doubts are
clarified and the implications of the Hyde Act evaluated,
the government should not take the next steps with regard
to negotiating the IAEA safeguards, which are to be in
perpetuity, and proceed to get the guidelines from the
Nuclear Suppliers Group.

As the country observes the 60th anniversary of
Independence, fundamental questions concerning our
sovereignty and independent foreign policy are being
raised. These are vital issues which cannot be ignored.

Prakash Karat is the General Secretary of the CPI-M.

He probably doesn't want to approach the ChiComs because
they are terrorist Pakistan's suppliers.  The modern-day
Congress party's biggest accomplishment, from their point
of view, is selling Bharat to the Vatican and also down
the Potomac and Thames -- while our sacred Gangaa gets
more polluted by the hour.

&gt; &gt; nuclear cooperation with India are not mentioned in the
&gt; &gt; bilateral text. Already India is lining up with the United
&gt; &gt; States in its targeting of Iran. Certain Indian companies
&gt; &gt; have been warned not to export to Iran due to American
&gt; &gt; pressure. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline will not
&gt; &gt; proceed if this nuclear agreement is put in place despite
&gt; &gt; protestations to the contrary by the government.

&gt; &gt; When the UPA government was being installed in 2004, a
&gt; &gt; Common Minimum Programme was drafted. When the Left was
&gt; &gt; consulted, we had insisted on the deletion of a reference
&gt; &gt; to 'strategic relations with the United States.' There is
&gt; &gt; no mention of strategic ties with the US in the Common
&gt; &gt; Minimum Programme. But soon after, the government proceeded
&gt; &gt; with forging a wider strategic alliance with the United
&gt; &gt; States.

&gt; &gt; The Left parties have, after carefully assessing the
&gt; &gt; implications of the 123 agreement, demanded that the
&gt; &gt; government not proceed further to operationalise the
&gt; &gt; agreement. The objections to the deal have been spelt out
&gt; &gt; in detail in the statement issued by the Left parties. The
&gt; &gt; Left is clear that going ahead with the agreement will bind
&gt; &gt; India to the United States in a manner that will seriously
&gt; &gt; impair an independent foreign policy and our strategic
&gt; &gt; autonomy.

&gt; &gt; A wise and expedient step for the government would be to
&gt; &gt; acknowledge that there is widespread opposition to the
&gt; &gt; agreement. The question is not whether it should be put to
&gt; &gt; vote in Parliament or not. It is clear that a majority in
&gt; &gt; Parliament is opposed to the agreement. The best course
&gt; &gt; would be for the government not to proceed further with the
&gt; &gt; operationalising of the agreement. Till all the doubts are
&gt; &gt; clarified and the implications of the Hyde Act evaluated,
&gt; &gt; the government should not take the next steps with regard
&gt; &gt; to negotiating the IAEA safeguards, which are to be in
&gt; &gt; perpetuity, and proceed to get the guidelines from the
&gt; &gt; Nuclear Suppliers Group.

&gt; &gt; As the country observes the 60th anniversary of
&gt; &gt; Independence, fundamental questions concerning our
&gt; &gt; sovereignty and independent foreign policy are being
&gt; &gt; raised. These are vital issues which cannot be ignored.

&gt; Prakash Karat on the N-deal

&gt; 'These are vital issues which cannot be ignored'

&gt; By Prakash Karat
&gt; Rediff
&gt; Monday, August 20, 2007

&gt; The Indo-US bilateral agreement on nuclear cooperation is
&gt; in the eye of a political storm. The UPA government's
&gt; announcement of the conclusion of the agreement has led to
&gt; a political crisis.

&gt; It may be difficult for ordinary people to grasp the
&gt; implications of the nuclear agreement with all its
&gt; technical aspects and intricacies. The supply of nuclear
&gt; fuel, the fuel cycle, the enrichment and reprocessing
&gt; technologies and the safeguards agreement are all not
&gt; within the knowledge of lay people.

&gt; Without going into the complex issues concerning nuclear
&gt; cooperation, one way to understand and assess the agreement
&gt; is to ask: does this agreement advance India's interests,
&gt; does it protect our capacity for an independent foreign
&gt; policy and sovereignty? Is this an agreement only on
&gt; nuclear cooperation or is it part of a wider agreement?

&gt; Firstly, the nuclear cooperation deal is only one part of
&gt; the wide-ranging alliance that the UPA government has
&gt; forged with the United States. This was spelt out by the
&gt; Indian prime minister and the American president in the
&gt; joint statement in July 2005 in Washington.

&gt; This agreement covers political, economic, military and
&gt; nuclear cooperation. This alliance entails not just nuclear
&gt; cooperation but talks of the two countries promoting global
&gt; democracy, revamping the Indian economy to facilitate large
&gt; scale investment by the Untied States and a strategic
&gt; military collaboration.

&gt; Prior to the joint statement of July 2005, the UPA
&gt; government signed a 10-year Defence Framework Agreement
&gt; with the Untied States. It is evident that without the
&gt; defence agreement, the Americans would not have agreed for
&gt; the nuclear cooperation. This is part of a quid pro quo.

&gt; Even before the nuclear cooperation agreement was
&gt; finalised, the government began to tune its foreign policy
&gt; to the strategic alliance with the United States. The
&gt; United States held India's attitude to Iran to be a test.
&gt; India responded by voting against Iran not once, but twice,
&gt; in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

&gt; The first serious conflict with the Left arose when the UPA
&gt; government did a volte-face on the Iran nuclear issue. The
&gt; government voted along with the US and the Western
&gt; countries in September 2005 and was not even prepared to go
&gt; along with the position adopted by the bloc of Non-Aligned
&gt; Movement countries.

&gt; The Left parties have been watching with disquiet the way
&gt; the UPA government has gone about forging close strategic
&gt; and military ties with the United States. The Left came out
&gt; in strong opposition to the Defence Framework Agreement.

&gt; As per the agreement, India is taking steps to interlock
&gt; our armed forces with that of the United States in the name
&gt; of 'inter-operability.' The framework agreement is leading
&gt; to various steps like the Logistics Support Agreement and
&gt; the Maritime Cooperation Pact.

&gt; The Left has been vehemently opposed to the joint military
&gt; exercises as the one that took place in the Kalaikunda air
&gt; base in West Bengal. These exercises were held despite the
&gt; strong protests of the Left parties and the Left Front
&gt; government of West Bengal. The years 2005 to 2007 have seen
&gt; a sharp increase in joint exercises between the two armed
&gt; forces.

&gt; This is now being extended to the 'quadrilateral' exercises
&gt; as desired by the US with Japan [Images] and Australia in
&gt; the September naval exercises in the Bay of Bengal.

&gt; Following the footsteps of the previous BJP government, the
&gt; UPA government has been deepening collaboration with Israel
&gt; in the military and security spheres which violates our
&gt; long-held policy of support to the Palestinian cause and
&gt; friendship with the Arab countries.

&gt; The major pitch being made for the nuclear cooperation
&gt; agreement is that it will help India meet its energy needs.
&gt; This ignores the very limited contribution that nuclear
&gt; power makes to our overall energy generation which is just
&gt; 3 per cent and which cannot exceed 7 per cent even if the
&gt; ambitious plans for expansion are implemented in the next
&gt; 25 years.

&gt; To make India's foreign policy and strategic autonomy
&gt; hostage to the potential of nuclear energy does not make
&gt; sense except for the American imperative to bind India to
&gt; its strategic designs in Asia.

&gt; The bilateral agreement with the United States is going to
&gt; be governed on the American side by the legislation passed
&gt; in the US Congress called the Hyde Act. The Hyde Act
&gt; expects India to have a foreign policy 'congruent' to the
&gt; United States.

&gt; Every year, the US president will be reporting to the US
&gt; Congress on how India is complying with the provisions set
&gt; out in the Hyde Act. Though the Indian government says the
&gt; Hyde Act provisions are not binding on India, it is binding
&gt; on the future presidents of the United States.

&gt; After the Hyde Act was adopted in December 2006, the CPI(M)
&gt; had analysing the American legislation, stated that it
&gt; contains provisions which are contrary to the assurances
&gt; given by the prime minister to Parliament on August 17,
&gt; 2006. The CPI(M) had repeatedly asked the government not to
&gt; proceed with the bilateral negotiations for the 123
&gt; agreement, till this matter was cleared up. But the
&gt; government did not heed this advice too.

&gt; Many of the provisions under the Hyde Act which impinge on
&gt; nuclear cooperation with India are not mentioned in the
&gt; bilateral text. Already India is lining up with the United
&gt; States in its targeting of Iran. Certain Indian companies
&gt; have been warned not to export to Iran due to American
&gt; pressure. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline will not
&gt; proceed if this nuclear agreement is put in place despite
&gt; protestations to the contrary by the government.

&gt; When the UPA government was being installed in 2004, a
&gt; Common Minimum Programme was drafted. When the Left was
&gt; consulted, we had insisted on the deletion of a reference
&gt; to 'strategic relations with the United States.' There is
&gt; no mention of strategic ties with the US in the Common
&gt; Minimum Programme. But soon after, the government proceeded
&gt; with forging a wider strategic alliance with the United
&gt; States.

&gt; The Left parties have, after carefully assessing the
&gt; implications of the 123 agreement, demanded that the
&gt; government not proceed further to operationalise the
&gt; agreement. The objections to the deal have been spelt out
&gt; in detail in the statement issued by the Left parties. The
&gt; Left is clear that going ahead with the agreement will bind
&gt; India to the United States in a manner that will seriously

&gt; sovereignty and independent foreign policy are being
&gt; raised. These are vital issues which cannot be ignored.
