Counterintelligence thinks this stuff up. A rule set with hidden booby
traps.

I do not like counterintelligence so here is the worst one:

A direction of travel, always attack is their true rule. The sideways
stuff is for noncontact "fighting".

Sideways attack was proven to be dangerous for a simple reason.  So
the style is disallowed.

It is all writtenup otherwise in the real school I am sure.

Here is how a sniper attacks.

Line up the first cross hair then the second one.  A basic school of
crosshair training instills correct behavior. And to guess the correct
hair to cross first is the experts test.

my friend at the bar also said:

"a gun get far and short and decide which you are first."

Meaning far shooting is for experts and short is for short range
experts. So 10-300 yards is short range and &gt;300 is for snipers.

IN open field a whole squad of snipers is required. INcities, a single
sniper per squad is all that was mandatory.

ANd it is technically as hard to shoot 10-300 as &gt;300.

A basic rule is: out to 40 yards no sighting allowed. &gt;40 yards a
sight is mandatory. Even a head arround a corner is no sight allowed.

So everybody knows the attacker is fast incoming or not, if you have
to raise the rifle. All the rules added up backwards in the posting.

Ammo is expensive.

A tactical to the event is always the outcome of the sniper.  An enemy
surprised is an enemy tactically altered.

As the shot goes the event is warned.  And to warn the commander was
to have the shot allowed.  All shots at distance are with permission
unless a battle has begun.

SO the allowed method was to test the enemy by killing one.  And they
either advance immediatly or sit and look for more than five seconds.
A five second time divides tactically trained personnel.

After the test the commander then decides.  And he must weigh the new
scene as tactics were altered by the shot. So he gets to sit and
wait.  An advance on the opposition is commonly thought of as working
to hard.

So waiting for up to ten minuites is a rule, then the enemy is judged
waffling.  So work has to happen.

A sniper as the worker is a certain turkey shooter and the enemy is
either starting a turkey shoot also or applying military strength. And
waiting for a larger attack from another direction.

Either way the shooting begins.  A sniper then has to work as the
first engauger.  And so the squad calls out people in certain
fashion.  A basic finger.

All the squad gets to hangout pointing to the attacker.  It is very
intimidating work.

And the sniper is also given bad points for enemy that gets within 300
yards.

He fires at range in two seconds.  HArd work.  He is real fast. And
the rule of the school is hidden.  I cannot mention it my firend says
because the school is  hard knocks good. Sighting is a great tactical
advantage though.

A sniper sits and waits formally for the squad to finger and lets
everybody else work sighting. It is like an great African Hunter
routine. They always act the part.

No gilly suits unless the approach is to be made.  A surprise t, as
the method of the school is all hidden.  A high speed run is also
allowed.  A run to 500 yards and a takeout of the commander. Three
minutes of dead run to 500 yards is the limit allowed. Three minutes
is selected because of standards guard layout.

A test. Who knows the school?

What is really funny about the original post is the idea is
transmitted to all Marines, whether they are in combat or not. We had
a very isolated guard gate which required two guards 24 hours. Inside
a week we had several "quick draw" injuries and when the pistols were
replaced with carbines a "muzzle to muzzle" contest with a death and
loss of an eye as the result.

Believe it or not, the rule for not shooting as field work allows is
hidden.  Suffice it to say that the gun as the rifle appeared distinct
from the handweapon.

A hint: The end as open for use in a rifle is different from the drawn
weapon. Once drawn they are the same.

Always have a drawn weapon is different from having to get ready to
shoot.
So being ready to shoot always is different.

ANd the marines require the weapon to be pointable at everybody. So
pointing intentionally to say what's up is common. As hellos go the
point of the weapon is supposed to be good.

Saying hello was trained into some people. They were supposed to be
happy to say hello by pointing at freindly people.

It was not supposed to be trained as not allowed.

A reason exists and to always be safe by having the behind th eback
drrawn sword was the reason. You have to feel safer with the friendly
drawn weapon.

If you do not feel safer, you need to have attitudes changed.

&gt; Saying hello was trained into some people. They were supposed to be

&gt; It was not supposed to be trained as not allowed.

&gt; A reason exists and to always be safe by having the behind th eback

&gt; If you do not feel safer, you need to have attitudes changed.

I may be a non-weapon type, but I study.

And study means I get to display a knowledge of the subject.

So when I give advice, you says you have no knowledge.

I am correct. A Hello was the version of reality I was studying.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Believe it or not, the rule for not shooting as field work allows is
&gt; &gt; &gt; hidden.  Suffice it to say that the gun as the rifle appeared distinct
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the handweapon.

&gt; &gt; &gt; A hint: The end as open for use in a rifle is different from the drawn
&gt; &gt; &gt; weapon. Once drawn they are the same.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Always have a drawn weapon is different from having to get ready to
&gt; &gt; &gt; shoot.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So being ready to shoot always is different.

&gt; &gt; &gt; ANd the marines require the weapon to be pointable at everybody. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; pointing intentionally to say what's up is common. As hellos go the
&gt; &gt; &gt; point of the weapon is supposed to be good.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Saying hello was trained into some people. They were supposed to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; happy to say hello by pointing at freindly people.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It was not supposed to be trained as not allowed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; A reason exists and to always be safe by having the behind th eback
&gt; &gt; &gt; drrawn sword was the reason. You have to feel safer with the friendly
&gt; &gt; &gt; drawn weapon.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you do not feel safer, you need to have attitudes changed.

&gt; &gt; I dare say the only weapon you have ever handled is the one you were
&gt; &gt; blessed with at birth..

You display your "knowledge" for the world to see..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That is correct, you have no idea what you ware talking about.

You are wacked.

Objection !
The words large and Paris Hilton's brain are not to be used together...
