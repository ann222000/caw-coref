2 wounded in Southern train attack, 7 suspects nabbed
NARATHIWAT, April 14 (TNA) - Suspected insurgents Saturday morning attacked a
train in this violence-wracked southern province and wounded two persons while
security forces apprehended seven militant suspects, including a man wanted in
connection with charges of threatening security in the far South, officials
said.

The northbound train travelling between Sungai Kolok district and Nakhon Si
Thammarat province was assaulted by a group of suspected militants just before
it reached a train workers' residence in Ruso district of Narathiwat province.

The attackers fired dozens of salvos of gunfire at the train, forcing passengers
to hide themselves for protection. Two passengers were wounded and were urgently
dispatched to hospital in the district.

Meanwhile, more than 300 police and military personnel shortly after dawn Sunday
swept through 11 locations in Ruso district in a search operation and
apprehended seven suspected militants, including a man identified as 31-year-old
Anand Sarai, who wanted by the government on charges of threatening national
security.

All seven suspects were later transported to an army camp in nearby Pattani
province for interrogation.

Also, several items including two shotguns, three knives, a kilogramme of urea
fertiliser used for making explosives, four SIM cards and a military-style
telecommunications radio were seized during the four-hour search, police said.

Shortly afterwards, more than 300 villagers, mainly women, blocked a road in
Ruso district for over an hour, demanding the release of the suspects. Police
and army officers reportedly told the protestors that the suspects will be
released if they are found innocent.

The protesting villagers later dispersed without any untoward incident,
officials said. (TNA)-E111
