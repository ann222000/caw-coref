Just yesterday, the U.S. was claiming they attacked, killing 40-45 people, because they were fired upon (as Left I said, "at 2:45 a.m."?). But today the story seems to have changed . The new claim: "U.S. military officers reiterated that those killed were involved in smuggling foreign fighters into Iraq and that the houses attacked were way stations for militants. The mission was based on sound intelligence from 'multiple correlated evidence.'" And what did they do given "multiple correlated evidence"? Did they send a ground force to surround the place, arrest the people, and find out if that "multiple correlated evidence" was actually true? No, they fired 40 missiles into the compound in the middle of the night and killed 40 people, deemed worthy of the death penalty without benefit of trial or actual evidence. And post-facto, what's their evidence that they actually did attack "bad guys" and not a simple wedding party? "Maj. Gen. James N. Mattis, commander of Marines in Anbar province, where the assault occurred, defended the mission. 'These were more than two dozen military-aged males,' Reuters news service quoted him as saying. 'Let's not be naive.'" Not to mention that, in this wedding party of a hundred people or so, "troops found passports, weapons and the equivalent of $1,000 in Iraqi dinars at the site." Wow. That is some conclusive evidence.

Most of the media is treating this as a "he-said, she-said" deal. The Los Angeles Times story (referenced above), although headlined "Did U.S. Strike a Wedding or a Way Station for Militants?" and noting that it may well have been both, was the only one I saw who actually went out and talked to the musicians who were playing at the wedding (!), many of whom were killed, but a couple of whom survived. There is simply no doubt that there was a wedding going on, despite whoever else may also have been in town. And no doubt that the United States armed forces didn't, and don't, give a damn who they kill when they drop their bombs, as long as they have some kind of "story" at the ready.

Followup: An even more complete picture from the Guardian . 11 of the dead were women and 14 were children, and many of the dead were killed by individual rifle shots from American soldiers, not from the bombing .

I have to agree that the evidence collected proves nothing

I would be surprised if no money or weapons were found

This is just one more piece of evidence that the Bush Administration has no idea who they are fighting

Are you under the mistaken impression that this is a law-enforcement operation?

This is a war. Please try to remember that.

While you're at it, you might give some thought to deciding which side you're on.

The laws of war do not permit the bombing of civilians. Nor the bombing of buildings which you "think" might harbor "bad guys" without having even inquired into who else might be inside. Bombing an unknown building in a civilian area in a time of war is a war crime, not an act of war.

The apocalyptic struggle Bush supporters are enjoying from their living rooms is nothing less than a slaughter. There never was a threat and there is no justification for what's being done.

The moral relativism of Bush supporters is disgusting. I fully expect them to call military personnel malingerers when they get sick after exposure to chemotoxins and unsafe vaccinations -- just as they did after Gulf War 1 and the Vietnam war.

1. There is no such thing as "the laws of war." There are a few treaties and a number of traditions. These do not comprise a body of law.

2. The traditions of war most certainly do permit the bombing of civilians. If a civilian is standing next to, say, a terrorist safe-house, that civilian is going to die.

Bombing an unknown building in a civilian area in a time of war is a war crime, not an act of war.

There was nothing unknown about it. You think they just guessed? Oh, wait, silly me. Of course you do. You're radical leftist freaks.

There never was a threat

Even the most cursory count of innocents murdered by al-Qaida and al-Qaida linked groups adds up to over 3,800. No threat? More than 3,800 people brutally murdered by terrorists, and there's no threat?

Reasonable people can disagree on the right way to face the Islamist threat. It takes a real fool to deny that there was ever a t

I just saw your "followup" in which you claim that there were 11 women and 14 children killed in the attack. CNN is now reporting that there were 6 women there and no children.

Gee, which is more likely? That the duly elected, democratic, rigidly checked government of the United States of America is lying, or that terrorists and thugs are lying? Which of those sounds more likely?

Unfortunately, to a lot of you people*, the answer is the former.

* By "you people" I'm referring to the leftest of the left. You guys, and I think you know who you are, are so far left you've gone all the way back around to the right. Your hatred of the United States and everything it stands for is so great that you align and ally yourselves with theocratic fascists and murderers.

Oh, one other thing. I can't help but notice that absent from the radical agitprop being circulated on sites like this one is the news that today, for the first time in weeks, there were no combatants at all on the streets of Karbala.

The murders--al-Qaida, Monotheism and Jihad Group, whatever they want to call themselves--are being marginalized. The people of Iraq, even those who are unhappy with temporary Coalition governance, are abjuring violence and turning onto the path of peace.

Today's car bombing in Baghdad? Perpetrated by a Syrian.

Things are improving steadily in Iraq, and it's just making you people seethe.

Your credibility was shot in the thread where you referenced an article and then denied its conclusions. What few shreds were left blew away when you deliberately changed "laws" to "traditions". Sifitng through the rest of your innuendos and adolescent hypotheticals is waste of time. Go home little boy. No one but a wingnut keyboard warrior would find you at all persuasive.

Why? Is it not possible for the fact to be right but the inferences wrong?

What few shreds were left blew away when you deliberately changed "laws" to "traditions".

Well, DUH. Of course it was deliberate. That's exactly the point I was making. What Eli calls "the laws of war" is just some treaties and a thousand years of military tradition. And it doesn't lead to the conclusion that Eli reached.

What he really should have said was that he doesn't think that "the laws of war" should allow these things. Which is a fine argument, but not the one he was making.

Sifitng through the rest of your innuendos and adolescent hypotheticals is waste of time.

Nice. In other words, "Damn, he's got me. Better just insult him and run."

Over 40 people die in a US airstrike/invasion. Insurgents or civilians or both? Instead of an apology, we get massacre apologists who will never take responsibility for their murderous actions. The illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq has left thousands of innocent Iraqis dead, and this is just the latest batch of them to be liberated from their bodies. There is no point in trying to argue with the warmongers. They are best ignored.

Instead of an apology

Wait a sec. You want the United States to apologize for killing terrorists?

I don't see that happening.

The illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq

It was neither.

There is no point in trying to argue with the warmongers. They are best ignored.

That's fine. If you aren't interested in participating in the democratic process, just sit there and shut up and let us run the show for a while. Trust me: the country and the world will be better off for it.

Brains, you imbue us with the spirit of camaraderie, free from the old concepts of class and ancestry, with the spirit of community, of the sacrifice of each for the other, of the spirit to accept privation for the sake of an idea, of the spirit that values truth above appearance. For that, and more, I thank you.

A hanky, one of my comrades, please. I have been moved to tears by the nobility of Brains' screed in defense of the democratic process. Yes, I officially renounce our plot to adulterate the nation's precious bodily fluids. Labor theory of value? Feh, I now say. I never understood until today the sheer rightness of what Brains does, and what is done by other rough men, sacrificing all to guard us as we sleep.

I didn't mean it about the bodily fluids, by the way. I was having a nice glass of ice tea and it just kind of slipped out. In this context, some mention of fiber would probably be more appropriate.
