Julie, just a gentle word of warning.  Your post steps over the line of what
is welcome here.  We will enjoy hearing about your quilting or, in an OT
post,  just about anything else but ads need to be posted at
rec.crafts.textiles.marketplace. We are an easy-going group but we get right
cranky when someone only shows up to sell us something.   Polly

&gt; Hello-this is one of the first times I wrote on a discussion board but
&gt; I have gotten some useful information from this one!!  I am writing to
&gt; let you quilters know about our stencils.  We have metal quilt
&gt; stencils and Mini patchwork embellishments that add a special look to
&gt; quilting.  You can use fabric ink with them and heat set them.  If you
&gt; are interested our web is www.countrystencils.com .  Let me know if you
&gt; have any questions-I know a lot about stenciling-I just purchased this
&gt; business from my mother and it has been going since 1982.  Hope to
&gt; hear from some of you!!  Julie
