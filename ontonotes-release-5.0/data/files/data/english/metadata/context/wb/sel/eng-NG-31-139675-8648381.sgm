My quest to play and ascend the lamest class possible seems to settle
on the healer (at least an archaeologist can use a dwarvish mattock).

I can play them to 10-12th level fairly reliably but without some kind
of providence I usually get them killed off around that time. Lately
I've had a stingy RNG that has given me a magic lamp about every third
game, no gratuitous WoWs, no wands of poly, no coaligned altar in
Minetown, a shortage of scummable altars in general, rarely any decent
armor, and even weirdly bad combinations of shops. A couple of games
ago I didn't find a store that sold scrolls until around DL 15 - so I
couldn't even identify &quot;identify&quot; - or any other scroll - without
risking amnesia. That was really, really miserable. Being a mostly
illiterate healer is exasperating.

Playing a healer is enjoyable to me because it's challenging, but at
the same time it's a pretty grim slog, because unless you catch a
break, everything's the hard way. You're weak, the armor/spellcasting
balance is tricky and unfavorable, the offering weapons are not great
(except for Magicbane) and weapons in general suck, and so on.  It's
kind of depressing that except for Magicbane, none of the offering
weapons can be used beyond basic skill. Ranged attacks? You're stuck
with daggers - which would be okay, except that finding a decent stack
of elven daggers takes time, and you can throw a max of 2/turn. (Can't
a doctor take up archery as a hobby?!?)

I don't mess with protection racket unless I find good spellcasting
armor right away, in which case I creep along behind my pet down to
Minetown as quickly as possible, casting the occasional healing spell
on him as necessary.

I hate seeing that useless 'a' next to &quot;knife&quot; in #enhance, so I
usually start with bare hands until I have a dagger.

Anyway, I am curious to hear what other people do with healers. Are
they just annoying to play? I guess I like them because they're so
lame.

You're not alone having trouble getting far with
healers. In my current logfile's 206 healer
attempts, I've made it exactly once as far as DLVL
13, and a cockatrice corpse got me there.

I think you are way underestimating healers, though,
when you call them &quot;lame&quot;.

It takes pretty incredibly bad luck to _prevent_ a
healer from doing both Sokoban and Mines Town at
XL:1, and thus ending up with a naked AC usually
_better than_ AC:1, what with having extra money to
donate past the first easy 9 AC improvement points.

You have going for you:

1) a fistfull of healing potions to instantly bring
your HP up to 25 or more

2) the ability to cast Healing and Extra Healing on
your pets _and_ you

3) the stethoscope to keep constant track of your
pets' health

4) at least a few /Sleep charges to avoid gaining XP
in the tightest situations

5) a big wad of zorkmids with which to jump start
credit cloning

6) you start the game with the most immediately
important intrinsic, poison resistance.

Really, really obsess about zorkmids, because you
plan to show up at the Mines town altar richer than
Croesus and still at XL:1, letting you buy
protection at 400z a pop.

So even a few extra zorkmids make for an extra
donation attempt: with the help of a couple of
lucre-rich bones files, I once got to make over 50
donation attempts in Mines Town alone, ending up
with a naked AC:-4 with no help from prayers.

Manage your pets well (and accumulate several buff
ones), and you'll thrive to the point where you've
accumulated enchanted armor and a really good AC,
just on Mines levels death drops.

The one thing I've found _really_ important is not
to treat the protection racket like a race, but
instead like a very self-assured stroll where you
_know_ your skill managing your pets, and all the
resources a healer has to assist that, keeps all
your problems small.

Let your pets BUC-test _everything_, and try on all
uncursed armor, there are some really lously armor
types that look a lot better at +5 enchantment when
you find them on the floor.

Take time to explore every level thoroughly for
objects and treasure and sessile monsters.

Find a few shops to bankrupt, and credit clone your
way to riches and a wealth of objects, some even
useful.

Get a pick-axe, then go back to find and empty every
vault you heard on the way down.

Get a few potions of object detection from nymphs
unlucky enough to approach your pets or find you on
Sokoban, and check each level for buried gold and
gems.

Let your pets clean out the Sokoban treasure zoo for
you so you can avoid unwanted XPs.

You're a spellcaster, so rubblize the Oracle level
statues looking for spellbooks.

Once you've gotten good AC in Mines Town, level up
_very slowly_ to keep down the monster HD levels you
and more importantly your pets must face.

Don't gain an XL until you have all of: the AC,
intrinsics, spells, and weapons, to face the
monsters gaining it implies.

Eventually, altar camp somewhere for artifacts
and/or more spell books.

Healers are doable, I think, but they're surely an
acquired taste.

After playing healers for a while, and learning to
take advantage of their inherent benefits, though,
all the _other_ classes start to look much harder
than healers are.

That's probably why 30% or so of my logfile
games were played as healers, my default
class.

True. I've been posting to Usenet since 1985 or so,
that's pretty much convicted me by my own actoins of
tolerating tedium just a bit better than God.

We're opposite there, I rarely stick to an altar
for even a dozen turns, though I may return to it
for BUC IDing several times, but I'm constantly on
the hunt for the odd zorkmid.

That 20,000z is not really the big obstacle you make
it out to be. A richest-possible  Mines Town can
contain 16,000z just in shopkeeper's wallets. Find
one more richest-possible shop elsewhere in the main
dungeon in a round trip to Sokoban, and you've got
20,000z already.

More realistically to make up for shopkeeper
shortfalls from their maximum 4,000z, you've got
several vaults, lots of gold death-dropped by the
Mines dwarf population, little stacks of gold
covered in dust bunnies almost everywhere, gold in
the Dungeon and Mines rocks or buried beneath them,
gold in the Sokoban treasure zoo, and on and on.

Getting gold is easy if you aren't running a
footrace as your version of the protection racket,
because at least several monsters killed by your
pets will death-drop gold, too, and the slower you
go, the more such death-drops there will be.

As for managing pets, I find that one of the game's
most interesting aspects. It takes a real lover of
tedium to specialize in cat herding, I suppose.

More my style:

Find huge armor shop on DL2.  95% usual crap, but snag robe (saving
for later), displacement cloak, speed boots.  Wander into mines (also
from DL2).  Dog dies immediately somewhere in darkness.  No problem;
not AC8 any more, fast and AC3 instead, soldier on carefully, kill
gnomes and dwarves, collect daggers.  Arrive at grotto Minetown.  Make
kitten friend, speed teach hunting.  Test random wand; is polymorph.
Still in Minetown, XL8, kitty 72HP maxed, decide to revisit main
dungeon before doing mines in earnest.  Back to huge shop to make
better armor.  Forget what shopkeep does when goods are polymorphed.
Adopt wait and see attitude.  Pile couple dozen items in row, zap.
Kalecik is enraged!  Zaps twice!  Examine self, no smoking holes.  Oh,
am wearing cloak!  More zaps!  More misses!  Move into line with keep,
now, my turn to zap.  Kalecik the red naga hatchling bites!

No taming scroll handy, so enjoy snack of red naga hatchling sashimi.

I usually don't bother with that, because by the time I have got hold

gifted sword, and don't want to waste the proficiencies on the fair-to-

Exercises for a NH beginner: Healer
&lt; http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thr... &gt;
Topi adds some advice in a follow-up post.

More here, which was also a response to a post of yours:
&lt; http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thr... &gt;

Advanced role and race spoiler.  You'll have to search down to
&quot;*** Healer&quot; section.
&lt; http://www.mindspring.com/~jove/Spoilers/arr-343.txt &gt;

Skill slot management and weapons for Healers are a nightmare.  This
may be intentional.  The staff of Aesculapius is two-handed.  That
means no shield (Up to +9 AC) and can be a deathtrap in Gehennom if
cursed.

The staff also turns to junk from Gehennom on as more and more
monsters are level-drain resistant.  Must be wielded for hungerless
regeneration.  Must be #invoked for healing.  The Wizard will try to
steal it.  (I want to like the Staff.  I just can't.  Blame the
DevTeam for making it a deathtrap.)

I disagree with the zero-sum assertion anyway. Nevermind my personal
experience, which is that the games where I ascended were pretty fast
and loose (with attention paid to a few important details), but you
can read 100s of ascension posts that at least sound like fun. And
some that were a chore of course.

And yet Magicbane breaks the game if you get it, thus giving you a huge
risk-to-reward ratio if you get near an altar.

As far as armor/spellcasting balance -- stop trying to balance them.
Wear the armor; you can wear the same armor as anyone else in the game,
including a Barbarian.  Do so; your spells are only for non-combat use
until you find a better source of Pw.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It isn't necessary to use an artifact to win, nor do you need an
artifact to get to your OWN artifact, which is world-class and you just
happen to be Expert in.

Before then, Healers can become &quot;skilled&quot; in the following weapons:
dagger, short sword, club, sling, dart, shuriken.

Healers can become &quot;Expert&quot; in the following weapons:
knife, quarterstaff, dart, and unicorn horn.

Given that the Healer has no skills to speak of worth advancing past 'Basic'

Only the following monsters are level-drain resistant:

all undead, all demons, all werefoo, and Death.

Undead and demons respect Elbereth, and as such it doesn't matter how
long it takes you to kill them by beating them to death with a +7 staff.
You can also just use Elbereth to go around them, as they'll start
running away and leave you space to move.

Werefoo are not worth mentioning, leaving Death the only problem.

Far more monsters in Gehennom are _not_ level-drain resistant, and the
Staff is a murderous death machine against those.  Wield it and win.

The Staff is far from a deathtrap; it's one of the best weapons in the game.

Well... that's a tricky one.  Many of the most effective strategies
involve removing any interaction with large portions of the game.  This
reduces any 'fun' that might be gained during those portions, since
you're not actually playing them, you're just passing them by.

But certainly parts of the game (the early- and mid-game, for example)
are definitely still fun, even if you are using the &quot;most effective&quot;
strategies available -- and as such, you most certainly can &quot;play for
fun _and_ to win&quot;.

You can turn Nethack into a chore through a number of methods, most of
which involve ridiculous overpreparation and focusing on the wrong things
in the pursuit of winning.  But that takes player intent; it's not
inherently a part of the game, that it _has_ to be boring.

&gt; &gt;I can play them to 10-12th level fairly reliably but without some kind
&gt; &gt;of providence I usually get them killed off around that time. Lately
&gt; &gt;I've had a stingy RNG that has given me a magic lamp about every third
&gt; &gt;game, no gratuitous WoWs, no wands of poly, no coaligned altar in
&gt; &gt;Minetown, a shortage of scummable altars in general, rarely any decent
&gt; &gt;armor, and even weirdly bad combinations of shops. A couple of games
&gt; &gt;ago I didn't find a store that sold scrolls until around DL 15 - so I
&gt; &gt;couldn't even identify &quot;identify&quot; - or any other scroll - without
&gt; &gt;risking amnesia. That was really, really miserable. Being a mostly
&gt; &gt;illiterate healer is exasperating.

&gt; &gt;Playing a healer is enjoyable to me because it's challenging, but at
&gt; &gt;the same time it's a pretty grim slog, because unless you catch a
&gt; &gt;break, everything's the hard way. You're weak, the armor/spellcasting
&gt; &gt;balance is tricky and unfavorable, the offering weapons are not great
&gt; &gt;(except for Magicbane) and weapons in general suck, and so on.  It's
&gt; &gt;kind of depressing that except for Magicbane, none of the offering
&gt; &gt;weapons can be used beyond basic skill. Ranged attacks? You're stuck
&gt; &gt;with daggers - which would be okay, except that finding a decent stack
&gt; &gt;of elven daggers takes time, and you can throw a max of 2/turn. (Can't
&gt; &gt;a doctor take up archery as a hobby?!?)

&gt; &gt;I don't mess with protection racket unless I find good spellcasting
&gt; &gt;armor right away, in which case I creep along behind my pet down to
&gt; &gt;Minetown as quickly as possible, casting the occasional healing spell
&gt; &gt;on him as necessary.

&gt; &gt;I hate seeing that useless 'a' next to &quot;knife&quot; in #enhance, so I
&gt; &gt;usually start with bare hands until I have a dagger.

&gt; &gt;Anyway, I am curious to hear what other people do with healers. Are
&gt; &gt;they just annoying to play? I guess I like them because they're so

Yes.  2-handers are just asking for trouble, even artifacts--
eliminating easily avoided problems is important in nethack,
especially ones that require you to actively check in after particular
messages with no warning (e.g. blessed status of the Staff).

More importantly, it's a kind of crappy weapon since against drain-

Hmm, I just checked my YAAP for my one (out of two attempts) NAO
healer, and I used the Staff almost exclusively after the Quest,
keeping MagicBane for curse avoidance only after killing Rodney. Of
course, this ascension was greatly aided by an early wand of wishing,
but that didn't affect my weapon choice; I didn't wish for any
artifacts, and I had several other weapons to choose from that had
been granted pre-quest. I didn't bother with the protection racket
either, and kept vegetarian conduct FWIW.

Well, it's certainly good enough to ascend with--pretty much every
weapon is.  On the Planes and Astral it's pretty nice (except vs.
death), but in Gehennom it's slow going at times.  Personally I prefer
a saber--free hand for a shield, better against the tough stuff in
Gehennom, not prone to Rodney theft, and I'm rarely fighting things in
the planes/astral.  If you finish the Quest before the Castle, the
Staff is really nice through the main dungeon; I rarely have XL14 by
then, though.

I have a pretty set strategy in mind when I start, however I know many
people don't like it because it involves wearing metal armor.*

Upon starting the game, I immediately quaff any b !oEH for HP.  I let
my pet kill off most critters, and make my primary goal obtaining a
mithril armor and other good armors.  Protection racket for me is a
toss-up.  Most of the time I don't bother with it (as I don't like to
unnecessarily risk the lives of my early baby Healers), but if the
sun, Jupiter and Saturn are aligned just so, I may attempt it.  Once I
obtain decent armor (yes, I wear metal armor on a healer), I find that
I don't need to heal myself as frequently as before.  So now I am able
to wear my armor in battle, then remove my armor only (as my heal
success rate with iron shoes/hard hat equipped usually is still very
good), heal myself and my pet back to full, then gear myself back up
for battle.  The use of mithril for my healers is only to survive
early game; I will trade it in for leather once I've gotten my natural
AC fairly low.

As for my weapon, I've primarily used my scalpel (only to advance my
knife for my future weapon, crysknife), however as of late I've taken
a liking to daggers.  I strongly recommend the dagger route over the
scalpel -&gt; crysknife.  While the crysknife is a great weapon, the
scalpel is just too weak to really fight monsters such as leocrattas.
As others have mentioned, the unicorn horn is also another great
alternative.  The only thing not to do, is to try to advance all of
these at once.

If necessary, I will intentionally level drain myself later ingame
after I have obtained the Staff, so I can re-allocate my skill points
that were previously used in unicorn horn or knife.  I find by that
point, gaining my levels back is not an issue at all.

Facing Cyclops: The level beneath Cyclops, I engrave a permanent
Elbereth (or hard-engrave into the floor if I don't have a perm E
method by then), go upstairs, wake up Cyclops, go back downstairs and
duke it out with him.  Sleep works wonders on him as well (which I'll
have to do sans-E on sporkhack, since lorimer the pikachu is the devil
incarnate and made all Quest nemesis ignore Elbereth u_u!!) Once I
have the staff in my hands, the game is pretty much in the bag.

I wish you luck on your quest to play and ascend one of the most
underrated classes possible, the Healer.

*Disclaimer: this is just the way I've played my healers.  I am not
claiming it is the best way, but it does work for me.  Please don't

You're on the right track. The objective is to get that AC down until

Wearing metal armor is a good strategy in the early game. It improves
your likelyhood of surviving.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Upon starting the game, I immediately quaff any b !oEH for HP.

Personally I would delay. There are usually between 4 and 8 max HP that
can be blessed on you from your god if you simply use a bit of strategy
and patience. You god will add max HP for you if you are currently below
5HP, have less than 16 max HP @ XL1 or 21 @ XL2, and can pray. It's
considered major trouble and will always be granted.

So when I know I can pray (which is at turn 300) I stand next to a newt
or jackal and let them peck away until I get under 5HP, then pray. Often
I can go a couple of rounds at XL1 and then get another round at XL2
sometimes if I'm still below 21 HP by the time I get to XL2. Then and
only then will I quaff the blessed !oEH.

It's SOP for me. I'm not in any hurry about it though. Usually I'll
wander the dungeon up to DL5 or so, buffing the pet and cleaning out any
shops I come across. I also will BUC test and put on any armor I happen
across too. Getting an non cursed hard helment is essential for dealing
with falling rock traps in the mines.

With a healer it's pretty simple to maintain oneself and the pet during
this phase. You know exactly how many HP the critter has and can cast
healing when they get low. Also healer money makes it for efficient for
cleaning out shops since you're already starting with a good initial
stash. Personally I credit clone, but even having the pet steal and
redrop items wouldn't take too terribly long.

&gt;Once I
&gt;obtain decent armor (yes, I wear metal armor on a healer),
">

All spellcasters need to wear metal armor in the early game. Lowering
one's AC is essential for survival. Eventually you'll get enchanted
armor and dragon scale, which provides lower AC without the spellcasting
penalty. Also I specifically run tthe protection racket to get the
opportunity to trade heavy metal, spellkilling armor for divine
protection.

&gt;I find that
&gt;I don't need to heal myself as frequently as before.  So now I am able
&gt;to wear my armor in battle, then remove my armor only (as my heal
&gt;success rate with iron shoes/hard hat equipped usually is still very
&gt;good), heal myself and my pet back to full, then gear myself back up
&gt;for battle.
">

I let the pet battle. The armor is strictly defensive for me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The use of mithril for my healers is only to survive
&gt;early game; I will trade it in for leather once I've gotten my natural
&gt;AC fairly low.
">

Bingo. Eventually you trade up to dragon scale. With enchantment, divine
protection and dragon scale it easily possible to get into the mid -20s
in the AC department without any spellcasting penalty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As for my weapon, I've primarily used my scalpel (only to advance my
&gt;knife for my future weapon, crysknife), however as of late I've taken
&gt;a liking to daggers.  I strongly recommend the dagger route over the
&gt;scalpel -&gt; crysknife.  While the crysknife is a great weapon, the
&gt;scalpel is just too weak to really fight monsters such as leocrattas.
&gt;As others have mentioned, the unicorn horn is also another great
&gt;alternative.  The only thing not to do, is to try to advance all of
&gt;these at once.
">

Bingo. And if you some across a staff, you go ahead and advance it
because eventually you'll use the quest staff as a serious combat
weapon.

As for one of the other poster, healers are primarily spellcasters. So
ranged spellcasting should certainly be on the agenda.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If necessary, I will intentionally level drain myself later ingame
&gt;after I have obtained the Staff, so I can re-allocate my skill points
&gt;that were previously used in unicorn horn or knife.  I find by that
&gt;point, gaining my levels back is not an issue at all.

&gt;Facing Cyclops: The level beneath Cyclops, I engrave a permanent
&gt;Elbereth (or hard-engrave into the floor if I don't have a perm E
&gt;method by then), go upstairs, wake up Cyclops, go back downstairs and
&gt;duke it out with him.  Sleep works wonders on him as well (which I'll
&gt;have to do sans-E on sporkhack, since lorimer the pikachu is the devil
&gt;incarnate and made all Quest nemesis ignore Elbereth u_u!!) Once I
&gt;have the staff in my hands, the game is pretty much in the bag.
">

It's been a long time since I've run a healer. But from what I remember
Cyclops wasn't too terribly tough.

Why should we? Great advise.

&gt;Is it your intent to sound patronizing?  Perhaps my objective is for
&gt;my healer to kill everything in its path, and then ascend.

&gt;If you could make an effort to sound more like a cohort and less like
&gt;a Dad, that would be appreciated, by me at least.

If exaplining why you think healers are lame is patronizing, then so be
it.

It was clear from your post that you think they are lame because they
don't have a lot of offensive firepower.

That doesn't make them lame. It just means you have to play them
differently that combat wombats.

&gt; My quest to play and ascend the lamest class possible seems to settle
&gt; on the healer (at least an archaeologist can use a dwarvish mattock).

&gt; I can play them to 10-12th level fairly reliably but without some kind
&gt; of providence I usually get them killed off around that time. Lately
&gt; I've had a stingy RNG that has given me a magic lamp about every third
&gt; game, no gratuitous WoWs, no wands of poly, no coaligned altar in
&gt; Minetown, a shortage of scummable altars in general, rarely any decent
&gt; armor, and even weirdly bad combinations of shops. A couple of games
&gt; ago I didn't find a store that sold scrolls until around DL 15 - so I
&gt; couldn't even identify &quot;identify&quot; - or any other scroll - without
&gt; risking amnesia. That was really, really miserable. Being a mostly
&gt; illiterate healer is exasperating.

&gt; Playing a healer is enjoyable to me because it's challenging, but at
&gt; the same time it's a pretty grim slog, because unless you catch a
&gt; break, everything's the hard way. You're weak, the armor/spellcasting
&gt; balance is tricky and unfavorable, the offering weapons are not great
&gt; (except for Magicbane) and weapons in general suck, and so on.  It's
&gt; kind of depressing that except for Magicbane, none of the offering
&gt; weapons can be used beyond basic skill. Ranged attacks? You're stuck
&gt; with daggers - which would be okay, except that finding a decent stack
&gt; of elven daggers takes time, and you can throw a max of 2/turn. (Can't
&gt; a doctor take up archery as a hobby?!?)

&gt; I don't mess with protection racket unless I find good spellcasting
&gt; armor right away, in which case I creep along behind my pet down to
&gt; Minetown as quickly as possible, casting the occasional healing spell
&gt; on him as necessary.

&gt; I hate seeing that useless 'a' next to &quot;knife&quot; in #enhance, so I
&gt; usually start with bare hands until I have a dagger.

&gt; Anyway, I am curious to hear what other people do with healers. Are
&gt; they just annoying to play? I guess I like them because they're so
&gt; lame.

The Healer has only one Weapon his pet. You need to use it.
You should play the protection racket in Pacifist mode a few times
till you can reach minetown intact without killing anything.
You will learn how to use your pet and patience along the way.

Remember playing recklessly and then dying is not a lot of fun.
Surviving is.

Disclaimer: I have not ascended a Healer, but my strategy is now
common to all games.

The strategy I use is to complete the Sokoban with the help of pets.
Till this time don't waste time other than exploring and buying any
useful tools or armor from the shops. Don't try to id, or sac or do
anything that might waste time.

Try not to kill anything that your pet can. That leaves floating eyes
and the giant mimics in the top floor of Sokoban. As healer it would
be better to zap the mimic with sleep and your pet with healing.

At the end of Sokoban you should be about 6XL. Before Sokoban
you should be at least 3XL, depending on your circumstances.
I generally gain one XL every three levels.

With Stethoscope and healing spells and stone to flesh you should
have a large number of pets. Keep the ones that you can enlarge
close.

Then return while credit cloning and price-iding all shops found, and
proceed to the mines. You should have enough gold for the minetown
priest, in most cases.

After this it becomes fairly straight forward. You will have found a
unicorn horn by this time use it as your weapon, enhancing it to
Skilled. You should never become expert in a weapon or spell unless
you are getting any added benefit. 1 point of extra damage is useless,
compared to the 3 levels of XL. So become expert only in darts.

Incidentally, the staff is good only till Liches start appearing. But
till
that time you should have your luck maximized, and you can get
long sword unrestricted by sacrifice, so wielding a long sword
(possibly
an artifact) is not a bad option. While throwing expert blessed +7
poisoned darts provides a very quick kill. You could as well be
empty handed.
