i have gotten really interested in growing plants in my tank, but when
i set it up i had no idea that this would happen.  so i don't have
fluorite or eco-complete as a substrate, just regular old gravel.
(the tank is 36&quot; wide and 30 gallons)

i have since upgraded my lighting to 3 36&quot; 6700 t5 bulbs that are
rated at 21 watts each (63 total watts).  these bulbs are in two
fixtures that i believe are made by coralife.  i have also added a DIY
co2 generator, but without any kind of diffuser.  i just bubble it in
to the tank.

i have a couple of different plants in the tank, and here is my
results with them:

1) amazon swords - these have been faring the poorest out of all my
plants.  i think they really need nutrients at the roots, which i am
not providing.  when i added co2, they got much greener and seemed to
perk up, but they just aren't doing as well as all the other plants.

2) riccia - this is doing extremely well.  i have it hairnetted to a
rock arch, and it just grows and grows.  i have probably 3 times what
i started with.

3) java moss - this is also doing extraordinarily well.  doubled in
size at least.

4) java fern - hasn't grown much yet, but i do seem some small new
leaves starting up

5) baby tears - i keep this one in the little plastic pot it came in,
and it is growing like a champ.  even the pieces that it loses from
time to time float and continue to grow.  i wonder if it would root in
the gravel if i were to remove it from the pots.

6) anubias - i have a bud, but it hasn't opened yet.  i have one new
leaf.  this one is also in a pot, and the roots are growing
considerably.

7) foxtail - this one is probably doing the best out of all my
plants.  i got a few almost dead stalks of it for free, and it has
taken off.  i now have 8 groups of plants that are all descended from
the original almost dead parts.  it grows visibly from when i go to
work in the morning and when i come home at night.  it has also
developed an extensive root system in the gravel.

8) wisteria - this was doing very poorly until i added co2.  now it is
growing very well.  it has some roots in the gravel.

9) duckweed - this came with one of the other plants, and is growing
all over the place now.  i don't think there was more than a couple
little floaters when it first got in there, but i'm going to work on
getting it back out again.

i think i have been lucky in that i picked plants that get most of
their nutrients from the water, not the roots.  clearly, the java moss
and riccia don't even have roots.

everywhere you read about how there needs to be light, good substrate
and co2, but i think that if you didn't plan to set up a planted tank,
you can certainly get away with plain gravel if you get the right
plants and set up the lighting and possibly co2 (or liquid carbon)
properly.

i've considered putting the baby tears, java fern and the anubias on
some driftwood so that they can attach and possibly get nutrients from
the wood.  would this be worth it, and if so, should i get a piece of
wood for each, or one big piece and attach them all to it?

any comments?

15 years ago, plain gravel is all we had.  LOL!

Do you have fine gravel, or is it the big, epoxy coated stuff?  API
makes &quot;plant plugs&quot;, cubes of rock wool.  They're great for growing
plants that need to root in coarse pea gravel.

Use a good tablet fertilizer.  The Hagen Nutragro plant spikes are
excellent.  Laterite pellets or tablets buried in the gravel help
too.  A trick from Diana Walstad to get laterite into gravel is to
make laterite mud and freeze it.  You can poke the bits of laterite
ice into the substrate.

Baby tears needs to root.  It won't do well on driftwood.  Java fern
does better on driftwood than planted, and Anubias is good for
driftwood.  The size and arrangement of the wood is an aquascaping
decision.  Keep in mind that java fern grows very fast with CO2 and
will try to take over its piece driftwood and then the tank.  ;-)

pretty much what altum said... I think gravel (of any kind) is about
the only place duckweed WON'T grow. It sounds like you are doing
pretty darn well. I have kept amazon swords in plain ol' gravel with
no fert tabs or anything. They survived pretty OK, I have since moved
them to substrate for planted tanks (eco complete and flourite
(different tanks)) and they are doing much better. Maybe pictures
would help your plants grow (OK maybe not but I love pictures).

One of my display tanks, a 20H, has ordinary course river gravel and no
special substrate. It's lit with a simple strip light containing 2 13 watt
screw-in fluorescents. The tank is lush with green. Amazon swords,
valisneria, java fern, cryptocoryne, etc. Your swords will benefit from root
feeding tablets, I use Flourish, a tablet jabbed an inch or two into the
gravel 2 or 3 inches away from the main plant stem, a tab on each side. I
add a capful of Leafzone potassium and iron a couple of times a month. Keep
some nitrates in your water and enjoy the green.

most grass type plants and swords can grow with out any kind of
special substrate

also if you have a plant that requires special stuff you can tie it
down to a piece of wood

my gravel is natural and &quot;pea sized&quot; i think, but you can get a better
look at it in this picture:
http://groups.google.com/group/The-Freshwater-Aquarium/web/IMG_2909.JPG

you can see that the sword leaves over on the right are in bad shape.
i'm going to trim it back tonight, but i figured i'd get a picture
before i did.

That looks like it might be a macrophyllus sword.  If not it's a
radicans.  Both types are a little difficult to grow submersed.  In
the wild, they grow in shallow water or bogs with their leaves held up
above the water's surface.  That browning isn't really nutrient
deficiency.  It looks more like emersed foliage that's falling apart
underwater.

Try replacing it with a plain Amazon sword or one of the colorful
varieties like ozelot or rubin that grow better submersed.

&gt; &gt; Baby tears root very well in fine gravel.  I don't know about coarser
&gt; &gt; stuff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 6) anubias - i have a bud, but it hasn't opened yet.  i have one new
&gt; &gt; &gt; leaf.  this one is also in a pot, and the roots are growing
&gt; &gt; &gt; considerably.

&gt; &gt; Anubias couldn't care less about where its roots are.  It does well
&gt; &gt; both planted and tied to driftwood.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 7) foxtail - this one is probably doing the best out of all my
&gt; &gt; &gt; plants.  i got a few almost dead stalks of it for free, and it has
&gt; &gt; &gt; taken off.  i now have 8 groups of plants that are all descended from
&gt; &gt; &gt; the original almost dead parts.  it grows visibly from when i go to
&gt; &gt; &gt; work in the morning and when i come home at night.  it has also
&gt; &gt; &gt; developed an extensive root system in the gravel.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 8) wisteria - this was doing very poorly until i added co2.  now it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; growing very well.  it has some roots in the gravel.

&gt; &gt; Stem plants like their CO2!

&gt; &gt; &gt; 9) duckweed - this came with one of the other plants, and is growing
&gt; &gt; &gt; all over the place now.  i don't think there was more than a couple
&gt; &gt; &gt; little floaters when it first got in there, but i'm going to work on
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting it back out again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; i think i have been lucky in that i picked plants that get most of
&gt; &gt; &gt; their nutrients from the water, not the roots.  clearly, the java moss
&gt; &gt; &gt; and riccia don't even have roots.

&gt; &gt; &gt; everywhere you read about how there needs to be light, good substrate
&gt; &gt; &gt; and co2, but i think that if you didn't plan to set up a planted tank,
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can certainly get away with plain gravel if you get the right
&gt; &gt; &gt; plants and set up the lighting and possibly co2 (or liquid carbon)
&gt; &gt; &gt; properly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; i've considered putting the baby tears, java fern and the anubias on
&gt; &gt; &gt; some driftwood so that they can attach and possibly get nutrients from
&gt; &gt; &gt; the wood.  would this be worth it, and if so, should i get a piece of
&gt; &gt; &gt; wood for each, or one big piece and attach them all to it?

&gt; &gt; Baby tears needs to root.  It won't do well on driftwood.  Java fern
&gt; &gt; does better on driftwood than planted, and Anubias is good for
&gt; &gt; driftwood.  The size and arrangement of the wood is an aquascaping
&gt; &gt; decision.  Keep in mind that java fern grows very fast with CO2 and
&gt; &gt; will try to take over its piece driftwood and then the tank.  ;-)

Nice pic. Nice plants. Your sword plant could benefit from a weekly dose of
Leaf Zone, potassium and iron. Little holes in the leaves are a tell tale
sign of low potassium. I used to blame those holes on snails, but since I
began using Leaf Zone they are no longer a problem. You can buy iron and
potassium separately, but I like to keep the bottles of stuff to a minimum.
Less to remember. Less hassle.

I thought that was a funny subject line.  I've yet to find a plant
which didn't grow in a fine to medium gravel, even the epoxy-coated
stuff.  It's just a matter of time under reasonable conditions.  The
use of high light, CO2 and special substrates shouldn't be viewed as
requirements, but as facilitators to improve or accelerate growth
rates.  Only really coarse gravel seems to be a show-stopper (you have
to wait for so much mulm to fill the spaces, that it becomes a nitrate
factory in hard water, and acidifies soft water, both = OTS).

&gt; i have gotten really interested in growing plants in my tank, but when
&gt; i set it up i had no idea that this would happen.  so i don't have
&gt; fluorite or eco-complete as a substrate, just regular old gravel.
&gt; (the tank is 36&quot; wide and 30 gallons)

&gt; i have since upgraded my lighting to 3 36&quot; 6700 t5 bulbs that are
&gt; rated at 21 watts each (63 total watts).  these bulbs are in two
&gt; fixtures that i believe are made by coralife.  i have also added a DIY
&gt; co2 generator, but without any kind of diffuser.  i just bubble it in
&gt; to the tank.

&gt; i have a couple of different plants in the tank, and here is my
&gt; results with them:

&gt; 1) amazon swords - these have been faring the poorest out of all my
&gt; plants.  i think they really need nutrients at the roots, which i am
&gt; not providing.  when i added co2, they got much greener and seemed to
&gt; perk up, but they just aren't doing as well as all the other plants.

&gt; 2) riccia - this is doing extremely well.  i have it hairnetted to a
&gt; rock arch, and it just grows and grows.  i have probably 3 times what
&gt; i started with.

&gt; 3) java moss - this is also doing extraordinarily well.  doubled in
&gt; size at least.

&gt; 4) java fern - hasn't grown much yet, but i do seem some small new
&gt; leaves starting up

&gt; 5) baby tears - i keep this one in the little plastic pot it came in,
&gt; and it is growing like a champ.  even the pieces that it loses from
&gt; time to time float and continue to grow.  i wonder if it would root in
&gt; the gravel if i were to remove it from the pots.

&gt; 6) anubias - i have a bud, but it hasn't opened yet.  i have one new
&gt; leaf.  this one is also in a pot, and the roots are growing
&gt; considerably.

&gt; 7) foxtail - this one is probably doing the best out of all my

&gt; any comments?
