GOP Is Losing Grip On Core Business Vote

By JACKIE CALMES

WASHINGTON -- The Republican Party, known since the late 19th century as
the party of business, is losing its lock on that title.

New evidence suggests a potentially historic shift in the Republican
Party's identity -- what strategists call its &quot;brand.&quot; The votes of many
disgruntled fiscal conservatives and other lapsed Republicans are now up
for grabs, which could alter U.S. politics in the 2008 elections and
beyond.

Some business leaders are drifting away from the party because of the
war in Iraq, the growing federal debt and a conservative social agenda
they don't share. In manufacturing sectors such as the auto industry,
some Republicans want direct government help with soaring health-care
costs, which Republicans in Washington have been reluctant to provide.
And some business people want more government action on global warming,
arguing that a bolder plan is not only inevitable, but could spur new
industries. [Go to the slideshow]1

Already, economic conservatives who favor balanced federal budgets have
become a much smaller part of the party's base. That's partly because
other groups, especially social conservatives, have grown more dominant.
But it's also the result of defections by other fiscal conservatives
angered by the growth of government spending during the six years that
Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress.

The most prominent sign of dissatisfaction has come from former Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, long a pillar of Republican Party
economic thinking. He blasted the party's fiscal record in a new book.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, he said: &quot;The Republican
Party, which ruled the House, the Senate and the presidency, I no longer
recognize.&quot;

Some well-known business leaders have openly changed allegiances. Morgan
Stanley Chairman and Chief Executive John Mack, formerly a big Bush
backer, now supports Democratic front-runner Sen. Hillary Clinton of New
York. John Canning Jr., chairman and chief executive of Madison Dearborn
Partners, a large private-equity firm, now donates to Democrats after a
lifetime as a Republican. Recently, he told one Democratic Party leader:
&quot;The Republican Party left me&quot; -- a twist on a line Ronald Reagan and
his followers used when they abandoned the Democratic Party decades ago
to protest its '60s and '70s-era liberalism.

Concern for their fiscal reputation is reflected in the fights that
President Bush and congressional Republicans now are picking with the
new Democratic majority over annual appropriations and an expansion of a
children's health program, in hopes of placating party conservatives.

For all the disillusionment among Republicans, the party retains strong
support in many parts of the business community, in part because of
fears about the taxing and regulating tendencies of Democrats. Danny
Diaz, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, says, &quot;Americans
of every political persuasion that value hard work, keeping more
hard-earned dollars, and economic independence and entrepreneurship
will continue to stand behind the Republican Party.&quot;

BILL CLINTON ON THE GOP:

&quot;The Republicans that I liked -- like Eisenhower, even the early Nixon
- -- all those Republicans, they basically believed in fiscal
responsibility. And they believed therefore that you should pay taxes
for what you wanted to spend money on.&quot;

Polling Data

But polling data confirm business support for Republicans is eroding. In
the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in September, 37% of professionals
and managers identify themselves as Republican or leaning Republican,
down from 44% three years ago.

Richard Clinch, a 69-year-old New York native, illustrates the party's
plight. The retired Westinghouse manager and mechanical engineer says he
has been &quot;a lifelong Republican.&quot; As a young fiscal conservative, he was
attracted by the party's reputation for frugal and competent governance,
he says. The Democratic Party left him cold, he says, because of its
social spending and ties to the unions that exasperated him at work. As
a retiree in Annapolis, Md., he became a local Republican officer.

Yet next year, for the first time since he began voting in 1960, Mr.
Clinch won't support the Republican presidential nominee, he says. He
only &quot;very reluctantly&quot; voted for Mr. Bush's re-election in 2004. &quot;Like
many Republicans, I am frustrated,&quot; he says. &quot;We've lost control of
spending,&quot; and the administration's execution of the Iraq war has been
&quot;incompetent.&quot; Mr. Clinch says he is liberal about rights for women and
gays, and vexed that &quot;we [Republicans] get sidetracked on these issues
like gay marriage.&quot;

Jumping Parties

Such misgivings do not necessarily translate into long-term gains for
Democrats. Mr. Clinch says his two sons -- one a 50-year-old
ophthalmologist, the other a 42-year-old economist -- have both jumped
from the Republican to the Democratic Party. But Mr. Clinch isn't
necessarily voting Democratic. &quot;I think I'm becoming an independent,&quot; he
says. &quot;If I were 21 years old, I'd be an independent definitely.&quot;

For his part, Mr. Greenspan says he doubts he will vote for a Democrat
for president next year, because the party is moving &quot;in the wrong
direction,&quot; becoming more populist and protectionist.

Federal campaign-finance reports document shifting support in some
quarters of the business community. Hedge funds last year gave 77% of
their contributions in congressional races to Democrats, up from 71%
during the 2004 election, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonpartisan analyst of campaign finances. Last year the
securities industry gave 45% of its money to Republicans, down from 58%
in 1996, the center said.

&quot;You see it in the lack of donor support&quot; for Republican presidential
candidates, says longtime strategist John Weaver. As former top adviser
to presidential candidate and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Mr. Weaver
recalls hearing Republican businesspeople grouse about the party's
focus on moral issues and Iraq.

Overall, Democratic presidential candidates have raised more than $200
million this year, about 70% more than their Republican rivals.

Some of the most compelling evidence suggesting a redefinition of the
Republican Party comes from prominent Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio.
Earlier this year, he surveyed 2,000 Republican voters, updating his
similarly exhaustive poll of 10 years ago. In 1997, about half of
Republicans said they were motivated mainly by economic issues, and
about half by social and moral issues. This year, the culturally
conservative wing was roughly the same size, but economic conservatives
accounted for just one in six Republicans. In the wake of the 9/11
terrorist attacks, the ranks of Republicans whose main concern is
defense have grown after subsiding with the end of the Cold War.

The economic conservatives, Mr. Fabrizio found, are split into opposing
camps: &quot;free market&quot; conservatives opposed to any new taxes, spending
and regulations; and what he calls &quot;government-knows-best&quot; moderates,
who sometimes favor regulations and higher taxes for causes such as
education, environmental programs or infrastructure.

The once-dominant &quot;deficit hawks,&quot; who put balanced budgets ahead of tax
cuts (think former Sen. Robert Dole, or Mr. Bush's father), are all but
extinct. A quarter-century of infighting between those Republicans and
others who seek lower taxes regardless of deficits has been decisively
settled in the current Bush administration in favor of the tax cutters.

The result has been big tax cuts, and in the dozen years when the
Congress was under Republican control, big spending increases as well.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former Democrat
who left the Republican Party three months ago, complained Sunday at
Britain's Conservative Party conference that conservative politicians
in the U.S. were guilty of &quot;lunacy&quot; for running up deficits for future
taxpayers to pay.

Many old-school fiscal conservatives are also upset. Economist Bruce
Bartlett, a Treasury official in the Reagan years, recently commiserated
with like-minded conservatives on a blog. &quot;I haven't changed my
philosophical views in any significant way over the last 10 years, but
in the pre-Bush era, I felt comfortable in the Republican mainstream,&quot;
he wrote. &quot;Today, I don't really feel there is any significant element
of the Republican coalition where I am comfortable.&quot;

One glue holding the party together is that social conservatives often
share the goals of economic conservatives. Social conservatives
supported the Bush tax cuts and wanted to make them permanent. But
their priority, and what keeps them Republicans, is opposition to
abortion, gay rights and the like.

Some intraparty tension is rooted in cultural differences. Social
conservatives tend to be relatively lower-income, less educated,
concentrated in the South and West, and newer to the party than many
old-line Republicans of an economic or business bent. Each blames the
other for the party's current state -- often employing pejoratives such
as &quot;Bible-thumpers&quot; or &quot;country-club Republicans.&quot;

In Washington, Republican leaders' relations are no longer as cozy as
they once were with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's foremost
business group, with its temple-like headquarters facing the White
House. &quot;It's a much more complex relationship than it used to be,&quot; says
Chamber political director William Miller.

Funding Highways

For example, he says, the Chamber supports a higher gasoline tax if
revenues are dedicated to funding highways and bridges that truckers and
other businesses want, and to hold down deficits. But that has put the
Chamber at odds with antitax Republicans in Congress and the
administration. That split comes atop other tensions over trade and,
especially, immigration. As the party's base has shifted south and west,
it has become more protectionist and focused on secure borders. Business
generally favors free trade and liberal immigration laws that keep
workers coming and employer sanctions to a minimum.

Richard Cooper of Winnetka, Ill., a 67-year-old investor and former
chairman of Weight Watchers Inc., hasn't just switched parties -- he is
helping Sen. Clinton's campaign. An early Reaganite, he unsuccessfully
sought the Republican nomination for Illinois governor in 1976. He says
he has been alienated in recent years by Republican policies across the
board. A leader of the international &quot;Responsibility to Protect&quot; project
for global action against humanitarian crises, he opposes Bush foreign
policies. The father of a daughter with lupus, he wants funding for
stem-cell research, which antiabortion Republicans oppose.

As for fiscal policy, Mr. Cooper contends that &quot;Democrats are the new
conservatives.&quot; Republicans &quot;are still talking about tax cuts. It was
one thing when Ronald Reagan was doing it and the top [income-tax] rate
was about 80%. Now tax rates are reasonable. So what if I have to pay
5% more in taxes?&quot;

More Centrist

In last fall's midterm elections, rebellious Republicans and
Republican-leaning independents contributed to the Democrats' takeover
of Congress and a raft of state and local offices. The Democratic Party
had lured many newcomers through shifts of its own since the Reagan era.
Particularly under President Clinton, the party became more centrist and
fiscally conservative, espousing balanced budgets, targeted tax cuts and
free trade. Party liberals and unionists never fully accepted those
changes.

Yet the benefits to Democrats were evident in a Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll last July. When Americans were asked which party could better
deal with national problems, they gave Democrats an edge of 25
percentage points over Republicans on cutting deficits, 16 points on
controlling federal spending, 15 points on dealing with the economy, 9
points on taxes and 3 points on trade. &quot;We have lost our measurable
advantage on fiscal conservatism, and we have quite some ways to go to
get that back,&quot; says Terry Nelson, Mr. Bush's national political
director in 2004.

Mr. Clinton said in an interview that he often meets disillusioned
Republicans in his travels. &quot;They say, 'You know, I didn't vote for you,
and I didn't like the fact that you raised taxes on upper-income people
and corporations, but I did better when you were there. You produced a
better economy. You guys knew what you were doing.'&quot;

Such comments could be dismissed as self-serving, but Mr. Greenspan
offers a similar view in his new autobiography, &quot;The Age of Turbulence:
Adventures in a New World.&quot; Mr. Greenspan, who was President Ford's
chief economic adviser and Mr. Reagan's choice for the Fed, praises Mr.
Clinton for fighting for deficit reduction and free trade, over the
opposition of fellow Democrats and unions. &quot;A consistent, disciplined
focus on long-term economic growth became a hallmark of his
presidency,&quot; Mr. Greenspan writes. In recent years, his own party's
leaders, he writes, &quot;seemed readily inclined to loosen the federal
purse strings any time it might help add a few more seats to the
Republican majority.&quot;

Goldwater Republican

In an interview, Mr. Greenspan noted: &quot;I was brought up in the
Republican Party of [Barry] Goldwater. He was for fiscal restraint and
for deregulation, for open markets, for trade. Social issues were not a
critical factor.&quot; Today's Republican party, he added, has &quot;fundamentally
been focusing on how to maintain political power, and my question is,
for what purpose?&quot;

California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has lost some Republican Party
support because of his socially liberal stands and his proposals on
global warming and universal health care. But those stands have made
him more popular generally in the state, while his party is less so.
Last month, at the state Republicans' convention, he sounded an alarm.
Noting that California Republicans have lost 370,000 registered voters
since 2005, the former actor said, &quot;We are dying at the box office.&quot;
The voters that Republicans need, Mr. Schwarzenegger argued, &quot;often
hold conservative views on fiscal policy and law-and-order issues,
while taking more liberal stands on social and environmental issues.&quot;

Nationally, support for some Republican causes espoused by social
conservatives and hawks has declined in the general population as
Americans have grown more concerned about economic matters. Those were
the conclusions last spring of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center,
based on its latest surveys on Americans' political attitudes.

'Old-Fashioned Values'

Pew found that between 1987 and this year, for example, support for
&quot;old-fashioned values about family and marriage&quot; had dropped 11
percentage points. The percentage of those who said gay teachers should
be fired dropped 23 points, Pew said. Support for U.S. global
engagement and &quot;peace through military strength&quot; also shrank.

But the number of Americans who share some classic Democratic concerns
has risen. Three-quarters of the population is worried about growing
income inequality, Pew found, while two-thirds favor government-funded
health care for all. Support for a government safety net for the poor
is at its highest level since 1987, Pew said.

&quot;More striking,&quot; Pew concluded, was the change in party identification
since 2002. Five years ago, the population was evenly divided -- 43% for
each party. This year, Democrats had a 50% to 35% advantage.
