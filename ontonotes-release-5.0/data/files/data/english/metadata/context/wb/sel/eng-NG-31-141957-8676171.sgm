Kanye leads 50 Cent in CD sales face-off
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY, AP Music Writer

NEW YORK - 50 Cent may be getting hip-hop's equivalent of a gold watch
next week. Early reports have Kanye West beating 50 in their
much-hyped battle of album sales: West's &quot;Graduation&quot; is on pace to
sell about 575,000 to 700,000 its first week out, while 50 Cent's
&quot;Curtis&quot; is on track to do 550,000, according to Billboard magazine.

As of day one, Kanye had sold 437,000 copies to 50's 310,000,
according to Nielsen Soundscan.

Both albums came out Tuesday, and a confident 50 Cent famously
announced that he would retire if West outsold him in first-week
sales.

&quot;I just don't view him as competition based on our previous sales
histories,&quot; 50 Cent told The Associated Press last month.

But it looks as if 50 underestimated the power of West, and perhaps,
overestimated his own appeal.

&quot;I don't think it's helped 50 that so many of these prerelease singles
that have come out have fizzled on the charts right away,&quot; said
Jonathan Cohen, Billboard's senior editor. &quot;There were street date
changes. It has just not been a good run-up to this record for him.&quot;

Meanwhile, Cohen says West is having a more &quot;charmed&quot; experience,
despite his recent tantrum at the MTV Video Music Awards after going
home empty-handed.

&quot;These tantrums he goes on, these outlandish comments he makes, they
don't really hurt him,&quot; said Cohen. &quot;If anything, they've got more
people interested in what he's all about.&quot;

Still, don't finalize those retirement party plans for 50 just yet;
there are several days to go before a final tally is determined, and
he could catch up and overtake West.

&quot;It is a projection,&quot; Cohen said of the initial sales predictions. &quot;It
can very easily deviate.&quot;

And there's still the potential of a third-party candidate winning the
race: country superstar Kenny Chesney, who's &quot;Just Who I Am: Poets and
Pirates&quot; also was released on Tuesday, is so far on pace to sell
400,000 to 550,000 copies.

This shows exactly how far the tastes of music buyers have fallen. It
can't get much more pathetic than this.

Not garbage like that. Why not buy Sweet Danger by Suzy Bogguss.
Currently Number 4 on the charts. She's a women with real talent! Her
version of Chicago's &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; is superb. And another
song, &quot;You're In Heaven&quot; was written by Suzy and her husband, Doug.
It's about a couple that they knew. There's lot of talent out there -
Michael Buble, Fergie, Keely Smith, Shelby Lynne. But the only thing
record companies and video producers heap on the public these days is
one pile of crap after another!

Ferghie and Keely Smith in the same sentence? There's something not
right about that...............

Keely still shines, even today. What a voice on her (plus she put up
with Louis Prima's galavanting around for all those years).
