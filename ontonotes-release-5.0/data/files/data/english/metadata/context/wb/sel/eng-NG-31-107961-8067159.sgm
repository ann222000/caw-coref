200 People Busted For Alcohol-Related Offenses On The Little Miami River
Last Update: Jul 8, 2007 2:26 AM

Close to 200 people fall victim to a sweep on the Little Miami River. Officials
in Warren County were targeting alcohol-related offenses, from open containers
to underage drinking. The operation left many people drying out and forced to
pay a hefty fine.

Many people were feeling the heat, and not because of the temperature. The main
objective of this operation is not to ruin activities but to make sure the
Little Miami River can be a fun place for the whole family.

Out of sight and undercover, officers from several agencies were looking to put
a stop to a common problem. There's a little too much drinking on the Little
Miami River. Area residents living around the river complained of rude and
obnoxious behavior, enough that something had to be done.

The Sackriders, a local family, agree with Warren County officials who say
alcohol and the river don't mix. Most were upset to get ticketed, in over a few
hours authorities handed citations close to 200 people.

The violations ranged from underage drinking to littering and life jacket
violations. Some people on canoes got stopped more than once for the most
popular offense, having an open container. The goal of the crackdown is to make
sure the river is a friendly place for local families to make a splash. Dozens
of empty beer cans were picked up in the seven-hour sweep

Meanwhile, on the water Chris and Rebecca Sackrider will stick to drinking
water. There will be another similar sweep in the near future, but officials in
Warren County are not saying when.

Oh jiggers the cops are comin
Why can't they leave us alone
Keep paddlin while I'm dumpin
No beer in Ohio.

Gotta get done with it
Swallow the evidence down
Should have been done long ago
There's my whole six pack
Soaking into the ground
A case woulda been quite a blow

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, (etc)

Oh jiggers the cops are comin
Why can't they leave us alone
Keep paddlin while I'm dumpin
No beer in Ohio
No beer in Ohio
(how many more?)
No beer in Ohio
(will I have to pour?)
No beer in Ohio

There are some darn good reasons not to drink while boating. The
skipper really needs to blow zero. Passengers who become intoxicated
are more likely to wind up in the water and will be less able to
assist in their own or some other person's rescue. Studies have shown
that the marine environment tends to increase the effects of alcohol.

Still, that said, busting people for having an open can of beer
anywhere aboard a boat seems extreme. The news bit didn't imply that
all or even any of the boaters were legally intoxicated. A town big
enough to turn out 45 cops (to write a total of 200 beer-related
tickets) has to have a mayor, city council, etc. I guess we can all be
sure that when the politicians all gather for a party on the mayor's
yacht that there will be no open containers or consumption of alcohol
anywhere aboard.

Some boaters have and enforce a no-alcohol policy aboard their boats.
I'm not opposed to a guest having a beer or a glass of wine, within
moderation. As long as the operator waits until the boat is at its
final destination for the day before imbibing, the cops shouldn't be
busting beer. Public intoxication, lewd or rowdy behavior, public
urination, etc, deserve to be ticketed and should be.......but even if
it's borderline unwise a non-operating adult shouldn't be ticketed for
holding a can of beer on a boat.

Especially on a canoe which is in no possible way a &quot;motor vehicle&quot;.

Depends on how the local law is written of course but I'd like to see
them fight it out in court.

Subtle distinction: The government sweep didn't target drunks, the
tickets were handed out to people caught with an open bottle of beer
in a boat. If it's 100 degrees, 3-4 guys are out fishing, and somebody
other than the person operating the vessel pops open a beer that
shouldn't be considered a crime. It may be unwise, but if the boat
operator isn't drinking at the helm it's merely a questionable
practice and not a crime. IMO.

There's a difference between having a beer on a summer afternoon and
being a &quot;drunk&quot;.

I thought Carrie Nation and Temperance Unions were ancient history.
Good thing they didn't catch one of the canoeists or kayakers smokin a
doobie.....if beer warrants a ticket those uptight puritans would
probably lynch somebody found with a joint.

No wonder the entire world seems to be moving to the west coast! :-)

You can't drive a car on the highways legally with an open container of
booze. I doubt you could ride a bike doing so, either. But driving a
boat with open containers of booze visible is ok?

People (not an individual person) often get irresponsible and out of
control when alcohol is involved. I've seen it ruin many a perfectly
good, responsible and happy a festive time where many individuals are
enjoying alcohol responsibly.

People SUCK! Remember? We see many instances of this sucky behavior
all the time. Many instances involve alcohol too, unfortunately. Ruins
the good responsible time for the rest of us, yano? :-(

What the hell is a doobie? Is it one of those new designer drugs?
Does it give you the feeling that Kansas and Nebraska are closing in on the

Good to see you a little closer to the fusilage than ol' HK, at least on

&gt;&gt; You can't drive a car on the highways legally with an open container
&gt;&gt; of booze. I doubt you could ride a bike doing so, either. But driving
&gt;&gt; a boat with open containers of booze visible is ok?

&gt; I have heard you say many times, that you have had a beer on a boat on
&gt; hot summer day, and that you allow others to drink on your boat, you
&gt; just don't allow them to get drunk.  Is that ok with you?

Harry, as usual is incorrect, there are states that it is still legal to
do so

All in all, I don't allow any alcoholic beverages on my boat. Most of
my friends don't drink, and the ones that do don't give me any hassle
about my &quot;rule&quot;.

Carylyle Lake does a pretty good sweep a couple times a year too. They
don't get wild about &quot;open seal&quot; though, but when none of the boats
occupants can pass the breath blower, then things get interesting.

And it does happen.

How many of the people who responded actually read (and understood) the
article?
Apparently not many.

This is NOT about people &quot;driving&quot; a vehicle.
Canoes appear to be the boats in question
This is NOT about general boating laws.

This is a quiet, scenic, river that has a special &quot;no alcohol allowed&quot; law
in this area.
They are trying to keep this a &quot;family friendly&quot; area near a state park.
The idea is that it is much easier to enforce a blanket no alcohol policy
than to try to chase down the problem people or have probably cause to
individually check id's on people who are drinking to check their age.

I don't know the details of the river but expect that it is similar to a few
of them around here where people go to kick back while canoeing or tubing.
They are slow, shallow, wide enough to not be difficult but narrow enough to
easily wade across.

You would need to be really wasted (like not be able to stand up) to be in
significant danger on them.

The Cannon (near Cannon Falls, MN) is longer, the primary activity is using
a canoe barely faster than drifting, and the activities are very quiet.

The Apple (near Somerset, WI) has a very different reputation.  The water
has a small &quot;rapids&quot; at the end of the commonly used zone.

Googling for &quot;apple river&quot; wisconsin alcohol family, brought this up as the
2nd result.

WARNIING: NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY

The primary activity is tubing.  You park your butt in an inner tube and
drift along the river.
There are campgrounds along the river that have tube rental and some people
go there to party with their underage friends and/or get REALLY drunk and
obnoxious.

From what I have heard, it used to be a lot worse than it is now.  The local
people decided that things were getting out of hand and convinced the county
sheriff's department to spend some time cracking down on: underage drinking,
public drunkenness, public sex acts, and littering.  There are warnings
about this and you are supposed to pay a deposit on every container you
leave with.

I have been down it several times in the last 15 years and never saw
significant nudity but saw a number of obnoxious drunks.  We generally have
a cooler in it's own tube and have a 2-4 beers in the few hours it takes to
drift through the trees.  More fun that soaking in a hot tub.
Usually the tubes are tied together into a raft and whomever is towards the
front gives a quick (and sometimes surprised) call of &quot;butts up&quot; to warn
people about a rock near the surface.

By this statement, I should be able, as a passenger in a car, to hoist
my open can of brew in a salute to the Fuzz in the next lane. Care to
estimate how long it would take for him to hit the skids, and swoop in
on the 6 O'clock for the kill? I'm not sure you know it, but there IS an
open container law here in Washington. Please explain the legal
difference between a boat and a car in this scenario.

It wouldn't be a lifeguard arresting you.  If they are like Minnesota, the
state parks and larger park systems have their own police officers and the
others can bring in the local authorities quickly.

However, they have better things to do than bust people for alcohol unless
they are causing a problem.

While on a camping trip at a state park, we had a group site (secluded, away
from the main sites).  We went for a late night hike and talked with a state
park ranger along the way.  He casually asked if we had any alcohol, then
said that if we did, we shouldn't carry it around (we wouldn't anyway) or be
overly loud.

I volunteer with a local (Three Rivers Park District) park district.  The
&quot;park patrol&quot; is around for information and first aid.  After appropriate
training, we use the trails (skate, bike, hike, ski) and watch for people
who need assistance.  Usually it is just to help people figure out where
they are or where something is.
However, if we see a problem, we will call the dispatcher for the park
police.

There are some important differences between cars and boats.
In most states it's also illegal to operate your car unless everybody
is in a seat belt and normally a shoulder harness. Would you propose a
similar restriction for boats?

A car is nothing more than vehicle of conveyance, while a boat can be
simultaneously a conveyance and a means of accommodation.

I don't suggest the skipper should be drinking underway, but busting
the skipper seated up on the flybridge because a guest down in the
salon is having a cold beer or a glass of Merlot on a summer afternoon
is way over the top.

Good thing there's no actual crime in Ohio, thereby freeing 45 of the
local cops to spend an afternoon preventing the consumption of beer on
the Little Miami river.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; River. Officials
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Warren County were targeting alcohol-related offenses, from open
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; containers
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to underage drinking. The operation left many people drying out and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forced to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pay a hefty fine.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many people were feeling the heat, and not because of the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; temperature. The main
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; objective of this operation is not to ruin activities but to make
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little Miami River can be a fun place for the whole family.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Out of sight and undercover, officers from several agencies were
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looking to put
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a stop to a common problem. There's a little too much drinking on
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Little
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Miami River. Area residents living around the river complained of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rude and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obnoxious behavior, enough that something had to be done.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Sackriders, a local family, agree with Warren County officials
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who say
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alcohol and the river don't mix. Most were upset to get ticketed, in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over a few
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hours authorities handed citations close to 200 people.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The violations ranged from underage drinking to littering and life
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jacket
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violations. Some people on canoes got stopped more than once for the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; popular offense, having an open container. The goal of the crackdown
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is to make
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure the river is a friendly place for local families to make a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; splash. Dozens
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of empty beer cans were picked up in the seven-hour sweep

&gt; &gt; &gt; boat with open containers of booze visible is ok?

&gt; &gt; I have heard you say many times, that you have had a beer on a boat on
&gt; &gt; hot summer day, and that you allow others to drink on your boat, you
&gt; &gt; just don't allow them to get drunk.  Is that ok with you?

&gt; People (not an individual person) often get irresponsible and out of
&gt; control when alcohol is involved. I've seen it ruin many a perfectly
&gt; good, responsible and happy a festive time where many individuals are
&gt; enjoying alcohol responsibly.

&gt; People SUCK! Remember? We see many instances of this sucky behavior
&gt; all the time. Many instances involve alcohol too, unfortunately. Ruins
&gt; the good responsible time for the rest of us, yano? :-(

So in my opinion we should target the problem people, not a common
behavior in which (as you note) many will participate with voluntary
and responsible restraint.

I don't spend a lot of time thinking about booze and boats, Chuck. So
far this year, I've had two beers, and both were consumed in my den
after spending four hours mowing my lawn and field. I have one friend
who is an alcoholic. When he comes aboard, I restrict his cooler to two
beers. Maybe once or twice a year, I have a beer on board, but only
while anchored or in a slip.

I don't believe the case you cited involved drinking a glass of wine in
the salon.

&gt; All in all, I don't allow any alcoholic beverages on my boat. Most of

And it should indeed be the skipper's privilege to formulate an
alcohol policy for his or her boat. And it would be for the best if
more boaters had a policy similar to yours......but should it be a
*crime* to allow a guest to enjoy a beer while underway? I think not.

&gt; I lived on Sanibel for almost a year (1983)  but winter made me run to
&gt; the peaceful town of Estero. Now I am buried again.
&gt; Sanibel is a strange place. They like to pretend they are a lightly
&gt; developed island but the population density is one of the higest in
&gt; the county. The bushes hide it but the houses are on tiny lots. In my
&gt; (rental) house there on East Gulf we felt like we had to pull our feet
&gt; up in bed when a car went past because we were so close to the road.
&gt; (grey piling house at Shell Basket and Gulf). It was tolerable in the
&gt; summer but in winter cars went by all night long. This is in the zig
&gt; zags between the causeway road (old Hilton) and Donax. I lost a
&gt; mailbox and a pygmy date palm to cars that missed the turn. Another
&gt; one smacked that big queen palm in the yard and lost the battle.

Pine Island is *very* different from Sanibel, still a lot of open

Pine Island is surrounded by Pine Island Sound on two sides, Port
Charlotte Harbor to the north, and Matlacha Pass to the east.  The

Police Crack Down On Brews, Canoes

POSTED: 12:11 pm EDT July 10, 2007
UPDATED: 1:50 pm EDT July 10, 2007

LEBANON, Ohio -- Officials in southwest Ohio are cracking down on
drinking and rowdy behavior by boaters on the Little Miami River.

The Warren County prosecutor's office and officers from several
agencies combined to issue 189 citations last weekend near Caesar
Creek, about 30 miles south of Dayton.

&quot;It ought to be a nice, family sporting event,&quot; said Prosecutor Rachel
Hutzel. &quot;It's turned into a drunken party.&quot;

Hutzel said the sweep, which involved more than 40 police officers
manning six checkpoints on the river, was the result of numerous
complaints.

The majority of citations -- 147 of them - rapped boaters for having
open containers of alcohol, and 22 were for underage consumption or
possession, she said.

A few citations were written for littering or trespassing, and three
people were found to have outstanding warrants for their arrest,
Hutzel said.

The Ohio Department of Natural Resources and nine other agencies
joined in the weekend program.

At Morgan's Canoe Livery, signs are posted warning that alcoholic
drinks are illegal.

Large groups are required to sign waivers agreeing to warn members of
their party against drinking on the river, and some carry-on
containers are inspected.

&quot;Some people are bound and determined to drink. (and) it's kind of
hard to stop them,&quot; said employee Mary Ash. &quot;They sneak it in their
coolers.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 200 People Busted For Alcohol-Related Offenses On The Little Miami
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; River
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Last Update: Jul 8, 2007 2:26 AM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Close to 200 people fall victim to a sweep on the Little Miami River.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Officials
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Warren County were targeting alcohol-related offenses, from open
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; containers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to underage drinking. The operation left many people drying out and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; forced to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pay a hefty fine.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many people were feeling the heat, and not because of the temperature.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The main
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; objective of this operation is not to ruin activities but to make sure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little Miami River can be a fun place for the whole family.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Out of sight and undercover, officers from several agencies were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looking to put
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a stop to a common problem. There's a little too much drinking on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Miami River. Area residents living around the river complained of rude
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obnoxious behavior, enough that something had to be done.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Sackriders, a local family, agree with Warren County officials who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alcohol and the river don't mix. Most were upset to get ticketed, in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hours authorities handed citations close to 200 people.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The violations ranged from underage drinking to littering and life
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jacket
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violations. Some people on canoes got stopped more than once for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; popular offense, having an open container. The goal of the crackdown is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure the river is a friendly place for local families to make a splash.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dozens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of empty beer cans were picked up in the seven-hour sweep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, on the water Chris and Rebecca Sackrider will stick to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; drinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; water. There will be another similar sweep in the near future, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; officials in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Warren County are not saying when.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.local12.com/mostpopular/story.aspx?content_id=2ccdfc37-1f6 ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; Works for me. Drunks on the water are damned dangerous.- Hide quoted
&gt;&gt;&gt; text -

&gt;&gt;&gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt;&gt; Subtle distinction: The government sweep didn't target drunks, the
&gt;&gt; tickets were handed out to people caught with an open bottle of beer
&gt;&gt; in a boat. If it's 100 degrees, 3-4 guys are out fishing, and somebody
&gt;&gt; other than the person operating the vessel pops open a beer that
&gt;&gt; shouldn't be considered a crime. It may be unwise, but if the boat
&gt;&gt; operator isn't drinking at the helm it's merely a questionable
&gt;&gt; practice and not a crime. IMO.

&gt;&gt; There's a difference between having a beer on a summer afternoon and
&gt;&gt; being a &quot;drunk&quot;.

&gt;&gt; I thought Carrie Nation and Temperance Unions were ancient history.
&gt;&gt; Good thing they didn't catch one of the canoeists or kayakers smokin a
&gt;&gt; doobie.....if beer warrants a ticket those uptight puritans would
&gt;&gt; probably lynch somebody found with a joint.

&gt;&gt; No wonder the entire world seems to be moving to the west coast! :-)

&gt; You can't drive a car on the highways legally with an open container of
&gt; booze. I doubt you could ride a bike doing so, either. But driving a boat
&gt; with open containers of booze visible is ok?
">

It is here in Michigan.  You can't be under the influence and operate a
boat, but there are no laws against having open containers.

When on a river in public it's correlated with being stinking drunk and

I've got nothing against nudity except that I have found a strong
correlation between those who want to be nude in public and those I never
want to see nude.  Most people over the age of 25 (myself included) should
