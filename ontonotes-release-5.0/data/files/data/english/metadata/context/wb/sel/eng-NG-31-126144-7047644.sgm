An Endless Wire to the Who
By Michael Senft - THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC

With a resume that includes such classic rock albums as Tommy and
Quadrophenia, the Who doesn't need an excuse to tour.

But after 25 years of on-again, off-again reunions and the 2002 death of
bassist John Entwistle, a new Who concert is greeted with some skepticism.

Until you give the band's new CD a spin, that is.

Endless Wire, the band's first disc since 1982's It's Hard, is a strong
reaffirmation of the group's legacy, filled with thunderous vocals from
Roger Daltrey and some of guitarist Pete Townshend's sharpest songwriting in
30 years.

We recently conducted an e-mail conversation with Townshend about Endless
Wire and the band's new tour, which visits US Airways Center on Wednesday.

QUESTION: With all the numerous reunions since the '82 Farewell tour, many
people had written off the Who as a creative unit. Was there a sense of
trying to prove the naysayers wrong with Endless Wire?

Answer: Nay. There is no question in my mind that I left the Who in 1982,
and as far as I was concerned, that was that. I was in an absolute creative
dilemma with the band and the brand. Roger never let up, as he says
himself - he nagged constantly and to some extent so did fans. So reunion
events were really just that, chances to get together and attempt to show
the willingness to do the holiday-season thing. For me creatively, the Who
were always a possibility, but one that became more and more remote as time
passed.

What happened to produce the songs for Endless Wire was sudden, unexpected
and quite strange. I had played Roger a few new songs here and there, in
response to his constant, self-confessed bugging that we should try to make
one more great record (and, of course, it's good to be wanted!). But his
reaction had been cool. When John died, and my only client was Roger, I was
able to focus more tightly. I decided to stop flying songs past Roger (in a
kind of audition process) and just start making a record that he could react
to, almost like an editor who performs. That worked, and thus the use of the
Who brand itself became the subject of some scrutiny. The two of us decided
that we had to accept who we were, but also who we had been, and what
happens whenever we stand together. The Who, in stripped-down form, was
reborn.

Q: Listening to Endless Wire, my first thought was how much it felt like the
Who's early '70's output - Who's Next to Who Are You. But then I noticed how
much I missed the bottom end on the album. What was it like recording
without John Entwistle?

A: Remember, too, that we live in CD land now - little, tinny CDs. It was
hard getting John's sound onto a CD. He had such a massive sound, it's hard
to replicate, and it could be wrong to try. John would have listened to my
demo bass lines (as he always did) and played his own amazing versions of
them, with flourishes, additional depth and harmonics and a huge, fat sound.

Q: Much of your work, especially on Endless Wire, seems very personal. How
does it feel to have those lyrics sung by someone else?

A: I'm glad it feels personal, but it is not as rooted in me personally as
it seems. A lot of my most reflective songs were actually about the band,
each of us, and what we were going through. Because I was the songwriter, I
got the credit or the blame. As for who sings what, I want Roger to sing it
all. What he is uncomfortable with I happily sing.

Q: Many older bands put out a new album, then barely give it credence live.
But you guys are tackling the bulk of Endless Wire. How are the audiences
reacting to the new material?

A: The audiences are being gracious. Radio is being pretty good, too, but
everything has changed since our last album as the Who. We are playing what
we feel is a reasonable balance and getting a good reaction.

Q: You seem to teeter between writing epic suites and stand-alone songs.
Endless Wire has both - shorter songs like Black Widow's Eyes, and the "Wire
& Glass" mini-opera. Is it easier to write a stand-alone song or one that
fits into a larger narrative?

A: Having a story helps me a lot, I write much more from the hip when I have
a theme underpinning my songwriting. On the other hand, sometimes songs just
land from nowhere, and it is only later that I realize they, too, come from
some thesis I've been dragging around. I don't have a lot of new ideas. My
old ideas were so extraordinary for the young man I was, my teachers so
smart, that I feel I should simply continue to honor the job.

Q: Do you plan on doing more recording as the Who?

A: No plan as of today, but if I write some songs, I will record them and
see what happens.

Q: What was your reaction to Won't Get Fooled Again becoming a 9/11 anthem?

A: It was appropriate. The song is about a refusal to be bullied into what
to vote, what to think and what to do if attacked. It is not so much a
conservative song as one that is against bullying and self-righteousness.
After 9/11, what was needed was not vengeance but a message that we would
not stand for suicide terrorism. We might not be able to prevent it, but we
would never be fooled into thinking that, because our system is not perfect,
we are in some way evil. I have never felt Islamic bombers were evil, just
wrong. If someone call me Satan, they are (expletive0 nuts, because,
actually, I'm a man from West London.

Q: About 15 years ago, you were having trouble with tinnitus and there was
talk of you not being able to play electric guitar live anymore. What are
you doing to protect your hearing now?

A: I'm probably not doing the best thing - which is not to play music at
all. I tried that. In fact, I reduced the Who's stage volume from 198
onwards. I've always had an acoustic flair. ... Behind Blue Eyes, Won't Get
Fooled Again and Pinball Wizard - if I play those songs on acoustic, they
sound pretty strong. I play electric guitar very differently today. I take
care not to deafen myself or anyone else.

Q: As someone who has had a strong Internet presence for years, how do you
see the Internet driving the music industry in the coming years?

A: Driving it? Exploiting it. At least MySpace and YouTube fall into that
category. Even iTunes is not entirely fair; Apple set their own price
structure that bears no reflection whatsoever on the cost of making music.
Musicians and music are regarded as worthless these days. Their work can be
picked up free and shared. They are less valued than bottled water ...

A performance of mine on YouTube might attract a hundred thousand hits and I
wouldn't get a cent. It's a form of theft. The people who run YouTube will
be multibillionaires. They are all copyright thieves equal to the Chinese in
their flagrant disregard of creative talent and its value.

Even so, I love YouTube. In a way, it is first and foremost
enthusiast-driven promotion. The problem is that it is OK for the Who - we
can sell out a big hall and pay the rent and the mortgage. We can stand some
theft. New musicians are really struggling.

Artists really are prostitutes now. But I always said they were. People
looked at me as though I were mad. We stand naked. We want approval. We want
recognition. Sadly, this desire makes us vulnerable. Rock and roll (read all
pop music) is a huge bonfire onto which young people queue up to throw
themselves. Line after line of them. It has always been that way. We are
shameless. We will do anything to see you smile. Anything for a halfway good
review.

The Internet has simply revealed what I have always known about myself. If
no one is willing to pay for what I create, I would rather give it away free
than keep it hidden.
