I played in a sectional this weekend with a quasi-expert partner.  He
has over 5000 mps, has played for 40 years or so, has written a local
bridge magazine for many years, etc.  He also is a master
&quot;resulter&quot;.
He:  AJT843  A6  AK  Q42
Me:  K6  QJ  87632  AK87
MPs all white, opponents passing throughout:
1S  -  3NT (showing 13-15, usually exactly 2 spades, I guess could be
3 spades)
4NT - all pass
Heart lead, ducked to the King on my right, heart return.  I played
rho for Qxx of spades, and made 6. ( I played the Js quickly at trick
3 and watched my rho for &quot;tells&quot;, if RHO had played smoothly and
seemingly without problems, I was gonna rise with the king and play
LHO for the queen.) 10 out of 12 matchpoints.  He went on and on about
how I should have bid 2C or 2D, and how we should have found 6S.  He
said I shouldn't distort my hand, and I should have every other suit
stopped to bid 3NT.  I think with his hand I would bid 6S over 3NT. I
think that considering my awful diamond suit, treating my hand as a
balanced 13-15 is right.

Your 3NT call would not have been my choice.  Too many negatives: not a
legitmate heart stopper or decent diamond holding.  I wouldn't have bid 2D
or 2C either as both these bids send the wrong message.  Assuming you were
playing 2/1 gf (you didn't say), my call would have been a forcing 1NT and
take it from there.

But your having bid 3NT, I believe your partner's 4NT can only be described
as pusillanamous.  I would have called 6S or 6NT.  He has 18 hcp with a good
6 card suit.  He has 3 aces, which beckons a suit contract, and makes it
highly unlikely that the opponents can cash two quick tricks.  I'd just call
6S after your 3NT.

a) That 3NT bid is horrid.  The 3NT reply to 1-of-a-suit has been
called, with good reason, the most stultifying call in bridge.  It is
for that reason that 3NT, whether natural or conventional, should
conform to very rigid requirements.  It is not a bid to be sought after
just because you are a hand hog.

b) And partner was stultified.  With 18 HCP, a 6-card suit (that has
been &quot;supported&quot; by 3NT), and massive controls.  The only concern about
bidding 6S directly over 3NT is the spade quality.  Surely you and your
5K MP partner have a way to check that.

He is absolutely right about how horrid your 3NT bid was.  He was
absolutely wrong to assign his fault for missing the slam to your horrid
call.  He should be happy you bid so badly; it gives him somewhere to
misdirect attention from his beginner's putzer blunder in bidding 4NT.

&quot;Well, that's fortunate hand partner.  I might have bid 6 Spades over it
or even 4NT, invitational.   I think a call of 2D or even 2C might have
been wiser, given the lack of solidity of your heart stop, but it all
worked out well, didn't it?  Spades splitting Qxx in the slot is less
than 20%, although a few squeezes might bring it up to as much as 30%...
assuming you can guess which one to take.  Funny game.&quot;

Good candidate for a big club system, these are good hands to have,
but hard ones to bid in 2/1 style..

I admire the practicality of the 3NT bid, but it wastes a ton of
space.
I'd go with 2C, especially if playing 2/1.  Look at the space now, in
fact this gives partner a chance to rebid 2D with the correct holding
allowing the uncovering of a minor suit slam if it were there.

Anyway over 2C, he could trot out 3S.  And then 4S by you.
RKC seems safe with a fit and there you go.

You bashed and caught partner with a biggie.
He tried to shave it thin rather then just bashing back.  Better luck
next time, but 10 out of 12 ain't bad.

Maybe we'll see the hand in his magazine as well!

I would give you 50% of the blame for not getting to 6S.
Your 3NT bid is out of line.
Why do you make these bids?
You have no heart stopper.
You really don't want to play 3NT without exploring other contracts.
I would bid 2C where 7/13 of my hcp. But even after a 2D response your
side would probably get 6S with little effort.

As for you partner, I would find his 4NT bid on the conservative side.
He would have made the same bid with one less spade and one more
heart. Also, he doesn't need for you to have a maximum to make 6S. For
example,
S Qx   H Kxxx   D xxx   D AKxx. Since his spade intermediates are so
good and he has six of them, I would at least bid 5S as an
invitational bid but I would probably just say to hell with it and bid
6S.

In short,  your partner should probably bid more than 4NT. But if he
were playing with one of his peers who would normally not bid 3NT they
would get to 6S easily. Your 3NT bid created unnecessary conditions
for partner to make a mistake and he did. But you share the blame for
bidding 3NT.

You may not like 3NT, which is at least in part a matter of
philosophy.
Of course jumping to 3NT is not scientific. It can loose in various
ways (partner is short in diamonds with clubs his second suit for
example), but it can also win, giving opponents little in return. 3NT
often makes on the wrong opening lead.
What I do not stomach is that the 3NT bid has anything to do with the
final contract.
I can not imagine a better assistance for bidding the spade slam from
the correct side than
3NT. It is blatantly obvious. After 3NT, 4NT is clearly wrong and 5S
an underbid, though better than 4NT.
Starting with 2C may cause opener to worry later about a singleton
spade opposite. Standard methods are not always good in distinguishing
between singleton and a doubleton support, which is crucial
here.

Why is he concerned about bidding to a Great 6S when his bid should
have been 5S over 3NT?  He needs a high spade from you for slam, so
find out about it.

&gt; I can not imagine a better assistance for bidding the spade slam from

In Standard American 2/1 you don't have to jump around in the auction
like a bunny rabbit that you would have to do in say Acol or other
natural weaker opening systems..

The 2/1 auction would start:
.
1S          2C
2S(1)      2NT(2)
3C(3)      3S(4)

(1) Forcing to game - unlimited
(2) Forcing to game - 12-14  or 18+
(3) Club support
(4) Doubleton spade honor.

Now opener will sniff around for a grand but settle for 6S.

&gt; Why is he concerned about bidding to a Great 6S when his bid should
&gt; have been 5S over 3NT?  He needs a high spade from you for slam, so
&gt; find out about it.

&gt; Sandy Barnes

Since XX yields a 50% play for 5 spade tricks, asking for spade
support is superfluous. Since you have 7 control (2-1) points, I
believe you don't need to worry about controls, partner should have 3
or 4.  I think 6NT is right at matchpoints. it is purely a matter of
luck whether 6S or 6NT will be right sided.  And I guess the extra 10
points is worth more than the expectation of added chances in spades
to make the contract or develop an overtrick. Yes, I see that 6S is
much better this time, but I seriously dislike 3NT with as many flaws
as this.

A little bidding judgement is called for.
I bid 2C instead of 2D because if partner has four diamonds he will
bid 2D over 2C.
Further, I don't want partner to evaluate  Qx or Qxx in diamonds
opposite my five feeble diamonds as an asset. But I do want partner to
evaluate Qx or Qxx in clubs as a big asset. Please note that in my
bidding sequence I communicated where 10/13 of my hcp are. In your
bidding 3NT you communicated 0/13 = 0 where your hcp were located.

A old grand master bridge player in the ACBL Bridge Hall of Fame once
advised me &quot;Don't make bids unless your hand is perfect for it.&quot; When
your standards are sloppy like your 3NT bid you can cause your partner
to make a mistake.

Eric Leong

PS: If you must know, I generally play 3NT as a balanced four card
raise as per Kaplan.
I prefer 2NT as natural and forcing.
With more practiced partnerships, I like playing two-tiered
splinters. So 3NT would
show a better splinter then a direct splinter.

For the life of me I don't understand how you can diagnose 6S will be
right sided instead of 6NT on the bidding.  I imagine that usually
there won't be much positional advantage, and if there is, it will be
about equal between 6S and 6NT.  Although 6S rates to make more often
than 6NT (and 7S more often than 7NT), I don't estimate the extra
chances you can expect in 6S are enough to offset the extra 10 points
at matchpoints.  It is at IMPs where I expect 6S to be truly superior.

Regardless, I am solidly with Eric in my disdain for a 3NT response on
a balanced 13 or so, even more so when flawed.  Probably because I
still prefer to use 2NT for that hand type [but not this flawed] and
something less valuable for raises.  It gives the defense no added
information when partner is balanced, and gives your side an immense
advantage when he is not.

I don't care for this treatment. 3NT is too space consuming and will
often leave opener guessing whether to try play 3NT or 4M or 5m. For
example, had partner held: AQJxx, x, AKxx, xxx he would pass 3NT for a
disastrous result. We could blame that on your offbeat 3NT call but
that is not the root of the problem. Even if you had held a more
normal 3NT bid, opener would have to guess whether you held a half,
single or a double heart stopper opposite his stiff. On a bad day you
would have Kx, Qxx, QJxx, AQxx.

It is better to use 2NT to show a balanced 13-15. When opener has some
shape, he has room to explore for the best game contract below 3NT. It
is also better for slam auctions. Of course this means you can't use
Jacoby, but 1S-P-3C and 1H-P-2S can be used to show the Jacoby hand.

He may not have stated his case well, but he has a point that your
auction was misleading. He was expecting your hand to have values in
every suit. Had he held:  AQxxx, AKx, x, QJxx, he would not picture
the perfect fit.

Although on the actual hand the fault was his, I agree that 3NT was
not a good rebid. Avoid space-consuming calls when multiple strains
are in the picture.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your thoughts ... ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rich Regan

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would give you 50% of the blame for not getting to 6S.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your 3NT bid is out of line.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you make these bids?
&gt; &gt; &gt; You have no heart stopper.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You really don't want to play 3NT without exploring other contracts.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would bid 2C where 7/13 of my hcp. But even after a 2D response your
&gt; &gt; &gt; side would probably get 6S with little effort.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As for you partner, I would find his 4NT bid on the conservative side.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He would have made the same bid with one less spade and one more
&gt; &gt; &gt; heart. Also, he doesn't need for you to have a maximum to make 6S. For
&gt; &gt; &gt; example,
&gt; &gt; &gt; S Qx   H Kxxx   D xxx   D AKxx. Since his spade intermediates are so
&gt; &gt; &gt; good and he has six of them, I would at least bid 5S as an
&gt; &gt; &gt; invitational bid but I would probably just say to hell with it and bid
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6S.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In short,  your partner should probably bid more than 4NT. But if he
&gt; &gt; &gt; were playing with one of his peers who would normally not bid 3NT they
&gt; &gt; &gt; would get to 6S easily. Your 3NT bid created unnecessary conditions
&gt; &gt; &gt; for partner to make a mistake and he did. But you share the blame for
&gt; &gt; &gt; bidding 3NT.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Eric Leong

&gt; &gt; You may not like 3NT, which is at least in part a matter of
&gt; &gt; philosophy.
&gt; &gt; Of course jumping to 3NT is not scientific. It can loose in various
&gt; &gt; ways (partner is short in diamonds with clubs his second suit for
&gt; &gt; example), but it can also win, giving opponents little in return. 3NT
&gt; &gt; often makes on the wrong opening lead.
&gt; &gt; What I do not stomach is that the 3NT bid has anything to do with the
&gt; &gt; final contract.
&gt; &gt; I can not imagine a better assistance for bidding the spade slam from
&gt; &gt; the correct side than
&gt; &gt; 3NT. It is blatantly obvious. After 3NT, 4NT is clearly wrong and 5S
&gt; &gt; an underbid, though better than 4NT.
&gt; &gt; Starting with 2C may cause opener to worry later about a singleton
&gt; &gt; spade opposite. Standard methods are not always good in distinguishing
&gt; &gt; between singleton and a doubleton support, which is crucial
&gt; &gt; here.

&gt; &gt; Rainer Herrmann

&gt; For the life of me I don't understand how you can diagnose 6S will be
&gt; right sided instead of 6NT on the bidding.  I imagine that usually
&gt; there won't be much positional advantage, and if there is, it will be
&gt; about equal between 6S and 6NT.  Although 6S rates to make more often
&gt; than 6NT (and 7S more often than 7NT), I don't estimate the extra
&gt; chances you can expect in 6S are enough to offset the extra 10 points
&gt; at matchpoints.  It is at IMPs where I expect 6S to be truly superior.

&gt; Regardless, I am solidly with Eric in my disdain for a 3NT response on
&gt; a balanced 13 or so, even more so when flawed.  Probably because I
&gt; still prefer to use 2NT for that hand type [but not this flawed] and
&gt; something less valuable for raises.  It gives the defense no added
&gt; information when partner is balanced, and gives your side an immense
&gt; advantage when he is not.

&gt; == Bill Shutts
">

I admit that 6S is played from the right side maybe accidental and I
would not argue much against 6NT at pairs, though my preference with
the control rich opening hand is for a suit slam, not least because
chances for an overtrick might be better there.
The real point however was about reaching or missing slam, not about
the difference between 6NT and 6S. Since even making 12 tricks in 4NT
was good enough for a near top argues for the safest slam, which from
opener's perspective looks to me is 6S.

I think 2N=11-12 is virtually unplayable; I hate this particular
sequence as invitational.

I play 2N=12-14 (usually 4-3-3-3 non-prime, but some flex) or 18-19
(always 4-3-3-3) and 3N=15-17 (always 4-3-3-3 non-prime.) This seems
to work pretty well.

Over 1M, I play 2N as 12-14 or 18-19 and 3N as a balanced forcing
raise (14+-17). I've never missed Jacoby 2N.

Yes I do and for the same reason. When opener has something like: xxx,
x, AKx, AJTxxx, it is much better to have an auction like:
1C-2NT-3C... where you have a good chance to get to the right game
than guess after 1C-3NT.

Playing 2NT as forcing allows you to bid 2NT with either 13-15 or
18-19 and 3NT with exactly 16-17. This is a much better structure than
standard for describing balanced hands as responder.

Handling 11-12 Balanced
*  When the opening bid is 1C, you lose virtually nothing by playing
2NT as forcing, since you can temporize with 1D or, if you hold 4+
clubs, bid 2C inverted when holding 11-12 balanced.

*  When the opening bid is 1D, it is awkward to handle 11-12 balanced.
With 12 I stretch and bid 2NT with a bad 11 I bid a heavy 1NT. Bidding
only 1NT sounds scary, but in practice it works out. Partner only
passes 1NT with a balanced 12-14. With 12-13 he was passing my
invitational 2NT anyway so I am better off in 1NT. With 14 I may have
miss a marginal game, but very rarely a cold one. Fortunately, 11-12
with no four-card major and all three side suits stopped does not come
up often. You can also preemptively avoid this auction by opening 1C
more often. For example, with 4-4 in the minors.

Yes I do because all the same considerations apply. And there are
extra ways to win.

*  13-15 balanced = 2NT
16-17 balanced = 3NT
18-19 balanced = 2NT and later bid again

This is a much more accurate responding structure for balanced hands.

*  Suppose as responder you hold: KQx, QTxx, Qxx, KJx. If opener has a
balanced 12-14, 3NT is probably better than 4H even if you have a 4-4
fit. However if partner is unbalanced, 4H is probably better. If you
can bid a forcing 2NT, partner can raise to 3NT if balanced and rebid
3M if unbalanced with a 4-card major.

*  Suppose you hold: KQx, JTx, AJT, QTxx. It is much safer to respond
2NT than 3NT to show 13-15 because you have room to diagnose shortness
opposite your JTx.

Handling 11-12 balanced
*  After 1C opening.
Responder can temporize with 1D or raise to 2C, inverted if holding 4-
clubs.

*  After 1D opening.
Responder bids 2NT (forcing) with 12 and bids a heavy 1NT with a poor
11. This method is not as bad as it sounds. When opener is unbalanced
he will bid again. When opener has a balanced 12-14, you will be fine
when he holds 12-13. So the losing case is when opener has exactly 14
balanced and responder has exactly 11. Even in this losing case, you
will likely miss only a marginal not a cold game.

Play inverted, or play something like &quot;1C - 2D shows a strong C raise&quot;.

A natural 3NT response has a little bit more merit over
a 1m opener compared to a 1M opener
- Over 1m, 3NT is likely to be your final contract anyways,
especially at pairs, or when playing  limited openings
- Over a 1m first seat opener, when responder does
not have a four card major,
3NT has significant preemptive value.

Even when the 3NT response shows a hand
where 3NT is likely to be the best contract, such
as &quot;4333 13-15&quot;, that information will assist
the defense.

The natural 11-12 2NT response is no man's land as well,
regardless of whether 1m or 1M was opened.

Fred Gitelman in his series on &quot;Improving 2/1&quot; has a structure
where you give up the cheapest jump shift for your forcing raise.
&lt; http://www.imp-bridge.nl/articles/2over1c.htm &gt;
DonV and I had some nice auctions using these methods.

(We also used the next jump shift as a mixed raise, and the jump
shift just below the original major as a limit raise, so that
1M-3M was preemptive.  No strong jump shift, and not much in the
way of game try over the Bergen raises, but we really didn't miss
either much.)
