The Long Road To Justice
"There are some cases, factually, that call out for the death penalty," prosecutor Peter Margino told the jury in his closing argument in the John Evander Couey case. The kidnapping, rape and murder of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford was a cold, calculated and premeditated murder."

At the death-penalty phase, another prosecutor, Ric Ridgway, told jurors that the crime was "evil," and went on to describe Jessica's death by suffocation in two plastic bags, buried in a shallow grave.

"She was in pain," said Ridgway. "In the dark. She was certainly terrified. If this is not the person who deserves the death penalty, who does?"

By a 10-2 vote, jurors voted to give Couey the death sentence last week. Circuit Judge Ric Howard has the final say, and said he will issue his ruling in the next several weeks.

Judges give the recommendation great weight. If he agrees, it's difficult to say when an execution will take place. But defense attorney Alan Fanter, while arguing for a life sentence ("Justice is not vengeance," he said) spoke one telling truth: "No matter what you do, John Couey is going to die in prison."

It may be through execution. But the St. Petersburg Times recently noted that death-row inmates are almost equally likely to die of old age. The state averages two executions a year. With 374 men on death row, emptying it would take until 2194 to execute them all if executions were to resume tomorrow.

The Times' research found that, since 1993, 29 death-row inmates have died while awaiting execution. Most were from natural causes, although a few were from suicide or homicide.

In that same period, there were 35 executions. There probably would have been fewer had not nine inmates dropped their appeals.

Why are there so many on death row? Of the 38 states with death penalties, Florida is the only one that doesn't require juries to reach a unanimous decision on at least a portion of the death-sentence recommendation. The federal government also requires it.

"If I were pro-death penalty in Florida, the best way to have more executions is to have fewer people sentenced to death," Michael Radelet, a University of Colorado professor and a leading expert on Florida's death penalty, told the Times.

The Florida Supreme Court, in an October 2005 decision, suggested that the Florida Legislature make the death penalty a unanimous jury verdict. A bill filed in the 2006 session to do that didn't get very far. For a politician to suggest such a thing may bring accusations of being soft on crime.

That could be countered with a conservative response: It is fiscally prudent to sentence fewer people to death. Keeping an inmate for life in prison, even for as long as 40 years, costs but a fraction of the millions of dollars the state spends on legal appeals leading up to an execution.

But that debate has apparently ended before it begins. Gov. Charlie Crist was the attorney general in 2005 when the Florida Supreme Court suggested a revision in the death-sentencing jury vote. In a letter to legislative leaders, Crist wrote: "I am opposed to weakening Florida's death penalty for a number of reasons."

He noted the jury's majority vote for death "is a recommendation and not a verdict." The judge makes the ultimate decision. He went on to say the death-penalty phase is not reached without a unanimous verdict of guilty.

And then he went on to list some people who had been executed with less than a unanimous vote from the jury:

"Theodore Bundy, who killed a Lake City girl and two Florida State University co-eds in 1978. The jury recommended the death sentence by a 10-2 vote.

"Joe Nixon, who kidnaped and burned alive Jeanne Bickner near Tallahassee in 1984. The jury recommended the death sentence by a 10-2 vote.

"George Trepal [of Alturas], who killed Peggy Carr and attempted to kill six other members of her household. He stated that it was a 'personal vendetta.' The jury recommended death by a 9-3 vote. [Trepal was convicted in 1991.]

"Aileen Wuornos, a highway hitchhiker and serial killer who murdered six men between 1989 and 1990. The jury recommended death by a 10-2 vote.

"William Cruse, who went on a shooting spree in Palm Bay in 1987. Cruse was convicted of killing five people that day. The jury voted to recommend death by votes of 11-1, 11-1, 10-2, 12-0 and 11-1."

It's a compelling compendium, and perhaps the debate about the unanimous verdict for the death penalty is best concluded by rephrasing the question asked by prosecutor Ridgway: "If John Evander Couey's name doesn't deserve to be added to that list, whose does?"
