At $3 a gallon, perhaps scooter commuting is the way to go -- and they're fun!

If you need a sound argument to justify getting a scooter to your
parents, or your spouse (or even, for some of us, to our children),
this page
has the arguments all laid out and ready to send:

The return on investment for an inexpensive scooter is superb with gas
costing over $3 a gallon.  My scooter paid for itself in well less
than a year.   Here's a simple breakdown:

The scooter is free!

-- Well, not really, but in practical terms, with the payback point
being what it is, a scooter is one of the most justifiable investments
any driver with significant local traveling to do can possibly make.
(besides being a gas saver, it's also stylish) Here's how to explain
it
to your parent or spouse:

Each mile in an SUV costs in gas PPG/MPG where PPG is the price per
gallon and MPG is the mileage of your vehicle. If the price per gallon
is $3.00 and your vehicle gets 12 miles per gallon, 3/12 = a cost of
$0.25 per mile.

Now calculate cost/mile for a scooter at 85 MPG: 3/85 = about $0.035
- about three and a half cents a mile.

With these figures, it is simple to see that each mile on a scooter
costs $0.215 less than it would in an SUV.

Thus, you can see your savings on your scooter's odometer. When it
reaches 5000 miles, you will have saved 5000 * $0.215 or $1075.00. It
is clear that, if you have purchased an inexpensive scooter,
before your scooter registers 10,000 miles, it will have paid for the
cost of the scooter and insurance, and be keeping significant savings
in your pocket - even if your car gets a good deal better than 12
MPG.

I guess your poor little miserable life isn't worth three dollars a gallon.

"Scooters" are the most dangerous thing going.  The people I see riding
"scooters" wear no helmet.  They have no license plate.  They have little
experience driving a motorscooter, thusly do things terribly dangerous.

They ride in the gutters.  They go slower than traffic.  They cut between
cars.  I have seen them riding double on sidewalks.  They don't have a clue
as to how to ride the things, and the law doesn't put many restrictions on
them.  They are told by the salesmen that they don't need a license.

Two words best describe "scooter drivers."

If you're gonna use a scooter, you might as well use a bike.

Believe it or not, the license plate has no impact on safety.
