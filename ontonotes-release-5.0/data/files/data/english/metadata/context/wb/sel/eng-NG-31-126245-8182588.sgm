I came across this while looking for a good, accepted translation of
タオルケット and thought it might be useful for others:

http://nihongodecarenavi.jp/index.html

&quot;Nihongo de Care-navi is a Japanese-English / English-Japanese
dictionary with useful expressions in nursing and caretaking scenes for
supporting your Japanese Language learning.&quot;

As the site's stated mission implies, it does contain a lot of really
basic stuff, but there's some good jargon in there as well.  It doesn't
look like you'll be treated to the kanji unless you're using the
Japanese interface; you can switch between interfaces at any time by
clicking the language button at the top right.

&lt;aside&gt;Speaking of kanji, I was just reading a kind of manga-blog by
someone working in Japan &quot;as [the] translator in a software company&quot;,
drawing several sketches of himself apparently translating computer
terms at a keyboard.  Later, he noted that someone who could read kanji
could do a whole lot with the buttons on a washlet panel, but as someone
who did not read kanji, he was totally in the dark.  Yadda yadda yadda,
hilarity ensues.
What really flabbergasted me was that someone supposedly working as a
translator--in Japan, no less, and in-house--could actually not read
kanji.  Is this even possible?
I guess this is a rhetorical question, but if anyone feels like
answering, he or she should probably make a new thread for it.&lt;/aside&gt;

I suppose the English interface is aimed at foreign healthcare workers
working in Japan. They might be expected to learn a minimum of Japanese to
help them care for their Japanese-speaking charges, but full mastery of the
written Japanese language including kanji might be a tall order.

Unfortunately not.  In later &quot;episodes&quot;, the author talks about the
&quot;intuitive translation&quot; he gives to the trucks announcing the direction
they are about to turn, and when asked about Japanese slang, says &quot;you
have to understand Japanese to see how [Shibuya slang] works (*and I
don't!*)&quot;.  He also asks a friend to accompany him on one outing &quot;in
view of [his] meager Japanese skills&quot; and brings an interpreter along on
a trip to a swordsmith, which I might understand if you want to pin down
the more technical terms (assuming the interpreter is familiar with them
him- or herself).

What kind of translator *is* this, anyway?

I think that you have encountered a person who &quot;translates&quot; culture, not
language.

Such persons exist in game software or manga boutiques, with the ability to
write &quot;cool&quot; lines for the characters in the target language, but without
knowing the original languagel...

When I watch manga here in America that has been dubbed into English, I
sometimes find myself wondering if the dialogue has anything to do with the
original Japanese at all...

I was asked this question years ago when I applied to an agency for a
freelance position. I didn't understand it either, and wondering what kind
of company would ask a question of that sort, asked them in turn why they
were asking.

They explained that (in those days, anyway) Japanese wives sometimes would
read the text for their foreigner translator husbands and tell them the
readings of the kanji.

They wanted to know if I was one of those kind of translators. Evidently,
once upon a time, they were able to make a living.

I don't think so.  He really just reports the culture, and his full-time
job is as a technical computer software translator.  If the sample
text shown in his &quot;at work&quot; panels are to be believed, he translates
stuff of the &quot;invalid bitrate control algorithm&quot; variety.  Unless it's
all in katakana...

Seriously?  I encountered my first (definitely not my last) washlet on
my first trip to Japan, 13 years ago today.  My dad is so enamored of
them that he's getting one as a belated Father's Day present.

My goodness.  That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?

I agree, that's about the only scenario in which I can picture a
so-called translator not being able to read kanji/much Japanese.  One
would hope this kind of thing doesn't happen much anymore.

At the risk of dating myself here, I cut my translation teeth working
in-house at an agency that had been founded in the 1950s by a GI who married
a Japanese woman and decided to stay in Japan. In his decades in Japan he
never learned to read kanji, but his understanding of the language was good.
He had some very sharp marketing people (Japanese), a handful of in-house
translators (mostly Mormons who decided to stay in Japan beyond their
missionary terms), and a crew of six or eight Japanese &quot;OLs&quot; who transcribed
every text into romaji as a prep step for translation. Crude but effective.
This was before word processors of any kind. For me, this was a tremendous
learning-aid, as I was actively memorizing kanji. Last I knew (within the
past couple of years), that agency was still in business.

I was equally stunned to read Terry's tell-all.  I guess it just goes to
show that any manner of practices can be pulled off if there's a System

I was wondering if he &quot;translated&quot; Japanese in the same way that Ezra
Pound &quot;translated&quot; classical Chinese poetry,  i.e. by taking someone
else's chokuyaku of the original and reworking it into poetic form.

When I first went to Japan back in the 1970s, there seemed to be as
many jobs for NES rewriters as for actual NES J&gt;E translators. The
fellow you refer to may be a remnant of this breed.

Way back whenly yours,

When I was a Mormon missionary we were not allowed to study kanji, as it was
considered a distraction from our real work there. (Some people just got too
into the kanji, and forgot to study things that were relatively more
important.)

I could not imagine trying to read romanized Japanese -- too many
homophones. I get very confused when trying to read hiragana sometimes,
without the kanji to direct the meanings. I am ashamed to admit that I have
the opposite problem though-- sometimes I don't know how the kanji are
pronounced, even for some very common words, and I find myself reaching for
familiar words in conversation, only to discover that I don't know how to
pronounce them!

What about kanji-illiterate interpreters! I don't understand how anyone could interpret without being able to read. I am often asked &quot;so can you actually read and write as well?&quot; and I often wonder what peoples' concept of a translator or interpreter is, that they could imagine a person paid to manage the language barrier problems that are beyond their capabilities, could be at the same time functionally illiterate??

I can quite believe this. A couple of years ago I came joint second in
a newspaper translation contest. When I went up to the award ceremony,
I was astonished to hear the winner tell me that he couldn't read
kanji - and didn't know much Japanese for that matter.. He had scanned
the passage into his computer, then exported it to Word and used the
furigana function to bring up the readings. He then looked all the
words up in a paper dictionary and wrote the translation, which,
needless to say, was rather good. The other co-runner up (also a pro
translator) and I, as you might well imagine, felt rather cheated!

Wow. That is just bizarre. I just assumed that one of the requirements of being a translator was the capability to not only read newspapers, magazines, novels, textbooks, and such other everyday text with little or no aide from a dictionary but also the ability to accurately and naturally convey it in your native language. If they are symbols you have never seen that represent words that you've never heard, how could you presume to translate anything accurately? This &quot;thread&quot; (don't know what else to call it) has really opened my eyes to this chilling reality that there are people like that out there.

I've always wondered why Japanese people who I've already told my profession to ask me &quot;So, can you read Japanese?&quot; In general, my usual response is something like, &quot;If I couldn't, I wouldn't be able to do my job...&quot; or &quot;Didn't I just tell you what I do for a living?&quot; Me saying that I was a translator should have included the meaning that I can speak, understand, read, and write Japanese. Perhaps this kanji-illiterate translator thing is actually not so rare...

In a way, perhaps the fact that he was looking at &quot;symbols he'd never
seen that represented words he had never heard&quot; helped him. He
labelled the words with English equivalents, and must have then used
them almost like cue cards to construct some kind of meaning in his
head, which he would have then expressed in pure, natural English
completely untainted by the sentence structure and style of the
original Japanese.

Am I the only one who thinks this sounds fishy? A very poor grasp of written
Japanese I can buy, but turning out an award-winning translation from a
word-by-word gloss, with almost no understanding of the Japanese language,
sounds impossible. I think he may have had outside help.

I was once in a Russian reading course for graduate students with
someone who followed that procedure. She would recognize a few words
out of a sentence and then make up the connections among them herself.
She was one of those irritating language students who asks, &quot;Why
couldn't it mean [what I think it ought to mean instead of what it
really means]?&quot; If the course had last longer than a ten-week summer
session, either the instructor or the other students (who actually
tried to follow the grammatical cues) would have murdered her.

&gt;&gt; Wow. That is just bizarre. I just assumed that one of the

&gt;&gt; everyday text with little or no aide from a dictionary but also the
&gt;&gt; ability to accurately and naturally convey it in your native

&gt;&gt; anything accurately? This &quot;thread&quot; (don't know what else to call it)
&gt;&gt; has really opened my eyes to this chilling reality that there are
&gt;&gt; people like that out there.

&gt;&gt; I've always wondered why Japanese people who I've already told my

&gt;&gt; usual response is something like, &quot;If I couldn't, I wouldn't be able
&gt;&gt; to do my job...&quot; or &quot;Didn't I just tell you what I do for a living?&quot;
&gt;&gt; Me saying that I was a translator should have included the meaning
&gt;&gt; that I can speak, understand, read, and write Japanese. Perhaps this

To take this concept of kanji-illiterate translators to its extreme,
we can ask,
(1) Can a blind person be an interpreter?
(1a) Can born-sighted blind person be an interpreter?
(1b) Can a born-blind blind person be an interpreter?
(2) Can a blind person be a translator?
(2a) Can born-sighted blind person be a translator?
(2b) Can a born-blind blind person be a translator?

It seems to me that the answer for (1) is Yes in both cases,
and for (2) is Yes in both cases, given some visual-to-aural
or text-to-Braille system.
One possible text-to-Braille system could be an m-by-n
raster of touch-points that the blind translator wears on his
back, under his clothing.  Each of the m*n &quot;touchers&quot; of the
blind translator's back-mounted raster either touches the skin on
his back or not, forming a tactile picture of whatever is being
scanned by an input device.

&gt;&gt;I was astonished to hear the winner tell me that he couldn't read
kanji - and didn't know much Japanese for that matter.&lt;&lt;

I can believe that. I had a desire recently to translate a song from
Welsh, partly because I wanted to know what it said, and partly just
because Welsh has &quot;a reputation&quot; for variability in consonant sounds. I
don't speak any Welsh at all and have never heard it spoken outside that
song. It took me a while, but it's entirely possible - everything you
know about other languages and literatures can of course be brought into
play when you look at a new language.

Although I don't think learning kanji was a waste of my time &lt;g&gt;, the
happy or unhappy truth is that target-language ability may be the only
thing a translator/translation is assessed on in the end!

I don't think she does (believe that). But then, what matters is that
the meaning is conveyed. Or at least enough of the meaning to make
the reader satisfied.

Now, more than this kanji literacy issue, what about translators who
are asked to work in fields they have no knowledge whatsoever of ?
You can read the kanji but that does not help much does it ?

As Mark wrote, it is entirely possible to not be physically able to
read the stuff and still to know (way) enough of the language to be
able to translate it. Blind people do that all the time, and they do
music too and plenty of other fantastic stuff that we can't imagine
are possible without some sort of basic reading ability. How wrong
are we !

Reading is only one part of the learning process, it is far from
being all of it and it can be replaced by other processes if necessary.

Btw, sound+context also happens to be _the_ primary way to learn a
language too. Reading/writing is only one way to intensively practice
a few limited patterns in the language.

No, of course not - I don't even know enough Welsh to assess the validity of other people's assessments of my educated guesses. The man who won the translation contest knew some Japanese, so he was obviously way ahead of me! I simply wanted to say that it is not hard for somebody experienced in manipulating language to produce something convincing in the target language - I'm not talking about quality. With 2 hours of reading one Welsh song under my belt, I'm hardly in a position to claim perfection.

Sorry if I didn't make my thoughts clearer: 1) much as we value our
source-language skills, those who assess our work may be focusing much
more on our target-language skills. If I produce a song that scans and
reads flowingly in English, it immediately becomes more credible than a
clumsy translation and I find it scary how far that takes me. People
will walk past a more accurate translation if it doesn't read well - and
if the reader won't read a translation, it certainly isn't doing a good
job of transmitting information. Whether a translation that people won't
read is accurate or inaccurate is almost beside the point, don't you
think? (I'm not talking about other entries in the competition by the
way, just positing two extremes). 2) Although I know how much is missing
from a &quot;translation&quot; done this way, I think that we miss a valuable
point when we poo-pooh the fact that people who work this way win prizes
and stay in business - target-language skills are market-oriented
skills. We shouldn't find it regrettable that people place such a high
value on the target translation, we should just recognize that it is so!

In which case the reader may well be satisfied with a work which was
essentially CREATED by the &quot;translator&quot;, and bears little ir any resemblence

This is not a new problem, however.

Well, OK, I'll come out and say it, the performer of the song said my
version was &quot;very close&quot; - I'd mistaken the subject in one sentence,
because I only have a sketchy understanding of how Welsh verbs
conjugate. As I said before, I'm unable to say whether his kind comment
was anything more than kind. (Nor do I intend to make a habit of this
method of working - I'm just not quite ready to assume that a translator
with a &quot;not all that good&quot; understanding of Japanese is totally
incapable. Translation does demand many skills, as we know, and
source-language skills are just part of the mix).

I don't think it's quite as impossible to figure out meaning as you
suggest - we are all human, and in many cases, we have or can gain an
understanding of the subject matter or surrounding context which will
help us narrow the meaning, and as experienced translators, I believe we
have an additional understanding of language and diction. Further, we
have some idea of the pitfalls which might lead us to jump to wrong
conclusions in establishing meaning.

If we travel in a country where we don't speak the language, context and
gesture may help us a great deal. Why shouldn't similar written
resources have some part to play in understanding written language?

As someone who's learning Japanese (with the aid of grammar books, a big Kenkyusha dictionary I bought years ago in a used book store, the Rosetta Stone online language program, and Studio Ghibli films), and who already knows lots of kanji (thanks to my knowledge of Chinese), I find the use of hiragana, katakana, and kanji in written Japanese to be very helpful in telling one word apart from another. It's my impression that the different writing systems used simultaneously in Japanese work a bit like the capital letters to indicate nouns in German (they set words apart and give an indication of grammatical function). Even after all these years, I sometimes have to think twice before I figure out which characters go together in Chinese (and I occasionally get it wrong).

Learning Japanese is so much fun, and the sound of the language is so beautiful, that it's keeping me from doing my own work (which is Chinese-English translation). Maybe I'll visit Japan one day...

I have translated many songs from Portuguese, Latin, and even Esperanto
with what I know of French, dictionaries, linguistics in general, and
Google.  Yet I would never purport to be a translator of those languages,
as I'm sure you would never claim to be a Welsh-English translator.

As Jean-Cristophe points out, reading is only one part of the language
process, but it is a very useful part that speeds up the learning process in
that you learn how people express their thoughts about certain subjects. I
think that perhaps in some languages, though, like Spanish, for example,
inability to read the source language (assuming literacy in one's own
language) may not be such a disadvantage, but in Japanese there are so many
homonyms that a knowledge of kanji is almost necessary, I think, to truly
understand meaning. At the very least it is *very* helpful. I studied Latin
in high school (yes, I'm one of those strange ones!), and it definitely
helped me with my understanding of my own language. It certainly helped me
out on the SAT and GRE! Using an exam metaphor, kanji is to Japanese as
Latin is to English! They are the building blocks of the language.

Mari,

I would certainly not deny that. And kanji is definitely _the_ wall
that keeps me from _enjoying_ Japanese as fully as I should (or
should I ?)

Here, I'd rather say an understanding of the structure of words is
necessary rather than a thorough knowledge of kanji. Words (homonyms)
don't come without context and even without the _image_ of the sound
that is the kanji, it is easy to say &quot;hankou&quot; with &quot;han&quot; as in
&quot;hantai&quot; ?

I'd say that especially in Japanese, it is the hearing that supports
the reading more than the opposite _because_ it is possible to get a
word's meaning _without_ being able to sound out the kanjis.

In alphabet based languages, once the (limited) written system is
understood it is possible to connect the reading to the sound the
word actually makes, which I think is what helps the learning
process. It is not just &quot;reading&quot; that is involved but actually
sounding out the word (even if in one's mind), and even if the
pronunciation is mistaken, it is _systematically_ mistaken so when
the system is corrected it is easier to leverage the memorized sounds
into actual speech.

That's not very likely to happen on this, a list by and for *Japanese*
