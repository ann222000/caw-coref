Hi,

I own a 2002 307 XS.
I use to drive with working headlights during day hours.
When I do so, all the illumination of the controls around the dashboard
turn to night mode as well as the Air Condition illumination.
I find it very uncomfortable no to be able to read the display due to
the low illumination. This cannot be changed by using the illumination
switch.

Does anybody has a solution.
BTW, I do not use the Lights Always On config but start the headlights
manually.

Thanks,
Oren

The solution is not to have your headlights on, in bright light !

You only need to use them in dim light - hence, the dimmed dashboard remains
readable.

Quite simply, stop doing that. Problem solved :)

funny, but still doesn't solve the issue...
BTW, there are several countries where during certain dates in the year
even if there is a direct sun-light, then you MUST BY LAW turn your
headlights...

You can always adjust the display brightness to the highest setting, use the
left hand button on the instrument panel (infront of the steering wheel) and
pressing it and holding the brightness will go up then down again. just let
go when it's at its brightest setting. Of course then the dashboard will
probably be too bright for night time!

Chris,

I'm aware of that feature yet, it doesn't get bright enough (the A/C
display).
I thought of something that will disable the display from going dim...
