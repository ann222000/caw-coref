Well maybe not too far OT if the printer is used to print out some of
your rcw posts.

My jenuwine like new hp 812C is out of ink and new cartridges cost more
locally than a parting tool. Are refill kits a good deal and easy for a
shadetree mechanic to use? Are there different quality kits or are all
refill kits mostly the same?  Any suggestions?  I know, I know, enter
the 21st C. Arch, and get a real computer and laser printer. You ought
to see some of my tools. :)

The ink is difficult to get into the cartridge and most people that I've
known to use them end up breaking the tops off the cartridge to allow
easier refilling (until one spills inside the printer and then you have
one heck of a mess).

Look into the cartridge refilling done by one of the office supply
places (OfficeMax, Office Depot, etc.).  They test the cartridge before
filling and the cost is about 50% that of a new cartridge.  It takes
them about 10 minutes to refill one.

Arch,

I'll second this. I bought one of the kits and ended up with ink all over
the place. Fortunately not in the printer, as the cartridge never got
that far. Next time, I'll use one of the refillers. IIRC, even Wallgreens
does cartridge refills.

I have been refilling my cartridges for years. The ones I am using now
have a plug in the top which you punch out for the first refill. I got
the kit from Sam's and it has full instructions. You use a syringe (you
know how to operate one of those) to refill it. The only problem is when
you let it run completely dry. Sometimes it will not re-start, but often
just sitting the print head part on a damp paper towel after refilling
will loosen the dry ink and it will start working.

To verify which chamber has what color ink in it, after punching out the
plug stick a long 21 ga needle into the fiber filling and wipe it off on
a paper towel to see the color.  I always refill mine in the shop, where
an accident is not as big a deal as it would be on the kitchen table.
DAMHIKT.

They practically give away the printer knowing that most folks will make
it up buying those expensive cartridges.

Hello Arch,

Years ago I refilled my ink jet cartridges (black only), but found it
too much trouble. I mostly use a laser printer these days; however, if
you are complaining about the cost of ink jet cartridges, don't get a
laser printer. It costs almost as much as I paid for the printer to buy
all four toner cartridges for my laser prnter, maybe more. I agree they
almost give the printers away and make up the difference in selling you
replacement ink or toner cartridges.

Arch theres bunches of good info here so far.

But I want to add.

I have refilled mine since refill kits could be bought. The one
significant thing that will make you happy is this.

Obtain some hypodermic needles, like the kind diabetics use. They will
hold 3ml or 15cc. Get one for each color of red, blue, yellow and
black.

Write the name of the color on scotch tape and put the tape around the
barrel of the hypo.

Dont throw away the plastic sheath protector for the needle end. You
will need it to store your needles for future use.

When you remove the label from the cartridge this exposes the fill
holes. Get two wooden toothpicks (dont turn these). Stick a clean end
of the toothpick in a hole, identify what color that hole is, and label
that hole for the next time. Do this for the remaining 2 colors.

Dont wait until your cartridge runs completely out of a color. When
this happens the printer bakes the output hole and stops up the flow,
so refilling it wont do you a bit of good. Instead, when you notice the
least bit of color washout, remove the cartridge right then and refill
all colors.

Your cartridge is a sponge. You cant just pour ink in the hole and it
soaks it up. What you have to do is fill your hypo syringe to about 1/3
to 1/2 full. Now slowly insert the needle into the hole, keep going
until the needle bottoms out. You want to fill the sponge from the
bottom up. Then, very, very slowly, apply pressure to the syringe. Just
enough for the ink to start going in. All the while keep your eyes on
the hole you are in. If you see ink start to overfill, stop, thats all
it can hold.

The cartridge works on very small venting. When finished refilling,
cover holes back up with scotch tape, and rub it firmly to make sure it
seals. There are channels cut on the surface of HP cartridges that the
label goes over. Those channels end up exposed so that there is a way
to releive vacaumm as the ink is used. Tape up after filling just like
your old label size.

When you are done with one syringe, hold it over the trashcan, rapidly
move the plunger in and out to expunge any residue ink in the needle.
If you dont, the ink will dry and stop up your needle. I always purge
my needles with the cleaning solution that comes with the refill kits
to make sure no ink is left behind.

If you have been going to the same drug store for years, and the owner
knows you, he will probably let you have 4 syringes or charge you very
little for them. Otherwise, getting them without a prescription is
hard.

If your printer has tools, which include a display of your current ink
levels, use this if you even suspect you are running low on a color.
Open the tools and look at your levels. If its half full or less,
refill it then. Dont let it run completely out. If you do this, you
will be able to refill this same cartridge as many as 10 times, I have
done it.

Remember. If you run completely out of a color, go buy a new cartridge
and just keep an eye on the levels. It wont ever put out that color it
ran out of again. The printer designers make sure of that, forcing you
to get a new one.

beware that some HP cartriges have "anti refill" logic in them - they have a
timer that makes the cartrige inoperative a certain number of days after
installing it, even if you don't use it at all. Be sure yours is not one of
them - to check this out, you could check ed foster's column (gripline) via
infoworld, or do a search for your model and just double check.
The information (actually the cartrige serial number) is encoded deep within
the windows registry - I think there is a software tool for cleaning the
information out so you can use a cartrige that has "timed out", but I don't
have such a printer so I've never really tried to solve this problem.   This
is part of the great decline of HP from a premium brand to scum of the
earth.....

Arch -

For printing out text, refills are fine.  For photos, my experience has
been iffy.

In line with what Fred Holder said, don't expect savings from a laser
printer if you are going color.

But like me, if you go black only, you will cut your cost way down.  I
have Samsung laser that I use for letters, contracts, web receipts,
etc.  It was under $100 when I bought it, and it came with a black
laser cartridge that printed 1000 pages.  The replacement cartridge was
$70, and depending on how much printing I do my cost per page should be
anywhere from 2.3 to 2.6 cents a page (toner only) since it is rated at
3000 pages for the XT cartridge in it.

I loved all my HP lasers in the past and in the last four printers I
have owned this is my first non-HP.  But they just got too expensive
and the quality seemed to drop off.  Then the toner cartridge prices
jumped way up... so I went to Samsung.

They have a nifty printer (ML2510) that prints a pretty mean B&amp;W
graphic now at about 1200X600, 25 sheets a minute,  and it is only $129
at Circuit City with free shipping.  Text on it is great.  Toner
cartridge is said to be refillable.

The printer that replaced mine is a ML2040, or something like that, and
it doesn't have the resolution or paper capacity, and is only $10 less.
However, the ML2040 is on sale frequently so you should be able to do
better than $119 if you can wait.

I don't own an inkjet as I can't use them in my business.  So when I
need a photo printed, I find the one I want to print and go to
Walgreen's, or any of the other places that guarantee their work and
have it done there.

Refill kits work to a point.  It'll depend on the cartridge style and
how long it's been sitting.  I found that it works pretty good about
50% of the time, and the cartridge just clogs up the rest of the time.
It's messy, and is a PITA, but may save some $$$.  After doing it a
few times, I came to the conclusion that it was like building a second
lathe... :)

A little tip for economy, though- the kits at discount stores only
give you a refill or two.  If you get a kit for $20 (the price may
have changed, of course) from Sam's Club, there's enough ink in it to
last for a long, long time.  IIRC, there are about two pints of black,
and one pint each of the three colors, along with all the stuff you'll
need to try it out.

That just answered a really old question of mine- namely, how in the
hell can I run out of ink after printing only three or four pages over
the course of several months?

Knowing that, I might actually bother trying to maintain a working
printer again one of these days- the $40 cartridge price tag to get a
couple of printed sheets just made me give up on the whole deal.

The best/cheapest way to maintain print quality is a continuous flow
system like http://www.inksupply.com/cobra.cfm .  These include new heads
designed for their inks.  Most refill kits use inferior ink, and the
original cartridges are not designed for refilling, but designed to wear
out when the ink is gone.

Pictures can always be printed cheaper by a lab than you can do it at
home, and often with better quality.  Costco, Sams, Walmart, etc., do a
good job on snapshots, and I use Mpix.com for high quality prints at
$1.99 for an 8x10.

Arch,
I have used Epson printers for many years so what I have to say might
not apply, but I'd recommend that you go to eBay and look up a company
called "digitgo". I've been buying from them for over a year and have
had MAYBE one dud. It seems that I remember a dud ... but it could
simply be that I tried to re-insert the old cartridge.

To give you an example fo their prices, and my level of confidence in
them, I just bought a 32-pack (8 complete cartridge changes) for about
$52. These are brand new, NOT refills.

Bill

&gt;&gt;don't
&gt;&gt;have such a printer so I've never really tried to solve this problem.
&gt;&gt;This
&gt;&gt;is part of the great decline of HP from a premium brand to scum of the
&gt;&gt;earth.....

&gt; That just answered a really old question of mine- namely, how in the
&gt; hell can I run out of ink after printing only three or four pages over
&gt; the course of several months?

&gt; Knowing that, I might actually bother trying to maintain a working
&gt; printer again one of these days- the $40 cartridge price tag to get a
&gt; couple of printed sheets just made me give up on the whole deal.

Andy, to tell the truth, I've only used them for the past year or so.

I'm not using archival quality paper, so archival quality ink probably
doesn't have much impact. In that year I have not noticed any fading
soever but it's not as if I have been doing "A" - "B" tests. Most stuff
I print either hits the mailbox right away or, if for future reference,
gets tossed in a 3-ring binder.

If I think I'll need to preserve a photo, I scan it and write it to CD.

This is an interesting thread.

Everyone has to make their own decision about refilling.  I have been
refilling my printer ink cartrages since 1992. I was printing a church
newsletter that went into 3 churches and out to a mailing list.

I chose a HP 500 for my printer because the cartrages could be
refilled. that printer used a black cartrage, and if you wanted color
then you substituted a color cartrage in place of the black.  I
refilled only the black.

I did not buy refill kits, for there was virtually none at that time,
but rather I found a place where I could buy the ink in bulk, with the
smallest container being 4.5 oz of ink, then cam 18 oz and gal size.
those same size bottles of ink is still being sold by them today. A
very good quality ink, which has only been improved over the years.  I
started with a small bottle and quickly graduated to the gal of ink
size.

The man who owns and operates that company will bend over backwards to
help you with any print refill problems, giving full instructions for
how to refill any make of ink cartrage. He will take the time to talk
to you, and not just taking an order. He also provides any thing
needed at a price which is so much lower than any refill kit on the
market today.

My first HP 500, I could refill the cartrage between 15 to 30 times
before failure of the cartrage which has the print head built into
every cartrage.  I do not remember how many times that I refilled, but
I was using a gal of ink every 8 to 12 months. I calculated that in
the first 5 years of my refilling, that I saved in excess of $55,000
in print cartrage cost. I wore out three of those printers.

Then I bought three of newer HP printer which had the black and color
cartrage side by side, but it was a piece of junk. Most of the color
cartrages would not last long enough to even use up the ink in it,
before there was a print head failure.
And the black cartrages, I could at the best get 2-3 refills before a
print head failure. That cost so much money for me that I junked them
and bought the Canon S600 printers, two of them,  which had 4
cartrages, a black and three colors, all held liquid ink, and those
cartrages were each refilled several hundred times without having any
failure.  The printers themselves failed the print head first, as the
print head was seperate from the ink cartrage. Many days I printed
enough to refill the cartrages ever couple of hours. I wore those
printers out and upgraded to new printers. My refill cost was less
than one cent a refill at that time.

Now I have the Canon IP4200.  This printer does have a memory of the
cartrages, and knows when you put in a refilled cartrage, then after
some dire warning of how you will now probably blow up the world or
something like that, will then allow you to continue printing forever
with refilled cartrages. It just will, for a punishment, stop telling
you when an ink cartrage is going empty, so you have to look from time
to time. Now I have not counted how many times that I have refilled
the cartrages for these printers, but I know that it is aproaching
close to 100 at this time with out a failure. Now my refill cost is
higher because I buy smaller quanities of ink, but still is only a
couple of cents per black cartrage and the color cartrages use less
ink so each refill there cost less.

I have three of these printers that I feed. One is for my printing,
one is for my wife's printing, and one is a new in the box backup
which I bought for the ink cartrages that came with it. that gives me
a spare set of ink cartrages that I can just swap out when in the
middle of a print job.

Note that it was cheaper to buy a new complete printer on Ebay than it
was to buy even one conplete set of ink cartrages for it. And that
also gives me a spare print head for the price, and a new printer if
one of ours fails for any reason.

If you are really thinking of the possibility of refilling your ink
cartrages, regardless of brand, then try giving a call to

V-Tech Inc.
(215) 362 - 3300
or write to   v ... @comcast.net

With your questions. Then you can decide if you want to refill or not.

And yes!! not all inks are the same, and not all inks will work in all
brands of cartrages. That has always been the problem with those
refill kits being sold in the stores, they use only one type of ink,
and many times it clogs up your print head because it is the wrong ink
for your printer.  And even between the same brand of printers, there
are different inks, where the ink will work in one model but not in
another model of the same printer make. That is why you need to talk
to an expert in inks who can supply you with the correct ink that will
work in your printer.

Have Fun

You ask why? This is the reason why.

I ask you to keep in mind that the cost of a toner cartage is Not the
only cost of printing. From time to time you will also have to replace
the Drum, so the cost of the drum has to be calculated into the actual
cost of printing a page. So a used laser printer can be expected to
need the Drum replaced now, not later. That is one reason they get
sold. Those drums are expensive. The other reason they are sold is
because they are causing more troubles for the owner than he wants, so
he buys a new one and passes on to you all of his troubles.

However, if you are only printing a hundred pages a year, go for it.
But if you are going 5,000 pages a year or more, every penny saved
adds up to dollars in your pocket.

And I offer for your consideration the following answer which I gave
to another man not long ago who was comparing cost against cost.  You
would be surprised at how many commercial printing companies are using
inkjet printers. Not with replaceable ink cartridges, but with
continuous ink feed to the special modified cartages. This keeps their
printers running continuous for 6 to 8 hours a day. They never run out
of ink in the middle of a print job.

Besides the black printing, many pages also require some color
printing on the page also. And when you start buying color toner
cartages, you had better have lots of money to spend.

And I doubt seriously if you will come anywhere near the number of
pages printed per toner cartage as they advertise. See below as for
why.
______________________

Yes I see that the cost of Laser Toner has come down a whole lot since
I had a Laser printer. That is for the Black only.  The color toner is
still way up there.  I looked up some printers and toner cartages in
the Office Depot catalog.

I will tell you a little secret though, about their claims of how many
pages that you can print with one of their toner cartages.  Their
count is based upon what they call a standard business letter, which
has very little actual witting on it.   The average printing you see
on a normal page letter that you or I would write as a letter to
someone has considerably more letters and words printed on it than
that "Standard" page.  So you will not get anything near what they
claim that they do.

I give you the following as examples. The first is from Hewlett-
Packard, but look out for what they are saying.  They are indicating
that you can completely fill a page with printing which IS NOT a
standard business page.  On the one hand they tell you that their
toner cartages will print X number of Standard Business pages per
cartage. Period.

The following was given in answer to some school district where the
cost of printing school pages, per page, was high. Whoever gave this
answer figured it just as you, and many others do. However the amount
of the page being printed in a Standard Business letter comes no where
near to what is claimed here. See below for two examples of what a
standard Business letter consist of, and compare it to the claim of
virtually filling in a solid block of text on a page of being 6.5
inches across by 9 inches high.
___________________

Toner Usage   (What is said here is False, a standard business
letter is not what is claimed here. - Jack)

The Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4000TN is a laser printer. Instead of
the typical home printer which sprays fine ink dots on the paper, the
4000TN uses a laser and the same electrostatic principles as
photocopiers. The 4000TN uses the HP model number C8061X toner
cartridge. This cartridge is a professional-volume cartridge, which
retails for $127.00 and has a page yield of 10,000. The ten thousand-
page figure is based on each page consisting of a standard business
letter.

Hence, the average toner cost per page is $127 divided by ten
thousand. This results in a figure of 1.27 cents per page. This result
is further substantiated by the published results of Hewlett-Packard's
own calculations on per page printing costs. A standard business
letter from which the aforementioned ten-thousand page figure is
derived, consists of 56 lines at the nominal Times New Roman font,
with the font size being 10 point. With standard one-inch margins,
this equates to 6.5 inches across for most lines. Thus, a standard
business letter can be defined as approximately 364 inches of
horizontal text. Measurement of the source review template paper shows
it to have 34.625 inches of horizontal text. The lower text amount
causes the source review template paper to cost 1.27*34.625/364, or
0.1208 cents per page. Thusly, thirty source review templates consume
only 3.624 cents worth of toner cartridge.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

And from Xerox,  Now here is what a standard Business letter consist
of.  the part printed is only the black text.  Note how little black
is laid down on the paper compared to all the white space. The color
at the side and the top line, is Pre printed on a printing press,
consider that area as part of the white unprinted area..  You see that
this comes no where near what is claimed above.

(picture of page would have been printed here, but cannot be shown in
this group.)

And the following is also shown, and is being taught as being a
typical standard business letter. Again note the small area actually
covered with the black ink as compared to the total white space on the
page. The center block in a red box is the actual area where text will
go, the margins, and the total of the black box is the whole sheet.

The standard Business letter to which all the printer manufactures
refers is as you see in the letter above and in this letter. So double
the amount of text and use twice the amount of ink, resulting in
printing only 1/2 of the claimed number of pages.

Your letter should follow a standard business letter format, such
as the following. Use white or ivory stationery, and sign your letter
in blue or black ink.

On my ink cartages which they claimed would do 2000 pages, I actually
got , by counting every page printed, about 800 pages printed till the
cartage was empty.  Out of ink.  That was for my newsletter which
printed considerably more per page than the standard business letter
they based it upon.  You see, the more that you print on a page, the
more surface that you actually cover on the sheet of paper, the more
ink that you will use.  Obvious? Not really, for most never really get
into it, or give it any thought.  How heavy or dark you make your
printing makes a big difference also. Which font you use makes a
difference also, many times greatly. A courier font will use much less
ink than will something like this Times New Times Roman font.

(This next paragraph was originally printed in Courier style to show
the difference. Since it cannot be shown here, take this paragraph to
your word processor and convert it to Courier style text to see the
difference.)

This is Courier style text, note that the letters are very much
thinner and so uses less actual ink, or toner, the letters are also
spread out more which again results in less ink being used on a page.

Well, I do not count pages any more.  And I do not think that you need
to count pages printed by your toner cartage either. But what I would
suggest is that depending on what you are printing, that you figure
only being able to print from 1000 to 1200 pages per toner cartage
which claims 3600 pages. If you get more than that,  then so much the
better.  As it is, at those prices quoted by you, you will not have
any problem at all.  And refilling your own is the way to go. Most
people are not into that.  If you do much printing, then the cost
savings is well worth it.

I will suggest though, that if you do decide to buy yourself a color
Laser printer, that you consider this, I saw color laser printers as
low as $400 with a low dot per inch print pattern, and color toner
cartages (new) at about $116 each.  So I would suggest that if you go
that route, that the first time that you need another color toner
cartage, and knowing that all the other toner cartages would also be
about to run out, that you think of buying another printer of the same
make and type instead.  The reasoning goes like this, If you buy the
printer with toner cartages for around $400 and a complete set of
toner Cartages, black and color,  cost almost that price, that you are
better off to buy an entire new printer and keep the old toner
cartages to be refilled and swapped out the next time.  (There is
nothing like running out of ink in the middle of a print job. )  I did
that with both my laser printer and our ink jet printers, Right after
buying two new printers, one for me and one for my wife, It was
cheaper to buy another complete printer than it was to buy another set
of ink cartages to aid in

On most laser printers the drum is in the cartridge and when you

&gt;However, if you are only printing a hundred pages a year, go for it.

Yep, which is why most businesses use laser printers for any job than
doesn't require an inkjet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And I offer for your consideration the following answer which I gave
&gt;to another man not long ago who was comparing cost against cost.  You
&gt;would be surprised at how many commercial printing companies are using
&gt;inkjet printers. Not with replaceable ink cartridges, but with
&gt;continuous ink feed to the special modified cartages. This keeps their
&gt;printers running continuous for 6 to 8 hours a day. They never run out
&gt;of ink in the middle of a print job.
">

Not surprised at all.  But I would be very surprised if very many of
them were using them for production runs of a single document in black
or spot color, which is the use that you described.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Besides the black printing, many pages also require some color
&gt;printing on the page also. And when you start buying color toner
&gt;cartages, you had better have lots of money to spend.
">

About ten percent more than for black, if that, on most color lasers.
And the usage is generally lower.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And I doubt seriously if you will come anywhere near the number of
&gt;pages printed per toner cartage as they advertise. See below as for
&gt;why.
">

Depends on what you're printing.

IF you are refilling your own ink jet cartriges, wouldn't it be sensible to
compare the price of laser priners using refilled cartriges?  It looks like
you have an anlysis carefully tuned to support the conclusion you want - but
you know what?  It doesn't matter, this is not my problem, I was just
curious and you have answered the question - thanks.

now back to wood turning

&gt; if you are printing as much as you describe, you would save $$ using a
&gt; laser
&gt; printer - faster, cheaper, and better - particularly when 20 ppm laser

You ask why? This is the reason why.
