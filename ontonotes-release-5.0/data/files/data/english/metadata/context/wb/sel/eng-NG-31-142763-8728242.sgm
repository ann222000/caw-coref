Dear All,

TOD: Simran to be very effective must be constant and ceaseless

Once Moses, the Prophet of the Hebrews, felt that he was the most devoted of God's creatures. In an egotistic frame of mind, he questioned God if there was in the world a greater devotee than himself. The Great God told Moses that among His devotees were included many birds and animals besides human beings.

Pointing to a solitary bird in the jungle, God directed Moses to meet the said bird, if he wanted to know the great depths of devotion. As Moses did not know the language of the birds, God endowed him with an understanding so that he could talk with him. Moses approached the bird and inquired as to how he was. The bird replied that engaged as he was in constant remembrance (Simran) he could ill afford any time for a useless conversation except for the Beloved's sake who had sent him. Next the prophet asked the bird if he had any trouble in which he could be of any help to him. The bird replied that he had no trouble whatsoever, but if the prophet wished to do him a favour, he asked him to bring nearer to him the spring of water that lay at a distance, as a flight to it to quench his thirst interfered in his Simran. This incident humbled the pride of Moses.
