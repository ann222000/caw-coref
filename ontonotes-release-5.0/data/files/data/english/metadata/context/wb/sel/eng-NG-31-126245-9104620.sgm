Hi Everyone,

I do translating as a part time gig and received a request to
translate a 600 page engineering document by October 1st. I am only
JLPT level 3 (although 95%) so I can translate stuff but I imagine it
takes me a lot longer than a professional translator so I know that is
beyond my reach to attempt this. I have a couple of questions though:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the perspective the of a professional translator is it possible
">

to translate a document that size in that amount of time? (given that
roughly 15% is simply pictures with captions, 5% is circuit diagrams
that need translating, and the rest is technical documentation).

My second question is, and I apologize if this has been asked a
million or so times, does anyone have advice on how to increase their
level that of a professional translator (although not necessarily
become one since I've seen that thread many times before) given the
time constraints of a regular job and all that dang real life stuff
that gets in the way?

Thanks,
Mike Widman

A few basic questions:
- What is a &quot;page&quot;? Do you have  any sort of word count?
- Translation only? Any layout involved?
- Is the source in some electronic form you can actually work on, or is it
printed?
- What form do they want it back in? (for example, text file / PPT file /
text file with numbered callouts on the printed original / etc)

With answers to the above questions someone can probably answer this, too.

You do this job and you will be on the way to becoming a professional
translator. Like most abilities, it improves with practice (although inborn
and learned skills, not to mention various tools, certainly help...).

Assuming normal-sized pages, I wouldn't accept a 600-page job with a
deadline only two weeks away.

I've translated books of that length, and the client has always given
me several months to do the job.

Perspectively yours,

If you're a whiz at the material at hand, it might be possible, and
while it still depends on the font size, margins, etc., I think 19 days
is quite a stretch for 600 pages. I certainly would not do it by myself
unless the font and margins were unusually large.

To improve translation skills, in addition to actually translating, you
can take online courses such as at www.horsefrog.com . Studying Japanese
is also important. I had passed the 1級 five years before I started
translating professionally and couldn't believe my ineptness at kanji
(not to mention everything else about the Japanese language). The JLPT
is a great metric for general comprehension and competence, but
professional translating is the difference between passing a high school
English exam and writing a scholarly criticism for a literature journal.
Okay, hyperbole, but not by much.

Also, exposure is critical. The more exposure you have, the less
ambiguous a language becomes because you gain a sense of what is likely
meant. Even native speakers can be puzzled, though, by certain
sentences, so exposure to understand what the likely interpretation of a
sentence is important.

JLPT level 3 means you have completed the beginners level.  Forget about
translation (other than perhaps as a &quot;part time gig&quot;) until you have reached

600 pages at 200 words average per page is 120,000 words, to be completed by

Study Japanese until you reach the advanced level, then become a

Yeah, but what is a page?

Someone asked me the other day to quote them a price for translating
&quot;a 20 to 30 minute oral presentation.&quot; I had all I could do not to
laugh. The person making the request works for a manufacturer of
electrical wiring, so next time I see him, I suppose I could ask him
how much it would cost &quot;to wire an office,&quot; just to see if he gets it.
&lt;g&gt;

Anyway, my point is that the first thing I would advise you to do is
think in concrete terms, and measure your jobs in words and
characters, not pages or slides or paragraphs or other things that
vary in size.

Think about how many Japanese characters there are, and how many
characters you can translate in an hour. Then apply your rate to that
result to see how much you would make in an hour and decide whether or
not that is commensurate with the effort it will take to get the job
done. In your case, you might feel that relatively low remuneration is
a fair trade off for the experience you will gain, which is fine, too.

Anyway, just to give you a yardstick to start measuring with, I
generally try to translate at least 400 characters an hour.

So, if a 600 page document had an average of 400 characters per page
on it, I would want to budget at least 600 hours of time to get it
done. Might not actually take that long, but I would want my client to
think that it would take that long, and I definitely do not want my
client to know how much I can translate a day. Whenever a client asks
me to specify how much I can turn out in a day, I generally give them
a figure that is about half of what I can actually do if pressed.

As for the second half of your question, sticking with subject matter
that you know well is a good way to boost productivity, but if you
still consider yourself in the &quot;apprentice&quot; stage of your career, so
to speak, forget about efficiency and consider the time it takes to
get the job done well as an investment in the future.

FWIW

Me, too.

I hate &quot;me too&quot; messages as much as the rest of you, but this point really
deserves to be hammered home to anyone thinking about a career in
translation.

Always keep a reserve!  I assure you, you'll need it.

The short answer is NO.

The top translators in the world translate no more than about 2 million
words a year, or about 150,000/month (except in very unusual circumstances,
such as having extreme copyability between documents), assuming very little
time wasted in layout work.

If there are 600 pages with, lets say 500 words per page, that makes 300,000
words. You have about 2/3 month, so would have to translate at a rate of
450,000 words/month, which would take extreme effort for several of the very
top translators.

Engineering materials often have complicated equations. These tend to go
slowly, because the typing is slow. If you don't have equations, then there
are often layout issues.

For a single, relatively inexperienced translator, this is impossible
(assuming my 500 words per page assumption is even somewhat accurate, and
assuming that there is not massive internal copyability).

Yours,

Warren Smith

Just to add another point on the graph, I find this a very odd request.
An extremely short deadline for a very large document to be done
by an inexperienced translator.

This sounds like a request by someone who is totally clueless about
translation and might be in for some sticker shock. Maybe it's a vanity
publication or possibly someone who wants an entire Japanese book
translated for his own edification and thinks &quot;the book cost only
10000 yen, so translating it won't cost more than 50000 give or take.&quot;

In any case, it reeks like a project that won't transpire anyway.

It sounds to me more like a request from an agency that is trying to get a
job with a low-ball quote. If it were simply a private person that wanted a
translation for their own edification, I would not expect such a short
deadline.

If I were the OP, I would simply be realistic about their own translation
speed from past experience and their level of experience and convey this
information to the requester honestly. Deadlines may be flexible, so the OP
can tell the requester that he might be able to do the job if given a few
months.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Exactly. The OP certainly should not claim that he would be able to do the
entire translation by that unreasonable deadline, but he can negotiate. If
this is a deal-breaker, then so be it.

Thank you everyone for the wealth of information you've given. The
advice about using words instead pages as well as considering whether
it's in a digital medium or not makes a lot of sense. I used the Count
Anything program listed on this forum a while back to check how many
words it was:

The first PDF of 100 pages (converted to a .doc in order to run the
tool)

Words    Chars     Chars (no spaces)    Asian    Non-Asian Words
48,659     69,469    65,204                   43,627     5,032

So estimating for 600 pages it would be 291,954. Although I was
already inclined to decline the request this makes me a bit happier
that I did so.

In regards to the advice on how to improve translating, I agree that
practice is the best way to improve. I do wonder how one determines
the quality of their own translation though? Or do those training to
become professionals simply have others rate their translations?

Thanks again,
Mike Widman

Considering that there are 18 days to complete this translation before the
deadline, this makes more than 9,000 words per day (if we include a
conversion factor). I doubt any single translator working alone would be
able to deliver the entire translation for this deadline. This means that
they will certainly need to divide up the translation among multiple
translators in any case, if they wish to meet the deadline.

If you do still want to work on this job and perhaps get some experience,
instead of simply declining, you might suggest that you could take a piece
of the job. I would recommend taking an extremely small piece so that you
would have more than enough time to do it, considering your inexperience. If
you finish your bit early, they might send you more. Hopefully, the client
will provide feedback in this arrangement and you can improve your craft.

The client may simply not want to be bothered by dealing with you, and if
so, keep looking for something else.

Frankly, I don't know anything about the test you took or whether or not you
are qualified to take on professional translation. But you did say that you
have done some translation on the side. If you have received positive
feedback on the work you have done so far, by all means continue if you
wish.

But certainly be cautious that you do not overextend yourself.

If non-agency customers come back, chances are you did a good job the first
time. If an agency comes back, it might mean you did a good job, or it might
just mean your price is low enough to fit your budget.
