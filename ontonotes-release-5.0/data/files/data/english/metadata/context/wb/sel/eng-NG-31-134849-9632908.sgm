Anyone ever have this? I was given a 360 system by a friend who just
went out a purchased a new one when this one acted up (must be nice!).
The system will play DVD's, CD's and Demo's but it will not play the
full version games. There are no red rings of light nor any other
configuration of light other than the normal light when a controller
is activated. I am stumped. Please give input. Thank you.

Things that could cause this problem:

1. Your game discs are scratched
2. There is an internal error with the Xbox (hardware).
3. The data on the game discs are corrupted
4. Your friend modded the Xbox

Possible Fixes:

1. Try to clean off discs
2. Check the disc for a ring on or near the edge (its dead if it has
one).
2. Call suport: 1-800-4MY-XBOX
3. Try a disc from that friend
4. Yell at your firend for giving you a crappy 360 (Just kidding).
5. Post here with more detail, like what happens when you try to play
it.
