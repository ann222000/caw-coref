Strange tire problem

My Mazda 1997 LX626 has its original tires:

Firestone P195/65R14 88S

The spare isn't full size. The car is little used - it has less than
16,000 miles on it. I keep plastic valve stem caps screwed onto my valve
stems.

I took a trip around 3 years ago, about 700 miles round trip, and an odd
thing happened. I'd checked all the tires before the trip and made sure
the pressure was OK. I wasn't aware of any kind of problems with any of
the tires. A day or two AFTER the trip, I noticed that the right rear
tire had gone almost flat. I pumped up the tire and kept an eye on it
but it stayed fully inflated and never seemed to be a problem until
about a week ago, when I noticed it was completely flat. That's no
problems for 3 years, when it happened again! I pumped it up to 27.5 lb.
A couple of days later, I had to use the car and checked the pressure
and it was still 27.5 (I have a digital guage). I drove the car around
20 miles and the next morning, it was flat! I pumped it up and haven't
checked it since, but it looks full.

What should I do with this? I wouldn't trust it now. Most of the little
driving I do is on the highway, and it's obviously a dangerous
situation. The tread is still good on all 4 of the tires. Should I have
a tube put in that tire, have it reseated, have the valve checked
replaced or something else, or should I get a new tire or a full set of
new tires? If the last, I guess I'd get Michelin's at Costco.

I saw a news story a few weeks ago where they said that tire
manufacturers are going to start recommending replacing tires after 7
years regardless of signs of wear. There have been some accidents and
they think that tires can't be considered safe no matter what they look
like if they are over 7 years old. Is this partly hype or should I just
bite the bullet and buy all new tires?

Thanks for the information.

You may have a bead leak or just have a nail in the tire, sometimes they
don't leak unless you put pressure on that particular spot; like when you
park it over night and the leak is on the bottom side of the tire, then it
will leak, other wise under normal conditions it wouldn't.

I would take it to a tire shop and have them first look for a foreign object
in the tread and if they find none remove the tire clean the rim and replace
the valve stem and then reseat the tire.  This should take care of the
problem.

Absolutely true that tires deteriorate whether or not the car is
driven.  The more ozone in the air...i.e. the higher your
altitude...the faster they rot. Seven years may therefore be optimistic
if you live in SLC or Denver. Furthermore:  Tires and wheels (the metal
part) can leak air no matter what.  Also,  the act of checking air
pressure can permit a speck of rubber or dust to partially block the
tire's Schrader valve ...leading to a one-time over night flat.

Dan:

Your rim may have been deformed slightly, this can even happen if you
park the car too close to a pavement and the tire presses on it for a
while. Not as common as tire punctures or valve leaks, but can happen.
Don't know if tire shops can straigthen rims out though...

Nikolas

Advices given are all worthy.  And since we aren't likely to fix it
ourselves, let a competent tire tech diagnose and FIX the problem.  Even
$20, at one's convenience and time of one's choosing, beats the heck out of
changing a flat in this awful heat we've had recently.  Plus, look at all
that peace of mind!  s

That's exactly what I did. The manager told me they didn't find a
puncture, nail or tack. I don't know if they reseated the tire. The
manager said it was a leaky valve. I asked him if they replaced the
valve and he said "yes." His manner was less than convincing - I don't
know exactly WHAT they did. I was watching the guy work most of the time
and I could see that the tire was wet, so they at least submerged it.

Inasmuch as the problem had a way of disappearing for long stretches, I
may never be confident that it's resolved even if the tire holds its air
for years. After all, it was three years between the first and second
occurrence! I just checked the mini-spare and made sure it's OK. Hope I
don't have to swap it in somewhere/someday.

How can you be sure the min-spare will still be inflated if it turns out
that that your original problem isn't fixed?  I suggest checking the
mini-spare's pressure every day.  Maybe more than once a day.

Seriously, you might try taking your car to somebody you trust, or who
others recomment as competent and trustworthy.  And stop worrying.  It's not
good for you.

You're right on all counts. I put my foot pump in the car in case of the
eventuality I find myself out somewhere and the tire goes flat. Then, if
the mini-spare has less than OK pressure, I can pump it up. It'll take
100-200 strokes on that pump, but it beats the alternative. I let my AAA
membership expire a year or two ago.

Thing is, I often don't use the car for 2 weeks or more at a time. If
that tire loses pressure I will seek help elsewhere. The only guy I
trust (the mechanic I usually go to) suggested bringing the car across
the street to the Big-O I went to and asking for "Tony." I did that, but
it was Tony's day off. I'm not too worried about it, not enough to
affect my health. I have lots of other things that worry more than that,
to be truthful. Even so, my general health is excellent - I just had a
physical and my doctor told me so!
