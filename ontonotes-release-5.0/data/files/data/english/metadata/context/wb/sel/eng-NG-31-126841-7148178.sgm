160,000 of us signed the petition to stop escalation in Iraq since it
launched 18 hours ago, and we're picking up allies. Today Senator Ted
Kennedy will announce new legislation that would stop escalation.1 The
senator's message is simple:

"We cannot simply speak out against an escalation of troops in Iraq. We
must act to prevent it."

It is critical that we get as many signatures on the petition opposing
escalation as possible. We're delivering comments every few hours so
Congress gets the message. Can you forward the link below to your
friends and ask them to sign?

This may be the most important moment for speaking out against the war
since it began. We can stop escalation if enough of us speak out-but
it's going to take millions of us speaking together. Please take a
second to forward this email to your friends, family,
colleagues-anybody who might be interested.

Senator Kennedy goes farther than anybody else to date-we need to
push senators to join him. His legislation is simple and would stop the
escalation. It reads,

Section 1. Prohibition on use of funds for escalation of United States
forces in Iraq. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal
funds may be obligated or expended by the United States Government to
increase the number of United States forces in Iraq above the number
for such forces which existed as of January 9, 2007, without a specific
authorization of Congress by law for such an increase.
This means that unless the Congress votes to approve an escalation it
would be illegal to move forward with it. Congress probably won't vote
to authorize an escalation. But it is an open question as to whether or
not they will stop one.

Some Republicans are already opposing escalation. Senators Gordon Smith
(OR), Susan Collins (ME), Chuck Hagel (NE) and Richard Lugar (IN) among
others have all expressed reservations. But we need to force them to
put their votes where their mouth is.

Please forward this email to your friends and family and ask them to
sign our petition urging Congress to stop Bush's escalation in Iraq.

This Kennedy resolution would not take a dime away from the troops for
equipment or other needs. We all love and support our men and women in
uniform. What this is about is tying Bush's hands so he can't take us
deeper into the quagmire.

Stopping escalation is an important part of a strategy to getting out
of Iraq. "Stay the Course" was rejected by the voters. If escalation is
repudiated that leaves only one option: a responsible exit.

The next phase of this campaign will take our efforts to the doorsteps
of congressional offices across the country. Stay tuned for more.

Thanks for all you do.
