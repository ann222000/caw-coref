Harrowing Genocide in Chittagong Hill Tracts

The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) occupies a physical area of 5.093 sq.
miles (13,295 sq.km), constituting ten per cent of the total land area
of Bangladesh. The region comprises three districts: Rangamati,
Khagrachari, and Banderban. The districts comprise seven main valleys
formed by the Feni, Karnafuli, Chengi, Myani, Kassalong, Sangu and
Matamuhuri rivers aid their tributaries and numerous hills, ravines and
cliffs covered with dense vegetation, which are in complete contrast to
most other districts of Bangladesh, which consist mainly of alluvial
lands. Geographically the CHT can be divided into two broad ecological
zones: (a) hill valley, (b) agricultural plains. It is surrounded by
the Indian states of Tripura on the north and Mizoram on the east,
Myanmar on the south and east and Chittagong district on the west.

The land and water of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The CHT is south
eastern part of the Himalayas, thus in stark contrast with mainland
Bangladesh mountainous. In 1962 the Pakistan Government built a Dam at
Kaptai, which inundated 45% of the fertile land of the CHT. Rangamati,
the capital of the CHT is surrounded with water and mountains.

The Chittagong Hill Tracts (hereafter CHT), an area of 13,295 square
kilometers, is the south eastern part of Bangladesh, bordering the
Arakan and Chin States of Burma, and Tripura and Mizoram States of
India. From the time immemorial the CHT have been the home of thirteen
indigenous ethnic groups. They collectively identify themselves as the
Jumma people, the first peoples of the CHT. They are Chakma, Marma,
Tripura, Tanchangya, Mro, Murung, Lushai, Khumi, Chak, Khyang, Bawm,
Pankhua, and Reang. The Jumma people are distinct and different from
the majority Bengali population of Bangladesh in respect of race,
language, culture, religion and ethnicity.
1. British Period(1787-1947):
Similar to other indigenous peoples of the world, the Jumma people were
also independent before the British colonial period. The British
annexed the CHT area in 1860 and created an autonomous administrative
district known as &quot;The Chittagong Hill Tracts&quot; within the undivided
British Bengal. In 1900, the British enacted the Regulation 1 of the
1900 Act in order to protect the Jumma people from economic
exploitation of non indigenous people and to preserve their traditional
sociocultural and political institutions based on customary laws,
common ownership of land and so on. Throughout the British colonial
period the 1900 Act functioned as a safeguard for the Jumma people,
prohibited land ownership and migrations of non indigenous peoples in
the CHT. In 1947, Indian subcontinent was partitioned on the basis of
religion, Pakistan for Muslims and secular India for non Muslims and
Muslims alike. Despite 98.5% of the population of the CHT were Jummas
and thus non Muslims, the Pakistani leadership conspired and the
Boundary Commission of Great Britain ceded the CHT to East Pakistan
(now Bangladesh) in violation of the principles of partition and
against the wishes of the Jumma people. The Jummas vehemently protested
against the decision, but to no avail. On 15 August, 1947 the Chakma
youths under the leadership of Sneha Kumar Chakma hoisted tricolor
Indian fag at Rangamati, capital of the CHT and in the southern CHT at
Bandarban the Marmas who have cultural similarity with Burma hoisted
Burmese fag. Six days later the Indian flag at Rangamati was lowered by
the Pakistani Army at gun point
2. Pakistan Period(1947-1971):
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the very outset the Pakistani Government looked at the Jummas with

"/>

an eye of suspicion for being anti Pakistani during the partition.
Jummas were discriminated in jobs, business and education. During the
Pakistani rule, the Government of Pakistan amended the 1900 Act several
times against the wishes of the Jumma people in order to find a legal
excuse for migration of non indigenous people into the CHT. It
deliberately ignored the fact that the 1900 Act was an indispensable
legal instrument for ensuring the safeguard of the Jummas, and that it
could not be amended without mutual agreement. On contrary, Pakistani
Government interpreted the 1900 Act as a legacy of British colonial
administration which helped separating the CHT from the rest of the
country. The predicament of the Jumma people began with the building of
a hydroelectric dam in the early sixties which flooded 1,036 Square
Kilometers of land, submerged 40% of the best arable land and displaced
100,000 Jummas from their ancestral homes.
3. Bangladesh Period(1971- Present):
After nine months of war of independence with Pakistan, Bangladesh
emerged as an independent state on 16 December 1971. During the war of
independence it was alleged that the Jummas in general remained
indifferent to the cause of war against Pakistan. Soon after the
Pakistani army withdrew, the Mukti Bahini (liberation forces of
Bangladesh) went on rampage against the Jummas in the CHT. On 15
February 1972, a delegation of the Jumma people led by M.N. Larma,
called on Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and submitted a written
memorandum with four point charter of demands consisting of 1) Autonomy
for the CHT, 2) Retention of the CHT Regulation 1900, 3) Recognition of
the three kings of the Jummas, 4) Ban on the influx of the non Jummas
into the CHT. Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman categorically
rejected these demands. In March 1972, M.N. Larma formed Jana Samhati
Samiti (JSS), later a military wing the Shanti Bahini was added to it.

4. Arrests, Tortures and Kidnapping:
In the name of counter-insurgency the Jummas have often been detained
and tortured by the army. Thousands have perished in the armed
encounters, extra-judicial executions, tortures, rapes and so on.
Bangladesh security forces often resorted to mass detention and torture
of the helpless villagers and left many of them crippled for life. For
further consolidating their authority over the villagers, security
forces have uprooted villages and forcibly kept them in so called
&quot;cluster villages&quot; (known as concentration camps), where they live
under constant supervision of the military.
5. Bangladeshi Settlers:
In the late 1970s President Zia sponsored migration of Bangladeshi
settlers into the CHT, providing land grants, cash and rations. This
programme was not made public at the time, and its existence was denied
by the representative of the government. Now the government
acknowledges that there was a programme of sponsored migration.
Bangladeshi settlers, with the connivance of the almost totally Bengali
administration, have been able to take over land and even whole
villages from the Jummas. By 1981 the Bangladeshis made up nearly one
third of the total population of the CHT.
6. Forcible Conversion and Religious Persecution:
Forcible conversion is considered as a state sponsored method of
assimilation. Al-Rabita, a Saudi government funded NGO, is the main
Islamic missionary organisation active in the region, backed by the
military, it is entrusted with the Islamisation of the region. The
Jammat-i-Islam, an Islamic fundamentalist party works actively with the
military in the CHT. The number of mosques and madrashas(Islamic
schools) are rapidly increasing in the area. Apart from
proselytisation, there have been religious persecution in the form of
violation and destruction of religious places of the Jummas by the
Bangladesh military. In 1986, within a period of eight months 54
Buddhist temples have been destroyed and 22 Hindu temples were burnt
down by the Bangladesh military.
7. Massacres:
Since 1980 there have been 13 major instances of massacre of the Jummas
by the Bangladeshi settlers and the Bangladeshi security personnel.
These are:
1. Kaukhali-Kalampati Massacre, 25 March 1980 - Bangladesh Army and the
Bangladeshi settlers gunned down 300 Jummas.
2. Banraibari-Beltali-Belchari Massacre, 26 June 1981: - Bangladeshi
settlers under the protection of the Bangladesh Army, murdered hundreds
of Jummas.
3. Telafang-Ashalong-Tabalchari Massacre, 19 September 1981: - The
Bangladesh Army and the settlers invaded the Jumma villages of Feni
valley and murdered hundreds of Jummas.
4. Golakpatimachara-Machyachara-Tarabanchari Massacre, June-August
1983: - The Bangladesh Army and the settlers executed months long
campaign against the Jumma villages and murdered 800 Jummas.
5. Bhusanchara Massacre, 31 May 1984 - the massacre was carried out
jointly by the 26 Bengal Regiment of the Bangladesh Army and the
Bangladeshi settlers. At least 400 Jummas were killed. Many women were
gang raped and later shot dead.
6. Panchari Massacre, 1 May 1986 - hundreds of Jummas (actual number
not known) were killed and injured by the Bangladesh Army. 80,000
Jummas fled across the border to India.
7. Matiranga Massacre, May 1986 - The Bangladesh Army gunned down at
least 70 Jumma civilians in reprisal to fighting with the Shanti
Bahini.
8. Comillatilla, Taindong Massacre, 18-19 May 1986 -the Bangladesh
Rifles (a paramilitary force) intercepted 200 Jummas while fleeing
across the border to India and opened fired on them.
9. Hirarchar, Sarbotali, Khagrachari, Pablakhali Massacres, 8,9,10
August, 1988 - The Bangladesh Army along with the Bangladeshi settlers
killed hundreds of Jumma civilians and gang raped Jumma women.
10. Langadu Massacre, 4 May 1989 - the Bangladeshi settlers murdered 40
Jummas, dead bodies never recovered.
11. Malya Massacre, 2 February 1992 - the Bangladeshi settlers murdered
another 30 Jummas.
12. Logang Massacre, 10 April 1992 - 400 Jummas killed by the
Bangladeshi military and the Bangladeshi settlers.
13. Naniachar Massacre, 17 November 1993 - about 100 Jummas killed by
the Bangladeshi settlers.

8. The CHT Treaty:
The Jana Samhati Samiti (JSS), the political platform of the Jumma
people signed a treaty with the Bangladesh government on 2 December,
1997. The treaty failed to safeguard the survival of the Jumma people.
The Bangladesh government did not have the sincere desire to solve the
problem of the CHT. The treaty had rather been used by the Bangladesh
government as a facade to impress the donor countries. The treaty does
not address the fundamental problem of the Bangladeshi settlers and the
militarisation of the CHT, it rather legalizes the settlers in the CHT.

The Bangladeshi Settlers (also known as BMI for Bangladeshi Muslim
Infiltrators by the Jana Samhati Samiti publications) are land less
Bengali speaking Muslims from the plain land districts of Bangladesh,
majority are from Chittagong, Noakhali, Comilla, Sylhet districts. The
Bangladesh Government and the Military lured the poor Bangladeshi
families with money and promise of empty land in the Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT). The real motive was to outnumber the Jummas in the CHT
and evict them from their traditional land.

1. ABOLITION OF CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS ACT 1900
The abolition of special status in 1964 opened up the Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT) to outsiders. Bengali Muslim families started settling
there in numbers large enough to alarm the Jummas, who felt that it was
official government policy to outnumber them on their own land. Grounds
for this fear could be seen in the industries like Kaptai hydroelectric
power station, Chandraghona paper mill whose founding in the CHT
coincided with the influx of Bengali Muslims who were given
preferential employment.
2. SECRET MEETING
Eight years after the independence of Bangladesh, President Ziaur
Rahman presided at a secret, mid 1979 meeting during which it was
decided to settle 30,000 Bangladeshi families during the following
year. The importance of the meeting was emphasized by the attendance of
Deputy Prime Minister Jamaluddin, Home Minister Mustafizur Rahman, the
commissioner of the Chittagong division and the deputy commissioner of
the CHT. A sum of Taka 60 million was allocated to the scheme, but the
budget heading under which this state money was provided was not
disclosed. As a result of the meeting, implementation committees, made
up of government officers and leading Bangladeshi settlers, were formed
at district and sub divisional levels. The district commissioner headed
the district committee and sub divisional officers the sub divisional
committees. The committees appointed agents from among the Bangladeshi
settlers and assigned them to contact land less Bangladeshis willing to
settle in the CHT. These were not hard to find and from February 1980
truckloads of poor Bangladeshi families poured into the CHT attracted
by the government scheme to provide five acres of land, Taka 3,600 to
each new settler family. According to USAID in July 1980, the
government decided to resettle 100,000 Bangladeshis from the plains in
the CHT in the first phase of this scheme.
3. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED MIGRATION
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the government's viewpoint the settlement plan was successful from

"/>

the start. By 1980 the Feni valley which borders on Tripura contained
about 18,000 Bangladeshi families and roughly 1,500 Jumma families.
There are now even fewer Jumma people left and those who remain are
eager to leave. Myani valley in the northern part of the CHT contains
40,000 indigenous people and about 10,000 Bangladeshis, a large number
of whom arrived in the valley in 1980. In Chengi valley the Bangladeshi
settlements received 1,500 families between 1978 and 1980. By the same
date there were 1,000 Bangladeshi families at Kaptai and 5,000 families
in Rangamati sub-division of which 3,500 families alone settled at
Kalampati. In the southern part of the CHT, the Lama &lt;i&gt;thana&lt;/i&gt; had
about 3,000 Bangladeshi families and even more were settled at
Nakyangchari. In Rangamati town, in 1980, the Jummas were accounted for
about 30 per cent of the population. The Bangladesh Government
initially denied its settlement program, however in May 1980 the
government confirmed its policy towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts and
started actively to encourage settlers to move there. A secret
memorandum from the commissioner of the Chittagong Division to
government officials in other districts stated that it was &quot;the desire
of the government that the concerned deputy commissioners will give top
priority to this work and make the program a success&quot;. During 1980 some
25,000 Bangladeshi families were settled in the CHT. At the same time
thousands of Jumma families, dispossessed by the Kaptai dam project in
the early 1960s, were still attempting to get some kind of monetary or
land compensation. Under the second phase of the plan each land less
settler family received five acres of hill land or four acres of mixed
land or 2.5 acres of wet rice land. They also received two initial
grants of Taka 700 altogether, followed by Taka 200 per month for five
months and 24 lb. of wheat per week for six months. In July 1982 a
third phase of Bangladeshi settlement was authorized under which a
further 250,000 Bangladeshis were transferred to the area.
4. DISPOSSESSION OF JUMMA LAND
The Bangladeshi settlers, with the connivance of the almost totally
Bangladeshi administration, have been able to take over land and even
whole villages. There is a severe population pressure on land in
Bangladesh generally and Jumma land had been regarded as readily
available. One excuse often given for allowing or encouraging this
immigration is the relatively low population density in the CHT. The
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) had noted
that &quot;the Chittagong Hill Tracts are relatively less crowded than the
plains of Bangladesh. Because of this difference in population
densities, there has for some time been a migration from the crowded
plains to the hills&quot;. In 1967, a study commissioned by Dhaka, however
concluded that &quot;as far as its developed resources are concerned, the
hill tracts is as constrained as the most thickly populated district...
The emptiness of the hill tracts, therefore is a myth&quot;. Only 5 per cent
of land outside forest reserves is suitable for intensive field
cropping. In spite of the shortage of farming land in the tracts, the
government has succeeded in attracting many thousands of land less
Bangladeshis. To be land less in Bangladesh is to be absolutely poor
and dependent. Jobs are seasonal, insecure, and pay is enough for
subsistence only. An agricultural labourer receives about five Takas a
day when he is working and is usually unemployed for about six months
of the year. For the overwhelming majority of Bangladesh's rural
population there is little hope to escape from constant poverty. The
settlement plans offer an opportunity which no land less or poor
Bangladeshi family can ignore. The land however unarable, and the money
and food grants, however depleted by corrupt officials, can mean
survival for six months or more for poor Bangladeshi peasants. The
Bangladeshi peasants who move to the Chittagong Hill Tracts come
principally from the plains districts of Chittagong, Noakhali, Sylhet
and Comilla, and have no experience of hill slope cultivation. When
they find they cannot make a living from the land they have been given
they encroach on Jumma owned land. There were various ways in which the
Jumma people have been, and still are being dispossessed of their
lands. In many cases, Bangladeshi settlers move into an area and
gradually encroach on the lands of their Jumma neighbours. A Chakma
refugee from Panchari describes the initial process as follows:
&quot; In 1980-81 the Bengalis moved in. The government gave them rations of
rice etc. and sponsored them. The settlers moved into the hills, then
they moved the Jummas by force with the help of the Bangladesh Army.
The Deputy Commissioner would come over and say that this place was
suitable for settlers so Jumma people must move and would receive money
in compensation. But in reality they did not get money or resettlement.
In 1980 the Jumma people had to move by order of the government&quot;.
Attacks on Jumma peoples' villages are the most common way to evict the
inhabitants from their lands. A Tripura refugee in India from Bakmara
Taindong Para near Matiranga described what happened to his village in
1981 when the settlers moved into his village:
&quot;Muslims from different parts of Bangladesh were brought in by
Bangladeshi authorities. Before that our village was populated only by
Chakma, Tripura and Marma. With the assistance of the government these
settlers were rehabilitated in our village and they continued to give
us troubles..they finger at the Jummas and the army beats them and rob.
They took all the food grain. Whenever we seek any justice from the
army we don't get it. All villagers lived under great tension due to
various incidents all around. Three days after an incident when six
persons had been killed, just before getting dark, many settlers came
to our village, shouting 'Allah Akbar' (Allah is Great). When they
arrived we escaped so the settlers got the opportunity to set fire&quot;.
A Chakma refugee in Tripura told what happened to his village in 1986:
&quot;I lost my land. Settlers came and captured my land. They burnt our
houses first. They came with soldiers. This took place on 1st May 1986
at Kalanal, Panchari. My house was in a village with a temple. The
whole village of 60 houses was burnt. After seeing this we ran through
the jungles and eventually reached India, coming to Karbook camp.&quot;
The following interview refers to events which took place on 21
November 1990:
&quot;Muslim settlers wanted to take us villagers to a cluster village
(concentration camp), but we refused to go there. The villagers were
beaten up by the Muslim settlers of which three families managed to
escape, one of which is mine. These three families came to
Kheddarachara for 'jhum' cultivation. We stayed there for one and a
half years. The day before yesterday the Muslim settlers came to the
same village and rounded up the households. The settlers were
accompanied by Bangladeshi soldiers. I took shelter in a nearby latrine
when the villagers were rounded up. Later I tried to leave the latrine
to go somewhere else. The village had been surrounded. As I was trying
to escape, the Muslim settlers shot me. It was a singled barreled shot
gun. The incident took place in the early morning around 6 o'clock.
After getting the bullet injury I ran away into a safe place. I don't
know what happened to the other villagers. I ran away from the place
for about half a mile. Then I fainted and lost consciousness. Two
refugees went there to collect indigenous vegetables and brought me to
the camp about 10 o'clock. I have been twice attacked to be taken to a
cluster village, the second time I was shot.&quot;
Violence, intimidation and arson are the main methods used by the both
the Bangladesh Army and the Bangladeshi settlers to force the hill
people to leave their villages. Entire villages have been forced to
flee from their lands.
5. SETTLEMENT IS A POLITICAL ACT
Landlessness is on the increase in Bangladesh in general. Land
ownership has become increasingly concentrated and now 10 per cent of
the population owns 50 per cent of available land. There has been no
will on the part of any Bangladeshi government to assist land less
labourers or marginal farmers anywhere in the country. Indeed
organizations of land less people are often put down with the utmost
brutality by hoodlums hired by local landlords, the police, the army,
or by all three. The government's power rests with the middle and upper
classes in the urban areas and with rich farmers. The Bangladeshi poor
will seize any survival chance they are presented with. Illiterates
have limited horizons and they are not fully aware that the
government's scheme to settle them in the CHT is not essentially an
attempt to improve their lot. It is a political act to nullify the
question of Jumma peoples' rights of self determination by increasing
the number of Bangladeshis in the CHT to majority.
6. SETTLERS USED AS CANNON FODDER
The Pakistani government instituted a settlement plan in the Feni
valley bordering India because it distrusted the Jumma people living
there. Bangladeshi governments have similarly used poor Bangladeshis
against the Jumma people as cannon fodder. There seems to be a
determination to destroy Jumma society and if necessary the Jumma
people. Illiterate Bangladeshi peasants who, under this scheme move to
the CHT, know nothing of the Jumma situation. All they know is that the
government has given them land and is prepared to assist or at least to
turn blind eye to encroachment on Jumma land.
7. GOVERNMENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT
The government argument is that settlement in the CHT is necessary
because much of the land there is uncultivated and therefore in their
view wasted. Furthermore Dhaka maintains that &quot;it would be against the
constitution to prevent any Bangladeshi from settling or buying land in
any part of the country&quot;. This argument takes little account of the
economic or political realities of the CHT, where little of the land is
suitable for farming and where the traditional owners are coerced into
giving up their property. As an example India could have used the same
argument in the Muslim majority state of Kashmir, where most of the
land like the CHT is empty. By settling people from overcrowded part of
the country to Kashmir India could have altered the demographic profile
of Kashmir from Muslim majority to Hindu majority state. But Indian
constitution forbids settlement in areas like Kashmir, Arunachal
Pradesh, Mizoram etc, because of their distinct cultural, religious and
ethnic background.
8. WIDER POLITICAL OBJECTIVE
A direct result of the settlement scheme works to wider political
advantage of Dhaka. The conflict between the poor Bangladeshis and the
Jumma people for a tiny proportion of the total land distracts
attention from the general situation of landlessness in Bangladesh. In
the CHT, this struggle has polarized the Bangladeshis and the Jumma
people. The Bangladeshi settlers, in collaboration with the Bangladesh
Army and Police harass the Jumma people. Civil suits taken out by Jumma
people have increased substantially but, since the judiciary is manned
mainly by the Bengali Muslim officials, they have been unsuccessful.
Resulting from this, Jumma families have been forced to leave their
homesteads and become land less.
This Chakma man was shot on the left thigh by the Bangladesh Army in
May of 1986. He and his family were heading to the Indian border to
escape attacks from the Bangladeshi security forces. They were
intercepted by the Bangladesh Army and shot at. This man together with
his family took refuge in Tripura of India.
There have been massive and systematic human rights violations in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), committed by the Bangladeshi security
forces and the Bangladeshi settlers. The Jumma people have been
murdered, crippled, raped, tortured, imprisoned and deprived of their
homes and means of livelihood. They have been denied civil and
political rights.
Netherlands based Organizing Committee for CHT Campaign reported 278
cases of Human Rights violations committed between July 1985 to
December 1985. The human rights abuses include murders, torture, rape,
arson, robbery, abduction, forcible conversion to Islam and electoral
fraud. The policy of the Bangladesh government had been to destroy the
local inhabitants in order to settle its Muslim co-religionist in their
place. Torture of the CHT people is carried out by the Bangladesh armed
forces everyday. It is so brutal and severe that many of the victims
are crippled and most of them die prematurely. Most commonly, the
Bangladesh military or paramilitary personnel enter Jumma villages in
the early hours of the morning and take away a small number of
able-bodied young men of the village or occasionally the village
headman, to their camps. The arrests are undertaken without using any
legal procedure such as the presentation of arrest warrants or bringing
the arrested person before a magistrate within 24 hours, as the
Criminal Procedure Code specifies for arrests by police officers. The
Chittagong Hill Tracts had never been officially declared a &quot;disturbed
area&quot; so that the provisions of the Disturbed Areas (Special Powers)
Ordinance, 1962 - the 1980 Disturbed Areas Bill never had been enacted
- had not been invoked. As a result no legal procedures were in force
specifically providing for civilians to be arrested by military or
paramilitary forces.
1. Military Induced Terror
Jumma villagers detained for questioning by the Bangladesh military and
paramilitary personnel are regularly tortured. Such prisoners are
generally kept in pits or trenches some seven or eight feet deep, dug
within the perimeter of the army or BDR (Bangladesh Rifles) camps;
Jumma villagers have often been compelled to dig these pits in the
first instance. One of the two sides of the pit or trench is protected
by a fence of bamboo stakes. Prisoners are held in groups of up to 15
or 20 at one time in these conditions. Several former prisoners said
that soldiers sprinkled hot water over the pit or trench to increase
their discomfort almost daily. Prisoners are then taken out singly from
the pit for interrogation. The techniques of torture which former
prisoners reported to be most frequently used during interrogation are:
extensive beating, with rifle butts and sticks, on all parts of the
body; pouring very hot water into the nostrils and mouth; hanging the
prisoner upside down, often from a tree, for long periods and poking
him with a bayonet or stick; hanging the prisoner by the shoulders for
long periods and then beating the soles of the feet; and burning with
cigarettes. Over the years, many Jumma villagers died in custody as a
result of the treatment they received. A middle-aged teacher from
Laogang village, in the Panchari area, described his experiences to the
Amnesty International thus:
&quot;In the first week of December (1985) the army came to my village and
said that it was looking for those who train and support Shanti Bahini
boys. When they failed to find anyone they caught hold of me and took
me trussed up and blindfolded to an army camp where I found that
several Chakmas were already present. Immediately the troops and the
officer in charge began to beat us up asking for the whereabouts of the
Shanti Bahini people. Since we did not know anything we could give them
no information. The soldiers then took us to a part of the army camp
where a huge deep pit was already present. All the while they were
kicking and abusing, spitting at us and shoving with rifle butts. We
were all thrown into the pit and for several days soldiers came and
threw boiling water at us whenever they felt like having a little fun
because whenever that happened all of us tried to get under each other
for cover. We were often dragged out individually and subjected to
third degree treatment. Boiling water was poured into our nostrils and
mouth. For several hours we were hung from the trees upside down and
beaten with sticks. Once I was hung from the trees by my shoulders and
beaten with cane on the bare soles of my feet. We were given food not
more than once a day and were constantly threatened that we would not
be allowed to go out alive. All this while I had no contact with my
family. It is ridiculous even to suggest that I could have contacted a
lawyer and tried for bail. I still have scars of burns from boiling
water over my body.&quot;
This interview was conducted six months after the teacher's detention.
Faint scars on his body were visible to the naked eye but could not be
successfully photographed. Other accounts of treatment in army or BDR
camps by villagers from other places are markedly consistent with the
above account, as is illustrated by the experience of a villager from
Rangapani, also in the Panchari area:
&quot;I was arrested by the army who said that I knew about the activities
of the Shanti Bahini boys, which was incorrect but they took me away to
a military camp near Khagrachari where I was detained along with
several other Chakmas in a deep pit. As a routine of almost every day
soldiers came and sprinkled boiling water on the pit. We were given
nothing to eat but watery dal (a lentil dish) and pasty rice. They took
each one of us out individually for torture and questioning. Usually
the torture meant severe beating with cane, rifle butts and hanging the
man upside down from a tree which made it easy for the soldiers to pour
boiling water into his nostrils and mouth. This was done to me three
times. Also one afternoon the officer came and poked various parts of
my body with a cigarette. I still bear the burn marks on my right
cheek&quot;.
&quot;When they were unable to get anything out of me, they threatened me
with electric shock. I was taken to a room where they had kept a bucket
of water in which they had dipped two live wires tied to a razor blade.
They stripped me and asked me to urinate in the bucket. They kept on
beating me up but even though I tried I wasn't able to do it because of
fear. They beat me up till I fell unconscious and threw me back in the
pit. All the while we had no way of contacting a lawyer or court. My
family had no way of contacting me as well, but they were able to
contact (a member of the Panchari Union Parishad - council) who was
able to secure my release.&quot;
Several former Jumma prisoners had also been threatened with the
electric shock treatment. Another villager from the panchari area
described the experience of his 27-year-old son during December 1985,
when his son had been held for 23 days in Khagrachari cantonment:
&quot;The torture basically was army men throwing hot water into their
nostrils and mouth and mercilessly beating. When the army got no
information from my son in spite of this, he was subjected to electric
shock in the cantonment. The shocks were administered with as crude a
device as two naked electric wires which the soldiers touched to
different parts of the detainee's body, particularly on the tongue and
spinal cord. Hy son was released after I pleaded with the Union Council
which intervened.&quot;
This villager also stated that one of the people held with his son,
Santoshmani Chakma, died as a result of torture. Mass tortures were
also meted out to the Jumma villagers during searches for the Shanti
Bahini guerillas and supporters, they are rounded up from their homes
and a few of them, often the young men, are picked out and tortured in
front of the assembled villagers. The methods of torture cited are the
same as those reported to be used regularly on prisoners held in army
or BDR camps. One such incident occurred at Monatek village, Mohalchari
on 19 september 1984. Police personnel from the Armed Police Battalion
(APB) based at Mohalchari are reported to have rounded up the villagers
at around 10 pm on open ground near the village. Four men were then
said to have been selected from among the assembled group and in front
of all the others they were reportedly hung upside down, beaten and had
water poured in their nostrils and mouth.
2. Concentration Camps
Torture also used when coercing the Jumma villagers to move from their
homes into collective farms, or &quot;cluster villages&quot;. The policy of
establishing what were essentially collective farms began in 1964, to
encourage tribal people to settle on permanent land plots rather than
continue jhum (slash and burn) cultivation. Since around 1977, however,
it appears that the settlements to which the Jumma people have been
moved bear greater resemblance to &quot;concentration camps&quot;, since army,
BDR or police camps are also established alongside them. The relocation
of the Jumma villagers has been presented by law enforcement personnel
as being in the villagers' best interests although the implementation
of this policy serve other purposes: through the close surveillance of
the Jumma villagers, assistance and shelter to the Shanti Bahini can be
prevented, while the land vacated by the Jumma villagers may then be
used for resettling Bangladeshi settlers from other parts of the
country. These &quot;cluster villages&quot; were established throughout the
Chittagong Hill Tracts. In early 1986, an effort to intensify the
formation of &quot;cluster villages&quot; in the northern parts of the Chittagong
Hill Tracts was begun by the law enforcement personnel of Bangladesh.
The area affected included villages in the
Mohalchari-Nanyarchari-Khagrachari locality. A member of the Marma
nationality described the experience of his village, Khularam Para,
near Mohalchari:
&quot;On 27 January (1986), about 50 armed men from Hajachara camp,
commanded by a captain, raided my village and ordered people to move to
a cluster village at Hobachari. The captain gave a speech and said that
for our own safety, development and for destroying the Shanti Bahini it
was necessary for us to move to larger villages. When we refused they
took aside about 20 of my villagers and tortured them in full public
view by burning them with cigarettes, beating them with rifle butts and
spitting on their faces....Later the village was burnt and everyone ran
helter skelter&quot;.
Similar abuses were taking place in the Nanyarchari area, according to
a villager from Dewan Chara:
&quot;Since the beginning of this year the army and police had been visiting
the villages in our area asking people to prepare to shift to a new
cluster village. They said it was necessary for us to shift for our
development and national security. But we all said no, because these
cluster villages are like concentration camps where we have to remain
constantly under the eye of the soldiers and where our women are not
safe.&quot;
&quot;In February, large-scale operations commenced in our region and on the
fifth of the month a group of soldiers raided our village. The
0fficer-in-charge abused us and the soldiers who were firing in the air
to scare us started to beat us up indiscriminately. After a while they
took out about 15 of us and marched us to the Buddha Vihar (Temple).
There we were tortured very badly for a long time. They poured hot
water into our mouths and nostrils and burned some of us with cigarette
butts. We were let off later in the evening when we promised to shift
to the new village.&quot;
3. Restrictions on Movement, Buying and Selling
The Bangladesh military divides the CHT into three different zones:
red, yellow and white. The red zones are the interior of the CHT, the
white zones are the areas within two miles of the regional military
headquarters where the army is in full control, while the yellow zones
are the Bangladeshi settler areas. The following restrictions broadly
cover the different zones: In the red zones the most restrictions are
imposed on the Jumma people but not on the Bangladeshis. All the Jumma
people have to carry an identity card and if they go shopping they have
to carry a market pass. The market pass which is headed 'Bangladesh is
in my heart&quot; is a means of controlling the quantities of rice,
kerosene, oil and other goods which they are allowed to buy. A family
cannot buy more than four kilos of rice per person each week. This is
checked at all the military posts along the road. People are asked
where they come from, where they are going to and their bags are
searched. If hill people want to sell some of their produce, such as
rice, they have first to seek written permission from the army. A
Chakma woman from Khagrachari District was arrested, tortured and
sexually harrassed by the Bangaldeshi security forces for buying
clothes in 1989.
&quot;I went to the market and bought some clothes. All of a sudden a
policeman came from behind and caught me. The police asked: 'Why did
you buy the clothes?' I said: 'To wear.' Then he took me to jail and
started beating me and giving me electric shocks. They kept me one and
a half days, tying my hands. Then they transferred me to Khagrachari
army camp. They tortured me at the army camp. The army soldiers
assaulted me by touching my breasts etc. After five days I was released
on the condition that I report there every month. The charge was that I
bought clothes for the Shanti Bahini.&quot;
One Jumma youth in Dighinala Upazilla told the CHT Commission that his
family wanted to sell rice so he could pay the fees for his studies.
When the permission came they were allowed to sell only one maund of
rice (about 40 kilos) which was not enough to pay for his studies.
There is also a restriction on the quantity of medicines that a person
may buy and in some places people need permission from the army before
buying any medicines. In the south, people need permission to take
goods from there to Bandarban. The reason behind these measures is the
army's fear that people will give food and other necessities to the
Shanti Bahini. In the yellow zones the Jumma people have to carry
identity cards, but no market passes are needed. There is however, in
these zones too, a restriction on how much medicine they are allowed to
buy. In the white zones there are no specific restrictions, but only
those which apply throughout the CHT as a whole. These include a
prohibition on all movement outside of towns after the closing hours of
the check posts and the need for written permission for long trips.
Chittipudi Chakma, 6 months, daughter of Manek Kumar Chakma was killed
by the Bangladeshi settlers on 2 February 1992 at Malya massacre. Two
bombs exploded on a passenger boat. The explosion killed a passenger
and seriously injured the driver of the boat. The survivors swam
ashore, but the armed Bangladeshi settlers were awaiting for them and
attacked the Jumma passengers - men, women and children. About 30
Jummas were killed.

Since 1980, the Bangladesh military and the Bangladeshi settlers had
committed 13 major massacres in the Chittgong Hill Tracts (hereafter
CHT). Even then massacres were not new in the CHT by then. During the
Bangladesh's liberation war against Pakistan, in 1971 the Mukti Bahini
(freedom fighters of Bangladesh) perpetrated 3 massacres against the
Jumma civilians in the CHT. But it was during the war against Shanti
Bahini (the armed resistance of the Jumma people), the Bangladesh Army
and the Bangladesh Government stepped up the frequency and intensity of
mass murders against innocent civilians. These massacres are executed
by systematic planning of the Bangladesh military, often in
collaboration with the Bangladeshi settlers to uproot and wipe out the
Jumma people from their land. These massacres include only the
incidents where large number of people are killed in a single day at a
single spot. Large number of People are also killed in military
operations of extensive periods in wide areas, those are included in
'Reprisal Attacks' of 'Genocide' section.

1. Kaukhali Massacre, 25/03/1980:
There have been numerous attacks on the Jumma people by the settlers
and the Bangladesh Army. But the massacre of Kaukhali Bazaar of
Kalampati on 25th March 1980 stands out, because it was the first
massacre in which indigenous people were killed in their hundreds. 300
Jummas were killed in this massacre and many more were injured.
On that they the Bangladesh military had asked the Jumma people to
gather in the bazaar on the pretext holding a meeting for the
reconstruction of a Buddhist Temple. Following the gathering the
military suddenly encircled the area and opened fired on the unarmed
Jumma civilians. The innocent Jumma people were completely caught by
surprise. The Bangladesh military beforehand had informed and armed the
Bangladeshi settlers for the massacres. The the Bangladeshi settlers
assisted the Bangladesh Army by axing the injured men, women, and
children, whom the military had hidden in the background for the
massacre. Buddhist temples and religious images had been destroyed by
the Bangladesh Army and the Bangladeshi settlers.
Thousands of Jummas took refuge in the Indian state of Tripura. Later
on they were repatriated on an agreement between the Tripura government
and the Bangladesh Army, and on the promise that things like that would
not happen again.A parliamentary investigation team was formed by then
Ziaur Rahman Government, but the report never saw the daylight. The
military officers who engineered the killings not only were never
punished, they were promoted in the ranks of the Bangladesh Army.
2. Banraibari-Beltali-Belchari Massacre, 26/06/1981:
The Bangladeshi settlers, under the protection of the Bangladesh army,
invaded the Jumma area in the vicinity of Banraibari, Beltali and
Belchari, murdered 500 Jumma men, women and children, and occupied
their villages and farmlands. Thousands of Jumma people fled to the
nearby forests and 5,000 of them managed to seek refuge in the Tripura
State of India

3. Telafang-Ashalong-Gurangapara-Tabalchari-Barnala
Massacre, 19/09/1981:
The Bangladesh army and the Bangladeshi settlers made co-ordinated
attacks on 35 Jumma villages including Telafang, Ashalong, Gurangapara,
Tabalchari, Barnala etc. in the Feni valley of the CHT, plundered and
burned the villages, and killed many thousand men, women and children.
Thousands of Jumma people died as a direct and indirect result of these
attacks.
The surviving villagers fled to the Indian State of Tripura and to the
adjacent forests. Although the Bangladeshi regime had denied that these
refugees were from the CHT, it was forced by the international
community to repatriate them. These Jumma people were met at the border
by hostile Bangladeshi officials and were given the equivalent of $18
and were left to their fate. Return to their native villages was
impossible because their homes and possessions had been appropriated by
the Bangladeshi settlers. Many of them died of starvation and of
diseases.

4. Golakpatimachara-Machyachara-Tarabanchari
Massacre, June-August 1983:
On 26 June, 11,26,27 July and 9,10,11 August 1983, the Bangladesh armed
forces and the Bangladeshi immigrants massacred the Jumma people of the
villages of Golakpatimachara, Machyachara, Tarabanchari, Logang,
Tarabanya, Maramachyachara, Jedamachyachara etc. Hundreds of houses
were looted and burned, and 800 people were murdered. Most of the
victims were old men, women and children. After clearing the area of
the Jumma people the government settled Bangladeshi families there.

5. Bhusanchara Massacre, 31/05/1984:
In the early morning of 31 May 1984, the Shanti Bahini guerillas
attacked the settlements of the Bangladeshi settlers at Gorosthan,
Bhusanchara and Chota Harina of Barkal Upazilla (Sub District). About
100 Bangladeshi settlers were reported killed, their homes burned down
in the attack. Three BDR (Bangladesh Rifles) camps in the locality were
also simultaneously attacked so that the BDR personnel could not
intervene. Bhusanchara was the village most severely affected. The
attack was given extensive coverage in the Bangladesh news media and
President Ershad visited the affected area on 5 June 1984. No publicity
was given, however, to the reprisals taken against the Jumma population
by the Bangladeshi security personnel immediately after the assaults on
the Bangladeshi settlements.
Some of the Jumma people, apparently anticipating retaliatory raids,
left their homes at once and sought to hide in the surrounding forests.
Others remained in their villages. Later on 31 May and the following
day, the Bangladesh Army personnel, from the 305th brigade of the 26th
Bengal Regiment, and members of the 17th battalion of the Bangladesh
Rifles, accompanied by the Bangladeshi settlers, attacked the Jumma
villages in the area, principally Het Baria, Suguri Para, Gorosthan,
Tarengya Ghat, Bhusanchara and Bhusan Bagh. A total of 400 Jumma people
including children and women were killed. Many women were gang raped
and later shot dead. Seven thousand Jummas crossed the border into the
Indian state of Mizoram.
A Jumma villager from Het Baria gave the following account of his
experience to the Amnesty International:
&quot;My village falls in the Barkal rehabilitation zone where large number
of Muslims have settled over the years. There is thus continuous
tension between the two communities. In the summer of 1984 there were
frequent clashes and the Muslims often used to threaten us saying that
the army will come and teach us a lesson. The army came on May 31,
accompanied by a large group of Muslims some of whom were armed. They
destroyed our village, raped women and killed people. I saw two women
getting raped and then killed by bayonets. One Aroti, who is my distant
cousin, was also raped by several soldiers and her body was disfigured
with bayonets. Several people, including children, were thrown into
burning huts. I was among the people singled out for torture in public.
Five or six of us were hung upside down on a tree and beaten. Perhaps I
was given up for dead and thus survived. The memories of that day are
still a nightmare for me. Even now I sometimes wake up in a cold sweat
remembering the sight of the soldiers thrusting bayonets into private
parts of our women. They were all screaming 'No Chakmas will be born in
Bangladesh&quot;.

6. Panchari Massacre, 1/05/1986:
On April 29th, 1986, the Shanti Bahini (resistance of the Jummas)
simultaneously attacked the BDR border outposts at Assalong, Chota
Assalong and Taidong of Khagrachari District and followed it up with
swoops on new settlements of the Bangladeshi settlers. Reprisals by the
Bangladesh army, BDR, Ansars (Islamic Guard) and the Bangladeshi
settlers, began immediately after 29 April.
On 1 May and the following days, law enforcement personnel, together
with Bangladeshi settlers, entered a number of Jumma villages in the
Panchari-Khagrachari area and arbitrarily killed the Jumma inhabitants.
The villages included Golakpratimachara, Kalanal, Soto Karmapara,
Shantipur, Mirjibil, Hetarachara (also known as Khedarachara Mukhpara),
Pujgang, Laogang, Hathimuktipara, Sarveswarpara, Napidapara and Dewan
Bazar. After entering the Jumma villages, The Bangladeshi security
personnel ordered the inhabitants to assemble on open ground, men
separate from women, away from the villagers' huts. While the villagers
were held in this way their settlements were set on fire by the
Bangladeshi settlers. The Bangladeshi security personnel then opened
fire randomly on the groups of villagers who were assembled, killing
hundreds of Jumma men, women and children
Part of this process was described to the Amnesty International by a
woman from Mirjibil, about a mile from Panchari, who was witness to the
killing of another woman, aged in her 70s:
&quot;As soon as the raid on my village began, people (other villagers)
began to shout asking everybody to leave the village. But before most
people could gather their senses the soldiers and the Ansars had come.
They were followed by several hundred Muslim settlers.... They
immediately began to ransack the village.&quot;
&quot;The soldiers asked the men and the women to stand separately.... One
old woman, Phoidebi, had trouble getting up and joining the group
outside. A soldier shot her at close range.&quot;

7. Matiranga Massacre, May 1986:
Following the Bangladesh military atrocities described above many
people from the affected areas sought refuge in the forests away from
their homes. A few hundred people from several different villages
gathered during the first week of May between the villages of
Sarveswarpara and Manudaspara, in the Matiranga area. One night,
probably that of 1/2 May although the precise date is not known, while
they were trying to reach the Indian border, they were ambushed by a
detachment of Bangladeshi soldiers. The soldiers opened fire without
warning and shot at them randomly, without provocation. Over 70 Jumma
people were killed.

8. Comillatialla-Taindong Massacre, 18-19/05/1986:
After the Matiranga massacre a large group of Jumma people fleeing from
their homes, numbering over 200, most of whom were of the Tripura
nationality, were moving towards the Indian border at Silachari in
southern Tripura in mid May. Their presence in the area appears, to had
been known for some time to the Bangladeshi security personnel. They
were eventually discovered, by the troops of the 31st battalion of the
Banglaesh Rifles (BDR), who surrounded them and made them walk into a
narrow valley between the villages of Comillatilla and Taidong. In the
restricted space of this valley, the soldiers fired indiscriminately at
the group, killing most of the people. Once the firing had ceased, a
number of Bangladeshi settlers further attacked the group with machete
to kill the injured men, women and children.
. The massacre was described to the Amnesty International by a survivor
and refugee in India:
&quot;I am chief of a large colony of Tripuri tribals and we used to live a
little outside Matiranga. Around the end of April and early May, when
the Shanti Bahini began raids on the BDR, army and Muslims, the
soldiers began to come and bother us. We told them we were not even
Chakmas and had thus nothing to do with the Shanti Bahini. But they
harassed us.&quot;
&quot;Later, on 8 May, they came in strength and began to burn our village.
The officer-in-charge said you Hindus have no place in Bangladesh and
asked us to run away. We decided to flee along with some Chakma
families in our neighbourhood. But the soldiers did not even let us run
away in peace. They chased us and we hid in the jungles in the day,
making some progress by night.&quot;
&quot;Last Sunday (18 May) we were approaching the border when a large group
of soldiers caught us. The officer said that we would be treated nicely
and settled back. He asked us to walk back. The soldiers were around
us.&quot;
&quot;They took us to a narrow valley between Taidong and Comillatilla and
there suddenly we heard thousands of bullets and shrieks and screams of
our people. At least 200 of our people, mainly Tripuris, died. I do not
even have any trace of my family. I do not know whether my family
members are still in hiding somewhere or if they got killed.&quot;
&quot;As bullets rained from all sides the Muslims too descended on the
valley, raping women and killing people with swords, spears and knives;
we all ran for our lives in (the) direction of India.&quot;

9. Hirachar-Sarbotali-Khagrachari-Pablakhali
Massacres, 8,9,10 August, 1988:
The Bangladesh Army along with the aid of the Bangladeshi settlers
killed hundreds of the Jumma people(actual number not known, figures
based on the eye witness report) in the above areas. Many women were
gang raped by the Bangladesh Army and the settlers.

10. Longadu Massacre, 4/05/1989:
Abdur Rashid, a Bangladeshi community leader was gunned down by an
un-identified gunman. The Bangladesh authority and the Bangladeshi
settlers suspect that he was gunned down by the Shanti Bahini, due to
his involvement in the racially motivated crimes against the Jumma
people, though Shanti Bahini denies the claims.In reprisal to Abdur
Rashid's killing the Bangladesh Army, the Village Defense Party (armed
group formed by the Bangladeshi settlers) and the settlers carried out
this gruesome massacre. 40 Jumma people were killed, there dead bodies
never returned to the relatives. Their houses were burnt down and
Buddhist temples in the area were destroyed. Among the fallen victims
were the wife, children and grand-children of the former chairman of
the local council Mr. Anil Bikash Chakma. The Bangladesh Army had
grabbed his land and settled the Bangladeshi settlers around his
homestead. Mr. A.B. Chakma's friends and relatives had warned him of
the potential danger of living so close to the Bangladeshi settlers.
But he had no where else to go. On that day he was not in home, and
that saved his life. Later on even after repeated appeal to the
Bangladesh military authority, the dead bodies were never returned for
Buddhist religous rites and cremation.

11. Malya Massacre, 2/02/1992:
On 2 February 1992 two bombs exploded on a passenger boat at Malya. The
boat was on its way from Marishya to Rangamati. Malya is now inhabited
by the Bengali settlers from the plain. The explosion killed one
passenger and seriously injured the driver of the boat. The survivors
swam ashore, but the armed Bengali settlers were waiting for them. The
settlers attacked the Jumma passengers- men, women and children. About
30 of them were killed. Fourteen bodies were recovered, the others were
lost in the water.Some representatives of the Jumma people were
supposed to board the boat on their way to Rangamati and Dhaka to
protest against recent army atrocities in the area: Captain Masiur
Rahman of Bangladesh army had tortured a student Mr. Biswamuni Chakma
and a Buddhist monk (the Rev. Bodhimitra Bhikkhu) and had treated some
female students indecently. Moreover three Buddhist Viharas
(monasteries) had been desecrated by the army. According to an
eye-witness account, two members of the security forces boarded the
boat at Dulachari carrying two kerosene tins. They disembarked at the
next stop, leaving the tins. These exploded shortly afterwards. The
Bangladesh media reported that the explosion was caused by the Shanti
Bahini.

12. Logang Massacre, 10/04/1992:
On 10 April 1992 the biggest massacre in a single day, at single place,
in the history of the CHT took place at Logang cluster village in
Khagrachari District, perpetrated by the Bangladeshi security forces
and the Bangladeshi settlers.
The military forces forcibly relocated some fifteen hundred Jumma
families from the surrounding Jumma villages to the Logang cluster
village, which is nothing but a concentration camp, and distributed
their ancestral villages and farmlands to the Bangladeshi infiltrators
free of cost. Then they hatched a plot to find an excuse to get rid of
those Jumma prisoners. On 10 April, 1992, the military authorities sent
two Bangladeshis, armed with machete, to rape some Jumma women who were
grazing their cattle at their Logang cluster village. The Jumma women
tried to defend themselves and at the same time they cried for help. A
Jumma gentleman came to their rescue and asked the Bangladeshi rapists
to leave the Jumma women alone. Instead of going away, the rapists
attacked the Jumma gentleman and hacked him to death. During the
attack, one of the rapists was also injured. After killing the Jumma
gentleman, the rapists went straight to the camp of the Bangla Desh
Rifles (BDR). The military authorities found the excuse they were
looking for and used the injured rapist as a victim of the Shanti
Bahini (SB) attack. On the pretext of searching out the SB, the
military forces and the Bangladeshi settlers combinedly attacked the
Logang cluster village immediately after the arrival of the two rapists
at the BDR camp. They hacked many Jummas to death and shot dead those
who tried to flee. Then the invaders forced the old people, women and
children into their homes and burnt them alive by setting their homes
on fire.
The exact number of the Jumma people killed at Logang will never be
known, as many of the dead bodies had been removed by the military
immediately after the massacre. According to several eye-witness
reports the number must be well over 400. Some 800 houses were burnt
down and more than 2000 people fled across the border to Tripura of
India after the massacre.

13. Naniachar Massacre, 17/11/1993:
On 17 November 1993 at least 29 Jumma people were killed and more than
a hundred wounded when Bangladeshi settlers, supported by the
Bangladesh Army, attacked a peaceful rally of Jumma people in
Naniarchar Bazzar. The rally was organized by the Greater Chittagong
Hill Tracts Hill Students' Council, with the advance permission from
the local authorities, and was part of a campaign against the use of
the only waiting shed for motor-lauch passengers as an army check post.
The reports about the massacre which the CHT Commission has received
from various Bangladeshi and Jumma peoples' organizations and
individuals all draw roughly the same picture of the cause of events.
Naniarchar is surrounded on three sides by the Kaptai Lake, so people
travel mostly by boat. People arriving and departing from Naniarchar
are regularly questioned and harassed by the army personnel from the
checkpoint. There was widespread resentment among the local residents
against the army checkpost.On 17 November, soon after the students had
held their meeting and rally, Bangladeshi settlers led by Union Council
member Ahmed Miah held a counter demonstration, for which they had
obtained permission on the same day. There were joined by a few hundred
settlers from adjacent villages, led by Md. Ayub Hossain, president of
Parbatya Gana Parishad (Hill Tracts Peoples' Council, an organization
of the Bangladeshi settlers, not to be confused with the Hill Peoples'
Council of the Jumma people), and Abdul Latif, chairman of Burighat
Union Council. They arrived on boats, armed with iron rods, sticks and
machete. Surprisingly, the settlers were not disarmed by the army
personnel at the check post. Tension rose and at one point the settlers
started attacking the Jumma people. Even the Jumma people who tried to
escape by jumping into the lake were hacked to death. It was reported
that the law enforcing agencies did not try very hard to stop the
attack and observed impassively. Students defended themselves with
firewood and sticks which they collected from tea shops. Then the
settlers were already retreating, there was a whistle from the army
camp and the army opened fire on the students.
Investigations:
Most of the massacres of the Jumma people, have never been investigated
by the Bangladesh Government. After a few massacres the government did
set up an investigation committee, but never to much effect. The report
of the inquiry committee set up after the Logang massacre in April 1992
in which few hundred Jumma people were killed by the Bangladeshi
security forces and the Bangladeshi settlers, was made public. However
it largely projected the Bangladesh Army version of the event. The
report of the Naniarchar Massacre in November 1993 has never been made
public. Moreover, never have persons responsible for any massacre or
other human rights violations been tried in court. At the most a few of
the army officers have been transferred or given early retirement.
Religious Persecution in the CHT

This monk was injured by the Bangladesh Army. The Bangladesh Army
attacked his village and temple during the Matiranga, Panchari
massacres on 30 April - 1 May 1986, they destroyed the temple, Buddha
images and Buddhist texts. This monk like many others had to seek
refuge in Tripura, India.
The destruction of Jumma peoples' religious and cultural life in the
CHT have been a marked feature of the CHT conflict since the early
1970s. The Jumma peoples of the CHT are Buddhists, Hindus, Christians
and Animists. These religious groupings reflect ethnic differences. The
Chakma, Tangchanya and Marma are mainly Buddhists, the Tripuras Hindus
and some smaller groups such as the Bawm and Pankhua are Christians.
Mru and Khumi practise what is known as Animism. Religious tolerance
has been a long tradition of the Jumma people. One way of understanding
this tolerance is to see it in terms of an underlying element common
throughout the CHT which consists of different manifestations of an
underlying stratum of animistic traits which coexists with Buddhism,
Hinduism and Christianity.
The Jumma people consider themselves culturally very different from the
Bangladeshis. Bangladesh has Islam as the state religion. The state
education is oriented to 'mainstream' nationalism and in some cases,
according to the pupils and teachers, has a strong Islamic influence.
Bengali predominates over other languages and, apart from the few cases
where the Jumma people have developed their own schools, the
educational system in the CHT is designed to draw the Jumma people into
the Islamic culture of Bangladesh.
The main Islamic missionary organization is Al Rabita, funded by Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, this non governmental organization has been working
since 1980 to convert the Jumma people. It has a main office in Dhaka
and offices in Rangamati, Langadu where it also has a hospital, Barkal,
Alikadam of the CHT. At Alikadam, in 1990 the Al Rabita missionary
center converted 17 Marma people to Islam.
Throughout the CHT the mosque construction continues to take place.
Loudly amplified calls to prayer frequently punctuates the lives of the
Jumma people. The Bangladeshi authorities argue that their religious
tolerance can be seen in Buddhist, Hindu and Christian Welfare Trust.
One Chakma fellow said that he went to the Central Audit Bureau to seek
support from the Welfare Fund and was told: &quot;Why don't you become a
Muslim and we'll all be brothers&quot;. The most disturbing aspects of
religious persecution in the CHT are the destruction of temples,
prevention of worship, violence motivated by religious hatred and
forcible conversion to Islam.
There have been numerous incidents of forcible conversion in the CHT.
Chakma women who marry Bangladeshis whether by choice or abducted by
force, have to convert to Islam. The Jumma prisoners who are detained
in Chittagong, Rangamati or Khagrachari jails are placed in cells with
a majority of Muslims whose task it is to try and convert the Jumma
persons. The Jummas who are captured by the Bangladeshi security forces
are very often given the options of torture or conversion to Islam as a
way to escape the suffering.
In recent years the Jamat-i-Islami (Islamic fundamentalist political
party) has been very active in the CHT. It builds mosques, actively
promotes Islam and it was responsible for destroying Buddhist and Hindu
temples in the CHT.
An account by one of the monks now in Tripura described in detail an
incident in 1986 which took place in Panchari where a group of hill
people were attacked because they were not Muslims.
&quot;Before this happened, one day 13 of us went to market. I was not a
monk then. The Bangladesh Rifles (paramilitary force) and settlers
caught us and out of 13, nine were killed and four of us escaped. The
reason was that we were not Muslims; they wanted us to be Muslims to
take Islam. It was in the market itself and some of the people were
also caught up from around. Among the people whom they caught was my
wife. They cut her with daos (machette) - some of the marks on her neck
are still there. She is in Karbook (refugee camp in Tripura). This took
place in the market itself on market day, Wednesday. The others ran
away. They also tried to cut me with daos on the neck. Luckily my shirt
collar was thick and I escaped from being killed. As they killed the
others they shouted: 'Oh Chakmas, will you not become Muslims? If you
refuse we will kill you now'.&quot;
A Buddhist monk from the temple at Kalanal described to the Amnesty
International the persistent harassment of the Jumma villagers by the
military personnel and the settlers:
&quot;For many months now soldiers have been regularly visiting us and
slaughtering cows in our shrine.... They always said that if we did not
agree to this (conversion to Islam) they will come one day and kill
us.&quot;&quot;On the morning of 1 May they carried out their threat by escorting
a group of two to three hundred settlers, some of whom were dressed in
the uniform of home guards, to our village and began their depredations
by attacking Buddha Vihar (the temple). Most of us were, however, able
to flee but soldiers pounced on Purnananda Bhikku (one of the monks)
and after beating him with rifle butts handed him over to the Muslims
who threw him into the shrine which was by now on fire. He died. Later
when I met more people from my village they said that two young girls
of the village had been raped mercilessly by troops and Muslims and
then killed with bayonets.&quot;
Another woman described her experience that happened in March/April
1989 to the CHT Commission as following:
&quot;Some soldiers came to our house and woke us up and poured cold wate on
our heads. I had two daughters. The soldiers tried to take my
daughters, they were 9 and 11 years old. They hit me on the head with
lathi (bamboo stick). My head was bleeding. My daughters were crying As
my head was bleeding heavily, the soldiers gave me some medicine Then
they asked me whether I would become a Muslim. I said: 'No, I'd rather
die.' Then they said: Will you be able to stand naked before us and
also 'If you give us your daughters, we will release you.' They beat me
then and left.&quot;
Desecration is invariably accompanied by violent attacks against
worshippers. The following case was told by a Marma monk describing an
event in Pablakhali, Dighinala in 1985:
&quot;On that day first the settlers and the army surrounded the temple. I
was caught and my hands were tied with rope as were my legs. Water was
poured through my nostrils. I was kicked with boots and my leg was cut.
People came into the temple and caught all the girls. They took the
girls a little way from the temple. I heard the cries of the girls -
maybe they were raped but I did not see it with my own eyes. After a
few days I met one of the girls but as a monk I have some restrictions
and could not ask her what had happened. The army performed desecration
in the temples. They go in with boots on and throw away food in the
temple. Every day before 12 o'clock we offer food to Lord Buddha. The
Muslims say: 'then why does not stone eat it'? The army uses guns to
break plates. Once I was about to offer food to the Buddha and the
Muslims entered and said 'let's see if stone can eat', then they said
'stone can't eat' and they took the plate from my hands and threw it on
the floor. They bring animals into the temple and slaughter them: goats
and cows. Buddhist people never kill animals so you cannot worship in
the temple after that has happened. I have witnessed it. At Pablakhali
in 1985, before the attack, about 35-50 army personnel entered the
monastery with 100-150 settlers remaining outside. They cooked inside
the temple and burnt wood on the dirt floor and brought wood in. They
killed the animals outside the temple but within the boundary of the
temple. They did this to crush Buddhism and establish Islam. There was
no other reason for this.&quot;
The second incident took place in Mani Gram, Khagrachari in 1986 and
was also described by a Marma monk:
&quot;I was in Mani Gram Buddhist temple. On 12 June, 1986 we tried to
celebrate a function in the temple. All of a sudden some troops came
and said: 'Hey, what are you doing?' We replied: 'We are going to wash
our God'. The soldiers said: 'You cannot wash God because this is a
Muslim state. You cannot worship the Lord Buddha, you have to abandon
this religion and become Muslim.' We refused to do so. Then the
soldiers caught us and tied our hands and started to pour water on our
heads. I was the only monk there, the others were villagers numbering
around 20. All of us were tied in pairs and the soldiers starting
pouring water and when they were not satisfied by pouring water they
started kicking us with their boots. The water was not just water, but
it was mixed with green chilies. When we were tied up they stood with
bayonets over us so we would not struggle. My skin started burning and
most of us were injured as I was. I had cuts and sores on my legs. We
were tied up in afternoon and they started to burn the house of the
village which we could see. We were tied up from eight in the morning
to four in the afternoon, a total of eight hours. The soldiers untied
us. At about 5 o'clock they set fire to the temple and we went into
hiding in the jungles. The settlers were not with the soldiers when
they tied us up, but were there when the village was burnt. There is a
river called Chengi. After coming to the river we went hiding into the
deep jungle. After four days trekking all through the jungle. I reached
the border of Tripura (India) and Karbook camp. In that lot we were
around 450 people. Before 12th June there was no other incident. The
only reason for the attack was religion. If we became Muslim we could
stay safe. I know one Marma who was my friend called Uchmang. He was
threatened that if he did not become a Muslim he would be harmed with
his relatives. He was forcibly converted. He came from a different
village, Mahalchari in Khagrachari District.&quot;
A Marma monk in Tripura explained how the military authorities control
religious ceremonies in the Chittagong Hill Tracts:
&quot;Religious functions need a permit from the authorities, for example,
the Purnima full moon celebrations and several Purnima functions
numbering about six in a year. We need permits for other functions too.
Many people come to these functions. For a funeral ceremony no permit
is necessary, but seven days later, the seventh day ritual after
cremation needs permission from the authorities. When someone becomes a
monk you need such a permit. To celebrate functions you have to collect
money and so permission is needed. The permit is for both money
collection and the ceremony. The army officers give the permit. It was
always army officers who give it. There is no cost for the permit. I
used to go for the permit and was never refused but it was a lot of
trouble, waiting to meet the officer etc.&quot;
Chitmarang is the most sacred shrine of Buddhism in the CHT. Although
it is in an area which is predominantly Marma, thousands of Chakmas
traditionally traveled there annually to pay their respect to the
ancient image of the Buddha in the old temple. For several years
because of constant checks by the military, it has been impossible for
Buddhists to reach Chitmarang temple. Chitmarang no longer functions in
this capacity. The army have to give permission which is granted only
to the lucky few or to those who can afford to bribe the army.
Rape and Abduction of Jumma Women

This 13 years old Chakma girl was gang raped by the members of the
Bangladesh Army on 19 December 1986. About 20 personnel of the
Bangladesh Army from the army camp at Viswa Ram Karbari Para of
Dighinala, raided the Jumma village of Nuaram Karbari Para, at such a
time in the morning when all the male inhabitants of the village were
taken by force to cut the jungle surrounding the army camp. The
soldiers of the Bangladesh Army encircled the village at 11:00 a.m. and
on the pretext of making searches entered the houses. All the women and
the girls who were in their houses, were stripped by the soldiers and
were subjected to gang rape. Even the minors were not spared.
The Bangladeshi security personnel have been inflicting rape upon the
Jumma women since the conflict started in the mid 1970s. The Bangladesh
military systematically use rape as a deliberate tactic to destroy or
damage the Jumma nation. Women are targeted by the military for two
objectives: as a member of the 'enemy' and as a female individual. By
raping a woman the oppressor does not just aim at hurting her
personally, he takes what's a woman's private possession and at the
same time tramples and humiliates the identity of the Jumma people as a
whole. Jumma women are made pregnant by the Bangladesh military and
thus are forced to give birth to children of the enemy. According to
the Hill Women's Federation (HWF), there have been 47 reported cases of
rapes between January 1991 and June 1992, five in 1993, four in 1994
and twelve in 1995. The HWF maintains that there have been many more
such instances, but due to social taboos and fear of reprisals, the
victims or their families do not come forward with this kind of
information. The Jumma women are especially attractive and exotic to
the Bangladeshis. They move around more freely and are not bound by the
same cultural and religious impositions that restrict the freedom of
movement of Muslim women. These cultural differences combined with the
military presence and the increasing domination of Bengali Muslim
culture in the CHT have made the Jumma women more exposed to sexual
attacks and harassment. The CHT Commission interviewed some rape
victims in the refugee camps of Tripura, India. A woman told the CHT
Commission:
&quot;About 50 army personnel came in the night and rounded up the whole
village and gathered us in one place. In the morning all the men were
arrested. I was tied up hands and legs, naked. They raped me. There
were three women there. They raped me in front of my father-in-law.
After that we were tied up together, naked, facing each other. Then
they left. Three other girls were raped in front of me. This happened
in the month of Ashar (June/July) of 1985.&quot;
Another refugee woman from Dighinala told in Tripura:
&quot;In the early morning 5 to 6 groups of soldiers encircled the village
and some entered the huts. They caught all men and brought them to the
fields and tied them with rope. My husband had his teeth beaten out of
him, all blood. My son ran to his father and he was thrown to one side.
The army ordered me to go into my hut and pointed guns at me. One
grabbed me by the neck. My husband was near. My husband was almost
beaten to death. I was raped by three soldiers in the room. After this
I didn't want to live anymore, but what am I to do? I am still
suffering from it. My husband is still injured in the lungs and can't
work. I want to go back if there is peace, otherwise not. I want
medical treatment as I am still suffering from the rape. I am still
afraid of Muslims. My ribs were broken and my skin burns there. This
happened in June 1986. I am still like mad, disturbed.&quot;
A woman from Matiranga told what happened to her in April 1986:
&quot;They (the army) surrounded the village early in the morning, we had
not yet got up. Then they shouted to come out of the houses and
concentrated all the people in one place. Then they started asking
whether we had helped the SB (Shanti Bahini). All of us kept silent.
...Then they started beating the men and the women. One girl was taken
by three soldiers. I don't know where she was taken. Then it was my
turn. Two soldiers took me and subjected me to abuse. I was fully
naked, they harassed me, they even poked me with a bayonet. I was left
alone. I didn't know what to do. Somehow I managed to cover my body
with some cloth and went to the jungle and kept walking till I reached
India.&quot;
Life in the cluster villages is not safe, especially for women. Women
in cluster villages are more vulnerable to rape by Bangladesh Army
personnel and are often forced to spend the night with their rapist. A
man in one of the refugee camps explained:
&quot;I was forced to live in a cluster village. We had to come here because
we have a teenage daughter and we were afraid that she would be raped
by the army. ...A woman neighbor was raped in 1989 after the cluster
village was established. She then fled to India, together with 22 other
families.&quot;
Sometimes educated women are specifically targeted by the military.
Recounting an army attack on her village, one woman who worked in a
rubber plantation told the CHT Commission:
&quot;The army raped some of the women, especially college students and
women working in offices. Many girls were taken to the army camp. After
this incident (1989), intellectuals of the village were arrested by the
army so as to prevent them from taking shelter in India. ...The girls
who were taken away to the army camps were released after one week. In
the camp the army raped them repeatedly.&quot;
Forced itermarriage is one way in which women are used as an instrument
to integrate the Jumma people into Islamic Bangladeshi society and to
alter the demographic profile in the area. Many Jumma women had been
kidnapped, forcibly converted to Islam and married. Jumma women were
murdered who refused to be converted and married. A woman who came to
Tripura in July 1990 told the Commission:
&quot;I was walking along the road to go to the fields with my six-year old
niece to plant some seeds. A man appeared before us, bound my mouth
with a piece of cloth and took me away on his scooter. . .I was kept
for three months. I was forcibly converted to Islam and married.&quot;
Rape is used systematically as a weapon against Jumma women in the CHT.
Rape is a recurring characteristics of attacks by the Bangladesh
military and by the BD settlers on Jumma villages. Many women were gang
raped by the soldiers of the Bangladesh Army, often in front of their
children. Women live in continuous fear of rape. Women who have been
raped may be rejected by their husbands or their families, or may not
be able to get married. If they become pregnant they have to conceal
this fact and must try to have an abortion. If a child is born it is
impossible for the woman to stay in her community as the situation is
not accepted and she is ostracized. For these reasons women who have
been raped hesitate to talk about it at all because they are scared or
worried about the social stigma. This makes it difficult to collect
information on such sensitive issue. The trauma of rape remains with
these women form years, and many of them are still suffering from its
repercussions years later.
The Jumma Refugees fetch water in the relief camp of Tripura. These
refugees fled the Bangladesh military induced terror in their homeland.
An exodus to India was not a new event. But for the first time, the
refugees went in very large numbers and refused to be returned. The
exodus in 1986 led to the establishment of six relief camps in Tripura
state of India.
The Bangladesh armed forces and the Bangladeshi settlers had committed
numerous massacres and atrocities against the indigenous Jumma people
of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) as part of the Bangladesh
Government's policy to wipe out the Jumma people from their traditional
homeland in order to populate it with the Bangladeshi settlers. The
state terrorism forces the Jumma people to leave their ancestral
villages and farmlands and to join the tens of thousands of homeless
refugees. Thousands of them fled across the border to India and Burma
to escape the racial and genocidal atrocities of the fundamentally
hostile Bangladeshi regime. Since the CHT conflict started in 1975 the
Jumma refugees cross the border three times, in 1981 to Tripura, in
1984 to Mizoram and in 1986 to Tripura. The waves of refugees are
directly related to the waves of violence against the Jumma people in
the CHT. However, the origins of the refugees depend on the
accessibility of their villages to the borders. Most of the refugees in
Tripura come from the Khagrachari and Dighinala areas. On the other
hand, the majority of those fleeing from Langadu after the attacks on 4
May 1989, were not allowed into Mizoram and so remained in the forest
areas and did not attempt to make the dangerous trek across the CHT to
Tripura.

1. Refugees to Tripura, 1981
As a consequence of the Bangladeshi security forces genocidal campaigns
at Banraibari, Belchari, Ashalong, Gurangapara, Tabalchari in Feni
valley in June and September 1981 some 18,000 Jummas took refuge in the
Tripura state of India. At that time the Bangladesh Government denied
that the refugees were from Bangladesh. But the world community forced
the Bangladesh Government to repatriate the refugees. The Jumma
refugees agreed to go back to Bangladesh on the government's promise
that they would be given full protection from repression and that they
would get back their villages and farmlands in addition to sufficient
financial help for their rehabilitation. It is needless to say that the
Bangladeshi regime did not keep its promises. Mr. Michael Roche (the
Secretary of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, Berkeley, California,
U.S.A) visited the CHT to investigate the genocidal crimes committed by
the Bangladesh Authorities against the innocent indigenous people of
the CHT. He gave a very clear picture of the plight of the refugees in
his report published in the Buddhist Peace Fellowship Newsletter-
&quot;...early this year, some 18,000 of them were repatriated to
Bangladesh. These tribal people were met at the border by hostile
Bangladesh officials and were given the equivalent of $8 and were left
to their fates. Return to their native villages is, of course,
impossible for these refugees because their homes and possessions have
been appropriated by Bengali settlers, so they join the tens of
thousands of homeless now in the Hill Tracts. Harassed by government
authorities, unable to flee the country and without any means of
support, they live in limbo in a land where the quality of tribal life
approached the infernal&quot;.

2. Refugees to Mizoram, 1984
In May and June 1984, the Bangladesh Army (7th and 26th Bengal), the
Bangladesh Rifles (BDR - 17th Battalion) and Bangladeshi settlers
launched surprise attacks on the Jumma inhabitants of Bhusan Chara,
Gorostan, Bhusan Bagh, Tarengya Ghat, Het Bhoriya, Suguri Para, Choto
Harina in the Barkal sub district killing at least 300 Jummas mostly
women and children, burning houses, looting valuables and destroying
Buddhist temples. The Bangladesh Army also pursued a &quot;scorched earth&quot;
campaign for a month between 20 September and 19 October 1984 in order
to evict the villagers of Bar Kalak, Othyal Chari, Harin Hat Para, Mong
Chari, Shivram Para and Bamer Subalong in the Gaba Chari area of the
Subalong valley. As a result of these massacres and scorched earth
campaign, about 18,000 Jumma refugees fled to Mizoram, India. But the
Mizoram state government pushed most of them back to Bangladesh.
However the Indian Government has kindly given shelter to over 4,000
refugees at Tibira Ghat and Tagalak Bak in the Demagiri Sub Division of
the Lunglei District of Mizoram. Those refugees who were sent back to
Bangladesh could not return to their homes because their villages had
already been distributed to the Bangladeshi settlers. They took refuge
in the neigbouring upland forests and mountains.

3. Refugees to Tripura, 1986
On 29 April 1986, the Shanti Bahini attacked several army camps and
Bangladeshi settlements. The Far Eastern Economic Review reported in
June 1986:
&quot;..a reorganized Shanti Bahini force carried out its biggest
coordinated attack on 29 April as it simultaneously raided several
Bangladeshi army camps and the outposts of paramilitary Bangladesh
Rifles and followed it up with swoops on new settlements of immigrant
Bengali Muslims. In turn, the Muslim settlers and government forces
carried out reprisals on tribal villages forcing the tribes people to
flee to India on 30 April&quot;.
On 30 April 1986, the Bangladesh armed forces attacked six villages in
Matiranga Upazilla (sub District): Khetra Mohan Para, Boga Para, Bagya
Para, Sarveswar Para, Assalong Para and Talukder Para. On the following
day 1 May 1986, they invaded two villages in Khagrachari Upazilla:
Mahajon Para and Pankheiya Para, and 24 villages in Panchari Upazilla:
Shantipur, Latiban, Kamini Member Para, Chitta Ranjan Para, Surya Sen
Para, Sachindra Karbari Para, Badidhan Karbari Para, Rangapani Chara,
Napida Para, Ratan Muni Para, Golak Pudima, Joutha Khamar Para, Suta
Karma Para, Kanago Para, Birendra Karbari Para, Madan Karbari Para,
Rabi Singha Karbari Para, Sucharu Master Para, Pujgang Mukh, Ganesh
Chandra Karbari Para, Manikya Karbari Para, Mongal Dhan Karbari Para,
Dhanendu Karbari Para and Jamindhan Karbari Para. Properties were
looted, houses were burnt, women were abducted and gang raped, Buddhist
temples were desecrated and destroyed, and the villagers including the
Buddhist monks were tortured and murdered.As a result of the
Matiranga-Panchari-Khagrachari massacres, some 500 indigenous people
mostly old age, women and children were murdered, about 50 villages
were destroyed, over 40,000 people were rendered homeless, about dozen
Buddhist temples including those at Kalanal, Kamini Member Para, Suta
Karma Para, Shantipur (north), Shantipur (south), Rangapani Chara,
Panchari and Pujgang were destroyed, many Buddhist monks were wounded
and Rev. Purna Nanda Bhikkhu of Kalanal Buddhist temple was hacked to
death. The villagers fled to nearby forests for their lives. They lost
all their possessions and they had nothing to live on. The only way for
them to evade military atrocities was to head towards the Indian
border. They had to walk for weeks without food along the most
difficult jungle tracks. It was extremely risky for them to enter
Tripura as the border was closely guarded by the Bangladesh Rifles
(BDR). For example, a group of 200 Jummas of Tripura nationality,
mostly old men, women and children from Matiranga Upazilla were fleeing
to the Tripura state of India. On 18 May 1986, the BDR rounded up these
refugees at the border, took them to Taidong and Comillatilla, and
prompted the Bangladeshi settlers to massacre them. The BDR opened fire
on even those refugees who managed to slip into Tripura, killing and
wounding many of these refugees.An exodus to India was not a new event.
But for the first time, the refugees went in very large numbers and
refused to be returned. The exodus in 1986 led to the establishment of
the six relief camps in the State of Tripura. The camps had an average
refugee population of 56,000 and at the height of the influx there were
80,000 refugees in Tripura.
For many years, the Indian Government wanted the refugees to
repatriate. Indian authorities, both at the national and in the state
of Tripura, where most of the refugees lived, kept camp conditions
harsh to discourage the refugees from remaining in India. The Indian
authorities did not permit UNHCR or International NGOs access to the
Jumma refugees. They also pressured the refugees to leave.
Several repatriations occurred over the years, including groups of
1,850 and 3,500 refugees in 1994, but refugees often encountered poor
conditions and the Bangladesh authorities did not delivered promised
aid, including helping the returnees regain their land.The remaining
Jumma refugees were repatriated after a treaty signed between the Jana
Samhati Samiti and the Bangladesh Government on 2 December 1997. While
the refugees were in India for 12 years, their land is usually taken
over by the Bangladeshi settlers who coveted it before the attack.
Although the land is legally in the hands of the refugees, there are
sometimes problems which exacerbate the difficulties of regaining land.
The land documents are frequently destroyed when the houses are burnt,
which means that the only records of the deeds lie with the
authorities. In some cases the Bangladeshi settlers obtain false
documents for the same land and it becomes difficult for the Jumma
people to prove ownership.
