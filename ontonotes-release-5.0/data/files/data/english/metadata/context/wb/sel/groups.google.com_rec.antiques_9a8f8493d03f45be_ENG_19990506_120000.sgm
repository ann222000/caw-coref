Dear Internet friends:

Im asking you for help. I have an internet friend i have been talking to
for 2 years now.
We have turned into best friends over that time. Sadly she has cancer. Our
only wish
was to meet someday, but im afraid time is running out and she lives in
australia and
I live in the states. I go to school full time and work part time and
could no way afford
the trip. So im asking all that reads this to please put a dollar or so
in an envelope and
mail it to the address below to help with the cost of the trip.

I Thank you ever so much:

T.R. Glass
Box 346 r1
Saxton,pa 16678

The &quot;faraway friend who is dying, please help me with the trip&quot; is the
oldest scam on the Internet. We have seen it on this newsgroup about
once a year. One supposes it could be real, but until there are some
specifics, I'll hold my dollar. Thanks anyway.

"/> For some reason, this plea reminded me of the antique joke concerning
the native of
Delhi who had emigrated to the US. He saved his money for three years
in order to go back to India to visit his family. When he had the money
saved up he went to the airport, plunked down his cash, and asked for a
ticket. Through some miscalculation he was a nickel short, so he went
out into the terminal and started panhandling.

&quot;Please, sir, I need a five cents to go to India,&quot; he begged.

A well dressed man tossed him a coin and said &quot;Here's a dime; take a
friend.&quot;
