The Mughals were an Indian Islamic dynasty that ruled the Indian subcontinent from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. They built a magnificent empire based on well-established institutions and were renowned for the art of the book: binding, calligraphy, painting and collecting. The Mughal Emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605) could not write. He has been described as being "unlettered" and possibly suffered from dyslexia. However, his chronicles describe him as having "an excellent eye and a good memory for the books" that were read to him daily. An extensive library was an essential requisite of power.

The awareness week will consist of a bulletin board display, distribution of various flyers as well as demonstrations of safety equipment to encourage the Jamat to learn about such life-threatening issues. Find out how you can prepare your family for disasters at the Crisis Awareness Week.  Please see your Crisis Management Lieutenant or Captains for further details.
