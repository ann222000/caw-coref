I tested and wrote about the Tesla. It is very expensive because of the carbon fiber construction. I have grave concerns about the battery pack. No one is allowed to take this car on an extended---two or three day--test so I couldn't see how hot they got when recharging or the length of travel possible. As all electrics, they are quick but can be touchy in trying to get smooth acceleration in stop and go traffic And, they raised the price to $98,000.

For half that price you can get a Phoenix five passenger pick-up truck that we also tested. It was not as smooth as the Tesla, but I have more faith in its battery pack. Here is a brief look at the article:

. I have seen Jay Leno's garage. It is packed with quality motorcycles and cars that are quite unique as a whole.

Interesting read Alan but I doubt they would let anyone take a test drive
for three days? (LOL) Sorry but I really found that funny. I would not go
back!   I'm sure it's a worthy request but I think they only have 100 units?
But it's fantastic you drove one! Can you tell us a bit more?

I personally think it's good value for money as it's a sports car as opposed
to a family car.  In the UK it cost 50 grand (UK) which I think is a very
fair price.  If I did not LOVE my TF so much (You never mentioned them!) I'm
really in no hurry for an e-car.  I still prefer clean electrickery over any
over source though.

But I honestly think the high publicity is worth more than any hype we may
see from tesla. Celebrities (Like them or not) can get the message out much
more effectively than any politician.  I'm not talking legislation here,
that's another story but people like J can have a great effect on the
message! So please tell us, how the hell did you get a look in on Js garage?
I still cannot believe he has a Mclaren! It's been my dream car for 10 years
now but costs a cool million dollars.  A little bit out of my league.  And I
would happily pollute my neighbors if I had one :)

Anyway,  you're a very interesting fellow and I was wondering if you worked
for a magazine? How come you got to test drive a Tesla? Just curious.

Take care,

Rich

They have taken orders for over 300 of them, according to the
marketing chief. The car handles quite well, but it lacks the road
feel that I like in a sports car such as the BMW. I believe that if
the batteries prove to be good they will modify the suspension a bit.
They are opening a real sales outlet in Santa Monica....probably next
year.

It has a kit car feel to it, but there are no rattles or a feeling of
impending doom. Light, but sturdy. It is very difficult to tell how
fast you are going. There is no sound and very little wind noise. The
tire noise is constant so that does not help your senses to adjust. In
traffic it isn't easy to live with if it is just going about 15 miles
per hour as it requires a gentle touch and the angle of the
accelerator was difficult for me to adjust to. Over time it would be
fine....sort of like the thumb accelerator on the TFs. They are
supposed to bring out a sedan for half the price in a year or two.
That would be of interest. Meanwhile AC Propulsion is modidying xB
Scions to run only on electric for $60 or more thousand....makes the
Tesla seem like a real bargain.

Jay Leno's garage is really a series of warehouses. He has a full time
staff and they are all quite friendly and willing to answer dumb
questions. I belong to the Motor Press Guild and we took at trip there
as a group. We visit rare collections hidden away several times a
year. We just got back from a large MB collection stores in a
storefront in Huntington Beach. The owner drives a McLaren MB and has
it licenses in Oregon to save money......seems a bit evil to me. If
you can afford a half million dollar car at least you could pay
California taxes. Or, perhaps one of his homes is in Oregon and he was
just visiting for the last several years. He didn't have any electric
vehicles, but he had some interesting German army Volkswagens that
were modified for WW Two work.

I write a syndicated column and test new cars weekly. We are doing the
new Scion xB this week and the xD next week. You can read them by just
typing in The Car Family at Google....but that only shows the North
American ones. To get the others you have to use Google of
Australia...yes, the Googles are different.

As for great cars, the new MB Bluetec diesel sedan is remarkable. We
got over 30 mph and it has a fine ride and good handling...of course
it cost over 50 thousand and isn't for sale in all states. We selected
the Prius are car of the year the first year it came out and the year
the newer version arrived. No other automobile journalist has that
honor. For about 20 to 30 thousand private firms are now modifying the
Prius to run longer on battery power...up to 45 mph, before the gas
kicks in.

Despite all this, except for some cars such as the MB C clas
convertible with the 500 hp AMG package, the TF is more fun. I only
wish I could get a little more speed out of it.....and I am sure I am
not alone.

Ohhhh we Love you Alan! (Manly ways)

I guessed you wrote professionally and it's a real treat for us to get your
input, thanks so much for that.  Also, I find it very interesting you are
pro electric.  I wonder if that is through choice or just your job? You seem
enthusiastic.  I wish more motor journalists would follow your path.  Ever
heard of Jeremy Clarkson? That's what we have in the UK but he is a good
laugh though.  Shame we have no one like you.  Anyway, it's wonderful to get
a real world report on the tesla.  The Privilege is ours and I thank you. I
really, really enjoyed that read.

Take care and PLEASE give us heads up every now and then. It would be too
cheeky to ask for a regular feature so I wont (Me bad).  But a little report
now and then would be the way cool! Up there as my youngest would say :) We
are getting quite big exposure here and it will get eve bigger once Matra
spank the market.  So you're another one of our VIPs doing good.

Cheers Alan,

Rich
