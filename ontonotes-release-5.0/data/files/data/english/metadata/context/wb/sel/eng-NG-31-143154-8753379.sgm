A wise sage named Eric once wrote that,

&quot;We must also be wary of our beliefs, whether based on knowledge or
not. Our beliefs act as blinders and colored lenses through which we
perceive the world around us.&quot;

What assertions made on this board are based on fact and not heartfelt
belief?

Are there verifiable facts?

Once seeking has been dropped, are beliefs blinding?

Hi Gary,

You want factual assertations?

This might work in the emperical world, but not necessarily concerning
what we discuss. The Tao that can be talked about is not the true Tao.

No one can know truth. Truth alone knows.

Richard, before 'no one can know truth'can be said,wouldn't it be
necessary to know this truth that no one can know? When you wrote 'no
one can know truth',what truth are you pointing to,or pointing out?

Yes, we can't know what is behind the door.

I'm speaking of something which this board seems rather reluctant to
discuss.  I'm referring to what is in front of your face and under
your feet.  I'm forgetting all the neo-Advaita correct indoctrination
and asking you to relate to the 'normal', beer drinking man..or
woman.  So, life is what they see.  They haven't sold out to any
particular belief system, other than non-stop weekend ESPN, chips and
an unexamined certainty that they are deciding which channels to
watch.  I suspect that certain arguments made on this board would,
with some analysis, make sense to the average Joe/Georgette.  Others
would be seen as unfounded speculation.  For example, I think that you
could hit mute during the commercials and agree that there is only
'now'.  You would probably have a difficult time convincing Joe that
he is one with his beer nuts.  Do these simple assertions blind/bind?
I would suggest a yes/know..maybe answer.  'Yes', if the end result is
a clinging to another concept.  Should Joe consider your argument and
find that he isn't so sure that he, the individual, selects which
channel to watch, then this process might not be binding/blinding.

Do you assume that any talk about nonduality is indoctrination?

Is it not possible that some talk about nonduality is the best
possible expression of &quot;what is&quot; that a speaker can offer?

I'm not sure what the concern is about beer-drinking Joe and what he
assumes reality to be.

Is one trying to convince beer-drinking Joe of something?

If beer-drinking Joe assumes he has an existence of his own, and that
assumption determines his reality, is someone supposed to assume
another existence outside of Joe, from which to communicate the
supposed truth to Joe?

The reason for speaking to the issue of nonduality is that the
assumption of an existence with its own inherent qualities *to
anything* has been seen through.

Such speaking is an invitation to open to and as this truth, but such
opening isn't dependent on saying the right things.

It's not dependent on thought or speech.

Yet, when such opening occurs, one finds themes in the speech that is
subsequently offered (across centuries, and across cultures).

If one recognizes these themes, one might assume some kind of
indoctrination has taken place.

But that would only be possible if one mistook the finger for the
moon, the speech about &quot;what is&quot; for &quot;what is.&quot;

So, perhaps you are saying that many mistake the finger for the moon,
and therefore rather than opening to/as &quot;what is,&quot; open themselves to
being indoctrinated.

Things like that have always taken place in the name of religion and
spirituality.

Hence, one must discover this truth for and as one's own being - not
because of what someone else said about it.

Beer-drinking Joe will only have a use for this truth when and if he
gets sick of the results of assuming an existence with inherent
qualities to Joe, to &quot;me.&quot;

And if Joe never finds a need to surrender his assumed separation, and
just wants to keep on doing the things he does, and get the results
he's been getting -- so it goes.

One thing about being awake - it's not about the other guy!

It's not about beer-drinking Joe or anyone else out there (which are
objects forming through the screen of perception).

It's not about convincing someone to see things a certain way to make
the world a better place (although surely many mistake it for such).

It is always only about the one here, now, and exactly what is
presenting itself as this experience.

Dan:

The indoctrination refers to unverifiable interpretations of
experience which are used to present Advaita.

1.  The unmanifest absolute
2.  All is one

Neither of the above concepts are needed to undermine the sense of
individual volition.  Neither of the above is anything more than a
sense of what is up and a nod to representations by others.  Both may
be useful tools as pointers and as such no problem, but when
discussed, both are looking at the finger.

In my experience and I don't want to define &quot;my&quot;.  Thoughts appear and
I watch them appear in a background of silence.  There is awareness
and in that awareness there are thoughts/perceptions.  That is the
extent of what I can affirm.  Beyond this I can put together a story
of oneness and so on.

Dan.. Is your experience beyond this?

Gary -

I think it would be worthwhile to look into what you mean by
&quot;unverifiable.&quot;

How do you verify and interpretation of experience?

I can say this about &quot;verifying&quot;:  it is subjective and cultural and
it depends on memory and the past.

Verification doesn't apply to an investigation of what is immediately
so.

Experience changes moment to moment.

At the present moment, as you reference a memory to give substance to
a critique or to a &quot;verifiable interpretation&quot; - at the instant,
experience is already changing!

Why would you have the intention of undermining volition?

Isn't having the intention to do something and implication of
volition?

So, your volition is to undermine volition?

Why do you not consider what you said about awareness watching
thoughts against a background of silence to be a story?

Would not someone else find such a statement to be fanciful and not
verifiable?

You ask about my experience.

Certainly, anything I say about it is as much a story as anything
anyone else shares here.

But, here goes:

My experience is that although people use words to reference an
experiencer, there is no actual experience of any experiencer apart
from the experience.

Therefore, the experience is an aspect of what the experiencer is, and
the experiencer is an aspect of what the experience is.

Experience and experiencer are constructed, are formed and formulated
(using the past as a template, including using sensation).

My experience of my experience being constructed isn't, therefore,
truly an experience.

It can be inferred and pointed to, but the actuality that it is, can
only be known first-hand.

When you use a word like &quot;awareness&quot; -- that might be a metaphor, a
pointer to what is so, as experience is constructed to be experience
(through contrast, through time).

What is so, timelessly.

There certainly is no division in what is so timelessly.

Division requires time.

One might use &quot;silence&quot; to point to what involves no time.

But this silence is also the source of all noise.

So, what can be said when the awareness that observes a sensation, and
the sensation, are not-two?

Not a whole lot!

And, if &quot;all is one&quot; or &quot;silence&quot; is being used as a pointer to
divisionlessness, fine.

All pointers fail anyway.

And that is a good thing!

Dan Heisenberg:

Awareness is immediately so.
The thought that &quot;awareness is immediately so&quot; is tainted by time and
memory.
Verification is in time and relies upon memory..etc..  I agree with
all of this..

&quot;Undermining volition&quot; = questioning the existence of the individual
as an independent actor.

Awareness watching is a story when described.  When 'happening' it
just is.

Yes, a busy mind would find that story to be somewhat off base.

But there is a commonality of experience that can be agreed upon by
many.  There are some concepts that are more readily accepted and may
prove to be more powerful pointers.

Regarding your description under the heading.. here goes:

My brain hurts, but I think that we were describing the same
whatever.. but one question:

Why do you say that &quot;this silence is also the source of all noise&quot;?

This is where I get lost.  Yes, all pointers fail, but I don't
understand where this one came from.  Is there an experience of seeing
this silence evolve into sound, but yet remain silence?  I have a
sense that I can see the space that permeates what eyes see.  I can't
describe the sense and in the telling it becomes another story.  As
subjective as this experience may be and however off-base my
interpretation of what is seen may be, it still forms some misguided
basis for suggesting that space permeates all.

&gt; I think it would be worthwhile to look into what you mean by
&gt; &quot;unverifiable.&quot;

&gt; How do you verify and interpretation of experience?

&gt; I can say this about &quot;verifying&quot;:  it is subjective and cultural and
&gt; it depends on memory and the past.

&gt; Verification doesn't apply to an investigation of what is immediately
&gt; so.

&gt; Experience changes moment to moment.

&gt; At the present moment, as you reference a memory to give substance to
&gt; a critique or to a &quot;verifiable interpretation&quot; - at the instant,
&gt; experience is already changing!

&gt; Why would you have the intention of undermining volition?

&gt; Isn't having the intention to do something and implication of
&gt; volition?

&gt; So, your volition is to undermine volition?

&gt; Why do you not consider what you said about awareness watching
&gt; thoughts against a background of silence to be a story?

&gt; Would not someone else find such a statement to be fanciful and not
&gt; verifiable?

&gt; You ask about my experience.

&gt; Certainly, anything I say about it is as much a story as anything
&gt; anyone else shares here.

&gt; But, here goes:

&gt; My experience is that although people use words to reference an
&gt; experiencer, there is no actual experience of any experiencer apart
&gt; from the experience.

&gt; Therefore, the experience is an aspect of what the experiencer is, and
&gt; the experiencer is an aspect of what the experience is.

&gt; Experience and experiencer are constructed, are formed and formulated
&gt; (using the past as a template, including using sensation).

&gt; My experience of my experience being constructed isn't, therefore,
&gt; truly an experience.

&gt; It can be inferred and pointed to, but the actuality that it is, can
&gt; only be known first-hand.

&gt; When you use a word like &quot;awareness&quot; -- that might be a metaphor, a
&gt; pointer to what is so, as experience is constructed to be experience
&gt; (through contrast, through time).

&gt; What is so, timelessly.

&gt; There certainly is no division in what is so timelessly.

&gt; Division requires time.

&gt; One might use &quot;silence&quot; to point to what involves no time.

&gt; But this silence is also the source of all noise.

&gt; So, what can be said when the awareness that observes a sensation, and
&gt; the sensation, are not-two?

&gt; Not a whole lot!

&gt; And, if &quot;all is one&quot; or &quot;silence&quot; is being used as a pointer to
&gt; divisionlessness, fine.

&gt; All pointers fail anyway.

&gt; And that is a good thing!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you assume that any talk about nonduality is indoctrination?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not possible that some talk about nonduality is the best
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible expression of &quot;what is&quot; that a speaker can offer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure what the concern is about beer-drinking Joe and what he
&gt; &gt; &gt; assumes reality to be.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Is one trying to convince beer-drinking Joe of something?

&gt; &gt; &gt; If beer-drinking Joe assumes he has an existence of his own, and that
&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption determines his reality, is someone supposed to assume
&gt; &gt; &gt; another existence outside of Joe, from which to communicate the
&gt; &gt; &gt; supposed truth to Joe?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason for speaking to the issue of nonduality is that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption of an existence with its own inherent qualities *to
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything* has been seen through.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Such speaking is an invitation to open to and as this truth, but such
&gt; &gt; &gt; opening isn't dependent on saying the right things.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's not dependent on thought or speech.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, when such opening occurs, one finds themes in the speech that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; subsequently offered (across centuries, and across cultures).

&gt; &gt; &gt; If one recognizes these themes, one might assume some kind of
&gt; &gt; &gt; indoctrination has taken place.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But that would only be possible if one mistook the finger for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; moon, the speech about &quot;what is&quot; for &quot;what is.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, perhaps you are saying that many mistake the finger for the moon,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and therefore rather than opening to/as &quot;what is,&quot; open themselves to
&gt; &gt; &gt; being indoctrinated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Things like that have always taken place in the name of religion and
&gt; &gt; &gt; spirituality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, one must discover this truth for and as one's own being - not
&gt; &gt; &gt; because of what someone else said about it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Beer-drinking Joe will only have a use for this truth when and if he
&gt; &gt; &gt; gets sick of the results of assuming an existence with inherent
&gt; &gt; &gt; qualities to Joe, to &quot;me.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; And if Joe never finds a need to surrender his assumed separation, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; just wants to keep on doing the things he does, and get the results
&gt; &gt; &gt; he's been getting -- so it goes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing about being awake - it's not about the other guy!

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's not about beer-drinking Joe or anyone else out there (which are
&gt; &gt; &gt; objects forming through the screen of perception).

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's not about convincing someone to see things a certain way to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; the world a better place (although surely many mistake it for such).

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is always only about the one here, now, and exactly what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; presenting itself as this experience.

if all pointers fail,then even the most powerful pointer only fails in
a most powerful way.

and as this is seen,all that remains is all that was - all that is -
the silence which is the source of all pointing.

without division,silence is inseparable from it's own noise making.

'noise' is noticing - is energy fluxating - awareness watching.

awareness,immediately so,doesn't dependend on thought or time for
immediateness,timelessness.it is so.

Time manifests timelessly.

The timeless loves time, so to speak, including all beings in and of
time, yet itself not a being and timeless.

It is the timing of time, hence all that manifests manifests exactly
when, how, and as it is to manifest.

The manifest and the unmanifest are not divisible.  This you behold
now, is the unmanifest, given qualities by your own act of perceiving,
in which the perceiver is the perceived.

The silence is not divided from anything that is.

The silence neither is nor is not, but includes all that is, and
includes all affirmations and negations.

All noise is from and of this silence, because all that is, is of and
from this silence.

Nothing is excluded from this silence that one is.

All qualities are from and of this, which has no quality.

All that is named is from and of this, which is nameless.

All that has location is from and of this, which is nonlocal.

One is this silence.

Therefore, the observer is what is observed.

If I observe noise, I am the noise.

I am the stillness which allows the noise to be known as noise.

The silence we can speak of, is not the same as the silence which is
beyond our knowledge, which is our very being, of which we have never
spoken.

Reading your B.S. is so much better than reading the rest of our
mumblings, but it seems that no proof can be offered.  Everything that
we speak of is based upon some basic unproven belief.  As previously
suggested, the usefulness of the pointers is really the only value
offered in any of these discussions.  I can tell you that all is one
because all appears in consciousness and is dependent on
consciousness.  Of course, I'm assuming that when I fall asleep that
the illusory world also sleeps.  Once again it seems to me that this
neo-Advaita stuff is just another belief system.  For me, it is a
belief system that I find useful in my everyday life.  Ultimately, as
pointed out many times by many members, there is just a undefined
functioning prior to thought.  Undermining the sense of an
individual's mind/ego through some basic pointers has some value to
the seeker, but then again, who makes such an offer of help and who
receives the pointers?  Bob makes all of this stuff simple by
suggesting that 'nothing is wrong if you don't think about it'... The
individual is happy and suffers.  Such is the outer play.  Once
identity is no long fascinated with this roller coaster life, then the
outer apparent happiness/suffering/unexamined beliefs are no longer
binding/blinding, but the outer play continues..until it doesn't and
the eyes shut for the last time.

Hi Gary -

If what you say is so, then what you believe to be true about belief
and its limitations, is also unfounded and assumed!

The concept of wrong, isn't wrong.

It's just another concept.

Just as the thought that one would be better off not to think about
things, is just another thought.

We speak of words and ideas as things that we assimilate and use.

What is it that we can't assimilate, and therefore can't use?

The priceless pearl?  The unborn?  Or just a soggy taco?

Love,

-- Dan

Yes, that is exactly my point. I also noted that I much enjoy your
B.S..  As with others on this board, you have a talent for pounding on
the keyboard.

My sense is that we live in a box and can only guess as to what is
outside of the box.  Inside the box, we create our own reality and
when examined, the &quot;we&quot; that creates is as mysterious as that which is
outside of the box.

Are beliefs really binding? Really? Here for some time and then gone.
Who is bound, and where?

Hi Gary,

I agree with Ram; 'Too much thinking'.

A common refrain in traditional Advaita goes something like this;
'What can't be proven, needn't be proven, and so no proof is
necessary.' Whatever 'poof' you need, whatever means of 'proving', and
even the 'one' who's proven to, is all in the mind; is just a 'mind-
thing', the clear seeing of which is Freedom Now.

Let 'discriminative wisdom' (innate wisdom) be your final arbiter. Non-
abidance in the mind anywhere is 'stinking enlightenment'... the final
resting place (nirvana) of Buddha. The mind is the devil's playground.
And it's very good entertainment once you stop taking it so seriously.
Don't take it seriously. It isn't serious. 'Serious' is all in the
mind.

So 'needing proof' is just another trick of the mind to keep us in the
mind where all the trouble begins... where we never get no relief... so
satisfaction... just mind... mind... mind... all over the place like a sloppy
burrito.

I find it funny that most of us here on this board have a morbid urge
to verbalize and intellectualize everything... or even something as
simple as *this*... life as it is. Granted the brain IS Richard's second
favorite organ. ;) But as Uncle Fester always says; 'The answer's not
in the mind'.

So write that on the chalkboard a thousand times or else sit facing a
wall for 12 years until you get it.  Or just become absolutely
totally, stupidly, incredibly lazy like me and 'stop'...

*   *   *

A wise fool said; 'Life's not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to
be lived.'

Mystery works best in the dark. And Mystery works wonders there also.
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.  Wake up. Your true
life is right before your eyes.

Just 2¢ Worth

Well Ram.
That is my point..

This board has thousands of posts.  We have creation/manifestation/
mind/ego/self-realization discussed and then discussed some more.  My
posts from the last two weeks are attempting to suggest to board
members that all of this is unknown, except for the sense of being
aware.. the sense of I am.  The rest is just a belief structure and
the mind defining.  The whole Advaita thing, when discussed, is a
belief structure, conceptual framework, or we could call it a
philosophy/religion.  It isn't any more valid than any other
philosophy, except for that basic sense.  Perhaps this is stating the
obvious.  Certainly it is stating the obvious for many of the regular
participant.

Hi Nathan,

Good post.

One thing you said I wasn't sure about and hope you will explain is in
your:

&quot;Let 'discriminative wisdom' (innate wisdom) be your final arbiter.
Non- abidance in the mind anywhere is 'stinking enlightenment'... the
final resting place (nirvana) of Buddha.&quot;

Isn't non-abidance in the mind NOT 'stinking enlightenment'? I always
thought that 'stinking enlightenment' is what we do here. Rambling on
about mental concepts expressing enlightenment.

Am I discorrect?

Regards,
Richard

Yes Gary, I agree, it's all meaningless wordplay.

But, you guys can be pretty fun playmates, so as long as it's fun,
let's play.

You're definitely stating the obvious, but I don't sense that anyone
takes this word dance too seriously, or is trying to prove that
they've &quot;got it&quot; and the rest of those idiots don't. We've all got it/
are it, but there I go stating the obvious.

Or, maybe I'm missing your intent completely and you're really trying
to tell us that we're all just wasting our time and should get lost,
or perhaps simply that you want to pretend we're in boxes. They used
to make pretty fun forts when we were kids. But they were just
imaginary forts, afterall.

You are 'discorrect', as usual, Richardl.

'Stinking enlightenment' (what we do here) is still the same ol'
enlightenment, all be it 'stinky' to those more/less enlightened. ;-)

So I did mean 'enlightenment' when I said 'stinking enlightenment' as
in no real difference between the two. 'Stinking enlightenment' is
just my way of having fun with it and not taking it, the E word, or
myself, too seriously.

Sorry if my stinking post confused you.

:-)

Ram:

How can you be wasting time when time is an illusion.  It is good to
get the wink and nod out in the open.  Once there is a realization
that you are being lived, the philosophy is irrelevant.

&quot;We must also be wary of our beliefs, whether based on knowledge or
not. Our beliefs act as blinders and colored lenses through which we
perceive the world around us.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, that is exactly my point. I also noted that I much enjoy your
&gt; &gt; &gt; B.S..  As with others on this board, you have a talent for pounding on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the keyboard.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My sense is that we live in a box and can only guess as to what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside of the box.  Inside the box, we create our own reality and
&gt; &gt; &gt; when examined, the &quot;we&quot; that creates is as mysterious as that which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside of the box.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The concept of wrong, isn't wrong.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's just another concept.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as the thought that one would be better off not to think about

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We speak of words and ideas as things that we assimilate and use.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From what then did time evolve?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time manifests timelessly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The timeless loves time, so to speak, including all beings in and of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, yet itself not a being and timeless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is the timing of time, hence all that manifests manifests exactly

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in which the perceiver is the perceived.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence is not divided from anything that is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence neither is nor is not, but includes all that is, and

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All noise is from and of this silence, because all that is, is of and

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is excluded from this silence that one is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All qualities are from and of this, which has no quality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that is named is from and of this, which is nameless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that has location is from and of this, which is nonlocal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One is this silence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, the observer is what is observed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I observe noise, I am the noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the stillness which allows the noise to be known as noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence we can speak of, is not the same as the silence which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond our knowledge, which is our very being, of which we have never

Yes, again I agree with you Gary, see the new post on &quot;True Truth?&quot;.

You do bring up, or allude to another concept or acutality called by
some as &quot;The Absolute.&quot; This is a bit of a 'sticky wicket' kind of
topic though. Nothing can be said about it, and some relegate it to
the realm of 'belief' while others profess an understanding or non-
conceptual experience of this non-experience.

A topic best left for another thread 'me thinks matey,' but even
though it can't be expressed in words and can't be understood in
concepts or the intellect, doesn't mean that it is only a false belief
or imaginary notion.

Very few saints/sages/regular joes talk about this which cannot be
spoken of or conceived, but it kind of does fit into your box analogy.
The box being consciousness, or knowledge, meaning all that we know or
that can be known, and outside of the box is that &quot;prior to
consciousness&quot; or the silent stillness from which &quot;I Am&quot; raises it's
head. It can't be known, but it knows all. To look for it or think
about is to make it seem distant from oneself.

Stop thinking and stop talking about it and all becomes clear. -

seems to me it can be known - is known - and,is talked about
plenty.what can't be done is to describe it,as it does the
describing.the box is the box,with no outside to the outside,no inside
to the inside.silent stillness is just the box,boxed in...not able to
get either inside or outside...away from.the sense of is the of
sensing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From what then did time evolve?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time manifests timelessly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The timeless loves time, so to speak, including all beings in and of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, yet itself not a being and timeless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is the timing of time, hence all that manifests manifests exactly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when, how, and as it is to manifest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The manifest and the unmanifest are not divisible.  This you behold
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now, is the unmanifest, given qualities by your own act of perceiving,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in which the perceiver is the perceived.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence is not divided from anything that is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence neither is nor is not, but includes all that is, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; includes all affirmations and negations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All noise is from and of this silence, because all that is, is of and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from this silence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is excluded from this silence that one is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All qualities are from and of this, which has no quality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that is named is from and of this, which is nameless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that has location is from and of this, which is nonlocal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One is this silence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, the observer is what is observed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I observe noise, I am the noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the stillness which allows the noise to be known as noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence we can speak of, is not the same as the silence which is

Ram:

I was going to reply to Rodger's post, but I prefer just to enjoy the
word play.

The Absolute...

My ego stands tall and assures me that it can handle the deciphering
of that subtle experience of silence.  Now, this silence is different
than the nothingness of sleep and it has some sort of substance to it,
but seeming inactivity.  Ego says that this is the subtle indicator of
a non-changing.  The Ego says that this actually ties into how the
manifest is structured.  It underlies all and is all.  Well, there is
no experience of the absolute.  If I can state that I experience
silence, or I am the silence, then it is an experience in
manifestation.  My intellectual pride tells me that I can know what is
behind the curtain, but this time the damn dog doesn't pull the
curtain away.  The wizard remains a mystery...if there is a wizard.  I
suggest that those that say that they know are suffering from
intellectual pride.  Yes, there is the subtle experience, but to say
more is folly...fun..but folly.

With intellectual pride,
Gary

&gt; You do bring up, or allude to another concept or acutality called by
&gt; some as &quot;The Absolute.&quot; This is a bit of a 'sticky wicket' kind of
&gt; topic though. Nothing can be said about it, and some relegate it to
&gt; the realm of 'belief' while others profess an understanding or non-
&gt; conceptual experience of this non-experience.

&gt; A topic best left for another thread 'me thinks matey,' but even
&gt; though it can't be expressed in words and can't be understood in
&gt; concepts or the intellect, doesn't mean that it is only a false belief
&gt; or imaginary notion.

&gt; Very few saints/sages/regular joes talk about this which cannot be
&gt; spoken of or conceived, but it kind of does fit into your box analogy.
&gt; The box being consciousness, or knowledge, meaning all that we know or
&gt; that can be known, and outside of the box is that &quot;prior to
&gt; consciousness&quot; or the silent stillness from which &quot;I Am&quot; raises it's
&gt; head. It can't be known, but it knows all. To look for it or think
&gt; about is to make it seem distant from oneself.

&gt; Stop thinking and stop talking about it and all becomes clear. -

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well Ram.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is my point..

&gt; &gt; &gt; This board has thousands of posts.  We have creation/manifestation/
&gt; &gt; &gt; mind/ego/self-realization discussed and then discussed some more.  My
&gt; &gt; &gt; posts from the last two weeks are attempting to suggest to board
&gt; &gt; &gt; members that all of this is unknown, except for the sense of being
&gt; &gt; &gt; aware.. the sense of I am.  The rest is just a belief structure and
&gt; &gt; &gt; the mind defining.  The whole Advaita thing, when discussed, is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; belief structure, conceptual framework, or we could call it a
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy/religion.  It isn't any more valid than any other
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy, except for that basic sense.  Perhaps this is stating the
&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious.  Certainly it is stating the obvious for many of the regular
&gt; &gt; &gt; participant.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My sense is that we live in a box and can only guess as to what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outside of the box.  Inside the box, we create our own reality and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when examined, the &quot;we&quot; that creates is as mysterious as that which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outside of the box.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; belief structure, conceptual framework, or we could call it a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy/religion.  It isn't any more valid than any other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy, except for that basic sense.  Perhaps this is stating the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dan:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Evolution implies time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From what then did time evolve?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time manifests timelessly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The timeless loves time, so to speak, including all beings in and of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, yet itself not a being and timeless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is the timing of time, hence all that manifests manifests exactly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when, how, and as it is to manifest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The manifest and the unmanifest are not divisible.  This you behold
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now, is the unmanifest, given qualities by your own act of perceiving,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in which the perceiver is the perceived.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence is not divided from anything that is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence neither is nor is not, but includes all that is, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; includes all affirmations and negations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All noise is from and of this silence, because all that is, is of and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from this silence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is excluded from this silence that one is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All qualities are from and of this, which has no quality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that is named is from and of this, which is nameless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that has location is from and of this, which is nonlocal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One is this silence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, the observer is what is observed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I observe noise, I am the noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the stillness which allows the noise to be known as noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence we can speak of, is not the same as the silence which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond our knowledge, which is our very being, of which we have never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spoken.

RE: Post #28...how subtle is a blank?

If I can state,I can state my state.I can state I experience.I can
state I am my experience.

Experience in manifestation? Experience manifested.

All that can be experienced is the absolute,intellectual pride or not.

I experience(suffer) the silence of my own experiencing,and that is
absolute.

&gt; The Absolute...

&gt; My ego stands tall and assures me that it can handle the deciphering
&gt; of that subtle experience of silence.  Now, this silence is different
&gt; than the nothingness of sleep and it has some sort of substance to it,
&gt; but seeming inactivity.  Ego says that this is the subtle indicator of
&gt; a non-changing.  The Ego says that this actually ties into how the
&gt; manifest is structured.  It underlies all and is all.  Well, there is
&gt; no experience of the absolute.  If I can state that I experience
&gt; silence, or I am the silence, then it is an experience in
&gt; manifestation.  My intellectual pride tells me that I can know what is
&gt; behind the curtain, but this time the damn dog doesn't pull the
&gt; curtain away.  The wizard remains a mystery...if there is a wizard.  I
&gt; suggest that those that say that they know are suffering from
&gt; intellectual pride.  Yes, there is the subtle experience, but to say
&gt; more is folly...fun..but folly.

&gt; With intellectual pride,

&gt; &gt; You do bring up, or allude to another concept or acutality called by
&gt; &gt; some as &quot;The Absolute.&quot; This is a bit of a 'sticky wicket' kind of
&gt; &gt; topic though. Nothing can be said about it, and some relegate it to
&gt; &gt; the realm of 'belief' while others profess an understanding or non-
&gt; &gt; conceptual experience of this non-experience.

&gt; &gt; A topic best left for another thread 'me thinks matey,' but even
&gt; &gt; though it can't be expressed in words and can't be understood in
&gt; &gt; concepts or the intellect, doesn't mean that it is only a false belief
&gt; &gt; or imaginary notion.

&gt; &gt; Very few saints/sages/regular joes talk about this which cannot be
&gt; &gt; spoken of or conceived, but it kind of does fit into your box analogy.
&gt; &gt; The box being consciousness, or knowledge, meaning all that we know or
&gt; &gt; that can be known, and outside of the box is that &quot;prior to
&gt; &gt; consciousness&quot; or the silent stillness from which &quot;I Am&quot; raises it's
&gt; &gt; head. It can't be known, but it knows all. To look for it or think
&gt; &gt; about is to make it seem distant from oneself.

&gt; &gt; Stop thinking and stop talking about it and all becomes clear. -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All noise is from and of this silence, because all that is, is of and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from this silence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is excluded from this silence that one is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All qualities are from and of this, which has no quality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that is named is from and of this, which is nameless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that has location is from and of this, which is nonlocal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One is this silence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, the observer is what is observed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I observe noise, I am the noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the stillness which allows the noise to be known as noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence we can speak of, is not the same as the silence which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond our knowledge, which is our very being, of which we have never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spoken.

One doesn't experience manifestation.

Experience manifests.

Experience fluctuates.

Ideas about the absolute occur within experience.

Therefore, ideas about the absolute, fluctuate, begin, and end.

Ideas about the absolute are transitory.

Knowing is experiential.

Outside of experience, other than experience, nothing is or can be
known.

The only absolute that can be known, is an idea that occurs within
experience.

Experience manifests.

The unmanifest, which one is, is not known, and not experienced.

Nonetheless, the manifest cannot be, and is not, other than the
unmanifest.

Thus, knowing is not knowing.

The known is unknown.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Very few saints/sages/regular joes talk about this which cannot be

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mumblings, but it seems that no proof can be offered.  Everything that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we speak of is based upon some basic unproven belief.  As previously
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested, the usefulness of the pointers is really the only value
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered in any of these discussions.  I can tell you that all is one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because all appears in consciousness and is dependent on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness.  Of course, I'm assuming that when I fall asleep that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the illusory world also sleeps.  Once again it seems to me that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neo-Advaita stuff is just another belief system.  For me, it is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; belief system that I find useful in my everyday life.  Ultimately, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pointed out many times by many members, there is just a undefined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functioning prior to thought.  Undermining the sense of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual's mind/ego through some basic pointers has some value to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the seeker, but then again, who makes such an offer of help and who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receives the pointers?  Bob makes all of this stuff simple by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggesting that 'nothing is wrong if you don't think about it'... The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual is happy and suffers.  Such is the outer play.  Once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identity is no long fascinated with this roller coaster life, then the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outer apparent happiness/suffering/unexamined beliefs are no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; binding/blinding, but the outer play continues..until it doesn't and

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is where I get lost.  Yes, all pointers fail, but I don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand where this one came from.  Is there an experience of seeing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this silence evolve into sound, but yet remain silence?  I have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense that I can see the space that permeates what eyes see.  I can't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; describe the sense and in the telling it becomes another story.  As
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subjective as this experience may be and however off-base my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation of what is seen may be, it still forms some misguided

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Evolution implies time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From what then did time evolve?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time manifests timelessly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The timeless loves time, so to speak, including all beings in and of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, yet itself not a being and timeless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is the timing of time, hence all that manifests manifests exactly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when, how, and as it is to manifest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The manifest and the unmanifest are not divisible.  This you behold
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now, is the unmanifest, given qualities by your own act of perceiving,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in which the perceiver is the perceived.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence is not divided from anything that is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence neither is nor is not, but includes all that is, and

the unmanifest which one is,is only half the story.the other half
which one is,is the manifest.

thus,not knowing is the known unknown.

the unknown is known.

There aren't any halves.

Except when you take out a measuring tape.

But you can never measure from where the entire experiential moment
comes, which includes you and your measuring tape.

Thus, there aren't any halves.

&gt; &gt; Ideas about the absolute are transitory.

&gt; &gt; Knowing is experiential.

&gt; &gt; Outside of experience, other than experience, nothing is or can be

&gt; &gt; The only absolute that can be known, is an idea that occurs within

&gt; &gt; Experience manifests.

&gt; &gt; The unmanifest, which one is, is not known, and not experienced.

&gt; &gt; Nonetheless, the manifest cannot be, and is not, other than the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; word play.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Absolute...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My ego stands tall and assures me that it can handle the deciphering
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of that subtle experience of silence.  Now, this silence is different
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the nothingness of sleep and it has some sort of substance to it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but seeming inactivity.  Ego says that this is the subtle indicator of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a non-changing.  The Ego says that this actually ties into how the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifest is structured.  It underlies all and is all.  Well, there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no experience of the absolute.  If I can state that I experience
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; silence, or I am the silence, then it is an experience in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifestation.  My intellectual pride tells me that I can know what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behind the curtain, but this time the damn dog doesn't pull the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curtain away.  The wizard remains a mystery...if there is a wizard.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest that those that say that they know are suffering from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intellectual pride.  Yes, there is the subtle experience, but to say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more is folly...fun..but folly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You do bring up, or allude to another concept or acutality called by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some as &quot;The Absolute.&quot; This is a bit of a 'sticky wicket' kind of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; topic though. Nothing can be said about it, and some relegate it to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the realm of 'belief' while others profess an understanding or non-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conceptual experience of this non-experience.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A topic best left for another thread 'me thinks matey,' but even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though it can't be expressed in words and can't be understood in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concepts or the intellect, doesn't mean that it is only a false belief
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or imaginary notion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very few saints/sages/regular joes talk about this which cannot be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spoken of or conceived, but it kind of does fit into your box analogy.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The box being consciousness, or knowledge, meaning all that we know or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that can be known, and outside of the box is that &quot;prior to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness&quot; or the silent stillness from which &quot;I Am&quot; raises it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head. It can't be known, but it knows all. To look for it or think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about is to make it seem distant from oneself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stop thinking and stop talking about it and all becomes clear. -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; members that all of this is unknown, except for the sense of being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aware.. the sense of I am.  The rest is just a belief structure and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind defining.  The whole Advaita thing, when discussed, is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; belief structure, conceptual framework, or we could call it a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy/religion.  It isn't any more valid than any other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy, except for that basic sense.  Perhaps this is stating the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obvious.  Certainly it is stating the obvious for many of the regular

That's right,Dan...no halves.The unknown is known,the known is
unknown...the entire experiential moment doesn't come from where...is
you and your measuring tape trying to measure some where from where
you came.

&gt; Except when you take out a measuring tape.

&gt; But you can never measure from where the entire experiential moment
&gt; comes, which includes you and your measuring tape.

&gt; Thus, there aren't any halves.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The only absolute that can be known, is an idea that occurs within

&gt; &gt; &gt; Experience manifests.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The unmanifest, which one is, is not known, and not experienced.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nonetheless, the manifest cannot be, and is not, other than the

&gt; &gt; &gt; The known is unknown.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My ego stands tall and assures me that it can handle the deciphering

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mumblings, but it seems that no proof can be offered.  Everything that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we speak of is based upon some basic unproven belief.  As previously
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested, the usefulness of the pointers is really the only value
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered in any of these discussions.  I can tell you that all is one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because all appears in consciousness and is dependent on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness.  Of course, I'm assuming that when I fall asleep that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the illusory world also sleeps.  Once again it seems to me that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neo-Advaita stuff is just another belief system.  For me, it is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; belief system that I find useful in my everyday life.  Ultimately, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pointed out many times by many members, there is just a undefined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functioning prior to thought.  Undermining the sense of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual's mind/ego through some basic pointers has some value to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the seeker, but then again, who makes such an offer of help and who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receives the pointers?  Bob makes all of this stuff simple by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggesting that 'nothing is wrong if you don't think about it'... The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual is happy and suffers.  Such is the outer play.  Once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identity is no long fascinated with this roller coaster life, then the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outer apparent happiness/suffering/unexamined beliefs are no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; binding/blinding, but the outer play continues..until it doesn't and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the eyes shut for the last time.

Hey Rodger --

The tape is the measurer.

Thus, the measurer can't be measured.

All that is observed, is the observer, the &quot;measurement&quot; which goes by
such names as &quot;the working of one's own mind&quot; and &quot;one's own
perceptions.&quot;

If one is no-mind, one knows without knowing anything, including this.

Nice post Dan, very clear.

Dot

From: Dan

One doesn't experience manifestation.

Experience manifests.

Experience fluctuates.

Ideas about the absolute occur within experience.

Therefore, ideas about the absolute, fluctuate, begin, and end.

Ideas about the absolute are transitory.

Knowing is experiential.

Outside of experience, other than experience, nothing is or can be
known.

The only absolute that can be known, is an idea that occurs within
experience.

Experience manifests.

The unmanifest, which one is, is not known, and not experienced.

Nonetheless, the manifest cannot be, and is not, other than the
unmanifest.

Thus, knowing is not knowing.

The known is unknown.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My sense is that we live in a box and can only guess as to what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outside of the box.  Inside the box, we create our own reality and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when examined, the &quot;we&quot; that creates is as mysterious as that which is

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The concept of wrong, isn't wrong.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's just another concept.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as the thought that one would be better off not to think about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things, is just another thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We speak of words and ideas as things that we assimilate and use.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is it that we can't assimilate, and therefore can't use?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mumblings, but it seems that no proof can be offered.  Everything that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we speak of is based upon some basic unproven belief.  As previously
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested, the usefulness of the pointers is really the only value
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered in any of these discussions.  I can tell you that all is one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because all appears in consciousness and is dependent on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness.  Of course, I'm assuming that when I fall asleep that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the illusory world also sleeps.  Once again it seems to me that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neo-Advaita stuff is just another belief system.  For me, it is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; belief system that I find useful in my everyday life.  Ultimately, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pointed out many times by many members, there is just a undefined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functioning prior to thought.  Undermining the sense of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual's mind/ego through some basic pointers has some value to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the seeker, but then again, who makes such an offer of help and who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receives the pointers?  Bob makes all of this stuff simple by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggesting that 'nothing is wrong if you don't think about it'... The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual is happy and suffers.  Such is the outer play.  Once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identity is no long fascinated with this roller coaster life, then the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outer apparent happiness/suffering/unexamined beliefs are no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; binding/blinding, but the outer play continues..until it doesn't and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the eyes shut for the last time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is where I get lost.  Yes, all pointers fail, but I don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand where this one came from.  Is there an experience of seeing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this silence evolve into sound, but yet remain silence?  I have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense that I can see the space that permeates what eyes see.  I can't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; describe the sense and in the telling it becomes another story.  As
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subjective as this experience may be and however off-base my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation of what is seen may be, it still forms some misguided
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basis for suggesting that space permeates all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Evolution implies time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From what then did time evolve?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time manifests timelessly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The timeless loves time, so to speak, including all beings in and of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, yet itself not a being and timeless.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is the timing of time, hence all that manifests manifests exactly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when, how, and as it is to manifest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The manifest and the unmanifest are not divisible.  This you behold
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now, is the unmanifest, given qualities by your own act of perceiving,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in which the perceiver is the perceived.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence is not divided from anything that is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silence neither is nor is not, but includes all that is, and

that's left,Rodger...and what's left is right.

If something's left, the tapir will snort it up ...as the tapir has a
short, prehensile snout - right?

http://images.google.com/images?q=tapir&amp;hl;=en&amp;client;=firefox-a&amp;channe...;

The tapir lets snorting taper off to not snorting.

But the tapir with sleep apnea isn't able to let snoring taper off to
not snoring.

Unless, maybe, he's been reading some of our brilliant repartee.
