openSUSE Updater has been running alright upto now but when I allowed it to
install todays updates I got the following error. Has this corrupted
anything? and if so how do I fix it?

Yes I see something similar.  Seems some repo's aren't functioning at this
moment.  Usually when this happens it is quickly repaired though.

3 or 4 of the many repo's I have on my install list failed..

Just wait a while..maybe a few hours.

P.S.  Could be any number of things..perhaps they're updating the servers
right now.

Yes... there was a change.  I just picked a hardcoded update area for now.
Sigh... we really need to figure this stuff out.

SUSE 7 slow updates
SUSE 8 slow updates
SUSE 8.1 lightning fast updates
SUSE 10.1 whoops
SUSE 10.2 whoops part 2
SUSE 10.3 found something slower than SUSE 7 updates

It takes about 1 minute to even list the patches.  All the

I agree with Nikos.  It seems to me that there is a real problem
here.  As the repositories get larger and larger, it takes longer
and longer to download the indexes and longer and longer to &quot;clean&quot;
what is on my machine.

This is independent of my connection which can range from a direct
internet connection (i.e. I have a permanent IP number) at work to
good old wireless &quot;b&quot; mode on my portable.  They are all slow.

And now with the flexibility of multiple repositories, each of which
forces cache updating and each having a varied response time... well...
it just makes the problem worse and worse.

Granted, back in that 8.1 - 10.0 period, we still had pretty much
the SUSE-only repos (except for guru and packman which made
YOU compatible repos).  Good times and lightning fast updates....

The new (10.2+, not necessarily counting Zen) thing just reminds of the
pains of what we had to endure back in the version 7 days.  And it
wasn't fast then no matter what &quot;some&quot; might say.  Which is why it
started to be fixed in 8.0 and ultimately was pretty much fixed in 8.1.

The Debian derived system that Ubuntu use suffers from other problems
(problems mainly caused by trying to support all versions of all things
in all combinations... which is pretty much impossible).

You forgot 10.0.  I stayed on it as long as I could because of the
borked package management in later versions.

I don't know what houghi thinks is fast, but compared to 10.0 the
current system is a joke.  10.0 wasn't great - still took more time than
using apt on my Debian sandbox at work, but it was tolerable.  This
updating this/cleaning that etc. is nuts.

Not to mention quality control.  I installed Timidity and while it
works, the pull down menus just display square boxes.  The rpm was built
by some fellow in Japan, so I'm guessing the menus are in Japanese but I
don't have that language set enabled so just see squares.

I read the other day someone suggesting to use a DNS type system.  That
makes a lot of sense to me.  Heck, the RBLs use it to track countless
thousands of spam messages - surely it could easily handle a couple
thousand application versions...

I agree about the package management bugs following 10.0 but cannot say I
actually tried the fixes--10.0 was where I got off the SuSE bus, in terms
of actively installing it.

Also, in my readings, it seems to me some bugs in many package management
schemes are introduced by the &quot;independent&quot; sites (especially for what is
possibly illegal in some jurisdictions, like video codecs). Same for what
turns out to be mysterious tarballs some download and try to install with
little regard for their package management system requirements.

That is for sure one of the problems.
Guys often use any kind of software source, and then tarball or rpm with

I think these are two different issues.  One issue is the time
it takes to even see a list of updates presented.  The other is
the quality or nature of the packages to be downloaded.

There is a limit to how much openSuSE can do about the latter.

Guess you could say I'm running semi-automatically.  The updater in the
kicker lets me know when there are updates but I install them manually.
But even if I did automatic updates, the system would have to query the

That's a tired old canard.  It implies that anybody using open source is
qualified, interested, or has the time/inclination to be a hacker.  I
mentioned two approaches:  apt, which is a proven technology, and
something based on a DNS type approach.  I don't know if anybody is
exploring the latter but it does wonders with RBLs, SPF, etc.  Not to
mention, um, DNS. &lt;g&gt;

I've never met anyone one the development team.  Nor do I have the
development background to seriously contribute to it.  I presume that
the development teams participates in the 'greater SUSE community' to
some degree, i.e., they keep their ears to the ground to get a sense of
how things are working out.  But maybe they don't.  Maybe they have
their own little list server or forums and don't care what the
experience is like for us mere mortals.  That would explain a lot.

I've always liked SUSE.  For the most part it's what I want.  There are
enough things goofy in 10.3 however that make me inclined to try other
distros.  Maybe they do it better.  So far I'm not wild about Debian
(except for apt - it works a treat).  But maybe Ubuntu will work, I
dunno.  They seem to be listening to consumer feedback at any rate,
judging from their widespread adoption.  Or maybe I'll try them and
decide they're not for me.  The long and short of it is that we settle
for what works best for us, but doing so doesn't mean we abdicate the
right point out the flaws.

Yup.  We wait for things to get fixed by people that know how to fix
them.  When my pipes burst I wait for the plumber.  When my car breaks I

Research SPF - it uses text entries in DNS to list authorized email
servers.  Something similar could possibly be done by having an
equivalent to an A record, or TXT record.  The system could do a 'zone
transfer' to pull down the whole list of software and do a diff against
a locally stored list perhaps, or a line by line query maybe.  That is,
my system has a list of installed packages and it just does a lookup of
the current revision.  If the master file has a serial number like DNS
it could look at that and see whether or not any new updates have even
been released.  In an instant one could compare the revision level of
the repos to what I've already downloaded.

I just know on my Debian system I enter 'apt-get update' an 15 to 20
seconds later the list is updated.  Refreshing the repos on 10.3 takes
several minutes.  10.0 was slower than Debian, but still leaps and
bounds ahead of 10.3.

As a matter of fact, last night I reported the timidity problem on
Bugzilla.  And while you don't have to be a hacker or coder to do so, it
was a convoluted process.  Had to create an ID.  OK, no biggie.  Entered
a username, and password, then logged in.  Got to some bugzilla page
that said I had to validate my new account. EVERY other account I've
ever created via the web emailed me a 'reply to this to activate your
acount' message.  But not the Novell/SUSE bugzilla system.  I had to go
track down the right web page, and request that the system email me an
invitation to activate the account.  That is totally convoluted.  Why
don't people participate more?  Maybe because of the roadblocks they
encounter.  I can't blame them for saying 'screw it' half way through.

&gt;&gt; Bugzilla has other advantages. You can see how far they are with
&gt;&gt; solving the problems and enhancements.

&gt; Yes, that is an advantage of using it.

&gt;&gt; If you say that you do not like what they are doing, that is fine with
&gt;&gt; me. However if you say (or imply) that they do nothing then I know that
&gt;&gt; you are lying and can't even bother to do do any investigation yourself.
&gt;&gt; No problem with that either, except for the part where you insult hard
&gt;&gt; working people.

&gt; The former.  I'm saying that they did better in the past and I don't
&gt; like what they've done lately.  I stayed on 10.0 until it was out of
&gt; support because of the pain they introduced with red carpet stuff.  I
&gt; know they work hard - I never said they do nothing.  And I don't lie.  I
&gt; may make mistakes.  But that's different.

&gt;&gt; Have you even tried looking up what the development team is doing? And
&gt;&gt; no, I am not going to point you in the right direction. I want to see
&gt;&gt; wether you are seriously interested or just do the easy thing and blame
&gt;&gt; everything on other people and keep telling that the grapes are to sour.

&gt; My computer is just a tool.  When I go out in my woodshop, I expect my

Yes and there are already some ideas of solving this, whithout the

that needs to be checked is huge. Also the amount of programs to choose
from is a bit exploded. :-D

Obviously there are other things that need to be considerd to keep

That is another thing that one talking about Software management being slow
should have in mind.

I know that if I have only official oss, non-oss, and update repositories
enabled, where only update has to be refreshed, management runs very fast,
but as soon as I enable Build Service and external repositories everything
looks lesser rosy. Each of additional repositories must be refreshed and
that takes time.

Currently I is set zypper to refresh after 60 minutes
in /etc/zypp/zypper.conf though it was reset to default 10 minutes with
last zypper update :-)

I can't really follow discussions on yast-de ... @opensuse.org and
zypp-de ... @opensuse.org, but it seems that they are very busy on new
solutions that will handle multiple repositories faster, automatically.

Now, one has to type:
zypper install -r &lt;repository&gt; &lt;package&gt;
to refresh only one repository.

It's also nice to be able to hold off on an update too.  You may or may

/etc/alternatives was full of broken sym links, and it took me several
hours to manually fix them.  I wish I'd read here that the java update
was broken - it would have saved me a lot of trouble.

Although I still got bit, at least with manual update selection one has
the chance of preventing such problems.  You've been here long enough to

It is up to the developers to make that difference and they have stated
that they ather have a lot of background noice then miss one bug. Just
after openSUSE.org started they had 3 times as many bugreports and they
were happy about it. As long as you can produce a reasonable bugreport,
they will be happy. Oalso if you have a bugreport stating just &quot;It does

Turns out that both my bugs are now fixed on my system, at least.  To
fix the timidity problem, I had to add the xorg-x11-fonts package.  30
mb of fonts.  Sure glad I'm not on dialup.  Takashi Iwai (the developer)
had me look for 100dpi fonts.  Didn't have any.  Apparently they aren't
installed by default but that's what his menus use.  After I installed
them, the menus displayed properly.

I don't know what they'll do to fix the general problem - either add the
fonts as a prerequisite to timidity, or recompile with 76dpi fonts or
maybe something else.  But that's out of my hands.  We'll see what they
actually do for the fix.

I like the old 5 disk approach to SUSE.  I expect they don't install the
fonts by default now because of the size/download time.  When they're on
a local disk that's not an issue.  But, of course, disks cost money as
does their ISP feed.  Much cheaper to have folks downloading just what
they need rather than 5 ISOs full of programs that won't get installed.

The other problem, audacity segfaulting  was really easy to fix but not
to solve: ( https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=354349 )

As I mentioned, they closed it as a WONTFIX because the package was from
packman and appeared to be a problem with audacity.  It wasn't.  Turns
out that simply adding myself to the audio group was all it took.  Sigh.
I don't know if zypper or yast can check/enforce group membership as a
condition of installation (like dependencies) but if it can, it should
add the users when the program is installed, or at least mention in the
description in yast that membership is needed to run the program.

So all in all, the developers indirectly put me on the right track for
fixing timidity although didn't actually provide me with the fix, and
haven't yet committed a fix in bugzilla, and weren't able to give me any
guidance on the audacity fix.  But at least they know about it now and
that may help someone else down the line.

Since bugzilla pages don't show up in google, etc. I expect if anyone is
helped the likelihood is they'll read it here than there.  But maybe in
11.0 the developers won't make the same mistakes.  We'll see...

Why Kevin?

Many of openSUSE developers fix the bugs only as a part of their job, not
hobby. There are projects where some of them are involved on their time and
that is where they take care of bugs anyway.

WONTFIX in this case means that no one is involved with 'audacity' and what
they fix in such case are only opensuse packaging problems. For the package
that comes from Packman that is third party they can't use company time, as
you can imagine ;-).

This depends on what the enhancement is and how the question is asked.
However it does not make it 'trickier' to post something that isn't a
bug. Just saying 'it doesn't work' or 'it needs to be faster' will most
likely be shot down and rightfully so.

Sometimes however very strange ideas might evolve into something
completely different, yet something that will work. Also sometimes some
things are easier to implement then you would think.

e.g. the seperation of / and /home and how that is devided. That
discusion was done on the mailinglist, because I thought that it would
give a HUGE discusion. It didn't. Also the discusion on how large each
partition was going to be was much easier then expected.

So the conclusion is: A 'no' is for certain, a 'yes' is a possability.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Then that should be a reason to re-open it, although I would first try
the solution (using the factory) to see if that helps. If not, then it
might be something different. Just be sure that you do not use the
Packman things, otherwise you might be trying a problem that can not be
re-produced.

They are only human and can only do so much in a certain time. That is
what Alpha and Beta is for, so others can look it up. So perhaps
somebody running Alpha for 11.0 can try it out and see if they have the
same issue.
