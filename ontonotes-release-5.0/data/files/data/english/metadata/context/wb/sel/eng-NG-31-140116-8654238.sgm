I'll begin with Lua because as you might recall, I've been high on this
kid since the draft. He started at the Mike next to Alexander and he
keeps getting better and better. Was solid in coverage, sheding blocks
and plugging the gap. Still a bit rusty when it comes to play
recognition, but for a rookie, he's very solid at a position and in a
scheme that took even a seasoned vet like Ted Johnson some time to get
used to. Unfortunately, he suffered what looked to be a serious knee
injury. After today's showing, I think he would have made the team
outright, but given the injury, I think he's on IR. But even after
getting injured, he popped right back up and hopped off the field
on-legged. Tough, tough kid and you have to feel for him because he
really did have a solid camp.

&gt;NFL.com seems to indicate that Evans isn't doing so well carrying the rock,
&gt;and that Mills is hauling in some short passes.  How about Cassel?  How does
&gt;Britt look at LT?
">

OK, I've been giving Britt the benefit of the doubt just because Dave
and JD were so high on him, but at this point, the guy pretty much
sucks. Got Cassel killed on one play and really didn't do much else with
the first unit. Though Oldenberg played against scrubs, he fared much
better at LT, has that &quot;mean streak&quot; and finishes off his blocks. I
really think it's time for the Pats to cut Britt loose and give
Oldenberg his reps so he'll develop faster.

Cassel looks very solid. He made some nice throws and is much more at
ease directing the offense.

Mills also had a solid showing, proved that he's a very solid lead
blocker when opening up holes for Evans as a FB, can catch the ball as a
TE and thus showed his versatility. After today's showing, I'm not sure
if there's room for Rivers, and this is a shame because he too has had a
very solid preseason including tonight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And on D, the big question is the backup secondary.  Meriweather and Andrews
&gt;especially.  What can you guys say?
">

Meriweather played like a first rounder and it's clear his natural
position is FS. I'd have to say, his play tonight was the most
encouraging because he can cover and lay some wood in run support. He
was pretty much all over the place and even had a very nice open field
tackle as a gunner on teams inside the 10 I believe. Andrews was ok, but
Mel Mitchell will give him a run for his money. I'm not sure why
Mitchell didn't play more than a handful of snaps with the first and
second units.

Woods had his best game of the preseason and is a better player coming
off the weak side rather than going against LTs. Alexander was also very
solid though he started off sluggish and slow tonight, and Rogers keeps
getting into the backfield to pressure QBs.

Finally, the DLine scrubs look very solid. Tonight, it was Santonio's
time to shine. The DLine is one of BB's tougher decisions given the
solid, consistent play of all the scrubs.

Tough to hear.  Looks like I jinxed the team last week when I mentioned the
relative lack of injuries.  Since then, Richardson is gone after showing
lots of promise and now (maybe) Lua.

I was also very hopeful about Britt, especially when you look at the size of
the guy.  But I wasn't too impressed last year, and the final straw was when
he got bowled over at RT in one of the games (forget which one).  It
indicated that he wasn't clear on the snap count and didn't know how to
compensate for it.  I don't usually see a guy literally get pushed on his
ass off the snap as easily as he did.

At this rate, maybe there's room for both of them.  Neither Thomas nor Brady
appear to be ready for the opener.

Sounds like good news.  Lots of options in the front seven.  How about James
and Wesley at corner?

Very true, and once Thomas and Brady get back to health, Evans, Mills or
Rivers might be dinged up. Either way, despite the early half of
preseason, we're now solid at TE and Mills is the HB that came as
advertised when we first drafted him.

I didn't notice James. Not even sure if he played. Wesley looked pretty
good in a couple of passes he defended and was generally around the ball
even in run support. But then, the Giants O, beginning with their first
unit, is pretty average to put it politely.

&gt;One thing tho, is he's running around wearing cement shoes.  That guy is
&gt;slow as shit.

Agreed and speed is not this thing although he has enough of it to stay
with TE in coverage. Also, I think at this point, he looked even slower
because he was going through a check-off list in his head as plays were
unfolding, which in turn made him seem slower in reaction to plays. He
got better with this as the games wore on though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I like what I've seen from Meriweather.  One thing that concerns me
&gt;though, I forget the exact quotes but I saw an interview w/ him
&gt;the other day where he seemed somewhat upset about playing CB.  Perhaps
&gt;I was reading too much int oit.  Also, FWIW, the PFW in progress crew
&gt;were nothing that he seems a bit sullen/loner in the locker room.
">

That's interesting. I would have never pegged the kid as the loner/type
A personality sort. Still, I think the kid'll fit in well with all the
great vets around him and as he makes more and more plays.
