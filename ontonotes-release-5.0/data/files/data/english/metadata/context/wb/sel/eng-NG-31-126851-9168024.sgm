Excerpt: The ironies of gender politics in India get more serious
treatment in Thomas Wartmann's Between the Lines. The documentary
follows photographer Anita Khemka, whose ambition of comprehending the
alien lives of Mumbai's hijras may appear presumptuous but is
ultimately endearingly compassionate. The kind of connection she
manages to establish with the hijras, and the intimate access through
which the film permits us to know the characters, testifies to the
capacity of documentaries to reveal the power of human empathy.

Moustaches, warts and all

Documentary film festival brings vivid realities to the silver screen

DIWAS KC &amp; A. ANGELO D'SILVA

From Issue #369 (05 October 07 - 11 October 07)

Whoever thinks that art, entertainment and politics don't co-mingle is
only going to be disgruntled by looking at the contemporary film
scene. Even the biggest Hollywood houses have been unable to stave off
the allure of 'current affairs' in recent years. But whereas the
mainstream keeps on with tentative, wishy-washy innuendos, documentary
films have set off a global movement with a watchful, moral authority.

Home-grown film festival Film South Asia, which this year brings an
assortment of 48 documentary films, is part of that movement. There is
a wide selection, and the festival directors have made sure that the
sundry joys and miseries of the South Asian experience are adequately
represented.

One not to miss is a highly moving and exquisitely made documentary by
Helene Klowdawsky, No More Tears, Sister: Anatomy of Hope and
Betrayal, which chronicles the life of the brave Sri Lankan activist
Rajani Thiranagama. An unwavering commitment to human rights and a
definite disillusionment with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) probably caused her assassination in 1989.

Through sensitive enactment (Rajani's role is portrayed by her
youngest daughter) and deeply personal testimonies, the film traverses
both the private tragedies of Rajani's family and the public scars of
Sri Lanka's ongoing civil war. The story of Rajani, particularly her
relationship with her radical sister Nirmala Rajasingam, is a
heartrending account of how the world-shaking optimism of the 1960s
New Left succumbed to brutally narrow nationalisms and ethnic
struggles.

There's a sense of that betrayal in Syed Ali Nasir's documentary The
Miseducation of Pakistan, which wisely begins with Jinnah's cautionary
words about the importance of education in independent Pakistan and
then plunges into the deplorable state of contemporary public schools.

The statistics come fast and heavy and the organisation is messy, but
the message of the utter disarray, mismanagement and corruption that
plague most of the public school system is made abundantly clear with
some excellent footage and reportage. Admirably, the filmmakers still
seem to hold steadfast to the indispensability of public schools. And
the film delights with plenty of delicious scenes of politicians
squirming at the pointed questions of our reporter, Naziha Syed Ali.

A very different film, Moustaches Unlimited is a charming, irreverent
entry from Kolkata. Made by Vasudha Joshi, the film is an assemblage
of interviews, opinions, poetry and story that explores the stubborn
legacy and allure of the eponymous facial feature of men and some
intrepid women. Somehow both celebratory and satirical, Moustaches'
exploration of the male body politics is amusingly illuminating. It
will take the bushiest of moustaches to hide the grins that this film
elicits from its audience.

The ironies of gender politics in India get more serious treatment in
Thomas Wartmann's Between the Lines. The documentary follows
photographer Anita Khemka, whose ambition of comprehending the alien
lives of Mumbai's hijras may appear presumptuous but is ultimately
endearingly compassionate. The kind of connection she manages to
establish with the hijras, and the intimate access through which the
film permits us to know the characters, testifies to the capacity of
documentaries to reveal the power of human empathy.

And such instances of insight and genuine empathy are what Film South
Asia promises with its packed roster of documentary films.
