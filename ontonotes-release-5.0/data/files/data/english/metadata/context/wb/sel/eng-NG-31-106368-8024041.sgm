Yeah! Not much longer either. Sleepless nights anyone? Heartburn? Tired

Yeah. Not that much longer. August 22nd, I have milk with a due date
further away than that.
The miss is helping me out with my posture by pushing her behind into my
ribs and letting me know that's it's staring to get crowded &quot;in there&quot;.
Every Friday evening I have my Yoga and Birthing Class and it's
definitely the highlight of my week right now.
Sleep is happening, but still/again with lots of interruptions, I guess
she's training me for her arrival.
Baby won't ever have her own room in this house, but right now she
doesn't even have a corner! there's still a table to move out and a
changing station to set up, but at least the clothes are mostly sorted
out and clean. The stroller/pram/whatever you may call it is still up in
the attic and won't come down until at least another month, and I
haven't got a car seat either.
Does anyone want to recommend their favorite brand of cloth diapers? Or
their favorite pattern to sew them myself? I still have some time on my
hands ;-)

The water retention seems to be under control and except for one day
last week when I was feeling so dizzy I couldn't walk straight (and went
into hospital to get checked out) I'm doing ok *knockonwood*. We went to
a street festival/fair today, and after three/four hours of walking and
watching (and going on one ride) I definitely felt she was about to just
fall out of me. She's super low and I have plenty of BH contractions (I
guess that's what it is anyway, never had them with Sam. Belly goes hard
and feels uncomfortable).

The weather's pretty good to me, some hot days and then it cools right
down again so I get my breaks from the heat with rain and wind. Another
50 or so days. I can't believe how fast it's going!

Well, it's almost 1 a.m. and my alarm won't spare me tomorrow. Another
few pages of my book and hopefully that'll switch me off for the night ;-)

I'm just starting to panic a bit about preparations, nothing ready, all

Hehe, I keep telling myself &quot;6-10 weeks&quot;. But today I'm hoping for 6.

I know. I have a small box of clothes and I'm slowly washing them and
getting them ready and I'm worrying that I may not have enough. But then
I think &quot;How long is she really going to fit the newborn stuff?&quot; And
remind myself that I can always get more onesies if it comes to that.

Now, if only I could decide on cloth diapers... With Sam I had those
knitted ones you fold and tie and there's no way I'm using them again. I
hated them. Well, I hated washing them, because they'd always end up one
huge tangled lump, no matter what I did with the ties.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's one of the main reasons I want to stay home. Sam was out so fast
I'm thinking I won't have time to find someone to watch him and someone
to drive me to hospital and stay there with me. Much easier to send him
to my brother (he lives right behind us and we share a yard, so it's not
like he'll have to walk a long distance or anything) and call the
midwives and my friend. And if we do have to transfer for whatever
reason he's going to be fine with my brother and I won't have to worry
about anything.

It's so strange, I never ever had them with Sam. And now I'm having them
all the time, they started real early, too. Months ago, really. So I'm
hoping my womb is all practiced out and ready to birth that baby once
the time comes ;-)

I know! Sam always asks &quot;When's the baby coming, how much longer&quot; and I
keep thinking &quot;Oh honey, it's ages still. More than 100 sleeps&quot; and now
we're down to something like 50 and I don't know where those last 50
went and I'm getting kind of scared that the remaining 50 will just
evaporate as well.
I mean, I know I can just order the car seat online and it'll be here in
a day or two. Same with cloth diapers, except via ebay they might take a
week, but I &quot;inherited&quot; a bunch of disposable diapers from my neighbour
because her baby doesn't fit them anymore, so it's not that big a deal.

And for the first weeks I can change her on my bed as I don't plan on
running around much anyway. (In german the week after delivery is called
&quot;Wochenbett&quot; which translates to &quot;weekbed&quot; and my midwife last time told
me &quot;That's because you're spending that week in bed. Bonding and nursing
and sleeping when baby sleeps. You're allowed to leave the bed to use
the bathroom. Or possibly to eat. But that's it.&quot; ;-) suited me fine
because between the bleeding and Sam nursing pretty much around the
clock I didn't feel like going anywhere anyway.)

But I'd still like to have my bedroom ready for baby before she arrives
;-) Maybe I can make my guests for the next weekend help me move things
*cough* just to build up their appetites for the bbq of course ;-)

It's gotten awfully quiet here since I had Sam... But it has been 7
years and a lot of people I know don't &quot;do&quot; Usenet, they rather use
forums... You know, there's more colors and you can have pictures and
it's more clicky... ;-)

take care!

Nope, I'm here as of last night. I used to lurk here ages ago when I
got the baby bug but DH wasn't ready. Then I decided to focus on other
areas of my life, stopped BCP due to lack of insurance, and didn't do
so well on FAM, so here I am! :) I don't know why I haven't been here
since I found out on Christmas (month of denial), but I'm here now.

I've had a pretty fantastic PG...not much discomfort to speak of, and
any discomforts I have I hate to complain about considering what many
women go through. I've also been quite fortunate in the weather. I'm
in Dallas, TX (USA) and the past 2-month period has been the rainiest
on record, keeping temps down a little...woo hoo! But humidity and
the mosquito population have been high....yuck. The mosquitos have
actually just come back from a blessed absence.

Getting up to pee frequently at night and some slight achiness in the
hip and/or knee of the  lower leg when on my side are really my only
complaints, and I'm trying to sleep with my  upper leg on 1 or 2
pillows as per Bradley, but it's a pain when I turn over to my other
side after a pee trip. Oh well. I'm a nanny Mon-Thurs to a 13 month
old and a preschooler and still have to carry the 23-pound toddler
upstairs/downstairs at least 3 times a day, which isn't the greatst
thing, but it's exercise! And I can nap/put my feet up when the kids
nap, so that's VERY  good. And it's casual, so Ihaven't had to invest
much in maternity clothing, although I feel very dumpy in large
T-shirts!

I'm not ready to kick my boy out yet, still have plenty to do, esp.
around the house. I've been pretty lethargic lately, actually. In an
effort not to stress myself out, I'm ignoring a lot of stuff. ;) I'm
going to a group of CNMs at a free-standing birth center and just
started Bradley classes a couple weeks ago...I will make the last
class (Aug. 12)  if I don't go early. My LMP EDD is Aug. 8, but my u/s
said Aug. 16, which I am more inclined to believe.

I will definitely miss the fetal movement!

You might want to think about getting a nursing/body pillow. I got one
with my first and I still love it. I have it next to me in bed with most
of the stuffing in the bottom (Mine's stuffed with little poly-something
beads and you can kind of adjust where they go by pushing them around or
just lifting one side up) and my leg over it my belly against it in the
middle and the other end under my head.
But lately I've had to either go without it or pry it out from under my
son. He uses it like a kind of nest, in an upside down U shape with his
head on the curve of the U and the rest of him spread out allover the
place *lol*. I already joked I'll have to buy another one for him.

I think it's just the huge belly combined with the weather. If I could I

Yeah, that's one of the coolest things about pregnancy, isn't it?
Sometimes it drives me nuts, especially when I'm sitting down and madam
insists on pushing her butt up into my stomach and lungs and I have to
sit up ramrod straight to breathe, but when I lay down and just watch
the belly jiggle and bounce, that's so cool.

So - I'm 35 weeks now, I lost my mucous plug at the weekend, wasn't too
concerned about that I don't remember losing it last time and I know I
was 3cm and 70% for a couple of weeks then so figured it was just a sign
that things were starting.

Now a couple of days later, I'm having loose stool, backache and nausea.
No contractions and baby is moving fine, if a little aggresively.

The midwife said it could be a bug, drink plenty of fluids, take Tylenol
and if the backache doesn't go away in a few hours call her back.

Anyone have anything to add?

How bad would it be to have this baby at 35 weeks? I'm not wishing it by
any means, I want the babe to be ready for the world even if I'm ready
to be a little more comfortable.

35 weeks is pretty reasonable. Better if you can make it past 36 weeks but
35 will do. Certainly I've a friend who had a baby at 34 weeks and was out
of hospital within a week. Baby fine, never even went to scbu. Only problem
was the sucking reflex wasn't totally brilliant so they did some cup feeding
for the first couple of weeks. I think if it hadn't been for that they'd
have been out of hospital sooner.

Thanks Debbie, that's reassuring. The backache has gone as has the
nausea and diarrohea so I think it was a false alarm. I've had a quiet
word with the baby and hopefully convinced him to stay put for another
couple of weeks even though I know it's uncomfortable for us both.

Funnily enough, my midwife felt that 35 weeks was actually better than
36 weeks, her experience was that 35 week babies tended to be fighters,
they had the necessary reflexes in place and usually did pretty well,
but that 36 weekers for some reason got lazy, were more likely to have
jaundice and have difficulty feeding. I asked other midwives and they
all seemed to be in agreement.

It seems to be the time for that..

Saturday was a very active day for me, taking a long trip in the car,
walking around a fair bit,... I took a nap in the early evening (I think
around 5 or 6) and when I woke up about an hour later I was doing the
&quot;hip wriggling thing&quot; you know, where you kind of move your hips in a
figure 8 or a circle or something? I lay there thinking &quot;Well, last time
I did that I had a baby 5 hours later&quot; but I didn't feel any
contractions. I got up, drank a tall glass of apple juice mixed with
water and had some dinner and it finally went away.

Like you I was thinking &quot;Well, ok, we're obviously both not enjoying
this much, but still, could you hang on for a few more weeks?&quot;.

My midwife was here yesterday and I had glucose in my pee sample :-/ So
today I had the GD test (31 euros right out of my pocket. Thank you
german health system reform. Please pay for 50 ultrasounds when there's
an indication for it, but not for necessary tests that aren't so much
fun for the doctor!). I'll get the results tomorrow morning and then
we'll see about the home birthing plans :-/

Uh oh, stay in place vibes headed your way, although it sounds like it
wouldn't be the end of the world. :)

DH asked what was losing the mucous plug like (we covered that in our
last childbirth class!)? I can't fathom losing it at this stage. I
have had some loose stools with the accompanying cramps (def. feels
like gas pains, which I have a hard time with) but nothing else, thank
goodness. I have too much to do!

&gt; &quot;hip wriggling thing&quot; you know, where you kind of move your hips in a
&gt; figure 8 or a circle or something? I lay there thinking &quot;Well, last time
&gt; I did that I had a baby 5 hours later&quot; but I didn't feel any
&gt; contractions. I got up, drank a tall glass of apple juice mixed with
&gt; water and had some dinner and it finally went away.

&gt; Like you I was thinking &quot;Well, ok, we're obviously both not enjoying
&gt; this much, but still, could you hang on for a few more weeks?&quot;.

&gt; Funnily enough, my midwife felt that 35 weeks was actually better than
&gt; 36 weeks, her experience was that 35 week babies tended to be fighters,
&gt; they had the necessary reflexes in place and usually did pretty well,
&gt; but that 36 weekers for some reason got lazy, were more likely to have
&gt; jaundice and have difficulty feeding. I asked other midwives and they
&gt; all seemed to be in agreement.

My 35 weeker is certainly feisty, kicking me to bits inside, I don't
remember the movement being as strong or aggressive last time.

Thank you for your reassurance, I still have the achy back and the loose
stool but no contractions so hopefully he'll stay put for a couple more
weeks.

&gt;&gt;concerned about that I don't remember losing it last time and I know I
&gt;&gt;was 3cm and 70% for a couple of weeks then so figured it was just a sign
&gt;&gt;that things were starting.

&gt;&gt;Now a couple of days later, I'm having loose stool, backache and nausea.
&gt;&gt;No contractions and baby is moving fine, if a little aggresively.

&gt;&gt;The midwife said it could be a bug, drink plenty of fluids, take Tylenol
&gt;&gt;and if the backache doesn't go away in a few hours call her back.

&gt;&gt;Anyone have anything to add?

&gt;&gt;How bad would it be to have this baby at 35 weeks? I'm not wishing it by
&gt;&gt;any means, I want the babe to be ready for the world even if I'm ready
&gt;&gt;to be a little more comfortable.

&gt; Uh oh, stay in place vibes headed your way, although it sounds like it

I'm fine still hanging in there, feeling gargantuan, baby is low and
feels like the head is engaged. The midwife checked me 2 weeks ago and
said nope nothing happening, I'm hoping that has changed by now, it
certaily feels like it. I'm having contractions, like you, strong and a
little like the real thing but with no regularity and no pattern. I wish
I could crawl into bed when they happen but I'm still working and have a
2 1/2 yr old at home so there's no rest for me. I finish work on the 3rd
so plan to put my feet up for the duration after that.

I'm bigger than I was with my son, I have stretch marks which I didn't
have last time and it looks like my belly button might pop this time
too. I'm going for acupuncture and reflexology next week to see if I can
give theis babe a litle nudge. I know s/he won't come until s/he is
ready but a little nudge can't hurt - can it?

How are you? And the other August women?

I'm alone with Sam right now, my brother went to the States for his
summer vacation and possibly to flee from me and the prospect of having
to be with me for the labor *lol*.
It's so exhausting! I'm tired all the time and I caught some kind of bug
from Sam because we're both coughing like crazy.
Thursday is our &quot;horror day&quot; this week. In the morning we're going to go
to court and make our statements regarding visitation rights for Samuels
co-producer and in the afternoon my two midwifes will come over and
check out the &quot;location&quot;, so we're cleaning and tidying today.

My old stretch marks are starting to grow, too. I was hoping they
wouldn't, but no such luck :-/ Oh well.
I'm so ready to have this baby! I already told her that her deadline's
the 8th of August (the day I hit 38 weeks) and if she doesn't come out
herself I'll smoke her out, or I'll just kneel down and push her out and
I won't care if my cervix is ready or not, it'll be ready when I tell it
to be *lol*. I know that won't work, and isn't even a good idea, but
she's low and I have to pee all the time and I'm uncomfortable despite
this summer being really cold.
My parents are going to be here on Friday (oh joy... I can not wait...
*sigh*) and they'll take Sam with them on the first and return him on
the 8th. So I'll have a week to just hang out in bed and sleep drink and
eat. I hope.
I'll have to go to the city before they leave and buy some more fabric,
I'm planning to hand some of it to my mom so she can help sew diapers.
She's a lot faster than I am and a lot more accurate, too.
Then there's all the moving of furniture to do, my big desk with all my
sewing stuff and lots of baby stuff will need to be moved into Samuels
room and the changing table/dresser and a bookshelf will make its way
into my room.
My best friend will probably come up from Stuttgart during the week Sam
is away and bring the crib she's giving me, so by the time Sam's back
everything should be set up for the baby to arrive, too.

So yeah, that's the plan, we'll see how it goes *lol*

take care!

Looks like a plan to me. I finish work on Friday so will also have a

majorly pissed off about that and trying my best to avoid it, I'd like
to have a VBAC this time.

I know this has probably been done to death on this group but has anyone
had any success with &quot;natural&quot; induction methods?

By natural I mean non chemical, no pitocin or cervadil or anything like
that. I've had reflexology and am going for acupuncture tomorrow.

There's a good list of the possible methods here:

For my successful VBAC, I was 39w5d when my midwife stripped my
membranes. This started irregular contractions off and on for the next
couple of days. At 41w my midwife stripped them again (I had gone from
1 cm to 4 cm in those 2 days) and about 5 hours after stripping I was
in full blown labor. Baby was born 12 hours after that, no other
augmentation.
So I do think the stripping worked for us (we had also been having
sex, I'd been drinking RRL tea and using Evening primrose oil applied
to the cervix).

Note, I had membrane stripping with my first pregnancy (suspected
big baby) which may have led to premature rupture of my membranes
and thus a failure to progress and eventual c-section. I don't know
that
for certain, but it is what I think happened. That said, as I neared
41 weeks with DD2 I thought is was worth the risk.

Good luck!

Just found this after readign the thread change.

Per my LMD EDD, I'm almost 39 weeks, but think 38 may be more accurate
due to when I think the deed as done. In keeping with my easy
pregnancy, I feel like this lil' guy likes his current home just fine,
thankyouverymuch. And I'm cool with that, as is DH. I do think I've
been able to identify some BH contrax, although may times I think it's
just the baby pressing the front of my uterus. He is starting to
occassionally stretch out and in so doing, press on my bladder or
cervix; whichever one, it is not comfortable at all! But that is
pretty infrequently. It's been mentioned several times that I'm not
that huge, which I'm fine with, too. Fundal height was 38 cm Thursday,
so I'm not worried. So no waddle yet (I don't think), I just get a bit
achey at night sometims if I don't put my top leg over on a pillow.

I fininsh work tomorrow, which will give me much need time to do
stuff. My shower was yesterday, and my crib came in today. My step-mom
and -aunt are staying a couple of extra days to help clean this house
(which my DH and I didn't pick up enough, but oh well). We
switched/are switching  our home office/computer room with umpteen
computers/parts with our former guest room/future baby room. ILs
arrive in a week for perhaps a month-long stay (not all with us, thank
goodness!).

My mom I think is a bit impatient with us for not having a name
chosedn (and even if we did, we don't really want to tell). DH joked
about telling his mother (in England) that we would name the baby
Jacob Branston due to our love of cheese and crackers (Jacob's Cream
Crackers and Branston Pickle), so that is how the grandparents have
taken to referring to him. DH is dragging his heels on helping me
choose a name. :/

Overall, I'm great physically, just lethargic and waiting for that
burst of nesting energy! :)

actually, I heard one reported case of a women doing just that, I think
she was 32 weeks, definitely preterm, not her first child, she showed up
at the hospital, admitted she wasn't contracting and wasn't in labour,
but insisting on pushing and eventually the baby was born, I'm not sure
why they let her stat, I suppose they feared that she might ultimately
do some harm, and I think the placenta followed very quickly afterwards
(abnormal, possibly indicating an abruption shortly before the birth). I
think there may have been concern that the women had mental health
problems, but I don't think anyone acted to, say, have her sedated to
avoid the forced delivery, but then I don't think anyone thought she
would managed to force the delivery.

Be very cautious, all medical induction methods carry an increased risk
of uterine rupture, it may still be within your risk tolerance zone, but
there is a decreased chance of being sucessful in a vbac, have you
read kmom on the subject?
http://www.plus-size-pregnancy.org/gd/gd_index.html , there are
definitely times when a women with GD does need to be induced, but there
is little evidence to support it as a routine intervention.

There is always going to be anecdotal tales of it working, but they are
often when the women is well past 40 weeks and would have a high chance
of going into labour anyway. Personally, I think the chances of actually
getting it to work at 38 or so weeks is pretty slim, but that should
induction really be necessary, that there are things you can do to be as
ready for it as possible, such as evening primrose oil capsules on the
cervix, which do similar things to cervadil, but at a much slower pace.

Do you know about Bishop's score? it's a measure of a number of things
such as engagement, dilation, position and texture of the cervix and the
score adds up to be a reasonable predictor of whether induction will
work or not. I've had a 37 week induction, due to IUGR and PROM, which
is notorious for being a long drawn out process, but my Bishop's score
was high and the induction was much smoother than many are well past dates.

The biggest problem that I think you'll have with an early induction is
that most need repeated applications of cervical ripening things
(cervidel and others), but that really increases the risk of uterine
rupture, I know it's not something I'd be comfortable with, but if it's
pitocin only, with a low Bishop's score, it's also not very likely to
suceed, there does, in my mind come a point where it's better to plan a
c-section than to have a moderate chance of having an emergency one, but
your thresholds may be very different to mine.

&gt;&gt; idea, but she's low and I have to pee all the time and I'm
&gt;&gt; uncomfortable despite this summer being really cold.

&gt; actually, I heard one reported case of a women doing just that, I think
&gt; she was 32 weeks, definitely preterm, not her first child, she showed up
&gt; at the hospital, admitted she wasn't contracting and wasn't in labour,
&gt; but insisting on pushing and eventually the baby was born, I'm not sure
&gt; why they let her stat, I suppose they feared that she might ultimately
&gt; do some harm, and I think the placenta followed very quickly afterwards
&gt; (abnormal, possibly indicating an abruption shortly before the birth). I
&gt; think there may have been concern that the women had mental health
&gt; problems, but I don't think anyone acted to, say, have her sedated to
&gt; avoid the forced delivery, but then I don't think anyone thought she
&gt; would managed to force the delivery.
">

Oi. Well, that gives me hope ;-) Honestly, I was feeling a lot better
the past few days, even with this weird cough, but last night was &quot;no
sleep night&quot; I was either coughing or having to pee or both (yeah, see
the pregnant lady run...) and when I finally fell asleep again Sam woke
up an hour later, luckily he went to grandma, so I was able to go back
to sleep, for about 30 minutes before some idiot rang my doorbell but
was of course gone by the time I got there.. So now I'm semi awake and
can't go back to sleep. Love it.

Sorry, I just need to vent a little, I have heartburn and I can't bend
down because I feel like I'll throw up when I do that, my kitchen is a
huge mess, but emptying the dishwasher's no go because of the bending
over and I'm feeling pretty disgusting even though I've just had a
shower.. I just hope the next weeks go by quickly and uneventful.

Thanks Anne, I have read kmom, it's a priceless resource.

I just had a biophysical profile this morning, they estimate the baby to
be 9lbs at 37.5 weeks. I know there is a margin of error with this(10%?)
and the bigger the baby the bigger the margin, but it has unnerved me
somewhat and I'm thinking more about an early induction than I was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I know this has probably been done to death on this group but has
&gt;&gt; anyone had any success with &quot;natural&quot; induction methods?

&gt;&gt; By natural I mean non chemical, no pitocin or cervadil or anything
&gt;&gt; like that. I've had reflexology and am going for acupuncture tomorrow.

&gt;&gt; There's a good list of the possible methods here:
&gt;&gt; http://www.maternitycorner.com/mcmag/articles/preg0007.html

&gt; There is always going to be anecdotal tales of it working, but they are
&gt; often when the women is well past 40 weeks and would have a high chance
&gt; of going into labour anyway. Personally, I think the chances of actually
&gt; getting it to work at 38 or so weeks is pretty slim, but that should
&gt; induction really be necessary, that there are things you can do to be as
&gt; ready for it as possible, such as evening primrose oil capsules on the
&gt; cervix, which do similar things to cervadil, but at a much slower pace.
">

Thanks, I started EPO and am hoping it will help.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Do you know about Bishop's score? it's a measure of a number of things
&gt; such as engagement, dilation, position and texture of the cervix and the
&gt; score adds up to be a reasonable predictor of whether induction will
&gt; work or not. I've had a 37 week induction, due to IUGR and PROM, which
&gt; is notorious for being a long drawn out process, but my Bishop's score
&gt; was high and the induction was much smoother than many are well past dates.

I'd heard of it but didn't know much about it. I just found this
http://mother-care.ca/bishop.htm

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The biggest problem that I think you'll have with an early induction is

My midwives will only use pitocin with a previous section, they don't
like the gels in general it seems. They did encourage me to use EPO and
are very supportive of me trying for a VBAC, it's me that is losing

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I know it's not something I'd be comfortable with, but if it's

&gt; c-section than to have a moderate chance of having an emergency one, but
&gt; your thresholds may be very different to mine.

That's kind of where my mind is going now. I feel a little defeated but
a healthy baby is my goal, how I get there is secondary.

Thank you for your thoughtful and considered response, I'm sure others
will find it as informative as I did.

The margin is actually bigger than that.  Quite a few studies
considered late term u/s estimates of fetal weight *accurate* if the
result was within 10 percent either way, but they were only &quot;accurate&quot;
(by that definition) something on the order of 50-75 percent of the
time.  So, up to half the time, they don't even hit it within 10
percent.

Another thing to keep in mind, though, is that *YOU*
have some control over how and when you make your decisions.
For instance, it's not plan a c-section in advance or labor
until you're beyond exhausted and then finally cave in to the
c-section and try to recover from it with no reserves left.
You can decide that you want to go into labor naturally and
labor only as long as you're feeling optimistic about the
outcome, but decide to go to a c-section well before it's
an emergency or you're completely wrung out.

Best wishes,

There is no evidence to support that early induction improves outcomes
with a potentially large baby, induced labours in general just seem to
be more difficult, extended, more likely to need epidural, more likely
to need assisted delivery and so on, if you could just flick a switch
and have a normal labour, just a bit earlier in time, then likely it
would improve outcomes, but you can't, you might have a slightly smaller
baby, but to get the chance to delivery that, you have to take on a
whole host of other things, that don't improve anything and may even
hinder. Size is a factor in delivery, but not as much as many people
will have you believe, size alone doesn't tell you what shape your baby
will be and what dimensions are contributing to the weight, you could
have a long baby with a small head, or a short baby with a big head.
Position of the baby is exceedingly important, you don't want to go
inducing a baby who's not in a good position to be born, of course they
might turn in labour, but they might not and then you're in the
operating theatre having you ability to birth undermined yet again.
Estimated birth weights are almost always too big, you'd think that the
formula would get changed, but as yet, that hasn't happened, people used
to say the estimate was upto a pound out either way, but now it seems
people are saying up to 2lb too high, so the baby could be a very normal
7lb right now. What do your midwives say regarding the weight, I'm sure
I read somewhere that they are more accurate than machines, but the most
accurate is a mother who has had a baby before, so what do you think?
The other thing to note is how much babies put on in the last few weeks,
the text book answer is 1/2 pound per week, but many people have
observed that this doesn't always seem to be the case and baby might be
putting on that much from 34 to 38 weeks, but then slows down, it
probably varies from person to person.

I'd noticed that there seems to be less use of the gels in the US, I
don't understand the reasons why, it's irrelevant for you, but I know
that in the UK, they are very big on using gels and this means an early
induction for GD can be very time consuming, 3 days or so, with repeat
application of gel, but then whilst the c-section rate in the UK is not
great it's a lot lower than in the US and I think there is plenty of
evidence that supports a higher success rate with use of gels, I wonder
if it's the different health care systems that make it not favourable
for many doctors in the US.

I don't know your history and I don't have a crystal ball, so I've no
way of knowing whether or not you can birth this baby vaginally, but I
honestly think the best chance you have it to await natural labour. The
only reason I'd accept for induction in this situation is that the baby
is at a high risk of death - and then I'd be questioning if there was
time to attempt induction. Anyone suggesting that induction will improve
your chances, they are talking hogwash any intervention at all chips
away at the chance of success, including things that can be seen as
fairly benign, such as artificial rupture of membranes.
