(Subtitled: What is about eBay that brings out the MC Ogre?)

&lt;steps up on soapbox&gt;

No wonder foreigners laugh at us so much.  As a whole, we are a nation
of infinitely stupid, white trash sub-humans.  Every time I read
something like this I want to puke.  I really wish I could afford to
live somewhere else.  This is fucking Gimme
Gimme/Money-Grabbing/Consumerism Rules/No-Education-Redneck Heaven.
Sometimes eBay itself makes me puke, even as I'm bidding on some nice
sunglasses or an obscure Cibo Matto boot.  It is so full of fucktard
opportunists who would put their mother up for bid if they thought they
could get something for her.

Never mind that the item in question this time is one our favorite
abominable jokes, the just-like-Sonny Crocket-drove-on-Miami Vice
"Daytona Spider Convertable".  It's how little regard the seller has for
his own ability to express himself that leaves me stunned and amazed,
and ashamed.

There are some other interesting things to see there, in the general
listing, but a lot of it is absolute shit that makes me disgusted to be
an American.

C'mon, some of you lurkers who never say a word, or you others who
apparently get such a laugh out of us that you repost AAF on your web
sites - let's hear it!  All you LL-Bean-wearing, in-the-woods-living,
smug-bastard flag-wavers with more kids than you need!  You "I'm going
to put yet another ribbon on my Kia Sedona so I can Support Our Troops,
because John next door put one on his Toyota Siena minivan", sheltered,
civilized-but-thoroughly-uneducated amassers of goods sleepwalking
through your lives - with more kids than you need!  You
colored-rubber-bracelet-wearing sheep!  Tell me why I'm wrong!   Tell me
to get the fuck out!  Tell me why you think it's so great to be an
American when we're really one of the great destroyers on this planet,
led by a madman who is plainly committed to continually putting our own
citizens in danger because of his bellicosity and yet, at the same time,
his cowardice.  Let's go, you who are willing to put one cheating,
stealing idiot in office after another, all the while saying we have the
best political system in the world!  ENGAGE!

Or, don't engage.  Give something back for awhile instead of
concentrating on the next Viking range you're going to put in your new
kitchen at the new house in Irvine.  Get involved in some activism, like
I do, in my case against illegal immigration.  Do some volunteer work,
and I mean several hours per week instead of per month.  I'm lucky
enough to be able to work 20 hours a week at an animal shelter, trying
to give peace and love to cats who were thrown into the street by
various examples of the above.  Give up a couple of Macanudos or
Starbucks and instead donate to a mission or a rescue shelter.  Find a
cause and work with it.  Practice birth control or get yourself tied
off.  Get to know the kids you have a little better, so you don't have
to do so when they're in jail.  Put your fucking money where your mouth is!

And buy a goddamned dictionary!  You can get one at a thrift store for a
buck.  Loser.

&lt;steps down from soapbox, ducking thrown free-range brown eggs, blood
oranges, Dixie beer bottles and Skoal cans&gt;

Boy, that felt really good!!  I mean, you can only talk about Ferraris
for so long.

That'll get us some new posters ...

I've tried to mellow a bit.  The real factor is the absolute
insignificance of the popular vote, the total lack of influence we have
on anything.  That pisses me off, though the larger and more powerful
the country the less the general populace can do about anything.

In many of William Gibson's sci-fi books/stories, the Japanese are the
most powerful country in the world, controlling most industries,
research, and financial markets.  America has gone back to mostly an
agricultural supplier to the world, the industrial nucleus mostly
rotting wreckage intruding upon an agrarian landscape - with a LOT less
people.  I would be all for that, as long as there were still a few
Ferraris and some open road around.

Plus, Bush the Inept has done almost nothing to curb illegal
immigration, because the more of them that become citizens, the more
chance he has to capture their vote and/or their support for his
platform.  He may not be up for re-election again, but I'm betting the
next Repub candidate will likely be his handpicked moron.

On top of that, he's all over reducing mental health benefits, along
with other public health benefits and even Medicare.  Meanwhile, illegal
immigrant women come here and drop babies that are American citizens as
soon as they pop out.  And they suck up benefits that they shouldn't be.
For those things alone he can kiss my ass.

(Sorry, Tiger, but all I ask is that they become citizens and speak our
language.  Stop shutting out America so they can have their own private
Mexico right here in the States.  They're earning here illegally and not
even plugging most of that income back into the American economy; they
send it back to Mexico.  That sucks.  Those that are against that
approach being un-American in my eyes.  Besides that, you don't have to
believe my views and are fully allowed to retort any way you want.  What
I've tried to do since I moved here is get rid of the overt racism, the
epithets and the hatred.  That doesn't do anybody any good.)

I never gave them a thorough checking out but I did like
all the stuff I heard from them.

Reading the word "Moonchild" always sticks the song of
the same name by Iron Maiden in my head. It's one of those
songs (the whole "Seventh Son of a Seventh Son" disc really)
that reminds me of a certain time in my life. A much more loose,
carefree, yet very dark time in my life... I'm happier now by far,
but it was what it was...

Do you have any clue whatsoever what the statistics are for illegal

Of course I am. The thing is, I wouldn't stand there and let you spew

it's OK to rant in front of me here.

&lt;&lt; What I've tried to do since I moved here is get rid of the overt

So you're hoping to achieve a more subtle form of hatred? You set such
lofty goals for yourself.  Gods, Mikey, but you do disappoint me on

Sorry for the late reply.  I have to use Google groups.  I don't know
how this is going to post.  We're switching ISPs and it's taking a few
days for the new one to get me the pertinent details while the door has
already hit the other one's ass on their way out.

Tiger, I can indeed produce numbers.  The activist group for whom I
volunteer would be delighted to do so.  Though I'm not chickening out
on that (if you really want to see them I'll get them, why not just
accept that I can) I'm getting tired of instigating arguments like this
only to get roasted by people who cling to some kind of view of
America-as-ambrosia/nirvana/whatever when it comes to our immigration
policies.  It DOES NOT MATTER that "all our ancestors were immigrants
once, Mike".  That does not apply now.  LOOK AROUND YOU.  Go to Santa
Ana, go to Moreno Valley, go to San Diego County, Brownsville Texas,
etc. etc. ad nauseum.  If you tell me you like what you see there is
something deeply wrong with your eyes.  If you tell me that welfare and
public assistance benefits are not being misdirected to people who do
not have SS cards, or who drop babies in this country so that they can
be US citizens and claim those benefits to use for the whole family, I
don't know what to say.  I will repeat this, though.  Hispanic (any)
immigrants who come here to be American citizens, who are willing to
learn our language - I don't care how they get here - are welcome in my
mind, welcome to anything our country makes available to those who need
it.  They can keep their culture, whatever, I don't care about that if
they just make an effort to assimilate even a little bit.  I would
think that would take care of your particular issue with my rants,
Tiger, but apparently it does not.

Maybe you'd like to read the article TODAY'S LA Times about the
Hispanic real estate agent (or whatever he is) who is going around LA
and Riverside counties courting Hispanic illegal immigrants to show
them how to buy homes without having to have a Social Security card.
That is disgusting, it is illegal, and I almost puked when I read it.
How anybody anybody could defend that and still think they're a proud
American citizen is just dead wrong.

At the same time, I know 1) there is, again, a personal issue here that
I have no right to keep twanging, 2) this is one of the more volatile
issues that doesn't belong in this group.  It sure as hell should not
be enough for us to turn on one another - there are lots of other
things for that - so I apologize for bringing that up again, and I
promise not do it again.  I noted the silence from most of you, and the
dearth of lurkers coming out to engage.  I don't remember what kind of
mood I was in when I wrote it.

I have the right to my own beliefs, even if I feel that they are rock
solid and everybody else thinks they're wrong.  But I do not have the
right to keep beating a dead horse under the guise of "flushing out
lurkers", when all I will do to them is get nasty.

So, once again I apologize to all.  Hate me if you like, but I said
what was on my mind and I probably won't stop doing that, but hopefully
I will someday learn not to do it here when I know it's a topic that
will upset and offend.

I fucked up.  Once again, spontaneous combustion falls apart under the
onslaught of superior intelligence.  But hey, at least you and Tiger
formed an alliance, however bitter.

One more time, I'm sorry I brought it up again.  But this is something
I feel very passionate about, it's a real problem, and you gift me with
the tin-hat bullshit?  Fuck off.  Both of you.

Out.

One of the saddest things about humanity (calm down Mike, I'm making
a general statement) is that even the poorest, most victimised and
alienated of people seem only too happy to pick out another poor,
victimised and alienated group of people to whom they direct very same
hatred that they have endured.

Oh well.

Spellcheck ??

Maybe you should try it moron.

I believe "Daytona Spider Convertable"   should be spelled "Daytona Spider
Convertible".

with an 'i' incase you still didn't catch your spelling mistake.

It's in quotation marks because the seller misspelled it,
not because the guy posting it can't spell. He's quoting
the misspelling to make his point.

Maybe he'll type it slower next time so you can understand.

I had a nicely prepared blast ready for you.  But I know for a fact you
are quite the amateur insulter and I've never admired much of what's
come out of your keyboard in your history here.

So, all I'm going to say is, they were TYPOS, everybody throws one or
two out from time to time, and usually when all any pussy can come up
with is a few bad words about typos it means they know they aren't shit,
as sure as they hide the shame that their real mother is their sister.
(Bad Dad, bad!)

That means you're really not worth my time so you just got saved four
paragraphs of blistering and yet intelligent spew, the kind of stuff I
can write like an origami master folds paper.  You couldn't lay words on
paper with skill if the very life of your mother ... er, sister ...
whatever, depended on it.  But you're just not worthy of my gifts, which
will be dispensed sparingly in here from now on after some of the very
words that put a bee up your ass upset some people who I actually like a
little bit.

Thanks for listening.  Come down to Arizona if you like and I'll give
you some writing lessons.  You need them.
