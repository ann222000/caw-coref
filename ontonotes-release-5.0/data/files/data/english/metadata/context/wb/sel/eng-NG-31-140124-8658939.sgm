By Michael Ash

One month removed from cutting Darnell Bing, their fourth-round pick in
the 2006 draft, the Oakland Raiders announced Saturday that they had
released defensive end Quentin Moses, their third-round pick in '07.
Moses was quickly claimed off waivers by the Arizona Cardinals, bringing
an official end to his brief career with the silver and black.

The team's decision to part ways with these players may ultimately prove
wise. Bing, for example, was cut again over the weekend, this time by
the San Francisco 49ers. But the Raider organization can't be happy that
it has essentially swung and missed on two valuable draft picks in
back-to-back years. When the Raiders released Bing in July, he was the
highest pick from the '06 draft class to have gotten cut. And as the
first pick in the draft's third round, Moses has become the highest
draftee from this year to get his walking papers.

Head coach Lane Kiffin tried to put a positive spin on the move,
pointing out that Moses' release shows the Raiders are truly selecting
the best overall players for the team, with no weight given to where
someone was drafted or how much he might have been paid. And while that
may be true, there can be no denying that whiffing on their third-round
pick is something of a black eye for his coaching staff.

&quot;There were some hard ones,&quot; Kiffin said of the roster cuts, &quot;and it
wasn't that a guy wasn't doing everything we asked. We wish great luck
to Quentin and we think he'll be a good player in this league. But at
the end of looking at all of it, we had other people that could help us
more.&quot;

One of the players Kiffin is referring to may be rookie Jay Richardson,
a defensive end taken in the fifth round. But even if Richardson turns
out to be a late-round steal, it doesn't entirely heal the wound that
was created by missing on Moses. Striking gold with a player in the
final rounds is certainly a positive development for any team, but it's
most beneficial when that guy's production is added to an already solid
class, not when it has to replace the lost potential of a wasted pick.

Making the Moses issue even more glaring is the fact that, barring
number one overall pick JaMarcus Russell finally getting his deal signed
in the next few days, only one of the Raiders' first three selections
from April's draft - second-rounder Zach Miller - will actually be on
Oakland's roster when its season begins Sunday. And examining the
Raiders' first-round picks in recent years opens up a whole new can of
worms.

After taking Michael Huff over Matt Leinart in 2006, a decision that
some in the Raider Nation have - to put it politely - come to question,
the last thing the team needed was another iffy selection at the top of
its draft. But with the re-emergence of a healthy Daunte Culpepper, it
may only be a matter of time before the decision to take Russell is
second-guessed by even the most hardcore Raider fans.

Oakland is undoubtably moving in the right direction in a number of
different areas, but the amount of shaky draft decisions being made may
be a cause for concern. Whether those decisions set the Raiders back is
something that can only be answered with time.

Kiffin said, &quot;at the end of looking at all of it, we had other people

He (Jay Richardson) clearly out-performed Quentin Moses in camp so Q-Mo
goes, So whats the big deal? All we're really talking about is a 5th

The Raiders have had draft miscues for the past two decades. That is
why they have only made the playoffs 6 times in 2 decades. The
Broncos, by the way, have made 5 Super Bowls in that time period.

Ah, idjutfootball365.slum. Â  Certainly these draft &quot;miscues&quot;
are only the Raiders. Â Why, I can't remember the last time I
listed first round draft busts just at quarterback for those
who were totally ignorant of the game of football. Â Wait,
maybe that was yesterday. Â  Certainly opening the field to all
positions and all rounds will make that list just a small bit
larger. Â I would detail the entire list, but you would have to
list the majority of those drafted in every year since the
draft began.

Perhaps a list of draft picks who outperformed those picked
higher than them would be a tiny list? Â  God knows keeping a
fifth rounder over a third rounder has never paid off.
Certainly keeping WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh, Round 7, Pick 204,
2001 could never make sense. Â A seventh round pick is a
seventh round pick after all. Â Adalius Thomas of the Ravens in
round six? Â Certainly a bust. Â Certainly that round six Brady
character in New England has been a drag on the team. Â They
have let quarterbacks who were picked higher in the draft go.
What a draft miscue THAT was! Â Zach Thomas in the sixth for
the Phish was sure a mistake.

This guy knows about as much about the draft as Bill Clinton
and George W Bush.

Yup... the days of keeping crappy players or locker room cancers on the

How many high profile Patriot players get cut because they don't fit the

&gt; &gt;&gt; One month removed from cutting Darnell Bing, their
&gt; &gt;&gt; fourth-round pick in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the 2006 draft, the Oakland Raiders announced Saturday that
&gt; &gt;&gt; they had
&gt; &gt;&gt; released defensive end Quentin Moses, their third-round
&gt; &gt;&gt; pick in '07.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Moses was quickly claimed off waivers by the Arizona
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cardinals, bringing
&gt; &gt;&gt; an official end to his brief career with the silver and
&gt; &gt;&gt; black.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The team's decision to part ways with these players may
&gt; &gt;&gt; ultimately prove
&gt; &gt;&gt; wise. Bing, for example, was cut again over the weekend,
&gt; &gt;&gt; this time by
&gt; &gt;&gt; the San Francisco 49ers. But the Raider organization can't
&gt; &gt;&gt; be happy that
&gt; &gt;&gt; it has essentially swung and missed on two valuable draft
&gt; &gt;&gt; picks in
&gt; &gt;&gt; back-to-back years. When the Raiders released Bing in July,
&gt; &gt;&gt; he was the
&gt; &gt;&gt; highest pick from the '06 draft class to have gotten cut.
&gt; &gt;&gt; And as the
&gt; &gt;&gt; first pick in the draft's third round, Moses has become the
&gt; &gt;&gt; highest
&gt; &gt;&gt; draftee from this year to get his walking papers.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Head coach Lane Kiffin tried to put a positive spin on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; move,
&gt; &gt;&gt; pointing out that Moses' release shows the Raiders are
&gt; &gt;&gt; truly selecting
&gt; &gt;&gt; the best overall players for the team, with no weight given
&gt; &gt;&gt; to where
&gt; &gt;&gt; someone was drafted or how much he might have been paid.
&gt; &gt;&gt; And while that
&gt; &gt;&gt; may be true, there can be no denying that whiffing on their
&gt; &gt;&gt; third-round
&gt; &gt;&gt; pick is something of a black eye for his coaching staff.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;There were some hard ones,&quot; Kiffin said of the roster
&gt; &gt;&gt; cuts, &quot;and it
&gt; &gt;&gt; wasn't that a guy wasn't doing everything we asked. We wish
&gt; &gt;&gt; great luck
&gt; &gt;&gt; to Quentin and we think he'll be a good player in this
&gt; &gt;&gt; league. But at
&gt; &gt;&gt; the end of looking at all of it, we had other people that
&gt; &gt;&gt; could help us
&gt; &gt;&gt; more.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; One of the players Kiffin is referring to may be rookie Jay
&gt; &gt;&gt; Richardson,
&gt; &gt;&gt; a defensive end taken in the fifth round. But even if
&gt; &gt;&gt; Richardson turns
&gt; &gt;&gt; out to be a late-round steal, it doesn't entirely heal the
&gt; &gt;&gt; wound that
&gt; &gt;&gt; was created by missing on Moses. Striking gold with a
&gt; &gt;&gt; player in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; final rounds is certainly a positive development for any
&gt; &gt;&gt; team, but it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; most beneficial when that guy's production is added to an
&gt; &gt;&gt; already solid
&gt; &gt;&gt; class, not when it has to replace the lost potential of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; wasted pick.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Making the Moses issue even more glaring is the fact that,
&gt; &gt;&gt; barring
&gt; &gt;&gt; number one overall pick JaMarcus Russell finally getting
&gt; &gt;&gt; his deal signed
&gt; &gt;&gt; in the next few days, only one of the Raiders' first three
&gt; &gt;&gt; selections
&gt; &gt;&gt; from April's draft - second-rounder Zach Miller - will
&gt; &gt;&gt; actually be on
&gt; &gt;&gt; Oakland's roster when its season begins Sunday. And
&gt; &gt;&gt; examining the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Raiders' first-round picks in recent years opens up a whole
&gt; &gt;&gt; new can of
&gt; &gt;&gt; worms.

&gt; &gt;&gt; After taking Michael Huff over Matt Leinart in 2006, a
&gt; &gt;&gt; decision that
&gt; &gt;&gt; some in the Raider Nation have - to put it politely - come
&gt; &gt;&gt; to question,
&gt; &gt;&gt; the last thing the team needed was another iffy selection
&gt; &gt;&gt; at the top of
&gt; &gt;&gt; its draft. But with the re-emergence of a healthy Daunte
&gt; &gt;&gt; Culpepper, it
&gt; &gt;&gt; may only be a matter of time before the decision to take
&gt; &gt;&gt; Russell is
&gt; &gt;&gt; second-guessed by even the most hardcore Raider fans.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Oakland is undoubtably moving in the right direction in a
&gt; &gt;&gt; number of
&gt; &gt;&gt; different areas, but the amount of shaky draft decisions
&gt; &gt;&gt; being made may
&gt; &gt;&gt; be a cause for concern. Whether those decisions set the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Raiders back is
&gt; &gt;&gt; something that can only be answered with time.

&gt; &gt; The Raiders have had draft miscues for the past two decades.
&gt; &gt; That is
&gt; &gt; why they have only made the playoffs 6 times in 2 decades.
&gt; &gt; The
&gt; &gt; Broncos, by the way, have made 5 Super Bowls in that time
&gt; &gt; period.

&gt; And still have yet to win one. Â (Or do you count those years
&gt; they egregiously cheated the cap just to get there as wins?)

Jealous much? The Broncos were underdogs against the Packers and won.
Then they repeated the following year. Quit being bitter because the
team that goes by &quot;The Mark of Excellence&quot; hasn't won a Super Bowl in
23 season, made it to one since, has managed to make the playoffs only
six times in a 20 year period.

As long as Senile Al is in charge, the Raiders will continue to reek
of suckage.

It's called what have you done for me lately. When the Raiders last
won the Super Bowl, most seniors in college weren't even born yet.

The Raiders not cheat? Ha ha ha. Now that is one. You are talking
about Team Stickum (Billenckoff and Lester Hayes are the Captains).
The team that would drench the field with water to slow down teams.

Have some bread with your whine.

Ah, the classical logical dichotmy, one of the favorite
fallacious logical arguments. Â Why the NFL has not elected to
strip the titles is a side issue having nothing to do with the
fact that the Donkos have never won a title without cheating.
See also The SanFrancisco 49ers. Â Do you really need to come
in here to prove your ignorance of the game of football? Â We
believe you. Â You know nothing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; team that goes by &quot;The Mark of Excellence&quot; hasn't won
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Super Bowl in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 23 season, made it to one since, has managed to make
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; playoffs only
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; six times in a 20 year period.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As long as Senile Al is in charge, the Raiders will
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; continue
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to reek
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of suckage.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Still clueless? Â Even with the worst few years we have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ever
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; had STILL one of the best winning percentages, still
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Superbowl rings, and still didn't cheat to get them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It's called what have you done for me lately.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Ah, then you mean the Donks have never won without
&gt; &gt;&gt; cheating,
&gt; &gt;&gt; the scheme is known, and Horseface retired so you have
&gt; &gt;&gt; absoluteky nothing to look forward to except baiting your
&gt; &gt;&gt; betters and an occasional asswhipping in the playoffs?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Understood. Next?

&gt; &gt; If they cheated then why hasn't the NFL stripped them of the
&gt; &gt; title?

&gt; Ah, the classical logical dichotmy, one of the favorite
&gt; fallacious logical arguments. Â Why the NFL has not elected to
&gt; strip the titles is a side issue having nothing to do with the
&gt; fact that the Donkos have never won a title without cheating.
&gt; See also The SanFrancisco 49ers. Â Do you really need to come
&gt; in here to prove your ignorance of the game of football? Â We
&gt; believe you. Â You know nothing.

The 49ers won most of their titles before the salary cap era, so how
are they cheating? Let's see your crybaby reasoning for that.

The Broncos won their titles fair and square. They played by
everyone's rules except the ones in the fantasy land in your head.

The Raiders were the king of cheaters when they were successful. Enjoy
the title of Raiders: World Champions 1984. You will be stuck with
that for a long time. Deniers always live in the past. It's not the
70's and 80's anymore. Even the Lions and Saints made the playoffs
more than the Raiders the last two decades.

This tool is really showing what an ignorant fuck he is.

I suppose he forgot the trade that the Raiders tried to make to get
Elway,
and the commish nixing the deal but allowing the Doinks to do the
exact same trade. Â What a fucking putz. Â Both the commish and El Ron
