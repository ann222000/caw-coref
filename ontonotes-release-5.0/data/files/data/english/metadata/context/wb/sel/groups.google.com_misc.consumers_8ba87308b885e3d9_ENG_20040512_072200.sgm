experience. I have a different hybrid, the 2004 Totyota Prius, which
is EPA rated at about 55 MPG. I average about 45 (was exactly 45.6
this morning, actually :)), and I do very little highway driving. On
the one highway trip I did take, I was getting 52 MPG.

It's lower than the EPA rating, but that's true for most cars. I
certainly never see the kinds of numbers Pete Blackshaw claims to get.

Gas mileage does vary depending on conditions, but there is &quot;public
record&quot; (you apparently consider a Google search to be sufficient
evidence of public record - thats fine) of complaints regarding the
EPA ratings and the actual mileage many owners are seeing. His claim
of low mileage is not conclusive evidence that he abuses his car,

dishonest. However you are free to draw your inferences about Mr.
Blackshaw's character, and up to point, you can share the opinion you
may have developed (careful not engage in reckless character
assasination of someone you have never even talked to).

The Wired article did report on how the EPA test procedure creates an
estimate of fuel efficiency - The estimates are not based on actual
mileage tests. The article further reports that the efficiency
estimating process is almost 20 years old and may need to changed for
hybrid cars.

I applaud the intent of most hybrid car buyers. They usually want to
reduce pollution - and they are not saving money doing it this way.
But I don't find the claims that gas mileage is not as good as
advertised to be unbelievable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the gas mileage he was hoping for was only a pipe dream. Honda's Civic
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hybrid is rated by the EPA to get 47 miles per gallon in the city, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; 48 mpg on the highway. After nearly 1,000 miles of mostly city driving,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Blackshaw was getting 31.4 mpg.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; It's not unusual for *any* car to get only about 2/3 the mileage that the
&gt;&gt; label says. I think our car is supposed to get about 23 mpg and it gets
&gt;&gt; around 15-16.

&gt; This conversation has come around here before. I consistently do a little
&gt; better than the EPA ratings mileage-wise. Mileage is highly dependent on
&gt; weather, terrain, and driving style. There's also the possibility that his
&gt; odometer is not functioning properly.

"/> I too have consistently obtained gas mileage that met or exceeded the
EPA estimates on every new car I have owned in the last 20 years.

A partial exception being my 1995 Explorer - partial because it did
meet the sticker mileage estimates when I bought it. The fuel
efficiency dropped by about 15% immediately after California
instituted significant gas formula changes. Three or four years ago I
burned three tanks of gas on trip around Oregon - the Explorer's
original efficiency came back after the first tank of &quot;Oregon gas&quot; and
dropped again after returning home.

I try not to think of myself as an &quot;above average&quot; driver (everyone
thinks they are an above average driver - is there anyone reading this
that doesn't.) But I do consciously drive my cars with fuel
efficiency and longevity in mind. I use my cruise control and resist
the urge to drive at excessive speed on the highway. I take my foot
of the gas pedal early when I see a need to stop ahead, I don't make
jack rabbit starts, I keep the car in good order. My Explorer has
187,000 miles on it today. I towed a small boat with it for a while
(still do, just not as often as I used) and I still managed to get
over 80,000 miles on the front brakes - twice. The rear brakes went
about 110,000. I just put the fourth set of tires on it a couple of
months ago - I got about 60,000 mile out each previous set. Though it
is starting to shows signs that expensive repairs are probably around
the corner, it has been a great, reliable vehicle. I credit much of
that to way it's driven.

My wife, on the other hand...well... lets say that I don't consider
the way she drives to be &quot;abusive&quot;... but she doesn't drive as
&quot;efficiently&quot; as I do. :-)

I briefly considered buy a Hybrid. The first Prius just didn't do it
for me, and the Insight was totally inadequate for my need. I am a
rather &quot;round&quot; guy... While I didn't at all find that my size made
the Insight uncomfortable - but if my best friend and I were to both
hop in, the car would exceed it's gross vehicle weight rating. There
are motorcycles with higher payload capacities than the Insight.

Then Honda and Toyota both admitted that even though they had higher
mileage ratings, Hybrids were not necessarily more cost effective than
their convetionally powered comparable models. (This was last year
when gas was less than a $1.50)... It would take the average owner 10
years to recover the higher initial cost of the car in gas savings.
Even with gas prices doubling - that return on investment takes 5
years.

Well OK. I might still be willing to spend an extra $5,000 or so on a
car that was more green.

But what about maintenance? How reliable is this more expensive,
ecofreak car going to be? Well I can expect a $2,000-$3,000 bill in
about 5 years to replace the batteries. Add that to the extra money I
am trying to recover through better gas mileage. And I suppose the
old batteries get recycled... or what happens to these old batteries
if they are not recycled?

I decided that this hybrid hype is just that. Hype. Good intentions,
and I am sure the idea will advance in the next few years to where I
will reconsider. But for now, I'll stick to conventional, yet modern,
vehicle propulsion.

The knowledge that the EPA numbers don't add up to real-world
experience is so astonishingly widespread as render his complaints
incomprehensible.

Having discovered how the specific systematic errors in those
corrections relate to hybrid electric vehicles, his complaint becomes
doubly curious as to Blackshaw's motivations -- he _knows_ where the
measurement errors come from.

He knows the errors come from the EPA, not Honda.

A lot of people don't realize the impact of serially compounding
inefficencies. Until i see otherwise, i see a normal systematic
efficiency calculation error which is probably being compounded by an
inefficient driver use profile.

His claim of such low mileage is novel and extraordinary -- it's not
asking too much to see some real, specific, actual numbers.

Maybe he's right -- Maybe Hybrid-Electric vehicles are a scam -- but i'm
not taking the word of a Wired article, a jpeg of a dashboard display
and a blog for it. He's got to provide data and an explanation, not
simply complaints.

&gt;&gt; Pete Blackshaw was so excited about getting a hybrid gasoline-electric
&gt;&gt; car that he had his wife videotape the trip to the Honda dealership to
&gt;&gt; pick up his Civic Hybrid. The enthusiastic owner ordered a customized
&gt;&gt; license plate with &quot;MO MILES&quot; on it, and started a blog about his new
&gt;&gt; hybrid lifestyle.

&gt;&gt; But after a few months of commuting to his job in Cincinnati,
&gt;&gt; Blackshaw's hybrid euphoria vanished as his car's odometer revealed that
&gt;&gt; the gas mileage he was hoping for was only a pipe dream. Honda's Civic
&gt;&gt; Hybrid is rated by the EPA to get 47 miles per gallon in the city, and
&gt;&gt; 48 mpg on the highway. After nearly 1,000 miles of mostly city driving,
&gt;&gt; Blackshaw was getting 31.4 mpg.

&gt; 31.4mpg is still very good milage. One of my neighbors has a Prius and
&gt; he's thrilled with it. He says the milage he gets is incredible and he's
&gt; even gotten involved in a social group of Prius owners that he found via
&gt; a web search.

"/> 31.4 is good mileage - but it isn't significantly higher than many
covnetional ecomony cars. Is it worth the initial cost difference?

&quot;Max&quot; started an offshoot of this thread claiming that Blackshaw was
less than forthright in his claims (though &quot;Max&quot; offers no more than
somewhat contrived inferences [IMO] that Blackshaw is lying).
&quot;Jennifer&quot; has noted that her hybrid gets less than advertised
mileage, but doesn't seem to be complaining. Different driving
conditions, perhaps.

But when it comes to being truthful, do you think some
jump-on-the-bandwagon hybrid car owners are going to admit they are
not getting what they expected? How many times have we seen car
threads where a particular model gets trashed by posters, but those
that own them always seem to come to their defense?

I am not saying that either side is automatically right about the
quality or performance of a particular car, but I think most people
will deny whatever they buy is a POS, even if it is. Likewise, the
alleged POS will have a chorus of detractors that base thier opinions
on &quot;a freind of mine had one and it ate his son&quot; kind of anecdotes. A
recent thread bashing Hyundais is a great example.

Most Hyundai owners like myself don't brag about their cars - but we
don't think they are pieces of crap. But there will be a gaggle of
Honda owners that claim to be intellectually superior because they
chose to spend more money on an Accord. Justifications for spending
more money... better resale value... last longer... whatever. When
you do the math, it's damned near a wash in the of the car's useful
life. Yeah the Accord is a better built car than than Sonata - but
that doesn't mean that it is the right fit for everyone or that the
Sonata is a piece of shit.

For these reason, I don't expect hybrid buyers that lean toward having
a holier-than-hummer attitude to jump up and admit their cars are not
performing as well as they expected.

&gt; I'm curious as to why you take pleasure in the misfortune of someone who

&gt;&gt; http://www.wired.com/news/autotech/0,2554,63413,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1

&gt; I read the Wired article, and nowhere did the article discuss Mr.
&gt; Blackshaw's driving/use profiles. Not one word about how he uses or
&gt; abuses his vehicle, just a lot of blather about bad mileage.

&gt; I went to his website, but he hasn't seen fit to post anything about his
&gt; usage, speed, or acceleration profiles. If the information is
&gt; there, it's buried within the bowels of his post. Given the
&gt; socioeconomic gravity of his claims, his lack of forthrightness is
&gt; troublesome.

&gt; Next i went to the linked hybrid electric bulletin board page and found,
&gt; immediately, four drivers prius drivers who achieve mileage roughly 25+%
&gt; greater than Mr. Blackshaw, with no complaints. In the Civic
&gt; discussions, there were not any discussions about mileage.

&gt; So I googled up civic hybrid poor mileage in google groups and found a
&gt; total of 136 articles. Not very many articles, and quite a few of them
&gt; were not articles about poor mileage performance in the Civic hybrid.

&gt; Tthe Wired article is either poorly written or badly researched, Mr.
&gt; Blackshaw is not forthcoming with the facts necessary to evaluate his
&gt; complaint, and the specific citations and claims of users complaining
&gt; about poor performance of the vehicles are not supported by the public
&gt; record, and very likely specious.

&gt; .max

"/> It wouldn't be the first time a Wired article was badly researched. We
used to get it where I worked and people who knew about the relevant
material would just laugh at the mistakes.

In our old Audi (22 years old, 5 cylinders), my mother never gets more
than 20 mpg when she drives it (city) and I never get less than 24 mpg.
Still testing out the newer Audi (12 years old, 6 cylinders). If I'm
reading the mileage monitor correctly, the mother is getting about 18
mpg when she drives and I'm getting about 22. I don't know what the EPA
rated mileage is for either car. It does shift differently than the
older one and I probably can squeeze more mileage out of it once I've
got that worked out.

to directly compare a Civic with its hybrid variant, both the Insight and

&gt; But what about maintenance? How reliable is this more expensive,
&gt; ecofreak car going to be? Well I can expect a $2,000-$3,000 bill in
&gt; about 5 years to replace the batteries. Add that to the extra money I
&gt; am trying to recover through better gas mileage.

"/> How many people keep their econoboxes for 5 years or 100,000+ miles? Anyone
who sells a Prius before that will NOT have to pay for a battery, because of
the warranty. Further, Toyota claims it to be a &quot;life of vehicle&quot; (&gt;150,000
miles) component, so the chances of having to pay for a new battery is
relatively low for the typical user.

Further, with the trend in battery technology, those batteries will be
significantly better and cheaper in 6 years...

&gt; I decided that this hybrid hype is just that. Hype.

of the &quot;me too&quot; hybrids coming out may be little more than ill-conceived
reactions to the success of the first 2 generations...

&gt; http://www.wired.com/news/autotech/0,2554,63413,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Pete Blackshaw was so excited about getting a hybrid gasoline-electric
&gt; car that he had his wife videotape the trip to the Honda dealership to
&gt; pick up his Civic Hybrid. The enthusiastic owner ordered a customized
&gt; license plate with &quot;MO MILES&quot; on it, and started a blog about his new
&gt; hybrid lifestyle.

&gt; But after a few months of commuting to his job in Cincinnati,
&gt; Blackshaw's hybrid euphoria vanished as his car's odometer revealed that
&gt; the gas mileage he was hoping for was only a pipe dream. Honda's Civic
&gt; Hybrid is rated by the EPA to get 47 miles per gallon in the city, and
&gt; 48 mpg on the highway. After nearly 1,000 miles of mostly city driving,
&gt; Blackshaw was getting 31.4 mpg.

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

"/> Who cares about the gas mileage? I'm more concerned with the
electrocution issue. Wasn't there something in the news about that
recently? Hybrid owners getting fried by their cars?

Oh, and your gas mileage won't be significantly lower than the Prius in
real-world driving. My wife's averages 35MPG mixed. BTW, side curtains are
no longer optional. So in a few years, you'd have to lower the purchase
price of the prius by 6 grand to compete in the same league as an Aerio,

The differences may be due to the battery energy level at the
start of the test. That is, a drained pack isn't going to give
you that added kick that full charged one will. I would think
that under normal driving conditions 10 seconds is reasonable
to expect.

Obviously top speed is more than simply horsepower because the
wind and rolling resistance also play a big part.

Sorry, but when I read the blogs of Prius owners, I'm too busy laughing
to take these cars seriously.

This one's a real hoot. Poor guy must have a teeny, tiny penis!

&quot;Envious. While stealth crawling through the grocery store
parking lot, I silently rolled passed someone brushing fresh
snow off his car. My Prius captured his eye. When I got out,
I said &quot;Hi&quot; then drew attention to the Prius. He commented that
he would have got one if he could have afforded it. I was
impressed that he was well informed, so we chatted awhile.
He closed the conversion by saying he was envious of me.
That stopped me dead in my tracks&quot;

Same guy,

&quot;Followed. I saw an Aqua Prius. He got behind me and followed
for several miles. Seeing his Prius in the mirror and knowing he
was watching my Prius for so long was really exciting.&quot;

Hmm, that's a little creepy. I'm betting he had to pull over and
take matters into his own hands!

&quot;It makes me feel smarter&quot;

It's a car, not Anna Nichol.Smith.

&quot;I'm making a statement&quot;

What, that you are a sucker?

Another gem from the small penis, Prius guy.

&quot;Ahh! As I was waiting to cross the street, I saw (but didn't hear)
a Blue Prius drive by then pull over. That was my cue.
I ran over before the friend I was with had an opportunity to stop me.
Outside the driver window I stood there patiently while displaying a
photo of my Prius&quot;

Prius has people wasting money AND bandwidth!

Toyota says the top speed is 110 mph which would require about 100

adaptors ready and willing to pay the cost of real-world beta testing and

think the conventional IC powertrains will go away until gas gets over 5
bucks a gallon and/or there is a massive and currently unexpected

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's odd considering some dealers are asking a whopping $5000

&gt;&gt; I went to 3 dealers. The first one would &quot;let&quot; me have one for $1,000

to
&gt;&gt; $1500 over list by the time the car actually arrived. I declined. The

what I
&gt;&gt; paid when it arrived.

&gt;&gt; I haven't heard of any $5000 premiums; $2500 is the worst I've heard

&gt; house when the total power output would be of the order
&gt; of 100KW which is plenty to heat an average house.

&gt; It wouldnt 'throw off' anything like that much heat tho.

"/> No, &quot;I&quot; haven't done anything other than report that I read a statement to
that effect. I don't know if it's correct or not, but if I _think_ about it
for a couple of minutes, here's what I come up with.

If a car gets 30 miles to the gallon on the highway, it burns a couple of
gallons of gas per hour at 60 mph. (I suspect that the &quot;average&quot; car gets
poorer mileage than that and so burns somewhat more than that.) Something
like 12% of the energy from combustion actually goes into spinning the
wheels and the rest of it ends up as waste heat. Much if not most of that
waste heat ends up in the coolant, and if you turn on the heater, some
portion of that ends up in the passenger compartment.

I don't know what the actual percentages are, but it doesn't sound beyond
the bounds of reason that the heat equivalent of between one half gallon to
something over a gallon of burning gasoline could be delivered by the heater
per hour. A kerosene space heater can keep a house warm while burning far
less than a gallon of fuel an hour, and though kerosene contains slightly
more energy per gallon than gasoline (135,000 BTU's per US gallon for
kerosene, a bit over 125,071 for gasoline) it seems to me that the statement
is at least plausible enough not to be dismissed out of hand.

I don't know quite what you mean by the &quot;total power output&quot; of a car, but
if it's the amount of motive power available from the engine, or the total
motive power available at the wheels, it's beside the point. No engine is
100% efficient, and automobile engines are no exception - a good auto engine
has a thermodynamic efficiency of around 20% and up to 35% or so is
theoretically possible. Up to four-fifths of the energy content of gasoline
burned ends up as waste heat and the heater for the passengers runs off the
waste heat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that in the winter in my car, I don't keep the heat blasting
full force very

&gt;&gt; Sure, but thats a lot smaller than a whole house.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt that heating the passenger compartment in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the winter would be much of an issue in most climates.

In most states they could buy a VW TDI and get better fuel economy, without

For true economy and energy indpendence, they could convert a diesel car to
bio-diesel, and run it from used cooking oil, available free (Japanese

change it frequently so it's cleaner and in greater supply).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The 2004 EPA ratings for the Prius are 60 for city and 51 for highway.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers assume level ground and shirt sleeve temperatures. For 2003,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ratings were 45 for city and 52 for highway. You seem to be getting
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2003 numbers almost precisely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Curiously, how are these cars affected when running AC (or do they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it?). Likewise, I can't imagine those little lawn mower motors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being able to throw off much heat in the winter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When I test drove both the Prius and Civic hybrids last year, I was told
&gt;&gt;&gt; that if you have the air conditioning on, the gas powered engine doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; shut off. Obviously, that's going to impact mileage, probably more so in
&gt;&gt;&gt; city driving than on the highway.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for heat, I don't know, but I read once that the &quot;average&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; car engine throws off enough heat to warm the &quot;average&quot; house.

&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt; What you have likely done is mangle the TOTAL POWER
&gt; OUTPUT of a car engine at max power output into that quite
&gt; different 'throws off enough heat'. Certainly the total power
&gt; output of a car engine would be enough to heat an average
&gt; house when the total power output would be of the order
&gt; of 100KW which is plenty to heat an average house.

&gt; It wouldnt 'throw off' anything like that much heat tho.

"/> It's been decades since I took physics so I'll probably totally screw
this up. But we'll try it just for fun:

The efficiency of an internal-combustion energy is about 30%. In other
words, 70% of the gasoline is turned into heat.

A quick websearch shows that a gallon of gasoline contains about 125,000
BTU's. So a gasoline engine puts out about 0.75 * 125,000 = 93,000 BTU's
per gallon of gasoline as waste heat.

Figure you get 20 mpg and you're doing 60 mph. That's three gallons
you're burning per hour. So we're looking at 3x93,000 = roughly 280,000
BTU's per hour.

Here in the midwest a typical heater for a moderate sized house is
around 40,000 BTU's per hour. So if the engine is putting out 280,000
BTU's per hour of waste heat, that's enough to heat 280,000 / 40,000 = 7
houses.

That just doesn't sit well with my instincts, but I went back to the web
and found multiple sources putting gasoline engines at ~30% efficiency,
gasoline at ~125,000 BTU's per hour, and showing house heaters with a
range of 10,000 to 62,000 BTU's per hour.

Darn if I know. :(

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2003 numbers almost precisely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Curiously, how are these cars affected when running AC (or do they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it?). Likewise, I can't imagine those little lawn mower motors
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being able to throw off much heat in the winter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When I test drove both the Prius and Civic hybrids last year, I was told
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that if you have the air conditioning on, the gas powered engine doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shut off. Obviously, that's going to impact mileage, probably more so in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; city driving than on the highway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for heat, I don't know, but I read once that the &quot;average&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; car engine throws off enough heat to warm the &quot;average&quot; house.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt; What you have likely done is mangle the TOTAL POWER
&gt;&gt; OUTPUT of a car engine at max power output into that quite
&gt;&gt; different 'throws off enough heat'. Certainly the total power
&gt;&gt; output of a car engine would be enough to heat an average

The reason its so implausible is because that 70% aint

The total power developed by a car engine, say 100KW
or so, is certainly enough to heat an average house tho.

I have to leave in the morning for an impromptu business trip but I'll
be able to check your reply in a week or so via google. Just to keep you
honest in the meantime I'm cross-posting this to alt.physics.

For the good folks in alt.physics, the question is &quot;how many houses can
be heated by the heat 'thrown off' by a car engine? A few numbers that
might come in handy are that a gallon of gas contains 125,000 BTU's, a
4-stroke internal-combustion engine has an efficiency of approx. 30%,
and the average midwest home requires a 40,000 BTU heater in the
winter.

Let's figure that the car gets 20 mpg and is traveling at 60 mph. The
energy that actually propels the car doesn't count, we're only
interested in the heat that is &quot;thrown off&quot;, in other words radiated
from the engine, dissipated by the radiator, and lost through the
exahust system.

I don't know if I did this right, but I took 70% of 125,000 BTU's in a
gallon of gasoline as being wasted as heat. That gives 93,000 BTU's. A 20
mpg vehicle doing 60 mph burns 3 gallons in an hour. Multiply that by
93,000, divide by 40,000 BTU's to heat the average midwest home, and
the result was enough BTU's to heat seven homes.

If anyone knows the efficiency of a hybrid car engine then it would also
interest a few people in this thread to have the calculations done for
comparison purposes. However you'd want to compare it to a similar-sized
internal-combustion engine rather than my 20 mpg gashog.

"/> No. But worst case you can use diesel.

If I had $24,000 and I wanted to maximize the environmental benefit, I'd by
a Gem for $8000, and a Corolla or Civic $14,000. The Gem would be for around
town and commuting, the compact would be for other times, or in bad weather.
Of course I live in California, where I could probably use the Gem most of
the year, and have a commute suitable for the limitations of a Gem.

IMVAIO, the ideal hybrid would operate on batteries down to say 20% of
capacity, with a range of say 20 miles on a full charge, and you could
recharge the batteries from AC power, or from the gasoline engine, while
driving. This would allow the majority of commuters to run without buyin
fuel during the week, especially if the workplaces made charging stations
available (even for a fee).

Ths stock Prius turns on the gasoline engine when the batteries are at 90%
of capacity. There are ways to trick the Prius into running on electricity
for much longer (simulate an empty gas tank). The Prius uses NiMH batteries
which are not damaged by deep discharge. The Prius would go about 10 miles
on a fully charged battery, if you kept the gasoline engine off, and went
down to 10% of capacity. But since the only way to charge the batteries is
from the engine, there is no upside to running on electricity for this long.
It wouldn't be too hard to design a home charger that charged the 274 volt
battery pack, but this would be rather hazardous, and you couldn't easily
have a charger at work.

As several people have pointed out, money-wise, the Prius makes no sense at
all. When I look at what's in the driveways in my neighborhood, it's almost
always one minivan (Sienna or Odyssey)or mid-sized SUV (4Runner or Pilot),
and one mid-sized car (Camry or Accord). A 4 cylinder Camry or Accord sells
for about $17,000, versus $24,000 for the Prius. That $7000 would by 2800
gallons of gasoline at $2.50 per gallon This will take you about 84,000
miles in a Camry or Accord, 126,000 miles in a Prius. Assuming 15,000 miles
per year, break even, in terms of money, is 8.4 years, but not really, since
the batteries on the Prius will have been replaced at least once during that
time.

But as several people have pointed out, people are buying the Prius more for
environmental and political reasons, than to save money.

Of course the ultimate environmental benefit is what I did today--bicycled
the nine miles to work.

It may seat 5 (very very small people) but the recommended weight
limit will constrain you to one adult passenger. Honda recommends
a maximum of 375 pounds for their hybrid. I think Toyota's recommendation
was only slightly higher.

&gt;&gt; I briefly considered buy a Hybrid. The first Prius just didn't do it
&gt;&gt; for me, and the Insight was totally inadequate for my need.

&gt; Both of those were &quot;first efforts&quot; to get hybrids on the market and
&gt; gaugeconsumer acceptance.

&gt; The new Prius is significantly refined. Though it's a short little bugger,
&gt; it's about as wide as my Passat, and VERY roomy for a &quot;small&quot; car. Still
&gt; not as comfortable as a bigger car, but neither is any small gas-powered
&gt; car.

&gt;&gt; It would take the average owner 10
&gt;&gt; years to recover the higher initial cost of the car in gas savings.
&gt;&gt; Even with gas prices doubling - that return on investment takes 5
&gt;&gt; years.

&gt; That is assuming the cars are otherwise identical. While you might be able
&gt; to directly compare a Civic with its hybrid variant, both the Insight and
&gt; Prius are unique cars. What cars are you comparing them with for the
&gt; initial costs?

"/> I was comparing them with similar sized cars, like the Civic and the
Echo. It is a fair comparison if you are talking about economy. It
is fair to say the Insight is significantly different in design than a
Civic - but I wasn't looking at appearance - I was looking at the
economics. Though they are a bit different, The original Prius and
Echo were the same car to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But what about maintenance? How reliable is this more expensive,
&gt;&gt; ecofreak car going to be? Well I can expect a $2,000-$3,000 bill in
&gt;&gt; about 5 years to replace the batteries. Add that to the extra money I
&gt;&gt; am trying to recover through better gas mileage.
&gt; How many people keep their econoboxes for 5 years or 100,000+ miles?

"/> See me raising my hand?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyone
&gt; who sells a Prius before that will NOT have to pay for a battery, because of

"/> OK. So the original owner won't see this cost if he sells his car
within a couple of years. At least he won't *directly* pay for it. I
tend to agree with predictions that hybrids are going to see poor
resale values.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Further, Toyota claims it to be a &quot;life of vehicle&quot; (&gt;150,000
&gt; miles) component, so the chances of having to pay for a new battery is
&gt; relatively low for the typical user.

"/> What happens at 150,000? Do you just junk the car? Seems to me that
none of this is any better than a conventional car.

...it's going to take years to recover the higher initial cost in fuel
savings. I have to bet on the price of gas

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Further, with the trend in battery technology, those batteries will be
&gt; significantly better and cheaper in 6 years...
&gt;&gt; I decided that this hybrid hype is just that. Hype.

&gt; Not any more, at least not for the new, purpose-built vehicles. OTOH, some
&gt; of the &quot;me too&quot; hybrids coming out may be little more than ill-conceived
&gt; reactions to the success of the first 2 generations...

"/> I am open to seeing things get better. I am not slamming the idea of
hybrids. I am just not jumping on the bandwagon. If I am going to

If you're going to extract the max heat available
out of the gasoline, the only thing that makes
any sense at all with heating a house is to burn
it, dont have the car engine involved at all.

And it makes no sense to use gasoline either,
makes a lot more sense to use heating oil instead.

&gt;&gt; OK... Now you equate the reliability of a used, cheap, &quot;older&quot; VW or
&gt;&gt; Mercedes diesel with a new Prius or other hybrid...

&gt; I know of only one person with a Prius and one person with a bio-diesel
&gt; Mercedes. Based on this admittedly small sample, the latter has been more
&gt; reliable. The Prius owner now rides his bike, because his Prius is
&gt; perpetually at the dealer, who has take to &quot;trying things&quot; to fix it. New
&gt; transmission, new computer, new power controller.

&gt;&gt; I see... Used cooking oil right from the vat at any roadside Japanese
&gt;&gt; restaurant can go into the tank, without
&gt;&gt; further filtering or processing...

&gt; No. But worst case you can use diesel.

&gt; If I had $24,000 and I wanted to maximize the environmental benefit, I'd by
&gt; a Gem for $8000, and a Corolla or Civic $14,000. The Gem would be for around
&gt; town and commuting, the compact would be for other times, or in bad weather.
&gt; Of course I live in California, where I could probably use the Gem most of
&gt; the year, and have a commute suitable for the limitations of a Gem.

&gt; IMVAIO, the ideal hybrid would operate on batteries down to say 20% of
&gt; capacity, with a range of say 20 miles on a full charge, and you could
&gt; recharge the batteries from AC power, or from the gasoline engine, while
&gt; driving. This would allow the majority of commuters to run without buyin
&gt; fuel during the week, especially if the workplaces made charging stations
&gt; available (even for a fee).

&gt; Ths stock Prius turns on the gasoline engine when the batteries are at 90%
&gt; of capacity. There are ways to trick the Prius into running on electricity
&gt; for much longer (simulate an empty gas tank). The Prius uses NiMH batteries
&gt; which are not damaged by deep discharge. The Prius would go about 10 miles
&gt; on a fully charged battery, if you kept the gasoline engine off, and went
&gt; down to 10% of capacity. But since the only way to charge the batteries is
&gt; from the engine, there is no upside to running on electricity for this long.
&gt; It wouldn't be too hard to design a home charger that charged the 274 volt
&gt; battery pack, but this would be rather hazardous, and you couldn't easily
&gt; have a charger at work.

&gt; As several people have pointed out, money-wise, the Prius makes no sense at
&gt; all. When I look at what's in the driveways in my neighborhood, it's almost
&gt; always one minivan (Sienna or Odyssey)or mid-sized SUV (4Runner or Pilot),
&gt; and one mid-sized car (Camry or Accord). A 4 cylinder Camry or Accord sells
&gt; for about $17,000, versus $24,000 for the Prius. That $7000 would by 2800
&gt; gallons of gasoline at $2.50 per gallon This will take you about 84,000
&gt; miles in a Camry or Accord, 126,000 miles in a Prius. Assuming 15,000 miles
&gt; per year, break even, in terms of money, is 8.4 years, but not really, since
&gt; the batteries on the Prius will have been replaced at least once during that
&gt; time.

&gt; But as several people have pointed out, people are buying the Prius more for
&gt; environmental and political reasons, than to save money.

&gt; Of course the ultimate environmental benefit is what I did today--bicycled
&gt; the nine miles to work.

"/> The ultimate environmental benefit is to work from home instead.

since the 4 cylinder engine in the LE is sufficiently powerful for most

In any case, as long as Prius buyers understand that the TCO is higher on a
Prius than on a comparably sized mid-size car, they can choose to spend
their money on a Prius to reduce foreign oil dependency. Environmentally, it
probably is a wash, due to the issues with battery disposal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not what HEAT the engine 'throws off' when used like that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What was being discussed was what the car 'throws

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Up to four-fifths of the energy content of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gasoline burned ends up as waste heat

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But isnt what the engine 'throws off' as heat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;delurk&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wish you hadnt leapt out of that closet quite so enthusiastically,
&gt;&gt;&gt; there are clearly children here and you might frighten them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you burn a gallon of gasoline, you produce 125k BTU's of heat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That aint what the car engine does with the gasoline.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It *certainly* does.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, quite a bit of it is delivered as power instead.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Conventional gasoline = 5.253E9 BTU/barrel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; = 131,325 BTU per gallon, give or take. ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Separeate issue entirely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec13-367.pdf

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A gasoline engine is at *best* 33% efficient (most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sites give 30% as a maximum), giving: 88,000BTU
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heat/gallon of heat radiated by the engine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats where you lot keep getting it wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That 70% roughly ISNT 'thrown off' as heat by the engine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hint: much of it ends up out the exhaust pipe.

&gt;&gt; It's still waste heat.

&gt; Separate issue entirely to what is was being discussed, whether
&gt; a car engine 'throws off' enough heat to heat an average house.

&gt; It doesnt.

"/> Of *course* it does. I've given you the numbers, yet all you can
to is say that I'm wrong. An IC engine is at *most 33%
efficient, which means 67% of the energy isn't transferred to

be shed somewhere! THis heat is *far* more than the average
house uses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It could *easily* be recovered if there was a use for it.

likely be enough too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes, you could also turn the power the engine
&gt; produces into heat, even easier, and use that to heat
&gt; the house, and that would indeed heat the average

"/> Of course it was *exactly* what was being discussed! Your
argument is simply silly, and not at all to the point. My
furnace was (when I used #2 oil) set for about 1gal/hr, so that's
a third of the gasoline consumption of the example car (of which
only 33% goes into mechanical energy). This simple comparison
means that the car will produce 2X the waste heat as my furnace,
and my furnace runs at most 50% duty cycle. Sooo, the car will
produce 4X the waste heat (when operating) as my house uses, even
at -30C.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What was being discussed was what the car 'throws

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it was burnt in a heater used to heat the house.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is, as I said, where you are going wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Up to four-fifths of the energy content of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gasoline burned ends up as waste heat

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But isnt what the engine 'throws off' as heat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;delurk&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wish you hadnt leapt out of that closet quite so enthusiastically,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are clearly children here and you might frighten them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you burn a gallon of gasoline, you produce 125k BTU's of heat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That aint what the car engine does with the gasoline.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It *certainly* does.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, quite a bit of it is delivered as power instead.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Conventional gasoline = 5.253E9 BTU/barrel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; = 131,325 BTU per gallon, give or take. ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Separeate issue entirely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec13-367.pdf

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A gasoline engine is at *best* 33% efficient (most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sites give 30% as a maximum), giving: 88,000BTU
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heat/gallon of heat radiated by the engine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats where you lot keep getting it wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That 70% roughly ISNT 'thrown off' as heat by the engine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hint: much of it ends up out the exhaust pipe.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's still waste heat.

&gt;&gt; Separate issue entirely to what is was being discussed, whether
&gt;&gt; a car engine 'throws off' enough heat to heat an average house.
&gt;&gt; It doesnt.
&gt; Of *course* it does.

"/> It doesnt.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've given you the numbers,

"/> Not any relevant ones. The ONLY number that matters
is the amount of the total BTU available in the gas burnt
that is 'thrown off' as heat thru the radiator etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; yet all you can to is say that I'm wrong.

"/> Obvious lie.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; An IC engine is at *most 33% efficient, which
&gt; means 67% of the energy isn't transferred to
&gt; useful work, rather dissipated directly as heat.

"/> But aint 'thrown off' in the radiator, what was being discussed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This heat must be shed somewhere!

"/> Thats as stupid as saying that ALL the BTUs in
the gas consumed must end up as heat. Yes it
does, BUT that aint the heat being discussed.

Most obviously what BTUs get turned into power to
move the car around ultimately ALWAYS end up as
heat BUT THAT CANT BE USED TO HEAT A HOUSE.

And like I said, its stupid to waffle on about how many
BTUs are in the gas consumed, because it would be
MUCH more efficient to use the gas directly to heat
the house, and not have any car engine involved at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; THis heat is *far* more than the average house uses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Ths stock Prius turns on the gasoline engine when the batteries are at 90%

&gt;batteries
&gt;&gt; which are not damaged by deep discharge. The Prius would go about 10 miles
&gt;&gt; on a fully charged battery, if you kept the gasoline engine off, and went
&gt;&gt; down to 10% of capacity. But since the only way to charge the batteries is
&gt;&gt; from the engine, there is no upside to running on electricity for this

&gt;Actually, the gas engine runs 'when it's needed.' Seldom do the batteries
&gt;in mine get ABOVE 90%! I've seen my batteries go down to about 40% before
&gt;the engine cuts in -- that was in level to downhill, slow, stop &amp; go

&gt;&gt; It wouldn't be too hard to design a home charger that charged the 274 volt

"/> The base price for the Prius was $19,995 at the beginning of the year. It
has since gone up. While waiting for delivery, I got a letter from Toyota
telling me that the latest (at the time) $300 increase would not affect me,
since I ordered before the increase.

AFAIK, few Priuses/Prii are sold as the base model. In the northwest (port
of Portland arrival), &quot;Port Installed Accessories&quot; (read: mandatory
add-ons) of mats, cargo net, first aid kit, and security system cost $511.
Package 7, one of the most popular option packages (options are ONLY
available in 9 pre-defined packages) cost $2,255, and delivery is $515.
That brings the MSPR to $23,276, which is close to the $24,000 cited.

With Package 9 (includes GPS Nav), the highest MSRP now is about $26,055.

on the large end of mid-size, but as cheap as possible, may go for a

up the options on a Camry can make it quite expensive, though (and the

Malibu and the Mazda 6 do).

Good incentive not to buy new cars on eBay :) I purchased my 2004
Prius, with the second-best option package, for $22,500 and got a
$2,000 tax credit this year!

People on eBay are nuts... but then, some guy bought an _empty_ X-box
box for 115 pounds.

(automatic, 4 cylinder), sell for about $16,000 street price. The Prius
sells for well over 20. I suspect that the 24K is a result of the factory
loading up most of the Priuses with the most expensive option packages, and
not having many base models, while on the Accord and Camry the manufacturers
are going for high volume.

The same occured when the Honda Pilot was in short supply, you could ge only
the EX-L model. Now the lower cost models are available.

Most of the LEs are the base model. They are already well-equipped. The
typical factory options are ABS and sunroof, but these are not as common as
the base model.

"/> Plenty of people don't know the difference and interchange the terms without
really thinking about it (much like 'debt' and 'deficit'). Just for those
who don't know and may not ask:

A 'deduction' is subtracted from your gross income. You are not taxed on
that money. You still paid the money to someone but you don't have to pay
taxes on it.

A 'credit' is applied toward the taxes that you've paid.

As an example:
Assume:
That your gross was $100,000.
That you pay a flat tax of 10%.
You paid $2000 for something (part of a car or whatever)

Your taxes without any deductions or credits would be: 10% of $100,000 or
$10,000.
(easy enough)

With a $2000 deduction:
Gross: $100,000 - $2000 (deduction)
Still a 10% tax.

Your taxes for this would be on 10% of $98,000 or $9800.
You owe less taxes because you had a deduction.

With a $2000 credit:
Gross: $100,000
Still a 10% tax

Your taxes for this would be 10% of $100,000 or $10,000.
You have a credit applied to that $10,000 tax burden of $2000 so you're
actual taxes (that you pay out of your pocket) are $8000.

I hope that this helps those who weren't sure of the difference. I think
it's a fairly common mistake with taxes being what they are.

&gt;&gt; Where are people getting this $24,000 price tag for the Prius? You
&gt;&gt; might hit that with the most expensive option package... maybe.

&gt; The base price for the Prius was $19,995 at the beginning of the year. It
&gt; has since gone up. While waiting for delivery, I got a letter from Toyota
&gt; telling me that the latest (at the time) $300 increase would not affect
me,
&gt; since I ordered before the increase.

Assuming preceding numbers are near correct, compare 55 mpg to 37 mpg @

The diff is $259/yr (if my spreadsheet is correct!)

Subtract avg Echo from avg Prius:
19,995 - 10 910 = $9 085

Presumably, there's a way to compare the diff in purchase price (list) to
the difference in annual fuel costs (assuming other operating costs are
similar). But I don't know how to incorporate *typical* depreciation or
interest on typical loan on typical percentage.
