Who's for Big Government
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR200...

By E. J. Dionne Jr.
Wednesday, August 1, 2007; Page A17

HARBERT, Mich. -- One of the most predictable arguments is also one of
the most useless: that politics comes down to a choice between being
for &quot;big government&quot; or &quot;small government.&quot; Those catchphrases explain
remarkably little about what politicians do or what voters want.

Could there be any more of a big-government endeavor than the invasion
of Iraq, pursued by a president from the party of small government? Do
the domestic spying programs have anything to do with a small-
government agenda?

A Democratic Indonesian Tiger?

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Ten years ago this summer, Asia's financial
crisis hit Indonesia. Within a year, Southeast Asia's largest &quot;tiger&quot;
economy had collapsed: Gross domestic product fell 14 percent, the
currency dropped from 2,250 to 17,500 to the dollar, and the Jakarta
Stock Exchange plunged 91 percent in dollar terms. Millions lost jobs
as most large banks and many domestic firms went bankrupt. Protests
brought down President Suharto's 30-year-old authoritarian regime. The
country seemed close to chaos.

Today, Indonesia is back: a working, if imperfect, democracy and a
recovering economic tiger. The emergence of a solid democratic regime
has quelled regional separatism and Islamic militancy. Moreover,
Indonesians are bullish on foreign investment and U.S. brands, though
they are skittish about economic liberalization. A stable, growing
Indonesia is again attracting foreign investors, despite their
disappointment with the pace of economic and legal reform.

Making the Think Tanks Think

Wednesday, August 1, 2007; Page A17

Just in case you haven't noticed, the major presidential candidates --
Republican and Democratic -- are dodging one of the thorniest problems
they would face if elected: the huge budget costs of aging baby
boomers. In last week's CNN-YouTube debate, New Mexico Gov. Bill
Richardson cleverly deflected the issue. &quot;The best solution,&quot; he said,
&quot;is a bipartisan effort to fix it.&quot; Brilliant. There's already a
bipartisan consensus: Do nothing. No one plugs cutting retirement
benefits or raising taxes, the obvious choices.

End of story? Not exactly. There's also a less-noticed cause for the
neglect. Washington's vaunted think tanks -- citadels for public
intellectuals both liberal and conservative -- have tiptoed around the
problem. Ideally, think tanks expand the public conversation by saying
things too controversial for politicians to say on their own. Here,
they've abdicated that role.

Having stepped out of the warm bath of global affection that followed
the Sept. 11 attacks, Americans are feeling shivery and exposed.

Anti-Americanism, as measured by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, has
risen since 2002 in much of the world, particularly in the
predominantly Muslim societies of the Middle East and Asia -- though
the American brand remains fairly strong in places such as India,
Japan, Latin America and Africa. A nation whose founding document
urges a &quot;decent respect to the opinions of mankind&quot; is naturally
anxious when those opinions sour.

This is one of those odd weeks when Congress may actually work. Both

children's health coverage program. Yesterday, the House enacted
lobbying reform, and the Senate may follow suit tomorrow. Also
yesterday, the House passed a bill restoring the right of victims of

In short, it's one of those weeks when Nancy Pelosi has no doubts
about the wisdom of her decision to become speaker of the House.

MANY OF the stories that expose government malfeasance, sear the

point journalists in the right direction or offer direct testimony on
the condition that their names not be revealed. Protecting the
identity of a source is a bedrock of American journalism.

President Bush re-embraces the Middle East strategy he once
repudiated.
Wednesday, August 1, 2007; Page A16

THE BUSH administration's announcement of new Middle Eastern arms
sales and aid is as much a political as a military initiative. Only
Israel is likely ever to use the additional weapons in its own
defense; Egypt faces no conventional military threat, while Saudi
Arabia and other Persian Gulf states will continue to depend on
American power to deter Iran. The real point, as Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice put it at the beginning of a regional tour, is &quot;to
affirm the importance of this region to the United States . . . in
what is a complicated time.&quot; Though Ms. Rice didn't spell it out, one
of the complications is the likelihood that the United States will
draw down forces or retreat altogether from Iraq in the next year or
so. The military packages can be seen as part of an effort to contain
the resulting damage to U.S. influence in the Middle East.

Intelligence Chief Says Bush Authorized Secret Activities Under One
Order

By Dan Eggen
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, August 1, 2007; A01

The Bush administration's chief intelligence official said yesterday
that President Bush authorized a series of secret surveillance
activities under a single executive order in late 2001. The disclosure
makes clear that a controversial National Security Agency program was
part of a much broader operation than the president previously
described.

The disclosure by Mike McConnell, the director of national
intelligence, appears to be the first time that the administration has
publicly acknowledged that Bush's order included undisclosed
activities beyond the warrantless surveillance of e-mails and phone
calls that Bush confirmed in December 2005.

Wednesday, August 1, 2007; A01

The House gave final and overwhelming approval yesterday to a landmark
bill that would tighten ethics and lobbying rules for Congress,
forcing lawmakers to more fully detail how their campaigns are funded
and how they direct government spending.

The new lobbying bill would, for the first time, require lawmakers to
disclose small campaign contributions that are &quot;bundled&quot; into large
packages by lobbyists. It would require lobbyists to detail their own
campaign contributions, as well as payments to presidential libraries,
inaugural committees and charities controlled by lawmakers. The
proposal would also put new disclosure requirements on special
spending measures for pet projects, known as &quot;earmarks.&quot;

the behest of an executive for the drugmaker, urged him to slow down,
the prosecutor told the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday.

John L. Brownlee, the U.S. attorney in Roanoke, testified that he was

attorney general and one of the Justice aides involved in the removal

Adm. Michael G. Mullen, President Bush's nominee to head the Joint

taking a heavy toll on the U.S. military, warning that American forces
are &quot;not unbreakable&quot; and stressing the need to &quot;plan for an eventual
drawdown&quot; of troops.

Appearing in a confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services
Committee, Mullen, 60, acknowledged that the increase in U.S. forces
cannot continue past April 2008 under the military's current force
structure. He also cautioned that Iraqi political reconciliation is
not keeping pace with security improvements.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, July 31 -- Army Secretary Pete Geren has
censured a retired three-star general for misconduct in the
investigation of the 2004 &quot;friendly fire&quot; death of former National
Football League player and Army Ranger Pat Tillman. Geren also
recommended that the general be evaluated for a possible demotion, an
extremely rare move.

Geren announced on Tuesday that he had censured retired Lt. Gen.
Philip R. Kensinger Jr. after senior Army officers determined that
Kensinger lied to investigators about when he learned that Tillman's
death was a suspected friendly-fire case. Investigators found that
Kensinger was alerted to Tillman's fate days before he attended a
nationally televised funeral service for Tillman, at which time family
members believed the Army's story that he had died while attacking
enemy forces in Afghanistan.

The Bush administration is pressing Congress this week for the

and any person in the United States.

The proposal, submitted by Director of National Intelligence Mike
McConnell to congressional leaders on Friday, would amend the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for the first time since 2006 so
that a court order would no longer be needed before wiretapping anyone
&quot;reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States.&quot;

$1.6 Million Appropriation Went to Alaska Marine Life Center

The FBI is investigating whether Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) used a
$1.6 million congressional appropriation to help an Alaska marine
center purchase property from a business partner of the senator's son,
said sources familiar with the probe.

That investigation comes amid a widening federal grand-jury probe into
Stevens's connections to an energy services company. The FBI and the
Interior Department's inspector general are also jointly examining a
series of budgetary earmarks endorsed by Stevens in recent years for
the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, said sources familiar with the
probe who spoke about it on the condition of anonymity.

Vice President Cheney said yesterday that he would not immediately

there is no other place to send some of the world's most dangerous
men.

President Bush has said repeatedly that he wants to close the prison
once administration officials figure out what to do with several
hundred remaining detainees. But senior administration officials have
been divided about how to accomplish that, given practical impediments
such as the reluctance on the part of some countries to accept the
return of their citizens detained there.

U.N. Authorizes 26,000 Peacekeeping Troops for Darfur

UNITED NATIONS, July 31 -- The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously
Tuesday to authorize a force of about 26,000 U.N. peacekeepers to help
end more than four years of violence in the Darfur region of Sudan,
which has left hundreds of thousands dead and forced millions from
their homes.

The U.N. mission, one of the largest in the organization's history,
would assume authority by Dec. 31 over a force of about 7,000 African
Union peacekeepers who have struggled to protect civilians. But U.N.
officials said that it could be several more months beyond the
deadline before the full force is deployed and that stemming the
violence will be impossible without a political settlement between the
government in Khartoum and numerous rebel factions.

The suspect, Kaing Khek Iev, 62, has acknowledged heading the S-21

tortured before execution. An estimated 1.7 million people died from
hunger, disease, overwork and execution when the Khmer Rouge was in

Fourfold Increase In Spending Urged

Spending on English instruction must be quadrupled to more than $4
billion a year for the next six years to make legal and illegal adult
immigrants proficient in skills crucial to their assimilation and the
economic future of a country whose population is increasingly foreign-
born, a new national report says.

In the first nationwide study of its kind, the nonpartisan Migration
Policy Institute estimates that an additional $200 million a year is
needed to improve legal immigrants' English skills enough for them to
pass a citizenship test and &quot;fully participate in the country's civic
life.&quot; An additional $2.9 billion a year is required for illegal
immigrants to meet those standards, the report says.
