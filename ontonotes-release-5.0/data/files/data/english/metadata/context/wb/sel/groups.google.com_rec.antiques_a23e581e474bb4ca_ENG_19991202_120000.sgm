Hi, Charleen. I found the Eastwood buffing manual, and I tried to
scan in some pages, but the images have to be huge in order to be
readable (285K per page). And then, thinking about it, there isn't a
whole lot on silver, so I thought I'd just summarize.

First, the manual does not recommend anything but &quot;final&quot; buffing for
solid or plated silver. And that would involve jewelers rouge and a
flannel buffing wheel, although I would think you could use the felt
tip to get into nooks and crannies.

About applying compound to the buffing wheel, it says:

&quot;With the wheel attached and the motor running, gently touch the
appropriate tube of compound (jewelers rouge, in this case) to the
face of the wheel for one to two seconds. Apply the compound slightly
below the centerline of the wheel.

&quot;The compound may appear to be dried out, but this is normal. The
heat from contacting the spinning buffing wheel surface will melt the
binder, and the wheel will pick up the compound.

&quot;If you are working with a new wheel, hold a piece of scrap metal
lightly against the wheel surface to spread the compound evenly across
the surface. It may be necessary to repeat this process one or two
times until the new wheel is loaded evenly with compound.&quot;

One of the keys to successful buffing, the manual says, is to let the
wheel do the work. Use only light pressure against the wheel, and
always keep the piece or the wheel moving. It notes, too, that after
buffing, the piece should be thoroughly washed with dishwashing liquid
to remove all traces of the rouge.

The book notes that it is important not to contaminate a wheel with
some different compound, and it recommends keeping each wheel in a
sealable plastic bag with its tube of stuff. If the rouge builds up
after a while, spin the wheel against a piece of scrap metal to clean
it. And if you get black streaks on the piece, it usually means you
are using too much compound.

Hope that helps,
Marshall

Hi again. Today, I dug out the Dremel manual and paperwork, and the
one item that wasn't mentioned in the Eastwood book has to do with
polishing speed. Dremel notes that slow speeds (15,000 rpm or less)
are best for polishing operations with the felt buffing accessories.

Marshal,
Would you look in that Dremel manual and see if there is a tiny drill bit
listed. I've looked in the stores, but there doesn't seem to be a bit that
drills holes into wood. I've tried using hubby's drill but it's so heavy
..the Dremel fits just right. (Tool makers.....get a clue, women have small
hands.)
Thank you !

All the accessories are listed in a separate book, but I have that,
too, and you can probably get it by calling Dremel and asking for
Customer Service at 414 554-1390. The book does list a seven-piece
drill set, which ranges from 1/32 to 1/8 inch. My book is from 1995,
and the price then was $11.65. I've also bought polishing stuff,
cutoff wheels and various bits from Sears. And, really, you can use
any small twist drill in the tool.

Have you tried going down to the hardward stores and just trying the
drills out for size? My father was into wordworking as a hobby to the
extent that he had a 16x16 storage building together with his garage
full of tools, and when he died, my mother couldn't find one of his
drills that she could deal with. She went and bought an inexpensive
1/4&quot; drill, and had no problems. Most men go for the larger drills,
with the more powerful and durable motors, and sturdier housings, but
this also yields additional size and weight that many women have trouble
dealing with. A cheap little Black and Decker may fit your hand better
and may be lighter and easier to handle than your husband's Porter
Cable. (Don't go for a cordless model, they weigh a lot more.)

If this fails, an adjustable speed cordless screwdriver will hold small
bits made with a standard hex base. Any decent hardware store will have
an assortment of sizes, although they won't be very large. They drill
slow, but they do work.

Yeah, but you need a spare oven to bake the powdercoated items.
That's been one of the complaints in the automotive groups about
Eastwood's home powdercoating kit. Of course, you *can* pick up an
old stove at an auction and put it in the garage. But it's one thing
they really downplayed in their early ads. And, too, where are you
gonna get an oven that will accept , say, a rear axle?
