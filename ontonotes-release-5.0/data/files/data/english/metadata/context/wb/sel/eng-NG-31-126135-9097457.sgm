I've decided to compose a list of weapons systems for spacecraft (present
and future). For this, let's assume a spacecraft with a zero-point energy
system and an entropy-reduction cooling system that runs on magic. The
list is as follows:

Ranged beam weapons

Masers - like lasers, but they shoot microwaves. Perfect for inducing
heating and electric currents in organic and metal, respectivly. Not sure
about the feasability for this, presumably it might be useful if you had
good focusing equipment. Right now masers usually only work at low power.

Lasers - the classic weapon. Fires a beam of light, anywhere from low
infrared to x-rays. Useful for intense heating, burning, and cutting of
substances. Additionally, if used for atomospheric combat, an electric
current can be sent upon the ionized air (if the wavelength is high enough
(say, ultraviolet) to ionize air) to make an electrolaser. Can be
deflected by mirrored surfaces, but more powerful ones would burn through
those in short order. X-ray lasers can make things explode due to very
intense heating and other effects. These would also penetrate and give any
human inside the spacecraft cancer or serious death.

Electrical beam - an oft-overlooked weapon. Put a high enough charge into
a needle facing into a vacuum, and you'll get a stream of high-speed
electrons ready to create a current in whatever conductive surface they
hit. Can be negated by a plastic spaceship.

Particle beam - Basically a more powerful version of your average linear
accelerator. Neutrons would cause radiation burns, DNA mutations, and
death to the people inside the spacecraft as well as inducing
radioactivity. Not sure about protons or more exotic particles.

Atom/molecular/ion beam - Like a particle beam, except uses more massive
&quot;particles&quot; for more damage. Ion beam would have electrical effects due to
positive/negative charge. More difficult to implement.

Energy beam - Think Star Trek phaser. This beam uses an undiscovered form
of energy to create damage, disintegration, matter-to-energy conversion,
collapsing matter into a black hole, or any number of other possible
effects, depending on what the energy does.

Missiles - your standard guided missile can be loaded with a variety of
warheads, and use a variety of targeting systems, including thermal,
optical, radar, gravimetric sensing, and possibly others.

Thermonuclear warhead - Your standard fusion bomb. These can produce
large amounts of damage to unshielded spaceships, but also produce a large
explosion, large amounts of ionizing radiation, lots of heat, and (if used
in atmosphere) an electromagnetic pulse. These are also heavy.

Conventional explosive warhead - Your standard high explosive. These
could be good for fighter combat, or lots of them against a larger craft.

Antimatter warhead - These are very powerful. Either the entire missile
could be made of antimatter, held in magnetic vacuum confinement until
launched with a coilgun, or it could have an antimatter payload in the
warhead alone, which could take two forms. It could annihilate with the
missile casing, or a matter slug inside the warhead arranged for maximum
yield, or it could be ejected to annihilate with the opposing spacecraft.
Either would produce a huge explosion for massive damage, along with a
shower of radiation and various particles.

Sand -  Useful for mounting on fighters, and able to destroy almost any
unshielded spacecraft. At orbital/interstellar speeds, a couple thousand
grains of sand would be very easy to launch from any sort of spaceship,
and would do massive damage do to high velocities. These aren't very
dramatic, though.

Others

Mass drivers - These could take the form of railguns or coilguns. They
could launch a metal slug, or a missile designed to survive the high
launch speeds, and magnetic flux or current. Does high amounts of damage.

Ramming - Not to be overlooked. Spaceships can run into other spaceships,
destroying them both unless one is a specialized ramming ship with
powerful engines and extra frontal armor.

If you can think of any more, add them to this list!

Pretty much useless for anything other than communications and active
sensors.  Even for point blank range CIWS, where the beam spread
isn't a blatant deal-killer, microwaves simply bounce off conductive
hulls too efficiently to make for a plausible weapon system.  Better
to
deliver that energy in the form of a laser or particle beam which
won't
just bounce off.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Lasers - the classic weapon. Fires a beam of light, anywhere from low
&gt; infrared to x-rays.
">

There are all sorts of different lasers.  The ones I favor are pulsed
free electron lasers using a lasership and a distant fresnel or zone
plate lens (possibly using something I call &quot;harmonic armor&quot; to help
protect the rather large lens from enemy far).  Unlike typical laser
weapon concepts, this can reach very long ranges and can scale
up to great power levels.  Most laser weapon concepts are limited
by the power levels that the optics can handle.  By using a distant
but large fresnel or zone plate lens, the only optics involved are a
large lens which focuses the beam onto a small spot on the target.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; substances.
">

I tend to favor pulsed lasers over continuous lasers.  A continuous
laser more or less has to melt its way through a target, which
requires a lot more energy than riddling the target with shrapnel.
But a laser is made up of photons, so it can't directly provide
shrapnel.  The solution is to use a pulsed laser, which can vaporize
a small amount of the target to produce an explosion which
converts other bits of the target into shrapnel.

The ideal thing is to create an explosion inside the target, because
a surface explosion directs most of its energy in the direction of
least resistance--out into the vacuum of space.  On way to achieve
this desired effect is a train of pulses.  First, a few small &quot;drill&quot;
pulses to blast out a tunnel, and then a big &quot;blast&quot; pulse to create
an internal explosion.

Another way is to fire a hard X-ray laser which is very penetrative
to begin with.  The zone plate free electron laser weapon design
can scale up to gamma rays, in principle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I suppose you're thinking of nuclear bomb pumped X-ray lasers.
But they might not even work, and even if they did work, they
aren't nearly as powerful as you're thinking.  The idea was that
they'd produce radiation damage knocking out the electronics
of Soviet ICBM warheads.  However, ICBM warheads are
small and can't afford the sheer mass penalty of any sort of
radiation shielding.  A manned space warship would either
have heavy radiation shielding or future cancer treatments
would render such radiation shielding unnecessary.  Either
way, a nuclear bomb pumped X-ray laser is not a threat to
the human occupants.

Electron beams are too hard to aim for anything but point
blank range use (they get deflected by natural magnetic
fields).

Even at point blank range, they won't do damage the way
you're thinking.  An incoming missile might not have any
magnetic field (not worth it), but it probably has a conductive
hull of some sort.  This will act like a Faraday cage, preventing
any &quot;lightning bolt&quot; of electrons from damaging what's inside.
The reason lightning bolts can be so damaging is because
they actually travel through a victim on their way to the ground.
But there's no &quot;ground&quot; behind a missile in space.  The
electrons will hit the Faraday cage and then have no particular
reason to flow anywhere inside.

However, a high velocity electron beam can do a LOT of
damage simply by pumping sheer kinetic energy into the
target.  The charge of the electron is mostly irrelevant,
except insofar as it turns the atoms of the target into big
gap-less &quot;nets&quot; that catch the electrons pronto.  (This
contrasts with neutrons, which see atoms as empty space
except for a tiny obstacle in the center.)  The relevant
factor is that a high velocity electron has lots of kinetic
energy, and when an electron bumps into the target, this
kinetic energy gets absorbed by the target.

A free electron laser weapon can have an auxiliary CIWS
mode which directly blasts the target with the electron
beam.  This can be VERY powerful.  A free electron laser's
peak power level is limited by the fact that only a fraction of
the electrons will lase on a given pass through the electron
wiggler.  By recycling the electrons, the kinetic energy of
the electrons that don't lase isn't wasted--the electrons
loop through the weapon until they lase.  But this does mean
the pulse of energy is &quot;smeared out&quot; a bit.  In contrast,
by using the electron beam directly, the entire pulse can
hit the target all at once.

One potentially useful thing about an electron beam is that
it can be slewed through wide angles electronically.  A
CRT monitor or TV uses this principle.  This might be
important for CIWS where the weapon needs to engage
many submunitions simultaneously from many directions.

It's not actually clear if it's even possible to make a neutron
beam weapon.  Currently, all particle accelerator designs
use electromagnetic forces and those forces have no effect
on neutrons.  Even if you did figure out how to make a high
energy neutron beam, it's not clear how useful it would be
as a weapon since so many neutrons might simply sail through
the target unhindered.

However, a neutral particle beam of atoms is certainly possible.
The idea is to accelerate ions and then neutralize them after
they've been accelerated.  There are a lot of HARD to solve
problems with taking a neutral atom beam and focusing it at
useful combat ranges, but there's no obvious hard physics
reason why they can't be competitive with lasers.

&gt; &quot;particles&quot; for more damage. Ion beam would have electrical effects due to

Actually, an atom or ion beam is typically called a &quot;particle beam&quot;.
The aren't more difficult to implement than the other sorts of
particle beam (electron beam, proton beam, positron beam,
anti-proton beam).  The hardware is actually exactly the same,
except the strengths of the fields may be different to account
for the different charge/mass ratio of the ionic particles.

As for &quot;more massive&quot;...not really.  For various reasons, the
best atom to use is hydrogen.  A hydrogen particle is hardly
any more massive than a proton.  And even if you do use a
heavier atom, the extra mass doesn't do any more damage.
In all cases, the overall amount of kinetic energy pumped
into the target is the same, and the target effects are the
same.  Whether the beam is charged or not has no significant
impact on the target effect.

Now, implementing a &quot;molecule&quot; beam would indeed be more
difficult.  Current particle accelerator designs don't really
work well with molecules since molecules can't be molecules
if you strip away too many electrons and you thus can't have
a really good charge/mass ratio.  Also, a molecule isn't
heavier enough to make any difference to the target effect.

That said, I have in the past pondered a &quot;colloid beam&quot;, which
fires dust particles big enough to actually pit and abrade the
target rather than just pour kinetic energy in an evenly
spread particle stream.  The numbers didn't really work out.

There is a wide variety of types of missile.  I tend to favor external
guidance due to the superior precision, and external power because
it's perhaps the only way to combine high delta-v and high thrust.
A missile can be literally as simple as a solid cannonball.  The
guiding
warship uses pulse lasers to vaporize a bit of the cannonball.  The
expanding gas produces thrust in the opposite direction.

You need electrical contact with the ionized channels, so this can't

pulses of infrared light to get self-focusing and filimentation for
your conductive waveguides.

Soft x-rays are actually absorbed quite rapidly by matter.  They have
good focus in vacuum for long range zapping, but only go a millimeter
or less on average before being absorbed.

Even hard x-rays are unlikely to be too much of a problem.  They are
simply to easy to shield against.  You need serious radiation
shielding for humans or non rad-hardened equipment to survive the
energetic cosmic rays and solar storms in space.  These latter
particles are much more penetrating than x-rays.  The only caveat is
if you are relying entirely on magnetic shielding for protection
against solar storms and cosmic rays, the x-rays will simply ignore
the magnetic fields that deflect and reflect the more penetrating
charged particles.

The beam divergence would be atrocious, and exacerbated by the fact
that the like-charged electrons repel one another.

Particle and atom/ion/molecule beams are the same thing.  Any you've
got it backwards - protons are easy to accelerate, so are atoms and
ions and even molecules, but neutrons well nigh impossible.  We can
only accelerate charged particles, like protons and heavier ions.  On
the other hand, the like-charged particles will repel each other,
causing unacceptable beam spread for space-based weapons use, not to
mention that charged particle beams will be impossible to aim because
they are deflected by ambient magnetic fields.  So, you need to
accelerate the charged particles, then neutralize the charge of the
beam before it leaves the spacecraft, either by adding electrons to
the protons or positively charged ions, or removing electrons from the
negatively charged ions.

Spherical Cow Gun.  I like it.  Now, let's figure out the various

the properties of a Spherical Cow.  Obviously, it has variable mass as
it grows.  It injests oxygen and hydrocarbons and exhausts carbon

More
relevant is the density of a Spherical Cow (1.0), and the fact that a
Spherical Cow is incompressible.  Another possibly relevant feature
is that Spherical Cow impacts are perfectly inelastic.

Hmm...So far, I'm failing to see how the properties of a Spherical Cow
can be made useful.

That's perfectly elastic you're thinking of, not perfectly inelastic,

I believe you're thinking of perfectly elastic collisions.

Perfectly elastic collisions preserve kinetic energy. Real world
collisions that preserve most of the kinetic energy are usually between
hard objects (like pool balls).

If some points on a perfectly spherical object move, they all must move
or the object's no longer perfectly spherical (unless you're rotating
the sphere, in which case two points can remain still).

To remain perfectly spherical all points of the surface would have to
move at the same time. For an incompressible, perfectly spherical cow
this would mean perfect rigidity.

Sure, I'm referring to collisions because that's how the term is used in
physics.  It governs how objects respond to collisions, and whether you
realize it or not, what you are describing (pushing an object into other
objects) involves collisions.

That would not still not be inelasticity, as I pointed out.  Perfect
inelasticity means that the object deforms and stays deformed.  Perfect
elasticity means the object either does not deform, or deforms and
springs back in such a way that it returns to its old shape with no loss
of transferred kinetic energy.

Silliness of spherical cows aside, you were still using the term
incorrectly.

Given special relativity, it's quite a bit worse than that.
Since the shape of the object is frame-dependent and all.
Plus, if it accelerates, it doesn't suffice to accelerate each and
every part of the object identically; that will distort the object
in its rest frame.  See Bell's spaceship paradox for another
application the principle.

There's a big connection, since the behavior of the objects determines
whether the collisions are elastic or inelastic (and to what degree, of
course, since it's a spectrum).  I pointed out what that connection is
in what you quoted above.  A very hard object tends to be involved in
elastic collisions (a pool ball).  A very springy object also tends to
be involved in elastic collisions (a very bouncy ball, as a kid we
called them &quot;superballs,&quot; not sure if that's a brand name or not).  An
object that deforms and remains deformed during a collision is
inelastic, since it absorbs some of the energy of the collision in the
process of deforming.

The two concepts are intimately related.  And you didn't address the
issue that pushing objects into one another -- what you were talking
about -- is by definition a collision.

Again, the term for this is &quot;plastic&quot; not &quot;perfect inelasticity&quot;

&quot;Perfect elasticity means the object either does not deform, or deforms
and springs back in such a way that it returns to its old shape with no
loss of transferred kinetic energy.&quot;

The middle part &quot;deforms and springs back to its old shape&quot; matches the
online definitions I can find for elastic wrt materials. The online
definitions Google's given me don't have a &quot;does not deform&quot; clause.

On the contrary the first part of these definitions say they deform. So
it still seems reasonable to call materials that don't deform
&quot;inelastic&quot;. Although in the future I'll probably use &quot;rigid&quot;.

When you provide a credible cite that &quot;perfectly elastic&quot; can mean &quot;does
not deform&quot;, I'll acknowledge the misuse of the word.

OK, I can see colliding elastic materials would result in elastic
collisions.

Although the way colliding elastic materials behave may have given rise
to the term &quot;elastic collision&quot;, they're still two separate concepts.

I agree with the above.  The most basic of features of a
Spherical Cow is that it is indeed Spherical (the whole
point is to simplify physics modeling).  That this is
incompatible with relativity is just handwaved.

This has absolutely nothing to do with what I meant
when I said collisions with Spherical Cows are always
perfectly inelastic.  To simplify physics modeling,
Spherical Cow collisions are all either perfectly elastic
or perfectly inelastic--meaning either Spherical Cows
bounce with 100% kinetic energy retention or they
always bounce with minimum kinetic energy retention
(converting the kinetic energy balance into heat which
is a monolithic statistic of the Spherical Cow--it's treated
as a single molecule for thermal modeling purposes).

Real life cows don't bounce very high when they fall
from a great height.  Instead, they pretty much don't
bounce at all.  Therefore, a Spherical Cow don't
bounce at all--their collisions are perfectly inelastic.

As for plasticity or ductility or Young's Modulus or
anything else to do with deformation--Spherical Cows
don't deform.  They are perfectly spherical.

A ball bearing might do terrible damage to a flimsy satellite.
A grain of sand wouldn't.  At around 20km/s, a grain of sand
only has about as much kinetic energy as a 9mm bullet.
If you hit a flimsy satellite with a grain of sand, you might
damage something that stops it from working properly,
but it's not going to blow it to smithereens.

Of course, if you're specifically ramming a particular target
you can release the sand just before impact and ensure a
whole bunch of them hit the victim.  But otherwise, there's
a heck of a lot of space in Earth orbit.

A warning: Gundam is long on politics and giant robots fighting.  Very
little time is devoted to the experience of living in orbital habitats.  It
merely serves as a backdrop.  One can scarcely tell the difference between

&gt;&gt;Web surfing on habs using centrifugal force I repeatedly came across
&gt;&gt;Gundam. Some of the Gundam writers seem to have done more homework than
&gt;&gt;usual. I've been wanting to order it on Netflix.

&gt; A warning: Gundam is long on politics and giant robots fighting.  Very
&gt; little time is devoted to the experience of living in orbital habitats.  It
&gt; merely serves as a backdrop.  One can scarcely tell the difference between
&gt; when the action is taking place on Earth, or in a space habitat.

Depends on the Gundam series. There are sequences where the
differences are not only noticeable, but fairly important to the
action, especially in the earlier ones.

And then there are sequences where the writers try to get the
differences between habitats and Earth, they really do, but they get
things completely wrong.  Like the on the Gundam series where the
baddies cut the mirror panels off of a rotating O'neil Torus, and the
panels just drift straight forward along the axis of the habitat, no
rotational velocity at all.

Next to that, even the character interactions seemed believable.  ;')
