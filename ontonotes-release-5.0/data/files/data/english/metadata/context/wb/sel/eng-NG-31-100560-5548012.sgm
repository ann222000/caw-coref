THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS DARKLY: IMPOSSIBLE CREATURES
Many parts of the world have enjoyed the curious distinction of
harboring mysterious creatures which have captivated the minds of
investigators, the so-called "monster-hunters", and others interested in the
subject. Some of these creatures are the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, the
elusive Yetis of the Himalayan range, and the Australian "Yowies", among
others--examples of beings that elude the best human efforts aimed at their
capture.
Nonetheless, there are also unique creatures whose apparitions have
been documented during a certain time period, only to disappear without
leaving a trace, never to be seen again. This is the category occupied by
West Virginia's infamous "Mothman" and other lesser-known types.
Grant Callison, a resident of Galesburg, Illinois, knew something
beyond the realm of normal experience was transpiring when he saw three
winged beings flying in the night skies on May 10, 1968. From their kitchen,
Grant and his wife Wilma noticed that the beings, flying at an estimated
altitude of 500 feet, were covered in feathers or metallic scales of some
sort which acquired an odd fluorescence as they reflected light from the
local street lamps. The trio of flyers lacked necks and had short, conical
tails. "It was an incredible and frightening sight," according to the
witnesses.
This was not to be Callisons only sighting either: a few days later,
while visiting with relatives, Grant's brother Ward Callison asked if they
had seen anything unusual several nights earlier. After hearing the account
of his brother's sighting, Ward admitted having seen the very same creatures
following a northeasterly trajectory that went over their house. His
description of the enigmatic beings coincided with Grant's down to the
smallest details.
Five months later, and at the same time of night, another "giant bird"
or "winged being" flew directly over Grant and Wilma. The couple noticed
that this particular creature appeared to have some sort of difficulty with
its right wing, which was kept rigid and several degrees below the left one
(it had a 15 to 20 foot wingspan). The flying creature appeared to take
notice of the two humans, and fixed its gaze on them as it flew away. "That
really scared us," Grant confessed, "and we went inside the house for the
rest of the evening." In the Callisons' opinion, the creatures were
naturally not native to this world, implying that their origin had to be
extraterrestrial or extradimensional. The couple had not heard of Mothman's
forays in West Virginia, nor did they ever see the flying creatures again.
This weird succession of experiences was collected by researcher Thomas
Adams for his Stigmata magazine. Perhaps the Callisons would have been put
at ease by the fact that an anonymous young sailor in the Italian navy
during World War II, had shared a similar experience, which was later
investigated by Sergio Conti of Italy's Giornale del Misteri. While the
battleship Duilio was anchored at the port of Toscana in 1945, the sailor
looked up from his post on the ship's bridge at something in the skies which
drew his attention. From a distance, it clearly resembled a formation of
migrating birds flying in a "V" formation, following the leader in perfect
alignment. Having nothing better to do, the sailor reached for a pair of
binoculars and was treated to an unexpected sight. The birds turned out to
be flying humans endowed with powerful wings, heading toward the battleship
in a steady glide. Their faces were entirely human, and the leader,
occupying the vertex of the "V", appeared to be engaged in conversation with
his companion on the right. The massive wings were strangely motionless, and
their legs ended in powerful, three-toed claws. Their bodies were entirely
covered in feathers except for their faces. The sailor abandoned his post in
order to find a witnesses to the amazing sight, but when he returned, the
creatures had predictably disappeared.
Another instance of creatures seen only once and never again can be
found in the case of orang minyak, "the oily man", who terrorized the
residents of the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, in the early 1960's. Carys
Evans, a student in a Malaysian school at the time, remembers the panic
created by stories of such a creature, which was allegedly endowed with
supernatural powers. Orang minyak had the physical appearance of a human
covered in oil, and "was impossible to capture due to the ability to
literally slip and slide out of the hands of his captors," according to
Evans. The "oily man" was allegedly responsible for a considerable number of
rapes.
British author Harold Wilkins mentioned a pair of truly enigmatic
creatures in his book Flying Saucers on the Attack, one of ufology's early
classics. In mid-February 1953, the administrator of a Los Angeles law firm
dedicated to tracking missing persons stated that two weird-looking men,
standing 6'2", who had been given temporary work by the firm's legal
director, had vanished without a trace. The administrator went on to say
that the emaciated pair, clad in ill-fitting clothes and
with bluish-green complexions, also had prick ears of the sort seen on
certain breeds of dogs.
On January 20, 1953, these two men were given an assignment to help in
the tracing of missing persons. Their efficiency in this endeavor was such
that the other tracers were astounded. The administrator also noted that on
one occasion, one of the beings leaned over the top of a steel cabinet and
scored an indentation at least a half inch deep on its surface, using his
"oddly curved hand" to do so.
Wilkins' description of the entities doesn't stop there: both
creatures had jointless hands and wrists of decidedly non-human curvature.
The law firm thought it best to notify the FBI, but the strange pair had
disappeared before the agents arrived on the scene. Aside from the testimony
of the firm's administrator and legal director, the only evidence left
behind by the creatures was the furrow in the steel filing cabinet, which
was taken to a metallurgical chemist for analysis. The chemist's report
stated that a pressure of at least two thousand pounds per square inch would
have been necessary to produce such an indentation.
It is worth noting that mystery beings belonging to no particularly
definable group have been with us since the earliest days of human history,
standing out on account of their very uniqueness, such as the Minotaur of
Greek mythology.
The writings of Roman chroniclers such as Aulus Gelius, Julius
Obsequens, and Pliny the Elder often mention extraordinary creatures--almost
always vaguely humanoid--whose sudden appearance would spread fear among the
population and which were considered to be harbingers of great changes or
disasters. The Aztec chronicles echo this sentiment in the description of
the Tlacantzollis or "divided men" who were captured and taken to emperor
Montezuma's house of sorcery, where the beings vanished before the startled
eyes of the monarch and his courtiers. More recently, according to the July
1993 issue of Uruguay's Paradigmas magazine, the residents of the community
of Rivera, located to the north Montevideo, the nation's capital, lived in
terror of a creature resembling the legendary werewolf, especially after two
attacks were reported. The first victim was attacked at night, when she got
off work. The wolf creature, denominated lobizón by the locals, tore her
dress and ran its claws across her chest, leaving deep claw marks. The
second victim, who has also chosen to remain anonymous in the face of the
"deep shame" she has experienced, was apparently sexually assaulted by the
lobizón.
The local police went to great lengths to deny the existence of any
supernatural creatures, and have cast doubt even upon the injured victims'
suffering. The eldest residents of the area, however, made the sign of
the cross whenever the subject was broached and even recited a number of
prayers whose purpose was that of warding off the evil creature.
The legendary Springheel Jack, whose apparition at the beginning and
at the end of the 19th century created a stir in Victorian England, also
falls into this category. The degree of fear caused by this unknown entity
was such that even the eldery Duke of Wellington, who vanquished Napoleon at
Waterloo, rode out at night with two pistols in hopes of dispatching the
Public Enemy Number One of his time. The Red Man, whose visits to King
Charles of Sweden and to Napoleon himself marked crucial moments in the
lives of both monarchs, also appears to have been another card in the deck
of strange beings. But the question still remains unanswered: Who or what
are these mysterious creatures?
Spanish researcher Salvador Freixedo described a singular case, which
revolved around the love affair between a well-to-do Venezuelan woman named
Lula and thoroughly unusual man known only as Jorge, in his book La Granja
Humana. After a courtship laden with supernatural events, the couple
married, and
the strange man proved to be a wonderful husband, although he remained
particularly adamant about discussing his origins, relatives or livelyhood.
Lula jokingly accused him of not being human--a charge which Jorge never
really denied. For her peace of mind and that of her relatives, he said that
he was the son of Argentinian immigrants and the owner of a small printing
shop that never seemed to transact any business. The couple's friends
testified to Jorge's astounding powers of precognition--he could accurately
fortell the future to the extent of adjusting his behavior beforehand. He
possessed superhuman physical prowess, doing things that would have proven
lethal for a normal person. Jorge would go to
