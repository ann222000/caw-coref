Trouble with map displaying correctly...

This is my first attempt at embedding the API into a site, and I have
run into this problem right off the bat:

I copied the HTML from the generated API Key page and it worked fine:

However... when I go to insert it into the template I've made for this
site (copied the HEAD tags and other entries verbatim) it crashes the
page load in IE 6 and breaks the image alignment in FF. I'm sure this
is some simple problem I'm overlooking...

Let me know please...

IE enforces the rule that Javascript is not permitted inside tables or
other containers.

The safe places to put your Javascript are in the header called by an
onload() function, or just before the &lt;/body&gt;

wb,

It looked fine to me in Mozilla. Did you already figure out the problem
and fix it?

The thing that's causing your template layout to break is the fact that
you're now using a strict DOCTYPE.

If you take your existing index page, with no Google API on it at all,
and just change the DOCTYPE from its current HTML 4.01 Transitional
doctype to XHTML 1.0 Strict, then you'll find that the layout alignment
has been broken.

You either need to rewrite your template in accordance with XHTML 1.0,
or put back the HTML 4.01 doctype and hope that the Google map doesn't
break too badly. From what I've seen other on other people's pages, the
Google stuff seems to look OK with the HTML 4.01 doctype, but the
documentation says that the XHTML doctype makes &quot;layout and behaviors
much more predictable across browsers&quot;.

Excellent! Thanks for all the pointers, I should have known about
changing the Doctypes, but as I'm sure many of you know when hunting
bugs the obvious can elude you.

Thanks Again!

Ok, time for me to show my n00biness, what would be the correct syntax
to execute the onload() command?

tks much.

&lt;body onload=&quot;onLoad();&quot;&gt;

Caveat: DO NOT NAME the function onload() as that will cause a real
headache. Just call it anything else. onLoad is ok because it is case
sensitive.

Sweet, tks much. In the meantime I also experimented with wrapping it
in an &lt;IFRAME&gt; tag and that worked out pretty well. Anything I should
keep in mind with this setup?

setup looks good, i would add controls to change from satellite to
hybrid to street map...

map.addControl(new GMapTypeControl());

and maybe add one marker in the middle so people have an idea what they
are looking for (although the center of the map is obvious, but
still...)

var marker = new GMarker(new GPoint(long, lat));
map.addOverlay(marker);
