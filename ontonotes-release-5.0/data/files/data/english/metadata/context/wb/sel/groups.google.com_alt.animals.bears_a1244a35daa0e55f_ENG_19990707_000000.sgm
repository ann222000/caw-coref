<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;Can anyone tell me the correct manner in which to greet a bear?
&gt;Being a true English gentleman from the 14th century I obviously raise my
&gt;top-hat and lick my eyelids when coming into contact with beasts of another
&gt;species or dimension to myself but I feel due to their much higher standards
&gt;of conduct, the bear may find this to be rude or insulting.
&gt;Is there a form or questionnaire I must fill out as is the case with
&gt;dolphins, or is it purely a case of saving a bear life and ultimately being
&gt;accepted into their numbers as was the case with B.A. Baracus.
&gt;Does smelling of fresh cut wood (such as oak or pine) put me at any
&gt;disadvantage and leave me prone to attack?
&gt;As soon as bears are invented I wish to be one of the first to learn their
&gt;hairy, big clawed, rip your arm off, ways of living.

I usually roll myself in salmon, sanitary napkins and elf dung. Then, in the
cover of the night, run screaming through the woods. If you are lucky enough
to encounter a bear simply bow at the waist and attempt to pass gas. If the
bear is interested in a relationship he will let you know in short order. In
prior centuries and many other dimensions, bears, as you noted, don't really
exist. In the case of non-existant bears the same formula holds true, but it is
usually some sort of hill-billy or other devilish creature of the night that
you will encounter. Substitute the scrapings of sheep uterus for the elf dung
and proceed as usual. By the way, smelling of fresh cut wood (such as oak or
pine) doesn't (contrary to popular belief) leave one prone to attack, but it
does create a festive mood. good luck!
