My 5 yr old fights going to bed every night.  I would love to get him to
bed earlier, but even if we start his bedtime routine early, he still
holds off till 9-10 for bed time.  I get up at 4:45 for work, and 6
hours of sleep or less does not cut it.  Any advice for encouraging
going to bed?

Get him tired, and then him fall asleep on you and sleep with you.
Warm milk and carbs helps too.

What we used to do is turn off lights off and turn down the TV till
we could just barely hear it, and then get everybody in pajamas and
bring pillows and blankets to the couch and have them crawl up on
us and massage them. They go right out like a light, and after they
start to snore deeply we'd carry them to bed (which was in our room
when they were young, their "bedroom" was all playroom) and tuck
them in, and if they woke up later we were right there and they
passed right out again.

In the early morning start making kitchen and breakfast noises and
good smells like toast and bacon and butter and eggs frying and
coffee. Then go wave it under their nose to get them awake a little
earlier. Doesn't hurt to give them some coffee or tea either.

Never force them or try to con them, they resent it and then you
have other problems.

Just work it like you'd have to to get a bunch of adults up or to
bed on time, make it all voluntary, but with happy inducements.

You're just a fundie moron who's ashamed of sexuality. Many of
us are QUITE different from you. Our kids saw us fucking from
their earliest age and they grew up advanced and with an adult

people were raised as they were, and couldn't see how others
could ever learn to have sex properly just out of books! They
at first didn't even believe us when we tried to inform them
of how some of you freaks live! They believed we were just

We used to fuck on the couch on Saturday mornings, and one morning

somewhere else if you're going to be so noisy?" He was 4 and his

I have same problems.  I either put my boy in our bed and this is a
novelty for him he thinks he's very important.  He falls asleep soon
after then when I go to bed I just transfer him to his own.  He is 7
so very heavy but worth it to get him in bed early.  Other times if he
gets up I let him stay for 5 minutes then he goes back with no fuss.
Again he feels like he's getting a good deal.  And sometimes if I'm
really tired myself I just say I am going to bed too and the whole
house will be dark and he has no choice.

Best of luck.  Being a boy does he need Dad to get growly with him?
Dad's seem to be more effective when it comes to boundary setting.

-----------------
More effective at damaging children, and wives, and marriages, and
lives generally. There is no boundary violation here, he is expecting
and hoping for what children ARE SUPPOSED TO GET! It's CRUCIAL for
a child to feel "special". That is how he comes to regard himself
with respect and not self-deprecation and ill-self-worth! Children
have genuine fears of abandonment, they EVOLVED to be that way for a
REASON, to keep the attention of their adult parents because they
are quite literally endangered when ALONE! When you pretend you
should just be able to fob him off somewhere else for awhile or get
him to go leave you alone just because you want to rest, all YOU'RE
doing is manifesting YOUR immaturity and neediness that YOU never
got met by YOUR parents!! Grow the fuck up!

Yes, I know your fixation, you superstitious sickies imagine it isn't.
Unfortunately, nothing in your view makes any sense or is provable.
And you have no actual way to support your view, except a made-up
antisexual mysticism that isn't in any way demonstrable as truth.

Species have been having sex in front of their offspring for a VERY
very long time now, and there are VERY SUBSTANTIAL counter-examples
in human cultures that demonstrate unequivocably that it isn't and
could not BE damaging. Nor can anyone even think of a good reason
WHY it COULD be!! This is the most instructive feature of your
superstitious mythology that is only found in western culture.

Meaning they did things others didn't like. The fact remains that
some ways in which people may deviate are damaging, while others
are improvements in human behavior, and you may find both in any
situation and you will not be able to show a causal relation by
such confused multivariate causations. To do that you would have
to clearly separate these variables to eliminate spurious causes.

The Papuan people's do that, always have, and they're not crazy.
They're extremely peaceful people who play their erotic version
of cricket and then celebrate with orgies.

But being Xtian Fundie missionaries in the FIRST place is proof
that his parents were fucking nuts, and that whatever they were
doing, they did it WRONG. Xtian Fundies do that a lot. And anything
can be done WRONG, but so can it be done RIGHT!

Lots of broken people do all sorts of things that deviate from the
norm of their upbringing, but not all the things they do are wrong
or cause harm. They ate in front of their children too, and you're
not claiming THAT is damaging, which means you're being suspiciously
selective of what you wish to declare as causational!!

For me to tolerate wrongness would be foolish. Alao calling my
cross-cultural analysis that employs reason, "radical" or "far-out"
with respect to nothing more than the arbitrary culture that was
handed you by nit-wits is the height of the meaning of intolerance.
Given the facts, namely that humans do quite different things in
this regard, and without apparent harm, leads the reasonable analyzer
to the conclusion that we can adopt improved customs as we wish as
long as we provide the support systems that the originating cultures
use along with them, or else better ones that we contrive with full
awareness of the nature of the adopted customs. Culture and custom
is in no way magic, remember, and it USUALLY is changed on no more
than whims and fancies in terms of fad and societal change in customs,
while reason and planning do far better.

It sounds like your 5 yr old has got in a late routine. Is he aware of

is like this, he checks to see if it is 8.00pm.   I take him upstairs
about 6.30 and let him soak in the bath for a while then read stories
while he sits in bed, (this makes him sleepy).   If he comes down,
which he sometimes does(not as much as he used to) I just whisper
"back to bed" and take him back without interacting too much but
keeping my manner soft, then kiss him goodnight and tell him not to
get out of bed again.    He used to have night tantrums when he was
younger because he didn't want to go to sleep on his own.  He is much
happier about it now.

be the harm if you did? I don't see any, besides maybe making your kids
note that you're really nervous and uncomfortable about sex even while
trying to perform it for them like a dinner theater. We were never
uncomfortable about sex in front of them because we did it every day
from day one of their life, and they thought it was totally and
completely normal! When we explained to them, as they got older, that
not everyone had sex in front of their kids, they were totally puzzled,
and at first they thought we were joking and leading them on for fun,
which we we often did to teach them critical thinking!

If sexuality and watching sexuality bores you, then you're not doing

---------------------------
Your fixation on sexual performance with an audience is clouding
your mind. Kids don't even know what you're doing or care much till
later. And until the day they notice one day that it involves genitals
they don't realize it is much different than wrestling around for
fun. And if you've been doing it right along and have never shown
shame about your genitals, then your kids see your genitals the same
way they see your arms or legs or fingers, with no special shame or
guilt or attention attached. If something isn't conspicuously absent,
then kids don't focus on it unduly. But doing things like forcing them
to clothe their genitals, and doing the same with yours, these sorts
of conspicuous absences that go undiscussed are extremely hurtful and
shaming to children, making them feel about their genitals as they
might be taught to feel about a horrible guilty family secret like
non-consensual sexual abusive.

Seeing you having fun together makes them feel safe and protected
and comforts them that their parents are well-bonded and that you'll
be together for them indefinitely. To our experience, sex that they
have become used to they usually ignore or sleep through, while
noting it as a pleasant life fact for later in the back of their
mind. The mistake lots of adults in western culture make is imagining
that seeing sex will make them overly interested in sex, when actually,
kids, before they acquire their own sexual drives at age 8 or 9 or so,
have no interest in it, as it doesn't make their genitals react in
a specifically sexual way.

To you I may not be sexually liberal.  Where is the rule book that
says I have to set my standards by yours?  I'm quite comfortable with
my own sexuality.  I enjoy wonderful, audible orgasms.  Some of which
have woken my son up in the next room.  I don't feel ashamed or
embarrased.  It's not a bad thing for a boy to hear his mother express
herself.  I walk around naked and I don't move to cover myself up if
my son can see.  Hell he's 7 and we sometimes still shower together if
I need to scrub the ingraned dirt off his feet.  It's not a problem.
He's normal, I'm normal and according to my standards, you're not.
According to your standards I  am abnormal.  I'm never going to change
your mind and you will never change mine.  The End.

You're merely fixated and deluded. You are acting exactly like a

what this society does when it brainwashes people, it shames them
with religious dogma, without religious arguments, in fact without
ANY arguments, AT ALL. In fact the Fundies have discovered they can
shame you out of behaviors and ideas that frighten them WITHOUT
giving you any of their illogical "reasons" for it!

That's just plain phony.
Only lying weasels and cowardly women are duplicitous in order

her social acceptance!

No. Not if your position is not reasonably defensible. If we permitted

--------------------------
Is that supposed to be a reasonable argument? Sounds like you would
ban children from seeing all the things they haven't seen yet. That
sort of precludes education and everything they need to grow as people.

To argue that reasonably you would have to argue that seeing sex in
some magical mysterious way HARMS them, and you won't be able to do
so reasonably!! Nobody I have ever talked with has ever managed to.
Nor can *I* even think how to go about it, and I can outthink

doesn't.

Agreed. I'm glad you've progressed THAT far at least!

But then why not SEE said activity? What is this magical mysterious
reason that sight is precluded while hearing is not? You won't be able

No it's not the end. You can run away if you like but you have no

No one here said anyone was worthless.

It is a simple fact that we can't change who we are because we ARE
who we are, but that others can change us by what they say to us,
because their words introduce us to new information which is the
ONLY thing with the potential to change our minds, and that we

-------------------------
Why? It makes you look really stupid!

Unfree? Nobody can even BE "unfree". There is no such thing as FreeWill,
because whatever we think, and therefore what we do, is CAUSED, caused
by the sum total of our previous experiences in order and our initial
chemistry. Nor is this specifically materialist. Though I'ma physicist,
most physicists hold that the phenomenon of existence is unified, and
non-concrete, it is perceptual, not material. A belief in concrete
"atoms" is not required, atoms are only models, nothing more. But we
do know that what we think is caused because it does not change for
little or no reason, the reason can always be located and stated, and
further, we know that we cannot change our mind by an effort of will,
unless we are destined to do so, and that THEN, such a change is ALSO
equally INVOLUNTARY to us! We cannot, by any effort of will/whim,
change the tiniest thing that we believe! We can lie about it, if
that is our destiny, but then we are ALSO unable to change that!!

Right now, change the tiniest thing you truly believe by nothing more

Nonsense, i tell you what I see. If you were not bad off I could
not tell you so. Your effort here is to disingenuously dispute
your state by alleging the bearer of the tidings is somehow corrupt.
That would be your easy way out, which is why it doesn't work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Are you coming from a place of genuine concern for

Both. Like all humans, I desire to see others do better, for them

------------------------------------
He is using a slightly different dictionary. To him your "choice"
is a process over which you have no personal conscious control.
I would never use words that way, because I think it confuses
people like you.

And conditioning is an imposed program from outside to alter behavior
without regard for the change in mental content that is required to
cause the behavior change.

------------------------------
I can, unless they are wrong. Any wrongness in our common shared

Nope. And neither has anyone else. How do I know this? Simple:

If you like theistic explanations, try this:

If there were God, He would know that no rumor of his existence
SHOULD be believed second-hand, lest the wrong God by acknowledged.
He would have to concede that we shouldn't be expected to believe
what may be only lies and rumors, at best, and vicious untruths
about Him at worst.

Therefore, he would tell all of us, or none of us.

Having not heard from Him, I conclude that either there isn't any,
or it isn't interested, and in either case, those who pretend to speak
with Him are just lying to acquire power and charisma.

Now if He's more devious with us than that, wanting it to be some
magical guessing game, where you can only win accidentally, then he
doesn't know his own creation very well, now, do He?

Or else He's not worth worshipping, because He can't be trusted.

Now I don't bother with "Gawd", because Gawd doesn't bother with us.

I'm dispassionately agnostic about such a stupid backward notion as
Gawd, which resembles nothing so much as a medieval king and court,
obviously our creation.

But that is a way to describe the situation for a theist.

Why you no listen?  The god concept is bogus. If people tell me

What I talk of is freaky things that must have happened to you that

The way it is currently used is bogus. The fact remains that we
don't know how we got here, but we feel like we were "dropped off",
and that we'll be "picked up" someday, and that we have no control
of either how we got here, or what happens when "here" is over, and
that this was and will be done by something far more powerful than
ourselves.

It doesn't matter what you call it, God or Existence or "I Am That
I Am" (I am Being Itself"). Nor can we prove that there isn't something
beyond what we call death here that we will experience. Since these
total possibilities are endless, and the limits of the conceivable also
seem infinite, every possible occurence is not merely possible, but
within this Infinity it CAN be said to DEFINITELY HAPPEN! It is possible
that we have an Infinite number of outcomes for every instant!

This is the Many Worlds Model of Quantum Mechanics. Determinism merely
says that any one outcome is unary, that is, must be taken one at a
time. And once in that instant, it was always the one that we were
"destined" to experience, though not necessarily planned in advance.

Oh, me too. But that isn't in any way akin to what I'm saying.

One of the features to intelligence is that we don't fathom its
depth or grasp all the ways it works. If it seems like something
is talking to us, it's a cinch that in ALL cases, it is most likely
that we are merely hearing another layer or facet of our own being.

Good "psychics" can cold-read others so well as to convince them that
something "supernatural" is going on, when it isn't! The Amazing Randi
for example, is able to duplicate John Edwards' "psychic powers" by
simple strategies and procedures that are quite obvious when described.
Randi is actually a scientist exploring these ignorant misperceptions
and debunking such clowns.
