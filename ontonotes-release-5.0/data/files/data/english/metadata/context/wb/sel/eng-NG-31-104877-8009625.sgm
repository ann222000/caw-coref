Floods strike Britain; Thames rising
By KIRSTY WIGGLESWORTH, Associated Press Writer 4 minutes ago

TEWKESBURY, England - Emergency workers rescued hundreds of trapped
people Monday as water swallowed swaths of central England in the
worst flooding to hit the country for 60 years. Officials said some
rivers were still rising, with the western section of the rain-swollen
River Thames on the verge of bursting its banks.

Roads and parking lots were submerged, trains suspended, buses
canceled. Hundreds of thousands of people were without electricity or
drinking water, and farmers saw their summer crops destroyed.

Torrential rains have plagued Britain over the past month - nearly 5
inches fell in some areas on Friday alone - and more downpours were
predicted this week.

&quot;This emergency is far from over and further flooding is extremely
likely,&quot; Environment Secretary Hilary Benn told lawmakers in the House
of Commons.

On the outskirts of Oxford, 60 miles west of London, about 50 elderly
people were evacuated to a stadium from a retirement community
overlooking the swollen River Ock.

&quot;People look at me and say I look fine, but inside I'm all churned
up,&quot; said Sylvia Williams, a 69-year-old widow among the evacuees.

The stadium was stocked with blankets, food and bedding for up to
1,500 people in case the Thames burst its banks. Flood defenses in the
center of the town - home to the renowned 800-year-old university -
were holding so far, but Thames water levels were not expected to peak
until midnight.

The worst-hit areas Monday were farther west, where cars were
submerged and streets turned into canals. Thousands of people were
forced to leave their homes and businesses, as rescue workers in
helicopters and dinghies scooped stranded residents onto dry land.

The Ministry of Defense said military helicopters rescued more than
120 people from the rising floodwaters, including 87 people trapped in
a trailer park in Gloucestershire county, central England.

Among the hardest hit areas was the medieval market town of
Tewkesbury, 110 miles northwest of London, where the cathedral and a
few blocks of nearby houses stood like an atoll in a vast stretch of
muddy water that stood 5 feet deep in places.

&quot;It was just devastation - total chaos, cars floating past, rubbish,
all kinds,&quot; said John King, a 68-year-old retired firefighter from
Tewkesbury. &quot;You just can't stop water of that power.

He said he saw goldfish swimming in his driveway.

Some residents lined up for free water at local grocery stores, while
others took to canoes and small boats to ferry food and water to
housebound residents.

The last time Britain saw similar flooding was in 1947, according to
the Environment Agency. No deaths or serious injuries have been
reported in the current flooding.

The Severn Trent Water company said at least 350,000 homes in
Gloucestershire, in western England, were without water after flooding
shut down a water treatment plant.

The Ministry of Defense said water was being cleared after flooding at
a nuclear weapons-manufacturing site at Burghfield, about 40 miles
west of London. Officials said there was no risk of a radiation leak.

London itself was not affected. The city is protected from flooding in
the east by the Thames Barrier, the world's largest moveable flood
defense, which closes to seal off part of the upper Thames from the
sea.

To the west, London is protected by several flood defense measures
including the Jubilee River, a 7-mile-long diversion channel. The
western section of the Thames that officials worried about lies 80
miles from the capital.

During a tour of the Gloucestershire region, Prime Minister Gordon
Brown announced increased funding for flood and coastal defenses
across the country.

&quot;It is pretty clear that some of the 19th-century structures and
infrastructure and where they were sited is something we will have to
review,&quot; said Brown, who succeeded Tony Blair less than a month ago.
Much of Britain's infrastructure dates to Victorian times.

Insurance companies said the damage from flooding in June and July
could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.

The British weather was consistent with conditions caused by the La
Nina weather system, which is caused by cooling ocean waters and leads
to extreme weather, Britain's Meteorology Office said. However,
scientists said there was no clear explanation for the unusually long
spell of wet weather.

&quot;The situation is looking critical at the moment. Unfortunately the
misery is set to continue,&quot; said Environment Agency spokesman Joe
Giacomelli.

Climate change may be culprit, said Tim Evans of the Chartered
Institution of Water and Environment Management, adding that the
situation matched predictions of how global warning would affect
Britain.

Britain had one of its hottest and driest summers on record last year.

&quot;What we now think of as extreme events will occur more often than in
the past, and the extremes will get more extreme,&quot; Evans said.

They evacuated 50 elderly people? I bet that got messy!

Different language, Tom.  You should stick
