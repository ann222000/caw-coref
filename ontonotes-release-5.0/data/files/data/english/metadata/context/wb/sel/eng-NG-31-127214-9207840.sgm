ON this team?   Anything is possible and even the impossible seems to
be possible.  Games they should win, they lose. Games they should
lose, they win.  Not all of it is Nolan's fault, but he is the HC so
he has to shoulder the blame.

I actually think Nolan started taking the team into the right
direction

we have seemed   ok in our division we have clean swept each of our
foes every year he's been the head coach. i was really looking forward
to this year. I was excited about Darrel Jackson, i was thrilled with
Nate and i was happy about Tully and Franklin...

I was thrilled again that we won our two games and then the 8 game
losing streak started... I don't want anyone to get fired but i am
very intrigued by what somebody else could do with the team... I think
there is so much going on that it's hard to just blame one person...
If it was just Smiths fault and just Nolan's then that would be
easy... but it seems everything sucks and there are to many things
wrong with it in my humble opinion...

Isn't it amazing?  The struggling teams or so called  bad teams all of a sudden
get well when they play the 49ers. Perfect example yesterdays game.  Carolina no
wins or touchdowns at home this year.
