Hi, Last Wednesday I had my 2nd surgery for urilogical problems. I
don't quite have BPH, but do have all the symptoms such as frequent
urgency, weak stream, hesitancy before going, getting up each night 4
or 5 times etc etc. My urologist (in San Francisco) did a TUIP at
first, in November. It worked initially and then reversed itself to
where my symptoms were worse than before the surgery. He thought there
might be some scar tissue that had built up and further blocked my
urethra. He suggested a cystoscopy with further surgery if needed and
said it would be the Holmium laser.

I had this surgery and no one communicated anything to me afterwards.
I had a catheter in me for a while and they wanted it taken out before
I went home. I took it out, but couldn't pee so they put it back in
and left it in overnight. The next day I went back to the doctor to
take it out and ask him about the surgery since no one told me
anything the day before, or called me that night to ask how I was.
(what is happening to our medical doctors that they don't care enought
to follow up on you? I am amazed!) When I inquired about the results
of the surgery, he gave me a brief explanation of what happened and I
asked him why he didn't use that laser in the first place instead of
the TUIP. Then, he hesitated and admitted that he actually didn't use
the Holmium laser, but used the KTP laser instead. I asked why and he
said that there was a part missing from the Holmium laser and he had
to switch. First of all, is that ok to do? All written documents
stated he was going to be using a non-contact procedure involving the
Holmium laser.

In any event, it has been 4 days since my surgery and I have had no
relief. In fact, my symptoms are worse. I pee every 15 to 20 minutes
and my stream is so weak that it is dribbling out. I am really upset
that this is happening. Everything I read says that KTP should have
immediate relief.

Can anyone tell me what a patient is supposed to experience after a
KTP laser surgery and if what I am going thru is normal? What should I
expect?

Thanks,

Scott
