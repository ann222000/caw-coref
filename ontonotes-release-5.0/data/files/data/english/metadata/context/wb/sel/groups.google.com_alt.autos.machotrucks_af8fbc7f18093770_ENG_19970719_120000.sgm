Dear First Mom,

Thank you for your television comercial on parenting. Being a
parent with three children, I didnt know it was work raising children.
Silly Me!! I just thought it was acts of love. Thank you for
enlighting me on this subject. Now that you have cleared that up.
Maybe you can clear this up. With the liberal media repeatively
informing me on how smart you are, I just wonder why? Is it that you
are the first socialist
liberal woman that reads their lies and to belive that they are so? Or
is it that you are the first socialist liberal woman that can read?
I was told that: when you go anywhere there are more secret service
agents guarding you than all the presidents ever had altogether
combined. When I inquired about that the answer I was told was this -
the secret service is afraid that if anything happens to you, Bill
Clinton becomes president. Is that true?
If I dont recive any answers from you in a day or two, I'll asume
that you did'nt have a chance to read your e-mail. So, I will post this
letter, on some www home pages, with any luck you might run across this
letter.

Sincerly yours,

R.E.H.
