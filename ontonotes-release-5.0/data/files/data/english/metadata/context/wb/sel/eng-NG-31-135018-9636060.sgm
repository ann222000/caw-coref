Need a fast response to this one if anybody knows the solution. I have just
been given three very old b/w negatives. They aren't numbered or identified
in any way so, which side should be facing down in my scanner? The silvery
side or the glossy side?

The silvery side should face down, toward the sensor and away from the
scanner's light source.
