[Sorry if this is the wrong group to ask... I couldn't find any other
newsgroup with experts in the subject area.]

Which of today's manufacturers are creating furniture that will appreciate
in value? My wife and I are considering some reproductions from
henkel-harris, but it's amazingly expensive. (We really like the rice-bed
and the armoire.) If I'm going to sink this amount of money into furniture,
I'd like my kid to be able enjoy it. Is the quality there? Will it be an
antique someday? Or will today's &quot;contemporary&quot; furniture be the antiques?

Again, sorry if it's the wrong group.

Thanks,
Lee

I believe that you are going to have to ask Mr. McKin ... @netcom.co.uk .
Apparently,he has the answer to every question and a great website with
pictures of everything of any value ever produced. This is his newsgroup
and the r.a stands for Ronnie Answers. If you upset him, it stands for
Ronnie Attacks. So,be nice.
I can't begin to tell you what I've learned from him.
ciao,

"/>  Well-constructed furniture always has been expensive. An
original Charleston &quot;rice&quot; bed was not affordable by any but the
wealthy.

If I were going to buy reproductions, I would buy those made
from the appropriate hardwoods, with lots of hand detailing, and
a minimum of trendy features and bastard styles.

I am an interior designer and will offer this advice. Learn something about
furniture construction, ask vendors for construction detail, and then buy
things that are worth it to you. Appreciate in value? It will depreciate
at least 50% the day it is delivered to you, but if you take good care of
well-made furniture, even if your children may not want it, your
grandchildren may appreciate it. Just like many items offered as antiques,
I always say buy it if it is worth the price to you, because there are more
fakes than real by now.
Tsu Dho Nimh ( I actually just got that pun!) makes a good point about at
least buying *genuine* repros that are very close to originals in material
and detail. That doesn't mean I recommend a 3/4 bed as a lit matrimoniale,
but often does mean that king is too big for a tester bed unless you occupy
a castle. It also often means not buying sets of repro furniture for your
rooms, but buying repros of things which are more comfortable now, such as
beds and sofas, and using them with as many genuinely old pieces as you can
afford. Use some real oriental rugs, and something is bound to be good about
that mix, if only your own pleasure in it.
Don't worry about tomorrows antiques, Today's &quot;antiques&quot; are enough of a
worry.
20th century classic designs are holding up well except in the case where
fine finishes are flaking off metal bits or where artificial materials are
losing integrity and cannot easily be replaced or repaired. When they
become valuable enough, someone will come up with an answer. Styles
associated with a particular designer of merit are appreciating better
(predictably) than run of the mill, factory-made trend items.

I'll go out on a limb as a former interior decorator and say look at Harden and
Baker furniture. Both are high quality makers of reproduction furniture using
hardwoods and appropriate methods. Your grandkids may not want them, but they
will still be in great condition for that generation. Stay away from
Thomasville. It just doesn't have the quality it once had. This is, of
course, my not no humble opinion.
