With my baby meter. So far have not smoked, not even the 4 which led
to this relapse and resetting the meter.
Well, the taste of metalic poison is less frequent on my tongue. The
compulsive coughing bordering on bronchitiis' finest has subsisted. I
certainly are kevetching about this with the old man. Every time he
lights up, I must declare: Are you about to light up a cigarette?
SHAME ON YOU!
These negative effects, all from 4 smokes after a 13 mo quit.
This really alarms me. It should alarm you.

Growing by leaps and bounds!!  Your meter is twice as big as it was
the last time I saw it.  Great start, Molly!!
We all need to be vigilant and protect our quits with every (clean)
breath we take.

It does alarm me. But I'm super proud of you.
And remember: Even the baby meters are very, very pretty -- and
something to be proud of.

Almost FWD already Molly, you are doing great!!!  Glad that the metallic
taste is less frequent.  I wonder if you should get the cough looked at by a
doctor, honey?  Keep on bugging the old man.  Diabetes and smoking is such a
no no.  I am proud of you, I don't think I would have quit if Steve hadn't
quit with me.

hugs and kisses

metallic taste could also be her teeth. peridontal disease is very common
amoung smokers and they won't even know it until the quit and the blood
vessels return to the gums.

That's a meter to be proud of Molly!
Six cigarettes in 6 days? Hmmm. I think the time is more important than the
amount not smoked. You're not going to be too impressed at the amount of
smokes you haven't smoked, so remember that any one cigarette to smoke will
be unacceptable.
We all get to that point. I think you're there too.

:-p~~~~~~~ Keven OOF
Don't ever forget why you quit.

It only takes one, eh!

I'm glad you caught yourself as early as you did -- I slipped at 3 weeks
with 3 cigarettes and reset the meter.  I knew at that point smoking was
no longer an option.

I'm *very* happy for you Molly!!

Cheers and Big Hugs,
Marvie
