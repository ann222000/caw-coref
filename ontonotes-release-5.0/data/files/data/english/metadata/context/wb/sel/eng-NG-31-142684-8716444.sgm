A Whole New World?
The climate debate could be changing.

Global warming is a complex issue to figure out, but one thing about
it is actually quite simple — discerning which side dominates the
debate right now. For the past year, those who view global warming as
a crisis justifying a major federal response have had just about
everything going in their favor.

Granted, the Bush administration continues to resist first-ever
mandatory limits on carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, but
the Democratically controlled Congress has introduced a number of
so-called cap-and-trade bills to do just that. Some of them have
bipartisan support. And many of the leading presidential candidates
have endorsed these efforts.

Several other factors, including a recent Supreme Court decision
compelling the Environmental Protection Agency to consider global
warming measures, as well as state and local efforts to bypass the
feds and impose their own controls, all seem to be forcing
Washington’s hand.

Meanwhile, the opposition to cap and trade seems to be collapsing. The
owners of the nation’s coal-fired power plants, manufacturing
facilities, and oil companies — until recently the most politically
powerful holdouts — have largely given up the fight. Most now see some
form of fossil-fuel rationing as inevitable, and several are actually
lobbying for cap-and-trade legislation in the hope that they can shape
it to their advantage.

Of course, the driving force behind all of this is the steady stream
of gloomy claims about global warming. Most recently, the U.N.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report received
widespread coverage as the smoking-gun evidence that mankind is
warming the planet to dangerously high levels. Al Gore’s Academy
Award-winning movie and accompanying bestseller, An Inconvenient
Truth, has also done much to hammer home the message.

The drumbeat continues as virtually every natural disaster that
occurs— from storms, to droughts, to floods, to wildfires, to disease
outbreaks— gets pinned on global warming. Even normal summer
temperatures sometimes get alarmist ink.

The frightening coverage has clearly shaped public opinion. Surveys
consistently show that a majority of Americans want their government
to do something about warming.

Taking all of this into account, there’s no question that
global-warming activists currently have the momentum. But momentum can
change, and on this issue there are reasons to believe it soon will.
It may well be that the prospects for the cap-and-trade bills are
peaking — before being enacted into law — and will begin to fall once
as the following factors come into focus.

China’s Great Leap Forward on Emissions.
A central part of the climate-change message has been the demonization
of America as the world’s top global-warming culprit. But that will
soon change, as China is close to surpassing the U.S. and becoming the
biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses. When this shift happens it will
have tremendous practical as well as symbolic significance, and it
will dim the appeal of unilateral U.S. action.

It is important to note that China isn’t slowly edging past America;
it is roaring ahead. Emissions of carbon dioxide, the byproduct of
fossil-fuel combustion and the greenhouse gas of greatest concern, are
exploding along with China’s economy. New coal-fired power plants are
reportedly being added in China at the rate of about one per week, and
these facilities are less efficient and higher-emitting than their
western counterparts. According to the Netherlands Environmental
Assessment Agency, which believes China has already surpassed America,
emissions in China rose 9-percent in 2006, on top of a 12-percent
increase in 2005. Meanwhile, America’s emissions have been growing
much more slowly, averaging little more than 1-percent per year. They
actually declined by 1.3-percent in 2006, according to the Department
of Energy.

The U.S. was easily the biggest emitter during the 20th century, but
future carbon-dioxide emissions will come less from American sources,
and more from Chinese ones. Even if the U.S. saddled itself with
economy-damaging energy constraints, it would barely begin to offset
China’s projected increases. But so far, China has adamantly refused
to agree to any controls, arguing that economic growth is their top
priority. Other fast-growing developing nations have said the same
thing.

Thus, notwithstanding questions about the seriousness of the
global-warming problem, any bills that single out U.S. emissions will
be a fast-shrinking part of the solution. As China’s emissions race
ahead of ours, Americans will begin to realize that unilateral action
is not the way to go.

The Failing Kyoto Protocol
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the multilateral global-warming treaty, is
still being touted as a great success. The Western European
governments that signed onto the treaty continue to congratulate
themselves for doing so while criticizing America for staying out.
Most climate activists here convey the same message. They hope to
convince Washington to make up for lost time by enacting one of the
Kyoto-like cap-and-trade bills currently under consideration.

But far from being a model to emulate, Kyoto is proving to be a
near-complete failure, and over time it is going to get more difficult
to conceal this fact.

For all their rhetoric, the European nations are well off track of
Kyoto’s requirement that emissions be 8-percent below 1990 levels
starting in 2008. Official European emissions data shows that nearly
every one of these countries has higher carbon-dioxide emissions today
than when the treaty was signed in 1997, and the emissions increases
show no signs of leveling off. The same is true of Canada, Japan, and
other major non-European signatories. In fact, most of these countries
are seeing their emissions rising faster than those in the U.S.

Pro-Kyoto Protocol activists and the media continue to heap praise on
the treaty for its carbon-emissions goals, but they rarely explore the
obvious question of whether these goals are actually being met. But
the failure to reduce emissions can’t remain a secret for much longer.
Once Kyoto reality sets in, it will deal a blow both to the treaty
itself and to any congressional efforts to mimic its approach.

The High Costs to Cool The Planet
The reason Kyoto Protocol signatories are not reducing their emissions
is that doing so is proving to be prohibitively costly. These nations
are learning the hard way what the Bush administration has understood
all along — that attempts to rapidly force down the fossil-fuel use
that provides the backbone of modern economies will be very expensive.
As costs enter into the debate, they could well prove to be a game
changer.

While inundating the public with scary stories about global warming’s
effects, the proponents of cap-and-trade have thus far said little
about the costs of combating the threat—and for good reasons. Their
agenda would inflict serious and noticeable economic pain long before
it would have even a modest impact on the earth’s future temperature.
Kyoto’s provisions, if fully implemented, would have cost Americans
hundreds of billions of dollars annually from higher energy prices,
but would, according to proponents, avert only 0.07 degrees Celsius of
global warming by 2050.

Given the Kyoto Protocol’s small impact on warming, many proponents
believe that the treaty should be just a first step towards much
stronger controls. But, as the European experience is showing, even
this first step is proving too costly and impractical.

It should be noted that the surveys indicating public support for
action on warming also show that the support quickly turns into
opposition if the measures taken would raise energy prices
appreciably. This is especially true for gasoline prices, and on this
point the European experience is worth noting. A European Environment
Agency report found that greenhouse-gas emissions from motor vehicles
continue to rise due to increased driving, despite punitively high
European gasoline taxes that push the overall price well above $6 per
gallon. In fact, increased vehicle emissions are a big part of the
reason most Western European countries are going to miss their Kyoto
targets. If $6 per gallon is not high enough to discourage driving and
meet Europe’s global-warming targets, then what will it take here?
Americans, who get angry enough over $3 gas, will want answers to this
and other economic questions before they buy into any climate policy.

A realistic discussion about costs can’t be sidestepped much longer.
Once it commences, it has the potential to greatly sap the momentum
for these bills.

Bursting the Climate Fear Bubble
In the last year or so, the coverage of climate science has gotten
more apocalyptic in tone. This is not so much a change in the
underlying science as a change in the way it is being communicated to
the public. The cap-and-trade proponents have cranked up the gloom and
doom for a reason — they essentially had to. The issue in the U.S. was
dead in the water without it. Previous efforts to move cap-and-trade
bills had been easily defeated, and proponents needed to shake things
up. For now, it is working.

But fear is two-edged sword. It can be used to whip up support for
action over the near term, but it is hard to sustain for long,
especially if it is not well supported by fact. Eventually it could
lead to a backlash. Indeed, the global-warming doomsayers may well
prove to be their own worst enemy, with their credibility taking a
tumble along with the prospects for cap-and-trade legislation.

One over-utilized source, employed in spreading this kind of fear, is
supposedly rock-solid “scientific consensus” on global warming, a
consensus that has
