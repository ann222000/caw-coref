*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
German Shepherds are one of the most intelligent and versatile dog breeds in the world. But you need to know basic German Shepherd information to discoverwhat to expect from them before you bring one home. German Shepherd dogs are not satisfied until they are the center of attention. They are not vicious, but don't know their own strength at times. German Shepherds are smarter than most people, which may get them into mischief in order to get your attention. They also can get more health problems than other breeds, especially hip and elbow dysplasia.

When anyone says the word dog, the image that pops up in most people's mind is that of the German Shepherd. Also known as Alsatians (from the province in France where the breed was developed), the German Shepherd is one of the most popular dogs in the world. With their distinctive look, incredible intelligence and remarkable personalities, you would think the German Shepherd would be the perfect dog.

But a German Shepherd is not the dog for everyone. Their large size, their exuberant nature, their coats and sometimes health problems leave many thousands of German Shepherd Dogs to be abandoned every year. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that a quarter of all strays are purebreds, including purebred German Shepherds. Knowing basic German Shepherd information can help teach you what to expect from them as pets will help you decide if a German Shepherd is right for you and your family.

The incredible popularity of the German Shepherd has led to it being over bred. To keep up with the market for German Shepherd puppies, some breeders and puppy mills breed to death any German Shepherd they can find, no matter what it's health. Responsible breeders and caring dog lovers are trying to stop this indiscriminate breeding and only breed healthy dogs. But German Shepherd can often seem to develop more health problems than other breeds.

The most common problem is hip dysplasia, which makes the hind legs crippled. This is a treatable condition that often involves X-rays and surgery. Many German Shepherds are abandoned just because the owners were not willing to pay the vet bills. You must be committed to caring for the dog's health over luxuries for yourself. Many older German Shepherds also become blind, but dogs deal with blindness a lot better than people. The companionship of a German Shepherd should not have a price tag placed upon it.

German Shepherd dogs need to feel they have a job in order to be well-adjusted. They love company and to be part of the family. They hate being left out of anything. They use their intelligence to find ways of doing things they think you will like and praise them for. Whether you will like these actions is another matter. German Shepherds need supervision and training.

Because of their popularity, German Shepherd Dogs have been over bred, which has lead to health problems. Although responsible breeders would not breed an animal with health problems, which can be inherited by their puppies, many still do. The most common health problems with German Shepherds are hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia and cancers. Even though many of these health problems can be easily treated, the previous owners do not want to or cannot pay the vet bills and instead abandon the dog. When you get a German Shepherd keep in mind that they may need frequent visits to the vet.
