Wondering what is &quot;the UU Prophets&quot;. On Facebook it is said it is a UU
Christian theological group - or something, didn't quite understand ...
Anyone that can enlighten me?

The Prophets Project is the name for a young adult group within the UUA
(American). They seem to be combining an interest in UU history and in
social justice/political activism. This is from their website:
UU Prophets

The Young Adult Prophets Project is an effort to reclaim radical Unitarian,
Universalist and Unitarian Universalist history and kindle the UU legacy of
social justice. We explore the history of Unitarian and Universalist
prophetic leaders and how they have participated in the justice movement. We
share our own experiences of contemporary movements: the struggle against
neo-liberal economics expressed in the mobilizations against the World Trade
Organization and the Zapatista's; free speech and pacifist dissent; and the
role that so called &quot;marginal&quot; people play by taking principled stands in
times dominated by simplistic analysis and/or fanaticism. For more
information email Colin Bossen at cbos ... @mindspring.com.
