Hello Everyone,

All of us have some resistance to practice.  Even the Buddha on the night of
his great enlightenment was strongly beset by resistance.  Personified by
Mara, the evil one, who marshaled armies of pain, squadrons of doubts, and
sensual distractions of every description.  How did the Buddha get through
the night?  I think because he didn't fight his resistance.  He recognized
resistance.  In the Pali suttas, Buddha always confronts Mara head-on,
recognizing him and speaking directly and kindly to him.  Saying, &quot;I see you
thee Mara.  I recognize resistance as resistance.  I hear what you are
saying but I will keep practicing regardless of what you say… &quot;

As we deepen our practice we find that it is never static but always
changing.  There are times when our mind is alert, calm, and ever-present.
During these times we are diligent with our sitting and begin to realize the
benefits of our devotion.  And then there are those times when our practice
plateaus, whether this pertains to our sitting or our mindfulness practice
during the day or both.  There can often be a disconnect between our
intention and the quality of our practice.  But when our practice seems to
falter, whether we are unmotivated, uninspired, or overwhelmed by
life circumstances, what can we do to reconnect to our true intention?

How do we motivate ourselves to renew our faith, confidence, and devotion in
our practice during times of complacency, doubt, laziness or when going
through frustrations and struggles in life?

Just as a battery can lose the strength of its charge, our practice can
waiver due to the various reasons mentioned above.  What if, for one day, we
try living intentionally.  It is true that we perhaps cannot control every
detail of our day. However, it is equally true that we can choose how we
respond to what life offers.  Our second dharmasight-question thread is:

HOW DO I RECONNECT WITH MY PRACTICE?

In thinking about our response to life, many questions arise.  How can we
keep our intention clear? When our emotions become hindrances, how can we
transform them into assets?  What kind of consideration should be given to
the unique make-up of our own individual states of suffering and ignorance?
And how do we persevere with an enthusiastic, intelligent, and disciplined
mindset?

As mentioned by Victor, let's share our perspective, inspiration and
encouragement to everyone.  With this question in particular, responses
based in direct personal experience will be of great benefit to the
discussion.

In Loving Kindness,
Joseph

Hi Joseph, thank you for this question, which is so apt to daily life.

At least the thought of practice is in my mind most of every day.

Of course when the thought is in my mind it's intellectual - not real
practice - as if a third party is looking at the concept of practice.

But it does mean that when I lose the reality of practice - whether sitting
or in action - it's not forgotten because there's the thought of it floating
around, and that thought begins to bring my attention back to the reality.

By reality I mean a deepening, a move away from the intellectual and the
scattered thinking and toward what is grounded, natural and present.

If I am quiet, that something can deepen.

In action, it is a challenge for it to deepen, but it can at least not be a
runaway mind.

Maybe this is how it works for most people?

Something that helps me keep it in mind is to have reminders around, e.g.
copies of the Heart Sutra in different places (bedroom, car, office).

Metta, Roby

Dear Joseph,

I'd like to phrase it, 'how does my practice reconnect with me?'  My
practice is the wholesome activity and 'me' is erratic volition. Do I
need to see  'my practice'  as an 'activity' requiring some degree of
effort, or is it a natural and healthful way of living?  Is
'practice' something that is either on or off?  If we consider how
well we feed our bodies - for instance, do we consume the recommended
amounts of liquids, vitamins, minerals, protein, etc., e.g., 5
servings of fruit and veg every day? - we might see that our physical
nutrition is actually pretty erratic.  And how much does that actually
bother us?  I would say, on the whole we've learned to live with it
because we've experienced varying degrees of physical hunger and
satisfaction from the moment we were born, and can't stop having to
deal with it until we leave this existence.  I'm hungry -  what's
there to eat? (Is it 'me' that's hungry or my body?) Has someone
prepared a meal for me, or do I have to find something on my own? We
compensate where we have to. Some people are really good at sticking
to mealtimes and types of foods consumed, others aren't. If unhealthy
eating goes on for too long we are pressed into doing something about
it. I think the same goes for mental/spiritual nutrition. Our mind
wakes us up when it needs food and spiritual nourishment, and starts
to demand it. Regular (spiritual) meals are good, but don't always
happen, especially if we're not in a monastery or a retreat but
feeding ourselves, or dependent on partners and family members, or
sitting groups for an opportunity.

When our bodies &amp; heart-minds have had enough junk to get sick on,
they say: give me something fresh and healthy, please!  We may have
some wholesome nourishment handy (thanks to prior wisdom), or we may
have to go in search of it.  As we get more in tune with our bodies
and heart-minds, we get more sensitive to the alert signal, and as our
'practice' refines we become sensitive to finer and finer imbalances
in homeostasis of body and heart-mind (equanimity), and know to
rectify the situation before things go badly awry.  The heart-mind has
its own functions and needs, and we just need to observe its condition
with loving care and respond selflessly.  Do people have to motivate
themselves to take care of their children or pets? Most don't, they
just love their children, pets, gardens, projects, etc., and go out of
their way for them, at the same time enjoying their company and
frolics.  I think we should see our 'practice' and mind-care the same
way - willingly, caringly, lovingly, responsibly - knowing that we are
training and cultivating the heart-mind-body, but loving it at the
same time, and so we can persist in training without getting
frustrated, and enjoy its frolics. We are human beings, no more no
less.  Let's be grateful for the degrees of wakefulness our mind has
won for itself against our endless selfish obstructive tendencies, and
promise we will do our best to learn to discern how the mind is
happiest. This has nothing to do with 'me' and 'my practice.'

For a personal experience example, I was recently regifted something I
had given that person last year.  As she placed it in my lap  she
said, &quot;Someone gave me this, and- &quot; &quot;Yes, I did,&quot; I interrupted. &quot;I
thought you'd like it. It has herbs and flowers on it.&quot; (She's an
organic farmer. It was a dish towel.) &quot;I didn't want to get it dirty,&quot;
she said. What else is a dish towel for, I wondered, but in the moment
I laughed it off good-naturedly.  BUT, the thought kept coming back to
me for days that she hadn't really cared enough to even remember who
gave it to her!  Me, the thoughful, caring sister-in-law!  The days
went on with this recurring miserable thought until I realized it was
poisoning my being and my relationship with not just her but
everyone.  I used the teaching on emptiness to see it all as karmic,
recognized my own similar carelessnes and practice of regifting in the
past, and extended lovingkindness to her and others as a healing salve
for the heart-mind. It was hard to let go of what I consider 'proper
social behavior,' but the heart-mind would not be satisfied with
anything less than clarity.

Step by step,
Sheila

Are you humbly grateful, or grumbly hateful? A great quote by Pastor
Roland Smith, worth asking ourselves many times a day.

Hi Everyone, I just got back from the 10 day Huatou retreat up at the
Dharma Drum. Ven. Chi Chern led the retreat and Guo Jun Fashi
translated.  I've only been back a day and the effect of the retreat
hasn't fully emerged but I'd like to share some of my experiences.  I
hadn't ever been on a retreat with Ven. Chi Chern but i got a vibe
about him from the people I asked who were all women and who seemed to
really have a high appreciation for him.  Interestingly the retreat
had double the amount of women.  They were right, he's a great
teacher.  He really guides people in a gentle easy way.  Without going
into too much detail about the retreat (I could write a lot about it),
this is what I'd like to share.  First off, I feel I have been solidly
grounded in the practice of huatou.  I'd never been on a huatou
retreat and only learned about it from things of Shifu's that I'd
read.  It's a very different experience than silent illumination,
which focuses ones projection outward into the environment, Huatou
projects inward which i found relatively easier to do than the
practice of silent illumination (though I think that may be because i
haven't really practiced silent illumination effectively).  I was
actually able to stick with the huatou and though I wasn't able to
'explode the ball of doubt' I was able to use the method effectively.
I had so many different experiences using it.  At one point I reached
a place where the huatou was asking the guestion without any effort
from me. it was a really amazing thing. but then we had to stop for
lunch and instead of continuing on I stopped and couldn't get back to
that place.  A day or two went by and I was feeling lots of regret for
not continuing on.  It was zapping me, my energy, my will, my
everything.  Once I was able to get into it again, of course I
realized how regret can really cause someone, me, to lose track.  Its
a big 'disabler' for lack of a better word. Anyway, eventually i was
able to get back on track, using the huatou.  I learned from Shifu
that though Buddha didn't use a huatou so to speak, using a huatou is
in perfect accordance with Shakyamuni's awakening.  So during my
investigation I thought about Buddha, especially about the phrase
'kill the Buddha, kill the mara' meaning whatever good or bad arises
let it go.  Plus about his determination.  I reached a point using the
huatou where i could see some of my self nature, like when i was deep
into it and all of a sudden i got sleepy and realized that was 'Mara',
or hungry so many thoughts, habits, ways I've been taught to think,
how I feel are just negative thought patterns, attachments to the
self.  I didn't actually burst that balloon of doubt [I&quot;d like to say
here something about the phrasing of great ball of doubt.  The word
DOUBT wasn't working for me at all.  In Chinese words have many
meanings and its easy to be creative with a single word. In English,
words have more or less a single meaning and there's not so much room
to play. Doubt for me means something negative, like there's something
not true.  Shifu also explains that great ball of doubt as an extreme
unresolved puzzle.  I used that idea in the practice rather than
doubt. There are some other words that i think should be translated
differently but too many to get into here].  Though I didn't burst
that balloon as one of the nuns on retreat explained, I was given a
golden key.  And now its up to me to persist in the practice and
continue to explore.  I'm so glad I was able to experience all that.
There are only two main practices in Chan Buddhism, and though I have
been practicing for years I am still trying to grasp them.  I think
anyone who is on the Path should sincerely commit themselves to
learning the practice.  It is the key. My faith in Buddhism and the
practice has flourished.  I feel a much greater commitment to the
practice and learning to share more.  Ven. Chi Chern ended the retreat
by saying to hold the three rings, Care, Share and Offer.  Thanks for
listening, and put your focus into the practice.  Life is short, like
a fish in little water, joy will not last. Practice as if your heads
were aflame.  Metta, Stacey

Hello Joseph,

I just came back from a Huatou retreat at DDRC. This so far is the most
relaxing intensive retreat I have attended. Chi Chern Fashi is
Chan Master from Malaysia and has been teaching for 30 years. His teachings
during the retreat were simple, easy to understand and yet profound. His
style of teaching is very similar to GJFS, who translated for him. His
emphasis was to go back to the basics, and give rise to beginner's mind. He
gave step by step instructions that started from the foundation of
meditation practices which is relaxation of the body and mind. I would like
to share a part of his lecture on the last night of the retreat and on the
closing ceremony on the last day of the retreat which I think is pertinent
to this question thread.

On the last night of the retreat, part of his talk was on the 4 Great Vows
which we recite many times during the retreat. We might even recite it
everyday but most of the time we do not resonate with the vows, they seem
sooo unreachable and unattainable because of the words innumerable, endless,
limitless and supreme. In Chinese however, all four words are translated as
&quot;wu&quot; which means nothing fixed.
No fixed number, no fixed measurement. The word therefore makes it free and
open to use according to causes and conditions. So when we vow to deliver
innumerable sentient beings, there is no fixed number of beings to deliver,
it can mean one to millions. If we practice sincerely and earnestly and free
ourselves from suffering at the moment, we already delivered one
innumerable sentient being, ourselves. If our actions become skillfull and
lead to helping another to be free of suffering, then two inumerabes and so
forth. We vow to cut off endless vexations, if we lessen our  vexations one
at a time or two at a time dependingon our causes and conditions and  so
with limitless approaches to Dharma, and attaining  supreme Buddhahood.

It is all about being true to ourselves and our practice. It is learning
about ourselves, knowing our abilities and skills and accepting ourseves
with kindness and understanding at our level of practice, where we are at
the moment. If we do that, we can be free and open to whatever the moment
offers.We try our best not to box ourselves or close ourselves no
expectations, no judgements, no blame. Life is our practice. Accepting what
is with gentleness and kindness. As Sheila said, step by step.

One evening  I was sitting on the bench by the lake observing the last rays
of the sunset hitting the surface of the lake, I could see the many many
little waves arising and then going and it dawned on me the many, many more
arisings and goings that are so subtle and yet  make up the water which make
up the lake. I then remembered the Dharma talk where Chi Chern Fashi talked
about now to deal with the pain in one's legs while sitting which also can
be applied to dealing with daily life. He said that one's practice starts
with one's body and the easiest was to focus on the breath. After relaxing
and being able to harmonize our minds with our breaths, we can observe the
arising of the breath through inhalation, and the perishing through
exhalation, Upon further observation we can see that the inhalation itself
has arising and perishing and so does exhalation, Upon further investigation
we can see that there are many, many, many arisings and perishings that make
up one single breath. So this observation can be applied to our pain. One
sitting peiod, I used this teaching to observe my leg pain and it
worked.  Through observation, I could see the arising, peaking
then dissolving of the pain. could see the change, the impermanence of this
pain. Pain actually goes away. Even though, that experience was short lived,
being able to observe the impermanence of this phenomena called pain was an
immense breakthrough for me, because I was able to not personalize the pain,
just observe it, and let it be. Sustaining this practice, however in daily
life is something else because it involves others, the environs, the outside
world. But life is practice and practice is life. So my practice is to keep
it simple; smile, relax, breathe in and breathe out.

The last day of the retreat, the talk was about how to practice in our daily
life with caring, sharing and offering. Again he emphasized all three of
this practices begins with ourselves. We can only care, share and offer what
we have within ourselves first by establishing the causes and conditions
within our practice. He said a very simple way of practice is when we get up
in the morning to say good morning to ourselves while look into the mirror
when we do our morning routine and mean it. That way, when we greet others
good morning, it is heartfelt, not automatic because as simple as it is, we
are already putting imprints of wholesome, positive imprints within our
minds. It works for me, sooo, when you look first look into the mirror at
the start of the day, say good morning to yourself. Keep it simple.

With loving thoughts for all beings,

Josephine

&gt; Dear Joseph,

&gt; I'd like to phrase it, 'how does my practice reconnect with me?'  My
&gt; practice is the wholesome activity and 'me' is erratic volition. Do I
&gt; need to see  'my practice'  as an 'activity' requiring some degree of
&gt; effort, or is it a natural and healthful way of living?  Is
&gt; 'practice' something that is either on or off?  If we consider how
&gt; well we feed our bodies - for instance, do we consume the recommended
&gt; amounts of liquids, vitamins, minerals, protein, etc., e.g., 5
&gt; servings of fruit and veg every day? - we might see that our physical
&gt; nutrition is actually pretty erratic.  And how much does that actually
&gt; bother us?  I would say, on the whole we've learned to live with it
&gt; because we've experienced varying degrees of physical hunger and
&gt; satisfaction from the moment we were born, and can't stop having to
&gt; deal with it until we leave this existence.  I'm hungry -  what's
&gt; there to eat? (Is it 'me' that's hungry or my body?) Has someone
&gt; prepared a meal for me, or do I have to find something on my own? We
&gt; compensate where we have to. Some people are really good at sticking
&gt; to mealtimes and types of foods consumed, others aren't. If unhealthy
&gt; eating goes on for too long we are pressed into doing something about
&gt; it. I think the same goes for mental/spiritual nutrition. Our mind
&gt; wakes us up when it needs food and spiritual nourishment, and starts
&gt; to demand it. Regular (spiritual) meals are good, but don't always
&gt; happen, especially if we're not in a monastery or a retreat but
&gt; feeding ourselves, or dependent on partners and family members, or
&gt; sitting groups for an opportunity.

&gt; When our bodies &amp; heart-minds have had enough junk to get sick on,
&gt; they say: give me something fresh and healthy, please!  We may have
&gt; some wholesome nourishment handy (thanks to prior wisdom), or we may
&gt; have to go in search of it.  As we get more in tune with our bodies
&gt; and heart-minds, we get more sensitive to the alert signal, and as our
&gt; 'practice' refines we become sensitive to finer and finer imbalances
&gt; in homeostasis of body and heart-mind (equanimity), and know to
&gt; rectify the situation before things go badly awry.  The heart-mind has
&gt; its own functions and needs, and we just need to observe its condition
&gt; with loving care and respond selflessly.  Do people have to motivate
&gt; themselves to take care of their children or pets? Most don't, they
&gt; just love their children, pets, gardens, projects, etc., and go out of
&gt; their way for them, at the same time enjoying their company and
&gt; frolics.  I think we should see our 'practice' and mind-care the same
&gt; way - willingly, caringly, lovingly, responsibly - knowing that we are
&gt; training and cultivating the heart-mind-body, but loving it at the
&gt; same time, and so we can persist in training without getting
&gt; frustrated, and enjoy its frolics. We are human beings, no more no
&gt; less.  Let's be grateful for the degrees of wakefulness our mind has
&gt; won for itself against our endless selfish obstructive tendencies, and
&gt; promise we will do our best to learn to discern how the mind is
&gt; happiest. This has nothing to do with 'me' and 'my practice.'

&gt; For a personal experience example, I was recently regifted something I
&gt; had given that person last year.  As she placed it in my lap  she
&gt; said, &quot;Someone gave me this, and- &quot; &quot;Yes, I did,&quot; I interrupted. &quot;I
&gt; thought you'd like it. It has herbs and flowers on it.&quot; (She's an
&gt; organic farmer. It was a dish towel.) &quot;I didn't want to get it dirty,&quot;
&gt; she said. What else is a dish towel for, I wondered, but in the moment
&gt; I laughed it off good-naturedly.  BUT, the thought kept coming back to
&gt; me for days that she hadn't really cared enough to even remember who
&gt; gave it to her!  Me, the thoughful, caring sister-in-law!  The days
&gt; went on with this recurring miserable thought until I realized it was
&gt; poisoning my being and my relationship with not just her but
&gt; everyone.  I used the teaching on emptiness to see it all as karmic,
&gt; recognized my own similar carelessnes and practice of regifting in the
&gt; past, and extended lovingkindness to her and others as a healing salve
&gt; for the heart-mind. It was hard to let go of what I consider 'proper
&gt; social behavior,' but the heart-mind would not be satisfied with
&gt; anything less than clarity.

&gt; Step by step,
&gt; Sheila

Thank you for sharing your hautou experiences. The encouragement is
uplifting and energizing.  I'm happy you shared, Roby
P.S. Re: reducing fatigue, pain and scatteredness when sitting, chi gong

Subject: Re: Dharmasight-question: How do I reconnect with my practice?

Hi Everyone, I just got back from the 10 day Huatou retreat up at the
Dharma Drum. Ven. Chi Chern led the retreat and Guo Jun Fashi
translated.  I've only been back a day and the effect of the retreat
hasn't fully emerged but I'd like to share some of my experiences.  I
hadn't ever been on a retreat with Ven. Chi Chern but i got a vibe
about him from the people I asked who were all women and who seemed to
really have a high appreciation for him.  Interestingly the retreat
had double the amount of women.  They were right, he's a great
teacher.  He really guides people in a gentle easy way.  Without going
into too much detail about the retreat (I could write a lot about it),
this is what I'd like to share.  First off, I feel I have been solidly
grounded in the practice of huatou.  I'd never been on a huatou
retreat and only learned about it from things of Shifu's that I'd
read.  It's a very different experience than silent illumination,
which focuses ones projection outward into the environment, Huatou
projects inward which i found relatively easier to do than the
practice of silent illumination (though I think that may be because i
haven't really practiced silent illumination effectively).  I was
actually able to stick with the huatou and though I wasn't able to
'explode the ball of doubt' I was able to use the method effectively.
I had so many different experiences using it.  At one point I reached
a place where the huatou was asking the guestion without any effort
from me. it was a really amazing thing. but then we had to stop for
lunch and instead of continuing on I stopped and couldn't get back to
that place.  A day or two went by and I was feeling lots of regret for
not continuing on.  It was zapping me, my energy, my will, my
everything.  Once I was able to get into it again, of course I
realized how regret can really cause someone, me, to lose track.  Its
a big 'disabler' for lack of a better word. Anyway, eventually i was
able to get back on track, using the huatou.  I learned from Shifu
that though Buddha didn't use a huatou so to speak, using a huatou is
in perfect accordance with Shakyamuni's awakening.  So during my
investigation I thought about Buddha, especially about the phrase
'kill the Buddha, kill the mara' meaning whatever good or bad arises
let it go.  Plus about his determination.  I reached a point using the
huatou where i could see some of my self nature, like when i was deep
into it and all of a sudden i got sleepy and realized that was 'Mara',
or hungry so many thoughts, habits, ways I've been taught to think,
how I feel are just negative thought patterns, attachments to the
self.  I didn't actually burst that balloon of doubt [I&quot;d like to say
here something about the phrasing of great ball of doubt.  The word
DOUBT wasn't working for me at all.  In Chinese words have many
meanings and its easy to be creative with a single word. In English,
words have more or less a single meaning and there's not so much room
to play. Doubt for me means something negative, like there's something
not true.  Shifu also explains that great ball of doubt as an extreme
unresolved puzzle.  I used that idea in the practice rather than
doubt. There are some other words that i think should be translated
differently but too many to get into here].  Though I didn't burst
that balloon as one of the nuns on retreat explained, I was given a
golden key.  And now its up to me to persist in the practice and
continue to explore.  I'm so glad I was able to experience all that.
There are only two main practices in Chan Buddhism, and though I have
been practicing for years I am still trying to grasp them.  I think
anyone who is on the Path should sincerely commit themselves to
learning the practice.  It is the key. My faith in Buddhism and the
practice has flourished.  I feel a much greater commitment to the
practice and learning to share more.  Ven. Chi Chern ended the retreat
by saying to hold the three rings, Care, Share and Offer.  Thanks for
listening, and put your focus into the practice.  Life is short, like
a fish in little water, joy will not last. Practice as if your heads
were aflame.  Metta, Stacey

&gt; How do we motivate ourselves to renew our faith, confidence, and devotion
in

&gt; the unique make-up of our own individual states of suffering and
ignorance?
&gt; And how do we persevere with an enthusiastic, intelligent, and disciplined
&gt; mindset?

&gt; As mentioned by Victor, let's share our perspective, inspiration and
&gt; encouragement to everyone.  With this question in particular, responses
&gt; based in direct personal experience will be of great benefit to the

Dear Roby,

Thank you for your suggestion. Yes, the exercises(chiqong, yoga) help with
reducing pain by opening up the body and it's blockages so we can relax
and be more flexible and relax our minds too. With regards to scatteredness
though, how will chi qong help?

With metta,

Hi Josephine,

As Guojun Fashi always used to say during the silent illumination
retreat, &quot;wherever
your body is, your mind is&quot;.  I would agree in part with Roby's suggestions,
but the key word here is &quot;mindfulness&quot;.  Whenever I'm in challenging asanas
in my ashtanga practice (power yoga), I always breath in (with) the tension
and reflect on what and where to open up. What do you mean by relax mind
with scattered thoughts?  I don't consider yoga as a mere form of exercise
alone.

BTW, I already arranged for you and Phung to join my class next week.  Don't
worry - it's all level yoga class :) .

Blessings,
Victor

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for posting out this very practical question &quot;* How do I reconnect
with my practice?&quot;*

We all know one can truly benefit from the meditation only if the commitment
to daily practice is in place. Yet easy said than done.  I find myself get
disconnected from practice when I get carried away with the unwanted
thoughts. These unwanted thoughts gives me tensions, worries, anger, stress
etc. By remembering the past and worrying about future, I simply loose the
precious present moment.

The simple way I found it is quite effective to bring myself back to the
moment is to practice breathing meditation. I won't go through too much
detail of the practice as most of us already went to the class about this
basic practice.  By involving the mind in observing the breath,  we were
able to challenge the mind, and thus to bring it to some focus. &quot;I am
breathing in a long breath. I am breathing out a short breath.&quot; Mind is
brought into the present moment, observing what is in this present moment,
eliminating unnecessary thinking. Thus, the attentive mind &quot;stops&quot; mind.

Thich Nhat Hanh, Zen Master, wrote the following about breath practice in
his book &quot;THE SUTRA ON THE FULL AWARENESS OF BREATHING&quot;

*    *&quot;The Full Awareness of the breath, or of any other object such as the
body, the feelings, the consciousness, the objects of consciousness,
and so on, are all aiming at the goal of concentrating the mind on an
object so that it is possible to see the object in all its depth.
Concentrating mind is stopping it from running from one object to
another in order for it to stay with just one object. We stay with one
object in order to observe it and to look deeply into it. In this way,
stopping and observing become one. (Thich 40)&quot;

With Metta,
Wei

&gt; Hello Joseph,

&gt; I just came back from a Huatou retreat at DDRC. This so far is the most
&gt; relaxing intensive retreat I have attended. Chi Chern Fashi is
&gt; Chan Master from Malaysia and has been teaching for 30 years. His teachings
&gt; during the retreat were simple, easy to understand and yet profound. His
&gt; style of teaching is very similar to GJFS, who translated for him. His
&gt; emphasis was to go back to the basics, and give rise to beginner's mind. He
&gt; gave step by step instructions that started from the foundation of
&gt; meditation practices which is relaxation of the body and mind. I would like
&gt; to share a part of his lecture on the last night of the retreat and on the
&gt; closing ceremony on the last day of the retreat which I think is pertinent
&gt; to this question thread.

&gt; On the last night of the retreat, part of his talk was on the 4 Great Vows
&gt; which we recite many times during the retreat. We might even recite it
&gt; everyday but most of the time we do not resonate with the vows, they seem
&gt; sooo unreachable and unattainable because of the words innumerable, endless,
&gt; limitless and supreme. In Chinese however, all four words are translated as
&gt; &quot;wu&quot; which means nothing fixed.
&gt; No fixed number, no fixed measurement. The word therefore makes it free
&gt; and open to use according to causes and conditions. So when we vow to
&gt; deliver innumerable sentient beings, there is no fixed number of beings to
&gt; deliver, it can mean one to millions. If we practice sincerely and earnestly
&gt; and free ourselves from suffering at the moment, we already delivered one
&gt; innumerable sentient being, ourselves. If our actions become skillfull and
&gt; lead to helping another to be free of suffering, then two inumerabes and so
&gt; forth. We vow to cut off endless vexations, if we lessen our  vexations one
&gt; at a time or two at a time dependingon our causes and conditions and  so
&gt; with limitless approaches to Dharma, and attaining  supreme Buddhahood.

&gt; It is all about being true to ourselves and our practice. It is learning
&gt; about ourselves, knowing our abilities and skills and accepting ourseves
&gt; with kindness and understanding at our level of practice, where we are at
&gt; the moment. If we do that, we can be free and open to whatever the moment
&gt; offers.We try our best not to box ourselves or close ourselves no
&gt; expectations, no judgements, no blame. Life is our practice. Accepting what
&gt; is with gentleness and kindness. As Sheila said, step by step.

&gt; One evening  I was sitting on the bench by the lake observing the last
&gt; rays of the sunset hitting the surface of the lake, I could see the many
&gt; many little waves arising and then going and it dawned on me the many, many
&gt; more arisings and goings that are so subtle and yet  make up the water which
&gt; make up the lake. I then remembered the Dharma talk where Chi Chern Fashi
&gt; talked about now to deal with the pain in one's legs while sitting which
&gt; also can be applied to dealing with daily life. He said that one's practice
&gt; starts with one's body and the easiest was to focus on the breath. After
&gt; relaxing and being able to harmonize our minds with our breaths, we can
&gt; observe the arising of the breath through inhalation, and the perishing
&gt; through exhalation, Upon further observation we can see that the inhalation
&gt; itself has arising and perishing and so does exhalation, Upon further
&gt; investigation we can see that there are many, many, many arisings and
&gt; perishings that make up one single breath. So this observation can be
&gt; applied to our pain. One sitting peiod, I used this teaching to observe my
&gt; leg pain and it worked.  Through observation, I could see the arising,
&gt; peaking  then dissolving of the pain. could see the change, the impermanence
&gt; of this pain. Pain actually goes away. Even though, that experience was
&gt; short lived, being able to observe the impermanence of this phenomena called
&gt; pain was an immense breakthrough for me, because I was able to not
&gt; personalize the pain, just observe it, and let it be. Sustaining this
&gt; practice, however in daily life is something else because it involves
&gt; others, the environs, the outside world. But life is practice and practice
&gt; is life. So my practice is to keep it simple; smile, relax, breathe in and
&gt; breathe out.

&gt; The last day of the retreat, the talk was about how to practice in our
&gt; daily life with caring, sharing and offering. Again he emphasized all three
&gt; of this practices begins with ourselves. We can only care, share and offer
&gt; what we have within ourselves first by establishing the causes and
&gt; conditions within our practice. He said a very simple way of practice is
&gt; when we get up in the morning to say good morning to ourselves while look
&gt; into the mirror when we do our morning routine and mean it. That way, when
&gt; we greet others good morning, it is heartfelt, not automatic because as
&gt; simple as it is, we are already putting imprints of wholesome, positive
&gt; imprints within our minds. It works for me, sooo, when you look first look
&gt; into the mirror at the start of the day, say good morning to yourself. Keep
&gt; it simple.

&gt; With loving thoughts for all beings,

&gt; &gt; Dear Joseph,

&gt; &gt; I'd like to phrase it, 'how does my practice reconnect with me?'  My
&gt; &gt; practice is the wholesome activity and 'me' is erratic volition. Do I
&gt; &gt; need to see  'my practice'  as an 'activity' requiring some degree of
&gt; &gt; effort, or is it a natural and healthful way of living?  Is
&gt; &gt; 'practice' something that is either on or off?  If we consider how
&gt; &gt; well we feed our bodies - for instance, do we consume the recommended
&gt; &gt; amounts of liquids, vitamins, minerals, protein, etc., e.g., 5
&gt; &gt; servings of fruit and veg every day? - we might see that our physical
&gt; &gt; nutrition is actually pretty erratic.  And how much does that actually
&gt; &gt; bother us?  I would say, on the whole we've learned to live with it
&gt; &gt; because we've experienced varying degrees of physical hunger and
&gt; &gt; satisfaction from the moment we were born, and can't stop having to
&gt; &gt; deal with it until we leave this existence.  I'm hungry -  what's
&gt; &gt; there to eat? (Is it 'me' that's hungry or my body?) Has someone
&gt; &gt; prepared a meal for me, or do I have to find something on my own? We
&gt; &gt; compensate where we have to. Some people are really good at sticking
&gt; &gt; to mealtimes and types of foods consumed, others aren't. If unhealthy
&gt; &gt; eating goes on for too long we are pressed into doing something about
&gt; &gt; it. I think the same goes for mental/spiritual nutrition. Our mind
&gt; &gt; wakes us up when it needs food and spiritual nourishment, and starts
&gt; &gt; to demand it. Regular (spiritual) meals are good, but don't always
&gt; &gt; happen, especially if we're not in a monastery or a retreat but
&gt; &gt; feeding ourselves, or dependent on partners and family members, or
&gt; &gt; sitting groups for an opportunity.

&gt; &gt; When our bodies &amp; heart-minds have had enough junk to get sick on,
&gt; &gt; they say: give me something fresh and healthy, please!  We may have
&gt; &gt; some wholesome nourishment handy (thanks to prior wisdom), or we may
&gt; &gt; have to go in search of it.  As we get more in tune with our bodies
&gt; &gt; and heart-minds, we get more sensitive to the alert signal, and as our
&gt; &gt; 'practice' refines we become sensitive to finer and finer imbalances
&gt; &gt; in homeostasis of body and heart-mind (equanimity), and know to
&gt; &gt; rectify the situation before things go badly awry.  The heart-mind has
&gt; &gt; its own functions and needs, and we just need to observe its condition
&gt; &gt; with loving care and respond selflessly.  Do people have to motivate
&gt; &gt; themselves to take care of their children or pets? Most don't, they
&gt; &gt; just love their children, pets, gardens, projects, etc., and go out of
&gt; &gt; their way for them, at the same time enjoying their company and
&gt; &gt; frolics.  I think we should see our 'practice' and mind-care the same
&gt; &gt; way - willingly, caringly, lovingly, responsibly - knowing that we are
&gt; &gt; training and cultivating the heart-mind-body, but loving it

Josephine,

I notice that chi qong helps energy move better - more evenly and
consistently - through my body.

It also increases flexibility and the ability to maintain good posture.

I guess it's a lot like yoga in those ways.

My body is more settled and calm when sitting, which reduces distractions of
the mind.

I also think I have less energy blockage in the head.

When I have scattered thoughts, it seems that somehow energy is stuck in the
head.

As you know there are many chi qong practices.

After reviewing different ones in magazines and on line, I use B.K. (Bruce)
Frantzis' Opening the Energy Gates of the Body (book and video).

Metta,

R

Dear Roby,

Thank you for your suggestion. Yes, the exercises(chiqong, yoga) help with
reducing pain by opening up the body and it's blockages so we can relax and
be more flexible and relax our minds too. With regards to scatteredness
though, how will chi qong help?

Hi Everyone, I just got back from the 10 day Huatou retreat up at the
Dharma Drum. Ven. Chi Chern led the retreat and Guo Jun Fashi
translated.  I've only been back a day and the effect of the retreat
hasn't fully emerged but I'd like to share some of my experiences.  I
hadn't ever been on a retreat with Ven. Chi Chern but i got a vibe
about him from the people I asked who were all women and who seemed to
really have a high appreciation for him.  Interestingly the retreat
had double the amount of women.  They were right, he's a great
teacher.  He really guides people in a gentle easy way.  Without going
into too much detail about the retreat (I could write a lot about it),
this is what I'd like to share.  First off, I feel I have been solidly
grounded in the practice of huatou.  I'd never been on a huatou
retreat and only learned about it from things of Shifu's that I'd
read.  It's a very different experience than silent illumination,
which focuses ones projection outward into the environment, Huatou
projects inward which i found relatively easier to do than the
practice of silent illumination (though I think that may be because i
haven't really practiced silent illumination effectively).  I was
actually able to stick with the huatou and though I wasn't able to
'explode the ball of doubt' I was able to use the method effectively.
I had so many different experiences using it.  At one point I reached
a place where the huatou was asking the guestion without any effort
from me. it was a really amazing thing. but then we had to stop for
lunch and instead of continuing on I stopped and couldn't get back to
that place.  A day or two went by and I was feeling lots of regret for
not continuing on.  It was zapping me, my energy, my will, my
everything.  Once I was able to get into it again, of course I
realized how regret can really cause someone, me, to lose track.  Its
a big 'disabler' for lack of a better word. Anyway, eventually i was
able to get back on track, using the huatou.  I learned from Shifu
that though Buddha didn't use a huatou so to speak, using a huatou is
in perfect accordance with Shakyamuni's awakening.  So during my
investigation I thought about Buddha, especially about the phrase
'kill the Buddha, kill the mara' meaning whatever good or bad arises
let it go.  Plus about his determination.  I reached a point using the
huatou where i could see some of my self nature, like when i was deep
into it and all of a sudden i got sleepy and realized that was 'Mara',
or hungry so many thoughts, habits, ways I've been taught to think,
how I feel are just negative thought patterns, attachments to the
self.  I didn't actually burst that balloon of doubt [I&quot;d like to say
here something about the phrasing of great ball of doubt.  The word
DOUBT wasn't working for me at all.  In Chinese words have many
meanings and its easy to be creative with a single word. In English,
words have more or less a single meaning and there's not so much room
to play. Doubt for me means something negative, like there's something
not true.  Shifu also explains that great ball of doubt as an extreme
unresolved puzzle.  I used that idea in the practice rather than
doubt. There are some other words that i think should be translated
differently but too many to get into here].  Though I didn't burst
that balloon as one of the nuns on retreat explained, I was given a
golden key.  And now its up to me to persist in the practice and
continue to explore.  I'm so glad I was able to experience all that.
There are only two main practices in Chan Buddhism, and though I have
been practicing for years I am still trying to grasp them.  I think
anyone who is on the Path should sincerely commit themselves to
learning the practice.  It is the key. My faith in Buddhism and the
practice has flourished.  I feel a much greater commitment to the
practice and learning to share more.  Ven. Chi Chern ended the retreat
by saying to hold the three rings, Care, Share and Offer.  Thanks for
listening, and put your focus into the practice.  Life is short, like
a fish in little water, joy will not last. Practice as if your heads
were aflame.  Metta, Stacey

Greetings everyone. After reading the very profound and insightful
responses to the posed question, my response may well come across as
quite off-beat and a tad ridiculous but I can assure you I'm not
trying to be silly :) For me, the thing that very often brings me back
to my practice is taking a shower, specifically, the manner in which I
shower. Some time ago, while randomly clicking on articles in
Wikipedia, I came across one that was very brief and yet totally
changed the way I think about this ordinary, everyday activity. The
article in its entirety is below:
**
NAVY SHOWER

A navy shower (or &quot;sea shower&quot;) is a method of showering that allows
for great conservation of water and energy. The steps in a basic navy
shower are:
1. turn on the water
2. immediately wet the body
3. turn off the water
4. soap up and scrub
5. turn the water back on and rinse off the soap
The total time for the water being on is typically under 2 minutes and
often less.

Navy showers originated on naval ships, where supplies of fresh water
were often scarce. Using this method, crew members were able to stay
clean, while conserving their limited water supply. The idea has been
adopted by many people who wish to conserve water and the energy
needed to heat the water, for both environmental and economic reasons.
Maritime cruisers often take navy showers when they aren't in a port
with easy access to fresh water. A ten-minute shower takes as much as
230 L (60 US gallons) of water, while a navy shower usually takes as
little as 11 L (3 US gallons); one person can save 56,000 L (15,000 US
gallons) per year.
The United States Navy phrase Hollywood shower (as in the movies)
contrasts with Navy shower, and refers to long lavish showers without
limits on water usage - typically given as a reward for navy personnel
at sea or when excess water production (aka &quot;dumping the D.U.&quot;) by the
ship's distilling plant occurred, frequently taken by the ship's
Engineering department.
**
That such a simple act could have such a profound (positive) effect on
the environment really made, and still makes me contemplate the
teachings of karma as well as interdependence...all under 5 minutes.
Sure, there's also the role of water itself as a cleanser, both
spiritual and literal  (work in a lab) but no matter how I think of
it, I always step out of the bathroom with my mind a bit more settled
(and a body a lot more refreshed!) than when I entered; the perfect
prelude to other practices like meditating or reading sutras.

With Metta,
Rob

Hi Victor,

I agree wholeheartedly with &quot;wherever your body is, your mind is&quot;. That is
why I posed the question because I may have misunderstood Roby's statement
&quot;reducing pain and scattredness *when sitting*&quot;  to mean thinking about
doing qi qong while one is sitting. In that case the mind and body are
scattered. I re read the statement again and he was just talking about
qiqong exercises as an aid to sitting in general.

Actually, Phung and I were thinking about joining you yesterday for yoga but
Phung had a lot of things to do, poor kid. I could not leave her alone.
Thank you for scheduling us to join your class next week. I have fallen off
the yoga and taichi wagon for sometime and it would br good to get back ino
it. Just remember, to put us on the slow lane.

Peace,
Josephine

&gt; As Guojun Fashi always used to say during the silent illumination retreat,
&gt; &quot; wherever your body is, your mind is&quot;.  I would agree in part with Roby's
&gt; suggestions, but the key word here is &quot;mindfulness&quot;.  Whenever I'm in
&gt; challenging asanas in my ashtanga practice (power yoga), I always breath in
&gt; (with) the tension and reflect on what and where to open up. What do you
&gt; mean by relax mind with scattered thoughts?  I don't consider yoga as a mere

Hi Roby,

Thank you for your contribution to the question-thread discussion.  I can
identify with your experience of the intellectual perspective of
mindfulness, the experience of being, and how the former can lead into the
latter.

The literature we read is truly a gift, which can &quot;ground&quot; us as you say.  I
have so often strayed from practice, only to be brought back to the present
through the Dharma.  Sometimes I carry with me &quot;108 Paths to Liberation&quot;, a
small pamphlet of Master Sheng Yen's sayings.  In particular, the saying
&quot;Our needs are few, our wants are many&quot; has helped me tremendously.

But is reading the literature a double-edged sword? What about the approach
we take in looking to literature for inspiration or as a catalyst for
deepening our experience of the present moment?  How do we  use the
literature skillfully, instead of as a crutch?  How do we safeguard against
forming attachment to the views and opinions of the authors?  Is there
anything wrong with seeking comfort in the &quot;truths&quot;  that are put forth by
others? Your shared thoughts and experiences would be much appreciated.

Metta,

Joseph

Hi Joseph, thank you for this question, which is so apt to daily life.

At least the thought of practice is in my mind most of every day.

Of course when the thought is in my mind it's intellectual – not real
practice - as if a third party is looking at the concept of practice.

But it does mean that when I lose the reality of practice – whether sitting
or in action – it's not forgotten because there's the thought of it floating
around, and that thought begins to bring my attention back to the reality.

By reality I mean a deepening, a move away from the intellectual and the
scattered thinking and toward what is grounded, natural and present.

If I am quiet, that something can deepen.

In action, it is a challenge for it to deepen, but it can at least not be a
runaway mind.

Maybe this is how it works for most people?

Something that helps me keep it in mind is to have reminders around, e.g.
copies of the Heart Sutra in different places (bedroom, car, office).

Hi Joseph, it's great to hear from you.

And thank you for the saying, &quot;Our needs are few, our wants are many&quot;.

I too find that simple ones like that are helpful in recentering.

In short for now, yes I agree that literature is double edged.perhaps in the
same way that everything else is double edged?

It seems that as long as I interpret &quot;everything&quot; as a thing or things, then
I can get caught in objectifying and choosing and discriminating, no matter
whether the &quot;thing&quot; is a thought, emotion, experience, or object.

In that sense I can fall onto one edge or the other, or flip flop back and
forth between them, or try intellectually to hold them both at the same time
(creating confusion and conflict).

It seems that for the Middle Way to be alive, there is a letting go of any
attachment to one edge or the other, including the use and meaning of
literature (and the author and his/her views) or not use and meaning of
literature.

As long as I don't use literature too much (and of late it's been only a
little here and there for me - not daily and only a brief snippet or two at
that), and I let go of it after reading it (without intellectually trying to
push it away, which  is negative attachment), then I seem to do okay.

So, for me there is a &quot;letting go&quot; way of holding two edges at one time,
where it is an ease of being and there is no conflict and I don't have to be
all one way or the other nor do I have to resolve anything between the
apparent two.

Speaking of the double edge, as you know there is literature :-) that
addresses this very issue.

One of the best for me is the short poem Xin Xin Ming, also called Faith in
Mind, which is the title of one of Master Sheng Yen's books. (He also has a
book on a different poem called the Xin Ming.)

Excerpt from MSY's translation: &quot;The Supreme Way is not difficult if only
you do not pick and choose.For and against opposing each other, this is the
mind's disease.The Way is perfect like great space, without lack, without
excess. Because of grasping and rejecting, you cannot attain it..In oneness
and equality, confusion vanishes of itself.&quot;

This is a quick response and I do not have time to edit it (on way to work)
so I hope it's not too scattered.

Metta, Roby

Hi Roby,

Thank you for your contribution to the question-thread discussion.  I can
identify with your experience of the intellectual perspective of
mindfulness, the experience of being, and how the former can lead into the
latter.

The literature we read is truly a gift, which can &quot;ground&quot; us as you say.  I
have so often strayed from practice, only to be brought back to the present
through the Dharma.  Sometimes I carry with me &quot;108 Paths to Liberation&quot;, a
small pamphlet of Master Sheng Yen's sayings.  In particular, the saying
&quot;Our needs are few, our wants are many&quot; has helped me tremendously.

But is reading the literature a double-edged sword? What about the approach
we take in looking to literature for inspiration or as a catalyst for
deepening our experience of the present moment?  How do we  use the
literature skillfully, instead of as a crutch?  How do we safeguard against
forming attachment to the views and opinions of the authors?  Is there
anything wrong with seeking comfort in the &quot;truths&quot;  that are put forth by
others? Your shared thoughts and experiences would be much appreciated.

Metta,

Joseph

Hi Joseph, thank you for this question, which is so apt to daily life.

At least the thought of practice is in my mind most of every day.

Of course when the thought is in my mind it's intellectual - not real
practice - as if a third party is looking at the concept of practice.

But it does mean that when I lose the reality of practice - whether sitting
or in action - it's not forgotten because there's the thought of it floating
around, and that thought begins to bring my attention back to the reality.

By reality I mean a deepening, a move away from the intellectual and the
scattered thinking and toward what is grounded, natural and present.

If I am quiet, that something can deepen.

In action, it is a challenge for it to deepen, but it can at least not be a
runaway mind.

Maybe this is how it works for most people?

Something that helps me keep it in mind is to have reminders around, e.g.
copies of the Heart Sutra in different places (bedroom, car, office).

Joseph,

P.S.on the difference between choosing and discriminating, which I glossed
over...

We are always faced with choices, so we always have to choose.

Choosing is not the problem.

There is only a problem if we are attached to our choices.

If I like chocolate ice cream and someone offers me ice cream and all they
have is vanilla and I get angry, then I have a problem.

If instead I am happy with vanilla, or I choose to not have it, and I drop
it and continue to enjoy being with the person, then no problem.

In MSY's translation of the Xin Xin Ming, he says &quot;if only you do not pick
and choose&quot;.

There is another translation that works better for me, and it says &quot;if only
you are not attached to preferences&quot;.

So preferences are okay - even normal - let's just not be attached to them.

(By the way, that translation is a tiny, thin booklet that's one of the
items I keep at hand at all times.  It's called Hsin-Hsin Ming, Verses on
the Faith Mind, by Seng-ts'an, Third Zen Patriarch, translated by Richard B.
Clarke, White Pine Press, Buffalo, NY. Richard Clarke is at the Living
Dharma Center in Amherst, Mass. You can order it for $5 or so.)

Now I have taken your thread and run with it - got off in another field -
but it's all the same field right? - and now I am late to work because I
chose to write you!

Fortunately I work for myself, so the boss won't fire me this time, :-)

Hi Joseph, it's great to hear from you.

And thank you for the saying, &quot;Our needs are few, our wants are many&quot;.

I too find that simple ones like that are helpful in recentering.

In short for now, yes I agree that literature is double edged.perhaps in the
same way that everything else is double edged?

It seems that as long as I interpret &quot;everything&quot; as a thing or things, then
I can get caught in objectifying and choosing and discriminating, no matter
whether the &quot;thing&quot; is a thought, emotion, experience, or object.

In that sense I can fall onto one edge or the other, or flip flop back and
forth between them, or try intellectually to hold them both at the same time

Roby,

I'd like to go further about your analogy of an ice cream, but this time
I'll go with an apple since I'm in New York and you're in New Mexico :) .

Here is an apple.  If I say this is an apple, I am attached to name and
form.  But if I say it is not an apple, I am attached to emptiness.  So is
this an apple or not?  If I say, &quot;the sky is blue, the tree is green,&quot; or
&quot;the apple is red, the wall is white,&quot; I am giving a &quot;like this&quot; answer.
But if I take a bite of the apple, that is &quot;just like this&quot;.

It was Master Seung Sahn's teaching of enlightenment.  The Zen master that
we talked about in our email recently, who also gave us the weekend dharma
passage that you've shared.

Victor,

Since you guys are on the topic of attachments, here is another story from
the Dharma talks at this last retreat. The story of the golden spoon.

One day someone gave a gift of a golden spoon to a boy who took it home to
his parents. As soon as the father saw the gift of golden spoon he became
alarmed and exclaimed, oh no, there goes all our wealth. The reason is
because now that they have a golden spoon, they have to have a jade
chopstick and bowl to go with it. They can not just eat ordinary rice with a
golden spoon and jade bowl, they have to buy fragrant expensive jasmone rice
to eat then a marble table, beautiful kitchen, house and so forth until they
get overwhelmed with credit card debts.

The other choice is to  accept the spoon and just use* for what it is*, a
spoon.

I have only read a little of Master Seung Sahn.

Is it fair to say that holding up an apple and saying &quot;this is an apple&quot; is
analogous to the finger pointing at the moon?

Great question Roby.

You've asked, &quot;Is it fair to say that holding up an apple and saying this is
an apple is analogous to the finger pointing at the moon?&quot;  My respond is,
&quot;it can be and it cannot be&quot;.

Since we are expounding Master Seung Sahn teachings, he said that our
relationship to this life does not come out of any kind of understanding.
We cannot reason life or death.  We must completely cut off all attachment
to thinking, and return to our mind before thinking arises.  For teaching
purposes, he sometimes call this point don't know mind .  Attaining this is
very simple, and not far away.  He simply said to ask ourselves, very
deeply, &quot;What am I?&quot;  What appears is only &quot;don't know...&quot;  This is already
our true nature.  Using our intellectual understanding to find our true
nature is like expecting a hungry man to satisfy his gnawing hunger with a
picture of an apple.  But the teaching is ,&quot;open your mouth, here's an apple
- now eat!&quot;

The core of the passage in my previous email is when we see, hear, smell,
taste, touch and think - everything is the truth (just as it is).  Take away
our &quot;small I&quot;, and we attain &quot;nothing I&quot;, or empty mind.  If we keep
practicing and don't attach to this place of complete emptiness, then the
whole universe and us completely become one.  We see clearly, hear clearly,
taste clearly, smell clearly -- everything is clear.  Just like biting the
apple, everything is the truth.

Blessings,
Victor

Hi Victor and Roby, I think the huatou What is wu? is
supposed to have the same effect as asking What am I.
the reason Shifu encourages us to use what is wu is
because of its non sensical nature...where as what am
I can cause one to come up with many answers, in other
words its easier to intellectualize what am I, as
opposed to what is wu.  Just wanted to add that
thought, take care, Stacey

Thank you Stacey.
True for me too, that some questions are more apt to lead into
intellectualizing.
Still - when a sense of doubt or deeper questioning is more present - then
the question is less important.
Is it this way for you too?

Hi Victor and Roby, I think the huatou What is wu? is
supposed to have the same effect as asking What am I.
the reason Shifu encourages us to use what is wu is
because of its non sensical nature...where as what am
I can cause one to come up with many answers, in other
words its easier to intellectualize what am I, as
opposed to what is wu.  Just wanted to add that
thought, take care, Stacey

Hi Roby, no I prefer to start out with the right
understanding otherwise it throws me...like the huatou
retreat.  thinking about the 'great unresolved
puzzle,' as opposed to the great ball of doubt, or
doubt sensation just made more sense.  I think
starting out with a correct understanding, or better
understanding makes the process easier.  I guess a lot
of it is just finding out what works for you.  'a
great unresolved puzzle,' are Shifu's words, not my
own, so I remain 'faithful,' to the teachings.  I hope
i'm getting what you were asking.....take care, STacey

Hi All,
I just stumbled upon this paragraph, although I know this is one of the
most basic concepts we talk about all the time, I thought this was a
pretty powerful way to put it:

&quot;The tridosha concept has been linked to a fundamental Buddhist concept,
called the three poisons. According to this view, the human being exists
because the undifferentiated and untroubled universal spirit is
influenced, as it flows through the manifest world, by the three
disrupting forces: attraction (desire), aversion (hatred), and confusion
(conception and misconception), yielding the &quot;ego bundles.&quot; In producing
the human body and mind, attraction gives rise to the sense that &quot;I&quot; am a
human being, rather than any other kind of being. Aversion gives rise to
the sense that &quot;I&quot; am imperfect and mortal. Confusion gives rise to the
sense that &quot;I&quot; am separate from everyone and everything else. As a result
of these three influences, the pure, all-encompassing, peaceful, universal
consciousness becomes a mortal, lonely human being.&quot;

Metta,
Maria

Thanks for your thought, Stacey.

Do you agree that because it is nonsensical in nature, &quot;what is mu?&quot; created
more doubt and confusion especially for new practitioner?  As you know, the
answer to 'mu' is already a mistake.  Sometimes Zen/Chan masters use such
kind of mistake to teach their students the importance of cutting off all
attachment to teaching.  They use language freely because of their
non-attachment to whether it is &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;not correct&quot;.

&quot;What I am?&quot; cuts off all thinking and returns us to our original nature
which is before thinking.

&quot;What's most important in my life?&quot;  &quot;What's the essence of my life?&quot;  If I
keep these questions alive, then practicing happens by itself.

Blessings,
Victor

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Greetings, everyone:

&gt; Our regular or routine activities in our lives can be considered a
&gt; &quot;practice&quot;.  While I was on a retreat, a Fashi would state that eating a
&gt; meal is a practice in itself.  If an individual thinks about how a meal's
&gt; arrival originated -- first it was planted with seeds in the fields by a
&gt; farmer, then it was cultivated with much light, fertilizer and water, etc.
&gt; The process of growing these plants to enable them to blossom and thrive
&gt; were a result of proper nourishment.  It is then purchased in the markets by
&gt; customers, where individuals prepare meals.

&gt; Recently on a retreat, I was volunteering in the kitchen.  While I was
&gt; peeling, chopping and garnishing, it occurred to me that the preparation and
&gt; the cooking is in itself a &quot;practice&quot;.  The cook, said to me that the care,
&gt; love, and effort in the preparation is a practice because food will taste
&gt; delicious due to how it was prepared.  Also, when retreatants would consume
&gt; the food, they would taste the love and care. It would then be passed on to
&gt; them (the love and care).  From that day on, I considered preparing and
&gt; cooking in the kitchen as an activity in which one can find much peace, even
&gt; if it was just peeling or chopping the food.

&gt; The yoga class has also changed my way of thinking of the numerous
&gt; possibilities it may be. I used to think that yoga was another form of
&gt; exercise.  It wasn't until a statement about mindfulness was raised, that I
&gt; then realized that this class is not just to exercise one's body, but it
&gt; also exercises one's mind, as well.  I thought to myself how spritual yoga
&gt; is and that it could be regarded as a practice. As the instructor was
&gt; reciting quotes and poetry, she played a CD of calm and soothing sounds. I
&gt; felt the serenity in the similar fashion that I felt when I sit. I am
&gt; thankful to Yoga and *Profound *for the new positive perspectives that was
&gt; provided and discovered.  This form of practice is a window of new
&gt; revelations. A step of opportunity into this beautiful art was taken and was
&gt; filled with surprises of tranquility.

&gt; In serenity,

&gt; Phung

Hello Phung, thanks for sharing your experience
cooking on the retreat and about the yoga.  it's
amazing when our day to day life takes on a spiritual
meaning - when we remember to view our daily
activities as practice.  sometimes it's practice just
to remember to stay with our practice,when we're so
detached from it all...which is often spoken of as the
real practice,.  maybe that would be a good new
thread, sharing how our daily activities can be a
means of practice. take care, Stacey

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Greetings, everyone:

&gt; &gt; Our regular or routine activities in our lives can
&gt; be considered a
&gt; &gt; &quot;practice&quot;.  While I was on a retreat, a Fashi
&gt; would state that eating a
&gt; &gt; meal is a practice in itself.  If an individual
&gt; thinks about how a meal's
&gt; &gt; arrival originated -- first it was planted with
&gt; seeds in the fields by a
&gt; &gt; farmer, then it was cultivated with much light,
&gt; fertilizer and water, etc.
&gt; &gt; The process of growing these plants to enable them
&gt; to blossom and thrive
&gt; &gt; were a result of proper nourishment.  It is then
&gt; purchased in the markets by
&gt; &gt; customers, where individuals prepare meals.

&gt; &gt; Recently on a retreat, I was volunteering in the
&gt; kitchen.  While I was
&gt; &gt; peeling, chopping and garnishing, it occurred to
&gt; me that the preparation and
&gt; &gt; the cooking is in itself a &quot;practice&quot;.  The cook,
&gt; said to me that the care,
&gt; &gt; love, and effort in the preparation is a practice
&gt; because food will taste
&gt; &gt; delicious due to how it was prepared.  Also, when
&gt; retreatants would consume
&gt; &gt; the food, they would taste the love and care. It
&gt; would then be passed on to
&gt; &gt; them (the love and care).  From that day on, I
&gt; considered preparing and
&gt; &gt; cooking in the kitchen as an activity in which one
&gt; can find much peace, even
&gt; &gt; if it was just peeling or chopping the food.

&gt; &gt; The yoga class has also changed my way of thinking
&gt; of the numerous
&gt; &gt; possibilities it may be. I used to think that yoga
&gt; was another form of
&gt; &gt; exercise.  It wasn't until a statement about
&gt; mindfulness was raised, that I
&gt; &gt; then realized that this class is not just to
&gt; exercise one's body, but it
&gt; &gt; also exercises one's mind, as well.  I thought to
&gt; myself how spritual yoga
&gt; &gt; is and that it could be regarded as a practice. As
&gt; the instructor was
&gt; &gt; reciting quotes and poetry, she played a CD of
&gt; calm and soothing sounds. I
&gt; &gt; felt the serenity in the similar fashion that I
&gt; felt when I sit. I am
&gt; &gt; thankful to Yoga and *Profound *for the new
&gt; positive perspectives that was
&gt; &gt; provided and discovered.  This form of practice is
&gt; a window of new
&gt; &gt; revelations. A step of opportunity into this
&gt; beautiful art was taken and was
&gt; &gt; filled with surprises of tranquility.

&gt; &gt; In serenity,

&gt; &gt; Phung

Well put, Stacey.  I think Phung is our youngest member in our forum.  Wish
I had the same insight when I was her age :).

I'm glad you had a great time in our yoga class, Phung.  Yoga postures
(asanas) can sometimes be challenging like life.  Being present and
&quot;sit&quot;with intense physical condition ground me in a deeper, meditative
dimensions
of yoga.  It really harmonizes and strengthens the body, breath, and mind.
The amazing thing about yoga practice is it's always evolving and changing.
Although the poses themselves do not change, your relationship to them
will.  Thinking about it as &quot;your practice&quot; encourages the noncompetitive
spirit of yoga. One of the most liberating things about yoga is the letting
go of ego and accepting that no one is better than anyone else. Everyone is
just doing their best on any given day.  It's a direct experience of the
vast interrelatedness of all life and of all things. This practice always
reminds me that who I am is not just my body (and the conversations in my
mind).

Whenever I'm in challenging asanas in my ashtanga practice, I always breath
in (with) the tension and reflect on what and where to open up.  Working in
this way, I can watch my mind play around with discomfort, effort, desire,
and aversion.

I'm always grateful to be supported and guided by wonderful teachers in all
my practice.

Blessings,
Victor

Hi Phung,

Thank you for sharing your insights. Food is very necessary nutriment for
our bodies so food preparation, therefore is a great opportunity for
mindfulness practice. Mindfullness as put simply by Guo Jun Fashi, is
caring. You were very generous to share your time and effort to help at the
Wellness Retreat and the chef was also generous to share her wisdom of
preparing food with love. The best part there was, all of you guys
sharing with preparing the food lovingly. Now, that is caring.  The food was
delicious by the way. Thank you for your caring.

Yoga as Victor describes, can deepen the practice.  Being there and sharing
the experience with your friends was wonderful too.

Recently, I went on a pre Wellness Retreat hiking  hike with 3 wonderful
friends. They had open kind and generous spirits. Lots of pleasant surprises
with magnifcent views from the mountain top it felt that you could just
reach up and  touch the sky and the waterfalls. It was like we went around
the world because of openness and awareness, beauty and things I do not
normally see opened up to me. Sharing the experience with friends made it
more memorable especially because Sheila was there to guide us and tell us
about the history of the place, the rocks and the foliage. Like Stacey said,
sharing is a wonderful practice.

Metta,
Josephine

&gt; &gt; &gt; retreatants would consume
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the food, they would taste the love and care. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; would then be passed on to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them (the love and care).  From that day on, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; considered preparing and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cooking in the kitchen as an activity in which one
&gt; &gt; &gt; can find much peace, even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it was just peeling or chopping the food.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The yoga class has also changed my way of thinking
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the numerous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possibilities it may be. I used to think that yoga
&gt; &gt; &gt; was another form of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exercise.  It wasn't until a statement about
&gt; &gt; &gt; mindfulness was raised, that I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then realized that this class is not just to
&gt; &gt; &gt; exercise one's body, but it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also exercises one's mind, as well.  I thought to
&gt; &gt; &gt; myself how spritual yoga
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is and that it could be regarded as a practice. As
&gt; &gt; &gt; the instructor was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reciting quotes and poetry, she played a CD of
&gt; &gt; &gt; calm and soothing sounds. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; felt the serenity in the similar fashion that I
&gt; &gt; &gt; felt when I sit. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thankful to Yoga and *Profound *for the new
&gt; &gt; &gt; positive perspectives that was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provided and discovered.  This form of practice is
&gt; &gt; &gt; a window of new
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revelations. A step of opportunity into this
&gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful art was taken and was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; filled with surprises of tranquility.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In serenity,
