Dear Sir,
My name is Manish Pareek and i am responsible to sell Ofem High Tech
CI Flexo Printing Machine s and  Laminators.

Plz allow us for general introduction of my company&quot;ofem Srl &quot;

Ofem is 20 year old european company involved in manufacturing of CI
Flexo press and Laminatoes at Verona,Italy.

We have Gearless and Geared machines in Ofem Appia,i enclosed the
details in presentation with this mail.
Appia is the latest technology and higher version suits to flexible
packaging printing production in reverse and surface printing for thin
film.

You can do the same reverse/surface  printing  jobs on Appia which you
doing at present using other high end  gravure machine,
PE/PP printing is controlled more accurately with CI Flexo
Appia ,with the 100% registration accuracy and better printability
with ink cost saving on higher speed like 400 meter/minute.
On Appia (both gearless and geared) you can print the
PET,BOPP,Nylone,PVC,PE(LLD/LD),Paper reverse and surface printing in
the thickness range 9 micron to 140 micron.
Better ink controlled with chambered doctor blade and ceramic aniloxes
in Appia ,therefore this machine is enviorenment friendly(very less
solvent emission because of chambered doctor blade system),better ink
saving while using low volume anilox then gravure.
Appia is the most opeartor friendly,touch screen latest generataion
sophisticated robust machine and quick change over in 08 colour jobs.
we do not have any constraint in materials and thickness,possible to
print any plastics.
But it is advicable in case if customer wants to print some time PE/
PP and other rolls with some customized requirement in that case we
could suggest some other models of ofem CI Flexo like
Juliette,Columbus model.
Juliette,the machine which  we developed to concern low investment and
to print PE/PP/LDPE and s hopping bag tube,flat roll is possible to
print on these two below machine,

(1) Columbus

(2)Juliette

Both Ofem Brand suits to the customer where they want to do LDPE
printing,the same machine guarnteed for flexible packaging lamination
kind of reverse printing on other thin film.

If you want any additional information and assistance,please ask me
immediately with out hesitation , looking forward for the reply on
above from you.

Yours Truly.

Manish J Pareek
