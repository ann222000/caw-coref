Part one

Two observers are in two perfectly opaque laboratories, let's call
them boxcars with a length l and width w.

One boxcar floats in the middle of perfectly dark and flat
intergalactic space with zero mass density.

The other is in orbit about a large mass (M), also with no mass or
energy density nearby other than the central mass (assume it isn't
radiating).

What's the best way for an unfortunate observer in one of these boxes
to tell whether he is in orbit or not?  No peeking out of the box!

Part two

Did Gravity Probe B give an example of such a measurement?

Thanks -

Inside the boxcars is any apparatus you can dream up to be used as
accelerometer

You could use neutrino or gravity-wave astronomy, but maybe that counts as
peeking out of the box. The only other way is to measure the tidal force.
For example, suspend a sphere of dust (noninteracting particles at rest) in
the middle of the box. In outer space it will remain spherical, but in orbit
it will gradually deform into an ellipsoid. Or float a bunch of bathroom
scales aligned in different planes; if you're in orbit there will be a
slight dependence of the zero point on the alignment.

I think it was something like that.

Place a mass at each &quot;l&quot; end of the box, and time how long it takes
them to gravitate towards one another.  See if they both accelerate
towards the center or if one preferrentially accelerates towards the
other (frame dragging).  See if they mutually gravitate towards one of
the &quot;w&quot; walls (assuming for grins the axis &quot;l&quot; is aligned with the
orbit).

Shoot a bullet across the box. If it follows a curved path
then the box is in orbit.

No... Gravity Pobe B had a *peeker* looking at a star.

In one of Larry Niven's SF stories, someone follows a cometary orbit around
a neutron star (that was the name of the short story).

If he had not recognized the danger he was in as he approached the unseen
neutron star and managed to keep himself stable near the center of gravity
of the spacecraft, the tidal forces would have compacted him in the fore or
aft of the ship.

(the 'general products hull' was made of a special force field that was NOT
torn apart by the forces) but all the equipment inside the ship was
compacted by the tides.

'Tidal forces' result from the fact that objects inside the ship that are
further from the center of gravity of the system are traveling too fast to
remain in the orbit that the center of gravity of the ship follows and want
to escape outward, while objects closer to the point being orbited are
traveling too slow to remain in orbit and want to fall into the large
central mass.

Given sufficient time, any array of stationary objects 'floating in the
air' in the orbiting ship will drift apart, whereas in the isolated ship,
they will remain 'stationary' or drift toward the center of gravity of the
ship.

[I assume that the orbit is sufficiently far from M that a
human astronaut could survive in the orbiting boxcar. For
earth and sun this is valid for any possible orbit, but
not necessarily so near a truly enormous mass.]

Take 7 small test masses and release one at the center-of-mass of boxcar
plus contents; release the other six &quot;above&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, &quot;in front&quot;, &quot;in
back&quot;, &quot;to the left&quot; and &quot;to the right&quot; of the first (selecting the
terms in quotes arbitrarily but consistently). Be sure to release them
carefully so the releasing does not impart any spin or velocity to them
(relative to the box), and also be sure that the boxcar is filled with
vacuum (or put them inside a vacuum chamber within it), as air currents
would otherwise completely dominate any gravitational effects. Now watch
them carefully and accurately: in deep space they will not move relative
to each other or to the boxcar, but in orbit they will. Moreover, how
they move will tell you which way is down, and in which direction the
boxcar's orbit is traveling; very accurate measurements can even tell
you the radius of the orbit and the value of M. Remarkably, you can (in
principle at least) determine the value of M without knowing the masses
of your test objects or boxcar.

Exercise for the reader: explain how one interprets the
motions of the test masses in terms of the boxcar's orbit:
how does one determine down? forward? radius? M?
Hint: you will need exquisite measurement accuracy for
their positions, and good timing accuracy for r and M.

I believe their initial &quot;geodetic&quot; results are related, but the actual
experiment is to measure the precession of gyroscopes, not the motion of
freefalling test masses. Note their telescope monitoring the guide star
was used as the necessary orientation required to accurately establish a
locally inertial frame, relative to which they can measure the
precession. The above gedanken requires much better position accuracy
than is really feasible; GPB required vastly better orientation accuracy
than is feasible using local measurements, so they used a distant star.

If you are willing to consider non-GR theories of gravity, then here
is an example of such an experiment. Shoot bullets inside your boxcar
and measure how their accelerations depend on the magnitudes and
directions of their velocities. These dependencies will be different
for the two situations (with and without the gravitational field).

Others have said how, in principle, you could tell which box
you were in.  However, the title of your post refers to the
equivalence principle which states that it is not possible to
distinguish between two inertial frames in this way and I
wonder if this was the point of your post.

In order to reconcile these two positions you must remember
that the equivalence principle applies to an arbitrarily small
volume of space.  In other words, if it is possible to tell
which box you are in then the box is too big.

Ultimately, with a small enough box, it is not possible to tell
which one you are in.

This should work: set up a sensitive pivoted rod parallel to the axis
of rotation, with pivot along the orbit,  with masses m at each end.
Given a little start or offset angle A, a tidal acceleration
omega^2*L*sinA will cause the rod to align radially. The forces are
omega^2*(R - .5LsinA)  and omega^2*(R + .5Lsin A).
