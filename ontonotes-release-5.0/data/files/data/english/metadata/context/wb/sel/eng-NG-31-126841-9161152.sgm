What happened to the House FISA bill?

The House was scheduled to take up the RESTORE Act today, in an effort to
roll back the August FISA debacle. But _as predicted last  week_
( http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/10/10/13634/131 ) , the bill fell victim to yet
another Republican motion to  recommit (see linked story for a backgrounder on the
motion).
As TPM Election Central _reported_
( http://tpmelectioncentral.com/2007/10/house_gopers_make_bid_to_derail... )   earlier, Rep. Eric Cantor
(R-VA) announced his intention to offer a motion to  recommit the bill with
instructions that it be amended &quot;promptly&quot; to include  language that nothing in
it:
&quot;shall be construed to prohibit the intelligence community from conducting
surveillance needed to prevent Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, or any other foreign
terrorist organization...from attacking the United States or any United
States  person.&quot;
What does that mean? A couple things.
First, it means that Cantor has devised a vote that some strategists worry
will be very tough for Democrats from marginal districts to resist. How, they
fret, will these Democrats be able to explain voting no on an &quot;amendment&quot; that
supposedly ensures that intelligence operatives won't be tied up in red tape
when they need to prevent a terrorist attack?
Second, it means that if enough Democrats sweat this vote and go along with
Republicans, the bill gets &quot;recommitted&quot; -- that is, it's sent back to
committee.
Third, the choice of the &quot;promptly&quot; language means the bill gets delayed, and
can't come to the floor for passage right away. Why is that?
If you love having people stare at you like you're from another planet, read
on after the flip and find out. Then you too can be the person nobody will
sit  next to on day two of the legislative education conference.

There are two basic kinds of motions to recommit: those with instructions and
those without. Motions to recommit without instructions send the bill back
to  committee without telling the committee what to do to fix it. In practice,
that  means the bill is dead.
Motions to recommit with instructions are themselves of two basic types:
those which direct the committee to make certain changes and report (send) the
bill back to the House &quot;forthwith&quot; (in practice, meaning immediately, without
even leaving the House floor), and those directing the committee to make its
changes &quot;promptly&quot; (meaning debate on the bill actually stops, and moves back
to  the committee.
Most motions to recommit offered these days are the &quot;forthwith&quot; type, which
ends up looking to the C-SPAN audience just like any other amendment. It's all
taken care of right there on the spot. But a bill recommitted to be reported
back &quot;promptly&quot; is not allowed straight back onto the floor. The committees
actually have to hold on to them and do the work of fixing the bill
separately,  which often causes enough delay to kill the bill entirely. And even if it
doesn't kill it, it still has go back to the floor, and possibly face yet
another motion to recommit it.
But the most egregious part of this particular motion to recommit is that the
language Cantor claims to want included in the bill is, depending on how you
read it, either redundant (which means recommitting it is a waste of time
even  if you brought it right back onto the floor) or completely meaningless in
any  legal sense (which means recommitting it is not just a waste of time, but
possibly totally stupid and/or evil).
You see, the bill already has a section outlining procedures for the
emergency acquisition of intelligence of this type. So Cantor's motion to  recommit
is just a gratuitous invocation of Osama bin Laden's scary, scary name,  and a
way to make Democrats &quot;choose&quot; between moving the bill forward as  scheduled
or going on record as being &quot;against&quot; tracking down bin Laden.
Of course, what they'd actually be on record against is derailing a bill that
allows intelligence operatives to track any terrorist, so that the
committee can write Osama bin Laden's name in the bill, and make sure that  everyone
knows that he's included among the terrorists the bill allows  tracking.
But hey, if you vote no, you're &quot;voting against tracking down bin Laden.&quot;
Couldn't Democrats just say, &quot;OK, fine. You're an idiot, but if you want bin
Laden's name in the bill, you've got it. Let's just move on, amend the bill
right here and now, and then pass it?&quot;
Well, they could say so, but remember, Cantor purposely chose the  &quot;promptly&quot;
language rather than the &quot;forthwith&quot; language. And that means he's
intentionally demanding a delay, even if the amendment gets added.
Why?
Because this bill revises the complete capitulation bill passed in August. So
the longer it takes to pass this new one, the longer the capitulation bill
stays  on the books. Cantor is more concerned with blocking the new bill than
he is in  seeing that it contain bin Laden's name.
Meanwhile, we're now facing pretty much the same situation we had in August.
The much better House bill is dead in the water until the Democrats can
figure  out a way to be sure their Members will stay home on any motion to
recommit. And  at the same time, the Senate bill -- which is expected to contain the
absolutely  insane retroactive immunity provisions for the telecom companies
that sold out  your private phone records (possibly in exchange for fat
contracts and  preferential review of their merger proposals, but that's another
story) -- will  likely end up being passed before the House bill, making the Senate
bill the  &quot;gold standard,&quot; so to speak. Republicans will be able to get the
Bush Dogs  sweating again, maybe telling them they'll offer a motion to
recommit next time  that adds the immunity provisions so that the two bills match up
better and will  get signed by the president, without everyone having to delay
the next recess to  try to come up with a new bill before the August law
sunsets.
But however this shakes out down the road, for now, the House bill is on
indefinite hold.

Republicans: party before country, corporation before  citizen,  torture and
corruption as long as you make a  buck.

A little Mexican boy goes into the kitchen where his mom is  baking.

He puts his hand in the flour &amp; wipes it all over his face  saying, &quot;Mom,
look, I'm a white boy.&quot;

His mom slaps him in the face &amp; says, &quot;Go show your father&quot;..

He goes to his dad in the living room &amp; says, &quot;Look dad, I'm a  white boy.&quot;

His dad slaps him hard in the face &amp; says, &quot;Go show your  grandmother.&quot;

The boy goes in his grandmothers room &amp; says, &quot;Mira, abuelita,  I'm a white
boy.&quot;

His grandmother slaps him in the face &amp; sends him back to his  mother.

His mother says, &quot;See. Did you learn anything from that?&quot;

To which the boy replies, &quot;Sure did. I have only been white for 5  minutes &amp;
I already don't like you
Mexicans.&quot;
