During a recent transatlantic flight, as we were landing, a passenger got
out of his seat and ran to the toilet. The flight attendants at the back
tried to stop him but he told them that he had diarrhea and locked himself
up in the toilet until after we landed. The flight attendants were furious
and must have notified the authorities because when we got to the gate the
they came on and went to the back to talk to the passenger. I'm not sure
how it ended but I'm pretty sure he was getting arrested as we were walking
off the plane.

Can they legally do anything to you in a case like this? I mean, what could
the guy do, he was literally shitting his pants. I'm sure it's better for
the airline that he deposit the contents of his bowels in the toilet and not
on the seat and all over the floor (and possibly on other passengers!).
Would they press charges?

"/> Dunno if any airline in their right mind would press charges (think of the
shitty publicity), but the law (In US, at least) does say you have to follow
the directions of the flight attendants. And at certain airports (like
Reagan in DC), if anyone hops up after the seat belt light is on, they
&lt;abort the landing&gt;, and either circle or divert. Guess they think there is
a risk of a takeover on final approach, and somebody Kamikazing the plane
into Capitol or White House, like #4 was gonna do back on 9/11.

I'm VERY careful of, and limit, what I eat and drink the 24 hours before a
flight these days- especially if I don't have a confirmed aisle seat. Once
you subtract out the takeoff and landing segments, and the time the aisle is
blocked with drink carts, and figure how many people will be in line, the
available potty slots get limited real fast. I never have been real fond of
flying, but these last few years, they barely pretend that you are anything
but cargo.

bloke was probably hoping he could hold it in until after landing.

The attendants would be antsy because landing is a time when passengers
should be seated and strapped down just in case the plane encounters
trouble or turbulence. They might also be thinking about security,
though this would be something they'd probably be more worried about
during takeoff.

If it was me, I'd take my chances and head for the dunny. I'd rather
spend time explaining myself to cabin staff and security than go through
immigration, baggage claim and customs with shit leaking out of my
trousers. Then again, I'd try to make sure that I was empty *before*
landing. It's not as if it comes as a surprise on a flight across the
Atlantic.

"/> Actually, common law and court precedent both recognize the
validity of the concept of &quot;jury nullification&quot;, which
dictates that a jury may choose to find a defendant not
guilty because they believe the law under which the defendant
was prosecuted is unjust.

The judge isn't allowed to mention this. The defense
attorney isn't allowed to mention this. Indeed, if the judge
or defense attorney mentions this to the jury, it's pretty
much grounds for an immediate mistrial. It is, nevertheless,
recognized as valid legal doctrine.

Jury deliberations are confidential. What is said in the
jury room stays in the jury room. Once a case is in the
hands of a jury, they can find the defendant not guilty for
whatever reason they want, and that not guilty verdict is
irrevocable, at least in countries like the US whose
constitutions or legal systems prohibit double jeopardy.

Now, before you go off all half-cocked telling me how wrong I
am, please google for &quot;jury nullification&quot; and spend some
time reading up on it.

In some ways the law is irrelevant. Consider the actions of some

prosecutors won't leave themselves open to that by pursuing questionable

&gt;Now, before you go off all half-cocked telling me how wrong I

"/> The term &quot;jury nullification&quot; has always been sorta interesting. It's
essentially applied to any verdict that can't otherwise be explained.
I suppose there's no reason why it couldn't apply just as well to a
guilty verdict in some cases, where the jury ignores what appears to
be obvious reasonable doubt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You have no clue what medical condition the OP is talking about.

&gt;&gt;It doesn't matter what medical condition it is.

&gt; It doesn't MATTER? So you cannot possibly conceive of any
&gt; medical condition which could result in an unforeseen yet very
&gt; urgent need to do something that was contrary to your sacred rules?

"/>  Most people can. However, I doubt that you can find a medical
condition that requires immediate use of the bathroom as a
safeguard to life and limb (as opposed to safeguarding your
comfort and dignity). If someone has such a condition, and there
are no other remedies or preventive measures, then most forms of
public or even private transportation are probably not a good
idea.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but not in a slavish, absolutely unbending fashion.

&gt; Unless the law permits bending, it must be obeyed in unbending fashion.

"/> Utter and complete nonsense. There are numerous examples where
the breaking of a specific law is acceptable, in the interests of the
greater good. This doesn't mean that you might not get cited for
breaking the law in the instance in question, only that you will not
be held accountable for it by the courts once all the facts are heard.

For a common example, there is a law against speeding. It is
widely recognized, though, that in a legitimate emergency situation,
you are NOT expected to obey that law in the aforementioned
slavish, unbending fashion, if what you are doing IS done with the
honest intention of aiding those involved and is not done in a reckless
manner. You might get pulled over by the your friendly neighborhood
traffic cop, but if he or she can be convinced that you're doing what
you're doing for a legitimate reason, chances are pretty good that
you will not only be permitted to continue, but will be given an
escort by this very same officer.

There are numerous other examples, including quite a few examples
where the law itself clearly says something to the effect that &quot;in a
legitimate emergency, all bets are off; do what you need to do and
use your own best judgement.&quot; I suppose you would class those in
the &quot;unless the law permits bending&quot; category, but I think you would
be surprised just how many of those explicit exceptions are on the
books.

&quot;Laws,&quot; in the sense of the regulations our society puts on itself, are
hardly in the same class as &quot;laws&quot; in the sense of those things that
govern how the universe operates, and it is a very good thing for
the citizens of a given society to understand that distinction.

"/> Certainly. FAR 91.107 (14 CFR 91.107) requires all passengers aboard
the aircraft to remain fastened into their seats while moving on the
ground and during takeoff and landing operations. There is no exception
for a burning seat.

It should be noted that crewmembers are allowed to go the toilet if they
need to, even during takeoff and landing (FAR 91.105).

The final authority on the aircraft is the pilot in command (FAR 91.3).
She may make an exception to any rule in an emergency if she deems it
necessary to meet the emergency, provided that she files a report on the
deviation with the FAA.

Prosecution of the diarrhea-man would probably be based on FAR 91.11,
which states that &quot;No person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or
interfere with a crewmember in the performance of the crewmember's
duties aboard an aircraft being operated.&quot; Failing to obey the flight
attendant would presumably be interpreted as such interference, as well
as a violation of 91.107 (above). In the strictest sense, disobedience
of a crewmember is not necessarily interference, but in many cases it is
held to be so if it prevents the crewmember from carrying out her
duties. Of course, any type of threat, intimidation, assault, etc., on
the crewmember is also prohibited by 91.11.

"/> In such a case the captain may well want to keep taxiing and move the
aircraft to a better location or position for evacuation if one is a few
seconds away. For instance the taxiways at Kingsford Smith pass over a
busy freeway. You wouldn't want to halt your flaming aircraft directly
over this and have the passengers deplane onto the grids, slopes and
fences, whilst burning fuel floods the tunnel beneath and incinerates
hundreds of trapped motorists.

I couldn't imagine a delay of more than a few seconds in such a
situation, but the best bet would be to remain seated until told to
move. In such situations most of the deaths occur in passengers jammed
up around the exits (which are often unopened). Best to stay put until
the flight attendants have opened their exits and deployed the slides
rather than jam the aisles and prevent the attendants getting to their
assigned spots.

Why do you think that the cabin crew gives the announcement before each
flight for each person to know where the closest exit is?

Typically there are 120 seconds at most to evacuate a burning airliner,
and that is how much time that safety experts say that the entire
airliner should be capable of being evacuated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The flight crew is no more vulnerable to incapacitation than the passengers.

"/> It happens sometimes, and in your world all the passengers would have to
sit there until they burned to death.

I also said above, &quot;or otherwise incapable of communicating anything to
the people in the aircraft&quot;, and that could include a breakdown of the
intercom system, or the fact that the flight crew has already evacuated,
or that the fire prevents them from entering the cabin, etc.,; and these
are not unusual situations in a crash.

"/> Crohn's and ulcerative colitis (collectively IBD) are characterized by
inflammation of the lining of the colon, either continously from the
upper portion of the bowel to the anus, or in patches. (Limited to
the anal area it is called ulcerative proctitus). It can include
both the large and small intestine. It is an autoimmune disease in
which basically the immune system &quot;thinks&quot; there has been some sort of
invader in the system and goes into overdrive, thereby causing the
system to attack itself. I am not a dr, just a patient, but the
inflammation itself (which is sort of like ulceration of the colon
surface and/or underlaying layers) affects the sphincter. It also
affects motility (the speed at which food passes through the digestive
system). Many people, like me, can stay in remission for many years
(8 without meds, 10 with in my case) with non-steroidal meds. Many
like me live normal lives, work, travel, etc. Others are truly
housebound and suffer debilitating &quot;extra-intestinal&quot; symptoms (joint
pain, eye complications, etc.). Despite not having any &quot;need to go&quot;
attacks in many years, I certainly remember them, and they can come on
very suddenly without warning, even if you have not eaten or drunk
anything in a long stretch of time. Despite my remission, when I fly
(and I have been on transatlatic and transcontinental flights many
times in the last 10 years), I always eat very lightly (if at all)
before a flight, do not eat on board, and drink only water. I also
pop an immodium in an excess of caution. And I carry a CCFA
membeship card which I can show if a sudden urge to go should hit me,
whether on a plane, in a line at a public bathroom, etc.

But of course, we know nothing of the person who was the subject of
the original thread...he may have been an IBD sufferer, he may have
picked up something in his travels (like giardia), he may have been on
a medication which had diarrhea as a side effect. Or the airplane
food may have done it.

Oh, and yes, it can be explosive...it's not a pretty sight!

&gt; About as much as you have to do with intelligence.

&gt;&gt;Stop cross-posting shit that doesn't pertain to the .ng

&gt; Stop top-posting. And stop using filthy language.

&gt;&gt; The cases are numerous, where an airliner was down on the ground, and

&gt; Which cases?

&gt;&gt; Why do you think that the cabin crew gives the announcement before each
&gt;&gt; flight for each person to know where the closest exit is?

&gt; To facilitate evacuation.

&gt;&gt; Typically there are 120 seconds at most to evacuate a burning airliner,
&gt;&gt; and that is how much time that safety experts say that the entire
&gt;&gt; airliner should be capable of being evacuated.

&gt; Should be plenty of time.

&gt;&gt; It happens sometimes, and in your world all the passengers would have to
&gt;&gt; sit there until they burned to death.

&gt; Why? They can just remove their seatbelts and leave.

&gt; Note that seatbelts need not remain fastened once the aircraft has
&gt; stopped moving. The FARs say only for _moving_ aircraft on the ground.

"/> Seat belts are to stay on until the seatblet sign is turned off.

Bill, you do realize that your diatribe against cross-posting was
cross-posted to four groups (as was this note, in order to reach you in
whatever group you frequent.) I got it on rec.travel.europe.

I don't like cross-posting either, sooo .... I snip the extraneous
groups. I suggest that you do that too.

Tom

&gt; I can't remember the last time they actually served food on an airplane,
&gt; leastways that didn't come in a little foil bag.

"/> A couple of years ago I upgraded to business class out of Osaka (on United
if I recall) and requested the Japanese meal. It was, hands down, the best
meal I've ever had in the air. Then the next leg, from San Francisco to New
Orleans, I was told, &quot;Mr. Newcomb, we apologize but since you're an
'upgrade' you get the last choice on the meal and all we have left is the
hamburger.&quot; It was a huge, overcooked, hunk of beef on a dry Kaiser roll. It
was all I could do to gag it down. Have you ever sent a letter to an airline
that both praises and castigates them at the same time? I did.
