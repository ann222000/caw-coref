Plan hatched to eliminate geese at Scott Park

By Becky Hershberger, Staff Writer

Scott commissioners have devised a plan to eliminate the diseased geese
droppings from Scott Park for good.

Since unwelcome fowl have become quite the nuisance, officials gave Geese
Police, Inc., of Canonsburg, the green light last week to chase the
red-neck geese out of town.
&quot;We had our movies in the park. There were so many droppings out there,&quot;
said commissioner Eileen Meyers.

Paul Dunn, of Geese Police, will be bringing in his Border Collie to take
care of the job at a total cost of $1900.

The goal is to drive the geese out, and Dunn said they will leave if they
know there's a true predator on-site.

The procedure is to herd the geese from the site two to three times a day
-- seven times a week.
&quot;The approximate time it takes (for the geese to leave) is six weeks,&quot; he
said. &quot;They will come back if they were born here or mated here.&quot;

&quot;It's ingrained into their minds to come back.&quot;
Dunn said each bird generally produces one-and-a-half to two pounds of
droppings.
&quot;My dogs are highly trained. I've taught them old Scottish commands. I
harass them humanely until they leave. These are docile, trained dogs. The
purpose is to teach the geese not to come back.

Geese Police serves the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny, Washington,
Beaver, Butler, Armstrong, and Westmoreland.

&quot;As far as I'm concerned, the population is out of hand. From the '90s this
type of Geese have increased and gone up 19 percent per year,&quot; Dunn said.
&quot;They're pushing them to the urban areas.&quot;
