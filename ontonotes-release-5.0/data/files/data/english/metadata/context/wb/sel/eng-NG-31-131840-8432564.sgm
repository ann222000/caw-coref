Dreamland: Bloodline--the Movie
William Henry interviews Bruce Burgess and Renee Barnett about their new film, the Bloodline. This is a striking visual exploration of the mysteries of the Priory of Sion and, above all, the questions that surround what the church that Jesus left us actually was, and the modern quest to rediscover its lost truth.

Bruce made the award-winning documentary &quot;Area 51&quot; in 1996, and has directed many documentaries on subjects as diverse as the British royal family, CIA assassination squads, Al Quaeda and terrorism. His 'In Search of the Holy Grail' appeared on The Learning Channel.

Renee Barnett is also a documentary and TV veteran, and has worked on &quot;Strange Universe,&quot; &quot;Bigfootville&quot; for the Travel Channel, &quot;Believe It Or Not&quot; and many others.

What can two skilled professional documentarians uncover about the Priory of Sion and such enigmas as the Tomb of Mary Magdalene?

Listen up and take a marvelous and astonishing journey that leads from Jerusalem to France...to the British Museum!

Learn more about the film here.

What is It About August 18?
There is a not to be missed story on Unknowncountry.com today about the fact that a number of crop circles seem to be pointing to August 18-19 as an important date.

Of course, this could be a wrong interpretation of the message of the circles, or it could be that we will have no direct awareness of what happens, but it also could mean that there will be an unexpected event of some sort on that date.

The Unknowncountry.com story makes fascinating reading, and offers links to further information at the bottom of the story.

Read it here.

Meditation Experiences
Whitley has sent me an email that states, &quot;many people are experiencing visual and other responses to the mediations, and many others aren't noticing anything, and this is troubling some of them. Please mention in the newsletter that we all respond differently to these things. I have meditated now for nearly forty years, and have not often had experiences directly related to my meditations. But I have learned one thing: every moment of meditation matters. Nothing is lost.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------

Reserve Your Copy of the Light Body Effect
The Light Body Effect is a two-hour DVD from William Henry available now for pre-order on the Unknowncountry.com store for $23.95.(Subscribers, please use the coupon mentioned in this week's interview with William and posted in the subscriber section for a $3.00 savings.)

The Light Body Effect will start shipping within two weeks, and Whitley Strieber will interview William Henry about it on Dreamland shortly.

The DVD is about the transformation of the human being into a new kind of being--a light being. And lest you think that this is something that cannot happen to you, think again. William provides deep historical detail about those to whom it has happened, and invites you to join him on his quest to regain this lost knowledge, which is vital to us as we pass from the enclosing, supportive era of Pisces to Aquarius, when the planet will no longer be able to support us as we are now.

Click here to place your order.

----------------------------------------------------------

For Our Subscribers: The Light Body Effect
A stunner. It begins as a discussion of William Henry's new DVD, the Light Body Effect, then Whitley discovers that it's actually preparation for the next meditation, which utilizes the Haily Wood &quot;Butterfly&quot; formation that appeared in Oxfordshire on July 16.

You can actually hear the amazement in Whitley's voice as William unexpectedly begins talking about how the light body was portrayed in ancient times as a butterfly!

As your newsletter editor, I'm telling you that something quite amazing is happening with Whitley and these meditations.

Don't miss the chat transcript from the live chat he did last week, either. He seems to me to be coming to a new level of some sort, and it is really something to watch it happening like this.

Not a subscriber? If auto-renew is what stops you, you, you can now have it turned off by simply sending subscribers@unknowncountry.com a note asking them to turn it off. Then your subscription will expire and you can renew manually.

Don't miss this. It is something very special.

Is Chinese-Made Clothing Tainted, Also?
There has been so much concern about tainted foods from China that the Chinese government is now threatening the U.S. with sanctions over the banning of seafood. The U.S. is not alone. Indonesia is also locked in a trade dispute because it has banned Chinese candy found to be laced with formaldehyde, as well as chemically tainted seafood.

Now an Unknowncountry.com reader reports that she experienced a severe skin reaction to the thong on a pair of Chinese-made flip-flops purchased at her local Wal-Mart. Her attempt to get some response from the manager of the Wal-Mart was rebuffed, and so far there is no further information about what might have caused her skin to react to the sandals.

The burns do appear to be chemical in nature, and could have been caused by a substance in the thong. If you have experienced anything similar, please let us know at newsletter@unknowncountry.com .

----------------------------------------------------------

Drones Update
Many of you are asking for an update on the drones. There is no update because there are no more drone photographs, and Isaac has not contributed any more text.

The drones have never been debunked and the Isaac material certainly appears entirely authentic, so this was probably a very intentionally constructed experiment in disclosure, most likely jointly orchestrated, and we at Earthfiles and Unknowncountry and the Dreamland and Coast listeners were the guinea pigs.

What came out of it all was the crop circle meditation series, as Whitley responded to what he understood of this communication. The explosive, amazing crop circles and UFO events that followed appear to have been the visitors' reaction to our efforts.

So there has been no 'update' on the drones in any conventional sense. No CNN stories, no &quot;silly season&quot; reports on NPR. But there has been a hidden update, in the lives of those of us who have chosen to be involved. Oh, yes.

Space Weather News for August 9, 2007
http://spaceweather.com

The Perseid meteor shower has begun. Although the display will not peak until August 12th and 13th, sky watchers are already counting as many as a dozen meteors per hour (including some nice fireballs) during the darkest hours before dawn. Rates could increase 5- to 10-fold when the shower reaches maximum on Sunday night and Monday morning. Advice: Get away from city lights. While many Perseids will be bright enough to see from light-polluted urban areas, the shower's full grandeur is reserved for places with dark and starry skies. This is a good weekend to go camping.

Visit http://Spaceweather.com for photos, observing tips and a sky map. Full coverage of the shower begins today and will continue until Perseid activity subsides.

Messages in this topic (2) 8. Coconut Oil Myth Posted by: &quot;Wanna Be Like Stevie!&quot; wayofthewitch@comcast.net wannabelikestevienicks Thu Aug 9, 2007 6:06 pm (PST) Coconut Oil Myth
by Victoria

Poorly interpreted research leads to wrong information and this is why for years you might have heard that coconut oil leads to hardening of the arteries.

Over 40 years ago researchers found that feeding coconut oil to animals caused their cholesterol levels to rise.

But the problem was that the animals were not fed natural coconut oil, but instead given hydrogenated coconut oil.

The hydrogenation process creates trans fats -- disfigured fat molecules that wreak havoc on your body's cells. Any oils that are hydrogenated (even olive oil) are bad for you and will age you and your skin at a fast rate. To put it bluntly, hydrogenated oils are poison in your body.

To keep your body in good health and avoid aging too soon, don't eat any foods that contain hydrogenated oils.

Replace shortening in recipes with natural coconut oil and you will find your skin is no longer dry, but instead, moist, velvety and beautiful.

Soften Your Knees and Elbows for Pennies

Coconut oil is a wonderful moisturizer for knees, elbows and other dry areas of the body.

After a shower, dry off and rub a little coconut oil on the areas that need it most.

You can find coconut oil in your health food store for about $5.

Have a wonderful and Blessed Lughnasadh!!
Hugs, Jodi

Messages in this topic (1) 9a. A Faery Ritual Posted by: &quot;Stevie Nicks Fan&quot; wayofthewitch@comcast.net wannabelikestevienicks Thu Aug 9, 2007 7:06 pm (PST)
A Faery Ritual

The following Faery ritual and information was submitted by Thalannas Moonbeam, although the author is unknown.

The Fae folk are elusive creatures, temperamental, and wild in nature. Calling upon them is like calling upon any force of nature; they must be treated with care, respect, and reverence. Faeries play by their own rules, and those humans that choose to play along with them must obey the faeries. Contact with wee ones should not be taken lightly! Their integrity is strong, but unusual by human standards. If faeries are approached correctly, they will be an honorable, powerful and delightful friend and ally. Always set up your magick circle when working with faeries!!! If you are unfamiliar with this, PLEASE read other Faerie pages, and a basic Witchcraft page before going any further with this ritual. Your magick circle will protect you from any unwanted entities, and will contain the power that can be raised with this rite, BUT it must be done properly! If you find you cannot handle the power of this rite, courteously end the visit. If an evil entity arrives by accident, end the visit, either with courtesy or rudeness, whichever is safest and most effective. If you do end your rite early, you still must go through the procedure of putting anything back that you may have called, and sealing up any &quot;holes&quot; you have created, grounding yourself, and ending the circle as you normally would. And, even though this is funny, remember it &quot;Do not conjur anything bigger than your head!&quot;

Alpha Work to See the Fae
Do each numbered step before proceeding to the next.
1. Focus on the darkness of the mind's eye, the darkness that's automatically there when your eyes are closed.
2. See that darkness filled with a glowing green, a Faerie green, a magick glow.
3. Feel that magic, green, Fey glow start swirling around you, bathing you in its beauty, bathing you in its magick.
4. Enjoy drinking in that magick for a minute.
5. Let that Fey power feed you, cleanse you, and give you things you need. Let it work its magick on you.
6. Into that green mist, call out for a Faerie friend. Don't demand a visit, for we do not control the Fey Folk. Invite with warmth, courtesy, good will and good cheer.
7. Greet and welcome your visitor with dignity and courtesy. Ask his\her name and his\her need of you. If no name is given you, usually you should end the visit. When you meet someone on the physical plane who will not tell you their name, there is usually something awry, right?
8. Never lightly make an agreement with a Faerie. They take commitments seriously. They are often tricksters, who often have an unusual view as to what life should be like. You may not want the same goals as they.
9. Visit. Then do the following steps. If you fall asleep, your visit might be happening on an unconscious level so you would still need the following steps upon awakening.
10. If you would like, ask your visitor for something you need.
11. Make thanks for the visit, and for any help you were given. At this point it may be appropriate to give or promise a gift, (example: a bit of food and drink left out at night).
12. Perhaps this spirit will become your friend for a while or even a lifetime. You can use this ritual to visit with your faery friend again. But for now, say &quot;Farewell.&quot;
13. After doing something like this ritual, one might be in an altered state without realizing it. If you then do something like drive, walk at night along a city street, or cook, you could possibly go through a red light, get mugged, or burn yourself, all because you were off in another world!

So, after you finish step 12, do the following two steps:
A. Spend some time consciously focusing on the embodied, mundane plane by making your mind concentrate on physical things.
B. Then continue this focusing by looking both ways carefully when crossing streets or paying special, conscientious attention to kitchen safety or whatever focus is appropriate to the activity in which you become involved. Use these two steps until you are well focused onto the embodied plane.
You may feel very sharp and alert, so think there is no need for step 13. Please do it anyway. For one thing, alert as you are, you might be alert only to the SPIRIT plane! Take the time to become alert to the physical realm. If you're feeling really spacy or &quot;out there&quot; add body stretches or do some other very physical but safe activity that will focus you onto your own body.

Hints to help guide you in your endeavor There are many well known ways to see Faery Folk. One is simply to gaze through the opening of a holey stone or self-bored stone. These are usually found near running water or by the sea. They are often seen within a natural ring of mushrooms at sunset or full moonlight. When seeking nature spirits never wear, or carry iron, whistle, or ring bells in the woods.

Trees:
There are many trees which are sacred to the Faery. The elder is said to offer protection for the Faeries from evil night spirits, and it will work for mortals as well. Try looking in oak groves for &quot;Faery Folks are in old oaks&quot;. Acorns can be made into Faery talismans when found by the light of the full moon. The adler is also connected to the Faery, as Robert Graves states in &quot;The White Goddess&quot;:
&quot;The Adler was, and is, celebrated for yielding fine dyes: green from the flowers and brown from the twigs and red from the berries: typifying fire, water and earth. One reason for the adlers sanctity is that when it is felled the wood, at first white, seems to bleed crimson as though it were a man. (or dryad or Faery tree spirit!) The green dye is associated in British folklore with the fairies clothes; so in so far as the fairies may be regarded as survivals of early tribes, forced to take to the hills and woods, the green of the clothes is explained as protective coloring; foresters and outlaws also adopted it in medieval times. Its use seems to be very ancient.&quot;

Roses:
The scent of roses is a powerful attracting force to the Faery. Wear rose oil when seeking the Fae Folk. A rose water preparation can be made to bathe in before doing any rite of the Faery Wicca Tradition. It is traditionally made by taking 21 measures of rose petals and steeping them in a copper kettle with a lid. They should be left to soak for the space of full moon to full moon. This rose water can be used to scent the body and hair and as &quot;holy water&quot; in works of Faery Magick.

Stones &amp; Metals:
When performing any type of Faery Magick be sure that all your ritual tools are made of copper, silver or woods that are sacred to Faery, especially oak. The appropriate gem stones to use are Faery stones (staurorite), quartz crystal, Celestite (blue quartz), Selenite, Labradorite, Amethyst, Flourite, Moonstone, and Amber. Flint is good to guard against mischievous nature spirits. Magickal implements should be carried in a rabbit fur pouch lined with red linen and engraved with the appropriate Faery Runes. *On a personal note, I would not carry anything in rabbit's fur because of my feelings about things made out of animal fur. One idea could be using the red linen to make the whole sack out of, and perhaps draw, or appliqu€  é a rabbit onto the front of the pouch.*

The best time for seeing the fae?
I would imagine that anytime would be good as long as a few simple guidelines are followed. These &quot;rules&quot; are open to debate, but do what you feel is right.
1.) Being a bit sleepy is a good idea. Not TOO sleepy that you will fall asleep as soon as you close your eyes.
2.)You ought to feel a little - what one may call &quot;fairyish&quot; - the Scottish call it &quot;eerie&quot;, and perhaps that's a prettier word.
3.)The last rule is, that the crickets should not be chirping. So, if all these things happen together, you have a good chance of seeing a Fairy - or at least a much better chance than if they didn't. (Good luck finding a warm summer night when the crickets are not chirping! I am not certain to the necessity of this rule either since it is MY feeling that since crickets are there in nature with the fae that they would not be a deterrent.)
If you should be so lucky as to see a Faery, remember, it is said by some that you can only see the Wee Ones when you gaze steadily upon them. If you hold a Faery in your eye it cannot escape.

Incantation and Dance to See Faeries
This can be done anytime during the summer, when the fireflies are out. ( I argue the necessity of it being summer, but, again, use your own judgment. The season being summer would be most conducive to going skyclad, however. Take some bug repellant, or make your own out of a strong steeping of chamomile and orange peel. If you live where there are no fireflies, the proper season when they would be out is August, and what most people call &quot;Indian Summer.&quot;) The rite can be performed clothed, but is best done skyclad.
Find as private a place as you need to to feel comfortable. The place should be very quite, however. Start with your arms out and walk in an open area that fireflies are in. Stop in the same position and call upon the great mother with the following chant:

&quot;Fireflies come dance with me
Fireflies come be with me
Oh Great Mother be with us tonight
With (your name) and the Fairy Folk
Fireflies show your true self
Do not fear me for I am (your name)
Your friend, Your Sister/Brother
Invite me into your world to dance&quot;
(Dance a joyous dance from your heart. Allow yourself to be free and at peace.)
Continue Chant:

&quot;Fireflies, Fairy Folk, Oh Great Mother
Come dance with me, Be with me
Fairy Folk show your true self to me
I will protect you tonight as we dance&quot;
Dance the dance of the Fairy Folk
*Repeat the above five lines, and dance the dance of the Fairy Folk until you feel and see that the

Fairy Folk are with you...Play with them as you like, when you are done do the following:

Begin Chant to End the Dance

&quot;Fairy Folk, Fire Flies, Oh Great Mother
Fairy Folk, I (your name) leave you now
Go back to hide from where you came
Be not sad, or cry or weep
For I (your name) will return
To dance the Dance of the Fairy Folk
Peace be with you. Blessed Be.&quot;
The word &quot;firefly&quot; could be left out, or substituted with the word &quot;faery&quot; instead. No sense invoking fireflies if you have none! Remember, faeries like the number five, so you may have to do the chant, and keep dancing that many times before you see any. Of course you may not see the fae either. According to your own &quot;sensibilities&quot; you may only feel their presence.

The following Faery story was written and submitted by Jeannine Barnard.
OOH Boy! Faeries are loved in this house. I have one little quick story that I will share with you right now. We got proof last year that we have Faeries living in our flower garden. Last year my family &amp; I were out checking on the flowers in the garden, and I mentioned to my other half about wanting to get some Cottage Pinks as I missed having them around. They were all over where I grew up, and I used to pick bouquets of them for my room. A couple of days passed, and I went out to water the flowers, and what greeted me in the garden....A single Cottage Pink plant had appeared out of nowhere! We hadn't gone to the store to get any yet so the only explanation we had was that the Faeries had heard our conversation, and were letting their presence be known. :-)
Blessed Be!
Jen

The following Faery story was written and submitted by Riverwolf.
Well I have not had too many experiences with faeries, at least to my knowledge:) But I will always remember the first time that I consciously saw faeries. I was at a full moon festival down in San Diego on a very secluded beach, there were probably at least four or five hundred people playing drums, flutes, tambourines, dancing around a huge fire that was at least head high. I stopped playing my drum, put it down, went and sat right next to the fire and just started to gaze into and through the fire. After so much time (who knows how long it really was) parts of the flame began to distinguish themselves, to take on a shape of their own. There were fairly human shaped bodies of flame literally dancing inside the fire. They were dancing by themselves, then they began dancing with each other merging into and out of each other. I just sat and watched in complete amazement. They were alive, they were talking to me through their ancient dance! It was probably one of the most life changing experiences that I have ever had. Needless to say, after this I was feeling quite euphoric, the rest of the night was certainly intensified because of the experience I had just had. Definitely a night I won't forget.

Blessings!!

More than myself think she is doing things to hurt her kids physically BUT Know she is doing it Mentally. For me the icing on the cake was a fight she got into at my nieces 18th birthday party! She told my brother in law He was trash..wished she never met him that way she would not have all these DAMN kids....They 6..they was all right there
and heard her..

I don't care about krama I just want to get her out of EVERYONE life...if I could just make her move on leave I think everyone would be happy...not cause her any harm just let her find someone or something that would make her happy would be good. But if has to be dark magic than so BE IT...

Thanks for letting me rant...any ideas?

Irish fairies that are very cunning. Usually found among the clover. An offering of Ale is most welcome.

* Elves *
The Scandinavian form of fairies. Rich sweets as an offering will bring you abudance to come.

* Dryads *
Celtic spirit fairies of the trees. Find them in hollows of trees when Moon is full.

*Gnomes *
They prefer the forests. They are the guardians of sacred grounds, locations and monuments. They have a weakness for gem stones, coins and things that glitter. They are the knowers and are extremely clever. Make a magical offering to the Gnome and ask for &quot;Earthly&quot; favors

* Sylphs *
Spirit fairies of the air. They are transparent and elusive. They seem to be surrounded by a glow. They love acts of courage and quick movement. Make an offering to a Slyph and ask for &quot;Airy&quot; favors

* Selkies *

* Undines *
Spirit fairies of the water. Usually found in forest pools and waterfalls. They have beautiful voices and can sometimes be heard singing over the sound of the water. An offering of perfume will keep them in your favor. Love rules this &quot;watery&quot; creature
The Fae can be found in Mushroom circles in Pine forests, in Hollows of Oak trees and amongst the Acorns, Pine cones and Autumn leaves. Milkweed pods are sure to lead you to the wee ones. Dew drops, primroses, running streams are regular homes for the Fae &amp; Gnome. Here You will find photos of secret Faery homes which prove that Fae DO exist. as well as enchantments to summon Gnomes, Fae and Undines, and gain their favor.

OS SYRIAETH ECH SAFFAER TU
FEWR ECHLYN MOR, NECROMBOR LLUN*
A Recipe to See the Fae

On a Dawn morn or dusk eve, find a special bottle, a pretty one the Fae would like that is.
And pour into it
1 cup gathered spring or rain water
1 teaspoon of Pink Rose petals
€  ½ teaspoon Lavender flowers
Add 3 Quartz crystals
Add 3 Amethyst Chips
1 pinch of Faery sugar (see recipe below)
Nine inch piece of pink ribbon
Now hide this away in a dark cool place for three days. On the third day, again at dawn or dusk, in a place you think you might spot the Fae, like an Oak tree, backyard or mushroom patch in the forest. Even a potted plant, herb or Flower will do. Tie a nine inch piece of Pink ribbon arond bottle neck. Next, close your eyes and sprinkle 9 drops over each eyelid of your €  ’³Faery Potion Water€  ’´, careful not to get it IN your eyes! Next recite this Faery incantation and watch for the Fae.

€  ’³Ribbon of pink, I just might think.
I would like to see the Fae today.
Special sight of Faery€  ’²s flight,
Send to me the way today.
A sprinkle here a sprinkle there,
A secret spell I say today.
Wispy wings and little things,
Are what I€  ’²d like to see today.€  ’´

The Fae are Very shy little creatures! You may need to do this spell more than once!!
Oak leaf Fairy Spell
If a maid that is deep in love will go with her suitor to a lonely place in the meadows or the woods, or to the moors, and place within her own and her lover's shoe a single oakleaf; and if they both will wait there and contemplate their love, and speak it to one another as evening falls and the stars come out, they will, if their patience is good, behold the fairy host as they come to gambol and sport in the wilds.

Four leaf clover spell
If a maid will slip a four~leaf clover into her left shoe, and tie a garland of myrtle and clover around her brow, she will see the fairies as the moon comes up.
by Claire Nahmad

Messages in this topic (1) 13. Self-styled neighbourhood witch casts spell on garden statue thieves Posted by: &quot;Cindi/Epona'Bri&quot; purplesoul@templeuvup.com eponabri Thu Aug 9, 2007 7:31 pm (PST)

House where the thieves struck
Self-styled neighbourhood witch casts spell on garden statue thieves

IT€ ¦’²S not your average reaction to a robbery, but then Phyllida Law € ¦’¶ the
actress mother of film star Emma Thompson € ¦’¶ is not your average neighbour.
She is, in fact, the neighbourhood witch. Or at least that€ ¦’²s what it says on
a sign hanging in her West Hampstead garden, which also features a picture
of what appears to be her, dressed as a witch € ¦’¶ complete with a carroty nose
The picture is next to a mock-up of a Neighbourhood Watch logo.
The signs went up two weeks ago following the theft of two garden statues.
Ms Law, 75, whose films include Peter€ ¦’²s Friends, reacted with indignation at
the loss of the stone animals, which she says were a recent birthday present

She said: € ¦’³The kids love the statues € ¦’¶ they stop and talk to them as they
walk past.€ ¦’´
There are now just two patches of glue where the missing statues once stood.
A dog, a cat, a frog and a hedgehog remain.
Neighbours speculated that her magical fightback had been inspired by her
actress daughter, who lives opposite with her husband Greg Wise.
Ms Thompson gave spell-casting lessons to Hogwarts pupils when she starred
as Professor Sybil Trelawney in the Harry Potter films.
Clearly, she has taught her mother a few tricks as well. Maverick Ms Law has
threatened to put a curse on the crooks unless her stone animals are
returned.
The sign says: € ¦’³Be so kind as to return the children€ ¦’²s stone statues...
otherwise curses will occur!! You have been warned!!!€ ¦’´
A handwritten message on a chalkboard by her front-door reads: € ¦’³I€ ¦’²m so sorry
kids! Someone stole our animals!€ ¦’´
But she has promised neighbourhood youngsters they are in for a treat soon.
Neighbours are backing the crime-fighting witch. Gernot Wurzer, who lives
nearby, said: € ¦’³What she€ ¦’²s doing is fantastic. I hope the bad spell on
whoever nicked it works. People shouldn€ ¦’²t just do that. It€ ¦’²s so mean.€ ¦’´
Another neighbour, who has lived opposite Ms Law for more than 20 years,
congratulated her for tackling crime with humour.
€ ¦’³I€ ¦’²m sure most people in the street support the way she€ ¦’²s done it € ¦’¶ it€ ¦’²s
humorous with a serious intent,€ ¦’´ she said. € ¦’³If people pass and see how
pretty and attractive it is, and what a silly thing a person has done... I
hope it embarrasses them to bring it back.€ ¦’´
