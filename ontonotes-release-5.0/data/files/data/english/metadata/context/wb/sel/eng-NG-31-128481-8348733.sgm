Even I question the 'truth' about 9/11
Robert Fisk, Independent

25 August 2007

Each time I lecture abroad on the Middle East, there is always someone
in the audience - just one - whom I call the &quot;raver&quot;. Apologies here to all
the men and women who come to my talks with bright and pertinent questions -
often quite humbling ones for me as a journalist - and which show that they
understand the Middle East tragedy a lot better than the journalists who
report it. But the &quot;raver&quot; is real. He has turned up in corporeal form in
Stockholm and in Oxford, in Sao Paulo and in Yerevan, in Cairo, in Los
Angeles and, in female form, in Barcelona. No matter the country, there will
always be a &quot;raver&quot;.

His - or her - question goes like this. Why, if you believe you're a
free journalist, don't you report what you really know about 9/11? Why don't
you tell the truth - that the Bush administration (or the CIA or Mossad, you
name it) blew up the twin towers? Why don't you reveal the secrets behind
9/11? The assumption in each case is that Fisk knows - that Fisk has an
absolute concrete, copper-bottomed fact-filled desk containing final proof
of what &quot;all the world knows&quot; (that usually is the phrase) - who destroyed
the twin towers. Sometimes the &quot;raver&quot; is clearly distressed. One man in
Cork screamed his question at me, and then - the moment I suggested that his
version of the plot was a bit odd - left the hall, shouting abuse and
kicking over chairs.

Usually, I have tried to tell the &quot;truth&quot;; that while there are
unanswered questions about 9/11, I am the Middle East correspondent of The
Independent, not the conspiracy correspondent; that I have quite enough real
plots on my hands in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Iran, the Gulf, etc, to worry
about imaginary ones in Manhattan. My final argument - a clincher, in my
view - is that the Bush administration has screwed up everything -
militarily, politically diplomatically - it has tried to do in the Middle
East; so how on earth could it successfully bring off the international
crimes against humanity in the United States on 11 September 2001?

Well, I still hold to that view. Any military which can claim - as the
Americans did two days ago - that al-Qa'ida is on the run is not capable of
carrying out anything on the scale of 9/11. &quot;We disrupted al-Qa'ida, causing
them to run,&quot; Colonel David Sutherland said of the preposterously code-named
&quot;Operation Lightning Hammer&quot; in Iraq's Diyala province. &quot;Their fear of
facing our forces proves the terrorists know there is no safe haven for
them.&quot; And more of the same, all of it untrue.

Within hours, al-Qa'ida attacked Baquba in battalion strength and
slaughtered all the local sheikhs who had thrown in their hand with the
Americans. It reminds me of Vietnam, the war which George Bush watched from
the skies over Texas - which may account for why he this week mixed up the
end of the Vietnam war with the genocide in a different country called
Cambodia, whose population was eventually rescued by the same Vietnamese
whom Mr Bush's more courageous colleagues had been fighting all along.

But - here we go. I am increasingly troubled at the inconsistencies in
the official narrative of 9/11. It's not just the obvious non sequiturs:
where are the aircraft parts (engines, etc) from the attack on the Pentagon?
Why have the officials involved in the United 93 flight (which crashed in
Pennsylvania) been muzzled? Why did flight 93's debris spread over miles
when it was supposed to have crashed in one piece in a field? Again, I'm not
talking about the crazed &quot;research&quot; of David Icke's Alice in Wonderland and
the World Trade Center Disaster - which should send any sane man back to
reading the telephone directory.

I am talking about scientific issues. If it is true, for example, that
kerosene burns at 820C under optimum conditions, how come the steel beams of
the twin towers - whose melting point is supposed to be about 1,480C - would
snap through at the same time? (They collapsed in 8.1 and 10 seconds.) What
about the third tower - the so-called World Trade Centre Building 7 (or the
Salmon Brothers Building) - which collapsed in 6.6 seconds in its own
footprint at 5.20pm on 11 September? Why did it so neatly fall to the ground
when no aircraft had hit it? The American National Institute of Standards
and Technology was instructed to analyse the cause of the destruction of all
three buildings. They have not yet reported on WTC 7. Two prominent American
professors of mechanical engineering - very definitely not in the &quot;raver&quot;
bracket - are now legally challenging the terms of reference of this final
report on the grounds that it could be &quot;fraudulent or deceptive&quot;.

Journalistically, there were many odd things about 9/11. Initial
reports of reporters that they heard &quot;explosions&quot; in the towers - which
could well have been the beams cracking - are easy to dismiss. Less so the
report that the body of a female air crew member was found in a Manhattan
street with her hands bound. OK, so let's claim that was just hearsay
reporting at the time, just as the CIA's list of Arab suicide-hijackers,
which included three men who were - and still are - very much alive and
living in the Middle East, was an initial intelligence error.

But what about the weird letter allegedly written by Mohamed Atta, the
Egyptian hijacker-murderer with the spooky face, whose &quot;Islamic&quot; advice to
his gruesome comrades - released by the CIA - mystified every Muslim friend
I know in the Middle East? Atta mentioned his family - which no Muslim,
however ill-taught, would be likely to include in such a prayer. He reminds
his comrades-in-murder to say the first Muslim prayer of the day and then
goes on to quote from it. But no Muslim would need such a reminder - let
alone expect the text of the &quot;Fajr&quot; prayer to be included in Atta's letter.

Let me repeat. I am not a conspiracy theorist. Spare me the ravers.
Spare me the plots. But like everyone else, I would like to know the full
story of 9/11, not least because it was the trigger for the whole lunatic,
meretricious &quot;war on terror&quot; which has led us to disaster in Iraq and
Afghanistan and in much of the Middle East. Bush's happily departed adviser
Karl Rove once said that &quot;we're an empire now - we create our own reality&quot;.
True? At least tell us. It would stop people kicking over chairs.

&quot;This is a serious, thorough, penetrating analysis of the dark and

When did Tito send suicide bombers to kill children? Nazis did that and
so do these Muslim suicide bombers.

In Deir Yaseen, Haganah, Lakhayim, Stern and Irgun would open the
woman's belly,
get her fetus, chop her fetus on her breasts, then chop her.

When the little children threw stones at the Israeli-American tanks,
the Israeli
soldiers would blow them up with automatic weapons and cannons.

A father was sheltering his son in a corner of street, two Israeli
soldiers were
bidding who will kill both.  First the limp body of the son bent
forward in the arms
of his father then the body of father fell limp on his son.

In Lebanon, the Israeli soldiers intentionally bombed Alkana families,
women
and children, no one else.

These Israeli/Jewish/Zionist savages carpetted South Lebanon with 3.5
million
cluster bombs made in America  during the lull in fighting.

Speaking of terrorism, and suicide bombers, Israel is a terrorist
state, terrorist colony,
that annihilates the indigenous population just to expropriate their
lands and property.

Suicide bombers are Palestinian proud weapons against annihilation.
Suicide
bombers are Palestinian most effective weapon against the Evils of
Imperialism
and Zionism.  Suicide bombers are the most precious sacrifice against
Satanic and
Evil Forces of the Demons of Imperialism and Zionism.

Suicide bombers will be going to Heaven if there is one.  But surely
they raise Hell
to Imperialists and Zionists.  If there is a Hell, Zionists and
Imperialists will be tortured
in them forever.  But on Earth, now, Suicide Bombers, the most
accurate weapon
against the Elements of Evil, are most the Honorable Humans on Planet
Earth.   May Allah
Bless All Suicide Bombers Against Evil.  If there is a Paradise,
Paradise will be inhabitted
by Suicide Bombers as they are the people who paid the Ultimate
Sacrifice to Save
Their Brothers and Sisters and Community from the Evils of Imperialism
and Zionism.
Bless their souls.  Allah is on the side of Suicide Bombers fighting
against
Imperialism and Zionism and they are the Most Respectable Sacrifice
against Evil.

(I will isolate this as a new topic not to be hidden in another
topic.)

Only Africans seem to have such customs.  I do not know why they
should.  I can always say that probably the hot weather may cause the
woman to be overly horny and hence carry more children than the family
can afford.  I never researched the subject.

As for Muslims and the Koran there is no indication any form or shape
that they preactice such mutilation.  Both prophet Mohammed and the
Koran called on stopping harm to little girLs,&quot; What have I done, my
father, to bury me alive?&quot;  This practice was supposed to stop when
Islam was introduced.  But the picture from your side is sad, and
ugly, and brutal and permanent in psychological harm and inducive to
brutality, savagery and child molestation.

Right in the Talmud, all children, boys and girls, are supposed to be
molested age three.  Circumcised penises are sucked by the rabbi and
the same eats the foreskin of the penises.  These practicies are
enough to render Jews as violent, savages, child molesters.  These
Jews live their lives in shame and tend to compensate by either
savagery within their sphere of influence or try to excell in some
professional area.  Such fornications, and child molestations should
stop in your community.  I feel sad to see you guy harming children.
You should rot in prison.
