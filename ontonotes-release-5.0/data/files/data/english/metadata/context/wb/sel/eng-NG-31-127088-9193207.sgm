The last time-stamp on any msgs to asm is 10:53am today.  Either
Google's broken again, or noone's writing anything.  And I've worked
myself back down to the sloooowwww projects.

Then it's probably Googles fault, as it seems ok over here (not using
Google).

Is there another way of acccessing these groups? To be honest, I miss
some of the discussions but I have a terribly difficult time keeping
up with things with the Google reader at work.  I had been using Free
Agent at one time but I can't put that on my computer here at work.

A lot of businesses don't use it as their mail program here nor do they have
access to newsservers, anyway. Many block popular sites as well, if not web
browsing altogether. I'm often quite surprised by the amount of latitude
international posters are given by their employers to play on Usenet or the
internet. Or I was in the past!

Yeah, unless your IT folks are willing to give you account and

Where I live, very few people in the ISPs even know what a news server
is.  It gets very frustrating calling them and them not knowing half
the stuff they should.

Who says they should, and why would that get frustrating for you?

If only you knew that with that one statement, you just found the key,
and put it in the lock, and that all you would have to do now is to
turn it.
