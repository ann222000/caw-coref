Hmm, isn't that a bit like the Japanese blaming the U.S. for Pearl Harbor?

Did you hear what they got when they crossbred a Texas Aggie and a Jap
during WW2?  On Dec 7th, he wanted to bomb the Pearl Brewery. . . . .

You're really smart, so maybe you can assist with this question: Before we

And, one other question: President Bush said he knew Iraq was not connected
in any way with the 9/11 crew. What do you think about Bush's statement?

They were surpressed by a maniacle, tyrannic dictator that set about to kill
Shiites and prevent them from being any part of his government. As an aside,
you probably recall that Shiites are the majority population. No, you

I remember everything. What causes problems for you is that my knowledge of
the region goes further back than just this war. Much further back, to
periods which your president would prefer you didn't think about. If you do
have this knowledge, you gain perspective, and that is verboten among true
believers. You know that.

As far as I can tell, "difficult" is not a challenge for him, its "stupid"
and "arrogant" that he has trouble with. Personal attacks appear to be
problematic too.

If you could refrain from stupidity, arrogance and personal attacks, and
stick to "difficult", he might reply to you.

I didn't say that. You did.

What I said was a response to your question, where were the suicide attacks
before? Before, there were EITHER no attacks because Saddam surpressed them,
or there were attacks but Saddam surpressed the news. Either way, knowing of
the attacks now is a marked improvement over what was going on before.

A valid reason to send troops to Iraq would have been to enforce the Cease
Fire Agreement that Saddam signed with UN forces back in 1991, then promptly
ignored.

PS
I shoulda spell checked earlier, it's "maniacal" and "tyrannical".

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're really smart, so maybe you can assist with this question:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every single day?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They were surpressed by a maniacle, tyrannic dictator that set about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to kill Shiites and prevent them from being any part of his

&gt;&gt; Permanent block list. That must make you feel very powerful, although it
&gt;&gt; should have the opposite effect. Only the very timid are afraid of
&gt;&gt; difficult questions.

&gt; As far as I can tell, &quot;difficult&quot; is not a challenge for him, its &quot;stupid&quot;
&gt; and &quot;arrogant&quot; that he has trouble with. Personal attacks appear to be
&gt; problematic too.

&gt; If you could refrain from stupidity, arrogance and personal attacks, and
&gt; stick to &quot;difficult&quot;, he might reply to you.

That's rich. Charles specializes in insults &amp; arrogance. He can dish it, but
he can't take it. And, he can't answer a simple question, such as:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're really smart, so maybe you can assist with this question: Before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every single day?

&gt;&gt;&gt; They were surpressed by a maniacle, tyrannic dictator that set about to
&gt;&gt;&gt; kill Shiites and prevent them from being any part of his government. As
&gt;&gt;&gt; an aside, you probably recall that Shiites are the majority population.
&gt;&gt;&gt; No, you probably don't remember.

&gt;&gt; I know what you just typed, but I want to confirm something before we
&gt;&gt; continue. Are you saying that Saddam's brutality was a valid reason to
&gt;&gt; send our soldiers to Iraq?

&gt; I didn't say that. You did.

&gt; What I said was a response to your question, where were the suicide
&gt; attacks before? Before, there were EITHER no attacks because Saddam
&gt; surpressed them, or there were attacks but Saddam surpressed the news.
&gt; Either way, knowing of the attacks now is a marked improvement over what
&gt; was going on before.

&gt; A valid reason to send troops to Iraq would have been to enforce the Cease
&gt; Fire Agreement that Saddam signed with UN forces back in 1991, then
&gt; promptly ignored.
">

Here's what we know from people who've fled the country:

- People were able to go shopping without worrying that they'd come home in
a lawn &amp; leaf bag, all ready for burial.
- Entire neighborhoods weren't being turned into brick piles.
- In other words, life is hell there now.

Regardless of HOW stability was maintained, it *was* maintained, and as
anyone without religious adherence to one policy will tell you, we are often
better off with stability no matter WHO enforces it. As evidence of this,
you will notice that our government doesn't say squat about the dictatorship
which runs mainland China.

As far as enforcing agreements, let's not be silly. According to our own
DoD, very little in the way of troops, aircraft or weaponry was able to move
around in Iraq without our knowing about it, during the time we were
monitoring the country's borders. It was a perfect, cheap solution:
rope-a-dope.

There was one problem with it, though: It did not result in enough political
points for certain politicians. It was boring. It did not make for good TV.

Meanwhile, in Fortune magazine (IIRC, might've been Forbes) way back then,
there was an article in which a Raytheon spokesman said the air patrols were
the best new technology testing situation which they and the DoD could ever
dream of.

But still, it didn't make good fodder for political dick-waving.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're really smart, so maybe you can assist with this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They were surpressed by a maniacle, tyrannic dictator that set
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to kill Shiites and prevent them from being any part of his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government. As an aside, you probably recall that Shiites are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; majority population. No, you probably don't remember.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JSB doesn't remember anything that isn't On The Left or doesn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his Loonie Left point of view.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles of Schaumburg.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Side note to JSB:  You're on my permanent block list.  I never see
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; posts unless someone else replies to them.  So I'm NEVER going to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reply
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to your questions because I never get them.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Charles of Schaumburg

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Permanent block list. That must make you feel very powerful,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; although
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; should have the opposite effect. Only the very timid are afraid of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; difficult questions.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, &quot;difficult&quot; is not a challenge for him, its
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;stupid&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and &quot;arrogant&quot; that he has trouble with. Personal attacks appear to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problematic too.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you could refrain from stupidity, arrogance and personal attacks,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stick to &quot;difficult&quot;, he might reply to you.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That's rich. Charles specializes in insults &amp; arrogance. He can dish
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he can't take it. And, he can't answer a simple question, such as:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Before we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every single
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; day?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Your questions are so oblique, yet so narrow that one cannot answer
&gt;&gt; &gt; them
&gt;&gt; &gt; without being wrong.  If it were a court room you would garner a great
&gt;&gt; &gt; many objections and a warning from the judge.
&gt;&gt; &gt; --

&gt;&gt; What's oblique about this?

&gt;&gt; &quot;Before we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every single day?&quot;

&gt; You avoid the point.  I don't blame ya.

Oh. OK. What point do you think I'm avoiding?

Bullshit, and you know it. As rarely as it happens, it's all for show,
because we allow massive amounts of commerce with China. (Korea is not
comparable with China, for other reasons I will NOT discuss now). Our
polticians visit China, and make a little noise about human rights, with a
wink and a nod to their hosts. You know why.

You're changing the subject AGAIN.

It's impossible to hold a conversation when the conversation keeps changing.
You ask about oranges, and I answer. Then you ask about apples, and compare
them to the oranges you just asked about. I attempt to give you more
information about oranges in the hopes you will get why there are lumps in
the juice, and you report that apple juice hasn't got lumps.

You reject everything that was relevent at the time serious decisions had to
be made because there is information today that challenges the information
from then. I specifically asked YOU what you would be screaming about today
if the information we had then was ignored and we went off on a different
tack, and that information turned out to be true. You, my friend, appear to
be the one that has trouble with difficult questions.

Assume for a moment that Bush &amp; Co took the tack that the Pelosi Crew would
have us take AND had not gone to Iraq, BUT it turned out over time that
there really are WMD that Iraq managed to transfer to the likes of OBL, who
in turn delivered them to a schoolyard near your house. YOU would be on the
very same soap box you are stomping around on right now, bitching that GWB
ignored the evidence. He ignored clear and pervasive evidence that all the
world told him was there.

No matter what GWB had done back in 2002 and 2003, you would be bitching
that the wrong action was taken.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles of Schaumburg.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're really smart, so maybe you can assist with this question:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every single
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They were surpressed by a maniacle, tyrannic dictator that set
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to kill Shiites and prevent them from being any part of his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; government. As an aside, you probably recall that Shiites are the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; majority population. No, you probably don't remember.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JSB doesn't remember anything that isn't On The Left or doesn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his Loonie Left point of view.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles of Schaumburg.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Side note to JSB:  You're on my permanent block list.  I never see
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; posts unless someone else replies to them.  So I'm NEVER going to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reply
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to your questions because I never get them.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Charles of Schaumburg

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Permanent block list. That must make you feel very powerful, although
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; should have the opposite effect. Only the very timid are afraid of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; difficult questions.

&gt;&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, &quot;difficult&quot; is not a challenge for him, its
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;stupid&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; and &quot;arrogant&quot; that he has trouble with. Personal attacks appear to be
&gt;&gt; &gt; problematic too.

&gt;&gt; &gt; If you could refrain from stupidity, arrogance and personal attacks,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; stick to &quot;difficult&quot;, he might reply to you.

&gt;&gt; That's rich. Charles specializes in insults &amp; arrogance. He can dish it,
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; he can't take it. And, he can't answer a simple question, such as:
&gt;&gt; &quot;Before we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every single day?&quot;

&gt; Your questions are so oblique, yet so narrow that one cannot answer them
&gt; without being wrong.  If it were a court room you would garner a great
&gt; many objections and a warning from the judge.

"Before we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every single day?" is
oblique?  It's a point blank question that can be answered with a "Yes" or
"No" reply.

I do not agree. The question cannot be asnwered Yes or No, for a variety of
reasons. Saddam ruled with an iron fist, so there might not have been
suicide bombings but there were most certainly the same tensions that result
in the bombings today. And Saddam ruled with an iron fist, so there might
have been bombings but no press coverage, so we never heard of them.

Bottom line, NOTHING has changed relative to the underlying tension among
Sunnis and Shiites. What has changed is the ability to operate, and the
ability to report. Even if one does not like the outcome, having people be
able to do things and having the press be able to report it have got to be
better than what they had before.

Please address these two things separately:

not have any faith at all in our intelligence services. Why is that?

Wait a fucking minute!

You are at the front of the line when it comes to distrust of the
intelligence community. You reject the intelligence they (all of "they"
around the globe) that said there were WMD. Now you accept their lack of
reporting  press coverage inside of Iraq as completely accurate?

I thought you were out in left field, but now I think you are all over the
ball park. Keep going, I'm sure you'll be in the parking lot soon. You
realize you just argued both sides of the same fence don't you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I answered that question, and you changed the subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I widened the subject, because that is the only way to understand the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; situation we created in Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you aware of any other evil dictators we're ignoring lately, other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than the ones who run mainland China? You know: Places which match the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; criteria invented for our presence in Iraq, but which we have no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;humanitarian&quot; interest in?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You're changing the subject AGAIN.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's impossible to hold a conversation when the conversation keeps
&gt;&gt;&gt; changing. You ask about oranges, and I answer. Then you ask about
&gt;&gt;&gt; apples, and compare them to the oranges you just asked about. I attempt
&gt;&gt;&gt; to give you more information about oranges in the hopes you will get why
&gt;&gt;&gt; there are lumps in the juice, and you report that apple juice hasn't got
&gt;&gt;&gt; lumps.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You reject everything that was relevent at the time serious decisions
&gt;&gt;&gt; had to be made because there is information today that challenges the
&gt;&gt;&gt; information from then. I specifically asked YOU what you would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; screaming about today if the information we had then was ignored and we
&gt;&gt;&gt; went off on a different tack, and that information turned out to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; true. You, my friend, appear to be the one that has trouble with
&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Assume for a moment that Bush &amp; Co took the tack that the Pelosi Crew
&gt;&gt;&gt; would have us take AND had not gone to Iraq, BUT it turned out over time
&gt;&gt;&gt; that there really are WMD that Iraq managed to transfer to the likes of
&gt;&gt;&gt; OBL, who in turn delivered them to a schoolyard near your house. YOU
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be on the very same soap box you are stomping around on right now,
&gt;&gt;&gt; bitching that GWB ignored the evidence. He ignored clear and pervasive
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence that all the world told him was there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No matter what GWB had done back in 2002 and 2003, you would be bitching
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the wrong action was taken.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When you wear red sunglasses, the whole world looks rosy.

&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, your president sells F-16s to Pakistan, a country which
&gt;&gt; harbors the very people we want to get our hands on.

&gt; YOUR President -- Clinton -- also sold F16s to Pakistan.

&gt; I'll address your other issues
&gt;&gt; later. By the way, there WAS no change of subject. Rather, you want to
&gt;&gt; keep the focus narrow, but that won't work. The web of information is too
&gt;&gt; large, and ignoring it guarantees that you remain in the dark. This is
&gt;&gt; what your leaders WANT, by the way.

&gt;&gt; Are you like dbu, who doesn't read anything about history? What books
&gt;&gt; have you read lately, dealing with the Middle East from 1970 onward?

&gt; There you go, changing the subject. Again.
">

I'm not changing the subject. I understand that in order to expend as little
effort as possible, you desperately need to keep a narrow focus on one
little detail of this cluster fuck in Iraq. But, the recent history of the
Middle East (1970 onward) tells us that it is not possible to view things in
such simple terms.

This is why I asked you what you've read about this period, and I don't mean
a two page article in a magazine or at a web site. Without a larger view,
you are destined to be the victim of whatever simplistic fairy tale
politicians want you to believe.

So, what *have* you read about this period in history? Any books at all?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your questions are so oblique, yet so narrow that one cannot answer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without being wrong.  If it were a court room you would garner a great
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many objections and a warning from the judge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Before we invaded Iraq, were there suicide bombings every single day?&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is oblique?  It's a point blank question that can be answered with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; reply.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cathy

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not agree. The question cannot be asnwered Yes or No, for a variety
&gt;&gt;&gt; of reasons. Saddam ruled with an iron fist, so there might not have been
&gt;&gt;&gt; suicide bombings but there were most certainly the same tensions that
&gt;&gt;&gt; result in the bombings today. And Saddam ruled with an iron fist, so
&gt;&gt;&gt; there might have been bombings but no press coverage, so we never heard
&gt;&gt;&gt; of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bottom line, NOTHING has changed relative to the underlying tension
&gt;&gt;&gt; among Sunnis and Shiites. What has changed is the ability to operate,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the ability to report. Even if one does not like the outcome, having
&gt;&gt;&gt; people be able to do things and having the press be able to report it
&gt;&gt;&gt; have got to be better than what they had before.

&gt;&gt; Please address these two things separately:

&gt;&gt; - People who have left the country say that although it obviously was not
&gt;&gt; heaven, they didn't have to take their lives in their hands to go to
&gt;&gt; stores, work or school every day.

&gt;&gt; - Although you may be right about lack of press coverage, you apparently
&gt;&gt; do not have any faith at all in our intelligence services. Why is that?

&gt; Wait a fucking minute!

&gt; You are at the front of the line when it comes to distrust of the
&gt; intelligence community. You reject the intelligence they (all of &quot;they&quot;
&gt; around the globe) that said there were WMD. Now you accept their lack of
&gt; reporting  press coverage inside of Iraq as completely accurate?

&gt; I thought you were out in left field, but now I think you are all over the
&gt; ball park. Keep going, I'm sure you'll be in the parking lot soon. You
&gt; realize you just argued both sides of the same fence don't you?

I never gave you any indication that I didn't trust the CIA &amp; NSA. They may
not be correct all the time, but since they have people "on the ground", so
to speak, I trust them far more than a president who, when asked about his
reading habits, said "Not much - mainly newspapers".

The Prez surrounded himself with people that told him the intelligence

trust those reports, and have publicly stated so. Now, you are suggesting
that it is I that do not trust the intelligence because since there was no
press coverage of the lack of press coverage, then there must have been
press coverage.

You ARE changing the subject, repeatedly. You ask me about A, then compare
it to B (which has little if anything in common to A) then when I try to
talk about that, you switch to C.

No wonder Charles put you in his killfile. Talking to you is as frustrating
as talking to a 10-year old that has attention deficit disorder.

The history of the Middle East in general, and Iraq in particular changed at
the close of WWII when the NATO countries carved out Israel from a barren
wasteland that even the Arabs didn't really want and did not habitate in any
great numbers. The Jews brought in irrigation systems to turn the desert
into a comparative paradise. They kept their profits to themselves and did
not share with the Arabs that remained. The Arabs have never been freindly
with the Jews, and this goes back much further than 1970, but they demanded
Israel give them stuff. They want recognition, but refuse to recognize. A
bit of a double standard from where I sit.

Back to Iraq and the intelligence. The intelligence was united behind the
idea that he had WMD. Period. Later, it was found that the WMD were not
there, but that was later. The borders of Iraq were altered at the close of
WWII, forcing opposing religious sects under unified government --
government that insists on tying religion and government together. CLUE:
When religion and government are connected at the hip, nothing will work out
well. Nothing. Saddam took over control of Iraq through a brutal coup, and
set up his government with the minority religion at the roots and he engaged
in ruthless slaughter of the majority religion and its leaders and devotees.

What else do you want to know?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; view
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things in such simple terms.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is why I asked you what you've read about this period, and I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mean a two page article in a magazine or at a web site. Without a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; larger
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; view, you are destined to be the victim of whatever simplistic fairy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tale
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; politicians want you to believe.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So, what *have* you read about this period in history? Any books at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all?

&gt;&gt; &gt; You ARE changing the subject, repeatedly. You ask me about A, then
&gt;&gt; &gt; compare
&gt;&gt; &gt; it to B (which has little if anything in common to A) then when I try
&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; talk about that, you switch to C.

&gt;&gt; &gt; No wonder Charles put you in his killfile. Talking to you is as
&gt;&gt; &gt; frustrating as talking to a 10-year old that has attention deficit
&gt;&gt; &gt; disorder.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The history of the Middle East in general, and Iraq in particular
&gt;&gt; &gt; changed
&gt;&gt; &gt; at the close of WWII when the NATO countries carved out Israel from a
&gt;&gt; &gt; barren wasteland that even the Arabs didn't really want and did not
&gt;&gt; &gt; habitate in any great numbers. The Jews brought in irrigation systems
&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; turn the desert into a comparative paradise. They kept their profits to
&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves and did not share with the Arabs that remained. The Arabs
&gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt; never been freindly with the Jews, and this goes back much further than
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1970, but they demanded Israel give them stuff. They want recognition,
&gt;&gt; &gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt; refuse to recognize. A bit of a double standard from where I sit.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Back to Iraq and the intelligence. The intelligence was united behind
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; idea that he had WMD. Period. Later, it was found that the WMD were not
&gt;&gt; &gt; there, but that was later. The borders of Iraq were altered at the
&gt;&gt; &gt; close
&gt;&gt; &gt; of WWII, forcing opposing religious sects under unified government --
&gt;&gt; &gt; government that insists on tying religion and government together.
&gt;&gt; &gt; CLUE:
&gt;&gt; &gt; When religion and government are connected at the hip, nothing will
&gt;&gt; &gt; work
&gt;&gt; &gt; out well. Nothing. Saddam took over control of Iraq through a brutal
&gt;&gt; &gt; coup,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and set up his government with the minority religion at the roots and
&gt;&gt; &gt; he
&gt;&gt; &gt; engaged in ruthless slaughter of the majority religion and its leaders
&gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; devotees.

&gt;&gt; &gt; What else do you want to know?

&gt;&gt; You just explained everything. I don't need anything more from you.

&gt; JSB learned more today than than he had in the last 25 years.
">

Tell us why you don't read books. Too embarrassing? Shall I dredge up the
message in which you provided the stupidest reason imaginable? A reason most
parents would never accept from their children?

By the way, take another look at Jeff's paragraph, above, beginning with
"The history of the Middle East...". Notice two things:

- The anti-Semitism
- The "profits" statement which indicates that he thinks welfare is a good
thing.

Jeff's busted. He hates Jews, and he's a liberal who believes in welfare.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmm, isn't that a bit like the Japanese blaming the U.S. for Pearl
&gt;&gt;&gt; Harbor?

&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles of Schaumburg.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you hear what they got when they crossbred a Texas Aggie and a Jap
&gt;&gt;&gt; during WW2?  On Dec 7th, he wanted to bomb the Pearl Brewery. . . . .

&gt;&gt; And, one other question: President Bush said he knew Iraq was not
&gt;&gt; connected in any way with the 9/11 crew. What do you think about Bush's
&gt;&gt; statement?

&gt; You're changing the subject.

No. It's an all-encompassing subject which you are unable to digest. Go back
to sleep, Jeff. And, don't look in the mirror.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not changing the subject. I understand that in order to expend as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; little effort as possible, you desperately need to keep a narrow focus
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one little detail of this cluster fuck in Iraq. But, the recent

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; government that insists on tying religion and government together.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; CLUE:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When religion and government are connected at the hip, nothing will
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; work
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; out well. Nothing. Saddam took over control of Iraq through a brutal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; coup,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and set up his government with the minority religion at the roots
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; engaged in ruthless slaughter of the majority religion and its
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; leaders
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; devotees.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What else do you want to know?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You just explained everything. I don't need anything more from you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; JSB learned more today than than he had in the last 25 years.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Tell us why you don't read books. Too embarrassing? Shall I dredge up the
&gt; &gt;&gt; message in which you provided the stupidest reason imaginable? A reason
&gt; &gt;&gt; most
&gt; &gt;&gt; parents would never accept from their children?

&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, take another look at Jeff's paragraph, above, beginning with
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The history of the Middle East...&quot;. Notice two things:

&gt; &gt;&gt; - The anti-Semitism
&gt; &gt;&gt; - The &quot;profits&quot; statement which indicates that he thinks welfare is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; good
&gt; &gt;&gt; thing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff's busted. He hates Jews, and he's a liberal who believes in welfare.

&gt; &gt; I read books.  I just don't read your books and you don't like that.
&gt; &gt; Now you go read a book.
&gt; &gt; --

&gt; If you read nothing about the history of our country, you need to be silent
&gt; when presented with opportunities to discuss history.

Who's gonna silent me, you?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not changing the subject. I understand that in order to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; expend
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; little effort as possible, you desperately need to keep a narrow
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; focus
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one little detail of this cluster fuck in Iraq. But, the recent
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; history
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the Middle East (1970 onward) tells us that it is not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; possible
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; view
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things in such simple terms.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is why I asked you what you've read about this period, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mean a two page article in a magazine or at a web site. Without
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; larger
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; view, you are destined to be the victim of whatever simplistic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fairy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tale
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; politicians want you to believe.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So, what *have* you read about this period in history? Any books
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You ARE changing the subject, repeatedly. You ask me about A,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; then
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; compare
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it to B (which has little if anything in common to A) then when I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; try
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; talk about that, you switch to C.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No wonder Charles put you in his killfile. Talking to you is as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; frustrating as talking to a 10-year old that has attention
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; deficit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; disorder.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The history of the Middle East in general, and Iraq in particular
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; changed
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at the close of WWII when the NATO countries carved out Israel
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; barren wasteland that even the Arabs didn't really want and did
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; habitate in any great numbers. The Jews brought in irrigation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; turn the desert into a comparative paradise. They kept their
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; profits
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; themselves and did not share with the Arabs that remained. The
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Arabs
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never been freindly with the Jews, and this goes back much
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; further
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; than
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1970, but they demanded Israel give them stuff. They want
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recognition,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; refuse to recognize. A bit of a double standard from where I sit.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Back to Iraq and the intelligence. The intelligence was united
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; behind
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; idea that he had WMD. Period. Later, it was found that the WMD
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; were
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there, but that was later. The borders of Iraq were altered at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; close
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of WWII, forcing opposing religious sects under unified
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; government --
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; government that insists on tying religion and government
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harbor?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles of Schaumburg.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you hear what they got when they crossbred a Texas Aggie and a Jap
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during WW2?  On Dec 7th, he wanted to bomb the Pearl Brewery. . . . .

&gt;&gt;&gt; And, one other question: President Bush said he knew Iraq was not
&gt;&gt;&gt; connected in any way with the 9/11 crew. What do you think about Bush's
&gt;&gt;&gt; statement?

&gt;&gt; You're changing the subject.

&gt; No. It's an all-encompassing subject which you are unable to digest. Go
&gt; back to sleep, Jeff. And, don't look in the mirror.

Now, you're changing the subject AND being rude.
