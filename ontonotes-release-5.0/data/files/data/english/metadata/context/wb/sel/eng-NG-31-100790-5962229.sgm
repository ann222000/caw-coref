I know this is old news but I've been away for awhile and I've been hearing
a lot about the new 360 which is do out soon. It will have a larger HD, do
IPTV, and the best part, it will be less noisy.
So I'm just wondering how you guys that have the 360 feel about MS coming
out with a new model after only a year and a few months? I know I'd be
pretty pissed off. But I waited because I figured that with that small HD MS
was going to have to do something. I am surprised that they are doing this
so soon. I guess they realize that if the 360 is really going to make it as
a media hub in the living room, then they had better cut down on how loud it
is. JLC

No one is asking you to change your 360. It's not like the games will be
different. Sheesh.

I knew how big the hard drive was when I bought mine. If you can buy one
with a larger hard drive, quieter, smaller, cheaper than good for you, It
does not change what I bought nor the time I have had it.

The only thing that MS has confirmed for sure is the IPTV service.
Nothing else has been announced.

OK, well just have to wait a see. You must not listen to the podcasts I
listen to. I got this info from
this podcast http://www.twit.tv/ww Paul Thurrott has all the inside info
about what MS is up to. Sure nothing is "official" but never the less this
is what's in the works. JLC

So what? If needed then I'll just plug in a larger one.

Who cares? Xbox is for playing games not for watching TV. Or do you also
hoover your flat by using your car instead of a vacuum cleaner? Where do
you come from? From Pennsylvania or what?

However If I'm not copletely mistaken, then (unfortunatelly) M$ will push me
to take an update.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

With a hacked firmware on a chip the current xbox360 is also silent. ;)

Btw, you forgot HDMI. However this isn't that important. You probably won't
see a difference between component at 720p an HDMI at 1080p.
It might be only important if the content would stop play analog. However
IMHO it won't happen so soon.

Well I payed for my xbox360 250,- EUR with a hdd, 2 wireless controllers, 2
games, 1 modchip with hacked firmware and 1 year of gold xbox live. Thus no
complaints here.

For that part I have a linux media server at costs of 40 EUR and a day of
spare time; With no noise at all. So recall: hoover/car. I just give a
damn. ;)

Enjoy your new one m8.

The new system will cost more than the Premium apparently so in a way I
don't care. I mean if they lower the price of the premium by 100$ and
offer this for 100$ more, it simply makes sense. People would pay the
extra dough for IPTV alone.

Oh no.
Didn't you hear?
MS fixed all the problems ;-).
If I didn't think the system was in working order I wouldn't sell it on
ebay.
I wouldn't do a thing to tarnish my feedback on ebay.

I might just buy one without selling "my" 360.
I recently added a newer tv and sound system right next to my theater room.
It would be cool to have when my sons or my friends visit to game online
using different accounts instead of splitting a screen.

You think I'd have been happier sitting around in my room not playing
the XBOX360 for the last year, just in case a better one came out.

I'm very happy to have had all the fun i've had out of the unit, and
it should surprise no one that there will have been revisions along
the way.

I may even buy another one, if they are a huge amount quieter.

Consoles undergo hardware revisions all the time.  Look at the PS2, for
instance.  Not counting the SlimLine version, the PS2 underwent many
revisions, among them:

* manufacturing fix for the DRE error
* later versions included the ethernet adpater
* firmware upgrade to provide progressive scan for DVD movie playback
* remove firewire port

Even if Microsoft releases a revised 360 with a larger HDD, you can also
bet that you'll find the larger HDD for sale by itself for those  existing
customers wishing to do an upgrade - which will be required for IPTV (13GB
just isn't enough space.)

There were also rumors that Microsoft's new 360 would also include a HDMI
port but nothing's been confirmed about this yet.  This would be a more
serious addition as you can't simply glue the port on the back of your
existing 360 as an after-market upgrade ;)

Anyways, my prediction is that we'll see this new version come out at the
same $400 price the current Premium box costs.  Once stores sell out of
the 20GB version, they'll just replace them with this one.  I bet the Core
will remain - being the revised hardware with no hard drive - for the same
$300 price.  Yes, I know we all wish the Core would go away and die a
horrible death, but I'm guessing Microsoft will keep it around for the
time being.

The new, smaller CPU, which will use less power and therefor produce less
heat has pretty much been confirmed for awhile.

IPTV will require some form of extra storage as the 20GB drive just won't
cut it.  Maybe you'll be able to plug in a USB drive, or save to a network
drive (your PC) but I'm guessing the easiest would be to bump the HDD
included with the 360.  As a bonus, this would take away another advantage
of the PS3 vs. 360.
