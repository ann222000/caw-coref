Is the harmonic balancer bolt a reverse thread?  I have been trying to pull
mine from a 1990 toyota truck.  Its not budging, wondering if this is why.
Have used an impact wrench, the starter method and have heated the bolt.
Just wondering if Im just going the wrong way?!

In the 1986 &amp; 1997 2.2L CAMRY this bolt is a normal Right Hand thread, (CCW
to loosen). Does your impacy wrench impart &gt;250 ft-lb? I would try locking
the flywheel with a large shank srew driver.

It's Right hand thread. Try a long (~5') cheater bar/pipe on your
breaker bar and 19mm socket.  Put the truck in 1st gear, block the
wheels, and engage the emergency brake.  It'll pop loose!

Heating is not a good idea.  Once you get the high strength bolt out,
inspect the pulley because there is rubber in there.

Due to the heat, you should probably replace the bolt.  I've done three
timing belts and all bolts were regular thread (CW to tighten).

Yes, it is a real bear to break lose!  I thought I was going to die or shear
the bolt the first time I did it.  Used a 5' cheater bar and broke 3
sockets.  Had to custom make a jig to hold the pulley while removing the
bolt.

Good Luck!
Paul.

The thread is a standard thread on the bolt.  I have found that the
easiest way to hold the pulley in place is to use an old fan belt,
wrap it back over itself until it binds on the pulley and then hook
the loose loop of the belt on the truck frame.  This saves removing
the starter to bind up the flywheel.  The other thing that works is
putting the vehicle in 5th gear if it is a manual transmission with
the emergency brakes on.  Don't use 1st gear because the engine has
more torque against the wheels and the truck will still creep on you
as you turn the crankshaft.  Buy a 6 point impact socket so you don't
split it using the breaker bar.  I have done plenty using this method
with a 25&quot; 1/2&quot; drive breaker bar.

FWIW, in addition to the other posts, the kit that I got for my '99 Xcab
had a replacement bolt in it. It also had a replacement shoulder bolt
for the tensioner. You should be able to get both at a NAPA parts store,
or at the dealer if neccessary.
