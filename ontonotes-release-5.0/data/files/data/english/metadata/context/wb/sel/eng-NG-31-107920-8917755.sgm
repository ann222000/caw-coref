Bridgestone tyre technicians last night revealed that McLaren ignored
their advice to bring Lewis Hamilton into the pits two laps before his
race ended when he skidded off the Shanghai track into a gravel
trap. The championship leader had been struggling to keep his car on
the track for some time, his tyres clearly shredding and worn
flat. Now he must go to the season's last race in Brazil in a
fortnight to try to claim his first title. It will be a three-way
fight, with his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, four points behind him and
yesterday's race winner, Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, seven points
behind.

Although nobody at the tyre company would comment on the matter, it is
understood that the Bridgestone engineers told McLaren to abandon
their gamble of keeping Hamilton going with wearing tyres to avoid
having to make an extra pit stop for fuel later in the race. At the
time Raikkonen, in second place, was slicing several seconds a lap off
Hamilton's lead.

Hamilton said he was dismayed at sliding off just after entering the
pit lane but remained confident that he would win the title. &quot;I was
having a great race and we didn't know whether it was going to rain or
not,&quot; he said. &quot;The tyres I was on were getting worse and worse and in
the end I could almost see the canvas underneath.

&quot;Coming in to the pits it was like ice. I couldn't do anything about
it. My mirrors were dirty; I couldn't see the tyres but it felt like
they were completely finished. I was coming in on that lap so it could
have worked out perfectly. I'm sorry for the team; they did a
fantastic job as always. We've still got one more race to go. Don't
worry, I can still do it.

&quot;When I got out of the car I was just gutted because I hadn't made a
mistake all year and to do it on the way to the pits is not something
I usually do. But you can't go through life without making
mistakes. I'm over it, now we look on to Brazil.&quot;

Ron Dennis, McLaren's team principal, said that Hamilton accepted some
share of the blame for his failure to finish a race for the first time
this season. &quot;I think Lewis drove an excellent race,&quot; he said. &quot;This
was about how wet the pit lane was, tyre condition - it's just one of
those things. He was very keen to maintain the lead and was so
comfortable pulling out a gap on Kimi, although I suppose he gave the
tyres just a little bit more of a hard time.

&quot;I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and I don't think
Lewis did. But the circuit was much drier than the pit lane entrance
and that made the difference. Lewis has been very controlled,
obviously disappointed, and he acknowledges his part in the whole
thing.

&quot;We were unconcerned with Kimi and happy to just let him past. The
problem was rain, and Lewis's tyres were in the worst condition. We
weren't at all fazed about Kimi; we didn't care about Kimi; we weren't
racing Kimi; he was racing Fernando. Kimi winning and Lewis coming
second was adequate - but it just didn't work out that way.&quot;

McLaren's chief executive, Martin Whitmarsh, admitted the team had to
shoulder much of the blame for not calling Hamilton in earlier. &quot;With
hindsight we should have brought him in one lap earlier and we would
probably have got the job done,&quot; he said. &quot;But it was a long race and
we made those calls. Sometimes they're bang on, sometimes they're not
quite right.&quot;

Whitmarsh said Hamilton would inevitably blame himself for how his
race ended. &quot;Lewis wanted to win this race in style and was clearly a
little bit harder on his tyres than some of the drivers around him,&quot;
he said. &quot;He is such a professional and such a perfectionist, of
course he'll blame himself, but he's part of the team. We win together
and sometimes we get it wrong together. We're going to Brazil for a
really exciting finale. He'll be determined to win in Brazil.&quot;

Alonso, whose feud with his team and team-mate showed no signs of
cooling at the weekend, must still beat Hamilton in Brazil to stand a
chance of retaining his title. &quot;It's a very difficult championship
because I know it will not be easy to take four points off Lewis,&quot; he
said. &quot;The performance will be, I hope, very similar between the two
of us all weekend. Hopefully I can do a good race, but for the
championship I still have to do something really dramatic if I want to
win.&quot;

Lewis did not have a tyre failure, and full credit to Bridgestone for the
tyre hanging together. McLaren's decision to keep him out there did cost
him time, but it was Lewis' mistake that cost the race.

Depends what you mean by &quot;tyre failure&quot;. Down to the cover wouldn't be
classed as anything else in an MOT...

Well, duh...

He admitted he made a mistake. Had McLaren brought him in earlier when
the tyres had a least some grip, it seems unlikely that he'd have made
the same mistake. Your anti-Hamilton glasses now obscure your view as
much as your old pro-Schumacher ones did...

Yes, we do know.
