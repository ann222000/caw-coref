Let us not find revolutionaries where there are none: A look at the Kenyan
opposition party
http://www.newint.org/features/special/2008/01/11/kenya/index.php
Mukoma wa Ngugi (2008-01-10)

One cannot fully grasp what is happening in Kenya and Africa without
considering the changing nature of opposition movements and the differences
between a people powered movement, or a democratic revolution, and a
plethora of movements that consolidate democratic institutions for
international capital while flying under the radar of democracy.

Even though here below I am mainly speaking about Raila Odinga and the
Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), I could just as easily be speaking about
Mwai Kibaki and the Party of National Unity (PNU). It is only because ODM
has actively courted the image of being a people powered movement engaged in
a democratic revolution that I draw your attention to it. Amilcar Cabral
once said &quot;tell no lies, claim no small victories.&quot; It is in that spirit
that I write.

Let me begin by pointing to the question of ethnicity and say this: In the
same way you ought to be surprised to meet a white American denying the
existence of racism in American politics, so should you be when you meet an
African denying that ethnocentrism is deeply entrenched in African politics.
Racism is a historical creation that serves a function – so is 'tribalism.'
In the same way that leaders in the West manipulate race and fear for
political goals, so do African leaders. Ethnocentrism can be benign or
extremely vicious depending on its conductor. Ethnocracy, like a racist
power structure, exists to the extent it is able to obscure for the victim
and the activist the root causes of economic, political and social
exploitation. It misdirects.

Let us also consider Kwame Ture's (Stokely Carmichael) reminder that we
should not mistake individual success for collective success. The majority
of Kenyans -- Luos, Kikuyus, Luhyas etc -- are poor. The 60 percent of
Kenyans living under two dollars a day cut across all ethnicities. The
Kikuyu elite live at the expense of the Kikuyu poor; it is the same for
other ethnicities. There is much more in common between the poor across
ethnicities, than between the elite and the poor of each ethnicity. Racism,
nationalism, and ethnocracy all ask that the poor die in the defense of
economic and social structures that keep them poor. It is no surprise that
those who have been both dying and doing the killing in Kenya in the past
week are the poor. Yet they are killing along ethnic, not class, lines.

And in the same way that over time western political parties come to
represent different and contradictory positions, so have African political
parties. In the dictatorships of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, the opposition
parties were the good guys. Progressive international political analysts are
still working with that framework, which has blinded us to glaring
present-day contradictions. The assumption that opposition immediately means
people-power cannot be sustained by an analysis informed by the complex
shifts in African politics in the last two decades. Take Zimbabwe, for
example. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change is a neo-liberal
party. Calling it revolutionary or anti-imperialist would be wrong. In
Kenya, both the sitting government and the opposition exchange members
fluidly as they position and reposition themselves, eyes on the national
cake. William Ruto, a top leader in the ODM was previously a treasurer for
the KANU Youth Wing – a political thug organization created by former
dictator Moi, who is now in Kibaki's camp. And the recent church killings
that claimed over 50 lives took place in Eldoret, which William Ruto has
represented in parliament for many years.

Therefore not all opposition parties are anti-imperialist or opposed to the
move by global capital to consolidate the world. At a time when the rich
nations and their elite are getting richer, and the poorer nations and the
poor within them are getting poorer, some opposition parties will choose the
side of global capital. ODM is composed of some of the wealthiest people in
the country. For example, the Odinga family owns Spectre International, a
molasses company in conjunction with a multi national petroleum and diamond
mining company. The international press, which refers to Raila as a
&quot;flamboyant millionaire&quot;, is not entirely wrong.

With the above said, analysis of what it means to be a people powered
movement is crucial. For people-power politics to be effective, solidarity
has to be across ethnicity not along it. In other words, a people power
movement has to at its basis be informed by the consciousness of a
collective oppressed. Because it has no real grass roots developed over
years of working with and for the people, ODM can only rile up
discontentment by pointing to one ethnicity rather than organizing the whole
country against elite exploitation. Like any populist movement it takes the
worst fears of a people (fear of Kikuyu domination for example) and plays
them out in the national stage. A people power movement on the other hand
peels away these fears to reveal how power and wealth are being distributed.
Because ODM has not done this, its supporters have identified the fellow
poor Kikuyu as the enemy. A people power movement would have directed its
energies and anger at the state not at another ethnicity.

A people power movement declares its solidarity with other marginalized
peoples across the world. It is third-worldist in vision. A people power
movement, because its vision grows organically from its struggle and
engagement with the people, exhibits a stand against exploitative
international economic arrangements because its constituents are
impoverished through them. ODM cannot be termed as radical pan-Africanist or
third-worldist, rather it has a populist consciousness.

Also, the shell – the façade -- of a people power movement can be used by a
national elite to seize power for international capital. Rather than use the
term populist/people power to refer to ODM, it is appropriate to borrow a
term from the International Republican Institute. The term the IRI (
www.iri.org ) uses is &quot;consolidating democracy,&quot; referring to a technique it
used in the Ukrainian Orange Revolution and in Haiti against Aristide.
Consolidating democracy translates into bringing together civil
organizations (religious, universities, local NGO's, women's organizations
etc), and uniting various opposition factions into one large electoral
force. If missionaries paved the way for colonialism, evangelists of western
democracy like IRI pave the way for US foreign policy.

The sole purpose of consolidating democracy is to remove the sitting
government. There is no coherent underlying people centered ideology in this
goal – no interest in empowering the people, or returning economic and
political institutions to them. Rather than develop real roots with the
people so that when in power ODM becomes an extension of them, ODM has taken
the easy route of consolidating democracy following the IRI model.

We urgently need to distinguish between people power movements (such as
those we have seen in Latin America), populist movements, and neo-liberal
opposition movements that consolidate democratic institutions for global
capitalism. People power movements are a fifth force usually in opposition
to the legislature, executive, judiciary and military. When they seize power
through democratic means, they immediately attempt to transform the other
four forces into revolutionary instruments. Laws nationalizing resources or
redistributing land and resources are passed. The army is transformed from
an instrument of intimidation into one that helps in times of disasters – in
short a people power government places the people at the center of the
state. When a movement that has been consolidating democracy gets into power
it does the opposite, and the democratic structures become instruments of
global capital and US Foreign policy. Liberia, for example, after working
with IRI is one of the few countries to open its national door to the US
African Command Center.

We should at least consider that the ODM has in the last few weeks not been
engaged in the last phase of a people power revolution but rather in the
last stage of consolidating neo-liberal democracy - using the people as the
battling ram against the state. This is where the neo-liberal party calls
for millions to take to the streets with the hope of immobilizing the state.
Because consolidating democracy requires the ebb and flow of violence from
the state and protest from the people, Raila could cynically tell a BBC
reporter when asked whether he will appeal for calm that &quot;I refuse to be
asked to give the Kenyan people an anesthetic so that they can be raped.&quot;

In case you are wondering, let me say this: for progressives, Kibaki is not
the answer. Before the elections, the Kenyan Human Rights Commission
released a report implicating the Kenya police in extra-judicial killings of
close to 500 young men, all from poverty stricken areas such as Kibera and
Mathare, slums currently up in flames. This is a stark reminder that the 6
percent economic growth was not trickling down to the people. Also that vote
rigging took place (on both sides it is turning out) is almost certain.
Enough doubt has been cast by the electoral commissioners to make a recount
of the votes, a reelection, a united government or another suitable solution
a matter of democratic principle.

If the country is to heal, reconcile and find justice, progressive voices
should call for a UN probe into the December – January post-election ethnic
cleansing in Eldoret and other areas. There should be calls and support for
a United Nations probe into the 1994 Rift Valley killings in which a
reported hundreds of Kikuyus were killed and thousands displaced during
Moi's regime, and The Wagalla Massacre of 1984 (again during Moi's regime)
in which hundreds of Somali Kenyans were shot to death. Finally the
non-electoral extra judicial killings of the 500 young men last year should
also be investigated.

Progressives should also call for the crisis to be resolved within
democratic structures. When Bush won an election that the rest of the world
understood as rigged, we did not ask Al Gore to try and overthrow the
government through an Orange revolution, we did not ask him to divide the
country across racial lines, blacks pitted against whites, whites pitted
against Latinos; we asked him to find redress through peaceful and
democratic processes. And for that, the United States remains standing, in
spite of Bush. Al Gore did not ask for a recount of all the votes, or for a
re-election. But both Raila and Kibaki can form a united government; ask for
a recount, and even a re-election. Whatever process or option is used to
adjudicate this must be one that leaves Kenya standing for generations to
come.

My plea to you is this: Let us not find revolutionaries where there are
none. A whole nation, where ethnic cleansing has already started, is at
stake. International solidarity should be with the Kenyan people and not
with individual leaders. The best thing for Kenya right now is a return to a
non-violent path governed by principled democratic structures that will
outlive both Raila and Kibaki. It is this that will make possible a people
powered government through a democratic revolution.
