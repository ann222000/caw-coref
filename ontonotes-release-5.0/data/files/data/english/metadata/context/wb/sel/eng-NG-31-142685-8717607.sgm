Unlike the ilk of the fearful gringogirl, Tani Jantsang, Xeno
Chauvin and the rest of their various sock puppets, the Teamsters
have really done their homework.

Why do the Teamsters and all other unions want to engage, enroll,
and support the Mexicans?  Simple answer; because the Mexicans
will support them and unify labor! They will forge a formidable
labor force with baseball bats if necessary.

Unlike the fat, fear consumed, button pushing white Americans
who've gotten used to un-deserved prosperity, by robbing their own
kind, in a society who's culture of selfish self interest rules
supreme, and which they blindly promote, foster, and helped to
create, the Teamsters know that the Mexicans unify for the common
good of their kind instead. They consider the fate of their
grandchildren and their responsibility in that, and the price of
neglecting it. The Teamsters as well as any other labor unions
also know that this is the best way, as union officials with great
salaries and perks, that this is their best chance of survival in
keeping those into the very near future.

Mexicans will ultimately rescue American labor and this makes
unions and the labor movement strong once again, benefiting all
Americans.  Just think of all the groups who would benefit by
that, including hundreds of thousands of lawyers! All, Except
those freeloaders who are devoid of understanding or education,
such as gringogirl, Tani Jantsang, Xeno Chauvin and the rest of
their various fear-promoting-sock-puppets. These types, and their
families, will be excluded from the inevitable benefits, and how
well they know it! That un-confronted dim knowledge wispering from
a dark and neglected soul cements their fate and accelerates their
fear! They want your support in that. It being so that their
insidious deeds cannot but escape their own due wages. To whom is
this not obvious?

While the politicians want to placate businesses who currently
exploit Mexicans in their weakness, they too realize the eventual
strength and value that will be congealed by their attempted
manipulations, and all arising from fear. How shall they
compromise and manage their web of deciet?  Might they start in
promoting fear, hate, and confusion, like rulers have done
throughout the history of man? Are they posing as gringogirl and
her sock puppets on a world wide stage of opinion as low paid
disinformation specialists with these agendas?

So Mexican scabs first help to destroy the unions and now they propose
to build them back up with themselves in charge.  The rank and file
will never trust them; once a scab, always a scab.

And, you should ask Cesar Chavez' United Farm Workers what they think
about the teamsters and Mexicans working together.  Chavez absolutely
hated the teamsters, and with good reason at the time.

Since you discovered the truth, I might as well tell you, that all the

What you really want is for the white workforce to be replaced by
Mexicans.  I notice you are only concerned with white people being
replaced by Mexicans.

That makes you black or Mexican.  I say you are black.

You are right, except that you don't go back far enough, up until

it all worked just like it was supposed to! Gov'ment by the

He used he used a provisional presidential power to order union
workers back to work, illegally. Over-riding the law that allowed
them to strike, and the very essence of what the freedom to choose
is. Then, on top of that, he told all American blue collar
workers, [only-not white collar workers or executives], who would
not take a 33% pay cut immediately, un-American, not a patriot.
While at the same time promising double returns if they agreed
willingly at contract time.  This double return, nor even pace
return never happened. 27 years later, blue collars in any trade,
skilled or not earn less than they earned then.  Unions took it in
the ass. The rank and file who still pay dues, in those jobs that
require it, do not trust them, and don't support them or any
member in trouble, to this day.

The obvious goal was to destroy unions, and in effect, as you've
pointed out...at that percentage, it has all been very effective.
So, the unions need fresh blood. Mexicans will give them this.

Deno, God Bless You!

I see you are incorrectly quoting history again. Which union strike
did Ronnie stop illegally? If it was the Air Traffic Controllers, they
took federal pledges not to strike. I know a pledge means nothing to
you, but real citizens take those seriously. In that pledge is what
empowered Ronnie to fire them that did not return to work.

If that isn't the one you are eluding to, please be more specific.
When you mention strikes you should say which one, otherwise it is a
generalized blanket statement.

Now, since you hate discussing days of old, what have unions done
lately for workers? What things do the unions do which have not been
passed into federal labor laws? I am not beating you down here, but
what have they done in the last ten years?

Here is a chance to change my mind on unions.

Again, God Bless You Deno.

Have you seen police in the U.S.A. kidnap young women for the
prostitution rackets they run?

Mexicans themselves (quietly and only to those they trust) describe
Mexico as a &quot;pigsty&quot; of oppression and corruption.

Mexico's unions are not unions. They are not independent of Mexican

Mexico take their orders from their government; and those orders are

not pretty---especially for the U.S.'s Afro-Americans.

&quot;Can't train them&quot; has been an on-going problem in Mexico for
generations.

But, I'm sure, there will be thousands of more issues of comic-book
style instruction manuals printed and published in Mexico (for U.S.
distribution) on the American tax-payers dime to pursue the utter
futility it has always proven to have been.

(At the last symposium on immigration (at Emory University) I
attended, a Latina so-called &quot;Professor&quot; [of &quot;Latina Women Studies&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do the Teamsters and all other unions want to engage, enroll, and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which they blindly promote, foster, and helped to create,
&gt;&gt;&gt; That is a perfect description of Mexico.

&gt;&gt; not take a 33% pay cut immediately, un-American, not a patriot.
&gt;&gt; While at the same time promising double returns if they agreed

&gt;&gt; require it, do not trust them, and don't support them or any

&gt;&gt; I see you are incorrectly quoting history again. Which union strike
&gt;&gt; did Ronnie stop illegally? If it was the Air Traffic Controllers, they
&gt;&gt; took federal pledges not to strike.

&gt;Cites please.

&gt;I know a pledge means nothing to
&gt;&gt; you,

&gt;Of course you do.

&gt;but real citizens take those seriously.

&gt;Yeah, I know there weren't any real citizens in the majority of
&gt;air traffic controllers.

&gt;In that pledge is what
&gt;&gt; empowered Ronnie to fire them that did not return to work.

&gt;Wrong.

Still more BS from the criminal apologist. There was a no strike
clause in the contract that the ATC people signed. They broke that
contract, and Reagan was completely within his rights to fire every
striker.

&gt;Nothing that they are not compelled to do, and that's not much.

&gt;What things do the unions do which have not been

&gt;Huh?

&gt;I am not beating you down here, but

&gt;Lose membership? Facilitate the moving of business out of the

&gt;&gt; Here is a chance to change my mind on unions.

&gt;If you were ever a union member, I suppose you might have a right

&gt;&gt;&gt; brute strength too. Sometimes, to be honest, quality of work suffers,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but that is because quality doesn't matter to the white task masters who
&gt;&gt;&gt; hire them but don't, or can't train them.

&gt;&gt; You really are a racist POS aren't you? A brown supremacist. A
&gt;&gt; brown nazi. There are plenty of Mexican gangsters who don't
&gt;&gt; work anything except drugs, prostitution and welfare scams.

&gt;&gt; Gee, I used to work w/a Mexican guy (an engineer), I ALWAYS
&gt;&gt; went home an hour or two later than he did. Of course, he had
&gt;&gt; kids and a family.

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, he screwed up once and was fired (which I think
&gt;&gt; was unfair,

&gt; And he didn't sue for discrimination?

&gt; but not racist).

&gt; Huh? lol, you be sure and emphasize you aren't a racist, just a stupid

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mexicans will ultimately rescue American labor and this makes

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I see you are incorrectly quoting history again. Which union strike
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did Ronnie stop illegally? If it was the Air Traffic Controllers, they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; took federal pledges not to strike.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cites please.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know a pledge means nothing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course you do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but real citizens take those seriously.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know there weren't any real citizens in the majority of
&gt;&gt;&gt; air traffic controllers.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In that pledge is what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; empowered Ronnie to fire them that did not return to work.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong.

&gt;&gt; Still more BS from the criminal apologist. There was a no strike
&gt;&gt; clause in the contract that the ATC people signed. They broke that
&gt;&gt; contract, and Reagan was completely within his rights to fire every
&gt;&gt; striker.

&gt;Cites please!  Oh...thats right, you can't!  bwweeeehahahahhaha!

Just paste the following string in Google, and you will find an
abundance of cites: ATC &quot;no strike clause&quot;. I assume that even a
lard-assed moron like yourself can manage to do that if someone else
does the thinking for you.

The ATC was just like many other federal or emergency agency, such as
a police department. Their contracts had a &quot;no strike&quot; clause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is a chance to change my mind on unions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you were ever a union member, I suppose you might have a right

&gt; and illegal intoxicants, then slammed into a parked car,

That was a criminal policeman. Quite out of the norm in the U.S.

Not so in Mexico where kidnapping, rape and forced prostitution by
Mexico's so-called police is 'institutionalized.'

The kidnapped woman are brought to jails no more than a block away
from the police stations. Oftentimes across the street.

The police then pimp them to those willing to visit the women in their
jail cells. The least recalcitrant are paroled to both &quot;Day&quot; and
&quot;Night&quot; Clubs plus the more usual whorehouses where they continue to
ply the trade under the control of Mexico's police.

There have been some 400 to 1400 women who have disappeared in Nuevo
Laredo alone. The Mexican Government claims it cannot find a &quot;serial
killer.&quot;

They would not be investigating their own police for the kidnapping
and murder of those women for the very real possibility of their being
victimized for their Mexican IDs to be then transferred to Central
American Women kidnapped while in transit to the U.S. where similar
businesses are already functioning within the jurisdictions of Mexican
police (as dual-citizens) in the States as U.S. policemen.

&gt; &gt;&gt; He used he used a provisional presidential power to order union
&gt; &gt;&gt; workers back to work, illegally. Over-riding the law that allowed
&gt; &gt;&gt; them to strike, and the very essence of what the freedom to choose
&gt; &gt;&gt; is. Then, on top of that, he told all American blue collar
&gt; &gt;&gt; workers, [only-not white collar workers or executives], who would
&gt; &gt;&gt; not take a 33% pay cut immediately, un-American, not a patriot.
&gt; &gt;&gt; While at the same time promising double returns if they agreed

&gt; &gt;&gt; return never happened. 27 years later, blue collars in any trade,

&gt; &gt;&gt; require it, do not trust them, and don't support them or any
&gt; &gt;&gt; member in trouble, to this day.

&gt; &gt; He also agreed with Mexico's then president Miguel de la Madrid, for
&gt; &gt; the U.S.A. to absorb, as cheap labor, Mexico's grossly surplus
