Don't know if it'll be that high, but as they've shown in the past,
they'll take any chance at all to gouge.

Cato had some interesting commentary recently on how price gouging
actually helps the consumer in the long run....

&quot;Gougers are sending an important signal to market actors that something
is scarce and that profits are available to those who produce or sell
that something. Gouging thus sets off an economic chain reaction that
ultimately remedies the shortages that led to the gouging in the first
place.&quot;

&quot;There's a catch, however. If the government artificially restricts
supply, those price signals will fall on deaf ears.&quot;

Lee R Raymond is the CEO of Exxon-Mobil, the biggest price gouger among
the oil companies.

Perhaps you would like to send him a letter, but know writing to
Exxon's corporate offices will never reach him.

So - how about sending him a letter at his home. I live in Dallas,
the same city as Mr. Raymond, and it was a simple matter to find where
he lives - and a lot more - all information is a matter of public
record.

To get to Mr Raymond, write

Lee R Raymond
4642 Meadowood Rd
Dallas TX 75220-2015

According to the Dallas County Appraisal District, here are some
interesting facts about Mr. Raymond's residence.

His home is a 1 ½ story frame home, built on a slab, which sets on
2.894 acres of land (valued at $800,000 per acre) making the value of
his lot $2,315,200.00. The home is valued at $1,393,200 for a total
taxable value of $3,708,400.00.

The home consists of 8,642 square feet living area and has 5 bedrooms,
5 full bathrooms and 1 half bathroom. It also has 6 fire places, a
swimming pool, 1 wet bar and is surrounded by a wrought iron fence.

Needless to say, Mr. Raymond must gouge his gas prices to support this
mansion.

All above information can be verified at the Dallas County Appraisal
District website  http://www.dallascad.org/

Select the search appraisals options then search by his address

"/> Yep.

It may take six months of gouging to really convince people to no longer
allow interference in creating sufficient backups should something like
this happen again in the future and prevent gouging.

It may take six months of gouging to really convince people to dump
their fuel inefficient vehicles for efficient ones.

It may take six months of gouging to ...

It may take six months of gouging to ...

etc.

Six months of gouging could be long enough to create a huge boon to the
consumer in the long term regardless of the short term pain.

Perhaps if the case of gas gets high enough, more people will drive
environmentally friendly vehicles such as the Toyota Prius. Once gas
gets beyond $5.50 per gallon, the cost of buying a hybrid should become
justifiable, so high gas prices are a good thing for the environment.

"/> Minneapolis. Gas peaked at $2.99 a gallon, with some rouge
stations posting prices up to $3.25. Most of those above $3
prices didn't last more than a few hours since the spot price
of crude dropped right after the shortage rumors got started.
Today, pretty much every station in the metro area is $2.79,
with diesel floating between $2.71 and $2.79. In fact, it is
kind of odd that almost every station is $2.79--I have never
seen the prices so uniform before.
