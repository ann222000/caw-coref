=========================================================

A ceremony to support National Convention and State Constitution
organized by the community elders of Kayin State was grandly held in
accord with the law at the Thiri Ground in Pa-an at 7:40 a.m. on 9th
October 2007.

It was attended by the people of all walks of life totaling over
60,000.

Before the ceremony, (4) columns comprises with Pa-an, KawtKaReik,
ZweGaBin and Myawaddy Districts marched into the Thiri Ground
systematically and took respective places.

Townselder U Saw Nyunt Thaung from Pa-an Towship presided over the
ceremony.

First, those present at the ceremony saluted the Union flag.

After that, Chairman U Saw Nyunt Thaung delivered a speech saying
that, at a time when majority of the people are supporting the
National Convention and the forthcoming State Constitution, some
foreign media are sowing discord among the Government and the people
in our country broadcasting skyful of lies. The Government is like our
parents. Every parents have desire for the sufficiency of food,
clothing and shelter needs, prosperity and peace in the family. Only
when the children are happy, will the parents be in pleasure. Family
members should live in amity and happiness. It is important for the
people not to be bought by the slickers, who are killers in the air
waves. He also urged those present to expose a fistful of internal
destructionists. Those present are strength of the nation and kin
siblings who are striving for the development of our nation.

The traitors and colonialists are now in frenzy. As they are about to
lose everything, their acts are unruly like aggrieved persons out for
revenge. Receiving dollars scantily from the colonialists, they are
now becoming puppets who have to dance to their tune. Now, strings of
the puppets are tangled.

Next, Executive Committee member of Kayin State Union Solidarity and
Development Association U Saw Htoo Ka Paw tabled a motion saying that
15 chapters, from principles for the State to General Prescription,
have been laid down at the already completed National Convention. The
basic principles and detailed basic principles have been thoroughly
discussed and laid down.

Every nation has internal antagonism. The present Tatmadaw Government
extinguished the conflicts or fire that could not be extinguished at
the time of previous Governments. It is seen that 17 national armed
groups and 18 small groups who opposed the Governments in successive
eras, have returned to the legal fold. National consolidation is vital
for the State. Thus, all citizens must preserve the national
consolidation from generation to generation.

In conclusion, he supported the basic principles and detailed basic
principles laid down by the National Convention for emergence of the
State Constitution which will materialize the Three Main National
Causes and warmly welcomed the State Constitution.

Then, a member of Kayin State Women's Affairs Committee and Principal
of the Pa-an Computer University Dr. Daw Thin Thin Htike seconded the
motion saying that the National Convention laid down basic principles
and detailed basic principles in which the State shall not
discriminate against or in favour of any citizen based on race, birth,
religion, official position, status, culture, sex and wealth comprise
in chapter 8, volume 4 and however, noting in this section shall
prevent appointment of men to the positions that are naturally
suitable for men only consist in chapter 8, volume 6. Those principles
reflect the cultural characteristics of the Myanmar where men and
women have equal rights and there is no discrimination between them.

She continued to say that this is a time to give lesson to the
internal traitors who do not want to contribute towards the nation's
building endeavours, who want to handover the nation to others with
pessimists' view on national development tasks, who want to impress
upon foreigners and who want to be the slave.

Later, a member of Kayin State Maternal and Child Welfare Association
and Head of English Department of Pa-an University Daw Myint Myint San
also seconded the motion saying that as the Chairman had said, the
Government has already adore the nationals as its offsprings. As it
looks like parents, the government loves its people. Parents always
want to see the success, wealth and prosperity of their sons and
daughters. The situation now is that, acts of colonialists who are
pretending like step-fathers and saviours are persuading the young
generation in order to rely on them, oppose and make angry the
parents, destroy the own resident and family enjoyment by using
incentives really like that of Daewadat, the apostate monk who defied
Gautama Buddha.

Neo-colonialists joining hands with communists instigated innocent
people to insult the goodwill of parents and teachers. Their wrong and
lopsided thoughts may cheat the uneducated and people who have poor
knowledge but not the intelligent public.

Afterwards, a member of Kayin State War Veterans Organization U Saw Ka
Paw Htoo supported the motion saying that in the past, some region of
Kayin State were covered with gun smoke and sounds of clash due to the
discord sowed by the colonialists. But, now all of the national
brethren, after realizing the discord sowed by the neo-colonialists
are living peacefully under the guidance of the State.

Then, Pado Lar Ba of Developed Kayin Buddhist Association seconded the
motion saying that basic principles and detailed basic principles laid
down by the National Convention are drawn in accord with the wishes of
all organizations, all strata of life and all national races.

So, we don't need to take care of those stooges and foreign countries
that worried the emergence of the State Constitution.

They didn't pay a helping hand while convening the National Convention
but destructive acts.

And now, the National Convention had been concluded successfully and
the plots of the traitors had been destroyed.

Our nation fell into servitude for the lack of unity, and the
independence had been gained by sacrificing many live, sweat and
blood.

If our independence were lost because of those handfuls of traitors,
our history would become ugly.

That's why, it is the duty of all citizens for our country standing
tall among the world as a peaceful, modern, developed and discipline
flourishing democratic nation.

After that, Pado Aung Hsan of Phaya Gone Peace Group also seconded the
motion saying that like other national brethren in different States
and Divisions, people in Kayin State favour peace and development. At
present, as many roads and bridges and Universities have been emerged
in Kayin State, smooth transportation is ensured, and the number of
intellectuals and intelligentsia increase due to achieving learning
opportunities in the region.

We, Pha Ya Gone peace group, Haungthayaw Peace group, DKBA, Than Daung
Peace group and KNU/KNLA Peace Council are now enjoying the taste of
peace offered by the State.

In conclusion, the National Convention has been successfully completed
for emergence of genuine and discipline flourishing democratic nation.
According to the basic principles and detailed basic principles laid
down by the National Convention, the State Constitution, which is
essential for the State, can perpetually guarantee the safety for all
national races. That's why, we warmly support the National Convention
and the State Constitution.

After that, the Chairman sought approval from the mass. With the
unanimous approval, the Chairman passed the resolution of supporting
the National Convention and the forthcoming State Constitution.

The ceremony was successfully concluded with chanting of slogans.

Simple ...obvious to see why these people come and attend... You SPDC
thugs forced them at gunpoint. You tell them &quot;Warning you.. DO NOT
COME.... You see the consequence......

Who are these useless hanks of bone and fat that call themselves
Government of Burma(Myanmar)? A handful number of thugs of the SPDC
(State Peace and Development Council) calls themselves Government, but
I seriously doubt it. Â The ruling class is evil just because they look
out for themselves. However, I would say that the self-interest of a
few individuals has less value for the totality of our society.
Naturally, the ruling classs would dispute this -saying that they are
the parents and they are serving the interests of the Burmese people,
providing leadership to the masses. What kind of leadership can Than
Shwe's SPDC provide for people? Â People of Burma have seen clearly
that with Than Shwe and his company in command, there is no hope.
Weeks after extreme brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protest, the
SPDC started , as usual, putting as much effort into torturing
dissidents and jailing and murdering people/monks. Instead, it should
start walking to the negotiating table with the opposition party .
Since it sees no immediate danger, the SPDC chooses only one option -
send an army officer to talk with the NLD leader. Â &quot;With one stone,
kill two brids&quot; Â is a common Burmese saying. This talk is about the
public relations and telling other countries, near and far, that the
SPDC is talking and negotiating. However, look back at the experience
over the past five to six years with the SPDC; there was a talk with
the NLD leader, Aung San Suu Kyi and it was stopped by the same man,
Than Shwe. So the thug regime never was serious when it comes to
sharing power with Burmese people.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The SPDC said &quot; As it looks like parents, the government loves its people.&quot;
">

Yes, you really love, ha...ha...heeeeeeheeeeehee.. I know why you love
people. Nothing but you make enormous free flow of cash into your
pocket , by abusing Burma natural resources.. So you love it soo soo
much....... Â Admit, thug....One day you will..... No very soon..

Please be aware that the regime no longer makes as much effort to
disguise its hand in political manipulations. Their plan is straight
and simple - they want to prolong a policy of buying time for the
regime until it gets what it wants. This is the same game of buying
time by saying we're going to negotiate with opposition.
The fact that it is the SPDC regime that is conducting atrocities
against Burmese people. It has overseen the collapse of the economy
and created an environment where farmers grow rice and have no rice
even for own family after the cultivation season, many poor people in
town who Â  cannot afford to buy their normal dietary requirement of
rice for a day and have to drink rice water to survive, and where HIV/
AIDS claims lives a week due to lack of money to seek medical
assistance at hospitals. But, the SPDC members in the corridor of
power make quick and cool money at the gross expense of the people's
need. &quot;The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth.&quot; No need
to get Dr degree in any science; anyone can figure how rich the SPDC
senior thug is by seeing the video of his daughter's extravagant
wedding. It is an irony that Gen Than Shwe spent $300000 on his
daughter's wedding, but he did not even bother to see how the Burmese
people suffer under his regime. Â Even when someone points it out, he
used to dispute that this was caused by the traitors, colonialists,
and &quot;neo-colonialists joining hands with communists&quot;.

Yes... &quot;Neo-colonialists joining hands with communists&quot; , that is what
the SPDC's propaganda machine said. Who are dealing with COMMUNISTS at
this moment, the pro-democracy protesters or the SPDC thugs? Who let
COMMUNISTS use the land of Burma now? Anwer is in the mind of Burmese
people's eyes.

What Burmese people need are leaders who are really with and of their
people, who are actually doing the resisting on the ground, not the
gang of moral perverts bent on preserving their own power , their
business deals with China, who have lost all trace of decency or
credibility.
