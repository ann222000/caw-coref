Unfortunately Roberts Roberts the relativistic verbiage contains too
many oxymorons. As far as photons are concerned, the only important
question is:

Does the speed of photons vary with the gravitational potential, as
the speed of other particles does, and, equivalently, does the speed
of photons vary with the relative speed of the light source and the
observer, as the speed of other particles does?

Roberts Roberts this question is directly relevant to the axioms of
relativity and for that reason I called it &quot;the only important

directly relevant.

To your question whether the photon has mass

the answwer is Yes
it has mass  a verylittl eone

there is only jsy one kind of mass
you can choose any name for it
but jus tone knd of mass
(if you think about 'relatiovistic mass'
better forget about it
and
how come that the phton has mas
and still movwes at c

Rest mass should be  considered the fundamental mass. But binding
energy confuses this.
A proton or neutron outside the nucleus has more mass than inside. A
bound proton or neutron has less mass. So which mass is to be
considered fundamental? the mass inside or outside?
The mass of a bound nucleon or a free one?

Mass is not some immutable substance that we really need mythical

photons are released, and the resultant &quot;system that stays at

Actually it is commonly accepted in relativity that there are three kinds of
mass

(1) inertial gravitational mass = p/v
(2) passive gravitational mass - That mass which is attracted by
gravitational field

Rest mass has energy. But it is not always true that energy has rest mass. A

No, it doesn't. Binding energy is a completely different concept from
the rest masses of the constituents of a compound object.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No. Binding energy is necessarily negative, so the sum of the masses of
the nucleons that make up a given nucleus is larger than the mass of the
nucleus. The difference is the binding energy of the nucleus.

Binding energy is far more general a concept than just for nuclei....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The &quot;fundamental&quot; mass is necessarily the mass of whatever it is you are
talking about. If you are discussing a proton, then the mass of the
proton is &quot;fundamental&quot; for the proton, etc. This ought to be obvious.

Note: discussing the binding of nuclei is a complex task, because one
cannot in general simply remove one nucleon from a nucleus -- there are
usually more complex interactions involved (the daughter nucleus is
usually in an excited state). The binding of electrons in an atom can be
discussed more cleanly, as can the binding of most macroscopic systems.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rest mass should be  considered the fundamental mass. But binding

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A proton or neutron outside the nucleus has more mass than inside. A

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; considered fundamental? the mass inside or outside?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The mass of a bound nucleon or a free one?

&gt; &gt;&gt; A very good question.  That's the problem when mass and energy are so
&gt; &gt;&gt; closely related. I'm not sure what the 'correct' answer is there.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Probably
&gt; &gt;&gt; that both are the mass.  Mass can be 'converted' to energy.

NO .. the m in E=mc^2 is good old proper invarant rest mass.  And the E
there is the rest energy, so it _should_ be written E_0 = m_0.c^2 to be
unambiguous

There are a few things with units of mass, and a few things with the word
'mass' in their names.  But when you say 'mass' it means the invariant /
proper / rest mass, not the apparent / inertial / relativistic mass.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Rest energy .. yes

The total energy has the energy equivalent to the mass, combined with the
kinetic energy

E = sqrt((mc^2)^2+(pc)^2)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Rest mass should be  considered the fundamental
&gt;&gt; &gt; mass. But binding energy confuses this.

&gt;&gt; It is a label.  Do not spend a lot of time finding out how
&gt;&gt; many
&gt;&gt; nagels can dance on the head of that particular pin.

&gt;&gt; &gt; A proton or neutron outside the nucleus has more
&gt;&gt; &gt; mass than inside. A bound proton or neutron has
&gt;&gt; &gt; less mass.

&gt;&gt; No, the *system* has less mass.  The individual
&gt;&gt; components have  not fundamentally changed.

&gt; Define system.
">

In this context, the nucleus which loses mass.  Which obviously
is gained by &quot;the system&quot; of the Universe.  But the nucleons
themselves are unaffected.

Even an electron entering an orbital around a lone proton, forms
a system and the system has less mass than the sum of both
components.

Maxwell observed that a measurement
consisted of two parts,

a standard amount of a property,

and the number of standard units of the property
in the property being measured.

He further observed that three properties,
and thus three standard units,
could be used to define all of the other physical properties.

Maxwell selected mass, time, and
as space seemed to be a direction independent property
(isotropic ), he used &quot;del factor&quot;,
a three dimensional per unit distance differential operator,
as his third property.

In other words, Maxwell,
the father of Dimensional Analysis,
(The standard that ALL physics models MUST conform to.)
selected mass, time and distance
to be his pointers to the other physical properties.

In 1908, Hermann Minkowski integrated Maxwell's time and del factor
into what is now known as &quot;Minkowski space&quot;,
when he observed that times are time periods, and spaces are time intervals,
and both can be quantized in terms of the same standard clock.

At that point all of the physical properties
could be quantized in terms units of two standard properties,
mass and time.

No doubt, two other properties could have been
selected to serve as pointers to the other physical properties.
but it is easier and more precise to maintain
a mass and a time standard than it is to
maintain energy, pressure, momentum, voltage, current, etc.
standards.

The most stable and useable properties to use as standards
are oscillators and masses, that are as close to the observe
as possible, and in a neutral or stable environment.

It doesn't make a lot of sense to use properties
remote from the observer, and in varying and unstable
environments, including the environment of x,y, and z,
as one's standard units.

Rest masses are used as mass standards,
and rest time units (Oscillators)
SHOULD be used for time and space standards.

I might point out that times are basically time periods,
which are auto-correlations using one's standard clock,

and that spaces are basically time intervals,
which are cross-correlations using one's standard clock.

A suggestion: Getting into conversations where one person tells the other
that they are confused and the other responding by saying the other is
confused is an arguement with no ending. If you want to get more out of this
discussion I believe you will have to get past this or agree to disagree. Is
this subject something critical to the thread or is it an offshoot unrelated
to the original thread. If its the later then I recommend that you both
agree to disagree (while I'm sure you believe that the other is wrong) and
then get back to the main debate. In fact I believe it was Sam who was one
of the people that pointed out to me that this was what I was doing and it
was causing me problems. :)

Best regards to the both of you

&gt; &gt; &gt; The first word of &quot;relativistic mass&quot; is an oxymoron.

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately Roberts Roberts the relativistic verbiage contains too
&gt; &gt; many oxymorons. As far as photons are concerned, the only important
&gt; &gt; question is:

&gt; &gt; Does the speed of photons vary with the gravitational potential, as
&gt; &gt; the speed of other particles does, and, equivalently, does the speed
&gt; &gt; of photons vary with the relative speed of the light source and the
&gt; &gt; observer, as the speed of other particles does?

&gt; &gt; Roberts Roberts this question is directly relevant to the axioms of
&gt; &gt; relativity and for that reason I called it &quot;the only important
&gt; &gt; question&quot;. The question &quot;Do photons have mass?&quot; is important but not
&gt; &gt; directly relevant.

&gt; &gt; Roberts Roberts you have already given half of the answer:

&gt; To your question whether the photon has mass

&gt; the answwer is Yes
&gt; it has mass  a verylittl eone

&gt; there is only jsy one kind of mass
&gt; you can choose any name for it
&gt; but jus tone knd of mass

I don't agree.

A water wave can hit a wall, with force.
That doesn't mean it has intrinsic mass.

Keeping in mind that a photon is just a wave packet. It is not a
particle of dust.

And I gave the example yesterday if you missed it, that if an observer
has a switch, and as a high speed rocket passes him, he flips the
switch. The rocket is going 1 million miles per hour towards the moon,
and the observer is stationary.
When he flips the switch, his high beam beside him and the one on the
ship will shine a beam onto a detector on the moon.

If light had mass, it would have momentum, and his beam would strike
the moon first.
Since it does not have mass, it has no forward momentum towards the
moon, and hence both beams hit the moon at the same time.

Intrinsic mass would be in a nucleus, it is expanding along with the
universe. But in it and all around it, is the quantum foam, which is
also expanding, and so there is a certain amount of pressure that
resists that expansion. That bubble becomes like a gyroscope in a way,
that it is relative to the quantum foam. (Newton's Bucket, Einstein-
Bose condensate vortices) so it reacts with the quantum foam, and that
individuality of the nucleus, and its trying to expand in absolute
space-time, gives it mass.
When you move an atom or group of atoms through space-time, they have
to plow through the quantum foam, and as a result, it presses you into
your seat.
Step on the gas feel the pressure opposing you as you plow through it.
Now you can say well even a transverse light wave will expand as it
travels towards the target, but that expansion of that wave is
relative to the rest of the surroundings which are also expanding, and
so that pressure of it getting larger is not even noticeable.
I don't think it would be because it does not contain anything in it.
A nucleus has quantum foam in it. A transverse wave is just a wave in
the quantum foam.
Its the skin of the nucleus, that elasticity, that gives the interior
of the nucleus a different pressure than the exterior background.
If you make Einstein Bose condensate, and keep going cooling it
further, it will flat line, and that quantum foam inside will go back
to the background, but when it does that, it creates a small explosion
from a small temporary vacuum.
It implodes, some of it will flat line and as the rest of the
condensate comes together to fill that void (implosion) then impacts
itself from the force of the surrounding pressure, and recoils
(explodes).

So only the nucleus of an atom, has intrinsic mass.

If you say well at the shell radius, there is a spherical wave of dark
energy (black body radiation, and they have levitated frogs on a
magnetic field as simple proof of this) that is like mass, and I think
that is just a semantical argument, and the mass it has, is not its
own, but it is merely tossing the mass of the quantum foam around.
The individual quantum foam bubbles also having mass.
And if you were to flatten one of those, then what happens is similar
to the Bosenova (mentioned above implosion explosion)
except that now you have created a perfect vacuum, a wormhole, and the
surrounding pressure is greater, and the quantum foam comes together
to fill that gap.

And if enough of the quantum foam gets flattened, it looks like
this...

So what is this skin of the nucleus?
Well foam is in a liquid, and as far as we can tell it is a liquid.
And that is why, when it flat-lines, and the nucleus bubble collapses
in super-cooled Bose-Einstein condensate, you can actually detect that
momentum, of the slap, of the liquid, as the bubble collapses and the
liquid slaps on the surrounding surfaces of the foam.
And also the reason we think it is a fluid, is because all motion,
through the quantum foam is fluid motion.

Only flying saucers apparently can make 90 degree turns at high speed.
Other things with mass, cannot do that.
And since that is in the realm of the unproven, it might be because
the laws of physics state, that anything with mass, in this physical
universe, has to plow through the quantum foam. There is no way around
that.
You cannot mass cancel nothing.
Nada.
No way José Rodriguez.
So the only explanation then for any of those sightings or stories, is
that one, they are made up, some of them, and two, if there was
anything like that seen, it was not made of atoms that had mass, but
must have been made of light as in an illusion, or a mirage, or a
projection of some kind.
Unless you can somehow create a beam or a force field that can somehow
move the quantum foam around without resistance, but there is no
examples of that happening anywhere in the universe, and always, if
you try to move the foam around it will just lock up and explode.
If you move it too quickly.
Like if you are in a spaceship traveling close to c, the second you
hit c, it becomes a supersolid mass.
Travel at a constant speed, and it is slipping past you with uniform
motion as a superfluid and no problem, but accelerate, and suddenly
your dark energy waves are pushing against each other (the wave front
in front of it) and then against the foam, and then it will squish in
itself, the foam and its its own little bubbles will get squashed a
bit, and when you accelerate at c, one wall of the bubble hits the
opposite side as it is squished in completely and well you stop dead
in your tracks as it locks up in that area.

If you had sufficient force to just blow through that, you would get a
supernova explosion.

A nuclear explosion is when the nucleus pressure is overcome, and a
supernova when you overcome the pressure of the quantum foam.
Its like a Doppler effect.
Just like going through the sound barrier, then the light barrier and
then the quantum barrier.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rest mass?  Rest wrt what?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The underlying concept is of invariant mass. This is an intrinsic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; property of an object, and in relativity is the closest analog of what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;mass&quot; meant in Newtonian mechanics.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The phrase &quot;rest mass&quot; hearkens back to the old days in which there was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confusion between mass (aka invariant mass) and &quot;relativistic mass&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Relativistic mass&quot; is not really mass, and is frame dependent so it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not intrinsic to an object, either; it is numerically equal to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy of the object, and &quot;energy&quot; is a much better name for this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quantity than &quot;relativistic mass&quot;. The &quot;relativistic mass&quot; of an object
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in its rest frame is equal to its invariant mass, or in the usual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shortcut way of speaking, its rest mass.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So this is &quot;rest relative to the object itself&quot;. In modern physics, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first word of &quot;invariant mass&quot;, and the first word of &quot;rest mass&quot;, are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; redundant, because the concept &quot;mass&quot; includes those aspects as well.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The first word of &quot;relativistic mass&quot; is an oxymoron.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tom Roberts

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately Roberts Roberts the relativistic verbiage contains too
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many oxymorons. As far as photons are concerned, the only important
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question is:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does the speed of photons vary with the gravitational potential, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the speed of other particles does, and, equivalently, does the speed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of photons vary with the relative speed of the light source and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observer, as the speed of other particles does?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Roberts Roberts this question is directly relevant to the axioms of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relativity and for that reason I called it &quot;the only important
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question&quot;. The question &quot;Do photons have mass?&quot; is important but not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directly relevant.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Roberts Roberts you have already given half of the answer:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also be less than &quot;300000 km/s&quot; (by which I assume you really mean the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the answwer is Yes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it has mass  a verylittl eone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is only jsy one kind of mass
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you can choose any name for it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but jus tone knd of mass
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (if you think about 'relatiovistic mass'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better forget about it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how come that the phton has mas
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and still movwes at c
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ask Wormley  he is a cleaver innovative sciensut

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He is the new Einstien
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the 21 century
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (and may be of Alaska (University )as well !!who knowes ??

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Y.Porat
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't agree.

&gt; &gt; &gt; A water wave can hit a wall, with force.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That doesn't mean it has intrinsic mass.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Keeping in mind that a photon is just a wave packet. It is not a
&gt; &gt; &gt; particle of dust.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And I gave the example yesterday if you missed it, that if an observer
&gt; &gt; &gt; has a switch, and as a high speed rocket passes him, he flips the
&gt; &gt; &gt; switch. The rocket is going 1 million miles per hour towards the moon,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the observer is stationary.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  When he flips the switch, his high beam beside him and the one on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ship will shine a beam onto a detector on the moon.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If light had mass, it would have momentum, and his beam would strike
&gt; &gt; &gt; the moon first.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since it does not have mass, it has no forward momentum towards the
&gt; &gt; &gt; moon, and hence both beams hit the moon at the same time.

&gt; &gt; Intrinsic mass would be in a nucleus, it is expanding along with the
&gt; &gt; universe. But in it and all around it, is the quantum foam, which is
&gt; &gt; also expanding, and so there is a certain amount of pressure that
&gt; &gt; resists that expansion. That bubble becomes like a gyroscope in a way,
&gt; &gt; that it is relative to the quantum foam. (Newton's Bucket, Einstein-
&gt; &gt; Bose condensate vortices) so it reacts with the quantum foam, and that
&gt; &gt; individuality of the nucleus, and its trying to expand in absolute
&gt; &gt; space-time, gives it mass.
&gt; &gt; When you move an atom or group of atoms through space-time, they have
&gt; &gt; to plow through the quantum foam, and as a result, it presses you into
&gt; &gt; your seat.
&gt; &gt; Step on the gas feel the pressure opposing you as you plow through it.
&gt; &gt; Now you can say well even a transverse light wave will expand as it
&gt; &gt; travels towards the target, but that expansion of that wave is
&gt; &gt; relative to the rest of the surroundings which are also expanding, and
&gt; &gt; so that pressure of it getting larger is not even noticeable.
&gt; &gt; I don't think it would be because it does not contain anything in it.
&gt; &gt; A nucleus has quantum foam in it. A transverse wave is just a wave in
&gt; &gt; the quantum foam.
&gt; &gt; Its the skin of the nucleus, that elasticity, that gives the interior
&gt; &gt; of the nucleus a different pressure than the exterior background.
&gt; &gt; If you make Einstein Bose condensate, and keep going cooling it
&gt; &gt; further, it will flat line, and that quantum foam inside will go back
&gt; &gt; to the background, but when it does that, it creates a small explosion
&gt; &gt; from a small temporary vacuum.
&gt; &gt; It implodes, some of it will flat line and as the rest of the
&gt; &gt; condensate comes together to fill that void (implosion) then impacts
&gt; &gt; itself from the force of the surrounding pressure, and recoils
&gt; &gt; (explodes).

&gt; &gt; So only the nucleus of an atom, has intrinsic mass.

&gt; &gt; If you say well at the shell radius, there is a spherical wave of dark
&gt; &gt; energy (black body radiation, and they have levitated frogs on a
&gt; &gt; magnetic field as simple proof of this) that is like mass, and I think
&gt; &gt; that is just a semantical argument, and the mass it has, is not its
&gt; &gt; own, but it is merely tossing the mass of the quantum foam around.
&gt; &gt; The individual quantum foam bubbles also having mass.
&gt; &gt; And if you were to flatten one of those, then what happens is similar
&gt; &gt; to the Bosenova (mentioned above implosion explosion)
&gt; &gt; except that now you have created a perfect vacuum, a wormhole, and the
&gt; &gt; surrounding pressure is greater, and the quantum foam comes together
&gt; &gt; to fill that gap.

&gt; &gt; And if enough of the quantum foam gets flattened, it looks like
&gt; &gt; this... http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/big_explosion_050105.html

&gt; So what is this skin of the nucleus?
&gt; Well foam is in a liquid, and as far as we can tell it is a liquid.
&gt; And that is why, when it flat-lines, and the nucleus bubble collapses
&gt; in super-cooled Bose-Einstein condensate, you can actually detect that
&gt; momentum, of the slap, of the liquid, as the bubble collapses and the
&gt; liquid slaps on the surrounding surfaces of the foam.
&gt; And also the reason we think it is a fluid, is because all motion,
&gt; through the quantum foam is fluid motion.

&gt; Only flying saucers apparently can make 90 degree turns at high speed.
&gt; Other things with mass, cannot do that.
&gt; And since that is in the realm of the unproven, it might be because
&gt; the laws of physics state, that anything with mass, in this physical
&gt; universe, has to plow through the quantum foam. There is no way around
&gt; that.

&gt; &gt; Its like a Doppler effect.
&gt; &gt; Just like going through the sound barrier, then the light barrier and
&gt; &gt; then the quantum barrier.

&gt; That much we know. But the rest is still a mystery as to what is
&gt; inside the nucleus, inside the quantum foam?
&gt; It acts like air, and the foam acts like air bubbles in a superfluid,
&gt; but it can't be air can it?
&gt; And the size of one bubble is Plank Length.
&gt; And that is the smallest discreet anything we know of.
&gt; When its not that size, it doesn't exist.
&gt; Well we can't detect it, we say it is not in the real universe.
&gt; Is it possible that the bubbles are not uniform in size at Plank
&gt; Length?
&gt; Well we only have data to show they are that size.
&gt; And for instance the size of a nucleus of one element will be the same
&gt; here as on Alpha Centauri.
&gt; But getting back to mass, and particle physicists like particles to be
&gt; little things, not wave packets, and so they will say that these
&gt; things have mass, when in fact it is not their mass, but rather
&gt; borrowed mass, just as a water wave slaps a wall, that mass belongs to
&gt; the water molecules, not the wave.
&gt; And win the two slit experiment,
&gt; make a kids pool, place bowling pins on Styrofoam blocks, now generate
&gt; lots of waves in the pool, and when one pin falls over, say look,
&gt; there is an electron.
&gt; Yes it will fringe if the waves are coming from one direction the
&gt; principle is the same.
&gt; Send waves through a cathode ray tube, and when the right level of
&gt; energy hits the screen, a photon will be released.
&gt; Photons are released by a certain level of energy equal to one
&gt; electron.
&gt; Wave particle duality.
&gt; So where is the mass?
&gt; Does the wave toppling that bowling pin, have its own mass?
&gt; It is using the mass of the water molecules.
&gt; So in reality, the only things with rest mass, are the nulceus of any
&gt; atom, and the quantum foam itself.
&gt; And where it comes from, is the skin on those bubbles.
&gt; The big suck as the universe expands into the void. The skin on those
&gt; bubbles resists that expansion.
&gt; And notice how it is working.
&gt; Form one point in space-time outward.
&gt; Which is how mass works.
&gt; That is why it works.
&gt; Because it is an outward motion. Not a lateral motion.
&gt; That outward motion resists lateral movement.
&gt; It is already moving outward and with force and resisting that force.
&gt; Its like a gyroscopic effect.
&gt; But not from the spinning, but because it wants to stay put right
&gt; where it is and expand.
&gt; That would be the path of least resistance.
">

In actuality, a photon is not released. It is created.
When you get sufficient energy, of wave reactions, spherical dark
energy waves that permeate space and are created by the nucleus bubble
trying to expand.
It sends out spherical waves of dark energy in the quantum foam.
EM waves. Traveling at c, cresting at the shell radius.
And when those waves combine and interact, adding up and canceling out
they create the covalent bond of atoms, but when you get a certain
level of energy, and waves interact, they will create a transverse
wave. It will shoot out sideways, and you can even see it, and you can
call that a photon, at least one wave of that stretch of waves, you
can call a photon, and when it hits your eye, guess what? It has
sufficient force, to register in your brain as visible light.
If it didn't, it wouldn't be a visible photon it would be just another
level of em wave radiation in the spectrum.
There are waves hitting your eyes right now that you can't see.
Ultraviolet and all manner of waves.
But the screen of your detector is set up, so that a certain value of
energy wave will create that transverse wave, and it will hit your
eye, and you will say, look, there is an electron, that just hit the
detector, and released a photon, as if it had a whole bunch of them in
its pocket and let one go or something.

&gt; &gt; there is an electron.
&gt; &gt; Yes it will fringe if the waves are coming from one direction the
&gt; &gt; principle is the same.
&gt; &gt; Send waves through a cathode ray tube, and when the right level of
&gt; &gt; energy hits the screen, a photon will be released.
&gt; &gt; Photons are released by a certain level of energy equal to one
&gt; &gt; electron.
&gt; &gt; Wave particle duality.
&gt; &gt; So where is the mass?
&gt; &gt; Does the wave toppling that bowling pin, have its own mass?
&gt; &gt; It is using the mass of the water molecules.
&gt; &gt; So in reality, the only things with rest mass, are the nulceus of any
&gt; &gt; atom, and the quantum foam itself.
&gt; &gt; And where it comes from, is the skin on those bubbles.
&gt; &gt; The big suck as the universe expands into the void. The skin on those

&gt; &gt; And notice how it is working.
&gt; &gt; Form one point in space-time outward.
&gt; &gt; Which is how mass works.
&gt; &gt; That is why it works.
&gt; &gt; Because it is an outward motion. Not a lateral motion.
&gt; &gt; That outward motion resists lateral movement.
&gt; &gt; It is already moving outward and with force and resisting that force.
&gt; &gt; Its like a gyroscopic effect.
&gt; &gt; But not from the spinning, but because it wants to stay put right
&gt; &gt; where it is and expand.
&gt; &gt; That would be the path of least resistance.

&gt; In actuality, a photon is not released. It is created.
&gt; When you get sufficient energy, of wave reactions, spherical dark
&gt; energy waves that permeate space and are created by the nucleus bubble
&gt; trying to expand.
&gt; It sends out spherical waves of dark energy in the quantum foam.
&gt; EM waves. Traveling at c, cresting at the shell radius.
&gt; And when those waves combine and interact, adding up and canceling out
&gt; they create the covalent bond of atoms, but when you get a certain
&gt; level of energy, and waves interact, they will create a transverse
&gt; wave. It will shoot out sideways, and you can even see it, and you can
&gt; call that a photon, at least one wave of that stretch of waves, you
&gt; can call a photon, and when it hits your eye, guess what? It has
&gt; sufficient force, to register in your brain as visible light.
&gt; If it didn't, it wouldn't be a visible photon it would be just another
&gt; level of em wave radiation in the spectrum.
&gt; There are waves hitting your eyes right now that you can't see.
&gt; Ultraviolet and all manner of waves.
&gt; But the screen of your detector is set up, so that a certain value of
&gt; energy wave will create that transverse wave, and it will hit your
&gt; eye, and you will say, look, there is an electron, that just hit the
&gt; detector, and released a photon, as if it had a whole bunch of them in
&gt; its pocket and let one go or something.

So here is an experiment you can do...
take a laser pointer and point it at a chalkboard and wiggle it like
mad.
No resistance to your movement.
Now take a pointing stick and wave it like mad.
Fell the momentum in the stick resisting movement.
Light has no mass, the atoms in the stick have mass.
Hook it up to a machine.
A wiggle machine.
The light will end up looking like it is covering an area, and still
no resistance.
The stick will snap from the pressure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what is this skin of the nucleus?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well foam is in a liquid, and as far as we can tell it is a liquid.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that is why, when it flat-lines, and the nucleus bubble collapses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in super-cooled Bose-Einstein condensate, you can actually detect that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; momentum, of the slap, of the liquid, as the bubble collapses and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liquid slaps on the surrounding surfaces of the foam.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And also the reason we think it is a fluid, is because all motion,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the quantum foam is fluid motion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only flying saucers apparently can make 90 degree turns at high speed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other things with mass, cannot do that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And since that is in the realm of the unproven, it might be because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the laws of physics state, that anything with mass, in this physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe, has to plow through the quantum foam. There is no way around
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot mass cancel nothing.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nada.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No way José Rodriguez.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the only explanation then for any of those sightings or stories, is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one, they are made up, some of them, and two, if there was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything like that seen, it was not made of atoms that had mass, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; must have been made of light as in an illusion, or a mirage, or a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; projection of some kind.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless you can somehow create a beam or a force field that can somehow
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move the quantum foam around without resistance, but there is no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; examples of that happening anywhere in the universe, and always, if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you try to move the foam around it will just lock up and explode.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you move it too quickly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like if you are in a spaceship traveling close to c, the second you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hit c, it becomes a supersolid mass.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Travel at a constant speed, and it is slipping past you with uniform
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motion as a superfluid and no problem, but accelerate, and suddenly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your dark energy waves are pushing against each other (the wave front
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in front of it) and then against the foam, and then it will squish in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself, the foam and its its own little bubbles will get squashed a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit, and when you accelerate at c, one wall of the bubble hits the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposite side as it is squished in completely and well you stop dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in your tracks as it locks up in that area.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you had sufficient force to just blow through that, you would get a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supernova explosion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A nuclear explosion is when the nucleus pressure is overcome, and a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supernova when you overcome the pressure of the quantum foam.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Its like a Doppler effect.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just like going through the sound barrier, then the light barrier and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then the quantum barrier.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That much we know. But the rest is still a mystery as to what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; inside the nucleus, inside the quantum foam?
&gt; &gt; &gt; It acts like air, and the foam acts like air bubbles in a superfluid,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but it can't be air can it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; And the size of one bubble is Plank Length.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And that is the smallest discreet anything we know of.
&gt; &gt; &gt; When its not that size, it doesn't exist.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well we can't detect it, we say it is not in the real universe.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible that the bubbles are not uniform in size at Plank
&gt; &gt; &gt; Length?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well we only have data to show they are that size.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And for instance the size of a nucleus of one element will be the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; here as on Alpha Centauri.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But getting back to mass, and particle physicists like particles to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; little things, not wave packets, and so they will say that these
&gt; &gt; &gt; things have mass, when in fact it is not their mass, but rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; borrowed mass, just as a water wave slaps a wall, that mass belongs to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the water molecules, not the wave.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And win the two slit experiment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; make a kids pool, place bowling pins on Styrofoam blocks, now generate
&gt; &gt; &gt; lots of waves in the pool, and when one pin falls over, say look,
&gt; &gt; &gt; there is an electron.

So ok, I am not saying that it is impossible that an advanced alien
race, couldn't some how bathe their ship, in that superfluid liquid,
which would cause the quantum foam to always be displaced and never
squished in by impacts from the wave fronts of the dark energy emitted
by the atoms in the ship.
That it might just slip past it somehow even at a high speed 90 degree
turn.
And I say that because if you happen to see one do that and claim that
is what you saw, who am I to say that you are nuts, if you see it do
that, see it land, then touch it, it is real and you burn your hand.
I am just saying that there is no proof of that and it seems
impossible according to our level of understanding.

And lastly, because of the experiments done in the last 5 or 7 years
regarding Bose-Einstein condensate, and how it acted as predicted
according to wave theory and in accordance with the quantum foam
theories, and the fact that we now have very good views into what
atoms and molecules look like, and can do a lot with lasers to them,
manipulating atoms etc, we have had to rethink the notion, that if you
were to just change the phase of molecules, you could slip them into a
parallel dimension in the multiverse.
It appears as if the stuff of the universe, that superfliud whatever
it is, is here to say, does not leave this universe and all atoms are
just bubbles in it.
Take information to a parallel universe that has its own liquid, then
recreate your bubbles,  you have teleported to a parallel universe.
That gigantic black hole explosion sort of tells us that nothing
escapes this universe.
And it was in the large, just the same as the Bosenova created in the
laboratory.
So from micro to macro, the principles were the same.
All predictable, and in accordance with standard theories.
Modern ones. Not the old fashioned theories.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well foam is in a liquid, and as far as we can tell it is a liquid.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that is why, when it flat-lines, and the nucleus bubble collapses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in super-cooled Bose-Einstein condensate, you can actually detect that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; momentum, of the slap, of the liquid, as the bubble collapses and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liquid slaps on the surrounding surfaces of the foam.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And also the reason we think it is a fluid, is because all motion,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the quantum foam is fluid motion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only flying saucers apparently can make 90 degree turns at high speed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other things with mass, cannot do that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And since that is in the realm of the unproven, it might be because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the laws of physics state, that anything with mass, in this physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe, has to plow through the quantum foam. There is no way around
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot mass cancel nothing.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nada.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No way José Rodriguez.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the only explanation then for any of those sightings or stories, is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one, they are made up, some of them, and two, if there was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything like that seen, it was not made of atoms that had mass, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; must have been made of light as in an illusion, or a mirage, or a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; projection of some kind.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless you can somehow create a beam or a force field that can somehow
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move the quantum foam around without resistance, but there is no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; examples of that happening anywhere in the universe, and always, if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you try to move the foam around it will just lock up and explode.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you move it too quickly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like if you are in a spaceship traveling close to c, the second you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hit c, it becomes a supersolid mass.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Travel at a constant speed, and it is slipping past you with uniform
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motion as a superfluid and no problem, but accelerate, and suddenly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your dark energy waves are pushing against each other (the wave front
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in front of it) and then against the foam, and then it will squish in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself, the foam and its its own little bubbles will get squashed a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit, and when you accelerate at c, one wall of the bubble hits the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposite side as it is squished in completely and well you stop dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in your tracks as it locks up in that area.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you had sufficient force to just blow through that, you would get a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supernova explosion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A nuclear explosion is when the nucleus pressure is overcome, and a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supernova when you overcome the pressure of the quantum foam.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Its like a Doppler effect.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just like going through the sound barrier, then the light barrier and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then the quantum barrier.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That much we know. But the rest is still a mystery as to what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inside the nucleus, inside the quantum foam?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It acts like air, and the foam acts like air bubbles in a superfluid,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but it can't be air can it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the size of one bubble is Plank Length.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that is the smallest discreet anything we know of.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When its not that size, it doesn't exist.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well we can't detect it, we say it is not in the real universe.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible that the bubbles are not uniform in size at Plank
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Length?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well we only have data to show they are that size.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And for instance the size of a nucleus of one element will be the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here as on Alpha Centauri.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But getting back to mass, and particle physicists like particles to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little things, not wave packets, and so they will say that these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things have mass, when in fact it is not their mass, but rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; borrowed mass, just as a water wave slaps a wall, that mass belongs to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the water molecules, not the wave.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And win the two slit experiment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make a kids pool, place bowling pins on Styrofoam blocks, now generate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lots of waves in the pool, and when one pin falls over, say look,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is an electron.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes it will fringe if the waves are coming from one direction the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; principle is the same.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Send waves through a cathode ray tube, and when the right level of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy hits the screen, a photon will be released.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Photons are released by a certain level of energy equal to one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electron.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wave particle duality.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So where is the mass?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does the wave toppling that bowling pin, have its own mass?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is using the mass of the water molecules.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So in reality, the only things with rest mass, are the nulceus of any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; atom, and the quantum foam itself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And where it comes from, is the skin on those bubbles.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The big suck as the universe expands into the void. The skin on those
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bubbles resists that expansion.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And notice how it is working.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Form one point in space-time outward.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is how mass works.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is why it works.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because it is an outward motion. Not a lateral motion.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That outward motion resists lateral movement.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is already moving outward and with force and resisting that force.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Its like a gyroscopic effect.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But not from the spinning, but because it wants to stay put right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where it is and expand.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That would be the path of least resistance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In actuality, a photon is not released. It is created.
&gt; &gt; &gt; When you get sufficient energy, of wave reactions, spherical dark
&gt; &gt; &gt; energy waves that permeate space and are created by the nucleus bubble
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to expand.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It sends out spherical waves of dark energy in the quantum foam.
&gt; &gt; &gt; EM waves. Traveling at c, cresting at the shell radius.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And when those waves combine and interact, adding up and canceling out
&gt; &gt; &gt; they create the covalent bond of atoms, but when you get a certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; level of energy, and waves interact, they will create a transverse
&gt; &gt; &gt; wave. It will shoot out sideways, and you can even see it, and you can
&gt; &gt; &gt; call that a photon, at least one wave of that stretch of waves, you
&gt; &gt; &gt; can call a photon, and when it hits your eye, guess what? It has
&gt; &gt; &gt; sufficient force, to register in your brain as visible light.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If it didn't, it wouldn't be a visible photon it would be just another
&gt; &gt; &gt; level of em wave radiation in the spectrum.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are waves hitting your eyes right now that you can't see.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ultraviolet and all manner of waves.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But the screen of your detector is set up, so that a certain value of
&gt; &gt; &gt; energy wave will create that transverse wave, and it will hit your
&gt; &gt; &gt; eye, and you will say, look, there is an electron, that just hit the
&gt; &gt; &gt; detector, and released a photon, as if it had a whole bunch of them in
&gt; &gt; &gt; its pocket and let one go or something.

&gt; &gt; So here is an experiment you can do...
&gt; &gt; take a laser pointer and point it at a chalkboard and wiggle it like
&gt; &gt; mad.
&gt; &gt; No resistance to your movement.
&gt; &gt; Now take a pointing stick and wave it like mad.
&gt; &gt; Fell the momentum in the stick resisting movement.
&gt; &gt; Light has no mass, the atoms in the stick have mass.
&gt; &gt; Hook it up to a machine.
&gt; &gt; A wiggle machine.
&gt; &gt; The light will end up looking like it is covering an area, and still
&gt; &gt; no resistance.
&gt; &gt; The stick will snap from the pressure.

&gt; So ok, I am not saying that it is impossible that an advanced alien
&gt; race, couldn't some how bathe their ship, in that superfluid liquid,
&gt; which would cause the quantum foam to always be displaced and never
&gt; squished in by impacts from the wave fronts of the dark energy emitted
&gt; by the atoms in the ship.
&gt; That it might just slip past it somehow even at a high speed 90 degree
&gt; turn.
&gt; And I say that because if you happen to see one do that and claim that
&gt; is what you saw, who am I to say that you are nuts, if you see it do
&gt; that, see it land, then touch it, it is real and you burn your hand.
&gt; I am just saying that there is no proof of that and it seems
&gt; impossible according to our level of understanding.
">

You see if you can see it? If you can see the ship, it is giving off
waves isn't it?
So light has no resistance in the foam, but dark energy waves, other
waves in the spectrum, larger waves do add up and will push against
the air molecules, and the skin, from the nuclei, of your ship, will
press against the skin of the quantum foam bubbles.
So if you bounce radar off it, then you assume it is solid.
So then if radar is bouncing off it, why is the dark energy waves of
the air molecules, which is just more em waves at a different energy,
less energy but the same, not also bouncing off it, and if it does,
then you have a mass problem.

Again, take tow strong magnets, and hold like poles in proximity. That
is what it feels like when these waves go against each other.
Granted in a magnet the waves are aligned, but then you are feeling a
small force there.
Travel 6 thousand miles an hour in a several ton ship and do a 90.
No living occupants in that ship.
How could there be?
Anything with mass has momentum.
All that forward momentum, suddenly taking a 90?
Well that is largely why scientists don't believe in flying saucers.

I a very rapidly spinning disk, you might be able to.

was spinning, maybe you wouldn't be affected.
Or would you be?
Step on the gas with your windows up.
Do you feel that quantum foam pressing against you?
Of course you do.
Its everywhere and you are just going through it.
It is so small, that it permeates the universe.
Since inflation, the whole thing is foam.
So regardless of how your ship would handle the air resistance, you
have momentum relative to absolute space-time.
Yourself. Never mind the ship.
The earth drags a lot of it with it as it goes through space, as does
the moon and all other massive bodies, but small bodies feel the force

So in your ship, how do escape the foam?
Is it a perfect vacuum? It can't be. Nothing can withstand that
pressure, even black holes explode.
So even in your flying saucer, you are traveling through foam.
Well what if the hull of your ship was solid nuclei like a neutron
star.
It would weigh as much as the earth then.
Its not as if you can just say well maybe our physics is not the right
physics it is the right physics and our current models, have been put
to the test and never failed even from the smallest imaginable test,

So ok, the earth is plowing through the quantum foam no problem, large
massive body, displacing a large area, and spinning to help to slough
it off so it is not hitting it head on.

So your ship then, sends out waves a mile in all directions, pushing
the quantum foam away from you displacing a large area,
and  your ship is spinning, to slough off head on wave fronts. It
can't push the foam away but it can create a low pressure area, so
that the foam will not bunch up, gain mass and hinder you through it.
Well if they are real, then there must be some explanation, and maybe
that could explain it.
But you would see the clouds displaced if those waves were pushing the
foam away, they would be pushing the air molecules away as the waves
would be impacting the skin of the air and water molecules as it
impacts the skin of the quantum foam.
So then that leaves super fluid, capable of sloughing off the quantum
foam in your surroundings, and you must carry your own foam under
pressure, so you don't decompress and explode.
The foam you carry with you, is not giving you resistance you don't
feel G's because it is moving with you in your reference frame.
The skin of your ship has a superfluid coating, which under all
circumstances, will slough off the foam outside the ship so it has no
resistance.
Maybe even faster than light since if it can slough it off at 25 or 30
thousand miles per hour, the quantum foam bubbles are not being
compressed, and if they are not being compressed, the walls of the
bubbles wouldn't be squished in until the hit each other, which is
where you would have a problem at the light barrier.
So all you have to do, is find a way to use the superfluid stuff of
the universe,  to coat your ship.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just saying that there is no proof of that and it seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impossible according to our level of understanding.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You see if you can see it? If you can see the ship, it is giving off
&gt; &gt; &gt; waves isn't it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; So light has no resistance in the foam, but dark energy waves, other
&gt; &gt; &gt; waves in the spectrum, larger waves do add up and will push against
&gt; &gt; &gt; the air molecules, and the skin, from the nuclei, of your ship, will
&gt; &gt; &gt; press against the skin of the quantum foam bubbles.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So if you bounce radar off it, then you assume it is solid.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So then if radar is bouncing off it, why is the dark energy waves of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the air molecules, which is just more em waves at a different energy,
&gt; &gt; &gt; less energy but the same, not also bouncing off it, and if it does,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then you have a mass problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, take tow strong magnets, and hold like poles in proximity. That
&gt; &gt; &gt; is what it feels like when these waves go against each other.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Granted in a magnet the waves are aligned, but then you are feeling a
&gt; &gt; &gt; small force there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Travel 6 thousand miles an hour in a several ton ship and do a 90.
&gt; &gt; &gt; No living occupants in that ship.
&gt; &gt; &gt; How could there be?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anything with mass has momentum.
&gt; &gt; &gt; All that forward momentum, suddenly taking a 90?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well that is largely why scientists don't believe in flying saucers.

&gt; &gt; Could you transfer that momentum, from a forward direction, then take
&gt; &gt; a ninety, and just turn it, so the momentum is still there, but now
&gt; &gt; facing another direction?
&gt; &gt; I a very rapidly spinning disk, you might be able to.
&gt; &gt; And if, you inside of that ship, were not spinning, but an outer shell
&gt; &gt; was spinning, maybe you wouldn't be affected.
&gt; &gt; Or would you be?
&gt; &gt; Step on the gas with your windows up.
&gt; &gt; Do you feel that quantum foam pressing against you?
&gt; &gt; Of course you do.
&gt; &gt; Its everywhere and you are just going through it.
&gt; &gt; It is so small, that it permeates the universe.
&gt; &gt; Since inflation, the whole thing is foam.
&gt; &gt; So regardless of how your ship would handle the air resistance, you
&gt; &gt; have momentum relative to absolute space-time.
&gt; &gt; Yourself. Never mind the ship.
&gt; &gt; The earth drags a lot of it with it as it goes through space, as does
&gt; &gt; the moon and all other massive bodies, but small bodies feel the force
&gt; &gt; of accelerated mass in the form of G's.
&gt; &gt; So in your ship, how do escape the foam?
&gt; &gt; Is it a perfect vacuum? It can't be. Nothing can withstand that
&gt; &gt; pressure, even black holes explode.
&gt; &gt; So even in your flying saucer, you are traveling through foam.
&gt; &gt; Well what if the hull of your ship was solid nuclei like a neutron
&gt; &gt; star.
&gt; &gt; It would weigh as much as the earth then.
&gt; &gt; Its not as if you can just say well maybe our physics is not the right
&gt; &gt; physics it is the right physics and our current models, have been put
&gt; &gt; to the test and never failed even from the smallest imaginable test,
&gt; &gt; like measuring the momentum, of the skin, of a nucleus bubble, hitting
&gt; &gt; the quantum foam, after you drain it.
&gt; &gt; Predicted, proven, and in accordance with theory.

&gt; So ok, the earth is plowing through the quantum foam no problem, large
&gt; massive body, displacing a large area, and spinning to help to slough
&gt; it off so it is not hitting it head on.

&gt; So your ship then, sends out waves a mile in all directions, pushing
&gt; the quantum foam away from you displacing a large area,
&gt; and  your ship is spinning, to slough off head on wave fronts. It
&gt; can't push the foam away but it can create a low pressure area, so
&gt; that the foam will not bunch up, gain mass and hinder you through it.
&gt; Well if they are real, then there must be some explanation, and maybe
&gt; that could explain it.
&gt; But you would see the clouds displaced if those waves were pushing the
&gt; foam away, they would be pushing the air molecules away as the waves
&gt; would be impacting the skin of the air and water molecules as it
&gt; impacts the skin of the quantum foam.
&gt; So then that leaves super fluid, capable of sloughing off the quantum
&gt; foam in your surroundings, and you must carry your own foam under
&gt; pressure, so you don't decompress and explode.
&gt; The foam you carry with you, is not giving you resistance you don't
&gt; feel G's because it is moving with you in your reference frame.
&gt; The skin of your ship has a superfluid coating, which under all
&gt; circumstances, will slough off the foam outside the ship so it has no
&gt; resistance.
&gt; Maybe even faster than light since if it can slough it off at 25 or 30
&gt; thousand miles per hour, the quantum foam bubbles are not being
&gt; compressed, and if they are not being compressed, the walls of the
&gt; bubbles wouldn't be squished in until the hit each other, which is
&gt; where you would have a problem at the light barrier.
&gt; So all you have to do, is find a way to use the superfluid stuff of
&gt; the universe,  to coat your ship.
">

You see with the million or so reports of flying disks taking off at
incredible speeds, not a single sonic boom.
How is that possible?
Unless there is no friction between the air and their ship.
No wave front.
We need to shoot some Bose-Einstein condensate or squirt it into a
target and coat something with it and accelerate it through a liquid,
and these sorts of experiments to see how it reacts with the quantum
foam of absolute space-time.

And if that can't, if a superfluid that has no friction, can't escape
the foams will to stay where it is in spacetime, expanding along
outwardly, exerting force outward in all directions against its
neighbors, which makes it want to stay put, gives it mass, which is
what resists your mass when you accelerate, then what can escape it?
The foam of the condensate, is reacting with foam outside of that
condensate, with friction, and that friction is transferred to the
foam in the condensate, causing that foam to spin, making vortices in

But what on earth is it reacting with then, to give it that stay
putness?
When there would be nothing staying put in that scenario.
It has to be relative to some stationary something, which is causing
it to spin.
You could say well its spooky action at a distance, but at this level
there is no spooky action at a distance.
Could it be waves then and not direct friction between quantum foam
bubbles?
What is weird is that it is in a lattice.
That condensate is a gazillion times bigger than one quantum foam
bubble. The foam is not spaced apart like that.
So it has to be currents and pressure in the condensate spacing out
the vortices into a loose lattice configuration.
Maybe if you spun it at ultra high speed, it would form a gazillion
vortices.
Yes and then blow up.

Of course. The quantum foam bubbles are expanding and sending out mini
spherical waves of dark energy, just like the nucleus does in an atom.
That results in the different patterns.

And from that link just above...
&quot;The angular momentum of a single vortex has been measured, and found
to be of the order of Planck's constant per particle&quot;
And Plank Length, is the size of one quantum foam bubble. So that
tells us where it is coming from.

And yes if you want you can believe that they are granular pieces of
rock of plank length emitting waves as if they were radioactive but
your theory is going to break down as soon as you include the fact
that the universe expanding and your little rocks are going to bunch
up or get so far apart that matter can't form. And how does the
inflationary period of the universe create your little bits of sand
down there?
So the expanding foam, is the only logical answer. And the foam was
created during the inflationary period of the universe, and the big
suck makes it expand. It stays at plank length because it is all
relative, expanding in unison.
Equal pressure everywhere at that level between the bubbles.
At least in terms of its outward direction.
In terms of how it expands into the void. As the void must also be
between the bubbles.
uncompressible fluid except that you can compress it, with black hole
energies, and even flatten some of those bubbles, creating a collapse
of the foam in that region, and then the gigantic explosion ensues.
So is it possible then, that the void is filled with that liquid, and
the bubbles are merely expanding in that liquid?
So that the void,  a perfect vacuum, is not in fact an empty space,
but is a liquid.
Then maybe outside of that, would be the real void.
It must be because you cannot say that the void has space, it does not
have even a micron of thickness on the outside of the universe because
it is empty completely. A thin film of nothing. A self contained
universe. A puddle.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the condensate.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the only possible thing would be the liquid between the foam
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bubbles whatever it is. And right now I don't think we can detect it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok so there is the slight possibility, that the quantum foam of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; condensate is not acting with friction against foam outside the
&gt; &gt; &gt; condensate and transferring that friction to the foam in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; condensate but instead, just the fact that the foam in the condensate
&gt; &gt; &gt; has mass, like gyroscopic mass from its expanding, is resisting
&gt; &gt; &gt; spinning with the entire condensate.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But what on earth is it reacting with then, to give it that stay
&gt; &gt; &gt; putness?
&gt; &gt; &gt; When there would be nothing staying put in that scenario.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It has to be relative to some stationary something, which is causing
&gt; &gt; &gt; it to spin.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You could say well its spooky action at a distance, but at this level
&gt; &gt; &gt; there is no spooky action at a distance.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Could it be waves then and not direct friction between quantum foam
&gt; &gt; &gt; bubbles?
&gt; &gt; &gt; What is weird is that it is in a lattice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That condensate is a gazillion times bigger than one quantum foam
&gt; &gt; &gt; bubble. The foam is not spaced apart like that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So it has to be currents and pressure in the condensate spacing out
&gt; &gt; &gt; the vortices into a loose lattice configuration.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe if you spun it at ultra high speed, it would form a gazillion
&gt; &gt; &gt; vortices.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes and then blow up.

&gt; &gt; http://tinyurl.com/2gap23
&gt; &gt; Of course. The quantum foam bubbles are expanding and sending out mini
&gt; &gt; spherical waves of dark energy, just like the nucleus does in an atom.
&gt; &gt; That results in the different patterns.

&gt; &gt; And from that link just above...
&gt; &gt; &quot;The angular momentum of a single vortex has been measured, and found
&gt; &gt; to be of the order of Planck's constant per particle&quot;
&gt; &gt; And Plank Length, is the size of one quantum foam bubble. So that
&gt; &gt; tells us where it is coming from.

&gt; And yes if you want you can believe that they are granular pieces of
&gt; rock of plank length emitting waves as if they were radioactive but
&gt; your theory is going to break down as soon as you include the fact
&gt; that the universe expanding and your little rocks are going to bunch
&gt; up or get so far apart that matter can't form. And how does the
&gt; inflationary period of the universe create your little bits of sand
&gt; down there?
&gt; So the expanding foam, is the only logical answer. And the foam was
&gt; created during the inflationary period of the universe, and the big
&gt; suck makes it expand. It stays at plank length because it is all
&gt; relative, expanding in unison.
&gt; Equal pressure everywhere at that level between the bubbles.
&gt; At least in terms of its outward direction.
&gt; In terms of how it expands into the void. As the void must also be
&gt; between the bubbles.
&gt; uncompressible fluid except that you can compress it, with black hole
&gt; energies, and even flatten some of those bubbles, creating a collapse
&gt; of the foam in that region, and then the gigantic explosion ensues.
&gt; So is it possible then, that the void is filled with that liquid, and
&gt; the bubbles are merely expanding in that liquid?
&gt; So that the void,  a perfect vacuum, is not in fact an empty space,
&gt; but is a liquid.
&gt; Then maybe outside of that, would be the real void.
&gt; It must be because you cannot say that the void has space, it does not
&gt; have even a micron of thickness on the outside of the universe because
&gt; it is empty completely. A thin film of nothing. A self contained

No I guess you can't compress the fluid. You can only compress the
bubbles, squish them or flatten them.

Well that doesn't work because if you cannot compress that fluid, you

I don't know. There is just not enough information yet.
Perfect elasticity. That is what Einstein called it.
With regards to Brownian motion.
The idea that something can bounce back, with the exact same amount of
energy and no energy is lost to the medium.
Like a pin ball machine, elastic bumper, that would not absorb any of
the force, but would return the exact amount of force to the  ball,
that it hit the elastic with.
You see the quantum foam is expanding, so is the fkuid expanding with
it and if not, the fluid will get thin and the foam will brust and it
would have happened by now, you would think.
So then, does it have perfect elasticity?
Or at least a great deal of elasticity so that eventually the foam
will burst.
The other option, is that it is expanding into Hilbert Space. And is
not really changing in size in this 3D space.
But then you can see how that would work with balloons, because
surrounding the balloons is the void, and they can expand into that
void and you would not see any change except eventually the skin would
get too thin and pop.
Seeds of entropy. If there were seeds of entropy would that not mean
there would have to be, a seed for every bubble?
If you take a liquid in a bell jar and flip the switch evacuate it,
poof you get foam. Inflationary period of the universe.
It is still expanding.
Well, we don't have all the answers yet.
What if, they were not bubbles, but like cells, and using a form of
cell division, the universe was expanding.
Well that would mean that the universe doubles in size ever time they
divide and so that can't be right.
We should put condensate through as many tests as we can, and liquid
helium, and see what we can find out about the properties of the foam,
and the energy emitted.
I think we have found the missing dark energy though. If the foam is
expanding, and emitting spherical waves, then thats a lot of
background radiation permeating the universe.

&quot;Well sand particles can act like a fluid&quot;

But then why don't we see large pieces of absolute space-time in solid
blocks, where these irregular shaped sand bits have gathered together
and locked up?

How would a black hole ever explode if space-time in the center of a
black hole was a solid block of sand particles?
They aren't elastic.
