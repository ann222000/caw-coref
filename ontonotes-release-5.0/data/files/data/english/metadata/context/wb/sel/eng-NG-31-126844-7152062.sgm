The trial begins. Are people interested in something that affects
Britain? If so we will try to put up snippets! It could have had
repurcussions on American and European lives, of course!

plot' trial starts Â 21 July 'bomb

The trial is expected to generate massive media coverage
The trial of six men accused of attempting to carry out bomb attacks in
London on 21 July is to start.
The six defendants are charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy
to cause explosions.

Muktar Said Ibrahim, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, Hussein Osman, Yassin Omar,
Ramzi Mohammed and Adel Yahya deny all the charges.

The trial at Woolwich Crown Court in south-east London is expected to
last up to four months.

On Friday the judge Mr Justice Fulford told the jury: "It is on the
basis of the evidence in this court and nothing else that you will be
asked to reach your verdict in this case.

"You must remain wholly unaffected by any emotion and you must be
wholly unaffected by any feelings of apprehension that you might have
had in 2005."

CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

The main allegations made by the prosecution on the first day of the
trial were as follows:

The case is concerned with an "extremist Muslim plot", the ultimate
objective being to carry out a number of "murderous suicide bombings"
on London's public transport system

The day eventually chosen was Thursday, 21 July 2005, just 14 days
after the 7 July London bombings

The conspiracy had been in existence long before the events of 7 July
and did not appear to be some hastily arranged copycat

The men, all originally from Africa but living in London, were all
known to each other by the summer of 2005

Mr Ibrahim, Mr Omar, Mr Osman and Mr Yahya all held extremist views,
and Mr Ibrahim, Mr Omar and Mr Yahya had all spoken about carrying out
jihad

Mr Omar's one-bedroom flat in New Southgate, north London, was a bomb
factory where most of the work required to make the bombs was carried
out

Nigel Sweeney says the plot was not a copycat of the 7 July attacks

Six bombs were made using a mix of liquid hydrogen peroxide, chapati
flour, acetone and acid but failed to detonate because of too low a
concentration of hydrogen peroxide

The bombs were placed in a large plastic container with screws, tacks,
washers or nuts taped to the outside to cause as much injury as
possible

All of the bombers were would-be suicide bombers except for Mr Yahya,
who was out of the country on 21 July 2005

Mr Mohammed wrote a suicide note, which was found in pieces after his
arrest

Mr Asiedu lost his nerve at the last moment and dumped his bomb

Mr Ibrahim had been trained for jihad in the Sudan in 2003 and
travelled to Pakistan the following year to "take part in jihad" or
train for it

Mr Omar fled London after the attempted bombings disguised as a woman
wearing a burka

After being arrested in Rome, Mr Osman told police there the plot had
been a "deliberate hoax", not a serious attempt to kill commuters"

'Suicide bomb' CCTV shown to jury

The jury was shown CCTV pictures taken on a train
A jury has been shown CCTV footage of the moment an alleged suicide
bomber tried to detonate a device on a London underground train on 21
July 2005.
The pictures taken on a train near Oval station, south London, were
played to the jury at Woolwich Crown Court.

Prosecutors allege the failed bid was planned before the 7 July 2005
attacks.

Pictures of the 21/7 suspects
The footage shows Mr Mohammed, 25, boarding the train with a rucksack,
and turning so that the rucksack on his back faces towards a mother and
her child before apparently trying and failing to detonate a bomb.

The jury watched as the CCTV footage showed all the passengers on board
the carriage trying to get away from the scene except for fireman Angus
Campbell who remonstrated with Mr Mohammed.

"Mohammed said not that it was a bomb but rather 'what's the matter, it
is bread, it isn't me, it was that', pointing to the rucksack,"
prosecuting counsel Nigel Sweeney QC said.

Mr Mohammed is later seen running up the escalator after the train had
arrived at Oval as he made his way out of the station, chased by
several members of the public.

'Crowded platform'

The court also heard details of Mr Omar's alleged failed attempt to
detonate his bomb on a Victoria Line tube approaching Warren Street
station.

Afterwards, as he fled Warren Street station, heading north up
Hampstead Road, Mr Omar approached two women in full Muslim dress, Mr
Sweeney said.

"He demanded of the younger woman that she take him to her home," Mr
Sweeney added.

"When she declined he said words to the effect of 'What kind of Muslim
are you not helping another Muslim?'"

Mr Osman, meanwhile, is alleged to have tried to set off a bomb in his
rucksack on a Hammersmith and City line tube between Latimer Road and
Shepherd's Bush.

"Some passengers recall him being thrown off his feet and landing on
the floor of the carriage still wearing his rucksack," Mr Sweeney said.

When the train had arrived at the open air Shepherd's Bush station, Mr
Osman had squeezed himself between two carriages to hide before
escaping over a trackside wall, Mr Sweeney added.

The court was also shown footage of Mr Ibrahim trying to set off his
bomb on the top deck of a number 26 bus in Shoreditch.

As with all the other instances, the main explosive charge in the bomb
failed to explode.

'Not copycat'

Earlier, the jury heard that components for the devices started to be
bought in late April or early May and that a "bomb factory" had been
set up at the flat of Mr Omar in New Southgate.

THE ACCUSED
Muktar Said Ibrahim, 28, from Stoke Newington, north London
Ramzi Mohammed, 25, from North Kensington, west London
Yassin Omar, 26, from New Southgate, north London
Hussein Osman, 28, of no fixed address
Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, 33, of no fixed address
Adel Yahya, 24, of High Road, Tottenham, north London

"The events with which you are concerned... are plainly not some
hastily-arranged repetition of the devastating events of 7/7, plainly
not some hastily-arranged copycat," Mr Sweeney said.

He said the defendants had chosen to mount their attack at lunchtime to
avoid enhanced rush hour security in the wake of the 7 July bombings.

The prosecution has said all of the bombers were would-be suicide
bombers except for Mr Yahya, who was out of the country on 21 July
2005.

Mr Asiedu allegedly lost his nerve at the last moment and dumped his
bomb.

The trial continues. "

The following clip is interesting because it shows that these would be
Islamic martyrs were not deprived, unprevileged, poor, downtrodden,
persecuted, and targetted pathetic Muslims. Most came from
homes/environments in Britain that would have been envied by anyone who
came from their homelands or even in Britiain itself. It highlights
that their convictions were mostly the effect of the Islamic creeds and
doctrines. It shows that the fundamental and basic teachings of Islam
that these men received as children came to germinate as young men.
This is an aspect of Islam that is not perceived or comprehended by
those with a Judeo-Christian upbringing! Now I quote:

"Defendants 'attracted to Islam'
By Chris Summers
BBC News, Woolwich Crown Court

The 21 July bomb plot trial has heard from a former school friend of
two of the defendants about how they first became interested in Islam.

Six men face charges of conspiracy to murder on 21 July, 2005

Stephen Bentley went to school with Adel Yahya and also befriended
Yassin Omar, who attended a different school.

Mr Bentley, a 26-year-old data analyst, said he had known both men
since the age of 13.

He said they had shared a love of football and computer games.

Asked by Max Hill, prosecuting, what Mr Yahya was like as a youngster
he said: "He was a very friendly guy, very into football, Arsenal fan.
Very into computer games, boys' stuff, you know."

Mr Bentley, who was brought up in a Christian family, said after
leaving school in north London he went to university and only came back
to see his friends in the summer holidays.

He (Adel Yahya, pictured) was a very friendly guy, very into football,
Arsenal fan. Very into computer games, boys' stuff

Stephen Bentley

He said both had become very interested in Islam and he said they had
talked to him about the religion and even persuaded him to convert.

Later, under cross examination, Mr Bentley was asked what attracted him
to Islam. He said: "It seemed to have a lot of the answers to life's
questions."

Mr Bentley said Mr Omar began wearing a robe and a hat, rather than
western clothing.

He was asked what views Mr Omar had about world affairs.

"He said about the Taleban establishing an Islamic state in
Afghanistan. He believed an Islamic state would be a good thing so it
seemed that he supported them."

Mr Bentley said Mr Omar, who was Somali but lived with British foster
parents, also supported the Palestinian cause.

He said Mr Omar and Mr Yahya often went to the Finsbury Park mosque to
hear the radical preacher Abu Hamza.

Mr Bentley was asked about Mr Omar's views about 9/11.

"He said he didn't think it was done by Osama Bin Laden," he said.

Mr Hill asked him what had led Mr Omar to take that view.

"He said Abu Hamza said it wasn't and Abu Hamza knew Osama Bin Laden,"
he replied.

He was asked if Mr Omar had any views about the British government at
the time.

He replied: "Nothing specific but I suppose that he had a feeling the
government in this country was too much on the side of the American
government."

Mr Bentley also said that Mr Yahya made it clear he did not trust the
British media to report world affairs accurately.

Mr Bentley said he returned to university in October 2001 and lost
contact with Mr Omar and Mr Yahya.

He said he contacted police shortly after 21 July 2005 because he
recognised the name Yassin Omar. "
