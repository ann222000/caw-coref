Steve, as I understand it, all of the new dollar coins are intended to have
the edge lettering on them.  For whatever reason, some have been found that
do not have any edge lettering on them.  These are seen by some enthusiasts
as being highly collectable.

The &quot;hit or miss&quot; that you may be thinking of is whether the edge lettering
is facing the same way from one coin to another.  This is strictly random,
and where one coin will have it reading correctly when the *obverse* side is
facing up, another coin will read correctly when the *reverse* is facing
up...

Correct me if I am wrong (I know you will!) but I believe that the
proof Presidential dollars will only be in one direction.
