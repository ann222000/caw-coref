A great idea to transmit the right message to tailgaters. I wished this
useful invention would came with every car. It's positively funny
anyways.

Id rather have one that lights up as bright as the field lights at
Fenway Park.... and is in FRONT of the car, so that the goddamn
douchebags here in Florida who insist on doing 45 in the passing lane
can get the picture.

Better yet.... james bond style missles to simply kill them.  They are
usually pickup truck driving white trash ... so, clear the highways,
clean the gene pool.  One stop shopping!

Sorry. This is Off Topic for a Porsche group. We're never troubled by
tailgaters.

Hth,

Not entirely true, Fred.  I get my fair share of Bozos that hafta
'challenge' me to a freekway race or just want to annoy me.  I generally
don't bite, since it is generally foolish.  Sometimes though, if the
safe opportunity presents itself, I'll downshift and leave 'em behind.

Dead Senator is correct.  Even my friends who drive Corvette Cabrio's report
the same...

Yeah... its always some idiot in a mitsubishi or a "souped up" dodge
neon who wants to race.  I dont even bother... because I know that if
he's dumb enough to plunk down $15K in "upgrades" to a Neon, there is
no way he knows how to drive.  Even if he does, I doubt his stupid
shit-box toaster on wheels can handle the HP he has jammed into it (if
any).

Chances are, you'll beat him, but he'll lose control and cause an
accident.  And even if you are ahead of him, that could wind up bad for
you.
