Which would be the more sensible OS to install on a
PowerMac 7200/75 with 56MB RAM and a 9GB hard disk?

I have CDs of OS 8.0 (which I can boost to 8.1, and
then copy across to a HFS+ partition) and 9.1 (which
would install in one step.)

OS 9.1 will also be useful if I can find a spare PCI
USB card; but will it be a lot slower than 8.1?

I run 9.x on all my old PowerMacs. In theory I might use 8.6 if
they're /really/ low on RAM - like say 32MB or less.

8.5 was the first PowerPC-only kernel and allegedly drops some of the
68k baggage. However, it's a bit buggy, so I always go straight to
8.6.

But in my experience 9.x will run fine on any modestly well-specced
PowerMac. I reckon 48M is enough and 64M is better if you can get
there. 9.1 on machines for which that's the last, or 9.2.2. With 9.2.2
you get the latest MSN Messenger and other niceties, but 9.2 will only
run on some later-model PCI PowerMacs. Given enough RAM, though, you
can take a Mac which only runs 9.1, put OS X on it with XPostFacto,
then run 9.2.2 under Classic.

Go to at least 8.5.1, if not 8.6.

8.0 introduced Gossamer (first G3 desktop) support.

8.1 added support for slave drives on the Gossamer motherboard (requires
Rev. B or Rev. C ROM).

Definitely. I should have mentioned that; I put it in, thought for a
moment, wasn't 100% certain, so removed it again. Ah, well. :¬)

8.6 added significant function, such that 8.5.1 may be the highest level
which certain programs or hardware might work.

The PC Compatibility card was supported at the 8.5 level ONLY with a
patch, so 8.1 is its last official support point. Once the software for
that card was spun-off to a Canadian company, software support beyond
8.1/8.5.1 was released, including at least 8.6, and possibly 9.0.

So, it may be good to have both 8.5.1 and 8.6, and then test everything
on each, and fall back to 8.5.1 only if you have issues with 8.6.

My original Gossamer, still operational, still has 8.6.

My later Gossamers, all now removed from service, have 9.2.1.

They sold the updated software for a few years, then
when sales dropped to nothing they released it as
unsupported freeware.

It's not the shortage of memory (by modern standards) that
I'm most worried about, but the relatively slow 75MHz CPU.

I'd like to get the computer working nicely for accessing
broadband by the ethernet port. Then I'm going to give it
to someone on Freecycle who has begged me for a net-ready
computer. It has to be reasonably functional (i.e. run a
reasonably up-to-date web browser and MSN chat client),
and above all, not give the impression of being slow.

The increased functionality of 8.5.1 or 8.6, as compared
with 8.1, will most likely make it that bit slower. The
presence of 68040 legacy code in a Fat Binary (such as
OS 8.1 itself) shouldn't make that much difference to
the running speed (if it's compiled in both 68K and PPC
opcodes, the PPC CPU will simply ignore the 68K stuff.)

You'd want to install 8.0 for PPC only. That
eliminates installing any 68K code with functions
duplicated by PPC code when installing for any Mac.
However, there's still 68K code in the System.

What I don't know is if the 8.1 update converts a PPC
only 8.0 install to a Fat install that'll boot an 040.

That's always been the main thing I don't like about
updates from 8.0 to 8.1, 8.5 to 8.6 and the 9.x.x
series. It's useless to do a custom install of the
starting version because the updaters don't allow you
to choose what NOT to install, so you end up having to
manually delete things for stuff your Mac doesn't
have.

A 75Mhz computer, no matter what kind it is, won't
give the impression of being slow on the net, it will
be slow on the net. :P It should be tolerable for
e-mail, especially on DSL or other broadband, but
loading websites is not going to be speedy, due a lot
to how un-optimized most web browsers are. They're
like most other apps these days, relying on sheer CPU
grunt power and lots of RAM to hide how bloated and
slow at page rendering they are.

Er, yeah.

I find it interesting that you solicit advice or comment and then tell
the giver that it's all wrong. Do you get far with that approach,
usually?

I entirely disagree with your comments, based on my own substantial
direct experience.

If you want to put the Mac online, you need the latest version, but on
a machine of that age, you may as well forget it. There /are/ no
decent modern browsers for MacOS 9 or before. There's iCab, which is a
bit flakey, IE5, which is old and tired, and WamCom, a port of Mozilla
1.3.1, which is old and tired too and also rather buggy and unstable.

All require lots of RAM and a fast CPU to have a decent stab at the
Web of 2007. I've tried it. A 333MHz G3 with 192MB of RAM works after
a fashion, painfully slowly, and delivers an unsatisfactory
experience. I last used this platform in June and it was very
unpleasant.

For MSN, you can only use the final version of the MS client - and it
/only/ runs on MacOS 9.2.2. There's a hack to run it on 9.1 but it
needs redoing every reboot so is hardly ideal. I'm not aware of *any*
3rd party clients or multiprotocol clients for OS9.

The PPC was first supported with 7.5.&lt;something&gt;, but with 7.6.1 it was
reasonably reliable as a PPC platform.

While Apple was shipping 8.0 and later with some PPC Macs, the clones,
including at least Motorola, were still shipping a PPC version of 7.6.1.

7.6.1 is a good MacOS for 68K and PPC Macs alike.

System 6 is kinda fun in its way, sure, and it's very quick on an old
680x0-powered Mac, but I don't think it will run on a PowerPC-powered
Mac at all, and it must be said, for all that it is very small and
fast, it's utterly useless on the Web!

sorry for top posting, but its really not that bad.

I use 9.2.2 and mozilla on a g3kanga powerbook and it works

better in some ways but a lot to do with the size of the screen.

nevertheless, the g3 is 6 times faster and the g4 is 3 times faster
than
that and if you expect 75mhz to do internet just fine in 2007 well you
are
out of luck.

at least with macos. maybe some linux hacker could do something for
it, like dillo or something.

imho its probably ok to put 8,1 and icab2.9 on this machine but not
to give it to the person who wanted it as it is not going to satisfy
them.
even if they spent $100 on a cpu upgrade it still wouldn't. they need
a recent mac.

rid of most of the 680x0 code and it has a lot of support for later
day, pre OS X software.

OS 6.0.8 - been using it for off-line for over 18 years on an old workhorse IIci configured with 32MB RAM and 1.2GB internal and 19GB external HDs.  Tried almost all versions of OS from 7.1 to 7.6.1 and OS 6.0.8, just like the ME109 E is (was) the best of the lot.

I am 75 and on my way down that mountain and I agree with that youngster of 12 who is on his way up.

um i don't know for sure because im only 12 ( but im pretty good with
computers i know perl and python and C++ ) but i think you should
install 6.08 because it would be FAST and 6.08 is the most bestest
ever if you ask me and you can download it of OS 6 Heaven

I bought several clones after the licensing debacle that had 7.6.1 installed
and had an OS 8 disk included but not installed.

&gt; &gt;um i don't know for sure because im only 12 ...

&gt; The PPC was first supported with 7.5.&lt;something&gt;, but with 7.6.1 it was
&gt; reasonably reliable as a PPC platform.

&gt; While Apple was shipping 8.0 and later with some PPC Macs, the clones,
&gt; including at least Motorola, were still shipping a PPC version of 7.6.1.

&gt; 7.6.1 is a good MacOS for 68K and PPC Macs alike.

&gt; You'd want to install 8.0 for PPC only. That
&gt; eliminates installing any 68K code with functions
&gt; duplicated by PPC code when installing for any Mac.
&gt; However, there's still 68K code in the System.

I stumbled across that option almost by chance, after
your post alerted me to its existence.

The automated install is a lot more convenient, because
once started, it needs no further intervention (up to
the point where you restart the computer). If you select
the custom install, all the bundled installers (Open
Transport, Remote Access, etc.) ask for your input
before running.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What I don't know is if the 8.1 update converts a PPC
&gt; only 8.0 install to a Fat install that'll boot an 040.

So, while sitting there for an hour, waiting for the
PPC-only OS 8.0 to install, followed by the 8.1 update,
I noticed that Open Transport (for 8.1) only installed
from folders 1, 3 and 4; not folder 2. I ought to have
a look inside the OS 8.1 self-mounting image, to see if
OT folder 2 contains the 68040 build.

The OS does keep track of what has been installed, or
at the very least, the installer can check for itself.
The Custom Remove option needs that, in order to work.
A sensible update installer *should* be able to do the
same, to install only what's necessary.

If you're trying to get the computer to run Java or Flash,
it's inevitable that it will crawl - and I'll try not to
mention streamed internet video.

However, it's my experience that even the OS 9.1 Finder
is a little sluggish on the 7200/75. For example, when
I click on the menu bar for the first time, it takes
about a quarter of a second to respond.

If you double the CPU and RAM requirements of the core
OS functions, it makes no difference on a fast computer
(whether you have 99% or 98% resources free), but it
really impacts a computer that is already struggling
to run the OS to begin with.

Basically, a PowerMac with OS 8.1 and IE 4.1 can make
sense of a certain subset of the web pages out there;
with OS 9.1 and IE 5.1, that subset is somewhat larger,
but *everything* is that bit slower. If the computer
is limited in what it can do, a Freecycle recipient
may be happy enough with it; if it's so busy running
all sorts of extensions that it takes ages to render
a page of HTML, it won't be used *at all*.

Someone on my local Freecycle group has just posted a Wanted

OK. That means I have to revise my expectations downward.

iCab 3.x requires OS 8.6; Opera 6.0.x requires OS 8.6 and
Carbon. I've put iCab 2.9.9 PPC on there, because it seems
to be the latest browser that runs on 8.1.

I am nearly 50 and just circling in the middle. I am a thinker and the
pace
of supposed progress is just too fast for me.

I am still thinking about this 7200. I found this interesting web
story about it:
http://www.mathdittos2.com/columns/bh/bh981122.html

author had 8.6 but never put it on, was happy with 8.1 but a neighbor
who
had a more troublesome machine of his kept his at 7.6

although i have not done much with 7.6 or with 8.6 either, sometimes i
have
thought it may be depends on what exact models you have.

the more i think about the 7200 if i had it here i would throw my odd
stick of ram from my 8500 in it (64MB more) and copy my install
of yellow dog linux 2.1. this was the last version before the bloat
and
2nd to last to fully support older pci powermacs. i had used it some
on an powerbook and i had found an unofficial build of firefox. it was
pretty basic but it worked and pretty fast. i gave it up for several
reasons
none of which really would matter here.  i did work on this ydl for a
little
while and fix it up some. there are archives of bonus software still
on line.
not fancy latest versions but most of the nice freeware of linux is
there.

a talented student or retired person could certainly get a good deal
of
use out of it.

btw there was some sort of an upgrade cpu for the 7200 even though it
was soldered they had some cache slot or maybe pci card too.

While a 7300, 7500, 7600 and all 85xx, 86xx, 95xx and 96xx machines can
take 7200 RAM, the reverse is not true.

The 7200 must have FPM RAM, never EDO RAM.

And, while the Apple Network Server spec says the ANS must have FPM RAM
(and that it must be parity), the ANS will accept EDO as if it was FPM
(as will the 9500, from which it was designed), and it will accept
non-parity RAM, too. But, just one stick of non-parity RAM turns off
parity checking for all RAM.
