I have a US 1866 nickel and a 1803 liberty head penny both have a single
small hole &quot;drilled&quot; into them.  Are coins with &quot;drilled&quot; holes of any
value?

They have value as a curiosity, but that's about it.  One of our regular
posters is trying to assemble a type set of holed coins, and may respond
eventually.

Sure, some older ones can have surprising value.  Do an eBay search on
&quot;holed&quot; and &quot;dollar&quot; or &quot;half&quot;  and you may be surprised what people will
pay for higher grade early type coins that have holes and/or have been

Holed coins are considered damaged, so their collector value is
seriously decreased.  However, rare coins with a hole will fetch some
value on the market, especially if the rest of the coin is attractive.
Some collectors will bid on these, to a point, when they don't want to
pay regular prices for an otherwise good looking rare coin.

For example, I would gladly pay a few bucks for a holed 1877 Indian
cent, nice looking with XF details or better.  Hmmm, how nice is that
1803 cent of yours?   ;-)

I was part of a discussion in another online group, and the topic of holed

are correct in your observation that holed coins may fetch handsome prices,

based on my experience and observations, that the answer would be &quot;not

it to ignorance and luck, as opposed to market trends, methinks.  On the
other hand, are we really in this for the money?

Holed coins have a market value of about 10 to 40 percent of the same
coin if undamaged. Holes detract from the eye appeal of a coin but can
add to the history.

Coins have had holes drilled, nailed, or poked in them from the
beginning of coinage for a multiplicity of different reasons.
Sometimes coin were holed so they could be worn as a medallion,
necklace, bracelet, anklet, or hood adornment or used as a fibula,
button, or other fastener. Other times they were nailed to a door,
threshold, wall, military standard, lance, or spear as a good luck
charm or talisman or as praise to their god or ruler. Some holed coins
were fastened, overlapping, onto a leather tunic to make armor.
Multiholed coins have been used as strainers at the bottom of clay
funnels to remove bits of grain in the process of making grain. In
more recent times coins were holed to be used in industrial machinery
in place of a washer or similar device. Some people have holed coins
so they could string them together with a strip of rawhide, rope, or
horse hair to wear around their neck, where they could be concealed
under a garment rather than carried more openly, and dangerously, in a
pocket or purse. People today hole coins to use them on a keychain.
One person I've heard about has nailed hundreds of coins to the beams
of his house as decoration, matching the color of the nail to the
metal of the coin. No doubt coins have been holed for other purposes
as well.

Sometimes you can get a feel for what purpose the hole or holes served
by the type of coin, the type of hole, and whether there's one or more
than one, or at least narrow down the possibilities.

Regarding terminology, some people make the distinction of referring
to coins minted with holes (Chinese cash, for instance) as &quot;holed
coins&quot; while using the term &quot;pierced coins&quot; to refer to coins that
weren't designed that way.

Piercing or holing coins was more common in the 19th century than the
20th. You see, for instance, a greater percentage of Seated coins that
were holed than more recent series.

Some people write off holed coins as junk and worthless, and dealers
regard them as culls, but there's clearly interest in them among some
collectors, and market value.

Personally, I'm nearly finished building a set of holed U.S. type
coins that I can find for under $10. I have 41, need 3. Quirky. But
fun. I'd never hole a coin myself, though, even pocket change. I also
try to add a holed specimen, when I can find one, in those series I
specialize in, from U.S. Bust dollars to ancient Thasos tetradrachms.
The contrast between holed and in tact can be visually interesting,
same as with other variations.

The market for them won't disappear. If you have to compete with other
collectors in bidding for a holed coin today on eBay, if you sell it
down the road, there will in all likelihood be the same kind of
interest. A dealer may try to write it off as junk, but you can reach
collectors directly through eBay or whatever might replace it in the
future. Heirs have less incentive or interest in selling directly to
collectors, so in this case I can see how at least part of the
investment in them could be lost.

Like I mentioned in an earlier thread, I bought a nice EF-AU Seated Liberty
dollar on eBay that had a hole in it for a price less than G4.  I always
admired the size and beauty of this series, but couldn't afford a high grade
problem-free one.  Now I can enjoy looking at the details in my new prize
and I have no problem ignoring the hole.  If I had to resell it one day, I
suspect I could get my money back using eBay again.

I wouldn't consider this coin &quot;junk&quot; at all.   I paid three figures for it
because it was worth that much to me, as it was to the runner-up bidder
behind me.  I doubt I'll ever see a coin such as this in a dealer's junk box
with the holed AG late date large cents.

I don't believe we really have a phobia per se about holed coins.   Most of
us probably agree that once a coin has been holed, it SHOULD be near
worthless -- in theory.  I agree that most holed coins do lose a huge
percentage of their attraction and value.  But if it's high priced coin,
there will still be collectors who will pay decent money for it.  I have
noticed this on eBay.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if a holed EF 1916-D
dime would still bring four figures on eBay.  About seven or eight years ago
I auctioned a damaged 1811/09 dime from my junk box-- holed and dented,
probably VG otherwise -- for about $50.  That experience opened my eyes to
what some collectors will pay for stuff like that.

The few times I have knowingly bought damaged coins, it was because I really
liked the design, series, date, etc., and because I couldn't otherwise
afford an undamaged one.  The prices I paid were worth it to me.   I gave no
consideration to liquidity, because I didn't buy them for resale, just for
my own enjoyment.

I would rather have a coin with a clean hole it than one that has been
crudely plugged.  Like the Colonial furniture you mentioned-- better an
original table with a damaged or missing piece than one with someone's
attempt at repair or replacement.

Most holed coins I have acquired in my life have been spent or if
particularly worthless,
like a holed Lincoln cent, thrown in the trash.  I can't think of a single
holed item in my collection.
I do have some in my junk box that I haven't disposed of by spending,
selling or melting to be reborn into some other item.

I do have some pretty crappy items in my collection just nothing holed.  I
would rather have the empty hole that the holed coin.  But that is my
preference, I certainly don't intend to imply that that is the way it must
be done.  Everyone decides what they will collect and not and that is as it
should be.
I bet I have a lot of items in my collection most mainstream US collectors
would simply dispose of in the trash bin  :-)

Are you kidding? Folks around here spaz out at the mere mention of
even CLEANING a dirty coin! If we're going to have a collective stroke
when someone shows us a cleaned coin, it would come as no surprise to
me if we collectively exploded over a repaired coin. After all, if
cleaning can &quot;damage&quot; the fine patina and delicate surfaces that make
a coin grade what it does, how much worse is plugging a hole and
adding FAKE letters or features to &quot;restore&quot; the surface! Great stock
is placed in coins being &quot;original&quot;, with all damage, crud and patina
included. Anything less is damaged goods.

No, but monetary considerations often play into a transaction. A whole
or original coin that is undamaged should command a premium over a
damaged coin because its condition is better on the whole (even if the
actual grade is the same). A repaired coin, even if nicely plugged and
restored, is still a damaged coin, only it's been tinkered with. If
I'm going to spend a lot of money for a coin, I would want the best
example possible. I would expect to pay a lot less for a damaged or a
repaired coin than for a whole example.

You should have swapped that with me. I have a couple of these English
cartwheel pennies, but neither has a hole in it. I'm very
disappointed. &lt;g&gt; No, I won't do it myself. One actually is graded
Poor, almost worn down to a slug. You can barely make out the devices
and legends. Like a holed coin would, it makes an interesting visual
contrast to the EF specimen I have.

&gt;&gt;I have a US 1866 nickel and a 1803 liberty head penny both have a single

&gt;&gt;value?

&gt; Holed coins have a market value of about 10 to 40 percent of the same
&gt; coin if undamaged. Holes detract from the eye appeal of a coin but can
&gt; add to the history.

&gt; Coins have had holes drilled, nailed, or poked in them from the
&gt; beginning of coinage for a multiplicity of different reasons.
&gt; Sometimes coin were holed so they could be worn as a medallion,
&gt; necklace, bracelet, anklet, or hood adornment or used as a fibula,
&gt; button, or other fastener. Other times they were nailed to a door,
&gt; threshold, wall, military standard, lance, or spear as a good luck
&gt; charm or talisman or as praise to their god or ruler. Some holed coins
&gt; were fastened, overlapping, onto a leather tunic to make armor.
&gt; Multiholed coins have been used as strainers at the bottom of clay
&gt; funnels to remove bits of grain in the process of making grain. In
&gt; more recent times coins were holed to be used in industrial machinery
&gt; in place of a washer or similar device. Some people have holed coins
&gt; so they could string them together with a strip of rawhide, rope, or
&gt; horse hair to wear around their neck, where they could be concealed
&gt; under a garment rather than carried more openly, and dangerously, in a
&gt; pocket or purse. People today hole coins to use them on a keychain.
&gt; One person I've heard about has nailed hundreds of coins to the beams
&gt; of his house as decoration, matching the color of the nail to the
&gt; metal of the coin. No doubt coins have been holed for other purposes
&gt; as well.

&gt; Sometimes you can get a feel for what purpose the hole or holes served
&gt; by the type of coin, the type of hole, and whether there's one or more
&gt; than one, or at least narrow down the possibilities.

&gt; Regarding terminology, some people make the distinction of referring
&gt; to coins minted with holes (Chinese cash, for instance) as &quot;holed
&gt; coins&quot; while using the term &quot;pierced coins&quot; to refer to coins that
&gt; weren't designed that way.

&gt; Piercing or holing coins was more common in the 19th century than the
&gt; 20th. You see, for instance, a greater percentage of Seated coins that
&gt; were holed than more recent series.

&gt; Some people write off holed coins as junk and worthless, and dealers
&gt; regard them as culls, but there's clearly interest in them among some
&gt; collectors, and market value.

&gt; Personally, I'm nearly finished building a set of holed U.S. type
&gt; coins that I can find for under $10. I have 41, need 3. Quirky. But
&gt; fun. I'd never hole a coin myself, though, even pocket change. I also
&gt; try to add a holed specimen, when I can find one, in those series I
&gt; specialize in, from U.S. Bust dollars to ancient Thasos tetradrachms.
&gt; The contrast between holed and in tact can be visually interesting,
&gt; same as with other variations.

The only holed coins that I have ever bought are old contemporary

&gt;&gt;&gt; Holed coins are considered damaged, so their collector value is

&gt;&gt;Why is it that we coin collectors have such a phobia about such things?

&gt; Are you kidding? Folks around here spaz out at the mere mention of
&gt; even CLEANING a dirty coin! If we're going to have a collective stroke
&gt; when someone shows us a cleaned coin, it would come as no surprise to
&gt; me if we collectively exploded over a repaired coin. After all, if
&gt; cleaning can &quot;damage&quot; the fine patina and delicate surfaces that make
&gt; a coin grade what it does, how much worse is plugging a hole and
&gt; adding FAKE letters or features to &quot;restore&quot; the surface! Great stock
&gt; is placed in coins being &quot;original&quot;, with all damage, crud and patina
&gt; included. Anything less is damaged goods.

&gt;&gt;You
&gt;&gt;are correct in your observation that holed coins may fetch handsome
&gt;&gt;prices,

But could you be satisfied with say a VF Capped Bust gold eagle with a clean

this was a coin you had dreamed about since you began collecting?   I would
gladly pay $1-2,000 for a holed VG 1793 chain cent, knowing I could never
afford an undamaged one.

Maybe after 50 years of collecting, more or less on a budget, I have
developed a creeping tolerance disease.  First a carbon spot became okay.
Then a small scratch or rim nick was overlooked.  From there a gouge was
acceptable if the overall coin was sharp and priced right.  Finally (I

be something I can't resist.

I think you've touched on at least part of the issue.  We graybeards (well,
I think you are a fellow) may have been looking for something for a half
century, and all of a sudden along comes something we haven't seen in that
long, in any condition at any price, with some defect or combination of
defects.  Just going by your numbers, it appears that you value defective
coins at about 10% of an undamaged example, and that's probably about right.
The real problem is, they are seldom offered at that steep a discount.  Even
though dealers want to pay a nickel on the dollar for such, they always seem
to put a price tag of 80-90% on their holder.

This is a response to the thread.

I am going thru my accumulation (not collection)and found a 1892-O Barber Dime in fair to
poor condition it has a small drilled hole near the center of the coin.

If this fits into anybody's collection of worst coin or holed set or ?, respond here with
why you want it and I will send it to someone for the grand total of FREE.

That depends on what you mean by &quot;drilled&quot;, with the quotes, as
opposed to without the quotes, which would mean simply that they have

&gt;&gt; But could you be satisfied with say a VF Capped Bust gold eagle with a
&gt;&gt; clean hole in it at $2,000, when one without a hole might cost $20,000,
&gt;&gt; assuming this was a coin you had dreamed about since you began
&gt;&gt; collecting? I would gladly pay $1-2,000 for a holed VG 1793 chain cent,
&gt;&gt; knowing I could never afford an undamaged one.

&gt;&gt; Maybe after 50 years of collecting, more or less on a budget, I have
&gt;&gt; developed a creeping tolerance disease.  First a carbon spot became okay.
&gt;&gt; Then a small scratch or rim nick was overlooked.  From there a gouge was
&gt;&gt; acceptable if the overall coin was sharp and priced right.  Finally (I
&gt;&gt; pray), apologies are made for the occasional expensive coin with a hole
&gt;&gt; in it.  It's gotta be a big attractive coin with at least EF details,
&gt;&gt; preferably pre-1850 if US, and pre-1700 if European.  And the price has
&gt;&gt; to be something I can't resist.

&gt; I think you've touched on at least part of the issue.  We graybeards
&gt; (well, I think you are a fellow) may have been looking for something for a
&gt; half century, and all of a sudden along comes something we haven't seen in
&gt; that long, in any condition at any price, with some defect or combination
&gt; of defects.  Just going by your numbers, it appears that you value
&gt; defective coins at about 10% of an undamaged example, and that's probably
&gt; about right. The real problem is, they are seldom offered at that steep a
&gt; discount.  Even though dealers want to pay a nickel on the dollar for
&gt; such, they always seem to put a price tag of 80-90% on their holder.

I think my excitement varies with the coin.  I wouldn't think of considering
a 20th century coin with a hole in it, even a key date, unless it was at a
giveaway price.  Even then, I would consider it a novelty and not part of my
&quot;formal&quot; collection.  Some of the very early US 50¢ and $1 coins, early
gold, and 17th century thalers might appeal to me with a hole or plug if the
overall details were EF and the coin was original.  I would enjoy owning any
of these coins to the extent that a hole would not turn me off-- again, if
the price and condition were right.  There are indeed coins I would pay more
than 10% of book for a holed example.

I agree that some dealers do advertise holed coins at relatively high
prices.  I guess they must have buyers for them.  It seems that the higher
the grade, the less the coin is discounted.  I often see holed EF/AU Trade
dollars offered at half book value or more.  Stuff like holed lower grade 3¢
and 2¢, dimes and ½ dimes are still usually relegated to junk boxes.

Here's an example of a very rare coin with a hole.  It'll be interesting to
see what this ultimately brings.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Holed coins are considered damaged, so their collector value is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously decreased.  However, rare coins with a hole will fetch some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; value on the market, especially if the rest of the coin is attractive.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some collectors will bid on these, to a point, when they don't want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pay regular prices for an otherwise good looking rare coin.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For example, I would gladly pay a few bucks for a holed 1877 Indian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cent, nice looking with XF details or better.  Hmmm, how nice is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1803 cent of yours?   ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;I was part of a discussion in another online group, and the topic of holed
&gt;&gt;&gt;coins came up.  Even after a very long time in numismatics, I am still
&gt;&gt;&gt;conflicted over the issue of repaired holes.  Is it the same, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;different,
&gt;&gt;&gt;than restoring The Last Supper, a piece of Colonial furniture, or a 1957
&gt;&gt;&gt;Chevrolet?  One of the other posters contributed this link, which shows
&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; of an example of the extremely rare 1792 half disme:

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinText/HalfDisme.1.html

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why is it that we coin collectors have such a phobia about such things?

&gt;&gt; Are you kidding? Folks around here spaz out at the mere mention of
&gt;&gt; even CLEANING a dirty coin! If we're going to have a collective stroke
&gt;&gt; when someone shows us a cleaned coin, it would come as no surprise to
&gt;&gt; me if we collectively exploded over a repaired coin. After all, if
&gt;&gt; cleaning can &quot;damage&quot; the fine patina and delicate surfaces that make
&gt;&gt; a coin grade what it does, how much worse is plugging a hole and
&gt;&gt; adding FAKE letters or features to &quot;restore&quot; the surface! Great stock
&gt;&gt; is placed in coins being &quot;original&quot;, with all damage, crud and patina
&gt;&gt; included. Anything less is damaged goods.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You
&gt;&gt;&gt;are correct in your observation that holed coins may fetch handsome
&gt;&gt;&gt;prices,
&gt;&gt;&gt;but then, how liquid are they when it comes time to resell?  It seems to
&gt;&gt;&gt;me,
&gt;&gt;&gt;based on my experience and observations, that the answer would be &quot;not
&gt;&gt;&gt;very.&quot;  Anyone who gets a handsome price for a damaged coin should
&gt;&gt;&gt;attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt;it to ignorance and luck, as opposed to market trends, methinks.  On the
&gt;&gt;&gt;other hand, are we really in this for the money?

&gt;&gt; No, but monetary considerations often play into a transaction. A whole
&gt;&gt; or original coin that is undamaged should command a premium over a
&gt;&gt; damaged coin because its condition is better on the whole (even if the
&gt;&gt; actual grade is the same). A repaired coin, even if nicely plugged and
&gt;&gt; restored, is still a damaged coin, only it's been tinkered with. If
&gt;&gt; I'm going to spend a lot of money for a coin, I would want the best
&gt;&gt; example possible. I would expect to pay a lot less for a damaged or a

I rather think I said I would! If I'm in the market for a VF capped
bust $10 piece and don't have 20k to spend -- guess what coin I'm
going to spring for! I'm just saying that collectors are under no
false impression whatsoever that a repaired coin is anywhere near the
level of an undamaged example. It is still a damaged coin, and the
lowball price reflects that.

Fair enough! But I'm sure you haven't yet managed to convince yourself
