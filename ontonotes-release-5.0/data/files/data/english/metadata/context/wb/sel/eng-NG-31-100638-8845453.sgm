Voicestick used to offer a plan where you paid only for minutes used. I
got an e-mail today stating that they will begin charging $3.75/month
beginning October 1st.

Yep- end of an era!  Among the cheaper alternatives for an incoming
VoIP line now are callwithus.com (monthly rates depend on how
&quot;desirable&quot; the incoming number is,) SIPNumber.com (rural Iowa numbers
only- they live off of the usurious fees they skim from the USF by
being a &quot;rural telephone company&quot; so they actually WANT you to
receive lots of incoming calls!), OneSuite.com (doubles as a
&quot;pinless&quot; calling card,) Galaxyvoice.com (select New England numbers
only, a $25 &quot;setup fee&quot; and $2+/month in E911/USF fees) and, God help
us if Larry reads this, ;-) Skype's $3/month SkypeIn service.

You're welcome to borrow one of my two Stanaphone.com NY-area numbers
for your upcoming trip- they closed their doors to new customers, but
haven't closed any existing accounts yet!  Free incoming, $0.016
outgoing.

I see $60/year, not $36/year.

Skype-In is still more than Voicestick, and lacks some of the Voicestick

I guess $3.75/month isn't that unreasonable, you know they couldn't go
on with so many people having free numbers.

I hadn't checked prices in awhile.  I imagine the price increase was
a combination of eBay greed and the floundering dollar vs. the Euro.

While I have our own Skype expert here on the party line, let me ask
you a question if you know it off the top of your head- (rather than

this year, will my SkypeOut-to-USA Calls still be included in my
unlimited US/Canada deal, or will it use Skype credit since I'll be
connecting with a Mexican IP address?  (In other words do _I_ have to
be in the US as well?)  I have plenty of freebie VoIP accounts, but
the big advantage of Skype is it's ability to use port 80 to connect-
many tourista hotels seem to block the traditional VoIP ports to
&quot;encourage&quot; you to use the 20 peso/minute house phones!

http://www.skype.com/products/skypeout/
Skype Unlimited is only for calls ORIGINATING and TERMINATING in the USA
or Canada.  In Mexico, you pay 2.1c/min to call 30 countries, including
USA and Canada.  The 3.9c connection fee is caused by the internet
connection TO the Skype landline server's IP, just a flat rate that
covers it from any place outside USA/Canada.  Many countries charge both
parties for any call in or out.  3.9c + 2.1c/min is real cheap!
Calling a cellphone IN MEXICO costs 33.9c/min because the calling party
must also pay double-or-more for the call.  Calling from Skype TO Mexico,
outside of Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey is 9.9c/min caused by
the Mexican phone company ripoff.

You may also call skype on ANY port, not just port 80.  Simply change the
port number in your Skype before you connect to the Skype server.  It
accepts Skype connects on any port, really thrilling the cellular
bastards trying to stop you using their aircards, too!...(c;

Best way to use Skype to/from Mexico is to simply leave Skype running
back home in the office or house.  Leave Skype on your desk at the office
running on full autoanswer with your webcam on....so you can see who got
your job after you left on vacation....with color TV and full audio...(c;
You can even hear them talking about you.  I have one running 24/7 at our
Circuit City on a laptop demo unit...(c;  Did you know CC runs all the
TVs ALL NIGHT LONG?!  How stupid.  From Mexico to any other Skype on the
planet, of course, is always free, with full video conferencing and all
the toys.

Now for the trick!  Buy SKYPE IN unlimited at home, where it's cheap.
DON'T CALL YOUR HOUSE OR OFFICE!  Call your SKYPE name on Skype...which
is FREE from anyplace on the planet!  Set your SKYPE IN to FORWARD it's
Skype In calls TO YOUR HOME, THE WIFE'S CELL OR THE OFFICE PHONE!  Even
if you are OFFLINE, your call to the non-answering Skype-to-Skype
call....goes to FORWARDING!  I forward Skype In calls to my cellphone on
Alltel.  It doesn't care where you forward them to, as long as it's in
the STATES/Canada.  Your Skype call to Skype at home is free...forwards
free...calls the OFFICE, who can forward your call to anyone you like IF
you have two lines or a switchboard!  Great way around the tariffs...(c;

Larry, I know you used to be able to forward the Skype account to a US

Are you sure what you are doing doesn't depend on some other software

looking at installing an Asterisk PBX at home to do approximately
the equivalent thing.

No, it's no other software.  I may be queer to the USA system with the
unlimited service plans.  Any Skype-to-Skype calls to my username ring my
cellphone.  I have unlimited Skype in and out on the USA plans.

I have friends in AU, JP, NZ, CH, that call me that way.  Two called
today.....

I do have MobiVox ( www.mobivox.com ) but that's only so I can call them
back....which also works great from an access number in Charlotte, NC,
the closest one to Charleston.  I call the access number.  It recognizes
me by my caller ID and opens it's Skype channel.  It's voice-activated
for handsfree operation.  Puts Skype right in my Bluetooth headset...(c;

But, MobiVox is OUTbound from the cellphone to Skype (and an even cheaper
overseas long distance for the cell, 1.9c/min).  It has nothing to do
with incoming Skype In calling or Skypers calling me.  It connects to
Skype-to-Skype, but uses its own landline system.

I had the Charleston number first.  It's actually listed as Hollywood, SC,

&gt; Larry
&gt; --
&gt; Your turn...(c;

Besides E911?  ;-)

Their most interesting feature is &quot;Cellular Bridge&quot;- you enter your
cell phone number (or any phone number you want to use) on the VS site,
then when you call your VS number from that phone, you get a dialtone
and can dial an international call through your VS account- kind of
like a pinless calling card (or Mobivox, I suppose.)

They ruined the feature last month by charging $4.95/month extra for
it, though!

The ATA box they used to use could do it automatically via hardware,
without their help. &quot;Coincidentally,&quot; they changed some settings last
month, stopping those boxes from working with Voicestick, and sent us
free replacements without that particular feature, forcing us to
subscribe to the feature to get it.

On the bright side, both old and new boxes are unlocked, so I can use
them with any of my other VoIP accounts (except Skype, of course,
which isn't SIP-compliant.)

I didn't mind the end of the free incoming calls last month- that
seemed fair- they cut the price of outgoing from 2.1 to 1.1 to offset
the new 1.1-cent incoming charge.  I suspect too many people were
abusing the free incoming and using cheaper VoIPs for outgoing.  But
going from &quot;unlimited&quot; free incoming to $4/month (with no incoming or
outgoing included) in the span of 60 days is going to cause quite a
few casual users (like me) to disappear when my existing credits run
out, which I'm sure is their goal.

VoIP is just a backup for my backup (I have both a landline and
multiple cells) so VoIP is kind of a &quot;when my free-WiFi-equipped
hotel is in a Cellular dead spot&quot; kind of thing.  For as little as I
use VoIP, $0.01/month and $4/min would be cheaper than $4/month a
$0.01/minute!  I guess it's back to the rural Iowa USF-skimmers at
FreeDigits.com aka SIPNumber.com for me!

This is an illustration of the enigma that is Larry.  I'm surprised
that the same guy who thinks they faked the Moon Landing believes
Skype's line of bullshit.  The 3.9-cents fee is a &quot;because they can&quot;
fee.  If it had anything to do with &quot;costs for connecting to the
landline server's IP&quot; other VoIPs would charge a connection fee as
well, but they don't.  Landline interconnec fees are charged per
minute by local telcos- not &quot;flat rate&quot; per call.  The approx. $0.01
fee for terminating to most US/Canada phones is already included in
the $0.021/minute fee.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Compared to cellular, yes, but not as cheap as other VoIPs-
Voicestick is $0.011 for outgoing to
US/Canada, and well under 2c to many countries including the UK, with
NO connection fee.  But again, I want a backup in case VoIP ports
(5060) are blocked...  I'll just load a few bucks in the Skype credit
account before I leave, rather than re-up for unlimited again in '08.

(I've only used about 10 or 20 minutes in 2007 so far, and most of
that was for testing other VoIP accounts!  I'm just a sucker for a
good deal and couldn't pass up a year of unlimited for $15!)  I might
buy a Magicjack and end up not using it either!  ;-)

&gt;&gt; Er, ah, I'll bite....WHICH &quot;features&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Larry
&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt; Your turn...(c;

&gt; Besides E911?  ;-)

&gt; Their most interesting feature is &quot;Cellular Bridge&quot;- you enter your
&gt; cell phone number (or any phone number you want to use) on the VS site,
&gt; then when you call your VS number from that phone, you get a dialtone
&gt; and can dial an international call through your VS account- kind of
&gt; like a pinless calling card (or Mobivox, I suppose.)
">

You can do this using OneSuite or TalkLoop, and the rates are less.
However there is a $10/6 month minimum ($1.67/month) but it's not a fee
you just keep building up more credit if you don't use it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I didn't mind the end of the free incoming calls last month- that
&gt; seemed fair- they cut the price of outgoing from 2.1 to 1.1 to offset
&gt; the new 1.1-cent incoming charge.  I suspect too many people were
&gt; abusing the free incoming and using cheaper VoIPs for outgoing.  But
&gt; going from &quot;unlimited&quot; free incoming to $4/month (with no incoming or
&gt; outgoing included) in the span of 60 days is going to cause quite a
&gt; few casual users (like me) to disappear when my existing credits run
&gt; out, which I'm sure is their goal.
">

If you made a stink about it then you could get your existing credits
back as a refund since they changed the terms of service on you after
you had bought the credits.

One thing I noticed is that when my cell phone rings from a forwarded
VoiceStick number it no longer CallerIDs the VoiceStick number like it
used to.

Oh well, Voicestick was good while it lasted.

Agreed, but I've had a few SIP incompatibility quirks with them since
day one.  I can't get the built-in Windows Mobile 6 VoIP client to
register (since their registrar server and proxy server are different)
and now they don't even support their own MG3 ATA, which allowed the
cell bridge to work through hardware (free) and allowed your landline
phone to autoswitch between incoming POTS and VStick calls, and
select either for outgoing via the &quot;*&quot; key.  The replacement ATA they
sent is a Bottom of the line Grandstream 286 which has neither
function.

Losing those two features makes any number of cheaper alternatives,
like OneSuite VoIP ($2.95/month, with free incoming) as good or better.

I might try the OneSuite VoIP and see if it plays nice with
my WinMo VoIP client.  (The WinMo client is integrated with the
regular phone app, so if Wi-Fi is on, calls to my VoIP line ring in
just like a regular cell call, except it has my VoIP's name where the
carrier's name is usually displayed.)

Nahh, I have less than $10 on it- given the relative shakiness of VoIP
providers I wouldn't pile too much money into a pay-as-you-go one!

While VS is offering refunds, they're also willing to convert your
account to an outgoing-only to avoid the fees.  I e-mailed them last
night to accept that option.  Never know when you might need another
backup VoIP!  ;-)

Plus, I'm wondering if I can forward a different VoIP call to the SIP
URI of the new VS account number they end up assigning me.

I asked our 911 operators if there was a local phone number I could call
to accesss their terminal...without the GPS pinpoint, of course.  There
is.  It's programmed into my Skype phones at home.  I'll tell 'em my
address when I call.  Problem solved.

Yes, MobiVox.  You call it from any telephone.  If &quot;she&quot; (voice prompter
is female, Canadian accent) doesn't recognize your caller ID, you just
say your username/password when she asks.  From the pre-loaded phone, the
caller ID bypasses this request and opens your account automatically so
you can use your Skype contact list, which in Skype is server-stored, not
phone-stored, eliminating the need to duplicate it.  Too bad cellular
isn't smart enough to do this so when your phone fails or you get a new
phone, your phone book isn't destroyed or requires copying.  Cellular's
still dumb.

With your international calls already pre-stored in the contact list,
whether landline or Skype-to-Skype, you simply say, &quot;Call Graeme Smith&quot;
into it and she dials him.  (Put another name on Graeme's Skype username
makes it easier to use than waiting for her to prompt you for his 3
different modes, Cellular/landline/Skype.)  MobiVox is cheaper than
Skype, has no monthly bogus &quot;service charge&quot; and charges up airtime just
like your Skype, with your credit card. www.mobivox.com Works great, I
was a beta tester for them.  From the cell, any of the access numbers in
the country are free LD calls only costing me airtime weekdays.  Alltel
starts free N/W at 7 on my plan.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They ruined the feature last month by charging $4.95/month extra for

I expect Mobivox to follow suit.  It's an industry trend.  They all
usually follow-the-leader.

No &quot;boxes&quot; on Skype, of course.  I call on the computers or laptop or my
Netgear SPH101 Skype Phone, depending on whether I want to transfer files
and have TV or not.  Too bad Netgear or someone doesn't upgrade the Skype
phone to included a little vidcam and a web browser so I can use it at
lots of remote locations that require webpage spamming to logon free,
that the Skype Phone cannot connect to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the bright side, both old and new boxes are unlocked, so I can use
&gt; them with any of my other VoIP accounts (except Skype, of course,

Skype won't be SIP-compliant because it would hobble up their excellent

AS it doesn't cost any internet VoIP carrier more than a few bytes of
disk space to continue your account, I doubt they care about trying to
get rid of you.  The account numbers make borrowing money from the money
changers much easier, so they want lots of accounts, if for no other
reason.

&gt; VoIP is just a backup for my backup (I have both a landline and
&gt; multiple cells) so VoIP is kind of a &quot;when my free-WiFi-equipped
&gt; hotel is in a Cellular dead spot&quot; kind of thing.  For as little as I
&gt; use VoIP, $0.01/month and $4/min would be cheaper than $4/month a
&gt; $0.01/minute!  I guess it's back to the rural Iowa USF-skimmers at
&gt; FreeDigits.com aka SIPNumber.com for me!
">

There's no reason to have a landline any more.  I dumped Bell$not in
1992.  One of life's greatest pleasures was asking them to take their
wires off my home, after being their slave since I was a teenager.  It's
a feeley-good kinda feeling..(c;  Message delivered!

I don't need the Skype, either, but have lots of international friends so
would miss our chats without it.  I'm online with it at home, but it's
only a way to bypass cellular's stupid by-the-second charges, a throwback
to an older time.

I'm retiring Jan 2008, but haven't decided to close my little music
business or not.  If I close the business, I no longer need full contact
on-the-road, other than free 911 service from the bagphones in my cars,
so will probably just dump cellular's price gouging and keep Skype.
Without the business, I can easily pop the Netgear wifi phone into my
pocket, instead, and let it logon to whatever it finds open to get my
Skype voicemails...which it does, automatically, when it connects to
Skype's server.  That will be plenty of phone service for me in
retirement...(c;  All my fav restaurants either have free wifi or are
next to a hotel with free wifi.  There's free wifi in the malls, The City
of Charleston provides 110Kbps free wifi downtown all over and the
marinas where my friends' boats are located all have amazing bandwidth
for free with repeaters across the marinas, a feature the affluent
yachtsmen now expect for $100-200/day transient dock rent.  The only
place the Skype phone doesn't work is on the road, which I won't care
about cruising around on my motorcycle.

No, I was saying $5/month is hardly &quot;greedy&quot; by Ebay....

&gt; year of unlimited In/Out for the first yesr, and $20 for additional
&gt; years...  ...if they're around that long!)
">

Prices have risen ONCE, not steadily.  I doubt the littler guys like this
Magicjack you talk about will dent Skype's user base.  Most Skype users I
know don't pay a dime.  They only use Skype-to-Skype and all the other
free toys Skype's computer-based, no boxes system enjoys.  It costs them
nothing for worldwide communications with full motion video,
conferencing, live Skypecasting, and I think this will continue.  Ebay
bought Skype not as a replacement business, but to connect Ebay's seller
with Ebay's buyers, which before Skype was more expensive than the
products from many places on the planet.  I think Ebay will continue to
offer really cheap phone service to keep these people, who make Ebay's
real money stream, connected to each other.  I think for this purpose,
you're going to see Ebay EXPAND any Skype service that supports Ebay's
business model.  Case in point....I think Ebay will, soon, institute LIVE
BIDDING using Skype's Skypecast function.  Bidders will be able to get
instant gratification they love, especially Americans who demand it, with
LIVE auctions in living color talking to a huge cyber room full of
bidders.  The seller will be the moderator, a sort of Christie's Video
Auction, controlling who has access and who doesn't.  The seller will
webcam, not picture, the product and can answer bidders' questions for
all LIVE, in realtime, with full motion color video for anyone who
connects to see and hear and those wishing to bid having full access to
the full-duplex audio bidding it just as if you're sitting in a chair at
Christie's with your little numbered paddle in your hands....in a less
expensive sort of way.

You want a new car?  Go to Ebay Motors, click the Skypecast link on the
car you're interested in.  The Skypecast schedule for this car pops up if
the auction isn't yet open.  Your Skype will automatically connect to the
car's Skypecast at the appropriate time making a noise to alert you to
the computer.  All the bidders will be able to view the car, HEAR IT
RUNNING, ask live questions of the seller, make a deal LIVE and the
bidding will take 10 minutes, not 5 days of texting and webpaging.  Ebay
will make a fortune as thousands more live auctions will take place in
the time hundreds are taking place, now.....see?

Ebay isn't going to shoot their corporate foot off by making Skype
expensive if this live Skypecasting catches on.  It will be free-for-all
indefinately to get anyone interested in that car, not a phone company,
to download and BID!  What Skype makes only needs to break even or make a
small profit.....because it's NOT Ebay's main business, only a service to
that business model.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; http://www.skype.com/products/skypeout/
&gt;&gt; Skype Unlimited is only for calls ORIGINATING and TERMINATING in
&gt;&gt; the USA
&gt;&gt; or Canada.  In Mexico, you pay 2.1c/min to call 30 countries,
&gt;&gt; including
&gt;&gt; USA and Canada.  The 3.9c connection fee is caused by the internet
&gt;&gt; connection TO the Skype landline server's IP, just a flat rate that
&gt;&gt; covers it from any place outside USA/Canada.

&gt; This is an illustration of the enigma that is Larry.  I'm surprised
&gt; that the same guy who thinks they faked the Moon Landing believes
&gt; Skype's line of bullshit.  The 3.9-cents fee is a &quot;because they can&quot;
&gt; fee.  If it had anything to do with &quot;costs for connecting to the
&gt; landline server's IP&quot; other VoIPs would charge a connection fee as
&gt; well, but they don't.  Landline interconnec fees are charged per
&gt; minute by local telcos- not &quot;flat rate&quot; per call.  The approx. $0.01
&gt; fee for terminating to most US/Canada phones is already included in
&gt; the $0.021/minute fee.
">

I have hardly ever paid for any connect fee.  That's not what Skype is
for, anyways, it's just a Skype convenience.  I did call Mahmood in
Bahrain on his cellphone, once, just to see how it worked.  It worked
great, even at 33c/min...plus 3.9 cents.  Mahmood and I never used Skype-
to-Bahraini-Phones before because we talk for hours for free from his
Skype to my Skype....sort of negating your attack, wouldn't you say?

I wouldn't care if the connect fee were $2/call as I rarely make it.  The
blankey $30/year Skype Out deal for US/Canada covers everything.  I do
make LOTS of LONG calls on that $30....which buys about one month and 700
minutes on Alltel.  So, I don't care what the overseas interconnect rate
of just 4cents/call is.  If it doubles, I'll drink one less cup of coffee
in 2008 and turn a profit.  Your complaint is kinda picking-at-straws
compared to any cellular carrier's charges to call anywhere.  If you want
to piss at someone, piss at Verizon for charging you $1.50/minute!

&gt;&gt;  Many countries charge both

&gt; Compared to cellular, yes, but not as cheap as other VoIPs-
&gt; Voicestick is $0.011 for outgoing to
&gt; US/Canada, and well under 2c to many countries including the UK, with
&gt; NO connection fee.  But again, I want a backup in case VoIP ports
&gt; (5060) are blocked...  I'll just load a few bucks in the Skype credit
&gt; account before I leave, rather than re-up for unlimited again in '08.

&gt; (I've only used about 10 or 20 minutes in 2007 so far, and most of

Again, your focus is on calling cellphones and landlines, which is a
Skype secondary feature to the FREE Skype-to-Skype communications those
services don't offer, I don't think.  Can I call your Voicestick free
from my Voicestick, direct, with full motion color video and no time
limit?  No?  It's a different system with a different model.  95% of my
Skype calls are to other Skypers, many of whom I've gotten on Skype and
ruined their lives.  It spreads like a virus!

&quot;Hey, Mike, download Skype for free and call me from your computer.&quot;
I've just infected Mike's life with a terrible virus.  Mike calls his
father and gets Skype installed on Dad's computer so they can talk for
free.  Mike's two sisters and brother find out they can get Skype for
free and call Mom and Dad...the virus spreads.  Dad notices Skype Out and
feeds Skype $10 for 7 hours of interconnect, all the money he spent on
Skype.  He didn't buy a &quot;box&quot;, he probably spent a fortune on that custom
USB headset/mic from Best Buy because Mom didn't like the crap he had.
Now, Mom wants her OWN computer because she told the girls in her garden
club about Skype's conferencing...the virus has spread across Hometown,
KS, and it's MY fault.  All I wanted to do was talk to Mike for free
whenever he was online, instead of messaging him or email.  Geez, Mike
has two new Skype In numbers, now.  One in Orlando, where he lives and
one in Hometown, KS, his home town so his old buddies can just dial his
LOCAL number!  He's out $120!  NO MIKE, NO, NO!! .......too late...my

spread out the load on the whole system and provide redundancy, they
can't even trace you to the Skype equivalent of a DNS...(c;  Now, add

Yeah, that's actualy a disadvantage- ATAs are optional in SIP-based
services.  They allow you to hook POTS phones to VoIP without a

Skype, but ATAs allow your POTS wiring to interface directly with
your DSL/Cable modem or router directly with no PC or software running.

Despite your lousy experience with that defective Dell Axim you

That's a personal choice.  Reliability, quality, and frankly 100%

Trust me- I'm not knocking Skype, VoIP or cellular- competition keeps

Just food for thought- American Roaming Network now offers a prepaid

$2.95/min or whatever they charge for credit card calls, and it's
convenient to be able to call a tow-truck or taxi or whatever in
addition to 911!

Yep- but another Benifit to Fring is that it will let you make Skype

Again, my PPC phone is slower than most- when I bought it a 18 months
ago, T-Mo and Cingular were hustling 200MHz models, while Verizon and
Sprint sold 400MHz units that work much better for Skype.

If I'm desperate to run Skype, I have a batch file on the device that
overclocks itto 230MHz then runs Skype.  That works fine, but so does
Fring, without the overclocking.  The neat thing about Fring is it
runs muliple VoIPs at once, so I can receive calls from both Skype
and a SIP account with a phone number (I don't have a Skype-In
number,) and place outgoing calls from either with only one app
running.

I shouldn't have looked at the internet this week.  Nokia's N800 has been
a want of mine for some time, free of the cellular control BS turning off
functions, BUT connectable with its Bluetooth interface to a cellphone's
data port.  This thread has revived my want of the Linux-based N800.
http://www.nseries.com/index.html#l=campaigns,n800,skype
It's now the browser-enabled Skype phone I've been waiting for.  Unlike
the Netgear I have, that has no browser, it will logon to all the
webpage-based internet hotspots I had to carry the laptop Skype to
access.  This is no longer necessary.  It never had Skype before but now
it does, making it most attractive at around $350, no strings attached.
It's a beautiful piece of work that's much more functional, for me, than
a PDA or smartphone all hobbled up by some cellular bastards.  I can
still use their system through its BT interface to the cellphone's data
port, if I must, and the carrier doesn't have access to it to shut down
its functions, which I think is a real important feature.  It has stereo
speakers and a mic for Skype speakerphone plus the little webcam pops
right out of the side of it for full motion Skype video with anyone on
the planet...not important but great fun.  &quot;Hi there!  As you can see,
we're in downtown Atlanta at XXXXXX.  This is Jennifer.&quot;  Ok, so I'm
dreaming...(c;

I've been reading about Nokia's next model to come out next year with the
slideout keyboard, instead of the touchscreen, with WiMax, probably from
Sprint.  But, if I wait for that one, I'm going back to carrier hobbled
BS &quot;they&quot; control, back to the same old grind....a device made not to
give the best service, but to generate the best revenue for someone
else's pocket.  The more I think about that, the more open my wallet
becomes.  The price for it has only dropped $50 since its inception,
another indication of its usefulness.  The buyers seem to love them,
especially the geeks like me.

The other feature N800 has is Maemo.org.  It is, after all, an open
source Linux box the hackers think is, at the moment, really neat.  This
shows by visiting Maemo and looking at the array of free software that
runs on it.  These guys look like:
http://picasaweb.google.com/thoughtfix/NokiaNseriesUnlockedSept272007
They're also the hackers unlocking the Nseries phones from carrier's
clutches, an unnecessary move on the N800 on wifi/BT.
There's lots of blogs:
http://tabletblog.com/
http://www.ultramobilegeek.com/
And there's more new software being ported to it or written for it each
week:
http://maemo.org/downloads/
They keep coming out with new codecs for things it was never designed to
play.  Its Mplayer works with them.  It now plays OGG, DivX, etc., lots
of stuff I already have thousands of.  Supports all MPx formats, even
Realvideo/Realaudio so I can listen to BBC's radio channels on it.  It
has an FM radio for the local stations.  It also has speakers, but they
sound like a laptop.  Ok for voice on Skype, but not 80's rock.

It isn't a PDA.  I have a PDA but am retiring, so I'll not need its
business functions any more.  I'd rather have the Opera flash-enabled web
browser that accepts plugins and actually shows most all the webpages.

I think you're being unfair.  From what I understand from reading the
trades, Sprint wants to go to an unlocked/unsubsidized sales model
for WiMax- you'd buy a WiMax card or WiMax-enabled device and
subscribe to whatever service you wish.  (Generous of them of course,
since they'll likely be the only one for a few years!) ;-)

If you really can't wait, I'd have to believe WiMax cards will come
in all the popular formats (PCMCIA, USB, SDIO, etc.) so you'll likely
be able to retrofit the 800 later.

I don't think the 770 is Linux-based.  That, and its obsolescense in the
near term, would eliminate it for me.  The N800, on the other hand, has
been accepted by the hacker community, as indicated by the vast webpages
devoted to its open architecture.  This would keep the N800 running way
past the time Nokia wishes you would trash it for something new.  Case in
point would be the old Archos Jukebox Studio MP3 players, the first hard
drive players, kept alive even today by the Rockbox hackers taking over
its operating system.  I still use one running on Rockbox's latest beta
version.

I think I'm going to order it.  It's been out long enough to have a
stable OS and already has lots of great Linux applications ported to it
by the hackers.  I'm afraid we won't be able to get it to run them if the
WiMax version follows suit being &quot;carrier-controlled&quot; and have features
deleted or disabled.  Case in point for that view is the new release of
iPhone's bug fixes.  It severely punishes anyone caught installing it on
a hacked iPhone, I'm told, securing up the holes the hacks are causing so
you can't unlock it, again, maybe.  Being able to hack it, of course, was
one of its design flaws in the usual MAC business model.

hee hee.  Best Buy has become and Apple dealer, sans iPhone of course.
When I asked the MAC lover BB has installed to run the department where
the MAC software section was, he pointed me to this little half shelf
next to the big black Apple box.  What I don't understand is there were
lots of tags in front of empty shelves.  I wouldn't think MAC would be
playing hold-back games with MAC software.  He was very quick to remind
me the new MACs were Intel machines that would run WinXP/Vista? software.
I was very quick to remind him the MAC was priced $2000 more than a
Windows box that also ran all that Windows software....faster....cheaper.
This terminated my customer service experience at the MAC counter...(c;

You're forgetting that Sprint originally launched as a carrier with
unsubsidize
phones and no contracts.  Only when they realized the market
PREFERRED &quot;free phones&quot; with contract to a unsubsidized one.

Sprint seems to be trying again with their original &quot;mission&quot;-
selling service based on quality of service, rather than by
handcuffing you to it with a contract!

Except in those days, everyone expected to pay roaming fees on Bubba.
The advent to nationwide no-roaming fee plans necessitated building

Again, we can grouse about it all we want, but we wanted it and asked

And even THEN, you could still get service with no contract with a $10
