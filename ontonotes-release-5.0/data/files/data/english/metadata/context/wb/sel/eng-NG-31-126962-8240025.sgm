&quot;Words are thoughts.

&quot;The better we choose our words, the more we hone our thinking machine,
and just like software, it's a case of GIGO: Garbage In, Garbage Out.
Thinking hard is pointless if we don't use the right tools.

&quot;Think and speak with precision. Less is often more. Here are 10 common
words I have observed to cause stress, depression, and conflict due to
their vagueness. All of them are overused to the point of being
meaningless. The solution? Stop using them and find more descriptive
alternatives. I recommend focusing on removing one or two each week,
even if just as an exercise.

&quot;In no particular order…

1. Happiness
2. Success
3. Should
4. Responsible
5. Realistic
6. Reasonable
7. Spiritual
8. Good/Right
9. Bad/Wrong
10. Moral

&quot;Do you love some of these? Most of us do. But… try and define them
without using an equally vague synonym or a tautology.

&quot;But why do we love them?

Because they remove the heavy lifting of real thinking. These
socially-accepted throwaway terms are crutches for unclear thinking,
just like 'thing', 'stuff', or 'interesting' –- enemies of good writers
worldwide.&quot;

I think it is rather foolish to try and give readers
the idea there is anything wrong with these
words when they are used by fine writers
regularly.   I am confident we could find examples
of their use in the current issue of magazines
such as &quot;Harpers&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;
and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, as a matter of fact.

No necessarily.   I agree that often the words you

let us not blame the words themselves for that.

if Tim were a responsible writer, and he truly cared whether anyone
else ever acheived happiness and success as a writer he should have
been far more responsible and realistic

for instance, the spiritual significance of choosing not to use words
like good, right,
bad, and wrong show a lack of moral courage.

there is no list of words and stuff that any writer should avoid.

because you are posting on the net, Towse?    At the
risk of insulting anyone's intelligence, I will simply remind
you that when giving a lengthy quotation it is helpful  (and
customary) at the beginning of the quote to tell readers
whom you are quoting.   Do you wish to stir up thinking
on a topic or do you simply want to play &quot;Who is the

Tell me why a person should ever use &quot;eponymous&quot; or &quot;ne plus ultra,&quot;
the only purpose of which is to draw attention to your very own
vocabulariscious self.

Daniel 7-8: I was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a
little one, coming up among them, before whom three of the first horns
were plucked out by the roots. And there, in this horn, were eyes like
the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking pompous words.

I don't think &quot;eponymous&quot; is a particularly obscure word. Never knew
what he fuck it meant, but still. &quot;Ne plus ultra&quot; also seems to me
fairly commonplace. If anything, it's a cliche.

Anyway, I was about to say pretense never, best word for the job
always -- whether long or short -- but then it occurred to me that
even that is too restrictive. There are after all times when pretense
is called for, or at least traditional-- wedding announcements, legal
documents, constitutions and declarations.

Then too, different eras have different notions about these things.
The written language of 150 years ago was flower and ornate. It
gloried in polysyllables. A few years later, a great reversal had
begun: sentences grew shorter, word choices simpler, sentence
structure closer to the burps and wheezes of actual speech. We live
with the consequences of that change. But are we better for it? &quot;Four
score and twenty years ago&quot; is about as pretentious as a phrase can be
without risking the guillotine, but it sure do work good. So, at the
opposite extreme, does Hemingway. But does anyone think those modern
translations of the Bible match the majesty of the KJV?

It's not that it's obscure. It's that it calls attention to itself and
in so doing distracts from more meaningful stuff:

&quot;This test was invented in 1897 by the Polish doctor Edmund Biernacki.
[1] In 1918 the Swedish pathologist Robert Sanno Fåhræus declared the
same and along with Alf Vilhelm Albertsson Westergren are eponymously
remembered for the Fåhræus-Westergren test (in the UK, usually termed
Westergren test),[2] which uses sodium citrate-anticoagulated
specimens.[3 &quot;. . .

The word invites people to write sentences like that.

I mean, do you really care to know this much about the naming of the
erythrocyte sedimentation rate test?

Wouldn't it be better to say &quot;The Fahraeus-Westergren test for
erythrocyte sedimentation rates was really invented by a guy named
Biernacki, but folks never want to give a Polish guy credit when they
can say a Swede did it--or better yet, two of 'em,&quot; which at least
acknowledges that the history of science is full of treachery, ego,
nationalism, misplaced credit, and possibly deceit--which if you ask
me is far more interesting and might even make it possible to remember
the names if you had to for an exam.

Academic papers usually attempt to adopt a tone of objectivity, to
transcend as much as possible the confounding primitivism of instinct.

but our willingness to accept that unnatural dryness has I think been
part of the remarkable scientific and material progress that we've

There is, thank god, a lot of good prose between academic papers and
rude text messaging.

I think you are romantic about academic prose. It must have been a
linguist who claimed that the norms were developed to &quot;confound the
primitivism of instinct.&quot; I think scientists aim, but don't always
succeed, to avoid imprecision and connotations, which are sort of like
uncontrolled variables. The effect might be the same, but there's less
value judgment in the intent.
