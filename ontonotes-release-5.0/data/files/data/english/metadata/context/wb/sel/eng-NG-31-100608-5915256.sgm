Krauthammer Strikes Again -- Successfully.

Well-Informed &amp; Nicely Put.

There Is No Substitute For Victory.

Vide infra pro sapientia.

Densely Populated with HISTORIAL FACTS -- not just half-arsed "feelings",
carefully culled and cherry-picked factoids -- and unproven assertions --
mixed in an amalgam of disingenuous "filler" as Pogue Gans The Meek And
Silent In October is so fond of doing.

Enjoy!

"How important is Iraq in this calculus?  The vaunted National Intelligence
Estimate -- unspun -- offers a completely commonplace weighing of the
relationship between terrorism and Iraq.

On the one hand, the American presence does inspire some to join the
worldwide jihad.  On the other hand, success in the Iraq project would blunt
the most fundamental enlistment tool for terrorism -- the political
oppression in Arab lands that is deflected by cynical dictators and radical
imams into murderous hatred of the West.

Which is why the Bush democracy project embodies the greatest hope for a
reduction of terrorism and why the NIE itself concludes that were the
jihadists to fail in Iraq, their numbers would diminish.

Bingo! -- DSH

It is an issue of time frame. The bombing of the Japanese home islands may
have increased short-term recruiting for the kamikazes.  But success in the
Pacific war put a definitive end to the whole affair.

Bingo!  Which also makes hash of the argument that we should not have bombed
the Japanese Home Islands [and actually invaded some of the close-in
Japanese Islands, such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa] for fear of producing more
kamikaze suicide bombers. -- DSH

Moreover, does anyone imagine that had the jihadists in Iraq remained home
they would now be tending petunias rather than plotting terror attacks?

Omar al-Farouq, leader of al-Qaeda in Southeast Asia, escaped from a U.S.
prison in Afghanistan a year ago and was apparently drawn to the "cause
celebre" in Iraq.  Last month he was killed by British troops in a firefight
in Basra.

In an audiotape released Sept. 28, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq said that
more than 4,000 of its recruits have been killed there since the American
invasion.  Like Omar al-Farouq and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, they went to Iraq
to die in Iraq.

Precisely!  Where we can kill them on their own turf rather than OURS in the
United States and Britain, where the collateral  damage would be MUCH
GREATER. -- DSH

It is clear that one of the reasons we have gone an astonishing five years
without a second attack on the American homeland is that the most dedicated
and virulent jihadists have gone to Iraq to fight us, as was said during
World War I, "over there."

Bingo!  Just as many American and British Communists were killed safely in
Spain rather than laboriously rooted out at home -- as fortuitously happened
during the Spanish Civil War -- 1936-1939. -- DSH

Does the war in Iraq make us more or less safe today?  And what about
tomorrow?  The fact is that no definitive answer is possible.  Except for
the following truism: During all wars we are by definition less safe -- and
the surest way back to safety is victory."

false analogy. kamakazies were a last ditch weapon,  the al qaeda is just

If you feel so strongly about the neccesity to win in Iraq, then tell us how
to do it - obviously the Bush regime doesn't know how.

What we are doing now is slowly losing. I think you and the other Bushies
have no concept or feel for warfare. It is by nature a process of extreme
violence. Instead we are doing light sparring with these people. Just enough
to anger and TRAIN them - not enough to destroy or shock them into
passivity.

In case you don't know it, al Qaeda, and terrorism in general, are now
entrenched in Iraq. Increasing numbers of people who were not enemies of the
US, are now our enemies and now have OJT (on the job training) in terrorist
activities.

If you took your car in to be fixed, and the garage gave it back to you
worse than it was, along with a huge bill, would you go back to the same
place for more work?

The issue is whether attacking Iraq is "doing something" about
terrorism, or possibly making it worse.

One thing should be clear to all...the answer is not to cut and run.  I am

We are dealing with an enemy that won't negotiate, wont capitulate, and
wants to die.

Well, there's a chance that may be in the works.

Senator Warner, a prominent long time Republican, not Bush/Rove offal, is
making some sharp statements regarding Iraq.

James Baker, another prominent long time Republican, also not Bush/Rove
offal, is doing some sort of "study" on Iraq, with recommendations to
follow.

Hopefully, the November elections will largely destroy Bush politically, and
the remaining worthwhile elements of the Republican party will have a little
talk with the pile of shit in the White house about how things need to
change.

Since the pile of shit didn't start building new ground divisions a few
years ago, like he obviously should have, we may have some limitations on
what we can do. Meanwhile: Afghanistan; Iran; N. Korea; and who knows what
else.

Or, another valid question...it we cut and run, how many lives will that
cost when they attack us again?

As I said, it is a no-win situation.

I would stay the course...the soldiers (myself included), sailors, airmen
and marines know what the odds are, and are willing to accept them.

I'll leave you with one last thought...you know that I served in Iraq.
Those of us that have been there know that we do more good than harm.  The
sad truth is that the reporters don't cover the good things that
happen...they would rather focus on the bad.

Bush never defined victory. Freedom, 'building democracy' are just slogans.

Building a 'Vatican' size embassy, numerous permanent military bases,
and putting up Iraq for sale, are facts.

One must be a soft brained, or cynical American not to see or want to
see, what Bush wants to do. That's why Iraq is a mess.

Here is my idea. I posted already a few times. But I got no substantive
response.

"The President should address the people of Iraq and announce;

*  We have no intention to force on Iraq a neo liberal  economy. Thereby
we encourage you, the Iraqi people to rescind  Bremers, the proconsul
during the occupation, illegal orders (flat tax, 100% repatriation of
profit by foreigners, etc.). Furthermore, we stop building a 'Vatican'
size embassy.

* We do not want permanent military  bases  in Iraq. Thereby, we stop
building them.

* We do not want to 'steal' your oil. Thereby, we pull out our personal
from your oil ministry. You are free to sell your oil to the ones who
gives you the best deal.

All of that would take care of the justified suspicion of the Iraqis,
and diminish resistance to the occupation.

* We have the intention to leave Iraq as soon as possible. If you
restore security, we'll leave. And we grant you $20 billions for
rebuilding your country, with no strings attached, except ONE. Arrest or
expel all  Al Qaeda or affiliated organizations and persons.

Of course my ideas are not for World Domination or Perpetual War, Bush
would  like to have,  but it could result in a peaceful end of this
misguided adventure, the Iraq War."

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What we are doing now is slowly losing. I think you and the other Bushies
&gt; have no concept or feel for warfare. It is by nature a process of extreme
&gt; violence. Instead we are doing light sparring with these people. Just enough
&gt; to anger and TRAIN them - not enough to destroy or shock them into
&gt; passivity.

&gt; In case you don't know it, al Qaeda, and terrorism in general, are now
&gt; entrenched in Iraq. Increasing numbers of people who were not enemies of the
&gt; US, are now our enemies and now have OJT (on the job training) in terrorist
&gt; activities.

&gt; If you took your car in to be fixed, and the garage gave it back to you
&gt; worse than it was, along with a huge bill, would you go back to the same
&gt; place for more work?
">

No. But if there is only one mechanic in town and he has all the tools
to fix the car, what do you do? I'd guess you could wait for two more
years for a new mechanic, and in the mean time just walk.

&gt; ---------------------------------------------

&gt; &quot;How important is Iraq in this calculus?  The vaunted National
Intelligence
&gt; Estimate -- unspun -- offers a completely commonplace weighing of the
&gt; relationship between terrorism and Iraq.

&gt; On the one hand, the American presence does inspire some to join the
&gt; worldwide jihad.  On the other hand, success in the Iraq project would
blunt
&gt; the most fundamental enlistment tool for terrorism -- the political
&gt; oppression in Arab lands that is deflected by cynical dictators and
radical
&gt; imams into murderous hatred of the West.

&gt; Which is why the Bush democracy project embodies the greatest hope for a
&gt; reduction of terrorism and why the NIE itself concludes that were the
&gt; jihadists to fail in Iraq, their numbers would diminish.

&gt; Bingo! -- DSH

&gt; It is an issue of time frame. The bombing of the Japanese home islands may
&gt; have increased short-term recruiting for the kamikazes.  But success in
the
&gt; Pacific war put a definitive end to the whole affair.

&gt; Bingo!  Which also makes hash of the argument that we should not have
bombed
&gt; the Japanese Home Islands [and actually invaded some of the close-in
&gt; Japanese Islands, such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa] for fear of producing more
&gt; kamikaze suicide bombers. -- DSH

&gt; Moreover, does anyone imagine that had the jihadists in Iraq remained home
&gt; they would now be tending petunias rather than plotting terror attacks?

&gt; Omar al-Farouq, leader of al-Qaeda in Southeast Asia, escaped from a U.S.
&gt; prison in Afghanistan a year ago and was apparently drawn to the &quot;cause
&gt; celebre&quot; in Iraq.  Last month he was killed by British troops in a
firefight
&gt; in Basra.

&gt; In an audiotape released Sept. 28, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq said
that
&gt; more than 4,000 of its recruits have been killed there since the American
&gt; invasion.  Like Omar al-Farouq and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, they went to Iraq
&gt; to die in Iraq.

&gt; Precisely!  Where we can kill them on their own turf rather than OURS in
the
&gt; United States and Britain, where the collateral  damage would be MUCH
&gt; GREATER. -- DSH

&gt; It is clear that one of the reasons we have gone an astonishing five years
&gt; without a second attack on the American homeland is that the most
dedicated
&gt; and virulent jihadists have gone to Iraq to fight us, as was said during
&gt; World War I, &quot;over there.&quot;

&gt; Bingo!  Just as many American and British Communists were killed safely in
&gt; Spain rather than laboriously rooted out at home -- as fortuitously
happened
&gt; during the Spanish Civil War -- 1936-1939. -- DSH

&gt; Does the war in Iraq make us more or less safe today?  And what about
&gt; tomorrow?  The fact is that no definitive answer is possible.  Except for
&gt; the following truism: During all wars we are by definition less safe --
and
&gt; the surest way back to safety is victory.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; giving the new Iraqi government a deadline to take charge of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *their* country.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can understand your feelings, but it would only be seen as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; sign of weakness, and we would suffer for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bobby
&gt;&gt; Bush's incompetent puppet government can no more govern Iraq than
&gt;&gt; Bush can flap his wings and fly.

&gt; And no more than you can make a coherent, applicable response.

&gt; Your little turds of ignorance are of no use here.  If you cannot
&gt; contribute to the thread in an adult manner, you shouldn't contribute
&gt; at all.

&gt; Now go play with your barbie dolls.

Bush engaged in self delusion, authoritarianism and every kind of
violation of domestic and international law to bring on this war.

Having made an appalling hash of it, he is now busily trying to spread
the blame

He is simply reinforcing failure at the cost of American lives.

I know that those who serve do lots of good.  And, as for what reporters
cover?  Yes, it's not usually the feel-good stories; it's hardcore news.
Obviously the slaughter, suicide bombs, and destruction is news in Iraq will
be the focus, just as much as suicide bombs, sectarian violence, etc. in
Montreal or Los Angeles and which would be way more newsworthy than a new
hospital being built in South Dakota.

&gt;&gt; If you feel so strongly about the neccesity to win in Iraq, then tell us

&gt; Here is my idea. I posted already a few times. But I got no substantive
&gt; response.

&gt; &quot;The President should address the people of Iraq and announce;

&gt; *  We have no intention to force on Iraq a neo liberal  economy. Thereby
&gt; we encourage you, the Iraqi people to rescind  Bremers, the proconsul
&gt; during the occupation, illegal orders (flat tax, 100% repatriation of
&gt; profit by foreigners, etc.). Furthermore, we stop building a 'Vatican'
&gt; size embassy.

&gt; * We do not want permanent military  bases  in Iraq. Thereby, we stop
&gt; building them.

&gt; * We do not want to 'steal' your oil. Thereby, we pull out our personal
&gt; from your oil ministry. You are free to sell your oil to the ones who
&gt; gives you the best deal.

&gt; All of that would take care of the justified suspicion of the Iraqis, and
&gt; diminish resistance to the occupation.

&gt; * We have the intention to leave Iraq as soon as possible. If you restore
&gt; security, we'll leave. And we grant you $20 billions for rebuilding your
&gt; country, with no strings attached, except ONE. Arrest or expel all  Al
&gt; Qaeda or affiliated organizations and persons.

&gt; Of course my ideas are not for World Domination or Perpetual War, Bush
&gt; would  like to have,  but it could result in a peaceful end of this
&gt; misguided adventure, the Iraq War.&quot;
">

Most of the Iraqis, in or out of government, barely know any of the things
you mention exist. Most of them, at all levels, are probably consumed with
getting through each day without their loved ones or themselves being killed
or maimed.

The main conflict in Iraq was entirely predictable: Sunni Arabs versus Shia
Arabs. It has a religious sectarian element, but far outweighing that, is an
economic element. The Sunni Arab's main geographic area has very little oil
reserves; the Shias have a great deal of it.

The Shias were subjugated by the Sunnis for centuries and the Sunnis know
that the best they can hope for from the Shias is to be left to slowly die
on the economic vine.

That situation offered post invasion possibilites to the US to serve as the
Sunni's advocate, and to "middleman" guide (or manipulate) events and power
sharing in post Saddam Iraq.

However, the US has someone in the White House who was put there BECAUSE he
is intellectually inadequate, and could be manipulated by people with all
sorts of right wing and pro Israel agendas, mixed in with rapture
fantacists.

And here we are.

&gt;Bush never defined victory. Freedom, 'building democracy' are just slogans.

&gt;Building a 'Vatican' size embassy, numerous permanent military bases,

If you think you know what Bush wants to do, please explain it to
him. His lack of clear objectives is probably the most serious of
our problems.

We're fumbling around, if we keep it up the public will get
frustrated and we'll have to leave. Of course, if we keep
fumbling around, we might as well leave. All that does is waste
treasure and lives.

There's been a perceptible change in the reportage here
(especially the CBC) over the past few months. It disturbs me.

Densely Populated with HISTORICAL FACTS -- not just half-arsed "feelings",
carefully culled and cherry-picked factoids -- and unproven assertions --
mixed in an amalgam of disingenuous "filler" as Pogue Gans The Meek And
Silent In October is so fond of doing.

"How important is Iraq in this calculus?  The vaunted National Intelligence
Estimate -- unspun -- offers a completely commonplace weighing of the
relationship between terrorism and Iraq.

On the one hand, the American presence does inspire some to join the
worldwide jihad.  On the other hand, success in the Iraq project would blunt
the most fundamental enlistment tool for terrorism -- the political
oppression in Arab lands that is deflected by cynical dictators and radical
imams into murderous hatred of the West.

Which is why the Bush democracy project embodies the greatest hope for a
reduction of terrorism and why the NIE itself concludes that were the
jihadists to fail in Iraq, their numbers would diminish.

Bingo! -- DSH

It is an issue of time frame. The bombing of the Japanese home islands may
have increased short-term recruiting for the kamikazes.  But success in the
Pacific war put a definitive end to the whole affair.

Bingo!  Which also makes hash of the argument that we should not have bombed
the Japanese Home Islands [and actually invaded some of the close-in
Japanese Islands, such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa] for fear of producing more
kamikaze suicide bombers. -- DSH

Moreover, does anyone imagine that had the jihadists in Iraq remained home
they would now be tending petunias rather than plotting terror attacks?

Omar al-Farouq, leader of al-Qaeda in Southeast Asia, escaped from a U.S.
prison in Afghanistan a year ago and was apparently drawn to the "cause
celebre" in Iraq.  Last month he was killed by British troops in a firefight
in Basra.

In an audiotape released Sept. 28, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq said that
more than 4,000 of its recruits have been killed there since the American
invasion.  Like Omar al-Farouq and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, they went to Iraq
to die in Iraq.

Precisely!  Where we can kill them on their own turf rather than OURS in the
United States and Britain, where the collateral  damage would be MUCH
GREATER. -- DSH

It is clear that one of the reasons we have gone an astonishing five years
without a second attack on the American homeland is that the most dedicated
and virulent jihadists have gone to Iraq to fight us, as was said during
World War I, "over there."

Bingo!  Just as many American and British Communists were killed safely in
Spain rather than laboriously rooted out at home -- as fortuitously happened
during the Spanish Civil War -- 1936-1939. -- DSH

Does the war in Iraq make us more or less safe today?  And what about
tomorrow?  The fact is that no definitive answer is possible.  Except for
the following truism: During all wars we are by definition less safe -- and
the surest way back to safety is victory."
