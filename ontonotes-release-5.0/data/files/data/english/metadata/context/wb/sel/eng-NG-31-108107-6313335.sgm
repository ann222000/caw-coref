Jupiter is fine, I just walked in the door, she's in there eating.

They gave her a tattoo; I've never heard this mentioned on here.

I have list of 6 vets in my area that will give her a free post exam
in a couple of weeks, Ill try get her booster in the same visit.

She shed a little hair, I guess all the nervous stuff, they trimmed
her claws too.

A tattoo?? Huh?? Does it say "I love my Harley" or something like that?

How about the vet who did the surgery? Doesn't the vet who did the surgery
want to do the follow-up? Isn't the follow-up included in the cost of the
surgery? Again, I've never heard of such a thing as a surgeon who charges an
additional fee for suture removal/post-op exam.

Exactly, but they are not a regular vet clinic, all they do is low
cost spay/neuters.
Any vet on the list they gave me will do the follow up for free, so it
was in the price.

I am glad it was affordable, I can see where a vet might want 200 bux
to do the same.
I think 200 dollars is reasonable.

They told me the stitches were internal and won't need to be removed.

Jupiter is gray underneath her black hair... they shaved her belly all
over, and pretty far up her chest too...

Did I mention, or did you know, she was about 2 weeks pregnant? yeah.
For this reason, they told me.. give her about 14 days before I let
her near any males.

I guess she can still be attractive to a male?
I thought she would not have any more cycles...

I don't let either of my cats outside... they have both gotten by me a
few times.
She won't get out.

She is sleeping by the wood stove now. Thanks for asking

Makes sense, as the service they provide is to people who probably won't do
follow-up vet visits. There are stitches that dissolve in time, I think.

She won't but she probably stills smells like heat. he endocrine system will
have to catch up with the spay.

Given how fast and strong she is, I might take the extra precaution of
closing her in another room when you know you are going to, say, be bringing
things in and out, or will have the door open for any length of time.

I'm so glad you got her spayed, and I know you are too. Good job taking care
of your girlycat.

Barry  when we brought home Ka'Shay I swear she was dead.  Nothing but
touching her would get her to even move or look at us.  The next day  she
was bouncing till she ran out of energy and fell asleep  wanting to be held
and loved on.  Than after her nap  bounce some more.
Just be careful when you pick her up. If you hurt her she will let you
know and we can come visit you in the hospital

How does she seem, Barry? Shaken, mad at you, or just glad to be home? Or a

&gt;&gt; Exactly, but they are not a regular vet clinic, all they do is low
&gt;&gt; cost spay/neuters.
&gt;&gt; Any vet on the list they gave me will do the follow up for free, so it
&gt;&gt; was in the price.

&gt;&gt; I am glad it was affordable, I can see where a vet might want 200 bux
&gt;&gt; to do the same.
&gt;&gt; I think 200 dollars is reasonable.

&gt; Say What...??!!

&gt; Donk!
&gt; &lt;jaw hit the floor!!&gt;

&gt; I can't but believe it ( but do)...
&gt; I'm frankly shocked.
&gt; It costs me around $68 for a spay , but then again, they also charge
&gt; us a further $35ish dollars to see them post op too
&gt; But only $30 for people on benefit (welfare) for the spay...

&gt;&gt; They told me the stitches were internal and won't need to be removed.

&gt; sounds good. We had to take Lilly to have hers removed, but then again
&gt; it was a pyometra op.
&gt; But non of the others have ever been done internally either. I wish
&gt; that they would though

&gt;&gt; Jupiter is gray underneath her black hair... they shaved her belly all
&gt;&gt; over, and pretty far up her chest too...

&gt; Same with Lilly too,.
&gt; You have no idea how ridiculous she looked afterwards cuz she is a
&gt; Birman.
&gt; In fact we started calling her Sylvester, like Sylvester &amp; Tweety pie,
&gt; lol

&gt;&gt; Did I mention, or did you know, she was about 2 weeks pregnant? yeah.
&gt;&gt; For this reason, they told me.. give her about 14 days before I let
&gt;&gt; her near any males.

&gt; I think that you did mention something about it.
&gt; I am so glad that you got it sorted out though...
&gt; I also found that all of the boys wanted to be Lilly's best friend
&gt; when she came home too.
&gt; I was too worride to pick her up except for under the bum, &amp; just
&gt; under her fore legs

&gt; Is there a reason for this, considering that she had no uterus left..?
&gt; I separated her all the same though. the last thing that she needed
&gt; was A big hairy chap telling her beautiful she looked....
&gt; ( she already knew that one!)
&gt; Males,(tut, tut!!)

She's not mad at me
:)

She has eaten and gone potty since this morning.

She's purrring again.

Makes me glad.

So far, she's only groomed herself. Looks like the cut would itch as
it heals.

Thanks for asking

Oh, OK. If she gets out and gets picked up they can tell that the scar on
her tummy is a spay scar. Good to know if you're doing TNR. There was a
female cat in the colony I've been trapping this winter who was trapped a
couple of years ago. The vet shaved her tummy and found a scar and assumed
she was already spayed so didn't do any surgery on her. They returned her to
the colony and she has proceeded to have a number of litters since.  She
disappeared before I had a chance to trap her (she's been missing since
before Thanksgiving) and we are afraid she might have contracted FeLV and
died. We have been finding more leukemia positives back there since the
first of the year.

Dang.

Where do you "find" a colony, or patch of ferals?

Maybe I have some around here, I just haven't looked in the right
places.

Is there any such thing as a fake female scent in order to lure the
males.

There are at least 3 males that came here for Jupiter recently.

There is a vet at one of the spay clinics who does beautiful eat tipping. He
takes enough that if you are looking for it you can't miss it but the way he
shapes the cats ear you don't notice ..... unless you are looking for it.

I prefer ear tipping, because it's easier to see immediately if a cat has
been speutered.  That said, around here vets tattoo a green X on the tummy.
They are pretty large and, for short haired cats, they don't need to be
shaved to see it, so it's pretty effective.

i don't think the vets inthe UK do anything, at least I don't think
so. When i took the new dark tortie i picked up to the vets the other
day and asked if she had been spayed the vet said there was nto really
any way to tell but to assume that she had been done (she had
previously been a pet, abandoned when previous owners moved out, long
story, most cats in UK tend get spayed as a matter of course i think).

what exactly is 'ear tipping'? something like a tattoo would be good
to know if a cat was spayed, dont' know why they don't do it here.

btw the tortie cat has discovered the big green corduroy bean bag
inthe front room and decided that it is her new bed, she has been
snuggled down into it most of the evening. A far cry from the cold
outside of an empty house where she had been existing for the last
month or so on he ownsome, poor sausage
