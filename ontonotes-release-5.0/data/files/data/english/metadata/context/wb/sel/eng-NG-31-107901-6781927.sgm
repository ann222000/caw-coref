Inside design of tube is crucial. Few identical data doesn't mean
anything. In some my experiments, I found how tube differ in behave
inspite their simmilarities on datasheet.
There's no such thing compares to live experiment.

Anode material? Electrode voltage differences determine electron
collision velocity. Perhaps related to life expectancy?

Where's Alan Douglas these days I wonder.

I wondered for some time why resistors have voltage ratings. After
all, Watts is Watts, and Ohms is Ohms, and Volts is root(Watts x
Ohms). Hence if you know the power rating and the resistance value,
the max voltage is implicit.

Trouble is, max Volts are quick, and mean Watts are slow. How slow, I
don't often know: it's not always easy to find out the time period
implicit in a power rating. The maddening and meaningless "rms Watt"
demonstrates that "Watts is Watts" is not so simple to the common mind
as it was to Mr Watt.

I have also wondered about the spec sheet definition of "Class A
Amplifier". Perhaps there is some assumption about the nature of the
signal? Symmetrical, maybe, and/or above some low frequency limit,
and/or continuous? 50% duty cycle kind of thing.

So it could be that a vertical deflection valve suffers from a hostile
signal. Or perhaps it takes a couple of extra Watts to drag that dot
down the screen?

Anyway, I'm sticking with electrode materials as the basic difference
between valves with similar curves and power ratings but different max
voltages. Assuming the heater power and quality of vacuum is the same,
materials are all that's left. An electron is an electron. Ions come
in all shapes and sizes, also related to materials.

For a valve operating at the same power but a higher voltage, a very
small electrode area will have a shorter duty cycle. Nothing happens
for ages and then blat!, a particle arrives at a zillion mph.

Where *is* Alan Douglas? Have we lost another proper engineer?

One is rated for audio use, the other rated for television use.

If you used a 6CZ5 as an audio output tube (which has been done)
it would be rated as a 6973 was, and vice versa. In some cases
audio amplifiers had both numbers stamped on the schematic
or chassis.

Tube ratings are based on intended use. Generally the absolute
maximum voltage the plate can withstand isn't spec'd unless
the tube is expected to be used at that voltage, say a pulse
amplifier or HV shunt regulator.

Oh well. As you were...

Still wondering what happened to Alan Douglas. He might have given you
the kind of definitive and correct answer that you wouldn't need to
think about.

The "Design Center" rating was used prior to 1957; there after "Design
Maximum" was adopted. The ratings were developed by JEDEC & standardized by
NEMA. The definitions are pretty much identical. My guess is because of some
confusion around the word "center", the wording was changed. Prior to those,
there were "Absolute Maximum" ratings; used mostly for transmitting tubes.
This info straight out of my RC26 tube manual. Check out the 6BQ5/EL84 vs.
7189. Most commercial amps run those tubes beyond the published ratings for
the 6BQ5 / EL84 (300v) like the Dyna ST35 / Scott 222-LK48 for example;
350-375v. The 7189 has ratings for those voltages but they all seem to be
used interchangeably. From a manufacturing standpoint, I'd find it hard to
believe that there is any real difference between the 6CZ5 and 6973.
Stocking identical plates and cathodes made of different materials for each
app doesn't make alot of sense from a business standpoint. The quality of
the screen grid wire perhaps because that would be stocked in bulk reels. I
seem to remember someone writing that the 6973 tube base was made slightly
different by RCA to keep the 6973 from being substituted the the CZ; RCA
using is market clout if you will. The 6973 is highly promoted within RCA
literature. My $.02.

I would tend to believe that in a manufacturing environment like Harrison,
if there were differences in manufacturing the two tubes, the improvements
required for the 6973 would have followed right on into the CZ. Tough to bin
tubes that have a different base.

Well, if that were the case, why not change the base of the 7189 vs. 6BQ5?
Living in central New Jersey, I've known / know a lot of RCA folk from
Camden, Princeton, Somerville, through Harrison and the marketing angle
makes a great deal of sense; believe me (or them).

Tubes like the 6CG7 is the same as a 6SN7 except for lower B+ and
wattage ratings.  The innards are physically smaller, but things are
scaled either linearly, squared, cubed, or whatever the physics dictates
to get the gm, mu and Rp the same.  But the voltage ratings differ.

Voltage ratings in general came about because the higher
the anode voltage the harder the electrons hit it.
Chunks get knocked off and are drawn to oppositely
charged electrodes.

Voltage ratings of all kinds (for receiving tubes) are
life ratings, so testing would involve (expensive) life
testing.
