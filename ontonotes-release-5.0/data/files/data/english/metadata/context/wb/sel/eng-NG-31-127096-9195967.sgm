Once again Richardson is resorting to falsehood in trying to capture new readers with old nonsense - see the thread titled &quot;FitzAlan vs. Arundel&quot; in May 2002, in particular the message from Peter Stewart copied below giving Richardson several references for the surname Fitzalan used in the Tudor period before the Howard family inheited Arundel.

Previously Richardson had been pontificating that &quot;FitzAlan&quot; disappeared in favour of &quot;Arundel&quot; as early as 1302. There are other messages showing him that this was wrong: now he has pushed it back to 1313 and yet again he is hoping to get other people to do his work for him in verifying or correcting his dictat, in response to his announced studipidity of posting more individual examples that cannot establish a fixed and invariable rule for everyone across several centuries.

">

The maiden name of Mary, first wife of Thomas Howard, was presumably the
same as her father's surname, which to his contemporaries was certainly Fitzalan.

A clear proof of this can be found in the memorial inscription for her
father placed in the Fitzalan chapel at Arundel by Mary's
brother-in-law, Lord Lumley. This quite unequivocally says:

&quot;Magnanimus Heros cujus hic cernitur effigies, cujusque hic subter sunt
ossa, hujus territorii Comes fuit: sui generis ab Alani filio
cognominatus....&quot;

Lumley was husband to the earl's elder daughter Jane, and may be
expected to have known his wife's maiden name. They lived with the earl
for more than twenty years following the death in 1557 of his second
wife, the blue-stocking Mary Arundell, daughter of Sir John Arundell of
Lanherne, Cornwall.

The earl's only son predeceased him, dying in Brussels in 1556 after
having his portrait painted by Lucas de Heere. A copy of this portrait,
at Parham in Sussex, bears this inscription:

&quot;Harry Fitz-Alleyne, Lord Maltravers, eldest sonne to the Lord Harry
Erle of Arundell&quot;.

Furthermore, in the British Library (Royal MS 17 A IX) there is a
biography of the earl written by a member of his household (probably a
chaplain, according to the editor JG Nichols) which was printed in _The
Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Chronicle_ volume 103, in the issues
for July, August and September 1833. This gives a previously unknown
account of the earl's youth at the court of his godfather Henry VIII,
and begins:

&quot;The Life of Henrye Fitzallen, last Earl of Arundell of that name; who
in his life was naturallie noble and magnificent....&quot;

For the benefit of any other descendants in the newsgroup, it continues:

&quot;For the perpetuall memorie of a Personage very honourable, and that yee
who shall remaine of his bloode may the rather rejoyce of so noble a
Progenitor....&quot;

I can't find any evidence that the earl's family was ever known in his
lifetime or afterwards by any surname except Fitzalan. In _Fasti
Oxonienses_, for instance, Anthony à Wood noted:

&quot;1558-9, Jan 24, Hen. Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, High Steward of the
University, was chosen Chancellor by the suffrages of all the electors&quot;.

I see no reason to doubt that the surname was Fitzalan, if not always
then at least well before the Howards inherited the earldom o Arundel.
Douglas Richardson has still not provided any evidence of a deliberate
change to Arundel, whether informally by the invariable practice of
family members, officially by an act of parliament, or by any other
means that should be binding on historians today.

&gt; Lastly, it has been alleged in print that the Fitz Alan surname was
&gt; revived in the Tudor time period.  So far, I haven't seen any evidence
&gt; that any of the Earls of Arundel all the way down to the last male
&gt; Arundel who died in 1580 used the surname, Fitz Alan, after 1313.
&gt; Will Johnson posted a record today which suggests that Sir Philip
&gt; Howard, who was the grandson of the last Arundel earl, used the name
&gt; Fitzalan in 1582.  This could well be true.  I've written to the
&gt; record office in question to confirm the accuracy of the online
&gt; transcript.  If correct, it would be evidence that the Howard family
&gt; had revived the surname, Fitz Alan.  It obviously would not be
&gt; evidence that the Arundel family did so.

&gt; In the end, we may find that it was the Howard family that revived the
&gt; Fitz Alan surname, not the Arundel family at all.

Now Richardson is flatly lying - in May 2002 he saw evidence that he again denies having seen, and he saw it again earlier today when the same information was reposted. Although he obviously can't stay on top of his hobby horse when it trips over the truth, he can't get away with ignoring it.

&gt; Dear Newsgroup ~

&gt; An enthusiastic poster has regurgitated several previous items posted
&gt; to the newsgroup back in 2002 which imply that Henry, 18th Earl of
&gt; Arundel, revived the Fitz Alan surname in the late 1500's.  While the
&gt; 18th Earl may have revived the Fitz Alan surname, as the poster knows
&gt; quite well (and has known since these items first appeared), not one
&gt; of the records he cites was issued by the Earl himself.  Rather, all
&gt; of these items would be termed &quot;anecdoctal evidence.&quot;   For example,
&gt; we don't know when the inscription on the painting of the Earl's son
&gt; was prepared.
">

Hooey - the copy at Parham is contemporary with the original, and portraits of noblemen at that time were usually presented with the subject's name and rank.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Nor do we know who prepared the title of the biography
&gt; of the Earl or when.  These items could well date many years after the
&gt; fact!  This issue has been conveniently sidestepped by the poster.
">

More hooey - the quotation is the beginning of the original text of the biography by one of the earl's familiars, not a subsequent addition by another writer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even the Earl's own monumental inscription does not prove the Earl
&gt; used the Fitz Alan surname as claimed by our poster.  Rather, just the
&gt; opposite!  The word used is &quot;generis&quot; which refers to the Earl's
&gt; ancestors named Fitz Alan.  Had the Earl himself been a Fitz Alan,
&gt; there would be no need to tell the reader of his monument that he was
&gt; a member of the Fitz Alan family.  It would be obvious by his surname!
">

Ignorant hooey - the relevant word is &quot;cognominatus&quot;, surnamed, referring directly to &quot;Heros&quot;, i.e. to the subject, the earl himself: &quot;sui generis ab Alani filio cognominatus&quot; means &quot;surnamed due to his own descent from the son of Alan&quot;, presumably meaning surnamed Fitzalan from birth (and consequently that any revival of the surname happened before his generation). To suggest that this, in an epitaph prepared by his immediate family, leaves open a possibility that the man actually went by a different surname and this one was reinvented by an in-law from another family in the next generation is just self-interested contrariness.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As far as I can tell, the 18th Earl was known simply as Henry, Earl of
&gt; Arundel.  Usually earls whose surnames were the same as their title
&gt; did not use a surname when employing their title.  Hence it is likely
&gt; that the 18th Earl's surname and title were both Arundel.  That's an
&gt; inference, well and good, but probably not far from the truth.
">

So why did the earl's son-in-law have an inscription placed on his tomb telling a complete falsehood to posterity? Did Lord Lumley choose to be seen by everyone who knew the man and the circumstances as a lying ignoramus, simply in order to vindicate another from SLC, Utah, four centuries later?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Needless to say, it is conclusive contemporary evidence that we are
&gt; after.  That means records issued by the 18th Earl himself in his own
&gt; lifetime, or a contemporary record of him found in the crown records.
&gt; My guess at this point is that the Fitz Alan surname was revived
&gt; alright, not by the Earl, but by the Earl's grandson and heir, Sir
&gt; Philip Howard.
">

Needless to say, this means that Richardson is still, after 5 years, sitting on his hands waiting for someone else to do his work for him, while shamelesasly trying to goad others into this by preposterous bluster.

Douglas Richardson vainly tried to suggest that the first sentence of this might have been a title added later by someone other than the author, who was evidently a member of the earl's household. This is patently false - the text makes it quite clear that the first sentence, naming the subject with the surname Fitzalan, is integral to what follows. Readers can verify this for themselves on p. 11 at http://tinyurl.com/38e79s .
