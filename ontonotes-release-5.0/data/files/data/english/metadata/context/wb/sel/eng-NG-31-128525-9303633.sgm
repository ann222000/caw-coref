A LIFE DRIVEN BY PURPOSE
Part 3 of 4
By Joel McGarvey

- Study the Word -

There is no better place to begin than 2 Timothy 2:15, where the Apostle
instructs us to study the Word of God. We begin here, for without a proper
foundation gained through the study of God's Word, a proper walk and work would be
empty and useless, if not imposssible. One must spend time daily in the
Scriptures if he is to be truly approved of God. In a parallel passage, the Apostle
prayed for the saints at Philippi that they might &quot;approve things that are
excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ&quot;
(Phil. 1:10). Again, it was the Apostle's desire that the saints be ground-ed in
the Word of God and especially the Word rightly divided. But in his letter to
the Colossae church, Paul wrote directly concerning the place of the Word in
relation to man's so-called wisdom. &quot;Rooted and built up in him, and stablished
in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the
tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ&quot; (Col.
2:7-8). Here &quot;the faith&quot; (one's Biblical belief system) is placed in contrast to
human reason and tradition. In fact, the reader will notice the caution given
against all that is not after or according to Christ or His Word.

- Preach the Word-

If the child of God is going to find his purpose for life, it can only be
done as he seeks to study the Word of God. All else is merely the so-called
wisdom of man and is flawed at best.

But what do we do with the Scripture after studying it and growing in
know-ledge? The answer to this can be gained by examining the words of Paul to the
saints at Ephesus. The Apostle Paul wrote to the Church of Ephesus and told them
that the risen Christ had given certain gifts to the Church. (It is not our
intent to discuss the details of these gifts and their functions down through
history.) In Ephesians 4:11-12, Paul wrote that the gifts were given for the
purpose of perfecting, or educating/training, the saints &quot;for the work of the
ministry.&quot; (We wrote of this &quot;professional&quot; mentality in a previous article so
we will not spend a lot of time addressing it here. But contrary to popular
opinion, the work of the ministry belongs to the saints of God and not just to a
band of professionals/pastors.) This work of the ministry involves all areas
of the believer's life, and in every case it includes the application of the
Word of God. It includes the obvious areas such as the various teaching
ministries in and through the local church, giving of one's finances, visiting the
sick, encouraging the saints, and praying and caring for one another (Rom.
12:4-21; 1 Cor. 12:12-25). Certainly the work of the ministry extends to the saints
of God, our earthly spiritual family. To this end, the saints are instructed
to reach out in love to those who are hurting, to rejoice with those that
rejoice and grieve with those that grieve. This is not to the exclusion of
correction or discipline when that is called for. The failure to discipline is not an
act of grace, but rather of hatred (Prov. 13:24), as well as a disregard of
Scripture (Rom. 16:17; 1 Cor. 5:1-7, 11-13; 2 Thess. 3:6,14; 1 Tim. 5:20; Titus
1:13). The work of the ministry is wide and varied and belongs to all of the
saints of God. It always amuses me that that most of those who criticize the
pastor for not visiting enough don't visit at all unless it is a very close
relative or friend.

Paul's words to Timothy, &quot;Preach the Word&quot; (2 Tim. 4:2), form an excellent
foundation for what we are to be doing on a day-to-day basis as part of the work
of the ministry. We are to take the Word that we have studied and live it out
and share it with others. This forms what I believe to be the very heart of
our purpose, for it comes from the very heart of our Heavenly Father. Keep this
in mind when it's used in conjunction with Paul's instruction to the saints
of Ephesus. There the work of the ministry was to be carried out for the
edifying (building up or expanding) of the Body of Christ. This enlarging is the
increasing or expanding of the Body through soul winning. In other words, the
saints of God are called upon to be soul winners - to be sharing the saving
Gospel of the Grace of God with a lost and dying world.

Consider Paul's words to the saints at Corinth when he spoke of the ministry
that had been given to them. &quot;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new. And all
things are of God, Who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, and
hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; To wit, that God was in Christ,
reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them;
and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are
ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's
stead, be ye reconciled to God. For He hath made Him to be sin for us, Who knew
no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him&quot; (2 Cor.
5:17-21). It will be noticed that he stated they had been given the &quot;ministry of
reconciliation,&quot; and then he explained what it was by telling them what the
Father had done through the Son at Calvary. This was the work of Christ on behalf
of the lost: paying the price of sin. To the Romans, Paul called that work of
Christ our &quot;propitiation,&quot; the full satisfying of the Father's righteousness
through the finished work of the Son. Then to the Corinthian saints, Paul stated
that to them had been given the &quot;word of reconciliation.&quot; You see, friends,
we have been given an awesome task to share Christ with a lost world, a world
that is headed for the Lake of Fire.

Once again the point is driven home that this ministry belongs to everyone
who names the name of Christ as Savior. Someone may point to the Church and ask,
&quot;Who is the minister of the Church?&quot; Some may respond by pointing to the
Pastor, but this would not be totally accurate. He is the Pastor, but every child
of God is to be a minister (servant) of God. Every saved individual has been
given the ministry of reconciliation and is, therefore, a minister. As a
minister of God, an ambassador of reconciliation, every child of God is to preach
the Word.

Again to Timothy, the Apostle wrote, &quot;Be instant in season, out of season&quot; (2
Tim. 4:2). The Apostle Peter would give similar instructions to the saints
when he wrote, &quot;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in
you with meekness and fear&quot; (1 Pet. 3:15). The idea is a prepared people ready
at all times to tell others of the hope they have and how they received it.
Peter stated that this readiness sanctified the Lord in their hearts. By this he
meant that through their ready willingness, they were consecrating or setting
the Lord apart in their daily living. Paul urged the same thing when he gave
the instruction to make Christ preeminent (Col. 1:18). As we set Christ apart,
or make Him preeminent in our lives, we are, first of all, glorifying Him
above all else, and secondly, serving him wholeheartedly (Col. 3:17,23).

Hi prayer warriors.

Thank you for all your prayers. I got in safe yesterday.

Please pray for our new start up company. Seems that they had to dissolve
DebtsettlementUSA because another BIG company had the same name so some of the
owners pulled out so they are dissolving that company and reforming and we will
be in a new location on Monday closer to my house. Thank goodness. With the
price of gas, it is crazy.

Please pray for the new start up. There will only be 5 of us again.

I still need to get my belongings from the other office. Please pray that I
will be able with no problems.

Please also pray for the sale of my villa. Someone came and looked when I was
away. So far, no bites. I even lowered the price from 189k to 183,900$. I
have pictures I have attached if you know anyone who needs a room for rent. I
have a room for rent as well here in Sunny Fort Lauderdale.

Dear Prayer Partners:

My  cousins grand daughter (&quot;EN&quot;) is in the army serving in Iraq. She
apparently  joined the army to get away from home and perhaps church. This
young lady was raised in church and knows well the things of God. However,
after joining the army, she has gone wild, smoking and drinking and has
posted on My Space that her religion is Wiccan.

Please help us pray for EN to get under heavy conviction and turn back to
God. She is in a war zone and could face death any passing day.

Thank you

G. Dan Taylor

Just wanted to say that God is SOOOOOOO Awesome. I give him all the praise
and glory for every aspect of my life. I know that the trials he allows me to
have are for my own good and will have a great impact on my life. I know it's
hard to thank God when bad things are happening. But if we make a practice of
doing that, the good things just seem to be so much better and the praise so
much more heart felt. I thank God that he has brought me to this wonderful group.
You all have been a true blessing to me. God Bless!!Christine

***PRAISE REPORT

John bridgebuilder2006@gmail.com 11/21 For many days my sister could not
sleep properly. She had medical and emotional challenges. She takes about a dozen
medications. I sent out prayer requests by email. Finally she was able to get
to sleep. She said this felt great.  THANK God for answering prayers. Please
pray for her to get enough sleep regularly.
===============
**PRAISE REPORT

global.harvest@sympatico.ca 11/22 28,000 saved in Juba, Sudan. Bringing total
salvations for Operation Philip '07 to Over 75,000 souls!  Mark and his Team
wound up Operation Philip in Juba, Sudan.  Despite religious opposition the
crowd grew to 25,000 on the last night making the combined attendance for the 4
nights 72,000 people who heard the gospel.  Excitement filled the air and the
presence of God was evident in the atmosphere as many shouted out the words in
Arabic “Sukuran Ysua al Messiah”, (Thank you Jesus our Saviour).   Every
night visible miracles took place with many crippled being healed, the blind
seeing, the deaf and mute hearing and speaking. On the last night they came
expecting something great to happen as Mark preached “Freedom Now” or in Arabic “
Huria Alela” while the team demonstrated the crucifixion and resurrection. It
was powerful. When Mark gave the invitation another 10,000 responded bringing
the total final tally in Juba Sudan to 28,000 decisions in 4 nights.   This is
what it is all about SOULS! Mahagi, Congo  20,000 decisions, Ariwari, Congo
11,000 decisions, Kaya, Sudan 5,000 decisions, Yei, Sudan 11,000  decisions,
Juba, Sudan 28,000 decisions. The total harvest of souls for Operation Philip
2007 is 75,000 souls. Praise God for the mighty harvest!

***UPDATE

Fred Fmdal@charter.net 11/25 Marsha’s mom went in to surgery and according to
the surgeon, came out better than when she went in. they did a spinal and so
her breathing is doing fine. Her eyes are clear and her color goodd. She is in
ICU for tonight and should be moved to a room tomorrow GOD is still in

***PRAISE REPORT

Daz darrenjlewis@hotmail.co.uk 11/26    I just wanted to really thank you and
everybody who prayed for me recently, as i received a very quick answer to
prayer and the Lord provided somebody for me to talk to. I am feeling a lot
better. Still seeking the good Lords guidance, strength to witness etc. This might
seem lame, but the help, emotional support etc was very much needed and was
miraculous ,definitely.

&gt; Dear Prayer Partners:
&gt;
&gt; MyÂ  cousins grand daughter (&quot;EN&quot;) is in the army
&gt; serving in Iraq. She
&gt; apparentlyÂ  joined the army to get away from home
&gt; and perhaps church. This
&gt; young lady was raised in church and knows well the
&gt; things of God. However,
&gt; after joining the army, she has gone wild, smoking
&gt; and drinking and has
&gt; posted on My Space that her religion is Wiccan.
&gt;
&gt; Please help us pray for EN to get under heavy
&gt; conviction and turn back to
&gt; God. She is in a war zone and could face death any
&gt; passing day.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you

&gt; Just wanted to say that God is SOOOOOOO Awesome. I
&gt; give him all the praise
&gt; and glory for every aspect of my life. I know that
&gt; the trials he allows me to
&gt; have are for my own good and will have a great
&gt; impact on my life. I know it's
&gt; hard to thank God when bad things are happening. But
&gt; if we make a practice of
&gt; doing that, the good things just seem to be so much
&gt; better and the praise so
&gt; much more heart felt. I thank God that he has
&gt; brought me to this wonderful group.
&gt; You all have been a true blessing to me. God

Hi prayer warriors.

Thank you for all your prayers. I got in safe yesterday.

Please pray for our new start up company. Seems that they had to dissolve
DebtsettlementUSA because another BIG company had the same name so some of
the
owners pulled out so they are dissolving that company and reforming and we
will
be in a new location on Monday closer to my house. Thank goodness. With the
price of gas, it is crazy.

Please pray for the new start up. There will only be 5 of us again.

I still need to get my belongings from the other office. Please pray that I
will be able with no problems.

Please also pray for the sale of my villa. Someone came and looked when I
was
away. So far, no bites. I even lowered the price from 189k to 183,900$. I
have pictures I have attached if you know anyone who needs a room for rent.
I
have a room for rent as well here in Sunny Fort Lauderdale.

~ Old telephone directories make ideal personal address books. Simply cross
out the names and addresses of people you don't know.
~ When reading a book, try tearing out the pages as you read them. This
saves the expense of buying a bookmark, and the pages can later be used for
shopping lists.
~ Drill a one-inch diameter hole in your refrigerator door. This will allow
you to check that the light goes off when the door is closed.
~ Avoid being wheel-clamped by jacking your car up, removing the wheels and
locking them safely in the car until you return.
~ Smell gas? Locate the suspected leak by striking an ordinary match in
every room in the house until the explosion reveals the source of the
escaping gas.
~ Avoid parking tickets by leaving your windshield wipers on &quot;fast wipe&quot;
whenever you leave your car parked illegally.
~ Take your trash can to the supermarket with you so that you can see which
items you have recently run out of.
~ No time for a bath? Wrap yourself in duct tape and remove the dirt by
simply peeling it off.
~ Expensive hair gels are a con. Marmalade is a much cheaper alternative,
but beware of bees in the summer.
~ Avoid cutting yourself while clumsily slicing vegetables by getting
someone else to hold them while you chop away.

﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿
Nothing in life is more glorious or godlike than to stand against an enemy
and defeat them with your faith in Jesus Christ!

Daily Devotional by Max Lucado

&quot;the One who came still comes and the One who spoke still speaks&quot;

November 29
I am the way, and the truth, and the life. The only way to the Father is
through me.
John 14:6

The definitive voice in the universe is Jesus....He leaves us with two
options. Accept him as God, or reject him....There is no third
alternative.

Oh, but we try to create one. Suppose I did the same? Suppose you came
across me standing on the side of the road. I can go north or south. You
ask me which way I'm going. My reply? &quot;I'm going sorth.&quot;

Thinking you didn't hear correctly, you ask me to repeat the answer.

&quot;I'm going sorth. I can't choose between north and south, so I'm going
both. I'm going sorth.&quot;

&quot;You can't do that,&quot; you reply. &quot;You have to choose.&quot;

&quot;OK,&quot; I concede. I'll head nouth.&quot;

&quot;Nouth is not an option!&quot; you insist. &quot;It's either north or south. You
gotta pick.&quot;

When it comes to Christ, you've got to do the same.

Next Door Savior

Messages in this topic (1) 8.1. a thought and a verse Posted by: &quot;June&quot; granny_junebug@yahoo.com granny_junebug Wed Nov 28, 2007 10:45 pm (PST) Satan may try to convince us that some things God asks
us to do are small things that don't really matter.
But the Holy Spirit is right there to urge us to
take seriously what God has asked of us.
If satan were to have his way there are many things
he'd try to convince us are small and unimportant.

Is my prayer time a &quot;small thing&quot; that doesn't really
matter if I skip it?

Is my Bible reading time a &quot;small thing&quot; that doesn't
really matter when I miss doing it?

Do I consider some of the tasks the Lord puts before
me to not be worthy of my time, my energy, my talents
or my resources?

Am I faithful to the Lord EVEN in the small things?

God bless

June

The Important Sacredness of God
copyright Millie Plastaras 11/28/07

Good Morning Dear Friends,

This morning, as I sat and thought about what I should write,
one concept kept overpowering everything else. I am not
sure why, but there must be a need for it out there among you.

It is about the sacredness of God.
What does sacred mean?
It means worthy of high respect and honor,
Holy. This is a rare thing to think about. You do
not hear such terms spoken much. I think this is
very important.

One night when I was in a chat room, a guy came in
and was talking rather freely about his opinions about God.
Not uncommon in chat room, but the way He talked about
God was. He said God is my homey. I found this a odd
term to use for God. Homey means comfortable, homelike,
friendly. I do believe that we should feel at home with God,
and feel comfort in His presence, but we also need to
remember his position, and ours before Him.

We do not bring him down to our level, because
then we forget His holiness and our accountability.
We submit ourselves to Him, and honor Him,
and worship Him. He is above all and over all.

People tend to take God for granted. He is someone
they think of in emergencies, or when they attend church,
but during the week in their everyday life, he takes a back
seat in their thinking and life. He is irrelevant to what they
want to accomplish, say and do. They instead are seeking
their own will above God. This is pretending to be religious,
but neglecting God.

One of the profound things we find when we attend church
is a centralized move towards worship. We put God in
his correct position. Someone to be worshipped. He is above
us over us, Father of us, worthy of respect and honor. He
is not commonplace nor should he be taken for granted.
He is holy, pure, and He is not only a God of love
but a God of judgement.

When one neglects church, you find them getting away from
this reminder of the sacredness of God. We start thinking
about Him in different terms.

The Word of God says that the fear of God is the beginning
of wisdom. What does this mean? The healthy respect for
a living, all powerful God is the beginning of spiritual wisdom.
We remember He is our Father, we are the children, the servants.
