Hi Manoj,Media has strong role in integrating different component of socienty. Any article with spread hatered should be sensored. Like if one person read any sick article some where they start thinking that way and we sow the seed in the people minds who would have never thought about it before. I am not a Bramhin but I dont see any reason why anyone else can pass this kind of statement for people from their own society.Only religions in world which is open to changes and idea is Hindusuim and Christianity. Manusamriti if written in modern time than all the educated peple of todays who can read write and educate&amp;nbsp; others will be considered Brahmins, all the people in Army, police and people who provide security will be called Rajput, all business man will be Vaishyas. I dont see any one else in last category. Than whats the hue and cry. Old times Brahmins may have become presnt days vaishyas and Olden times Vishayas might have become morden day Brahmins. Though by giving same names may hurt some people but I tried to give logic behind Manusamriti. I consider religion is a way to integrate societyReligion should integrateIt should preach non violenceIt should be flexible and should be adaptable to ideas and changes according to era we are inIt preaches brotherhood with enemiesReligion should not be basis of securing good time after death, who cares what you get after you are dead but it should make your present life better.It should&amp;nbsp; preach that&amp;nbsp; your friends, neighbours and country and society,family are important irrespective&amp;nbsp; of their thoughts and beleifNo one has right to abuse my faith and I repect all others who does not hate mine faithAman SinghOn Sun, 21 Oct 2007 08:48:28 -0500 BIHARTODAY@googlegroups.com wrote  Dear Mr. Rajsheker,  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  Dalits are also human beings and loved by god;the label is by birth and there is nothing to be ashamed of.

Dalits Voice ???

How many of them ???

I read some articles and their arguements are laughable. So called dalit messiah;s are earning money and power on the name of dalit's voice and enjoying luxury leaving behinds rest of them to die. These udit raj's, athvale's etc are blood suckers.

Religion was there long before Ambedkar's, Athvale's and Udit Raj's arrived. We have more than ever dalit leaders in the country now. Their lives have not been made any better but the leaders have earned all the fruits using them. Mayawati's of today are sitting on gold mines.

Brahminical era was centuries long, they were respected for their knowledge and merit. No body asked others not to study the same. Brahmins changed all along and are doing all kind of jobs thesedays, dalits are doing all kinds of job too but wants compensation in terms of reservations. No knowledge will yield anything unless the mindset is changed. Then it doesn't matter whether they change to Islam, Bhddhists, Christanity or anything else.

Yesterday's dalits will remain dalits of today as well unless they start behaving like learned personnel. Already have heard lots bull and crap, come on now guys !! As per the dalit voice in articles here, it seems Muslims, Buddhists, Christains all are same and their common goal is Brahmin bashing. Yeah, perhaps all terrorists think alike... but its not true. There are virtual terrorists and fascists in every corner of the country and they are in majority because they help each other grow and destroy our beautiful country.
