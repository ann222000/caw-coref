Does anybody know where I can obtain a new fan for an Apple IIGS?

I can't find any 2&quot;, 2-pin fans in any of the stores in my area. They
are all either too large or 3-pin (and 3-wire). Is there some place
where I can order it on-line?

They seem to regularly show up on ebay - maybe once a month or so&gt;

The three pin fans will work. I did this recently to cool my IIgs
power supply down after modding my Zip GSX. The white wire is only for
providing &quot;monitoring&quot; - ie. fan speed. The red (power) and black
(ground) are the only wires you need. You can even plug a 3 pin socket
into the onboard 2 pin plug, ensuring that you plug the socket in
correctly - ie. the red wire should plug into +12V and the black
should be ground. The orientation of wires is even the same (e.g. the
socket will plug in without having to move the wires from pin 1 to pin
2, etc).

If you look at my Zip GSX mod page ( http://apple2.sytes.net/
ZIP_GSX_Mod/index.html), on the second last image you will see a 3 pin
CPU fan that I employed to do this. I had to lengthen the wires by
soldering additional lengths to both the red and black wires, as CPU
fans only have short wire lengths. In my case, I just snipped the
white wire and taped it up with electrical tape as it was not
required.

Although its not as elegant as having a &quot;proper&quot; IIgs fan, it does do
the job. If you can't find any 2 pin fans, just keep in mind that the
3 pin ones can be used.

cheers,

The 3-pin fans I know of have one that sends the speed back to the
motherboard. Â Ignore that one and just connect the red and black wires.
