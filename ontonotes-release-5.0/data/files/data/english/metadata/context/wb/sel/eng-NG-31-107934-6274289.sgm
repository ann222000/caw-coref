What methods do you deploy?  How many folks use a kneeboard?  What
kind of timer (analog or digital stopwatch) do you use, and where do
you put it?  Where do you keep the charts, approach plates, and
scratch paper?  How many people write down every clearance, heading,
altitude and frequency change?  How do you keep from dropping your pen
(or pencil)?  Is it on a string?  Where do you put in when not in
use?  Velcro?  Your pocket?

I've read the books, but I just wonder how people cope in real life.
Rod Machado talks about using a clipboard (with extra clips on the 3
other sides) in his excellent training manual.  This seems like a good
idea to me.

First and most important rule:  Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)!  The more complex
of an organizational method you have, the more likely it is to fail.

I do use a kneeboard, with a pen holder on it.  On the kneeboard is some
scratch paper, and usually the enroute chart I'm using at the moment.
I have a digital kitchen timer on the yoke for timing approaches along with
a simple clip below it for holding the approach plate in use.  That way,
I don't have to divert my eyes too far from my scan when checking the
approach plate.

Do I write down every single clearance?  No.  Not if it's simple, like
"turn left to heading 270, descend and maintain 5,000".  I also don't usually
write down approach clearances because you usually know what approach
they're going to give you ahead of time, and the last thing I want do to
during the approach phase of flight is take my attention away from the panel.
That said, sometimes those approach clearances can get fairly complex and it
may be worth jotting down the pertinent info.

For departure clearances, I have a sheet of blank paper on which I write
"CRAFTS" vertically along the left side for "Clearance, Route, Altitude,
Frequency, Transponder, Special" that I can fill in when given my clearance.

Keep your cockpit clutter to a minimum, and keep things as simple
as possible.  The purpose of cockpit organization is so that you can
focus on the important things, like flying the airplane.

Sure it is. Lots of pilots use the clipboard with great success.

Personally, I just put everything into a 3 ring binder in the order that I
will use it. The binder has a clip on it to hold the approach plate. I do not
use a kneeboard. I use the clock in the airplane for a timer. If things are
not in use they go in the pocket behind the right seat. I put approach plate
binders, en route charts, etc. usually on the floor between the seats.

I do not write everything down. Instead I use bugs to remind me of things if
I need it. I write down my initial clearance and sometimes the clearance for
approach if it is complicated. Otherwise, I have better things to do than to
stick my head down in the cockpit. What I do write down goes on a small
spiral notepad that fits in my pocket.

My ideal flying togs would have pencil holders on the shirt sleeve, like AF
flight suits have.

I always enlist the aid of the right seat passenger to help with paper
handling. It helps to keep them from getting board during the flight.

In real life, I use the other seat as my desk.  If somebody is sitting on
my desk, they get to hold charts, hand me things, etc.  If I'm flying solo,
my flight bag goes on the seat with everything I need in it.  That
generally means sectional or en-route chart, one or more book of approach
plates (I use the bound NOS books), and a small spiral notebook which I use
for copying clearances, and as a rough logbook.  You can never have enough
pens, and at night, you can never have enough flashlights (I'm partial to
the 2-AA MiniMaglight.

The kneeboard thing might make sense in a single-seat fighter, but I don't
fly single-seat fighters.

I used to have nice little Radio Shack timers that I would velcro to the
yoke.  Now, I suppose I've gotten lazy and/or spoiled, but I've got
count-down timers built into the GPS I use, but most of the time I don't
even use a timer, since the GPS tells you when you're at the MAP, and draws
you a picture of every hold and procedure turn that you can just follow the
purple line.  If I really do want to time a minute, I usually find the
easiest thing to do is glance at my watch, and just keep going until the
same number of seconds is showing in the display as the first time.  Does
any of that meet some PTS-inspired concept of best practices?  I have no
idea, but it's what I do in real life and it seems to work.

Charts (be they a sectional or an en-route) tend to get wedged into a
corner of the windshield.

I write down my initial clearance, and any re-routes I get in the air.
Assigned headings just get dialed right into the heading bug (whether I'm
using the AP or not).  For altitude assignements, I'll generally just turn
the #2 OBS to it (i.e. for "climb and maintain 5000", I'll twist the OBS to
050).

I use a spiral bound notebook, 5.5 by about 8 inches -- it's easy to
tuck a pencil in the spring. WX info on the top of the sheet, flight
plan under that, clearance under that. Ilist frequencies in a column
down the extreme right hand edge, fixes with eta, ata, and time over
destination down the left hand side. Clearance modifications are
recorded as they are given, and approach details make it easy to refer
to. You won't find yourself wondering if you were cleared to 3000 or
2000 if you see a down arrow and 3000 written there.

The notebook has a rubber band around it, that holds maps, calculators
and so on. You simply don't need to have a lot of paper active in the
cockpit, this system is a reasonable starting place for you to develop
your own way of doing it.

The neat thing is each notebook sheet records the details of a flight
much better than your log book entry will, and a full notebook, with
its 60 pages, can hold easily a hundred flights. I use the back pages
for FSS phone numbers, flight plan forms, that sort of thing.

No kneeboards for me, at least half my flights are business related
and I don't want my suit pants to look like I had something strapped
to the leg.

Try it even VFR, it works just as well, and you'll notice how easy it
is to take notes and the like. You'll probably organize the pad
differently than I do, but once you decide on how you want to record
things, do it that way all of the time, it will, I promise you, make
things a lot easier as you gain experience.

Figure out a better way and then tell us about it!

The fewer things you have with you in the cockpit, the simpler
everything becomes. Leave everything in your flight bag but somewhere
within reach, and grab only what you really need. In a training
environment our students are trained as if every flight is an
emergency, and to be prepared for the worst. Nothing wrong with that,
but you have to decide the correct balance of things to carry for each
flight to minimize clutter and workload.

I clip the weather and flight planning printouts to the kneeboard.
That also doubles as my scratch paper. Attaching a string is a good
idea, but I have never done it. I carry one pen for multiple things
(signing logbooks and such), so tying it to the clipboard would be
inconvenient.

My wrist watch serves as the timer if I ever need one. I don't bother
timing the approach unless the weather is near minimum. All my charts
stay in the bag, and I only rip out the pages I need. For the most
part, the NACO chart book stays in my flight bag (which could be
outdated), and I fly with individually printed approach charts.

I don't write everything down. Squawk codes and radio frequencies get
loaded into the stack right away as I am reading them back to the
controller. I only write down stuff that the controller starts with
"advice when ready to copy". If an instruction is too lengthy and I
happen to miss something, I can always ask it to be repeated. It
doesn't happen  often enough to worry about hogging the frequency.

Don't forget the flashlight. I have yet to find a good way to keep it
from getting lost. It is too bulky to attach it to a string but it is
too small to keep from rolling off into a crevice.

Flashlights come in two styles.

I like the tip about using OBS #2 to hold altitude assignments!   As
far as the flashlight goes, I have one that hangs around my neck on a
lanyard.  I don't bother timing my approaches.  With 2 GPS units and
associated situational awareness, timing is a waste of time.

Except when you need the OBS #2 for navigation!  It sounds like GPS
navigation is now the norm.  One of the planes I fly has a GNS-430,

I've got a kneeboard that I bolted an analog stopwatch to (on the clip).  As for
pens, I carry a couple in my shirt pocket, and about a half dozen more in my
flight case.  For night flights, I keep a mini maglite in my shirt pocket... the
one that takes the AAA batteries.... as I can hold it in my mouth if need be
until I have something better worked out.  Two additional lights in the flight
case.

As for clearances, I write the original one.  After that I usually just go by
memory unless there's a multipart change or I'm in an unfamiliar area where I
don't know where places are without resorting to a chart.  But I seldom write
down a frequency, heading  or altitude change.  I can keep them in my head.

Flip flop radios are particularly handy for frequency changes: old frequency on
one side, new on the other.  If nobody's at home on the new, just flip it back
to the old.

I keep my flight case between the seats or on the unoccupied front seat if I'm
alone.

While I like the idea of a flashlight on a headband of some sort, it interferes
with my headset.  So I use the 2 cell AAA mini maglite as my first line of
defense.  It's clipped to my shirt pocket.

I had an excellent instructor tell me about the CRAFTS acronym almost
5 years ago, but I had forgotten all about it!   Ethyl was in her 80's
and flew during WWII with the WASPs.  She had both airplane and
helicopter instrument instructor ratings.  She must not have weighed
more than 90 lbs, and had to sit on a pillow to see out.  But she
would smack you on the right leg if you weren't using enough rudder!
In her day she taught most of the pilots in our town how to fly, but
Lord help you if you were on her bad side!

She finally retired about 2 years ago, and moved out of town with her
daughter.  We miss her.

I agree with KISS principle.  I'm hearing a lot of good ideas here.
My trouble for now is when I put on the IQ reducer (a.k.a. foggles) my
short term memory (and long term, and computing ability) tends to go
south, so if I don't write everything down I start doubting myself
halfway through that turn or altitude change (did he say a heading of
240 or 250?).  I like the idea of using bugs and unused navigation
equipment to note the numbers.

Thanks!

&gt; will use it. The binder has a clip on it to hold the approach plate. I do not
&gt; use a kneeboard. I use the clock in the airplane for a timer. If things are
&gt; not in use they go in the pocket behind the right seat. I put approach plate
&gt; binders, en route charts, etc. usually on the floor between the seats.

&gt; I do not write everything down. Instead I use bugs to remind me of things if
&gt; I need it. I write down my initial clearance and sometimes the clearance for
&gt; approach if it is complicated. Otherwise, I have better things to do than to
&gt; stick my head down in the cockpit. What I do write down goes on a small
&gt; spiral notepad that fits in my pocket.

&gt; My ideal flying togs would have pencil holders on the shirt sleeve, like AF
&gt; flight suits have.

&gt; I always enlist the aid of the right seat passenger to help with paper
&gt; handling. It helps to keep them from getting board during the flight.

&gt; I used to have nice little Radio Shack timers that I would velcro to the

&gt; any of that meet some PTS-inspired concept of best practices?  I have no
&gt; idea, but it's what I do in real life and it seems to work.

&gt; Charts (be they a sectional or an en-route) tend to get wedged into a
&gt; corner of the windshield.

&gt; I write down my initial clearance, and any re-routes I get in the air.
&gt; Assigned headings just get dialed right into the heading bug (whether I'm
&gt; using the AP or not).  For altitude assignements, I'll generally just turn
&gt; the #2 OBS to it (i.e. for &quot;climb and maintain 5000&quot;, I'll twist the OBS to
&gt; 050).

I also use the right seat for my desk flying VFR (when not occupied),
but I'm not sure the examiner will want to hold my paperwork for me.
Once I get past that daunting hurdle, I will enlist my passengers as

&gt; I use a spiral bound notebook, 5.5 by about 8 inches -- it's easy to

&gt; No kneeboards for me, at least half my flights are business related

&gt; Try it even VFR, it works just as well, and you'll notice how easy it

&gt; things a lot easier as you gain experience.

I like the idea of a spiral notebook!  Not only do you get rid of the
loose sheets, you have a built in pencil holder.  I'm not sure I
understand how you use a rubber band to hold maps, calculators, etc.

The more you fly the more you will come to anticipate what to expect.  That

will take special note of the important words with meaning.  If you were to
try to have the same conversation in another language you would have to
devote vast mental energy to every syllable and try to rapidly assemble the
collection of syllables into words as you scrambled to remember the English
meaning of those sounds.  That would be a lot of hard work for anyone doing
the same thing.  Most of the problem you are is having to rapidly recognize
and decode unusual items with almost no ability to anticipate what is coming
next.

The ASA stopwatch. I know, it's expensive and kitchen timers do the

The Zuluboards have these nice big pen holder pockets. Really neat, they
work well in turbulence. For dropping protection, I have several pens in

One thing I haven't figured out yet is where to put the handheld backup
GPS (we have a Garmin 430 in the plane). I would NEVER fly without at
least a handheld GPS in IMC (if there is none in the panel - if there
is, I still like the backup). The cost of that safety device has become
trivial, with the Lowrance Airmap 500 or 600c. One can put it on the
yoke, and I would if it were my primary GPS, to have it in the scan. But
in my set-up, it then gets obscured by anything on the yoke clip.

Exactly. The hardest part of instrument training for me thus far has
been the clearances. But the last two times out, especially last night,
I finally got it. I even sounded (to my ears) smooth. It is really
difficult to fly the plane and listen while in the back of your mind
you're thinking about all the stuff the clearance is telling you,
altitude turn the plane, set the radios etc.

As for organization, I have the analog clock in the Cherokee Challenger
(my favorite part of the plane) and a digital kitchen timer that is
stuck on a blanking plate on the radio stack, ie: out of the way.

I use a kneeboard with enroute chart on top, then scratch paper and then
then checklist underneath that. don't forget your checklist. I have my
checkride this Friday. The PTS mentions the "proper use of checklists"
so I made up my own that incorporates the plane checklist with the IFR
checklists I had. Now I have 1 nice one to refer to. I'll share it if
you want. It has all the emergency stuff on there too.

I wear a baseball hat with a pen stuck into the band near my head. We
also have a wad of velcro on the dash with an extra pen stuck on that.
Plus the plane logbook has extra pens. That goes in between the back
seats. I also keep my loose plates in the binder back there. It is all
within easy reach.

Plates go on a yoke clip. All the plates I may need including the plates
for the departure airport. Plates are in order of use. I think that is
all of it. Oh yeah, flashlights. Each side pocket has a flashlight and
my flight bag (on the back seat if passengers) otherwise on the front
seat has a flashlight. I try to keep as many things as I can triple
redundant.

Good luck with the training. It is very intense.

I know this is at least partially true.  I learned to fly at an
uncontrolled field, so at first I had limited exposure to the ATC
lingo and was frequently tongue tied.  I am now based at a Class D
airport, so I've gotten much better at VFR verbiage.  I know my IFR
language skills are still dismal (what did he just say?).  The
combination of so much thought going into actually flying the
airplane, adjusting the radios, reading the approach, and having ATC
say something I wasn't expecting can put me in brain overload
sometimes!  Practice, practice, practice!!!

I fly with two of these.
I write down every frequency change.  It's not a big deal and on the return
flight it's nice to have all the frequencies written down so you know what
to expect.

I don't fly ifr that much.  I always consider those radios (vor's and an
ndb) as primary navigation.  It's a simple matter to to glance at the gps
(396) to verify.  If you are a student, I would suggest a 396 and spend a
bit of time learning it.  You can quickly load the approaches and
graphically see what atc is doing.  Otherwise, during training, I found that
I was just blindly following vectors without really visualizing.  After
doing the approaches for a while, you will start to anticipate atc.  I now
fly practice approaches without the gps.

I like my old panel.  2 vor's, 1 ils, adf, vaccum and electric attitude, and
396 with weather.  As long as you really understand how to use a vor, the
rest is just repetative procedures that will become second nature.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not me, at least not reliably.  I hope that I get smarter and can
&gt; &gt;&gt; devote more brain cell cycles to short term memory once I get better
&gt; &gt;&gt; at flying the plane by reference to instruments!  In the mean time
&gt; &gt;&gt; it's safer for me to write everything down.  These responses are
&gt; &gt;&gt; giving me hope that this won't always be the case!

&gt; &gt; The more you fly the more you will come to anticipate what to expect.  That
&gt; &gt; makes remembering things far easier than when you are a student.  This
&gt; &gt; change is akin to learning a new language.  As a native English speaker I
&gt; &gt; don't have to decode every utterance of someone and match it up with the one
&gt; &gt; right word in an English dictionary.  Once you engage in conversation you
&gt; &gt; will take special note of the important words with meaning.  If you were to
&gt; &gt; try to have the same conversation in another language you would have to
&gt; &gt; devote vast mental energy to every syllable and try to rapidly assemble the
&gt; &gt; collection of syllables into words as you scrambled to remember the English
&gt; &gt; meaning of those sounds.  That would be a lot of hard work for anyone doing
&gt; &gt; the same thing.  Most of the problem you are is having to rapidly recognize
&gt; &gt; and decode unusual items with almost no ability to anticipate what is coming
&gt; &gt; next.

&gt; Exactly. The hardest part of instrument training for me thus far has
&gt; been the clearances. But the last two times out, especially last night,
&gt; I finally got it. I even sounded (to my ears) smooth. It is really
&gt; difficult to fly the plane and listen while in the back of your mind
&gt; you're thinking about all the stuff the clearance is telling you,
&gt; altitude turn the plane, set the radios etc.

&gt; As for organization, I have the analog clock in the Cherokee Challenger
&gt; (my favorite part of the plane) and a digital kitchen timer that is
&gt; stuck on a blanking plate on the radio stack, ie: out of the way.

&gt; I use a kneeboard with enroute chart on top, then scratch paper and then
&gt; then checklist underneath that. don't forget your checklist. I have my
&gt; checkride this Friday.

Good Luck!  Please let us know how it went down!

Lots of good advice.

For timers, I use:
http://www.lcflight.com/timers.html
"4 Channel Alarm /Clock Timer"

#1 is the 'active' timer (expected times, times approaches, etc.), #3
and #4 are fuel tanks.  #2 is the countdown for beverage and meal
service, ie I dont' use it.  ;-)  My CFII said it was too complicated
but I had used it when I worked in a laboratory and it is very simple to
use.  A few weeks later after he told me this, I saw a picture of the
cockpit of SpaceShipOne and it had one mounted in it.  :)

Well, actually, my CFII insisted that after a proper approach briefing
you shouldn't really need to look at the plate much anymore. Certainly
not enough to warrant a need to have it in your scan. The minimum

I have a Lowrance 2000C, but you can't load the approaches directly.
However the waypoints are depicted, and it's valuable to see where you
are (while being vectored) in relation to the FAF.  I've only done
this so far while acting as a safety pilot, and found that ATC
continued to vector us inside the FAF on one occasion.  OK for
practice, but not so good if we were in real IMC!

Visualization is sure tough (for me) without the GPS.  The Garmin 396

I have actually worked this problem a bit.  I found that it is very important
that the light source be above your eye level.  If it is not, then your hand
casts a shadow across your pen point when you are writing on a kneeboard and you
can't see what you are writing.  This problem will occur with the mic-lights and
any other light that is below your eyes.

I also found that having an adjustable light level was very important, as the
on/off type lights are waaay to bright.

My simplest solution was to put 3M "Dual Lock" tape on the headset shells and to
mount a couple of red lights like the Photon Micro-Light II.  (You can also use
Velcro but it does not provide as positive a positioning.)

http://www.photonlight.com/LED-Keychain-Flashlights-s/1.htm

They used to have a model they called the "Covert" which had a little
sleeve/snout covering the LED so that all the light went forward.  This is
important to eliminate reflections from the side windows, so a little home-made
engineering will now be required.  They also sell a thing called a "short
lanyard clip" that helps keep the lights from going under the seat when you bump
them off the headset.  If you align them properly they will illuminate most of
the panel and there is not a lot of head-turning required.

Then I went to a Clarity Aloft headset.  Spectacular sound quality, etc. but
nowhere to mount the lights!  For that I made my own set of "headlights" which
work well but took so much time (and a lathe and a milling machine) that only a
lunatic would do it.  For this type of headset, an adjustable brightness red
headlight or ball cap light would be perfect but I have not yet seen one.

I skip all the fancy stuff. Lots of pens (so if I drop I have
another), the writing pad (I use the 4x6 ones), enroute chart and
terminal charts (bound govt--much sturdier), two pairs of reading
glasses. All I need. There is a flashlight or two, but I don't fly in
IMC at night. Put the heading into the heading bug, the altitude into
the altimeter bug and the freq into the radio. I find that to be a
godsend over trying to write everything down. I do write down initial
clearances, because they are usually long. I just file everywhere
direct (I have IFR GPS), and take what I get, unless I know how to get
something special out of ATC (then I file that). I don't need a timer,
but if I did, I'd just use my wristwatch. I store my pencil in my
shirt pocket. Nothing fancy.

If you do buy a bunch of fancy stuff, buy the cheap stuff. That way
when you throw it out, it won't hurt as much.

Depends.  On a vectored ILS, there's only one altitude you need to remember
(the DA).  Most of us can probably handle remembering one number.

But, not all approaches are that simple.  I would never trust myself to
remember two or three stepdown fixes and the altitudes for each.  Brief the
approach to make sure you understand what you need to do, but keep the
plate handy to find the exact number each time I cross a fix.

This is another place where the GPS really reduces workload.  Many
non-precision approaches these days have vertical guidance.  Just follow
the needle down like it's an ILS.  Now you're back to remembering a single
number.

As far as memorizing the fist part of the missed, that's easy.  I haven't
seen one yet that didn't being with "climb".

Approaches into a mountain usually have a missed that starts "climb and

I'd like to to consider another organizational skill for flying in
IMC, this is related to approaches etc.

Always -- make that ALWAYS -- brief yourself on the approach, but with
this important difference. You may have said to yourself "OK, final
approach fix at 3500, fly 210 degrees, descend to 2150, fly for 2
minutes 30 seconds, land. Don't do that!

Always self brief the miss. "Fly for 2 minutes 30 seconds, look for
the airport, full throttle, gear up, establish positive climb rate,
report the miss to approach, maintain 210 degrees, climb to 4000, left
turn,"

Always treat seeing the airport as a happy accident -- you know how to
land, don't sweat that.

In real life, especially if you're flying into uncontrolled airports,
you may be flying missed approaches one time in 20 or 1 time in a
hundred, and I want you to be ready for that exceptional time. It'll
be handy on your check ride, too, because you just know the examiner
is going to tell you to fly the miss at a time when you're focusing on
landing.

Treat this advice like the others you have gotten -- if it makes sense
to you, make it your own. But trust me on this. This mind set, that
seeing the runway at MDA is a happy accident, and you've already
planned to fly the miss, will save you a lot of workload at a critical
time. I can't imagine a downside, although some readers may find one.

Good advice to brief and be ready for the missed approach.  However, for the
actual mechanics of the missed, I'd add as the first step "pitch up to climb
attitude" (generally about 10 degrees, or 2-3 bar widths).  Many times on an
instrument proficiency check I've seen the pilot add full power without a
definite pitch up, and spend a lot longer than he should down near 200 feet.
Absolute priority on the missed is to get the climb established, and you do
this with both pitch and power.

&gt; IMC, this is related to approaches etc.

&gt; Always -- make that ALWAYS -- brief yourself on the approach, but with
&gt; this important difference. You may have said to yourself &quot;OK, final
&gt; approach fix at 3500, fly 210 degrees, descend to 2150, fly for 2
&gt; minutes 30 seconds, land. Don't do that!

&gt; Always self brief the miss. &quot;Fly for 2 minutes 30 seconds, look for
&gt; the airport, full throttle, gear up, establish positive climb rate,
&gt; report the miss to approach, maintain 210 degrees, climb to 4000, left
&gt; turn,&quot;

&gt; Always treat seeing the airport as a happy accident -- you know how to
&gt; land, don't sweat that.

&gt; In real life, especially if you're flying into uncontrolled airports,
&gt; you may be flying missed approaches one time in 20 or 1 time in a
&gt; hundred, and I want you to be ready for that exceptional time. It'll
&gt; be handy on your check ride, too, because you just know the examiner
&gt; is going to tell you to fly the miss at a time when you're focusing on
&gt; landing.

&gt; Treat this advice like the others you have gotten -- if it makes sense
&gt; to you, make it your own. But trust me on this. This mind set, that
&gt; seeing the runway at MDA is a happy accident, and you've already
&gt; planned to fly the miss, will save you a lot of workload at a critical
&gt; time. I can't imagine a downside, although some readers may find one.

Sounds like great advice to me!   I imagine as time goes on it will be
easy to become complacent.  This sounds like a good way to guard
against that!

Me.  And a yoke board.

What

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

ASA Timer but it's very bulky.  Attached to yoke board with 3M Dual Lock,
similar to Velcro.

Where do you keep the charts, approach plates, and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; scratch paper?
">

On the knee board, either Jepp punched on the binder rings or under the clip.
Plates are moved to the yoke board when I'm using them, so very little head
movement and easy to see.  Otherwise the airplane specific checklist is visible
on the yoke board.

How many people write down every clearance, heading,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; altitude and frequency change?
">

Me.  Or I try to.  I use custom paper printed from an Excel spreadsheet that
gives me, among other things, three columns of blanks titled Altitude, Heading,
and Frequency.  The bottom number written in each column is the current
assignment.  I could email you the spreadsheet if you like.

How do you keep from dropping your pen

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (or pencil)?
">

Sometimes not too effectively.  I have spares.  Waiting until three are on the
floor substantially increases my odds of finding _one_ by blind groping.

Is it on a string?  Where do you put in when not in

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Both the yoke board and the knee board have velcro to hold pens.

&gt; &gt; I've read an interesting article about an alternative way to interpret
&gt; &gt; the VOR.   Has anyone read Joe Campbell's IFR diary, or this article:

I just found it at http://www.sarangan.org/aviation/articles/vor-article.pdf

Velcro.

The top of my glareshield is slowly evolving to complete velcro. I've
got one of those little photo lights on a velcro strap that is placed
very conveniently on the glareshield in front of me.

Removed the ashtray years ago and now have a battery-powered
'ash light' (no, this isn't an ad).

Frankly, flashlights are the least of my worries at night or IFR.

(small maglight in pocket next to me, big D cell maglight under the
seat, etc)

I tried the clipboard concept - not practical when there's really
not enough room in my lap (I need to sit close, short legs).

Timer, with velcro on the back, on the glareshield. But I really like
the clock in the aircraft with the second hand. Dealing with setting
and resetting the digital clock is a pain when trying to do multiple
things.

You have to be careful when saying those words aloud.

Velcro seems to be a common theme here!  What a great invention!
Anyone remember those old David Letterman shows where he played
"Velcro Man" (am I remembering this right?).  He donned a velcro suit,
jumped on a trampoline, and then stuck to a velcro wall.   Anyway, I
thought it was funny.

Thanks Blanche!

Thanks to everyone who offered up so many great ideas!  This seems to
be a very individual thing, but it's great to have so many workable
ideas to choose from.

I've only been posting for less than a week, but I have found this
group to be invaluable!  It's amazing to me that so many folks with
common interests are willing to provide thoughtful responses to a
perfect stranger (me)!  I really appreciate it!
