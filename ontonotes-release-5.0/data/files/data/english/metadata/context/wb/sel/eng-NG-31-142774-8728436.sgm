The video shown maybe real maybe not.
Just the other week, I was hunting down the Chupacabra, via YouTube, and
there was one very convincing video showing it jumping in close quarters
over a Puerto Rican farmhouse roof.

I should have bookmarked it, as when later trying to find it, (for about 3
hours) it wasn't there.

This in my mind, makes it more credible, as no doubt, there are spooks,
whose job it is to trawl through articles and film material, and remove it
from our prying eyes.

How many times have you come across something, only to find it not there,
later on.

In the same way, there is also lot of material, put out there, to test our
reactions, the Haiti ufo video, perhaps being one such example.

I believe, there are many dimensions, through which entities and similiar
can traverse, at the blink of an eye, without us ever being aware of them.

Around you now, while you're reading this, there are a whole host of
energies,'looking over your shoulder'. We are never alone, and the truth to
all, is not so much OUT THERE, but a lot closer to home.

In many ways, the Chupacabra shares many similarities with the so called
Jersey Devil, of which I've included the following snip;

Records of sightings of the creature in established newspapers did not
appear until the advent of the Twentieth Century. It is safe to speculate
that any written records prior to the 1900s were either lost or destroyed
over time. One of the earliest sightings recorded by local Philadelphia
newspapers was in 1899 and it involved a businessman named George Saarosy
who was awoken one night by loud, high-pitched screams in his yard. When he
looked out his window, he saw the Jersey Devil fly past his house.

The most incredible flurry activity regarding the Devil did not happen until
1909 when literally thousands of encounters with the beast were reported.
Articles printed in the now defunct Philadelphia Record chronicled the
Devil's exploits. During the week of January 16th to the 23rd, the Jersey
Devil reached a crescendo of popularity while managing to terrorize the
entire population of the Delaware Valley. So immense was the attention paid
to the creature, it received national news coverage.

On Saturday January 16, in the town of Woodbury, New Jersey, a man named
Zack Cozzens reported seeing it on a roadside. This experience was
chronicled in James Maloy and Ray Miller's book The Jersey Devil, which
proved indispensable in writing this article. In it, Cozzens was quoted as
saying: &quot;I first heard a hissing sound. Then, something white flew across
the street. I saw two spots of phosphorus--the eyes of the beast.... It was
as fast as an auto.&quot; Later that same night, a group of people reported
spying it in Bristol, Pennsylvania. The reports did not stop there.

A Mr. and Mrs. Nelson spotted the animal cavorting on their shed for ten
straight minutes; police officers filed reports of shooting at it; and even
a Trenton city councilman (name withheld in the source material) claimed an
encounter. He had heard a hissing sound at his doorstep late one night. When
he opened the door, he found cloven hoofprints in the snow. These bizarre
footprints were turning up all over the New Jersey, Philadelphia, and
Delaware region. Animal mutilations, occurring at random throughout the area
during the week, were blamed on the Jersey Devil.

Although the sightings were front page news in Philadelphia and across the
country, they were, of course, being met with total ridicule by the press.
One editor went so far as to dismiss the whole thing as figments of the
imagination of &quot;complete idiots.&quot; The Philadelphia Zoo, as a joke, offered a
$10,000 reward for its capture. Then, &quot;the creature&quot; was &quot;captured&quot; by
Norman Jefferies and Jacob Hope.

------

The Chupacabra exists, of that I'm sure, whether it be alien or the result
of genetic experimentation, is open to question.
Sightings of the creature range from many Southern American countries, as
well as from the America itself.

Recently there have been many sightings in Calama in Chile, where locals
have accused NASA of involvement, with this strange creature.

Snip;

Residents of Calama, a city in northern Chile, claim that NASA took custody
of the three Chupacabras reportedly captured by the Chilean army two weeks
ago.
According to reports obtained by Marcial Campos Maza, a reporter for Chile's
EFE new service, Chilean troops captured the three creatures in the desert
near the Radomiro Tomic mine north of Calama. During the pursuit, a
firefight ensued in which one Chilean soldier was reportedly killed.

The three creatures--a male, a female and a child-- were held at the
regiment;s barracks for several hours. Then a NASA team reportedly arrived
by helicopter to take custody of them.

Some residents of Calama, however, claimed that that the Chupacabras were
&quot;creations&quot; of NASA.

&quot;'The gringos had at least three genetic experiments run away from them, and
they've only been able to capture two of them,' said Dagoberto Corante, a
Chilean architect.&quot;

&quot;Residents of Calama and nearby communities continued to blame NASA, the U.S.
space agency, for the apparitions and attacks of the mysterious Chupacabras,
which has killed man farm animals in the region and in other parts of Chile.
Several dozen goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits and other animals turned up
dead in northern Calama and its environs during late April (2000)--their
bodies completely exsanguinated (drained of blood--J.T.) and undevoured by
the mysterious predator.&quot;

Stories continue to spread of &quot;the Chupacabras' alleged destructiveness and
their ability of leaping 3-meter (10-foot) tall walls, its ability to walk
unmolested among dogs, while police and volunteers who have set out after it
find only scattered footprints in this area of desert terrain 1,500
kilometers (900 miles) north of&quot; Santiago de Chile, the national capital.

&quot;According to Dagoberto Corante, one such creature was captured by elements
of a local (army) regiment in an operation that resulted in the death of one
soldier, but the (Chilean) military have allegedly refused to discuss the
matter.&quot;

&quot;'It was said that the captured animal was kept all day at at the regiment;s
barracks until NASA experts arrived to take it away.' said Corante, who is
well-known and respected in the area where the Chupacabra feasted on blood
and spread fear among the population.&quot;

&quot;'On the day that the event transpired, the military even closed the
(Calama) airport for several hours to enable the landing of a helicopter
conveying American scientists,' he added, 'although no one is quite sure why
they had to close down an airport in order for a helicopter to
function--those are devices able to land anywhere, and the fact has given
rise to much speculation.'&quot;

So who knows? The mystery continues, as does the spread of sightings, and
territory being claimed by a creature, which I'm sure none of us would wish
to come face to face with, on a lonely dark night.

If you should, then make sure you have your camera handy, and of course a
tin foil hat.

IMO part of that clip is faked. If you go to the end and watch it as it
passes what looks like white fence posts the legs are behind it and the
torso is in front of it. like it is walking through it. you'll have to watch
it a few times.

The ordinary man is aware of his surroundings, first, by naming and
labelling them; second, by linking them with past memory of them; and third,
by relating them to his own personal self. The illumined egoless man is
simply aware of them, without any of these other added activities. &gt;&gt;&gt; Paul
