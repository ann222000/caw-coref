again, i would like everyone's insight, thoughts, hunches, guesses,
and speculations on these verses....

i will start with verse 11, but i'll capitalize all of verse 13
because it is what caught my attention and my main point in question.

&quot;It was he [Christ] who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets,
some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to
prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ
may be built up UNTIL WE ALL REACH UNITY IN THE FAITH AND IN THE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE SON OF GOD AND BECOME MATURE, ATTAINING TO THE WHOLE
MEASURE OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST&quot; (NIV)

now, the key part of these verses, as far as i'm concerned in this
post, is &quot;until we all reach unity of faith&quot;. is Paul, knowingly or
unknowingly, prophecying about the final moments of the end of days?
for i believe that we are experiencing the end of days right now
(exactly how close to the end, obviously nobody knows) in accordance
to Jesus's words in Matthew 24:4-12; Mark 13:5-8; and Luke 21:10-11. i
mean, even modern science has proven that natural disasters are
occurring more frequently than ever before, and plain observation can
see that the wickedness of the world is in a greater quantity than
ever before (i've often heard the argument &quot;well, the people in
ancient Rome did many more wicked things in public than we see in the
streets today, so if the end of the world didn't come with that
wickedness, or even with the Holocaust, then why would it come now?&quot;
well, truth is, the &quot;handful&quot; of the Roman population doesn't even
compare to the billions of people doing wicked things in today's
world, and more people have died in today's world from man-made
disease, pestilence, wars, and pollution than in the Holocaust!). the
point of that little harangue is that Jesus's words are being
fulfilled at this very moment. the main point i wanna make is that we,
as a Church, are qualitatively far from that point in which &quot;we all
reach unity of faith&quot;. but we are being built up (and God does not
start what He will not finish) for that time when we attain &quot;to the
whole measure of the fullness of Christ&quot;. so when will this unity
actually occur? is it something which can only be fulfilled in the
final days? like enemies who are forced to join together against a
greater common enemy, will the Church and all its various
denominations only be able to attain unity when the evil of the world
has reached a magnitude where bickering and trying to convince &quot;other
Christians&quot; on unclear particulars of Doctrine becomes secondary to
actually having unity? will it actually take Jesus coming on the
clouds of the sky (Matthew 24:30; Mark 13:26) for the arms, legs,
eyes, and ears of the body of Christ to realize they should be in
unity as a body? or is Paul simply preaching a &quot;as the Ephesian
church, keep up the good work so that you all will be in agreement
with one another in Christ&quot; type of message and not referring to the
future of the Church?
