What's a good sensible way of making my everyday leather boots more
water resistent?

I used to use Dubbin but it's messy and takes a long time time to get
absorbed.

Are the aerosol waterproofing sprays for shoes any good?  I think they
contain Scotchguard.  They seem almost too easy to be good!

Buy a litre of castor oil from the chemist: pour into one boot.  Leave
for several days until it's seeping out through the stitching holes.
Pour into the other boot and do the same.  Save what's left for redoing
in 10-15 years time...

If they are not dress shoes of any form, use Waxoyl. Apply when your
shoes are warm (i.e. immediately after use) and rub in with your
fingers. Works a treat - use the rest of the can on the car!

first boot.

Thompson's Water Seal, or indeed any silicone based equivalent eg
Wickes own brand.

Read the info on the tin - it does indeed state (at least on the
Thompson's tin) that it's for fabric and leather. And as it's sold as
a building product, while it's not cheap, it is *very considerably*
cheaper than proofing products found in camping and outdoor shops.

Hope this helps

It is: and cheap.  It worked perfectly well with Alan's boots (still in
occasional use after about 30 years, and still waterproof after their
second soaking), and my old leather boots (similar age, but retired on
comfort grounds, but still perfectly warterproof last time my son wore
them a couple of years back).

I've used Hydroblock for years now, or the Scarpa equivalent, HS12 I
think, and never had leaking boots, even walking in long wet grass,

Mineral oil&gt; vaseline&gt; candle wax are all basically the same stuff but
with variation in viscosity and melting point. If you don't want the
boots getting sticky in hot weather, the wax end of the scale would be
best. Easily dissolved in white spirit by sealing it in a jar and
placing in hot water for 30 mins or so. This is probably what most of
the fancy products are based on.

It's real.  Odd maybe, but real enough!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Nope!  Waterproof inside and out, so even if you go in the bog up to yer
knees, the boots will survive unscathed.  I say nothing of the socks...
;)  You should not do this to boots that have membranes or fabric
innards: leather all through is what you need to start with.

You just tip the oil back in the bottle and prop the boots upside down
on some newspaper so any unsoaked up oil trickles out.  Might take a few
days...

It doesn't even come off on your socks once it's properly soaked in.
Darkens the leather of the boots is all, and makes it somewhat more pliable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Sort of clean.  Castrol engine oil used to be made from caster oil, and
it smells a little like that, but fainter.  My boots don't smell of
anything very much, and certainly not of feet!  :D  Remember, old
fashioned oilskin that fishermen used to wear were made of leather
soaked in oil, before rubber coatings for canvass came along.

Hehehehehe!  Experiment with an old pair.  Alan's old boots are Monte
Rosas.  Dunno what mine are...  Lost in the mists of time and moves!

But if you put your feet in them first, you'll not need so much oil! If
you then walk in them full of oil, the oil will get massaged into the
inside of the boots.

Ideally clean them with saddle soap (horsey shop, a few quid) as this
helps to lubricate the leather. it also gets it clean.

Then apply a water-resistant dressing. Nikwax or G-wax soft paste
waxes (any outdoor shop) are about the best overall for performance,
accessibility and cleanliness when applied. They're sticky at first,
but wait a minute and just buff lightly with a duster.

Neatsfoot oil or dubbin are not a good idea. Neatsfoot doesn't work
well and goes off in long-term storage. Dubbin is (as you note) filthy
stuff.

Nope. Castrol type R oil was made from castor oil and had this
distinctive smell (and laxative effect from breathing it), but not the
usual Castrol oils. Unless you're into old racing motorbikes, I doubt
very much if you've smelt the castor-based Castrols.

Well I'm not into old racing motobikes, but Castrol-R was also used in
aircraft and model aircraft. So I've certainly had the pleasure of
smelling it.

Actually Kate is right Castrol engine was was made with Castor Oil, in fact
the name Castrol is a contraction of Castor Oil.

As well as Castrol R there are a number of Castrol products that still use
it

Castrol A747 2 stroke is made using Castor Oil

as is Castrol B353 SAE40 engine oil, Castrol M Competition oil and Castrol
R40. I'm not sure if their Classic range is still Castor based without
looking.

before you do that ensure the midsole/ insole is not of a fibre composite
material that is quite common on cheaper boots and is likely to be damaged
by soaking in oil. Most modern outdoors type  boots have a waterproof
interlayer Gortex Sympatex TPU etc which requires no treatment and having
spent years out on the moors ( not all at once ;-) ) I am glad they
have -coatings and treatments do work but constant abrasion compromises them
quite quickly.

Dad flew Vulcans at Waddington in the late 50's.  We lived in a prefab
hut type house, about 200 yards from rotation point.  The end wall fell
out of the padre's house one morning, and they came along with some 6&quot;
nails, a large hammer, and some tar-paper 'selotape' and stuck it back
up.  It was very funny seeing into his living room like a 3D picture.

Dad later flew Canberra PR9's in Malta, went on to Phantoms (228 OCU at
Conningsby, then squadrons there and Germany), back to Canberras during
a supposed ground tour (did as much flying then as he did on his last
Canberra flying tour), and has, unfortunately, been fertilizing a rose
garden for the last 25 years.

What an awesome sight they were. We once had a flypast of a pair, at
Warton, some time ago. I hope Lord Tebbit gets the last one back in the air.

All this reminds me of the bombing run to the Falkland Isles.
Originally, there were to be 2 Vulcans going to do the bombing run,
supported by, IIRC, 17 Victor tankers (I must have worked on most of
them modifying them from V bombers to flight refuelling tankers from
1974 to 1978) The tankers went out, refuelling themselves and the one
remaining Vulcan (the second one went sick just before flight and I'm
not sure if one of the tankers went sick as well). It still makes me
shudder at the tremendous effort of sending all those aircraft just to
put a bomb crater on that runway. Big brother is watching you  ??

condition for their age. We up-graded several system and in particular,

We had a couple of them at Warton. I'll never forget someone who worked
on them telling me that they got held weather for one flight. It was
summer and there was not a cloud in the sky. They were doing early
development for Tornado F3 radar and needed the clouds. I didn't work on
them though.

What a shame. I'll bet he would be surprised to see them still flying
many years later. Looks like they were finally retired in 2006.  :-(

You mean putting just ONE bomb crater on that runway... ;-) all the others

I was still working on them (and other cold-war hangovers) in 1996. I
was gutted to see one of the Buccaneers I had worked on gutted and
placed as a lawn ornament. It's shown on Google Maps.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What's a good sensible way of making my everyday leather boots
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more water resistent?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to use Dubbin but it's messy and takes a long time time to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get absorbed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are the aerosol waterproofing sprays for shoes any good?  I think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they contain Scotchguard.  They seem almost too easy to be good!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Buy a litre of castor oil from the chemist: pour into one boot.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Leave for several days until it's seeping out through the stitching
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; holes. Pour into the other boot and do the same.  Save what's left
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for redoing in 10-15 years time...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How long does it take the oil to dry before you can use the boots?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dave

&gt;&gt;&gt; Few days...  Depends on the leather and how dry it was when you put
&gt;&gt;&gt; the oil in, I suppose.  I never timed it.  We just did it when there
&gt;&gt;&gt; was a few weeks break in the walking.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for that.

&gt;&gt; The reason I asked is that I wanted to take up walking again in 1999.
&gt;&gt; The boots I bought were very stiff, so I applied the oil on the
&gt;&gt; outside to make the leather more supple. It didn't work  :-(

&gt;&gt; Dave

&gt; Dig them out, clean off any remaining old treatment with saddle soap,
&gt; and try the Castor oil.
">

I will try to add some background to this tale . . .

The Castor Oil method is ancient. I came across it in the Sixties
reading Walter Poucher's &quot;The Lakeland Peaks&quot;.  It should be noted that
he was talking about nailed boots, who's construction was exclusively
leather.  I used it on my old Scarpa Monte Rosa's, which had Vibram
soles and a wooden shank, but otherwise no &quot;modern&quot; components - no
fancy liner, no Gore-Tex, and no treatment already applied to the leather.

It makes the leather, and the boots, much more supple, easing any
fitting problems but reducing the support you would otherwise get from
stiff leather.

It makes the leather completely waterproof - all the spaces where water
might soak in are now filled with oil.  By treating the leather from the
inside out, you are certain that the proofing is thorough.  As far as I
remember, after pouring out all the oil the boots were left for a few
days for the remaining oil to soak in.  The first few walks did leave me
with slightly oily socks, but they were wool to start with and didn't
suffer.

I haven't used the same method on my new Scarpa XL's - the leather is
pre-treated with Hydrobloc, and I have continued to use that.

If the castor oil method was used on Gore-Tex lined boots, the liner
would become impervious, blocked by the oil, and at the same time it
would prevent the oil from reaching the leather outer.  However my
considered opinion is that the result would be more durable than the
Gore-Tex sock alone, which *always* fails, usually within a few months.

Using castor oil in boots with any kind of sock liner e.g. Cambrelle,
will result in oil-soaked liners and oily socks, for a while.  Messy,
but otherwise nothing more than inconvenient.

Interestingly, Poucher recommends a snug fit at the ankle, not for
sideways support but to stop the toes being forced into the toecap on
the descent.  He is strongly in support of &quot;supple uppers&quot; - no need for
ankle support is mentioned.

&gt; So is there anything special about castor oil or would olive oil do?
">

Olive oil usually has more of the organic bits of the fruit in it, which
go rancid.  It also tends to be a LOT more expensive.  However, if you
have access to fully refined olive oil, you could try it.  I make no
claims for it's success.
