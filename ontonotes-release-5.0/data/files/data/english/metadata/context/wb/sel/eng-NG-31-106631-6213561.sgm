Dear members,

5th January 2007 11:24

A seven-year-old British boy has been killed in
Thailand after being electrocuted during an
attempt to plug the mains-charger for his
Nintendo Game Boy into a hotel power socket.

The incident took place on Saturday, but
details have only now been released following
an investigation carried out by local police.
The victim was named as Connor O'Keefe, 7.

Officers said the boy's death was an accident
caused because Connor was still wet after a
dip in the pool of the hotel at which he and
his parents were staying. Police believe he
either plugged in the power adaptor or
attempted to remove it. Either way, water
from his body made contact with the
electricity supply with fatal consequences.

Police said the boys hotel, the Sunset Beach
Hotel in Patong Beach, Phuket, was not to
blame for the accident.

I respect most peoples opinions and the freedom of
speech, this is why I must show some disgust at the
first half of Jorges' statement. I understand moisture
and ohms laws don't mix and one should avoid
electrical devices when wet, but that is no reason to
celebrate the consequences of the mindless enthusiasm
of childhood. You have probably done other dangerous
things as a child and didn't know or think it was
dangerous (heaven knows, I've done a few). My heart
goes out to the family for losing someone so young in
such a meaningless manner.

That's awful, but it's the kid's fault for not drying off.
