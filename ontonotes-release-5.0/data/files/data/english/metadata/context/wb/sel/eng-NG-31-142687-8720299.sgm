One question is: do you personally feel safer from Muslim terrorism attacks
post 9/11 after Bush
has carried the war to the Muslim terrorist nations of Taliban Afghanistan
and Saddam Hussein's
Iraq?

The other question is, are you better or worse off economically than you
were in 2000 when the
Clinton dot-com bubble was bursting and the Enron scandal was about to
erupt?

If your answer to these two quesstions, perhaps evne just one of them, is
yes, then you should stick
with right-wing Republicans\ in the 2008 election..

(Angus Reid Global Monitor) - Many people in the United States believe their
country's military involvement in Iraq is making them more vulnerable to a
new terrorist attack, according to a poll by CBS News. 46 per cent of
respondents think the Iraq war is creating more terrorists who are planning
to harm the U.S., up two points since July.

Conversely, 18 per cent of respondents think being in Iraq is helping
eliminate terrorists who might be planning to attack the U.S.

Experts say that our war on Iraq will costs us over 2 trillion dollars
by the time all of the long term costs are paid.  Just think of all
that military equipment that has to be replaced or repaired, and all
the disabled veterans who have to be taken care of for the rest of
their lives, and the long term economic costs caused by distortions to
the oil markets, which are not even represented in the 2 trillion
dollar figure.

Our own intelligence community has said the war in Iraq has been a
boon to terrorist organization all over the world.  It has made
terrorists groups stronger, more motivated, and more numerous.  It has
weakened our military, created a huge budget deficit, and led to a
major degradation of our military and civilian infrastructure which
cannot be sustained.  We are wasting billions of dollars of national
wealth every week on a war that cannot be won, and which should never
have been fought.

Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction.  Iraq had nothing to do with
the 911 attack.  Saddam Hussein never threatened to attack the USA, he
only wanted to sell us more oil at fair prices.  Gas would be selling
for under $2.00 a gallon if were not for our illegal attack on Iraq.

So why did we attack Iraq, if it was clearly not in our national
interests? Because the Jews who control America wanted us to. See
below!

http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/01/10/Sharon3.html

Even Ariel Sharon admitted that Jews control America!

Occupied Jerusalem: 3 October, 2001 (IAP) -- According to Israel radio
(in Hebrew) Kol Yisrael, Shimon Peres warned Ariel Sharon Wednesday
that refusing to heed incessant American requests for a cease-fire
with the Palestinians would endanger Israeli interests and &quot;turn the
US against us.&quot;
At this point, a furious Sharon reportedly turned toward Peres, saying
----

&quot;Every time we do something you tell me Americans will do this and
will do that. I want to tell you something very clear, don't worry
about American pressure on Israel, we, the Jewish people control
America, and the Americans know it.&quot;

The radio said Peres and other cabinet ministers warned Sharon against
saying what he said in public because &quot;it would cause us a public
relations disaster.&quot;
IAP News

Jimmy Carter said it too!

&quot;The Israeli lobby is so powerful that no man could become president
without gaining their support.&quot; - Former US President Jimmy Carter
after leaving office.

George H.W. Bush quote!

&quot;There are powerful forces out there.&quot;  - Former US President George
H.W. Bush, referring to the power of the Israel lobby during a heated
foreign aid dispute after the first Gulf War.  Israel demanded
billions of US taxpayer dollars to expand illegal Jewish settlements
on the West Bank, and Bush refused.  This led to a dispute with the
Israeli lobby, which then helped elect Bill Clinton as president.

Yep.  Clinton had the dot com bubble, Bush has his war.

My guess is that the war has been a substantially more significant
contribution to the economy than the dot com boom could possibly have been;
and the dot com boom wasn't supported by government deficit funding.

What the heck did Iraq have to do with 9/11.  Sick, pathetic fools
like you still insist that Iraq had something to do with 9/11 even
though you can't tell us what it is.

So tell us here and now what Iraq had to do with 9/11?  Did they
finance the job?  Did they supply the man power?  Was al-Qaida base in
Iraq?  No to all the questions.  Sadam hated bin Laden and bin Laden
hated Sadam.  Now if we wanted to attack some one we should have
attacked the Saudis, most of the 9/11 attackers were Saudi.

However facts have never had any thing to do with the far rights
obsession with Iraq.  The far right is composed of cowards, tax
evaders and trailer trash.  This trailer livin, pick up drivin' coward
is typical.  Happy to have some one die for him but he sure doesn't
want that kid coming back wounded, it costs to much!

Saddam Hussein's Iraq may have been a brutal, oppressive and lots of other
shitty things dictatorship, but it was a secular nation.   Far more secular than
the USA is today.  More like France, actually.

Calling Saddam Hussein's Iraq a &quot;Muslim nation&quot; is like calling Republic of the
Congo  a nation of Basketball players because 99% of the people who live there
are Black.

(1) Do I feel safer knowing that we lost as many GIs in combat as we have
lost civilians on 9/11?

What I do feel is that there are people who would not be involved in
terrorism in 2000 but are involved now.

(2) Financially, am I better off?

You cannot be serious.  Bush's 50% devaluation of the USD has taken its toll
on so many areas of the economy, that it is difficult to even begin to
categorize the damage.  It is difficult because it manifests itself in ways
that have yet to be addressed.  Thus far, the 50%+ devaluation of the USD
has caused a mini-crash in the stock market because the Fed almost powerless
to help, except for a meaningless discount rate cut.  The problem is that
it's the fed funds rate that counts, not the discount rate.  The reason is
that any reduction on the Fed funds rate will cause the USD to devalue even
further and do even more damage.

The country is in a financial mess.  $500B wasted in a civil war looking for
WMDs that did not exist.  There are more terrorists than ever before.  I
wish we could appeal the 22nd Amendment and get Clinton back.

I still don't know why there is a 22nd Amendment.  The fact that a leader has no
future sets him up as a lame duck at times and, in the latter days of his
administration, and all sorts of weird stuff (legacy building) goes on as a
result.  Parliamentary democracies don't do it that way.

Gore was no replacement for Clinton.  President Bush 1 wasn't a good one (from a
Conservative view) for Reagan.  Both sides would have benefited in their agendas
if those dudes just remained where they were and the incumbent had ran again.
Reagan (after his 3rd term) would probably have lost to Clinton anyway.

I don't think that Bush would have won in 2000 if he was up against Clinton.

Clinton in '04?  Tough call.  But Dubya?  He'd be working for Halliburton by
then.

Sorry, but the whole exercise was NOT ONLY about WMDs

As to getting Clinton back, I'll remind you that ONLY the EXECUTION of 9/11
took place when Bush was President
All the planning and preparation, as well as the events that gave the
terrorists the idea that they could get away with it, for it took place
under Clinton

&gt; You cannot be serious.  Bush's 50% devaluation of the USD has taken its toll
&gt; on so many areas of the economy, that it is difficult to even begin to
&gt; categorize the damage.  It is difficult because it manifests itself in ways
&gt; that have yet to be addressed.  Thus far, the 50%+ devaluation of the USD
&gt; has caused a mini-crash in the stock market because the Fed almost powerless
&gt; to help, except for a meaningless discount rate cut.  The problem is that
&gt; it's the fed funds rate that counts, not the discount rate.  The reason is
&gt; that any reduction on the Fed funds rate will cause the USD to devalue even
&gt; further and do even more damage.

&gt; The country is in a financial mess.  $500B wasted in a civil war looking for
&gt; WMDs that did not exist.

Conservatives see Liberals as those who are idealists, yet it's the
Conservatives who seem to take reality and bend, distort and play with reality
in an attempt to make it &quot;what it should be&quot; or &quot;an idealist's version of how it
was&quot;.

Conservatives fight like dogs over how a group of 130 prominent doctors and
scientists
have endorsed Vancouver's safe injection site as a success story, reducing the
spread of disease.

Conservatives in Canada believe that imprisoning more of the population instead
of spending more money on crime prevention is the way, despite how the US has 2%
of the world's population, 25% of the world's incarcerated and still has not
reduced their crime rate by any sensible measure.

Conservatives laugh at science.  Pretending that there's a debate about green
house gasses and global warming.  Even when Bush says it's so!

Conservatives believe that Homosexuality is a disease, yet hypocritally accept
Vice President Cheney's daughter as being normal.

Conservatives think that the US health care system is good as it is.

Webster's Dictionary says:

Conservative:

&quot;disposed to preserve existing conditions, institutions, etc., or to restore
traditional ones, and to limit change&quot;

Liberal:

&quot;favorable to progress or reform, as in political or religious affairs.&quot;

It's very difficult to reason with a person who has limited critical
thinking skills and accepts lies and the unbelievable as truth without even
questioning the logic of it.  To blame your own lack of common sense on
&quot;Monday morning quarterbacking&quot; is evidence that critical thinking is not
part of your modus operandi. Did you ever think -- even for one split
moment -- how can an abandoned truck in the Iraqi desert prove there are
WMDs?  Therein lies your problem.

Does it ever bother you that you believe as &quot;real&quot; has already been
repudiated by sources much more reputable than Donald Rumsfeld. Such sources
include Colin Powell and GOP members of the US Senate?

You do not need to believe me in issues concerning the impact of the
devalued US dollar.   Just remember that our economy was strong under
Clinton because Bob Rubin was running Treasury.  Rubin began paying back the
national debt and kept the US dollar strong.

Today the dollar is weak.  The Federal Reserve is helpless to do its job to
help out in times of mini-panics and uncertainties because any interest rate
cut will kill the dollar, if it is not already dead.  The stock market
reflects these fears and will continue to reflect such fears until the mess
is cleaned-up.  The Fed is simply out of tools to do anything now.  These
are going to be dangerous times.  I hope you're not in the stock market.

All the evidence you need concerning financial mismanagement  is at the
gasoline pump.  Have you ever asked how have you benefited with the dollar
losing over 50% of its value relative to other currencies?

Mismanagement of defense and foreign policy is for all to see at the
funerals of our brave young people who died because their government put
them into the cross fire of a civil war of our government's own making.  You
think there's a reason Pres. Bush never attended a GI's funeral?

What could he tell the parents? Not to be a &quot;Monday morning quarterback???&quot;

No surprise?  Tell it to a Gold Star Mother that her kid died for WMDs that
never existed.

As far as your alleged bullshit, did you ever question for even a moment how
is an abandoned truck in the Iraqi desert even remotely related to WMDs?

Thought so...You call my stuff bullshit. But you're the ass that believes
bullshit when it gets spun out of Washington.  It's morons like you that put
this shit into office.  And instead of taking responsibility for over 35,000
kids killed and $500B wasted (that's five hundred billion dollars of money
the government doesn't even have), you call it &quot;Monday morning
quarterbacking.&quot;

Your denials and lack of common sense makes you one big useless piece of

&gt; Our own intelligence community has said the war in Iraq has been a
&gt; boon to terrorist organization all over the world.  It has made
&gt; terrorists groups stronger, more motivated, and more numerous.  It has
&gt; weakened our military, created a huge budget deficit, and led to a
&gt; major degradation of our military and civilian infrastructure which
&gt; cannot be sustained.  We are wasting billions of dollars of national

&gt; Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction.  Iraq had nothing to do with

&gt; (in Hebrew) Kol Yisrael, Shimon Peres warned Ariel Sharon Wednesday
&gt; that refusing to heed incessant American requests for a cease-fire
&gt; with the Palestinians would endanger Israeli interests and &quot;turn the
&gt; US against us.&quot;
&gt; At this point, a furious Sharon reportedly turned toward Peres, saying
&gt; ----

&gt; &quot;Every time we do something you tell me Americans will do this and
&gt; will do that. I want to tell you something very clear, don't worry
&gt; about American pressure on Israel, we, the Jewish people control
&gt; America, and the Americans know it.&quot;

&gt; The radio said Peres and other cabinet ministers warned Sharon against
&gt; saying what he said in public because &quot;it would cause us a public
&gt; relations disaster.&quot;

&gt; Jimmy Carter said it too!

&gt; &quot;The Israeli lobby is so powerful that no man could become president
&gt; without gaining their support.&quot; - Former US President Jimmy Carter

&gt; George H.W. Bush quote!

&gt; &quot;There are powerful forces out there.&quot;  - Former US President George
&gt; H.W. Bush, referring to the power of the Israel lobby during a heated
&gt; foreign aid dispute after the first Gulf War.  Israel demanded
&gt; billions of US taxpayer dollars to expand illegal Jewish settlements
&gt; on the West Bank, and Bush refused.  This led to a dispute with the
&gt; Israeli lobby, which then helped elect Bill Clinton as president.

&gt;&gt; What the heck did Iraq have to do with 9/11.  Sick, pathetic fools

&gt;&gt; though you can't tell us what it is.

&gt;&gt; So tell us here and now what Iraq had to do with 9/11?  Did they

&gt;&gt; Iraq?  No to all the questions.  Sadam hated bin Laden and bin Laden
&gt;&gt; hated Sadam.  Now if we wanted to attack some one we should have
&gt;&gt; attacked the Saudis, most of the 9/11 attackers were Saudi.

&gt;&gt; However facts have never had any thing to do with the far rights

&gt;&gt; is typical.  Happy to have some one die for him but he sure doesn't
&gt;&gt; want that kid coming back wounded, it costs to much!

&gt; Saddam Hussein's Iraq may have been a brutal, oppressive and lots of other
&gt; shitty things dictatorship, but it was a secular nation.   Far more
&gt; secular than the USA is today.  More like France, actually.

&gt; Calling Saddam Hussein's Iraq a &quot;Muslim nation&quot; is like calling Republic

&gt;&gt; (1) Do I feel safer knowing that we lost as many GIs in combat as we have
&gt;&gt; lost civilians on 9/11?

&gt;&gt; What I do feel is that there are people who would not be involved in
&gt;&gt; terrorism in 2000 but are involved now.

&gt;&gt; (2) Financially, am I better off?

&gt;&gt; You cannot be serious.  Bush's 50% devaluation of the USD has taken its
&gt;&gt; toll on so many areas of the economy, that it is difficult to even begin
&gt;&gt; to categorize the damage.  It is difficult because it manifests itself in
&gt;&gt; ways that have yet to be addressed.  Thus far, the 50%+ devaluation of
&gt;&gt; the USD has caused a mini-crash in the stock market because the Fed
&gt;&gt; almost powerless to help, except for a meaningless discount rate cut.
&gt;&gt; The problem is that it's the fed funds rate that counts, not the discount
&gt;&gt; rate.  The reason is that any reduction on the Fed funds rate will cause
&gt;&gt; the USD to devalue even further and do even more damage.

&gt;&gt; The country is in a financial mess.  $500B wasted in a civil war looking
&gt;&gt; for WMDs that did not exist.  There are more terrorists than ever before.
&gt;&gt; I wish we could appeal the 22nd Amendment and get Clinton back.

&gt; I still don't know why there is a 22nd Amendment.  The fact that a leader
&gt; has no future sets him up as a lame duck at times and, in the latter days
&gt; of his administration, and all sorts of weird stuff (legacy building) goes
&gt; on as a result.  Parliamentary democracies don't do it that way.

&gt; Gore was no replacement for Clinton.  President Bush 1 wasn't a good one
&gt; (from a Conservative view) for Reagan.  Both sides would have benefited in
&gt; their agendas if those dudes just remained where they were and the
&gt; incumbent had ran again. Reagan (after his 3rd term) would probably have
&gt; lost to Clinton anyway.

&gt; I don't think that Bush would have won in 2000 if he was up against
&gt; Clinton.

&gt; Clinton in '04?  Tough call.  But Dubya?  He'd be working for Halliburton
&gt; by then.

Totally wrong.  That was *The Lie* W. Bush used to invade Iraq; that

There was also the manipulative statements made by W. Bush, his

This was so wide-spread that even despite statements from the White

What, you can't even remember nation-and-world-wide news reports of W.
Bush's statements from 4+ years ago?

Or do you just change your view of Reality to fit whatever delusional
political beliefs you have?

Of course, having NOT found any WMD, W. Bush has then gone on to
create multiple and constantly changing other &quot;reasons&quot; for the
illegal and needless invasion, including:

2) The removal of Saddam Hussein

3) Making Iraq a democracy.  (Note: When W. Bush first invaded Iraq,
he clearly stated the US would *not* be involved in nation-building.

4) Trying to make Iraq a stable nation (even though the US invasion
cause the now existing civil war that ranges throughout the country).

5) Excuse-of-the-week now.

Never mentioned in all this time was all that oil under Iraq.  Or that
Cheney, Rumsfeld, etc. had been wanting to attack and invade Iraq

Wrong.  It's proven.

*ALL* 16 of the USA's own intelligence agencies released a 90+ page
joint report in April 2006 saying that the Iraq War was creating MORE
terrorists and making American citizens LESS safer.

Last fall, this part of the report was learned by the press and was

it up.

There was a major push to have further information released from this
joint intelligence agencies' report, but W. Bush, liar that he is,
refused to release anything expect for the 4 pages that stated that
the MORE terrorists/LESS safer was indeed true.

I've long wondered what other *BAD* News and HARSH Truths W, Bush was
hiding in those other 86 pages.

Of course, there are also the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's very difficult to reason with a person who has limited critical
&gt; thinking skills and accepts lies and the unbelievable as truth without
&gt; even questioning the logic of it.  To blame your own lack of common sense
&gt; on &quot;Monday morning quarterbacking&quot; is evidence that critical thinking is
&gt; not part of your modus operandi. Did you ever think -- even for one split
&gt; moment -- how can an abandoned truck in the Iraqi desert prove there are
&gt; WMDs?  Therein lies your problem.

&gt; Does it ever bother you that you believe as &quot;real&quot; has already been
&gt; repudiated by sources much more reputable than Donald Rumsfeld. Such
&gt; sources include Colin Powell and GOP members of the US Senate?

&gt; You do not need to believe me in issues concerning the impact of the
&gt; devalued US dollar.   Just remember that our economy was strong under
&gt; Clinton because Bob Rubin was running Treasury.  Rubin began paying back
&gt; the national debt and kept the US dollar strong.

&gt; Today the dollar is weak.  The Federal Reserve is helpless to do its job
&gt; to help out in times of mini-panics and uncertainties because any interest
&gt; rate cut will kill the dollar, if it is not already dead.  The stock
&gt; market reflects these fears and will continue to reflect such fears until
&gt; the mess is cleaned-up.  The Fed is simply out of tools to do anything
&gt; now.  These are going to be dangerous times.  I hope you're not in the
&gt; stock market.

Fact: Clinton despite thinking having a woman suck on his penis while she
had a mint in her mouth was not sex managed to balance the budget. Bush who
says GOD speaks to him runs huge defecits. In Canada many ppl believe the
loony should fall in order to help the manufacturing sector. Perhaps if the
US dollar slides versus other countries that will help the US manufacturers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And naturally, you can back up this claim of 50% devaluation with some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hard data ?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    Or is it just another &quot;feeling&quot; that you're &quot;feeling&quot; ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; When Clinton left office the Euro was $0.87.  today $1.37

&gt;&gt;&gt; (1.37 - 0.87)/0.87 =   57.4%

&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you should petition your local school board to re-take the sixth
&gt;&gt;&gt; grade.  Maybe you will learn to calculate percentages.

&gt;&gt; And what ?
&gt;&gt;    Are you trying to pretend that currency values are pegged directly to
&gt;&gt; each other, and that other issues are of no effect ?
&gt;&gt; Were that so, speculating on currency would be a very simple thing and
&gt;&gt; you would be the richest man on the planet instead of some idiot spouting
&gt;&gt; ignorant cant

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, but the whole exercise was NOT ONLY about WMDs

&gt;&gt;&gt; You know something that Bush didn't know?  How about using your
&gt;&gt;&gt; intelligence to illuminate us.

&gt;&gt; Obviously you've had your head up your ass for the last 5 years
&gt;&gt; Well Let's see
&gt;&gt;    Saddam was giving aid to terrorists and terrorist organizations
&gt;&gt;    Saddam was NOT respecting his deal with either the US or the UN
&gt;&gt;    The Oil for Food scam
&gt;&gt; That's 3 other reasons right there
&gt;&gt;    I'll let you go out and figure out the rest

&gt;&gt;&gt; WMDs were the focus of  that crazy, lie-filled State of the Union in
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2002. Even crazier was that cock and bull story about uranium in Africa.

&gt;&gt; It's always easy to be an Monday Morning quarterback with 20/20 hindsight
&gt;&gt;    And it takes no intelligence at all
&gt;&gt; You're such a classic case of this, it's downright stunning

&gt;&gt;&gt; And then Colin Powell was ordered to lie at the UN... Powell told the UN
&gt;&gt;&gt; that satellite photos of an abandoned truck in the desert which proved
&gt;&gt;&gt; there were WMDs.  I'm sure morons like you bought that story about the
&gt;&gt;&gt; abandoned truck in the desert.

&gt;&gt; Sure he did
&gt;&gt; As I said, Monday Morning quarterback with 20/20 hindsight

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As to getting Clinton back, I'll remind you that ONLY the EXECUTION of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 9/11 took place when Bush was President
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All the planning and preparation, as well as the events that gave the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terrorists the idea that they could get away with it, for it took place
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under Clinton

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush was asleep at the switch reading Mother Goose.  He failed us
&gt;&gt;&gt; miserably as a war president and with this joke you call an economy.

&gt;&gt; You do know that there has been a cure found for BDS (Bush Derangement
&gt;&gt; Syndrome)
&gt;&gt;    And it's not even painfull, and you do NOT need an IQ over 50 for it
&gt;&gt; to work
&gt;&gt; And you do need the cure, because even with Bush out of the White House
&gt;&gt; in a few months you continue to suffer from it UNLESS you get the cure

&gt; though you can't tell us what it is.
">

This is tired straw-man argument.  The case for invading Iraq was never
because of an alleged connection with 9/11 no matter how may times the
left claims that it was.

The case was made around what Iraq might do in the future, with the
primary concern being the risk that Hussein would resume producing nerve
gas or revive his bio-weapons program from the mid 90's and sell those
weapons to AQ or someone of their ilk.   Hussein had no concerns about
such weapons being used (ask the Kurds) and had been a known sponsor of
fundamentalist terror organizations (Hamas).  There was limited evidence
of al Qaeda-Iraq meetings (Zakawi was in Baghdad before the war). And by
the the UN's own reports Iraq had not accounted for all the WMD
materials in their possession.

With hindsight one can argue that Republicans **and** Democrats who
supported the invasion should have known there was no WMD risk, but the
9/11 linkage you claim just wasn't part of the serious debate.
