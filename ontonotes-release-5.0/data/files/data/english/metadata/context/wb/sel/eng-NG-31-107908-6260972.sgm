My excellent Honda dealer fixed my AM radio problem, or so it seems today.
Per 05-005 they installed an upgrade to the coaxial  harness. They said if
this doesn't work there is one more upgrade they will perform. It appears it
is going to work fine at this time. Thanks to Tegger for the help.

Are there any fixes for 05 Honda Accord Hybrid and 06 Odyssey radios?  They
both suck in our cars.  FM and AM.
