Canon 70-300 mm DO IS USM Lens is apparently listed at $1,299 these
days. I remember paying a couple hundred less than that, seems to me,
when I bought it for use with a Canon 20D, to complete a sweep of
focal lengths: 10-22, 18-55, 70-300. I used it quit a bit on the 20D.

That was quite a while back, camera-business-ly speaking: December
2004.

Since then I've added a couple cameras (Canon 350 RebXT, Canon 5D) and
a number of lenses (50mm 1.8 Canon, Tamron 90 Macro, Canon 28-70 2.8L,
Canon 17-40 L, Canon 70-200 2.8L IS, 1.4x and 2.0x Canon Telextenders)
(may be missing one or two; that's all I can think of at the moment).

Any road, yesterday I clapped the 70-300 DO IS on the 5D for the first
time. It works good. I have several better-than-pretty-good images
from a day at the races - actually a couple of autocross practice
sessions at the San Diego Jack Murphy Qualcomm Stadium parking lots.
San Diego SCCA-affiliated to the west, BMW club to the east. Here's a
crop from the 70-300 DO IS:

http://farm1.static.flickr.com/130/409511095_214e919afc_o.jpg

I used the 70-300 on both events, and did the same with the 70-200
2.8L, the latter with the 2x extender as well. So, among the 680
exposures ( filled up two 4GB, one 2GB and one oneGB CF cards ! )
there should be a few good comparisons. I'll work on that.

Meantime, sitting in the sunny patio late this morning I saw a
butterfly flying by. Picked up the 5D/70-300 DO IS combo and stalked
it. Got one decent shot, a raft of half-a-butterflies and some
out-of-focus vegetation. While I was at it (sitting in the sun again)
I did a few exposures that might be of use to anyone considering a
70-300 DO IS Canon for an armory (or do I mean arsenal?)

When looking for a tele lens, I rejected the 70-300 DO IS for two reasons.
High price and average performance at 300mm. Sure it's light, compact and
has IS, but image quality is my prime criteria for selecting lenses. I
visited many test sites and they concluded pretty much the same. high price,
good but uninspiring performance at 300mm.

I can't see spending $1,200 on a lens that does not perform much better than
the consumer versions!

I ended up with the 70-200 f/4L (non IS) and it performs wonderfully. I
bought a cheapo Promaster 1.7x converter just to tinker with uintil I could
get a better TC, but performance with it is reasonable I don't think I'll
forgo the 1.4x right now.

I shot with the 70-300 DO for about a year and have just sold it on eBay.

I got most of my money back.

While I liked the light weight, I was disappointed with the sharpness, even
on a tripod beyond 200mm. It was very soft.

I opted for a 70-200 f4 (non-IS) L model. While it doesn't quite have the
tele-range, the image quality is vastly superior. (IMHO).

&gt; One criterion, two criteria. The singular is &quot;criterion&quot;. This word
&gt; has an irregular plural.

I resisted the impulse; I suppose someone had to do it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes, the DO lens is soft, because of its very expensive and advanced
&gt; DO element. While an ingenious concept, I don't think it is a
&gt; success.
">

This is not resistable: It /is/ a success unless you have extremely
high standards and completely discount the size/weight and/or cost
criteria, among all significant criteria.

While I haven't yet selected comparable demo examples from the similar
shots taken on the same day in (pretty much) the same circumstances
with the 70-300 DO IS and the 70-200 2.8L IS with and without the 2x
teleconverter, my /impression/ is that the "L" lens is sharper and has
more contrast at similar focal lengths.

But I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the 70-300 DO IS for /ordinary/
uses in documenting events in the world. It comes up short for
/exceptional/ uses such as pixel-peeping and commercial submissions
requiring absolutely the sharpest images possible. That is, if it
weren't so expensive.

I wonder how much of their r&amp;d investment Canon have recovered through
sales of DO lenses. I wonder if DO lenses are still in production.

If this one weren't already paid for, I might sell it. If I had
do-overs, and knew what I know now, I believe I would skip it. But it
gives me something I can't get otherwise (with current equipment) (or
that I would be willing to lug around all day) when mounted on the
(second-body) D20 on one shoulder while the 70-200/5D on the other is
principal weapon. Grist for another test, if I remember and can find
time for it.

And that's the truth.

I like my DO lens. On a 20D, it is reasonable to carry over my shoulder
while hiking in the mountains.

I used it almost exclusively during a 3-week vacation in Florida last year.
