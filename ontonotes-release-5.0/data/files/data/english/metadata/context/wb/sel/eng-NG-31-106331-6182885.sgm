This topic is wicked dangerous, and one I single handedly defended in
the MySpace forums for months...

I also know where Ian stands. ;)

Instead of the general question, let me ask this: What do you know of
the history?

Actually... nothing. Or... apparently nothing. I never really paid
attn, and just got the basic jist of religious freaks argueing over
stupid shit (not that its really much different) -- I'm now writing a
paper on the movie Paradise now, religion, and views on the situation
based on religious beliefs...

Ohh isn't it all our fault, or at least the UN's fault after
displaceing some Palstines, and giving that land to the Israelies
after WWII?

Let's start with this...

The people known as Palestinians now, within the last two generations,
were Egyptians, Syrians, Lebanese, and Jordanian.

The problems there began when the Brits overthrew the Ottoman Empire
during WWI. The Ottomans had ruled, in relative peace, an empire
comprised of Muslim, Christian, and Jew, for over 500 years. Before
that, the Romans had originally seized it around 200 AD, displacing
the Jews living there, and renaming Israel and Judah to Syria
Palaestina in order to, by name, redact the rights of the Israelis who
lived there. This was in punishment to the near constant insurrection
against Roman rule by Jewish Zealots.

Fast forward to WWI.

The Turks made the mistake of aligning themselves with powers which
later came to be known as the Axis. Because the Middle East was
considered a tactical strong hold, and bordered the British Empire,
the Brits, overthrew the Ottomans in a series of bloody battles near
the end of WWI, establishing what became known as the Palestinian
Mandate. At this time, there were Palestinians, Christians, and Jews
all living together still.

During this time, the immigration (or return, some say), of Jews to
the area increased drastically, with an influx of 40,000 jews between
1904 and 1914. This was the original root of the conflict, as there
was some racial tension between Jews and Arabic peoples, and the Arabs
living there saw that the potential for this minority to become a
majority existed. Beginning in 1920, racial tensions had begun to
escalate to the point that Jews became the targets of violence by
Arabic people there, culminating in the Great Riot of Hebron in 1929,
in which over 130 Jews were killed during an Arabic uprising in the
city of Hebrom, where Jews had lived uninterrupted for over 1000
years.

Meanwhile, in the western world, the Balfour Mandate was drafted
between British Politicians and Jewish Zionists which "view[ed] with
favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the
Jewish people".

The rise of Nazism in 1933 led to a fifth wave of Aliyah. The
subsequent Holocaust in Europe led to additional immigration from
other parts of Europe. The Jewish population in the region increased
from 83,790 in 1922 to 608,230 in 1945.

In 1939, the British introduced a White Paper of 1939, which limited
Jewish immigration over the course of the war to 75,000 and restricted
purchase of land by Jews, in response to the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in
Palestine (in which many more Jews were targeted and killed). The
White Paper was seen as a betrayal by the Jewish community and
Zionists, who perceived it as being in conflict with the Balfour
Declaration. The Arabs were not entirely satisfied either, as they
wanted Jewish immigration halted completely.

That's a bit of reading, but believe me when I say, that's just the
tip of the iceberg. I realized as I started going through this, that
there is far too much to include here.

Here are a few places to start:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Palestinian_Conflict

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict

There is a lot of reading to do, and some reading between the lines as well.

Actually it is the fault of Lucifer.  =)

There once was a man by the name of Gavrilo Princip.

He was the Serbian Nationalist who shot Archduke Franz
Ferdinand in Sarejevo, Yugoslavia in 1914.

As a result of the assassination, The Austro-Hugarian
Empire declared war on Serbia.  Russia Declared war on
the Austro-Hungarian Empire because it had a treaty
with Serbia. Germany declared war on Russia because it
had a treaty to defend Austro-Hungary.  France
declared war on Germany because it had a treaty to
defend Russia. Germany declared war on France, and
Britain declared war on Germany because they had a
treaty to defend France.

America entered the war to save the Brits and the
Frenchies a**es.

As victors, the English and the French imposed
extremely heavy war reparations on Germany.

As a result of those reparations, Germany went into
tremendous economic depression, which gave rise to
National Socialism.

As the result of  the rise of Hitler and the Nazis,
6,000,000 Jews were exterminated, which gave impetus
to the Zionist movement, and the demand for a Jewish
state.

As the result of the establishment of the state of
Israel, a bunch of Palestinians were displaced and
they revolted.  As a result of the Palistinian Revolt,
the neighboring Arab states came to the aid of the
Palestinians.

The Arab states knowing that they could not get $ from
the US to attack Israel turned to the Soviet Union who
was more than happy to fund anything the Arabs wanted.
So to stem Russian influence in the region, the US
propped up the Shah of Iran, POing many many Shiites
in the process, and you know the rest of the story.

As a result of the Arabs attacking Isreal which had
been created under the UN Charter, The US supplied
Isreal with military aid, with which the Jews kicked
the crap out of the Arabs in the 1967 Arab-Israeli
War. Seeing that the Arab Military was no match for
the Israelis, the po'd Muslim fanatics decided to kill
a few Jews at the '72 Olympics.

Then in 1977 or thereabout Begin and Sadat decided to
bury the hatchet, which PO'd even more fanatics, so
they blew Sadat out of the viewing stand.  In rounding
up those associated with the assasination, the
Egyptian authorities arrested one Iman
al-Zawahiri...and you know the rest of that story.

In 1991, after failing to annex Iran in the Iraq-Iran
War, Iraq invaded Kwait, and the US went in under UN
Sanction to expel them. And stayed in Saudi Arabia
just in case Sadaam tried a third time to take over
another oil rich neighbor.....which PO'd Osama bin
Laden...who didn't think that Infidels should be
allowed on "holy ground"....and you know the rest of
that story.

Now Gavrilo Princip planned all of this from the
beginning.  He and his "Black Hand" buddies sat down
one day and attempted to figure out how to bring about
the Battle of Armageddon.

And it looks like they might succeed.

Gavrilo Princip was the Nom de Guerre of Lucifer.

And now.....you know the rest of the story!  ;)

Namaste
