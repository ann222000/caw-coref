This morning, when I logged on, almost
every message I read had to do with this
newsgroup and the behavior/atmosphere
we &quot;want&quot; on it. I remember the author
of the course asks the question, &quot;What
do you want?&quot; and he asks it more than
once.

=======================

&quot;2824. Do you want freedom of the body,
or of the mind? For both you cannot have.
Which do you value? Which is your goal?
For one you see as means; the other, end.
And one must serve the other, and lead to
its predominance, increasing its importance
by diminishing its own.

&quot;1077. The ego cannot OPPOSE the laws
of God, anymore than YOU can. But it can
INTERPRET them according to what it wants,
just as YOU can. That is why the question
&quot;What DO you want?&quot; must be answered.
You ARE answering it every minute and
every second, and each moment of decision
is a judgment which is anything BUT
ineffectual. Its effects will follow auto-
matically UNTIL THE DECISION IS
CHANGED.&quot;

&quot;2005. WHAT DO YOU WANT? Light
or darkness, knowledge or ignorance
are yours, but not both. Opposites
must be brought together, and not
kept apart.

&quot;2663. One thing is sure; hallucina-
tions serve a purpose, and when that
purpose is no longer held, they
disappear. Therefore, the question
never is whether you want THEM,
but always do you want the purpose
that they serve?

&quot;3016. What, then, IS justified? WHAT
DO YOU WANT? For these two questions
ARE the same, and, when you see them
AS the same, your choice is made. For it
is SEEING them as one that brings release
from the belief there are two ways to see.
This world has much to offer to your peace,
and many chances to extend your own
forgiveness. Such its PURPOSE is, to
those who WANT to see peace and
forgiveness descend on THEM, and offer
THEM the light. The Maker of the world
of gentleness has perfect power to offset
the world of violence and hate that SEEMS
to stand BETWEEN you and His gentleness.
It is not there in His forgiving eyes. And
THEREFORE it need not be there in yours.

=========================

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the posts this morning, the
">

answer SEEMS pretty clear: a peace-
ful virtual &quot;place&quot; in which to discuss
the course.

But we all know that those of us who
want it can have that peaceful place
right here and right now, with any
number of &quot;body&quot; solutions -- moderated
ng, killfile implementation -- or, better
yet, a decision to see things differently.

There are folks here who HAVE made
a choice for a better way, and who may
have also implemented some physical
world solutions. And there are those of
us who have not.

But I think we all know that we are
experiencing what we are because
we want it, and we also know that a
peaceful solution will never arise until
we change our minds.

A problem is only a problem when there
is no solution immediately available.
There is no problem here.

Gee, how many people have had a discussion with a woman with a long
time relationship to a hard core alcoholic?

Person: What do you want?

Woman: I want a nice happy home. I don't want all this fighting. I
don't want the police called every other night. I'm tired of bailing
him out jail. I'm really afraid he going to hurt me. I need my sleep,
so I can work and he's drinking and cursing until all hours of the
morning. I slept in my car the other night just to get away from him.

Person: Yes, but didn't you bail him out of jail the other night for
his 5th DUI?

Woman: Yes, but I let him stay in jail over night. He called me up and
said he learned his lesson and from now on things would be different.
He's so sweet when he's sober. If he would just stop drinking
everything would be all right.

Person: And you called the police again tonight.

Woman: I called to get him thrown out. I can't take it anymore. He's
driving me nuts. They said they couldn't throw him out because he
wasn't threatening me. So they left.

Person: You just said felt he could hurt you. Why didn't you say that
to the police?

Woman. (Silence) Well, I know. I just wanted to scare him and make him
shut up. That why I called the police. But I really want him gone and
he doesn't want to leave. What can I do? I can't do a thing.

Person: Its your house, you're not married, get a restraining order to
have him removed.

Woman: Oh, I don't have time for that. That costs money . . .

Person: How are you going to feel if this guy kills a bus load of
school kids when he's drunk and driving and you just bailed him out of
jail? Would you feel responsible for those kids at all?

Woman: (No answer)

Still... according to the course, there's
only one problem and one solution.

This doesn't mean I'm not in favor of
estabilishing a moderated group or using
the one we have. I am in favor of it.

I just don't see it as a problem because
we could resume gentle course discourse
(love that phrase) right here and right
now while another group is being esta-
blished, if we want to establish another
group.

The solution to the problem, as ANY
of us perceive it, is immediately at
hand.

ROTFLMAO. I wonder what idiots had the bright idea opening spiritual
discussion to any loony tune wacko with an Internet connection, then
somehow expect gentle discussion?

In theory, I guess this should somehow work with &quot;course students,&quot;
but then again, BECAUSE its an open, unmoderated group, you have a
large number of posters who are either not course students, or
marginally course students, because the place so unattractive, its
repels course students.

&quot;We&quot; could have gentle discussion, but who is &quot;we&quot;? And how relevant
is &quot;we,&quot; when the posters who have absolutely no interest in gentle
discussion, rightly consider this forum as much their forum as you do?

Oh, geez. A simple analysis reveals a place divided in purpose, and
entitlement. That's the way it was set up! Its systemic! And set up so
you can't fix it, can't resolve it and can't shut it down. And yet for
some unknown reason you keep expecting you can make the situation
better in theory, when the teachings  of one problem, one solution
also acknowledges a need for a true perception of the problem.

And how would it NOT be the case, that leisure time spent on a wacko
newsgroup pre-occupied by irresolvable pseudo-problems is but the
mind's attempt to perpetuate the apparent separation in various ways?
Which of course is the one problem.

In other words, and clearly, the mind deceives the best intentioned
hearts, because good hearts are not a sufficient condition to heal.

If the argument is this is NOT a forum for course students, but
equally a forum for anti-course tirades and blasts. Then why can't you
acknowledge that and acknowledge that is how TRCM was set up?

Because if you acknowledge this fact, then the solution is readily
apparent. You know, the one solution.

And if you wish a forum for course students, then how is it helpful to
dedicate so much time on a forum which is NOT for course students, but
only purports to be a forum for course students?

~~Another way of looking at it.
Like-minded people enjoy hanging out
together for obvious reasons.  They
choose a time and place. Before long
they get the attention of other folkes who
don't agree - and worse than that - want
to argue AND disrupt civil intercouse.
~~Sure we can dis - re- gard (overlook)
their posts, but to be honest after YEARS
of this kind of non-sense ~~ guidance
just 'may' tell us to come away and find
another place to meet.
~~Nancy, if you were demonstrating that
it was &quot;no problem&quot; to have a discussion
in trcm and NOT get side-tracked by
endless accusations and questions
which are off-topic, I'd probably agree
with you.  But unfortunately that is NOT
the case.  Take a look at ANY number
of threads. 100s of posts TRYING to
leave chaos behind --- or trying to
set the record straight.  It turns into
defense - which calls for attack.
OR we just say &quot;what the ____&quot; and
let the ego run wild. I own that one.
~~I vote for closing this ng down.
Why?  Because w/o some form of
moderation, it welcomes those who
want to mock and disrespect ACIM.
People who do not choose to monitor
their own behavior LOOK for ngs such
as this. Not to close it down is to play
the role of enabler.  Just my opinion.

I have made the suggestion before. Simply interchange the word &quot;world&quot;
for &quot;trc-m&quot;, and we have all the answers.

As a founding father of this newsgroup, I repeat, and assure
you, its purpose has been radically changed from fear to Love
by the Power of the Holy Spirit, the Atonement, from day one.

If one wants to argue the world should be blown up for
a galactic highway to be built, hitch hiker's guide might come in handy.

&gt; want it can have that peaceful place
&gt; right here and right now, with any

&gt; differently.
&gt; There are folks here who HAVE made
&gt; a choice for a better way, and who may
&gt; have also implemented some physical

&gt; us who have not.
&gt; But I think we all know that we are
&gt; experiencing what we are because
&gt; we want it, and we also know that a

&gt; tions serve a purpose, and when that
&gt; purpose is no longer held, they
&gt; disappear. Therefore, the question
&gt; never is whether you want THEM,
&gt; but always do you want the purpose
&gt; that they serve?
&gt; &quot;3016. What, then, IS justified? WHAT
&gt; DO YOU WANT? For these two questions
&gt; ARE the same, and, when you see them
&gt; AS the same, your choice is made. For it is SEEING them as one that
&gt; brings release from the belief there are two ways to see. This world has
&gt; much to offer to your peace, and many chances to extend your own
&gt; forgiveness. Such its PURPOSE is, to
&gt; those who WANT to see peace and
&gt; forgiveness descend on THEM, and offer
&gt; THEM the light. The Maker of the world
&gt; of gentleness has perfect power to offset the world of violence and hate
&gt; that SEEMS to stand BETWEEN you and His gentleness. It is not there in
&gt; His forgiving eyes. And THEREFORE it need not be there in yours.
&gt; =========================
&gt; From the posts this morning, the
&gt; answer SEEMS pretty clear: a peace-
&gt; ful virtual &quot;place&quot; in which to discuss
&gt; the course.
&gt; But we all know that those of us who
&gt; want it can have that peaceful place
&gt; right here and right now, with any
&gt; number of &quot;body&quot; solutions -- moderated
&gt; ng, killfile implementation -- or, better yet, a decision to see things
&gt; differently.
&gt; There are folks here who HAVE made
&gt; a choice for a better way, and who may
&gt; have also implemented some physical
&gt; world solutions. And there are those of
&gt; us who have not.
&gt; But I think we all know that we are
&gt; experiencing what we are because
&gt; we want it, and we also know that a
&gt; peaceful solution will never arise until we change our minds.
&gt; A problem is only a problem when there
&gt; is no solution immediately available.
&gt; There is no problem here.

I agree. Like the idea if I am seeing someone a certain way, it's in
&quot;my mind&quot; and this is where the problem ( and solution) is.

Plonking someone (to me) is nothing to do with them, but everything to
do with me, and the point I'm at trying to resolve my thoughts and feelings
about it.

Also, if you plonk someone permanently, how do you know maybe they
have changed (which, to me, is me changing my mind about them) The course
does say things like the past is over, and every minute we can start again,
and &quot;ask HS for help in seeing it (someone) differently&quot; etc

What's the point of having beliefs that say these things and not at
least attempting to stick to them?

But you do announce it, you write &lt;PLONK&gt; on the bottom of a post
after you respond to it.

Now, if you wrote it, or just did it BEFORE responding, it might have
a differnet, more peaceful effect. But, you get your say in, then killfile
me in case I answer.

I have known you for years, too, and have considered us friends (as I
have said many times) - just that we don't always agree. Which is why I'm
surprised, over and over when I read some of the stuff you write to me (or
to John, etc. about me) I read it in amazement.  And, because it does
continually surprise me when I see this, I tend to react from my feelings
instead of  shifting to HS, or thinking &quot;well, this is how she must really
feel, for whatever reason, it's her choice&quot; and leaveing it at that. Or
plonking you (LOL)

Actually, it still amazes me to see you writing the way you sometimes
do- period. Not just because it's about me.  But, you're only human and can
slip (or be pushed). I must be a really terrible person if I can make
someone like you slip into what seems like meanness and personal attack and
siding with someone else about this (about me)

Should I apologize for making you do this? You seem to believe, as I do,
that *I* am responsible for my own mind and what I decide, see, and how (or
if) I react to it.

If I can't blame how I feel on someone else, how can I accept blame
for this about them?

The course doesn't let us get away with anything (LOL)

I like everyone here and feel I learn from them. Even those who PLONK
me. Which is why it surprises me to read how terrible I'm seen, the evil
troll, only here to cause trouble, and making people wrong (when I feel I'm
always clear that my beliefs, feelings and opinions are mine and anyone
else's are theirs and I'm find with that- you know the &quot;they are just as
right, in what they think, feel and believe&quot;  that's been turned into that
whole think about me being a Nazi Hitler supporter who believes the Jews
should be killed, etc (think about it, what a terrible thing to start about
anyone. The only point of it would be, some nut might start believing it and
track me down and kill me.  And *I* am the reason people want to close this
newsgroup down?  The ego world of illusion must be insane...)

I say this is me, this is how I honestly think, feel and believe. And
people say &quot;you are a horrible person, an evil troll, only here to  hate and
cause trouble and stir up shit and lie and  we can't get rid of you, so we
have to close the newsgroup down because we can't resist seeing you as a
horrible person and reacting to this&quot;

It's like I should do the world (and certainly the internet) a favor,
and  never be around people again. (the lesson &quot;Light and Joy and Peace
abide in me&quot; comes to mind)

I am really such a terrible person, one post from me is the &quot;kiss of
death&quot; to a discussion group?  Even ones supposedly based on A Course in
Miracles?

I am actually worse than Katie? Because Katie feels the same way the
&quot;course students&quot; do about me here?

No, not feeling sorry for myself, just trying to clarify it and get it
straight. And see h ow it someway/anyway relates to ACIM. The only thing I
can see is, &quot;I AM responsible for what I see, my thoughts, etc...&quot;

And, if I don't post on this newsgroup, somene else is quickly picked to
replace me.

Its taken me a long time to killfile people, too. but mainly because
it's a waste of time to keep reading the same stuff, same insults, same
words, about the same stuff, over and over.

And I really do have so much more I could be doing. Like so many, I keep
getting drawn back here. Either an addiction, or &quot;for the lessons&quot;.

So much potential here. I think the main lesson I come here to learn is
to learn the lessons, without the need to talk about them. It always seems
to come down to that.

~ROTFLMAO. Yeah, well lets say you are not the only one suffering this
delusion.

Did it ever occur to you that the whole idea of a open newsgroup,
inviting anti-course trolls, actively promoting and encouraging
religious bigotry and tolerance of crimes like cyber stalking is
&quot;uncoursey.&quot;

Did you ever consider the newsgroup was unethical and repulsive?

Did you ever consider that promoting and continuing a blatantly
unethical situation is itself unethical?

Did it ever occur to you that tolerance and acceptance of religious
bigotry, homophobic remarks, hate campaign indistinguishable from
cyber stalking, etc, does NOT puts you in the position of admirable
tolerance, but rather opens your actions to scrutiny and the complaint
of encouraging and enabling the unethical by social acceptance of the
unethical?

In fact, it hard to ignore that TRCM is a textbook example of
attempting to make normal and mainstream the type of behavior that
&quot;hate laws,&quot; are meant to prevent. Hell, the behavior is so &quot;normal,&quot;
we have spiritual discussions with the perps.

So lets say your idea of &quot;coursey,&quot; is hardly everyone idea of
coursey.

And this of course, has a detrimental effect in the larger world for
people fighting bigotry, homophobia, religious intolerance and cyber
stalking.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;2824. Do you want freedom of the body,
&gt; &gt;&gt; or of the mind? For both you cannot have. Which do you value? Which is

&gt; &gt;&gt; For one you see as means; the other, end. And one must serve the other,

&gt; &gt;&gt; what it wants, just as YOU can. That is why the question &quot;What DO you
&gt; &gt;&gt; want?&quot; must be answered.
&gt; &gt;&gt; You ARE answering it every minute and

&gt; &gt;&gt; or darkness, knowledge or ignorance

&gt; &gt; Fine. Close it down. This will take

ROTFLMAO.  Yeah, Carrie. You always sound so appreciative. You have
your own meaning for words. And generally they are the polar opposite
of what everyone else means by the word.

So its not surprising that what you think the course teaches you is
often the polar opposite of commonly accepted course teachings.

There's little doubt in my mind that the above statement is the type
of contempteous bait, fabricated out of a completely self-serving
Carrie lie, and conceived by a mind who still thinks the Nazis were as
right as the Jews.

Since everything has one unified purpose

this argument advocates the closing down

ROTFLMAO.

Oh, geez, no one can close the local crack house because its a
microcosm of the world and that would be counter to the unified
purpose of Atonement. And any way God doesn't monitor crack use,
that's our responsibility.

Loony tunes.

Gee, did any think that the Atonement is closing down the world of
perception for Heaven? That is so simple it might actually make sense.

~Really? Hardly pointing to someone or absolving claims of authorship
else when it was posted on this board and anyone can find it.

There was no pointing to anyone else. That would mean posting the
essay under someone's name that didn't write the essay. I suggested
describing the author as another course student on another group,
because I'm not writing course essays to tout my own horn. If someone
wished to discover the author, I'm sure that wouldn't be hard to do.

&gt;&gt; Where have you gotten this idea? I've
&gt;&gt; plonked two posters in my entire history
&gt;&gt; on this group -- only one permanently.

&gt;&gt; I don't like to put folk on killfile, because
&gt;&gt; it's essentially turning my back on them.
&gt;&gt; It seems... &quot;un-coursey&quot;.

&gt;      I agree. Like the idea if I am seeing someone a certain way, it's in
&gt; &quot;my mind&quot; and this is where the problem ( and solution) is.

&gt;      Plonking someone (to me) is nothing to do with them, but everything
&gt; to do with me, and the point I'm at trying to resolve my thoughts and
&gt; feelings about it.

&gt;      Also, if you plonk someone permanently, how do you know maybe they
&gt; have changed (which, to me, is me changing my mind about them) The course
&gt; does say things like the past is over, and every minute we can start
&gt; again, and &quot;ask HS for help in seeing it (someone) differently&quot; etc

&gt;      What's the point of having beliefs that say these things and not at
&gt; least attempting to stick to them?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not
&gt;&gt;&gt; alone in that drama. Obviously, I do it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And so do others. It is difficult to remain
&gt;&gt;&gt; silent when outrageous statements are
&gt;&gt;&gt; made about me, others and/or the Course.

&gt;&gt; Okay. But you need to remember that
&gt;&gt; others are not responsible for your
&gt;&gt; reaction to them. You are. And you
&gt;&gt; are totally in control of your experience
&gt;&gt; here, as are we all. We have had
&gt;&gt; a moderated group available for years.
&gt;&gt; Still we have chosen to come here.

&gt;           YES

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the time is nearing for me to
&gt;&gt;&gt; distance myself.

&gt;&gt; Then... do. It's as easy as pie. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kay... there IS no problem. There is an
&gt;&gt;&gt; established moderated forum in existence at the moment and the only ones

&gt;&gt;&gt; ~~
&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Of course we keep ourselves here.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I LIKE most of the posters here and
&gt;&gt;&gt; will miss them if I choose to move on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine. Close it down. This will take
&gt;&gt;&gt; months. And what do you plan to do
&gt;&gt;&gt; until the task is accomplished? Hang
&gt;&gt;&gt; around here and haggle with Carrie?
&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes no sense to me.
&gt;&gt;&gt; n.
&gt;&gt;&gt; - - - - - -

&gt;&gt;&gt; ~I don't know how to close it down.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But since several posters have
&gt;&gt;&gt; addressed the possibility, I chose
&gt;&gt;&gt; to start a separate thread.
&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as what I plan to do, time will
&gt;&gt;&gt; tell. Once again,  I have ceased
&gt;&gt;&gt; my 'haggle with Carrie.&quot;

&gt;     That's good to hear.

&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But why
&gt;&gt;&gt; point a finger at me?

&gt;&gt; This isn't pointing a finger. It's a fact.
&gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have
&gt;&gt;&gt; been going round with her for
&gt;&gt;&gt; days and weeks.

&gt;&gt; I've known Carrie for years, and I find
&gt;&gt; a lot of good in her. I realize that she
&gt;&gt; does not return my regard. That is not
&gt;&gt; important to me. Periodically, I get
&gt;&gt; fed up and plonk her. I don't feel it's
&gt;&gt; necessary to announce it.

&gt;      But you do announce it, you write &lt;PLONK&gt; on the bottom of a post
&gt; after you respond to it.

&gt;      Now, if you wrote it, or just did it BEFORE responding, it might have
&gt; a differnet, more peaceful effect. But, you get your say in, then killfile
&gt; me in case I answer.

&gt;      I have known you for years, too, and have considered us friends (as I
&gt; have said many times) - just that we don't always agree. Which is why I'm
&gt; surprised, over and over when I read some of the stuff you write to me (or
&gt; to John, etc. about me) I read it in amazement.  And, because it does
&gt; continually surprise me when I see this, I tend to react from my feelings
&gt; instead of  shifting to HS, or thinking &quot;well, this is how she must really
&gt; feel, for whatever reason, it's her choice&quot; and leaveing it at that. Or
&gt; plonking you (LOL)

&gt;    Actually, it still amazes me to see you writing the way you sometimes
&gt; do- period. Not just because it's about me.  But, you're only human and
&gt; can slip (or be pushed). I must be a really terrible person if I can make
&gt; someone like you slip into what seems like meanness and personal attack
&gt; and siding with someone else about this (about me)

&gt;    Should I apologize for making you do this? You seem to believe, as I
&gt; do, that *I* am responsible for my own mind and what I decide, see, and
&gt; how (or if) I react to it.

&gt;      If I can't blame how I feel on someone else, how can I accept blame
&gt; for this about them?

&gt;      The course doesn't let us get away with anything (LOL)

&gt;       I like everyone here and feel I learn from them. Even those who
&gt; PLONK me. Which is why it surprises me to read how terrible I'm seen, the
&gt; evil troll, only here to cause trouble, and making people wrong (when I
&gt; feel I'm always clear that my beliefs, feelings and opinions are mine and
&gt; anyone else's are theirs and I'm find with that- you know the &quot;they are
&gt; just as right, in what they think, feel and believe&quot;  that's been turned
&gt; into that whole think about me being a Nazi Hitler supporter who believes
&gt; the Jews should be killed, etc (think about it, what a terrible thing to
&gt; start about anyone. The only point of it would be, some nut might start
&gt; believing it and track me down and kill me.  And *I* am the reason people
&gt; want to close this newsgroup down?  The ego world of illusion must be
&gt; insane...)

&gt;   I say this is me, this is how I honestly think, feel and believe. And
&gt; people say &quot;you are a horrible person, an evil troll, only here to  hate
&gt; and cause trouble and stir up shit and lie and  we can't get rid of you,
&gt; so we have to close the newsgroup down because we can't resist seeing you
&gt; as a horrible person and reacting to this&quot;

&gt;    It's like I should do the world (and certainly the internet) a favor,
&gt; and  never be around people again. (the lesson &quot;Light and Joy and Peace
&gt; abide in me&quot; comes to mind)

&gt;   I am really such a terrible person, one post from me is the &quot;kiss of
&gt; death&quot; to a discussion group?  Even ones supposedly based on A Course in
&gt; Miracles?

&gt;   I am actually worse than Katie? Because Katie feels the same way the
&gt; &quot;course students&quot; do about me here?

&gt;   No, not feeling sorry for myself, just trying to clarify it and get it
&gt; straight. And see h ow it someway/anyway relates to ACIM. The only thing I
&gt; can see is, &quot;I AM responsible for what I see, my thoughts, etc...&quot;

&gt;    And, if I don't post on this newsgroup, somene else is quickly picked
&gt; to replace me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Same with Katie
&gt;&gt;&gt; and Chuck.

&gt;&gt; Katie is killfiled. Only one is necessary.
&gt;&gt; I find no reason whatsoever to killfile
&gt;&gt; Chuck. I enjoy corresponding with
&gt;&gt; him. Why are you including him?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You plonk them and
&gt;&gt;&gt; turn around and it's the same ole
&gt;&gt;&gt; same ole.

&gt;&gt; No I don't. It took me a LONG time
&gt;&gt; to killfile Katie. And it took a couple
&gt;&gt; of tries (two, I think) before it stuck.
&gt;&gt; But that has been in place for awhile.

&gt;     Its taken me a long time to killfile people, too. but mainly because
&gt; it's a waste of time to keep reading the same stuff, same insults, same
&gt; words, about the same stuff, over and over.

&gt;    And I really do have so much more I could be doing. Like so many, I
&gt; keep getting drawn back here. Either an addiction, or &quot;for the lessons&quot;.

&gt;   So much potential here. I think the main lesson I come here to learn is
&gt; to learn the lessons, without the need to talk about them. It always seems
&gt; to come down to that.

out that in your opinion, the author in word and deed advocates

LOL, btw, the essay was received with gratitude and merrited
a couple of thought provocing responses. Here is what I posted:

========================

Hi Fam,

For some time now, I have pondered what the terms &quot;dualism/non-dualism&quot;
really have to do with the Course. It seems the material itself speaks of
'perception' (--&gt;healed perception) &lt;-/-&gt; 'Knowledge'.

A fine example of explaing core principles of the Course as &quot;non-dualism&quot; is
embedded in the following conclusion:

&quot;... though we speak of one God and His one Son, in truth there is only the
One. Even the Trinity-Father, Son (Christ), and Holy Spirit-is a set of
symbols, for there is no differentiation or distinction within the Godhead
of truth.&quot; ~Ken Wapnick (lighthouse 6-06)

In my study and inquiry into this, I found the dismissal of the Trinitarian
Godhead as merely symbolism to be a serious barrier to understanding and
accepting the Atonement. Because, with no differentiation and distinction
between Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the question must be: *who* is actually
sleeping and dreaming, and awakening? It must mean that if the Son is
dreaming, the Father and the Holy Spirit are as well. The Atonement would be
rendered useless, and God Himself would be split.

It further occured to me that very likely, only the &quot;dualistic&quot; mind trapped
in perception can think of a &quot;non-dualistic&quot; God, by which it clearly tries
to maintain a radically &quot;dualistic&quot; view of God and itself. I'd be
interested to know how others here would reflect on the notion that the
Trinity is merely symbolic, while, on the other hand, the text even speaks
of the separation as *not* being symbolic.

785. &quot;The Separation is NOT symbolic. It is an order of reality, or a system
of thought that is PERFECTLY real in time, though not in Eternity. All
beliefs are real to the believer.&quot;

For the sake of a broader take on this, I attach below what another course
student, on another list, in another discussion has worded on what is called
the &quot;crazy God take on ACIM.&quot;

Thanks for any thoughts and inspirations on this.
namazté

&lt;quote&gt; So God's Mind is the one having illusions?

The crazy God take on ACIM.

Little problem here for non-dualists.

How can a non-dualistic God have an illusion? The whole purpose of the
concept of non-dualism is illusions are not possible. Illusions create
dualism. Clearly a non-dualistic God and illusions cannot co-exist in the
same God. If you claim that this is possible then you just refuted your
notion of non-dualism applied to God.

Nor does it help to argue that a non-dualistic God can dream illusions while
recognizing nothing happened at all.

1) The Course clearly states God establishes reality. So in Course terms God
cannot dream of illusion. First God cannot &quot;dream,&quot; in the sense of
mis-creating an alternative to His Reality without establishing this
alternative reality as Reality.

In other words, and in course terms, God the Father --the prime creator
establishes Reality, and God the Son cannot establish Reality, but rather is
subordinate to the Reality established by the Son's creator,-- God, The
Father. Clearly then if either God can dream of illusions, or the Son can
establish Reality the separation is REAL, and not apparent. Which is why the
Course has a Trinitarian Godhead, and does not reduce everything to a
dreaming God.

If you are saying, God is dreaming the illusion, then you are offering a
Course interpretation counter to a direct reading of ACIM, and in fact
counter to the direct teaching of these reading. That is the authority
problem, or the belief that you created yourself.

2) Given that one interprets the Course as, &quot;God is dreaming the illusion,&quot;
such a proponent cannot meaningful talk about Atonement, Forgiveness, the
authority problems and in fact talk meaningfully about a text which is
predicated on the reader as &quot;The Son of God.&quot; Rather such an interpretation
makes the Course text a useful or holy lie, and largely metaphor or &quot;The
truth,&quot; written in dualistic language.

Yet we see proponents of the &quot;dreaming, crazy God,&quot; interpretation, teach
that God needs salvation from conditions God established Himself. In other
words, if God wishes to dream of &quot;duality,&quot; then awaken from the dream of
&quot;duality&quot;, how does any effort on the part of HIS dream figures such as
forgiveness, alignment of will, or seeking at- one-ment, doing exercises,
training the mind, etc, have any merit at all but as metaphors within the
dream of God?

In short, why teach &quot;forgiveness,&quot; when it is certainly not necessary for an
illusion of God to realize it is an illusion of God, if the purpose is for
God to awaken from His dream of duality?

As such and clearly, if John, Robin or Gene are the dream figures of God,
how are illusions by definition, going to effect an awakening of God? On the
contrary, this notion simply re-enforce the notion of a crazy God which will
remain crazy.

Nor is this resolved by patching the notion that &quot;God knows his dreams are
not real.&quot; Clearly then if God knows his illusions and dreams are not real,
then no effort on the part of the reader/dream figure is needed.

In other words, if the dreaming God knows His illusions and dream figures
are not real, then how is this meaningfully translated to the reader/student
awakening to the understanding he is God?

On the contrary, the reader/student is not awakening to anything, rather
simply waiting to be NOT dreamed by God, and therefore NOT exist. Which is
the implication of the &quot;dream of God.&quot;

Which in turn, begs the contention that somehow the reader/student is God.
And therefore will continue to exist after the dream of God, --as God.

In conclusion, The notion the reader/student is God, rather than the Son of
God is fraught with philosophical problems, which in turn demands either
&quot;dualistic,&quot; metaphorical explanations, or an irrational act of faith,
because what is claimed is going on cannot be rationally explained.

If God is dreaming the dream, and thus God is insane, then escape from the
dream in terms of Atonement is impossible because the Atonement is
predicated on God the Father establishing the Reality of Love, and the Son
incapable of altering this established Reality. Escape from the dream is
thus impossible or speculated as &quot;awakening,&quot; in a way contrary and alien to
a direct reading of the text, while rejecting the course's own notion of
Atonement.

Moreover, and to the point, its difficult to understand why this &quot;crazy God
interpretation is somehow superior to a straight reading of ACIM. The fact
is it is not a superior interpretation but rather a much inferior
interpretation.&quot; &lt;unquote&gt;

~~In another thread, John used the example
of trying to reconcile things that are
irreconcilible. I finally got it!  It's like having
the radio on a rap music station when in
fact you don't want to listen to those
vibrations. The simple 'intelligent' thing
to do is change the station. If you want
to check it periodically to see if they
are playing different music - well do so.
But don't be surprises if nothing has
changed. ;-))

What has to &quot;change&quot;?

The way I understand it, and I know I'm told I DON'T understand it. it's
my mind that has to change, in order to see someone else in a different way.

That, and &quot;forgiveness&quot; (for what my brother didn't do? - for myself for
thinking he/she DID do something wrong?)  and letting go of the past,
grievences, and all that.

I think the confusion that comes up about any of this, and it being
course related is when we (humans who believe we are in separate bodies that
are real (LOL)  start trying to apply it to someone else &quot;out there&quot;

If this is having the course wrong and not understanding it, I guess
I have it wrong and don't understand it, but it seems right, and makes sense
to me.

Maybe it's a life lesson for us Sagittarians that people don't
always (usually) want or need to know &quot;the truth&quot;  (as we see it) and, as
Gene told me one time, nobody cares how you think, feel and believe here.

Not a shabby lesson.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where have you gotten this idea? I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; plonked two posters in my entire history
&gt;&gt;&gt; on this group -- only one permanently.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't like to put folk on killfile, because
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's essentially turning my back on them.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems... &quot;un-coursey&quot;.

&gt;&gt;      I agree. Like the idea if I am seeing someone a certain way, it's in
&gt;&gt; &quot;my mind&quot; and this is where the problem ( and solution) is.

&gt;&gt;      Plonking someone (to me) is nothing to do with them, but everything
&gt;&gt; to do with me, and the point I'm at trying to resolve my thoughts and
&gt;&gt; feelings about it.

&gt;&gt;      Also, if you plonk someone permanently, how do you know maybe they
&gt;&gt; have changed (which, to me, is me changing my mind about them) The course
&gt;&gt; does say things like the past is over, and every minute we can start
&gt;&gt; again, and &quot;ask HS for help in seeing it (someone) differently&quot; etc

&gt;&gt;      What's the point of having beliefs that say these things and not at
&gt;&gt; least attempting to stick to them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alone in that drama. Obviously, I do it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And so do others. It is difficult to remain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; silent when outrageous statements are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; made about me, others and/or the Course.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay. But you need to remember that
&gt;&gt;&gt; others are not responsible for your
&gt;&gt;&gt; reaction to them. You are. And you
&gt;&gt;&gt; are totally in control of your experience
&gt;&gt;&gt; here, as are we all. We have had
&gt;&gt;&gt; a moderated group available for years.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Still we have chosen to come here.

&gt;&gt;           YES

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the time is nearing for me to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distance myself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then... do. It's as easy as pie. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kay... there IS no problem. There is an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; established moderated forum in existence at the moment and the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ones
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us here are ourselves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~~
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Of course we keep ourselves here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I LIKE most of the posters here and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will miss them if I choose to move on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine. Close it down. This will take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; months. And what do you plan to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until the task is accomplished? Hang
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; around here and haggle with Carrie?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes no sense to me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; n.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - - - - - -

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~I don't know how to close it down.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But since several posters have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; addressed the possibility, I chose
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to start a separate thread.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as what I plan to do, time will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tell. Once again,  I have ceased
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my 'haggle with Carrie.&quot;

&gt;&gt;     That's good to hear.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point a finger at me?

&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn't pointing a finger. It's a fact.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been going round with her for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; days and weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've known Carrie for years, and I find
&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of good in her. I realize that she
&gt;&gt;&gt; does not return my regard. That is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; important to me. Periodically, I get
&gt;&gt;&gt; fed up and plonk her. I don't feel it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary to announce it.

&gt;&gt;      But you do announce it, you write &lt;PLONK&gt; on the bottom of a post
&gt;&gt; after you respond to it.

&gt;&gt;      Now, if you wrote it, or just did it BEFORE responding, it might
&gt;&gt; have a differnet, more peaceful effect. But, you get your say in, then
&gt;&gt; killfile me in case I answer.

&gt;&gt;      I have known you for years, too, and have considered us friends (as
&gt;&gt; I have said many times) - just that we don't always agree. Which is why
&gt;&gt; I'm surprised, over and over when I read some of the stuff you write to
&gt;&gt; me (or to John, etc. about me) I read it in amazement.  And, because it
&gt;&gt; does continually surprise me when I see this, I tend to react from my
&gt;&gt; feelings instead of  shifting to HS, or thinking &quot;well, this is how she
&gt;&gt; must really feel, for whatever reason, it's her choice&quot; and leaveing it
&gt;&gt; at that. Or plonking you (LOL)

&gt;&gt;    Actually, it still amazes me to see you writing the way you sometimes
&gt;&gt; do- period. Not just because it's about me.  But, you're only human and
&gt;&gt; can slip (or be pushed). I must be a really terrible person if I can make
&gt;&gt; someone like you slip into what seems like meanness and personal attack
&gt;&gt; and siding with someone else about this (about me)

&gt;&gt;    Should I apologize for making you do this? You seem to believe, as I
&gt;&gt; do, that *I* am responsible for my own mind and what I decide, see, and
&gt;&gt; how (or if) I react to it.

&gt;&gt;      If I can't blame how I feel on someone else, how can I accept blame
&gt;&gt; for this about them?

&gt;&gt;      The course doesn't let us get away with anything (LOL)

&gt;&gt;       I like everyone here and feel I learn from them. Even those who
&gt;&gt; PLONK me. Which is why it surprises me to read how terrible I'm seen, the
&gt;&gt; evil troll, only here to cause trouble, and making people wrong (when I
&gt;&gt; feel I'm always clear that my beliefs, feelings and opinions are mine and
&gt;&gt; anyone else's are theirs and I'm find with that- you know the &quot;they are
&gt;&gt; just as right, in what they think, feel and believe&quot;  that's been turned
&gt;&gt; into that whole think about me being a Nazi Hitler supporter who believes
&gt;&gt; the Jews should be killed, etc (think about it, what a terrible thing to
&gt;&gt; start about anyone. The only point of it would be, some nut might start
&gt;&gt; believing it and track me down and kill me.  And *I* am the reason people
&gt;&gt; want to close this newsgroup down?  The ego world of illusion must be
&gt;&gt; insane...)

&gt;&gt;   I say this is me, this is how I honestly think, feel and believe. And
&gt;&gt; people say &quot;you are a horrible person, an evil troll, only here to  hate
&gt;&gt; and cause trouble and stir up shit and lie and  we can't get rid of you,
&gt;&gt; so we have to close the newsgroup down because we can't resist seeing you
&gt;&gt; as a horrible person and reacting to this&quot;

&gt;&gt;    It's like I should do the world (and certainly the internet) a favor,
&gt;&gt; and  never be around people again. (the lesson &quot;Light and Joy and Peace
&gt;&gt; abide in me&quot; comes to mind)

&gt;&gt;   I am really such a terrible person, one post from me is the &quot;kiss of
&gt;&gt; death&quot; to a discussion group?  Even ones supposedly based on A Course in
&gt;&gt; Miracles?

&gt;&gt;   I am actually worse than Katie? Because Katie feels the same way the
&gt;&gt; &quot;course students&quot; do about me here?

&gt;&gt;   No, not feeling sorry for myself, just trying to clarify it and get it
&gt;&gt; straight. And see h ow it someway/anyway relates to ACIM. The only thing
&gt;&gt; I can see is, &quot;I AM responsible for what I see, my thoughts, etc...&quot;

&gt;&gt;    And, if I don't post on this newsgroup, somene else is quickly picked
&gt;&gt; to replace me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same with Katie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Chuck.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Katie is killfiled. Only one is necessary.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I find no reason whatsoever to killfile
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chuck. I enjoy corresponding with
&gt;&gt;&gt; him. Why are you including him?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You plonk them and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turn around and it's the same ole
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same ole.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No I don't. It took me a LONG time
&gt;&gt;&gt; to killfile Katie. And it took a couple
&gt;&gt;&gt; of tries (two, I think) before it stuck.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But that has been in place for awhile.

&gt;&gt;     Its taken me a long time to killfile people, too. but mainly because
&gt;&gt; it's a waste of time to keep reading the same stuff, same insults, same
&gt;&gt; words, about the same stuff, over and over.

&gt;&gt;    And I really do have so much more I could be doing. Like so many, I
&gt;&gt; keep getting drawn back here. Either an addiction, or &quot;for the lessons&quot;.

&gt;&gt;   So much potential here. I think the main lesson I come here to learn is
&gt;&gt; to learn the lessons, without the need to talk about them. It always
&gt;&gt; seems to come down to that.

&gt; ~ROTFLMAO. Yeah, well lets say you are not the only one suffering this

&gt; Did it ever occur to you that the whole idea of a open newsgroup,
&gt; inviting anti-course trolls, actively promoting and encouraging
&gt; religious bigotry and tolerance of crimes like cyber stalking is
&gt; &quot;uncoursey.&quot;

&gt; Did you ever consider the newsgroup was unethical and repulsive?

&gt; Did you ever consider that promoting and continuing a blatantly
&gt; unethical situation is itself unethical?

&gt; Did it ever occur to you that tolerance and acceptance of religious
&gt; bigotry, homophobic remarks, hate campaign indistinguishable from
&gt; cyber stalking, etc, does NOT puts you in the position of admirable
&gt; tolerance, but rather opens your actions to scrutiny and the complaint
&gt; of encouraging and enabling the unethical by social acceptance of the
&gt; unethical?

&gt; In fact, it hard to ignore that TRCM is a textbook example of
&gt; attempting to make normal and mainstream the type of behavior that
&gt; &quot;hate laws,&quot; are meant to prevent. Hell, the behavior is so &quot;normal,&quot;
&gt; we have spiritual discussions with the perps.

&gt; So lets say your idea of &quot;coursey,&quot; is hardly everyone idea of
&gt; coursey.

Yeah but.... if  someone has a problem with this newgroup, how it
seems to be to them, and put everyone they feel is to blame for it being
that way on killfile, that would solve their problem (with those people)
and, in a way, be the same as  getting the newsroup closed down.

Too bad a person can't put themself on killfile and that would wipe
out the newsgroup totally (from their awareness) and also solve any problems
they have with it.

This could be (can be) done, but it's up to the free will of the
person who would want to do it. Not depending on software to do what one can
learn to do oneself. Control one's own mind, thoughts, choices, responses,
etc.

Like you can't seem to resist responding to everything I write.  But,
if this were a moderated group and I was banned, you could have that done
for you. Then you could continue to write about me and about me to others,
and never have to suffer through what I might respond back.

&gt;&gt; &gt; From: nancylori ... @shaw.ca (Nancy)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This morning, when I logged on, almost
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; every message I read had to do with this newsgroup and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; behavior/atmosphere
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we &quot;want&quot; on it. I remember the author
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the course asks the question, &quot;What
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; do you want?&quot; and he asks it more than
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; once.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =======================

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;2824. Do you want freedom of the body,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or of the mind? For both you cannot have. Which do you value? Which is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your goal?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For one you see as means; the other, end. And one must serve the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; other,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and lead to its predominance, increasing its importance by diminishing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; its own.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;1077. The ego cannot OPPOSE the laws
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of God, anymore than YOU can. But it can INTERPRET them according to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what it wants, just as YOU can. That is why the question &quot;What DO you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; want?&quot; must be answered.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You ARE answering it every minute and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; every second, and each moment of decision is a judgment which is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; anything BUT
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ineffectual. Its effects will follow auto- matically UNTIL THE
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DECISION
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; IS
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; CHANGED.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;2005. WHAT DO YOU WANT? Light
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or darkness, knowledge or ignorance
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are yours, but not both. Opposites
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; must be brought together, and not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; kept apart.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;2663. One thing is sure; hallucina-
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tions serve a purpose, and when that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; purpose is no longer held, they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; disappear. Therefore, the question
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; never is whether you want THEM,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but always do you want the purpose
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that they serve?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;3016. What, then, IS justified? WHAT
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT? For these two questions
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ARE the same, and, when you see them
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; AS the same, your choice is made. For it is SEEING them as one that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; brings release from the belief there are two ways to see. This world
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; much to offer to your peace, and many chances to extend your own
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; forgiveness. Such its PURPOSE is, to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; those who WANT to see peace and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; forgiveness descend on THEM, and offer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; THEM the light. The Maker of the world
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of gentleness has perfect power to offset the world of violence and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that SEEMS to stand BETWEEN you and His gentleness. It is not there in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; His forgiving eyes. And THEREFORE it need not be there in yours.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =========================

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; From the posts this morning, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; answer SEEMS pretty clear: a peace-
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ful virtual &quot;place&quot; in which to discuss
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the course.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But we all know that those of us who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; want it can have that peaceful place
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; right here and right now, with any
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; number of &quot;body&quot; solutions -- moderated
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ng, killfile implementation -- or, better yet, a decision to see
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; differently.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There are folks here who HAVE made
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a choice for a better way, and who may
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have also implemented some physical
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world solutions. And there are those of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; us who have not.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But I think we all know that we are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing what we are because
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we want it, and we also know that a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; peaceful solution will never arise until we change our minds.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;A problem is only a problem when there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is no solution immediately available.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There is no problem here.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; n.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - - - - - - - -

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ~~Another way of looking at it.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Like-minded people enjoy hanging out
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; together for obvious reasons.  They
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; choose a time and place. Before long
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they get the attention of other folkes who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; don't agree - and worse than that - want
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to argue AND disrupt civil intercouse.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yep.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ~~Sure we can dis - re- gard (overlook)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; their posts, but to be honest after YEARS
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of this kind of non-sense ~~ guidance
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; just 'may' tell us to come away and find
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; another place to meet.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ~~Nancy, if you were demonstrating that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it was &quot;no problem&quot; to have a discussion
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in trcm and NOT get side-tracked by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; endless accusations and questions
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which are off-topic, I'd probably agree
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with you.  But unfortunately that is NOT
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the case.  Take a look at ANY number
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of threads. 100s of posts TRYING to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leave chaos behind --- or trying to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; set the record straight.  It turns into
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; defense - which calls for attack.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OR we just say &quot;what the ____&quot; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; let the ego run wild. I own that one.

&gt;&gt; &gt; TRYING to leave chaos behind accomplishes
&gt;&gt; &gt; nothing. The thing to do is LEAVE chaos behind.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Kay... there IS no problem. There is an
&gt;&gt; &gt; established moderated forum in existence
&gt;&gt; &gt; at the moment and the only ones keeping
&gt;&gt; &gt; us here are ourselves.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ~~I vote for closing this ng down.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?  Because w/o some form of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moderation, it welcomes those who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; want to mock and disrespect ACIM.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; People who do not choose to monitor
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; their own behavior LOOK for ngs such
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as this. Not to close it down is to play
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the role of enabler.  Just my opinion.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ~Kay

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fine. Close it down. This will take
&gt;&gt; &gt; months. And what do you plan to do

&gt;&gt; &gt; This makes no sense to me.

&gt;&gt;       She could always appreciate what I help her see about herself.

&gt;&gt;        I appreciate this in  her (and you, and others here)

&gt;&gt;      That's what the course teaches me, I'm to do.

&gt;&gt; &gt; n.

&gt; ROTFLMAO.  Yeah, Carrie. You always sound so appreciative. You have
&gt; your own meaning for words. And generally they are the polar opposite
&gt; of what everyone else means by the word.

&gt; So its not surprising that what you think the course teaches you is
&gt; often the polar opposite of commonly accepted course teachings.

&gt; There's little doubt in my mind that the above statement is the type
&gt; of contempteous bait, fabricated out of a completely self-serving
&gt; Carrie lie, and conceived by a mind who still thinks the Nazis were as
&gt; right as the Jews.
">

John, you are good at what you do. You provide a continual challenge
and practice for me to remember what *I* believe the course teaches and what
I want to be and apply to my life in a very real way.

Whether you see it that way or not, I do appreciate this. If you
didn't write the stuff you do about me, and get a few others here to join
with you in it, (or they seem to want to see it that way, for whatever
reason)  how would I ever learn?   like not to let how someone else is
seeing something (in this case me) effect me and how I want to be.

Like you now see me as Hitler.  That's your choice and doesn't make it
true and doesn't mean I have to believe it about myself, which I don't.

You don't even really know me (but then you really didn't know Hitler
either) you only know what my words create as a picture of &quot;me&quot; in you, when
you read them.

Which is fine, because I can always make my own choices about how I see
myself and how I see you.

Re: crazy God take on ACIM

here's the responses that were shared to the
above inquiry and essay, in chronological
order. Subsequent exchanges are excluded.
I find them interesting and inspiring, each of
them representing an aspect of my own inner
processing of the matter. maz

--------------------------------------------

I really thank you for getting us to think about what we believe in.

--------------------------------------------
our &quot;thinking&quot; mind really does take its task to &quot;think&quot; quite seriously.
a &quot;dream in the Mind of God&quot; does not seem to this one to be thus and
therefore that &quot;God is dreaming&quot;.  &quot;in the Mind of God&quot;, because there is
nothing outside of that.
this one i call myself gives full credit if it could be said as that, to
ONEness BLESSing by those who have set Intention with God to fully HOLD THE
SPACE and Extend from that ... LOVEing ONEness.  its not doing, saying,
thinking ... it is simply a letting go of all of that, and RECEIVING
BLESSing to ACCEPT ONEness.   i could never have thought myself t/here.
and, it is quite evident that it is lapsed in and out of quite distinctly.
however, Now that I KNOW What i Am ... it can never be gone back from that,
no matter what the ego's gasping insanity.

if this shoe fits, please wear it, as it might just ALLOW yourself to
RECOGNIZE Enlightenment ... as REALity ... we keep &quot;Awakening&quot; from
ourselves by telling a story(ies) about why it can be us, or them, or ...
because we &quot;have so much more to undo&quot; -- there will ALWAYS BE MUCH TO UNDO.
the laundry will take care of itself ... why not ALLOW yOur AWAKENING and
attend to the laundry while Awake!  (now THERE'S a thought).  a concept that
the ego will be perfect and holy is what can and does hold many back ...
waiting for the ego to be totally gone -- this need not be.

ONEness BLESSing is a ONEderful boost (sitting in meditation ...
experiencing LOVEing ONEness as REALity while also receiving a BLESSing) ...
i think i will borrow from Dr. Hawkins for making a &quot;logical&quot; statement
about ONEness BLESSing ...
Dr. Hawkins' Scale of Consciousness peaks out at 1000 ... LOVE'S PRESENCE is
BEYOND &quot;consciousness&quot;, which would, i guess, explain the calibrations in
the ONEness BLESSings gatherings of 1600+    this one experiences this as
LIBERATION, that she then (obviously) eeks back down from ... which the
things to be undone much more apparent, after having megawatt HALOGEN OF
LOVE spotlighting upon them.
if any have opportunity to simply sit in meditation within a ONEness
BLESSing (Deeksha) Gathering, it will be a Gift you give to yourSELF. &lt;&gt;

-----------------------------------------------

Hmmmm Maz, I don't know. If I know how to spell PEACE, divide it into
categorical concepts and languages, and give a thorough disertation as to
it's purpose, evidence and conceptual stance, does it make me peaceful??
It's fleas arguing about the reality of the dog, but where is the purpose...
where is the peace??? Is it in concept or is it in release of everything I
think I know, giving all to God for HIS understanding.
I've heard the concepts of the thinking mind for far too long, now its time
to drop the concepts, disertations and definitions. Now I choose to embrace
the peace. Love.

---------------------------------------------

You asked for feedback on dualism/non-dualism.  The God I believe in does
not sleep--and is not dreaming the illusion.  And I do not find it different
than this in the Course.
Thanks for putting the question out for us.

---------------------------------------------

This is not Course thought. This is reflection on Ken Wapnick's views of the
Course. Ken's views and the Course itself are two very different things. Ken
hasn't any real understanding of the many in the One, nor of God as a Mind
that wants and likes relationships and sharing even in Heaven. It's all a
blank to him and his. I don't say that with hostility, but only because it
is the truth.
----------------------------------------------

&quot;All beliefs are real to the believer.&quot;
Yes, the ego analyzes. The Holy Spirit accepts.
They only inflate their egos, serving them instead of forgiving them. &quot;Ask
all things of His Teacher.&quot;

They are not even studying the Course, for it never uses the symbols they
are analyzing. The Course uses the symbol &quot;dual&quot; just once, and never uses
the other. Thus have they made of themselves false prophets, false
witnesses, on a path that has missed the mark. They have separated
themselves, and then proceed with they know not what they do.  There are
many references in the Course that will answer their questions, but they
choose to seek where truth cannot be found. Thus, &quot;everything that seems to
happen to me I ask for, and receive as I have asked.&quot;
C-6.3. The Holy Spirit is described as the remaining Communication Link
between God and His separated Sons. 2 In order to fulfill this special
function the Holy Spirit has assumed a dual function.

carrie: What has to &quot;change&quot;?

The way I understand it, and I know I'm told I DON'T understand it. it's
my mind that has to change, in order to see someone else in a different way.

sv: I've chosen to do that with you carrie, however, that doesn't change the
fact that what you write about here on the ng, has not changed in years.  I

&gt;    What has to &quot;change&quot;?

&gt;    The way I understand it, and I know I'm told I DON'T understand it.
&gt; it's my mind that has to change, in order to see someone else in a
&gt; different way.

&gt;    That, and &quot;forgiveness&quot; (for what my brother didn't do? - for myself
&gt; for thinking he/she DID do something wrong?)  and letting go of the past,
&gt; grievences, and all that.

&gt;     I think the confusion that comes up about any of this, and it being
&gt; course related is when we (humans who believe we are in separate bodies
&gt; that are real (LOL)  start trying to apply it to someone else &quot;out there&quot;

&gt;       If this is having the course wrong and not understanding it, I guess
&gt; I have it wrong and don't understand it, but it seems right, and makes
&gt; sense to me.

&gt;        Maybe it's a life lesson for us Sagittarians that people don't
&gt; always (usually) want or need to know &quot;the truth&quot;  (as we see it) and, as
&gt; Gene told me one time, nobody cares how you think, feel and believe here.

&gt;      Not a shabby lesson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where have you gotten this idea? I've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plonked two posters in my entire history
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on this group -- only one permanently.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't like to put folk on killfile, because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's essentially turning my back on them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems... &quot;un-coursey&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      I agree. Like the idea if I am seeing someone a certain way, it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; in &quot;my mind&quot; and this is where the problem ( and solution) is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      Plonking someone (to me) is nothing to do with them, but everything
&gt;&gt;&gt; to do with me, and the point I'm at trying to resolve my thoughts and
&gt;&gt;&gt; feelings about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      Also, if you plonk someone permanently, how do you know maybe they
&gt;&gt;&gt; have changed (which, to me, is me changing my mind about them) The
&gt;&gt;&gt; course does say things like the past is over, and every minute we can
&gt;&gt;&gt; start again, and &quot;ask HS for help in seeing it (someone) differently&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc

&gt;&gt;&gt;      What's the point of having beliefs that say these things and not at
&gt;&gt;&gt; least attempting to stick to them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alone in that drama. Obviously, I do it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And so do others. It is difficult to remain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; silent when outrageous statements are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; made about me, others and/or the Course.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay. But you need to remember that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others are not responsible for your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reaction to them. You are. And you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are totally in control of your experience
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here, as are we all. We have had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a moderated group available for years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Still we have chosen to come here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;           YES

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the time is nearing for me to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distance myself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then... do. It's as easy as pie. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kay... there IS no problem. There is an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; established moderated forum in existence at the moment and the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ones
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us here are ourselves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~~
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Of course we keep ourselves here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I LIKE most of the posters here and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will miss them if I choose to move on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine. Close it down. This will take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; months. And what do you plan to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until the task is accomplished? Hang
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; around here and haggle with Carrie?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes no sense to me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; n.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - - - - - -

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~I don't know how to close it down.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But since several posters have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; addressed the possibility, I chose
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to start a separate thread.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as what I plan to do, time will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tell. Once again,  I have ceased
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my 'haggle with Carrie.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;     That's good to hear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point a finger at me?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn't pointing a finger. It's a fact.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been going round with her for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; days and weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've known Carrie for years, and I find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of good in her. I realize that she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does not return my regard. That is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; important to me. Periodically, I get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fed up and plonk her. I don't feel it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary to announce it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      But you do announce it, you write &lt;PLONK&gt; on the bottom of a post
&gt;&gt;&gt; after you respond to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      Now, if you wrote it, or just did it BEFORE responding, it might
&gt;&gt;&gt; have a differnet, more peaceful effect. But, you get your say in, then
&gt;&gt;&gt; killfile me in case I answer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      I have known you for years, too, and have considered us friends (as
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have said many times) - just that we don't always agree. Which is why
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm surprised, over and over when I read some of the stuff you write to
&gt;&gt;&gt; me (or to John, etc. about me) I read it in amazement.  And, because it
&gt;&gt;&gt; does continually surprise me when I see this, I tend to react from my
&gt;&gt;&gt; feelings instead of  shifting to HS, or thinking &quot;well, this is how she
&gt;&gt;&gt; must really feel, for whatever reason, it's her choice&quot; and leaveing it
&gt;&gt;&gt; at that. Or plonking you (LOL)

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Actually, it still amazes me to see you writing the way you sometimes
&gt;&gt;&gt; do- period. Not just because it's about me.  But, you're only human and
&gt;&gt;&gt; can slip (or be pushed). I must be a really terrible person if I can
&gt;&gt;&gt; make someone like you slip into what seems like meanness and personal
&gt;&gt;&gt; attack and siding with someone else about this (about me)

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Should I apologize for making you do this? You seem to believe, as I
&gt;&gt;&gt; do, that *I* am responsible for my own mind and what I decide, see, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; how (or if) I react to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      If I can't blame how I feel on someone else, how can I accept blame
&gt;&gt;&gt; for this about them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;      The course doesn't let us get away with anything (LOL)

&gt;&gt;&gt;       I like everyone here and feel I learn from them. Even those who
&gt;&gt;&gt; PLONK me. Which is why it surprises me to read how terrible I'm seen,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the evil troll, only here to cause trouble, and making people wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt; (when I feel I'm always clear that my beliefs, feelings and opinions are
&gt;&gt;&gt; mine and anyone else's are theirs and I'm find with that- you know the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;they are just as right, in what they think, feel and believe&quot;  that's
&gt;&gt;&gt; been turned into that whole think about me being a Nazi Hitler supporter
&gt;&gt;&gt; who believes the Jews should be killed, etc (think about it, what a
&gt;&gt;&gt; terrible thing to start about anyone. The only point of it would be,
&gt;&gt;&gt; some nut might start believing it and track me down and kill me.  And
&gt;&gt;&gt; *I* am the reason people want to close this newsgroup down?  The ego
&gt;&gt;&gt; world of illusion must be insane...)

&gt;&gt;&gt;   I say this is me, this is how I honestly think, feel and believe. And
&gt;&gt;&gt; people say &quot;you are a horrible person, an evil troll, only here to  hate
&gt;&gt;&gt; and cause trouble and stir up shit and lie and  we can't get rid of you,
&gt;&gt;&gt; so we have to close the newsgroup down because we can't resist seeing
&gt;&gt;&gt; you as a horrible person and reacting to this&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;    It's like I should do the world (and certainly the internet) a favor,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and  never be around people again. (the lesson &quot;Light and Joy and Peace
&gt;&gt;&gt; abide in me&quot; comes to mind)

&gt;&gt;&gt;   I am really such a terrible person, one post from me is the &quot;kiss of
&gt;&gt;&gt; death&quot; to a discussion group?  Even ones supposedly based on A Course in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Miracles?

&gt;&gt;&gt;   I am actually worse than Katie? Because Katie feels the same way the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;course students&quot; do about me here?

&gt;&gt;&gt;   No, not feeling sorry for myself, just trying to clarify it and get it
&gt;&gt;&gt; straight. And see h ow it someway/anyway relates to ACIM. The only thing
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can see is, &quot;I AM responsible for what I see, my thoughts, etc...&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;    And, if I don't post on this newsgroup, somene else is quickly picked
&gt;&gt;&gt; to replace me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same with Katie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Chuck.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Katie is killfiled. Only one is necessary.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I find no reason whatsoever to killfile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chuck. I enjoy corresponding with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him. Why are you including him?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You plonk them and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; turn around and it's the same ole
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same ole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No I don't. It took me a LONG time
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to killfile Katie. And it took a couple
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of tries (two, I think) before it stuck.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But that has been in place

If you're still seeing me here and I've not changed, maybe you haven't
changed you mind about me as much as you think.

Seeing me the same way, but now you've managed to tolerate me.

Which is okay with me. If I have to change to &quot;get&quot; someone to somehow
seem me in a better way, and accept me, or whatever, I don't really want
them to.

&gt;&gt;      Not a shabby lesson.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where have you gotten this idea? I've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plonked two posters in my entire history
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on this group -- only one permanently.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't like to put folk on killfile, because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's essentially turning my back on them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems... &quot;un-coursey&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      I agree. Like the idea if I am seeing someone a certain way, it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in &quot;my mind&quot; and this is where the problem ( and solution) is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      Plonking someone (to me) is nothing to do with them, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything to do with me, and the point I'm at trying to resolve my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thoughts and feelings about it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      Also, if you plonk someone permanently, how do you know maybe they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have changed (which, to me, is me changing my mind about them) The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course does say things like the past is over, and every minute we can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; start again, and &quot;ask HS for help in seeing it (someone) differently&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      What's the point of having beliefs that say these things and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at least attempting to stick to them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alone in that drama. Obviously, I do it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And so do others. It is difficult to remain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; silent when outrageous statements are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; made about me, others and/or the Course.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay. But you need to remember that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others are not responsible for your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reaction to them. You are. And you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are totally in control of your experience
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here, as are we all. We have had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a moderated group available for years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Still we have chosen to come here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;           YES

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the time is nearing for me to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distance myself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then... do. It's as easy as pie. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kay... there IS no problem. There is an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; established moderated forum in existence at the moment and the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ones
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keeping
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us here are ourselves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~~
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Of course we keep ourselves here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I LIKE most of the posters here and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will miss them if I choose to move on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nancy:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine. Close it down. This will take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; months. And what do you plan to do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until the task is accomplished? Hang
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; around here and haggle with Carrie?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This makes no sense to me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; n.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - - - - - -

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~I don't know how to close it down.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But since several posters have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; addressed the possibility, I chose
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to start a separate thread.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as what I plan to do, time will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tell. Once again,  I have ceased
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my 'haggle with Carrie.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     That's good to hear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point a finger at me?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn't pointing a finger. It's a fact.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been going round with her for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; days and weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've known Carrie for years, and I find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of good in her. I realize that she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does not return my regard. That is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; important to me. Periodically, I get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fed up and plonk her. I don't feel it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary to announce it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      But you do announce it, you write &lt;PLONK&gt; on the bottom of a post
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; after you respond to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      Now, if you wrote it, or just did it BEFORE responding, it might
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a differnet, more peaceful effect. But, you get your say in, then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; killfile me in case I answer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      I have known you for years, too, and have considered us friends
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (as I have said many times) - just that we don't always agree. Which is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why I'm surprised, over and over when I read some of the stuff you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write to me (or to John, etc. about me) I read it in amazement.  And,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because it does continually surprise me when I see this, I tend to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; react from my feelings instead of  shifting to HS, or thinking &quot;well,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is how she must really feel, for whatever reason, it's her choice&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and leaveing it at that. Or plonking you (LOL)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    Actually, it still amazes me to see you writing the way you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes do- period. Not just because it's about me.  But, you're only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; human and can slip (or be pushed). I must be a really terrible person
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if I can make someone like you slip into what seems like meanness and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; personal attack and siding with someone else about this (about me)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    Should I apologize for making you do this? You seem to believe, as I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do, that *I* am responsible for my own mind and what I decide, see, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how (or if) I react to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      If I can't blame how I feel on someone else, how can I accept
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blame for this about them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      The course doesn't let us get away with anything (LOL)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       I like everyone here and feel I learn from them. Even those who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PLONK me. Which is why it surprises me to read how terrible I'm seen,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the evil troll, only here to cause trouble, and making people wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (when I feel I'm always clear that my beliefs, feelings and opinions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are mine and anyone else's are theirs and I'm find with that- you know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &quot;they are just as right, in what they think, feel and believe&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that's been turned into that whole think about me being a Nazi Hitler
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supporter who believes the Jews should be killed, etc (think about it,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what a terrible thing to start about anyone. The only point of it would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be, some nut might start believing it and track me down and kill me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And *I* am the reason people want to close this newsgroup down?  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ego world of illusion must be insane...)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   I say this is me, this is how I honestly think, feel and believe. And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people say &quot;you are a horrible person, an evil troll, only here to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hate and cause trouble and stir up shit and lie and  we can't get rid
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of you, so we have to close the newsgroup down because we can't resist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeing you as a horrible person and reacting to this&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    It's like I should do the world (and certainly the internet) a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; favor, and  never be around people again. (the lesson &quot;Light and Joy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Peace abide in me&quot; comes to mind)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   I am really such a terrible person, one post from me is the &quot;kiss of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; death&quot; to a discussion group?  Even ones supposedly based on A Course
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Miracles?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   I am actually worse than Katie? Because Katie feels the same way the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;course students&quot; do about me here?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   No, not feeling sorry for myself, just trying to clarify it and get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it straight. And see h

ROTFLMAO. Did it ever occur to you to change so you could be a normal,
productive human being?  Of course you never have to change if you see
yourself as perfect and better than everyone else, and completely
justified in annoying others to change.

I mean why would you want to change if there is nothing to change and
all the lessons you talk about are for other people? You would lose
your self perfection if you changed, and that's hardly worth the price
for people accepting you.
