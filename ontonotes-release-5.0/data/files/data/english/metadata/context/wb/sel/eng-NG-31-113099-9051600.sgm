Protocol #1 - What we Believe

1-2.  Let's discuss the differences between us Jews and them Goyim
(non-Jews).

3.  People are basically evil by nature.  The bad people in this world far
outnumber the good.  So the best form of government is not one that holds
reasoned discussions with its people, but one that uses tyranny.

Most people would gladly become an all-powerful dictator and sacrifice the
well-being of others for their own benefit.

4.  Where do people get their guidance?  And what stops them from acting out
their evil desires?

5.  In olden times people behaved like animals and were guided by the force
of their bestial instincts.  Then as society developed, humans developed
laws to follow.  But these laws were based on those same natural instincts.
So the only valid Law is the 'law of nature', i.e. the use of force.

6.  Freedom is only an ideal: nobody really has it.  But if you want to win
an election it's good to preach the ideals of freedom, even if you plan to
deprive your voters of it.

If your opponent believes in the concept of freedom, like as a
'Libertarian', use that against him.  Because if he foolishly believes in
freedom he won't be willing to use the underhanded tactics that you do.  He
will play fair while you fight dirty.

Any government that is based on freedom loses control over its people.  This
is a terrible thing because remember that people are basically bad and the
only way to guide them is by force.  If a government is guided by freedom
the people will become weak.  We can take advantage of that weakness to
overpower them and install a new government.

Gold

7.  There was a time when religion was the guiding force of mankind.  But
now, money is more important than religion.  Money - especially Gold - is
the new guiding force because it gives power and freedom to the common
people.  But that freedom is bad because they'll always want more and don't
know how to use it.  We can't allow that.

Self-governance can be given to the masses, but only long enough for them to
form a disorganized mob.  At that point we should intervene to create strife
and racial hatred between their different classes and races.  This will
cause them to fight and kill each other; hopefully starting a civil war.

8.  Once a nation is engaged in civil war it will either destroy itself or
be weakened to the point where it can be overtaken by another foreign power.
In either case our job will be done as they'll no longer be a threat to us.

If that nation ends up in bankruptcy we'll offer to loan them some of our
money.  They'll have no option but to take it.

9.  If anyone claims that the above is immoral, let me ask them this:
Suppose a nation has two enemies: an external enemy which is a neighboring
nation; and an internal enemy represented by political rivals who might try
to overthrow the nation from within.  Well, if it is acceptable to destroy
the other nation without any regard to morals, then why should it not also
be acceptable to destroy the internal enemy?  After all, it's the more
dangerous of the two and the more likely to succeed in destroying society.

10.  Who in their right mind could expect to govern the people by the use of
reasoned debate?  Because those people, who are really quite stupid when
compared to you, could then counter your arguments with their own silly
arguments, and then you'd have to keep debating them.  You'd get nowhere.

The people who make up society (voters) are lame-brained numskulls who never
achieve anything.  They spend their time following astrology charts and
football.  They obviously can't think logically.

In fact, the only time they agree on anything is when we trick the majority
of them into believing something.  So they may as well just let us do our
job of ruling them.  Otherwise the whole nation will erupt into anarchy.

11.  Politics has nothing to do with morals.  Anyone who tries to govern
according to morals is a moron and unsuitable for office.  A true politician
must resort to cunning and lies if he expects to get anywhere.

Great qualities such as honesty and integrity are a burden for any ruler.
Anyone in politics who decides to start behaving like this - their career
will be over before they know it.  Most Goyim believe that their rulers
should have these qualities; but of course, we know better.

Might is Right

12.  There is a common-held belief that all people are born with 'rights',
meaning that they should be allowed to do or have certain things in life,
regardless of who they are.  But there is no way of proving this.

13.  What is a right?  Where does it begin and end?

14.  If a ruler starts granting rights, then everyone will start demanding
new rights, especially libertarians.  Soon the nation will be overrun with
rights and the ruler will look stupid.  From this I conclude that there is
only one right: the right of the strong over the weak.  It gives a ruler the
power to do whatever he wants, and to become supreme lord over those
libertarian people who had better give up their rights to him voluntarily.

15.  Our method of gaining power is better than any other because it grows
invisibly.  Then when it has gained enough strength, we can unleash it; and
it will be unstoppable because no one will be prepared for it.

16.  We need to do a lot of evil things in order to gain power.  But that's
okay because once we have power over everything we can use it to do good
things; like running the nations properly.  We could never do that if we
gave people freedom.

The end justifies the means.  So let's put aside moral issues and focus on
the end result.

17.  We have a good long-range plan here and we can't afford to deviate from
it.  Otherwise all our work over the centuries would have been for nothing.

18.  In order to plan our actions effectively, we must take into account
that the common people are an incoherent mob of blathering idiots who can't
even look after themselves.

These people are blind, senseless and have no ability to reason.  In fact,
they'll get suckered in by anyone.

While the majority of them are total nincompoops that would follow one
another over a cliff-top, as they have no leadership skills; occasionally
one might emerge who appears to have some degree of intelligence.  However
even these people don't understand how to lead, and if you let them, they'd
bring a whole nation to ruin.

19.  Only someone trained from childhood to serve as a leader can truly
understand politics.

20.  People left to look after themselves will be brought to ruin.  That's
because their leaders, who emerge from among them, are only interested in
power and glory.  Is it possible for these people to put aside their
self-interests and manage the affairs of their nation?

Like, can they defend themselves from an external enemy?  No way!  When a
project of that scale is divided up among the many dimwitted members of
their society, it becomes unintelligible to them.

We Are Despots

21.  Only a despotic ruler can effectively carry out large operations, and
distribute all the necessary resources to the various departments so that
important plans can be executed.  From this we conclude that the most
effective government is one that concentrates all its power in the hands of
a single responsible person.

Without absolute despotism there is no way to guide the masses and
civilization will fall apart.  They are savage barbarians and behave like
that at every opportunity.

The moment the people gain freedom it quickly turns to anarchy, which is
just savagery.

22.  Notice that when people are given freedom, they use it drink themselves
senseless and behave like animals.  We ourselves should avoid behaving like
that.

Goyim are always drinking alcohol, or thinking about doing so.  We caused
this to happen by using our many agents to promote it as part of their
culture.  It increases immorality and makes their youth stupid.

We have agents placed everywhere, occupying many positions throughout
society.  Such as tutors, lackeys, governesses in the houses of the wealthy,
by clerks and others.  We also have a lot of women-agents acting as
prostitutes who assist in the corruption process.

23.  Our modus operandi is: Force and Make-Believe.  Only force gives you
power, especially in the hands of a smooth talker.

Violence and deception must be the rule for any politician who wants to
remain in power.  This may be considered evil, but remember, evil is
justified when it is used to achieve good.  Therefore we must not stop at
bribery, deceit and treachery if they help us attain our end goal.

In politics we must know how to seize the property of others without
hesitation if it allows us to gain full power over them.

24.  We may need to wage many wars in order to achieve ultimate peace.
Between wars, we can replace the horrors of war by less noticeable and more
satisfactory sentences of death.  This is necessary to maintain terror in
the populace which leads to blind submission.

A just but merciless penal system is the greatest strength of the State.  We
do this not only for the sake of gain but also in the name of duty.  For the
sake of our victory, we must stick to the program of violence and
make-believe.

It is enough for them to know that we are merciless for any disobedience to
cease.

The principle of balancing accounts (particularly the repayment of debts) is
strongly ingrained and one which we will take advantage of.  We will use
this principle as a means to bring all governments under the control of our
super-government.

We Shall End Liberty

25.  Far back in ancient times we were the first to stand among crowds of
people and cry out the words &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot;.  The people
fell for our bait.  They picked up those words and started repeating them
parrot-like throughout the world.  As a result they have taken away the
well-being

&gt;&gt; grows

&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; it will be unstoppable because no one will be prepared for it.

I've wondered about this more than once..are people basically evil or
basically good.   I think it depends on the type of group you are
referring to.    The above sounds very consistent with what I
would think a Zionist type Jew would believe, and I believe
it does describe them pretty well, so I can see how they would
have that world view.   My conclusion on the kind of mainstream
Americans (mostly non-Jew) I have observed is that most
people are basically, sorta good; know right from wrong, good
from bad, and generally want to do good, if for no other reason,
because they are intelligent enough to know life is better by
choosing good.   That said, I will also say that most people
are not above lying or other chicanery in varying degrees when
it suits their needs and when they feel they would greatly benefit
from it.

Carry on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4.  Where do people get their guidance?  And what stops them from acting out
&gt; their evil desires?

&gt; 5.  In olden times people behaved like animals and were guided by the force
&gt; of their bestial instincts.  Then as society developed, humans developed
&gt; laws to follow.  But these laws were based on those same natural instincts.
&gt; So the only valid Law is the 'law of nature', i.e. the use of force.

&gt; 6.  Freedom is only an ideal: nobody really has it.  But if you want to win
&gt; an election it's good to preach the ideals of freedom, even if you plan to
&gt; deprive your voters of it.

&gt; If your opponent believes in the concept of freedom, like as a
&gt; 'Libertarian', use that against him.  Because if he foolishly believes in
&gt; freedom he won't be willing to use the underhanded tactics that you do.  He
&gt; will play fair while you fight dirty.

&gt; Any government that is based on freedom loses control over its people.  This
&gt; is a terrible thing because remember that people are basically bad and the
&gt; only way to guide them is by force.  If a government is guided by freedom
&gt; the people will become weak.  We can take advantage of that weakness to
&gt; overpower them and install a new government.

&gt; Gold

&gt; 7.  There was a time when religion was the guiding force of mankind.  But
&gt; now, money is more important than religion.  Money - especially Gold - is
&gt; the new guiding force because it gives power and freedom to the common
&gt; people.  But that freedom is bad because they'll always want more and don't
&gt; know how to use it.  We can't allow that.

&gt; Self-governance can be given to the masses, but only long enough for them to
&gt; form a disorganized mob.  At that point we should intervene to create strife
&gt; and racial hatred between their different classes and races.  This will
&gt; cause them to fight and kill each other; hopefully starting a civil war.

&gt; 8.  Once a nation is engaged in civil war it will either destroy itself or
&gt; be weakened to the point where it can be overtaken by another foreign power.
&gt; In either case our job will be done as they'll no longer be a threat to us.

&gt; If that nation ends up in bankruptcy we'll offer to loan them some of our
&gt; money.  They'll have no option but to take it.

&gt; 9.  If anyone claims that the above is immoral, let me ask them this:
&gt; Suppose a nation has two enemies: an external enemy which is a neighboring
&gt; nation; and an internal enemy represented by political rivals who might try
&gt; to overthrow the nation from within.  Well, if it is acceptable to destroy
&gt; the other nation without any regard to morals, then why should it not also
&gt; be acceptable to destroy the internal enemy?  After all, it's the more
&gt; dangerous of the two and the more likely to succeed in destroying society.

&gt; 10.  Who in their right mind could expect to govern the people by the use of
&gt; reasoned debate?  Because those people, who are really quite stupid when
&gt; compared to you, could then counter your arguments with their own silly
&gt; arguments, and then you'd have to keep debating them.  You'd get nowhere.

&gt; The people who make up society (voters) are lame-brained numskulls who never
&gt; achieve anything.  They spend their time following astrology charts and
&gt; football.  They obviously can't think logically.

&gt; In fact, the only time they agree on anything is when we trick the majority
&gt; of them into believing something.  So they may as well just let us do our
&gt; job of ruling them.  Otherwise the whole nation will erupt into anarchy.

&gt; 11.  Politics has nothing to do with morals.  Anyone who tries to govern
&gt; according to morals is a moron and unsuitable for office.  A true politician
&gt; must resort to cunning and lies if he expects to get anywhere.

&gt; Great qualities such as honesty and integrity are a burden for any ruler.
&gt; Anyone in politics who decides to start behaving like this - their career
&gt; will be over before they know it.  Most Goyim believe that their rulers
&gt; should have these qualities; but of course, we know better.

&gt; Might is Right

&gt; 12.  There is a common-held belief that all people are born with 'rights',
&gt; meaning that they should be allowed to do or have certain things in life,
&gt; regardless of who they are.  But there is no way of proving this.

&gt; 13.  What is a right?  Where does it begin and end?

&gt; 14.  If a ruler starts granting rights, then everyone will start demanding
&gt; new rights, especially libertarians.  Soon the nation will be overrun with
&gt; rights and the ruler will look stupid.  From this I conclude that there is
&gt; only one right: the right of the strong over the weak.  It gives a ruler the
&gt; power to do whatever he wants, and to become supreme lord over those
&gt; libertarian people who had better give up their rights to him voluntarily.

&gt; 15.  Our method of gaining power is better than any other because it grows
&gt; invisibly.  Then when it has gained enough strength, we can unleash it; and
&gt; it will be unstoppable because no one will be prepared for it.

&gt; 16.  We need to do a lot of evil things in order to gain power.  But that's
&gt; okay because once we have power over everything we can use it to do good
&gt; things; like running the nations properly.  We could never do that if we
&gt; gave people freedom.

&gt; The end justifies the means.  So let's put aside moral issues and focus on
&gt; the end result.

&gt; 17.  We have a good long-range plan here and we can't afford to deviate from
&gt; it.  Otherwise all our work over the centuries would have been for nothing.

&gt; 18.  In order to plan our actions effectively, we must take into account
&gt; that the common people are an incoherent mob of blathering idiots who can't
&gt; even look after themselves.

&gt; These people are blind, senseless and have no ability to reason.  In fact,
&gt; they'll get suckered in by anyone.

&gt; While the majority of them are total nincompoops that would follow one
&gt; another over a cliff-top, as they have no leadership skills; occasionally
&gt; one might emerge who appears to have some degree of intelligence.  However
&gt; even these people don't understand how to lead, and if you let them, they'd
&gt; bring a whole nation to ruin.

&gt; 19.  Only someone trained from childhood to serve as a leader can truly
&gt; understand politics.

&gt; 20.  People left to look after themselves will be brought to ruin.  That's
&gt; because their leaders, who emerge from among them, are only interested in
&gt; power and glory.  Is it possible for these people to put aside their
&gt; self-interests and manage the affairs of their nation?

&gt; Like, can they defend themselves from an external enemy?  No way!  When a
&gt; project of that scale is divided up among the many dimwitted members of
&gt; their society, it becomes unintelligible to them.

&gt; We Are Despots

&gt; distribute all the necessary resources to the various departments so that
&gt; important plans can be executed.  From this we conclude that the most
&gt; effective government is one that concentrates all its power in the hands of

&gt; society.  Such as tutors, lackeys, governesses in the houses of the wealthy,
&gt; by clerks and others.  We also have a lot of women-agents acting as
&gt; prostitutes who assist in the corruption process.

&gt; 23.  Our modus operandi is: Force and Make-Believe.  Only force gives you
