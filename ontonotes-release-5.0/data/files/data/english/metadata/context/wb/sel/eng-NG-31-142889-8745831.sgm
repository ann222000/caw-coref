Pastor admits to molesting girls
.: posted 6/24/2007 ::: by .:webmaster:. ::: EmailThis! »

A Baptist minister from Cleveland Heights admitted Thursday that he molested two
children, including one of his wife's relatives and an unrelated member of his
church's flock who was 12 years old and deaf.

The Rev. Wayne Biles, former pastor of Mount Ararat Missionary Baptist Church at
3793 East 131st St., pleaded guilty Tuesday to rape, gross sexual imposition and
kidnapping. His plea deal calls for 17 years of incarceration when Cuyahoga
County Common Pleas Judge Hollie Gallagher sentences him July 31.

Biles could not be reached to comment.

He began a pattern of molesting his wife's relative about 13 years ago, &quot;as soon
as [he and his bride] returned home from their honeymoon,&quot; said Assistant County
Prosecutor Pinkey Carr.

The victim, also 12 at the time, told her mother, who advised her to keep quiet
about it and pray, Carr said. That victim, now 25 and married, complied until
last year, when she told Cleveland Heights police.

Unbeknownst to her, authorities had just charged Biles with assaulting a
12-year-old girl. Carr said that girl's parents had sought marriage counseling
during the summer of 2005 from Biles. The minister suggested the couple, from
Beachwood, leave their children at his home overnight to spend time alone
together, Carr said. That night, he molested the girl.

Ultraman is a cocksucking whore who stands around public restrooms
picking up little boys.  That's why the obsession he has with sex
crimes.

Well, maybe the minister thought Jeebus told him to do it.

But it's an individual aberration, right?  I mean, it's not like
anyone else connected with the situation would look at it and not
immediately see it as a crime....

Her *MOTHER* told her to &quot;keep quiet about it and pray&quot;?????

Oh shit, Christianity is one dangerous disease, contributing to child
abuse with the parent's own complicity.

Amazing what claims of divine authority and threats of eternal
damnation will do to keep a victim silent.

Yup, definately using his Christian authority to futher his criminal
child-raping urges.

Great story, and you're on a roll with these today Ultra.  Keep 'em
coming (so to speak), you scratch the surface of any large Christian
organization and you'll uncover at least a few pedophiles.  Must be a
big part of what draws child molestors to these organizations: they
get authority over other people's families.

Same authority that Kent Wills kowtows to, and pathetically
attempts to defend via absurd lies and denials.

Note the TITLE of the Blog you stammering imbecile.

children, including one of his wife's relatives and an unrelated member of his
church's flock who was 12 years old and deaf.

The Rev. Wayne Biles, former pastor of Mount Ararat Missionary Baptist Church at

kidnapping. His plea deal calls for 17 years of incarceration when Cuyahoga
County Common Pleas Judge Hollie Gallagher sentences him July 31.

True.  The closest he can get is other atheists attacking me.
They aren't supporting jonez/vox/ultra/whatever as much as trying to
goad me, but it's as close as the nutter will ever get to support.
