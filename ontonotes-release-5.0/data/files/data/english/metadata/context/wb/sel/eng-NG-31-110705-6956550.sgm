Vandalism at John Edwards SL HQ

Shortly before midnight (CST) on Monday, February 26, a group of republican
Second Life users, some sporting "Bush '08" tags, vandalized the John
Edwards Second Life HQ.  They plastered the area with Marxist/Lenninist
posters and slogans, a feces spewing obsenity, and a photoshopped picture of
John in blackface, all the while harrassing visitors with right-wing
nonsense and obsenity-laden abuse of Democrats in general and John in
particular.

I witnessed this event, taking names and photos, including the owners of the
pictures.  I also kept and saved a copy of the chat log.  I have filed an
abuse report with Linden Labs, and am awaiting their investigation.
