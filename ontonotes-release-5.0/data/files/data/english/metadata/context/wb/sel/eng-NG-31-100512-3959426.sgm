I really feel sorry for the miss lead,  that bought those big gas
guzzlers and S.U.V.'s like the hummer,Tahoe,Escalade, Dodge Ram's,
F-150..etc and now are unable to save for their retirements and
childens educations because the families income is being burned in the
gas tank. Wait, it won't be long and you will finds these vehicles
abandon on the side of the freeway!!!!!!! Sales are beginning to
slide. I have a honda CR-V and the prices at the tank are killing me.

Oh yeah, I cannot imagine how people can afford to spend say 70 dollars
a week to fill up their big Chevy Truck. At my last job our chevy 2500
pickup took 25 gallons to fill up.

My Civic normally costed me 15 to fill up, now its 25. Damn are
government is screwing us over on gas prices, and these high 75 cent a
gallon taxes. (im sure they are really more than that)

Americans have a much greater level of disposable income than almost
any other western country. At the uk prices of 2 years ago, it would
ahve cost you about $55US to fill up your civic. Right now europes
over $6 for a US gallon.

Americans  just need to get their heads out of their collective arses,
stop whining, and live with it. I mean, when you elect an oil
president, of course oil prices will rise. Duh. its an utter no
brainer. Grow up, get over it, welcome to the real world.

Exactly what would a non oil president have done differently that would have
kept prices lower?

1. stop diverting 4% of imports to the "strategic" oil reserve.  at $67
per barrel, do tax payers really /need/ to be filling the reserve right
now???

2. investigate these mysterious refinery "outages" that smack of enron
electricity market manipulation.

3. investigate the mysterious rise in the refinery "crack split", the
price difference between crude &amp; refined product.  traditionally, that's
5%.  recently, it's risen to 20%.

3. stop monkeying with/subsidizing ethanol additives.  ethanol is the
triple whammy - we pay a tax subsidy for production, we pay more at the
pump, /AND/ we get crappy gas mileage so we get to buy more of it!!!  on
top of all that, it's not even necessary to achieve the so-called
emissions targets that smoke-screen as justification!!!  ethanol is a
complete scam.

I think most of those who can afford $35k or more for a monster suv
aren't going to care about an extra grand or two a year for gas.  If a
grand meant that much to them, they would've purchased a 30 mpg vehicle
to begin with .

Those people cannot afford SUVs to begin with.   Most of them take out
60 month, 72 month, or even 96 month loans to pay for them.  Rising gas
prices will stretch many to the limit (not that they're not already
there anyway), and they will default on their car loans.  You
overestimate the intelligence of the average consumer.

In the majority of cases, this is indeed true. One of my co-workers has a
workout partner at his gym who's a sales manager at a GMC/Pontiac/Buick
dealership. He said that roughly 95% of the people that purchase SUVs at
that dealership finance anywhere from 95% of the sale price to 120% when
they're "upside down" with their trade-ins. The guy said that it just amazes
him on a daily basis "how financially f'ed up these people are--yet they're
wanting to buy a ~$38,000.00 SUV that gets HORRIBLE gas mileage." He said
that there were "a few exceptions where someone will plop down cash for one
of these beasts".

1) top posting is a no-no.

2) very little press in the Us is liberal. It is aminly controlled by
a few conglomerates, with heavy political allegences to one or the
other of the main parties - this is something clearly evident back in
October.

3) am i a liberal? well, if you mean am i a free-thinking person who
doesn't let the preconceptions of others contrain me into a narrow
thought pattern, then yes, i am. (that IS what liberal means, you
know. How the hell americans have come to be convinced, as you
obviously are, that free and independant thought is a bad thing, i'll
never know.

T.E.R.M.S............That's the magic word for people with no money in the
bank . My dad always told me buy it if you got the money , if you don't have
the money don't buy it . Pretty simple actually .
