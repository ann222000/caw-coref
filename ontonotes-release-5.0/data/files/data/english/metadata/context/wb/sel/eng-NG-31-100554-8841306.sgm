BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, in the last half hour, Harry Reid took to
the floor of the Senate and proceeded to spend five-to-seven minutes
denouncing me, spreading the smear that started last week on this
phony soldiers business.  He has prepared a letter to be sent to the
CEO of the company that syndicates this program, and that letter he
asked as many senators as possible to sign, offering them the
opportunity to demand of my syndicator that I be condemned for
something that I did not say, which Harry Reid knows I did not say.
The House of Representatives, I have just learned, is going to
introduce a resolution this afternoon along the lines of the
MoveOn.org resolution that was introduced last week, tit-for-tat, they
want a vote in the House to condemn me, a private citizen, for
something I did not say.  These people have had three, four days now
to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which
doesn't matter.  What they are trying to do is flood a false story
into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the
evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't.

This is not just the anatomy of a smear.  There's much more going on
with this than just smearing me.  There is an attempt, I think, as
they have done throughout my career, to discredit me.  No matter how
many signatures they get on their letter in the Senate, no matter how
many votes they get on their resolution in the House, the idea was
offered, and so far no Republicans have spoken up, but it's early.
After Harry Reid finished reading his letter and then castigating and
excoriating me for something I didn't say and didn't do, he then went
to normal business and Chuck Grassley is up there talking about some
piece of Ted Kennedy legislation.  There has been no response by
Republicans to this yet, and I don't know that there will be.  I have
no clue.  We have some sound bites here of Dingy Harry on the floor of
the Senate this afternoon.  There are four of them, and here is the
first of the four.

REID:  Last week, Rush Limbaugh went way over the line, way over the
line.  While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his
unpatriotic comments I cannot ignore.  During his show last Wednesday,
Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants.  This one was
unremarkable, indistinguishable from his usual drivel, which has been
steadily losing listeners for years, [sic] until he crossed that line
by calling our men and women in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq,
and I quote, &quot;phony soldiers.&quot; [sic]  This comment was so beyond the
pale of decency, and we can't leave it alone.  And yet he followed it
up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha, who was a
37-year active member of the Marine Corps, combat veteran.

RUSH:  (laughing)  I don't quite know how to deal with this.  I mean,
it's not a laughing matter, although it is a laughing matter because
this is such -- you talk about Kafkaesque.  I have just finished an
interview with Clarence Thomas talking about the lies and stuff spread
about him during his confirmation hearings, and now I, little old
private citizen, Rush Limbaugh, the subject of Senate action, the
subject today of House of Representatives action, all based on a
purposely told lie, which they know is a lie, and yet they are
persisting in this.  Followed it up with denials?  I followed it up
with setting the record straight.  By the way, on my website, folks,
all of this is there.  It's been up there all weekend, and we added
something last night that you have to see.

A week ago today, ABC News, Charlie Gibson, World News Tonight, did a
feature with Brian Ross, their investigative reporter, on phony
soldiers!  Last Monday, one week ago today.  I don't see ABC being
denounced.  Their story was on Jesse MacBeth, the same soldier I was
talking about one week ago.  That video is up at RushLimbaugh.com, as
well as an exposé by Brent Bozell's group, the Media Research Center,
on just who Media Matters for America is.  As to Jack Murtha, I just
did a story today saying that he has been sued by a soldier for
calling him a murderer.  I just reported the news today, and yet this
is reported as an attack on Congressman Jack Murtha.  This is
Kafkaesque, it's McCarthy-like, and I think I told you this on many
occasions.  My father would not believe any of this, not because of
the Senate, he just wouldn't believe that his son has become the focal
point of Democrats in the House of Representatives in the Senate,
someone targeted for destruction and smear, as a private citizen. Here
is number two of Senator Reid.

REID:  Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and
character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us.  Rush
Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young man.
He never served in uniform.  He never saw in person the extreme
difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in a
civil war.  He never saw a person in combat.  Yet he thinks that his
opinion on the war is worth more than those who have been on the front
lines.  And what's worse, Limbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces
Radio, which means that thousands of troops, overseas, and veterans
here at home, were forced to hear this attack on their patriotism.
Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology.

RUSH:  (laughing)  He's gotta be a nut.  I cannot believe that they
are actually going this far with this.  I did apologize today to the
troops, Senator Reid, for you, and for Media Matters for America.  If
anybody in this country has been trying to demoralize the troops, it
is you, sir, and your members of the Democrat Party.  You have waved
the white flag of defeat.  You have claimed that they cannot win.  You
are trying to shift the focus from your perception, the perception,
accurately, that people have of you and your party, to me, who
everyone who has listened to me any length of time whatsoever knows
that these allegations are just totally untrue.  As to why I'm on the
Armed Forces Radio network, it was President Clinton's defense
secretary, Les Aspin, who secured an hour of this program on the Armed
Forces Radio network, and because I was requested.  They did a poll of
the troops back then, and the troops requested that this program be on
Armed Forces Radio.  Did you notice in this bite, since I've never
been to combat, I'm not qualified -- which is another liberal assault
on free speech.  If you haven't done something, you're not allowed to
talk about it, Senator Reid says.

I have made troop visits to Afghanistan, Senator, and I have been to
Walter Reed Army hospital, and I have been to several military bases
after the Gulf War one, participating in welcome-home festivities for
the troops coming back from that conflict.  Perhaps I should remind
you of the story, Senator Reid, back in the summer of 2003. I went
home one day and there was a Federal Express package for me.  I didn't
recognize the sender, but I opened it anyway.  Inside, in a Ziploc
bag, was an American flag.  There was a letter written by hand on a
piece of yellow legal paper, and there were five certificates showing
different aircraft.  I read the letter and found out that that flag
had been flown in all five of those aircraft during the original
invasion of Iraq in 2003, in my honor, by each of the five pilots that
piloted those planes.  One was a tanker; the others were bombers and
attack aircraft.  I looked at this, and I started crying.  Doing this
in my honor?  I doubt, Senator Reid, if this happened and it's
happened a couple times since, that if I were really held in such low
regard by the members of the US forces, this probably wouldn't be the
case.

BREAK TRANSCRIPT

RUSH: We have two more Harry Reid sound bites.  By the way, in the
second sound bite, he refers to my dwindling audience or whatever.  In
his dreams, ladies and gentlemen, is this audience getting smaller.
(laughing) There's nothing in any of this that's truthful.  There's
nothing in any of it to believe.  And I would caution you: You know
the truth of this, so listen to it for what it is.  Now, I mentioned
earlier he's prepared a letter that he wants to send to the CEO of
Clear Channel Communications, which syndicates this program, and he
wants as many senators as possible to sign it.  Here's the bite
explaining the letter.

REID:  Here is what we wrote: &quot;Dear Mr. Mays.&quot;  Here's the letter, Mr.
President.  &quot;At the time we signed this letter, 3,801 hundred American
soldiers had been killed in Iraq.  Another 27,936 have been wounded.
One hundred and sixty others awoke this morning on foreign sand far
from home to face the danger and uncertainty of another day at war.
Although Americans of goodwill debate the merits of this war, we can
all agree that those who serve with such great courage deserve our
deepest respect and gratitude.

RUSH:  When have they ever had it from you?

REID:  That's why Rush Limbaugh's recent characterization of troops
who oppose the war as &quot;phony soldiers&quot; is an outrage.  Our troops are
fighting and dying to bring to others the freedoms that many take for
granted.  It is unconscionable that Mr. Limbaugh would criticize them
for exercising the fundamental American right to free speech.  We call
on you to publicly repudiate these comments that call into question
their service and sacrifice and ask Mr. Limbaugh to apologize for his
comments.

RUSH:  This is unreal.  All of that bite is unreal.  This is like a
man who has proclaimed the US military incompetent. They cannot win.
The war is over. It shouldn't be fought. He's done everything possible
to demoralize these troops, and now he's trying to turn that around.
They're trying to get that back.  I told you they'd gone over the
cliff.  They're trying to get back on the page that they love and
support the troops, and they're doing it by trying to suggest I'm the
one who is saying things like they are.  Don't forget his second
lieutenant, Durbin, and what he said about the troops and the people
that work for us at Club Gitmo and Abu Ghraib and a number of other of
these prisons where we were housing prisoners of war and terrorists.
Here's the final of the four bites that we have.

REID:  Mr. President, just as patriotism is exclusive realm of neither
party, taking a stand against those who hate and impugn the integrity
of our troops is a job that belongs to both parties, all of us.  I'm
confident we will see Republicans joining with us in overwhelming
numbers.  &quot;Confident&quot; is the wrong word, Mr. President.  &quot;Hopeful&quot; is
the right word.  So I asked my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans
alike, to join together against this irresponsible, hateful, and
unpatriot[ic] attack by calling on Rush Limbaugh to give our troops
the apology they deserve -- and I hope that all would sign this
letter.

RUSH:  All right. Well, somebody needs to tell him I did apologize to
the troops earlier today, FOR him and FOR the Democrats and FOR the
group that has fed this smear campaign, this bunch of lies that he
knows is false, but he just wants to get this in the Congressional
Record now.  This is in the Congressional Record, and he wants it
there permanently.  This is a way to discredit me and rehabilitate the
Democrats -- and notice who they use to try to rehabilitate
themselves: a private citizen.  I would say this.  What I want to do
now is demand that Harry Reid come on this program and confront me
like a man. Live, unedited, come on this show and let's go at it.  I'm
not going to allow hack politicians to lie about what I said, to cover
up what they have said and done.  These are partisan character
assassins.  They've attacked me just as in the past they've attacked
Robert Bork, Clarence Thomas, and scores of other conservatives.
Senator Reid, it is time for you to stop hiding behind the
speech-and-debate clause and your Senate immunity.

You want to come on this program and call me unpatriotic, come on this
program and call me unpatriotic.  You want to call me a liar, you want
to tell me that I did not say what I said, you come on this program
and you tell me to my face that I said what I did not say.  Stop
hiding behind your special protections as a senator and spewing the
talking points of an embarrassing, partisan hack media group called
Media Matters for America.  Hillary Clinton didn't serve in the
military, by the way, Senator Reid.  She just voted against General
Petraeus.  Barack Obama did not serve in the military, Senator Reid,
and he didn't even show up to vote in support of Petraeus.  John
Edwards didn't serve, and after voting to send our troops to war, he
has undermined them ever since.  It is unconscionable for an esteemed
United States senator to launch an all-out assault on a private
citizen, which is a lie from front to back, in order to cover your own
actions and words, which have been the true demoralization of the US
military -- and if anybody owes the military of this country an
apology, Senator Reid, it is you. It is Jack Murtha. It is Dick
Durbin. It is any and all who have joined your effort to secure defeat
of the United States and the United States military in not only Iraq,
but the war on terror.

Sir, have you no decency left?  Have you no shame whatsoever?

BREAK TRANSCRIPT

RUSH:  Well, now it's a full-fledged assault.  Senator Tom &quot;Dung Heap&quot;
Harkin is on the floor of the Senate denouncing me.  Once again,
Senator Harkin, Senator Reid: Face me like a man and stop hiding
behind the microphones in the Senate where you can say whatever you
want to say.  Come on my program and say all of these things to my
face and let's go at it.  You know, Harry Reid... We've had liberals
here, folks, what they're trying to do -- one other thing -- is put
words in the military's mouth.  They lie about the premise, then they
speak on behalf of the military which they claim to be upset about,
which is what they've been lying about in the first place! They are
the ones who have been condemning the military. They are the ones who
have been demoralizing the military. They are the ones who have -- I
can't say this more powerfully enough -- trying to secure defeat for
the US military.  They know it and everyone else does, and now they
try to turn the tables and make it sound like one of the most ardent
supporters of the US military is being &quot;unpatriotic,&quot; this to cover
their own lack of patriotism.
