Hi again to all. I was asked to come up with a &quot;Statement of Faith&quot; by
one of the heads of an organization I'm involved with (not church).
This person is a Christian.

WOW!! This is really a challenge to me. a 1 pager, he said. How can
I put into 1 page or a million pages a &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;. But I
have to. And I will.

As I've been pondering this request for the last 2 days, I am amazed at
where my mind and heart are going. I can't sleep. But that's OK; I
think the Lord is keeping me awake. He's been talking to me about
this. Tonight, for example, he's taking me back in time. He's been
showing me how my experiences within Christianity have shaped my
&quot;Statement of Faith&quot;.

He had me look again at my childhood where the Catholic kids would make
fun of us who weren't Catholic.

Next, he had me look at the way the Christian Reformed still had the
&quot;Blue Laws&quot; in place when my family moved to Holland, MI when I was 18
years old (Dad: transferred there; &quot;Blue Laws&quot; - an old term, included
what people thought as Biblical rules that the community lived by: In
Holland back then: no baseball on Sunday, had to go to church both in
the morning and in the evening; no work - mandatory closing of all
businesses, etc.. My family and the other families who moved there
from Detroit MI didn't buy into that. We were Christians, too, but
were looked at as if we were heathen. Holland has changed drastically
since then: The Lord of freedom has infiltrated the community)

Next, he had me look at my relationship with the WI Synod Lutheran
Church where I mistakenly bought into its teaching that the Lord
required me to choose the best denomination - WELS IS the best
according to it- and then forsake all others while embracing hook, line
and sinker what the WELS teaches. (Sad to say, the WELS has excellent
doctrinal positions on both Justification and Sanctification by grace.
Martin Luther and Walther have been my mentors.) I would still be a
member of the WELS IF I had been allowed to pray with and attend
worship services in other denominations as well. I wanted it ALL!!!!)

And in-between all that while visiting numerous other Protestant
churches in the Milw. area, I've heard things like, &quot;Those Lutherans
aren't born again because they can't name the day they were saved and
don't speak in tongues,&quot; from the Pentecostals. &quot;Those Pentecostals and
Baptists don't know the true God - they rely on their emotions,&quot; from
the Lutherans, &quot;Those who claim Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven
are nutty,&quot; from people within yet another Lutheran &quot;branch&quot;, etc. etc.
etc.

Damn!

ALL those people, including the Catholics!!!!, are Christians! My
experience, then, within the religion called &quot;Christianity&quot; has been
very negative. And I'm not saying I haven't been a part of the
negative! I'm a fighter and when I'm pushed into a corner I'll fight
back; many times I haven't fought fair.

So what does this have to do with my &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;?

The Lord, just tonight, reminded me of my calling. And my calling has
EVERYTHING to do with what I just shared. He reminded me of HIS
mission for my life. He said, &quot;You are a missionary to those
spiritually abused by Christianity as well as to people who don't know
Jesus. If other Christians benefit from your teachings geared toward
the spiritually abused and those who don't know Me, that's great. But
they are not your focus.&quot;

WOW! Thank you Jesus. And that's why Metro West was founded in the
first place.

He alerted me to the fact that, since my writings and
teaching/preaching are always geared to the &quot;audience&quot; named above,
others within Christianity who hear or read my stuff and haven't
experienced or witnessed the craziness, won't always understand my
passion for the Gospel - because they've known and experienced the love
of God all of their lives. They haven't seen Christianity screw with
people's minds. I can't even imagine something like that! I'm so
happy for those people and I'm glad they have not. (I know many WELS,
Christian Reformed, Baptists, Pentecostals, Catholics, etc. who haven't
been messed with - SO I'M NOT HERE TO TRASH DENOMINATIONS!!!!!! I'm
not going to join any denomination or church because there is something
of the Lord in ALL of them. I want them ALL. Please keep in mind I
have made myself accountable to 4 ordained pastors and to many close
friends. I'm not a rogue Christian.)

BUT, BUT: He also showed me the reality of my life since I was a
little girl. Through my mother's testimony of Jesus Christ, I came to
faith in Him. And then my father's conversion later in life led me to
see Jesus in an even deeper way. My Lord reminded me that my heritage
IN HIM was not based on any religion but on His love for me. Always
and forever.

So, as I'm processing all this in the middle of the night, I think I've
come up with my &quot;Statement of Faith.&quot; It's pretty simple. Here it is:

&quot;My Lord Jesus Christ opened my heart to know that He is my God through
no decision of my own - that my life with Him is a gift - bought and
paid for by His own blood. He bought and paid for my life even though
I am a sinner. He loves me for who I am and not for what I do. He is
committed to me even when I'm not committed to Him. By His Holy
Spirit, He will lead me to Him until the day I day. One day at a time.
Jesus Christ is my life. I do not know life apart from Him. We are
one.&quot;

If anyone would like to share their &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;, please do so.
Thank you all for listening!!!

A comprehensive statement of everything I believe would take a lot more
than a couple of pages. But if I had to boil it all down, it would come
down to God has reconciled us to Himself through the cross of Jesus
Christ, and we're all accepted by Him. We're OK in His sight. And
because of this, relationship with God and eternal life is ours as a
free gift, just by asking for it.

If there's a practical application to the gospel that has made the most
difference in my life, that is it, no doubt. I've been able to stop
looking at people as righteous or wicked, in fellowship or backslidden,
and any other delineations we come up with when we try to measure
peoples' spiritual state. I'm better able to see everyone as OK because
God has accepted them.

Hey Pammie,

I'm reading all of your e-mails so please keep sending them. One
question keeps coming up though - why do you always refer to God and
Jesus as &quot;my&quot; God and &quot;my&quot; Jesus - they are for everyone so I'm totally
confused by your word choice. They are the same God and Jesus for all
people so please let me know what you mean. God never changes right???

Love, _______

The above is from my precious friend (private e-mail). She's not on
the board - doesn't like the internet system. Anyway, I want to
address it. I never thought about it before.

When I say &quot;My Jesus&quot; or &quot;My God&quot; it's because it's the way I see Him.
Others may not see Him in the way I do so I don't want to intrude. So
in a sense, I'm taking responsibility instead of assuming everyone sees
Him like I do. Jesus said, &quot;My sheep hear my voice.&quot; Jesus gives me
direction in certain areas that may be the opposite of someone else's.
Etc.

HOWEVER, there's a bigger piece to it than all of that. He's MY Jesus.
I love saying that. He may be yours, too. But I love to say He's
&quot;mine&quot;. Just like I say to my kids, &quot;You're MY Kyle,&quot; and &quot;Your're MY
Laura.&quot; I say that out of love.

John, Jesus' disciple, often referred to Himself &quot;as the disciple Jesus
loved.&quot; I wrote about that awhile back.

I love MY Jesus! He's yours, too. And He's MINE! Mine, Mine, Mine!

Pam,
I'm really glad you clarified this; i especially like your point about
Jesus being &quot;yours,&quot; as a term of endearment; the way you talk about your
kids or your hubby.
I must admit I was at first thrown off by this as well, because I
immediately thought of the New Age notion that my truth is my truth is myt
truth and yor truth is your truth.
but I know you don't mena it that way; again, thanks for shedding light on
your beautiful words.

There is great discussion about post-modernism/modernims, and bunches
of other things. I'm still wanting to hear how some of you came to
Jesus. What was it that moved your hearts - ( I know the Holy Spirit
is WHO creates the faith) - but what did He use? How did it go down?
WHen people do that, my faith grows AND I have a better understanding
of the passion behind some of the other posts.

Some may say they came to faith in church. What were the details? Who
helped you? etc.

Rob, I couldn't have said it any better, really. So my experience has
been this:

I was baptized as a baby, and I know that the Lord began his intimacy
with me there. And ever since I can remember, I have talked to him and
sang with him when I was little. And there was only one time, when I
had been through so much lame religious crap, that I finally said,
&quot;God, either you show me truth, or you are OUT.&quot; Laura was huge in
reminding me who &quot;my Jesus&quot; is. I was 15 then.

So that was a re-confirmation of my faith, I suppose. And Pam taught
me how to pray without reciting something.

I was born and raised in a family that is heavily involved in church.
I liked going to church for the most part as a kid: my cousins and
other friends were there, and there was a lot of music and singing, and
I love singing. After a while the songs and the organ music started
seeming really lame, but it still gave me a chance to do a lot of
singing.

I won't blame the church for this, but in my case the church stuff
obscured Jesus. Instead of seeing Jesus himself, all I could see were
stained glass depictions of an other-worldly and unapproachable Jesus.
Instead of hearing what Jesus had to say to me, I was hearing what some
early seventeenth century translators said that Jesus said. And
catechism class was, like Christopher Hill wrote in &quot;Holidays and Holy
Nights,&quot; like endlessly studying the rules of basketball apart from
getting out on the court and playing the game.

But I looked at my parents and some other Christians, and I could tell
they had something real and good. That kept me looking in the
direction of Jesus for answers.

When I was eighteen and in college and realizing how totally unequipped
to handle real life I was, I got really depressed. The Holy Spirit
rescued me when I started going to a Bible study in the student union
at UW-Waukesha and heard about God making promises to me. I'm sure I'd
heard it plenty of times before, but that's when it started to really
sink in: God promised to love me, so he HAS to love me, regardless of
how unlovable I might be. God promised to forgive me, so he HAS to
forgive me, regardless of how unforgivable my actions might have been.
And God promised to save me, so he HAS to save me, regardless of how
unsalvagable I might be. That freed me up to enjoy life again, or
maybe for the first time.
