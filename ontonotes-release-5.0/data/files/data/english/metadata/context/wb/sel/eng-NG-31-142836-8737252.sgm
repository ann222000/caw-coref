JOIN US TODAY at 10:30 AM: Celebrating UU Congregations in Africa

Randi Hetrick

How are UU congregations in Africa similar or different from our own? What
are their challenges? Are they accepted by other people of faith in their
communities? How much do you know about the spread of UU principles to other
communities around the world? Randi Hetrick, a Southern California UU, has
spent considerable time with UU congregations in Africa and will share her
inspiring stories and unique UU experiences with us.

JOIN US NEXT SUNDAY: at 10:30 AM What it Means to be Family

Edie Mickey-Silveria, Valerie Wilson-Lindberg, Kathy Rogers

The concept of family has changed in the United States in the last few
years. Do you define family as only blood relations? As you have walked your
life path, have you met people that you consider &quot;family&quot; but who are not
blood relations? What is the depth of these connections? Does this
congregation constitute a freely chosen family for you? Come and explore the
sacredness of the word &quot;family.&quot;

EDUCATION PROGRAM REMINDERS

Aug 19: We continue our much loved &quot;Backpack Project&quot; where we collect
backpacks and school supplies for Long Beach children who are without a
home.  We will collect the supplies donated and begin sorting.  Donations of
backpacks, school supplies, and cash are due no later than today.
Volunteers are welcome to help with this project during the month of August.
Please contact Coleen Maldonado or Tamara Casanova Suzuki if you'd like to
help our children and youth work on this worthwhile project.

INTERESTED IN GREEN SANCTUARY?  Please join us at the Green Sanctuary Forum
today at 12 p.m., in Wylder Hall.  At the Forum, UUCLB members and friends
can trade ideas for sustainable living, link up with others in the
congregation who wish to pursue a Green Sanctuary Action Project, keep up to
date on progress on the Audit, and meet other likeminded people.  Check it
out!  For more information, please contact Carolyn Shadle shad ... @yahoo.com
or Katy Kroll kt.kr ... @verizon.net.

DRUM CIRCLE.  All are welcome today!  Sundays after Service in Wylder Hall
or the Grounds at 12:00 Noon.  Have never drummed?  David will demonstrate
how easy it is to play a drum!  For further information contact David at
Dav ... @DavidD.com.  If you need childcare call Eduarda (562) 867-9888.

HOMEMADE CUPCAKES!!  They are available again today after church during our
community gathering. Your donation of $1.00 will be used to buy
underclothing for the homeless of our community. It's a delicious, though
not fat-free, way to help those most in need. Chocolate or vanilla; we've
got 'em both!

DISCOVERY FORUM FOR SINGLES.  Looking for some lively discussion with other
single people?  Discove

ry meets at 6:30 PM, every Sunday night in the Lounge. You will find a
supportive environment where you can meet and talk about topics of special
interest to singles.  For additional information, contact Roger Grunke (562)

OUR INTERN MINISTER.  The Internship Search Committee is pleased to announce
that Denis Letourneau Paul will begin serving our congregation as the intern
minister starting in September 2007. (UUCLB has been designated as an intern
site and we have the privilege of hosting interns in continuing to develop
and refine their ministerial skills.)  Denis (pronounced DaNee) has been
attending Starr King School for the Ministry in Berkeley, California.  While
serving our congregation he will participate in direct ministerial
responsibilities including preaching, counseling, religious education,
program development and community and social action.

We hope you will join us in welcoming Denis to our church community.  A pot
luck dinner is planned for September 9th so everyone has a chance to meet
and greet Denis.  Watch for more information about the pot luck in the next
few weeks.

ONLY TWO WEDNESDAYS LEFT!  Can it be true? Only two Wednesdays left to enjoy
our summer picnics! If you haven't come out for one of these, now is the
time. The grill is hot by 6:00 p.m. and you need only bring a dish to share
and whatever you would like to grill. Drinks and paper goods are supplied
for a minimal donation. Our picnics take place right here on our church
patio. If you are a new member or a recent visitor, it's a great way to get
to know more people in the church. See you there! (And by the way, thank
Sandy Kroll and Gunnar Nielsson for seeing that these happen every
Wednesday.)

SEPTEMBER 9TH BEGINS..  It begins our trial with two services on Sundays.
One will begin at 9:30 a.m. and the other will begin at 11:15 a.m. We will
have a community gathering over coffee and tea between services. Our
religious education program has a program for our children and youth during
both services, so there's something for everyone. It should be an exciting
year! The Implementation Team of Peter Caldwell, Phyllis Daniel, Eduarda
Diaz-Schwarzbach, and Nancy Krusbe are available to answer questions.

SEEKING EVENTS SEXTON.  A new position, on-call Events Sexton, has been
approved by the Board of Trustees.  This position is on-call, as needed, to
assist renters with events on campus.  The wage range shall be between
$12-15 per hour.  Please pick up an application in the office if interested.
Interviews are tentatively scheduled for 8/28, starting at 5 p.m.

MINISTER ON STUDY LEAVE.  Rev. Marguerite D. Lovett is on her annual
vacation and study leave from July 9-August 27.  She will return to the
pulpit in September.
