Europeans have worked themselves into such a lather over "climate
chaos" that they've set themselves up for a head-on collision between
eco-ideology and economic reality. With the new Democratic Congress
poised to ram through heavy-handed climate legislation, the U.S. may
be heading down the same path. Paul Driessen writes that we can and
should develop new technologies, to further improve energy efficiency,
reduce pollution, and enter a new era of energy generation. But we
need not and must not rush to judgment, trash our economy, or slash
our living standards, just to "do something" about a speculative
climate change "catastrophe."
