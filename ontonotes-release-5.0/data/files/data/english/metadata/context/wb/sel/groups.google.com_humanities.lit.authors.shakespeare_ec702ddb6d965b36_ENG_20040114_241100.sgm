_SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE_ by Stuart Griffiths

&lt;&lt;It is as if Shakespeare had filled whole notebooks with words
and phrases from Golding which took his fancy. Sometimes he minted
them into better phrases, sometimes he used them as he found them.
Either way, they were integrated seamlessly into his dialogues.

Not only Shakespeare: Milton used Golding's Ovid, and
Christopher Marlowe. One of Marlowe's most famous phrases, &quot;Ye
pampered jades of Asia!&quot;, thundered by Tamburlaine, came from &quot;the
pampered jades of Thrace&quot; in Golding. In the 20th century, Ezra Pound
was a great admirer of Golding; and words and phrases from Golding
can be seen in the work of Pound's then pupil, T.S. Eliot.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Taming of the Shrew Act 4, Scene 1

GRUMIO Fie, fie on all tired jades,
on all mad masters, and all FOUL ways!

Was EVER man so beaten?
was EVER man so rayed?
was EVER man so weary?

I am sent before to make a FIRE,
and they are coming after to warm them.
Now, were not I a little pot and soon *H O T*,
my VERy lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue
to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly,
ere I should come by a FIRE to THAW me: but I,
with blowing the FIRE, shall warm myself; for,
. . . a taller man than I will take cold.
------------------------------------------------------
GRUMIO Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!'
and as much news as WILL THAW.
-------------------------------------------------------
[O]h, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
[THAW], and resolve itself into a dew!
----------------------------------------------------
[T]o whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
[H]e was not of an age, but for all time !
[A]nd all the Muses still were in their prime,
[W]hen like Apollo he came forth to warme
[O]ur eares, or like a Mercury to charme !
---------------------------------------------------------
The Two Gentlemen of Verona Act 2, Scene 4

PROTEUS That I did love, for now my love is THAW'd;
Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
BEARS NO IMPRESSION OF THE THING IT WAS.
------------------------------------------------------------
Venus and Adonis Stanza 123

Are on the sudden wasted, THAW'd and done,
As mountain-snow melts with the MIDDAY SUN.
----------------------------------------------------------
The Rape of Lucrece Stanza 127

'Thou makest the vestal violate her OATH;
Thou blow'st the FIRE when temperance is THAW'd;
------------------------------------------------------
The Merry Wives of Windsor Act 3, Scene 5

FALSTAFF think of that,--a man of my KIDNEY,
--think of that,--that am as subject
to HEAT as BUTTER; a man of continual dissolution
and THAW: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Julius Caesar Act 3, Scene 1

CAESAR To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be THAW'd from the TRUE quality
With that which MELTETH FOOLS; I mean, SWEET words,
Low-crooked court'sies and base SPANIEL-fawning.
------------------------------------------------------------
Much Ado About Nothing Act 2, Scene 1

BENEDICK She told me, not thinking I had been
myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
duller than a great THAW; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her;
she would infect to the north star.
-----------------------------------------------------------
TALOS, THAW ON
----------------------------------------------------------
[T]o life againe, to heare thy Buskin tread,
[A]nd shake a stage : Or, when thy sockes were on,
[L]eave thee alone, for the comparison
[O]f all, that insolent Greece, or haughtie Rome
[S]ent forth, or since did from their ashes come.

Triumph, my Britaine, thou hast one to showe,

[T]o whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
[H]e was not of an age, but for all time !
[A]nd all the Muses still were in their prime,
[W]hen like Apollo he came forth to warme

[O]ur eares, or like a Mercury to charme !
[N]ature her selfe was proud of his designes,
------------------------------------------------------
Hamlet, Prince of Denmark Act 1, Scene 2

HAMLET O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
[T]HAW and resolve itself into a dew!
[O]r that the EVERlasting had not fix'd
[H]is canon 'gainst self-slaughter!
---------------------------------------------------------------
LINES WRITTEN BY [Pooh/Edward] A BEAR OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN

On Monday, when the SUN IS *H O T*
I wonder to myself a lot:

&quot;Now is it TRUE, or is it NOT,&quot;
&quot;That WHAT IS WHICH and WHICH IS WHAT?&quot;
------------------------------------------------------------
_The Ritual Mating of the King &amp; the Whore_

&lt;&lt;The agniHOTra, the sacrifice in honor of Agni, the Hindu Fire-god.
This oblation consists of throwing BUTTER balls into the fire.
The BUTTER represents the fat victims which were formerly used.

The sacrifice is performed at SUNrise &amp; SUNset (SANDHYA),
the two crepuscles of the SUN.

Agni is identified with the SUN and, more exactly, with
the Fallen SUN that inflames the earth at the world's end.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------
-- There's a smell of burn, she said.
Did you leave anything on the fire?

-- The KIDNEY! he cried suddenly.
-------------------------------------------------------
The Merry Wives of Windsor Act 3, Scene 5

FALSTAFF: I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether; next, to be COMPASSED, like a good
BILBO, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own GREASE: think of that,--a
man of my KIDNEY,--think of that,--that am as subject
to HEAT as BUTTER; a man of continual dissolution
and THAW: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
half stewed in GREASE, like a Dutch dish, to be
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing HOT,
in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
that,--hissing HOT,--think of that, Master Brook.
----------------------------------------------------------
Prologue&quot; to Gargantua and Pantagruel -- Fran√ßois Rabelais

And now, my hearties, be gay, and gayly read the rest,
with ease of body and in the best of KIDNEY!
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton KIDNEY at Buckley's.
Fried with BUTTER, a SHAKE of pepper. Better a pork KIDNEY at Dlugacz's.

A KIDNEY oozed bloodgouts on the WILLOWpatterned dish: the last.

While he unwrapped the KIDNEY the cat mewed hungrily against him.
Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say they won't eat pork.
Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and
dropped the KIDNEY amid the sizzling BUTTER sauce.

He prodded a fork into the KIDNEY and slapped it oVER: then fitted the
teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. EVERything on it?

He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. Pungent smoke
shot up in an angry Jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong
of the fork under the KIDNEY he detached it and turned it turtle
on its back. Only a little burned. He tossed it off the pan on
to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy TRICKLE oVER it.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------
Gush out my TRICKLING TEARS,
like mighty floods of rain:
My knight, alas, through FOUL mishap
most CRUEL death hath slain.
-- Emilia's song from _Palamon and Arcite_ (1566)

Drown me you TRICKLING TEARS, you WAILful WIGHTs of WOE;
Come help these hands to rent my hairs, my rueful HAPs to show
On whom the scorching flames of love doth feed you see;
Ah a lalalantida, my dear dame hath thus tormented me.

The TRICKLING TEARS that falls along my cheeks,
The secret sighs that shows my inward grief,
The present PAINs perforce that love ay seeks,
Bids me renew my cares without relief
In WOEful song, in dole display,
My pensive heart for to bewray.
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with
discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done to a turn.

He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy
and ate piece after piece of KIDNEY.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;In conversations with Frank Budgen in 1918, Joyce explained that
writing a novel was like composing music. When asked how chords or
motifs could be incorporated into the writing, Joyce gave the less
than enlightening reply: &quot;A man might eat KIDNEYs in one chapter,
suffer from a KIDNEY disease in another, and one of his
friends could be kicked in the KIDNEY in another chapter.&quot;&gt;&gt;

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch.
Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liVER and KIDNEY.

Tenderly Bloom over liVERless BACON saw the tightened features strain.
Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme.
Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box.
Stave it off awhile. Sings too: Down among the dead men.
Appropriate. KIDNEY pie. Sweets to the.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Much Ado About Nothing Act 2, Scene 1

BENEDICK O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
An oak but with one GREEN LEAF on it would have answered
her; my VERy visor began to assume life and scold
with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
duller than a great THAW; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and EVERy word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to
the NORTH STAR. I would not marry her, though
she were endowed with all that Adam bad left him
before he transgressed: she would have
made Hercules have turned spit, yea,
and have cleft his club to make the FIRE too.
-----------------------------------------------------
Timon of Athens Act 4, Scene 3

TIMON: Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.

[To the gold]

O thou SWEET king-killer, and dear divorce
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
Thou EVER young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
Whose blush doth THAW the consecrated snow
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
That solder'st close impossibilities,
And makest them kiss!
that speak'st with EVERy tongue,
To EVERy purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
May have the world in empire!
-----------------------------------------------
The Two Gentlemen of Verona Act 2, Scene 4

PROTEUS I WILL. [Exit VALENTINE]
Even as one HEAT another HEAT expels,
Or as one NAIL by strength drives out another,
So the remembrance of my former love
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
Her TRUE perfection, or my false transgression,
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
That I did love, for now my love is THAW'd;
Which, like a WAXen image, 'gainst a FIRE,
BEARS NO IMPRESSION OF THE THING IT WAS.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Even as the WAX doth melt, or dew consume away
Before the SUN, so I, behold, through careful thoughts decay,
For my best luck leads me to such sinister state
That I do WASTE with others' love, that hath myself in hate,
And he that beats the bush, the wished bird not gets,
But such I see as sitteth still and holds the fowling nets.
. . . .
Thus like a WOEful WIGHT I wove my web of WOE;
The more I would weed out my cares, the more they seem to grow.
The which betokeneth HOPE, forsaken is of me,
That with the carefu-L CUL-VER climbs the worn and WITHERED tree
To entertain my thoughts, and there my HAP to moan,
That never am less idle, lo, than when I am alone.
