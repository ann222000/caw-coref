Hi,

I currently have workspace file that has a saved query in it. This
query links an access database to my spatial dataset, hence allowing
me to map the access data info. Simple so far. There are several
thematic layers created using the linked acess data. When the access
database is updated and i reopen the workspace file I can view the
updated access data in Mapnifo, but the thematic layers are not
updated. In fact even if i try to re-create thematic layers the
updated data is treated very stange, like its there, but not really
there. I was wondering if there is a way to have the thematic layers
refreshed in the workspace file.

Should I be going down the ODBC connection path to resolve this?

I have limited (nil??) knowledge on writing MAPBASIC code and
currently don't have MAPBASIC package anyway.

Using MI V8.

Thanks
Pete

Same question.

I believe ODBC connection is the proper way to do it, but since I
usually package an Access database and a thematic map on a CD as away
to distribute the data, creating and ODBC seem to be complicated
