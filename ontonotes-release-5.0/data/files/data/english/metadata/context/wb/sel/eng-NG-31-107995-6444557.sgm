I went out today with a mirror and flashlight to look up into my 1/2"
drillpress chuck to see how to detach it.

When I took out the drillbit, shavings fell out.  I blew it out with air,
and chucked up another bit.  It ran a lot smoother than that one.

Soooooooooo, I think my drill press is not as big a POS as I once thought.
I think I just need to pay attention to some of the obvious simple things
that can cause fluctuations in machinery and measurements.

I still want a better one, but at least this one is running just a little
better.

The strip on the side that has teeth on it is held in place with two conical
rings, top and bottom, with Allen hex bolts.  How hard would have it been to
drill and tap two holes to keep this track from wandering around?  Not a
lot, but just one of the cheap characteristics of this machine.

At least I get some more experience drilling and tapping.  Looks like it's
time to go buy a drill and tap set.  I love it when I can justify buying
some new tool.  (or better yet, a SET)  I think I'll go open an account at
Grainger again.

Moral:  it's usually something small and obvious.

It's the same on my 17" Jet.  I understood that to allow rotation of
the table around the column while still retaining the rack in the
table groove with the pinion.  To retain the same functionality with a
fixed rack would be complex (read expensive).

Great -- though you have to wonder how the chuck got filled with

Actually -- it would have cost a lot *less* to mount it as you
suggest -- but then you would not be able to swing the table to the side
to handle either something with an awkward shape bolted to the table
tilted over on its side, or to get it totally out of the way for drilling
something large stood on the base of the drill press.

I far prefer it as it is designed -- and as mine happens to be
(a 16-speed Taiwanese one from about 1977 or so.)  And it has not broken
in all those years, so they must have done *something* right. :-)

Have a look at eBay auction #180086523200 which someone else on
this newsgroup won.  This one uses a somewhat similar method for
cranking the *head*, not the table up and down. (It is a radial arm
drill press), but it has the rack gear ending in a big meaty collar
which clamps to the column to prevent rotation when you don't want it,
and to allow it when you do.  You *could* add such a collar to what you
have to allow locking the table from rotating around the column, at the
cost of some travel in the table's range.

1)      Sometimes you may want to bolt the workpiece down to the base
of the drill press.  Being able to move the table allows you to
keep the drill chuck centered over the base.

2)      Swinging the head partially unbalances the drill press, since it
is designed to bear the off-center weight on the base, which is
longer than it is wide.  Thus -- especially with an off-center
load, you may topple the drill press.

Yes -- you *should* have it anchored to the shop floor --
however, how many of us *actually* have done that?  (I know that
I haven't. :-)

I haven't drilled anything big and heavy enough yet to get into a balance
problem.  But when I do bolt the sliding vise and workpiece on the table,
and have to move things around to get the center punched starting point
right under the tip of the bit, all that maneuverability sure helps.  One
thing, though, that I learned on the first few drill holes is to watch and
not drill holes in the table once you punch through the workpiece.

The aim of untold millions is to be free to do exactly as they choose
and for someone else to pay when things go wrong.

In the past few decades, a peculiar and distinctive psychology
has emerged in England. Gone are the civility, sturdy independence,
and admirable stoicism that carried the English through the war years
. It has been replaced by a constant whine of excuses, complaints,
and special pleading. The collapse of the British character has been
as swift and complete as the collapse of British power.

Since I've owned this drill press (and a little Cameron Micro
Precision sensitive drill press) from new, I've managed to avoid
drilling "oil" holes in either.  But in part because I will usually use
a drill press vise with the bit centered over a gap in the vise's bed,
or I will support some kinds of workpieces on 2x4 -- where I don't
*care* if I drill into that a ways. :-)

A recent job involved a lot of drilling in an awkward shaped
workpiece (steel -- 6" x 30" x 1/4" thick) from everywhere from near the
middle to near the ends.  What I did was bolt two 2x4s to the table
sticking out far enough to one side so the whole length could be
supported while drilling near the ends, and enough to keep the balance
of the workpiece reasonable when drilling near the center.  The 2x4s
were attached via lag screws from under the table, and the tiny bit of
the points which stuck through were kissed with an angle grinder to take
them just below the surface of the wood.  The two 2x4s were separated by
the diameter of the center hole in the table and thus could provide a
gap for the drill bit to protrude into for all of the holes.  I did have
to rotate the table a bit to bring the gap in line with the chuck when
the table was offset a bit.

Since the workpiece was only being drilled #7 holes (for 1/4-20
tapping), and then being tapped with a TapMatic head, the weight of the
and length of the workpiece, and the friction against the 2x4s was
enough so I did not need to clamp it down, as I certainly would have
done with larger holes.

Those 2x4s and their lag screws and fender washers are now kept
near the drill press for the next time I have to do something like this.
The other two sections of the 10' 2x4 were used under a composite
workbench top to provide anti-tipping support for a 24" DiAcro bench
shear -- secured to the 2x4s (which ran all the way from front to back
of the table) with more lag screws.

I did once start with a virgin drill press at work, but as I was
not the only one using it, it was not long before it started to grow
an arc of dimples. :-)

I had seen too many with major arcs of dimples of various sizes,
(and been offended by it) which is why I was so careful with my own
drill presses.

Enjoy,
DoN.

&gt; Yes, that was pointed out to me.  Is it a good thing to keep the post oiled
&gt; to help it move around, or just WD40 it when you're turning it, or just keep
&gt; it clean, as the oiling and WD40ing would just cause dust and dirt to stick
&gt; to it?
">

I would use WD-40 and paper towels to clean the shipping
preservative off the column, and then *protect* it with Vactra No. 2
waylube (which I have on hand anyway).  WD-40 runs off to easily, and
dries out too quickly, absorbing water as it does so, so it encourages
rust if it is all you are using to protect the surface.  And it is *way*
too thin to offer much lubrication for something like moving a drill
press table on the column.

Vactra No. 2 is a sticky enough lube so it will stay on the
column.

If you're drilling something dirty, like cast iron, make a
half-tube of cardboard to protect the column from the thrown grunge and
chips -- or clean it off with WD-40 again, and re-lube with Vactra No. 2
*after* that job is done.

Enjoy,
DoN.
