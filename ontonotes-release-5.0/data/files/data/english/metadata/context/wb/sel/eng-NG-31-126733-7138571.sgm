A $20 million grant awarded to a consortium of four research
universities including Duke University Medical Center will help
scientists collaborate to develop the powerful computing systems and
analyses to trace the origins of neurologic disease from alterations
in the basic structural information of the human genome to the
diseases they produce.

By focusing on mouse models of neurologic disease, scientists at Duke
University, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), California
Institute of Technology (Caltech) and University of California at San
Diego (UCSD) hope to make basic discoveries about the genetic basis of
neuropsychiatric diseases and drug abuse that will lead to more
effective treatments

The project -- funded by the National Center for Research Resources
(NCRR), a division of the National Institutes of Health -- will be
known as the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN).

Construction of the computer infrastructure for the project will be
coordinated by scientists at the UCSD Supercomputer Center and will
also involve neuroscientists and imaging specialists from the UCSD,
UCLA and Caltech in Pasadena, Calif.

Medical researchers have long used mouse models that mimic specific
human maladies to decipher the causes of the disease and to test new
drugs. But now, said the participating scientists, by harnessing the
unique abilities of laboratories at the four institutions, they will
soon have a new perspective on a number of important neurological
diseases.

"This project will provide the needed infrastructure to allow
neuroscientists studying such devastating diseases as Parkinson's
disease and schizophrenia to integrate information ranging in scale
from the whole brain down to a single neuron, the functional unit of
the brain," said G. Allan Johnson, director of the Center for In Vivo
Microscopy at Duke. "This will lay the foundation enabling
neuroscientists throughout the world to bring together imaging
abilities and other information required to understand the growing
number of mouse models of neurologic diseases."

The Center for In Vivo Microscopy, which will receive $1.5 million of
the project grant, has been funded for 15 years by the NCRR as a
National Resource. The center has been a pioneer in the field of
magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM), which will be used to examine and
evaluate disease processes in a number of mouse models. MRM, the
cousin to clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is founded on the
same physical principles.

Through the use of higher field magnets and specialized imaging
hardware and software, Johnson's group has achieved resolution of more
that 100,000 times that typical of clinical MRI.

Johnson will serve as principal investigator of one of two
subcomponents of the BIRN. He will head the Mouse Brain Imaging
Research Network (MBIRN), which will concentrate initially on two
critical models of human neurologic disease: the dopamine transporter
knockout mouse and a model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.
A parallel effort within BIRN will allow scientists at multiple sites
including Duke to share human MRI data.

"We have chosen to focus on an important mouse model of human disease
that has been developed by Marc Caron and his colleagues here at
Duke," Johnson said. "The model has many attributes of the symptoms of
schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder as well as symptoms
accompanying drug abuse. (MR) microscopy permits accurate 3D
comparison of the structural difference between the model and controls
in a volumetric fashion not possible with conventional 2D histologic
sections."

Mouse brains imaged at Duke will be sent to Arthur Toga's National
Resource at UCLA were the specimens will be cryosectioned for
comparative histopathology. Powerful statistical software developed at
UCLA will enable probabilistic alignment and comparison of MRM and
histologic sections. Additional specimens will be sent on to Mark
Ellisman's National Resource at UCSD where Ellisman and his colleagues
will explore differences at the cellular and subcellular level using
confocal microscopy and high voltage electron tomography. A parallel
effort that will be undertaken by Russell Jacobs at Caltech will use
MR microscopic data from his laboratory at the Beckman Institute in
conjunction with data from UCLA and UCSD to explore a model of
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. All the data will be
assembled into federated databases using a new approach to knowledge
engineering developed at UCSD by Maryann Martone and Ellisman.

By examining the models across scales ranging from the whole brain to
the subcellular level, researchers will be able to get a much more
comprehensive picture of the models which can then be connected to the
human disease.

Using the high-speed Internet 2 network connections among the sites,
images can be rapidly incorporated into a set of federated databases,
from which three-dimensional images can be extracted and integrated
across a wide range of scale. Internet 2 will also support interactive
videoconferencing between all of the collaborating scientists. None of
this can be accomplished today, although many of the elements of the
systems exist, Johnson explained.

"BIRN is the nation's first test bed for sharing and mining data for
both basic and clinical research using the next generation of the
Internet," Johnson said. "It depends on the new computational and
networking technologies that have been developed to bring researchers
together over the Internet. BIRN is a test of a new mode of doing
large scale medical science."

"We have chosen two very important models of neurologic disease as the
drivers to push the collaborative infrastructure," Johnson continued.
"As this infrastructure grows and matures, there is little doubt that
BIRN will expand to accommodate a much broader range of neurologic
diseases. In the post genomic era, tools such as BIRN will be critical
if we hope to effectively correlate the wealth of information required
to relate the genome to its expression."
