Call for PISS on Atlanta/Beauty/Olympiada

I think the time has come to invoke a PISS.

It sounds as if most folks here have wearied, recently or long ago, of the
never-ending flood of messages from Atlanta/Beauty/Olympiada/Venus/Vif/ad
nauseum.

(And here I'll claim an embarrassed mea culpa for having been drawn into the
discussions to a rather surprising degree in the last couple of days.)

I'm tired of the constant spiraling up and down of her moods, from penitent to
crazy to hostile to abusive to just plain loony and obscene.  Up/down,
back/forth, high/low.  I'm tired of being drafted into what amounts to a giant
group therapy session, and I'm tired of the incessant and frankly stupid retorts
about how often she's lied; they clutter up the group almost as badly as
Atlanta's own posts.

I don't know anyone here (with the possible exception of one guy who virtually
never posts here, one who posts only infrequently, and only one who posts
regularly) who thinks anything positive has come from Atlanta's flood of
messages.

I wish her well, and I hope someday she's healthy again, but that is the extent
of my interest, concern, and participation in her and her postings.

Therefore, I request a PISS.

I will not reply to her again, no matter how provacative her statements.  I will
not talk *about* her.  I will not worry at all about lurkers who might read her
nonsense; lurkers aren't part of this group.  I will not worry about novices and
newbies who might read her bizarre statements; they'll have to muster up enough
sense to ask about things that confuse them, just like most of the rest of us
managed to do.

In other words, I'm going to do my damndest to do *my* part to see that if she
hangs around here, she'll pretty much be talking to herself.

That is not fair. I totally disagree with this woman. I can not believe
this. I am not leaving. That was totally uncalled for. I would not
submit to her, so she is doing this. I am striving to be successful.
Do not listen to her.

Truly Clooful said his sub is his equal in all things except in some
decisions. Well, this is one decision I am his equal in. I disagree with
his decision that I stop posting here immediately and permanently. I
will not. I value Shirley's writing, and Troia's, and Grant's, and
fnordikin's and Whitewater's, to start with. I am sorry for causing so
much trouble. I am a pervert. And I am religious. The perverts reject me
for being religious. The religious reject me for being perverted.

I will not leave this community.

Oh yes, I value Lynn's writing as well, so much that I told Mr. White
about her.

And dave's, and Barry's, and alcibiade's, and Mr. King's.

So on and so forth. I will deal with the criticism.

Hi, well, while agreeing with a lot of what you say, I beg to differ on
lurkers, I do think that  in the  main we have strived to help her in the
only ways we know. If nothing is coming of that help, much like any
treatment, then its time to try something else. If vif et al cannot see
that, its not our fault at all. I imagine she is reading this and getting
annoyed, well keep the  anger and direct it at some new line of therapy, for
this is merely prolonging the way you are, we are a whipping boy, a
replacement mentor or parent or whatever. What you need to do now is make
bold decisions and get into real life raw in tooth and claw, just like the
rest of us do.

So, it may seem cruel, but sometimes you need to be cruel to be kind. I am
reminded of a social worker who helped someone over their fear of bus
travel, and in the end, that person had to say, I'm no longer going to be on
that bus, and you will manage, you have the skills now.

Well, I'm not sure that vif has the skills,  but if not, then its time for
someone else to start to address the problem, not us.

My only proviso about not responding is if I do not recognise the alias.

So dear newbie, the action of ignoring someone who is being  detrimental to
the group is what the term means, to stop you looking it up,in this case,
its not because we hate the person, its because they are disruptive, and not
in fact apparently getting anything from said discussions, and it is masking
the true reason for the group, it is not fair that one person should have
the  lion's share of a resource like this, so we call a halt to it, and
please refrain from responding if you can. Beware of her mutating though.

Good luck vif, I mean that, but enough is enough I feel.

This is not about social skills. I already told you what it was about
yesterday. As that is of not of interest to this list I will deal with
it elsewhere. Sorry for the trouble. I am quite sure the lot of you do
not understand what I am up against, and again, it has nothing to do
with society and everything to do with the Church.
I thank you all for letting me know who will not be reading my messages,
it will cut down on traffic on my newsreader and I can focus on those
who are worth my time.

Any message that is from the filtered address or that contains

I am sorry you feel that way. I am not those things you state I am. I am

God will be the judge of us all so I have to let go of your judgment of me.

I am sorry you have such a low opinion of me. As you stated, you do not
know me in my community nor in real life.
I do not think a woman should quest for anything. I have told you this
many times. I am working on myself so that I may attract a master suited

I will not announce your are my master. I was not having a delusion. I
am glad we have had no one on one conversations. I do not really wish to
know you. I find you to be most unpleasant.

I am glad you are not anonyma. You and he write alike. But that is
neither here nor there.

I did not say we had a relationship. You gave me two choices, the first
choice being a nasty one, and the second choice being one that held no
promise of certainty. You painted me into a corner. You denied being
someone and then you confirmed it. Ultimately it is not up to me to
decide who you are.

As you rightly stated, I have had no conversation with you outside of
this group. I would not wish to converse with someone who took such a
low opinion of me. I know my worth and my sweetness. You do not. I
suspect you project your shadow anima on to me, for that seems to be the
only place where you could get such cruel ideas about me.

I could not submit to you because you are already have a relationship. I
am very monogamous as I stated and it is a violation of my principles to
get involved with someone who is involved with someone else. That is why
I have not been able to submit to you from the get go. I need a clean
and exclusive relationship. I hope you understand this.

If you were single and available, I could submit to you, but you never
were. Why don't you tell the truth about yourself?

Ultimately, you don't seem very Christian to me for you are so mean and
cruel hearted. You really don't deserve to put the cross before your
name. You do not set a Christian example for the world. There is no
sweetness in your soul, none at all.

I hope that you can return to the faith and to the Church and to God and
find some healing balm for your wounded soul. My heart grieves for you
and the pain you are in.

So I take it this is another who is scorning me, and another to mark as
read. All right. Things shall get quiet. There are  a few decent people
in here. Today Smiler has been the gentle one.
It is true I do not like to read profanity, not even the word "piss".
Nor many of the other profane words that are used here. They are not
proper words for a Christian woman to be reading. I keep track of this
thread to know who to filter out.
As I stated, there are a few people whom I enjoy corresponding with such
as Smiler, but those numbers are dropping.

I find it truly amazing that you prefer conversing about filthy subjects
as opposed to speaking with me, but what do I know? Perhaps this is all
for the best.

I've always found public announcements of the contents of people's
killfiles a hoot. You can add me now, as can anyone else who wants to worry
about which posts I choose to respond to. Atlanta I sort of understand. The
people who are obsessed with her I don't. And from my perspective, if
there's a problem here, those folks are the root of it. There are what,
maybe 6 or 8 high volume posters who can't leave it alone? If that core
group of volume posters found another focus for their obsessions this would
become a fairly quiet group again. At this point it looks like most of them
have not joined the piss. Several of them clearly lack the required self
control. I don't think I've seen a killfile "war" before. It should be
interesting.

As attractive as the spectacle of half this group killfilling the other
half is, there is another alternative. On another group I follow, which has
a propensity for wandering off topic, many of us add [OT] to the subject
line of off topic posts as a matter of politeness. The folks who chose to
filter off topic posts miss a lot of good stuff, but that's their choice. If
it would make a significant difference in the noise level here and aid those
who have trouble leaving it alone I would consider adding [AT] to the
subject line of posts that had anything to do with Atlanta.

Either way: Satan herself could be posting here. If someone said they
would killfile me for chatting with Satan the answer will always be--Go for
it.

That would be what I'd normally do.  But at least one of them also has

It makes sense if you're trying to remove someone from your awareness.
Killfiling the one person isn't sufficient because you keep finding them
reflected in the posts of others. Of course, the question becomes: once
you've killfiled all those others do you still have a worth while group
remaining? On another group I follow I keep a small killfile of people who
have a lot of time to say something and nothing to say. As they're high
volume posters I still see parts of their posts pretty regularly, even
though they've earned their way into a lot of killfiles. OTOH if I announced
who these people were and my intention to add others based on whether or not
they respond to their posts I would expect widespread laughter.

If all the noise you're trying to block out is related to one

PISS is a great way to cut down on the off-topic chatter,
but it doesn't do anything to promote on-topic discussion.
I think we can do better.  I'm therefore proposing PISS ANT.

What is PISS ANT?  I'm glad you asked!  We all know that the
original PISS is a Passive Ignorance Silence Strike-- when a
troll is flooding a newsgroup, the majority of the participants
just agree to ignore everything it says.  With any luck,
the troll will get tired of talking to itself and go away.

I vow that on any day that I encounter a post from the troll or
someone feeding it, I will post at least one on-topic message
in another thread.  By doing that, maybe signal will overwhelm
the noise.

PISS ANT stands for Passive Ignorance Silence Strike And
Normal Topics.

Does it?  It means posting one on-topic message per day, on days

For me, posting every day is the ambitious part. KNow that sounds funny.

Oh my goodness! See that book at the bottom of the page? I despise it!
We discussed it here, me and Dan. I hate that book with a passion. I
finally tossed it. Some monk from some monastery gave me that book and
tried to get me to swallow it hook line and sinker before I married. I
absolutely refused. In fact my former 'Christian' community lambasted
me for not respecting my husband! Give me something to respect was my
position. Oh I know, as my family said "you picked him". Yep I did, and
I tossed him too, just like that book. Ha ha.
I loathed that book so much I finally called up my godfather to
complain about that monk, now hieromonk, and he told me to chew up the
meat and spit out the bones in regards to that now hieromonk! If that
is what Truly Clooful or Renate has in mind, forget it! I will not
submit that way. What a horrendous notion.

I also take issue with raising daughters to be submissive, as is

&gt;&gt;&gt; No flogs, please....simply a bit of twisted and probably rather dismal

&gt;&gt; Actually this commentary on submission is not off-base (but does seem to

&gt; Agreed...

&gt; I also take issue with raising daughters to be submissive, as is
&gt; condoned by other articles within this particular site.  Every young

Oh, now I know who you are! *g*  (It's been a little while since you
posted.)

I have to offer a strong "ditto".  My own daughter is definitely
independent, strong, capable, intelligent, responsible, etc. (sorry, but
I *am* her Mom!!!) and yet she also has already figured out that she's a
submissive masochist (yet hasn't had intercourse quite yet ... but some
of us do know before that act, and she is not sexually uninformed.)

Although I have a little trouble dealing with it at times, I do at least
feel good that if she ends up with a Dom, she will be of great value to
him and bring a strong will to his.

I can't see how that would happen if she'd been raised to believe that
females should be submissive just because they are female.  In fact, as
I've mentioned to "Kooky" (to not name names), I'm certainly not
submissive in other areas of my life outside of a consensual
relationship.  And I don't see how any Dom would really want to be
served by someone who couldn't stand on their own 2 feet, although I
admit that many submissives may do better and be stronger when they are
with a Dom in a good relationship (but then again, I believe a Dom is
better off that way too ... as I believe in the value of the strength
provided in a good union, D/s or vanilla.)

OK, &lt;/soapbox&gt;.

I have not observed you to be a significant contributor to the problem.

And on those freakish occasions that the troll posts something valuable,
it is a good thing to see it responded to by a mostly sane person so
that:
1.  The good content is rewarded and the Troll might learn something.
2.  The rest of us benefit from it.

It is the people who reply to her *a* *lot*, almost by preference to
the posts that are the most bat-shit crazy, that this discussion is about.

As I have been forced to learn as a parent, to a needy person there is no
difference between negative and positive attention.  So to achieve desired
behaviour modification, you should only provide attention that encourages
the desired outcomes.

That's where I've been for some time now.  I'm ready to start kill-filing
people who otherwise amuse me because they keep stimulating the troll.

It's to the point that I can't even snip out subthreads becasue they get
contaminated by the troll (which I can easily deal with) and then extended
by others (which is harder).  Once polluted by others the sub-thread has
to be found and re-isolated amongst all the noisy crap again.

If anyone cares to start circulating a PISS-blacklist for implementing
kill-filters on this subject, I would be grateful and will contribute to
it's maintenance.

Oooh...  What a wonderful foundation for a topic!

I have a daily contact requirement with my Domme.  I live in a different
city about an hour and a half away and we see each other only 1-3 times a
month, usually during planned weekends.

So most of the time, I am required to email or call her and communicate
something meaningful at least once every day.

The problem is that I don't necessarily *do* anything meaningful worth
talking about every day.  And even when I do, I don't necessarily process
it as meaningful until much later.

This presents a large challenge.

It does keep me from just falling into long periods of apathetic stupor.
I can't just coast and be numb.

In most regards, this is a good thing.

But it *is* work.

Sometimes mindless stupor is *so* attractive.

Philip and I seem hrmmmm the over-communicators.
We talk in the morning for at least a half hour. Once during the day
for at least a half hour, and at 8 in the evening for at least an
hour.
Right now I'm basically splitting my time between two houses half an
hour apart.

Home1 with kids on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Home2 with Philip on Thursday afternoons after work
Home1 Friday night with Philip and my kids
Home2 Saturday after work and Saturday night after  local parties
which we're booked for on three out of four weekends monthly
Home2 Sunday afternoon after work
Home1 Sunday evening

And then there are movies, going out for dinner, local non play kink
oriented events and events with his side of the family.

And I'm the head driver for my household so ...
damn, I think I need a nap now :/
