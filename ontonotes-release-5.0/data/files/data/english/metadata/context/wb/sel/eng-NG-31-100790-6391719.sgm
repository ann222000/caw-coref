You stupid, dimwitted dumbfuck xflop fanbitches. You have spent years
of your worthless, shitfilled existence trying to lie and post Blu-ray
into some psycho-schizo delusion of failure when it is becoming the
exact opposite. Do you seriously believe that because you can make up
lie after lie about Blu-ray that those lies would somehow come true?
The fact is the exact opposite is happening, something you half-wit

'Casino Royale' Blu-ray Breaks 100,000 Unit Milestone
Mar 27, 2007

It's official: Sony has announced that 'Casino Royale'
on Blu-ray is the first high-def disc title to ship
over 100,000 units.

'Royale' has been breaking records ever since its
Blu-ray debut on March 13 -- as we've previously
reported, it was the first high-def disc to crack the
top ten on Amazon's overall DVD best sellers list, and
it easily topped Nielsen VideoScan's Blu-ray chart its
first week out.

And while the 100,000 figure for 'Casino Royale' has
been rumored for several days now, Sony Pictures Home
Entertainment is now comfirming it in a press release,
hitting the wires today.

The strong performance for 'Royale' is certainly a
healthy sign for the nine month old Blu-ray format.
Not only has Blu-ray hit the 100,000 unit mark faster
than rival format HD DVD, it hits the milestone two
months faster than standard-def DVD did back in 1998
(with 'Air Force One'), when DVD was eleven months
old.

SPHE Worldwide President David Bishop praised the news
as a demonstrative of Blu-ray's robust growth in the
marketplace, adding that "Blu-ray has accounted for
approximately 70 percent of the high-definition market
since the first week in January, and as that market
share continues to grow, we are dedicated to providing
consumers with the content they crave."

And while it's too soon to tell whether 'Casino
Royale' will be to Blu-ray what 'The Matrix' was to
standard-def DVD (ie: the format's de facto showcase
disc), one certainly gets the feeling that Sony isn't
dissuading such comparisons. 'Royale' director Martin
Campbell is quoted in the Sony release marveling at
the disc's picture quality: "It's just unbelievable.
Clearly, it's fantastic. The comparison between
standard def DVD and Blu-ray is quite stunning and
quite transparent to the master. It's precisely what
would make me want to buy a copy."

Sony congratulates Micro$hit for trying to bring
"elite" experience to xflop 3-shitty

Both Nintendo and Microsoft struggled to meet demand
with their consoles, leading to stock shortages - but
Sony previously stated that the UK would get around
220,000 of the 1 million PS3 units allocated to Europe
for launch.

Overall, the PlayStation 3 is the second
fastest-selling piece of games hardware in history.
That record still belongs to PlayStation Portable,
with 185,000 units sold during the handheld's launch
weekend.

PlayStation 3 launched in Europe on Friday, priced at
GBP 425 / EUR 599 for the 60GB model.

And it also fits the PS3/gamer demographic, unlike a "chick flick" or art
house film.

Just wait until Spider-Man 3 hits Blu-Ray...that should obliterate the
Casino Royale milestone record.

More PR spin. Sony desperately needs Blu-Ray to be relevant in order
to sell PS3's. From from a business perspective, I think they have
known that from the start. The problem isn't that this information is
false, because easy to validate, it's acurate data. The problem is it
doesn't matter.

What they aren't telling you is the very tough road ahead for Blu-Ray
and HD-DVD and any future format the tries to compete with DVD. Here's
why: consumers need a compelling reason to upgrade. The techno buffs
are going to run out and buy the latest and greatest technology first,
once they are made their investment (which accounts for about 1-5% of
the market, about where both HD-DVD and Blu-Ray are now in the grand
scheme of home movie media). Once you get past those guys it becomes
very difficult to penetrate the mass market.

Joe consumers doesn't care about Blu-Ray or HD-DVD because he has
figured out there is little incentive. He already has his 5.1 surround
sound, he already has menus, extra features and even 16x9 widescreen
picture, which at progressive scan, scaled to 1080i looks pretty damn
good. Joe consumer realizes that the only benefit this technology
offers him is "true" HD and after seeing the in store demo quickly
makes one of two decisions. 1. He doesn't have a HD Television so he
walks away without a second thought or 2. He rationalizes that the
nominal difference his eyes can see in the picture quality aren't
worth the $500 investment and the $10 per movie premium he will pay.
He probably also rationalizes that in addition to the $10 premium,
with Blu-Ray or HD-DVD he would have the added handicap of not being
able to play his movies in the upstairs bed room DVD player, his
notebook computer or his decked out SUV with in-car DVD system.

I think when you really consider all of this, it takes a very ignorant
person to assume Blu-Ray adoption will follow the same path as DVD.

If Blu-Ray has performed better than DVD in the similar time frame, I
would say it's because we have more technology buffs today. We're
still no where near mass market with these technology, Sony knows it,
everyone knows it. They are being careful....

Blig Merk spake thusly:

&lt;snip&gt;

Jesus. You are scaring the shit out of me here Bliggy, assuming this is
really you this time. The PS3's ongoing woes have filled you with so
much pent-up rage, a *movie* selling *100,000 copies* (ie. 1/10th of a
successful game, and a fraction of what it's sold on DVD so far, your
misleading subject line notwithstanding) is causing your bile-filled
head to EXPLODE with righteousness.

I mean, be happy! Sony sold 60% of its PS3 stock on launch day (vs. 100%
of Xbox 360 and Wii sales on their respective launches, but even the
most clueless fanboy understands they were hindered by shortages.) 600K
for a territory is nothing to sneeze at, even if it's likely to drop to
1/3 or less of that next month. Can you relax a bit?

Don't get so worked up. Anyone who knows you knows you've never been
right with any of your so-called predictions. If we don't take you
seriously, why do you take yourself so seriously?

The PS3's sales in North America and (especially) Japan have fallen far
below expectations. The European launch looks great on paper, because
Sony had a ton of time to stockpile consoles in preparation for the
launch, a luxury not afforded to the Xbox 360 or Wii.

If Sony sells another 600K consoles in Europe next month, then the PS3
is off to an amazing start. If they sell 150K, it means Sony was able to
meet early adopter demand in one weekend instead of spreading it over
several months due to supply shortages, as with the 360 and Wii. Which
is still a good thing -- the quicker you sell to the hardcore crowd, the
quicker you sell games and make money -- but it's no indication that the
PS3 is a runaway success.

I'm listening to all of you guys and gals about BR and HDDVD and I'm not
sure what the debate really is. I'm not loyal to any format, but I will tell
you guys, I'm not buying any new format DVD unless it costs the same as a
regular DVD. I'm too cheap!

Marketing and consumerism is a funny art. I have no doubt that Casino Royale
will sell big, but you gotta realize that when a consumer is starved for a
product, almost any new movie will do well. When I'm in BestBuy, I often
hear people bitching about how small the new format sections are. Especially
those who spent $1000 for a stand-alone BR player.

To me, whoever wins the price wars, i.e cheapest, wins my money. In terms of
XBox and PS3, I have no problems with owning both.

Thanks

&gt; &gt; 'Casino Royale' Blu-ray Breaks 100,000 Unit Milestone
&gt; &gt; Mar 27, 2007

&gt; &gt; It's official: Sony has announced that 'Casino Royale'
&gt; &gt; on Blu-ray is the first high-def disc title to ship
&gt; &gt; over 100,000 units.

&gt; &gt; 'Royale' has been breaking records ever since its
&gt; &gt; Blu-ray debut on March 13 -- as we've previously
&gt; &gt; reported, it was the first high-def disc to crack the
&gt; &gt; top ten on Amazon's overall DVD best sellers list, and
&gt; &gt; it easily topped Nielsen VideoScan's Blu-ray chart its
&gt; &gt; first week out.

&gt; &gt; And while the 100,000 figure for 'Casino Royale' has
&gt; &gt; been rumored for several days now, Sony Pictures Home
&gt; &gt; Entertainment is now comfirming it in a press release,
&gt; &gt; hitting the wires today.

&gt; &gt; The strong performance for 'Royale' is certainly a
&gt; &gt; healthy sign for the nine month old Blu-ray format.
&gt; &gt; Not only has Blu-ray hit the 100,000 unit mark faster
&gt; &gt; than rival format HD DVD, it hits the milestone two
&gt; &gt; months faster than standard-def DVD did back in 1998
&gt; &gt; (with 'Air Force One'), when DVD was eleven months
&gt; &gt; old.

&gt; &gt; SPHE Worldwide President David Bishop praised the news
&gt; &gt; as a demonstrative of Blu-ray's robust growth in the
&gt; &gt; marketplace, adding that &quot;Blu-ray has accounted for
&gt; &gt; approximately 70 percent of the high-definition market
&gt; &gt; since the first week in January, and as that market
&gt; &gt; share continues to grow, we are dedicated to providing
&gt; &gt; consumers with the content they crave.&quot;

&gt; &gt; And while it's too soon to tell whether 'Casino
&gt; &gt; Royale' will be to Blu-ray what 'The Matrix' was to
&gt; &gt; standard-def DVD (ie: the format's de facto showcase
&gt; &gt; disc), one certainly gets the feeling that Sony isn't
&gt; &gt; dissuading such comparisons. 'Royale' director Martin
&gt; &gt; Campbell is quoted in the Sony release marveling at
&gt; &gt; the disc's picture quality: &quot;It's just unbelievable.
&gt; &gt; Clearly, it's fantastic. The comparison between
&gt; &gt; standard def DVD and Blu-ray is quite stunning and
&gt; &gt; quite transparent to the master. It's precisely what
&gt; &gt; would make me want to buy a copy.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Sony congratulates Micro$hit for trying to bring
&gt; &gt; &quot;elite&quot; experience to xflop 3-shitty

&gt; &gt; Both Nintendo and Microsoft struggled to meet demand
&gt; &gt; with their consoles, leading to stock shortages - but
&gt; &gt; Sony previously stated that the UK would get around
&gt; &gt; 220,000 of the 1 million PS3 units allocated to Europe
&gt; &gt; for launch.

&gt; &gt; Overall, the PlayStation 3 is the second
&gt; &gt; fastest-selling piece of games hardware in history.
&gt; &gt; That record still belongs to PlayStation Portable,
&gt; &gt; with 185,000 units sold during the handheld's launch
&gt; &gt; weekend.

&gt; &gt; PlayStation 3 launched in Europe on Friday, priced at
&gt; &gt; GBP 425 / EUR 599 for the 60GB model.

&gt; I'm listening to all of you guys and gals about BR and HDDVD and I'm not
&gt; sure what the debate really is. I'm not loyal to any format, but I will tell
&gt; you guys, I'm not buying any new format DVD unless it costs the same as a
&gt; regular DVD. I'm too cheap!

&gt; Marketing and consumerism is a funny art. I have no doubt that Casino Royale
&gt; will sell big, but you gotta realize that when a consumer is starved for a
&gt; product, almost any new movie will do well. When I'm in BestBuy, I often
&gt; hear people bitching about how small the new format sections are. Especially
&gt; those who spent $1000 for a stand-alone BR player.

&gt; To me, whoever wins the price wars, i.e cheapest, wins my money. In terms of
&gt; XBox and PS3, I have no problems with owning both.

&gt; Thanks

Amen.

It's actually kind of sad that so very few worthwhile movies have hit
the next-generation discs. Obviously, you want movies that will
showcase the visual upgrade, but there are way too many Talladega

What's even funnier is when PS3 fanboys so desperately want their
system to be a success that they'll refute facts and common logic,
even when they have absolutely no argument.

What RMZ said is absolutely true and is exactly what any analyst with
a brain and, more importantly, the average consumer would tell you.

HD media is still in its infancy. It's not going mass market anytime
soon. It will definitely do better once the players are at a price
point that's more affordable for the average consumer, but it's not
going to replace DVD or even make a true dent in DVD sales.

Many consumers have spent the last 7 or 8 years building their
collections of DVDs. What real justification would the average person
have to purchase a bonus-less HD-DVD or Blu-Ray Disc of a movie they
likely already own for an additional $10 more on top of the price they
purchased the DVD at?

The average consumer doesn't own an HDTV. Why would they purchase a
next-gen movie player?

The average consumer doesn't see a huge difference in visual
quality... or at least enough of a difference to justify a total
reinvestment in their entertainment.

VHS to DVD: You no longer have to worry about picture degradation with
each viewing. You now have advanced surround sound. The visual quality
is MUCH better. You don't have to fast forward anymore. You can zoom
in (did anyone ever actually use this?). You have extra features.

DVD to next-gen: The visual quality is somewhat better.

Ask a random 50 people who are NOT technophiles whether they'd be
willing to spend $500 on a player and $25-30 per disc to join the "new
generation."

Probably not too high...I have two games, but I think I may be in
minority. I'm won't dispute the fact that the 360 came out as strictly
a gaming rig (HD-DVD drive came out a year later), while the PS3 came
out as game console/Blu-Ray player. Basically there are a lot of PS3s
bumping around out there not being used for much of anything at this
moment. But there should be a flood of games coming in the summer :)

What pressure would that be?

The 360 continues to outsell the PS3 month to month.

Meanwhile, the PS3 sees developers announcing previous PS exclusives will
be going multi-platform, or will be exclusive for the 360.  While no
single game is going to  convince someone to spend $400-600 on game
hardware, it certainly isn't going to help things when youre exclusive
library is shrinking.

MGS4 still hasn't been announced as an exclusive.

FF13 is even rumored to still be in negotiations - which isn't a good sign.

So, again, how are 360 owners worried?

Who's spinning/making excuses for the 360?  Why would they need to?

And no one is denying that the PS3 won't have a good game here and there
or that it won't sell some consoles.  What IS up for debate is whether the
market (and more importantly, the developers) are willing to wait for the
PS3's good titles to come out - which really won't be until this time NEXT
YEAR at the earliest.  Sure there'll be a few good games this year, but
will it be enough to keep other developers from pulling their exclusive
title away from the PS3 to go multi-platform?

After all, why buy a console if all of its good games are available on
another platformat that's cheaper, and the games look/play the same.  That
was part of the problem the Xbox had against the PS2.

More importantly, there was only ONE DVD format.  You didn't have to worry

That's after they spend $1000+ on a new HDTV...

It's going to be the better part of a decade before the mass market is
really ready to start switching over.  DVD will still be available, just
as VHS was still being sold up until just recentally.

The HD video playback capabilities of the PS3 and 360 are really little
more than just gimmicks.  The difference being that Microsoft isn't
dependent on this gimmick to sell consoles whereas Sony IS.

Well, if you look carefully, it's only the fanboys that are trumpetting
how important Blu-Ray or HD-DVD is to their particular cause...

Your points echo what the rest of us have always been saying - this isn't
about HD video, it's about the games.  The vast majority of the market isn't
going to be interested in buying a PS3 just to use as a blu-ray player -
and they aren't interested in HD-DVD either.  If they are interested in a
PS3 (or 360) it'll be because of the games, not the movies.

These new formats are still young, and as you point out, there aren't a
whole lot of movies available for them yet, either.

All of which will get worked out over time, as more movies come out,
players get cheaper, and whatnot.

As for the PS3 and 360, so long as there are games to play, I'll buy
both.  Right now, the 360 looks to be the better buy, just based on  its
current library.  When the big exclusives drop for the PS3, I'll get one
as well.  However, right now, I'm rather worried about what exclusives
will be left on the PS3 at this rate...  Developers need market share to
sell games, and just about no one will release a game on a console with
inadequate market share...

Considering the current game library for the PS3, what would you expect
him to trumpet?

Seriously, the PS3's strongest advantage IS that it's a "cheap" Blu-Ray
player ($600 vs. $1000)  But with announcements from Toshiba about their
new $600 Blu-Ray player, that won't be the case for very long.  And if LG
fixes their multi-format player, the PS3's blu-ray movie capability will
become totally moot.  After all, why buy a player that can't handle both
formats at that point?

In the meantime, what else does the PS3 have going for it?  Some of its
biggest exclusive titles are in question right now, and others have
already made the jump to multi-platform releases, or even switching sides
entirely to become an exclusive title for the 360.  Each exclusive PS3
title that goes multi-platform chips away at the PS3's future.

be taken with a grain of salt.

Even then, if MGS just shows up 6 months later, I'm not really sure how
much of an impact it's going to have on PS3 sales.

&gt; More importantly, there was only ONE DVD format.  You didn't have to worry

&gt; years later would still play on it, and any movies you bought early on
&gt; would still play on newer players down the road.

&gt; The same can't be said about HD-DVD/Blu-Ray.

Actually there are 2 DVD formats: DVD+R and DVD-R...most players
(except Toshiba, who push the DVD-R format) play both transparently,
which hopefully will happen with BluRay/HD-DVD...

It's also worth pointing out that the headline here is (from the Sony
press release) "Los Angeles (CA) - Sony has announced that over
100,000 Blu-ray Discs (BDs) of Casino Royale have shipped, making it
the first high definition movie release to reach the six-digit
milestone."

An import tid-bit missing is that Casino Royale is produced by Sony
Pictures, it's easy to meet a "milestone" like this when you're the
very manufacturer that can make it happen. I'm not saying the movie
isn't successful, it did briefly break into the amazon.com top DVD
list, just pointing out this is another example of Sony's PR
department taking full advantage

&gt; &gt; Interesting...not quite the 'disaster' some posters have been yapping
&gt; &gt; about...

&gt; The PS3's sales in North America and (especially) Japan have fallen far
&gt; below expectations. The European launch looks great on paper, because
&gt; Sony had a ton of time to stockpile consoles in preparation for the
&gt; launch, a luxury not afforded to the Xbox 360 or Wii.

&gt; If Sony sells another 600K consoles in Europe next month, then the PS3
&gt; is off to an amazing start. If they sell 150K, it means Sony was able to
&gt; meet early adopter demand in one weekend instead of spreading it over
&gt; several months due to supply shortages, as with the 360 and Wii. Which
&gt; is still a good thing -- the quicker you sell to the hardcore crowd, the
&gt; quicker you sell games and make money -- but it's no indication that the
&gt; PS3 is a runaway success.

&gt;It's actually kind of sad that so very few worthwhile movies have hit
&gt;the next-generation discs. Obviously, you want movies that will
&gt;showcase the visual upgrade, but there are way too many Talladega
&gt;Nights and The Break-up type movies out there.

well I'm sure glad I have the hd-dvd add-on as I've watched Batman Returns 3
or 4 times now, was also impressed with the Swordfish transfer (and of
course King Kong was stunning), but the sad truth is that the hd-dvd camp
has all but conceded the fight to Blu-Ray by not having an aggressive
release schedule of hd worthy titles...

Casino Royale, BlackHawk Down, Terminator I and II, X-Men, Underworld:
Evolution, Volver (which I mention only because I totally want to bone
Penelope Cruz), Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Kung Fu Hustle, Curse of the
Golden Flower, Rambo, Aliens vs Predator, Open Season, Transporter I and II,
etc, etc, etc, I'm getting tired of typing...two way street indeed...
