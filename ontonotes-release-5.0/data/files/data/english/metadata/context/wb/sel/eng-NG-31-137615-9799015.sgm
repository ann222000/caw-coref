Fellow Citizens of India,

It is indeed a great privilige and honour to receive this award
instituted in the memory of Shri Nani Palkhiwala. He towered above
most of us by his intellectual prowess, and insistence on adhering
to values and the truth at all times. The hallmark of this man was
that he followed his conscience with an outstandingly honest
commitment to logic and facts. I feel humble in receiving this award
instituted in his memory. It is also a privilige to have been
selected by an Institution and a jury of great repute. I am
conscious that this award is really more a recognition for the
revolution of Right to Information, -than for me. RTI has swept
across the Nation gaining strength by Citizen participation and
activism.

The first campaign for Right to Information was started in 1990 in
rural Rajasthan by MKSS,- led by Aruna Roy, Nikhil Dey and Shankar
Singh. Across the country many people have been championing the
cause of transparency and for codification of this fundamental right
of Citizens. To name a few;- H.D. Shourie, Ajit Bhatacharjee,
Prabhash Joshi, Jean Dreze, Maja Daruwala, Prashant Bhushan, Arvind
Kejriwal, Prakash Kardaley and Shekhar Singh were amongst the many
who have over the years agitated and lobbied for a good Right To
Information Act. In Maharashtra we owe a great debt to Shri Anna
Hazare not only for getting a good State Act, but also for spreading
it as a Public movement, and continuously ensuring that the
Government takes steps to improve its implementation.

Lokmanya Tilak's epic call still rings in our years -- &quot; Swaraj ha
maza janmasiddh hakk ahe, ani to me milawnarch&quot;. We have a
reasonable system of elections. Citizens are able to change their
elected representatives, but the Swaraj we dreamt of, never came.

What we have is an elective democracy, not a participatory
democracy. This is because we have missed the essence of Lokshahi-
which means Logonki Shahenshahi. The essence of democracy is that
the individual Citizen is a sovereign in her own right, and she
gives up part of the sovereignty to the State, in return for which
she gets the rule of law. This respect for YOU,-the sovereign
Citizen of India, and for the rule of law has been missed
completely. Our Institutions have become playgrounds of the
powerful, where the individual is helpless. If a Citizen approaches
an elected representative, he may or may not get a hearing in 24
hours; if she writes to a Public servant she may or may not get an
answer in 12 days; and if she approaches the Courts a BMW will
metamorphose into a truck and the final decision will probably be
obtained after a decade. The individual Citizen instead of being
respected has become the bechara. If Tilak were here today he would
have again said, &quot; Swaraj ha maza janmasiddh hakk ahe, ani to me
milawnarch&quot;, karan Swaraj keva aalach nahi. 15th August, 1947 only
saw a transfer of Raj from the whites to the browns.

While we see a soaring sensex, a double digit growth of GDP and
malls, and a growing number of billionaires, over 70% of my
countrymen live on less than Rs.20 per day, and more than 45% of our
children suffer from malnutrition. These Citizens of India bow with
servility before the Public servant, prostrate themselves before
their arrogant elected representatives and do not even dare to
approach the judiciary. Investigations of criminal complaints in
Slum Rehabilitation Authority matters have been stalled and the
Criminal Procedure Code suspended by the Maharashtra Government,
despite High Court orders. The Court waits for Godot, while the
underworld has now taken over these matters. If the Common Citizen
challenges the powerful criminals in Court, he might end up
sacrificing decades of his lifetime for this folly. Six decades
after Independence, India is seeing a reincarnation of the Princes
and Zamindars in their new Avtars;- as monopolists and SEZ owners
who actually dictate policy and implementation. The State provides
the lathaits and the armies for these. The Government itself admits
that around 25% of India's districts have chronic and endemic
violence. Dr. Binayak Sen, has been locked up without any crime and
with the knowledge of the highest court in the land.

Many others suffer across the Nation and they do not even weigh on
our conscience -- since they are invisibles -- the `Le Miserables'
who will perhaps someday have to threaten our growth, progress and
peace with violence to get their just dues.

In 1982 Mr. Palkhiwala had described the plight of the Citizen in
this verse:

&quot; His speech is of mortgaged bedding,

On his vine he borrows yet,

At his heart is his daughter's wedding,

In his eye foreknowledge of debt.

He eats and hath indigestion,

He toils and he may not stop;

His Life is a long-drawn question

Between a crop and a crop.&quot;

After a quarter century, i feel it could have been written
yesterday.

Most institutions have failed India since they have become the
domains of the powerful. Brazenly they have appropriated what
belongs to the people, - lands, money and power. In this grim
scenario there are two possibilities; - either a movement towards
violent solutions by the disempowered, or a campaign for greater
accountability and empowerment by Individual Citizens to monitor the
Government and implement the laws. The contract is between each
individual sovereign with the State. Right To Information provides
an avenue for the Common Citizen to question his Government, get
accountability, find out about policy implementation, expose
corruption and get respect for the majesty of the Indian Citizen.
The elegant law provides an inexpensive, timebound and simple
instrument to Citizens, which can be used by them from their own
house with an input of less than an hour and around 50 rupees.

Individual citizens have used RTI to curb corruption in the issue of
ration cards, Incometax refunds, pensions and so on. A RTI
application made the Government install jammers to stop the use of
mobile phones by its inmates in Arthur road prison, while another
forced a rapist cop to be dismissed. RTI reveals that 550 lessees in
Mumbai illegally occupy 1200 acres of lands as illegal occupiers,
though their leases have expired. This is done with the connivance
of the Government. We the People lose over 8000 crores annually in
Mumbai alone on this count. Privatisation of water supply was
stopped in Delhi. A RTI query to JJ School of Arts made them realize
the priceless paintings they were holding! Thus there are many
varying and different ways in which Citizens are using RTI to
monitor government performance, support the honest Public servants,
curb corruption and get proof of laws being broken. Most importantly
the individual Citizen-the Sovereign of India,- is feeling empowered
and is beginning to impact on the Governance of the Country. He is
seeing the possibility of getting the Swaraj which escaped her 60
years back. RTI is growing without any one organization or National
leadership guiding or dictating it,- in short without any hierarchy.
This is truly a Citizen empowerment revolution which is sweeping
across the Country, awakening the common Citizen.

As I stand here, I would like to acknowledge my deep gratitude to
the many well wishers, friends and my family who have given me
immense love and warmth. My special thanks to my parents,-who are no
more,- my daughter and son-in-law Ayesha and Omesh, and my wife
Bharti who have supported me consistently in pursuing my
convictions.

All of us individually share this historic opportunity to be the
agent for the change we desire. Right to Information is helping to
uncover the facts, the reality which exists in our Public
Authorities. It is indeed a search and quest for transparency and
truth. Sixty years back Satya helped us to rid the Country of our
white masters, now RTI will help us to attain the Swaraj we missed.
It is critical that we the People defend and nurture this Right for
the next few years. The authority and the responsibility vest with
you and me,-the Sovereign Citizens of India. I accept this award on
behalf of the Common Citizen of this Nation, who is now empowered
with his Right to Information to change the Governance of the
Country.
