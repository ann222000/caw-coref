I got some truly good news today from my surgeon... the MRI I had last
week does *not* show my rotator cuff to be retorn... it appears fully
intact.

There is some bad news, which is that my arm has a lot of pain, which
it shouldn't have. But that's what my upcoming physical therapy will
hopefully address, along with stronger pain meds from the doctor.  Had
the cuff been retorn, it would have been curtains for me.  If I have
continuing pain, there ought to be various options open to me.

You have no idea how totally relieved I am.  And shocked.

I don't believe in the power of prayer, but maybe I should rethink
this.

Who's been doing the praying? Can't be you, 'cos you don't believe in it.

Congratulations, and fingers crossed, regardless.

S'okay.  The biggest problem was that the ripped off tendon wasn't
diagnosed for two months.  I had to talk them into rechecking it
(I'd been doing physical therapy since the injury) and then they
went &quot;Oh, yeah -- it *doesn't* look like your other arm.&quot;  So by
then there was already scarring and atrophy, and once the doc got
in there he saw that if he reattached it at the correct point I
wouldn't be able to straighten my arm completely.  He opted to
attach it closer to the elbow so I'd have full mobility -- at the
expense of a bit of strength, because of the leverage difference.
I don't really notice that effect but I'm glad he made that
decision so my arm doesn't get part way extended and come to the
end of of its movement.

Wimp. I'm very glad for you, though.

If suspect you might have people praying for you, ask them not to tell
you about it. It might actually hurt your recovery.

http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025463.200.html

Prayers found ineffective in speeding recovery

Praying for someone might give you hope, but it won't help them recover
from heart surgery. It may even harm them. That's the surprising result
from a multi-year clinical trial on the therapeutic effects of prayer.

Herbert Benson and Jeffery Dusek of the Mind/Body Medical Institute at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and
their colleagues followed the fates of 1802 patients undergoing coronary
bypass operations. Several Christian prayer groups prayed for one set of
patients, while another did not receive any prayers. Although all these
patients knew they were in the trial, neither they nor their doctors knew
which of the groups they were in.

The prayers made no detectable difference. In the first month after
surgery, 52 per cent of prayed-for patients and 51 per cent of non-
prayed-for patients suffered one or more complications, the researchers
found (American Heart Journal, vol 151, p 934).

A third group of patients received the same prayers as the first group,
but were told they were being prayed for. Of these, 59 per cent suffered
complications - significantly more than the patients left unsure of
whether they were receiving prayers.

The researchers have no explanation for this result, but Mitchell Krukoff
at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, suggests
that the burden of knowing they were being prayed for may have put added
stress on these patients after their surgery.

Referred pain, perhaps. When I had a screwed up shoulder about 10 years
ago the pain showed up in several places that were not the source of the
problem. Physio gradually pushed the pain closer to the source -- the
bursa -- until it finally landed where it originated. Lots of mobility
exercises followed, and when it went away, it went very suddenly, almost
overnight.

I'm not suggesting that's a parallel to your situation, but pain doesn't
seem to follow rules very well.

Why, did you pray for this diagnosis?

I'd guess that prayer with physio is more effective than prayer alone,
but what do I know?

feet be swift; may our bats be mighty; may our balls... be
plentiful.  Lord, I'd just like to thank You for that waitress in
South Bend.  You know who she is -- she kept calling Your name.
And God, these are good girls, and they work hard.  Just help
them see it all the way through.  Okay, that's it.

Which of course in turn reminds me of:

Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) [abridged]:  I believe in the Church
of Baseball.  I've tried all the major religions, and most of
the minor ones.  I've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu,
Siva, trees, mushrooms, and Isadora Duncan.  I know things.
For instance, there are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary and there
are 108 stitches in a baseball.  When I heard that, I gave
Jesus a chance.  But it just didn't work out between us. ...
I've tried 'em all, I really have, and the only church that
truly feeds the soul, day in, day out, is the Church of Baseball.

The Christians and the Jews were having a jamboree
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
And they began to speak
They said &quot;Lord the plague is on the world
Lord no man is free
The temples that we built to you
Have tumbled into the sea
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Won't you please please let us be?&quot;

And the Lord said
And the Lord said

&quot;I burn down your cities--how blind you must be
I take from you your children and you say how blessed are we
You must all be crazy to put your faith in me
That's why i love mankind
You really need me
That's why i love mankind&quot;

I had it for roughly a year before it disappeared, following a lot of
physiotherapy. It wasn't only pain, but limited range of motion. For a
year or more, I couldn't have a good stretch with my arms in the air,
and it's amazing how much you miss that.

It's a condition sometimes called frozen shoulder, which a lot of people
get around the age of 50. It has a reputation for clearing up quickly --
after hanging around for a long time.

&quot;Overnight&quot; is a bit of an exaggeration. It went away over several
weeks, after roughly a year of only the tiniest increments.

When the doc opened up my arm on the operating table this time, he
didn't think he could fix it.  But he managed to reattach all the torn
tendons... he said essentially the entire rotator cuff had torn loose
from the bones this time.

He was greatly relieved that the MRI was negative this time... he said
he was thinking that he really didn't have any good suggestions if it
was.

My only straw that I was grasping was that there is a new and
experimental procedure, involving transplanting tendon material from
cadavers, requiring anti rejection drugs and all of that.  And it's
experimental without much of a track record to know if it even works.
But that really was grasping at straws, and I might well have not even
been a candidate to try it.

My big concern was the notion that I would spend the rest of my life
(hopefully a short time) with untreatable pain, even when sitting
passively.  On the internet, unfortunately, there are many stories of
people with agonizing pain when they have inoperable rotator cuff
tears.

I tried to convince myself that something better would come... but
never convinced myself that the rotator cuff wasn't in fact torn,
which is the case thank God.

&gt; Wimp. I'm very glad for you, though.

&gt; If suspect you might have people praying for you, ask them not to
&gt; tell you about it. It might actually hurt your recovery.

&gt; http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025463.200.html

&gt; Prayers found ineffective in speeding recovery

&gt; Praying for someone might give you hope, but it won't help them
&gt; recover from heart surgery. It may even harm them. That's the
&gt; surprising result from a multi-year clinical trial on the
&gt; therapeutic effects of prayer.

&gt; Herbert Benson and Jeffery Dusek of the Mind/Body Medical
&gt; Institute at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Chestnut
&gt; Hill, Massachusetts, and their colleagues followed the fates of
&gt; 1802 patients undergoing coronary bypass operations. Several
&gt; Christian prayer groups prayed for one set of patients, while
&gt; another did not receive any prayers. Although all these patients
&gt; knew they were in the trial, neither they nor their doctors knew
&gt; which of the groups they were in.

&gt; The prayers made no detectable difference. In the first month
&gt; after surgery, 52 per cent of prayed-for patients and 51 per cent
&gt; of non- prayed-for patients suffered one or more complications,
&gt; the researchers found (American Heart Journal, vol 151, p 934).

&gt; A third group of patients received the same prayers as the first
&gt; group, but were told they were being prayed for. Of these, 59 per
&gt; cent suffered complications - significantly more than the patients
&gt; left unsure of whether they were receiving prayers.

&gt; The researchers have no explanation for this result, but Mitchell
&gt; Krukoff at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North
&gt; Carolina, suggests that the burden of knowing they were being
&gt; prayed for may have put added stress on these patients after their
&gt; surgery.
">

We really need to know what those being prayed for thought about the
whole thing. Were they hopeful it would speed their recovery? Or were
they skeptical, perhaps even antagonistic to the idea? Did they share
the faith of the person praying for them or did they thing the
praying person's faith was bogus? Who exactly did the praying? Did
the test control for different religions, different sects, and
different levels of spirituality as assessed by both experts within
the religion and independent observers outside it? Did the
researchers give a second thought to producing data points that would
allow them to interpret the results after they had been collected? Or
were they just hoping to prove that, see, prayer makes no difference
or maybe, gee whiz, lookie there it did. Either way, it serves them
right they got the result they did. Why, if I were running the
universe, that's EXACTLY what ... hmmmm.

That's the one.  Mom tried to raise us more-or-less Protestant.  I can

Good night, how tacky. I would force any church I pastored to stop
asking such a question.

This doesn't divide along Protestant vs. Catholic lines but along
liturgical vs. non-liturgical. Churches with a written out English
liturgy--Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran--have tended to use &quot;forgive us
our trespasses.&quot; Those without such liturgy have used &quot;forgive us our
debts.&quot;

The King James Bible translates the phrase as &quot;forgive us our debts as
we forgive our debtors.&quot; So if your church hasn't got a liturgy, you
tend to simply use what's in your Bible for those rare moments when
everyone says something together. It may even become a point of pride
that you aren't using some fancy pants statement gussied up by men but
the plain, unadorned (though translated) text. Worshipers with that
attitude can sometimes lump all liturgical traditions together as
implicitly Roman Catholic if not explicitly so.

As far as it goes, &quot;forgive us our debts&quot; is the more accurate
translation. But those who make it a point of pride don't usually know
that. (They may assume it.) But the traditional form of the Lord's
Prayer is taken from Matthew's Gospel.

In Luke's version, Jesus says, &quot;Forgive us our SINS, for we also
forgive those indebted to us.&quot; This makes it a little clearer that
Jesus is using the language of debt to talk about sin. And most people
who advocate for &quot;forgive us our debts&quot; would agree that this is what's
going on. They don't think the Lord's Prayer is talking about not
holding people accountable for loans.

Recent liturgical versions of the prayer eliminate the metaphor and
simply say &quot;forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against
us.&quot; And for the most part, that's probably how Jesus' disciples heard
him when he spoke the original in Aramaic. If I recall, Aramaic has a
single word that can mean both debt and sin.

Nevertheless, it may be helpful to retain the metaphor as both Matthew
and Luke do when they write their Gospels, translating that Aramaic
prayer into Greek.

But the issue is quite minor to me and not one to be tussled over. I'll
say or lead a congregation in saying any translation that's printed up.

For the tune you know anyway. I bet I know which one that is, but I'm
not sure. Back in 1981, KFAC, a commercial classical Radio station in
Los Angeles, used to play a choir singing the Lord's Prayer every
weekday morning at 6 a.m. My clock radio would sound right in the
middle of it, letting me know it was time to get up and go to school.

That tune still makes me tired when I hear it.

I assume &quot;Daughter&quot; is you and not your own daughter. That's good.
Never pray anything you don't believe or don't mean.
