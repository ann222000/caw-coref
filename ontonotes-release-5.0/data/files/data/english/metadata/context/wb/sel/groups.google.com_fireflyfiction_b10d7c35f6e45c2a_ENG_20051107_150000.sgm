Part 3
See part 0 for header information.

The street was dark when they spilled back out onto it some time later, the gas
planet fallen out of sight beyond the horizon and the sky bereft in its lack.
All of the shops had closed and most of the eating houses were closing. Even
the discordant jangle of the music from the club had a hushed, guilty air.

&quot;We should get back,&quot; Hoyle said, as a half-dozen young men in Alliance
uniform, clearly on downtime, brushed past them heading into the club. He
followed her eyes, trailing in their wake. &quot;There's a garrison here. They're as
bored as everyone else.&quot;

&quot;Everyone except you.&quot; Inara smiled. &quot;You're actually happy here, aren't you?
You have your research, and the quiet... and that is what you wanted, isn't
it?&quot;

&quot;Happiness is never absolute,&quot; he said, and offered his arm. &quot;Don't worry. I
won't ask you to stay with me again.&quot;

Later, she lay beside him in the big bed that hadn't housed more than one
during his tenure, listening to his breathing and feeling the rise and fall of
his chest in the faint stir of the sheets against both of their skin. And she
tried to connect where she'd been three years ago to who she was now. Hauling
Mal out of detention on some border planet... holding her breath with the rest
while reavers passed near enough almost to touch... holding a gun upon a girl
who was a liar and a thief. The dislocation of it weighted her.

And this... was this payment, or indulgence, and shouldn't it matter that she
couldn't and hadn't made that distinction? All she knew was that it had been
inevitable, without discussion or thought, that she would be staying here with
Hoyle while she was on Riarden.

A companion had of necessity to draw strict lines and abide by them. No good
could ever come from letting them start to blur.

She hoped that Simon was taking good care of Mal.

***

&quot;No, not like... no! I can't work with these constant hassles and
interruptions. Get out! I'll do it myself - no, leave that. Out!&quot; Simon flapped
his hands at the two assistants until they scuttled from the lab, then checked
the door was securely closed after them and the sounds of their feet faded
satisfactorily down the corridor. He leaned his aching head against the door,
shut his eyes and muffled a groan.

&quot;Nice job,&quot; Mal commented. &quot;Anyone'd think you really were a tight-assed fancy
core doctor with a mighty big bee in your bonnet. Think you chased 'em off for
good?&quot;

&quot;I hope so.&quot; Simon turned around with a sigh, leaning his back upon the door
instead so he could face the captain. &quot;Though the truth is, I could use the
help. It's been a long time since I used any of this... very specialised
equipment. But it's too big a risk.&quot;

&quot;I don't know why grandpa set you the help on you. Sure Inara must've told him
this is work needs doing secret-like.&quot; Suspicion in Mal's voice, alongside the
usual trace of rebellion and the hostility engendered by whatever was going on
between the captain and Inara these days.

&quot;It's nothing to worry about,&quot; Simon said quickly. &quot;Professor Sherwin told me -
it would look suspicious if he didn't loan out his own staff with the
facilities. He's protecting our alias. He said to chase them off if things were
too sensitive. Apparently independent researchers can be moody and difficult
types.&quot; Along with other independent types, Simon thought, watching Mal
carefully manoeuvre the chair around so he could reach another array of
cold-stored vials that he proceeded to poke through. &quot;Please don't play with
things. Those need to be maintained at very specific temperatures, and I'll
never find my way around this lab if you switch everything out of its proper
order.&quot;

&quot;I'm not - &quot; Mal held up both empty palms, giving in. &quot;Just wonderin' if any of
this gear is worth anything, is all. Got us a pretty packet out of the business
on Ariel, for all we didn't get to keep it long.&quot;

&quot;We're not stealing anything here!&quot; Simon lowered his voice to a hiss, shocked
by the suggestion, hurrying over. &quot;This facility has done some very crucial
work, on exceedingly tight funding as it is. And before you think of pocketing
*anything*, those are just synthesised tissue and they are useless if
contaminated or interfered with.&quot; He carefully set the unit far enough back on
its counter to be out of Mal's reach in the chair, and only afterward realised
how very patronising a gesture that had been in current circumstances. He
stuttered, trying to recover his ground. &quot;I'm not about to make a career of
helping you steal from Alliance medical facilities.&quot;

&quot;And I wasn't about to ask you to, doctor. Too much risk involved, for one. You
keep doing the same crime the same way, and they *will* catch you for it sooner
or later, specially if the fellow providing your specialised know-how is a
tagged fugitive.&quot; Mal frowned at the out-of-reach vials. &quot;Man can't help
wondering, is all.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry. I don't... fare very well with all this secrecy and subterfuge. You
know that.&quot;

&quot;Plenty of stress to go 'round, doctor.&quot; Mal toyed with the wheels of the
chair, executing a cautious spin. He was only saved by Simon impatiently
slamming the back of the chair down as it began to tip over, but apparently the
near-spill left him unfazed. &quot;Say, these things are kind of fun.&quot; He scooted
about the lab, after the last few days enjoying even this limited mobility.
Simon, with one eye on Mal, resumed the checking of the equipment that the two
lab assistants had been engaged in before he'd sent them away. &quot;What do you
reckon to Inara's friend, doc?&quot;

&quot;I think he's taking a very great risk to help us out.&quot; It was with some relief
that he found everything intact and familiar and concluded that he had
everything necessary to successfully repair the captain, provided there were no
abnormalities beyond what he had already noted that would rule the procedure
non-viable or indicate further damage. That left only the immediate concern of
scanning Mal using the more effective equipment the research centre had on
hand.

&quot;There are some investigations I'd like to complete before we both find some
sleep.&quot; It was getting late, both in terms of ship time and the current time on
Riarden. He stalled Mal's protest. &quot;I need more information than a hand-scanner
report if I'm going to do this right. We'll need to head back down the corridor
that way - &quot; Simon pointed vaguely, trying to remember what Professor Sherwin
had said as he'd shown them around. Simon had the distinct impression the man
was more distracted by Inara, indeed even as the captain was, than engaged with
the dangerous subterfuge they were all a part of.

Ironically enough, it was a scanning device similar to the one he'd once paid
Captain Reynolds to help him access in order to treat River that they now
required.

&quot;Oh, hey,&quot; Mal said distractedly. &quot;Here's that file the prof handed you. Didn't
he say something as he was going 'bout not leaving it lying around?&quot; He picked
it up and made to wheel the chair toward Simon - faltered, dumped it in his
lap, and used both hands to wheel himself over.

Simon took the file with a nod, idly flicked through it with his thumb, and
froze. &quot;This - &quot; He opened it up wide; studied closer the chart it had fallen
open on, and swallowed hard.

&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Mal asked sharply.

&quot;This information... I'm looking at a very detailed study of... a particular
pattern of cell breakdown... it's... it's what we need. I mean, everything so
far has been guesswork... we don't know what this weapon is... what it does...
but this file... With this, I can make sure we have everything covered.&quot; Simon
shook his head, flicking over more pages, barely able to believe what he held
in his hands.

&quot;And that's... bad.&quot;

He heard the catch in Mal's voice as the captain caught on even as he spoke.
Saw the captain's mouth bunch up, hard and determined. &quot;Doesn't matter,
doctor.&quot;

&quot;It doesn't matter? I *am* wondering how we're going to tell Inara that her
'friend' is involved in working on the weapon tech that caused this. At the
*very* least he knows far more about it than he has any right to, for anyone
whose research work is supposed to be benign!&quot; He realised he was all but
shaking in his anger, and tried to calm himself - and lower his voice. Mal
reached up and gripped his wrist.

&quot;We're not,&quot; he said.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;We're not going to tell her. He's Alliance. We knew that. Be poor reward for
the man helping us out. And he is helping us out, Simon. He gave you this.
Didn't have to. We didn't ask for it, couldn't know about it. Even if Inara
asked him to help us, this was above and beyond. Took hell of a risk, probably
breaking a whole heap of laws Alliance don't look too kindly upon his sort
going and breaking. So we're not telling and we're not panicking - right,
doctor?&quot;

He took a breath and jerked his head convulsively in what passed for a nod, and
Mal let go his arm.

&quot;Best keep that file with us.&quot; The captain kept his hand held out, expectant,
until Simon passed the file back into it. &quot;Still doing the thing?&quot; Mal doubled
back on himself, stalling with the file still held awkwardly in the air.

&quot;Ye-es. The tests first,&quot; Simon confirmed slowly. He had to keep sight of what
they'd come here to do. &quot;I'll look through that... later.&quot;

He took the back of the chair and rolled Mal out of the room, the file held
securely across the captain's knees.

***

&quot;You're sure it was this way?&quot; Simon asked dubiously. &quot;I don't recognise any of
this.&quot; Kid was slowing down, which meant Mal was slowing down, given Simon had
the back of his chair.

&quot; - and going at a crawling pace won't likely make it any less the right way,&quot;
Mal insisted. &quot;This - this corner, I definitely remember. Was just around
there.&quot; All looked like a brace of corridors to him in truth, but he was clear
enough on his sense of space and direction and what it told him.

&quot;Around this corner, then.&quot; Simon still sounded no shortage of unconvinced.

Most of the centre was darkened and empty. They'd seen one labcoat working
late, and a couple of security fellows kicking a football around one of the
more out of the way corridors. The security men had stopped and looked guilty
in response to a hard glare from Simon which, granted, didn't do their cover
any harm, irony aside. All the doctor's tests were done and finished now,
leaving himself in some gorram awful hospital tunic and pants looked every bit
like girls' pyjamas, on account of how the buckles and buttons in his regular
clothes messed with that fancy scanner. Time was skulking around the vicinity
of midnight on the dead-end colony.

All things considered, Mal was as eager as the doctor was to find the room near
where they'd started off, which Professor Sherwin had shown them earlier to the
tune of a &quot;There are pull-out beds in here where I sometimes sleep if I get
sidetracked working late on something - no reason you shouldn't.&quot; They could
have had accommodation provided as suited their cover, but it seemed safer on
the whole to move 'round less and keep out of sight.

&quot;Mal,&quot; said Simon, as they both stared down the corridor beyond that next
corner, and he enunciated, unnecessarily, &quot;We. Are. *Lost*.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; One corridor might be much like another, but barred doors was
definitely new. &quot;What am I looking at, Simon?&quot;

&quot;I don't...&quot; The doctor seemed drawn to investigate, no matter if he forgot all
about pushing the chair in the process. Mal balanced the prof's file and his
own clothes across his knees carefully and hauled on the wheels. And almost
toppled the chair when the occupant of the nearest barred room hurled himself
against the door as he was wheeling past. Saw Simon fall back too, then twist
away with a cry as a hand clawed between the bars behind him and tried to
fasten itself to his face.

Mal swore. &quot;What the hell kind of research are they doing here?&quot;

The eyes of the fellow who'd pasted himself to the door next to him made River
look a picture of sanity. Something most assuredly creepifying in the way the
fellow clung to the door like he was trying to seep through it by sheer force
of concentration, to get to the freedom - and the people - on the other side.
Those mad eyes seemed to stare right through a man.

&quot;They've done work on repairing damage to the human brain...&quot; Simon faltered,
casting his unnerved gaze front of them. Eyes all down the corridor, watching
through the gaps between bars. &quot;Maybe these people are test subjects... waiting
to be helped.&quot;

&quot;I'm thinking even the Alliance treats its patients a mite more humane,&quot; Mal
said grimly. &quot;How'd you like it if they tossed that sister of yours in a cell
like this?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn't - &quot; Simon began faintly.

&quot;Pretty, pretty...&quot; gibbered the fellow nearest. &quot;Crazy moonbeam girl. Call
down the sun. She's not screaming now... no more... she's not screaming.&quot;

&quot;That's real nice,&quot; Mal told him blandly. &quot;You happen to talk any other
language but nonsense? Like, say, what you might be doing here behind these
bars?&quot;

&quot;Running River...&quot; the crazy guy said. &quot;All running away...&quot;

Frowning, Mal edged the chair closer. &quot;Come again?&quot; But the fellow only
retreated, shaking his head and avoiding Mal's eyes like his attention had hurt
him, muttering something over and over about guns and mud and explosions
lighting up the dark.

&quot; - Simon?&quot; He half-turned to the doctor, deeply disturbed.

&quot;Captain.&quot; Simon's voice was dead, entirely without inflection.

&quot;Reckon this here crazy fellow just read my mind.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Simon murmured, sounding numb. &quot;I... reckon that might very well be the
case.&quot;

***

_Chapter 4_

&quot;What the hell am I looking at, Simon?&quot; Mal asked again.

The doctor paused, one hand held up, fingers splayed before his part-open lips.
He didn't speak at all for several long seconds, and then he said slowly, &quot;This
is an asylum... the cells, this set-up... these people... whatever they're
doing to them, they're keeping them here long-term.&quot;

&quot;Not 'whatever they're doing'. Mind-reading, doctor. You heard well as I.
Alliance been poking into these poor folks brains just like they did your
sister's.&quot;

&quot;We don't know that. It could be a coincidence. It would be... a remarkable
coincidence, for just the place where we decided to come to actually be
involved in - &quot;

&quot;No big coincidence. We needed someplace had the facilities... No coincidence.
*Look* at him.&quot; Mal pointed to the occupant of the cell, hunching and cowering
like a man only had a pile of sandbags between himself and enemy fire. &quot;Look at
him. First he picks your sister right out of our heads, now he's having gorram
flashbacks to Serenity Valley, and... what the hell?&quot;

Inside the cell, the man had started clawing at his own face like he was fixing
to tear it clean off his skull.

&quot;No - &quot; Simon went for the door and, little surprise, found it locked. There
was no bolt, no sign of easy-accessible keys. He looked around, growing
frantic. &quot;They should be supervised. You can't just lock them away and leave
them like this. River would - &quot; He grabbed onto the bars of the cell with both
hands and called through, &quot;Stop! You don't need to hurt yourself... you don't
want to do that... take deep breaths...count them with me... try to calm
down... One...&quot;

&quot;Uh, Simon.&quot; Mal reached up to drag on his sleeve.

&quot;What the hell are you people doing down here?&quot; A voice barked out, more
strained than angry. A man in a security uniform was marching down the long
corridor, another on his heels. &quot;You can't be here.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Simon said. &quot;We were lost. But this man seems to be in some
distress - &quot;

The security fellow blanched as he came into view of the cell, and dived for a
set of keys on his belt and, in the holster next to his gun, a tranq gun. He
and his fellow had the door open and the man within doped inside a couple of
seconds. &quot;Got to keep strangers away from the inmates. Look at this.&quot; He was
addressing mostly his companion or himself with that last, looking down at the
blood on the crazy man's face and under his nails.

&quot;I'm a doctor,&quot; Simon began. &quot;I could - &quot;

&quot;You've done enough,&quot; the guard growled. &quot;Get out of here. This corridor's out
of bounds, 'less I have word from the board otherwise.&quot;

Simon persisted, though. &quot;What's wrong with these people?&quot;

&quot;I don't know and I never want to know. Before I got here... and none of your
business, anyhow.&quot;

&quot;S-Steven,&quot; Mal said warningly, just remembering their need for aliases in
time. &quot;Best do as the man suggests. Like he says, ain't any of ours.&quot;

The doctor swallowed and nodded, and clear as it was that it pained him to walk
away from the unconscious patient, walk he did.

Temporarily forgotten, Mal wheeled cautiously in his wake.

***

&quot;According to the man I was talking to this morning, that security guard we
spoke to last night has been here longer than he has - that makes it over four
years,&quot; Simon murmured, leaning down close to Mal. The morning had brought with
it an influx of life to the facility, and it seemed people were heading back
and forth along the corridor outside or wandering in and apologising every
other minute. Though all the bustle recalled sharply to him a life in more
comfortable times, he was nervous of being surrounded by so much activity.
&quot;Those people have been kept here like that for - &quot;

Mal took a hold of his wrist, where he'd gripped the edge of the surgical bed
upon which the captain lay, stalling him. &quot;Right pleased as I am to see how
you're brushing up on your people skills in all this investigating - we already
talked about this last night, Great Detective.&quot; The sea of machinery rigged
above and around Mal seemed to shrink the captain in his unfamiliar white
hospital tunic and pants, but the irascible air of authority wasn't showing any
signs of going anywhere. Although his eyes did keep drifting off up and to the
side of the rig, betraying nerves. &quot;Even saying these folks are victim of the
same experiments the Alliance done to River, you don't know if anything we
might learn here's gonna help her and we don't want folks here getting
suspicious. We deal with what's in front of us, what we know we can fix. Have
to confess I got me a personal bias toward that end, but either way - &quot;

&quot;It's what we came here to do, yes, and I fully intend to do it, captain,&quot;
Simon said, hearing it come out harder than he'd meant. He took a breath,
snapped closed his eyes briefly, and seized back his control; reminded himself
that he owed the captain for going back for River - without which action they
wouldn't be here, and Mal wouldn't be effectively crippled. And of course Mal
wanted this over, he couldn't walk... No, Simon thought, they had come here for
the captain, and everything necessary for the operation was good as laid out
before him now. But he said cautiously, &quot;I might find something here to help
River. If similar work was done here, even if it's not recent... they may have
records, especially considering that the subjects are still here. And knowing
what they did, what they were trying to do, having access to that specific
information - &quot;

Mal dipped his head in a covert but distinct nod. &quot;I know you want to help your
sister. Won't help her any though if your digging gets us caught - gets you
caught, specifically, who might I point out she's reliant upon more than a
little. Ain't none of us would know what to do to help her should her meds take
another turn for the wacky, and fancy core doctors not too mindful of the law
don't grow on trees.&quot;

&quot;I know that.&quot; Simon extracted his wrist.

&quot;There's times I don't think you do. Whatever she has of a life right now - and
I know it's not nothing; I see her laughing, see her playing with Kaylee, see
her saving the whole gorram ship from *feng le* bounty hunters - it's not so
bad in need of fixing that you need to risk her losing you, or landing her back
in that place.&quot;

&quot;What are you saying, captain?&quot;

&quot;All I'm saying is, Badger aside, girl's doing okay. Maybe she ain't right, but
what she is now, it's something she can grow with. No cause dragging her and us
down trying to hit a reset button that may not exist and... and may not even be
the right thing to do,&quot; he finished with a certain awkwardness.

Simon stared at him blankly a moment before responding, crisply, &quot;I think I
know what's the right thing for my sister.&quot;

&quot;How about I know what's best for my crew?&quot; Mal shot back. &quot;Been doing this a
while now, one fashion or another. You get a feeling about people you're
responsible for, and lately my feeling is that that sister of yours is fitting
in happier and smoother than you are. I mention this, Simon, 'cause I'm full
aware my control of this situation ends the moment you put me out on this
table. Don't jeopardise my crew unless there's call to do so.&quot; The captain held
him with a hard gaze, until those eyes slid past him, the flint going out of
them. &quot;Inara.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Mal.&quot; She glided in, wearing green today, bright and blazing as though
it were a shield against the backdrop of rock and monochrome. The green set off
her velvet dark hair, pressed flat but curling into remnant little ringlets at
the end. Simon noticed Mal being rather obvious about not noticing.

Professor Sherwin was a half-step behind, and from Mal's expression he'd have
been all too happy not noticing him at all.

&quot;Professor,&quot; Simon greeted, straightening formally.

Inara went across to Mal's bedside immediately, and Simon peeled away, trying
not to look too intently at the professor, who had after all only been on
Riarden three years, theoretically ruling him out of any direct involvement in
this at least.

Instead he said, &quot;I looked through the file you gave me last night,&quot; neutrally,
letting his eyes drift over to Inara.

The professor blanched, and tried to cover it.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Simon said - forced himself to say. &quot;The information was very
helpful. I've made all the notes I need. I'm finished with it now.&quot; He crossed
to the counter where it lay and returned to press it back into the professor's
hands.

&quot;Will your captain recover?&quot; Hoyle inquired, and nobody not knowing what to
look for would have noted his relief.

&quot;If this treatment is successful, I should be able to combat any more
generalised long-term damage. If it isn't...&quot; He faltered, watching Mal argue
animatedly with Inara even while flat on his back. &quot;Well, I should still be
able to do as much, but - &quot;

Hoyle nodded. &quot;Inara seems unwilling to tell me precisely how it was that your
captain managed to put himself in the way of a piece of high-level weapon-tech
in the first place. It seems to me an ambitious way for a small-time illegal
cargo-runner to get himself incapacitated.&quot;

Simon checked a laugh. &quot;It's not terrorism, if that's what you're worrying
about. But it's probably best you don't know.&quot; And added as he saw the
reluctance with which the professor received that evasion, &quot;Just as there are
things it's probably best Inara doesn't know.&quot;

There was a short silence.

&quot;So... you have everything ready that you need?&quot; the professor asked neutrally.

&quot;Yes. We're all set to go. I was just waiting for Inara.&quot; He grimaced, looking
across at the two, reminded that if anything went wrong he wouldn't just be
failing Mal. &quot;She wanted to see him before he went under.&quot;

***

&quot;I swear, these things are meant as a cruelty,&quot; Mal said, when Inara commented
upon the pyjamas with a smirk in her eyes and a sideways twisted smile, a catch
in her voice as it tried to bubble up into a laugh. &quot;Feel like I should be
auditioning for your kind of work.&quot;

She rolled her eyes. &quot;You couldn't cut it in my kind of work.&quot;

&quot;Too gorram ugly?&quot; he posited.

Inara shook her head, smiling for real. &quot;A companion needs to maintain a
certain... objectivity. You'd want to be the knight in shining armour to each
and every one of... the clients you didn't outright insult or punch out,&quot; she
finished with irony.

&quot;Objectivity like with you and grandpa over there?&quot;

She followed his gesture automatically, and Simon and Hoyle broke in their
discussion, noting the extra attention. When she swung back around, her face
was tight with anger. &quot;*Mal*.&quot; She paused and took in an audible breath, and he
watched her features calm again. &quot;This isn't the time,&quot; she said, pitching her
voice very low. &quot;Surely even you can see that this isn't the time?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he conceded. &quot;No, it's not. I'm a mite jittery right now, I'll hand you.&quot;

&quot;Simon's performed surgery on you before and you lived to tell the tale,&quot; she
pointed out, setting her hands on the edge of the bed and leaning more at ease
over him.

&quot;Yes. Getting shot up and knifed is nothing new. This is kinda near the
brainpan for comfort... one slip and I guess I'm gonna be talking crazy like
River, huh? Though at least that means the girl gets a playmate a mite more
savoury than Badger.&quot; He might have more confidence if it looked like his
surgeon had had a night's sleep sometime in the past week. He scratched his ear
reflexively, recalling Simon's dry explanation; &quot;*We need to inject a precisely
synthesized calcium carbonate solution into the right area of the inner ear.
Tricky, but relatively simple with the equipment here. There are a number of
ways I can try to stimulate the formation of replacement statoconia from the
solution in situ. Don't look so worried. It should work.*&quot; He brought his
hands down to clasp them together over his midriff as he realised what he was
doing. The room rotated at the sudden motion, and even though he wasn't like to
fall over while laid out flat, it still *felt* like a definite possibility.

Inara unfolded his hands to take hold of his right hand in hers, letting their
fingers interlace. &quot;There's nothing to be jittery about,&quot; she said. &quot;I know the
kind of medical care you're used to dealing with, but this isn't some frontier
world. It's Alliance, it's the best... there's very little that they can't
fix.&quot;

&quot;Or break, huh?&quot; He scowled pensively. &quot;Guess I must look like a real dumb hick
to you at times.&quot; He laughed, keen to divert the subject somehow.

&quot;All the time,&quot; she said, that mock flat tone to her voice meant he'd said
something she considered eminently stupid. &quot;You're a brainless, backwater thug.
It's your most charming feature.&quot;

&quot;I'm wounded.&quot; He held his free hand to his head, wincing, and noticed that,
over the other side of the room, Simon and Hoyle were winding down whatever
they'd been discussing. Simon looked like he was edging to set to work. &quot;So...&quot;
He caught her eye. &quot;...There's not much these fancy Alliance surgeons can't do,
huh? Guess that means there's no point making any passionate and tearful
goodbyes, just in case.&quot;

&quot;No point at all,&quot; Inara agreed with a touch of aggravation, her attention
straying again over her shoulder to Hoyle. &quot;Although I'm sure I could dig deep
into my companion training and muster up some small show of emotion, if you'd
really prefer.&quot;

&quot;No, no.&quot; He flashed his empty palm at her, fingers spread, conceding. &quot;I will
forbear.&quot;

&quot;Simon,&quot; Inara said, raising her voice, exasperation clear. &quot;Put him out?&quot;

From the way Simon seemed to be trying not to look amused as he came across,
they'd had a couple of eavesdroppers for a while. &quot;We can start,&quot; he allowed,
and frowned down at Mal. &quot;I'm going to have to sedate and nerve-block you for
the duration, as I explained, captain. This is a precision procedure - we can't
afford any possibility of autonomic movement. You'll be out for several hours,
and you should be able to move normally by the time you wake up, but I should
warn you, there may some traces of the block still in place.&quot;

&quot;How many hours is 'several hours'?&quot; Mal asked, and didn't think there was any
blaming him for being a mite untrusting. He had only the doctor's word on what
measures were required, after all, and the doc was pretty much known for
putting people down a few hours if they seemed like to get in the way.

&quot;Six to eight.&quot; Simon prepped the dope gun on the small table next to the
machine rig, and from the edge in his voice the boy had a good idea of the
thoughts behind the question. &quot;Your body *will* need that time to start it on
the road to recovery. After you wake, we'll see how much time it seems wise to
give before we move.&quot;

Mal followed the movements of the dope gun uneasily, slid his gaze to Inara, at
Simon's side, her hand still laced in his. Couldn't say a word to her,
obviously. And damn it, it was futile to pretend Simon wasn't going to try help
his sister no matter what, or that he could exert any control over that, in
current circumstance. Maybe it was only futile to worry about the inevitable on
top of all else he had to be worrying about. Speaking of which... &quot;You've done
this before, Simon, right? Successfully?&quot;

&quot;I've done similar. Yours is not what I would call a common problem. It should
be fine. Besides, it won't really be me doing the work.&quot;

Mal glanced between he, Hoyle, and Inara, and didn't see any other potential
surgeon among them. &quot;Come again?&quot;

Simon swung the main part of the rig of the machine in over Mal's head,
intensifying the unpleasant feel of being stuck inside a metal box. He pointed
up into it. &quot;In here, there's a very advanced computer. I've input all the data
from yesterday to thoroughly map the area we're working with. The computer
itself will perform the operation, matching the details of its own less complex
but still highly sophisticated sensors to the map. I program in the raw facts
of what needs doing, and - &quot;

&quot;It sticks a bunch of needles in my head to do this thing for you,&quot; Mal
finished up, his voice pitching higher than its norm. He swallowed.

&quot;Essentially, yes,&quot; Simon said, perturbed.

&quot;I don't know, doc. I think I'd rather have you picking around in my head than
some Alliance machine.&quot;

Simon said, with a slow, patronising candour that must have made him just the
darling of all his rich patients back on Osiris, &quot;The machine is about a
hundred times more accurate than the very best human surgeon, Mal, and I'm not
a specialist on the inner ear. Believe me, you want the machine. In any case,
I'll be watching it work on the monitor here in case any human corrections
*are* necessary - which they *won't* be.&quot; He tapped the display screen at the
side of the rig.

&quot;Okay...&quot; He tried without success to quash his nervous laugh.

Inara squeezed his hand tighter and looked daggers at Simon. &quot;It will be all
right,&quot; she said, and, &quot;You really have cultivated that bedside manner, Simon.&quot;

The doctor held the dope gun ready, switching on the machine so that lights
blinked in its overhanging bulk, and started up a dim electronic whir barely on
the edge of hearing. He made to start forward, but Inara got in his way,
interposing her body to lean closer over Mal.

&quot;I know you're afraid - &quot;

&quot;Hell, yes.&quot;

She smiled at his candour, and her hand brushed gently across his forehead.
&quot;Don't be.&quot; They held that look a long moment.

&quot;Inara,&quot; Simon prompted gently, and she let him move her aside, though she
retained her grip on Mal's hand even as the doctor set the dope gun to his neck
and depressed its trigger.

Mal felt the faint sting, and the spreading numbness. Inara's fingers felt
small and delicate in his, but her grip was hella tight. He blinked up, managed
to find and focus on Simon's face. Saw enough there to *know*...

&quot;Be careful,&quot; he told the doctor thickly, not talking about surgery. Then his
thoughts surrendered to the Black.

***

Simon was so far away he didn't feel like Simon any more, barely a wisp of him
left on the edge of concentration, distances of the Black between. The absence
set her off-balance, reeling like the captain, her internal direction all
turned amiss. River turned over the thought of Simon as her Pole Star. Thought
of finding the real Pole Star, piecing it from old charts out of
Earth-That-Was. She might download such charts from the cortex. Maybe it could
help them all to find their way...

But unlike the captain, her sense of the floor under her feet behaved, in a
non-metaphorical way, so she followed her feet along the corridor, taking
advantage of that. She knew he'd be there as she turned in to the engine room,
and saw him then with her eyes as well as without. Saw him looking at some
pretty, slender, small thing that was her, but wasn't really her.

&quot;Wondered where you were at,&quot; Badger said. &quot;Good at hiding out on this boat,
ain't you?&quot;

He was sprawled in amongst Kaylee's things, and she paused, looking down at it
all. &quot;That's Kaylee's.&quot;

&quot;Well, Kaylee ain't here to be missing it. Let her have it back all
pristine-like soon as she is. No harm, no foul. See?&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; She could see he was sad again. Missing his kingdom ever more now,
with all the ways home blocked. He didn't like being at the mercy of others;
had no faith in others' mercy. Missed the people to tell what to do, the people
who had to pretend to like and respect him so he could fool himself by
pretending it wasn't pretend. He was even beginning to wish the captain was
back, a little, because the captain was a part of his world the way Book and
Wash (*those stubborn and unfriendly peasants*) weren't; at least he and the
captain moderately understood each other, spoke the language, knew how things
should work. &quot;No harm, no foul.&quot; She added, with a smirk, &quot;It's pink. And there
are flowers.&quot; And watched him shift uncomfortably, rocking Kaylee's hammock,
reaching up quickly to keep his hat in place.

Cast a final quick study around the corner. &quot;All right.&quot; Irritation all over
him as he swung out of the hammock. &quot;Rutting uncomfortable gorram device
anyhow, you ask me.&quot;

She laughed at him, and he didn't mind, because he liked to watch her laugh.
She lost herself in being the girl he watched, and leaned back against the bulk
of the engine, and only returned to herself when he caught her arm and she
looked up to realise him close enough to do so, standing so as almost to corner
her. She smiled up at him, surrounded by the warm glow of his regard.

&quot;You really set upon that big merc with a knife?&quot; he asked.

&quot;He's got a scar.&quot; She ran a finger down the rough edge of Badger's lapel. The
fabric was coarse and felt more like a rag for scrubbing than clothes. It - he
- smelled fusty. Of smoke and incense, legal and otherwise, of animals and
streets and alcohol and the thousand different scents of Persephone's markets.
And he wasn't a gentle man, and he wasn't a good man, but she was used to the
presence of others who were plenty of neither. &quot;He ruined a T-shirt. I remember
cutting it. I don't recall what I was feeling when I did. Simon's changed my
medication since then. He knows how to help me better now. I won't cut
you.&quot;

&quot;Wasn't worrying about it, love.&quot; But his nervous laugh on its own would have
been enough to whisper her the lie.

He was more familiar now, her mind adjusted to his presence, and she'd found
there was room to squeeze in one more, after all, without reducing her further.
He set his hand to his breast, trapping her fingers that were already there,
flattening her palm to the coarse lapel, and she stared at their hands, one
over the other, and remembered other touches, pieces and snapshots of other
lives. Wash and Zoe, in their cabin, on the ship. That night in the shiny
silver whorehouse. &quot;Well now, sweetheart,&quot; he said, gentleness and want.

&quot;Your intentions are dishonourable,&quot; she told him, frowning, inclining her
head. It was good that they should both understand where they stood.

&quot;They are, at that. Just a little bit, mind.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to kiss me?&quot; she asked him. She felt her heart pick up because his
did, and felt a thrill and a fear. She'd never done this inside her own
skin.

&quot;Happy to oblige.&quot; And he was surprised; had expected a struggle, to have to
persuade. Silver tongue and all that... *that's silver in more ways than one,
my love*.

River stood on her tip-toes and closed her eyes; parted her lips a fraction to
meet his, and bumped her forehead upon his hat. The contact made her retreat in
surprise, and he swept it off his head, tossing it aside to land in the pink
hammock instead, and bowed a small apology. She grinned and stepped up to try
again.

His face was rough (rougher than Wash's, much rougher than Zoe's, or Nandi's,
or Inara's lily-livered rich boys, or even the boy at the parts yard on Vandeen
that Kaylee never told Simon about) and its roughness abraded her cheek almost
pleasantly. *Scratch-scratch*, and beneath the scratch, a cautious mouth, not
hard, not gentle, and on it she tasted all the scents of his jacket. He told
her silently that she tasted like antiseptic... neutral, surgical... and that
that was all right. His hands didn't stray from their rest on her hand and her
arm. When they parted, it was a soft leavetaking, by mutual concession.

River blinked, carried back to herself by the ebb of the tide. She swayed in
the reality of the present and its inexorable future. Badger's thoughts
scratched at the edge of hers like stubble against her cheek.

He said, &quot;That was - &quot; And she pressed a finger to his mouth, silencing him.

&quot;It can't work,&quot; she told him earnestly.

&quot;What?&quot; Disappointment in a faint, not-quite-believing laugh.

She explained patiently, &quot;You have to go back to Persephone, and Persephone
isn't safe for me and Simon, even if we could stop running, which we can't -
and besides, the captain and Simon would hurt you.&quot;

&quot;I'm not one for caring about - &quot; He saw it in her face, changed tack. &quot;Could
always not tell them. We'll always have the right now. Seize the moment, so
they do say...&quot;

River shook her head. &quot;I couldn't hide it from them.&quot; She reached up and held
both his lapels, smiling, trying to make him understand. &quot;Sometimes the world
crashes in and I can't control what I'm saying, and... it's all very confusing.
Besides, Simon's my doctor, silly. You have to tell your doctor.&quot;

He backed off, a swift pull of his hands detaching hers from his jacket, not
roughly. Just a step back for distance while a maelstrom in his head confused
her. His eyes studied her, and she saw herself change, reshape, become some
other new reflection. Badger leaned to retrieve his hat.

He self-consciously set it on her head, and tweaked a loose strand of her hair
with his fingers. Brushed her shoulders off as if he were ashamed what he might
have left of himself there.

&quot;Ah, well,&quot; he said, matter-of-fact. &quot;Like they say: best to throw the little
ones back. Can always catch 'em again, later.&quot;

He left the engine room without looking back, and turned down into the cargo
bay, disappearing away from her.

Frowning, River adjusted the hat on her head. Then she took it off, and watched
it turn slowly in her hands.

***

&quot;And it went well? So... he'll be all right, won't he?&quot; Inara persisted,
following Simon as he cleaned up, washing and wiping his hands.

&quot;There were no complications. Everything went as well as it could, and he
should be fine. He'll stay out for another four hours, perhaps - &quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; She looked back at Mal on the table - which, with the machine body
cranked up and to the side again out of the way and the platform lowered,
looked almost like an ordinary bed. &quot;He looks... so quiet and still.&quot;

&quot;Well... in a short while, he'll be awake, insulting you and yelling at me
again, and very likely complaining loudly to be fed and watered,&quot; Simon told
her.

&quot;And he'll be able to walk?&quot;

&quot;I've seen no reason why the treatment shouldn't take. All indications are that
the crystallisation of the calcium carbonate solution is progressing well; the
new statoconia should be fully solid well before the sedative wears off. But
for the final proof we can only wait and see. If it takes, he should feel the
effects as soon as he wakes up. We could be away from here very quickly.&quot; He
didn't sound, Inara noted, entirely enamoured with that latter thought. Odd.
Her own feelings, courtesy of Hoyle, were more complicated, but Simon... Simon
should be impatient to get out of there, to get back to his sister.

&quot;Inara, I have an alarm hooked up to the machines that are monitoring his
stats,&quot; Simon said, &quot;But it would probably help to have someone here sitting
by, especially when he wakes up... to keep him still if he wakes early, if
nothing else... and there are some things that I should do while I'm here.
Would you stay?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she breathed, and saw it immediately reflected in his face that she had
revealed too much. But he said nothing, merely gave a professional nod. A
moment after, it occurred to her to question what he'd said. &quot;What other things
should you be doing? Surely you ought to be the one to stay here, in case
anything happens. What if he needs help quickly?&quot;

&quot;It's a minimal risk. And... there are some things I can look up while we're
here.&quot; His voice had lowered considerably. &quot;They might help River... The
captain knows.&quot;

Inara nodded. &quot;Of course. And yes, I'll stay. I was... considering it anyway.&quot;
