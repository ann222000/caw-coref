Questions from the press conference:
I was told on the radio to stay in his pit so I would not interfere
and hold up  Kimi on his hotlap. I exited the pit directly behind Kimi
so it was still very close, a little sooner and I would have been out
directly in front of Kimi.&quot;

Oh dear, He's right, he was on Raikkonen tail when he left the pit and
had he gone sooner he would have been in front and penalised for
holding up Kimi's hot lap on his own out lap like Monza 2006.

He may have been penalised for holding up Raikkonen  or he could still
be penalised for holding up LH. On track he could have pulled over to
one side.

31.7 &quot;Any driver taking part in any practice session who, in the
opinion of the stewards, stops unnecessarily on the circuit or
unnecessarily impedes another driver shall be subject to the penalties
referred to in Article 31.6.&quot;

This covers sectoin 33 &quot;The qualifying practice session&quot;. Did Alonso
&quot;unnecessarily impede&quot; another driver? If so Article 31.6 says:

&quot;Stewards may drop the driver such number of grid positions as they
consider appropriate. Unless it is completely clear that a driver
committed a driving infringement any such incident will normally be
investigated after the relevant session, any penalty imposed shall not
be subject to appeal.Where appropriate, regard will also be given to
the provisions of Article 18.1.&quot;

Yes, that may have been the first stop. But what about the second when
he came out ahead of Kimi? That's the lap that mattered.

He was directly behind Kimi when he left ON THE SECOND STOP. Keep up.
Had he left the pit sooner he would have been penalised for holding
Kimi. Alonso made the finish line with 1.865 second before the
qualifying ended, so if he had to pull over to let Kimi past he still
would have been fucked and missed his last lap. Catch 22.

I was watching the one where Kimi passes Freddy in the corner at the

IIRC in the first one, both Kimi and Alonso entered the pits in the
same lap, Kimi was leading. In the second one Alonso ventured out just
after Kimi when he -Kimi- was in his hot lap. But ey, i might missed
it.

I watched the clock counting down.  He sat in the pit stall for 10
seconds after the lollipop went up.  So he had 11.8+ seconds to spare on
that out lap; enough time to pull over and let Kimi through and still
get his final lap in.  Your explanation doesn't hold up.

You might well be right and if that were the case it would be fair
enough, and Alonso severely wronged.

But then why not say that in the press conference? Why look so edgy
and guilty. Why would Hamilton look so pissed off? Why did Ron get so
angry that he grabbed Alonso's trainer , remove his head set and march
him off?

Alonso should have looked happy and all that. Hamilton would have
looked gutted but resigned. Why didnt Ron have that as the instant,
but annoying explanation?

Add to that Alonso's clear frustration in the first pit stop and his
lack of any emotion or movement int he second.

Sorry, but their body language does not match your version of events.

Clearly Alonso, the 2x WDC, is so under presure from this over rated
rookie that he has to do a Schuey.

FANTASTIC, F1 has not been this much fun for years. I so can't wait
for tomorrow's reaction on the track.

Its true that Alonso was told to stay but then the lilly pop was lifted
and he should have gone but he didn't, he stayed longer to stop his team
mate beating him. Alonso just admitted to everyone that his rookie team
mate is better than him and he'll have to resort to dirty tricks.

What was to prevent him from pulling out of the service area so that
Hamilton could get in for tyres and fuel and then waiting outside it before
rejoining the pit lane? Then they could both have got back on the track with
time to make the qualy deadline.

I'll wait for Ron's official explanation before jumping too hard on this one
but from the body language of all parties involved it looks like a
deliberate attempt to sabotage one's teammate. I believe Ron to be an
honourable and principled man who while using team orders in situations
where it benefits the team, as does everyone else, will consider this to be
the lowest form of behaviour possible. I now don't fancy Alonso's chances of
remaining in the team in the long term.

Whatever the skills, speed or personal attributes of the McLaren drivers
they are first and foremost expected to be team players. Sabotaging your
teammate might have been ok for Scumbag and Ferrari but it certainly won't
be for Alonso and McLaren. Hamilton isn't just another in a long list of
drivers to Ron. He's a protege that Ron discovered, sponsored, supported and
formed extremely close bonds with over a ten year period. Hamilton even said
as a child that his dream was to drive for Mclaren. Not F1 in general or
Ferrari or Renault but McLaren. You only had to look at Ron's demeanour and
the tears in his eyes as Hamilton proved himself race by race to understand
how close that bond is. Even so I don't believe that Ron's sense of honour
would allow him to unfairly prejudice Alonso while both drivers have a
chance of becoming champion but for Alonso to sabotage Hamilton, if that is
indeed what happened, will be an unforgiveable and terminal sin in his book.

In the short term the team will continue to come first and both drivers will
continue to get the best support that the team can give them. In the long
term Alonso will now be damaged goods.

What I will add is that I was impressed by how calmly Lewis coped with all
this given his tender years and how diplomatic he was at the photo shoot
before the press conference when he put his arm round Alonso and then what
he said, or perhaps didn't say, in the press conference itself. That also
won't be forgotten by Ron. That's the mark of a real team player as far as
Ron is concerned. Lewis has now positioned himself as not only a fast driver
but as a mature and diplomatic team envoy. I think his future is now more
assured than it even was before.

All fine except F1 is not a sport it's a financial investment for big

What a load of bullshit, a few races ago in Monaco Hamilton had his
childish outburst bitching about being a #2 driver and treated like a
#2. He is a dishonest person who lied outright when in reality he is
being treated as #1 at McLaren.

sense to use a 11-year investment for one season.

If it was down to driver's nationalities, why would a UK/FRG team want a
Spanish driver over a Brit?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Questions from the press conference:
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was told on the radio to stay in his pit so I would not interfere
&gt;&gt;&gt; and hold up  Kimi on his hotlap. I exited the pit directly behind Kimi
&gt;&gt;&gt; so it was still very close, a little sooner and I would have been out
&gt;&gt;&gt; directly in front of Kimi.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh dear, He's right, he was on Raikkonen tail when he left the pit and
&gt;&gt;&gt; had he gone sooner he would have been in front and penalised for
&gt;&gt;&gt; holding up Kimi's hot lap on his own out lap like Monza 2006.
&gt;&gt; What was to prevent him from pulling out of the service area so that
&gt;&gt; Hamilton could get in for tyres and fuel and then waiting outside it before
&gt;&gt; rejoining the pit lane? Then they could both have got back on the track with
&gt;&gt; time to make the qualy deadline.

&gt;&gt; I'll wait for Ron's official explanation before jumping too hard on this one
&gt;&gt; but from the body language of all parties involved it looks like a
&gt;&gt; deliberate attempt to sabotage one's teammate. I believe Ron to be an
&gt;&gt; honourable and principled man who while using team orders in situations
&gt;&gt; where it benefits the team, as does everyone else, will consider this to be
&gt;&gt; the lowest form of behaviour possible. I now don't fancy Alonso's chances of
&gt;&gt; remaining in the team in the long term.

&gt;&gt; Whatever the skills, speed or personal attributes of the McLaren drivers
&gt;&gt; they are first and foremost expected to be team players. Sabotaging your
&gt;&gt; teammate might have been ok for Scumbag and Ferrari but it certainly won't
&gt;&gt; be for Alonso and McLaren. Hamilton isn't just another in a long list of
&gt;&gt; drivers to Ron. He's a protege that Ron discovered, sponsored, supported and
&gt;&gt; formed extremely close bonds with over a ten year period. Hamilton even said
&gt;&gt; as a child that his dream was to drive for Mclaren. Not F1 in general or
&gt;&gt; Ferrari or Renault but McLaren. You only had to look at Ron's demeanour and
&gt;&gt; the tears in his eyes as Hamilton proved himself race by race to understand
&gt;&gt; how close that bond is. Even so I don't believe that Ron's sense of honour
&gt;&gt; would allow him to unfairly prejudice Alonso while both drivers have a
&gt;&gt; chance of becoming champion but for Alonso to sabotage Hamilton, if that is
&gt;&gt; indeed what happened, will be an unforgiveable and terminal sin in his book.

&gt;&gt; In the short term the team will continue to come first and both drivers will
&gt;&gt; continue to get the best support that the team can give them. In the long
&gt;&gt; term Alonso will now be damaged goods.

&gt;&gt; What I will add is that I was impressed by how calmly Lewis coped with all
&gt;&gt; this given his tender years and how diplomatic he was at the photo shoot
&gt;&gt; before the press conference when he put his arm round Alonso and then what
&gt;&gt; he said, or perhaps didn't say, in the press conference itself. That also
&gt;&gt; won't be forgotten by Ron. That's the mark of a real team player as far as
&gt;&gt; Ron is concerned. Lewis has now positioned himself as not only a fast driver
&gt;&gt; but as a mature and diplomatic team envoy. I think his future is now more
&gt;&gt; assured than it even was before.

&gt; What a load of bullshit, a few races ago in Monaco Hamilton had his
&gt; childish outburst bitching about being a #2 driver and treated like a
&gt; #2. He is a dishonest person who lied outright when in reality he is
&gt; being treated as #1 at McLaren.
">

What evidence is there that he is being treated as #1, as opposed to the
equal of Alonso?

Don't be daft. Alonso has done no harm to his reputation whatsoever. I did
say Hamilton may be more popular in North America as they might see him as
the next Tiger Woods. BUT, Alonso may well have more marketing potential
across most of Europe and certainly South America. The bottom line is MONEY
will decide who stays and who goes, not driving ability.

You really are crazy if you seriously believe that.

Hamilton's future at McLaren is 100% cast iron guaranteed.

Until today, Alonso's was pretty secure if he wanted it. Now he will be
lucky to last out the season. The only question is whether Kubica is
available to join McLaren from Turkey...

Perhaps because Mercedes and Vodafone are both massive worldwide Companies?
TheUK only has a population of 60 million, 5 million of them jocks, around 2
million Welsh and about 1 1/2 million Irish. They don't give a fuck about an
Englishman full stop. So England has a population of qround 50 million. I
think Alonso will be a far bigger star in Europe and other parts of the
World than Hamilton is at the moment.

At the end of the day it doesn't matter. At the end of the season we will
find out. But at some point Ron has to make someone a number 1 driver to
ensure that Ferrari don't sneak past them whilst Hamilton and Alonso are
arguing with each other like 10 year old kids.

Schumacher who was utterly loyal to his team, sat behind Massa at Turkey
last year, handed a race win to Irvine to help him in a failed WDC
attempt and never uttered a bad word even when let down.

You're entitled to no more respect than you give will get only that much

As with Stepneygate, so it is with Alonso - you and others like you all

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Questions from the press conference:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was told on the radio to stay in his pit so I would not interfere
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and hold up  Kimi on his hotlap. I exited the pit directly behind
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kimi so it was still very close, a little sooner and I would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been out directly in front of Kimi.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh dear, He's right, he was on Raikkonen tail when he left the pit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and had he gone sooner he would have been in front and penalised
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for holding up Kimi's hot lap on his own out lap like Monza 2006.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What was to prevent him from pulling out of the service area so that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hamilton could get in for tyres and fuel and then waiting outside it
&gt;&gt;&gt; before rejoining the pit lane? Then they could both have got back on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the track with time to make the qualy deadline.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll wait for Ron's official explanation before jumping too hard on
&gt;&gt;&gt; this one but from the body language of all parties involved it looks
&gt;&gt;&gt; like a deliberate attempt to sabotage one's teammate. I believe Ron
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be an honourable and principled man who while using team orders
&gt;&gt;&gt; in situations where it benefits the team, as does everyone else,
&gt;&gt;&gt; will consider this to be the lowest form of behaviour possible. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; now don't fancy Alonso's chances of remaining in the team in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; long term.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whatever the skills, speed or personal attributes of the McLaren
&gt;&gt;&gt; drivers they are first and foremost expected to be team players.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sabotaging your teammate might have been ok for Scumbag and Ferrari
&gt;&gt;&gt; but it certainly won't be for Alonso and McLaren.

&gt;&gt;What an ungracious and self righteous donkey you are.

&gt;&gt;You immediately assumed Alonso is in the wrong.

&gt;&gt;And I'm utterly fed up with the sanctimonious soapbox lectures of the
&gt;&gt;holy, with the continual slurs against Schumacher and Ferrari. The
&gt;&gt;same Schumacher who was utterly loyal to his team, sat behind Massa at
&gt;&gt;Turkey last year, handed a race win to Irvine to help him in a failed
&gt;&gt;WDC attempt and never uttered a bad word even when let down.

&gt;&gt;You're entitled to no more respect than you give will get only that
&gt;&gt;much from me.

&gt;&gt;As with Stepneygate, so it is with Alonso - you and others like you
&gt;&gt;all nod your head in mock wisdom and pronounce a view that is as
&gt;&gt;blinkered as your view of the world. A view that instantly identifies
&gt;&gt;your bias.

&gt;&gt;More power to Mark to put you cretins in your place. His brand of
&gt;&gt;response is no less than you and your kind deserve.

&gt; Sorry, mate, but now you've gone too far - and you can't even blame
&gt; the drink. Mark puts no-one &quot;in their place&quot;, other than himself
&gt; continually in the gutter. If you're aligning yourself so closely with
&gt; him, I've lost all respect for you. And it ill behooves you to accuse
&gt; anyone of &quot;bias&quot;...

&gt; &lt;shakes head sadly&gt;

David - I don't believe I've _ever_ used insulting language (like
Schumacher gets here) towards a driver or team owner around here. I've
had enough of it, and its perpetual justification contrasted with the
points I make and language I use. Properly fed up with it, and anyone to
continually uses that language will get the same back and _no_ respect.

It's an individual choice posters takt and everyone is entitled to my
respect until the choose to lose it.

I have no problem with that. What I have a major problem with is that
you have just offered your respect to one of the worst offenders in
this place of the very crime you say you have an issue with.
Frusciante abuses anyone and everyone who doesn't think the sun shines
out of the collective arse of Schumacher and Ferrari. And if you think
he does it &quot;to put cretins in their place&quot;, you're a very poor judge
of character. It really saddens me to see you align yourself with him.
Choosing Dave Baker as your target for this attack is also somewhat
bizarre...

&gt;&gt; Yes, that may have been the first stop. But what about the second when
&gt;&gt; he came out ahead of Kimi? That's the lap that mattered.

&gt; He was directly behind Kimi when he left ON THE SECOND STOP. Keep up.
&gt; Had he left the pit sooner he would have been penalised for holding
&gt; Kimi. Alonso made the finish line with 1.865 second before the
&gt; qualifying ended, so if he had to pull over to let Kimi past he still
&gt; would have been fucked and missed his last lap. Catch 22.

Did you read Depresions' post? He correctly said he could have moved out
of Kimis way on the track. You can't do that in the pits.

&gt; You might well be right and if that were the case it would be fair
&gt; enough, and Alonso severely wronged.

&gt; But then why not say that in the press conference? Why look so edgy
&gt; and guilty. Why would Hamilton look so pissed off? Why did Ron get so
&gt; angry that he grabbed Alonso's trainer , remove his head set and march
&gt; him off?

&gt; Alonso should have looked happy and all that. Hamilton would have
&gt; looked gutted but resigned. Why didnt Ron have that as the instant,
&gt; but annoying explanation?

&gt; Add to that Alonso's clear frustration in the first pit stop and his
&gt; lack of any emotion or movement int he second.

&gt; Sorry, but their body language does not match your version of events.

&gt; Clearly Alonso, the 2x WDC, is so under presure from this over rated
&gt; rookie that he has to do a Schuey.

&gt; FANTASTIC, F1 has not been this much fun for years. I so can't wait
&gt; for tomorrow's reaction on the track.
