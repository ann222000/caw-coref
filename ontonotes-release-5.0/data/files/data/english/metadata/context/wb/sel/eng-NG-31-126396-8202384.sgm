As a skeptical Windows user, I approached the iPhone today and was
curious about it, not intending to buy. In short, I was surprised, and I
came to the following conclusions:

1) I could replace my iPod with this

2) Most of the reasons for having a navigation system are replaced with
this phone (even though there isn't built in GPS)

3) Cost is dead even with T-Mobile for the same service

4) Coverage is better in some of the fringe areas where I live

5) Wife hates her current phone's &quot;can't lock the phone when you're in a
call&quot; and I hate my current T-Mobile Dash's &quot;forget to lock it and
you'll ass-dial someone&quot;. The iPhone's screen is touch sensitive,
meaning that you can't substitute a pointer for your finger, therefore,
unless you have a hole in your pocket that goes to your butt, you can't
ass-dial an iPhone and there's no real need to lock it.

So, I bought two, and we converted over from T-Mobile to Cingular. I
won't bother going in to the positives of the unit as it has been
covered pretty well everywhere else, so I'll focus on some of the misses:

1) Activating two phones got a bit confusing, as the option says
&quot;Activate more than one phone on a single plan&quot;, but never gives you the
opportunity to add a second phone. You have to go back and add yourself
to an &quot;Existing plan&quot; after the first phone has been added to a newly
created plan.

2) The headphone jack frankly sucks. I have 4 pairs of Sennheiser
headphones, none of which will plug in to the iPhone jack. The shroud on
the plug on the heaphones hits the molding on the phone. I'd use the ear
buds, but those #$(%*#$(%* speaker ear buds are just horrible sounding,
so I'll have to find a solution for this.

3) Transferring 4+ gigabytes of music data took a while (probably &gt; 10
minutes), but that's what you get for using flash instead of a hard drive.

4) The POP mail service defaults to &quot;Use SSL&quot;, which is annoying since
my server doesn't use SSL. Took a while to figure out why it wasn't
connecting properly.

5) You cannot drag and drop music files from your local hard disk
directly to the iPhone. The only way I could figure out how to do it was
to create a local iPhone playlist, then sync that playlist to the device.

6) The &quot;Youtube&quot; search button doesn't search all of YouTube. For
example, type &quot;rush far cry&quot;, and you get one Rush video, then a bunch
of other non-Rush videos. Go to youtube.com and you'll get a whole hoard
of Rush Far Cry videos.

7) As has been mentioned before, the data transfer rate from AT&amp;T isn't
all that fast, but it's not intolerable, either. From the time when I
hit the Safari button and click on Yahoo, it's about 29 seconds. Google
comes up in about 6.

Anyway, the device is really seamless. My iPod now sits in a dock here
at home, and I'm going to give the nav system to my wife. ;-)

Yes, but this is why iPod devices' GUI have such good navigation. iTunes
manages the programs well because it syncs the library on iTunes with the
library on the iPod device. This might not seem important until you try to
use another media device that lets you drag-and-drop. Someone else was
complaining last week that they hated iTunes/iPod because one couldn't
drag-and-drop MP3 files onto the iPod from the system file manager, so I
borrowed a Kaser Mambo2 from a friend which supports drag-and-drop loading.
NOW I understand why Apple makes you go through iTunes! The Kaser has
terrible organization and I can see if one had a lot of content, it would be
next to impossible to find anything or, especially, to keep separate &quot;cuts&quot;
of a long work like a symphony together. Drag-and-drop players simply have no
way to associate different MP3 files together in any order and if you make
one file from a long work, there is no way (that I can see) to access the
individual movements within that long file. No, Apple knew what they were
doing when they forced users to use iTunes to manage the content of iPods.

That's because the total You-Tube library is not available yet. If you go to:

actually, there is a way to do it, and many mp3 players make use of
it- it's called id3 tags.  many mp3 players, ipod included, auto sorts
by the tags, which include album, song, genre, and track information.

the problem you have is either your friend doesn't have his songs
tagged (which just about every new music ripper will do for you (i do
have some songs i ripped from cd's way back when (~2000) before cddb
was real popular that are untagged, but if i cared, there are auto-
taggers available now (itunes included)), or a problem specific to
that mp3 player, not ones that allow you to drag and drop (and you are
comparing to one of the cheaper players out there, so it's not *that*
surprising that it lacks features (although not auto-organizing by
genere/album/track is a bit surprising anyways)).

Yeah, YouTube apparently won't be done converting their entire library

The Store was absolutely in negotiations at the time. But it was very
clear it wasn't going to be a significant profit contributor.
Your comment sounded like a cynic's &quot;All they wanted was the profit

I'll cut out the nastiness below; it made the same points.

People have lately been accusing Apple of some very strange motives
regarding the iTunes Store. It is just not so; it's a very
straightforward and clean operation, direct and useful and not the
least bit misleading or guileful.
Not like so many of the other operations, especially regarding devices
to play on and DRM and conversion options.

A pretty little attitude to keep; I'm sure you can feel justified with
it. But it's narrow-minded, unrealistic, and silly.

The fact is, LOTS of cable and connector makers use larger boots and
wider bases on plug ends -- of many kinds.
I've had Ethernet cables with molded boots too large for a network
station, RCAs with big rubber molds that prevented them from being used
close together, and this problem with a headphone jack that was too
wide for a slightly recessed receiver.

It's a tiny fix; I got over it.

In any case, I figure the chances are 30-70 in Apple's favor that the
plug is what violates the specs for that, because of the low current
and straight design of the plug type.

&gt;&gt; created plan.

&gt;&gt; 2) The headphone jack frankly sucks. I have 4 pairs of Sennheiser
&gt;&gt; headphones, none of which will plug in to the iPhone jack. The shroud on
&gt;&gt; the plug on the heaphones hits the molding on the phone. I'd use the ear
&gt;&gt; buds, but those #$(%*#$(%* speaker ear buds are just horrible sounding,
&gt;&gt; so I'll have to find a solution for this.

&gt; What about trying to carefully trim back the plastic shroud on one of the
&gt; Sennheiser headphone sets with an X-acto knife?

&gt;&gt; 3) Transferring 4+ gigabytes of music data took a while (probably &gt; 10
&gt;&gt; minutes), but that's what you get for using flash instead of a hard drive.

&gt; Yep.

&gt;&gt; 4) The POP mail service defaults to &quot;Use SSL&quot;, which is annoying since
&gt;&gt; my server doesn't use SSL. Took a while to figure out why it wasn't
&gt;&gt; connecting properly.

&gt;&gt; 5) You cannot drag and drop music files from your local hard disk
&gt;&gt; directly to the iPhone. The only way I could figure out how to do it was
&gt;&gt; to create a local iPhone playlist, then sync that playlist to the device.

&gt; Yes, but this is why iPod devices' GUI have such good navigation. iTunes
&gt; manages the programs well because it syncs the library on iTunes with the
&gt; library on the iPod device. This might not seem important until you try to
&gt; use another media device that lets you drag-and-drop. Someone else was
&gt; complaining last week that they hated iTunes/iPod because one couldn't
&gt; drag-and-drop MP3 files onto the iPod from the system file manager, so I
&gt; borrowed a Kaser Mambo2 from a friend which supports drag-and-drop loading.
&gt; NOW I understand why Apple makes you go through iTunes! The Kaser has
&gt; terrible organization and I can see if one had a lot of content, it would be
&gt; next to impossible to find anything or, especially, to keep separate &quot;cuts&quot;
&gt; of a long work like a symphony together. Drag-and-drop players simply have no
&gt; way to associate different MP3 files together in any order and if you make
&gt; one file from a long work, there is no way (that I can see) to access the
&gt; individual movements within that long file. No, Apple knew what they were
&gt; doing when they forced users to use iTunes to manage the content of iPods.

&gt;&gt; 6) The &quot;Youtube&quot; search button doesn't search all of YouTube. For
&gt;&gt; example, type &quot;rush far cry&quot;, and you get one Rush video, then a bunch
&gt;&gt; of other non-Rush videos. Go to youtube.com and you'll get a whole hoard
&gt;&gt; of Rush Far Cry videos.

&gt; That's because the total You-Tube library is not available yet. If you go to:
&gt; &lt; http://www.apple.com/appletv/tour.html &gt; They say that the entire You-Tube
&gt; will be available in the fall. They have been saying this since they first
&gt; announced it.

&gt;&gt; 7) As has been mentioned before, the data transfer rate from AT&amp;T isn't
&gt;&gt; all that fast, but it's not intolerable, either. From the time when I
&gt;&gt; hit the Safari button and click on Yahoo, it's about 29 seconds. Google
&gt;&gt; comes up in about 6.

&gt;&gt; Anyway, the device is really seamless. My iPod now sits in a dock here
&gt;&gt; at home, and I'm going to give the nav system to my wife. ;-)

God forbid!  My roomie just got a new iPhone.  He is now several thousand
dollars further in debt because he is so strange.

However, from what he will let me see of it, it's pretty gonzo.

In fact, now I want one of them suckers!
I guess us back-woods Windroids want any new thing that comes down the Pike
-- especially if they're all shiny and stuff.
