SRILA JIVA GOSVAMI

Sri Sanatana, Sri Rupa and Sri Vallabha were three brothers, all employed in
the service of the Badsa Hussain Shah. Amongst the three, there was only one
descendent, Sri Jiva. Having been rewarded richly by the Badsa for their
sevices, their household life was very opulent. There was nothing lacking in
whatever was necessary for the upbringing of the only son. The house was
illuminated by the effulgence of the child's golden complexion; his eyes
were like the expanded petals of the lotus; every part of his body was
graced with a lusterous, radiant splendor.

When Sri Gaurasundara came to Ramakeli, Sri Jiva was blessed by having
darsana of His worshippable Lord, though he was just a baby at the time.
Placing the dust of His lotus feet on the child's head, Mahaprabhu indicated
him to be the future sovereign preceptor of the Gaudiya sampradaya. Though
he was only a child, Sri Jiva kept the form of the Lord, which fascinates
all the world, within his heart. As he grew up, while eating, lying down, in
his dreams, while he was awake, at all times, he would meditate on that
form.

Later on, when his father and uncles renounced their family life in order to
be with Mahaprabhu, the only child, Sri Jiva, was left with his mother in
the family palace at Fateyabad. Lying in her lap, which was wet with tears
of separation, he gradually began to grow as the waxing moon. Seeing that
the mother and the child's face were always wet with tears, their friends
also fell under the shadow of sadness and only with great difficulty managed
to assuage their grief. Whenever Sri Jiva would remember his father and
uncles, or the lotus feet of Sri Gaura Hari, he would lose consiousness and
fall to the ground.

As he got a little older, Sri Jiva took up the worship of the Deities of
Sri-Sri Rama-Krsna. He would carefully decorate Them and offer bhoga and
aroti, serving Them with his full attention. Even in his play, whatever
games he played were connected with Sri Krsna's pastimes. While studying
under the local panditas he became proficent in grammar, poetry and
rhetoric. Noting his great intellect, his teachers commented, &quot;Such
brilliance is not often found in a child so young as this. No doubt he will
be a very high-souled, saintly person.&quot;

Even while engaged in his studies Jiva always thought of Sri Sri
Nitai-Gauranga. Once he saw in a dream that Sri Rama-Krsna had taken the
forms of Nitai-Gauranga and were dancing. [B.R.1.732] Giving him the dust of
Their lotus feet, the Two Lords then disappeared. Having seen such a
wonderful dream, Sri Jiva was consoled somewhat. Then he began to think,
&quot;When will I be able to crawl out of this well of family life and devote my
full time and energy, my very self, to serving these two most magnanimous
Lords?&quot; But he was the only son of the family. Only in his company could his
mother forget somewhat the pangs of separation in her heart. When Sri Jiva
learned that his father had given up his life on the banks of the Ganga, he
was compeletely unsettled. After that his eyes were never dry. The family
members and friends tried to console him but to little avail. Family life
had become the source of his utter sadness.

Someone suggested to Jiva to go to Navadwipa and bathe himself in the
coolness emanating from the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda Prabhu so that his
mind and body, burning with with grief, could be refreshed. Thus Sri Jiva
set our for Navadwipa with a group of pilgrims. [Bhakti Ratnakara 1/741]

Nityananda Prabhu, the omniscient Lord, could understand that Sri Jiva was
on his way to Navadwipa. Therefore He also left for there from Khardaha.
After a few days, Jiva arrived at Navadwipa. Seeing the beauty of that place
he was charmed. Falling down on the ground, he offered his dandavats to
Mother Ganges. Inquiring from the villagers the directions to Mayapura, he
learned that Nityananda Prabhu was residing at Srivasa Pandita's house. At
last arriving there, he fell down at the door to offer his dandavats.
Nityananda Prabhu came out with Srivasa Pandita and picked him up and
embraced him, asking, &quot;Are you the nephew of Sri Rupa and Sri Sanatana?&quot;

As an answer, Jiva again fell down on the ground at the lotus feet of
Nityananda Prabhu. This time Nityananda Prabhu brought him in the house and
began to inquire after the welfare of his family at Fateyabad. Then Sri Jiva
was introduced to the devotees present in Navadwipa; he offered his
salutations at their lotus feet. Everyone was very happy to meet the nephew
of Sri Rupa and Sanatana. That day Sri Jiva received the remnants of
Nityananda Prabhu's prasadam.

The next day, the two of them came to Saci Mata'a house. Seeing the
birthplace of Sri Gaurasundara, which was filled with such splendor, Sri
Jiva was greatly pacified and fell down on the ground to roll in the dust.
In the large courtyard the devotees were singing songs praising the glories
of Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Seeing Nityananda Prabhu, everyone stood
up and then fell down, offering their dandavats at His lotus feet. Then Jiva
saw Saci Mata sitting on the veranda.

Dressed in white with silk chadder around her shoulders she looked radiant,
the white of her hair blending with her white sari. Though her body trembled
with old age and was very thin, still the courtyard was illuminated by her
divine effulgence. Forgetting herself in remembrance of Sri Gaurasundara,
she was sitting with her eyes closed. Becoming aware that Nityananda Prabhu
had arrived, she covered her head with her sari and called her servant.
&quot;Isana! Sripada has arrived. Please wash His feet.&quot;

After this was done, Nityananda offered namaskar to the mother of the
Supreme Lord and took His seat. He then introduced Sri Jiva to her. Saci
Mata placed her hand on his head to bless him, and Sri Jiva floated in the
ocean of happiness. Saci Mata then requested the two of them to honor the
Lord's prasada. &quot;Take prasada here at your mother's house today, my
children. I offered there preparations in secret to Sri Gauracandra.&quot;

Sri Jiva spent some days with Nityananda Prabhu, touring the nine islands of
Navadwipa, in order to have darsana of the holy places of the Lord's
pastimes there. Then, as ordered by Nityananda Prabhu, he set out for Kasi
(Varanasi). At Kasi he studied Vedanta under Sri Madhusudana Vacaspati, a
disciple of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya. The conclusions of Vedanta contained in
Srimad-Bhagavatam that were expounded by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to
Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya in Puri had been in turn taught by the Bhattacarya
to Madhusudana Vacaspati, who established a tol at Kasi. From him, Sri Jiva
mastered the same conclusions.

From here Sri Jiva set out for Sri Vrindavana where he received shelter at
the lotus feet of his two uncles, Sri Rupa and Sanatana. They were very
pleased to see him and received from him all the news. Jiva stayed with Sri
Rupa, who began to teach him Srimad-Bhagavatam. After initiating him with
the divine mantra, Rupa engaged him in the service of Sri Sri
Radha-Damodara. According to Sadhana-dipika, this Deity of Damodara was
fashioned by Rupa Gosvami's own hand for his dear disciple Sri Jiva. Sri Sri
Radha-Damodara are presently being worshipped in Jaipur, Rajasthan.

Seeing that Jiva had quickly become conversant with the conclusion of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Rupa engaged him in proofreading his
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. At this time Sri Jiva compiled a commentary on
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu called Durgama-sangamani. In the year 1476 (Sakabda)
Sri Sanatana Gosvami compiled Sri Vaisnava-tosani, a commentary on the tenth
canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, which he gave to Sri Jiva for proofreading.
Under the order of Sri Sanatana, Sri Jiva compiled a commentary on that,
named Laghu Vaisnava-tosani, in the year 1500 (Sakabda). His writings, along
with those of Sri Rupa and Sri Sanatana, Sri Gopal Bhatta, Sri Raghunatha
Bhatta, Sri Raghunath das, Sri Krsna das, Sri Kasisvar Pandit, and Sri Madhu
Pandit, completely captivated the learned men of that time. It was the
beginning of a golden age at Sri Vraja-dhama.

Sri Jiva regularly brought water for Sri Rupa and Sanatana's
bath.Hemassaged their heads with oil, cleaned their ashram, worship
the Deity,
cooked and corrected manuscripts.

After the disappearance of Sri Rupa and Sanatana, Sri Jiva continued the
tradition that they had inaugurated. Once Sri Jiva travelled to Agra to
debate with the Rajputs concerning the glories of Jamuna and Ganga rivers.
He established that the Jamuna is more glorious than the Ganga as the Ganga
emananates from Krsna's lotus feet whereas the Jamuna is His own consort. At
this the Moghul emperor was very much satisfied and wanted to present him
something. Sri Jiva replied that he would accept some blank papers. So the
emperor presented Jiva some stained paper. (At that time paper was very rare
and most manuscripts were usually composed on leaves.)

There is also a legend that once, when a Moghul emperor (possibly Akbar)
wanted to confer something on the Gosvamis of Vrindavana, they requested a
ferman (emperor's order) that no living beings would be killed within Vraja.
As a result of this no king would come to hunt there anymore. The disciple
of Lokanatha Gosvami, Narottama dasa Thakura Mahasaya, Sri Gopala Bhatta
Gosvami's disciple Srinivasa Acarya Prabhu, and the disciple of Hrdaya
Caitanya Prabhu, Sri Syamananda Prabhu, were greatly favored by Srila Jiva
Goswami. Under his tutelage they studied all the literatures of the
Gosvamis. Later he sent them to preach this knowledge in Bengal. Srila Jiva
Gosvami composed many literatures, amongst them:
