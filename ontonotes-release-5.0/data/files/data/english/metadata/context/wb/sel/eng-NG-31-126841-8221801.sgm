The Usual Suspects
by _P.M. Carpenter_ ( http://www.smirkingchimp.com/user/p_m_carpenter )  | Aug

According to numerous New York Times/ABC News polls, roughly one in three
Americans, time and again, say &quot;the war in Iraq is going well.&quot; Not only that,
these same folks &quot;say things in the United States are generally going well
right  now, putting them at odds with the views of seven in ten Americans, who
say the  country has veered off on the wrong track.&quot;
It should come as no surprise that these plucky few, the bizarrely
optimistic, &quot;are solidly supportive of President Bush and overwhelmingly  Republican.&quot;
_As the  Times piece from which I drew these statistics noted_
( http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/09/us/politics/09web-elder.html ) , &quot;Who they are is the  easy
part.&quot; It then posited, however, &quot;Why they think what they do is
considerably more complicated.&quot;
No, it's not.
These imbeciles were raised by wolves. Which is to say, they were deprived of
loving human contact as little ones (linguist George Lakoff remains the
keenest  resource on this: see his Moral Politics), and now the wolf-rearing
philosophy  of every wolf pack for itself is their normative course in life. So
naturally  they're drawn to the &quot;We're-all-in-this-alone&quot; Republican Party and
its top  snarling dog, George W. Bush. The man simply can do no wrong in their
eyes.
The Times story put me in mind of _an article I wrote for  TomPaine.com back
in April 2000_ ( http://tompaine.com/Archive/scontent/3023.html ) , titled &quot;A
New Theory of American Politics:  One Out of Three of Us Can Usually Be Counted
on to Be Negative.&quot; You will note  the year -- 2000 -- which is important. A
Democrat, you see, happened to occupy  the White House at the time, so all was
gloom and doom for this peculiar  minority of one-third. The same people who
today see nothing but roses popping  out of George W.'s ass -- notwithstanding
his seven years of unremitting fiscal  and foreign disasters -- then believed
that Bill Clinton's eight years of peace  and prosperity were an unbearable
burden on the Republic.
Today they're the indefatigably sanguine. Yesterday they were the
indefatigably morose. The party label slapped on the White House was, and is,  the only
discernible variable.
They -- this once crotchety, now untroubled Third -- didn't even wait for
Clinton's first term to really get underway. They knew beforehand how bad things
would be; indeed, how bad things already were: &quot;31 percent of Americans ...
said  on February 14, 1993 -- just twenty-four days after Bill Clinton took
office --  that they disapproved of the way the president was doing his job,&quot;
recalled my  TomPaine piece. &quot;Bill barely had time to get the height adjusted on
his swivel  chair and one out of three Americans already despised his track
record.&quot;
If you'd like an even better read into the mind of this lupine Third of
Americans, here are a couple more stats -- again, from the TomPaine piece: &quot;32
percent believed the government 'will go too far' in making homosexuality
acceptable (acceptable to whom is unclear) and that the National Rifle  Association
had the 'right amount of influence' over gun control laws....&quot;
Want more? &quot;Employing dubious means of critical analysis, 36 percent said the
federal government should reduce its investment in school districts that
fare  poorly in standardized tests, while 28 percent with even more dubious
humanity  said the feds had no responsibility in alleviating poverty.&quot;
Hell, even wolves of the four-legged variety aren't that heartless.
I have no doubt that Susan Brand of Burnsville, Minnesota, was one of the
crotchety Third in 1998. But today? &quot;I just think George W. Bush is doing a good
job with Iraq and everything else,&quot; Ms. Brand told the Times. &quot;He’s a
straight  up Republican. He says things are going well there.&quot;
And that's that. Mind closed, case closed.
The Times story proceeded to a limited exploration of the psycho-politically
occult, reporting that &quot;cognitive dissonance is playing out for some people
in  favor of Mr. Bush.&quot; Explained a UC-San Diego professor who specializes in
political delusion: &quot;As long as he projects optimism, they are willing to
dismiss the mainstream media as biased.&quot;
Cognitive dissonance? I'd call it cognitive shutdown. Yet there's nothing to
be done for folks of this breed -- except maybe zap them back to the future,
and  this time raise them among loving, caring, rational and empathetic
humans.

Pay attention to what the rightwingers claim we are doing, because  that's
exactly what they are up to. - Randi  Rhodes
