Microsoft may be Apple¹s 800-pound gorilla, but Apple¹s got something
Microsoft will never have: fanatical loyalty. So, in this battle for the
hearts and minds of computer users everywhere, who¹s got the edge? The
smart money¹s on Apple, writes CIOUpdate columnist Richard Martin Alcera
Consulting.

³Oh wow! Mom. Dad. You got us an iMac. Coooool! And we¹ve been asking
for one for soooo long.² (sub-text: Š even though we¹ve had a PC for
years now.)

³I¹ve been thinking of getting a Mac, but we¹ve got Windows at work so I
don¹t really think I have much of a choice. I¹ll have to get a PC.²
(sub-text: Š even though I really, really want a Mac!)

These two imaginary quotes encapsulate the differences between Apple and
Microsoft. Let¹s face it. The Apple commercials showed us that PC guy is
a nerd, but that Apple guy is just too cool to be walking on earth. The
Apple commercials showed us jiggling dancing girls and boys in
silhouette living the high-life with their way cool iPods. Microsoft
gets four-color full-page spreads in Fortune and Business Week to tell
us that they have ³solutions², whatever those nerdy things are.
Let¹s face it. Apple is cooler than Microsoft. That, I believe, explains
the successful yet highly divergent paths both companies have taken,
basically since their inception back in the smoke-filled days of the
late seventies. But now that both have achieved dominance in their
respective niches, it may be time to examine both business models a
little more closely.

In the Long Run

It is my contention that Apple is setting itself up for long-term
success and even that rarest of things, corporate longevity. In short, I
believe that Apple‹with due regard to the authors of Built to Last,
James Collins and Jerry Porras‹just may be ³built to last.² Microsoft,
on the other hand, has many characteristics which leave it vulnerable to
attacks and threats from all sides. Don¹t get me wrong, I have nothing
against Microsoft and I just can¹t get all the fuss about the Mac, but a
dispassionate look at the business models and strategies has much to
reveal about their differing potentials for success over the long term.
What really sets Apple and Microsoft apart? Is it the quality or type of
technology? Is it the marketing and hype? Is it business strategy? The
answer is none of the above. What sets these two giants apart is nothing
other than customer experience.

Apple is the ultimate brand machine. Not just in computers, but also in
iPods, which are just cute looking MP3 players, and now mobile
phones/PDAs. Because that¹s what an iPhone is after all. It¹s a phone.
Remember? It¹s not a phaser that you can set to stun and you can¹t call
Scotty to beam you up.

What are people buying when they buy an Apple device? Is it quality? Is
it technology? Is it ease of use? Most people would say all of these.
However, I believe the real thing they are buying is fun and coolness.
They are indulging their true nature, which is to be creative; wildly
and unboundedly creative, creativity untempered by the boring exigencies
of work and daily drudgery.

Even the corporate logo instantiates this idea of indulging one¹s
passions. What is the Apple other than the fruit of the Tree of
Knowledge? When you take a bite out of the Apple, you enter the Garden
of Eden, where work is play and pain is pleasure. The bitten apple is
what the French call un péché mignon, a little sinful treat.

Apple vs. Microsoft

So. You¹re Apple¹s competition. How do you compete against that? Do you
tell customers your computer is more stable (which it probably isn¹t)?
Do you tell them your device is sleeker and more modern looking (hey,
Apple¹s is made in a hollowed aluminum casing lovingly carved by a laser
beam)?

The truth is that Apple has a strong brand, probably the strongest one
in the entire technology field. Moreover, because Apple doesn¹t strive
to be everything to everyone, it can afford to position itself in such a
way as to make its market dominance essentially unassailable. Whenever a
company achieves such brand recognition, it has to work extremely hard
to screw itself up. Even then, die-hard fans will fight for the brand
more than the company.

Does anyone remember the New Coke? Who got Coca Cola to reintroduce the
good old Classic Coke? Answer: All of the millions of die hard Coke
drinkers. Thus, Coca Cola¹s brand is so strong, and its following so
loyal‹dare I say fanatical?‹that it continues to be successful despite
itself. It¹s the customers that have saved, and continue to save, Coca
Cola as a business entity.

I believe Apple is on the cusp of that same level of branding, if it
hasn¹t already achieved it. Simply put, Apple could probably make a lot
of marketing mistakes and screw itself up silly, and it will still be
around in a hundred years.

Now what about Microsoft?

There are Anything But Windows (ABW) movements. There is plenty of
state-sponsored litigation against it. There is plenty of private
litigation against it. I¹m sure someone will cite me an example of
litigation somewhere against Apple or of a satanic cabal of Mac haters
in Iowa, but the reality is that people love to hate Microsoft.
People also love to doubt Bill Gates¹ sincerity in his transformation
from IT robber-baron who eats baby computer manufacturers for breakfast
to a modern-day reincarnation of Andrew Carnegie. As for Steve Jobs,
people just view him as a brilliant, if quirky, CEO.

I know this is going to sound like heresy, but I will say it anyway.
Microsoft has a weak brand image. In some quarters, it even has a
negative brand image. There, I said it. Sure, there are niches where
Microsoft does reign close to supreme. The Xbox is one product that
comes to mind. But in most cases, the fact that people are working on
systems that are running on Microsoft guts goes a thousand miles over
their heads. And so it should.

Users don¹t feel any particular attachment to the Microsoft software
they use. Many of them feel it is forced on them and dream of a more
convivial workstation. Personally, I don¹t see that much of a difference
between the two computing paradigms, at least in terms of ergonomics,
but I¹m a nerd after all.

Many of the Microsoft ³solutions² corporate speak for database apps and
other such industrial software are competing against IBM¹s, SAP¹s,
Peoplesoft¹s, etc. Microsoft may be a big player, perhaps even the
biggest player in some niches, but there is competition. Moreover, that
competition can convince corporate buyers that their own products are
more cost-effective and consequently a better investment than
Microsoft¹s. That kind of calculus is rare if simply non-existent in
Apple¹s chosen niches. In fact, Apple studiously avoids rational sales
pitches and focuses instead on the emotional attachment to its products.
We live in a long-tail world, to use Chris Anderson¹s phrase. Apple
certainly isn¹t invulnerable to an upstart device maker from way down in
the tail. However, it at least has some very strong defenses in the form
of strong emotional attachment on the part of users and customers and a
consumer-oriented business model that seeks to please people as people,
and not as workers.

Microsoft, on the other hand, is extremely vulnerable to competitive
pressures by any number of upstart device or software producers. When
combined with the potential subversiveness of many movements out in the
long tail, there is no telling where the attack could come from. It
could be a full-scale onslaught by IBM or SAP (or how about GE?). But
most likely it will be an unforeseen, and unforeseeable, technology or
business model that will strike out of nowhere, stealthily and in the
night, like a guerrilla warrior. Or it could be the Googles of the world
morphing and adapting quicker, like the blob that ate the mid-Western
town in the B movie.

Microsoft has attained its current dominance because it muscled itself
into the marketplace and fought all comers. Simply put, Microsoft nuked
itself into its current position. But no one wants the nukes anymore. It
has to use stealth bombs and hearts and minds warfare. Can it change
itself into a kinder gentler monolith?

My money is on Apple, because it acts like a long-tail company, despite
its growing size and niche dominance. But who knows what lurks out there
in the night, ready to pounce on Microsoft and to offer its customers
superior value for less money, quicker, and with much less hassle?

Microsoft isn't as founder-centric as Apple is, Bill's focus has been
gradually shifting to various philanthropic activities he involves.
Microsoft is not the king of computing any more, but she is doing
pretty good. On the other hands, look at what shithole Apple has sunk
into since Jobs left in the 80s, and Apple only managed to magically
pull herself away from the brink of bankruptcy after the return of
Jobs.So if somehow Jobs died in a car accident tomorrow or of natural
causes 30 years from now, chances are Apple will lose the magic touch
that keeps its fans so fanatic. While Microsoft will likely gradually
grow into a bigger but less important technological company, its
chance of surviving next 5 decades are much better than that of Apple.

while true, Bill is seen as the primary figurehead of MS, so it will be
interesting to see what happens next summer when he officially steps
down.

Apple did quite well up until the early 90's. 1992? or so. It grew huge
in size, created plenty of innovations people still use today, but when
Spindler stepped in from Germany, things went to hell slowly. When
Windows95 hit, that's when Apple made some critical mistakes and things
went bad for about 4 years.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Apple was never close to bankruptcy, that was an urban myth. Apple's
problem was it was at risk of becoming a much smaller company. Apple had
$1.1 billion in cash in the bank and little debt on the darkest day of
their history, but dropping from $11 billion in revenue to $6-7 billion,
which did happen. Now Apple is 52% the size of Microsoft and about half
the value. So all this has happened in about 10 years, so another 5 and
they should be the same size as MS and equal in value.

I'd agree with that, but so will the entire PC industry. the whole thing
is geared to where Steve takes everyone next. MS nor Apple can move much
more if he went out of the picture. But by that time, the industry will
be tapped out like Cars are today. Basically when an industry grows it
prospers on a vision based on hard work and new ideas / new tech. But
once the founders like Ford or Akio Morita of SONY die off, the company
dies as well. Steve probably has a good 30 years left, 20 of it very
active, so we basically have about 2 more decades of innovation then
this industry will stagnate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, MS's achilles heel is it only makes software, and is tied at the
hip to the dying IBM fortunes, (and a bunch of money loosing hardware
like the Xbox, Zune, etc) But Apple is the only one that makes great
hardware and great software, plus they have the vote of the &quot;youth
market&quot; since it's a much younger thinking company than MS.

I think both will be around in 5 decades, that's really not that far
from now. But MS will be a fraction of the size of Apple unless
something really turns around MS from their management decline of the
last decade. They just can't seem to come out with any successful
products, where pretty much whatever Apple does becomes a worldwide
phenomenon.

We'll see.

I'm not sure about that- I don't think we've seen enough of a Gates-less

Agreed.  The problem with consumerism as religion is that it needs a deity,

and Apple's is Jobs.

Perhaps.  An equally large problem for Apple is that &quot;cool&quot; rarely lasts
longer than a generation.  One generation's &quot;cool&quot; is the next
generation's &quot;lame.&quot;  Much of the current Apple fandom are the same
people who grew up with Apple IIs.  Like Steve Jobs himself, they'll die
eventually too, and their decendents might not have the same fanatical
devotion.

A generation or two ago, Sears was a retail goliath that has become quite
neutered in the last few decades.  Even the New Coke/Coke Classic debacle-
turned-accidental brilliant strategy was a desparate move to regain
market share lost to Pepsi, &quot;the choice for a new generation.&quot;  Consumers
are a fickle lot, and new corporate regimes can p*ss away a company's
reputation and goodwill quickly.

I've never understood the Apple vs. Microsoft comparison anyway- one is
hardware manufacturer who uses software as a value-add, and the other is
a software maker.  If Apple sold a version of OS X for 3rd-party
hardware, I'd get the comparison, but comparing Apple to MS is
like comparing Ford to Goodyear.

Let's treat this, before we get into his evidence:

Apple's users may be VERY happy with their products, but consumers are
notoriously fickle. They can change their minds even if Apple never
makes any mistakes -- because some perceive (as in the music players) a
fashion statement to be made, or a group to belong to.

Microsoft's biggest fans are conservative IT bag-men who live their
lives and jobs keeping the status quo. There seems to be a consensus
that they enjoy many benefits from keeping job security, and thus will
make sure Microsoft stays in place wherever they perceive a job to be
had -- because it is so bad (or so technical) it requires their
technical support.

Consider, too, that business may never be willing to consider
alternatives if evidence is subjective (like user happiness), complex
(like costs or maintenance) or hard to quantify (like mental state of
the user while trying to focus on complex tasks).

Which of these support systems are more reliable?

I have never thought Jobs led the market nearly as much as that.
He's an important leader at Apple not just because of innovation (which
usually doesn't come from him) but of focus and motivation, where he
has some very specific and important guidance concepts.

Thus, if someone understood and continued to follow in some significant
way Jobs' methods and concepts, Apple may grow very well even without
Jobs. (The character and personality issues are harder to quantify,
especially since I've never worked in Cupertino.)

The computer industry is much _less_ guided by Jobs or Apple. They take
some of the successful ideas and prompts from Apple, but much less than
is actually developed and less than is actually worth taking. That's
been true from many other companies, too. Apple hasn't been the only
leader in the computing industry, they are just an easy and
recognizable one, and one that eventually puts the better ideas into
their products (even if they weren't original to Apple!).
What I mean is that the industry owes the innovators, and is guided by
innovations. Even though products from Apple may include many of those
innovations, the true sources don't always rely on Jobs as leader.

Wrong question. The same thing will kill both MS and Apple: Walmart.

Look at Walmart's $200 PC. It sold out to raves. Yeah, there will
always be a niche market for PCs, just like there's a niche market for
LPs and slide rules and gas refigerators. However, in the mass market,
price trumps, and the combination of FOSS with commodity chips, the
Walmart of the PC industry, will do the same thing that bricks and
morter Walmart did to Main Street -- put it out of business.

On the other end, mainframes and high end servers, neither MS nor
Apple can compete with the traditional players, not that Apple ever
wanted to.

But the problem with that analogy is that Apple's fans aren't fans
because of a religious attachment.
They are fans because they appreciate the products Apple makes.
Ask them -- people will respond by talking about the product they own,
not the person who led the company creating it, and usually not the
company in broad terms at all.
Even people who aren't very analytical will talk happily in broad terms
about how the device is 'just too good' or 'so cute' or 'fun' or
'really cool.' This isn't because there isn't anything there to make
them happy, I think it is because many people aren't good at describing
the why or how about their product happiness.

Very true -- but Apple has been changing it's products very quickly in
that regard. Look at the changes in iMac models -- you may get almost

Well, you're writing about how their method is different. They are
still competing for the same buyers and developers, since their
products guide their entire segment of the same industry.
Microsoft effectively determines what goes into the hardware, and what
is already provided to developers to work within. Apple does the same
even more.

saying businesses are locked into ms and not willing to consider

they make, so you say they they don't consider alternatives.

good point ed, around a similar time the had something like $1.3 billion
in unsold inventory, so basically that was a wash. once steve got

yes, but MS will rack up another $1 billion in losses for the XBox
division this year, it's currently at $4 billion gone from this one
product alone. Not that MS can't afford to give them away to keep kids

&gt; ³Oh wow! Mom. Dad. You got us an iMac. Coooool! And we¹ve been asking

&gt; These two imaginary quotes encapsulate the differences between Apple and
&gt; Microsoft. Let¹s face it. The Apple commercials showed us that PC guy is
&gt; a nerd, but that Apple guy is just too cool to be walking on earth. The
&gt; Apple commercials showed us jiggling dancing girls and boys in
&gt; silhouette living the high-life with their way cool iPods. Microsoft
&gt; gets four-color full-page spreads in Fortune and Business Week to tell
&gt; us that they have ³solutions², whatever those nerdy things are.
&gt; Let¹s face it. Apple is cooler than Microsoft. That, I believe, explains
&gt; the successful yet highly divergent paths both companies have taken,
&gt; basically since their inception back in the smoke-filled days of the
&gt; late seventies. But now that both have achieved dominance in their
&gt; respective niches, it may be time to examine both business models a
&gt; little more closely.

&gt; In the Long Run

&gt; It is my contention that Apple is setting itself up for long-term
&gt; success and even that rarest of things, corporate longevity. In short, I
&gt; believe that Apple‹with due regard to the authors of Built to Last,
&gt; James Collins and Jerry Porras‹just may be ³built to last.² Microsoft,
&gt; on the other hand, has many characteristics which leave it vulnerable to
&gt; attacks and threats from all sides. Don¹t get me wrong, I have nothing
&gt; against Microsoft and I just can¹t get all the fuss about the Mac, but a
&gt; dispassionate look at the business models and strategies has much to
&gt; reveal about their differing potentials for success over the long term.
&gt; What really sets Apple and Microsoft apart? Is it the quality or type of
&gt; technology? Is it the marketing and hype? Is it business strategy? The
&gt; answer is none of the above. What sets these two giants apart is nothing
&gt; other than customer experience.

&gt; Apple is the ultimate brand machine. Not just in computers, but also in
&gt; iPods, which are just cute looking MP3 players, and now mobile
&gt; phones/PDAs. Because that¹s what an iPhone is after all. It¹s a phone.
&gt; Remember? It¹s not a phaser that you can set to stun and you can¹t call
&gt; Scotty to beam you up.

&gt; What are people buying when they buy an Apple device? Is it quality? Is
&gt; it technology? Is it ease of use? Most people would say all of these.
&gt; However, I believe the real thing they are buying is fun and coolness.
&gt; They are indulging their true nature, which is to be creative; wildly
&gt; and unboundedly creative, creativity untempered by the boring exigencies
&gt; of work and daily drudgery.

&gt; Even the corporate logo instantiates this idea of indulging one¹s
&gt; passions. What is the Apple other than the fruit of the Tree of
&gt; Knowledge? When you take a bite out of the Apple, you enter the Garden
&gt; of Eden, where work is play and pain is pleasure. The bitten apple is
&gt; what the French call un péché mignon, a little sinful treat.

&gt; Apple vs. Microsoft

&gt; So. You¹re Apple¹s competition. How do you compete against that? Do you
&gt; tell customers your computer is more stable (which it probably isn¹t)?
&gt; Do you tell them your device is sleeker and more modern looking (hey,
&gt; Apple¹s is made in a hollowed aluminum casing lovingly carved by a laser
&gt; beam)?

&gt; The truth is that Apple has a strong brand, probably the strongest one
&gt; in the entire technology field. Moreover, because Apple doesn¹t strive
&gt; to be everything to everyone, it can afford to position itself in such a
&gt; way as to make its market dominance essentially unassailable. Whenever a
&gt; company achieves such brand recognition, it has to work extremely hard
&gt; to screw itself up. Even then, die-hard fans will fight for the brand
&gt; more than the company.

&gt; Does anyone remember the New Coke? Who got Coca Cola to reintroduce the
&gt; good old Classic Coke? Answer: All of the millions of die hard Coke
&gt; drinkers. Thus, Coca Cola¹s brand is so strong, and its following so
&gt; loyal‹dare I say fanatical?‹that it continues to be successful despite
&gt; itself. It¹s the customers that have saved, and continue to save, Coca
&gt; Cola as a business entity.

&gt; I believe Apple is on the cusp of that same level of branding, if it
&gt; hasn¹t already achieved it. Simply put, Apple could probably make a lot
&gt; of marketing mistakes and screw itself up silly, and it will still be
&gt; around in a hundred years.

&gt; Now what about Microsoft?

&gt; There are Anything But Windows (ABW) movements. There is plenty of
&gt; state-sponsored litigation against it. There is plenty of private
&gt; litigation against it. I¹m sure someone will cite me an example of
&gt; litigation somewhere against Apple or of a satanic cabal of Mac haters
&gt; in Iowa, but the reality is that people love to hate Microsoft.
&gt; People also love to doubt Bill Gates¹ sincerity in his transformation
&gt; from IT robber-baron who eats baby computer manufacturers for breakfast
&gt; to a modern-day reincarnation of Andrew Carnegie. As for Steve Jobs,
&gt; people just view him as a brilliant, if quirky, CEO.

&gt; I know this is going to sound like heresy, but I will say it anyway.
&gt; Microsoft has a weak brand image. In some quarters, it even has a
&gt; negative brand image. There, I said it. Sure, there are niches where
&gt; Microsoft does reign close to supreme. The Xbox is one product that
&gt; comes to mind. But in most cases, the fact that people are working on
&gt; systems that are running on Microsoft guts goes a thousand miles over
&gt; their heads. And so it should.

&gt; Users don¹t feel any particular attachment to the Microsoft software
&gt; they use. Many of them feel it is forced on them and dream of a more
&gt; convivial workstation. Personally, I don¹t see that much of a difference
&gt; between the two computing paradigms, at least in terms of ergonomics,
&gt; but I¹m a nerd after all.

&gt; Many of the Microsoft ³solutions² corporate speak for database apps and
&gt; other such industrial software are competing against IBM¹s, SAP¹s,
&gt; Peoplesoft¹s, etc. Microsoft may be a big player, perhaps even the
&gt; biggest player in some niches, but there is competition. Moreover, that
&gt; competition can convince corporate buyers that their own products are
&gt; more cost-effective and consequently a better investment than
&gt; Microsoft¹s. That kind of calculus is rare if simply non-existent in
&gt; Apple¹s chosen niches. In fact, Apple studiously avoids rational sales
&gt; pitches and focuses instead on the emotional attachment to its products.
&gt; We live in a long-tail world, to use Chris Anderson¹s phrase. Apple
&gt; certainly isn¹t invulnerable to an upstart device maker from way down in
&gt; the tail. However, it at least has some very strong defenses in the form
&gt; of strong emotional attachment on the part of users and customers and a
&gt; consumer-oriented business model that seeks to please people as people,
&gt; and not as workers.

&gt; Microsoft, on the other hand, is extremely vulnerable to competitive
&gt; pressures by any number of upstart device or software producers. When
&gt; combined with the potential subversiveness of many movements out in the
&gt; long tail, there is no telling where the attack could come from. It
&gt; could be a full-scale onslaught by IBM or SAP (or how about GE?). But
&gt; most likely it will be an unforeseen, and unforeseeable, technology or
&gt; business model that will strike out of nowhere, stealthily and in the
&gt; night, like a guerrilla warrior. Or it could be the Googles of the world
&gt; morphing and adapting quicker, like the blob that ate the mid-Western
&gt; town in the B movie.

&gt; Microsoft has attained its current dominance because it muscled itself
&gt; into the marketplace and fought all comers. Simply put, Microsoft nuked
&gt; itself into its current position. But no one wants the nukes anymore. It
&gt; has to use stealth bombs and hearts and minds warfare. Can it change
&gt; itself into a kinder gentler monolith?

&gt; My money is on Apple, because it acts like a long-tail company, despite
&gt; its growing size and niche dominance. But who knows what lurks out there
&gt; in the night, ready to pounce on Microsoft and to offer its customers
&gt; superior value for less money, quicker, and with much less hassle?

&gt; &gt; be tapped out like Cars are today. Basically when an industry grows it

&gt; He's an important leader at Apple not just because of innovation (which
&gt; usually doesn't come from him) but of focus and motivation, where he
&gt; has some very specific and important guidance concepts.

&gt; Thus, if someone understood and continued to follow in some significant
&gt; way Jobs' methods and concepts, Apple may grow very well even without
&gt; Jobs. (The character and personality issues are harder to quantify,
&gt; especially since I've never worked in Cupertino.)

&gt; The computer industry is much _less_ guided by Jobs or Apple.

What? the last 31 years is almost a complete Mirror of what Jobs has
decided. He put PC's on the map and promoted the shift from mainframes
to individual machines on a desk, he was the first to promote floppy
drives in both 5.25 and 3.5 formats, first to use laser printers, first
to have a machine with fonts, (except some xerox prototypes) first to
use modems extensively, first machine with a spreadsheet, first with at
GUI, first PC with a mouse, first to use recordable optical-drives,
first to use the Internet in a major way, first to use USB &amp; Firewire on
a mass scale, first to define WiFi, first to use Bluetooth as a
standard, first to define a new, easy way of distributing of music.
First with multi-touch, first cell phone with a real browser, etc.

The PC Industry IS 96.4% Steve Jobs's vision, nobody else's. Bill Gates
has always been Steve's puppet if you think about it clearly enough. MS,
IBM basically didn't do a thing after 1976 that has made an impact on
society. They copied Apple at every turn.

&gt; recognizable one, and one that eventually puts the better ideas into
&gt; their products (even if they weren't original to Apple!).

Sure, but only Apple's implementations STUCK. If it weren't for Jobs,
there would be no PC, there would be no GUI, there would be no Web.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What I mean is that the industry owes the innovators, and is guided by

Yes, and I FULLY agree that Jobs has always been the master of taking
very rough research ideas and finally making them into a salable
product. But plenty of research would have died on the research bench if
it wasn't for Jobs to refine them to such a degree that they could be
used by &quot;people&quot;.

Bill Gates has done nothing over the last 30 years but copy Jobs in
painful ways and foist them on consumers under the guise of IBM
&quot;compatibility&quot;.

Nobody will remember BG in 150 years, SJ will be the one everyone looks
back on and says, yes, he is the one that created what we now use today.

&gt; &gt; So. You¹re Apple¹s competition. How do you compete against that? Do you
&gt; &gt; tell customers your computer is more stable (which it probably isn¹t)?
&gt; &gt; Do you tell them your device is sleeker and more modern looking (hey,
&gt; &gt; Apple¹s is made in a hollowed aluminum casing lovingly carved by a laser
&gt; &gt; beam)?

&gt; &gt; The truth is that Apple has a strong brand, probably the strongest one
&gt; &gt; in the entire technology field. Moreover, because Apple doesn¹t strive
&gt; &gt; to be everything to everyone, it can afford to position itself in such a
&gt; &gt; way as to make its market dominance essentially unassailable. Whenever a
&gt; &gt; company achieves such brand recognition, it has to work extremely hard
&gt; &gt; to screw itself up. Even then, die-hard fans will fight for the brand
&gt; &gt; more than the company.

&gt; &gt; Does anyone remember the New Coke? Who got Coca Cola to reintroduce the
&gt; &gt; good old Classic Coke? Answer: All of the millions of die hard Coke
&gt; &gt; drinkers. Thus, Coca Cola¹s brand is so strong, and its following so
&gt; &gt; loyal‹dare I say fanatical?‹that it continues to be successful despite
&gt; &gt; itself. It¹s the customers that have saved, and continue to save, Coca
&gt; &gt; Cola as a business entity.

&gt; &gt; I believe Apple is on the cusp of that same level of branding, if it
&gt; &gt; hasn¹t already achieved it. Simply put, Apple could probably make a lot
&gt; &gt; of marketing mistakes and screw itself up silly, and it will still be
&gt; &gt; around in a hundred years.

&gt; &gt; Now what about Microsoft?

&gt; &gt; There are Anything But Windows (ABW) movements. There is plenty of
&gt; &gt; state-sponsored litigation against it. There is plenty of private
&gt; &gt; litigation against it. I¹m sure someone will cite me an example of
&gt; &gt; litigation somewhere against Apple or of a satanic cabal of Mac haters
&gt; &gt; in Iowa, but the reality is that people love to hate Microsoft.
&gt; &gt; People also love to doubt Bill Gates¹ sincerity in his transformation
&gt; &gt; from IT robber-baron who eats baby computer manufacturers for breakfast
&gt; &gt; to a modern-day reincarnation of Andrew Carnegie. As for Steve Jobs,
&gt; &gt; people just view him as a brilliant, if quirky, CEO.

&gt; &gt; I know this is going to sound like heresy, but I will say it anyway.
&gt; &gt; Microsoft has a weak brand image. In some quarters, it even has a
&gt; &gt; negative brand image. There, I said it. Sure, there are niches where
&gt; &gt; Microsoft does reign close to supreme. The Xbox is one product that
&gt; &gt; comes to mind. But in most cases, the fact that people are working on
&gt; &gt; systems that are running on Microsoft guts goes a thousand miles over
&gt; &gt; their heads. And so it should.

&gt; &gt; Users don¹t feel any particular attachment to the Microsoft software
&gt; &gt; they use. Many of them feel it is forced on them and dream of a more
&gt; &gt; convivial workstation. Personally, I don¹t see that much of a difference
&gt; &gt; between the two computing paradigms, at least in terms of ergonomics,
&gt; &gt; but I¹m a nerd after all.

&gt; &gt; Many of the Microsoft ³solutions² corporate speak for database apps and
&gt; &gt; other such industrial software are competing against IBM¹s, SAP¹s,
&gt; &gt; Peoplesoft¹s, etc. Microsoft may be a big player, perhaps even the
&gt; &gt; biggest player in some niches, but there is competition. Moreover, that
&gt; &gt; competition can convince corporate buyers that their own products are
&gt; &gt; more cost-effective and consequently a better investment than
&gt; &gt; Microsoft¹s. That kind of calculus is rare if simply non-existent in
&gt; &gt; Apple¹s chosen niches. In fact, Apple studiously avoids rational sales
&gt; &gt; pitches and focuses instead on the emotional attachment to its products.
&gt; &gt; We live in a long-tail world, to use Chris Anderson¹s phrase. Apple
&gt; &gt; certainly isn¹t invulnerable to an upstart device maker from way down in
&gt; &gt; the tail. However, it at least has some very strong defenses in the form
&gt; &gt; of strong emotional attachment on the part of users and customers and a
&gt; &gt; consumer-oriented business model that seeks to please people as people,
&gt; &gt; and not as workers.

&gt; &gt; Microsoft, on the other hand, is extremely vulnerable to competitive
&gt; &gt; pressures by any number of upstart device or software producers. When
&gt; &gt; combined with the potential subversiveness of many movements out in the
&gt; &gt; long tail, there is no telling where the attack could come from. It
&gt; &gt; could be a full-scale onslaught by IBM or SAP (or how about GE?). But
&gt; &gt; most likely it will be an unforeseen, and unforeseeable, technology or
&gt; &gt; business model that will strike out of nowhere, stealthily and in the
&gt; &gt; night, like a guerrilla warrior. Or it could be the Googles of the world
&gt; &gt; morphing and adapting quicker, like the blob that ate the mid-Western
&gt; &gt; town in the B movie.

&gt; &gt; Microsoft has attained its current dominance because it muscled itself
&gt; &gt; into the marketplace and fought all comers. Simply put, Microsoft nuked
&gt; &gt; itself into its current position. But no one wants the nukes anymore. It
&gt; &gt; has to use stealth bombs and hearts and minds warfare. Can it change
&gt; &gt; itself into a kinder gentler monolith?

&gt; &gt; My money is on Apple, because it acts like a long-tail company, despite
&gt; &gt; its growing size and niche dominance. But who knows what lurks out there
&gt; &gt; in the night, ready to pounce on Microsoft and to offer its customers
&gt; &gt; superior value for less money, quicker, and with much less hassle?

&gt; Microsoft isn't as founder-centric as Apple is, Bill's focus has been
&gt; gradually shifting to various philanthropic activities he involves.
&gt; Microsoft is not the king of computing any more, but she is doing
&gt; pretty good. On the other hands, look at what shithole Apple has sunk
&gt; into since Jobs left in the 80s, and Apple only managed to magically
&gt; pull herself away from the brink of bankruptcy after the return of
&gt; Jobs.So if somehow Jobs died in a car accident tomorrow or of natural
&gt; causes 30 years from now, chances are Apple will lose the magic touch
&gt; that keeps its fans so fanatic. While Microsoft will likely gradually
&gt; grow into a bigger but less important technological company, its
&gt; chance of surviving next 5 decades are much better than that of Apple.

&gt; &gt; &gt; active, so we basically have about 2 more decades of innovation then
&gt; &gt; &gt; this industry will stagnate.

&gt; &gt; I have never thought Jobs led the market nearly as much as that.
&gt; &gt; He's an important leader at Apple not just because of innovation (which
&gt; &gt; usually doesn't come from him) but of focus and motivation, where he
&gt; &gt; has some very specific and important guidance concepts.

&gt; &gt; Thus, if someone understood and continued to follow in some significant
&gt; &gt; way Jobs' methods and concepts, Apple may grow very well even without
&gt; &gt; Jobs. (The character and personality issues are harder to quantify,
&gt; &gt; especially since I've never worked in Cupertino.)

&gt; &gt; The computer industry is much _less_ guided by Jobs or Apple.

&gt; What? the last 31 years is almost a complete Mirror of what Jobs has
&gt; decided. He put PC's on the map and promoted the shift from mainframes
&gt; to individual machines on a desk, he was the first to promote floppy
&gt; drives in both 5.25 and 3.5 formats, first to use laser printers, first
&gt; to have a machine with fonts, (except some xerox prototypes) first to
&gt; use modems extensively, first machine with a spreadsheet, first with at
&gt; GUI, first PC with a mouse, first to use recordable optical-drives,
&gt; first to use the Internet in a major way, first to use USB &amp; Firewire on
&gt; a mass scale, first to define WiFi, first to use Bluetooth as a
&gt; standard, first to define a new, easy way of distributing of music.
&gt; First with multi-touch, first cell phone with a real browser, etc.

&gt; The PC Industry IS 96.4% Steve Jobs's vision, nobody else's. Bill Gates
&gt; has always been Steve's puppet if you think about it clearly enough. MS,
&gt; IBM basically didn't do a thing after 1976 that has made an impact on
&gt; society. They copied Apple at every turn.

&gt; &gt; They take
&gt; &gt; some of the successful ideas and prompts from Apple, but much less than
&gt; &gt; is actually developed and less than is actually worth taking. That's
&gt; &gt; been true from many other companies, too. Apple hasn't been the only
&gt; &gt; leader in the computing industry, they are just an easy and
&gt; &gt; recognizable one, and one that eventually puts the better ideas into
&gt; &gt; their products (even if they weren't original to Apple!).

&gt; Sure, but only Apple's implementations STUCK. If it weren't for Jobs,
&gt; there would be no PC, there would be no GUI, there would be no Web.

&gt; &gt; What I mean is that the industry owes the innovators, and is guided by
&gt; &gt; innovations. Even though products from Apple may include many of those
&gt; &gt; innovations, the true sources don't always rely on Jobs as leader.

&gt; Yes, and I FULLY agree that Jobs has always been the master of taking
&gt; very rough research ideas and finally making them into a salable
&gt; product. But plenty of research would have died on the research bench if
&gt; it wasn't for Jobs to refine them to such a degree that they could be
&gt; used by &quot;people&quot;.

&gt; Bill Gates has done nothing over the last 30 years but copy Jobs in
&gt; painful ways and foist them on consumers under the guise of IBM
&gt; &quot;compatibility&quot;.

&gt; Nobody will remember BG in 150 years, SJ will be the one everyone looks

Well, I'm not familiar with histories. Let's assume what you said is
100% true. So what? Apple may be the first, MS may be the copycat, but
MS is THE leader and its support is critical for any of those
technologies you mentioned to actually accepted as standard (not just
declared by some international organization as open source supporters
often like to do). Apple is the scientist discovering the theories and
technologies, MS is the corporation actually builds the stuff most
people buy. Both of them contribute to societies, just in different
way. Henry Ford didn't invent automobile, but his contribution and
impact was no less than the guy who did the invention (don't know his
or her name).  Beside innovators, other people also contribute. Stop
being so science/tech-centric.

Nobody &quot;Invented&quot; the automobile. It is comprised of a number of inventions
that almost unavoidably &quot;fell together&quot; as the automobile. The idea of
locomotion on public roads goes back a long way. In the late 18th century,
the French had a heavy steam carriage which could haul large loads and could
be steered by a driver. The British tried steam-powered stagecoaches in the
early 19th century. When the light, compact internal combustion engine came
along in the 1880's it was only natural that many people in many countries
would apply the device to a carriage pretty much simultaneously. The credit
for the first &quot;practical&quot; automobile goes to German engineer Gottlieb Daimler
who, in about 1885, took Nikklaus Otto's newly invented 4-stroke engine and
married it to a light-weight three-wheeled carriage, thus making what is said
to be the first Internal combustion motor-car. Others may have done a similar
thing at more-or-less the same time, but Daimler's contraption was the most
well documented and he gets the credit for making an old idea work.
