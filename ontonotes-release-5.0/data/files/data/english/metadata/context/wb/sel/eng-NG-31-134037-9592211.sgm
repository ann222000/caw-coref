Assume a $2,000 billion economy with no government debt and a balanced
budget.  Suppose the government initiates a one-year program to refurbish
the highway system, at a cost of $100 billion.  The funds could be acquired
from the public either through additional taxes or borrowed at interest.  Which
of the two financing options is preferable?

In the taxing option, the simplest method is a one-time surcharge of 5% on
everyone's tax bill.  In the borrowing option, the government acquires a
debt of $100 billion, which we will assume is rolled over continuously and
pays interest of 4% per year.  Since the budget was initially balanced, the
government would need to increase taxes by $4 billion per year to cover the
interest payments on the debt.  That's an increase of 0.2%.

In both options, the government program causes a circulation of money which
did not previously exist.  It receives $100 billion from the public and
spends it on the highway system, which is income for the public.  Neither
option results in a net loss in financial wealth for the public.  In effect
the public acquires a refurbished highway system in exchange for its labor
and materials.

Measured in terms of *present value*, both options are equivalent.  In the
taxing option, the present value of the money paid by the public up front is
obviously $100 billion.  In the borrowing option, with no taxes to pay up
front, the public could invest the $100 billion received for its work at the
assumed interest rate on the Treasury bonds, 4%.  That would exactly pay for
the taxes needed to cover the interest on the debt created by the highway
program.

Of course the financial wealth of the public is redistributed in the
process, but that is true for all government spending.  In the taxing
option, the government *extracts* the funds in proportion to one's normal
tax liabilities.  That means most of the cost will be covered by those in
the higher taxable income group.  In the borrowing option the government
obtains the funds on a *voluntary* basis, according to the investment
preferences of the public.  Again most of the funds come from those with
higher taxable incomes because they normally have more loanable funds.

Hi,

Why not raise the money for highway upgrades by raising the gasoline tax? Then those who use the roads the most would pay the most, and the incentives would be to drive less, car pool, use mass transit, etc.  All thought to be &quot;good&quot; in terms of climate change, balance of payments, and reducing &quot;oil addiction&quot;.

The redistribution would then be to those who conserve, from those who don't.

Jim,

Anyone who has flown over the Los Angeles metropolitan area will see houses
stretching in all directions to the horizon.  The population density over
most of the residential region is low compared to major eastern US
cities.  Single
family homes and relatively small apartment or condo buildings are the
norm.  It's obvious why &quot;mass transit&quot; doesn't exist in the same way as it
does in the urban East.

The automobile is the only practical means of transportation for most
southern Californians.  A drive of 40 miles or more to and from work is not
uncommon.  Most LA freeways have car pool lanes, but they carry only a small
fraction of the total traffic.  So the burden of an increase in federal
taxes on gasoline would fall disproportionately on southern Californians.

William,

In the example the govt increases spending by 100 billion. That spending is
private sector income.  Assuming in the example that income is taxed, the govt
automatically gets back X% of its spending (X being the tax rate) without any
change to the tax code. And if the remaining money after taxes are paid is
spent, that spending will also be income that is taxed, and so on, and so on.
Eventually all the money should be recaptured through taxes without any change to
the tax code. The number of spending cycles until all the money is recaptured
should be a function of the tax rate.
However, if the private sector decides to net save some of the money at each
cycle, that money is removed from the income chain and will not be taxed as
income. In that case how much gets saved ends up being how much the govt
&quot;borrows&quot;.
I guess I am looking at this from a more dynamic viewpoint. I know the
example overlooks the effects of private sector (business) cycles and the foreign
sector.
The question is whether the private sector has the resources available to not
only supply the initial 100 billion, but all the subsequent spending
transaction before the money is fully recaptured (by taxes or borrowing).
In a nutshell, I think the public's desire to net save plays a role in how
much the govt must borrow.

Mark,

Yes, I oversimplified by ignoring the income tax on government spending.  The
intent was to show in perhaps too simple terms that there is no net
difference between the taxing and the borrowing option regarding benefit to
the public.  Government spending acts like a money pump which circulates its
own currency.  On balance it provides just enough currency to enable the
public to pay its taxes in a balanced reciprocal flow, so there is no net
drain on the public's holding.

In the taxing option, the budget would remain balanced although the required
tax surcharge would be less than I indicated because of the income taxes on
the government spending.  However there would be no government debt at
year-end.  In the borrowing option there is a residual government debt,
which I assumed would be rolled over indefinitely.  in principle it could be
paid off, but resulting in the same net effect.  The increase in taxes to
cover the interest payments due on the added debt is a push.  Its only
effect is to redistribute income.

I like your analysis, but I'm not sure what your conclusion is.  Is there a
net difference in the two options?  Do you see a problem in the ability of
the public to pay a small surcharge on their income taxes for example?  Is
the amount of debt created determined only by the public's decision on how
much to net save?

Part of my conclusion is additional government spending does not have to paid
for with higher taxes or offset by cuts elsewhere (as is the current policy
among one of the parties). Unfortunately I am running short on time so I hope
you don't mind if I continue my thoughts on Monday.

Hi William,

You might not like my analysis...

Politically it makes more sense to borrow the money, voters do not
like taxes.  Taxing an economy can have the so called 'laffer curve'
effect slowing down the economy. Borrowing seems to make more sense.
The problem is that for governments debt is habit forming.  Debt has
to be repaid when it suits the lender not the borrower, ie when the
debt is not rolled over.  This can cause quite considerable pain
especially when coupled with other externalities.

In your example it would make compelling sense for a government to
borrow the money for the refurbishment of its highway system.  If only
it would stop there.  It never does, especially when you have state
pensions to pay, and where it becomes important to offer senior
citizens free health care, the list goes on...

Best regards

John

Rolling over government debt is standard practice and should cause no pain.
It doesn't cost either the lender or the borrower anything.  There is

Hi William,

I agree that rolling over government is standard practice, obviously.
US debt is a useful currency hedge, well it was.  The dollar is
beginning to fall, almost continuously against the other major
currencies.  If this state of affairs is prolonged then I think the
government will have to start making steep spending cuts, interest
rates will rise as inflationary pressure grows, I think the economy is
under real pressure.

I agree with your point; government spending that improves the lot of
successive generations should be shared by the future recipients of
such investment.

A further point, governments should not run at a surplus.  The money
should be returned back to the taxpayer, who know how to spend and
invest more wisely than governments.  Failing that, it makes sense to
invest in your countries infrastructure if there is a strong likely
hood that there will be a return on such investment.  I apologise if
this sounds like Economics 1.1, I just think it adds some context to
your point.

Best regards

John

The trade-weighted dollar index is at the same level today that it was in
May 1997, and down 21% from its peak in Feb 2002.  The dollar is down about
27% relative to the euro when the euro was launched in Jan 2000.

I don't have any real concern about that trend.  It's true the price of
foreign goods in the U.S. will rise as the dollar depreciates, but the
general price level in the U.S. is not as sensitive to the price of foreign
goods as it is in most other countries.

The fact that the U.S. continues to run a large trade deficit indicates that
the dollar needs to depreciate further, which of course is not welcome in
the eurozone and the U.K.  Several countries still depend heavily on exports
to the U.S. market to support their domestic employment, especially China
and Japan.  Those two have been actively supporting the value of the dollar
in the forex market.

The question is whether government borrowing for long term programs to
improve the infrastructure does in fact affect future generations in a
financial sense, and if so what is the mechanism?

But governments can't run a surplus without draining the bank deposits of
the private sector and ultimately creating a serious recession.  That's why
on average they balance their receipts from taxes and borrowing with their
spending.  Perhaps you meant governments should spend less and therefore tax
less.  I suspect you would get a different view on that in most western
European countries, especially the Scandinavian.

Whether the government or the private sector invests most wisely depends on
the circumstances.  There is significant waste in the private sector too,
especially in the financial arena.  Also the overhead cost of private health
care in the U.S. is many higher than the overhead cost of government-run
medicare.  And then there is Enron, WorldCom and the like, not exactly
shining examples of private sector efficiency.

Hi,

Highway construction and repair is not exactly an example of infrastructure
that improves the lot of future generations. It distorts the US
transportation system towards dependence on cars and away from alternatives.
The current large government subsidy for roads, highways and cars is a
factor in the way cities expand and housing moves to the suburbs. And it
enhances gridlock, oil dependence, air pollution, etc.

I suggest that highway construction and repair be funded by the users.
Probably most efficiently by increasing the gasoline tax, but maybe more use
of tolls, since they can now be collected without disrupting traffic.

Gas tax and tolls has been criticized as being borne more by the &quot;poor&quot; than
the &quot;rich&quot;  but I would like to see data to support that.  Around here (and
I suspect for many other cities, the poor still live in town and use the
bus, the rich live in the suburbs and commute to work in town: typically one
to a car.

As I previously concluded, increased govt spending will result in increased
private sector income, which in turn results in increased tax revenue. But is
it the government that decides how much spending is &quot;financed&quot; from
&quot;borrowing&quot;, or is the amount the govt ends up &quot;borrowing&quot;  determined by how much the
private sector decides to net save? In other words, can the government force the
private sector to buy Treasury Securities to fund spending?
I have always advocated that fiscal policy is a great tool in influencing the
economy. The example in the original post was to spend 100 billion. But how
much total spending did this add to the economy? That 100 billion is private
sector income. If that income is taxed at 20%, that will leave 80 billion in the
economy that can be spent to provide more private sector income. Subtract
another 20% for tax on that income and the private sector can have another round
of spending of 64 billion. And so on and so on. So the original 100 billion of
spending resulted in many times that in spending/income to the private sector
(just carrying it out 2 cycles added 144 billion). The problem is can the
private sector supply all the goods and services of not only the original
spending but the subsequent spending. This is where encouraging the private sector to
save can come into play. Net savings of financial assets will remove money to
reduce spending/income. The govt can encourage savings by increasing interest
rates, or appealling to some other motive such as the patriotic duty of
buying war bonds or saving for retirement in an IRA/401k. Worked for Roosevelt and
Reagan.

Mark,

I have to take exception to some of your arguments.  Government spending
increases private sector income only if the Treasury does not recapture that
spending with taxes or the sale of its securities.  But in fact the Treasury
does quickly recapture its spending.  It does so to enable the Fed to
maintain control of the Fed funds rate.  If it did not, the Fed would have
to sell Treasury securities from its own portfolio.  That would ultimately
drain the Fed's holding, whereupon it would lose control of the short-term
interest rate, its basic monetary policy tool.

If the government decides to increase spending, say for the highway
refurbishment program, it must still balance its inflows against outflows by
selling enough debt to cover that spending.  It can always sell its debt
securities because they are risk-free and can pay whatever interest rate the
market demands.  There will always be an interest rate which will induce
enough investors to buy whatever the Treasury needs to cover its deficit
spending.

The government decides how much of its spending is &quot;financed&quot; through taxes
versus borrowing.  That's a function of the tax code which Congress writes,
i.e. fiscal policy.  Since taxes never precisely cover spending, the
Treasury sells or redeems securities to make up the difference.  It does so
on at least a weekly basis in T-bills.

What we use in daily commerce is mainly credit money issued by banks.
Government
spending does not directly affect that.  The credit money supply expands or
contracts as a function of the demand for bank loans, which varies with the
interest rate banks charge and which the Fed controls indirectly by setting
the cost of bank reserves.  An increase in government spending stimulates
the economy by redistributing income from those with loanable funds to those
who receive the spending.  That normally creates new jobs, which increases
demand and thus expands the economy and the money supply through the
multiplier effect that you refer to.

Mark,

Now I have to take exception to my own argument.  In the first paragraph I
incorrectly stated that the government balances its inflows against outflows
is to enable the Fed to control the Fed funds rate.  It does balance inflows
against outflows on average, but for a different reason.  Since the Treasury
maintains a nearly constant balance in its Fed account, government spending
does not affect total banking system reserves to first order.

The reason the Treasury balances inflows against outflows is because
otherwise it would impact the aggregate level of bank deposits in the
private sector.  The Treasury targets a roughly constant balance in its own
bank deposits by selling or redeeming its securities as required.  That
minimizes its impact on the private sector money supply.

I think the remaining paragraphs are valid as stated.

Dear All:

I’ve been reading, and learning from, all the postings of the group almost form its beginnings. I did contribute a few comments very early on, but then I ran into time constraints and had to stop.

Although I agree with many of the group’s ‘consensus’ [consensa?], there are some basic points on which I disagree. For example, in the current discussion topic, started by William, I will excerpt some of the ‘controversial ideas’ and comment on them (those comments are labeled “&lt;Jorge M.&gt;”)

[William F. H.] 9/20/07

In the taxing option, the simplest method is a one-time surcharge of 5% on everyone's tax bill.  In the borrowing option, the government acquires a debt of $100 billion, which we will assume is rolled over continuously and pays interest of 4% per year. In both options, the government program causes a circulation of money which did not previously exist.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; The ending of the paragraph, “money which did not previously exist”, is rather unfortunate. Government only uses money already in circulation. It is the Fed prerogative to issue new money (which it does rather sparingly). Government’s money come from either taxes or borrowing, and only indirectly from the Fed’s new issues [share in the Fed’s net earnings].

In effect the public acquires a refurbished highway system in exchange for its labor and materials.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; Not, really; the public pays for them with taxes.

[MarkG] 9/21/07

Assuming in the example that income is taxed, the govt automatically gets back X% of its spending (X being the tax rate) without any change to the tax code. And if the remaining money after taxes are paid is spent, that spending will also be income that is taxed, and so on, and so on. Eventually all the money should be recaptured through taxes without any change to the tax code. The number of spending cycles until all the money is recaptured should be a function of the tax rate.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; That is a clever misunderstanding of the flow of goods and money in the economy (also known as &quot;the multiplier effect'). Government produces goods, just like any other firm, the only difference lies in the way it receives payment. Money circulates (or at least it is intended to); but when one spends money, the fact that most of that money is eventually replenished by one's income does not really mean that one “gets back” the money initially spent. Or, does it? In reality, any income one receives is in payment for goods (including services) provided; taxes are similarly payment for government supplied goods.

[William F. H.]

Government spending acts like a money pump which circulates its own currency.  On balance it provides just enough currency to enable the public to pay its taxes in a balanced reciprocal flow, so there is no net drain on the public's holding.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; Again, government only uses money already in circulation (mostly bank money).

The increase in taxes to cover the interest payments due on the added debt is a push.  Its only effect is to redistribute income.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; That “redistribution of income” should not belittled, I think. It amounts to over $300B every year, which goes almost exclusively to savers (those who profit at the expense of the debtors).

[jrw]

Taxing an economy can have the so called 'laffer curve'
effect slowing down the economy. Borrowing seems to make more sense.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; The ‘Laffer Curve’ effect is truly a canard. The U.S. has perhaps the smallest tax income of all the industrial countries, and even the Clinton periods’ tax rate was well below any possible such effect.

In your example it would make compelling sense for a government to
borrow the money for the refurbishment of its highway system.  If only
it would stop there.  It never does,…

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; Skepticism about government’s honesty and efficiency is usually a good thing, …unless taken to the extreme.

[William F. H.] 9/22/07

As a general rule, operating costs and transfer payments are best covered by taxes.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; I fully agree!

There is nothing wrong with a quasi-permanent debt for the government.  Indeed it is an important part of the savings of the public.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; Saving is good for the saver, but bad for the economy. Government should have no debts. Isn’t it ludicrous that government is forced to borrow bank money--at the prevailing interest rate--, which is backed by the notes issued by the Fed (which are in turn ‘backed’ by government’s IOUs)?

[jrw]

A further point, governments should not run at a surplus.  The money
should be returned back to the taxpayer, who know how to spend and
invest more wisely than governments.  Failing that, it makes sense to
invest in your countries infrastructure if there is a strong likely
hood that there will be a return on such investment.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; I believe that government should run surpluses until it pays its entire debt.

[William F. H.]

But governments can't run a surplus without draining the bank deposits of the private sector and ultimately creating a serious recession.  That's why on average they balance their receipts from taxes and borrowing with their spending.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt;As long as the government has debts to service, any surplus will return to the private sector in exchange for the government IOUs. After that, the tax rates can be lowered to compensate for the ‘savings’ in debt servicing costs.

[MarkG] 9/24/07

In other words, can the government force the private sector to buy Treasury Securities to fund spending?

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; It does it all the time, although ‘force’ may not be the right word; Government entices people to lend it money by offering a high interest rate.

This is where encouraging the private sector to save can come into play. Net savings of financial assets will remove money to reduce spending/income.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt;

The govt can encourage savings by increasing interest rates, or appealling to some other motive such as the patriotic duty of buying war bonds or saving for retirement in an IRA/401k. Worked for Roosevelt and Reagan.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; Government should not borrow; and people should not be enabled to save (rather, they should be encouraged to invest).

[William F. H.]

What we use in daily commerce is mainly credit money issued by banks.  Government spending does not directly affect that.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; Right!

An increase in government spending stimulates the economy by redistributing income from those with loanable funds to those who receive the spending.  That normally creates new jobs, which increases demand and thus expands the economy and the money supply through the multiplier effect that you refer to.

&lt;Jorge M.&gt; Government spending has the same economic effect as that of any other firm spending. The so-called ‘multiplier effect’, as explained above, does not really exists: it is an artifact of a fallacious analysis.

The net effect is an exchange of labor and materials for the highway system,
with a redistribution of money which in total remains unchanged.  If
financed through borrowing, there is also an increase in net financial
wealth in the form of Treasury securities which can be rolled over
indefinitely with a nearly trivial increase in taxes to cover the added
interest payments.

That's indeed a prescription for disaster.  Every time the government has
run a significant surplus, the economy has subsequently fallen into
recession or depression because the private sector was being drained of too
much of its financial wealth.  Government debt is private sector savings.
Its borrowing creates a valuable financial instrument for the lender in
contrast to a receipt for taxes which would otherwise be required.  A
substantial government debt is also what helps make the US dollar the
world's primary reserve currency.

Very few people &quot;save&quot; by stuffing money under mattresses, which indeed is

new buildings and capital equipment.  Those savings are precisely what the
economy runs on.
