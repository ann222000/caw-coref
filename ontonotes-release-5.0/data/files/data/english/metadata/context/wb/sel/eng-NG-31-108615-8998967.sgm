Ok, Ken.

Show us how to obtain the perihelion precession from equation 14.

I'm especially curious to know how you intend to replicate the
observed relativistic effects with a K/r potential...

You follow the same procedure as Newtonian physics.
IRT can be used to determine the perihelion precession and to
determine the relativistic effects with K/r potential.

It already been published in Galilean Electrodynamics.
BTW have you learned the rule for matrix multiplication yet? Do you
know that the unit of measurement of time must be universal before
matrix multiplication can be used??????
Also have you learned that the SR effect on the GPS clock is not
symmetrical compared to the ground clock????

IRT is wrong then. A K/r potential cannot handle the following:

* Quadrupole radiation while excluding dipole radiation.
* The right /sign/ for radiation.
* Gravitational lensing [for K = GM, it is off by a factor of 2]
* Time dilation / gravitational redshift.
* Plus a crapload of other, more subtle, effects.

This is why you have resisted putting IRT in a mathematical form for
the last 13 years of posting - as soon as you do that, it will be torn
to shreds by those who are educated.

Use the IRT coordinate transform equations to determine the

The forst two IRT postulates are the same as th SR postulates and
therefore the SR derivations can be used. This means that the SR
equations are IRT equations. Therefore no different derivations are
required.

As an aside what is your interest on my theory?? If you want to
paticipate in the next physics revolution you need to do some hard
work yourself instead of keep on asking me to do this or that for you.
In other words, you need to answer your own questions with what I

You see? IRT can't really predict anything. All it does is provide a
set of equations with arbitrary constants, which you ascertain by
fitting future data. Then you use those fitted constants to make
predictions a little further down the road. There is not ONE
quantitative prediction that IRT can make at this time.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;IRT can be used to determine the perihelion precession and to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;determine the relativistic effects with K/r potential.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; IRT is wrong then. A K/r potential cannot handle the following:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; * Quadrupole radiation while excluding dipole radiation.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; * The right /sign/ for radiation.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; * Gravitational lensing [for K = GM, it is off by a factor of 2]
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; * Time dilation / gravitational redshift.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; * Plus a crapload of other, more subtle, effects.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Assertion is not a valid argument.

&gt;&gt; Where is your proof that IRT gets the precession of Mercury correct?
&gt;&gt; I'm assuming you have it because like you said, assertion is not a
&gt;&gt; valid argument.

&gt;That's what IRT predicts. You need to accumulate the data what the IRT
&gt;equations call for before you can confirms its predictions. Just as GR
&gt;predict the bending of light and it is confirmed by observation during
&gt;an eclipse.

Assertion is not a valid argument, Ken.

You /assert/ that you don't need a different derivation because your
theory and SR share two postulates, but you have not /proven/ that you
don't need a different derivation.

The obvious example is, as before, Euclidean and Hyperbolic geometry.
They each share the first four postulates - the only difference is in
the fifth postulate about parallel lines.

Euclidean and Hyperbolic geometry are obviously different - are they
not?

If they don't share the same equations despite sharing the first two
[four!] postulates, why is your theory exempt from that consideration?

What I find odd is that you steadfastly refuse to derive anything
using IRT. Every equation you have is an SR equation and you can't
even derive /those/ yourself. Why is that, Ken? Why can't you even
pull Newtonian gravitation out of IRT?

What, you think the rest of the physics community is going to be more
gentle than me?

Extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence. All I'm asking
you to do is replicate two of the simplest relativistic observations -
precession of Mercury's perihelion and strong gravitational lensing.

If you cannot even do that, after THIRTEEN YEARS of work on IRT, why
should the physics community pay any attention to you? Let me repeat:
you have been working on IRT, on this newsgroup, since 1994 and we are
/still waiting/ for your explaination of two of the most famous
predictions by relativity.

I'm not even asking for black holes, geodetic precession, the
Lense-Thirring effect, gravitational redshift, gravitational time
dilation, the Nortdvelt effect, or any number of things that piss all
over classical theories.

By the way Ken, I'm enrolled in 19 credit hours of coursework this
semester. Six of those are graduate courses in physics. How many hours
a week do /you/ spend on physics?

In another group, we discussed Gisse and his/her
ilk, as how disgusting the university system has
become since the &quot;any ding-bat can get a degree&quot;
policy came into effect, mainly the educationally
disadvantaged, essentially pay money from mommy,
get an alphabet caboose.

The down-side of that program is that we
hard-working taxpayers end up subsidizing
the aforementioned retards, so now a BS is
equivalent to used toilet paper.

Take Gisse for example, his Ph.d thesis is likely
to be as interesting as &quot;Effect of Global Warming
on Navel Lint Accumulation&quot;.

OTOH, I support scholarships as long as
they're tax deductible and vectored to good
students who are economically disadvantaged,
but not subsidizing &quot;Dummy D students&quot;, that's
mommy's job, NOT taxpayers!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ok, Ken.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Show us how to obtain the perihelion precession from equation 14.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm especially curious to know how you intend to replicate the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; observed relativistic effects with a K/r potential...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You follow the same procedure as Newtonian physics.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Then it is wrong since a Newtonian does not feature precessing for a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; test body in orbit of a single mass.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Then that's why you have to use IRT.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok - show me how IRT does it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Use the IRT coordinate transform equations to determine the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates of the Sun and Mercury at various time intervals. Plots of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these coordinates will reveal the perihelion shift and an equation for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the plot can be developed for future shifts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You see? IRT can't really predict anything. All it does is provide a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set of equations with arbitrary constants, which you ascertain by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fitting future data. Then you use those fitted constants to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions a little further down the road. There is not ONE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quantitative prediction that IRT can make at this time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey idiot the coordinates of the Sun and Mercury at various time
&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals are the predictions of IRT.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In GRT What data you have to measure before you can predict the
&gt; &gt; &gt; perihelion shift of Mercury?

&gt; &gt; The mass of the sun and the average radius of the orbit of Mercury and
&gt; &gt; the eccentricity of the orbit.

&gt; So GR need to measure all these parameters before you can determine
&gt; the perihelion shift of Mercury....right?
">

No, it already had them. They didn't need to write a proposal to
measure them. They'd already been measured.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; IRT do not use these parameters to determine the perihelion shift of
&gt; Mercury. It uses the IRT transform equations to do that.

So what prediction can IRT make using parameters that have already

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Now, you take IRT and those three parameters, and predict the
&gt; &gt; perihelion shift of Mercury. Go ahead. Do it.

&gt; Why do I have to use these parameters?? IRT uses the parameter F_ab
&gt; for the Sun and Mercury to determine the Perihelion shift of Mercury.

OK, then find one other quantitative prediction of a measurable
property that IRT can make using parameters that have already been
measured. Just one.

What part of the phrase &quot;IRT do not use these parameters to make

IRT requires the parameters F_ab and f_ab to make predictions. After
you have accumulate data for these two parameters then you can make
predictions using IRT equations.
Your question is stupid. I can ask you the same question: I have data
on F_ab and f_ab what predictions can you make using GR????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mass of the sun and the average radius of the orbit of Mercury and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the eccentricity of the orbit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So GR need to measure all these parameters before you can determine
&gt; &gt; &gt; the perihelion shift of Mercury....right?

&gt; &gt; No, it already had them. They didn't need to write a proposal to
&gt; &gt; measure them. They'd already been measured.

&gt; &gt; &gt; IRT do not use these parameters to determine the perihelion shift of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mercury. It uses the IRT transform equations to do that.

&gt; &gt; So what prediction can IRT make using parameters that have already
&gt; &gt; been measured?

&gt; What part of the phrase &quot;IRT do not use these parameters to make
&gt; predictions&quot; that you don't understand????????
">

Thanks, you've answered the question. I asked you what prediction IRT
can make using parameters that have already been measured. The answer
is &quot;none&quot;. You apparently think this is OK. You apparently do not see
how this is different than SR or GR.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; IRT requires the parameters F_ab and f_ab to make predictions. After
&gt; you have accumulate data for these two parameters then you can make
&gt; predictions using IRT equations.
&gt; Your question is stupid. I can ask you the same question: I have data
&gt; on F_ab and f_ab what predictions can you make using GR????
">

What data do you have on the *values* of F_ab and f_ab?

As for the predictions of SR or GR, I suggest you read the papers,
where you will find multiple predictions of measurable quantities,
where the prediction comes from a calculation using parameters
*already measured* at the time of the prediction.

You have no predictions using calculations with parameters *already
measured*. IRT has no present predictive power. You apparently don't
see that as a problem.

&gt; Good point. You've been in this for a few decades. So that we can see

Good for you, Ken. Being an experienced troubleshooter for computer
systems is a nontrivial challenge. However, that experience does not
translate into a physics education.

My physics education does not make me a good troubleshooter - years of
fiddling with computers, however, has done that. The converse also
applies - years of fiddling with computers does not give me a physics
education.

The sooner you realise this, the better.

I ask the question even though I already know the answer. I just want
to hear it from you.

So I'll expand on my line of thought.

You are a systems troubleshooter. A nontrivial job to be sure but that
does not make you a physicist. However good you are at your job does
not make you qualified to comment on physics.

Since you have no published papers in a peer reviewed journal, that
means you are not an academic. Nothing wrong with not being an
academic until you start presenting yourself as some sort of
authority. Since you are not an academic, and have no college
education in physics, that means everything you know about physics has
been self-taught. Nothing wrong with that either, but you seem to
think that your misinterpretations take precedence over what everyone
else thinks.

That your misinterpretations are continually pointed out as such and
that you still don't get it means you seriously need to find a
different hobby. Don't pretend this isn't a hobby - you are retired
most likely and just want something else to do. Pick something else.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Then it is wrong since a Newtonian does not feature precessing for a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; test body in orbit of a single mass.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Then that's why you have to use IRT.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok - show me how IRT does it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Use the IRT coordinate transform equations to determine the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates of the Sun and Mercury at various time intervals. Plots of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these coordinates will reveal the perihelion shift and an equation for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the plot can be developed for future shifts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You see? IRT can't really predict anything. All it does is provide a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set of equations with arbitrary constants, which you ascertain by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fitting future data. Then you use those fitted constants to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions a little further down the road. There is not ONE
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quantitative prediction that IRT can make at this time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey idiot the coordinates of the Sun and Mercury at various time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intervals are the predictions of IRT.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In GRT What data you have to measure before you can predict the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perihelion shift of Mercury?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mass of the sun and the average radius of the orbit of Mercury and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the eccentricity of the orbit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So GR need to measure all these parameters before you can determine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the perihelion shift of Mercury....right?

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, it already had them. They didn't need to write a proposal to
&gt; &gt; &gt; measure them. They'd already been measured.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IRT do not use these parameters to determine the perihelion shift of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mercury. It uses the IRT transform equations to do that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So what prediction can IRT make using parameters that have already

No, you miss my point. IRT is different than ANY physical theory,
because EVERY physical theory, for it to have value, must be able to

Otherwise it has no predictive value, and is therefore useless as a

You apparently don't see the difference between IRT and ANY physical
theory to be a problem. However, this problem is precisely what many
many people over the course of a decade have been trying to explain to
you, to no avail. When you have a theory that can make a quantitative
prediction using parameters that have ALREADY been measured, then it
might be worth looking at.

No, there's a big difference between an equation that uses parameters
that have already been measured to make a quantitative prediction, and
an equation that uses parameters that haven't been measured and
therefore can't make a prediction. The first has predictive power, and
all good theories have them. IRT does not.

your free time to take a course in the basic scientific method at your

Einstein played around with the idea of using an antisymmetric
metric tensor in his attempt to come up with a unified field
theory. Basically, the idea is that the symmetric part of g_ij
is the usual metric tensor, while the antisymmetric part of
g_ij was supposed to capture non-gravitational forces (such as
the electromagnetic field). This formally allowed Einstein to
combine his field equations plus Maxwell's equations into
one master equation.

However, as far as I know, nothing ever came of this approach.
It just amounts to a change of notation, but is mathematically
equivalent to the usual way of doing things.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In GRT What data you have to measure before you can predict the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perihelion shift of Mercury?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mass of the sun and the average radius of the orbit of Mercury and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the eccentricity of the orbit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So GR need to measure all these parameters before you can determine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the perihelion shift of Mercury....right?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, it already had them. They didn't need to write a proposal to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measure them. They'd already been measured.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IRT do not use these parameters to determine the perihelion shift of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mercury. It uses the IRT transform equations to do that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what prediction can IRT make using parameters that have already
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been measured?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What part of the phrase &quot;IRT do not use these parameters to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions&quot; that you don't understand????????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, you've answered the question. I asked you what prediction IRT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can make using parameters that have already been measured. The answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is &quot;none&quot;. You apparently think this is OK. You apparently do not see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how this is different than SR or GR.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure IRT is different than SR and GR. It is a complete theory of
&gt; &gt; &gt; relativity. It includes SR as a subset. It has an unl9imited domains
&gt; &gt; &gt; of applicability. It can resolve all of the observed cosmological
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems that GR failed to explain.

&gt; &gt; No, you miss my point. IRT is different than ANY physical theory,
&gt; &gt; because EVERY physical theory, for it to have value, must be able to
&gt; &gt; make predictions using parameters that have *already* been measured.
&gt; &gt; Otherwise it has no predictive value, and is therefore useless as a
&gt; &gt; theory. SR and GR certainly satisfied that. At the time of their
&gt; &gt; proposal, they made predictions using parameters that had already been
&gt; &gt; measured.

&gt; &gt; You apparently don't see the difference between IRT and ANY physical
&gt; &gt; theory to be a problem. However, this problem is precisely what many
&gt; &gt; many people over the course of a decade have been trying to explain to
&gt; &gt; you, to no avail. When you have a theory that can make a quantitative
&gt; &gt; prediction using parameters that have ALREADY been measured, then it
&gt; &gt; might be worth looking at.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IRT requires the parameters F_ab and f_ab to make predictions. After
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have accumulate data for these two parameters then you can make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions using IRT equations.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your question is stupid. I can ask you the same question: I have data
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on F_ab and f_ab what predictions can you make using GR????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What data do you have on the *values* of F_ab and f_ab?

&gt; &gt; &gt; These are new parameters.

&gt; &gt; So you DON'T have data on F_ab and f_ab.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the predictions of SR or GR, I suggest you read the papers,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where you will find multiple predictions of measurable quantities,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where the prediction comes from a calculation using parameters
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *already measured* at the time of the prediction.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sigh....so what is *already measured*. If I have *already measured
&gt; &gt; &gt; F_ab and f_ab* I can also make prediction using them.

&gt; &gt; But you haven't already measured F_ab and f_ab. So you can't make a
&gt; &gt; prediction with them. At the time that SR and GR were proposed,
&gt; &gt; Einstein was able to make predictions using parameters that had
&gt; &gt; already been measured. You can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have no predictions using calculations with parameters *already
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measured*. IRT has no present predictive power. You apparently don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see that as a problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You are a fucking idiot. All equations make predictions.

&gt; &gt; No, there's a big difference between an equation that uses parameters
&gt; &gt; that have already been measured to make a quantitative prediction, and
&gt; &gt; an equation that uses parameters that haven't been measured and
&gt; &gt; therefore can't make a prediction. The first has predictive power, and
&gt; &gt; all good theories have them. IRT does not.

&gt; Hey idiot....so you think that SR makes predictions without measuring
&gt; relative velocity??? You are wasting my time.
">

It the case of the clocks at the pole and the clocks at the equator,
that relative velocity is *already known* and does not need a new
experiment to measure it. As I said, SR when it was proposed had
predictive power using *already measured* parameters.

IRT does not have any predictive power using *already measured*
parameters. None whatsoever.

This is what sets IRT apart from any sensible physical theory.

Your &quot;theory&quot; still suffers from problems that were pointed out
long ago.  Take, for instance, you definition of relative
velocity on p. 4:

v = \lambda (f_aa - f_ab),

along with your definitions of the speed of light,

c = f_aa \lambda

and \gamma,

1 / \gamma = F_ab / F_aa.

Now, f_aa is the &quot;[i]nstantaneous frequency measurement of A's
standard light source as measured by A&quot;, and F_aa is the
&quot;[f]requency of a standard light source in A's frame as measured
by A.&quot;  There is no reason at all not to equate these two
arbitrary &quot;standard&quot; light sources, so that f_aa = F_aa.  Then,
unless something is very wrong, f_ab = F_ab.  Then you have,
assuming your \gamma is the same as everyone else's \gamma:

f_ab / f_ab = \sqrt ( 1 - v^2 / c^2 )
= \sqrt ( 1 - (\lambda (f_aa - f_ab))^2 / (f_aa \lambda)^2 ).

Square both sides, multiply by f_aa^2, and expand the square:

f_ab^2 = f_aa^2 - f_aa^2 + 2 f_aa f_ab - f_ab^2,

or

2 f_ab^2 = 2 f_aa f_ab

which means that f_aa must equal f_ab.  In other words, just as
before, your equation for v only works if v = 0.

As another example of a fundamental problem, look at Eq. 11 on p.
6, which purportedly gives the energy of a single particle:

E = M_0 \lambda^2 f_aa^2.

This means that you can change a particle's energy just by
choosing a different &quot;standard&quot; light source.  That is absurd.

Expert mathematical physicists like Dr. Moffat
and his team, have independantly confirmed the
rationality of non-symmetrical metrics.
An example is here,
arXiv:gr-qc/9412009
and many others by his team in ArXiv.

As it happens, Dr. Moffat and myself have
cottages close together, so he and his wife
came over for supper and we conversed on
the subject.

Dr. Moffat and Einstein use nonsymmetric
Christoffels, whereas I use symmetrical
Christoffels with nonsymmetrical metrics,
that get's detailed, but I'll try to add
that to our site in the future.

The evidence I've seen compells EM to be
propagated by the spacetime field, and
the required 6 quantities required to do
so are the antisymetrical g_ij and g_i0,
{i,j = 1,2,3}, for magnetic and electric
respectively.

Ignore this bit.  I don't know what I was thinking.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey idiot the coordinates of the Sun and Mercury at
various time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intervals are the predictions of IRT.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In GRT What data you have to measure before you can
predict the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perihelion shift of Mercury?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mass of the sun and the average radius of the orbit of
Mercury and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the eccentricity of the orbit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So GR need to measure all these parameters before you can
determine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the perihelion shift of Mercury....right?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, it already had them. They didn't need to write a proposal
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measure them. They'd already been measured.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IRT do not use these parameters to determine the perihelion
shift of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mercury. It uses the IRT transform equations to do that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what prediction can IRT make using parameters that have
already
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been measured?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What part of the phrase &quot;IRT do not use these parameters to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions&quot; that you don't understand????????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, you've answered the question. I asked you what prediction
IRT
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can make using parameters that have already been measured. The
answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is &quot;none&quot;. You apparently think this is OK. You apparently do not
see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how this is different than SR or GR.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure IRT is different than SR and GR. It is a complete theory of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relativity. It includes SR as a subset. It has an unl9imited domains
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of applicability. It can resolve all of the observed cosmological
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems that GR failed to explain.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, you miss my point. IRT is different than ANY physical theory,
&gt; &gt; &gt; because EVERY physical theory, for it to have value, must be able to
&gt; &gt; &gt; make predictions using parameters that have *already* been measured.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Otherwise it has no predictive value, and is therefore useless as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; theory. SR and GR certainly satisfied that. At the time of their
&gt; &gt; &gt; proposal, they made predictions using parameters that had already been
&gt; &gt; &gt; measured.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You apparently don't see the difference between IRT and ANY physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; theory to be a problem. However, this problem is precisely what many
&gt; &gt; &gt; many people over the course of a decade have been trying to explain to
&gt; &gt; &gt; you, to no avail. When you have a theory that can make a quantitative
&gt; &gt; &gt; prediction using parameters that have ALREADY been measured, then it
&gt; &gt; &gt; might be worth looking at.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IRT requires the parameters F_ab and f_ab to make predictions.
After
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have accumulate data for these two parameters then you can
make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions using IRT equations.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your question is stupid. I can ask you the same question: I have
data
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on F_ab and f_ab what predictions can you make using GR????

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What data do you have on the *values* of F_ab and f_ab?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These are new parameters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So you DON'T have data on F_ab and f_ab.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the predictions of SR or GR, I suggest you read the papers,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where you will find multiple predictions of measurable quantities,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where the prediction comes from a calculation using parameters
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *already measured* at the time of the prediction.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sigh....so what is *already measured*. If I have *already measured
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F_ab and f_ab* I can also make prediction using them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But you haven't already measured F_ab and f_ab. So you can't make a
&gt; &gt; &gt; prediction with them. At the time that SR and GR were proposed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Einstein was able to make predictions using parameters that had
&gt; &gt; &gt; already been measured. You can't.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have no predictions using calculations with parameters
*already
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measured*. IRT has no present predictive power. You apparently
don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see that as a problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You are a fucking idiot. All equations make predictions.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, there's a big difference between an equation that uses parameters
&gt; &gt; &gt; that have already been measured to make a quantitative prediction, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; an equation that uses parameters that haven't been measured and
&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore can't make a prediction. The first has predictive power, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; all good theories have them. IRT does not.

&gt; &gt; Hey idiot....so you think that SR makes predictions without measuring
&gt; &gt; relative velocity??? You are wasting my time.

&gt; It the case of the clocks at the pole and the clocks at the equator,
&gt; that relative velocity is *already known* and does not need a new
&gt; experiment to measure it. As I said, SR when it was proposed had
&gt; predictive power using *already measured* parameters.
">

The clocks at the pole and at the equator are assumes to be at different
velocities due to the rotation of the earth. IRT can also use these
assumptions to make prediction about the clock rates at these different
places.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; IRT does not have any predictive power using *already measured*
&gt; parameters. None whatsoever.

&gt; This is what sets IRT apart from any sensible physical theory.
">

Fucking idiot. So you think SR doesn't have to measure relative velocity to
make predictions?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Name one person who explicitly agrees with you that the metric can be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; antisymmetric in GR.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Again (4th time) Moffat/Einstein,
&gt;&gt; &gt;(eric has MEMEORY PROBLEMS).

&gt;&gt; Wrong, Ken. Neither Einstein or Moffat thought the specific theory
&gt;&gt; called general relativity allowed antisymmetric metrics.

&gt; I'll repeat, (eric), you've superficially
&gt; glanced at 1% of GTR, and taken that very
&gt; simplified classical theory to be all it is.
&gt; An intro to GTR spoon-feeds the doughheads,
&gt; such as yourself, a pablum version of GTR,
&gt; then you goose-step out of your school all
&gt; full of yourself thinking you know GTR, well
&gt; that's what you pay for and that's what you
&gt; get. No problem, standardized institutional
&gt; mass produced brat, keeps mommy happy.

&gt; GPR, (General Principles of Relativity)
&gt; do NOT exclude nonsymmetrical metrics,
&gt; you need to sort that out, especially
&gt; if you intend to advance to unified field
&gt; theory.
&gt; See my post to Daryl.

As Eric implied, Moffat's theory is not GR--arXiv:gr-qc/9412009 says so
repeatedly--so presumably neither is yours. The argument is about GR not
attempted modifications of it.
