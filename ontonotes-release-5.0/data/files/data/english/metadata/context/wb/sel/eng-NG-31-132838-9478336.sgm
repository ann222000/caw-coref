*Piramal Group Enters the Real Estate Market*
Piramal Enterprises, part of the Ajay Piramal Group, is planning to develop
properties in Mumbai's central and northern regions. The company has set up
a joint venture (JV) with Sunteck Realty, Mumbai-based real estate
developers. The move comes close on the heels of Ashok Piramal Group-formed
after a formal family settlement with the Ajay Piramal group-- to develop
areas near Lower Parel in Central Mumbai as an IT park. The new projects
would be both commercial as well as ultra-luxury residential. Mumbai's
central areas, in and around Grant Road, Parel and Tardeo are in for major
development, according to recent reports. The JV, called Piramal Sunteck
Realty Pvt. Ltd. will focus on realty projects in locations in metros and
select tier-II cities across the country, according to a release from the
company. The names of the cities were not specified. The JV will have a
corpus of Rs 1000 crore. The first project would a
commercial-cum-Information Technology (IT) park of over ten lakh square feet
at Sion, Mumbai, near Dharavi in North Central Mumbai. In addition to ultra
luxury residential projects, Piramal Sunteck Realty Pvt. Ltd. will develop
commercial projects, mixed-use townships and Special Economic Zones (SEZ).

*Knowledge City to be set up in Visakhapatnam*
Unitech Ltd has come to an agreement with the Andhra Pradesh government to
set up the Vizag Knowledge City on 1,750 acres of land near Vishakapatnam,
for which it will pay Rs 3,328 crore over a ten-year period. At Rs 52 lakh
per acre, it may not be the most expensive deal in the country, but it is
among the largest in terms of the acreage from a single source in a single
deal. The Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) had
invited bids to develop the land for the Integrated Vizag Knowledge City.
Dubai-based Al Hamra Real Estate Development LLC had also qualified for the
bid, but dropped out in the final stage. Unitech executives said that the
company will invest more than Rs 20,000 crore (which includes the cost of
the land) to develop a total 10 million square feet of built-up space Into
an infotech park. There will be villas, high-rise apartments, shopping
centres and hotels as well as school and hospitals, an entertainment park
and a 250-acre golf course. Unitech expects sales of Rs 75,000 crore from
the project. Unitech declared land reserves at 10,700 acres in September
2006. DLF recently won the bid to develop the New Bangalore township on
9,000 acres, at Bidadi, near Bangalore. While the Rs 60,000 crore project is
the largest by size and investment, only a part of the land will be made
available by the state government and the rest will have to be acquired
directly from farmers at about Rs 56 lakh an acre. It is not yet known how
much land DLF will get from the government and how much it will have to
purchase from farmers. Unitech held the record for the most expensive land
deal till August for a 300-acre buy, at Rs 1,582 crore in Noida last year.
That was surpassed by DLF which bought 38 acres in west Delhi for Rs 1,675
crore from DCM Shriram Consolidated Ltd and the Lohia Group.

*IT Companies Trickle to Tier III Cities*
In view of the appreciating rupee, high wages and increasing real estate
prices, big, medium and small IT firms have made a successful entry into
tier-II cities. Encouraged by their progress, many small IT firms are now
exploring tier-III cities such as Udupi, Manipal, Hubli and Belgaum in
Karnataka, Kozhikode in Kerala, Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, Jaipur in
Rajasthan, and Durgapur and Kharagpur in West Bengal. The reasons are
manifold. These cities have a good number of engineering colleges, and the
firms do not find it difficult to meet their modest requirements of
staffing, usually in the low hundreds, at affordable costs and without being
plagued by high attrition. Smaller IT companies cannot compete with large
brands in software services across domains. They have to specialise in niche
areas and require a smaller workforce. It is easier for them to recruit in
smaller towns where the big players are not competing. Consequently, they
can bring down their operating costs, also. A case in point is Zeta Infotech
which operates a remote R&amp;D centre from Manipal for Synopsis, an electronic
design automation software provider. Similarly, software product development
services company Robosoft Technologies operates a centre in Udupi. The
company has been able to attract local talent and Robosoft now employs more
than 300 people. They have lower operating costs. The quality of life is
good (less traffic problems, less pollution, good environs for creative
work) for the employees. Udupi, Mangalore and Manipal have many educational
institutes and engineering colleges. They have good healthcare facilities
too. Another firm, Karmic, which offers design services, has set up a
220-member centre in Manipal. They have trained about 240 engineers in the
difficult area of chip design and 220 of them are still with us. They have
already opened a centre in Coimbatore and hope to open centres close to
where professionals hail from, based on their inputs. Kochi as an IT
destination is already witnessing the emergence of new locations.
Thiruvananthapuram-based International Business Services (IBS), which
provides IT solutions to the transportation and logistics sectors, is
planning a 25-acre campus in Kozhikode. Jaipur, too, has its share of small
IT firms. At present, there are eight firms working out of Jaipur. Intecons,
which provides software services, has set up a centre in Jaipur. The company
started with a target of local clients and Jaipur was comparatively less
competitive with fewer software service providers. But it is a developed
town and needs all IT-related facilities. They are targeting overseas
clients and the company is 95 per cent export-oriented as of now.

Smaller towns in West Bengal such as Kharagpur and Durgapur are also
attracting the attention of small players in the IT sector. Sankalp
Semiconductor, which provides services to the semiconductor sector, is
planning to open a centre, its third, in Kharagpur or Durgapur. At present,
they have two centres in Hubli and Belgaum. They will start another centre
in an engineering college in West Bengal. Kharagpur is home to an IIT and
Durgapur has a regional engineering college. A high tech cluster is coming
up in Kharagpur, which has new ventures promoted by IIT graduates, and can
absorb regional talent down the line. NASSCOM has been promoting a number of
secondary and tertiary cities with engineering talent.

*US $ 250 million. India Focussed Realty Fund by Knight Frank*
In the first of its kind among property consultants, the UK-headquartered
Knight Frank Group will launch a $250 million India-focused real estate
fund. According to sources the offshore fund will raise investments from
high net worth individuals and other investors from the UK and will have an
investment threshold of $0.5 million and above. However, employees of the
consultancy can invest smaller limits and the fund will invest in
FDI-complaint projects in the country, according to sources. The
fund-raising is expected to begin by January 2008 and will close in a couple
of months. Rutley Capital Partners (RCP), Knight Frank's real estate private
equity and investment management arm, is expected to spearhead the launch of
the India fund. However, an e-mailed questionnaire to Robert Hannington,
managing partner, RCP, did not elicit any response. RCP has two property
funds, Rutley European Property Fund, a Europe-focused fund and Rutley
Russia Property Fund. Knight Frank also has an Africa-focused fund. India
will be the fourth fund. Though the company is awaiting certain approvals,
it has started discussions with potential investors and is putting a
management team to run the fund. Knight Frank India Executive Director is
expected to head the new fund and the group has also roped in Pranav Datta
from Mahindra Gesco to head one of its operations, according to sources.
Though Knight Frank India is operating in the country for the last 12 years
and has four offices in Mumbai, Gurgaon, Pune and Bangalore, the new fund
will operate independently and have a separate team. Along with its US-based
real estate partner Newmark Knight Frank, the Knight Frank Group's global
network encompasses more than 165 offices in 36 countries across six
continents. It has over 5,300 professionals and handles some $36.1 billion
worth of commercial, agricultural and residential real estate annually.

*ICICI Launches Real Estate Security Fund*
ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund recently launched its real estate securities
fund, which is the first real estate mutual fund in India. The new fund
offer is open for subscription from November 15 to December 14, 2007. The
fund will invest 51 per cent of its portfolio in high-yielding debt
securities issued by real estate companies. The scheme will not directly own
or hold real estate. It will invest up to 49 per cent in the shares of
companies that will benefit from the real estate sector or have substantial
investments in property. Debt securities issued by real estate companies
have relatively low liquidity. Hence, in order to manage the liquidity risk,
the fund has been designed as a 3-year close-ended fund. It will invest in
real estate and related sectors such as cement, construction, metals,
hotels, retail, banks and finance companies. According to National Housing
Bank, India will have a shortage of over 20 million housing units and an
incremental demand of 8-10 million each year. The country will need an
investment of $25 billion in the retail segment by 2010 to meet the growing
demand for malls and multiplexes. The need for commercial and hospitality
facilities is also huge.

*ETA Star to Invest Rs.1,500 crores in Mumbai*
Chennai-based real estate developer ETA Star Property Developers, a part of
$4 billion ETA Ascon group based in the UAE, will build a Rs 1,500 crore
mall in Mumbai's Juhu area. The construction work will begin in January
2008. ETA has formed a 50:50 joint venture with Supra Estates, to develop
the 10 acre plot (450,000 sq ft) into a shopping mall and service
apartments. The companies have paid Rs 800-900 crore for the said plot of
land. The mall will be given on a seven-year lease upon completion of the
project in 2010. ETA has brought Rs 200-250 crore as equity contribution for
the project in terms of foreign direct investment (FDI) and will raise the
balance through banks and other financial institution. ETA has also forged a
joint venture with Wavy Construction for a project based in the hill station
of Khandala, Maharashtra. The project involves building luxury villas,
health spas, hotels and furnished apartments. Even as the structure of the
joint venture is yet to be finalised, both companies will inject Rs 400
crore for the project spread across 28 acres. A US consultancy firm, Tony
Asahi, has been appointed to provide a detailed study of the area, which
would help draft the final outlook of the project. ETA is currently
executing a Rs 13,500 crore integrated township project at Sriperumbudur
near Chennai. The project, spread over a land area of 1,200 acres, will be
finished in seven years. ETA Star has created a separate special purpose
vehicle for the project in which it would hold 59.9 per cent, a foreign
partner 40 per cent with Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation
holding the rest. ETA Star is talking to a few companies in the US and
Europe for the project. The company is involved in real estate ventures
mainly in the southern region of the country with projects spread across
Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The company is executing a residential
project in Chennai, where it is developing apartments under the name of
Jasmine Court. The project follows two other projects 'Binny Crescent' and
'The Gardens', both residential projects in Bangalore.

*MONTH'S SPECIAL FEATURE

Tips to make your home buying process simple*

While owning a house is a cherished dream for most individuals, it is also a
lifetime decision involving large investments. Though the availability of
easy finance, innovative products and other value-added services by housing
finance institutions have made the home buying process relatively simple,
for a customer it is still a challenge to decide which home loan works best
for him

There are two aspects of home buying - Property Search and Home Loans:

Some of the primary concerns of homebuyers, as far as the property is
concerned, include matters pertaining to the property's title, its technical
evaluation, its pricing, the developer's track record, etc. Whereas on the
home loan front a customer's main issues besides the rate of interest
offered, would be related to the company's loan procedure, quality of
services offered, the product range and safe retrieval of the property
documents on completion of the loan tenure.

Most families spend a large amount of time looking for their dream home,
which includes scanning through several projects, taking expert assistance,
doing builder credibility checks, etc. However, most often selection of a
home loan company and the loan product is a hasty decision.

Customers going in for a home loan may well benefit from some basic research
on the home loan company before deciding to take a loan from it. They would
need to find out whether the home loan company can simplify the complexities
of home buying and help them tackle every aspect of the process, right from
the selection of the property to documentation and loan processing.

If the customer is yet to decide on the property to be bought, he could take
the assistance of the home loan company to locate the right property. Since
home loan companies deal regularly with developers, they are aware of the
upcoming projects in different localities and can help the customer locate
the property that matches his individual requirements. Also in the case of
resale property, the company should be able to clarify steps involved, the
sequence in which they are to be completed and also the precautions to be
taken. This usually saves a lot of time and hassle for the customers, as
they are empowered to take a more informed decision.

Customers should also look out for facilities whereby the home loan company
approves the loan even before the property is selected or finalised. This
helps a customer in planning the purchase of the property since he is aware
of the funds available to him and can buy a property matching his budget.

One should also ensure that the loan provider follows a single-window
concept, whereby all aspects of property purchase are addressed by the same
company, be it advice on legal documentation, extending technical support,
assistance in deciding the suitable loan products or customizing the
repayment to suit their specific requirements. This not only help save a lot
of time and effort on the part of the customer, but also save money as the
processing and administrative charges usually cover all these expenses.

Customers should also be aware of how they can enhance their loan
eligibility without the burden of a higher EMI. The home loan company should
be able to structure the loan in such a way that it offers flexibility to
customers, enhances their loan eligibility, helps them optimize tax benefits
and customise EMIs according to their repayment capacity, so the customer is
able to repay the loan comfortably every month.

It would be wise for a customer to opt for home loan insurance. When
customers take a home loan they enter into a long-term financial commitment,
which is usually for a period of 15 to 20 years. In case of any eventuality
during this period the insurance will protect the family from the liability
of repaying the loan, as the insurance will take care of the same.

One may also take advantage of technology and avail services through the
Internet. There are lenders that provide an on-line application form on
their website, which have the provision of an on-line EMI calculator and a
host of other value added services, which help in breaking down time and
geographical barriers. For instant service, one can also opt for the
facilities available through SMS, like seeking an appointment with a loan
counselor, getting updates on loan application status, receiving information
on the disbursement date, etc.

Although these services add to customer convenience and help save time, it
is always advisable to directly meet the loan provider before finalising the
loan. Buying a home is for most of us the single largest investment and
involves long-term financial commitment. Thus it is important that one meets
and discusses with the loan provider before finalising.

When one meets the lender it is important to access the lender's background,
whether they seem to have adequate systems in place in terms of maintaining
documents safely and capabilities of providing the desired service levels
throughout the term of the loan. It is best to go with companies that have
established themselves over the years, as they have the capacity to
understand the customer better and offer customized service. The other
advantage is this will also help the customer to cash on the vast pool of
knowledge that their counselors have been trained to acquire.
