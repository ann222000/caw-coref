Sanchez: Iraq war 'a nightmare with no end in sight'

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former commander of coalition forces in Iraq
issued a harsh assessment of U.S. management of the war, saying that
American political leaders cost American lives on the battlefield with
their &quot;lust for power.&quot;

Retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, coalition commander in 2003 and
2004, called the Iraq war &quot;a nightmare with no end in sight,&quot; for
which he said the Bush administration, the State Department and
Congress all share blame.

Sanchez told a group of military reporters in Arlington, Virginia, on
Friday that such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean
immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not
been held accountable.

He said the Iraq war plan from the start was &quot;catastrophically flawed,
unrealistically optimistic,&quot; and the administration has not provided
the resources necessary for victory, which he said the military could
never achieve on its own.

Still, he said, the U.S. cannot pull out of Iraq without causing chaos
that would have global implications.

&quot;After more than four years of fighting, America continues its
desperate struggle in Iraq without any concerted effort to devise a
strategy that will achieve victory in that war torn country or in the
greater conflict against extremism,&quot; Sanchez said.

Sanchez pointed to what he said was &quot;neglect and incompetence at the
National Security Council level&quot; which has put the U.S. military into
&quot;an intractable situation&quot; in Iraq.

&quot;We appreciate his service to the country. As General Petraeus and
Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is
being made in Iraq. And that's what we're focused on now.&quot;

Sanchez, who retired in 2006, said it was his duty to obey orders and
not object publicly when he was on active duty, but now that he is
retired he has an obligation to speak out.

&quot;While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their
reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,&quot; he said.

The administration, he said, has ignored messages from field
commanders that warned repeatedly that &quot;our military alone could not
achieve victory&quot; without corresponding help from the State Department.

&quot;Our National leadership ignored the lessons of World War Two as we
entered into this war and to this day continue to believe that victory
can be achieved through the application of military power alone,&quot; he
said.

&quot;From a catastrophically flawed, unrealistically optimistic war plan,
to the administration's latest surge strategy, this administration has
failed to employ and synchronize its political, economical and
military power,&quot; he said.

Sanchez said the current strategy, which included a &quot;surge&quot; of troops
into Iraq, was &quot;a desperate attempt by the administration that has not
accepted the political and economic realities of this war and they
have definitely not been able to communicate effectively that reality
to the American people.&quot;

&quot;Too often, our politicians have been distracted and they have chosen
loyalty to their political parties above loyalty to the Constitution
because of their lust for power,&quot; he said.

Congress, he said, has failed its job of oversight.

&quot;Who will demand accountability for the failure of our national
political leadership involved in the management of this war,&quot; he said.
&quot;They have unquestionably been derelict in in the performance of their
duty. In my profession, these types of leaders would be immediately
relieved or court-martialed.&quot;

Sanchez was pessimistic about the chances of victory in Iraq unless
there is a major change in commitment.

&quot;Continued manipulations and adjustments to our military strategy will
not achieve victory,&quot; he said. &quot;The best we can do with this flawed
approach is stave off defeat.&quot;

&quot;There is no question America is living a nightmare with no end in
sight,&quot; he said.

The nightmare will not end, he said, until the partisan struggle for
power in Washington ends.

&quot;National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics
that have prevented us from devising an effective, executable and
supportable strategies,&quot; he said. &quot;At times, these partisan struggles
have led us to political decisions that endangered the lives of our
sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was
that political power had greater priority than our national security
objectives.&quot;

&quot;Overcoming this strategic failure is the first step toward achieving
victory in Iraq,&quot; he said. &quot;Without bipartisan cooperation, we are
doomed to fail. There is nothing going on today in Washington that
would give us hope.&quot;

If you think that the Democrats would allow any government rather than an
extreme left-wing government to exist in Iraq you're not looking at the
Democrats with clear vision.

While Bush certainly has been treating the war badly after his initial good
judgement, most of his positions have been formed in order to get some sort
of cooperation from the lefties in the Democrat Party.

None whatever.

Before the invasion of Iraq, various neo-cons suggested that the war
would be quick, easy, and above all, cheap.

These days they tend to deny that they ever suggested such a thing,
but I'm afraid the record speaks for itself:
http://www.house.gov/schakowsky/iraqquotes_web.htm

&quot;Well, the reconstruction costs remain a very - an issue for the
future. And Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country.
Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people. And so
there are a variety of means that Iraq has to be able to shoulder much
of the burden for their own reconstruction.&quot; - Ari Fleischer

&quot;This is not Afghanistan... When we approach the question of Iraq, we
realize here is a country which has a resource. And it's obvious, it's
oil. And it can bring in and does bring in a certain amount of revenue
each year... $10, $15, even $18 billion... this is not a broke
country.&quot; - Richard Armitage

&quot;There's a lot of money to pay for this that doesn't have to be U.S.
taxpayer money, and it starts with the assets of the Iraqi people...
and on a rough recollection, the oil revenues of that country could
bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of the next two or
three years... We're dealing with a country that can really finance
its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.&quot; - Paul Wolfowitz

&quot;If you (worry about just) the cost, the money, Iraq is a very
different situation from Afghanistan... Iraq has oil. They have
financial resources.&quot; - Donald Rumsfeld

&quot;On the resource side, Iraq itself will rightly shoulder much of the
responsibilities. Among the sources of revenue available are $1.7
billion in invested Iraqi assets, the found assets in Iraq... and
unallocated oil-for-food money that will be deposited in the
development fund.&quot; - Alan Larson

&quot;I don't believe that the United States has the responsibility for
reconstruction, in a sense... (Reconstruction) funds can come from
those various sources I mentioned: frozen assets, oil revenues and a
variety of other things, including the Oil for Food, which has a very
substantial number of billions of dollars in it. - Donald Rumsfeld

So how's that working out?

Well, the New York Times reported that:

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/12/world/middleeast/12oil.html?ex=1336...

Between 100,000 and 300,000 barrels a day of Iraq's declared oil
production over the past four years is unaccounted for and could have
been siphoned off through corruption or smuggling, according to a
draft American government report.

Using an average of $50 a barrel, the report said the discrepancy was
valued at $5 million to $15 million daily.

(snip)

Iraqi and American officials have previously said that smuggling of
refined products like gasoline and kerosene is probably costing Iraq
billions of dollars a year in lost revenues.

The smuggling of those products is particularly feared because
officials believe that a large fraction of the proceeds go to
insurgent groups.

(snip)

Adding together both civilian and military financing, the report
concludes that the United States has spent $5.1 billion of the $7.4
billion in American taxpayer money set aside to rebuild the Iraqi
electricity and oil sectors.

The United States has also spent $3.8 billion of Iraqi money on those
sectors, the report says.

Despite those enormous expenditures, the performance is far short of
official goals, and in some cases seems to be declining further.

So let's see... the Bush administration has spent $5 billion of U.S.
taxpayer dollars to rebuild the Iraqi oil sector, and the result is
that an estimated 300 million barrels of oil have gone missing,
putting millions of dollars into the hands of insurgents who are using
the funds to kill American troops.

Way to go!

But just out of curiosity, how come we don't know exactly how much oil
is being stolen?

Mr. Ebel said the lack of modern metering equipment, or measuring
devices, at Iraq's wellheads made it especially difficult to track
smuggling there.

The State Department official agreed that there were no meters at the
wellheads, but said that Iraq's Oil Ministry had signed a contract
with Shell Oil to study the possibility of putting in the meters.

Well I guess they've only had five years to get that sorted out.

No rush.

[Yes, I know this is completely off topic here]

Not nearly as many as will die in the civil conflict that Western
intervention has caused. In his worst year ever he never killed his own
civilians on this scale. To suggest that /anything/ in Iraq is 'better'
now than it was before the illegal US-led invasion is simply ignorance.
Yes, it was bad then. But not nearly as bad as it is now.

The British have been defeated and driven out of Basra, which is now in the
hands of warring factions. The US is being defeated in Baghdad. Women, who
under Ba'ath party rule formed a significant part of the professional
middle class, are now confined to their homes. Electricity and drinking
water - and /gas/, for heaven's sake - which under the Ba'ath party was
available reliably everywhere, are now extremely hard to get. Basic
infrastructure has broken down. The hospitals and schools are in chaos.

This isn't to excuse the Ba'ath party. Their rule was oppressive in the
extreme. But civil war - with no end in sight - is not an improvement. We
have created a terrorist state - a breeding ground for terrorists - where
there was not one before.

There's a more sophisticated way to steal oil. Its called a

oil wealth to US oil corporations for decades to come.

Perhaps those coffins coming back from Iraq should have Exxon

Of course Sanchez is critical of the administation and the war.  In
practically any discussion of the poor execution of the early stages
of the war, it is pointed out that HE was the commander of US forces
at the time.  Plus, any discussion of the current successes make it
plainly clear that his successor is doing things right.  He HAS to
blame someone else, or else he has to accept most of the
responsibility himself.

Sanchez was a terrible commander and his predecessor has turned out to
be a genius who's turning things around.  No big surprise that he's
passing the blame to someone else.

Please don't misunderstand, Bush has plenty to answer for.  But,
Sanchez's word isn't the definitive word on this.  He's just whining
to deflect blame from himself.  I give his rantings no credence
whatsoever.

OK,
How about Bill Odom then?

Victory Is Not an Option.
The Mission Can't Be Accomplished -- It's Time for a New Strategy

By William E. Odom
Sunday, February 11, 2007; B01

The new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq starkly delineates the gulf
that separates President Bush's illusions from the realities of the war.
Victory, as the president sees it, requires a stable liberal democracy in
Iraq that is pro-American. The NIE describes a war that has no chance of
producing that result. In this critical respect, the NIE, the consensus
judgment of all the U.S. intelligence agencies, is a declaration of defeat.

Its gloomy implications -- hedged, as intelligence agencies prefer, in
rubbery language that cannot soften its impact -- put the intelligence
community and the American public on the same page. The public awakened to
the reality of failure in Iraq last year and turned the Republicans out of
control of Congress to wake it up. But a majority of its members are still
asleep, or only half-awake to their new writ to end the war soon.

Perhaps this is not surprising. Americans do not warm to defeat or failure,
and our politicians are famously reluctant to admit their own responsibility
for anything resembling those un-American outcomes. So they beat around the
bush, wringing hands and debating &quot;nonbinding resolutions&quot; that oppose the
president's plan to increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq.

For the moment, the collision of the public's clarity of mind, the
president's relentless pursuit of defeat and Congress's anxiety has
paralyzed us. We may be doomed to two more years of chasing the mirage of
democracy in Iraq and possibly widening the war to Iran. But this is not
inevitable. A Congress, or a president, prepared to quit the game of &quot;who
gets the blame&quot; could begin to alter American strategy in ways that will
vastly improve the prospects of a more stable Middle East.

No task is more important to the well-being of the United States. We face
great peril in that troubled region, and improving our prospects will be
difficult. First of all, it will require, from Congress at least, public
acknowledgment that the president's policy is based on illusions, not
realities. There never has been any right way to invade and transform Iraq.
Most Americans need no further convincing, but two truths ought to put the
matter beyond question:

First, the assumption that the United States could create a liberal,
constitutional democracy in Iraq defies just about everything known by
professional students of the topic. Of the more than 40 democracies created
since World War II, fewer than 10 can be considered truly
&quot;constitutional&quot; -- meaning that their domestic order is protected by a
broadly accepted rule of law, and has survived for at least a generation.
None is a country with Arabic and Muslim political cultures. None has deep
sectarian and ethnic fissures like those in Iraq.

Strangely, American political scientists whose business it is to know these
things have been irresponsibly quiet. In the lead-up to the March 2003
invasion, neoconservative agitators shouted insults at anyone who dared to
mention the many findings of academic research on how democracies evolve.
They also ignored our own struggles over two centuries to create the
democracy Americans enjoy today. Somehow Iraqis are now expected to create a
constitutional order in a country with no conditions favoring it.

This is not to say that Arabs cannot become liberal democrats. When they
immigrate to the United States, many do so quickly. But it is to say that
Arab countries, as well as a large majority of all countries, find creating
a stable constitutional democracy beyond their capacities.

Second, to expect any Iraqi leader who can hold his country together to be
pro-American, or to share American goals, is to abandon common sense. It
took the United States more than a century to get over its hostility toward
British occupation. (In 1914, a majority of the public favored supporting
Germany against Britain.) Every month of the U.S. occupation, polls have
recorded Iraqis' rising animosity toward the United States. Even supporters
of an American military presence say that it is acceptable temporarily and
only to prevent either of the warring sides in Iraq from winning. Today the
Iraqi government survives only because its senior members and their families
live within the heavily guarded Green Zone, which houses the U.S. Embassy
and military command.

As Congress awakens to these realities -- and a few members have bravely
pointed them out -- will it act on them? Not necessarily. Too many lawmakers
have fallen for the myths that are invoked to try to sell the president's
new war aims. Let us consider the most pernicious of them.

1) We must continue the war to prevent the terrible aftermath that will
occur if our forces are withdrawn soon. Reflect on the double-think of this
formulation. We are now fighting to prevent what our invasion made
inevitable! Undoubtedly we will leave a mess -- the mess we created, which
has become worse each year we have remained. Lawmakers gravely proclaim
their opposition to the war, but in the next breath express fear that
quitting it will leave a blood bath, a civil war, a terrorist haven, a
&quot;failed state,&quot; or some other horror. But this &quot;aftermath&quot; is already upon
us; a prolonged U.S. occupation cannot prevent what already exists.

2) We must continue the war to prevent Iran's influence from growing in
Iraq. This is another absurd notion. One of the president's initial war
aims, the creation of a democracy in Iraq, ensured increased Iranian
influence, both in Iraq and the region. Electoral democracy, predictably,
would put Shiite groups in power -- groups supported by Iran since Saddam
Hussein repressed them in 1991. Why are so many members of Congress
swallowing the claim that prolonging the war is now supposed to prevent
precisely what starting the war inexorably and predictably caused? Fear that
Congress will confront this contradiction helps explain the administration
and neocon drumbeat we now hear for expanding the war to Iran.

Here we see shades of the Nixon-Kissinger strategy in Vietnam: widen the war
into Cambodia and Laos. Only this time, the adverse consequences would be
far greater. Iran's ability to hurt U.S. forces in Iraq are not trivial. And
the anti-American backlash in the region would be larger, and have more
lasting consequences.

3) We must prevent the emergence of a new haven for al-Qaeda in Iraq. But it
was the U.S. invasion that opened Iraq's doors to al-Qaeda. The longer U.S.
forces have remained there, the stronger al-Qaeda has become. Yet its
strength within the Kurdish and Shiite areas is trivial. After a U.S.
withdrawal, it will probably play a continuing role in helping the Sunni
groups against the Shiites and the Kurds. Whether such foreign elements
could remain or thrive in Iraq after the resolution of civil war is open to
question. Meanwhile, continuing the war will not push al-Qaeda outside Iraq.
On the contrary, the American presence is the glue that holds al-Qaeda there
now.

4) We must continue to fight in order to &quot;support the troops.&quot; This argument
effectively paralyzes almost all members of Congress. Lawmakers proclaim in
grave tones a litany of problems in Iraq sufficient to justify a rapid
pullout. Then they reject that logical conclusion, insisting we cannot do so
because we must support the troops. Has anybody asked the troops?

During their first tours, most may well have favored &quot;staying the course&quot; --
whatever that meant to them -- but now in their second, third and fourth
tours, many are changing their minds. We see evidence of that in the many
news stories about unhappy troops being sent back to Iraq. Veterans groups
are beginning to make public the case for bringing them home. Soldiers and
officers in Iraq are speaking out critically to reporters on the ground.

But the strangest aspect of this rationale for continuing the war is the
implication that the troops are somehow responsible for deciding to continue
the president's course. That political and moral responsibility belongs to
the president, not the troops. Did not President Harry S. Truman make it
clear that &quot;the buck stops&quot; in the Oval Office? If the president keeps
dodging it, where does it stop? With Congress?

Embracing the four myths gives Congress excuses not to exercise its power of
the purse to end the war and open the way for a strategy that might actually
bear fruit.

The first and most critical step is to recognize that fighting on now simply
prolongs our losses and blocks the way to a new strategy. Getting out of
Iraq is the pre-condition for creating new strategic options. Withdrawal
will take away the conditions that allow our enemies in the region to enjoy
our pain. It will awaken those European states reluctant to collaborate with
us in Iraq and the region.

Second, we must recognize that the United States alone cannot stabilize the
Middle East.

Third, we must acknowledge that most of our policies are actually
destabilizing the region. Spreading democracy, using sticks to try to
prevent nuclear proliferation, threatening &quot;regime change,&quot; using the
hysterical rhetoric of the &quot;global war on terrorism&quot; -- all undermine the
stability we so desperately need in the Middle East.

Fourth, we must redefine our purpose. It

&gt; &gt; From: http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/10/13/iraq.sanchez/

&gt; &gt; Sanchez: Iraq war 'a nightmare with no end in sight'

&gt; &gt; WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former commander of coalition forces in Iraq
&gt; &gt; issued a harsh assessment of U.S. management of the war, saying that
&gt; &gt; American political leaders cost American lives on the battlefield with
&gt; &gt; their &quot;lust for power.&quot;

&gt; &gt;  Retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, coalition commander in 2003 and
&gt; &gt; 2004, called the Iraq war &quot;a nightmare with no end in sight,&quot; for
&gt; &gt; which he said the Bush administration, the State Department and
&gt; &gt; Congress all share blame.

&gt; &gt; Sanchez told a group of military reporters in Arlington, Virginia, on
&gt; &gt; Friday that such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean
&gt; &gt; immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not
&gt; &gt; been held accountable.

&gt; &gt; He said the Iraq war plan from the start was &quot;catastrophically flawed,
&gt; &gt; unrealistically optimistic,&quot; and the administration has not provided
&gt; &gt; the resources necessary for victory, which he said the military could
&gt; &gt; never achieve on its own.

&gt; &gt; Still, he said, the U.S. cannot pull out of Iraq without causing chaos
&gt; &gt; that would have global implications.

&gt; &gt; &quot;After more than four years of fighting, America continues its
&gt; &gt; desperate struggle in Iraq without any concerted effort to devise a
&gt; &gt; strategy that will achieve victory in that war torn country or in the
&gt; &gt; greater conflict against extremism,&quot; Sanchez said.

&gt; &gt; Sanchez pointed to what he said was &quot;neglect and incompetence at the
&gt; &gt; National Security Council level&quot; which has put the U.S. military into
&gt; &gt; &quot;an intractable situation&quot; in Iraq.

&gt; &gt; &quot;We appreciate his service to the country. As General Petraeus and
&gt; &gt; Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is
&gt; &gt; being made in Iraq. And that's what we're focused on now.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Sanchez, who retired in 2006, said it was his duty to obey orders and
&gt; &gt; not object publicly when he was on active duty, but now that he is
&gt; &gt; retired he has an obligation to speak out.

&gt; &gt; &quot;While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their
&gt; &gt; reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,&quot; he said.

&gt; &gt; The administration, he said, has ignored messages from field
&gt; &gt; commanders that warned repeatedly that &quot;our military alone could not
&gt; &gt; achieve victory&quot; without corresponding help from the State Department.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Our National leadership ignored the lessons of World War Two as we
&gt; &gt; entered into this war and to this day continue to believe that victory
&gt; &gt; can be achieved through the application of military power alone,&quot; he
&gt; &gt; said.

&gt; &gt; &quot;From a catastrophically flawed, unrealistically optimistic war plan,
&gt; &gt; to the administration's latest surge strategy, this administration has
&gt; &gt; failed to employ and synchronize its political, economical and
&gt; &gt; military power,&quot; he said.

&gt; &gt; Sanchez said the current strategy, which included a &quot;surge&quot; of troops
&gt; &gt; into Iraq, was &quot;a desperate attempt by the administration that has not
&gt; &gt; accepted the political and economic realities of this war and they
&gt; &gt; have definitely not been able to communicate effectively that reality
&gt; &gt; to the American people.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &quot;Too often, our politicians have been distracted and they have chosen
&gt; &gt; loyalty to their political parties above loyalty to the Constitution
&gt; &gt; because of their lust for power,&quot; he said.

&gt; &gt; Congress, he said, has failed its job of oversight.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Who will demand accountability for the failure of our national
&gt; &gt; political leadership involved in the management of this war,&quot; he said.
&gt; &gt; &quot;They have unquestionably been derelict in in the performance of their
&gt; &gt; duty. In my profession, these types of leaders would be immediately
&gt; &gt; relieved or court-martialed.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Sanchez was pessimistic about the chances of victory in Iraq unless
&gt; &gt; there is a major change in commitment.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Continued manipulations and adjustments to our military strategy will
&gt; &gt; not achieve victory,&quot; he said. &quot;The best we can do with this flawed
&gt; &gt; approach is stave off defeat.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &quot;There is no question America is living a nightmare with no end in
&gt; &gt; sight,&quot; he said.

&gt; &gt; The nightmare will not end, he said, until the partisan struggle for
&gt; &gt; power in Washington ends.

&gt; &gt; &quot;National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics
&gt; &gt; that have prevented us from devising an effective, executable and
&gt; &gt; supportable strategies,&quot; he said. &quot;At times, these partisan struggles
&gt; &gt; have led us to political decisions that endangered the lives of our
&gt; &gt; sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was
&gt; &gt; that political power had greater priority than our national security
&gt; &gt; objectives.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &quot;Overcoming this strategic failure is the first step toward achieving
&gt; &gt; victory in Iraq,&quot; he said. &quot;Without bipartisan cooperation, we are
&gt; &gt; doomed to fail. There is nothing going on today in Washington that
&gt; &gt; would give us hope.&quot;

&gt; Of course Sanchez is critical of the administation and the war.  In
&gt; practically any discussion of the poor execution of the early stages
&gt; of the war, it is pointed out that HE was the commander of US forces
&gt; at the time.  Plus, any discussion of the current successes make it
&gt; plainly clear that his successor is doing things right.  He HAS to
&gt; blame someone else, or else he has to accept most of the
&gt; responsibility himself.

&gt; Sanchez was a terrible commander and his predecessor has turned out to
&gt; be a genius who's turning things around.  No big surprise that he's
&gt; passing the blame to someone else.

&gt; Please don't misunderstand, Bush has plenty to answer for.  But,
&gt; Sanchez's word isn't the definitive word on this.  He's just whining
&gt; to deflect blame from himself.  I give his rantings no credence
&gt; whatsoever.

McConnell, Pelosi Agree on Iraqi Govt. Failures
While McConnell Believes Congress Will Compromise on Kids' Health Care,
Pelosi Not So Sure
By MARY BRUCE
Oct. 14, 2007 -

Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., this morning admitted that &quot;the
central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment.&quot;

It's an assessment he said he shares with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif.

&quot;I'd have to say that I agree with her,&quot; McConnell said in a &quot;This Week with
George Stephanopoulos&quot; interview. &quot;They've not been able to produce any of
the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for.&quot;

In a separate interview, Pelosi blamed the Iraqi government for not making
the necessary changes to bring the war to a close.

&quot;The purpose of the surge was to create a secure environment in which the
political change to end the sectarian violence could succeed,&quot; she said.
&quot;Why should our troops be risking their lives in a civil war that, even when
we intervene and create the room for them to make change, they refuse to do
it?&quot;

McConnell, idiot-Ky, then goes on - incredibly, as in absent any credibility
or proof - to state that the &quot;surge&quot; is working.

In fact, here are his subsequent words:

&quot;Violence is dramatically down,&quot; he said. &quot;There's just simply overwhelming
evidence to that effect. And most of us have not given up. We believe we can
win. And my definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war
on terror. I think we're making significant progress toward that end.&quot;

You see Gunner, if the Iraqi people won't assume the responsibility for
running their own country this &quot;surge&quot; isn't doing anything worth
accomplishing. It sort of resembles the bush regimes prior stumbling,
bumbling and locker room/frat boy nonsense. Nonsense, BTW, that has been
extremely costly in every way and which hasn't, won't and can't produce
anything but more of the same.

How, exactly, is that &quot;working&quot; or succeeding?

Really?

The Clintons, to adapt a line from Dr. Johnson, were not only corrupt,
they were the cause of corruption in others. Yet seldom in America
have so many come to excuse so much mendacity and malfeasance as
during the Clinton years. Here are some of the facts that have been
buried.

RECORDS SET

- The only president ever impeached on grounds of personal malfeasance
- Most number of convictions and guilty pleas by friends and
associates*
- Most number of cabinet officials to come under criminal
investigation
- Most number of witnesses to flee country or refuse to testify
- Most number of witnesses to die suddenly
- First president sued for sexual harassment.
- First president accused of rape.
- First first lady to come under criminal investigation
- Largest criminal plea agreement in an illegal campaign contribution
case
- First president to establish a legal defense fund.
- First president to be held in contempt of court
- Greatest amount of illegal campaign contributions
- Greatest amount of illegal campaign contributions from abroad
- First president disbarred from the US Supreme Court and a state
court

* According to our best information, 40 government officials were
indicted or convicted in the wake of Watergate. A reader computes that
there was a total of 31 Reagan era convictions, including 14 because
of Iran-Contra and 16 in the Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development
scandal. 47 individuals and businesses associated with the Clinton
machine were convicted of or pleaded guilty to crimes with 33 of these
occurring during the Clinton administration itself. There were in
addition 61 indictments or misdemeanor charges. 14 persons were
imprisoned. A key difference between the Clinton story and earlier
ones was the number of criminals with whom he was associated before
entering the White House.

Using a far looser standard that included resignations, David R. Simon
and D. Stanley Eitzen in Elite Deviance, say that 138 appointees of
the Reagan administration either resigned under an ethical cloud or
were criminally indicted. Curiously Haynes Johnson uses the same
figure but with a different standard in &quot;Sleep-Walking Through
History: America in the Reagan Years: &quot;By the end of his term, 138
administration officials had been convicted, had been indicted, or had
