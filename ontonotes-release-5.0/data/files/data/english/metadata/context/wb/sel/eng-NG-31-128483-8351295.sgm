General Joe Smith for President - 1844

TIMES AND SEASONS
CITY OF NAUVOO
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1844.
WHO SHALL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT?

This is an enquiry which to us as a people, is a matter of the most
paramount importance, and requires our most serious, calm, and
dispassionate reflection. Executive power when correctly wielded, is a
great blessing to the people of this great commonwealth, and forms one
of the firmest pillars of our confederation. It watches the interests
of the whole community with fatherly care; it wisely balances the
other legislative powers, when overheated by party spirit, or
sectional feeling; it watches with jealous care our interests and
commerce with foreign nations, and gives tone and efficacy to
legislative enactments. The President stands at the head of these
United States, and is the mouth-piece of this vast republic. If he be
a man of enlightened mind, and capacious soul-if he is a virtuous man,
a statesman, a patriot, and a man of unflinching integrity; if he
possess the same spirit that fired the souls of our venerable sires,
who founded this great commonwealth, and wishes to promote the
universal good of the whole republic, he may indeed be made a blessing
to community. But if he prostrates his high and honorable calling, to
base and unworthy purposes; if he makes use of the power which the
people have placed in his hands for their interests, to gratify his
ambition, for the purpose of self-aggrandizement, or pecuniary
interest; if he meanly panders with demagogues, looses sight of the
interests of the nation, and sacrifices the union on the altar of
sectional interests or party views, he renders himself unworthy of the
dignified trust reposed in him, debases the nation in the eyes of the
civilized world, and produces misery and confusion at home. 'When the
wicked rule, the people mourn.'
There is perhaps no body of people in the United States who are at the
present time more interested about the issue of the presidential
contest, than are the Latter Day Saints. And our situation in regard
to the two political parties, is a most novel one. It is a fact well
understood, that we have suffered great injustice from the State of
Missouri, that we have petitioned to the authorities of that state for
redress in vain; that we have also memoralized congress, under the
late administration, and have obtained the heartless reply that
'congress has no power to redress your grievances.' After having taken
all the legal, and constitutional steps that we can, we are still
groaning under accumulated wrongs. Is there no power anywhere to
redress our grievances? Missouri lacks the disposition, and congress
both lacks the disposition, and power and thus fifteen thousand
inhabitants of these United States, can with impunity be dispossessed
of their property, have their houses burned, their property
confiscated, many of their numbers murdered, and the remainder driven
from their homes, and left to wander as exiles in this boasted land of
freedom and equal rights, and after appealing again and again, to the
legally constituted authorities of our land for redress, we are cooly
[coolly] told by our highest tribunals, 'we can do nothing for you? We
have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars into the coffers of
congress for their lands, and they stand virtually pledged to defend
us in our rights, but they have not done it. If a man steals a dollar
from his neighbor, or steals a horse or a hog, he can obtain redress;
but we have been robbed by wholesale, the most daring murders have
been committed, and we are cooly told that we can obtain no redress.
If a steam boat is set on fire, on our coast by foreigners, even when
she is engaged in aiding and abetting the enemies of that power, it
becomes a matter of national interference, and legislation; or if a
foreigner, as in the case of McLeod, is taken on our land and tried
for supposed crimes committed by him against our citizens, his nation
interferes, and it becomes a matter of negotiation and legislation;
but our authorities can calmly look on and see the citizens of a
county butchered with impunity;-they can see two counties dispossessed
of their inhabitants, their houses burned and their property
confiscated, and when the cries of fifteen thousand men, women and
children salute their ears, they deliberately tell us we can obtain no
redress. Hear it therefore ye mobbers! proclaim it to all the
scoundrels in the Union! let a standard be erected around which shall
rally all the renegadoes of the land; assemble yourselves, and rob at
pleasure; murder till you are satiated with blood, drive men women and
children from their homes, there is no law to protect them, and
congress has no power to redress their grievances, and the great
father of the Union has not got an ear to listen to their complaints.
What shall we do under this state of things? In the event of either of
the prominent candidates, Van Buren or Clay, obtaining the
presidential chair, we should not be placed in any better situation.
In speaking of Mr. Clay, his politics are diametrically opposed to
ours; he inclines strongly to the old school of federalists, and as a
matter of course, would not favor our cause, neither could we
conscientiously vote for him. And we have yet stronger objections to
Mr. Van Buren, on other grounds. He has sung the old song of
congress-'congress has no power to redress your grievances.' But did
the matter rest here it would not be so bad. He was in the
presidential chair at the time of our former difficulties. We appealed
to him on that occasion, but we appealed in vain, and his sentiments
are yet unchanged. But all these things are tolerable in comparison to
what we have to state. We have been informed from a respectable
source, that there is an understanding between Mr. Benton of Missouri;
and Mr. Van Buren, and a conditional compact entered into, that if Mr.
Benton will use his influence to get Mr. Van Buren elected, that Van
Buren when elected, shall use his executive influence to wipe away the
stain from Missouri, by a further persecution of the Mormons, and
wreaking out vengeance on their heads, either by extermination, or by
some other summary process. We could scarcely credit the statement,
and we hope yet for the sake of humanity, that the suggestion is
false; but we have too good reason to believe that we are correctly
informed.
If then this is the case can we conscientiously vote for a man of this
description, and put the weapons in his hands to cut our throat with?
we cannot; and however much we might wish to sustain the democratic
nomination we cannot-we will not vote for Van Buren. Our interests,
our property, our lives and the lives of our families are too dear to
us to be sacrificed at the shrine of party-spirit, and to gratify
party feelings. We have been sold once in the State of Missouri, and
our liberties bartered away by political demagogues through executive
intrigue, and we wish not to be betrayed again by Benton and Van
Buren.
Under these circumstances the question again arises, who shall we
support? General Joseph Smith. A man of sterling worth and integrity
and of enlarged views; a man who has raised himself from the humblest
walks in life to stand at the head of a large, intelligent,
respectable, and increasing society, that has spread not only in this
land, but in distant nations; a man whose talent and genius, are of an
exalted nature, and whose experience has rendered him every way
adequate to the onerous duty. Honorable, fearless, and energetic; he
would administer justice with an impartial hand, and magnify and
dignify the office of chief magistrate of this land; and we feel
assured there is not a man in the United States more competent for the
task.
One great reason that we have for pursuing our present course is, that
at every election we have been made a political target for their
filthy demagogues in the country to shoot their loathsome arrows at.
And every story has been put into requisition to blast our fame, from
the old fabrication of &quot;walk on the water&quot; down to &quot;the murderer of ex-
Governor Boggs.&quot; The journals have teemed with this filthy trash, and
even men who ought to have more respect for themselves; men contending
for the gubernatorial chair have made use of terms so degrading, so
mean, so humiliating, that a billingsgate fisherwoman would have
considered herself disgraced with. We refuse any longer to be thus
debaubed for either party; we tell all such to let their filth flow in
its own legitimate channel, for we are sick of the loathsome smell.
Gentlemen, we are not going either to &quot;murder ex-Governor Boggs,&quot; nor
a mormon in this state for not giving us his money;&quot; nor are we going
to &quot;walk on the water;&quot; nor &quot;drown a woman;&quot; nor &quot;defraud the poor of
their property;&quot; nor send &quot;destroying angels after Gen. Bennet to kill
him;&quot; nor &quot;marry spiritual wives;&quot; nor commit any other outrageous act
this election to help any party with, you must get some other persons
to perform these kind offices for you in the future.-We withdraw.
Under existing circumstances we have no other alternative, and if we
can accomplish our object well, if not we shall have the satisfaction
of knowing that we have acted conscientiously and have used our best
judgment; and if we have to throw away our votes, we had better do so
upon a worthy, rather than upon an unworthy individual, who might make
use of the weapon we put in his hand to destroy us with.
Whatever may be the opinions of men in general, in regard to Mr.
Smith, we know that he need only to be known, to be admired; and that
it is the principle of honor, integrity, patriotism, and philanthropy,
that has elevated him in the minds of his friends, and the same
principles if seen and known would beget the esteem and confidence of
all the patriotic and virtuous throughout the union.
Whatever therefore be the opinions of other men our course is marked
out, and our motto from henceforth will be General Joseph Smith.
PUBLIC MEETING
On Friday evening last a public meeting was held in the room over
Joseph Smith's store, at which public address, of General Joseph
Smith's, to the citizens of the United States was read by Judge
Phelps. The address is certainly an able document, big with meaning
and interest, clearly pointing out the way for the temporal salvation
of this union, shewing what would be our best policy, pointing out the
rocks and quicksand where our political bark is in danger of being
wrecked, and the way to escape it and evincing a knowledge and
foresight of our political economy, worthy of the writer.
Appropriate remarks were made by several gentlemen after the reading
of the address.

The Warsaw Signal - February 21, 1844

TO JO SMITH -- Prophet -- Candidate for the Presidency -- Mayor of the
City of Nauvoo -- Lieutenant General of the Legion -- President of the
Church -- Tavern Keeper -- Grog Bruiser -- &amp;c., &amp;c.

Sir: Understanding that you are a candidate for the highest office
within the gift of the People, we claim as the unalienable right of an
American Citizen to ask you a few questions, as regards the policy
which you, as &quot;His Excellency, the President of the United States,&quot;
will pursue.

Well Jo! if you should be so fortunate as to be elected President of
the United States, what would you do with the State of Missouri? Would
you pluck out the eyes of her soverignty? Or would you take her up in
your expanded arms, and giant-like stride across the Western Prairies
-- leap the Rocky Mountains and hurl her headlong into the angry
Pacific, there to remain until purged of every Anti-Mormon sin? Or Jo,
would you Xerxes-like muster your myriads, and every man armed with a
hoop-pole, march across the icy bridge in winter time, and give her
Sovereign Highness, a most transcendent drubbing?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the manner in which you write to J. C. Calhoun, we conclude that
">

you had some design of chastising Missouri, and we would like to know
how you are going to do it, and so no doubt would the people of that
State.
