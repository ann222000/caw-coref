Considering how much time I have spent on Second Life, I should
consider actually applying for that job.  I am actually a bit of a
cheerleader for Home anyhow.  What they should do is produce a
partnership with Linden Labs, and rebrand Home as Second Life Home on
the PS3.  Just an idea.  Linden Labs has a lot of experience with
that.

Sony is busy trying to rip off Linden Labs. Why are they going to give them
a piece of the pie NOW? Well, not that you can call the PS3 a &quot;pie&quot; now.
Maybe a nice little apple tart...

I think they should just get the game launch part working. And release it.
All the other crap can just be upgrades or user created content.

Actually there is a case of seeing a good idea and changing it to fit
what the PS3 wanted.  The idea for Second Life type worlds are
appearing more and more.  Each with different twists and so on.  I
believe MTV is creating one.  All can coexist.  I believe Second Life
is like a perpetual beta state for people to try new ideas.

I do HIGHLY suggest Sony get Tringo on Home.  That would draw a lot of
attention, particularly if it is played like it was on Second Life
(think Bingo meets Tetris with a bunch of people) rather than turning
it into a dumbed down single player experience.
