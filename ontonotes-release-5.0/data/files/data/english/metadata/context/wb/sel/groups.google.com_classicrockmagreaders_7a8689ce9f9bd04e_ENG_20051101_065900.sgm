According to a story published in the October 18, 2005
edition of the Metro newspaper, a British teenage
heavy metal fan has been handed a community service
order for wearing an offensive t-shirt.

Adam Shepherd, 19, was reportedly convicted under new
anti-hate laws which ban people from displaying
religiously insulting signs.

The teenager was arrested after a woman complained to
police when she saw his shirt, which promotes extreme
heavy metal band CRADLE OF FILTH.

The t-shirt shows a picture of a nun in a pornographic
pose. On the back is a comment about Jesus

The top was being worn by Shepherd's girlfriend when a
police officer approached her. As soon as the teenager
realized there was a problem, he told the officer it
was his and swapped tops with his girlfriend. But he
refused to take it off or cover it up and was
arrested.

Shepherd, who bought the shirt in his hometown of
Weymouth, Dorset, admitted the charge. Weymouth
magistrates gave him 80 hours community service and
told him to pay £40 costs (approx. $71).

Meanwhile, MediaWatchWatch.org.uk reports that Adam
&quot;can't have been prosecuted under the 'new anti-hate
laws' because they do not exist.&quot; However, a bit of
research shows that the wearing of this T-shirt has
led to at least two previous convictions in the U.K.

Dale Wilson, 35, of Norwich, was arrested by two
police officers as he walked to the newsagents on
Halloween 2004. He pleaded guilty to &quot;religiously
aggravated offensive conduct.&quot; He was eventually
discharged and told to &quot;grow up.&quot; He paid £150 costs
(approx. $266), and the judge ordered that the T-shirt
be destroyed.

Back in 1997, Rob Kenyon, 29, of London was found
guilty of committing the offense of &quot;Profane
Representation under the 1839 Act&quot; by Bow Street
Magistrates Court. He was fined £150.

CRADLE OF FILTH drummer Nicholas Barker was also
arrested in Dover and charged with &quot;creating a public
disorder&quot; for wearing the same t-shirt. There were no
further proceedings against him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the NME: In 2001, the then-Lord Provost of

"/> Glasgow, Alex Mosson, campaigned to have the t-shirt
prevented from being sold at Tower Records. The record
shop was raided on two occasions by police, and
eventually agreed to stop stocking the garment. The
Catholic League of America, back in 1998 (amusing
&quot;Victory for Sickos&quot; story) and 1999 (their call to
action), also complained bitterly about the t-shirt.

Oh this story tears me in two. On one hand the censorship (and the
free publicity for Cradle of Filth) is repugnant. On the other hand,
arresting Cradle of Filth fans doesn't sound like too bad an idea.

Hi Muttley - can't say I agree with you on this one. Whilst I don't
generally agree with censorship, there are some areas where I think it
can be justified. Freedom of speech is something that should be
treated in an adult manner, it shouldn't involve displaying offensive
slogans, whether of a religious, racist or sexist nature.

Personally, I find those CoF t-shirts offensive, and I'm usually fairly
broad-minded - there's nothing wrong with a T-shirt with a band name,
logo, album cover, whatever, on it, but not at the expense of
decency... I don't know what the logo said, but the picture of a &quot;nun
in a pornographic pose&quot; isn't something that should be seen by
children.

However, if it results in their arrests, I agree, all CoF fans should
be forced to wear them!!

Uli

I take your point regarding the image and I guess I had been thinking
about the message on the t-shirt rather than the picture. I also
fully agree that freedom of speech should come with responsibility, but
it should also allow people to say the unsayable. The price of free
speech is that people can say things that we don't want to hear. You
and I will both have individual feelings about everything under the sun
- some will coincide and some won't. Whose value set do we base our
decisions on when we make a decision as to what is and what isn't
'offensive' ?

It is a shame that this freedom is cheapened by goons like Cradle of
Filth who actually have nothing to say but are going about getting
cheap publicity from the shock value.

A fair point well made, Muttley. It's good to hear everyone's opinions
about something other than Classic Rock, without going completely off
the subject. In fact, having looked at a few other Google groups, I
have to say that this is the one which seems to stimulate the most
fair-minded and intelligent debate.

Oops wrong button!

I was going to say that to be fair to that Dream Theatre site it does
have some entertaining ranting about how Rush are the most evil force
on earth.

And it is nice to talk about other stuff occassionally.

This story has even got into the local paper hear in advance of their
gig in Newcastle before Christmas - local church groups outraged etc
etc. How dim can these people be? The gig would have passed off with
no interest from anyone except their fans - now they're giving them a
ton of free publicity. Ticket sales'll probably go through the roof.
People who've never heard, or heard of, them will be going. Come to
think of it - someone who's never heard them is probably the easiest
person to sell a ticket to.

That'll be the local media trying to stir up a storm in a teacup so
they got a headline for the next edition then!
