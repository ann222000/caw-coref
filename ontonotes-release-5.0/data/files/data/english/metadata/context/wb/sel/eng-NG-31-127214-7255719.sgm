The Raiders and Lions have fallen on hard times and show no signs of
being able to get up. But there is always hope, particularly when a
team finds its franchise quarterback. The Colts found theirs 10 years
ago when they drafted Peyton Manning, and he paid his Super Bowl
dividend in Miami against the Bears.

The Raiders and Lions could go for quarterbacks with the Nos. 1 and 2
picks. JaMarcus Russell is picking up steam as the potential No.1 pick
in the draft, but Brady Quinn could slip quite a bit if the Lions
don't draft him with the No. 2 pick. However, it will be hard to pass
on Quinn on Draft Day, knowing that letting a potential game-changing
player slip through their fingers will only add to their agony.

TEAM    NAME    POS.    HT.     WT.     COLLEGE
1. Raiders      JaMarcus Russell        QB      6-5     253     LSU
His powerful arm and athleticism make him an intriguing prospect for a
team with very little going for it. If Al Davis decides Russell is the
real deal, he will be put in the very difficult position of getting
this franchise back on its feet quickly. Russell has a fluid throwing
motion and great confidence. Rookie coach Lane Kiffin and the Raiders'
No. 1 choice might establish an immediate bond, knowing that they are
in a very tough situation and will have to depend on each other.

2. Lions        Brady Quinn     QB      6-4     228     Notre Dame
Although this seemed like a solid pick a month ago, Matt Millen is
having all kinds of thoughts about Joe Thomas and Gaines Adams. The
selection of Quinn probably would make the ticket-buying public happy,
but Millen needs to turn things around this year if he wants to
survive. Then again, we were saying the same thing a year ago.

3. Browns       Adrian Peterson RB      6-2     220     Oklahoma
We are hearing Peterson probably will run a 4.35-4.37 40 at the
combine or during his pro day workout. How can the Browns not go after
a stud back like Peterson? They have been going with blue-collar,
working class guys and their running game has been average or below
average. If Peterson stays healthy, he has the strength, speed,
quickness and instincts to become a great one.

4. Bucs Alan Branch     DT      6-6     327     Michigan
A huge man who can shut down the interior run and collapse the pocket
from the middle. If Joe Thomas is still available here, it will give
Jon Gruden something to think about, but this defense needs help in
the worst way. His height could be an issue because smaller offensive
linemen have the ability to leverage.

5. Cardinals    Gaines Adams    DE      6-5     257     Clemson
If Calvin Johnson is still on the board, the Cardinals could trade
down in a two-for-one trade. New coach Ken Whisenhunt is clearly an
offense-minded leader, but the Cardinals were 29th in total yards
allowed and need a butt-kicker on defense. Adams should be a
difference maker as long as he is motivated. Some scouts feel he could
take it easy once he has his payday.

6. Redskins     Joe Thomas      OT      6-7     310     Wisconsin
The Redskins developed a tradition of having great offensive linemen
when Joe Gibbs was winning Super Bowls in his first go-round with the
Redskins, and Thomas certainly would fit in with the ancient Hogs.
Thomas is a big, strong man who has been very consistent as a run
blocker throughout his career and has improved steadily as a pass
blocker.

7. Vikings      Calvin Johnson  WR      6-4     226     Georgia Tech
A dramatic impact player who has prototype size, speed and leaping
ability. Johnson is similar to Houston's Andre Johnson, who led the
NFL with 103 receptions. Calvin Johnson is big, physical and tough and
plays his best when the game is one the line. He can overpower nearly
every cornerback he will face.

8. Texans       Levi Brown      OT      6-4     324     Penn State
A big, physical tackle with excellent durability and natural
attributes. He can control a pass rusher with his long, strong arms
and has a powerful base. He is climbing the charts following a strong
showing at the Senior Bowl both on the field and off. Brown has
emotional maturity and seems like he will be able to handle the
adjustment to the next level.

9. Dolphins     Leon Hall       CB      5-11    193     Michigan
A great technician who can mirror the best receivers because of his
work ethic and skills. He runs well, but Hall is not a true burner for
the position. New coach Cam Cameron will be tempted to go after Dwayne
Jarrett, but the Dolphins need new blood on the defensive side and
Hall is too good a player to pass up.

10. Falcons     Dwayne Jarrett  WR      6-5     213     USC
The Falcons could make a move up in the draft so they can select
Johnson, but if they don't, Jarrett seems like a fine pick. Michael
Vick has poor weapons at the receiver position, and coach Bobby
Petrino wants to install a complex offense that relies on the medium-
range pass. Jarrett is not only a top-notch receiver, but he has
improved steadily throughout his career.

11. Niners      Amobi Okoye     DT      6-2     317     Louisville
Tremendous upside on a player who is only 19. Great quickness and
instincts, Okoye can take over at his position and cause havoc with
his quickness. Bigger guards could cause problems, but his first step
and moves should make him a productive player.

12. Bills       LaRon Landry    FS      6-2     208     LSU
A knockout hitter who has the intelligence, instincts and physical
talent to change a game around. Landry will fly to the football and
make plays. He is a versatile player who can also play corner or
strong safety. Buffalo coach Dick Jauron is a former defensive back,
and Landry will allow him to turn that area into a strength for the
Bills.

13. Rams        Jamaal Anderson DE      6-6     272     Arkansas
It would be tough to find a player who improved as much through his
college career as Anderson. The 2006 season was especially strong as
he became a first-team All-SEC player with 47 tackles and 14.5 tackles
behind the line of scrimmage. Quickness and a strong first step are
attributes, but is a bit inexperienced, with just 19 starts at
defensive end.

14. Panthers    Ted Ginn Jr.    WR      6-0     182     Ohio State
A huge playmaker who can give his team a lift as a wide receiver or a
return man. Ginn times well for the stopwatch, he is fast into and out
of his cuts and is an improved route runner. The Panthers are
desperate to take some of the pressure off Steve Smith, and Ginn has
the ability to do it.

15. Steelers    Paul Posluszny  LB      6-2     235     Penn State
A very instinctive player who will outwork the competition. After his
knee injury following the 2005 season, he came all the way back by the
midway point of the 2006 season. Explosive hitter with outstanding
range. He plays with intelligence and emotion. At times will be too
aggressive and overrun a play.

16. Packers     Marshawn Lynch  RB      5-11    221     Cal
Lynch has the speed to be a difference maker for a long time. In
addition to being able to bust the long play, there is an innate
toughness about him. He will often make has best runs after taking a
big hit. He could be a great fit for a Packers team that could use
some new blood at the running back position.

17. Jaguars     Sidney Rice     WR      6-4     205     South Carolina
He disappointed Gamecocks coach Steve Spurrier with his decision to
declare, but he is a big, physical receiver who can make the tough
catch in traffic and has also shown he can make big plays when the
game is on the line. The Jaguars have a huge need at receiver and Rice
can turn this position from a weakness to a strength in a hurry.

18. Bengals     Reggie Nelson   FS      6-0     193     Florida
A big-time hitter who came into his own after a brilliant 2006 season
with the national champion Gators. Nelson has the kind of instincts
that could make him a top player at the position. He has the quickness
to close on the ball and make big plays and throws his body around
with abandon to stop the run. He also has the mindset to be an asset
on special teams.

19. Titans      Dwayne Bowe     WR      6-2     222     LSU
A big-time, big-game receiver who emerged as a playmaker this season.
Excellent size and strength, and he uses those advantages to win the
battle against smaller defensive backs. Has fine speed to run away
from defenders and the power to break tackles. Very good-to-excellent
hands. Not super quick off the line of scrimmage.

20. Giants      Darrelle Revis  CB      6-0     194     Pittsburgh
A skilled performer who excels in man-to-man coverage with range and
solid hands. Revis plays his best against top competition. If he had a
bit more speed and athleticism he would be viewed as a can't miss
performer. The Giants secondary rarely stopped anyone last season
(28th in passing yards allowed), and Revis appears to be the right
fit.

21. Broncos     Aaron Ross      CB      6-0     192     Texas
The tragic death of Darrent Williams gives the Broncos an urgent need
at this position, but even if that weren't the case, he has too much
athletic ability and upside to let him pass. Ross was a gambling
playmaker at Texas, but playing next to Champ Bailey could be a great
learning experience.

22. Cowboys     Lawrence Timmons        OLB     6-3     232     Florida State
Wade Phillips will get an opening gift from Jerry Jones. Timmons has
all the athletic ability that scouts want and has the kind of
quickness off the snap to cause impact plays. However, he will
misdiagnose plays and overrun the ball from time to time. Phillips may
have a few issues as a head coach, but he understands how to get the
most out of linebackers.

23. Chiefs      Ben Grubbs      G       6-3     312     Auburn
A hard-working player who has shown improvement. Very strong and
powerful and has learned to move his feet very well for a young
interior lineman. Powerful hands that can stun or redirect a pass
rusher. The Kansas City offensive line needs a serious infusion of
youth.

24. Patriots(from Seattle)      A.J. Davis      CB      5-10    190     N.C. State
While the Patriots have clear needs at receiver, Bill Belichick and
G.M. Scott Pioli love to do the unexpected. Belichick always values
corners with speed and instincts and that means Davis is his kind of
player. Excellent leaping ability and balance, but isn't physical or
effective against the run.

25. Jets        Zach Miller     TE      6-5     260     Arizona State
The Jets will have to be tempted by a quarterback, but Chad Pennington
has plenty left in the tank, and a tight end like Miller will help him
out. Miller does not have eye-popping speed, but knows how to get
open, make the tough catch in traffic and make big plays in the
clutch.

26. Eagles      Anthony Gonzalez        WR      6-0     195     Ohio State
Donovan McNabb needs some weapons to work with, and Gonzalez is a hard-
working and skilled receiver who will help him quite a bit. Gonzalez
is not necessarily a home run hitter, but he runs outstanding routes
and has special hands. If the Eagles make the right move here and take
Gonzalez, he'll get plenty of action and should become a fan favorite
among a group that is never easy to please.

27. New Orleans Patrick Willis  MLB     6-2     235     Mississippi
Clearly the best middle linebacker in the draft. He should be able to
start right away and stop the run because he is big, thick and mean.
However, he is not the pass defender he needs to be at the next level
and must show improvement in coverage.

28. Patriots    Craig Davis     WR      6-1     203     LSU
An all-around football player who will block like a demon on plays
where he doesn't get the ball downfield. He is strong in the upper
body and can get out of tackles. He wants the ball and has the speed
to go deep. A bit headstrong and wants to do it his way. That changes
the instant he shakes hands with Bill Belichick.

29. Ravens      Antonio Pittman RB      5-11    197     Ohio State
An opportunistic running back who can get the tough yards in the
middle or break the big play to the outside. Although he has been
overshadowed at Ohio State by players like Troy Smith, Anthony
Gonzalez and Ted Ginn Jr, Pittman can make big plays when it matters
most. He has a chip on his shoulder and if he thinks he is being
disrespected, he will make his
opponent pay.

30. Chargers    Adam Carriker    DE     6-6     295     Nebraska
A solid but unspectacular player who is especially strong against the
run. He has excellent balance and quick hands that allow him to win
the battle against bigger offensive linemen. He would be an
outstanding fit for the Chargers' 3-4 scheme. Not the fastest off the
line of scrimmage but extremely hard working and effective.

31. Bears       Robert Meachem  WR      6-3     212     Tennessee
Great size and speed combination for a team that has lacked big-time
playmakers at the wideout position for years. Meachem has the look and
feel of a great deep threat. He has long arms, gets deep in a hurry
and extends well for the ball. He is strong enough to run through
tackles. Needs some work on his ability to make plays in traffic.

32. Colts       Anthony Spencer DE      6-3     264     Purdue
Strong upper body and very good straight-line speed. He has the kind
of hands needed to fight through blocks and dominate against the run.
Has shown significant improvement in his pass rush ability and has
shown that early concerns about his work ethic are no longer an issue.
