Trees Won't Fix Global

The plan to use trees as a way to suck up and store the extra carbon dioxide
emitted into Earth's atmosphere to combat global warming isn't such a hot
idea, new research indicates.

Scientists at Duke University bathed plots of North Carolina pine trees in
extra carbon dioxide&lt; http://www.livescience.com/environment/070329_non_co2.html &gt;every
day for 10 years and found that while the trees grew more tissue, only
the trees that received the most water and nutrients stored enough carbon
dioxide to offset the effects of global warming.

The Department of Energy-funded project, called the Free Air Carbon
Enrichment (FACE) experiment, compared four pine forest plots that received
daily doses of carbon dioxide 1.5 times current levels of the greenhouse gas
in Earth's atmosphere to four matched plots that didn't receive any extra
gas.

The treated trees produced about 20 percent more biomass on average, but
since water and nutrient availability differed across the plots, averages
don't tell the whole story, the researchers noted.

&quot;In some areas, the growth is maybe five to 10 percent more, and in other
areas it's 40 percent more,&quot; said FACE project director Ram Oren of Duke
University. &quot;So in sites that are poor in nutrients and water we see very
little response. In sites that are rich in both, we see a large response.&quot;

These differences are key since the weather isn't always cooperative with
human needsâ€”if a drought takes hold, trees won't be able to do much in the
way of carbon storage&lt; http://www.livescience.com/environment/070214_carbon_storage.html &gt;.

&quot;If water availability decreases at the same time that carbon dioxide
increases, then we might not have a net gain in carbon sequestration,&quot; Oren
said.

Fertilizing forests to spur more carbon dioxide
uptake&lt; http://www.livescience.com/technology/070501_carbon_capture.html &gt;is
impractical, Oren added, because of the ramifications to the local
environment and water supply.

&quot;In order to actually have an effect on the atmospheric concentration of CO2,
the results suggest a future need to fertilize vast areas,&quot; Oren said. &quot;And
the impact on water quality of fertilizing large areas will be intolerable
to society. Water is already a scarce resource.&quot;

The results of the study, presented yesterday at a national meeting of the
Ecological Society of America, also noted that only a few parts of a tree
will store carbon for long periods of time.

&quot;Carbon that's in foliage is going to last a lot shorter time than carbon in
the wood, because leaves decay quickly,&quot; said Duke graduate student and
project member Heather McCarthy. &quot;So elevated CO2 could significantly
increase the production of foliage, but this would lead to only a very small
increase in ecosystem carbon storage.&quot;
