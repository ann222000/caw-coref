As the old saying goes, 'Ignorance is Bliss'. Well that is not

The Gift Of Love Comes Custom Wrapped In Many Different Packages
Copyright (c) 2007 Siobhan Gamble

How beautiful is it to see two people happily in love? When true
love is present, it's essence it is especially hard to overlook;
even to those on the outside looking in. Have you ever been out
somewhere in the public with the one you love and catch a glimpse
of a stranger smiling in your direction? How about having
complete strangers approach you, marveling at how happy and
beautiful look together and encouraging you to continue loving
each other that way? It can be a most fulfilling experience to
love and be loved just as much in return; a blessing that
everyone hopes to receive at some point in their lifetime.

Unfortunately, it doesn't always happen that way, which is why
the saying goes &quot;It is better to have loved and lost than to
never love at all&quot;. We should all learn to take full advantage
of love when it comes our way. With that said, love can sometimes
show up in ways we don't expect. Love holds no prejudice of any
kind, but a sad thing is that some of us do. Not only does this
narrow minded mentality cheat some of us out of fully reaping the
rewards of love, but it sometimes puts a strain on the lives of
those who choose to embrace love the way it was given to them.

As stressful as it already is finding and maintaining happiness,
interracial couples are especially prone to a higher degree of
stress. A few main factors play a part, such as,

* Racial combination: For some odd reason, very few Caucasians
have a problem with anyone who enters a relationship or marries a
Native American, Hispanic, Oriental, or Mid-Easterner. The
problem comes when anyone who isn't black being coupled with
someone who is. The attitude is stemmed from racial bigotry that
has its roots in slavery. Blacks are still looked down upon by
some in our society who have convinced themselves that they are
somehow superior. The idea of white and black being romantically
involved seems too far fetched for their narrow minds, making it
impossible to see that true love holds no bounds.

As far as the black community is concerned, there is indeed a
double standard floating around. It is often viewed as acceptable
for a man of color to engage in relationships with white women.
On the other hand, Black women who show an interest in white men
are showed very little appreciation by other black men and women.
This shallow state of mind is ludicrous.

* Family and friends: A lot of times, one or both families of
the interracial couple will have a problem with them dating
outside of their race. Although couples can find ways to get
around such hurdles, it often finds ways to causes tension in
relationships. Friends of people involved in interracial
relationships may also have issues which will usually either
cause the friendship to come to an end or affect the relationship
to a point where it can no longer be saved.

* Biracial Children: For years, it has been argued that the
offspring of multiracial relationships will not be accepted by
either race. This isn't necessarily true. Those who have
multiracial heritages ARE accepted and have a better
understanding and well rounded view of love as being colorblind.
These beautiful children of such relationships have the advantage
of living and learning two completely different cultures, and
possibly languages.

Regardless of these problems, there will definitely be natural
issues that arise between those who enter into interracial
relationships. It is sad to say, statistics show that the length
of the average marriage nowadays less than seven years. I believe
it has a lot to do with bad choices in partners. It is very
important to marry someone who suits you well; otherwise the road
to happiness will be anything but happy. Although there are
things that are ultimately out of our control, there are some
things that we can do to ensure our own happiness.

One of the best things that we can do for ourselves is pay close
attention when choosing a life partner. Strong relationships,
especially interracial relationships need compatibility and
commitment from both partners. It is much more than sharing the
same interests, or having the same likes and dislikes; it's
about believing the same things and wanting the same things out
of life.

Choosing the wrong life partner will not only affect you, but
your future children as well. We all want to share our lives with
someone whom we can connect to on the deepest level and enjoy a
true partnership; someone who will treasure, love and adore us as
well as protect and support us. But many chose to sacrifice
because they do not have the patience to wait for such a person
to come along. It takes a well disciplined person to ask
themselves which is more important; be lonely for awhile until
the right person comes along, or settle with being happy for the
moment, dealing with whatever consequences surface from it?  Here
are 10 steps that can help you to either maintain the happiness
in your relationship, or help you find the love you have been
waiting for:

1. Love yourself first. If you don't love yourself properly, how
can you expect anyone else to love you the way you want them to?
You are the one who has to set the example for them.  By being
good to yourself, you are secretly demanding others to be good to
you as well.

2. Remember, there is nothing more sexy than confidence. It is
the lock and key to being successful in true love. When you are
confident, you are fulfilled and that alone is attractive.

3. Never allow your happiness to depend on others. You MUST be
able to find happiness in yourself before you can be completely
happy in a relationship. The way that you feel on the inside is a
reflection of what is seen on the outside.

4. Make sure your spirituality is in good health. Ask yourself if
you are emotionally and spiritually prepared to love and accept
another human being. If you aren't, it is imperial that you take
some time to nurture your spiritual side. This is very
important.

5. Always stay true to your values and never compromise them for
anyone. By doing this, you will protect yourself from unnecessary
pain

6. Never, ever, ever chose a mate out of loneliness, financial
insecurity, or any other need. This also goes for choosing to be
with a person out of fear of the future. When don't feel
positive about yourself or your life, you are almost certain to
make the wrong choice.

7. Have you ever heard the saying, &quot;good things come to those
who wait?&quot; Well the same thing applies to love. &quot;True love
comes to those who wait&quot;. Many people forget that destiny is
predetermined. You have to be patient and not settle for second
best if you don't want to miss out on you potentially perfect
match. Patience, patience, patience! Sometimes it may take years
before the right person shows up, and sometimes that is due to
lessons that you may need to learn before you are ready. Focus on
becoming the person you want to attract and see how much faster
you will connect with the right person.

8. If you are not happy, respected or fulfilled in your present
relationship, what is the point of staying? Yes, breaking up is
hard to do but free each other so that you can find more
compatible people.

9. Avoiding sex before commitment is the best way to test a
relationship's potential. Once sex is introduced into a
relationship, it becomes harder to be objective.

10. Last but not least, you have to be healthy in order to
receive healthy love. If you are not at peace with yourself, your
relationship isn't going to go smoothly. Being healthy in mind,
body and spirit radiates confidence and will also help guide you
in making healthy choices when it comes to choosing and
attracting a life partner.

As the old saying goes, &quot;Ignorance is Bliss&quot;. Well that is not
particularly true in the case of jumping into relationships with
people who you do not know very well. Taking it slow and being
open to the gift of love, regardless of what color package or
size it is in will ensure a life of happiness, even against the
odds.
