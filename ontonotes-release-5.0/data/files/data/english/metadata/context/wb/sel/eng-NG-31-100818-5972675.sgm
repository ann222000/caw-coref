A bachelor fellow named Ward,
A pretty young woman, adored,
He took her to dine,
And he plied her with wine,
And when he took her home, she was floored.

Or bitter failure:
But when he took her home, she was bored

Don't spoil it, it was a good pun,
Needing clarificationing none.
No need to explain
To those with a brain,
Who all from it got them some fun.

For Don, I'll explain it some more:
When he walked her in through the door,
Ol' Ward never led
Her straight to his bed...
He laid her right there on the floor.

I fear, Don that you never had
That one "special talk" with your Dad
'Bout the birds and the bees,
Or a sexual disease,
So, maybe, it's time now, my lad.

Though explaining the first poem needs not;
For th' revision a little help is sought.
The setup the same,
The man was too lame,
To fulfill the entendre first brought.
