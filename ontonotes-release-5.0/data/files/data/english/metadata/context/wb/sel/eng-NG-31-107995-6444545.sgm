Hello group,

I was wondering how many of you hone your lathe and milling tools. I
have often honed lathe tools and very occasionally, milling cutters,
when the corners get dull. But, I'm wondering about technique. I use a
diamond hone, mounted to a plastic handle (cheap). On lathe tools,
I'll radius the end as a final step, can't be more than a few thou...
starting from the cutting face and sweeping to make the radius on the
nose. I expect this leaves lateral lines along the cutting face,
crossing out the vertical grinding marks. Input?

Thanks,

Doug

Although it _is_ "honing", I was taught "stoning".  I keep a 1-1/2" x 4" x
1/2" Arkansas hard stone for the same purpose.

For drawing out as fine a finish as possible on aluminum, nothing beats a
good stoning of the bit to a (relatively) high polish.

I have one of the little "EZE-LAP" diamond hones you're talking about, and
have never used it on my bits.  I'll bet it would take out the grinder marks
a lot faster than my stone... then finish up with the Clinton Rock... gotta
try it.

Works for me.
I find this a critical step in some operations to get the tool cutting
exactly as I want it.
I also use the same (cheap) diamond hone to touch up carbde tooling.

=============
As indicated on another thread, the easy way to do this is with
an abrasive bristle brush.  Chuck it up in your drill press, run
at slow speed and swipe the cutter or tool across it a few times.

I lifted this idea from a cnc Darex drill pointer that had a
"hone" option.

see

http://www.use-enco.com/CGI/INSRIT?PMAKA=240-3835&amp;PMPXNO=4840670&amp;PART...
most likely you ace hardware store has something suitable. You
want the fine [generally blue] bristle brush.

Me. Lathe tools (and some home-made milling bits).
I'm using a DMT combination file (one side 600 grit, other 1200; it opens
like a leatherman). Very happy with it. The diamond block is collecting
dust.
For polishing (if needed) I use some SuperFine ceramics stick. Really
astonishing how quickly you get a mirror-finish with them.

Yeah, I use a diamond hone for roughing out tools, a ceramic or
Arkansas stone afterwards for finishing and threading tools.  It does
make a difference.  You don't have to do the whole ground surface,
just the cutting edge.

I use an Eze-Lap brand diamond hone.

I radius across the face of the cutting edge then usually do a final
touch vertical, twisting the file on a light pass to clean up the edge.

If the tool geometry allows, I will often do a stroke across the top
face to clear any burrs.

I use a lot of HSS tools straight off the grinder too, if they pass
the feel test. (If it feels sharp,usually sticky sharp, it is sharp)

I have watched more than one guy put nice grinds on a tool, then spend
the next 15 minutes honing away any semblence of a cutting edge, through
poor technique, but the worst was the guy that was conviced that the
wheels on the two grinders were meant to be used in order, so he rounded
off what was left of the edge with the deburring wheel. :-/

It does make a difference.  Remember that any fine scratch on your tool
will show up on the piece you are cutting. Also it will reduce the
friction between the chip and the tool.

Thanks so much for the responses!

When I first tried honing (many years ago) I over did it and got poor
cutting action for my efforts. For a long time, I gave up honing until
just a few years ago. I don't remember why I tried it again., but I
remember thinking that I must be  rocking the tool while honing. To
minimize this, I tried to carefully, just clean up the edge. As
suggested by some of you, "just a lick, does the trick". With my lathe
tools, I hone three sides of the cutting corner and to look at the
bit, you might think that it was chipped or dull. But it definately
improves finishes and seems a lot sharper.

I'd be interested in hearing if any of you hone milling cutters. I
read a post some time ago (have lost the thread of course) where the
writer expounded on honing brand new end mills to bring them up to a
keen edge. Thoughts?

Thanks again gang, I always enjoy reading this forum!

I watched one guy grind the top of his tool rounded, he was rocking so
much. He insisted it was the way he was taught in school. We were shown
to take a single lick off each edge, just to knock back the burrs.

I just finished the tool grinding section of my course - and it agrees
with Trevor. Do the grind right, then one lick should take off any
burrs. And to re-hone, just a wipe or two - makes a difference when
going for a nice surface finish. No real point while your roughing
out, but excellent for finishing.(And I don't know what grade stone it
is (will have to find out, thanks for the reminder fellas) its one you
grab from the storeman  when it needs doing....can consistently get
1.6micron finish with a bit of practice..
