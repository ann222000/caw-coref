When is a Delegate Not a Delegate?

Lessons for Barack Obama

Barack Obama and his supporters are exuberant after their victories this
last weekend in the Washington and Nebraska precinct caucuses, in the
Louisiana primary and the Maine municipal caucus. But they would do well
to remember that since the mid-1970s the Democratic National Committee
has spent countless hours plowing firebreaks between expressions of the
popular will in such caucus and primary votes and the ultimate selection
of the nominee.

Take Alabama. On February 5, Super Tuesday, Obama won that primary in
convincing fashion by a margin of nearly 20 points. But when the dust
settled, he and Hillary Clinton ended up with an equal number of pledged
delegates from the state. Why? The delegates were proportioned according
to the votes in the state's 7 congressional districts and like all such
political real estate in the USA, these districts have been
gerrymandered to corral the black vote in as small a number of districts
as possible. Result, Obama won 83 per cent of the black vote, but the
those numbers were concentrated in two or three districts so even though
Obama ran up 70-30 triumphs and Hillary battled to 55 to 45 margins of
victory, the count at the end of the day gave them the same number of
delegates each.

Another firebreak is the follow-on in many states, from caucus to state
convention. The current pattern is that Obamian enthusiasts go the
caucuses and delivery fiery speeches about their man and his dream of
change, rack up a substantial victory and head back to campus, aglow
with victory. But then the party regulars regroup, the labor organizers
confer, and the party establishment strikes back at the state
convention, where those delegates pledged at the caucus are &quot;authorized&quot;
in a series of backroom deals.

Gary Hart learned this the hard way in 1984. Hart had won his political
spurs in a famous mutiny of the Democratic base, when Hart managed
George McGovern's successful drive to the nomination in 1972. In the
early states of the 1984 campaign Hart won a dramatic victory by ten
points over Walter Mondale in New Hampshire. Short on money, Hart then
aimed, exactly like Obama, at the caucuses to show momentum. After Super
Tuesday, Mondale and Hart were neck and neck. Then Hart cleaned up in
the caucuses, just as Obama is now doing. The two split the big states.
Mondale won New York and Pennsylvania. Hart won Ohio and California.
Then, in the weeks before the Democratic Party convention Mondale and
the Democratic Party machine went into action at the various state
conventions. Hart watched aghast as his hard-won delegates melted back
into the smoke-filled rooms and emerged with Mondale buttons on their
lapels. The coup de grace came with Mondale's efficient capture of the
Super Delegates, who went to him almost en bloc.

There was another powerful challenge in 1984, from Jesse Jackson. At the
early part of the campaign for the Democratic nomination Jackson won
five primaries and caucuses - Louisiana, Washington DC, South Carolina,
Virginia and Mississippi (which duly reversed Jackson's singular triumph
at the state convention.} Altogether, Jackson got 3.3 million primary
votes, 21 per cent of the total votes cast in the 1984 primaries and
caucuses. He ended up with precisely 8 per cent of the delegates.
Jackson bitterly denounced the process as a rigged affair that should be
reformed. Nothing has changed.

So although Obama has pulled even and on some counts is ahead in
delegates pledged to him thus far, these numbers are far from
conclusive.

In the Hillary camp we are witnessing the usual ritual following a bad
spell on the campaign trail. Patti Solis Doyle, Hillary's campaign
manager, has been shown the door and Maggie Williams installed in her
place. Meanwhile, Bill has been demoted to the telemarketing division of
the campaign, speed-dialing Super Delegates.

Still amid such flurries the basic strategy is in place. Hang on until
the big primaries in Ohio and Texas on March 4. Here Hillary is still
seen as having the advantage of organized labor in Ohio and of the
Hispanic vote in Texas. By and large union members are for Hillary, as
John Edwards sadly discovered. Bizarre though it may seem, given
Hillary's record as a corporate lawyer, there's a class divide between
her and Obama. Hillary has the support of the white working class. She
has also had a commanding edge in winning the votes of white women and
people over sixty. These are very formidable assets.

Jackson ran into that wall in 1988. The early part of the campaign was
one of the most exciting drives by an outsider in American political
history. Hart put himself out of contention by his nautical jaunt with
Donna Rice on the good ship Monkey Business. Jackson swept triumphantly
through the early primaries: Alabama, Washington DC, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Puerto Rico and Virginia. In the caucus states, he won
Delaware, Michigan, South Carolina, Vermont. (His caucus victories in
Texas and Alaska were once again diminished at the state conventions.)

By March of 1988 Jackson and Michael Dukakis, the uptight governor of
Massachusetts, were neck and neck. Jackson thought he had a good chance
of winning in Wisconsin, thus showing he could win a primary in an
industrial state with a big slice of white working class voters. Jackson
spent much time in the state, particularly on the picket lines outside
the American Motors plant, scheduled to shut down. Jackson compared the
struggle in Kenosha to the struggle in Selma in the 1960s. In the
polling before the Wisconsin primary Jackson had a substantial lead. His
hopes were dashed. In the last hours, in the privacy of the voting
booth, many of these white working class voters jumped to Dukakis. This
was the moment the wind went out of the Jackson campaign.

On the Republican side, the conservatives, distraught at the likelihood
of McCain being the nominee, are prophesying disaster in the November
vote. An internal assessment circulating though the Conservative
Political Action Committee meeting in Washington DC last week predicted
&quot;an epic landslide&quot; by the Democratic ticket similar to Lyndon Johnson's
obliteration of Goldwater in 1964. The memo attributed this likely
outcome to recession, the war in Iraq and a terrible candidate.
Republican senator Thad Cochrane has openly said he trembles at the
thought of an unstable McCain in the Oval Office with his finger on the
nuclear trigger. Whoever the Democratic nominee is, McCain should be
easy meat, with scores of victims of his savage onslaughts ready to
testify to his frenzied personal onslaughts and profanity-laden tirades.
By insisting on using the word &quot;gooks&quot; about the Vietnamese, he's
already well on the way to losing the Asian-American vote. To an
electorate opposed to the war in Iraq by some 70 per cent, he
enthusiastically prophesies a century of war.

Against this distasteful and manic figure Mike Huckabee continues his
challenge. Five days after the press, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani and
Fred Thompson bowed in surrender and hailed McCain as the nominee,
Huckabee this weekend won a primary in Louisiana, and caucuses in
Kansas. He came in a very close second in the disputed caucuses in
Washington state, where the Republican party chairman, Luke Essers,
simply cut off the vote as soon as McCain nosed ahead of Huckabee by a
200 vote margin, with 15 per cent of the votes still to be counted. When
asked why he has declined to run up the white flag of surrender,
Huckabee said jovially, &quot;You never know, McCain might have a macaca
moment&quot;, referring to the ethnic slur that doomed Senator George Allen
in the Virginia race in 2006.

He may be right.
