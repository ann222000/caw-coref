Dear list members,
who are fortunate to live near
an ocean shore, could you give me an advise:

Where can I buy an antique (vernier) sextant?
If you know decent shops, please give me addresses.

I know two shops in the West coast (very far from each other:-(
and one in the East
coast. I am considering traveling there (just for this purpose)
but I understand that one or two shops is not enough to
justify such a long travel.

e-bay seems to be out of old sextants.
I carefully follow it for 3 months and only ONE good vernier sextant
vas listed during this time. And I missed it:-( Â I understand that
the usual shops charge about twice or three times that the e-bay does,
but I am willing to pay the price.

There are Internet shops too. I know 3 of them.
2 in England and 1 in the West coast. None of them is willing to send
photos, or give other details. (I understand them. They do business,
their time is valuable, and they understand little about sextants,
digital photography and Internet. Most of these three whould not
even bother to reply your e-mails).
So the only option is to visit the shops.

That's why I am asking for recommendations.

Alex.
