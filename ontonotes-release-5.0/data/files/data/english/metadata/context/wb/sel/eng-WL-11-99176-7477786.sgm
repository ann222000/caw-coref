Three followup points on yesterday's demonstrations. The first is the press coverage. The San Jose Mercury News , located where a demonstration occured, gave it extensive and front page coverage, and no doubt that was true in other cities with the largest demonstrations. But on a day when more than a million people demonstrated nationwide, USA Today , a paper whose very name proclaims it is the paper of the nation, couldn't find room for the story on its front page. Others emphasized the negative, like the article in the Washington Post headlined "At Immigrant Rally, Divided They Stand - Call for Work Boycott Breeds Disagreement." Still others minimized the economic effect of the boycott, making absurd statements like this one leading the second paragraph of The New York Times story: "The demonstrations did not bring the nation to a halt as planned by some organizers." On the broadcast media, the most notable thing was how quickly this story disappeared from the rotation. I have seen several items today about immigration as an issue, but despite the fact that plenty of good, interesting footage is available (compare it to, say, the "Duke rape story," about which for all intents and purposes no footage is available), I don't believe I've seen a single shot of a demonstration today on any channel.

The second followup point, which is also about the press coverage in a way, is to note that there is no way at this time to know the complete extent of what happened yesterday. San Jose appears to have been the third largest demonstration in the country (I was mistaken yesterday saying San Francisco was larger), yet outside of the San Jose Mercury News and the San Francisco Chronicle , I haven't seen footage of nor read about that demonstration anywhere. But demonstrations didn't just occur in large cities. Here's an article about a demonstration of 5,000 in the upstate New York town of Newburgh, population just 29,000 (36% Hispanic)! How many more demonstrations like that occured which flew under the national radar?

The third point is relevant to these first two, and it's also completely self-evident yet perhaps the most important point of all - yesterday was a work day!!! Most of those million-plus people demonstrated on a day that wasn't a holiday or a weekend, during work hours!!! There have been days on which more people demonstrated in this country (e.g., against the Vietnam war), but I doubt there has ever been anything close to this number of people taking off work to demonstrate on any issue. Not one news source that I have read or seen explicitly mentioned this point.

Excellent post. Sacramento had an estimated 15,000 to 18,000 (police) or 36,000 to 40,000 (organizers) take part.

And, as you said in your earlier post about the San Jose march, there were no buses in Sacramento, either. The overwhelming majority of the marchers were local.

Yesterday was a historic day, an unprecented event in the annals of protest and civil rights.

Not surprising that the tone deaf mainstream media (who, before May 1st, were pushing the notion that a boycott was a bad idea) still hasn't registered the significant of it.

Did you know this, about actions across the border? Fantastic.

"But let me also say that it wasn't just local or national. It was also international. The border -- the 2000-mile border, it was shut down by Mexican people on the other side, and there was also a national boycott called in Mexico that it's estimated at tens of millions that boycotted McDonald's, Wal-Mart, and so on, and so on." by Javier Rodriguez on Democracy Now today.

This is a quote from the segment linked below. In fact all the segments today are worth checking out.

The people are way ahead of the mostly clueless media on this. However, the LA Times did have major coverage today, it was all over their front and home pages.

Illegeal immigrants should have no rights in the US.

They are felons.

They should be deported, and US corporations who hire them should be severlely punished.

Illegal migrant with problems? Take it up with your HOME country! It's high time for Sr. Fox to step up to the plate and help out his own citizens, instead of blaming the US for his and his country's shortcomings!

And it's even higher time for the US government to stand up for US citizens! Why does our government insist on selling us out to greedy corporations, only looking for the next buck?

Excuse me, I have to go and puke now.

I'm going to ignore the rest of your comment, Joe, and I hope others do the same, but I'll respond to this:

Why does our government insist on selling us out to greedy corporations, only looking for the next buck?

Why? Because the government is the greedy corporations, or at least their representatives. That's what capitalist democracy is all about, Joe. Government of the corporations, by the corporations, for the corporations.

I recall the scapegoating of "illegals" during the last World War. Back then they called them "Jews."

If only the protests were branded with the correct color. The media all jumped to support the "Orange Revolution."

If so, this is definitely the "White Revolution." Somewhat ironic since most of the people are brown!

I defied convention to wear a black T-shirt with a picture of Che and the "Fund Human Needs, Not the War Machine" slogan. It was a good decision though. Lots of thumbs up. After all I stood out anyway, so why not go all the way?

Eli said,

Well, I guess nobody got my sarcasm in that post. I thought it was pretty loud and clear.

Sorry if I offended anyone.
