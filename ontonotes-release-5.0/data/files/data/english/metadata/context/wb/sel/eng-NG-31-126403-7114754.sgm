I need to make some prints with my HP B9180 that will be placed in plastic
page protectors.  I've noticed that sometimes photocopier toner sticks to
the inside of the page protectors.
Will an inkjet print do the same thing?
I know it's not toner, but I don't know if the ink will stick to the plastic
over time.

Thanks,

Jeff

IMHO this is caused by the plasticiser in the covers bonding with the
toner. Ink jet has a similar problem with the ink migrating into the
cover sheet. Suggest you try several brands of protector, stick with
matched paper and ink, and make sure the prints are really really dry
before inserting.

I think I'd be inclined to laminate the print if you are trying to obtain
long term protection.

Laminating prints may protect from some elements but is no guarantee of
protection from the laminate and adhesive itself, nor light and other
fade promoters.

In general plastics which do not involve plasticizers, such as mylars,
and those indicated as "archival" are unlikely to cause ink migration.
vinyls including PVCs are some of the worst.
