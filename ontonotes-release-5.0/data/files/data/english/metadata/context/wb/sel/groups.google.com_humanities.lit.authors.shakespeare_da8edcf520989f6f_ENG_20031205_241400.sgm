Sir Everard Digby

Born: 16 May 1576 or 1578
Died: 30 January 1606, St. Paul's Churchyard, London

&lt;&lt;On Monday, 4 November, Digby was in position with over 100 others
at the Red Lion Inn at Dunchurch. This group included his uncle
Sir Robert Digby, Humphrey and Stephen Littleton, John Grant,
John Wintour, Henry Morgan and Father HAMMOND, &amp; 7 servants.

On the arrival of his bedraggled and exhausted co-conspirators from
their desperate flight from London on the evening of the 5th,
Catesby told Digby that the plot was discovered, but

&quot;though the field be lost, all is not lost&quot;,

and they decided to try to proceed with the uprising.

On hearing of these plans, many in the hunting party, his uncle Sir
Robert Digby included, were shocked and quickly departed, although
a vast majority of them remained. Given the circumstances, it seems
unlikely that Catesby would have told him that the King and his Chief
Minister, Robert Cecil, were both dead, as it would have required the
cooperation of all of the other conspirators to pull it off. Digby then
told his servant &quot;but now there is no remedy&quot;, and a servant at the
inn overheard him say &quot;I doubt not but that we are all betrayed&quot;.

On the band's flight towards Wales, they made detour to break into
the stables at Warwick Castle, and then they stopped at Norbrook at
about three in the morning for breakfast and to collect arms that
Grant had stored there. During their brief stay, Digby and Catesby
composed a letter which they sent with Thomas Bates to Father GARNET
who was with Lady Digby at Coughton Court, to advise them of what
had happened, to &quot;excuse their rashness&quot; and to for assistance.
GARNET naturally refused, but Tesimond was persuaded
to come to their aid and help his friend Catesby.&gt;&gt;

John Milton: Paradise Lost BOOK I

If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light
Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest
From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew
The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage
Can else inflict do I repent or change,
Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind
And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,
That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,
And to the fierce contention brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,
His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,

And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or yield:
And what is else not to be overcome?

That Glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,
Since through experience of this great event
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,
Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.

Academics help date Macbeth by refering
to the following line in the Porters scene

&quot;Who committed treason enough for God's sake,
but could equivocate to heaven.&quot;

This they tell us, was the trial of the Jesuit priest
Henry GARNET who took part in the Gun Powder plot.

Macbeth Act 2, Scene 3

Porter Here's a knocking indeed! If a
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
old turning the key.

[Knocking within]
Knock,
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
swear in both the SCALES against either SCALE;
who committed treason enough for God's sake,
yet could not equivocate to heaven:
O, come in, equivocator.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've discovered that Strats who specialize in Macbeth are
&gt;&gt;&gt; in agreement that an official pamphlet co-authored by
&gt;&gt;&gt; Francis Bacon and his first cousin Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and 'edited and approved' by King James himself before
&gt;&gt;&gt; being sent to the 'royal printers,' is an essential source
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the tragedy Macbeth.

How do you know that it was co-authored by Bacon &amp; Cecil?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The pamphlet written by Bacon and Cecil went through
&gt; three printings. The first was entitled:

&gt; A True and Perfect Relation of the proceedings at
&gt; the several Arraignments of the Late Most
&gt; Barbarous Traitors. It had James I's ornament
&gt; opposite the title page and was 'imprinted at
&gt; London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most
&gt; Excel-lent Maiestie. Anno 1606.'

&gt; It was given a more expansive title in the second
&gt; printing:

&gt; A True and Perfect Relation of the Whole
&gt; proceedings against the late most barbarous
&gt; Traitors, GARNET a Jesuite, and his Confederats;
&gt; Contayning sundry Speeches delivered by the Lords
&gt; Commissioners at their Arraignments, for the
&gt; better satisfaction of those that were hearers, as
&gt; occasion was offered; The Earle of Northamptons
&gt; Speech having bene enlarged upon those grounds
&gt; which are set downe. And lastly all that passed at
&gt; GARNETs Execution.'

&gt; The second edition included Northumberland's 250-page
&gt; speech that wasn't ready for the printer when the first
&gt; edition was rushed to press which probably justifies
&gt; one scholar calling it a 'small book.' The third edition had
&gt; minor changes in the title but all three were published by
&gt; the royal printer with James I's impresa.

&gt;&gt; Is there an online text we can refer to?

Child's History of England by Charles Dickens CHAPTER XXXII

It was the fifteenth of January, before the trial of Guy Fawkes,
and such of the other conspirators as were left alive, came on.
They were all found guilty, all hanged, drawn, and quartered:
some, in St. Paul's Churchyard, on the top of Ludgate-hill; some,
before the Parliament House. A Jesuit priest, named HENRY GARNET,
to whom the dreadful design was said to have been communicated,
was taken and tried; and two of his servants, as well as a poor priest
who was taken with him, were tortured without mercy. He himself
was not tortured, but was surrounded in the Tower by tamperers
and traitors, and so was made unfairly to convict himself out of his
own mouth. He said, upon his trial, that he had done all he could
to prevent the deed, and that he could not make public what had
been told him in confession - though I am afraid he knew of the
plot in other ways. He was found guilty and executed, after a
manful defence, and the Catholic Church made a saint of him; some
rich and powerful persons, who had had nothing to do with the
project, were fined and imprisoned for it by the Star Chamber; the
Catholics, in general, who had recoiled with horror from the idea
of the infernal contrivance, were unjustly put under more severe
laws than before; and this was the end of the Gunpowder Plot.
------------------------------------------------------------------

After John Wilkes Booth fired a fatal shot into the back of President
Lincoln's head, he jumped from the box to the stage of Ford's Theater in
Washington shouting &quot;Sic Semper Tyrannis,&quot; the motto of the Commonwealth
of Virginia. As he leapt, his boot caught in some bunting causing him
to break his left leg upon landing. He fled the city with a
co-conspirator, David Herold, and eventually ended up trapped by
soldiers while hiding in a barn at Richard GARNET's farm in ...

The _other_ guys are the Gunpowder plot co-conspirators
to whom the quote: &quot;though the field be lost, all is not lost&quot;

Coincidence?

What the field really is is optional:

&lt;&lt;[Digby] did not have much of an interest in politics however, and being a
strong and well-built young man with a passion and ability for field sports,
he spent most of his time on his estates pursuing his love of hunting,
horses and hawking. As was common for the time, he and his new stepfather,
Mr. Erdeswick, became involved in lawsuits brought by his tenants for
enclosing land.&gt;&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then again, the more I look at any line of Milton's, the more unsure I am
&gt; what it means. So thinking about my post, I'm starting to worry that it's
&gt; actually really obvious that the line is ironic, that the line really is
&gt; saying &quot;all is lost,&quot; but that the line is said by someone who's
(basically)
&gt; in denial, and that I'm putting myself with Satan _even more_ when I admit
&gt; publicly that I have read the line as non-ironic. (Ironic, because look
at
&gt; how many times he says &quot;lost&quot; and tries to persuade himself otherwise. He
&gt; wants to say &quot;lost&quot; but doesn't want to agree that &quot;lost&quot; is the right
word.
&gt; Obviously, he knows in his heart that he's lost but doesn't want to admit
&gt; it.) [*] So here I would be, telling everybody that I think I'm winning
but
&gt; I've really lost, if I pretended I knew what you wrote in the first post
on
&gt; this thread. But I'm going to post this anyway.

&gt; * - This sounds like something Stanley Fish has said or would say, but I
&gt; don't remember whether Stanley Fish _did_ say it, in anything I've read.
He
&gt; might have, and I might be remembering something I've read, rather than
&gt; thought of myself, so I'm going to footnote him. I can check, if anyone's
&gt; interested.

Who's Stanley Fish?

It works for me; if you type it in make sure you have:

&quot;ev_digby.htm&quot; not &quot;ev digby.htm&quot;

You don't need to connect to understand that Milton was using an actual
quote from 1606 (supposedly). Why would an epic poet do such a thing?
