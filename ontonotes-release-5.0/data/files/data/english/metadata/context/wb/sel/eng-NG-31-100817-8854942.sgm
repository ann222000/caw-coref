A man and a woman were asleep like two innocent babies. Suddenly, at 3
O’clock in the morning, a resounding noise came form outside...

The woman, sort of bewildered, jumps up from the bed and yells at the
man:
- “Shit!, that must be my husband!”

So the guy quickly got out of bed , scared, and naked. He jumped out the
window like a crazy man, smashed himself on the ground, went through a
thorn bush, then he stood up and started to run fast to his car.

Just a few minutes later he returns and tells the woman:
- I’m your husband, you slut!!!

So the woman answers:
- Oh, yeah?!! And why were you fucking running?!! You son of a bitch!
