13-30 with a Dura Ace RD?

I have a friend with a new bike with Shimano D/A 10 and using an FSA Compact
crank (34-50).  She originally built the bike up using a D/A 12-27 cassette
but after a challenging hilly century decided she could really use one more
gear.  Before we went out on another hilly ride I mounted a Campy wheel with
a 13-29.  With only minor adjustments I had it shifting great with no cross
chain problems going big/big or small/small.

She was very happy with the lower gearing but I am unable to locate a
Shimano compatible 13-29 for her Shimano wheel (Zipp hubs).  I have found a
13-30 cassette here: http://www.mcmwin.com/components.htm though it is a
bit pricey.

The two options I am looking at is buy a Campy cassette body for her Zipp
hub and run a Campy 13-29 or buy the 13-30 Shimano.  I know I am already
pushing it by using a 13-29 on her D/A RD.

Any thoughts on which way to go here?

If she really needs a lower gear than a 34x27, I'm sure she be better
served with a triple setup. Closer ratios and lower gears. Converting
would cost more than a new cassette, but in the long run might make
more sense. Unless she has plans to get much stronger reasonably soon,
in which case I'd suggest just suffering with the 27 for the time
being.

You could theoretically do this with a custom Miche cassette. 29t
Shimano-pattern cogs apparently exist for this although they may be
somewhat unicorn-esque. If you can find a dealer who bought into the
Miche system enough to buy the really expensive cog boards, they might
have them. The problem with this though is that the cassette would be
non-spidered and therefore may not play nice with the fancy Zipp
freehub.

SRAM and IRD both have Shimano-pattern 11/28 cassettes, plus a 12/28
from IRD.

Mark:  my recommended solution:

Go to your favorite mail-order website.  Nashbar will do.  Order the Shimano
105 12-27 10-speed cassette.  Only the 105, as what I'm recommending will
not work with Ultegra or Dura-Ace units.  Also order a cheap 9-speed
Shimano-compatible mountain cassette with a 30 tooth cog.  The 11-34 tooth
Nashbar unit will do.  Any number of speeds is fine, since you're only going
to scavenge the biggest cog or cogs.  Again, cheaper is better, as this plan
will not work with XT and XTR cassettes with the integrated cog carrier.

When you have these, use the appropriate small hex key to remove the rivets
to pull apart the 105 and mountain cassettes.  Replace the 27 with the 30.
The result will be a big jump between the 25 and 30 cogs, but this is only
used occasionally as a bail-out gear.  Chuck the rivets - they are
unnecessary.

BTW: On one of my bikes I run a double chainring setup (52-42 rings) with a
24-34 jump to my bail out gear, and it worked surprisingly well.  And this
is with a Shimano 105 short cage derailleur.  With this setup, you have to
be careful about chain length and really screw-in the B-tension, but it
works.  If you are worried about the capacity of the Dura-Ace rear
derailleur, then buy a Shimano mountain derailleur, such as Deore.  It is
compatible with the Dura-Ace 10-speed shifters.  No reason why you could not
assemble a 12-34 10-speed cassette for the really tough hills.

You may need a new chain.  Make sure that you have enough chain length for
this to work in the big-big ring/cog combinations.

If you're clearing the 29 cog easily, then I think the 30 will be
fine. I have a long cage 7703 D/A running an 11-30 cassette with
triple cranks. In my opinion, if long cage 30 with triple works, short
cage 30 with double cranks should as well. If you can find a cheap old
11-30 XT 8-speed cassette, mount that first to check it. It won't
index correctly, but you'll be able to check derailer capacity.

I'm fairly certain that the DA Rear Der can ONLY handle a 27 cog.
What I just did for a friend was buy an IRD Cassette (12-32) through
Harris Cyclery and swap over to an XT Rear Der.  Worked perfectly.

Someone already mentioned Miche cogs.  I've done pretty much this set
up with a stock Ultegra 12-27, but with a triple and a long cage
derailleur (which was already on my bike).  Not sure if the *short*
cage Dura Ace derailleur has enough capacity, but IIRC Sheldon seems
to think so.

IIRC I had to remove the original 12 and 13t from the stock Ultegra
cassette, and replace that with a 13t &quot;first position&quot; cog from
Miche.  So you need to buy a Miche 29t and 13t (first position), if
you would like to try this.  Don't forget to lengthen the chain by a
few links.  The whole mod cost me less than $10, and I'm grateful to
the LBS that stocked the Miche cogs.

This is more complicated to describe than do.  Trust me, you'll be
happy with the results.

One small point.  The Nashbar 11-34 9 speed cassette does not have a
30 tooth cog.  It's cog pattern is not the same as a Shimano 11-34.
It's last two cogs are 28-34.  I found that out after ordering one.

105 has an alloy spider for the three biggest cogs, just like DA and
Ultegra. So you'd need to add the 30T cog and a spacer on the back
side of that spider, and ditch the 16t cog. That actually makes better
jumps, anyway, though: 12-13-14-15-17-19-21-24-27-30.

Shimano tells you that, because they don't make cassettes with big
cogs between 28 and 31 teeth, and 32 probably is too big.

Same thing with Campy - 9 speed mechs said max cog was 28, because
that was the biggest 9 speed cog they made. When they went to 10
speed, they added a 29. Same mech is now max cog 29.

IRD 12/32.  You will likely have to add 1 link/1&quot;/2pins to the
existing chain.  The only problem, which is minor, is that the chain
will drag in the small/small combination.  Nothing breaks and you can
just shift into a proper gear and avoid the chain from rubbing the
bottom of rear derailleur in the 34/12 combination.

I don't beleive what you suggest will work with Shimano 10 cassettes.
The largest cog is different than the others and overhangs the hub a
bit.  You will find that the smallest cog will have no slots to
engage.
