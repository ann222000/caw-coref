Soldiers salute General's comments on web forumBy Devika Bhat
The call from General Sir Richard Dannatt that British forces should leave Iraq "sometime soon" has met with overwhelming support on the unofficial Army Rumour Service website, which includes forums where officers can air their views anonymously.
NI_MPU('middle');  Many express shock about the frankness of his words and there are several references to Sir Richard’s "moral" courage in speaking his mind, as well as calls for the Prime Minister to take heed of his remarks.
"...I am thoroughly heartened by this and have the beginings [sic] of a thaw in the cynicism which has dogged my service thinking since 2003," admits Jim_P_Pulfrew.
"I hope Blair is listening," says user Nigegilb. "Sir Richard has made the call and said it how it is. Good on him. Stand by for incoming. Getting out of Iraq is essential if [Afghanistan] is going to work in the long run. God knows what will happen to Iraq, not sure it will be any worse though. He made the point that we were never invited in we kicked the door in.
Nigegilb asks: "Can someone close to Sir Richard tell him that if he gets sacked he should run for office against whoever is the PM at the time. He will win by a landslide."
"Sir Richard, I'm saluting you right now!," says Purple_Flash. "It's about time someone of your standing actually lived up the Values &amp; Standards that we so often pay lip service to. They are what should make us a breed apart; thank you for walking the walk rather than talking the talk."
Some are less diplomatic in their praise for Sir Richard and criticism of the Government. "He's [Sir Richard] got a hell of a pair of moral b***s on him, I'll give him that! I imagine B'liar is in a bit of a cold sweat/hot rage now," says 303SMLE.
"Politicians can't grasp the idea of someone telling the truth, they'll all just assume he is chasing some kind of agenda. (Arguably, pursuing the truth and bringing the boys home is his agenda!) This might turn out to be one of those moments when the world turns and Governments fall; I certainly hope so!"
Brewmeister adds: "I think even Teflon Tony is going to find it difficult to weasel his way out of this. If Sir Richard goes it's time for a coup."
Stooge notes: "I don't think his comments will 'fall on deaf ears'. I'm pretty sure there are hundreds of people in Whitehall who have by now heard about his comments and panicing [sic]. At the very least some of them will have a sleepless night trying to make this seem less ‘bad’.

"Also, this isn't someone with a political agenda. He's looking out for his own men. Even the public will see that."
It is not just the Government which comes under criticism over Iraq. Hereward says: "A real leader of men has spoken for once. Forget the feeble Mr Cameron and the non-existent Mr Campbell, the general is indeed the true moral voice of opposition in this country."
Many say the comments were long overdue and call for the Army to gather in support of Sir Richard should his position come under threat. "After years and years, AT LAST someone at the top, who makes the headline on the news, has had the b***s to stand up and be counted," says Brandt. "If he gets the sack, watch out for fireworks- If he has had the balls to stand up for us, we should do the same."
DigitalGeek adds: "The General has laid down the gauntlet to the Government. It is now time that we stood behind him." Drop_Short adds: "It is about time that our senior generalship actually stopped being part of the government and stood up for what is in the best interests of the Service. Bring on the revolution"
Even the few users critical of Sir Richard are keen to acknowledge that they agree with his apparent stance on Iraq. PassingBells writes: "Accurate and welcome though these comments are, they are not the sort of remarks that should be made publically [sic]. They are exactly what the CGS [Chief of the General Staff] should be saying privately…I fear that this smacks of naivity [sic] of his behalf and a serious lapse on behalf of his minder(s)."
Most users though, are wholly supportive of the General’s comments. At the time of writing, an ongoing poll on the site claimed that of 126 users, 78 per cent think he is "absolutely right", while only three per cent voted "he had to resign first before making such a statement".
