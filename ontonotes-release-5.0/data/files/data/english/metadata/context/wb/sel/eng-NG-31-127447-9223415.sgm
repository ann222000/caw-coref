Testimony For Sale

It was only years after Prince left his religion, and after he had
descended back into a life of drug abuse, brushes with the law, and
financial destitution, that he started to invent tales about the
Church for personal profit.

What changed with Prince that he now recounts his experiences so
differently?

Jesse Prince and Ursula Caberta

Outside of the ethical atmosphere of the Church, and without his
Church friends to help him stay on the straight and narrow, Prince
reverted to his old, unethical habits. Having abandoned the
Scientology principles he had learned and applied successfully, he
soon found himself without friends and in desperate need of money.

The decline began in 1994. A Minneapolis Church staff member had
introduced Prince to a local Scientologist businesswoman who gave
Prince a well-paying job. He repaid this opportunity by sexually
harassing the female employees while his employer was out of town on a
business trip, to the extent that they filed complaints about him.
Prince also reverted to his pre-Scientology habits, abusing drugs and
conducting extramarital sexual affairs. Prince admitted to luring a
dozen employees of this company into his unethical behavior.

Despite his professed intention to be &quot;clean&quot; and avoid being fired,
Prince could not control himself for long. He began stealing from his
employer and reverted to using drugs and alcohol. When other employees
discovered his thefts, he resorted to threats of physical violence
against them. The police had to be called in to deal with the matter.

Prince's wife left him shortly thereafter. He apparently continued to
incur debts and, by early 1998, his life was in a shambles. He filed
for bankruptcy. At that time, out of work and in need of money for his
habit and his creditors, Prince concocted a plan to extort money from
the Church of Scientology. He hoped to be financially dissuaded from
lying to the media and selling himself as a &quot;witness&quot; for anti-
Scientologists.

When the Church did not bow to his attempted extortion, Prince then
made it clear that he intended to make such a public problem of
himself that the Church would relent and buy his silence.

Thus, in mid-1998, Prince sold his services to the hate group FACTNet.
At this time, the principals of FACTNet were being sued for unlawful
copyright infringement of Scientology materials; one legal action
against a FACTNet director had been adjudged in the Church's favor and
a second case, representing a multi-million dollar liability for
FACTNet, had progressed to a decisive stage. Prince found a ready
market as a paid witness for FACTNet's defense.

Prince proclaims altruistic purposes for his anti-Scientology
activities. If that were the case, he would do it for free.

Instead, in a period of only four months following his initial payment
for his concocted statement, Prince received cash, a car, and living
expenses worth well over $30,000.00. These payments were made in
return for the false statements in his testimony and as a fee for
working with a FACTNet director to get his claims publicized by the
media. After several months of peddling himself to the U.S. media,
only a couple of newspapers even quoted him.

Prince's attempts to pose as an expert witness have met with repeated
failure. In one sworn declaration Prince pretended to be knowledgeable
of copyright law and procedures but, when he was questioned about the
subject matter under oath, the depth of his ignorance was profound. In
another case, his declaration was found to be inadmissible.

This willingness to say anything for money, even to the extent of
falsely claiming legal expertise, is particularly revealing of his
motivation. A deposition taken on August 19, 1998 laid bare Prince's
utter lack of knowledge and expertise in the area, so much so that the
FACTNet defendants chose to settle the case for a permanent injunction
and a $1,000,000.00 judgment against them to be paid if they ever
violate the injunction, rather than face a trial with Prince as their
witness.

Note: To anyone lurking who doesn't know this story, for me it was one of
Scientology's sickest. They literally snuck on Jesse's property and planted
some grass......set him up, then called the cops on him. ((And they wonder
why the rest of the world *doesn't* seee their mafia-like actions as
religious?))

Scientology *loves* to promote how &quot;ethical&quot; they are. When you're
&quot;in&quot;---it's easy to buy, as it's part of the mind control,
you hear it all the time, it seems like it MUST be true, eh?

eeeeeeeeewwwwww----now if you'd like to compare critics debts compared to

Yeah........I've watched you all in court: That means NOTHING.
I'd take time to explain it, but no thanks. Google Jesse's name and read
