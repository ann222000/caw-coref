Hello all- Are screws neccesarily modern? Does anyone have any idea as to when
they first were made and when they may first have been used in furniture? The
point of the inquiry is to help determine how old an item can be if screws were
used in its assembly, i.e. if it can possibly predate the 19th century. Thanks
for any input.

I ahve found that wood screws with no tapered starting point, that is flat
ended wood screws, seem to date before the midd l9 th century. This is no
an expert's opinion but a practical note from my experience with old
furniture.
