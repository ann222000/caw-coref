Okay, Google, I can deal with a warning page for the sake of &quot;the
children&quot;...but when I DO click on the &quot;I am at least 18 years old&quot;
button, the page I seek never loads! Except sometimes--rarely--if I
click a buncha-muncha times! I'm not even looking for porn; I'm a gay
ADULT activist seeking to read and post on issues regarding homosexual
politics. (I don't quite know WHEN Google introduced their adult
warning page, but I only started running into it about a month ago.)

Note: see for yourself what I mean. Try loading this page:

http://tinyurl.com/25dyaz

which is supposed to access newsgroup &quot;alt.homosexual&quot;. See if you can
bypass the warning page! You're an adult, aintcha? But Google treats
you like an helpless child who needs corporate nannies to protect you
from the big bad wolves...some of whom are (gasp) QUEERS!

Unfortunately, these updated COPPA laws [ http://tinyurl.com/37zvh5 ]
blithely censor non-pornograhic/erotic sites as well, including gay
activist and news pages. This is OBVIOUSLY intentional, like the phony
War on Drugs used to persecute victimless crimes and other innocents.
In the case of COPPA, they are censoring more and more gay-friendly
web sites, forums, and chat rooms. In these NeoCon times, &quot;gay&quot; words
(like &quot;homosexual&quot;, &quot;bisexual&quot;, &quot;lesbian&quot;, &quot;LGBT&quot; and of course &quot;gay&quot;)
are part of COPPA's censorship, because right-wingers willfully CHOOSE
to define these words as intrinsically pornographic.

This is nothing less than relegating queers to 2nd-class citizenship,
well on the way to classifying homosexuals &quot;sub-human&quot;...which opens
the door to even GREATER persecution. Such as labeling us &quot;enemies of
the state&quot;, segregating us into ghettos, prisons and concentration
camps.

And it looks like Google is participating in this Fascist agenda, in
such a way as to come off as &quot;coincidental&quot; and &quot;unintended&quot;.
Nonetheless, I have experienced far more inaccessibility to various
gay-relevant Usenet articles recently...because NO MATTER HOW MANY
TIMES I CLICK the censorship button: I CANNOT LOAD THE PAGE I SEEK!

The fact that my URL, www.gay-bible.org , has &quot;gay&quot; in it, makes my web
site a highly visible target. Not to mention ALL my myriad articles
there, and on Usenet, dedicated to one issue alone: homosexual civil
rights.

GUILTY TILL PROVEN INNOCENT: what a way to go! Homosexuals: perverts
by default (unless we somehow, as a collective worldwide entity)
&quot;prove&quot; our &quot;innocence&quot;...which by THEIR definition of &quot;practicing
homosexual&quot; is impossible. As long as religious freedom (read &quot;hate
speech&quot;) is protected in such a horribly biased manner in this nation,
we shall never gain our equal rights via the usual political and legal
systems. We must be a lot more pro-active-- aggressive even--via
demonstrations on the streets, in cyberspace, and in as many key &quot;hot-
button&quot; places and news centers as possible. And we must do so EN
MASSE, for it to work.

Just think of Rosa Parks sitting in the front of the bus, and brave
citizens of color sitting at white-only luncheon counters. We need
similar strategies--well-orchestrated in many areas of the country, at
specially strategic times--in order to make any more progress towards
equality

For the time is right to take action. We shall soon see the official
eradication of ANY AND ALL sexual-minority websites, newsgroups, lists
and message boards across the entire breadth of cyberspace. (Right
now, the growing censorship of all gay-relevant sites is being
accomplished indirectly, but most effectively, via these Internet-
blocking programs...under the usual hysteria of &quot;what about the
children&quot;.) And how easy it is for any homophobe to report any queer
site to these blockers...considering the ubiquitous level of
homophobia still rampant across all aspects of our society.

Along with that will come yet another official condemnation, wherein
the White House declares homosexuals an imminent threat to Homeland
Security and Amerikan &quot;Fambly Valyooz&quot;. They'll proclaim: &quot;If gay
presence on the Internet is such a danger to our children, why, how
much MORE danger they are in our public spaces!&quot;

We will then see officially supported censorship of gay people in many
public arenas, popping up all over the place. We will see an upwelling
of mass hatred against gays, which has been surreptitiously planned
all along by the Religious Reich...in order to create a (false) common
internal enemy, that the public may be duped and led down the road to
totalitarianism.

This is what I foresee...whether through the gift of precognition, or
just plain sensitivity to social trends after years of reading gay-
related news articles from many sources, participating in gay
newsgroups, and being heavily involved as a community activist. So
much research on the same issue for so many years, CAN give one a
sense of paranormal powers, due to a highly tuned sensitivity of one
so devoted to a topic...which makes it seem very easy to predict the
near future. But I predicted the rise of gay censorship first on the
Internet, some time ago. Check for yourself by viewing this Usenet
article I posted in &quot;soc.motss&quot; on April 19, 1999, called &quot;Internet
Censorship Can Wipe Out Gays&quot; [ http://tinyurl.com/2ssbcx ]. And my
other article posted March 21, 2001 from &quot;alt.activism.peacefire&quot;,
Australian Internet Censorship Bill [ http://tinyurl.com/34jfqe ].

As most political progressives know by now, Google is one POWERFUL
tool of big brother--AND GROWING STRONGER EACH DAY--which spies on any
citizen it pleases, and censors whatever it chooses. For more
information on the danger of Google, see &quot;GoogleWatch&quot; [ http://www.google-watch.org/
]. In sum:

One wouldn't expect such censorship by a company that tells everyone
to &quot;Go ogle&quot;. (Bada boom, bada bing!)
