Disconnecting drilled well

I need to disconnect electrical and water lines from a drilled well.
I'm hoping that the electrical can simply be disconneced at the top of
the well. The water supply will eventually be re-routed to a new
location. I'm not sure how and where I should disconnect the water
supply line. This is all in preparation for a controlled burn of the
house currently supplied by the well. I'm not sure if I need to dig
down to disconnect first or if I can just cut the line at the current
house entrance and then wait until new excavation to reroute. Main
electrcial has already been disconnected. Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
KG

There is already a water tight splice down in the well at the pump so it
is no big deal to add another above ground wherever you choose. Noting
its location for future reference may be handy. Im assuming its a deep
well (pump in the hole) as you say the power has already been cut. What
would be best would be to pull all the existing wire out of the existing
house if possible leaving a coil of wire out in the yard. If it was long
enough you could simply reroute it to the new residence. If not you
would have to splice on a new piece or choose to pull the pump and run a
new continuous line from the pump to the new house.

You can also splice the water line anywhere above ground or if you
choose you could run a new line from the pitless adapter to the new
house at a later date leaving no below ground splices.

In both cases there are already below ground connections even in a new
system so having one more isnt a major issue though its nice to avoid it
if possible.

Maybe depends on how close the well is to the house.  You can
disconnect the electric at the service panel.  You should be able to
then pull that wire to the point it goes underground.  Similarly, you
can unhook the water line where it meets the pressure tank or
whatever.

Both the wire and the pipe go below ground at some point.  If you wish
to preserve those lines from this fire then you may want to excavate
them to a safe distance.  Perhaps some provision can be made to
protect them.   Roll them up underneath a metal box or old bathtub to
protect from sparks and such.

It could be a lot of digging.  At my place, for example, both lines
enter the soil right next to the house.  I was there when the hole was
dug and it goes straight down eight feet before it makes a turn
towards the well.

The alternative is to just cut those lines where they enter the ground
and sort the details after the fire.  If you abandon that well it is
necessary for you to have it properly capped by a liscensed
professional.

If you are not trying to salvage anything prior to the burn, just cut
off the electric and that is all that is needed. If salvagine tank,
controls etc, then just unscrew as necessary and remove.  Don't need
to do anything to any pipe/wire that you leave.  Any exposed wire or
pipe will be trashed but only for a about a foot past the point it
enters the ground.  Your reconnect and reroute can be sorted out at
any convenient point from the existing house back to the well head.
Dig down at the desired location cut the existing pipe, rethread (if
it's iron) and go with the new trench.  Same with the wire, dig enough
to expose enough for a waterproof connection, cut, splice (use an
underground splice kit) and go.
