I have a laptop tech question that I hope one of the tech guys here can
name. I work on a T42 ThinkPad that has suffered from a screen problem for
10 months (I think the problem is with the connection between the screen and
computer rather than in the screen itself as the screen occasionally revives
at unpredictable moments).

As a result, I use a separate screen. So far I have been working on my
diningroom table with the laptop open and using the laptop keyboard. What I
want to do is buy a detached keyboard, fold the laptop up and put it under
my desk and put the keyboard, mouse and screen on the desk, getting my work
stuff off our table so we can use it to eat of of again.

The problem I need help with is that like virtually all laptops today this
one is set up with a physical switch that puts it into sleep mode when I
close the top. Is there a way in software to disarm that switch so that I
can run the laptop as if it were a desktop processor?

That's exactly how I use my Powerbook (inherited from son) - the
screen is busted, so I have an external monitor, keyboard and mouse
attached. With most Mac laptops, as soon as you attach the external
peripherals, you can use it with the lid closed.

I've Â never tried it with my work supplied R51 but I wonder if it
works the same way. If you can attach an external keyboard, mouse and
monitor to your T42 you might want to see if it works the same way.

In the Control Panel, Power Options - check the Advanced options tab.

If you have the IBM Specific power gauge and software installed, double
clicking on the green battery indicator on the task bar should present you
with a screen of options.

Sledgehammer solution - chop off the little plastic bit sticking up from
the computer that trips the switch.

The short answer is yes, it's just a setting in power saving. The long
answer is, it may be done by Windows or by the IBM supplied software,
so you may have to hunt around for the setting. Shouldn't be that well
hidden though. If you need better help than that, I may be able to
locate the setting on my T42, although it's normally booted in Linux
and hasn't been rebooted for like six months or so. =)

Try this

Right click on Desktop
Go to properties
Click on Screen Saver
Go to the Power Button
Click on the advanced Tab
If it is there; your'e good to go.
If not you are SOL without the IBM power management tool.
I will look around for it at work.

Blessings
