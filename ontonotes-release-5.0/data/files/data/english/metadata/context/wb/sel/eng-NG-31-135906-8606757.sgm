I had this guy on another forum, saying that the only reason most
students use Ti's is due to contracts that Texas Instruments had with
the schools.  Such as the school would give away some free calculators
and supplies and by this the school would have to agree to recommend
only Ti calculators.

is this true, and if so is there any documentation backing it.

I don't know, particularly, if it's true .... BUT, it sounds very much like
what a clever marketing department would do to prop up a product and
artificially guarantee loads of sales in a market where the &quot;normal&quot; demand
for the product has very much diminished over the last decade and a half..

It is probably true... or a close variation of it is probably true.

&quot;The only reason&quot; is probably also a function of what you're exposed to. How
many high school teachers, now a days,  actually know what RPN is? How many
high school teachers, many of which are younger than 27 any more (by a long
shot in some instances), even REMEMBER that HP even made calculators.....
not that many of them would have ever had a NEED for an HP, even if they
WERE available to them while THEY were in school, some 5-10 years ago.

I get the impression that a large majority of folks that frequent this forum
have credentials in physics, engineering, architecture, surveying and other
heavily computational fields. I am sure that many of us, myself included,
are 40+ years old, went to college during the main-frame to PC
metamorphosis, and found hand helds indispensible from a portability,
capability and aviailability standpoint. It was hard to carry a VAX around
in your back-pack, or use one on a thermo final, or a chemistry final. Those
of us that had a need for such a device, and experimented between TI (or
equivalent) and HP back then, IMMEDIATELY saw the superiority of the HP
machines in terms of speed of use, programability, support, accessories and
after market applications back in the day.

MS does the same thing, btw, albeit more quietly. I teach Visual Studio
2005.Net at a local community college. I get TONS of free software from MS.
Actually, they, MS, are VERY available to programming educators. IF ya hook
'em when they're learning, you got a customer for life. If I called the
right number at school, I can walk home with a major version of any MS
software I want.

Matter of fact, if MS treated EVERY customer the way they deal with me
(being an instructor) that way, the rap they get would dissappear, even if
the short-comings in their products may not.

TO be fair, their software has &quot;issues&quot; that make me wonder at times, but,
overall, it's hard to find HUGE faults with Visual Studio.

Let's face it... often good marketing trumps capability of a product...
(remember the VHS vs. Beta wars?) VHS (JVC) won, Beta (Sony) lost. Although,
arguably, Beta was, in every respect, a better format.

Yes, yes.. The Conspiracy Of Big Brother...

TI created the SYSTEM for teaching based on their calculators. This
crime is documented on their web page.  Have a look. No free
calculators. Instead &quot;teacher's manual&quot; for each calculator.

If you want to reverse the trend, convince high school kid (and his
teacher) that calculating such as

1+2*(3+4*5+6))*7+8*(9+10*11+12)

is easier, faster or whatever using RPN than algebraic notation.

But why would they need that ? See, this is the key reason people tend
to like TI. If you don't like RPN then TI is a better machine. I know
many people who hate RPN and don't want anything to do with RPN. For
years that would automatically put them into the TI camp since HP did
not had algebraic even available on their top of the line models. When
the algebraic was eventually added on HP49 it had the same problem
that MS Windows has (plus poor hardware). It was compromised by the
need to be compatible with the old, RPN based, system of the old HP48
software. So in the end it was and still is not as good as TI system,
which was built to be algebraic from the day one. Now from the teacher
standpoint, why would you want to teach students a notation that is
different from the notation they have in their text book ? Teachers
have enough problems with teaching students to understand the material
that is in the standard algebraic notation. Making that even more
difficult and confusing students with RPN notation / logic would make
their job even more difficult. RPN by it's nature is limited to the
few talented people, who have no problems with math and tend to
appreciate additional power that comes from the special notation. This
makes HP a niche product and TI a mainstream product. Keep in mind
that even in that group RPN is not a &quot;given&quot;. There are number of math
talented people who still dislike RPN and prefer algebraic calculator.

Well. You seem to forget, that when TI92/89 come to the market it
outclassed HP48 and for several years HP did not responded with a

The studio itself is OK. I have more problems with their .NET
approach. I dislike the need to have runtime installed, lack of native
code and convoluted access to OS API (unless you want to go through
the sadistic convolutions of C++ .NET). The garbage collection of .NET
is a beautifull thing, but it would be nice if you could at the end to
be able to compile the whole C# project into the native code that can
be run on any Windows machine without the need of runtime being
installed there first. The MFC is a DINOSAUR. If I want to make native
code, Borland VCL is light years ahead of MFC. I think Borland vs
Microsoft is such a HP versus TI case. Borland VCL tools seems to be a
much more interesting proposal for Windows programming than MS .NET or
the outadated by an era MFC approach. The only downside of VCL is that
it does require programmer to free allocated resources. I would love
to see MS C++ compiler being used with VCL. Borland compiler seems to
be not as good as MS product these days. It's a shame that so many
young people today don't even know what Borland is or was for PC
industry :-)

People have a tendency not to change. At my shcool EVERYONE has a TI
calculator. ONLY about 5 people know that Casio/HP also make
calculators.

Teachers probably get a discount on TI products and large viewers (so
entire class can see). Furthermore, TI calculators are mainstream so
if you want ANY feature of another calculator, just download a program.

The biggest dissapoitment for me about TI89 was, that the TI Basic is
so slow even when compared to the old Saturn based HP and that the
program output goes to that useless for further computation output
screen instead of stack / history screen. I don't think that RPN add-

Why would he be dumb?????

I DO teach and, TO THIS DAY, whenever I get a student that has interest in
calculators, I bring my HP50 to the next class. I must say, it doesn't
happen often. As it is a programming class, I always mention that I do have
experience programming calculators, and, if anyone is interested, I can
devote some time one-on-one to help. Granted, doesn't happen too much, but
often you get a student here and there that is fascinated with the
calculator (still).

Upon demonstrating RPN (although it CAN be a HARD SELL to a student who has
had a TI for years throughout highschool), they are usually sold within 10
minutes, once they grasp the stack concept.

Usually the (short) demo ends with a comment such as, &quot;wow, where can I pick
one of those up?&quot;

Yes, it's usually a simple, longer, parenthesis laden, simple algebraic that
does the trick.

Heh, Heh, usually the &quot;let's see who can get through this FIRST, AND get the
same answer more than twice in a row&quot; has 'em hooked in a nano-second. Most
young students I encounter are VERY open to something new, enthusiastic
actually. If they are, the RPN sells itself.

&quot;Somebody has to do it&quot; (support the shrinking pool of future engineers ;)

But it's only a war of images, marketing and fashion,
because mechanical calculators all originated as &quot;RPN&quot;
(first you set the number, then you turned the crank,
one way for &quot;+&quot; or the other way for &quot;-&quot;, or something similar),
which is in fact the easiest and most natural thing to implement,
and all early electronic calculators at first duplicated that
(the only &quot;infix&quot; operators, at first, were &quot;*&quot; and &quot;/&quot;,
with those calculations terminating either in &quot;=+&quot; or &quot;=-&quot;,
thus returning to a &quot;postfix&quot; addition or subtraction at the end).

God only knows how all human businesses ever survived
using those machines, in the hands of the mainstream
everyday folk who used them, but I guess they did.

A kid with an algebraic four-banger in hand might never conceive
how generations of ordinary Chinese learned to do arithmetic
in bi-quinary on their abaci, but I guess they also did,
possibly often faster than many kids can work their four-bangers today;
I wonder whether groups who used different varieties of those tools also
spent their time deriding each other, just as much as do today's users.

If a little RPN were the first math introduced on &quot;Sesame Street,&quot;
I bet that a generation would grow up thinking that they were born using it,
and would end up preferring it; it has nothing to do with talent,
but simply with custom, and the culture into which one is thrust.

The fact that various keystroke sequences on algebraic calculators
produce widely inconsistent effects on various models
(whereas this is much less true of more unambiguous RPN)
of course also has no bearing on the issue
of confusion vs. consistency.

For years, some calculators have accommodated both systems,
and will work either way, as preferred, but don't let that
stand in the way of throwing up all the flak one can think of,
valid or not, for dissent is an important right, especially
for people from certain once violently oppressed countries
where sometimes it seems that an exercise in continuing dissent
must be found every day, just to stay in practice.

This sounds like the typical high-school kid who thinks he or she knows far
more than he or she really does... over time the truly smart ones will realize
that it's rather unlikely a bunch of highly-skilled engineers at a very
successful company could have all been idiots who signed out to work with a
system (RPN) that had no advantages over the alternatives.

Try introducing them to CORDIC sometime and see what they have to say... most
will probably dismiss it as useless as well.  At that point, ask them to come
up with something better... and watch them flounder. :-)

o So is the logic that in the hands of violent youth
who never learned anything, RPN has no value,
but a high-level TI ALGebraic calc does?

o A teacher's attitude evidently programs the students,
seeing as how they seem to express themselves so similarly.

Nothing can be done on this level (of reason), however;
it is all a matter of deeper repose needed within,
without which education does not take place.

What country, what school and what level?...

US, various accredited Universities in the area. Level: Freshman thru
Senior. I have also taught Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the
graduate level.

Why do you seem so arrogant?

I would encourage you to realize that one can't place judgement on an entire
population by looking at 1 statistic...

The US may have its issues ref education....BUT...

Having grown up in Europe, I have witnessed that the US still allows someone
with little, or no, formal education, at ANY AGE LEVEL, to obtain any level
of education they desire, or are motivated to achieve---up to and exceeding
a PhD. No one says it's easy or cheap, necessarily. Very few countries can
claim parity there. I

I say: can the prejudice hysteria and offer something objective wrt to the
topic at hand.

You missed the point. Sure, there are workarounds. The point is that
in HP every program in RPN becomes automatically an extension to the
build in commands since it is capable of taking input from the stack
and returning output to the stack (or history in algebraic mode) just
like every build in command does. This is beautifull integration of
the programming into the OS. When using TI this is not possible unless
you restrict yourself to writing Functions only. Programs which
produce output on the different screen that has to be switechd off if
you want to return to calculator mode are not a natural extension of
the build in command. I found that to be a bad, counterproductive
design of the OS. Key here is that the HP 28 (which was the first HP
calculator with an OS that was the predecessor of the current HP 50
OS) had this functionality years ahead of TI. I never understood why
TI did not copy this feature.

The algebraic notation is not ambigious when properly implemented. It

The point is, that such equations are enterd with reordering when one
become familiar with RPN.

The subject equation:

(1+2*(3+4*5+6))*7+8*(9+10*11+12)

Any experienced HP user you would enter as follows:

4 E 5 * 3 + 6 + 2 * 1 + 7 * 1 0 E 1 1 * 1 2 + 9 + 8 * +

On TI it is much more difficult to quickly come up with the effective
entering order and you will end up with more keystrokes no matter
what. On TI with the subject equation I would probably give up trying
to come up with &quot;optimized&quot; order, since there doesn't seem to be one
that is clearly more &quot;effective&quot; and just enter as written:

( 1 + 2 * ( 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 ) ) * 7 + 8 * ( 9 + 1 0 * 1 1 + 1 2 ) E

My point was that the algebraic system is more easily understood by us
normal (meaning non-professional) people.  You press what you see.  There's
no
reordering or even thinking necessary!  If it takes more keystrokes, who
cares?  That's why TI will always win in the mass-market.  It doesn't

as much intellectual investment by the user as HP does.

You are right. When you are a student, you should concentrate on
learning, not on some other secondary issues. When on the other hand,
you are eperienced engineer or scientist, that understands the
subject, secondary issues such as effectivness of work, restistance to

Exactly!  When you're a student, you should focus on learning - that
is, figuring out how to do the math on your own, rather than blindly
copying formulae from the textbook into a console and waiting for a
result.  By the time you really do understand the material, re-
ordering the terms to work around either RPN or algebraic or whatever
notation, shouldn't be a problem for the sort of student who actually
belongs in those sorts of classes.

In high school in the late 90's, we were distributed a class set of
TI-86 graphing calculators 2 or 3 times:  During our unit on matricies
(we'd already covered the elementary operations on up to 3x3 matricies
by hand or with simple AOS-type* calculators, and the graphing
calculators were used to demonstrate the utility of matricies for
solving much larger MxN systems), and during our unit on graphing
polynomials (we'd already been shown how to sketch them by hand, and
the graphing calculators were used to demonstrate whether our methods
actually matched the real results).

(*AOS is the terminology that TI has coined to refer to the hybrid
prefix/postfix input method that was ubiquitous on non-HP calculators
before EOS/textbook entry became available on non-graphic calculators
about a decade ago.)

In my first year of college, we weren't allowed to use any calculator
at all in our &quot;pure&quot; math classes.  That way we were forced to spend
all of our time understanding the material itself.  Various types of
calculators were permitted in our &quot;applications&quot; classes like physics
and chemistry.  That's the way I think it should be.

&gt; Who counts keystrokes?...

I don't know how many people bother to count them, but as an (electrical)
engineering student I was always trying to come up with ways to complete
problems faster.  Back in the early '90s when I went to college, many kids
didn't have calculators that handled complex numbers or matrices yet, and they
spent *much* more time doing homework and exams than I did -- I truly felt a
little sorry for them.

Conserved keystrokes are just another way of completing problems faster.

How often does one have to enter expressions found in a textbook?  Almost all
engineering problems consist of being given a bunch of inputs and desired
outputs and then, maniuplating a handful of equations, coming up with
solutions in the form of new equations that exists only on workpad (ok, and
many in the solution manual :-) ).

If it beyond their capabilities or just beyond their interests in an
educational system that's highly focused these days on little more than
passing standardized tests while the kids are trying very hard to perfect

I realize that from a teacher's perspective it doesn't really matter... they
teach what they're required to teach, and there's apparently less and less
time these days for &quot;diversions&quot; such as, &quot;Hey, what's all this I hear about
RPN?&quot;

When I was in high school, (late '80s), some of the math teachers still had
these &quot;mathematical journals for students&quot; around, mainly from the '60s and
'70s (perhaps started due to the Space Race?).  They explored a lot of
&quot;interesting&quot; mathematical concepts... they'd have articles such as a
half-dozen ways to prove Pythagoras's theorem, properties of polynomials (with
an eye towards finding roots or graphing them), discussions on solving
overdetermined systems (i.e., when you want to minimize the sum of the square
of the errors vs. just the sum of the absolute values of the errors), how
slide rules, abacuses, nomographs and so on worked, etc.  Some of it was
pretty advanced stuff...

Do those still exist?

Those student probably will end up in fine arts or &quot;something&quot;, but
they still have to take math in high school. That is why TI wins. It
is simply designed to be more universal toward average user than HP
is. Also you are falsely assuming, that if one happen to be talented
in math and able to learn RPN in 20 minutes that he or she will end up
liking it. That is not true. There is very large community of math and
programming talented people on the TI discussion group that dislike
RPN and lists that as a main reason, they will never use HP
calculator.

In addition it is naive to assume, that if you personally happen to be
talented and like RPN, everybody else must be the same. This is in
most cases ridiculous and completely empty argument. The real world
uses statistics and in such TI clearly wins many times over HP. HP
dominated the calculator market and lost its leadership to TI. So
excuse, that the HP lacks recognition doesnt really hold the water.

This apparently demonstrates the hypnotic power of marketing,
which makes people forget that every HP calculator in this series has
ALWAYS HANDLED ALGEBRAIC FORMULAS IN ADDITION TO RPN

But as soon as you *add* the ability to *also* use RPN,
which can only add to its total power, and should not detract
from its algebraic power, that extra capability
somehow becomes a strike against it (I wonder whether
adding the &quot;RPN program&quot; to a TI calculator similarly cripples it?)

The greater differentiation between HP's &quot;CAS line&quot; of calculators
and TI's product line, in regard solely to algebraic matters,
is that HP's CAS doesn't match textbooks as well,
and some things are just plain hard to accomplish on it,
even though, as is inevitable between disparate internals,
it betters TI's line at various other particular (and extra) things.

So a student who packs one of each is probably the best equipped of all;
maybe the two companies should split off and combine their calculator divisions
and sell only &quot;combo packs&quot; -- or someone else develop one emulator with two &quot;faces&quot;

&gt; The algebraic notation is not ambigious when properly implemented.

&gt; is how difficult it is to implement properly such interface
&gt; on the primitive technology of the cheap calculator.
">

No, it's how &quot;cutsie&quot; designers messed up simple,
predictable, logical things, sometimes to &quot;save a keystroke&quot;
(at the cost of subsequent confusion and errors).

On the earliest TI calcs that I had, &quot;+,=&quot; would double a value;
then along came Sharp, on which &quot;CLR,1&quot; followed by repeated &quot;+,=&quot;
will generate a Fibonacci sequence (this seems nowadays to be
common in most &quot;four-bangers,&quot; including old brand name Casio,
which originally had its own unique logic design).

I wager that most people will be unable to predict what &quot;+,=&quot;
or &quot;-,=&quot; will do (or new# + = etc.), after many different calculations,
nor will they be able to figure out how to continue to get
certain follow-up results on these &quot;cute&quot; &quot;Sharp logic&quot; designs.

My first TI having a &quot;%&quot; key was the most sensible, on which
&quot;3+4%&quot; first showed &quot;.12&quot; (which is 3*4%) and then if you press &quot;=&quot;
that &quot;.12&quot; finally gets added to 3, and if you repeat &quot;=&quot;
then the same value gets added more times.

Sharp and Casio, however, decided that &quot;3+4%&quot; should deliver &quot;3.12&quot;
immediately, without showing the intermediate &quot;.12&quot; before adding;
if you wanted to see that intermediate value, you should instead
have typed &quot;3*4%&quot;, and if now you want to see it added
to the original base value, then you press &quot;+&quot; _last_
(ahem, isn't that a throwback to &quot;postfix&quot;?),
and then hardly anyone can guess what various keys might do next
(particularly in regard to re-using a prior value, a/k/a &quot;constant&quot;)

On some &quot;cutesier&quot; Casios, however, &quot;30+40%&quot; produces answer 50 (why?),
then if the very next keystroke is &quot;-&quot; it shows 20 (why?);
I think they called this &quot;perfect percent,&quot;
but to me it's &quot;perfect confusion&quot; for the same people
who are likely to protest that &quot;RPN is hard to understand&quot; :)
[e.g. what will &quot;30-40%&quot; do?]

On HP18C/19B/17B (in ALG mode), it's back to the good sense of that old TI,
where &quot;3+4%&quot; now becomes &quot;3+.12&quot; on the command line, at which point
any idiot can fathom that pressing &quot;=&quot; will finish the job,
the same way as did that sensible, old TI calculator,
but now so much easier to see in a visible, algebraic command line.

So if you have students pick various common simple algebraic calculators
at random, out of a bag full of all different models,
and give them some challenges like those above,
let's see how well they can do,
and how much confidence they can have in the results.

Among all those algebraic calculator varieties,
I would still pick HP's financial calculator implementations
as the very best of them all, making it hard for anyone
(outside of Homer Simpson) to mis-calculate anything.

For &quot;scientific&quot; use, older other-brand &quot;AOS&quot; mix infix and postfix,
while HP's algebraic formulas were always certainly evaluated as they should be,
and HP's equation writer and &quot;textbook display&quot; are as good as can be.

It's with the CAS that students can take issue,
because it sometimes hears a different drummer,
and won't march in the direction of the answer book,
even if it should be obvious to a human how to proceed;
an occasional bug seems also to have slipped by,
but of course is invaluable to see whether the student is paying attention :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &quot;One of the great advantages of HP is that its interface

&gt; Algebraic notation alone does not encompass all procedural things, however,

TI does uses BASIC. It is easy to write and read. For sure it is
significantly easier to read than USER RPL. My biggest concern is that
it is awfully slow. In fact there is no reason why it must be so slow
on MC68000. TI did a very poor job writing this intepreter.

What you described is some &quot;improvements&quot; to the algebra, that
manufacturers selected to add. Interestingly I've never thought about
precedence of %operator, since in math the % is not really an
algebraic operator that is recognized world wide. You have a point,
that with the addition of operators that are not strictly mathematical
different calculators will produce different results depending on how
the manufacturer interpreted precedence of this artificial operator. I
was more thinking about example such as:

2+3*4=

In this case it should always produce 14. On some older calculators
that was not the case but I don't consider them neither algebraic nr
RPN. Any modern algebraic calculator should intepret this statement
correctly.

Difference is in being common with peers etc. If every one else is
using for example MS Office why bother with being incompatible. Even
messaging is an issue. Lots of young people use AOL messenger (or
whatever it is called). They don't care that Linux has one that is
able to communicate with AOL. The point is that it is different than
the one their peers are using. In case of my daughter the last straw
was actually that she needed to install something later that was not
in the initial Linux package and she wanted to do it herself. You can
do it without any help on Windows in 99% of cases using simple GUI
installer. When you try to do it on Linux, you end up searching
internet for help. The first thing you discover is, that the help
provided is horrible. In many cases you have so called &quot;gurus&quot; and
&quot;experts&quot; who can't lower themselves to the level of knowledge of the
newbie and their answers are as helpfull as describing 8 years old
tunneling effect using Schrodinger equation. But this is not the
worst. The worst is that in order to install something in most cases
you to discover that you have to download number of cryptic packages
and install them using strange crypting commands from console. Thank
you very much. You have just lost another client. I can add from
myself, that equally irritating is trying to make some hardware set up
and work under Linux. Why is it that in order to set up WiFi or
printer or change settings in most cases you have to memorize and
execute cryptinc commands from console. I think this is the biggest
problem associated with Linux crowd. They are very poor in
uderstanding customer. Microsoft is light years ahead of Linux in
uderstanding their average mass market customer. The problem with
Linux is, that if you don't get that, you can only dream of beating
Windows.

Sure, you can improve on some simple MS tools. These were not meant to

Open Office is a nice toy for simple tasks but falls well short when
some more features such as programming are needed. I find people

Yeah, but poorly. You have to use ' ' brackets and instead of ENTER,
EVAL was needed. That is cumbersome. HP was always designed with RPN
to be it's underlying operation mode and algebraice was always (even
in the 50g model) an afterthought. If you mass marketr consumer

afterthought.

&gt; adding the &quot;RPN program&quot; to a TI calculator similarly cripples it?)
">

Who claims, that addition of algerbraic mode since HP49 (however
poorly implemented) is detrimental to the HP ? It is an improvement
over what it was, but is is not as big improvement as people would
like it to belive and it is weaker than native algebraic mode of TI.
Similarly TI RPN mode is a poor ersatz of what is available on the HP.
Both extensions are improvements for those who demand it. At the end
of the day I want to see how many people really uses algebraic on HP
or RPN on TI. I don't have a statistics like that, but I'm willing to
bet, that majority of users of HP care less for algebraic mode and
majority of users of TI ignore RPN aftermarket software. So for those
people it is not an improvement that matters at all.

What makes the difference is that RPN on TI was created by bunch of TI
useres as and aftermarket unauthorized addition and TI had nothing to
do with this. Contrary HP took an apporach of adding alebraic mode
beliving, that it will make a market difference. IMHO this was a
mistake, beacuse they also wanted to be compatible with RPN user base.
In the end the base cared less about algebraic but the effort almost
for sure distracted HP resources from improving 48 RPN code to be even
more powerfull than what it is today in HP50g

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The greater differentiation between HP's &quot;CAS line&quot; of calculators

&gt; is that HP's CAS doesn't match textbooks as well,
&gt; and some things are just plain hard to accomplish on it,
&gt; even though, as is inevitable between disparate internals,
&gt; it betters TI's line at various other particular (and extra) things.

&gt; So a student who packs one of each is probably the best equipped of all;
&gt; maybe the two companies should split off and combine their calculator divisions
&gt; and sell only &quot;combo packs&quot; -- or someone else develop one emulator with two &quot;faces&quot;

&quot;Four-bangers&quot; are supposed to get 20 -- they don't have more registers
(or a stack) to save up as yet unused operands (and operators).

Naturally, calculators intended for use in _algebra_
take a different approach, with no difference between brands
(except possibly how many levels of unused operands they can save).

But note that just plain &quot;+,=&quot; or &quot;-,+&quot; is unpredictable
between different manufacturer; it uses a &quot;saved constant,&quot;
the behavior of which varies arbitrarily between brands
(and chip suppliers).  Figure out how &quot;Sharp logic&quot;
gets a Fibonacci sequence! (&quot;it's not a kludge, it's a feature!&quot; :)

The &quot;bottom line&quot; of all this talk is that calculators which
&quot;look algebraic&quot; vary all over the map as to how they work,
while you can walk up to most any RPN calculator that you've
never seen before, and already know what it does.

But no matter -- lest we forget, all HP graphing calculators
are fully equipped to handle algebraics, exactly as they should,
and using RPN is an option that one can take or leave.

I think you are identifying the wrong culprit.  Microsoft isn't the vendor
of Windows add-ons, and &quot;Linux&quot; isn't a company -- it's in the hands
of &quot;third party vendors,&quot; whose personal values determine the outcome.

Microsoft makes an author's life pretty difficult, erecting a high barrier
to entry -- it's like a &quot;poll tax&quot; that once kept &quot;commoners&quot;
out of the voting booth, and it &quot;improves&quot; the environment
much the same way that a high &quot;cover charge&quot;
keeps the less affluent (and well-dressed) out of the pricier places :)

The second culprit is vendors who won't bother to enter the market;
why spend so much, when the big returns come from Windows customers?
That's a function only of Windows being bigger, market-share wise,
not better.

When it comes to those who have the means, however, and who decide
to enter the market, then what's the difference?
