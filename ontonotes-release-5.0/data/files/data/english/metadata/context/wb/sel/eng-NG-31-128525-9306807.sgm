Weekend Prayer Directive: with a Short Word from the Lord - Friday 5th October 2007
Pastor Amakor
Oct 5, 2007

Weekend Prayer Directives
23rd of Tishrei, 5768
כ״ג בתשרי תשס״ח

Scriptural Meditation:
Isa 48:6    &quot;You have heard; See all this. And will you not declare it? I have made you hear new things from this time, Even hidden things, and you did not know them. Isa 48:7   They are created now and not from the beginning;  And before this day you have not heard them, Lest you should say, 'Of course I knew them.'

New things are being created NOW says the Lord ..
The Lord  reiterated to  me the same word he gave me last Saturday on Thursday in the camp that a new season is upon his people.  The word is corresponding with many things, and I feel it will encourage you and all your. He spoke to my heart that things revealed long ago are being fulfilled now. Prophesies, dreams and vision are being fulfilled. Things revealed long ago that remained as though they are not coming to fruition is being fulfilled. Dust up your dream, prophecy, and vision note books. God is stepping into the vacuum of many lives. Surprises are coming your way. Things not thought of before or known will be created instantaneously as you ask. Open up, he wants to fill the void. No matter the stagnancy in your life, he said, “Yet I will bless you from now on” Hag. 2.19.    'Is the seed still in the barn? As yet the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yielded fruit. But from this day I will bless you.'&quot;
