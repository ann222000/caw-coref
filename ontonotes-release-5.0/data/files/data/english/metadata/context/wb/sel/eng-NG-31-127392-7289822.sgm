Breman sorry I could not post sooner I was out all day,
It all depends here on if it is physical or system memmory, we have one
of these at work but it has mac OS 10 on it and I am not sure of the
diffrence because that is the only mac os I have worked on.
If your hard drive is full or cookies folder is full it can report
memmory errors if your system needs more memory meaning RAM wich I
doubt because of your problem description on this post and your last.
The thing that concerns me is that your internet does not apear anymore
that sounds really odd.
Macs can get viruses too though not nearly as common.
Try this:
Do you have safari on you computer?
If you do open it up,
click on prefrences,  This will open a new window.
Click on security
then click on show cookies or show all cookies.
then click on remove all cookies.
Also try emptying cache folder from safari also.
Do not delete any "index" files though.

If you do not have safari and you are using IE explorer for mac you can
do a search for cookies and it should bring up a folder and then delete
the cookies from the folder making sure to leave the index file.

Also check acailable hard drive space by holding the contol key and
clicking on the hard drive icon on your desk top.
Then click on "get info" and see the amount of hard drive space you
have used and how much is free,  You may be running out of hard drive
space ( i am leaning more to the cookies though).
Cookies are a small file that is generated when you visit a website so
the computer can track web sites and pop ups and all that stuff, they
are not necessary files and if you do not empty the folder you could
run into problems.

Also back up your files now incase you do have to do a system restore,
burn them to cd or dvd or even buy an external usb drive and  copy your
files over the drive.  If you do get an external drive which is
probally not a bad Idea with the limited storage in a laptop buy one
that will be large enough to store more files over time.  In other
words do not buy an 80 gig buy something at least twice that size so
can store your files on that when they are not needed on your laptop.

Also try going to www.download.com and get some free (well free to try)
virus and spyware tools like Mac Scan 2.2, Norton Antivirus 9.0 (for
mac), or Intego virusbarrier X4 10.4.3 they should be able to atleast
scan and let you know if you do have a virus or something.

So a re-cap:
1. Check for and delete cookes.
2. See if you can empty cache folder
3. download if possible a tool or two and scan your computer.
4. prepare for the worse and back up your existing files!!!!!!!

Good Luck! Keep me posted!

and definatly consider an external hard drive to copy your files to it
may cost a few dollars now but at least you do not lose your important
files and you have some place to put them when your drive is full, if
it is 60 gig or that range like ours at work and my brothers the space
goes fast.
