99 per cent of buyers of make money products never earn a red cent in
profit. And the truth is, none of them ever will. They live broke,
stay broke and will very probably die broke, while a small minority
continue to rake in the thousands...
It's true. They are just as broke today, as they are when they bought
that first guide. The ClickBank checks are the same - only the date
has changed. Does this sound familiar to you too? If that's your
reality, let me ask you this:
Have you ever wondered why some affiliates make over $100,000 a year
working only an hour or two per day ... while you struggle to even
make anything from all your hard work?
Did you ever consider that there might be a single small difference
between your methods and their's... one that produces massively
different results? A simple reason that has elluded you up until now -
that others may already know about?
An answer that sums up neatly why you have been failing from day one -
one that may anger you, confuse you ...and make you wonder whether you
should simply give up and go back to your day job...
It's because near enough 100 per cent of internet marketers are
teaching you to fail.
Of course , they will tell you that the techniques take time to work,
that you're the reason you have failed up until now... and I admit,
sometimes it's true.
But what about the results?
The hundreds and thousands of dollars you know are being made every
day by others just like you, the "super affiliate" lifestyle you once
pictured yourself living - any real change there? I doubt it. Because
most of what you've bought into is counterproductive, being used by
100,000 other failed affiliates, or just plain wrong.
