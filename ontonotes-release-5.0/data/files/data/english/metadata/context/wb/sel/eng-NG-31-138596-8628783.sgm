Soludo's American wonder
By Peter Alexander Egom
THE Nigerian Debt Management Office, DMO, held an international
conference on debt sustainability in June 2001. It was in Abuja. And
I was there as an observer. That event was the last official outing
of Izoma Phillip C. Asiodu as Economic Adviser to President O.
Obasanjo. It was also the first official outing for Dr. Magnus
Kpakol, the neither here nor there economist, as Economic Adviser to
President O. Obasanjo. But, the main stars of that conference were
the quartet of Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala,
Professor Charles C. Soludo and Dr. Mansor Muktar. The World Bank had
used that occasion to announce them as its anointed quartet, come
July 2003, with the scorched-earth mandate to finally drag the
Nigerian economy, the heartbeat of the black race, back to colonial
monetary manacle and bondage.

And, in this assignment the quartet has been very successful as the
Naira under their watch has become ever so outward-looking and
foreign-friendly, ever so work-shy and rural-shy in Nigeria, and ever
so ready for the colonial monetary manacle of the fixed-rate currency
board relationship with the imperial but terminally sick US Dollar.
This is Mr. Soludo's latest plan for the Naira come August 1, 2008.
Indeed, the main assignment of the quartet has been to midwife,
latest by July 2009, a new West African Currency Board with the US
Dollar as its guarantor and currency of reference.

However, what intrigued me much at the Abuja conference of June 2001
was not the Nigerian gang of four that the World Bank had chosen to
corral Nigeria and the black race as whole back to colonial monetary
manacle and bondage. Rather what caught and fixed my attention was
this very stooping and very old man of an American by the name of Dr.
Reginald Green. Ha! Ha!, was this not the same Dr. Green who had held
the Tanzanian Treasury and President Nyerere's Ujamaa economic policy
hostage with mumbling misadvice in 1974-75 when I was at the Bank of
Tanzania at work with my flow of funds study of the Tanzanian
economy? It surely was.

And there and then I knew that the economy of Nigeria under President
O. Obasanjo would not bring any economic good cheer to Nigeria and to
most Nigerians. And so it has truly turned out to be in spite of
Nigeria's unprecedented run of economic good fortune in foreign
exchange earnings from oil and gas export in the period 1999-2007.

But, we Nigerians owe Mr. Soludo a deep debt of gratitude. For flush,
as he always is, with immodest and loquacious self-praise, he has
gone on to give us the first ever clear statement about the Big Bang,
or shall we say the Big Whimper, of the monetary theory and practice
which lies behind the World Bank's colonial economic roadmap for
Nigeria. For every economic policy package anywhere must be held
together and driven by a concise theory and practice of money. The
job of any public statement on the relevant theory and practice of
money behind any economic policy package is to, among other things,
educate and inform the public on whether the money being used to
manage the economic life of a nation is debt-based or commodity-
based, is urban-friendly or rural friendly, is public-sector
financing or private sector financing, has outward-looking
convertibility or inward-looking convertibility.

For once these key attributes of the money in use in a nation have
been decided upon, then the economist is put in the vantage position
to anticipate where the nation's economy is headed with respect to
providing its nationals with job, food and social security. Thus,
quite contrary to popular belief, economics is a cut and dried
subject which says that debt money is always an impoverishing bad
master where commodity money is always an enriching good servant.

Thus, until Mr. Soludo happened a week ago with his impoverishing bad
master of the debt Naira and the colonial dollarisation plan for the
Naira, the hitherto World Bank approved economic managers of Nigeria
had been all too vague about the theory and practice of money that
drives their American wonder works or shall we say their American
Good Works in Nigeria! But this is no more the case.

For Mr. Soludo has now made it crystal clear that the World Bank's
economic policy for Nigeria has the impoverishing bad master of the
outward-working and non-convertible Naira at its base and centre but
that the Naira is be to given, come August 1, 2008, a deceitful
patina of outward-looking convertibility by being manacled, in
restricted colonial convertibility, to the terminally-ill US Dollar
at the fixed rate of N1.25 to one US Dollar. In other words, come
August 1, 2008, Nigeria will be returned to the colonial thraldom of
the pre-October 1, 1960 fixed rate currency board debt standard where
the fixed-rate colonial convertibility of the Naira will be
guaranteed by the US Federal Reserve System. Simply brilliant! But,
treasonous and, treacherous all the same. And all of this ties up
with the see-saw history of the ECOWAS common currency project as
follows:

In April 2001, the ECOWAS member countries decided on a two-pronged
attack on their elusive quest for a common currency. The CFA Franc
economies of the ECOWAS were grouped under the umbrella of the First
Monetary Zone with the CFA Franc as their common colonial currency
which has restricted convertibility into the Euro of the Eurozone.
The Anglo-phone economies of the ECOWAS were grouped under the Second
Monetary Zone with the ECO to emerge as their colonial common
currency which would have restricted convertibility into the US
Dollar. However, the launching of the ECO has proved to be very
troublesome after the target dates for this in July 2003 and in July
2005 came and went without the ECO coming into virtual or real
circulation.

It was then realised that the ECO common currency had to have an
anchor and a locomotive currency from among the members of the WAMZ
and the choice for this fell on the Naira of Nigeria, in the same
manner as the DMark was the anchor and locomotive currency of the
Euro. So, all of the recent avalanche of talk by Mr. Soludo about the
Naira being the currency of reference in West Africa, and Nigeria
becoming the financial hub of West Africa, if not for the whole of
Africa, is all tied up with the planed emergence of the colonial ECO
common currency in July 2009. And after July 2009, it is the plan
that a new colonial ECOWAS common currency will be forged out of the
colonial CFA and the colonial ECO.

And, it was, indeed, my realisation of the full colonial implications
of the post -2003 economic policies of the World Bank's gang of four
in Nigeria that prompted me to write as follows on page 95 of my 2006
book &quot;Compass for Economic Reform:

Already, &quot;by July 2004, it was clear to any keen observer of the
Nigerian economic scene that the ECO common currency project of the
WAMZ would not fly by July 2005 as scheduled. What was missing and is
still missing in this three-decade old colonial common currency
project is a Nigerian anchor currency which has the colonial
convertibility of the CFA Franc or of the Hong Kong dollar.
Accordingly the ECO common currency project has been rescheduled to
fly by July 2009 so that, in the interim, Nigeria would have to hurry
and put in place such internal and external payments arrangements
that would inexorably lead the Naira, before July 2009, to the
gallows of colonial convertibility. This is the sum-total of the
colonial sense in the on-going economic reform programme of Nigeria&quot;.

So, Soludo's newly announced Naira revaluation and convertibility
plan gives credence to what I saw of the colonial drift of Nigeria's
economic policy as far back as July 2004 when Mr. Soludo became the
Governor of the CBN. Indeed, the new Lagos-based US dollar trading
African Finance Corporation, AFC, with the wholly paid up share
capital of one billion US Dollars, is the precursor of the West
African Central Bank and, naturally, the unending beefing up of the
capital bases of Nigeria's commercial banks to at least one billion
US dollars per bank is all in aid of Nigeria becoming by July 2009
the sub-imperial hub of dealings in foreign exchange in West Africa,
a money centre in the footsteps of Dubai. And likewise the FS2020 is
aimed at turning all of Nigeria into a country-wide and colonial
bureau de change!

ATTENTION EVERYBODY,
Please read the article below and the author's judgment that
The &quot;Dollarisation of the Naira&quot; is an attempt to mop up the excess
Naira that is in the hands of the few, exchange them for hard
currencies, and take dollars out of the country. It will lead to the
flight of stolen wealth, which had been buried in the bedrooms and
secret bank accounts of those that have plundered our resources. It
will create another hemorrhage in the Nigerian Nation similar to what
the exodus of educated Nigerians to other parts of the world did to
our development. Need I remind anyone of the now famous &quot;brain drain&quot;
epidemic?

The bottom line for the Professor's policy of &quot;revaluation,
redenomination, decimalisation, or what I call &quot;Dollarisation of the
Naira'&quot; is purely an attempt to allow all those &quot;elite&quot; who have been
responsible for the pillage of Nigeria's treasury to convert their
excess &quot;stolen&quot; hidden Naira into Dollars, and take their ill-gotten
wealth out of the country in a legitimate manner. And for those who
are yet to join this &quot;elite&quot; group, it is an opportunity to &quot;steal&quot;
your &quot;share&quot;, of the oil money, knowing fully well that come August
2008, you can convert it all to Dollars, take it out, and buy
expensive mansions in Europe and/or America. God Save Nigeria!

Dollarisation of the Naira
By Joseph Owumi Sr.
I READ with dismay, various articles on the announcement of the
Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Professor Chukwuma Soludo,
regarding his proposed policy on the &quot;Strategic Agenda for the
Naira&quot;. The proposal as described by various newspapers across the
country is a re-valuation, re-denomination, or decimalisation of the
Naira, by establishing a conversion rate of N1.25 to $1.00 USD come
August 2008.

It is my experience that the value of a country's currency is not
unilaterally determined, rather market forces, and in this case,
supply and demand determines the value of a currency. Therefore, for
the CBN Governor to come out and make this pronouncement is ill-
advised. The Professor needs to explain to every Nigerian how he
arrived at the rate of N1.25 to $1.00 USD.

The proposed policy is ill-informed. It is not a solution to the
worthlessness of the Naira when compared to other major currencies.
The only way to shore up the Naira against other foreign currencies
is to create a sustainable economy with little or no unemployment,
good governance, transparency, and eventually with market forces in
place, the Naira will appreciate over time.

The proposed policy as I call it is an attempt to &quot;Dollarise the
Naira&quot;. We may as well do away with the Naira and establish the
Dollar as our national currency and unit of measure. This policy is
not an attempt to cure or revive the &quot;ailing&quot; Naira. Rather, it is a
deliberate attempt to pander to the political &quot;elite&quot; as well as
those who plundered Nigeria's resources, with the sole purpose of
&quot;burying&quot; the Naira. We all know that it is the bad policies of
previous administrations, as well as the politics of those who think
that Nigeria belongs to them and their families and friends, that
made the Naira &quot;sick&quot;.

What about public opinion and a host of questions that need to be
addressed? For example, how does the Professor plan to explain to the
average market woman who is used to collecting N1,000.00 for some
measure of rice, that she now has to collect only N10.00 for the same
measure? How does he explain to the average Nigerian worker who is
used to collecting N36,000.00 a month, that come August 2008, his
income will be $360.00 a month? How will the Professor explain to
President Yar'Adua who recently declared his assets at N500 Million
Naira, that one year later, his N500 Million through the process of
decimalisation will be N5 Million only? Or, how does he justify to
the Immediate Past President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, that his
billions of today, through this policy will be Millions of tomorrow?
The questions are endless, and I don't think the Professor's
explanations will go down well with any Nigerian.

While I believe strongly in the autonomy of the Central Bank, there
is no doubt in my mind that President Yar'Adua is responsible for
whatever goes on in Nigeria. Therefore, for the learned Professor to
arbitrarily make his pronouncement without consultation with the
government and its Economic Team, is rather naive and unintelligent.

The &quot;Dollarisation of the Naira&quot; is an attempt to mop up the excess
Naira that is in the hands of the few, exchange them for hard
currencies, and take dollars out of the country. It will lead to the
flight of stolen wealth, which had been buried in the bedrooms and
secret bank accounts of those that have plundered our resources. It
will create another hemorrhage in the Nigerian Nation similar to what
the exodus of educated Nigerians to other parts of the world did to
our development. Need I remind anyone of the now famous &quot;brain drain&quot;
epidemic?

The bottom line for the Professor's policy of &quot;revaluation,
redenomination, decimalisation, or what I call &quot;Dollarisation of the
Naira'&quot; is purely an attempt to allow all those &quot;elite&quot; who have been
responsible for the pillage of Nigeria's treasury to convert their
excess &quot;stolen&quot; hidden Naira into Dollars, and take their ill-gotten
wealth out of the country in a legitimate manner. And for those who
are yet to join this &quot;elite&quot; group, it is an opportunity to &quot;steal&quot;
your &quot;share&quot;, of the oil money, knowing fully well that come August
2008, you can convert it all to Dollars, take it out, and buy
expensive mansions in Europe and/or America. God Save Nigeria!
