IF it's raining at 10am in the area we'll be in,  we'll postpone start time til noon.  We can all look at the radars ourselves and figure things out.  I'll post tomorrow at 8:30am what the weather is down here.

Assuming no rain then, the Great River Tempo Ride....uhm....rides again.   Zones  two and three, (moderate, to energetic  effort).  There will be a group that's gonna put the hammer
down and go off the front.  This generally happens around the Pendary Park turnaround. 1/3 of the group turns around there for a 40 mile ride. After that, those looking for more intense sub threshold work will pull away, and those wishing to stay around zone 2 or 3 will lag behind.  Every one regroups at the Marathon gas station in Pendleton Cty.

I want to see everybody out there.  It's 70 degrees in march for heaven's sake.  I may just go in the rain like we did two weeks ago.  only water,  lol.  If the entire MHP/7HR squadron comes out, there'd be 100 people there.  so Let's see 100 people.  I encourage the less fitnessed majority to come on out and ride with me for the entire 70 miles.  My  road speed will not exceed 20 mph.  (I absolutely thrashed myself this week,  and i need the recovery).  No excuses,  It's warm,  you own a $3000 bike,  and you're amongst friends.

4 well known sprint points .  1) silver grove sign under rt 275 overpass. 2) obscure Melbourne town sign in Melbourne.  3)  Ross town sign,  3/4 mile after the pendary park turnaround.  4)  Campbell county sign at the Marathon rest stop.  regroup after each blast.

Leave Lunken airport terminal parking lot at 262 Wilmer ave.  (at Wilmer and airport rd.),  at 10 am.  The other half of the ride meets at the Purple People bridge between 10:25 and 10:30am.  "Pick ups"  all along Eastern. This ride can get huge depending on the weather.  There is free parking at the purple people bridge and at Lunken.  Push everything back to noon at Lunken,  and 12:30pm  at the PPB if it's raining at at 10am at the start and a discouraging radar picture.

Pace-- the usual.  18 to 25 mph "road speeds".  separate into 2 speed groups.  The Herald usually winds it up after 30 min or so, and takes the strong folks  with him to form the fast pack.   The second group just tempos onward.

route-- (Standard basic route from Lunken)--up Eastern to Purple People  Bridge.  Then rt 8 east.  to right at Ivor rd, rest stop at the Marathon gas  station.  return via rt 10 (flagg springs pk) to 1997 (stonehouse rd), to 547 to rt 8 west to home.  about 69 miles total from Lunken.

Distances from Lunken.  (subtract about 8 to10 miles if leaving from PPB)
70 miles  to Marathon station. (right turn at Ivor rd).   (most do this)
40 mile option to Pendary Park, (10% to 15% of people)
