I'm neither endorsing nor condemning this online video--
They do bring up some interesting points, although
I'm a bit skeptical that all research into global warming was started by
Margaret Thatcher for political purposes....
From the BBC. 1:15 long-- you might want to watch it in a couple of
sittings.

It's not from the BBC.

Margaret Thatcher was just selected to run for office for the very first
time when the record of CO2 at Mauna Loa started. She had something to do
with it?

The Soviet Union's project to drill ice cores in Antarctica?  Margaret
Thatcher would have been just an MP. She had something to do with it??

What interesting points does this TV show make that aren't laughable?

Ok, point taken. But it is from Britain, and they sure were running BBC
film clips in their presentation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I didn't watch it to laugh. I watched it to analyze how they would
present their point of view. The points below stood out to me:

The presentation of computer warming models as facts in the popular
media and how  those models rest on sometimes arbitrary assumptions.

The lack of a geological time reference of many otherwise fairly
well-educated people.

The fact you can prove nearly any premise by massaging data to support
your argument, and then, instead of presenting numbers--graph it. Or,
graphing data as if it were uniform in quantity and precision.

The role of peer pressure and funding opportunities in peer review and
government based science.

The presentation in the popular press of global warming as a single
variable problem (greenhouse gases) as opposed to a multivariable system
(solar, Milkanovitch cycles, geothermal activity, ocean circulation
buffering/feedback, AND greenhouse gases).

How the producer 'clipped' interviews to make his political point.

I was personally interested to hear the remarks of Patrick Moore. I had
heard of Mr. Moore before-- eco-wacko becomes pro-nuke advocate of
sustainable development, and becomes a pariah who isn't welcome
anywhere. He's an interesting study. I wish more people were working in
the 'light green' community as he is.

There's more, but this covers why I like to read/view both sides of any
issue, and seek the probable truth somewhere in the middle. This is a
longstanding attitude of mine-- even in high school I annoyed my world
history teacher no end because I wouldn't just accept the textbook and
sought out other more primary sources which often contradicted the
sanitized book. I spend a lot of time in the hall that year.

I don't have much use for extremists of any stripe as data
sources, but dissecting their presentations does reveal much about how
the world really works, and how they influence what eventually comes to
pass.

Could not prove they know anything period, let alone about climate
science, from their comments

Amusing, yes, but perhaps as well not to get too friendly with the Now
Show - if I remember correctly, they've been none too kind to Al Gore
in the past. Mind you, I can't recall them being kind to anybody in
the past.

Comment by Ben.H — 17 Mar 2007 @ 11:25 am

very funny stuff

Comment by Jeffrey Davis — 17 Mar 2007 @ 11:43 am

Just read the transcript and I want to congratulate the folks who put
their effort into the global warming debate in New York city.
Regardless of the outcome of the vote at the end, you did a fantastic
job! Clearly on substance, as one reads the transcripts your "sceptic"
crowd said almost nothing about global warming, lots of funny comments
but nothing substantial at all. Don't know how it will sound on NPR
yet but on paper, word for word, idea for idea, it was a great effort!
And very helpful for someone like myself who took part in Gore's
training in Nashville and am to some extent dealing with the same
challenges myself during my own presentations. THANK YOU.

Monty Python is also from Britain. :-) ;-) :-) ;-)

Did you wonder why they were running BBC film clips? Might it be that
perhaps they wanted some of the viewers to think that this video was from
the BBC? Perception is everything, in propaganda.

Looking to see if I could find a transcript of the video I found this:

I love the Attila the Hen comment!

From what I understand, the observatory was completed about 1956, and
yes, the initial CO2 funding was for the IGY. Apparently the first two
years' data proved interesting.

That'd be the latest start (1896).  But Tyndall had established the
existent of greenhouse gases in 1861, and Fourier had inferred the
presence of a greenhouse effect in 1824.

Callendar was working on it in the UK in the 1930s, which also
would predate Thatcher's activity.

He only made one observation, so it should be obvious?

No, that cannot be it, you wrote, "observations"

Which means I must conclude all his observations were not an honest
representation of the science, but then leaves unanswered what,
specifically, about them were not an honest representation of the
science.

And means you have not answered my question.

Please back up your statement so it is possible to know what you are
