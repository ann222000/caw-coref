Airport Extreme Woes...

A friend of mine runs a cafe locally who has the new Airport Extreme
which continues to lose its signal.  Either the signal drops
significantly or it just goes off the air.   Power cycling it solves
the problem, most of the time.

He recently updated to recent firmware and the problem persists.   I
can understand why he's getting upset about it (he's asked support to
help him figure it out, they recommended the firmware upgrade).

There aren't really any physical factors that I can observe that would
contribute to this... and there are several (5 or more) access points
in the vicinity that are always accessible, even when his Airport
Extreme is not.

So barring any further firmware upgrades, can anyone enlighten me of
what the issue is - whether this is known, or is an ongoing problem...
perhaps with the hardware.  Maybe he just needs to get a warranty
replacement.

Thanks in advance....

Forrie-

Of course the unit can be defective.  However there is another possible
cause of the problem.

Users could be experiencing interference from one of those other access
points, that happens to be on the same channel the AirPort is using.  To
see what the &quot;competition&quot; is like, you can use a stumbler program like
iStumbler or MacStumbler.

Running on an AirPort equipped Mac, iStumbler or MacStumbler will
display all the access points it can see, let you know what channel they
are on and how strong their signal is.  The solution could be as simple
as changing the AirPort to a channel further away from the access points
with stronger signals.

You may not be able to see some access points that do not advertise
their presence.  If such were the case, changing channels might still
provide relief.

Has he enabled the checkbox for &quot;Interference Robustness&quot; in the settings
for the Airport Extreme? Does that help?

Thanks for your replies.

I'm running MacStumbler now in the vicinity.  I see that the access
points it sees are all on channel 6 *except* his, the Airport Extreme,
which is on Channel 1.

I'll ask him to check the Interface Robustness option - what does that
provide?

I've Google'd around and found several reports of different problems
with the Airport - but some of those reports are from 2006 - and it's
not clear to me whether this is firmware or not.

But yes, certainly it can be defective and that's going to be my
ultimate suggestion that he have it exchanged.

Anything else I should have him check?

Thank you again...

Have him change his channel.

I agree.  There might be an invisible base station on Channel 1, or that
channel may be more susceptible to interference from 2400 MHz cordless
phones and microwaves.  Try Channel 11.

He changed the channel to 3 (as I can see from MacStumble) - though
the Airport Extreme went offline again today at about 4pm.  She reset
it and I can get 2 or 3 bars upstairs (I live in the same building, go
figure).

I suggested to him (the owner) that he consider getting it replaced
under warranty if the problem continues (which it appears to).

I do see a few access points in the vicinity - but of course, I can't
tell if there are ones that are not advertising their SSID - though I
imagine there must be some clever way to discover them.

In the past, I bought a Linksys router and installed Sveasoft's code
and increased the wattage and *never*  had a problem.  I wonder if
someone will come up with a similar hack for the Airport ;-)

Thanks!

You previously stated that the other access points are all working
fine.  Also, you stated all the other access points are using channel
6.  So why would you not use channel 6 for this one as well?

Channels 1, 6 and 11 do not overlap with any other channels.  With
802.11b and g 2.4GHz WiFi base stations, each channel uses the
equivalent of 5 channels worth of frequencies (bandwidth).  You
goal is to choose channels that are at least 5 channels away from
any other user if at all possible.  If you must get into an
overlap situation, choose to overlap with the user having the
weakest signal.

As for loosing connections, once channel overlap has been
eliminated, then consider 2.4GHz cordless phones.  They very
common and extremely good at interfering with WiFi.

After that are microwave ovens.  And this is only when the base
station or computer are close to the oven, like in the same room.

But in both the cordless phones and microwave oven cases, the
problem only exists while someone is talking on the cordless phone
or using the microwave.  As soon as they hang up or stop cooking,
WiFi access resumes without any need to reset anything.

One more thought, is power good in the building?  I have heard
reports (as well as had a friend relate his experience) with
unreliable power knocking out network connections.   The solution
has been to get an inexpensive UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply)
and plug the comm gear into the UPS.  One added advantage to this
is during a power failure, if you also plug your cordless phone
base into the UPS you will be able to use your phone as well as
surf the web :-)
