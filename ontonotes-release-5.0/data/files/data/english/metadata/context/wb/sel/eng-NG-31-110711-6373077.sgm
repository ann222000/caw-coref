Just curious if anyone around these parts is going to springing for
Vista any time soon (launch is tomorrow).

Me being me, and always having to have the latest and greatest, I
will go ahead and get it (although I'm not sure which version yet or
when).

My wife's PC, with only 376 megs of RAM won't, and I won't upgrade
her PC because she doesn't use it enough to be worth it.

I'll run it on my Mac via Boot Camp rather than Parallels (because of
the license restrictions on running in a VM).

Anybody else thinking of taking the plunge?

Don,

Not until I have to, probably when I buy a new computer (unless I go to
Linux at that time).

Earlier this month, I bought a new desktop machine that came with XP
Media Center Edition and also a free upgrade to Vista Premium. Â I'll
register for the upgrade and get it, but will probably put it on the
shelf until Microsoft comes out with the first Service Pack for
Vista.

I just got my first XP license last year, so I figure I won't get
around to Vista until about 2011!

Funny because I ordered my new desktop from Dell last Wednesday to get XP on
it. (and now Dell appears to ship with Vista preinstalled, and I don't see
an option to choose XP over Vista)
I know I will eventually upgrade, but like to avoid Vista until I'm sure it
runs reliably and all my apps run fine on it. Then I still need to figure
out which version I need to get.

There's only been one instance when I wished I hadn't upgraded and
that was when I upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows ME. Boy, was ME a
huge failure for Microsoft. (and me). But I bought Win2K, ME and XP
all within a week of release.

I'm not in a rush to get Vista, because it won't be my primary
operating system, so it may be a month or two before I actually go
out and get it. OS X Leopard, though, I will get the day it's
available since Mac OS X is my primary OS.

No. NoNoNoNo. Only when it arrives on a new machine, as far as I know
now. It could be that good press and user reviews will convince me
otherwise, but for the moments I'm in to XP for the long haul.

It's an OS. Big deal. I've used a dozen OS'es the last year, and there will
be more. Unless it makes me coffee, I don't care. Apps are the killer app,
and they're lame for winders, and getting lamer.

It's all about how I can do my work and (digital) play, and access my
data. I want to stay away from Vista because it threatens to make it
harder to access my data and use the computer the way I want to. As
long as an OS properly runs on my hardware, reads my text files, my
iPod, my Palm and my Alphasmart (as Jesper says, "the apps", it's OK
with me. XP does all these things just fine (Linux doesn't,
unfortunately). Vista probably will, but I have to pay for it. So
forget it.

I don't agree about lamer applications, though. It's true that Office
is ridiculous, but there are many, many other applications running
under Windows that do what they're supposed to do in the way they're
supposed to do it. I'm just glad that so many open source applications
are available, since I use so many of them under Windows (Firefox,
Vim, OpenOffice, ClamWin).

I will spring for Vista shortly after Charlston Heston gives all of his guns
to Hillary Clinton for her to melt down into slag. Now if it comes on a new
computer I will have to take it (unless of course I can keep on buying XP
copies in the secondary market)

Lee,
I agree. All the things I need or want to run on my computers run fine on
XP. So to me, Vista is no big deal. Some day I will undoubtedly buy a new
computer, and at that time I will probably move to Vista, but that probably
won't be for several years.

Here's a chuckle. We received a memo from M$ at Office Depot, telling us
to notify our customers that their Vista-based PC's may take from 10-25
minutes on first boot, with nothing more than a blue or black screen.
"Do not return the product as defective or call Microsoft support. The
manufacturers are aware of the problem, and we are working to resolve
the issue."

Sheesh...I thought Longhorn was finally *out* of beta.

Here's an article by Michael Geist on the legal muck involved in the
Vista EULA. I was glad to find this, since it summarizes a lot of what
I've heard here and there about the evils contained therein...

http://tinyurl.com/38shcc

Of course, product activation is nothing new. But I read some of this
stuff to my 17 year old son tonight and he got really upset at
Microsoft. We had an hour long discussion about business and law. So I
guess that's a good thing...

Sorry...I missed your question. It's a dog...a resource hog...a computing
nightmare. Let's break that down a bit, shall we?

- It's a dog...
- The hardware requirements to run Vista efficiently are
horrible...on a scale, they are far worse than those to run XP
at release. I
was able to run XP pretty well on a 512 MB Celeron 500, which I
had when it
was released. No such luck with Vista. The only thing that will run OK on
lower-end hardware (like what you probably have on your desktop
or lap now,
according to MS) is Vista Basic, the version which offers few compelling
reasons to upgrade. My training on Vista told me that, "Tom uses
Vista Basic
to surf the web, check email, compose documents, and stay in
touch." Hmm...I
can do all that pretty well right now.
- It's a resource hog...
- As I mentioned before, I can get the benefits of Vista (and
better hardware compatibility...yes, really) running Ubuntu Linux with
Compiz on my 512 MB 1.46 GHz Celeron M. No such luck with
Vista...Vista Basic would barely run on here.
- It's a computing nightmare...
- With Vista (as you pointed out, Lee), you give MS control of
your computer. They control your media, your playback quality,
the way you
run your software, and potentially even your software. You place
your whole
computer in their hands and let them go to town, all in the name
of DRM and
security. DRM...well, the MPAA and RIAA have MS in their hip-pocket--but
security? *nix systems have had that down without sacrificing control for
over 40 years.

In summary...in my opinion, it's a bunch of hype over nothing. Total cost to
upgrade to Vista =
$price of Vista Home Premium (at least) + $price of hardware upgrades to
support VHP - my freedom.

No thanks. I'm done with MS.

The circle is about to close. We are moving back towards an app driven
world, which is what the PC took us out of in the early 1980's. Back then,
nobody cared about the OS. All that mattered was the applications and the
data, and that they were compatible backwards and forwards. We're back there
again. I predict appliance computing, which ubiqutous synchronization
between devices and web based datacenters, with the option of not synching
but only running "live" for sensitive and/or throwaway devices. We'll see
the day when we can go buy an ebook reader in a chewing gum machine, loaded
with the books we want, which we throw away when we've read them.

A new OS is a whoopee-effing-doo today. Some people care, but they are fewer
and fewer. Not even Steve Ballmer playing the ape on stage can drum up much
enthusiasm anymore. When something *truly* groundbreaking shows up, like OSX
or the near-future XGL/Aglx based Linux OS which will show up RSN, people
will sit up and pay attention. But the bar for that is set so high now, it's
near-impossible for an organization with the oil tanker like
maneouverability of Microsoft to create something like that.

Apps are the killer app. On winders today, there are many apps, but they
don't play well together. This will be the undoing of winders. Not today,
not tomorrow, but in the slightly longer perspective, when others create
systems which interoperate *between vendors*, and Microsoft continues to try
to impose its own standards on everyone, while locking everyone into their
own solutions as the best choice, they will wither, their stocks will no
longer rise like a Saturn V on steroids, and smart, young people will no
longer go work for Microsoft earning measly pay for long hours while waiting
for their stock options to vest.

I do most everything except play games in a web browser today. Many people I
know are the same way. I make industrial robot development tools which run
in a web browser. I make industrial application infrastructure which is
based on XML, XML-RPC and customized web browsers. OS is immaterial today,
except for the legacy apps still being churned out by Siemens, ABB and the
like. I run everything on whatever happens to be nearby and handy. Microsoft
do not make that easy, but they make it possible, as they have to, and that
will be the end of their hegemony. Although they will only give that up
kicking and screaming.

I have been expecting the app appliance for some time. To an extent, that is
what my PDA is, but I had to build it and maintain it. On my desktop I have
had a very stable environment for several years now. Occasionally I upgrade
a piece of software such as Quicken, but that is an annual or biannual event
at best. My apps do what I want, they all run reasonably well together, and
I feel no need for any new apps. Of course I have almost zero interest in
computer games -- I prefer to read to relax. But the only app I added to my
laptop/desktop environment in the last year is a magazine reader for
electronic magazines. I do a fair amount of Web computing -- I even do my
e-mail directly on the Web and never open Outlook on my desktop. That lets
me do my email on any computer connected to the Web -- for instance on
computers in the press room at conferences. And by virtually eliminating
downloads (except for specific items that I expect ahead of time) I cut way
down on the chance of accidently downloading malware. To me my laptop is an
appliance.

So what does Vista offer me, besides a total upset of my existing
infrastructure, which is working well? As to the 30 minute first boot and
all the DRM problems, there is an old addage in the computer industry,
"Never buy Version 1.0 of ANYTHING." That goes double for Microsoft. Their
first releases are always buggy. Have been for 25 years. Why does anyone
expect htat to change today?

The big problem for Microsoft (and other software vendors who depend on
license sales for their base income) is that sales are no longer driven by
new capabilities that people want. My word processor does everything I want
today (and that has been true since Word 7.1). Quicken does everything I
want today, and in fact buying the latest version was a waste of money (not
a lot of money, fortunately, as they gave me a huge discount on the
upgrade). I would like to see some improvement in the Audible.com client,
but that is free and I can live with its issues. I don't use all the
features of Firefox as it is. And that, plus the magazine reader I needed
for an online magazine I wanted, are about 90% of my Windows computer use.
Windows XP is stable and runs the apps I need, which is all that I need in
an OS. I know that it has some vulnerabilities and a lot of baggage that I
don't need, but really as long as it is stable I am happy.

Now if someone can give me precise directions for accomplishing the same
thing in Linux, and if I can find the old laptop my Aunt had that we have
somewhere, I might try duplicating my environment on that in Linux. And if
that works then I will probably say good-bye to Windows. But as for buying
Vista and trying to put it on either my laptop or desktop, why? What single
thing does it do for me?

Exactly, Bert. The answer to your question: nothing. That's why I thought my
training was so sad...it underscored the fact that Vista means nothing to
most users. In fact, many are scared to upgrade because of the interface
changes. And those who need to upgrade think that they have to because XP is
going to stop working or something.

This will be the very first time I won't be using the next Windows OS as
my primary OS.

I just recently moved to XP, but only since the latest versions of
Adobe's suite require it. Well, that and the games, of course!

However, like many others here, the DRM and "you don't REALLY own your
computer" type vibe I'm getting from Vista is totally shoving me away.
I have no plans to buy a new monitor anytime soon. Â 24" widescreen is
just fine, and will be fine for many years.

Oh, I mean, unless I want to watch hi-def movies in Vista. Â *sigh*

My setup will be this:

Ubuntu Linux: primary OS
XP: Used to run Adobe apps I can't run via Wine in Ubuntu.

The setup once XP is no longer worthwhile will be this:

Ubuntu Linux: primary OS
Mac OSX: used to run Adobe apps and any other commercial software I
can't get for Linux
Vista: on a separate Shuttle SFF box that will be used solely for games.
I'll treat it like a console.

Have the shuttle box and the desktop hooked up to a KVM switch and I'll
be good to go.

It's amazing to me that I'll actually have a Mac sometime in the next
year or so. Never thought that day would happen!

I took the plunge last week (through MSDN). I have to say that the
install process was streamlined. After three days of a clean (legit)
install Vista crashed ir-repairably. The Vista install disk couldn't fix
the problem and system restore didn't help either. Some of my older
hardware that I've inherited (HP scanner) won't work.

For posterity, I have Vista running on a Core 2 Duo with a Gig. of RAM.
All in all it's a refresh of XP. I'm happy with it but see no reason to
suggest someone pay to upgrade to it.
