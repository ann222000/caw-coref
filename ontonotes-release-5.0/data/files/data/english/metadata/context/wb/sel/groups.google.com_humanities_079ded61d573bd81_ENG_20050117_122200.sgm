Is literacy in decline? Are we as a society becoming less literate? Are
schools doing a good job in regard to literacy? What are the best
methods of teaching literacy - phonics or whole language? Any views?

I have a friend who is around 21 and he never learned to read. The
school he went to just kept passing him until he greaduated. I don't
understand why they would just give up on him like that. You MUST be
able to read to graduate. I asked him if he wanted me to teach him, but
he was not very interested. I don't see why his mom won't. It takes
time. Every day she or someone like me should give him reading lessons.
I want to help him, but he's too lazy.
By the way I have organized a group here in google groups, and it's
called Thought Club. You should come see. I tried to get that Gary
Childress guy to come but I don't think he got my message. I got some
good thinkers in my group and I would like you to join. You start good
topics.

Tyler Durden. Nice name.

I have a mother that loves words, and thus I have grown up surrounded
by books. My mother spent several thousand dollars that she didn't have
on a Catholic school for me and my brother so that we could avoid whole
language. Through this and her obvious passion for the written word,
she has imparted a deep understanding and love for literature and our
language into my brother and me. I spent my english classes identifying
independent clauses and diagraming sentences, and this joined my love
with and understanding.
While avoiding whole language could only be a benifit, is has hardly
paid off in droves. It has not made me into a better man or improved my
sex life dramatically, but I have become a better writer and
communicatior as a result. Additionally, I think that as society moves
towards more streamlining and less understanding, we move deeper and
deeper into a soceity dominated by mindless drones.
I can definatly say that the love for literature has dyed out,
especially among my peers. I'm a high school junior, and I know only a
handful of people with whom I can hold a literary discussion. A
frightenly large percentage of my classmates don't even recgonize
titles like War and Peace and Othello, works once universaly known, if
not read. Again, society moves away from knowledge to efficancy, and
the thinking man's position in the world drops another rung.

Hi Rosewood, is the controversy between phonics and whole language
really the big issue? Hasn't school as an institute has moved away from
education towards entertainment, fun and baby-sitting?

How do students get familiar with words? Right, by using them. The more
you read, write, talk and listen, the more you become fluent in any
language and the more you gain understanding of words and grasp and
appreciate the full meaning of subtleties. The key is to use language -
the more you are confonted with words, search for that one word that
says exactly what you mean, the more your grammar and verbiosity will
improve.

But what's happening at school? Children sit there, expecting to be
entertained by a teacher who - in an desperate attempt to oblige -
writes the word DINOSAURS on the blackboard. This week, we'll have
dinosaurs agaion as a theme!

Should a teacher write: di·no·saur ( P ) Pronunciation Key
(dn-sôr) n. - extinct, often gigantic, carnivorous or herbivorous
reptiles of the orders Saurischia and Ornithischia; they were chiefly
terrestrial and existed during the Mesozoic Era. [New Latin Dnosauria,
group name, from Dnosaurus, former genus name : Greek deinos,
monstrous + Greek sauros, lizard.]

Or should a teacher draw a dinosaur on the blackboard and tell the
children to all make such a drawing?

My view is that - to improve literacy levels- children should simply
start reading and writing and it doesn't matter much what they're
reading and writing about, they can read and write about dinosaurs or
anything else, as long as they start reading and writing. Once you
start with that, you'll improve and if you can get feedback and
guidence, all the better, but the ley is to do it!

I think it's not so much a controversy between phonics and whole
language, but it's a question of teachers that educate or teachers that
don't. Just my 2 cents. Anyone else?

I know a little Tolstoy. Not his books, but his philosophy. He needed
religion to cope with reality. A lot of people do. 45% of Americans
beleive in creationism.
I'm reading a really good book right now called Sophie's World. This
thirteen year old girl starts getting letters teaching her the history
of philosophy from some mysterious philosopher. I'm half way through it
and I love it. Each chapter goes over a certain period of time starting
with the naturalists to the realists to religion and finally to
science. It is by Jostien Gaarder. Check it out!
And visit my google group: Thought Club.

School librarians are doing a very good job in promoting literacy in
schools being involved in such initiatives as Building Bridges. Sadly,
in some schools, they do not get much support from subject dept.
teachers. Even the English depts. can be bad at making full use of the
library.
My fiction stock is well used but I cannot say the same of my
non-fiction books. Teachers seem to prefer giving out handouts or
using the Internet rather than encouraging research.

Sophie's world is a great book to read. I still enjoy it now and you
all sound years younger than me! I have tried to get pupils to read it
but they think it looks too much like hard work

I understand your thoughts regarding teachers being entertainers and
babysitters, many people who have not spent much time in a classroom
feel this way.

As a teacher, I spend many hours devoted to teaching students not only
to read, but to understand what it is they are reading. I have
comprehension competitions, give out rewards just for completing books,
and spend a great deal of time allowing children to share their
enthusiasm for specific books in the classroom. My junior high
students read an average of three novels per month (more reading than
many adults).
Writing is not neglected either in my classes. We focus on content,
grammer, and penmanship, something that seems to be a dying cause with
the influx of computers. I mark 16 hours every second weekend, at the
expense of time with my family, but former students have come back to
tell me the difference I have made in their lives, and how much easier
High School seems to be because they know how to write an essay, or
they can understand the structure of the stories they read.

Children will not just start to read and write on their own. They need
motivation. Parents and community need to support the push for more
literacy and spend time in the schools reading to kids. Imagine if all
stakeholders cared enough about the learning of children to spend time
reading to kids, or listening to a child's story, instead of placing
that responsibility solely on the shoulders of a teacher. What a
wonderful world it would be.

Many students don't like to read and I used to be one of them. But I
honestly don't recall why I didn't like reading. I suppose it could
have something to do with the fact that the only books up until high
school in its entirety were children's picture books when I read them
to the kids I used to babysit. I always told my teachers when they
asked me why I didn't read because I never got passed the first chapter
of a chapter book because I never payed attention to what I was
reading, so I found it boring.
When I entered high school I still stayed away from books, but english
teacher shoved books in front of my nose until I finally read one. I
decided to give it a try and I loved the book so much I didn't put it
down until I was finished.

Parents can do more to encourage their children to read and they can do
so by buying or borrowing books that appeal to the interests of their
children. Many kids love to watch cartoons on TV and many blame things
like this for a decline in literacy. But how about using this interest
to make children read? Why not buy a comic book or another type of book
with their favorite cartoon figures in there? Perhaps there will be a
lot of drawings in there, but if they love the book, the kids will also
wonder what the text says.

School is the problem. Just keep your kids out of school and they'll
become creative human beings. Reading and writing? ..well, that takes
time and it develops by itself. Children need to be interested in
something.. once they are, they'll start reading more about it. Schools
don't want children to communicate. In class, stuidents typically have
to be silent. They're not allowed to email or chat or send text
messages by phone. School is the problem!

What about numeracy? In Australia, 159 Bachelor of Education students
were given a Year 8 maths test. None got full marks and only 17 scored
the mastery level of 80% correct answers. The most common errors were
in rather simple maths. It appears that many school leavers simply lack
maths understanding.

Rote learning and drilling in exercizes isn't going to improve
understanding. Students must learn to think, to listen, to communicate,
to use logic, to write comprehensible sentences. Same with reading.
Phonics and repetitive spelling exercizes are boring and they do not
contribute much to understanding. School must make more sense.

The problem is with school itself. School doesn't make sense.
Homeschoolers have proven to be more successful, without spending
millions on teacher preparation, school buildings, computers and sport
facilities. Yet, educators refuse to admit it. They're just out to
protect their own profession. If we continue to let educators reserach
what's wrong with education, then we won't get much further. Ask any
homeschooler and they'll give you the asnwer, for free!

I read about that! It said that 25% of those who were studying to
become primary school teachers failed a Year 8 maths test.

Yeah, isn't it pathetic! And these &quot;educators&quot; have the gal to force
our precious children into classrooms under the pretence that we as
parents are not fit to educate them!
