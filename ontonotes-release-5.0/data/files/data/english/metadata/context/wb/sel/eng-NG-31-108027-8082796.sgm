The title of Toss Your Cookies (Gamewright Games, 2007 - Idea Zone
Product Development) sounds a bit disgusting - perhaps a game pointed
at adolescents with low- brow humor (&quot;toss your cookies&quot; is an
American euphemism for vomiting).  And even though I'm constantly
advocating designers to find new themes, I'm certainly glad that the
title has nothing to do with this.  Rather, it's actually about
tossing cookies onto the table - a game well suited for young
children.

With wonderful drawings and terrific, sturdy components, Toss Your
Cookies is a nice variant on the game idea introduced in the public
domain &quot;spoons&quot;.  Players are attempting to collect cookies that are
of the same type, along with a glass of milk.  While the game might
bore adults (although there's some frenetic moments which are quite
hilarious), I've found that kids enjoy it - as much for the simple,
fun game play as well as the beautiful components.  Although we really
want to eat cookies when the game is over (the artwork is THAT good),
it's a good kid's game that I enjoy playing with them, and it handles
up to eight players.

Eight different round cookie tiles are included with the game: Iced
sugar cookies, gingerbread men, fortune cookies, generic &quot;Oreo&quot;
cookies, chocolate chip cookies, macadamia nut cookies, fudge swirl,
and fruit center cookies.  One set of six identical cookies is used
for each player as well as some &quot;wild&quot; cookies and &quot;half-eaten&quot;
cookies, which, along with a single milk card, total seven cards for
each player.  The tiles (cards) are shuffled face down on the table,
and each player draws seven of them.  Two custom six-sided dice are
given to the player who last ate a homemade cookie, and the game is
ready to begin.

On a player's turn, they simply roll the two dice and take the action
indicated by the combo.  The combos that occur can be:
-       Whichever player has the milk must pass it to the player on their
left (or right).  Before doing so, they may draw a random card from
that player's hand.
-       Same as above, but the player receiving the milk card is the player
rolling the dice.
-       The player rolling the dice chooses another player, who must swap
the number of cards with them shown on one of the dice (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,
or &quot;all&quot;).
-       Everyone passes the number of cards shown on one of the dice to
their right (or left).
-       The player with the milk card must toss it into the center.
Everyone else makes a grab for it, with the player who snags it losing
a random card to the former milk holder.
-       Everyone must toss a certain number of cards into the middle of the
table - face up.  Everyone then grabs the same amount as quickly as
they can, filling their hands back up.

The game continues until one player has five of the same cookie type
(wild cards act as any type of cookie) AND the milk.  They should then
shout out &quot;Snickerdoodle&quot;, causing them to immediately win the game.
Players can also choose to play a certain number of rounds, with the
person winning the most round being declared the final champion.

Some comments on the game...

1.)     Components:  Each of the cookies is a large round cardboard tile,
showing a depiction of a different type of cookies.  While the cookies
are not actual pictures, they are certainly drawn well enough to evoke
salivation from players and cries of hunger for cookies.  The cookies
are so realistic looking that I sadly have bite marks in one which one
of my children thought was an enjoyable snack.  The pleasant theme is
one that will attract kids to the game, and anyone who still has the
urging for the joy that is known as &quot;cookie&quot;.  The dice are of the
highest quality, chunky white six-sided dice, with the symbols clearly
engrained with different colors to help differentiate amongst them.
Everything fits into a nice plastic insert that fits in the smallish,
bright-colored box.

2.)     Rules:  The rules are only four pages and mostly are composed with
the instructions on how to form the initial composition of the deck
(determined by the number of players), and what each combination of
the dice means.  Frankly, the combinations are simple, and players
catch on fairly quickly after only one explanation.  The game says
that the age range is &quot;eight&quot; or older, but I can easily see a six
year old playing this game - it's easy enough to play.

3.)     Craziness and Fun Factor:  Really, the game is one of sheer
silliness.  It seems like at least once a game, players roll the combo
&quot;toss&quot; and &quot;all&quot;, which result in an instant madhouse.  It's really
quite funny to see players scramble madly to get all the correct
cookies they need.  Almost as funny, and certainly vicious, is when
the milk itself is tossed.  Fingernails should be clipped before hand,
and I can guarantee you that the milk card will look the most worn
after a while, although it's fairly obvious most of the time who has
it anyway.  It's the silliness of the tossing, which happens on 1/3 of
all rolls, that makes the game entertaining and keeps it from being
simply another Spoons clone.

4.)     Strategy:  I'm sure that you can surmise from the rules that any
strategy in the game is fairly basic.  Players simply attempt to get a
large group of cookies (wild cards if possible), and then try to get
their hands on the milk card.  This is excellent for small minds,
though, as it gives them some simple strategy ideas that they can
nurture and use as they get older.

5.)     Ages and Players:  The game is an excellent one for young
children, especially for early elementary.  But even older kids will
find laughs yanked from them as they laugh at the craziness that
occurs when a toss occurs.  For these same reasons, the game is
certainly preferable with large groups, although it seems to work okay
with four (three? - nah.)  With a large group, the tossing can get
insane and will likely appeal to teens and kids more than adults.  But
it's not that more frenzied than Pit, the card game.

If you have kids and/or like cookies, this game is a no brainer.  And
who doesn't like cookies?  But with fabulous components, and simple,
manic game play, Toss Your Cookies is a game that children will
request again and again.  Even my very young children, who couldn't
grasp the mechanics, wanted to play with the cookies; and it made for
an enjoyable family game.  While the name may be disgusting, the game
is anything but!
