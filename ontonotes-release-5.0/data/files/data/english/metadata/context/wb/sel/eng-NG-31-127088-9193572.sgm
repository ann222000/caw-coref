I am a newlywed; a little over a month.  Everything's great between my
husband and me.  He's my best friend and I can count on him for
everything. I trust him with my life.  He is DEFINITELY not the
problem.  I'm the problem. Or better, I think I love another man.  We
dated off and on for a few years, but because of age differences (he's
8 years my junior) we never worked it out.  But when I see him... I
can't explain it.  He makes me feel things that no one else ever has.
Part of me thinks it's just the sex (phenomenal, BTW), but deep down I
know it's more.  We have remained friends and in fact he was at my
wedding.  But I heard afterwards, in a drunken stuper, he cried over
the fact that I was gone.  Did I mention he was all over my cousin
that night, too?  Talk about trying to get me back.  Why, if I'm happy
with my husband, am I even having these thoughts?  Someone please talk
to me.  I cannot talk to anyone in my life about these feelings and
I'm afraid it's going to affect my marriage.  Is this normal?

I have no idea if it is normal or not. My thoughts on this subject are 1.
Why did you marry if you still carried a flame for this other man? 2. So you
love your husband? There are all kinds of love. Best friend. Trustworthy.
These are fantastic traits, but they don't necessarily mean husband and wife
love.

I am concerned about marriage doubts one month into the marriage. Did you
have these doubts before you got married? If not, why do they crop up now?
If yes, what made you decide to proceed?

These are tough questions, and I don't need the answers to them. But I think
you do. In my opinion, you need to

1. Cut out contact with the other &quot;friend&quot; until your feelings on this
matter are clear.
2. Get thyself into counseling to work out the aforementioned questions or
the ones a skilled professional (which I am not btw) gives you to help you
sort out how you got here and where you go from here.
3. Use very reliable birth control very reliably. Now is not the time to add
a child to the mix. All decisions get more difficult when a child is
involved.

Best of luck!

Yeah, you messed up.

I hope your feelings for this other man are just some fantastical
obsession of yours.  That you feel like you want what you can't have
or some thing.
You better cut the ties with him, at least for awhile, no friendship
nothing, and focus on your husband and making it work.
On the other hand if you feel you don't love your husband and want
this other man, end it now, don't waste another moment of HIS life.

One other thing.  How is this old boyfriend trying to get you back
when he is getting loaded and slobbering all over your cousin??  Does
not really sound like a winner to me.

Who knows why you're having those thoughts.  The important thing here
is that if you do love your DH, then break off all contact with your
X.  To feel the way you do about him, and apparently him about you, is
not a friendship, even if you do currently keep your contact with him
friendly.

Break it off.  If you can do that, then you'll know that you truly do
love your husband.  If you can't, then it may be that you're really in
love with the other man, and your DH is really only your friend.  But
whatever you decide, do it openly and honestly.  If you're having
contact with the other guy, or you ever will have contact with him,
and you can't tell you DH the truth about having the contact, and the
full nature of the contact, then you're cheating.  Moreover, all this
contact with the OG, however innocent, will simply get in the way of
your relationship with your DH.

You're still at a cross-roads you should've chosen long ago.  Decide
which way it's going to be, choose a road, and then stay only on that
road.

I'm going to say something which sounds condescending, but isn't meant
to be.  &quot;Grow up!&quot;

What I mean is that something all of us have to face is that the world
is full of interesting attractive people.

One approach to life is to have as many relationships with as many of
these people as one can.  There is nothing wrong with this approach,
and many people spend some of their life in this mode - some people
spend all their life in this mode.

Another approach (and this is the one people who are getting married
are usually taking) is to say:  &quot;OK, I've chosen this good person whom
I love to build a lifetime relationship with.  That doesn't mean I
won't ever meet other people who excite me, but it does mean that my
desire to build a life with my spouse is more important than the
excitement of being with other people.&quot;

So choose, and commit.  If you are in the first mode, get divorced,
and stay unmarried until you feel firmly in the second mode.  If you
are in the second mode,  be committed about it, not half-hearted.

Didn't she say by getting drunk and being *all over* her cousin, that

During my bachelors there were a few women that were good sexually..
however, there was one that stood out amongst all.  She was {{{{steamy
HOT}}}} and is to this very day; did I say I am married;-)
Haven't seen her for years either.  Yet, if I encountered her at some
chance point - I know my blood pressure would raise a bit.  I spooked to
a few of my female and male friends about this to see if they had a
similar experience - each said yes; immediately recalled someone, and
they too are married.

So, I wouldn't worry.  Oh, and I surely wouldn't attribute the tingling
feelings tied to recollections of him for LOVE.

First of all, you are very much normal.  The best of us encounter this
kind of conflict in marriage. But you've got to stop thinking like a
girl and act like a woman!  What you feel for this EX is not likely to
be anything more than lust, let's be honest here.  You are much more
likely to regret losing your husband than an immature ex-lover.
Hitting on your cousin in a drunken stuppor raises all sorts of red
flags honey!!! Also, just because you *feel* something, doesn't make
it credible.  You'd do well to consider the words of Jeremiah the
prophet who says: &quot;The heart is deceiving above all things&quot; Jer.
(17:9).

Finally, you need to know the this has already affected your
marriage!  The idea that you cannot talk to your husband about this is
a problem.  A very similar situation happened to me and my wife.  And
we overcame it precisely because she talked to me about it.  My
listening to her and allowing her to get it off of her chest relieved
her of the guilt she experienced by wondering about an old-flame that
kind of showed up out of no where.

In the meantime, your relationship may be a little young to be able to
resolve this without some counseling so consider that.  To answer your
original question, as long as you've not already acted upon you
passions, you haven't messed up, YET!!!!  You must guard your marriage
and protect your husband by CUTTING THIS OTHER GUY OFF!!!!  Don't
allow yourself to enter any compromising situations.  You should treat
this situation as cautiously as you would handle a lit book of matches
around an open gas can.

&quot;Is this normal?&quot;  Well, YES, if you are a drama queen, addicted to
pain, and willing to screw up everybodies lives for your own
deviant motives.

It seems that you don't really know what you want, or why.  The minute
you make a commitment and begin to live with it, you
exhibit buyer's remorse, wishing you had chosen differently, and
feel sorry for yourself in a situation of your own making.

By all means, do find a good counselor before you screw up again.
Left untreated, you are likely to ruin your marriage, hurting an
innocent party, just to attempt (and fail again) with your ex-flame,
leaving everyone the worse for the wear and tear of their
heartstrings.

It is very likely that you have some deep-seated issued going back
to your childhood, that few here are really qualified to address.

Make no mistake . . . YOU . . . ARE . . . DANGEROUS !
If you don't want to be responsible for creating a major emotinal
trainwreck, take action now.  Get help, get your head straight, and
remove this confusion from your heart.

Best of luck,
Larry G.

I'm a little late to this party, but I wanted to add...
When I told a woman for whom I had the hots in college that I
was getting married (to someone else), she said in a seductive
tone,  &quot;Rog', isn't there anyone elso who you'd rather run away
with?&quot;  I paused, and said, &quot;No, I can't think of anyone.&quot;

I knew instinctively that she was trouble with a capital &quot;T&quot;, just
as I think you know that this other guy is, too.  What it takes is
a conscious decision to do what is in your LT best interest,
and not act on a silly physical implulse that could haunt you
forever. =R=

I think it's normal if you got married without being truly sure you were
ready. You can love your husband very much, think he's a terrific guy and be
enjoying being with him very much yet be scared at the reality of commiting
yourself to him forever.

The old friend/current-and-future-lust object is probably just the way you
are explaing your feelings to yourself. Everything *should* be right in how
you feel about your relationship but it isn't and Mr sexy-but-unsuitable is
how you're creating a more obvious problem to pin your lack of confidence in
your choice of husband.

Be very careful how you proceed here as you could permanently damage your
husband's trust and love for you. Get yourself into some counselling and
work out what you really want right now. Do you want to build a future with
your husband or not? The other guy is just a distraction for you at this
point so avoid him as much as possible while you get yourself sorted out.

I was thinking that this might be a perfect example of what I was
talking about on the Confession thread: that cheating can have at its
roots a fear of intimacy, which is why the most common times for
infidelity to occur include birth of a child, death of a family
member, cross-country move, retirement..... and immediately before or
after the wedding!!!

The ink is barely dry on the wedding certificate, which makes it all
reality. Reality of an intimate, one-on-one relationship can be scary.
So what the OP is doing is inserting a third party into that
relationship, to make it a more comfortable triangle. Even if she
doesn't actually cheat or conduct an affair, having her emotions and
feelings for this man is enough to make him the third point. As she
allows her mind to fly into fantasy and wondering about &quot;what if&quot; she
is effectively turning away from her new husband and placing distance
between them.

But I think you can be sure you're ready and have a lot of confidence
in your choice, and still find yourself suddenly terrified at the
reality of committing forever! Maybe that's just me though. And, I
think it's very common  to be scared of intimacy, so it doesn't mean
there's necessarily anything wrong with the OP.

Damaging to the marriage? Yes - if you believe that the whole idea of
marriage is to become increasingly intimate with your spouse, and
that's the sort of relationship you were hoping for.

LOL ... reason I never married the gal I referenced...even though she

I wasn't suggesting you were bad at relationships.

I was suggesting that you choose:  either devote yourself to building
a long-term relationship with one good person (which is a good and
valuable thing to do), or devote yourself to enjoying serial
relationships with many people (which also has its good points).  But
decide, and commit to the decision.a

Sometimes it is hard.  I know jen already mentioned the ideas in this

It shouldn't be but it might be for you who has been taught that love and
trust don't go together. Actually, I can't see how you *wouldn't* find it
difficult to let yourself risk being close to any man, no matter how much
you love him. It sounds like you've gone a long way towards that goal but
have you received any counselling or therapy for the abuse you've suffered?

Does your husband know about your mistreatment or has that been too hard to
share? I think you will have to work together on this.

Based on what you've shared so far - you need more counseling for a few
reasons; all of which will take it's toll on your relationships,
surfacing in cloaked behaviors causing confusion and unresolved
emotions.

You can NOT do it alone... Until you address the deeper issues that are
obviously still present you'll struggle; and those in your life with
healthy emotions towards you will be short changed until you can love
and trust naturally.

I am very sorry to hear of your protracted sexual abuse.  Having had
relationships with victims of sexual assault, and spoken at length
with therapists who treat both victims and the perpetrators of these
crimes, I believe that your problems will persist and grow worse
without prompt and extensive counseling.

To imagine that you can undo the warping influence of a horrific
childhood is to risk all future relationships and happiness for fear
of the work that actually needs to be done.  Your assertions that
you have &quot;grown up&quot;, and that you &quot;refuse to be the victim&quot; are
both wrong and counter-productive.  Childhood trauma often stunts
proper development.  And left untreated, your history will likely
come back to haunt you in all kind of terrible ways.

One of the therapists, who treats sex offenders, has noted the
&quot;uncanny&quot; or &quot;cosmic&quot; coincidence that while a number of her
clients had NO PRIOR HISTORY of sexual deviance, the women
they were married to had been victims of childhood sexual
misconduct.  Do you really want to select or steer your husband /
men towards sexual deviance so that he / they can molest your
children?

Please find a counselor to work on this with, for the sake of your
children if not yourself.

Best of luck,
Larry G.

The suggestion that the OP seek more therapy may be sensible, but

God, I am glad you said something Doug.

The woman is trying her best to overcome something so horrible I
cannot even image, and he wants to pile on blame and responsibility if/
when her husband becomes a sexual abuser???

Nothing was her fault, nothing is her fault, and I certainly would not
think it would be her fault if her husband turned out to be an abuser.

I have heard the cycle theory also;  sometimes a girl who has been
abused might end up marrying an abuser as a woman.  This makes a hell
of a lot more sense to me, then a woman transforming a perfectly fine
man into an abuser.

The notion that one partner can steer the other into becoming like
the people she knew as a child comes from Dr. Harville Hendrix
in the book &quot;Getting the Love You Want&quot;.  Writing of the Imago, the
mental/emotional image of all of one's childhood care takers, an
associate of Dr. Hendrix noted:

&quot;. . . people either 'pick imago matches, project them, or provoke
them.' &quot;

This is consistent with my own belief that as adults we seek to
reestablish the conditions, situations and circumstances of our
childhood, for any number of reasons.  Most importantly:

1. Having survived childhood under those conditions, we associate
those known conditions and our developed coping skills with survival.

2. Recreating our childhood allows us to again take up former
challenges which had been unresolved.

3. They allow us to recreate ourselves through our children by giving
them the same challenges, hoping that we can get it right this time,
through our younger proxies.

I am aware that this may sound a bit like blaming the victim, but
the &quot;evidence&quot; seems to indicate that they too play a substantial
role in these affairs.

I understand your desire to absolve the woman of any guilt for
her victimization as a child, and extend that sympathy to
remove any blame for anything she might do as a result, in the
future.  However, I believe that such &quot;politically correct&quot; thinking
may be damaging to others, especially innocent men and
children.  Please understand that if your (commonly expressed)
assertions are in fact wrong, others will suffer.  And I doubt
you would want that kind of guilt on your conscience, would you?

The therapist who made that statement considers herself a &quot;victim
advocate&quot; and has many years of experience in trying to combat
and correct sexual deviance.  I would value her cumulative
experience in such matters much more than I would our idle,
less informed conjectures, preferences and suppositions.

While you are correct in noting that such women may indeed be
selecting partners with a higher potential for sexual deviance, it
should be evident that these women are the factors which transform
that potential into actual sexually criminal behavior.  (As stated
earlier, the sex offender husbands had NO PRIOR HISTORY of
sexual deviance until they married former victims.)

Finally, let us look at how we assign responsibility for crimes and
other wrong-doings.  If a person is abused as a child, or is witness
to abuse, and they grow up and commit or encourage acts of
abuse themselves; are we to hold them blameless for their own
wrongful actions?

The courts (in the U.S.) don't seem to think so.  People are sent
to jail or prison for their actions.  Their past is seldom considered
even a mitigating circumstance.   Now, I for one, would like to
see more effective treatment of offenders, where their pasts can
be explored, and current behavior corrected.  But I would go further
in correcting the people whose counsel, advice or actions encourage
criminal conduct.  That includes CEO's, rap-stars, abusive parents,
wayward sports figures, and unhealed victims.

Just my  opinion.  Your mileage may vary.

Cheers,
larry g.

Depending on the personality - very true.  Sadly, though a theory that's
not popular with certain idealistic/romantic folks, and or those that
take up therapy as a way to learn about themselves, later calling it a

That is a rather strong conclusion.  It's also something that people
need to watch for.  It's very easy to gravitate into relationships
that mirror those in which we grew up, for men as well as women.
Those relationships are what we're used to, what we're comfortable
with.  What is difficult is to knowingly choose partners who will
truly be *partners* if one has grown up not experiencing that type of
relationship.

Larry - your untrained inclusion has improper implications even though

in a counseling session at some juncture with an abuser doesn't qualify
you to include a such an extreme statement either; even if you follow it
with &quot;please find a counselor.&quot;

Larry was wrong by including such extreme behavior!

That said, unfortunately, whether acknowledged or unimaged - such
behavior happens.  The behavior he's speaks of doesn't mean an abused
person will seek out and &quot;actually&quot; change someone to accommodate
certain behaviors; it's the person will find attraction to those
personalities traits that have the potential to evolve to accommodate
one's poor self-esteem.  Many of these women frequent S&amp;MB&amp;D world
because they've become so accustom to abuse.  What is aberrant behavior
evolves in such a manner, the mind finds a venue where it's acceptable.

By the way; you're &quot;cycle theory&quot; &quot;where a girl who has been abused
might end up marrying an abuser as a woman&quot; is QUITE common.  More
germane though, such behavior is NOT limited to those inflicted with
childhood abuse.  It spans many ill behaviors, some more common place
then most want to face.

SD, it's refreshing to see someone acknowledging this.  It really gets
tiresome to read/hear &quot;this didn't happen back in the day.&quot;  It's been
around forever, and it will continue to be around for those who don't
do anything to change that cycle of behavior.

Of course I would absolve any woman of being sexually assaulted as a

That does not prove much.  The connection still could be that without

support the cycle theory.

At any point do people have to take responsibility for their own

This only shows that the victim then turns to predator; not that the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The courts (in the U.S.) don't seem to think so.  People are sent

&gt; be explored, and current behavior corrected.  But I would go further
&gt; in correcting the people whose counsel, advice or actions encourage
&gt; criminal conduct.  That includes CEO's, rap-stars, abusive parents,
&gt; wayward sports figures, and unhealed victims.

Well yeah!  The person who commits a crime needs to have a punishment
dealt out.  Sure I would like to see some of these abusers get
treatment, *in prison* though.

First, I think that if someone who abuses was abused as a child, yes
*their abuser* should be held accountable as well.  I am not sure how
you go about that though.  An old man who abuses because hie father
abused him, well his father might already be in the grave by now.

Second, I don't have any idea how *her* actions as a abused victim
could transform a *normal* adult with no past history into a molester,
rapist, etc.  If you can give me a couple good examples of how that
could happen I might be able to flip-flop my opinion or at the very
least consider this theory.

Here I will state something tremendously un-PC.  You hear of plenty of
murders, rapists, etc. out in the world *claiming* abuse as children.
Some may be true claims, some may not.  But, in my opinion, punishment
must be dealt.  At some point when you turn into an adult, or hell
even earlier, when you figure out the difference between right and
wrong, *that* is when you are accountable for your own actions.  There
might be other variables in there (ie. prior abuse, psychotic breaks,
etc.)  and even this theory of someone *pushing* you into doing
something, but that does not excuse the crime(s) committed, at least
not to me.

My opinions of course.  And yes, our mileage varies.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To imagine that you can undo the warping influence of a horrific

&gt; &gt; The woman is trying her best to overcome something so horrible I

&gt; &gt; Nothing was her fault, nothing is her fault, and I certainly would not

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything. I trust him with my life.  He is DEFINITELY not the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.  I'm the problem. Or better, I think I love another man.  We
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dated off and on for a few years, but because of age differences (he's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8 years my junior) we never worked it out.  But when I see him... I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can't explain it.  He makes me feel things that no one else ever has.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Part of me thinks it's just the sex (phenomenal, BTW), but deep down I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know it's more.  We have remained friends and in fact he was at my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wedding.  But I heard afterwards, in a drunken stuper, he cried over
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that I was gone.  Did I mention he was all over my cousin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that night, too?  Talk about trying to get me back.  Why, if I'm happy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my husband, am I even having these thoughts?  Someone please talk
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me.  I cannot talk to anyone in my life about these feelings and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm afraid it's going to affect my marriage.  Is this normal?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you all for your words of advice.  Some were harsh (but I needed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to hear them).  Some were judgemental (but not knowing the whole
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; story, understandable).  And some hit home.  I think this is more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about my fear of intimacy than anything.  I get the whole counseling
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing (been there, done that), but I'd hate to rock the boat with my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband over a simple case of cold feet.  It might be better for him
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not to know about this.  And just to clear the air, I have not, nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will I ever cheat on my husband.  I am not a cheater.  I've seen first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand what infidelity does to families and I will not bring that evil
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on myself.  The EX is out of the picture.  The only reason he was at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the wedding is that he is my brother's friend (and obviously my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cousin's too).  We don't speak, don't live in the same state even.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He's no physical threat to my relationship.  I think the idea of him
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the biggest issue, but that just brings me back to the intimacy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issue.  I know I have this problem.  I have a hard time trusting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people, especially men.  I finally found one I 99% trust and I'm going
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to hold on to him with everything I have.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In response to the 'Grow Up' comments.  I did grow up.  I grew up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being raped repeatedly by almost every 'man' in my family.  So if I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; less than perfect at relationships, I could blame my history, but I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; refuse to be that victim.  Am I afraid?  Hell yes!  I've never let my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walls down like I have with my husband.  Maybe that's what I'm most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; afraid of.  Letting him in and being hurt.  But he's given me no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason to fear this.  I know this is my problem, I'm trying to fix
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.  I want to love and be loved.  Is that so hard?

It is understandable why so many would reject such unpleasant
assertions, but good wishes and personal preferences have
precious litttle to do with the reality we live in.

If you, or others, have experience, observation or other evidence
which runs counter to my thesis, by all means present it.  Until
you do, a rational reader will have little choice but to acknowledge
the plausibility of what I present based upon the experience,
observations and communication of those I've cited.

Other than the sources I cite, I have no evidence of my own to
present.  However, victims can and do participate in promoting
the deviance of others.  In one case related to me by a victim
herself was that she did not set up her husband to be an
abuser.  Instead, she took her children to the father who had
abused her as a child, and then abused her children.  This was
the way the father had instilled in her to gain his conditional love
and affection.

I will not dispute picking men with a history as established abusers.
However, the term &quot;potential&quot; is troubling because it is vague and
nearly meaningless.  All people over the age of twelve, and many
younger, have the innate capacity for evil, and most men have the
potential for sexual deviance.  I don't believe that most people

behavior based on all that I have experience, heard, read or seen.
As for &quot;provoking&quot; sexual deviance, how many times has this news

sex or intimacy than her husband, to the point that he was
contemplating divorce or adultery?  Women have a powerful influence
on the men in their lives, and vice versa.

Cheers,

&gt;&gt; sexual deviance until they married former victims.)

&gt; That does not prove much.  The connection still could be that without

&gt; support the cycle theory.

&gt; At any point do people have to take responsibility for their own

&gt;&gt; Finally, let us look at how we assign responsibility for crimes and
&gt;&gt; other wrong-doings.  If a person is abused as a child, or is witness
&gt;&gt; to abuse, and they grow up and commit or encourage acts of
&gt;&gt; abuse themselves; are we to hold them blameless for their own
&gt;&gt; wrongful actions?

&gt; This only shows that the victim then turns to predator; not that the
&gt; victim turns *others* into predators.  I hope you see that.

&gt;&gt; The courts (in the U.S.) don't seem to think so.  People are sent

&gt;&gt; in correcting the people whose counsel, advice or actions encourage
&gt;&gt; criminal conduct.  That includes CEO's, rap-stars, abusive parents,
&gt;&gt; wayward sports figures, and unhealed victims.

&gt; Well yeah!  The person who commits a crime needs to have a punishment
&gt; dealt out.  Sure I would like to see some of these abusers get
&gt; treatment, *in prison* though.

&gt; First, I think that if someone who abuses was abused as a child, yes
&gt; *their abuser* should be held accountable as well.  I am not sure how
&gt; you go about that though.  An old man who abuses because hie father
&gt; abused him, well his father might already be in the grave by now.

&gt; Second, I don't have any idea how *her* actions as a abused victim

&gt; could happen I might be able to flip-flop my opinion or at the very

&gt; Here I will state something tremendously un-PC.  You hear of plenty of
&gt; murders, rapists, etc. out in the world *claiming* abuse as children.
&gt; Some may be true claims, some may not.  But, in my opinion, punishment

This is inconsistent with your later claim that &quot; You hear of plenty

. . . But, . . . punishment must be dealt.&quot;

So, you are willing to absolve victims, yet punish them if they
become perpetrators?  That makes no sense.

The answer in, IMNSHO, is to treat both offender and victim to
ensure that the cycles of deviance end, and the required healings
begin.

Either a lot of men have these tendencies, or the women are

Of course.  Everyone should be responsible for their own actions.
However, that doesn't mean that society's methods of attempting

Prisons are little more than warehouses and future crime factories.

I can only repeat the above explaination of how people attempt to

the therapists I refered to, I don't have any wealth of case histories

There is a common assumption that all childhoods involve the
opportunity to learn right from wrong.  The reality is that all
children
begin by believing that everything they see others (adults and older
children) doing is simply the way things are and should be.  The
concepts of right and wrong are much more abstract than young
children can handle.  And by the time they are able to consider
such notions, they already have years of fundamental behavior
patterns firmly ingrained in them from watching others in real life.

What an odd conclusion!  The therapist in question wasn't

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surely, if this therapist is correct (and one therapists anecdotal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opinion is hardly strong evidence), the conclusion to draw is that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; women who have been abused tend to choose partners who are abusers or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; potential abusers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scaring her with the idea that her problems may lead her husband to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _become_ a sexual abuser seems way out of line to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The notion that one partner can steer the other into becoming like
&gt; &gt; &gt; the people she knew as a child comes from Dr. Harville Hendrix
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the book &quot;Getting the Love You Want&quot;.  Writing of the Imago, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; mental/emotional image of all of one's childhood care takers, an
&gt; &gt; &gt; associate of Dr. Hendrix noted:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;. . . people either 'pick imago matches, project them, or provoke
&gt; &gt; &gt; them.' &quot;

&gt; &gt; Assuming that is true (and I think there is something to it),  you

But the only source you cited was one anonyous therapist.

I can find therapists who believe in crystals, astrology, and
blood-letting.  That doesn't comprise an argument for any of those
things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  However, victims can and do participate in promoting

&gt; abused her as a child, and then abused her children.  This was
&gt; the way the father had instilled in her to gain his conditional love

It is unfortunate, but not terribly surprising that she entrusted her
children to her parent/abuser.

Nevertheless, this has nothing to do with your contention that abused
people can turn other people into abusers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand your desire to absolve the woman of any guilt for
&gt; &gt; &gt; her victimization as a child, and extend that sympathy to
&gt; &gt; &gt; remove any blame for anything she might do as a result, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; future.  However, I believe that such &quot;politically correct&quot; thinking
&gt; &gt; &gt; may be damaging to others, especially innocent men and
&gt; &gt; &gt; children.  Please understand that if your (commonly expressed)
&gt; &gt; &gt; assertions are in fact wrong, others will suffer.  And I doubt
&gt; &gt; &gt; you would want that kind of guilt on your conscience, would you?

&gt; &gt; Of course I would absolve any woman of being sexually assaulted as a
&gt; &gt; child.  And I would absolve any *real* victim of sexual abuse as an
&gt; &gt; adult also.
&gt; &gt; It is not political correctness to feel this way, it is empathy, and
&gt; &gt; knowing an *innocent* was victimized.

&gt; This is inconsistent with your later claim that &quot; You hear of plenty
&gt; of
&gt; murders, rapists, etc. out in the world *claiming* abuse as children.
&gt; . . . But, . . . punishment must be dealt.&quot;

No, it isn't.  She isn't saying abuse victims aren't responsible for
their actions.

She is saying abuse victims aren't responsible for being abused.

&gt; So, you are willing to absolve victims, yet punish them if they
&gt; become perpetrators?  That makes no sense.

&gt; The answer in, IMNSHO, is to treat both offender and victim to
&gt; ensure that the cycles of deviance end, and the required healings
&gt; begin.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The therapist who made that statement considers herself a &quot;victim
&gt; &gt; &gt; advocate&quot; and has many years of experience in trying to combat
&gt; &gt; &gt; and correct sexual deviance.  I would value her cumulative
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience in such matters much more than I would our idle,
&gt; &gt; &gt; less informed conjectures, preferences and suppositions.

&gt; &gt; If you say so.  Therapists are human too.  And a lot are kooks.  I do
&gt; &gt; think she would benefit from therapy from a good therapist.

&gt; She?  The therapist, or the original poster?

&gt; &gt; &gt; While you are correct in noting that such women may indeed be
&gt; &gt; &gt; selecting partners with a higher potential for sexual deviance, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be evident that these women are the factors which transform
&gt; &gt; &gt; that potential into actual sexually criminal behavior.  (As stated
&gt; &gt; &gt; earlier, the sex offender husbands had NO PRIOR HISTORY of
&gt; &gt; &gt; sexual deviance until they married former victims.)

&gt; &gt; That does not prove much.  The connection still could be that without
&gt; &gt; her knowledge her husband already had *tendencies*, which would then
&gt; &gt; support the cycle theory.

&gt; Either a lot of men have these tendencies, or the women are
&gt; deliberately selecting them for their deviant potential.  Either
&gt; way, the woman is acting as a catalyst for sex crimes, and
&gt; thus bears some responsibility.

No, neither way.

Women who commit sexual abuser bear responsibility for that.  Adults
who abuse children bear responsibility when those children go on to
abuse others.

Parents who know someone is abusing their children and fail to protect
those children bear some responsibility for that.

But a woman who chooses a partner who later becomes abusive bears no
responsibility for that.
