Question: Which Harry Potter movie was among the American Film
Institute's 400 nominees for the top 100 American films of all time?
Hint: It wasn't 1, 2, or 4 (5 hadn't been released yet).

&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; in addition to being the
best of the Potter films (notice that Alfonso Cuaron's vision of
Hogwarts, rather than Chris Columbus's, has defined the place in the
subsequent movies?), is a visually stunning work by any standard. In
fact, it's probably the most beautiful film of the last decade not
made by a director named Zhang. And the superb, evocative score is one
of the best of the decade as well, not to mention John Williams'
finest work in many years.

Here's hoping the Cuaron/Williams team returns to do justice to
&quot;Deathly Hallows.&quot;

Cuaron did a passably decent, if somewhat clumsy, job of creating a
Harry Potter film steeped in Cuaron's personal vision. But I'd prefer
what I saw Yates and Goldenberg do in OotP: A faithful translation
that succeeds as a film.

I agree that &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; succeeds as a film, but just
barely. It's good but not great, or even near-great, whereas &quot;Prisoner
of Azkaban&quot; is close to a masterpiece, IMO. And I'm not sure that
&quot;faithfulness&quot; is a useful analytic concept at this stage, with the
novels so long. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; film left out much, much more of the
story than did &quot;Azkaban.&quot; Moreover, the screenwriter is primarily or
at least equally responsible for the faithfulness of an adaptation;
using Cuaron for DH would not mean you would have to use Kloves as
well.

You really are having a laugh? I recall people ripping PoA to shreds, in
much the same way they did to GoF and OotP. Im not so sure that the
change of location was because of Alfonso Cuaron, but because they
couldn't really film at the original locations any more due to budgetry
constraints. eg, they actually built their own Privet Drive etc.

As for Williams! Cliched film scores if ever I heard them.

The guy hasn't done anything original since ET. Everything he does, it's
the same. Should have got Jan A.P. Kaczmarek or John Newton Howard.

Potter fans en masse are not the best judges of film quality, since
they place far too much emphasis on slavish literalism. (The same is
true of most fan bases.) Professional film critics responded to
&quot;Azkaban&quot; very positively. Why do you think it made the AFI's list of
400 best movie nominees?

Locations and budgets are beside the point; what Cuaron did was change

&quot;Goblet&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot; also have benefited from his re-conception of

*James* Newton Howard, actually. I agree that Williams sometimes
repeats himself, but probably no more so than any typical film
composer. And when he's inspired, he repeats himself much less than
the typical composer, because he has exceptional melodic gifts that
enable him to create distinctive motifs practically on demand. His
music for &quot;Azkaban&quot; was wonderful, and I think he would similarly rise
to the challenge of the Harry Potter finale. I'd hate to see (or

(&quot;Goblet&quot;) get the assignment again.

For HBP maybe. The &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; movie should be directed by Quentin

I definitely agree on Williams. The man is IMHO the most talented
composer alive. All (film and otherwise) composers have a distinctive
style which can be detected by a good ear. The one who repeats himself
wholesale is James Horner - same exact bars of music in film after
film using the flimsy excuse that &quot;there are only so many ways to
combine notes.&quot; I suspect the poster with the &quot;cliched film score&quot;
opinion 1) doesn't like the Williams style of music, and 2) wasn't
around in the 70's when Williams music was a revelation to some of us.
Please bring back Williams and ditch the hacks :). I'll bet JW only
left the series due to a conflict with &quot;Munich&quot; (he always does
Spielberg's movies) since he was happily conducting HP music at the
Hollywood Bowl last week. Howard would be better than what we have
heard in the last two movies.

IMHO, of course,

Of course its locations. Locations, sets etc. And if you recall Chris

Hehehe.

For me, DH has to be in the hands of someone other than Kloves
definitely, in the hands of someone who understand and translate a plot
to screen rather than the linear translations that's been foisted upon
us previously.

Hrm.

Peter Jackson anyone?

I don't think you can go far wrong with Goldenberg however. Loved Peter

That is true, but I wasn't talking about CGI. That's not what I meant

Well, we agree on this point at least. I do admit that the choice of
Williams for the final film would be -- should be -- less
controversial than the choice of Cuaron. Anyone who can't hear the

movies is beyond hope, musically.

You're certainly entitled to your opinion, but you have to understand

There is a difference between faithful and slavish.

Cuaron created a visual spectacle, but that visual spectacle was not
Harry Potter. Insofar as he was making a film called &quot;Harry Potter&quot;,
Cuaron failed.

Movie critics unfamiliar with the books are not the best judges

OotP might be longer but it's different. It has more description of

I doubt it, given that &quot;Prisoner of Azakaban&quot; is clearly the most well-
regarded of the Harry Potter movies among people who take films
seriously, as opposed to hardcore Potterphiles. Refusing to admit that
fact simply means that you're in denial. If there is any laughing
going on, it's probably snickering at the expense of fanatical types
who whine about adaptations that don't include every one of their
favorite paragraphs from the source material. The very fact that your
chief complaint is alleged &quot;plot holes&quot; indicates that your cinematic
judgment is highly suspect. &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; is a classic film even
though no one can satisfactorily explain the story even 60 years

That is the fundamental misconception that animates much fan base

adaptation -- they're judging the *film*. Endless comparisons to the
source material simply hinder one's appreciation of the film as an
independent work of art. Now, if the source is well known and the

giving a happy ending to &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; then giving the film
bad marks as a result of a lousy adaptation process can be warranted.
In most cases, however, obsession with fidelity to the source is an
obstacle to appreciation.

&quot;Transformers&quot; is one of the few examples of a film (other than
torture porn crap and similar grade-C material) for which the preview

I may be misunderstanding you, but you seem to be complaining about OotP
and comparing it to the book, while simultaneously saying the film

I thought I'd stick on PoA last night just to check it all out.

And I do really really like the movie. It's got some great effects
(certainly better than the first two movies), retained much of the
magic. And knowing where we are in Deathly Hallows, I do like some of
the touches Cuaron has put in.

But at the same time, I can't help but feeling that it is all in
detriment to the actual story and plot. And that's the thing Im getting
at. That's the only thing Im getting at.

I'd be happy if Cuaron did the DH movie, but at the same time, Im
convinced there is someone better out there with a better vision than
the &quot;It's a coming of age movie&quot;.

Then it just really peeves me off when (in other threads mind)
discussing how well the story worked and how we got to have some guy
with the same passion, appreciation and understanding of the story,
people start complaining about the special effects or the music score.

According to you, but the vast majority of film critics and

Make of that what you will, but don't pretend that the low opinon of

representative of the general attitude toward the film.

Actually, I'm not really complaining about &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; at
all. I commmented on it only because someone else (Justin Alexander)
brought it up. This thread was not intended to be about that film.

In general, I have no problem with analyzing or discussing the quality
or faithfulness of an adaptation from page to screen. I recognize that
this issue is important to readers, and it's important to me if I've
read the book in question. I just think it's a big, big mistake to
make such an analysis into the dominant factor in one's appraisal of
the film. Movie-making is an art that is not subservient to book-
writing. However, I've noticed that extreme book fans make this
mistake all the time, and not just those devoted to the Potterverse.
Some of the ugliest invective I've seen directed at the &quot;Lord of the
Rings&quot; films has come from geeks in the Tolkien newsgroup, because
they refuse to compromise on any aspect of what they consider to be
the ideal adaptation. Meanwhile, the rest of the world loves the
films, tolerates their flaws, and ignores the cries of rage from the
dark corners of the fan base.

Well, I personally had no difficulty at all in following the story as
presented in the film of &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban.&quot; For example, I thought
the time travel segment was one of the best, most coherent and
logically consistent time travel sequences I've seen in any film (and
I've seen a lot of time travel stuff). It surprised me how well it was
done. I believe that even Rowling commented that it was superior to
the novel's handling of it. However, I recognize that a story that's
clear to one viewer may be confusing or thematically vague to another.
But if 90% of the world gets it, and 10% doesn't, then those in the
10% should at least consider the possibility that the problem may lie
in themselves rather than in the film.

Well, you couldn't simply make &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; as a continuation of
&quot;Prisoner of Azkaban.&quot; I'm sure Cuaron would understand that. Maybe
there'd be more of the &quot;Children of Men&quot; tone. :)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Potter fans en masse are not the best judges of film quality, since
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they place far too much emphasis on slavish literalism. (The same is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; true of most fan bases.) Professional film critics responded to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Azkaban&quot; very positively. Why do you think it made the AFI's list of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 400 best movie nominees?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Movie critics unfamiliar with the books are not the best judges
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of movie adaptations of the books (any books).

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is the fundamental misconception that animates much fan base
&gt; &gt; &gt; griping about film criticism. Film critics aren't judging the
&gt; &gt; &gt; adaptation -- they're judging the *film*. Endless comparisons to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; source material simply hinder one's appreciation of the film as an
&gt; &gt; &gt; independent work of art. Now, if the source is well known and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; adaptation makes particularly ludicrous changes, such as Demi Moore's
&gt; &gt; &gt; giving a happy ending to &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; then giving the film
&gt; &gt; &gt; bad marks as a result of a lousy adaptation process can be warranted.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In most cases, however, obsession with fidelity to the source is an
&gt; &gt; &gt; obstacle to appreciation.

&gt; &gt; I may be misunderstanding you, but you seem to be complaining about OotP
&gt; &gt; and comparing it to the book, while simultaneously saying the film
&gt; &gt; should be judged separately to the book?

&gt; Actually, I'm not really complaining about &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; at
&gt; all. I commmented on it only because someone else (Justin Alexander)
&gt; brought it up. This thread was not intended to be about that film.

&gt; In general, I have no problem with analyzing or discussing the quality
&gt; or faithfulness of an adaptation from page to screen. I recognize that
&gt; this issue is important to readers, and it's important to me if I've
&gt; read the book in question. I just think it's a big, big mistake to
&gt; make such an analysis into the dominant factor in one's appraisal of
&gt; the film. Movie-making is an art that is not subservient to book-
&gt; writing. However, I've noticed that extreme book fans make this
&gt; mistake all the time, and not just those devoted to the Potterverse.
&gt; Some of the ugliest invective I've seen directed at the &quot;Lord of the
&gt; Rings&quot; films has come from geeks in the Tolkien newsgroup, because
&gt; they refuse to compromise on any aspect of what they consider to be
&gt; the ideal adaptation. Meanwhile, the rest of the world loves the
&gt; films, tolerates their flaws, and ignores the cries of rage from the
&gt; dark corners of the fan base.
">

I've never minded what Jackson cut out, only what he put in.  The
whole Ents not attacking then magically appearing when Treebeard
bellows was just incredibly silly.  There was no need to deviate from
the book.

As for OoTP, look at my &quot;OoTP an action flick&quot; post.  I'm willing to
bet that Yates never wanted to consult with Rowling on what was
crucial information for the future and probably had to have Kreacher's
appearance forced on him.

&gt; &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is no. 169 (listed alphabetically).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; in addition to being the
&gt; &gt; &gt; best of the Potter films (notice that Alfonso Cuaron's vision of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hogwarts, rather than Chris Columbus's, has defined the place in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; subsequent movies?), is a visually stunning work by any standard. In
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact, it's probably the most beautiful film of the last decade not
&gt; &gt; &gt; made by a director named Zhang. And the superb, evocative score is one
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the best of the decade as well, not to mention John Williams'
&gt; &gt; &gt; finest work in many years.

&gt; &gt; Dude, you must be smoking crack.

&gt; I believe the pipe is in the mouth of the beholder, Mr.
&gt; &quot;Trollshammer.&quot; :)

&gt; &gt; The producers of that abomination
&gt; &gt; mercilessly butchered the best HP story beyond all recognition. Many people
&gt; &gt; seems to agree, last I checked PoA was the less successful in the box office.

&gt; Please, not the tired old box-office argument. Raising the popularity
&gt; = quality canard is guaranteed to make you look naive. Anyway,
&gt; &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was a huge international hit by any standard; it
&gt; simply didn't rake in quite as many mega-bucks as the other films in
&gt; the series.

&gt; The claim of butchery is simply unfounded. The story and themes are
&gt; present and vibrant.

&gt; &gt; Visually stunning? Buckbeack was OK, but the werewolf was laughable as well
&gt; &gt; as the flying dementors. As far as stunning CGI effects go, PoA can't hold a
&gt; &gt; candle to the LOTR trilogy.

&gt; That is true, but I wasn't talking about CGI. That's not what I meant
&gt; by &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;stunning.&quot; My comparison was to Zhang; have you
&gt; seen &quot;House of Flying Daggers,&quot; for example? As a piece of visual art,
&gt; &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is far above the level of the other Potter
&gt; films; it's in another league.

&gt; &gt; I'll give you the soundtrack thing, but then
&gt; &gt; again, I've yet to listen to a John Williams soundtrack that is *not*
&gt; &gt; superbly done.

&gt; Well, we agree on this point at least. I do admit that the choice of
&gt; Williams for the final film would be -- should be -- less
&gt; controversial than the choice of Cuaron. Anyone who can't hear the
&gt; difference between Williams' scores and the scores of the last two
&gt; movies is beyond hope, musically.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's hoping the Cuaron/Williams team returns to do justice to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Deathly Hallows.&quot;

&gt; &gt; If you want to suggest a good director for the last two Harry Potter films,

Presumably, he will start with the summer at the Burrow and show them
spending a lot of time in each other's company. You are probably
correct, however, that he has made it harder on himself (or Goldenberg
has made it harder on Kloves :))
by reducing Ginny to such a minor figure in &quot;Phoenix.&quot;

I agree wholeheartedly with the second part of your statement, but
disagree with the first part. I would rephrase it as, &quot;POA wasn't 100%
faithful.&quot; On the whole, it is a very faithful adaptation of the
novel. Book fans nowadays seem to have extremely high standards for
fidelity in adaptations. There are still some people who gripe that
the 1995 BBC/A&amp;E miniseries version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; took a
few liberties, despite the fact that it devoted five hours of screen
time to a relatively short novel, preserved all sorts of subplots and
minor characters, and incorporated large amounts of original dialogue
into the screenplay. Truly unfaithful adaptations are things like the
happy-ending-obsessed Hollywood bastardizations of mid-century, or
title-only rewrites such as &quot;I Robot&quot; or the James Bond flicks. In
fact, all five of the Potter movies have been quite faithful by
historical studio standards, with the latter two somewhat less so
because of the greater length of the novels. This may be small
consolation to the fan whose favorite scene gets left out of the film,
but we should try to be objective.

Ahh yes, now, this is the interesting thing. By stripping away some of
the more intricate moments, the story arcs with the various
relationships, they're free now to cut down on budget. They could
probably dispense with Ginny for the next couple of movies. Anything to
do with Snape and Lily, well, they can concentrate on in the seventh movie.

They can focus on more of the main plot points.

After all, DH is just a convenient story of dueling between Harry and
Draco! No need for anybody else. Not really. :-)

Do tell. Please cite these plot holes. I await with bated breath.

If they're book plot-holes, at least Cuaron didn't fuck up the books

&gt; &gt; And I'm not sure that
&gt; &gt; &quot;faithfulness&quot; is a useful analytic concept at this stage, with the

Knowing the difference would be a good start for Yates.

So did Yates. That &quot;visual spectacle&quot; of the goopy magic for about an

boring as hell, but it also doesn't freaking happen except with
brother wands! Stupidest moment of any of the films, hands down. Even
worse than Gambon slamming Harry into the wall in GoF.

What an inaccurate nitpick! I think you're wrong in that, anyway. In
the book, all Sirius cared about was getting Pettigrew. He was
quite...rabid...in his dealings with all 3 kids, until Lupin arrived.

You might want to consider a reread.

Growling in front of the Whomping Willow might have just been to
forestall Harry, either to protect him from the Willow, or to give
Sirius time to sort out Pettigrew. Nothing absurd about that.

I don't think so, because the opinion of an expert on film quality is
at least relevant to the question of a film's quality. Not definitive,
mind you, but relevant. On the other hand, the link between box office
receipts and quality is pretty much nonexistent.

Yes, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; was beautifully spooky, and in fact &quot;Prisoner of
Azkaban&quot; reminded me of it at times. If Burton could be trusted to
handle &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; in a similar fashion (minus most of the gore,
however), he might do a very good job. I think he's rather
unpredictable, however, and could just as easily come up with
something in the semi-farcical &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; vein. I doubt that the
producers would take a chance on him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; memory, completely botching it as a clue for the next two movies.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He completely botches the setup for Harry's relationship with Ginny by
&gt;&gt;&gt; leaving out the most crucial scene, her reassurance to Harry that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasn't been possessed, from one who knows.
&gt;&gt; And, he completely missed the whole emotional scene with Harry after

&gt;&gt;&gt; OoTP may be the best at keeping the pace up, but it is the worst at
&gt;&gt;&gt; tying in the movie the the rest.  PoA was great at both.
&gt;&gt; POA wasn't faithful but Cuaron dare a lot with it and it worked.

&gt; I agree wholeheartedly with the second part of your statement, but

Oh, I agree. I never meant to say that PoA wasn't completely faithful
either. The thing with PoA is that it missed the whole Marauders plot,
my favourite part (and yet, I can forgive) but still kept the dark tone.
And changing some part of the plot was a good touch, as for keep us
those who had read the book and knew how it was going to end, still
interested-

On the whole, it is a very faithful adaptation of the

Agree.

Book fans nowadays seem to have extremely high standards for

&gt; fidelity in adaptations. There are still some people who gripe that

&gt; few liberties, despite the fact that it devoted five hours of screen
&gt; time to a relatively short novel, preserved all sorts of subplots and
&gt; minor characters, and incorporated large amounts of original dialogue
&gt; into the screenplay. Truly unfaithful adaptations are things like the
&gt; happy-ending-obsessed Hollywood bastardizations of mid-century, or
&gt; title-only rewrites such as &quot;I Robot&quot; or the James Bond flicks. In
&gt; fact, all five of the Potter movies have been quite faithful by
&gt; historical studio standards, with the latter two somewhat less so
&gt; because of the greater length of the novels. This may be small
&gt; consolation to the fan whose favorite scene gets left out of the film,
&gt; but we should try to be objective.
