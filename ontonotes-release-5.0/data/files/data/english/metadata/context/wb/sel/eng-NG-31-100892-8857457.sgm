I think everyone dreams when sleeping.

Today I saw a dog sleeping near the gate. I thought what is this dog
doing?

Then I understood it is sleeping. I also sleep. When I sleep I dream.
I dream of Human beings I have met.

What dream the Dog gets? Does he dream of other Dogs. The Food and
about his owner?

Do every animal bird and insects dream?

Or it is only Humans that dream? Think about it and let me know what
you think.

Coincidentally, my dog woke me up in the middle of the night last
night -- he was whimpering and whining in his sleep, which he is prone
to do on occasion. I woke him up to relieve the stress. I imagine he
was having nightmares.

Perhaps he was dreaming about past traumas . . . the time the Rotty
had him by the throat, for example. My guess is that he was more
likely dreaming about the traumatic event from earlier in the day. I
was walking him in the morning near a construction site, and they
dropped a huge stack of steel girders and it made an extremely loud
crashing noise. He was shaking and terrified and pulled me all the way
home, where here proceeded to run upstairs and crawl under the bed.

We'll never know for sure though.

&quot;If you're a pet owner, you've probably already guessed that the
answer to this is YES! But are they really dreaming - and if so, what
in the world do they dream about?

Many scientists say there is evidence to support the notion that dogs,
cats, and in fact, every mammal that's been studied, does experience
dreams.

There are two main types of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and
slow wave sleep (SWS). SWS and REM sleep in pets are very similar to
that of humans. During this time, the brain processes information
learned during the day. Think of it as sorting new information into
different mental file folders.

At some point during these two kinds of sleep, dreams take over - in
humans as well as in pets. Thus, the twitching, tail wagging, yipping,
and pawing your dog does in his sleep, or the tail whipping,
chattering, yowling and swatting from your napping cat is likely a
reliving of whatever experiences he's had while awake.

Of course, human dreams also get a lot of their material from the
imagination, which makes us wonder if dogs and cats have imaginations
in addition to memories! (Anyone who has witnessed their playful cat
pay attention to something that's seemingly not there, and then react
to it, is likely to believe their cat must have an active
imagination!) Ever heard a dog dreaming? Listen &gt;

In humans, scientists have found that when awakened during REM sleep,
the subject has reported having a dream. During the REM sleep, the
human brain has a lot of &quot;gamma activity&quot; going on, just like it does
when the person is awake. This means that essentially, the brain is
behaving just as it does when conscious. Since every mammal studied
shows the same brain activity during REM sleep as us humans, it's not
such a leap to believe that your pet really is dreaming.

Ok - not every mammal studied has the same brain activity. The duck-
billed platypus experiences more REM sleep than any other mammal, yet
its brain activity is completely different during this time of sleep.
However, this should come as no surprise from a mammal that lays eggs.

Adult dogs spend about 10 to 12 percent of their sleeping time in REM
sleep. Puppies and kittens spend a much greater proportion of their
sleep time in REM sleep, which makes sense since they've been so busy
all day exploring their new world. They have tons of new data to
process, sort and store into their memories.

So the next time your pet has an unusually exciting experience during
the morning, pay special attention to his behavior while he naps that
afternoon. You might just catch your pet reliving the past - in
dreams!&quot;

I dream of the Earth burning. Magical fires that leave things pitted

I dream of the people screaming. Roaring in pain. For their sins.

I dream of monsters (Good monsters) opening out of dimensions,
entering Earth and helping to destroy the humans for being evil,

I dream of dimensional ships in the sky, opening up the sky to other
dimensions, and bringing God to Earth, to judge the humans for their

I dream of flying around like a maniac, in the ordinary streets,
despite that no one believes I can fly. If they annoy me too much, I
just pick them up and throw them around in the air. Or place them
ontop of buildings they can't get off of, and won't let them down
until they admit that I can fly. Or kick their heads flying directly
above. Or fly so vast and knock them down. Serves them right for
ignoring the fact that I'm flying :) If they didn't deny that I can
fly, i wouldn't do it to them!!!

I blame the absence of psychedelic logic, euphoria and freewill as
the
main reasons ADP has morphed into it's current dip.  But, it goes in
cycles and I've seen it much lower and in much sadder condition than
it
is currently.  I've watched the group fall to the point it resembled a
rotting sliver of raw flesh overlooked by the buzzards and laughing
hyenas and then rising to a peak cluttered with madmen, morons, trolls
and
psychos and all points in between.  The lights on the runway are
strobing as
they call in the next wave of revelator planes to land engaging their
retro-
thrusters and the trash can tops flapping as they gobble the bags of
filth
and slime begging for the next festering bag of garbage to land in the
can.

Next month it will peak with celestial light workers preparing the
world for
the accension and on and on it goes --- after all this is an
alternative NG
devoted to all relating to, of and about psychedelic drugs -- so, you
can
expect anything to swoop down on us at any time and from any
direction. Deal
with it nd go with the flow.  As it moves on it's all good in its on
little
way.

Experiments have shown that there is a strip of neurons which when
activated turn off the ability to move your muscles, and in cats when
they cut this strip of neurons the cat sleep walks. This might allow
for the strange part of dreaming since we lose connetion with the
constraints of the body and we can fly around.

Memories can access and influence experience, we probably practice the
things we have learned over the last couple of weeks, trying to
integrate it into and along with our more long term memory. We have
about 20 minutes of dreaming every hour and a-half, REM, or rapid eye
movement periods. Deep sleep inbetween where we are more or less dead
to the world and vulnerable.

......In a sparse distributed network - memory is a type of
perception.....The act of remembering and the act of perceiving both
detect a pattern in a vary large choice of possible patterns....When
we remember we recreate the act of the original perception - that is
we relocate the pattern by a process similar to the one we used to
perceive the pattern originally.

Why Do We Sleep? Why Do We Dream?

Going Inside
by John McCrone
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Going-Inside-John-McCrone/dp/0571201016

- Does sleep have a purpose? Do you really know what its like to
dream? The answers may surprise you. Feature by John McCrone from
Frontiers, March 1999. -

FIRST, WHAT'S THE EVOLUTIONARY PURPOSE OF SLEEP

Every night we shut our eyes, slip the moorings of consciousness and
enter the confused limbo of sleep and dreams. But why? Couldn't
evolution have allowed us to take a nightly rest without this
apparently dangerous loss of awareness? Or do we need to sleep because
the brain has to have its time in dreams?

Despite nearly 2,000 sleep clinics around the world investigating this
vital subject, scientists still seem, ahem, a little in the dark about
the answer. But first a few of the facts that are certain. Sleep is a
universal among animals. Even cockroaches have moments of quiescence.
Their antennae will droop and they will become insensitive to gentle
stimuli. Fish and reptiles also have their drowsy periods while birds
and mammals have proper sleep cycles.

And don't be fooled into thinking that humans are the great slugabeds.
Humans average seven and a half hours sleep a night. True, large
ungulates make do with less. Giraffes sleep as little as two hours a
night while elephants and cattle sleep about four. But for the rest of
the mammalian kingdom, sleep can seem to be what they do best. Cats
and lions will happily nap for 18 hours a day; sloths, armadillos, owl
monkeys and opossums will snooze away just about as many; while bats
can go 20 hours - they might come out at night, but not for very long
it seems.

And once scientists began tapping electrodes to the heads of sleeping
animals and humans, they found that all higher mammals and birds share
a similar sleep cycle. Recordings of the brain's EEG rhythms - the
crackle of neural activity - show that sleep has a distinct pattern
with phases that in humans follows a 90 minute period. First we
descend through four increasingly deep stages of slow wave sleep - so
named because the EEG rhythm changes from a busy jagged buzz to a slow
relaxed throb. At its deepest, it becomes very difficult to rouse a
person from slow wave sleep. The sleeper may take fully a minute to
become orientated. This is also the time when people are liable to
sleep walk (see box) or, in children, wet the bed. Then after an hour
and a half of this slow wave slumber, the sleeper's brain will rise
back through the levels before eventually convulsing with its first
period of REM - a sleep stage as dramatic as it is misunderstood.

In REM (which stands for rapid eye movement) the eyes leap about in
their sockets as if chasing some phantom vision. Electrodes show that
the brain is highly aroused as if back in a waking state. The body
also seems a bit out of control with the heart pumping, temperature
control gone awry, and blood pressure all over the place. But despite
this metabolic furore, outwardly the sleeper appears at his or her
most inert as REM also brings on complete motor paralysis. A
neurochemical block is put on messages entering and leaving the
brainstem, preventing any movement apart from a few twitches.

When sleep researchers first discovered REM sleep in the 1950s, they
found that subjects awoken during this stage invariably reported
having vivid dreams. Putting two and two together, REM sleep became
dreaming sleep - an idea that has stuck in the public mind. But in
fact it has since been shown that dreaming of a sort goes on all night
long. Subjects roused from slow wave sleep can usually tell of vague
ruminations or mundane fantasies.

David Foulkes, a psychologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia,
says these slow wave dreams seem identical to the kind of drifty
daydream thinking we have during idle moments of waking. The only
difference is that in our sleep, our mental experiences create no
permanent record. Each thought is forgotten almost as soon as it
occurs. Foulkes says the dreams of REM sleep are certainly brighter,
more emotional, and more bizarre. But these differences are mostly
ones of internal arousal level than of mechanism. So whatever the
reason for our having dreams, it cannot explain the different stages
of the sleep cycle. REM sleep simply increases the intensity and
detectability of something we were already doing.

Our first REM period of the night actually lasts only a few minutes.
But as the night goes on, the REM phases grow longer until much of our
time in the last few hours before waking are spent in REM. With such a
strikingly set pattern of sleep in both higher animals and humans, it
is natural to feel that it must serve some equally defined purpose.
And yet the best current explanations for the sleep cycle are
surprisingly prosaic.

Certainly, there is much support for the idea that sleep is
restorative. In the depths of stage four slow wave sleep, when brain
and body activity is turned down about as low as it can go, there are
surges in various growth hormones. Some researchers have claimed that
the adolescent body can grow as much as a centimetre at this time of
night, as if the body is taking advantage of a time when it can devote
itself entirely to building and repair. And feeling good in the
morning is linked to the quality of our slow wave sleep - if we toss
and turn without properly hitting stage four, then we wake feeling
rough. But sleep is not completely mandatory because humans have
lasted a couple of weeks awake and despite being dog tired, could
still rouse themselves to beat sleep researchers in games of pinball.
And while laboratory rats will die after some weeks of sleep
deprivation, it seems to be a collapse of the immune system that
actually kills them.

Another favoured theory is that sleep is a good way of saving energy.
This certainly seems true in small animals - bats and hummingbirds go
into a hibernation-like torpor when they sleep - but the metabolic
savings are not actually that great in larger animals. Even deep stage
four sleep sees a drop of just 20 percent while the rest of sleep
hardly differs from just lying still all night and resting.

Then there is the ever-popular idea that sleep - especially the wild
activity of REM - might play a special role in the fixing of memories
accumulated during the day. Dreams often seem like a confused riffling
through the memory banks or - shades of Freud - the surfacing of
repressed thoughts. However careful work by Avi Karni of the Weizmann
Institute in Israel seems finally to have put paid to this theory. It
is already known that it does indeed take time for the brain to
consolidate a memory trace. Growth changes are needed to strengthen
the connections between brain cells and so turn a jangling pattern of
neural activity into some more permanent record of an event. By
testing subjects at intervals after learning a task, Karni showed that
this hardening process goes on in the background all during the day
but seems to be interrupted during the metabolic drop of slow wave
sleep. So slow wave sleep actually appears to suspend the fixing of
memories. Then in REM sleep, the fixing resumed - but Karni argues
this is only because REM is near enough a waking mental state in terms
of arousal levels. There is nothing special about REM itself.

Summing up the various findings, Jim Horne of Loughborough
University's sleep lab says slow wave sleep seems the key. It is a
necessary downtime for certain kinds of renewal. But this job only
takes the first few hours of the night and the question is why we then
stay asleep in dreams? His answer is that it is simply safer. Leaving
an animal exposed all night with a fully alert and worrying mind would
only lead to trouble. Much better to keep it in a state of
unremembering, dimly sensing, dream rumination. In this view, REM
sleep would merely act as a way of regularly bringing the mind back
close to the surface without actually awakening it. Horne says that
while it may not always feel like it, we can tumble out of the REM
sleep phase and go straight into action. So it turns out then that our
slumbers are mostly just nature's way of keeping us all out of
crepusculan mischief. Now there's a thought to sleep on.

That's evil.

Do you even need to kill some cats to figure that out? Or did they
just do it for the hell of it?

My guess, is that they are evil, and already knew that our brains
disable sleep walking, but decided to pretend they couldn't know it
unless they killed some cats to sacrifice to their gods. The god of
denial, of course. Or something like that.

&gt; despite that no one believes I can fly. If they annoy me too much, I
&gt; just pick them up and throw them around in the air. Or place them
&gt; ontop of buildings they can't get off of, and won't let them down
&gt; until they admit that I can fly. Or kick their heads flying directly
&gt; above. Or fly so vast and knock them down. Serves them right for
&gt; ignoring the fact that I'm flying :) If they didn't deny that I can
&gt; fly, i wouldn't do it to them!!!

But your still pure good, right, drug-addict asshole?

I get a kick out of knowing that you're going through life as a bitter and
resentful loser, and in the end you'll die without seeing any of your stupid
fantasies coming true and that'll make you even more bitter. Ha ha.

Why not go play on some train-tracks, drug-addict asshole?

&quot;Some... see things as they are and say why.
I dream things that never were and say why not.
Now, the first set is a lot smaller than the second set.
The second set is non-constructive, and for all practical purposes
infinite.
Like, a 13-headed giraffe has never been instantiated by natural
selection,
and do we really need such a construction?
In that case asking &quot;Why not?&quot; is inappropriate behavior.
I must get back to sleep now and sleep, perchance to dream..
Have a nice night.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I dream of the Earth burning. Magical fires that leave things pitted
&gt;&gt; &gt; but coloured, not black.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I dream of the people screaming. Roaring in pain. For their sins.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I dream of monsters (Good monsters) opening out of dimensions,
&gt;&gt; &gt; entering Earth and helping to destroy the humans for being evil,

&gt;&gt; &gt; I dream of dimensional ships in the sky, opening up the sky to other
&gt;&gt; &gt; dimensions, and bringing God to Earth, to judge the humans for their
&gt;&gt; &gt; evil.

&gt;&gt; I see.  After the burning, wholesale torture, and monster attacks comes
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; trial for which we will be sentenced to burning, wholesale torture, and
&gt;&gt; monster attacks.  &quot;First we'll hang them, and then we'll give them a fair
&gt;&gt; trial.  Then we'll hang 'em again!&quot;

&gt; Did I say it would be in that exact order?

Ah, so these are just random doom-dreams.  There's no particular order to
which bitter revenge fantasy you choose to indulge.
