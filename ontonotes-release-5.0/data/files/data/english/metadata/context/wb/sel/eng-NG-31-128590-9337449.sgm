Friday, August 13th, 1880

Local and district News.

We are glad to learn that the health of the Countess of Carnarvon has
undergone material improvement since her return to the family seat,
Highclere Castle, new Newbury.  The Countess is now able to take daily
drives in the park and neighbourhood.

Mr. Stafford *HOWARD* and Sir Wilfrid *LAWSON* have left London for the
season.

At the late anniversary meeting of the Royal Archælogical Society, Mr.
R.S. *FERGUSON* was elected a member of the Council.

The Lord Bishop of the Diocese has instituted the Rev. T. *GREGSON*,
M.A., to the Vicarage of Rusland, Lancashire; the Rev. T.B.C. *WREN* to the
Rectory of Corney, Cumberland; and licensed the Rev. T.G. *HOLT* to the
Curacy of Cartmel, Lancashire.

The Cumberland Volunteers will not take part in the great review on the
Knavesmire, York.  The expense would have been great, and to the corps in
the west of the county the journey there and back would be onerous in the
extreme.

The Directors of the North British Railway have appointed Mr. W.
H. *BARLOW,
*C.E., President of the Society of Civil Engineers, to prepare plans for the
reconstruction of the Tay Bridge.   Mr. *BARLOW* was one of the
commissioners of the Board of Trade to inquire into the cause of the
disaster.
