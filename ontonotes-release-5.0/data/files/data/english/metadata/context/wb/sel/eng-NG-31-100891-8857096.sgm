UPDATE:
Well, I took them to the vet today for a few different reasons.  Both are
starting to come around to me.  The vet said they dont have mites, but I
still have a feeling, so I bought some spray that is very mild and wont hurt
them.  She said they have the very beginnings of a respretory infection, so
she gave me some meds for them to prevent them from getting sick.  I also
found out that the treats i have been giving them are not good, even though
they love them.  I've been giving them greenies which look like little tooth
brushes for dogs.  i get the tiny ones, and figured they were a healthy treat
for the boys.  The vet informed me that they are 50% protien, so it is giving
them a very upset stomach, and that they are having really bad stomach
problems because i have been giving them one every day.  Part of one every
week is okay, but not one each every day!  So i have to stop giving them the
greenies for a while until their digestion gets better.  She said they will
perk up a lot too once they feel better.

I talked to my friends, and they said that they had their cat there for the
last 2 weeks, so i think the cat was messing with the rats, which caused them
to lash out.  Scat is not biting anymore, and both seem to be okay.  Neither
are like they were, but I'll just take it slow and treat them like any new
rat I had.  We will just have to wait and see if they can come back.

On another note, Im kind of shocked that i havent received any responce.  A
few months ago this group jumped on any topic brought to us, and yahoo's
group never responded.  This time I got no response from this group, and a
ton from the yahoo group.  I'm just suprised.

&gt;I am so completely lost, and I dont know where to turn, so I am turning to
&gt;you guys.  As most of you know i went on vacation to my parents house out of
&gt;state for 2 weeks.  Because it was such a long time I figured that since I
&gt;would be gone so long, and because it is a 13 hour drive, and since my
&gt;parents have cats that eat mice that I would leave them with my friends who I
&gt;trusted completely.  I obviously made a huge mistake leaving my pets in their
&gt;care.  I came back today to find that their cage had not been cleaned even
&gt;once since I left.  Everyday I put a small cup of baby food in their cage to
&gt;kepe them hydrated, and insted of doing that they would put the whole jar in
&gt;the cage.  Scat has become a biter drawing blood on both the people I left
&gt;them with.  They lived in absolute discusting-ness.  I am so angry and
&gt;frustrated that I dont know what to do.  They said that I need to get rid of
&gt;'Psyco rat' as they call Scat... but I am blaming the behavior on the fact
&gt;that they are confused and very angry because their cage is so nasty (by the
&gt;way, he has not tried to bite me even once since I got him home and cleaned
&gt;the cage, not even when I gave him a bath).

&gt;Both rats have changed so much.  Both are very cut off.  Before I use to come
&gt;to their cage and give them kisses, but both now hide from me when I come to
&gt;the cage.  Before if I opened their cage they were both running to get out
&gt;wanting to crawl all over me... now they do everything possible to hide from
&gt;my hand.  Please tell me what to do!  I will never leave them again with
&gt;anyone but myself since clearly I cant trust them.  I hate that the people I
&gt;considered to be friends and who I trusted to care for my pets would treat
&gt;them the way they did.  Do you guys think that once they become use to the
&gt;fact that I am caring for them again, and that they will never be treated
&gt;like that again, that they will return to their normal selves?  Please tell
&gt;me what your opinion is.  Do you think they will go back to normal?  Do you
&gt;think they can become the friendly and loving rats that I had before I left
&gt;town?  Please help.

Your first post never appeared, I read it from Pergrines re-post.

Poor guys, they must be really traumatised. They are biting out of fear and
confusion.
Take things slowly , let them make the moves, find a safe area where you can
sit with them
out of the cage and let them come to you, keep some cheerios at hand for
them to take.
The cat and the people you considered to be friends must have totally
freaked them.
If they can leave the cage uncleaned it makes me wonder just what else they
are capable of,
you don't know how much trauma they suffered. As for them calling telling
you to get rid of Scat
I know who I would be getting rid of! If violence is not in your nature then
at least never speak to them again.
Tar is over 2 now and he bites anyone (drawing blood) who invades his cage
space,except for me, he is not vicious, just territorial.
He is fine with anyone when he is outside the cage. My friends are all aware
of this and don't hold it against him :-)

As for the greenies, I tried Art and Tar with one once, I gave them half
each but I think Tar ate both halves,
a good bit later that night he showed me how upset his digestion was by way
of christening the new quilt cover
with a very runny smelly deposit. I will never feed greenies to any of my
rats again, they get all they need from their
normal food.

It is very quite here. I guess with so few regular posters you really
notice when people disappear or post less. As for me, I've been really
busy these past 6 weeks so have been posting heaps less on all my
newsgroups.

I didn't see your original post either, I'm so sorry for not replying,
you sounded really upset. If aggressive rescue rats can be transformed
into squishy love bugs, your guys will become affectionate again with
more patience and TLC. They must have spent those two weeks terrified.
What crappy friends those people are! I'd go ballistic if someone
treated my animals like that!

Anyhow, I hope your guys perk up soon. Has their resp infection gone
down since starting the antibiotics. Keep a close watch on that. If it
doesn't improve within days of commencing the antibiotics it may be
worth asking for a different type or a different combination or
antibiotics. They're digestion will get better once they get a healthy
diet. Don't feel too bad about feeding them the greenies, with a name
like that who would have thought that it would be so high in protein.
We all stuff up. Heck not long ago I though my pet sheep was going to
die from bloat because I fed her too much grain! It was really stupid
on my part because on the back of the grain packet it had instructions
on how much to feed sheep, and I didn't even bother reading it and
gave her way to much. Fortunately Chloe perked up, but it took a whole
week and a visit from the vet before she returned to normal.

Thank you for your responce.  I was a bit upset when I wrote the first one,
mostly because I was really afraid that my loving little boys were gone
forever.  Since then they have warmed up a bit.  Neither one has bit me or
even tried (lunged at me).  They are definatly more reserved, and shy-er, but
they are slowly coming around.  Im just going about it as if they are
completely new rats, giving them special treats, extra hugs and kisses, extra
time out, but not running around wild, but in closer quarters (on the couch).

I dont think my friends realized what was going on (as stupid as that may
sound).  I just think they  didnt look at the cage and thought it looked
dirty.  I dont think they thought that the cat was messing with the rats.  I
dont think they realized that they were behaving differently until they
actually started biting.

When I took them to the vet, it was not for the upper resp infec at all, but
because they were acting weird (sleeping more, pooping nasty poop).  She said
they had the very beginning of it, and that their lungs sound clear, but she
didnt want them to get bad, so they are on Clavomax and I have to bring them
back in 2 weeks to make sure it didnt get any worse.  The biggest problem I
am having is that they dont want to take it, and they keep spitting it out.
I am at a loss as to what to do to get them to take it.  Any ideas would be
greatly helpful.  I have tried putting it on bread, but that doesnt work
because it makes it soggy.  I tried putting it on a donut, but they dont like
donuts.  I have to give them 1 CC twice a day, which is near impossible to
shoot in their mouth.  They love to eat baby food, so I thought about that,
but I am worried that I wont be able to gage how much they each are eating.
As of right now i am giving them .5 CC 4 times a day, as that's all I can do.
I look forward to any help you guys can give me on this.

Thanks for responding thought.

I'm really pleased they are coming round, you must be very relieved :-)
As for you friends not realizing ...I'm sorry to say but I think they are
either really cruel people,
or the most stupidly thick people. I certainly wouldn't consider them to be
friends.
If I have to give meds my boys don't like I mix it with yoghurt and let them
lick it from my finger.
If you do it one boy at a time you will know for sure how much they are
getting.

Hi,
Greenies really are not a good treat for rats. In fact anything with
high protein is not good for rats. If I were you, I just wouldn't give
it anymore. They don't need it. Give them a healthy treat instead.
I'm glad your little guys are doing better. It sounds like you've got
a good vet and good for you for bringing them in just because you had
a feeling. Not too many people would do that.

I've got very limited access to computers right now. My laptop is in
the shop and might be there for a few days.
Hope they continue to do well. :)
