I have a '98 Ford Explorer XLT (5.0 V8).  I just replaced the steering
rack because it was leaking like a sieve.  The steering also pulsated
some during turns, but I figured one thing at a time....

So, now I have the new rack in, and I started the engine with the
front wheels up to help finish bleeding the system.  When turning the
steering wheel, the wheels started oscillating back and forth
uncontrollably about 5-10 degrees.  I had to stop the engine to get
them to stop.

So, what could the problem be?

- Air in the system?
- Bad steering pump?
- Bum replacement rack?  (I hope not....)

I'm thinking the pump, since it also pulsated before I did any work,
but it doesn't make any noise or anything.  Of course, since all the
fluid leaked out before I did any work, I guess it could just as
easily be air.  Oh, and I did transfer the check valve from the old
rack to the new one.

Any advice on bleeding the system?  I felt like I turned the wheel
back and forth a million times before I finally just started the
engine, but I never got rid of a gurgling sound.  I was hoping that
running the engine would finish the job.

And what's with the transmission fluid?  Why isn't power steering
fluid used??

Thanks,
Eric
