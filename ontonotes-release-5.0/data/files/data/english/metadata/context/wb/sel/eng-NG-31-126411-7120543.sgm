WDM stands for Windows Driver Model and is the set of rules drivers for
WindowsXP are written too, and other OS such as NT, 2000.
You card must have a Video Capture chip which needs it's WDM driver
installing.

Firstly, does your 7600 actually have a video capture (VIVO) capability, and
not just a video out port?

If it does, you can get the most recent WDM driver for XP here:

Unfortunately, that driver will not load in XP Pro x64, my OS.

If it's not compatible with the 64-bit version, it's strange that it doesn't
specifically say it won't work with it.  It only has one category for all
versions of XP/2000/98, which would lead you to believe that it should work.

Perhaps you should e-mail them, and inquire as to why it doesn't work.  Or,
find out if it actually should be working.

Normally if nVidia includes 64 bit support with something, they state that
explicitly.  This didn't so I half expected it to fail.  It does however,
load fine in the XP Pro 32 bit boot.
