Hi,
I own four dogs, and would be really keen to read The puppy wizards
manual.  I am only online occasionally, as I don't have a OC at home,
ans, I am at a loss as to work out how or where I can find / see a
copy.  Is there an ACTUAL manul?
I have tried clicking on some of the links in your / his posts, but
that doesn't seem to be it?
Sorry if the location of the manual is obvious, and this is a silly
question, but I really can't find it!
Many thanks

Praise while a dog is doing UNWANTED behavior is a recipe for
DISTRUST
in the dog.
Dogs know when a person is pleased or not. More so than Humans.
To BETRAY the dog's LOYALTY by LYING to the dog with praise while it
KNOWS YOU HATE WHAT it is DOING is like LYING to children that there
is
a santa clause.
When they FIND OUT they HAVE BEEN LIED TO naturally the TRUST IS
BETRAYED.
The consequences of BETRAYING TRUST BY LYING are CONFUSION in the dog
as it is CONFUSED BY THE DUPLICITY in the ACTIONS of BODY LANGUAGE
versus the WORDS that CONTRADICT the BODY LANGUAGE.
Only a CONFUSED MIND would believe that praising a dog when it is
expressing UNWANTED BEHAVIOR
is DISHONEST and the dog knows it.
Just like people dogs need to know what is acceptable and what is
not.
By praising a dog when BEHAVIORS are UNACCEPTABLE ultimately DESTROYS
the RELATIONSHIP as the dog CAN NOT TRUST the PERSON LYING with
DUPLICITY.
It is the same as endorsing PRETENSE instead of HONESTY.
Dogs know when they are doing things a person does NOT WANT for them
to
do.
Praising the dog while it is MISBEHAVING will make the dog have NO
RESPECT FOR YOU.
Only a DERANGED MIND would endorse LYING to a dog with UNDUE praise.
Just like humans they like praise when it is GENUINE.
Zalman Benyheil AKA jerry howe is PROMOTING CONFUSING dogs that leads
to MISTRUST when there is genuine praise.
The manual is not worth a RAT'S ASS. It is a complete WASTE OF TIME.
Actually it is EVIL since it promotes DUPLICITY between BODY LANGUAGE
and WORDS.

I don't think you get what is actually happening in the Howe system.
What is happening is you are distracting the dog with a sound and at the
same time praising her.  That praise the dog associates with STOPPING
the unwanted behavior, even if momentarily, because you are praising her
AS SHE TURNS her attention toward the sound, AWAY FROM the actual doing
of the behavior.

Our Emma has a really cute way of expressing defeat when the technique
has been used on her for several minutes during a tough lesson.  She
sits down, looks at me, and lets out with a great big yawn.  As if to
say, ok, you win, I'm calling UNCLE!

I think the reason negative training methods take so long to work is
that the dog's span of attention is too short to often remember the
reason for the punishment.

I mean punishment methods.  Whereby the trainer hopes that the dog will

As I thought I pointed out, it is precisely the timing of  the Howe
method that works so well, since you are always timing the praise to
coincide exactly with the dog's CHANGING its behavior, rather than after
the fact, as the punishment methods often do.  Sure, if you can always
be there to punish the dog every time it does a bad thing, exactly as it
is doing it, it will work.  But why bother, when the distract and praise
method works so well? I'd much rather my dog look to me as a kind
teacher rather than a mean correctional officer. I don't know how long
the dog's span of attention is, but I'm guessing it's pretty short. I
think that ANY punishment done after the fact is too late.  (obviously
humans are different in this regard, well some humans are...)

Why do you automatically associate punishment with pain (I assume you
mean physical pain, no?)?

"Punishment" (in the behavioral sense) can also mean taking away a
dog's favorite toy, not allowing him to retrieve that dummy, etc.

What "other form of suffering"?

It WILL, if the TIMING is good.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If the trainer's TIMING is poor, the trainer, indeed, is having a bad
day - and he should ideally find himself another career.

But that applies even to administering positive reinforcement.

If you're too slow on the praise, or with the food, or on the clicker,
you'll likely inadvertently reinforce an *unwanted* behavior.

Or confuse the heck out of the dog, which can be even worse.

All good training methods start with good TIMIMG.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;the fact, as the punishment methods often do.
">

"Punishment" methods, i.e., corrections, rely on the same good timing.
At the instant a dog gets it right, you REWARD him (and sometimes when
he just looks like he's going to get it right). And if you're doing
your job right, and not expecting too much too soon, there will be
oodles upon oodles of positive reinforcement before there's any need
for even one correction.

However, the instant a dog gets it wrong, you CORRECT him. Whether
that entails a verbal correction ("No!" "Eh eh." etc.), a collar pop
with the leash, a tap on the shoulder with an e-collar, being
prevented from retrieving a bird, etc.

But all of it has to be administered with good TIMING.

The hallmark of a good trainer is having good timing.  Without good
timing, there can be no good training.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Sure, if you can always
&gt;be there to punish the dog every time it does a bad thing,
">

You only have to "be there" long enough for the dog to LEARN that he's
doing something right, or that he's doing something wrong.

Some dogs can pick things up in as few as 2-3 repetitions.  Other dogs
require more repetitions. And the number of repetitions also depends
on the skill of the trainer, too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But why bother, when the distract and praise
&gt;method works so well?
">

If it works well for you, that's fine.

One of my own mottos is:  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

But you made some strange comments, so I thought I'd inquire further.

Also, if you took the same amount of time to learn other ways, you'd
almost certainly get the same or better results.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'd much rather my dog look to me as a kind
&gt;teacher rather than a mean correctional officer.
">

Generally, I'd rather that my dogs (and my children, as well) look at
me as extremely fair and consistent.  That always seems to do the
trick when it comes to earning both a dog and a child's respect.

When we're sitting around the fire or in a blind somewhere, then I can
be kindly and affectionate.

Too much affection or kindliness during training only screws with the
dog's brain, focus, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I don't know how long
&gt;the dog's span of attention is, but I'm guessing it's pretty short.
">

However short it is, it isn't too short - if you have good timing.

And if you don't have good timing with Jerry's methods (or any other
method), you'll end up with one very confused dog.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I think that ANY punishment done after the fact is too late.  (obviously
&gt;humans are different in this regard, well some humans are...)
">

Behaviorism applies to all sentient beings, including humans.

For example, as you drive to work tomorrow, you'll pay attention to
those speed limit signs, won't you? And if you see a police cruiser
over on the side of the road, you'll probably slow down, won't you?

Why do you think you'll do that?

HOWE abHOWET sumpthin LIKE THIS, tommy?

You sez:

At no time do the Monks *ever* advocate beating a
dog. A swat on the rump or a check to the chin does
*not* constitute a "beating."

And then you sez:

"I don't know how big you are, kiddo, so this may
not be as easy for you as it is for me, but use
a little "knee action," that is, as the dog goes
charging by you, just give the dog a little bop
with your knee and shin.  Yep, really lean into it.

Even knock her over, if you can, but make sure to
make her think twice about rushing past you again -
- which is exactly what you want her to do.

Don't bother with scolding her, she'll get the message.

If it happens again, just REPEAT the knee action.

When she steps on your toes, just pick up your foot
abruptly and nudge her with your knee.  Again, no
scolding is necessary here, so you don't have to
worry about her "over-reacting."

I don't think this is necessarily a lack of respect
for you, just a lack of training.  That is, she just
needs *more* of it."

Jerry, Jerry! JERRY!  what a slow learner you are.

positive reinforcement, atta boy, reward

negative reinforcement, no response, nada, negative means NO
punishment, aversive action taken immediately after unwanted
behavior - stupid, moronic and confusing, don't use it.

All the reasons you said - except where did you get this insane
notion that brain studies of reward trained and aversion trained
dogs show no difference.  WRONG!

Relief of aversion, MAY be similar to reward, but then you've
got to start with the aversion, nay?  Simply put, you are pulling
the dog with the leash and he moves in your desired direction.

He relieves the choking or just pull of the collar.

Relief of aversion MAY be just as good as reward, if you are VERY
careful about what you are giving to get him to relieve.  And all
your objections to punishment stand...

You have to put him in a cage, to train him by relief of opening the
door.

You have to pull him with a collar, to train him by relief of easing
the pressure.  Notice that you must have the discipline not to snatch
the leash repeatedly, only slow continuous kindly pressure works for
relief of aversion to be pure.

You have to give him a continual shock,
to train him by turning the shock off.

Tricky.

You can bully a dog into some behaviors but the dog knows forever
after that you are a bully.  So he can be a toady, or he can be
your enemy.  I hope he tears out your throat, in a genuinely Christian
way, of course!  heh heh heh

you mean rape doesn't work?  Good metaphor here, Literature is full
of descriptions of love following rape or humiliation.  Never met a
lady or a man who claimed that's how her or his own love began, have
you?  Punishment is a form of rape, if you want the erratic
constipated love of a cowed animal then punish, by all means, you
rapist.

You know we had to send a dog to the city that never did learn not
to attack porcupines. He'd come home with his face full of quills
time after time.  Those are a bitch to get rid of and the pain only
comes when you are pulling the quills out.  Not a good place for a
friend to be.

You know I don't KNOW that it doesn't hurt when the porcupine slaps
them in - I never saw it happen.  But I do know that it hurts like
hell when you screw them out.  If untreated the dog usually dies
- horribly.

My pop finally had to murder our Chang because he'd get screw worms
every summer and after the first time Pop was slow and had to do him
with turpentine he wouldn't even let his beloved Pop come near him
with a bottle in his hand.  Yikes.  So we killed all the screw worm
flies.  YAY!

Here's you beatin a dog to HOWEsbreak it. But FIRST,
a little good KOEHLER trainin, eh tommy???:

"The Koehler Method of Dog Training (1962).  New York:
Howell Book Book House(p. 52-53)."
Hanging

"First, the trainer makes certain that the collar
and leash are more than adequate for any jerk
or strain that the dog's most frantic actions could
cause.  Then he starts to work the dog deliberately
and fairly to the point where the dog makes his grab.

Before the teeth have reached their target,
the dog, weight permitting, is jerked from
the ground.

As in coping with some of the afore-mentioned
problems the dog is suspended in mid-air.

However, to let the biting dog recover
his footing while he still had the strength
to renew the attack would be cruelty.

The only justifiable course is to hold him
suspended until he has neither the strength
nor inclination to renew the fight.

When finally it is obvious that he is
physically incapable of expressing his
resentment and is lowered to the ground,
he will probably stagger loop-legged for a
few steps, vomit once or twice, and roll
over on his side.

The sight of a dog lying, thick-tongued,
on his side, is not pleasant, but do not
let it alarm you

THE REAL "HOOD"

"If your dog is a real "hood" who would
regard the foregoing types of protest as
"kid stuff" and would express his
resentment of your efforts by biting,
your problem is difficult -- and pressing.

"Professional trainers often get these
extreme problems. Nearly always the
"protest biter" is the handiwork of a
person who, by avoiding situations that
the dog might resent, has nurtured the
seeds of rebellion and then  cultivated
the resultant growth with under correction.

When these people reap their inevitable
and oftentimes painful harvest, they are
ready to avail themselves of "the cruel
trainer" whose advice they may have
once rejected because it was incompatible
with the sugary droolings of mealy-
mouthed columnists, breed-ring biddies,
and dog psychologists who, by the
broken skins and broken hearts their
misinformation causes, can be proven guilty
of the greatest act of cruelty to animals
since the dawn of time.

"With more genuine compassion for the
biting dog than would ever be demonstrated
by those who are "too kind" to make a
correction and certainly with more disregard
for his safety, the professional trainer
morally feels obligated to perform a "major
operation."

"Since we are presently concerned with
the dog that bites in resentment of the
demands of training, we will set our
example in that situation.  (In a later
chapter we will deal with the with the
much easier problem of the dog that
bites someone other than his master."

Are we havin FUN yet?

Koehler On Correcting The Housebreaking Backslider.

"If the punishment is not severe enough, some of these
"backsliders" will think they're winning and will
continue to mess in the house. An indelible impression
can sometimes be made by giving the dog a hard
spanking of long duration, then leaving him tied by
the mess he's made so you can come back at twenty
minute intervals and punish him again for the same
thing. (Dogs are REALLY stupid. J.H.)

In most cases, the dog that deliberately does this
disagreeable thing cannot be made reliable by the
light spanking that some owners seem to think is
adequate punishment. It will be better for

Well, I'm a dog trainer. Been training dogs for close to half a

And why is it that you think you can precisely coordinate the praising
of a dog and the shaking of a can, but you can't say "Eh!" or pop a

When you take your dog for a walk, what do you do when she pulls on

&gt;Not because of the timing of any corrections I may or may not have had.
">

Absolutely.  Just the threat of something "bad" happening to you is
more than enough to get you to slow down, isn't it.

And that's because you've been conditioned to expect a speeding
ticket, an accident, the loss of your driver's license, higher
insurance rates, etc. - because you see it happen all around you, even
if you've never experienced it yourself.  And the more that you
experience any of that unpleasantness yourself, the slower the driver
you will become. Or you end up in jail.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Because I can figure out the possible results if I don't.
">

You don't think dogs can do that, too? After they've been taught that:

1. certain "bad" things happen to them if they behave a certain way

and that...

2. certain "good" things happen to them if they behave in a certain
way.

Really?

You don't give dogs much credit, do you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And I can
&gt;reason the risk/reward ratio.
">

Again, dogs may not be able to "reason" in the manner of a human, but
they can easily associate actions, movements, words, etc. with what
follows (or doesn't follow) from them.

It is, in fact, precisely what makes "learning" possible in the first
place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I usually note what he's doing and if
&gt;busy writing a ticket or something, I maintain my course and speed.
">

That's only because you haven't paid a stiff enough price for your
transgression.

Here's an example of what I mean.

What if your car was equipped with a device that, upon exceeding a
certain speed limit, a big hand reached out from the dashboard and
punched you in the mouth.

How much speeding do you think you'd be doing then?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Dogs can't do that.
">

Sure they can!

You've never noticed how "hard of hearing" a dog can become when he's,
say, a hundred yards away from you, compared to when he's sitting
right there at your feet?

They're able to recognize that "good" things" happen to them when they
behave in a certain way, and that "bad" things can happen when they
don't. And sometimes (until they're fully trained) they think that
distance from their handler equates to getting to do whatever they
want.

How do you think they come to that conclusion?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As smart as Emma is, she'll never be able to make that
&gt;kind of decision.
">

I'd like to take you out to the field and watch good hunting dogs
work.  Among other things, they learn, over time, that certain cover
produces a lot of birds, and that other kinds of cover don't. I don't
teach that to them. They aren't born with that knowledge. They *learn*
it themselves, by repetition and association.

X cover = birds (a "good" thing)

y cover = no birds (a "bad" thing)

And it makes for a much more efficient and fast hunt when they know
not only which cover to search, but which cover to ignore.

What to do, and what not to do.

Now that may not qualify as "reasoning" in the strict sense of the
theory, but it gets the job done.

I plan on crating Tuck whenever NOT supervised (which isn't often..
he usually is with me) Until the day that he quits tearing apart
everything in sight when I leave the room.

A dog proof room doesn't work.

He's figured out door knobs. He's figured  out cupboards,
and he loves to tug open dresser drawers.  He's not
interested  in anything  left out in the open.

He's into treasure hunting, figuring  anything worth
secreting away is worth his effort discovering. He's
discovered the sock stash is in drawers.

Trash cans? --not interested.
Counter tops? --not interested
Counter tops -with food? --not interested
Dog food sitting on the floorin open bags? --not interested

razor blades from bathroom drawers?  ...  Very cool stuff!

Mom really gets bent too!

nope.. His crate is going to be occupied for some time to come.

As for the beagle.. She's never been trustworthy.

She's getting senile and never will be trustworthy, so a
crate is in her future until she crosses the bridge.

Reka, no crate at no time,  She lost her crate when she was
5 months old.  Both Tuck, and reka hangout in  crates by choice.

Reka dens in the bathtub usually. (kind of a crate) But she
likes the beagles vantage point, because the beagles crate
is on top of Tuck's. Right next to the window so she can see
out.  Tuck prefers the compartment with a view as well.

I always have to vacate him (even though the crate on top is
too small for both elkhounds, it's their preferred lookout)
when I wantto stick in the beagle.

Reka sleeps under the bed at night or in the bathtub at night
if it's really hot. She sleeps in the  bathtub by day when not
watching from the penthouse suite.

Tuck is not crated at night, and has chosen to sleep in
the closet. The beagle holds down the couch, night and day.

Actually, I borrowed the vets office kitten once for a
couple days for school education on pet care and safe
handling as well as responsible pet ownership.

I kept the kitten over night in a crate within a crate
and yet my dog (yes,  Angelic Danny, as well as Taya
and Toby tore that kittne to threads from between the
crate bars. (apparently he stuck his paws through the
crate to bat at the dogs. I was out doing yard work
and rushed in to find the little kittens pieces and
parts being torn through by ALL the dogs.

I called my girl friend to come get my dogs. I screamed
displeasure, and stalked out with the kitten. Danny, et
al spent 3 days in a kennel until I finally felt like I
could interact with them without doing bodily harm. All
three dogs were never touched, but knew they had done
something so unspeakable that I wouldn't associate with
them and they got banished.

To this day, Taya (mom and Dad's dog) and Danny will not
look at a cat. When confronted with one, Danny wees
himself and cowers hiding behind me for help.

I'm not saying this would work this way with all dogs,
But mom and dad now have a house cat, and she has never
been harmed by  any of the dogs. Danny is there all the
time, unsupervised, and has no interest in harming the cat.

His prognosis is really poor, even though his vital signs are still
good.

he can walk to go out to potty, but he's so painful he didn't want
to.
he's miserable but drugged to the gills. He met me with a meekly
wagging
tail. his face is swollen and his legs are swollen, because he does
not
have the body protein to assimilate the fluids.
When they did the surgery, his intestines were all stuck together in
one
big adhesion.  His intestines were even stuck to his bladder, and
they
pulled them all apart, but they wanted to glue themselves back almost
immediately. if they do that, he will die. And this is what they were
trying to do during the surgery.

I asked him if this is the case, why didn't we just put him down? I
don't want him hurting like this, if he's not  going to survive it
anyway.   He said "no,  beca...." and I didn't hear the rest, the
room
got all green and hazy and I had to sit down on the floor before I
passed
out. So I really don't know why we are fighting to save him if his
prognosis is so poor.  I told the vet to stop talking.

He has peritonitis , no penetrations were evident from the chicken
bones,
but we are assuming it was related to the chicken wings. But he is
also
showing bone anomalies similar to those dogs with a viral infection.
Viral infections can also cause abdominal adhesions. so there were
biopsies sent off for culture and testing. He's also a low
birthweight
puppy, and my vet  has suspected there was a viral infection going on
since birth, even before he was born, because of lack of bone
development
on the xrays. when he looked at the prenatal xrays, he felt this
litter
was in trouble. when they were low birthweight, he has been working
on
that hunch, and he's been treating this pup from the beginning as a
suspect viral issue with an immune mediated response.

his breeder calls my vet an idiot.

The massive adhesions he found also increased his suspicions that
this
was not just the chicken bones but an ongoing problem.

he wanted to do the biopsy and i told him NO.  (he tends to test and
test
as if my dogs were lab rats) I need this dog fixed, and regardless of
the
cause, the treatment is the same. he says he needs to know and is
paying
for the test himself. he says this information may be critical to his
sister (who is not exhibiting any problems btw)

so he can suspect whatever he wants, but i think he's looking for
zebras,
when he's actually looking at a horse. The lab work he is doing will
confirm his hunch. it's his dime. If he's right, Della (his sister)
will
also need to know. if he's wrong, it hasn't hurt anything, and it
didn't
cost me a dime.

If he had a small pinhole leak from the bones, it could also have set
up
the massive peritonitis. Frankly, he ate the chicken wing, and was
sick
the next day. Sometimes a horse is just a horse.

He started telling me how they handled the adhesion binding and why

EXAMPLE: I refuse to allow, say, one of my retrievers to run out there
and retrieve a bird, unless he keeps his little butt planted firmly on
the ground and until I give the command to fetch, and if he raises it
just one little inch off the ground before I release him, I not only
don't give him the command (that he so desperately wants to hear), I
even heel him back from the line and towards the truck. After a minute
or so ("to let him clear out the cobwebs"), I walk him back up to the
line and give him another shot at it.  Most retrievers learn in as few
as 5-6 repetitions that they *only* get to retrieve birds if they keep
their little butts firmly planted on the ground (among other things).

It's called negative punishment
&lt; http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Faculty/wasserman/Glossary/punishment... &gt;,
and it works wonderfully, because the urge to retrieve that bird is so
strong that he'll do just about anything to get out there and do it -
even keep his little butt planted on the ground until I release him.

If he doesn't, he doesn't get to retrieve.  If he does, he gets to.

I.e., the ol' "carrot and stick" approach.

He gets the positive reinforcement by just letting him retrieve, which
is what he enjoys doing more than anything else in the world.

QUESTION: Why are my dogs able to grasp this concept so quickly, but
an optometrist can't?

Don't optometrists have to go to school anymore?

Where exactly is that law written down?

Considering the fact that you just disproved it?

It sounds more to me like something a know-it-all optometrist would
come up with, to hide the fact that he doesn't know anything
whatsoever about operant conditioning, classical conditioning, dog
training, etc., and is a poor judge of people as well.

In your own little world, *you* get to be the expert, and now it
appears that you've somehow taken that as an authorization to be
considered an expert on things about which you obviously lack even the
first freakin' clue.

That's the very definition of a doofus - someone who refuses to be
educated.

You've been had by Jerry Howe, just like you'd probably get had by a
slick used-car salesman, and you *still* haven't figured that out.

maybe this little exercise will be worth it.

I'm not threatened by anyone, and certainly not by an ignoramus who
can't even understand the modern doctrine's of learning theory. It's
pretty simple stuff, actually, unless, of course, one thinks he's
smarter than, say, Skinner, Pavlov, etc., and the thousands upon
thousands of dog trainers and behaviorists who've been training and
dogs to do some absolutely remarkable things with it.

What does frighten me though, now that you brought it up, is the
increasing number of doofuses currently running loose in the world,
including those who consider themselves experts even in disciplines
they obviously know nothing about.

You've given me a whole new view of optometry and optometrists, in
fact! I've got a friend who has a son who isn't very bright, and he's
worried that he'll never be able to make a good living.

Well, I'm going to tell him to have his son think seriously about

Yeah. Then you wouldn't be able to REWARD him

"Despite Skinner's clear denunciation of "negative
reinforcement" (1958) NEARLY EVERY LEARNING
THEORY model involves the USE OF PUNISHMENT.
Of curse, Skinner has never to my knowledge,
demonstrated HOWE we escape the phenomenon
that an expected reward not received is experienced
as a punishment and can produce extensive and
persistent aggression (Azrin et al, 1966)."

It is NO WONDER hat the marked changes in
deviant behavior of children can be achieved
through brief, simple educative routines with
their mothers which modify the mother's
social behaviors shaping the child (Whaler,
1966).

Some clinics have reported ELIMINATION of the
need for child THERAPY through changing the
clinical emphasis from clinical to parental
HANDLING of the child (Szrynski 1965).

A large number of cases improved sufficiently after
preliminary contact with parents that NO treatment
of children was required, and almost ALL cases
SHOWE a remarkably shortened period for therapy.
Quite severe cases of anorexia nervosa have been
treated in own to five months by simply REPLACING
the parents temporarily with EFFUSIVELY LOVING
SUBSTITUTES (Groen, 1966).

The IMBECILITY of some ofthe claims for operant
technique simply take the breath away. Lovas et al
(1966) report a standard contingent reward/punishment
procedure developing imitative speech in two severly
disturbed non verbal schizophrenic boys. After twenty-
six days the boys are reported to have been learning
new words with alacrity. HOWEver, when REWARDS

This naive child would like to say thank you to both
Jerry and Marilyn for putting up with a constant barrage
of really infantile crap at the hands of supposedly
adult dog lovers.

The other naive child (LSW) has to put up with the
nagging idea that if people like them had been posting
earlier, maybe we would not have had to hold the head
of a really magnificent animal in our arms while he was
given the needle and having to hug him and wait until he
gasped his last gasp.

To my mind, "naive" is believing you can terrorize a dog.

Naive is believing that people that hide behind fake
names are more honest than people that use their real
names.  Naive is thinking that dilettante  dog breeders
and amateur "trainers" like Joey  (lyingdogDUMMY, j.h.)
are the equal or better than those that have studied and
lived by their craft for decades.

"Stupid" is believing that people do not see kindergarten
level insults for what they are. Really stupid is believing
that people like Jerry Howe and Marilyn Rammell are
going to just go away because you people act like fools.

Why do you act like fools?  I really have no idea, and I

AIN'T IT, tommy:

"Learning Theory"- An Insult to Canines

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&quot;TooCool&quot; &lt;larrym ... @hotmail.com wrote in message
">

Classical and operant conditioning is founded in
what is termed "learning theory".

The four rudimentary rules of "learning theory" are:
Something Good can start or be presented, so
behavior increases = Positive Reinforcement (R)

Something Good can end or be taken away, so behavior
decreases = Negative Punishment (P-)

Something Bad can start or be presented, so behavior
decreases = Positive Punishment (P)

Something Bad can end or be taken away, so behavior
increases = Negative Reinforcement (R-)

Proponents of "learning theory" believe that no
learning can take place without reinforcement or
punishment either positive or negative. That is why
they employ treats and force.

"Learning theory" is a flawed concept for evolutionarily
advanced species. Advanced species learn without any
external motivation. They are not automatons that merely
respond to stimuli. Their evolutionary survival has endowed
them with self motivated learning behavior.

Canines, in particular, are curious, they love to learn and
they exhibit pride in what they have learned. They think-they
figure things out. They can invent games to play. They can
invent behaviors to drive you crazy. They have emotions-they
can be humorous and they can be vindictive-their feelings can
be hurt. They can suffer terribly if you don't treat them with
respect.

They actively seek their environment for new things to
learn. They also learn from watching other animals and
humans and they mimic their behavior (in the scientific
literature this is termed allelomimetic behavior). It is an
insult to the intelligence of dogs and to their owners to
employ operant conditioning (clicker training).

Dogs are not B. F. Skinner robots whose only capacity
to learn stems from the four rules of "learning
theory". Canines deserve treatment and training that
is tailored to their nature. You can literally ruin
your dog if your treatment and training does not
respect their nature.

Please study the Puppy Wizard's Wits' End Training
Method. It is the only available method, of which I
am aware, that is based upon the true nature of
canines. In his system, praise is not used as a
reinforcement or motivator, i. e., dogs are not asked
to work for praise.

FACT: It's not their training, their genes, etc. It's their repeated
exposures to different hunting situations, different cover, etc.,
doofus. It's no different than how lions, wolves, etc. learn how to
become successful hunters - certain scenarios reward them with success
(R+), other scenarios don't. So they REPEAT the successful scenarios.

You could take an experienced hunting dog, one that was only
experienced with hunting situations and cover, say, in the Midwest,
and drop him out on a mesa in west Texas somewhere, and he'd have to
learn all over again the best covers in which to find certain birds.
Which is why it's almost always better to rely on *local* dogs for
that.  I.e., they *already* know where the local birds are likely to
be found

How many hunts have you ever been on? How many hunting dogs have you
ever owned and hunted with?

Once again Shelly thanks so much for the not very positive
response from You!..  Guess it was too hard to notice I was
not speaking to you , about you  or anything to do with you .
I was referring to a comment made by "drusefton".

It would be shear stupidity on my part to comment to you ..
besides if I made your "killfile" why on earth are you still
reading what I may have posted?

perhaps the header should read "This is not for Shelly"

Sadly Shelly  if you were to have someone in real life train
a dog with no negatives or no punishment right in front of your
eyes, you would find something not to appreciate.

Must be that doubting Thomas complex or perhaps just blurred
vision. All I have commented on was how MY dog has responded,
how well Jerry's techniques have worked for me, and how helpful
he was to me.

(Perhaps you would be a happier person if I had lied?)

I'm sure it is not something you might try, as it requires change
in attitude, a new approach to what you learned and your dogs might
just keel right over if you were that pleasant. Of course your dogs
are allowed to kill baby possums and you find that amusing.

If you are so threatened by another human being that has a different
point of view than yours ... it must be really something to see you
change a dog's thought pattern...

What do you do Shelly,  yell No, scream, yank their
chain or lead, or does a stick work better?

Perhaps if just once, one dog had the courage or enough fear to
bite you in the ass  you might appreciate another's point of view
without sounding totally ignorant.or making uncalled for remarks.

How interesting you have no problem slamming Jerry or me, what a
shame you have such difficulty looking in the mirror to solve your
own issues.

If we were both so fortunate as to make your killfile then why
must you respond ? I would think it might save you the embarrassment
if you just chose to be quiet, but perhaps you just don't give a
damn as to the impression you make on others!

hmmm pretty sad, too bad.

And to think this is your quote, your own words:

"What makes people unique among animals is culture. Culture
is made possible by the sharing of ideas, feelings, and events
through symbolic language.

This sharing of experiences allows humans to pass on information
from one geographical area to another and from one generation to
the next. These shared ideas can become behavior patterns that,
when repeated across a population and through time, become culture.

Unlike humans, when an animal dies, its experiences
generally die with it."

Yes that must be it   Culture ! so it's your culture that
limits Jerry's ideas, feelings and experiences to be passed
on ..as information.  And someday should you meet your dogs
after you and they die, won't it be a tremendous  shock that
indeed they may remember you.

Try to have a Great day Shelly ...you clearly could use one.

Subject: MacKenzie's First Pinch Collar Class

First of all, I was referencing a totally DIFFERENT
discussion/debate that we had participated in. One
that *I* thought contained little to no ill will at
all.

The one you seem to be re-experiencing here had nothing
to do with the debate on collar corrections, which is
what I referenced in this thread to Leah.

And I ONLY brought up that debate (and I meant it in a
light hearted manner) to point out to Leah just how
*wrong* she was about my stance on prong corrections.

That was NOT at all the same argument you are referring to.

We had a separate debate (one that never got weird at all,
IMO) that was simply about whether or not corrections could
or should be used on the prong.

Can't find the original post (ok....too lazy to look), but in my

Having dealt with only a couple of stool eaters of this magnitude,
e-collars and incredible amounts of consistency have been the only
thing I personally have seen work.

I'll check with Phyllis to see if she's copme up with more creative
solutions though, as she's usually the one that ends up dealing with
the poop eaters.

I'd go ahead and try the broccoli and such anyway, though if

First, I punish behavior, not dogs.

Second, I rarely issue corrections.

Third, as time goes on my dog uses the pillow less frequently.

I would say he uses it about once a month. Finally, I'm not

Eating dog poop, for me, is another story. And the rate

What is wrong with "The Puppy Wizard"?

poop, begging from the table and excessive barking
using his methods.
