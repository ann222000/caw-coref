INTRODUCTION

QUESTION 1*: What do the Qur'an and Sunnah say concerning the visiting of
graves, the spiritual life and awareness of the dead, and the presence of
barakah (grace) and nur (light) at the graves of the pious ones among
Allah's servants?

*QUESTION 2*: Is it true that Sayyidana Umar, radi Allahu 'anh, chopped down
the tree where he saw people praying to attain the Barakah of the Prophet
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam? It was believed that special bay'ah
was taken at this tree. Some people actually claim that this proves that the
Sahabah did not believe in the Barakah of Sayyiduna wa Mawlana Rasul-Ullah,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam.

*QUESTION 3:* What were the views of Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu 'anh,
regarding Tabarruk (seeking for blessing by the traces of pious people)?

*QUESTION 4:* Is it allowed to kiss a grave out of respect for the one who
is buried there?

*QUESTION 5:* Is it allowed to put flowers on a grave?

*QUESTION 6:* Is it allowed to build domes or structures over graves?

*QUESTION 7:* Some people teach that those who visit the shrines of the
Awliya' for tabarruk are on the same level of the Arab idolaters who lived
in the time of the Prophet Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam. Is their
claim correct?

A comment about the circumstances in which those questions were answered.

Recently there has been much controversy regarding the well-established
practice of Muslims of visiting the shrines of the Awliya' and paying homage
to them. A Wahhabi imam from Cape Town, South Africa, Faaik Gamieldien, has
referred to the Muslims who show respect to the blessed shrines as
unbelievers and idol-worshippers. He also claimed that there is no Qur'anic
or Sunnah injunction to justify the visiting of these graves.
He holds that the dead have no awareness or spiritual life and there is no
barakah at the shrines of these saints. He goes on to claim that it is
forbidden to build structures around or above the graves of the saints and
to honour them. He claims that expressing respect and veneration for the
Prophets, `alayhimu-s-salatu wa-s-salam, leads to polytheism.

These outrageous claims caused an uproar and unnecessary conflicts and
divisions. The students of Shaykh al-Sayyid Muhammad ibn 'Alawi Al-Maliki,
the famous Sunni 'alim of Mecca al-Mukarramah discussed these same issues
into details, especially in his major work &quot;Mafahim Yajib an Tusah-hah&quot;.

His students who live in Cape Town answered the questions by abiding by
Qur'an and sunnah, and by quoting and translating from the writings of the
famous Maliki scholar.

*QUESTION 1:
*
*What do the Qur'an and Sunnah say concerning the visiting of graves, the
spiritual life and awareness of the dead, and the presence of barakah
(grace) and nur (light) at the graves of the pious ones among Allah's
servants?
**
ANSWER:
*
Firstly, Allah Ta'ala says in the Glorious Qur'an (9:84) about the graves of
the hypocrite what means: &quot;do not stand at his grave&quot; (Wa la taqum 'ala
qabrih). From this the 'Ulama of the four maddhab unanimously deduce that
standing by the graves of a believer is on the contrary permissible.

Secondly, it is narrated in *Sahih Muslim, Sunan of at-Tirmidhi, Sunan of
Abu Dawud, Sunan of Nasa'i and Musnad of Imam Ahmad (Book of Funerals)* that
Rasul-Ullah, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said what means:

*&quot;I had previously forbidden you to visit graves, but I now permit you to
visit them, for it will remind you of the Hereafter.&quot;

*The Prophet Muhammad himself ,sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, used to visit
the graves of his companions who had passed away at that time. It is
narrated in Sahih Muslim and Sunan of at-Tirmidhi that the Rasul-Ullah,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, used to regularly visit the graveyard of
Medina, Jannat al-Baqi', and make supplications there.

It is also narrated in Sahih Muslim that Rasul-Ullah, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, taught his wife, our mother Sayyidah Aishah, radi Allahu 'anha', the
etiquette of visiting graves and the way of greeting the dead.

Imam Al-Bayhaqi, narrates that Rasul-Ullah, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
used to visit the graveyard of the martyrs of Uhud annually.

So, besides merely visiting the graves, in some cases the Prophet Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, would also make a habit of visiting them at
specific times every year. Thus the practice of annual commemoration for
visiting certain graves, as is the custom of many Muslims all over the world
today, is actually derived from the Sunnah.

Al-Bazzar narrates that the Prophet Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
visited the Jannat al-Ma'la graveyard in Mecca, where his dear wife, our
Sayyidah Khadijah, radi Allahu 'anha', is buried and said about the place
what means &quot;This is a blessed graveyard&quot; (Ni'mah al-maqbarah hadhih).

Imam Muslim narrates that the Prophet Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, also visited his honourable mother's grave, which is in a place
between Mecca and Medina. He weeped there and those who were present also
wept.

One should also wonder - according to different ahadith - Jannat al-Baqi' in
Medina is regarded as the holiest graveyard on earth. This precisely happens
because of the holy people who are buried there. This clearly shows that not
all graves and graveyards are the same in status according to the Shari'ah.
Those graveyards in which holy people are buried are definitely higher in
status and barakah, and that is also the reason why the Muslims visit Jannat
ul-Baqi' in Medina and Jannat ul-M'ala in Mecca more than other graveyards.

Al-Bayhaqi narrates in Shu'ab al-Iman that Rasul-Ullah, sall-Allahu `alayhi
wa sallam, said what means: &quot;Whoever visits the grave of his parents or the
grave of one of them every Friday, he will be forgiven and his name will be
written among the pious ones&quot; (Man zara Qabra abawayhi aw ahadihima fi kulli
Jumu'ah, ghufira lahu wa kutiba barran).

If visiting the graves of one's parents causes such a blessing, what about
visiting the graves of the Prophets or of the intimate Saints of Allah?
Rasul-Ullah, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, encouraged the Muslims to visit
graves regularly and considered a cause for forgiveness, although the
ignoramuses dislike it. The above mentioned hadith also proves the validity
and desirability of visiting graves on a regular basis, which is the common
practice of the Muslims..

It is narrated in Sharh as-Sudur by Imam al-Suyuti that the Prophet
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said what means that when one
visits the graveyard, he should read Surat al-Ikhlas, Surat at-Takathur and
Surat al-Fatiha, and present the reward of the recitations as a gift to the
inhabitants of the graves. He, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, aslo explained
that these souls will then ask forgiveness make for him, asking Allah Ta'ala
to forgive and bless him.

So this then is a command of the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam. We learn from this Hadith that the souls of the departed have the
ability to make Du'a for the living, asking Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, to
help the living who are visiting them.

In another Hadith found in the Kanzul Ummal by al-Imam al-Muttaqi, it is
narrated by Sayyidina 'Ali, radi Allahu `anh, that the Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said: &quot;Whoever goes to a graveyard or passes
by a graveyard and recites Surah Ikhlas eleven times and gives the Sawab of
the recital to the dead buried there, will receive the same Sawab for it as
the dead people&quot;.

In fact the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, is encouraging us
to recite Surah Ikhlas and present the Sawab of it as a gift to the dead
when we visit them. Today, some people are saying that making Dhikr at the
graves is Bid'ah!!!!! They must go and study Hadith.

*Awareness of the dead and their spiritual life in the graves:
*
Firstly, the Qubur of the Prophets, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam. A Sahih
Hadith narrated by Imam Muslim ( vol.2 p.268) states that the Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said that on the night of Mi'raj, &quot;He,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, passed by the grave of Sayyidina Musa and saw
him praying in his grave (iza bi Musa yusalli fi Qabrihi)&quot;.

This is evidence from the Sunnah of the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi
wa sallam, that there are certain holy people of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala,
who can even pray in the Qabr. The Ulama say that they are not praying
because it is fard upon them (since they have already passed away) but that
they are praying for the sake of the love of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, and
because they enjoy praying and thus talking to Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala.
This is why they pray in their graves.

About the Ambiya Allah (Prophets), there are no doubts since Abu Ya'la and
al-Bazzar (in their Musnads) narrate a Sahih Hadith that the Prophet,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said that:

&quot; All of the Ambiyaa are Alive and Praying in their graves. (al-Anbiya
Ahyaa'un fi Quburihim yusalloon). The Arabic word for prayer used in this
Hadith is (Salah), which may also mean Du'a, besides the ritual Salah we
know.

In another Sahih Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ahmad,
Tabarani and others, the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said
that one must make a lot of Salawat/Darud on the day of Jum'ah as this will
be presented to the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam. Then the
Sahabah asked the Prophet, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, how their Salawat
was going to be presented to him after he had died and his body is no more,
and the Prophet, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, replied that:

&quot; Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, has made it haram (forbidden) for the earth to
consume the bodies of the Prophets&quot;.

By the way, things are only presented to someone if he is alive, fully aware
and conscious of everything. This Hadith also shows that the Prophet,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, is aware of our Salawat and our spiritual
states, otherwise what is the meaning of this presentation?

So they are alive in the graves, they are praying, they are aware regarding
who is making Salawat on them ¬in short--- they know us.

We also know that on the night of Mi'raj, all the Prophets, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, assembled in Masjid al-Aqsa, physically (or spiritually
as some think), but all of these Prophets save I'sa, `alayhi-s-salam, had
already died, so to say. Yet that night they met the Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, spoke to him and prayed behind him.

And when he went into the samawat (the skies) He, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, met them again. This shows, and we know it from many Sahih Hadith
concerning the Mi'raj, that these Nabi's were alive and they went to the
Aqsa, went to the skies and met the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam.

Yet many people today want to deny the life of the Prophet, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, who is in fact the Imam of all those Prophets,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, saying that the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, is dead and cannot go from place to place, that he is no
more and has no awareness in him, A'uzo billah. May Allah, subhanaHu wa
Ta`ala, protect us from such blasphemy.

We all know about the incident of Mi'raj, and the reason why Masjid al-Aqsa
is so dear to us and so holy is because the Prophet, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, prayed there with all the Nabis. If we say that they never prayed
then why is it so dear to us? What then is the importance of the Aqsa Mosque
in Jerusalem?

We also know that Sayyidina Musa benefitted us on that night because Allah,
subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, had made fifty Salahs fard on us. But, through the
intermediary action of Musa, `alayhi-s-salam, this number was reduced to
five times daily. What a great help is this to the Ummah of Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam. There are so many people having problems
performing only the five daily Salahs, how much more difficult would not 50
have been? Allah's Rahmah for us is indeed great. But it came to us through
the mediation of a Prophet!

But what is astonishing about this incident is that Musa, `alayhi-s-salam,
had passed away 4 000 years before that night of Mi'raj, yet there he was,
acting as an intermediary for the Ummah of the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam.

If this is the ability of Musa, `alayhi-s-salam, what about the best of
creation, the Imam of all Prophets, our own Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam? Cannot the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
benefit us today if Sayyidina Musa could benefit us then?

*Concerning the Qubur(Grave) of ordinary Muslims:
*
Firstly, the Holy Quran (3:169-170) is clear that those who die in the Way
of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, are Alive. Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, (
s.w.t) says:

&quot;Think not of those who are slain in Allah's Way As dead. Nay, they are
Alive! Finding sustenance from their Lord---They rejoice in the Bounty
Provided by Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala,&quot;.

We do not think that there is any Ayah in the Quran which destroys the
atheistic concept of Death as the end of all Awareness, as this Ayah.
The Verse is clear that the Shahid's, who, by the way, are lesser in status
than the Prophets (Nabiy'yeen) and the Saints (Siddiqeen), are fully Alive
in their graves and are even getting sustenance and even rejoicing.

Even a child knows that only those who have full awareness and life need
sustenance and have the capability of rejoicing. Thus, Those who call the
friend of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, as dead are contradicting the very
Book of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala.

Our incapability of perceiving their life, in the physical sense, does not
in any way negate the fact that they are alive in the Spiritual World.
The Quran (2:154) is clear that:

&quot;And say not of those Who are slain in the Way of Allah: 'They are Dead'.
Nay, They are Living, though you do not perceive it&quot;.

It is narrated by Abu Nuaym and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal that the great Tabi'i
(a person who met the Sahabah) Thabit al-Bannani, used to say &quot;O Allah! If
you would give anyone the honour of making Salah in the Qabr (grave), give
me that honour.

Abu Nuaym narrates that on the day of Thabit's death, Jubair, radi Allahu
`anh, one of the great Tabi'in also, said: &quot;I swear by Allah who created me,
other than whom there is no Lord, I put Thabit al-Bannani in his his Qabr
that day when we buried him and with me was a person named Humaid at-Taweel
and when we had finished putting the stones on the Qabr one of the bricks
fell down and I saw Thabit al-Bannani making Salah in his Qabr.&quot;

In other words, Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, accepted the Du'a of this great
Wali to make Salah in his grave. This is a Sahih Hadith narrated by Ahmad
ibn Hanbal and Abu Nuaym.

In another Sahih narration by Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, the Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said that if anyone buries his brother, that
he must put on a beautiful kafan for the dead person because they visit one
another in the grave (innahum yatazaawarun).

This is only speaking about ordinary Muslims and not Awliya Allah. If
ordinary Muslim dead can visit one another in their Qubur, then how much
greater is not the status and ability of the Awliya Allah in their Qubur?
What awareness do not these friends of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, have in
their Qubur?

It is narrated by Tirmidhi and an-Nasa'i as well as al-Hakim that one of the
Sahabah put his tent over a Qabr without knowing it and when he was inside
the tent, he heard someone reciting Surah al-Mulk. He went to Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, and told him what he heard.
Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, informed him that Surah
al-Mulk is a protection against punishment in the Qabr, and is protecting
the man buried there.

The 'Ulama of Hadith explain that that man loved reciting Surah al-Mulk when
he was alive and thus Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, granted him that he could
recite it in his Qabr as well.

This proves that an ordinary man is able to recite Qur'an in his Qabr and a
normal living man is able to hear him. Thus if a truthful person claims that
he has been spoken to by a Wali, at the Wali's Qabr, it is most likely true,
and most importantly, possible. This fact is grounded in the abovementioned
Hadith.

Even Ibn Taymiyyah, who is called &quot;Shaykhu-l-Islam&quot; by his Wahhabi
followers, narrates another hadith sahih regarding this. We note that most
of his followers today claim that the dead have no perception or power after
their demise, i.e. abide by an atheistic and materialistic view of death.

However, to refute them is enough to say their their beloved shaykh, Ibn
Taymiyah narrates in his Fatawa (vol.24 p.331) that Rasul-Ullah, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, said what means, &quot;When one passes by the grave of his
believing brother who he had known in this world, then stands by his grave
and says, 'Assalamu 'alaykum', the person in the grave will know him and
also return his greeting&quot; (ya'rifuhu wa yarudda 'alayihi-s-salam)&quot;.

This shows that the dead have awareness and are able to make du'ah for the
living, since saying &quot;as-salamu 'alaykum&quot; is a supplication in favor of the
person one greets.

Furthermore, against what his Wahhabi followers claim today, Ibn Taymiyah
was asked in his Majmu'at al-Fatawa ( vol.24 p.362) &quot;Whether the dead could
perceive the living acquaintances that visit them.&quot; He replied: &quot;There is no
doubt that they can.&quot;

And he stated that evidence to this effect comes from the two Sahih books of
Bukhari and Muslim (Kitab al-Jana'iz) where Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, said that when the people have buried a dead person and
leave for home, the dead person can hear the steps of those who leave
(yasma'u qar'a ni'alihim). (This even refers to the kuffar).

What makes people who have studied Hadith claim that Prophets, Awliya and
ordinary dead have no awareness after their demise? Maybe they have not
studied properly.

The Great Hadith and Tafsir scholar Jallaluddin al-Suyuti was asked the
following questions:

Do the dead recognize their visitors and know their states in life?

Do the dead hear what the living say?

Do the souls of the dead meet and see each other?

He replied to all questions: &quot;Yes&quot;, and produced a lot of ahadith in
support.

About the ayah that some people quote about the dead not hearing, the
learned al-Suyuti says that it is the meaning is allegorical (an-Nafi Ja'a
ala m'ana al-Majaz), and the actual meaning of it is that &quot;They cannot
listen to guidance&quot; (Ma'naha Sama' Huda) i.e. they are dead and they cannot
be guided after rejecting guidance while they were alive.&quot;

Any scholar can check al-Hawi lil Fatawa (vol.2 p.169-175) by Imam
Jalaluddin al-Suyuti.

*Do we want to follow the great giants of Islamic knowledge or modern day
dwarfs?
*
In Surah al-A'araf, we are told by Allah that after the evil people of
Thamud were destroyed, Nabi Salih, `alayhi-s-salam, addressed them and said
&quot;O my people! I did indeed convey to you the Message for which I was sent by
my Lord: I gave you good counsel, But ye love not good counsellors!&quot;(7:79).
Nabi Shuayb, `alayhi-s-salam, also addressed his destroyed nation and said
similar words (7:93).

The fact that Nabi Salih, `alayhi-s-salam, and Nabi Shuayb, `alayhi-s-salam,
addressed their destroyed nations proves that according to these Nabi's,
even the dead kuffar can hear. If the kuffar can hear in their graves (the
destroyed people didn't even have graves) why can't Believers hear from
their graves?

In a Sahih Hadith regarding the Battle of Badr, it is narrated that the
Muslims threw Abu Jahl and other kuffar who were slain into a well. Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, went to their Qubur and asked them
whether they had found the promise of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, to be true
(that the kuffar would be punished.

Then, Sayyiduna Umar inquired of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, whether the dead could hear Him. Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi
wa sallam, explained that he (Umar) could not hear any better than them, but
they did not have the ability to respond (Bukhari-Kitab al-Maghazi).

This is the life of the kuffar dead.

Today, some ignorant Muslims say that even the Prophet and the Awliya cannot
hear us. We can only cry at their level of Imaan.

Abu Dawud (Kitab al-Jana'iz) narrates that Aishah, radi Allahu `anh, said
that when al-Najashi (the pious King of Abyssinia) had passed away, the
Sahabah reported that there was LIGHT shining from his grave (yura ala
Qabrihi Nur). He was not even a Sahabi but it was believed that he was a
Wali. Thus, if the Sahabah believed that the Awliya can have Nur (light) and
blessings at their Qubur, it does not matter what any 21st century ignorant
'scholar' says.

In another Sahih Hadith narrated by Ibn Hanbal, Hakim and Tabarani, Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, saw a person sitting on a Qabr and
told him: &quot;Do not harm the person in the Qabr and he will not harm you.&quot;(la
tu'zi sahib al-Qabri wala yu'zeek).

The 'Ulama of Hadith explained that this shows that the dead are affected by
what people do at their Qubur. This Hadith also shows that the dead feel
what happens on the top of their graves. Otherwise, why not sit on a Qabr,
if the dead does not feel anything?

Therefore one should not harm or destroy Qubur. On the other hand showing
respect at a Qabr and conveying your love to the inhabitant will also be
felt by him and result in like action being returned to you That is why
Muslims show outward respect to the Graves of those who they are ordered by
Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, to love, i.e. the Prophets and the Saliheen
(Saints of Allah).

The second part of the Hadith proves that the dead have the power to harm as
well as to benefit you, each in their own way and according to their status
with Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, of course.

Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal narrates that before Sayyidina Umar was buried in her
room, Sayyidah Aishah would go there without Hijab (head Covering), as the
Prophet (s.a.w) and Sayyiduna Abu Bakr, who were buried there were her
Husband and Father. However, when Sayyiduna Umar got buried there, she would
only go in the room with Hijab. (check Mishkat al-Masabih: Bab Ziyarat
al-Qubur).

This action clearly shows that according to Sayyidah Aishah, the dead can
feel and see their visitors and are aware of those who come to them and how
they come to them.

It is narrated in a Sahih Hadith that Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, said that every person's grave would be either a garden from the
gardens of Paradise or a hole from the holes of hell (Rawda mim Riyad
al-Jannah aw Hufrah min Hufar an Naar)

If the Qabr of a normal mu'min is a garden of paradise, what about the Qubur
of the Awliya of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala. Are they not from the Jannah?
If yes, then only a fool can claim that there is no Barakah there!

The people of Cape Town are Shafi'i. We say that when Imam al-Shafi'i was in
Baghdad, whenever he would have a problem, he would visit the TOMB of Imam
Abu Hanifah, pray two Rak'ahs there and ask Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala,
through the Barakah of Imam Abu Hanifah, and his problem would be
immediately be solved. He would also make those two Rak'ahs according to the
Hanafi Madhab. When asked why, he replied: &quot;In respect of the person in the
Tomb ( i.e. Abu Hanifah)&quot; (Ta'adduban ma'a Sahib al-Qabr).

This Authentic story is narrated by the Great Shafi'i scholar Imam Ibn Hajar
al-Makki in in his Book called &quot;al-Khairat al-Hisan fi Manaqib al-Imam
al-A'zam Abu Hanifah al-Nu'man&quot;. The great Hanafi scholar Ibn Aabidin
al-Shami also narrates it in the introduction of his massive work called
&quot;Radd al-Muhtar&quot;.

We ask, was Imam Shafi'i making Shirk, and are these great Ulama who
narrated this incident also encouraging Shirk? Na'uzu billah min dhalik.

*Summary:
**
**It is Sunnah to visit Qubur, even on a certain fixed day, annually.

The people in the Qubur have awareness about what is happening outside.
Some dead are actually praying or making Du'a in their Qubur.

It is Sunnah to recite Qur'an at the Qubur.

There is Barakah at the Qubur of the Awliya.

Graveyards become more blessed and significant when pious people are buried
there.

It is Sunnah to ask the pious to make Du'a for you. It is absurd to say that
one may ask the living pious for Du'a but once they have passed away it is
Shirk to ask Du'a, as they are still alive in their Qubur. Or, do they say
that Shirk is allowed with a living person and not allowed with a dead
person?
*
*QUESTION 2:
*
*Is it true that Sayyidana Umar, radi Allahu `anh, chopped down the tree
where he saw people praying to attain the Barakah of Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam?

It was believed that special Bay'ah-or oath of allegiance to the Prophet,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, was taken at this tree.

Mr.Gamieldien uses this to show that the Sahabah did not believe in the
Barakah of Sayyidina wa Mawlana Rasul Allah, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
and were against honouring his monuments *.

*ANSWER:
*
It is well known that when Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, was
in Hudaybiyyah he gave Bay'ah to the Sahabah under a certain tree.
This incident is known as Bay'at al-Ridwan. The tree became famous when
Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, mentioned it in the Holy Qur'an (48:18) saying:
(Laqad radiy Allahu anil muminina iz. Yubayi-oonaka tahta ash shajarah)
&quot;Verily Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, is Pleased with those Believers who gave
Bay'ah to you under the Tree&quot;.

In the time of Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu `anh, people were going to this
historical tree and praying there to receive the Barakah of Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam. Upon knowing this, Sayyidina Umar went there
and chopped down the tree. Faaik Gamieldien uses this Hadith, wrongly, to
prove that praying under the blessed tree was Shirk. Also, to search for
Tabarruk and blessings of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, and
pious people is Shirk and it is for this reason that Sayyidina Umar chopped
down the tree.

This is a great lie and some people fabricate this to suit their own ideas
and nafs.

Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu `anh, did chop down the tree, but not because he
thought the people praying there were Mushriks, who, by the way, were
Sahabah and Tabi'een themselves. That kind of a silly thought did not even
occur to his mind.

This incident ¬as recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari (Kitab al-Maghazi) and Muslim
(Kitab al-Imamah) ¬took place because there was controversy over which tree
was the one where the honourable Bay'ah was taken and reliable sources from
amongst the Sahabah held that that tree in question was definitely the wrong
tree and the original Tree could no longer be located and had mysteriously
vanished.

Ibn Umar (who was present in the Bay'ah under the Tree) said: &quot;No one could
locate the Tree after that year&quot;. (Bukhari).

Thus, the tree that the Sahabah and Tabi'een were visiting at Hudaybiyyah,
in the era of Sayyidina Umar was not the real one, but it was in the same
valley where the real one was.

Hence, the real reason for Sayyidina Umar's chopping down of the tree was
because it was wrongly believed to be the Tree under which the Holy Bay'ah
was taken.

In fact, the mysterious vanishing of the Real Tree by Allah, subhanaHu wa
Ta`ala, shows how important it was. The honourable Sahabah actually looked
for the Tree and could not find it.

Sayyidina Umar's respect for the relics and things of the Nabi , sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, can be ascertained from the following incident narrated
in Kanzul Ummal (vol.7 p.66) and Ibn Qudamah (al-Mughni vol.4 p.554):

Once while going to the Mosque to lead the Jum'ah Salah, Umar passed by a
canal (Mizab), which was in the way, and the dirty water from the canal
messed up his clean clothes. Umar got angry and took the canal out of the
way, went back home, dressed up again and went to Mosque.

In the Mosque, the Prophet's, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, uncle Sayyidina
Abbas confronted him and said: &quot;That canal was put there by the Messenger of
Allah, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, as I saw with my own eyes&quot;.

When Sayyidina Umar heard that, he immediately left the Mosque with Abbas
and went where that canal was, bent himself like in Ruku and said to
al-Abbas:

&quot;O Uncle of the Messenger of Allah, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, climb on
my back and put the canal back where Allah's Messenger put it&quot;.

THIS WAS THE LOVE AND RESPECT OUR MASTER UMAR HAD FOR THE THINGS RELATED TO
THE MASTER OF ALL BELIEVERS, SAYYIDINA MUHAMMAD, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam.

THOSE WITH NO LOVE IN THEIR HEARTS CAN SAY AND DO WHAT THEY WANT.

*Summary:
**
**Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu `anh, did not cut the tree because he believed
the people were making Shirk, he cut it because it was not the original
tree.

Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu `anh, had complete respect and honour for all
things related to the Prophet, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, and it is
unimaginable that he should show any kind of disrespect to them.

The Sahabah gave a lot of importance to that tree and that is why they tried
to locate it after the year of the Bay'ah. The Tabi'een would also go to the
valley of Hudaibiyyah looking for that tree. However, Allah, subhanaHu wa
Ta`ala, had made the original tree vanish for mysterious reasons. *

*QUESTION 3:
*
*What were the true views of Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu `anh, regarding
Tabarruk (seeking Barakah with the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam?
*
*ANSWER:*

We ask, why did Sayyidina Abu Bakr as well as Sayyidina Umar requested to be
buried next to the Qabr of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, in
his house, while everybody in Madinah gets buried in the Baqie?
Because they knew that there was Barakah at his Qabr and they wanted it.

In fact, it is related in Sahih al-Bukhari (Kitab al-Jana'iz), that when
Sayyidina Umar finally got the confirmation of his burial next to Prophet's,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, blessed Grave, he said: &quot;There was nothing
more important to me than that&quot; (Ma Kaan Shai Ahamm ilayya min Zaalik).

Today some people call it Shirk. May Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, guide them
to the Barakah of His Prophet (s.a.w).

It is narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari (Kitab al-Libas) that Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, had a ring; thereafter Sayyidina Abu Bakr,
radi Allahu `anh, had the ring, thereafter Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu `anh,
and thereafter Sayyidina Uthman, radi Allahu `anh. Clearly, they wore this
ring to receive the Barakah of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam.

It is narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari (Kitab al-Maghazi) that the same holds
true for the Spear of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam. It was
passed on to Sayyidina Abu Bakr, radi Allahu `anh, and then to Sayyidina
Umar, radi Allahu `anh, and then to Sayyidina Uthman, radi Allahu `anh, and
finally to Sayyidina 'Ali, radi Allahu `anh.

It is also narrated in Sahih Bukhari that Sayyidina Ibn Umar, radi Allahu
`anh, when travelling between Makkah and Madinah, would make a point of
praying at the spots where Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
prayed. Clearly, Sayyidina Ibn Umar, radi Allahu `anh, wished to receive the
Barakah of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam.

This was also the practice of Sayyidina Abu Musa al-Ashari as narrated by
Nasai (3/243).

Thus, the Sahabah would search out the places where Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, prayed, and they would pray there.

In Sahih Muslim (Kitab al-Libas vol.3 p.140), it is narrated that Asma', the
daughter of Sayyidina Abu Bakr had the garment of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, which she had received from Sayyidah Aishah ( r.a). She
would take the water with which she washed the holy Garment and give it to
the sick. They would drink it and be cured. The Sahabah had accepted the
fact that water from the blessed clothes of the Prophet, sall-Allahu `alayhi
wa sallam, had Barakah and could cure. Were these Sahabah Mushriks?

Tabarani narrates that Sayyidina Abu Mahzura once removed his Turban,
revealing a long patch of hair on his head. People inquired about this.
He explained that Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, had onced
touched him on that part of his head and he could not bring himself to cut
that hair.

It is narrated in Al-Shifa of al-Qadi Iyad that Sayyidina Ibn Umar, radi
Allahu `anh, would put his hands on Nabi Muhammad's, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, Mimbar (pulpit) and would wipe it over his face. He was clearly
looking for Tabarruk. If the Sahabah were clearly in need of Barakah, aren't
we?

Imam Ahmad Bin Hanbal narrates that the Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi
wa sallam, visited the mother of Anas Bin Malik and he drank half a cup of
beverage. She cut off and kept the part of the cup that had touched the Nabi
Muhammad's, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, lips, for purposes of Barakah.

Abu Dawud, Tabarani and Imam Hakim relate in a Sahih Hadith that during the
preparation for the battle of Uhud, one of the Sahabah was standing out of
line. Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, hit him back into line
with a stick. The man was unhappy about this and complained to Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam. Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi
wa sallam, gave him leave to exact revenge with like action. The man
insisted that Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, expose His flesh
as He, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, had hit him upon his naked skin.

Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, lifted up his shirt and the
man quickly kissed Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, on his
stomach. The Nabi, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, smiled and asked him to
explain his action. The man replied that he may die in the battle and wanted
to make sure that he had made physical contact with Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, at least once in his lifetime.

It is narrated by Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (p.144) that Sayyidina 'Ali,
radi Allahu `anh, used to kiss the hands and feet of Sayyidina al-Abbas,
radi Allahu `anh.

How can we today term as &quot;Shirk&quot;, actions, which were not only acceptable to
the Sahabah, but demonstrated their intense reverence of the Holy Prophet,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam.

In another Sahih Hadith narrated by Tabarani and Abu Yala:

In a battle between the Muslims and the Byzantine Romans, the Commander,

Sayyiduna Khalid bin al-Walid (who had the title of the &quot;Unleashed Sword of
Allah&quot;) was looking for a fez. When it was found, they saw that it was a
very old and tattered. So the Sahabah inquired why he was looking for such a
fez in the middle of a battle. He replied that he had stuck some hair of
Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, in it and whenever he would
have it in battle, he would be victorious. He had lost it and was worried
that the disbelievers would find it and win the battle.

In Sahih Muslim (Kitab al-Hajj) it is narrated that Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, distributed his hair amongst the Sahabah on
cutting it on Mina. Each Sahabah would take a bunch for Barakah.

It is narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari (Kitab al-Libas) that Sayyidah Umm Salmah
would keep the hair of her husband, Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, in a red glass. Whenever someone was ill she would stroke the
blessed Hair in water and give the water to that person to drink, and he
would then immediately be cured.

An-Nasai narrated that Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, gave
Bay'ah to a group of people. They informed Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, that they had worshipped idols before, but now that they
were Muslim, they desired to build a mosque in that vicinity and requested
His Du'a.

Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, performed the Wudu and gave
the water left from His Wudu to these people, ordering them to destroy the
idols and place the water in the mosque for Barakah. They were concerned
that the water may dry up before they reached their far destination.
Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, replied that the water would
bring purity and would not become less. (Mishkat al-Masabih).

It is narrated in Sahih Muslim (Kitab al-Zuhd) that Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, was travelling with his Sahabah through the
land of Thamud, the land of the people of Nabi Salih, `alayhi-s-salam.
While travelling, the Sahabah collected water from the wells in that land.
Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, ordered the Sahabah to throw
that water away, as those were the wells of the kuffar in the time of Nabi
Salih, `alayhi-s-salam. Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, then
permitted them to drink from a certain well that the camel of Nabi Salih,
`alayhi-s-salam, drank out of.

Imam al-Nawawi (Sharh Muslim vol.8 p.118) comments on this Hadith that we
should try to derive blessings from things connected to pious people (wa min
fawaid hazal Hadith, at-Tabarruk bi Aasaar as-Saliheen).

It is important to note here that if Barakah is received from the camel of a
pious person (who lived about 4000 years ago), what then about the Qubur of
the Awliya of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala?!

In Sahih Muslim, it is narrated that Sayyidina Utbaan, radi Allahu `anh,
always asked Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, to pray in a
certain part of his house, so that he too may pray there and receive
blessings in this regard.

Imam al-Nawawi says in Sharh Muslim vol.5 p.161 that there are three main
things (Fawa'id) we learn from this Hadith:

It is permitted to get Barakah from Pious People and objects connected to
them.

It is recommended to pray in the places where the pious used to pray.

It is recommended to seek Barakah from the places where the pious people
resided.

Perhaps, the greatest proof of Tabarruk is the Story of the Holy Tabut
(Wooden Chest) as mentioned in Surah al-Baqarah (Ayah 248):

&quot; And their Prophet said to them: 'Verily the Sign of his authority is that
there shall come to you the Tabut with with an assurance therein from Your
Lord and the Relics left by the Family of Moses and the Family of Aaron,
Carried by Angels. In this is a Symbol for you if you indeed have Faith&quot;.

Al-Qurtubi (in his Tafsir vol.3 p.247) and Ibn Katheer (in his Al-Bidayah
vol.1 p.8), write that the Jews, before embarking on a battle, would put
this Chest in front of them and Pray, and they would then be victorious
through the Barakah of that Holy Chest!

Ibn Katheer (in his Tafsir vol. p.313) narrates that this Holy Chest
(Tabut), carried respectfully by the very Mala'ika of Allah, contained the
Sandals, Clothes, Sticks and other blessed Relics of Nabi Musa and Nabi
Harun, `alayhi-s-salam.

One need not to think that if the Relics of the Prophets of Bani Israel are
so Honourable and Blessed in the Eyes of Allah, how Honourable and Blessed
then are the things related to The Master of all Prophets, Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam!!!

*Summary:
*
*The Holy Quran clearly supports the Veneration of the Relics of the Nabis
and that they are a source of security and Barakah..

All the Sahabah always sought Tabarruk from any object connected to the
pious. Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, was first and foremost
in teaching us to receive blessing from him as illustrated by the fact that
He distributed his Hair and Wudu water.

It is important to note that the learned 'Ulama such as Imam Ahmad bin
Hanbal, radi Allahu `anh, and Imam Nawawi, radi Allahu `anh, etc. approved
of the concept of Tabarruk. Maybe our contemporary local 'uluma are more
learned than them?

To those who say that only Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, gives Barakah - not
people, we agree, but we hold that people are able to share the Barakah that
Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, gives them. All Barakah comes from Allah,
subhanaHu wa Ta`ala: the Barakah of the Qu'ran, of Islam, of the Ka'bah, of
Madinah, of voluntary charity, of Zamzam water. Do we deprive ourselves from
the Barakah of these things?! Of course not.

Every Muslim knows that these are only &quot;Means&quot; and &quot;Attractors&quot; and that the
real Source of Barakah is only Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala.

If anyone wants to proclaim a limit upon Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, and His
Barakah by saying that Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, cannot bestow Barakah
upon individuals and objects whom He wants to, that person has a serious
misunderstanding of the Attributes of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala.
*
*QUESTION 4:
*
*Is it allowed to Kiss the Qabr?
*
*ANSWER:
*
The issue of kissing is often (deliberately) misunderstood. Kissing is a
natural human behaviour. One could kiss someone out of love, respect,
honour, desire, or maybe even worship. It depends on your intention - the
reason why you do it. However, some individuals insist on interpreting all
types of kissing as worship. There is no real basis for this view, as it is
not found anywhere in the Quran or the Sunnah.

Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, used to kiss the black stone,
and thus, by the Prophet's action one can clearly see that there is a
distinction between merely kissing and worshipping. And even as this stone
is the stone from Heaven (as in Nasai, Tirmidhi and Hakim), so are the
Prophets, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, and the saints the People of
Heaven.

These individuals then proceed to label Muslims who may kiss them out of
veneration or love as Mushriks or Kafir. This labeling is the real act of
Kufr.

There is an interesting story about a man who condemned the kissing of the
Awliya and the descendants of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
as Shirk and Worship of other Humans. When he was seen kissing his own son,
he was asked why he was now worshipping his son. He said that he kissed his
son out of love. The people responded by saying that they, too, kissed the
family of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, out of love. The man
then kept quiet.

It is for this reason, the reason of love and respect, that visitors to the
Qubur of the Ahlul Bayt, Sahabah, and Awliya kiss their respective Qubur.
If individuals insist on holding the view that kissing a Qabr is an act of
worship, let them prove it from Qur'an and Sunnah, and not merely give an
opinion based on their hawa, or base desire.

There are many Hadith which show that the Sahabah used to kiss the grave of
Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam:

Ibn Asakir in Tarikh Dimashq, al-Samhudi in Wafa al-Wafa and al-Imam
al-Mujtahid al-Subki in Shifa as-Siqam bi-ziyarat Khayr al-Anaam, narrate
that when Sayyidina Bilal, radi Allahu `anh, came back to Madinah after many
years, he went straight to the Honourable Qabr of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, and fell down and put his forehead on the Qabr, and
kissed it, saying, &quot;Oh my beloved, Rasulullah, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam.&quot;

This was an expression of his love for Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam. No doubt, some of todays &quot;shaykhs&quot; would label Sayyidina Bilal a
&quot;Mushrik&quot;, claiming that he was worshipping the Prophet, sall-Allahu `alayhi
wa sallam! Astaghfirullah.

Tabarani narrates that Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, radi Allahu `anh, the Great
Sahabi, once put his head on the honourable Qabr of Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, and kissed it. The Umayyad ruler, Marwan bin
al-Hakam, a notorious man, asked Abu Ayyub why he was worshipping the stone.
Abu Ayyub replied that he was visiting Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, and not a stone. Someone then intervened and warned Marwan not to
interfere with Abu Ayyub, radi Allahu `anh, as he was one of the Companions
of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, and Marwan let him be.

Thus, when we visit the tombs of the Ahl al-Bayt and the Awliya, we are
expressing our love for them, as Sayyidina Bilal and Sayyidina Abu Ayyub,
not worshipping them.

Imam al-Qastalani narrates in his Mawahib Ladunniyyah that when Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, died, his daughter, Sayyidah
Fatimah, radi Allahu `anha', took sand from His Qabr and put it over her
face and wept, saying:

&quot;Maza ala man shamma Turbata Ahmadin an laa yashumma madaz Zamaani Ghawaliya

(The person who has smelt the dust of the Grave of Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, does not need to smell any perfume ever
again)

In other words, the Dust on the Qabr of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi
wa sallam, has a better fragrance than any perfume in the world. This is
what Imam al-Busiri said in his world famous Qasidat al-Burdah and some
ignorant 'shaykhs' called him a Kafir too.

Would some of todays &quot;shaykhs&quot; also condemn Sayyidah Fatimah's act of Love,
radi Allahu `anha'! Astaghfirullah!

Ibn Hisham narrates that when Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
had passed away, Sayyidina Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, radi Allahu `anh, went to
kiss his forehead and said, &quot;How blessed and perfumed are you when you are
alive, and how blessed and perfumed are you when you have passed away.&quot; Was
he making Shirk?

These are evidences from the Sahabah. And the same Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, who instructed us to destroy all the idols
also instructed us to kiss the black stone - not for worship - but because
of the stones closeness to Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala. We draw an analogy
between this stone and the tombs of the Awliya.

The Ka'bah is also a stone building. We pray towards it and tawaf around it.
Does imply worship? No! The Ka'bah represents the presence Allah, subhanaHu
wa Ta`ala, just as the shrines of the Awliya are places where Allah's,
subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, Rahmah descends.

We also pray at the Maqam Ibrahim, as we are clearly instructed to in the
Holy Qur'an (1:125): &quot;And take Maqam Ibrahim as a place of Prayer&quot; (wat
takhizu min Maqam Ibrahima Musalla ) . Maqam Ibrahim is merely a large slab
of stone containing the footprints of Nabi Ibrahim, `alayhi-s-salam. It is
thousands of years old, and is not even a grave, nor the physical feet of
Nabi Ibrahim, `alayhi-s-salam. Is praying there Shirk or Kufr? If not, then
why condemn praying at the tomb of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, and the Awliya of his Ummah?!

Imam al-Dhahabi narrates in Majmu' Shuyukh al-Dhahabi (vol.1 p.72-74) that
the son of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said to his father that people touch and
kiss the Qabr of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, to get the
Barakah. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal replied that there was no problem with that
(la ba'sa bihi).

Imam al-Dhahabi went on to explain that:

&quot;Only some of the Sahabah did this, as the Sahabah had (obviously) seen Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, when he was alive, had close
interaction with him, kissed his hand, fought over his Wudu water,
distributed his Hair for Barakah, and even took his spit and rubbing it over
their faces (as in Bukhari in clear words). But those who had not met Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, express their love by going to his
Qabr, and kissing and touching it&quot;.

Imam al-Ghazali says in his famous work Minhaj al-'Abideen (p.347) that the
Wali of Allah reaches such a state that: &quot;Allah gives Barakah in his Breath,
Speech, Clothes, Company, places where he sat and even the Sand he walked
on&quot;.

If the Barakah IS THERE, what is wrong if we try to get it??????

We Ask:

If we kiss the cloth over the Ka'bah because inside it is the House of
Allah,

And the cover of the Quran because inside it is the Book of Allah.

THEN why can't we kiss the cloth over a Tomb because inside it is a Wali of
Allah?????

Some ignorant and misguided people, upon losing all arguments, then go on to
question the integrity of the Honourable Awliya and say: How do we know
Status in the Akhirah?

For them, the following Two Hadith's from Bukhari (Kitab al-Jan'iz) should
suffice:

It is narrated that once a Janazah went pass the Prophet (s.a.w), and some
of his Companions praised the dead person, so the Prophet ( s.a.w) said:
&quot;It has been affirmed to him&quot;. They asked : What?. He said &quot;The Jannah&quot;,
giving the reason for it as &quot;You are the Witnesses of Allah on this Earth&quot;
(Antum Shuhad'a Allah fil Ard).

The Prophet, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, also said: &quot;Any Muslim, who is
attested by four people to have Good Nature-Allah will enter him into
Paradise&quot;.

We say, the Awliya of this Ummah are attested by Millions of Pious Muslims
to be from the Friends of Allah, how can one then still question their
Imaan?

How can such an evil thought even occur in a Muslim's mind concerning those
who are honoured by both Allah and his Creation?

*To have a bad opinion of an ordinary Human Being is a sin, let alone to
question the Imaan of those Saints whose holy lives and examples have
inspired generations of True Believers in Allah.

Point: If an accusation is made that people are kissing the Awliya out of
worship, it remains the onus of the accusers to prove this, as we are all
Muslims who say, &quot;La ilaha ill-Allah, Muhammadun Rasul Allah.&quot;
To brand a Muslim as a Kafir is one of the gravest sins in Islam. We worship
Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, and honour his friends.

Shirk is related to one's internal belief concerning Allah, it is not about
kissing and respecting. To consider acts of love and respect as Shirk is a
trivialization of the concept of Shirk. In fact, to call Muslims as Mushriks
on issues of difference is the real Bid'ah that is plaguing the Ummah of
Islam.
*
*QUESTION 5:
*
*Is it allowed to put flowers on the Qabr?
*
*ANSWER:

*It is narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim that:

Once, while travelling, Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
stopped at a certain place and said that there was a grave in front of him,
and that the person therein is busy suffering punishment. Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, then broke off two branches from a date palm
and placed in on the grave, and said that as long as the branches were
fresh, the punishment would be lessened.

This is because the fresh branches would be making the Dhikr of Allah,
subhanaHu wa Ta`ala. So this act is a Sunnah, and people use flowers, as it
is more available and also able to maintain its freshness for much longer.

From this we can also deduce that if we ourselves perform Dhikr at the
Qubur, it would also lessen the inhabitants' punishment. Performing Dhikr at
the Qubur of the Awliya would bring more blessings upon their respective
Ruhs (souls). Doing this would be compliance with a divine order.

It is stated in the famous Hanafi Fiqh book Fatawa Alamgiriyyah/Hindiyyah
(Kitab al-Jana'iz) that it is allowed to put flowers on a grave.

Mullah Ali al-Qari writes in the commentary of the above-mentioned Hadith in
al-Mirqat fi Sharh al-Mishkat that:

&quot;Our Ulama have issued a ruling that to place fragrance and plants (over a
grave) are a Sunnah practice&quot;.

One fails to understand how placing flowers over a grave means associating a
Partner with Allah!!! To say that, actually means that flowers should only
be put on the grave of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala!
Astaghfirullah!!!!
It is sad that sometimes, even so-called learned people also cannot
understand the consequences of calling a normal practice of Muslims as
Shirk.

*Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said that &quot;The one who does
not thank people, does not thank Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala,&quot;, and we owe it
to the Prophets, `alaymmu-s-salam, and Awliya, who protected and spread the
Deen of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, over the ages, that we visit their
shrines, dress it with flowers if we wish to (as it is Sunnah) and make
Dhikr there. A Nation, which does not honour its true servants and heroes,
is an ungrateful Nation and is bound to confusio n*.

*QUESTION 6:
*
*Is it allowed to build Domes or structures over graves?*

*ANSWER:
*
Pseudo scholars define Bid'ah as anything that Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, did not do. However, the true definition of Bid'ah is:
'Anything that has not been done by Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa
sallam, and does not have an origin (Asl) in the Shari'ah ¬ Qur'an and
Sunnah'.

Certain people unceremoniously condemn the building of domes on Qubur as
Bid'ah, but what about the building of domes on the Moques?

There were no domes on the Mosques in the time of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, nor were there any carpets, Minarets or Mihrabs. All
these designs and structures were added long after the Beloved Nabi's time.

Domes were added to amplify the voice of the Imam by making it echo, carpets
were added so that people did not have to pray on sand and minarets were
added so that people could see the location of the mosque from a distance.
Let those who cry &quot;Bid'ah!&quot; build themselves a mosque without a dome,
carpet, Mihrab and Minarets.

Let us remember that the Nabi, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, himself put a
large stone to mark the grave of his Sahabi Uthman bin Maz'un and said:
(li A'alama bihi Qabra Akhi) i.e. &quot;So that I can know the Qabr of my
brother&quot;.
(Abu Dawud and Mishkat al-Masabih).

This Hadith is the Asl (Islamic origin) for marking graves, especially that
of special people so that they may be KNOWN. The designs and style of
structure may change over the centuries, but the Original Idea comes from
the Sunnah, as the idea to decorate Masajid.

The most significant proof for the permissibility of having structures over
graves is the example of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam,
himself. He said that a Prophet should be buried where he passed away.
Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, passed away inside his house
and was subsequently buried inside it, and the Sahabah did not destroy that
structure.

For those who claim that this is an exception applicable only to Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, firstly, let them prove it from the
Qur'an or Sunnah, and secondly, we ask them why Sayyidina Abu Bakr
As-Siddiq, radi Allahu `anh, also wanted to be buried inside this structure?
The very same holds true for Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu `anh, who was also
buried inside this structure. Their action clearly shows the validity of
having a grave in a structure, for non-Prophets as well.

Another Hadith often misinterpreted and quoted out of context is where Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, ordered his Sahabah to destroy all
the high graves.

In the time of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, there were no
graves of Muslims, only graves of kuffar, which were built high. The Sahabah
were thus ordered to destroy the high structures on the graves of the
kuffar, not of the Anbiya or Awliya.

A significant evidence to support this is that when Sayyidina Umar, radi
Allahu `anh, conquered Syria and Palestine, both lands abounded with great
tombs of the honoured Prophets, `alaymu-s-salam, of Allah, subhanaHu wa
Ta`ala, e.g. the shrine of Nabi Ibrahim, `alayhi-s-salam, the tomb of Nabi
Yusuf, `alayhi-s-salam, Nabi Ya'qub, `alayhi-s-salam, Nabi Dawud,
`alayhi-s-salam, Nabi Sulayman, `alayhi-s-salam.

Sayyidina Umar, radi Allahu `anh, destroyed the idols in Syria and
Palestine, but he did not touch the shrines of the beloved Prophets,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala. Thus the above
Hadith refers to the high graves of the kuffar.

In a Sahih Hadith, Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, says that
the honour of a Mu'min who has passed away is the same like his honour was
when he was alive (Hurmatul Mumini maitan ka Hurmatihi Hayyan).

Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, says that the most honourable of you in the
sight of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, are the pious ones. So we respect the
pious in the Dunya, and when they pass away, we continue honouring them by
venerating their graves (as allowed in Islam of course).

In another Sahih Hadith, it is narrated that when Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam, looked at the Holy Ka'bah, he said, &quot;How great are you,
oh house of Allah, but I swear by Allah who created me, that the honour the
believer is even greater than you&quot;.

The Holy Quran (Surah al-Haj Ayah 32) says:

&quot;And those who venerate the Sha'a'ir Allahi (Signs/Symbols of Allah), then
that is from the Taqwa in their hearts&quot;. (wa man yuazzim sha'a'ir Allahi fa
innaha min Taqwal Qulub)

In the Quran (1:158), the mountains of Safa and Marwah were called Sha'a'ir
Allahi, because they are the mountains on which a Waliyyah from the Ummah of
Nabi Ibrahim, `alayhi-s-salam, called Hajirah ran seven times.

What about a place where a Wali from the Ummah of Nabi Muhammad's,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, is resting?

We believe that place is also from the Sha'a'ir Allahi and should be
honoured.

It is thus unfortunate that some people want to prohibit us from honouring
the Awliya of Allah. They forget that we honour them for the sake of Allah
and not as Partners with Allah. No Muslim can ever do that.

There are also Qur'anic evidences supporting the building of structures at
graves.

Surah al-Kahf, Ayah 21, speaks about the honourable Ashab al-Kahf.
According to Tafsir al-Jalalayn, 'The believers' built a Masjid at their
Qubur. This was to derive extra blessings from the pious ones buried there,
as in the Tafsirs of Khaffaji, Baydawi, Razi and Ruh Al-Bayan.

Also often misinterpreted is the Hadith which says that Allah, subhanaHu wa
Ta`ala, cursed the people who have turned the Qubur of Prophets into
Mosques.

This Hadith is actually referring to those people who actually pray to the
Prophets, and not those who merely pray near the Prophets' graves - to
Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, - for the sake of Barakah.

Every Haji can see that in Madinah, in the Blessed Prophet's (s.a.w) Mosque,
people have been praying around the four sides of His Holy and Blessed Qabr
ash-Shareef for 1400 years. Was that Shirk?

In Makkah, it is recommended to pray in Hijr Ismail (also called Hateem), as
it has the Qabr of Nabi Ismail ( a.s) in it as many scholars have said

(Qisas al-Anbiya by Ibn Katheer).

In the famous work of Shafi'i Fiqh, Umdat as-Salik, it is clearly stated
that what is meant by &quot;making a Qabr a Masjid&quot; is:

&quot;praying to it in honour or praying on it (Reliance of the Traveller p.896).

&quot;Ittikhaz al-Qubur Masajid&quot; does not mean praying around it or building
structures over it. Building something on a Qabr is definitely not allowed
as it is disrespectful to the person buried, but establishing the Qabr and
building a structure over it is definitely allowed and the universal
practice of the Ummah for 1400 years. There is no clear proof against this,
only for it.

For 1400 years, the Honourable Tombs of the Great Sons and Daughters of
Islam, throughout the Islamic World, have acted as symbols of inspiration
and glory for all Muslims, as well as a source of Barakah and Spirituality.

It is indeed sad that, today, while other nations are working hard to
maintain the memory of their Heroes and Leaders, We are being are told by
certain ignorant 20th scholars to wipe out the memory of Our Heroes and
Leaders.

*In summary, to kiss the black stone is a Sunnah, to decorate the grave with
flowers is a Sunnah, and to destroy the graves of the Awliya is a Bid'ah.
The Sahabah actually used to maintain the graves *.

*Question 7:

Another condemnation issued Shaykh Faaik was the comparison that he drew
between the Muslims of Cape Town (and of the whole world for that matter as
every Muslim country has respected Tombs/Kramats) who visit the shrines of
the Awliya, and the idolaters in the time of Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu
`alayhi wa sallam? Are we the Same as the idolaters of Makkah?

Answer:
*
That statement of 'Shaykh' Faaik really proves how ignorant he is. Here,
Faaik is actually trying to invalidate an authentic saying of Nabi
Muhammad's, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam.

It is narrated in a Sahih Hadith in Ibn Majah (Kitab al-Zuhd), that Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said that the thing he dreaded most
for his Ummah was Shirk. Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, went
on to say that he does not mean that his Ummah is going to worship the sun
or the moon or idols (ama la aqulu tabuduna shamsan wala qamaran wala
wasana), but that they are going to do things for reasons besides for the
sake of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, e.g. they would pray to impress people,
perform hajj to show off, and the study the Deen to show off to people or
cause Fitnah.

So, Prophet Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, did not fear that his
Ummah would worship idols. If someone comes along and says that the Ummah of
Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, is worshipping idols, he is
implying that Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, was wrong.
Astagh firullah.

Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, actually warned us about
people like Shaykh Faaik. It is narrated in a Sahih Hadith that Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said that towards the end of time,
people will say to you things that neither you, nor your forefathers have
heard. Nabi Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, goes on to say that we
should beware of them, lest we be misguided into confusion.

In the light of the fact that Shaykh Faaik is quoting Hadith about the
kuffar in Makkah who worshipped idols and is now using in reference to
Muslims, we say:

In Sahih al-Bukhari it is narrated that Abdullah ibn Umar said that the
Khawarij (enemies of Sayyidina Ali) were the worst of people because they
used Qur'anic Ayats referring to the kuffar, and made it to refer to
believers. (nazalat fil Mushrikeen wa Ja'a looha fil Mumineen).This is
exactly what Shaykh Faaik is doing.

Shaykh Faaik also compared us to the people who, in the time of Nabi Nuh,
`alayhi-s-salam, used to keep pictures of certain people and then worshipped
it. How can he compare those kuffar to the Ummah of Nabi Muhammad,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam? How can one compare the misguided people of
Nabi Nuh to the blessed followers of Nabi Muhammad ( s.a.w)?

Shaykh Faaik also says that if you honour the Awliya, you will end up
worshipping them. However, Muslims all over the world have been honouring
the Awliya for 1400 years, and until today, nobody has ever worshipped them.
In Cape Town people have been honouring the Awliya for 300 years and,
alhamdulillah, the people of Cape Town are still Muslims - nobody worships
the Awliya, but all respect them, except hypocrites of course.

Finally, Shaykh Faaik quotes an Ayah of the Qur'an where the kuffar say that
they worship idols to get closer to Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, claiming
that that is the same for those who visit the shrines of the Awliya of
Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala. This is an utter misinterpretation of that Ayah.
The kuffar were lying - they did not really and fully believe in Allah,
subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, but were only making excuses.

Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, instructed us not to swear at the &quot;gods&quot; of the
kuffar, as these kuffar will then swear at Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, (The
Holy Qur'an 6:108). This proves that they did not really believe in Allah,
subhanaHu wa Ta`ala. In the battle of Uhud, the Kuffar were calling the
names of their idols, when the Sahabah called the name of Allah, subhanaHu
wa Ta`ala!

Also, the kuffar explicitly said that they worship (Na'buduhum) their &quot;gods&quot;
to get closer to Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala. Not a single Muslim out of all
the millions of Muslims in the world who visit the Awliya claims to worship
them. We only respect and love them and want to be close to them because
Allah says:

(Inna Rahmat Allahi Qaribun minal Muhsineen) i.e. Verily, the Rahmah (Mercy)
of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, is close to the Pious Ones.

We can only repeat the Ayah of the Quran: (Afa tajaloon al-Muslimeena kal
Mujrimeen-Maalakum Kaifa tahkumun) i.e. &quot;Do you make the Muslims like the
Mujrims (Kuffar)-What is (wrong) with you, How do you Judge?&quot;

Faaik Gamieldien says that only Allah is our protector and helper and we
don't need any Prophet or pious person's Barakah.

We say that Allah himself clearly states in the Holy Qur'an (5:55):

&quot;Verily, your Wali (Protector or Helper) is Allah, His Messenger, and the
believers&quot;. (Exact words of the Saudi translation of the Qur'an validated by
the university of Madinah, printed in Riyadh: 1993).

Also, it is narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari (Kitab al-Jihad) under the Heading
&quot;Whoever Sought the Help of the Poor and the Pious people in War&quot;, that the
Prophet, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, said:

&quot;You gain no victory or livelihood except through (the blessings and
invocations of) the poor amongst you&quot;. (Exact words of the Saudi Validated
translation by Muhsin Khan).

Yes, ultimately Allah is the only protector and helper but the Anbiya and
the Awliya are the attractors and the reflections and of his help and
protection. Only an ignoramus can deny this.

*CONCLUSION
*
Today some people claim to teach us Tawhid. We have to remember that there
are two types of Tawhid - the true Tawhid, and the false tawhid. We have to
beware of the false tawhid, which is the tawhid of Iblis, as it started with
him.

Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, ordered Iblis (Shaytan) to Sujud (prostrate)
before Nabi Adam, `alayhi-s-salam, out of veneration. Iblis responded that
he only venerates Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, and nobody else. What is
Iblis's fate? Hell.

The cursed Iblis was the first 'Aalim' who thought that venerating a friend
of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, is against Tawhid.

So those who do not want us to honour the people who Allah, subhanaHu wa
Ta`ala, has honoured by making them His Awliya, are like Iblis - claiming to
honour Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala, exclusively, and not honouring the
friends of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala.

The Malaika (Angels) knew that true belief in Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala,
means loving, respecting, and venerating all those close to him, so they
bowed to Adam (a.s), and were blessed.

It is ironic that the Mala'ika (Angels) made Sajdah to Nabi Adam,
`alayhi-s-salam, but some people today, have a problem with Honouring Nabi
Muhammad, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, and don't want to stand up for his
honour.

However, they will stand up to drink Zamzam water, in respect of it and
because it is Sunnah to drink Zamzam standing and drink all other water
sitting. They honour Zamzam, water that come from the Blessed feet of Nabi
Ismail, `alayhi-s-salam, but refuse to honour the greatest of all Prophets.

This becomes even more ironic when we read in Sahih al-Bukhari (Kitab
al-Jana'iz) that the Nabi, sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, and His Sahabah
would even stand up in respect for a Jewish man's funeral procession!!!

A Jewish man's Janazah can be honoured but the Beloved Nabi of Allah,
sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam, cannot be Honoured because it is bid'ah to
stand up!!! This is the Tawhid of Iblis.

The Tawhid of Islam insists that we honour all those whom Allah, subhanaHu
wa Ta`ala, has honoured, the Anbiya, Siddiqin, Shuhada and Salihin, all the
honourable Prophets and Friends of Allah, subhanaHu wa Ta`ala.

*NOTE: If Mr.Gamieldien cannot answer all these decisive proofs, then he
should keep quiet and go back to study the Qur'an and Sunnah.

WE ASK ALLAHU TA'ALA TO GIVE US ALL A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HIS DEEN.
