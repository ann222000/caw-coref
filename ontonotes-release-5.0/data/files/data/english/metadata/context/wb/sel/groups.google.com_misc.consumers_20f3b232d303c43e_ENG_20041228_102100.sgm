&gt; I was tempted to go to Best Buy today.

&gt; I've been thinking about picking up a copy of Doom 3 for a while now.
&gt; I was a big fan of the first two games, and I've read that the new
&gt; chapter is visually stunning. However, nostalgia isn't enough to may
&gt; me fork over $50 for the game; I've been waiting for it to come on
&gt; sale.

&gt; So I noticed while cruising the Doom 3 website that they have &quot;special
&gt; holiday pricing&quot; on the game - and they give links to 3 stores: EB
&gt; Games, Gamestop, and Best Buy. So just for snicks, I clicked on the
&gt; Best Buy link, and saw they had it on sale for $20 off, bringing the
&gt; price down to $29.95.

&gt; http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1051806885631&amp;skuId=538332...

&gt; Notice the web site says nothing about any rebates.

&gt; I checked availability at the BB store near my house; sure enough,
&gt; they had it in stock. I could have added it to my cart and selected
&gt;&quot;in-store pickup&quot; but I figured it would be faster to just drive over
&gt; there since it's 10 minutes away. So I headed on over, figuring this
&gt; would be a great opportunity for me to buy a Best Buy loss-leader. :)

&gt; So when I get to the store, I find a big endcap full of Doom 3 boxes,
&gt; but no hint of any sale price. Checking the sale flyer, I see that the
&gt; game is priced at $29.95 &quot;after savings.&quot;

&gt; http://bestbuy.dailyshopper.com/index.aspx?pagename=circularlarge&amp;zip...

&gt; WTF?!?!?!!? Why do I pay one price when I pay online and pick it up in
&gt; the store, and another when I pay in the store and pick it up in the
&gt; store? I know there's some scheme behind all this that's designed to
&gt; milk more money out of the sheep who regularly shop at Best Buy
&gt; despire the poor treatment they receive, but I'll be damned if I can
&gt; figure out what it is... It certainly didn't work on me. :rolleyes:

"/> So in other words, you didn't even ASK someone to scan it for
you to see what the in-store price was, correct? And I guess
that you were quick to equate &quot;after savings&quot; with &quot;after
rebate&quot;, when in fact they are two very different things.

I'm not sure why they'd say &quot;after savings&quot; but stores like BB
and CompUSA (especially CompUSA) like to advertise things like
that (maybe some nonsense with the manufacturer). Had you
bothered to stick around and not make assumptions, you would
almost definitely have discovered that the price at the register
was the very same $29.95 as you were planning to pay. And of
course, had you ordered online for in-store pickup, you would
have gotten the $29.95 price (although I'm not sure that would
have been a great idea this week since last time I did a pickup
at BB the line to pick up was the same as returns, which is
going to be very long this week).

Best Buy does some things poorly, and they are certainly worthy
of complaints. But you continue to post such ridiculous stuff
that I can't see that anyone would give you any sympathy. Maybe
if you stop spinning things to make perfectly normal stuff look
bad, you'd find some stuff that actually does deserve abuse.

Oh, and personally, in a case where BB had something on sale
that I wanted, but I did not want to shop at BB, I'd just find
the nearest store with a price matching policy (preferably one
that gives you an extra 10-15% of the difference) and buy it
there. That way you get better than BB's price, AND you don't
have to deal with them. A win-win situation.

BBY has a pretty nice POS system. They do pretty well in that

quickly. I would be surprised if that line was 20 minutes. A
given customer can get through the checkout in a minute or so
unless they have something special, and most of the special
stuff is handled either at customer service or in the specific
departments these days.

Why bother! Ask a pimple face punk kid that will won't no. Or stand
in line for an hour because they are so cheap they won't hire more
minimum wage help at the cash registers.

That place is a monstrosity.
