The guy's argument was weak and honestly not worth addressing.  Yeah,
football players push each other.  And in almost every running play and pile
up there's still a great deal going on after the whistle (and I'm not even
sure in this case the push was after the whistle).  The guy needs to find
better things to whine about.  If Olivea's whining, he needs to grow a pair.
I guess LT's been getting in his ear.

Curious, since you did address it.  Olivea was in a very dangerous position
(no leverage and only one way for back to go), injury was result of Thomas's
activity and yes, after play was over.  What in his statement makes the
argument weak (conceding it was after the whistle)?

The argument, as I understood it, was that it was a dirty play because he
was still pushing after the whistle [do we know that the whistle had blown?
wait, doesn't matter.  the nfl has decided to enact the ridiculous rule of
play not ending at the whistle.]

So if that's dirty, then you've got another 20 or 30 other &quot;dirty&quot; plays in
that game, including the times when running backs (on both sides) were gang
tackled, the whistle blew, and the push backwards continued.  And I suppose
also the dirty play of Mankins trying to push the guys off his running back
(who, incidentally, were pushing him after forward progress was determined).

It's football.  I see nothing wrong with any of that stuff.  And I also
think you'd have a hard time also demonstrating that it was a deliberate
attempt to injure, but I admit that doesn't look to be the original poster's
theory.

Did Thomas know Olivea was in a very precarious position when he continued
to drive him back after the whistle?  I doubt Thomas knew but it looked bad
after a couple of replays this morning.  Good luck rest of season and would
like another shot in January :)

Naw, I should have gotten this. DUH!
And yeah, it was hard to watch because you never want to see guys get
injured.
Still, the power and strength exhibited by AD on the play is amazing.
Olivea is a guy who literally drove Warren onto his ass on a play last
winter.
I'm not suggesting AD is stronger than Warren by any means, but he's
nonetheless a big and strong guy....a big strong guy who can also run
with receiver.

Stop and think about it.  Remember your high school physics class.
You heve several large 300+ pound football players colliding.   All of
a sudden an official blows a wistle and play is supposed to stop
instantly.   Drop a brick out the window, blow a wistle,  and see how
fast that brick stops in mid air.   Ain't going to happen.   Same
principle when players collide.    The official blows the whistle
and play will stop when the players hit the ground, hit an opposing
player, or can stop the momentum they've built up.   Still takes
a certain amount of time.   The player won't come to a complete halt
for a good period of time.

It's a cheap shot. I called it that the instant it happened in the game, and
Olivea did the same three hours later in the post-game interviews. I hadn't
heard what he had to say when I posted, but all it did was confirm what I saw in
the broadcast.

And yes, football is a rough game. Which is why you don't go ballistic on the
other team's fans when shit happens and it results in a &quot;might miss a start&quot;
sort of injury.

But wait until you guys play the Broncos and they chop Vrabel, I'll bet you
change your tune. (and they will.)

That's fine, I've been reading a bunch of crap, where the posters thinks by
adding the asterisks, it diminishes the Pats accomplishments.
If that wasn't your intention, then I apologize.

Also, I think one  of the sacks on Brady, with the head slap, was just as
dirty, but in the NFL, who knows.

BTW, thanks for calling me stud!! :-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; Curious, since you did address it.  Olivea was in a very dangerous position
&gt; &gt;&gt; (no leverage and only one way for back to go), injury was result of Thomas's
&gt; &gt;&gt; activity and yes, after play was over.  What in his statement makes the
&gt; &gt;&gt; argument weak (conceding it was after the whistle)?

&gt; &gt; The argument, as I understood it, was that it was a dirty play because he was
&gt; &gt; still pushing after the whistle [do we know that the whistle had blown? wait,
&gt; &gt; doesn't matter.  the nfl has decided to enact the ridiculous rule of play not
&gt; &gt; ending at the whistle.]

&gt; &gt; So if that's dirty, then you've got another 20 or 30 other &quot;dirty&quot; plays in
&gt; &gt; that game, including the times when running backs (on both sides) were gang
&gt; &gt; tackled, the whistle blew, and the push backwards continued.  And I suppose
&gt; &gt; also the dirty play of Mankins trying to push the guys off his running back
&gt; &gt; (who, incidentally, were pushing him after forward progress was determined).

&gt; &gt; It's football.  I see nothing wrong with any of that stuff.  And I also think
&gt; &gt; you'd have a hard time also demonstrating that it was a deliberate attempt to
&gt; &gt; injure, but I admit that doesn't look to be the original poster's theory.

&gt; It's a cheap shot. I called it that the instant it happened in the game, and
&gt; Olivea did the same three hours later in the post-game interviews. I hadn't
&gt; heard what he had to say when I posted, but all it did was confirm what I saw in
&gt; the broadcast.

&gt; And yes, football is a rough game. Which is why you don't go ballistic on the
&gt; other team's fans when shit happens and it results in a &quot;might miss a start&quot;
&gt; sort of injury.

&gt; But wait until you guys play the Broncos and they chop Vrabel, I'll bet you

&gt;&gt; That doesn't mean he's right.  And in fact, he wasn't.

&quot; The play wasn't over.
A split second after AD drove Olivea backwards, Hardwick tossed Wilfork
to the ground.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Look who it's posted by. A guy who came in here to congratulate us after the
&gt;&gt;&gt; game.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you say two-faced?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, using the asterisks the way he did when he wrote *Damn*, you knew
&gt;&gt;&gt; he was full of shit.

&gt;&gt; I'm about as straight as they come, stud. And just because you have a *damn*
&gt;&gt; good team doesn't mean that wasn't a *dirty* play.

&gt; That's fine, I've been reading a bunch of crap, where the posters thinks by
&gt; adding the asterisks, it diminishes the Pats accomplishments.
&gt; If that wasn't your intention, then I apologize.

&gt; Also, I think one  of the sacks on Brady, with the head slap, was just as
&gt; dirty, but in the NFL, who knows.

&gt; BTW, thanks for calling me stud!! :-)

No prob. IIRC, you were the one nice enough to let me know Belichick was fucking

No, Randall was right.  Refusing to answer an argument is not a logical

wasn't in any sort of a dangerous position, who the fuck CARES where Wilfork
was, how can you even think that's somehow germane? Olivea and Thomas were

Thomas just fucking CRANKS him backwards! That is just dirty, crappy, fucking

I believe his point was that it wasn't clear to the players on either
team that the play was over, and considering the close proximity of
the players, it is very likely the Pats player didn't see much more
than a 300 lb guy standing in front of him.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, park the &quot;ad-hominem&quot;. That's a character attack to discredit the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *argument*.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; OR, attacking an opponent's, which you chose me to be, character
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rather than answering his argument.

&gt; &gt;&gt; No, Randall was right.  Refusing to answer an argument is not a logical
&gt; &gt;&gt; fallacy.  It's simply exercising your right not to argue.  And in the case
&gt; &gt;&gt; of usenet, it's also known as having better things to do.

&gt; &gt; But he did attack me, and didn't answer my sincere question
&gt; &gt; (argument.)  Technically that qualifies under the definition I posted.

&gt; Dude, all I was doing is calling you a &quot;Dobler&quot;, it's not the worst thing in the
&gt; world (reference to commercials where he goes around w/a Bud Light, going, &quot;hey,
&gt; he says it's less filling...&quot; )

&gt; I can't talk about this play, this was a mistake. I'm an ex-lineman, this topic
&gt; just makes my joints hurt. Later.

Ok, but the reference reference to Dobler is unclear to me, in this
instance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If we're seriously going to talk about this, you have to have the broadcast

&gt;&gt;I did and I've watched the play again. As I posted earlier in this thread:

&gt;&gt;&quot; The play wasn't over.
&gt;&gt;A split second after AD drove Olivea backwards, Hardwick tossed Wilfork to the
&gt;&gt;ground.&quot;

&gt;&lt;/rant&gt;

&gt;God Dammit. I just rewound and played it again. I forgot how bad it was. Wilfork
&gt;wasn't in any sort of a dangerous position, who the fuck CARES where Wilfork
&gt;was, how can you even think that's somehow germane?

Well, like I said, because the play wasn't over? I think that makes it
germane, don't you think?

&gt; Olivea and Thomas were
&gt;stalemated for two seconds before the play rolled up Olivea's legs, Thomas is

">

Why do you leave out the fact that LT was running into the same gap that
Olivea and Thomas were engaged in? Have you never seen a defensive
player locked up with another play and using that player to plug the gap
or even cause the hit on his own player whereby his own player is
responsible for the tackle or at the very least prohibits the play-maker
from gaining extra yards?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That is just dirty, crappy, fucking
&gt;dirty football! That's a lineman's worst nightmare, getting trapped from behind

&gt;You don't think that's a dirty play, it just tells me about you. All this is
&gt;going to do is piss me off more. We're done.

This is nonsense and you probably should take a break.

Let me guess....you've never used a bluetooth device have you?
And you probably wouldn't know a wifi card if it fell on your head?
You do realize you no longer need wires to get on the internet?

As a matter I did  see the play.   Momentum still won't stop instantly
just becasue the oficials want it to.

I know more about the Bluetooth stack and associated electronics than you or
anyone else in this newsgroup, Brenda. (very probably, not that it's a big
deal.) And a 2.4GHz range RF technology reaches about from you to your
computer - usual max range is 10M. No way it reaches to the end of the bench,
let alone from the coach up to the booth as you were suggesting. Not even close
to video streaming bandwidth, either.

Or type my name into google, I'll be the first three-four hits.

Not all football players are stoopit.

The guys who really know about Bluetooth, the Motorola headsets used in the NFL,
etc, etc, live about two desks over from me. (Our company inherited the
Champaign research center when Motorola decided to shut it down a couple months
ago.) I'll guarantee *they* know more about it than anyone in here, and it's
incredibly hard to get them to shut up. Osmosis.

I don't want to talk about the play with you, I don't think you have the frame
of reference.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I only saw it live.  What's your take?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bitch deserved it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the voices of reason on the board, and you go &quot;Mr. Dude&quot; on
&gt;&gt;&gt; me. ;-)
&gt;&gt; The guy's argument was weak and honestly not worth addressing.  Yeah,
&gt;&gt; football players push each other.  And in almost every running play and pile
&gt;&gt; up there's still a great deal going on after the whistle (and I'm not even
&gt;&gt; sure in this case the push was after the whistle).  The guy needs to find
&gt;&gt; better things to whine about.  If Olivea's whining, he needs to grow a pair.
&gt;&gt; I guess LT's been getting in his ear.

&gt; As I said, I take yours as a voice of reason.  That's good enough for
&gt; me.  Thanks.

Kneeling down in front of a linebacker and begging for mercy isn't the
best strategy when you're supposed to be the lead blocker for a play.

His whining denial of responsibility is typical of the Bolts' prima donnas.

I saw it live, was a little concerned about it and carefully watched the
replays.  I think it was borderline but I'm willing to give Thomas the
benefit of the doubt that he wasn't TRYING to injury Olivea.

Hopefully it's one of those plays that Thomas looks back on and wishes he'd
done differently.
