Not very likely, I'll admit.  Idaho is both a small state and a reliably
Republican one, and Craig was never among the most famous of Senators
(until recently...).

Still:  let's assume that Colin Powell decides to run in 1996 and gets the
Republican presidential nomination.  (It may be objected that he was just
too liberal to get the nomination, but some conservatives--though mostly
&quot;national greatness&quot; conservatives of the Weekly Standard type--were
booming him, arguing that he was the only Republican who could win.  Given
his personal popularity, the &quot;electability&quot; argument, and the fact that
the vote to the right of him will be divided among several candidates,
Powelll's nomination is possible.  Moroever, one might also see an
unusually large cross-over of black voters into the Republican primaries,
especially since there is no significant challenge to Clinton among the
Democrats.)  Powell, as a Northeasterner whose liberal views on social
issues make many Republicans uneasy, feels he has to balance the ticket
with a Western conservative--yet he doesn't want one who is so well-known
or popular among conservatives that he will have an indpendent power base
as vice-president and potentially be a rival to Powell.  Craig is
sufficiently conservative, sufficiently Western, and sufficiently obscure.

Powell beats Clinton?  Conceivable, since even Dole came within eight
points--which means you just have to change the minds of four percent of
the voters.  (Although it is true that Powell might have to face a right-
wing third party.)  Anyway, once the Powell-Craig ticket is elected, the
usual (well, usual in alternate history, anyway) assassination or accident
occurs....

The problem with a Powell beats Clinton result is the electoral map. While
the popular vote was 49-41 the electoral result was 379-159, not at all
close (see http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781448.html ). Looking at
the state by state results Clinton did not have very many narrow victories
and not all of them look winnable by a Powell-Craig ticket. Will Tennesse.
48-46 Clinton, switch? Or New Mexico (49-42)?

According to http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/u/usa/pres/1996.txt the
following states went for Clinton by an eight point margin or less (which
means that a switch of four percent of the vote in each of them will carry
the states for the Republicans):  Arizona (8 electoral votes), Florida (25),
Kentucky (8), Missouri (11), Nevada (4), New Mexico (5), Ohio (21), Oregon
(7), and Tennessee (11). If the GOP carries all those states, it still falls
a little bit short, however--losing  280-258.  The GOP needs at least one
more state--maybe Pennsylvania (23), where Clinton's majority was substantial
(9.2 percent) but where there is a large African American vote which might be
attracted to Powell.

If all that isn't enough, maybe having Perot endorse Powell will do the
trick.  (I'm not saying that Perot could bring *all* his followers into the
Powell camp but probably a large percentage of them, since they are
discontented with the status quo under Clinton.)  As against that, there is
the possibility of a right-wing third party, led by someone like Pat
Buchanan, hurting the GOP and picking up some of Perot's support.  But at
least the race would IMO be much closer than Clinton-Dole in OTL.

I think it is a bit much to assume that every Dole voter will be a Powell
voter. Dole had a couple of narrow wins, particularly in the South, and
with a pro-choice black at the top of the ticket I could see enough defections
to Perot or stay at homes to give the decision to Clinton.

Oh, definitely, but I still think Powell will be a net plus.  Whether
enough of a net plus to actually win is another question.  FWIW, an exit
poll about a hypothetical Clinton-Powell-Perot race in 1996 gave the
following results:

Powell: 50 percent
Clinton: 38 percent
Perot: 9 percent
http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/02/1996_exit_poll_.html

Naturally, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about such polls of
hypothetical races, as the article notes.  But in any event it suggests
that a Powell victory was at least a *possibility.*  Also it becomes much
more likely if Perot supports him, which is at least conceivable.
According to one 1993 *Atlantic Monthly* article, unfortunately not
available online:  &quot;'I have the highest regard for General Powell,' Perot
told me not long ago. 'He'd make a fine president of anything--whether
it's a company or the country.'&quot;

&gt; --T.J.

Well...maybe not.  I mean, look at the timing.  Let's say (handwave)
Powell-Craig is elected in '96.  That takes them through the Kosovo
War (and what an interesting set of discussions *that* is going to be
in a Powell Administration...) and the bursting of the Internet Bubble
Economy.  Then the kicker:  9-11.

I can see Powell-Craig winning in '00, the recession hitting (really,
nothing was going to stop that and I'm presuming Powell ends up
renominating Greenspan anyway) and that, plus 9-11 causing a
significant problem for the Administration.  Depending on what he does
after 9-11, how America responds, things could smoothly pave the way
for the Veep getting an easy '04 win *OR* a debacle at the polls.

There's a *lot* of issues here that would need to be settled out,
going as far back as Kosovo.

1.  Does Washington press NATO to intervene in Kosovo?

Problem here is that Powell has a very clear record on this type of
thing:  all or nothing.  If you're going to get into a fight, go in
with everything and slay everything on the ground.  Remember the First
Gulf War.  I *still* get the chills when I hear him say &quot;First we're
going to cut it off and then we're going to kill it.&quot;  If--and that's
a big if--he follows that line of thinking, Kosovo could've turned
into a more conventional war, with heavy emphasis on Gulf War-styled
armoured thrusts into Serbia.  Not that the notion of bombing Belgrade
into the Stone Age wouldn't've appealed but if he were going to go in,
the *LAST* thing he would've done was telegraph that there would be no
ground campaign.  Consequently, the timetable for using ground troops
would've been significantly shorter and more organic to the decision-
making, not tacked on when NATO realised Slobo wasn't going to roll
over and play dead.

Prediction:  A quick, Gulf War-styled Kosovo War.  Air campaign
followed by ground campaign, culminating in a decisive victory which
fissures off Kosovo from Serbia.  No UNMIK in the traditional sense.
Kosovo was destined for independence in this scenario with none of the
footsie-playing we've got going on now.  Consequently, NATO's
reputation is *solidified*.  They don't look like a bunch of guys who
pulled a victory out of a disaster anymore.  The Alliance looks and
acts more robust.  No kowtowing to Paris, frex (no way Powell is going
to let Paris make targetting decisions like Clinton did).

Secondary Prediction:  Earlier disillusionment between Moscow,
Brussels and Washington.  No one really knew where Moscow was heading
in those heady days.  Things took a turn for the worse when Yeltsin
tried to make an end-run around the Alliance in the closing days of
Kosovo.  That would not have happened under Powell, who would've
warned Yeltsin off and probably would have assumed a foreign policy
closer to Bush I, treating Russia as a Little Soviet Union until they
proved themselves something different, with all that entails.  Yeltsin
might *still* try something like that, but Powell's not likely to back
down and when/if Wes Clark is faced with Russian troops heading to
Prestina...could get dicey.  But Boris isn't going to start a
conflict, so he'll back down...grumbling.  The EU sees this and
perhaps realises that maybe things haven't changed all that much back
in Moscow, especially if it's seen that Russia is clearly supporting a
genocidal Serbia and wants to undo a very successful war against
Belgrade.

2.  Washington's Reaction to AQ Before 9-11?

More robust than OTL Clinton II?  I'm not sure.  But when the USS COLE
is bombed, I can almost guarantee some kind of action.  There's going
to be none of this fiddling around, treating it like a criminal case.
That might send a serious wake-up call through the White House.  Might
there already be a low-key anti-terrorist campaign going on prior to
9-11?  Perhaps.  Delta Force?  CIA squads?  If any of the above
happens, that might change the timeline of 9-11 but I don't think
that's the case, unless one posits a really, serious change of
attitude.  Frankly, all parties seemed to be very quiescent and
dismissive about the possibility of a large-scale terror attack in the
US.

3.  9-11

Okay, what happens?  We know that in OTL, the neoconservatives
immediately leapt on the Iraqis, wanting to take out every possible
threat that could be managed, using 9-11 as a broad justification.
But they're not likely to be in positions of power on that day.  A
Powell Administration will be a technocratic one, more Bush I than
Bush II.  What happens then?  Definitely no Iraq campaign but there
might be an actually LARGER Afghanistan one.

Again, using the Gulf War and Kosovo as templates, the US is going to
attempt what unmanned the Soviets:  a full-scale, balls-to-the-wall,
land invasion.  What might also be different here is the posibility of
a NATO role.  In OTL, support was limited, though everything was on
the table.  Same situation here, although with a successful Kosovo
War, who's to say that Powell doesn't ask NATO for a more substantial
contribution, making it the second full-scale NATO war in less than a
decade?

So...going into '04, we've got NATO fully engaged in Kosovo and
Afghanistan (maybe Pakistan and Somalia as well, on the assumption
that AQ flees to the former and latter after they get hammered in
Afghanistan).  The economy?  That's the big question mark here.  Could
be in bad shape, depending on what Greenspan does, how the markets
whether the war, the price of oil...you name it.  Very, very fluid
here.

'04 might not be a push-over for Craig.

It would be an interesting question as to

would let the &quot;regulars&quot; fight a great big
&quot;conventional&quot; war.

The latter could become a fiasco; the OTL

There is one factor not considered:

Once Craig accepts the VP nomination, his
closet door is going to open.

1) He will come under _much_ greater media
scrutiny than ever before. His peculiar
behavior at the time of the Congressional
page scandal will be recalled. His old
frat brothers suspected him; the press
will be talking to them anyway.

2) He can't keep his secret from the Secret
Service; not unless he stops all cruising.
The SS won't leak the story, but they
probably will inform candidate Powell,
and they surely will inform President
Powell. Which means Craig gets dropped
from the ticket, either in '96 or '00.
'96 would be a mess, but Powell is too
responsible to risk putting someone so
vulnerable to blackmail in the VPship.
And there's the grotesque irresponsibility
of toilet cruising. Now that I think about
it, President Powell is likely to force
Craig out of office as soon as he learns
of this.

If Craig does keep the door shut long enough
to become President, then there is a really
nasty possibility out there - someone could
get dead-bang blackmail evidence on him.
The cruising shows the sort of recklessness
that could expose him to someone who burns
him with video, photos, etc. And Craig,
well, he's still desperately trying to deny
the obvious. If faced with such exposure,
what would he do to buy off the blackmailers?

Of course there is yet another possibility -
that Craig would turn down the VP nomination
rather than risk the increased scrutiny. This
may even be likely.

Last I heard, KFOR's still there and has 16,000 troops to boot...

I don't mean *militarily* engaged; simply acting as police/stabilisation

indeed be a need for a follow-on force similar (but probably more robust

an overthrowal of Milosevic's regime?  Or just a paring off of Kosovo?

That was the question I asked as well.  My thought is, having fought the
Gulf War and then replicated the pattern in the *Kosovo War, the
temptation would be there to do the same in Afghanistan and damn the New
York Times and Johnny Apple's defeatism.

And why not?  Just because the British and the Soviets couldn't handle
Afghanistan is one thing.  But a combined NATO operation?  That's a
whole 'nuther ball game, with totally different ways to fight involved,
to say nothing of motivations.  It's not a matter of imperial yearnings;
it's pure and simple revenge.  One will fight for king and country but
it's probably axiomatic that it's easier to *die* for king and country
knowing that your cause is *just*.  From America's perspective, there
couldn't've been a more clear-cut case of 'just war' than Afghanistan
since WWII.

Not necessarily the case and it presumes a misunderstanding of how
American--to say nothing of NATO--forces are trained to fight.  So-
called 'collateral damage' (I could pop the cynical bastard who came up
with that term) is inevitable but for at least the last twenty years, US
forces--and through them NATO forces--have been trained to minimise it
to the greatest extent possible.  You'd be amazed at how meticulous the
targeteering and mensuration process is.  It's not infallible but it's
far and away from the mess that existed prior to the '80s or even the
early '90s.

Besides, Afghanistan isn't suited to, say, large armoured cav incursions
save in very few areas.  Mobility would have always had to've been the
watchword in any military move there.  The difference wasn't between
&quot;Should we send in the armoured cav or should we send in the 82nd
Airborn?&quot; but &quot;How *much* of the 82nd should we send and what *other*
mobile forces should go with 'em?&quot;.  The same folks who manned the Fulda
Gap weren't going to Afghanistan.

A semi-conventional campaign which included heavily NATO input might
well have been swifter and may, just may have gotten bin Laden...or
maybe not.  Slippery li'l bugger, he is.  But in any case, with more
troops on the ground and a greater international input, pacification,
reconstruction and reconciliation could've taken a huge step forward
vice the series of interminable tiny ones that led up to where we are
now.  The end result might have been to stabilise Afghanistan quicker
though how &quot;solid&quot; this stability is is anyone's guess.

Exactly.  One man, even a couple dozen, are easy to hide in most places.

not as impossible as one might think.

Oh I haven't forgotten it...and neither has Musharraf as well.  Nor
would Powell have.  But whilst Pres. Bush had only so much leverage over
Musharraf-and, mind you, it turned out to be enough--Powell is an ex-
general, himself and knows how to talk to Ole' Pervez.  I can just
imagine him telling Musharraf in no uncertain terms what is to be
expected of Islamabad, noting that the US saved Pakistan from being
humiliated yet again as early as the Kargil War not a couple years
earlier (which reminds me, how would a Powell Administration approach
*that* little flareup?).

Besides, the Allies have a pretty good idea where Pakistan keeps its
weapons, launchers and knows precisely what Islamabad's doctrine is for
their usage.  Should everything go pear-shaped, AQ spill over into
Pakistan-proper--not just the tribal reserves--and a required incursion
is needed, the very first thing that's going to occur is a snatch n'
grab operation.  The first anyone will hear of it will be after it's all
over and the weapons are either secured or destroyed.  Pakistan is of no
threat to anyone but herself in the end.  And the US in OTL made it
perfectly clear where *anyone* stood in this war:  for or against us.
There would be no 'neutrals'.  Hence, Islamabad's cooperation.  I cannot
imagine Colin Powell doing less than that.  Quite possibly--and oddly,
considering how passive the doctrine which bears his name is--he's
liable to be even *more* bellicose on that point, simply by the virtue
of his past history as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.  Nations
*implicitly* will realise he's liable to think in military terms and
make sensible judgements from that.

And even *if* the fears of intervention directly in Pakistan run high, I
cannot imagine a more frightening scenario than AQ and rogue elements of
Pakistan's ISI getting ahold of Islamabad's nuclear weapons.  No, if
Powell thinks Islamabad's in trouble, I can see an incursion.  Everyone
might hold their breath for a while...but I can see it happening.

Which the U.S. did not. The U.S. policy
in Kosovo was the usual semi-decisive
semi-action - using force in awkward
ways, as a last resort, tolerating
paramilitary activity as much as possible,
never asserting genuine order-enforcement
power.

Such methods guarantee that the situation
will fester for years and allow warlords
and paramilitaries to become entrenched.

Quick, decisive action would IMHO avoid

&gt; &gt;Oh, definitely, but I still think Powell will be a net plus.  Whether
&gt; &gt;enough of a net plus to actually win is another question.  FWIW, an exit
&gt; &gt;poll about a hypothetical Clinton-Powell-Perot race in 1996 gave the
&gt; &gt;following results:

&gt; &gt;Powell: 50 percent
&gt; &gt;Clinton: 38 percent
&gt; &gt;Perot: 9 percent

&gt; There is one factor not considered:

&gt; Once Craig accepts the VP nomination, his
&gt; closet door is going to open.

&gt; 1) He will come under _much_ greater media
&gt;    scrutiny than ever before. His peculiar
&gt;    behavior at the time of the Congressional
&gt;    page scandal will be recalled. His old
&gt;    frat brothers suspected him; the press
&gt;    will be talking to them anyway.

&gt; 2) He can't keep his secret from the Secret
&gt;    Service; not unless he stops all cruising.
&gt;    The SS won't leak the story, but they
&gt;    probably will inform candidate Powell,
&gt;    and they surely will inform President
&gt;    Powell. Which means Craig gets dropped
&gt;    from the ticket, either in '96 or '00.
&gt;    '96 would be a mess, but Powell is too
&gt;    responsible to risk putting someone so
&gt;    vulnerable to blackmail in the VPship.
&gt;    And there's the grotesque irresponsibility
&gt;    of toilet cruising. Now that I think about
&gt;    it, President Powell is likely to force
&gt;    Craig out of office as soon as he learns
&gt;    of this.

On the other hand, it was an open secret (and possibly also true) that
Dan Quayle was a pot-head.  This did not keep him from the vice-
presidency.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If Craig does keep the door shut long enough
&gt; to become President, then there is a really
&gt; nasty possibility out there - someone could
&gt; get dead-bang blackmail evidence on him.
&gt; The cruising shows the sort of recklessness
&gt; that could expose him to someone who burns
&gt; him with video, photos, etc. And Craig,
&gt; well, he's still desperately trying to deny
&gt; the obvious. If faced with such exposure,
&gt; what would he do to buy off the blackmailers?

&gt; Of course there is yet another possibility -
&gt; that Craig would turn down the VP nomination
&gt; rather than risk the increased scrutiny. This
&gt; may even be likely.
">

Perhaps, but from what little I have seen of Craig he doesn't seem
that introspective.  An awful lot of politicians lose what little
introspection they have when a bright shiny office is dangled in front
of them.  Not that this sets them apart from the rest of us, but the
potential for damage is greater.

But that was my *point*.  I *cannot* see a Powell Administration doing
the same things the Clinton Administration did.  He's not beholden to
the same politics, the same hang-ups that Clinton was, nor does he
have the same advisors.

My point was that Powell would probably push to run a Gulf War styled
operation:  combined arms.  An air campaign followed by a ground
campaign.  He's not a McPeak-styled &quot;Air Power Can Do Everything&quot; type
so the kind of ground campaign planning that Clinton took off the
table from Day One until about a week before the war ended wouldn't
happen.  It would be more organically inclusive.

I cannot see a Kosovo War ending the way it did in OTL, with a semi-
ambiguous result (that is:  sure Kosovo isn't de facto Serbian any
more...but what exactly *is* it's legal status?  And what is to come
next for both peoples?) masquerading as a victory.  No, Powell's not
going to stick himself or his successor with something like that.  It
goes against his own doctrinal thinking.  He'd plan to go in there,
rip Kosovo out and, just perhaps, knock out Milosevic's regime to
boot.  If the man really *is* the second coming of Hitler--as some of
the rhetoric seemed to indicate at the time--then I cannot see him
being treated as anything less.  Total victory, with a Belgrade
capitulation or forcible regime change.

But even with this more robust *Kosovo War, you're still going to have
troops in the region in 2004, if only to prevent flare-ups.  Depending
on the exact details of the Serbian thumping, said troops might be
simply canaries in a coal mine, deployed along the border with Serbia-
proper...or it might scale all the way up to a Post-WWII German/
Japanese-styled occupation force in Serbia, designed to rebuild the
country from the ground-up.

*That* was my point.  No dithering, no half-measures, no policy-by-way-
of-fear-of-Vietnam-Syndrome, no subtle clashes between the White House
and the Pentagon because the Pentagon doesn't trust the President to
do what's right...*nothing* like that is likely to occur in a Powell
White House.

&gt; Naturally, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about such polls of

&gt; that a Powell victory was at least a *possibility.*  Also it becomes much

&gt; According to one 1993 *Atlantic Monthly* article, unfortunately not

I have some real doubts about the meaning of those exit survey
numbers.  There is some evidence that minority candidates suffer from
a social desirability penalty in surveys of voting intentions.  The
percentage of voters who _say_ they will vote for a minority candidate
tends to be higher than the percentage of votes that candidate then
gets in the election.  A quick Google produced a couple of citations
along these lines (Race-of-Interviewer Effects in a Preelection Poll:
Virginia 1989 Steven E. Finkel, Thomas M. Guterbock, Marian Ja. Borg
The Public Opinion Quarterly, Vol. 55, No. 3 (Autumn, 1991), pp.
313-330; When White Voters Evaluate Black Candidates: The Processing
Implications of Candidate Skin Color, Prejudice, and Self-Monitoring
Nayda Terkildsen, American Journal of Political Science, Vol. 37, No.
4 (Nov., 1993), pp. 1032-1053).

Furthermore that three-way Powell, Clinton, Perot split assumes that
the Republicans, after working on Nixon's Southern Strategy for over
20 years, would (a) run a very non-Southern Strategy candidate and (b)
that doing so wouldn't splinter the modern GOP coalition.

The latter seems unlikely, especially
if &quot;it was an open secret&quot;. Political
opponents tend to know about such
open secrets and reveal them to the
public.

And only the latter would be comparable
to Craig.

It may be a reference to Brett Kimberlin's claims to have sold marijuana
to Quayle.

&quot;In the October 7, 1996, issue of The New Yorker, in a piece that could
have run under the magazine's &quot;Department of Further Amplification&quot;
heading, Mark Singer, a staff writer since 1974, confessed that he had
allowed himself to be conned.

&quot;Specifically, he acknowledged that a 22,000-word story that he had
written shortly before the 1992 presidential election was based in large
part on what he now considers a lie.

&quot;The essence of that 1992 piece was that a drug dealer named Brett
Kimberlin had been deprived of his constitutional rights by federal prison
officials. They had prevented him from holding a press conference on the
eve of the 1988 presidential election to discuss his claims that, for a
period of time in the '70s, he had sold small amounts of marijuana to an
Indiana University law student, Dan Quayle.

&quot;True, Kimberlin was silenced by prison officials. But Singer no longer
believes that he ever sold any drugs to Quayle. 'I spent four years asking
questions about Kimberlin,' Singer says, 'and along the way I never met a
soul who could offer genuine corroboration of the fable that brought him
to my attention in the first place.'&quot;

Kimberlin's subsequent career...
