I am new to this group so greetings to all!!

Does anyone have any experience of getting an FAA Class3 Medical
while taking a low dose (Adult Male on 20 mg/day) of Adderall XR?

I am looking at going for my Pilots License but have recently started
taking Adderall XR for ADD to help with planning and focus while at
work. I am lead to believe that this is a total no-go with the FAA.
Does anyone have any positive experience here that could help?

What is the legality of coming off the drug and only flying while not
taking it for a period of say 14 day or so?

Look forward to any constructive help here!!

Thanks
Andy

If the FAA disallows the drug (I wouldn't assume that though) they
will set the period you need to show that you are ok to fly after
being off it. 6 months is a typical time frame with a Dr statement
that you have been off for 6 months and not experiencing symptoms.
However, that advise is only worth a bit more than you just paid for
it. Your first stop should be to www.aopa.org . They have a team of
people there that have extensive experience in getting FAA medicals
and can tell you exactly what you will need to do. The $40/yr you pay
for AOPA will be worth it for the advise.

Ugh....  Sadly your problem is not so much that you've taken Adderall, your
problem is that you have ADD.   You will have to prove that you don't have
ADD which is going to be uphill battle considering your diagnosis and
treatment is current.

Read this and weep:

It might be easier if you told the FAA that you are retarded, they seem to
put ADD in the same category.  The story eventually has a happy ending, but
it turned my stomach to read it.

Any advise you get here would need to be taken with a very large grain of salt.

Join AOPA, if you don't belong, and get help from their medical people.  They
know their stuff.

For first impression, I would say that you are a no go, with the drug, or
admitting you needed to take it, because both the diagnosed condition and the
drug are no go's.

From the AOPA web page.

If the applicant was not treated for ADD before age 20 but was diagnosed and
medicated after age 20, the medication would have to be discontinued for at
least three days and the psychological evaluation performed after the drugs
were discontinued.

The psychological evaluation must include at least these three tests:

1.. Trail Making Test
2.. Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
3.. Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) or Integrated Visual and
Auditory Continuous Performance Test (IVA)
If significant abnormalities are noted on these tests, a more detailed
psychiatric or psychological evaluation may be required before a final
decision can be made.

A search on Adderall.. it is a non approved drug, it matters not the level
of dosage.

As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the advice you get here is worth
little more than you pay for it, and occasionally much less.

That said, and with the added caveat that I am a lay person, I will add that
I am quite suspicious of more than one recently discovered psychological
condition.  If it was me, I would start by talking to another doctor--and if
I was eating sugar coated cereal for breakfast and then eaking Twinkies and
Cola or OrangeSoda for lunch, I would switch to a more sensible diet.

Again, all of the caveats apply.  OTOH, if you are not already doing so,
healthy diet and exercise will pay dividents in many ways.

Don't apply for the medical unless you are very very sure that you can
get it.  If you fail it would (I think) also disqualify you for Sport
Pilot, for which you would otherwise be (well, most likely) fine for
(Sport Pilot is basically &quot;are you fit to drive&quot;).

Infact, if you havn't looked into Sport Pilot (or Ultralights for that
matter) already, I suggest you do that now before getting too mired
into medical questions, because if the restrictions of Sport Pilot do
not cause you a problem then that would be the path of least
resistance.

Well a big thanks to everyone for your advice. I haven't yet decided
what to do, whether or not to come off it and see how it affects work
and if so stay off. I will join AOPA and ask their advice.

I probably won't go for Sport Pilot or Sailplanes. I used to glide in
the UK a long time back but really have no desire to spend all weekend
away from the family!! The same goes for Sport Pilot, if I can't share
it with my family then it would not hold the same appeal.

But thanks all for your time and constructive comments.

Andy
