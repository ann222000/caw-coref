I had quite an experience coming home from vacation this year, and I'd like as
many people as possible to be aware of the problem, and how to avoid it.

Briefly, the automatic front hubs on my 2000 F-250 failed, and were stuck in
locked position.  This happened once before, and the hubs were replaced (10k
miles and well over the 12-month warranty period).  This places a lot of stress
on the drive train, and in my case the CV joint (on the front axle) failed.
This caused the crank-case and transmission to literally explode, sending chunks
of metal flying all over I-80 in Wyoming.  One chunk, in fact, struck the
under-side of the pontoon boat I was towing; had the boat not been there, it
might have been somebody's windshield.

This pickup has almost always seemed to bind in turns.  I was aware that this
happens in 4wd (no positraction up front, which is normal).  I was not aware
that the hubs might be stuck, nor was I aware of the potential consequences.
Since the dealer had told me everything was OK a couple of times I complained, I
just assumed that was the way the pickup drove.  Wrong!

From the Internet searches I have done, as well as talking to some repair shops,
it appears to me that Ford's are especially bad for this.  Apparently the hubs
use some type of vacuum to disengage, and that's what people seems to fail.

What I would REALLY like to have happen is everyone with a 4wd pickup, with auto
hubs, go out and make a couple of hard turns (cranked all the way).  If there's
any binding, and it kind of jumps through the turn, you should have the hubs
checked immediately.  If you want to know what the &quot;feel&quot; is I'm trying to
describe, just put it in 4wd and try a hard turn or two.

Note that if your hubs ARE defective, a REALLY good thing to do would be to log
it on the NHTSA's web site.  You can file a complaint here:
http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq/

If enough people do that they will investigate, and potentially issue a recall.

What I did (besides &quot;invest&quot; $5,500 in a new crank-case an tranny) was to
replace the Ford hubs with Warn manual hubs.  I will never have the same issue
again -- besides, the Warn hubs are a lot cheaper.

For Ford's part, they have taken the stance that all parts are out of warranty
(which is true), so they have no financial responsibility.  I feel that NO
vehicle should EVER scatter metal on a highway (an opinion also expressed by the
NHTSA investigator I talked to), and that Ford should acknowledge that and at
least help me out.  I'm probably going to see how hard they decide to fight me
in court.

I would be VERY interested in hearing from anyone else that's had their hubs
fail to unlock (or lock, for that matter), especially if it caused additional
problems.  I created a yahoo account just to keep replies separate, and would
greatly appreciate any feedback or ideas.

Hmmm.

2004 Explorer automiatic with 4WD, 97 Mazda B4000 5-speed 4WD.

Don't use the 4WD on the Explorer very often but the B4000 4WD gets a
lot of work.  Never had a problem with hubs except that now and then
the Mazda goes &quot;zzzzzzz&quot; when the front hubs don't release -- drive
about 10 feet in reverse and they release.

Still, I'll go out and do a few hard turns in both 4WD and 2WD at slow
speed and at as high speed as I dare to see what happens.

OK, here's my feedback.  You obviously don't understand how four-wheel-drive
works.

Your transfer case (NOT crank-case) was in 4wheel drive on the interstate.
That's what destroyed it. Just locking the hubs does not mean you are in
four wheel drive, the hubs engaged and the  T case in 2wheel drive means the
front driveshaft is spinning, but just freewheeling.  This is what happens
to other makes (Jeep, GM, Dodge) which don't have front hublocks in their
four wheel drive vehicles. If the hubs fail to unlock, it doesn't really
cause all that much stress on the drivetrain.

I have had an F250 with the problems you described, but never had any
catastophic failures. Granted, the vacuum operated autolock hubs are  bad
design, but the hubs alone wouldn't have cause your transfer case to
explode. You must have been in four wheel drive on a high traction surface
on a regular basis, which you should NEVER do.

Explorer does not use the autolock hubs on the Super Duty.

What you are describing can only happen if you have the truck in 4WD High.
2003 and beyond 4WD Expeditions with those types of hubs leave the front
hubs engaged when you are in A4WD (automatic 4WD). Either you stupidly left
your truck in 4WD while driving on the highway, or something else is broken.
Just locking in the front hubs alone will not cause the sort of problem you
are describing. You still have a front differential, and if the drive shaft
from the transfer case is free-wheeling, there will be no binding - just
slightly reduced gas mileage and extra wear on the front axles. 1999 to 2002
4WD Expeditions didn't even have disconnects on the front driveshafts. The
front axles were always engaged.

You need to either realize you left the truck in 4WD on the highway, or have
the real problem diagnosed.

perfect sense, and also explains why Ford wouldn't cover it!

I see a lot of replies that are dropping the ball on this one.... SuperDuty
ESOF is a lot different from anything I  have seen discussed....

What is needed.... mileage on the truck when the failure occurred... and
miles on the truck when the last spindle service was performed.... Many
owners discount the importance of the large (and spendy) steering knuckle
seals regarding proper 4WD operation.... The operation of the auto hubs is
vastly misunderstood and, IIRC, I have posted on the subject before....

Having said that.... the failure you describe should have been accompanied
by sufficient warning that something was amiss.... at the very least, there
would have been a transient vibration.... Not necessarily a &quot;distressing&quot;
vibration but it would have been something out of the &quot;normal&quot;....

Now...... if the truck will still move, modern logic tells us we can still
drive it.... no matter how bad the concern - I'm not picking on you.... I'm
talking about too large a percent of my customer base....

By your own admission, &quot;This pickup has almost always seemed to bind in
turns.&quot;.  This is a sure sign that something is wrong. If, after your dealer
said &quot;nothing is wrong&quot; and you felt that something WAS wrong... it is time
for a second opinion....

Getting back to the hubs.... the hubs are not the weak point.... lack of
proper service IS!!! Our shop is almost exclusively centered around
SuperDuty 4X4s.... This system is virtually trouble free...... as long as
proper maintenance is performed....

Your warning should be &quot;perfgorm proper maintenacne&quot;... not &quot;this system
sucks&quot;..... After all... it worked great up until it didn't work any more ,
right?

&gt; that the hubs might be stuck, nor was I aware of the potential
&gt; consequences.
&gt; Since the dealer had told me everything was OK a couple of times I
&gt; complained, I
&gt; just assumed that was the way the pickup drove.  Wrong!

&gt; From the Internet searches I have done, as well as talking to some repair
&gt; shops,
&gt; it appears to me that Ford's are especially bad for this.  Apparently the
&gt; hubs
&gt; use some type of vacuum to disengage, and that's what people seems to
&gt; fail.

&gt; What I would REALLY like to have happen is everyone with a 4wd pickup,
&gt; with auto
&gt; hubs, go out and make a couple of hard turns (cranked all the way).  If
&gt; there's
&gt; any binding, and it kind of jumps through the turn, you should have the
&gt; hubs
&gt; checked immediately.  If you want to know what the &quot;feel&quot; is I'm trying to
&gt; describe, just put it in 4wd and try a hard turn or two.

&gt; Note that if your hubs ARE defective, a REALLY good thing to do would be
&gt; to log
&gt; it on the NHTSA's web site.  You can file a complaint here:
&gt; http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq/

&gt; If enough people do that they will investigate, and potentially issue a
&gt; recall.

&gt; What I did (besides &quot;invest&quot; $5,500 in a new crank-case an tranny) was to
&gt; replace the Ford hubs with Warn manual hubs.  I will never have the same
&gt; issue
&gt; again -- besides, the Warn hubs are a lot cheaper.

&gt; For Ford's part, they have taken the stance that all parts are out of
&gt; warranty
&gt; (which is true), so they have no financial responsibility.  I feel that NO
&gt; vehicle should EVER scatter metal on a highway (an opinion also expressed
&gt; by the
&gt; NHTSA investigator I talked to), and that Ford should acknowledge that and
&gt; at
&gt; least help me out.  I'm probably going to see how hard they decide to
&gt; fight me
&gt; in court.

&gt; I would be VERY interested in hearing from anyone else that's had their
&gt; hubs
&gt; fail to unlock (or lock, for that matter), especially if it caused
&gt; additional
&gt; problems.  I created a yahoo account just to keep replies separate, and

F150's didn't have the same hubs as Superduty, but I would agree with you in
general, autolock hubs are pretty unreliable.

&gt;&gt; OK, here's my feedback.  You obviously don't understand how
&gt;&gt; four-wheel-drive works.

&gt;&gt; Your transfer case (NOT crank-case) was in 4wheel drive on the
&gt;&gt; interstate. That's what destroyed it. Just locking the hubs does not mean
&gt;&gt; you are in four wheel drive, the hubs engaged and the  T case in 2wheel
&gt;&gt; drive means the front driveshaft is spinning, but just freewheeling.
&gt;&gt; This is what happens to other makes (Jeep, GM, Dodge) which don't have
&gt;&gt; front hublocks in their four wheel drive vehicles. If the hubs fail to
&gt;&gt; unlock, it doesn't really cause all that much stress on the drivetrain.

&gt;&gt;  I have had an F250 with the problems you described, but never had any
&gt;&gt; catastophic failures. Granted, the vacuum operated autolock hubs are  bad
&gt;&gt; design, but the hubs alone wouldn't have cause your transfer case to
&gt;&gt; explode. You must have been in four wheel drive on a high traction
&gt;&gt; surface on a regular basis, which you should NEVER do.

&gt; Yes those auto hubs were pretty unreliable on my 95 f150 4x4.  i replaced
&gt; with warn manuals

The vacuum operated hublocks on Super Dutys are prone to early failure, I
would submit that most owners don't ever touch them so they wouldn't know if
they work or not. On my '02 F250, I had two hubs locks (both from driver's
side) replaced under warranty due to failure to properly engage/disengage.
The first one happened at under 20,000 miles, the second under 30,000. After
warranty expired, they failed again at 45,000 miles and I had them replaced
with Warn manuals. My current Excursion has had no problems yet, however.

&gt; What is needed.... mileage on the truck when the failure occurred... and

&gt; Having said that.... the failure you describe should have been accompanied

&gt;&gt;I had quite an experience coming home from vacation this year, and I'd
&gt;&gt;like as
&gt;&gt; many people as possible to be aware of the problem, and how to avoid it.

&gt;&gt; Briefly, the automatic front hubs on my 2000 F-250 failed, and were stuck
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; locked position.  This happened once before, and the hubs were replaced
&gt;&gt; (10k
&gt;&gt; miles and well over the 12-month warranty period).  This places a lot of
&gt;&gt; stress
&gt;&gt; on the drive train, and in my case the CV joint (on the front axle)
&gt;&gt; failed.
&gt;&gt; This caused the crank-case and transmission to literally explode, sending
&gt;&gt; chunks
&gt;&gt; of metal flying all over I-80 in Wyoming.  One chunk, in fact, struck the
&gt;&gt; under-side of the pontoon boat I was towing; had the boat not been there,
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; might have been somebody's windshield.

&gt;&gt; This pickup has almost always seemed to bind in turns.  I was aware that

I don't really understand the sequence of events here.  Where exactly was
this joint that failed?  If you were driving with one hub locked in, or two,

I have to assume that when you said crank case you really meant the transfer
case.  It's not easy to break that piece except maybe through failure of the

they broke.  At least I don't see how.

I know the system is not the same as an F150, - however, I can't see where
having the hubs engaged should cause binding if the transfer case is in the
2WD position.

Here is what I think I understand -

A 2000 SuperDuty offered two 4WD systems - a manual system and an electric
shift system. The manual systme has manual locking hubs and requires the
transfer case to be manually shifted to 4WD. As long as the transfer case is
not in 4WD, there should be no binding even if the hubs are locked. The
electric shift system electricaly engages the transfer case. The hubs can
either be in an automatic mode or a manual mode. If you leave the hubs in
the automatic mode, then they are controlled  automatically (using vaccum).
When you shift the switch on the dash to 4WD the hubs and transfer case are
engaged. You can also manually lock the hubs. Either way, unless the
transfer case is also shifted to 4WD, there should be no binding.

Do you agree?

All true, Ed. The OP had his T case in 4wd, whether by ignorance or by truck
malfunction. He may have thought it would be safer in the rain. I knew a
woman who put her Jeep Cherokee in part time 4wd whenever it rained, she
wondered why her front U joints broke...I told her she was lucky it was only
that...

">

As far as I know, the vacuum is used to engage the hubs, the hubs are spring
loaded to unlock. In any case, by your description, you hubs have been
locked for a very long time. The failure mode is more often that the hubs do
not lock when asked, your experience is opposite that of most people with
problems in this area.

The result of your problem, exploding transfer case, is what I would expect
though. (Your transfer case exploded, by the way, not the crank case.)
Having said that, having the front hubs locked in 2WD would not harm the
transfer case, transmission, or crank case.Lots of 4WD systems don't even
have hub locks anymore, the front hubs are always locked and the 4WD system
is engaged and disengaged solely by the selection of the transfer case. If
the transfer case is not selected, the front tires merely turn the front
drive shaft, but the front drive shaft is not connected to anything inside
the t-case, therefore no damage is done. If your truck was being operated
unknowingly in 4WD on pavement, then the tcase would explode. But, having
the front hubs locked would not be an issue if the truck was really set to
2WD. (I've been operating my Jeep with the front hubs locked, and the tcase
set to 2WD, for going on ten years, and there is no damage or ill effect of
any kind.)

Your complaint that there has been noticable binding in turns (I assume
parking lot manuvers and the like) is a sign that your truck was in 4WD. The
front and rear tires on your truck will travel different lines when making a
turn in a parking lot (they travel different lines in any turn, but you will
feel this in a parking lot more than on the road), and the binding you feel
is the front tires scrubbing on the ground to release the stresses of the
turn.

The differentials accomodate the different arcs that the left and right
tires travel in any turn, but the transfer case has no capacity to
accomodate the different tracks of the front and rear tires. The result is
that the transfer case gets stressed severely when the truck makes a tight
turn on pavement. If the same turn was made on dirt or gravel, the front
tires would slip on the ground and release the stresses, and you would not
feel the binding that you felt on the pavement.

Your truck is equipped with Part Time 4WD, this means it is intended to be
used part time only, it should not ever be used where there is sufficient
traction (dry pavement) to hold the tires from slipping on the ground. You
ought not even drive you truck in 4WD in the rain, and unless snow and/or
ice is covering the roadway where you are driving, you should not use 4WD at
all when driving on the street.

&gt;&gt; again -- besides, the Warn hubs are a lot cheaper.

&gt; Hmmm.

&gt; 2004 Explorer automiatic with 4WD, 97 Mazda B4000 5-speed 4WD.

&gt; Don't use the 4WD on the Explorer very often but the B4000 4WD gets a
&gt; lot of work.  Never had a problem with hubs except that now and then
&gt; the Mazda goes &quot;zzzzzzz&quot; when the front hubs don't release -- drive
&gt; about 10 feet in reverse and they release.

&gt; Still, I'll go out and do a few hard turns in both 4WD and 2WD at slow
&gt; speed and at as high speed as I dare to see what happens.

IKf you perform this test in 4WD on dry pavement, you should expect to feel
binding and a wobble in the steering wheel. This is perfectly normal, and it
is your sign that the 4WD system is not happy with the crap that you are
making it do.

&gt;OK, here's my feedback.  You obviously don't understand how four-wheel-drive
&gt;works.

&gt;Your transfer case (NOT crank-case) was in 4wheel drive on the interstate.
&gt;That's what destroyed it. Just locking the hubs does not mean you are in
&gt;four wheel drive, the hubs engaged and the  T case in 2wheel drive means the
&gt;front driveshaft is spinning, but just freewheeling.  This is what happens
&gt;to other makes (Jeep, GM, Dodge) which don't have front hublocks in their
&gt;four wheel drive vehicles. If the hubs fail to unlock, it doesn't really
&gt;cause all that much stress on the drivetrain.

&gt; I have had an F250 with the problems you described, but never had any
&gt;catastophic failures. Granted, the vacuum operated autolock hubs are  bad
&gt;design, but the hubs alone wouldn't have cause your transfer case to
&gt;explode. You must have been in four wheel drive on a high traction surface
&gt;on a regular basis, which you should NEVER do.

Everything falling to pieces appears to be rare.  I definitely did not have the
pickup in 4wd, and the only time I ever have driven it in 4wd on dry pavement is
when pulling boat from the water, and I'm good enough backing I don't make any
hard turns.

According to the guy that repaired my vehicle, as well as a Ford mechanic I
talked to, driving that pickup over 45mph with hubs locked is a big no-no, and
does cause a lot of stress.  The owners manual stresses no 4wd over 45mph, but
didn't say anything about hubs locked.

Thanks for the info, Jim.

I've hit every regular maintenance point with the vehicle, so if maintenance was
missed then Ford dropped the ball.  Not an impossibility.

There was a vibration, but only a few seconds before things fell apart.  The
vibration was followed by a whine (&quot;oops&quot;, foot of gas, looking to get off
road), followed by the chaos of everything going to pieces.

The truck had 51k, and front hubs were replaced about 43k.  Spindle should have
been taken care of at the same time.

Who knows what else might have been going on in the transmission, crank-case,
etc. that could have contributed.  The CV joint had obviously blown, which was
the start of the chain reaction.

&gt;&gt;I had quite an experience coming home from vacation this year, and I'd like
&gt;&gt;as
&gt;&gt; many people as possible to be aware of the problem, and how to avoid it.

&gt;&gt; Briefly, the automatic front hubs on my 2000 F-250 failed, and were stuck
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; locked position.  This happened once before, and the hubs were replaced
&gt;&gt; (10k
&gt;&gt; miles and well over the 12-month warranty period).  This places a lot of
&gt;&gt; stress
&gt;&gt; on the drive train, and in my case the CV joint (on the front axle)
&gt;&gt; failed.
&gt;&gt; This caused the crank-case and transmission to literally explode, sending
&gt;&gt; chunks
&gt;&gt; of metal flying all over I-80 in Wyoming.  One chunk, in fact, struck the
&gt;&gt; under-side of the pontoon boat I was towing; had the boat not been there,
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; might have been somebody's windshield.

&gt;&gt; This pickup has almost always seemed to bind in turns.  I was aware that
&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; happens in 4wd (no positraction up front, which is normal).  I was not
&gt;&gt; aware
&gt;&gt; that the hubs might be stuck, nor was I aware of the potential
&gt;&gt; consequences.
&gt;&gt; Since the dealer had told me everything was OK a couple of times I
&gt;&gt; complained, I

The act of shifting in and out of 4wd definitely was engaging/disengaging the
front transfer case.  Every time I've spun back wheels on a slick boat ramp,
shifting to 4wd pulls it right out.  There's also 4wd roads I would have been
able to drive in 2wd.  Yet with the hubs set to &quot;automatic&quot;, they still were
binding in turns (although not as much as the few times I made turns in 4wd).

This is kind of what led me to believe a little binding in hard turns was
normal.  I could definitely see the difference between dialing 4wd and 2wd, and
not really understanding at the time the way the hubs worked ...

&gt;I know the system is not the same as an F150, - however, I can't see where
&gt;having the hubs engaged should cause binding if the transfer case is in the
&gt;2WD position.

&gt;Here is what I think I understand -

&gt;A 2000 SuperDuty offered two 4WD systems - a manual system and an electric
&gt;shift system. The manual systme has manual locking hubs and requires the
&gt;transfer case to be manually shifted to 4WD. As long as the transfer case is
&gt;not in 4WD, there should be no binding even if the hubs are locked. The
&gt;electric shift system electricaly engages the transfer case. The hubs can
&gt;either be in an automatic mode or a manual mode. If you leave the hubs in
&gt;the automatic mode, then they are controlled  automatically (using vaccum).
&gt;When you shift the switch on the dash to 4WD the hubs and transfer case are
&gt;engaged. You can also manually lock the hubs. Either way, unless the
&gt;transfer case is also shifted to 4WD, there should be no binding.

&gt;Do you agree?

Let me repeat: LOCKED HUBS DO NOT EQUAL 4WD. Unless your transfer case was
in 4wd as well,  there is NO WAY locked hubs could have destroyed your
transfer case. Your transfer case was either in 4wd, or malfunctioning, or
it disintegrated for another reason, but I can guarantee you it had NOTHING
to do with locked hubs.

Driving with locked hubs with the transfer case in 2wd is PERFECTLY
ACCEPTABLE at any speed. The 4wd systems made by Jeep, Chevrolet, &amp; Dodge
work this way because they are not equipped with selectable hubs. The front
drivetrain spins all the time, freewheeling in 2wd, engaged in 4wd.

I drove around with my F250's auto hubs engaged for a week before I was able
to take it in to be fixed. No problems. As long as the transfer case was not
in 4wd, I was OK.

You seem to be under the impression that having hubs locked means you are in
four wheel drive. This is not the case. Either you misunderstood what your
mechanics told you, or they don't know what they are talking about. When I
brought my truck in the first time, even the service guy was clueless...he
thought I was in 4wd simply because my hubs were locked.

Driving with one hub locked and one unlocked isn't a good idea, but that
wouldn't hurt your T-case either.

How do you know that's where it started? If the CV shaft blew, it would

Just to make it clear, the CV joint that failed is on the front drive axle,
between two U-joints.  There's supposed to be something like a little ball
inside the CV joint, which was gone (only a little piece left).

This resulted in severe vibration in the crank-case (attached to the front of
the transmission), which caused it to fly apart.  This resulted in the automatic
transmission being destroyed.  Apparently this all happened within a few
minutes, as about 20 miles earlier when I was driving the pickup there was no
vibration, nothing abnormal.  My son was actually driving when everything fell
apart.

It was not in 4wd, as that causes REALLY bad binding when turning on dry
pavement, and both my son and I are totally aware of what that feels like.  The
binding I've noticed all these years, when in 2wd, is very slight, and only when
cranked all the way left or right.  With the Warn manual hubs, as well as when
the last set of auto hubs was brand new, there's absolutely no binding in a hard
turn.  I don't really recall if it did that brand new, but I don't think it did.

Maybe mine experience is unusual.  Certainly spewing pieces all over the highway
is.  It still wouldn't hurt for anyone with auto hubs to make a couple of hard
turns in 2wd and make sure they're not binding.  If they are, then it should be
checked, no?

Not so. The crankcase is where the oil lives when the truck is parked, and

&gt; What
&gt; exploaded was what I thought was the crank-case (at the back of the front
&gt; axle).

Both the front and rear axles are connected to the transfer case via the
respective drive shafts.

&gt;&gt;Having said that, having the front hubs locked in 2WD would not harm the
&gt;&gt;transfer case, transmission, or crank case.Lots of 4WD systems don't even
&gt;&gt;have hub locks anymore, the front hubs are always locked and the 4WD
&gt;&gt;system
&gt;&gt;is engaged and disengaged solely by the selection of the transfer case.

&gt; This is contrary to what the Ford mechanic told me.  He said driving over
&gt; 45mph
&gt; with hubs locked, either set to lock or due to failure, would cause stress
&gt; on
&gt; the drive train, at least on my 2000 pickup.  It's possible he's wrong,
&gt; though.

I have to think you've gotten some terms confused. The t-case can only
explode if it is engaged on the highway. Period. The front axle can be
locked while the tcase in in 2WD, and no damage will result.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Your truck is equipped with Part Time 4WD, this means it is intended to be
&gt;&gt;used part time only, it should not ever be used where there is sufficient
&gt;&gt;traction (dry pavement) to hold the tires from slipping on the ground. You
&gt;&gt;ought not even drive you truck in 4WD in the rain, and unless snow and/or
&gt;&gt;ice is covering the roadway where you are driving, you should not use 4WD
&gt;&gt;at
&gt;&gt;all when driving on the street.

&gt; Many replies I've read have said I must have been in 4wd, but I have no
&gt; doubt it
&gt; was set to 2wd.  I'm pretty near certain that part wasn't broke, as the
&gt; binding
&gt; that occurs in 4wd is much more severe than what I'd noticed with hubs
&gt; locked.
">

You _think_ it was set there, and there is a chance that you set it there,
but in actuality, it was operating in 4WD when it blew. The front axle will
not blow a transfer case set to operate in 2HI. I do not know how confusing
the system may or may not be, my '95 Bronco had a similar system. You are
suggesting that you selected 2HI, and if so, the transfer case did not
respond to your selection. This does not change very much, you still have a
t-case spread across central Colorado, but it narrows the problem set a bit.

I am not prepared to engage in what you did right or wrong, but all that I
know about 4WD systems, front hubs being locked in and of themselves can not
cause the transfer case troubles you have reported. Your particular problem
set can only come about if the transfer case was physically set to 4WD while
on the highway, and this had to be the case for a very long time.

My Jeep ('81 CJ5) has Detroit lockers on both the front and rear axles. I
once (when I first bought it) pulled out of the dirt and onto the highway
without selecting 2HI. With the variance is tire diameters on all 4 corners,
as I approached 45ish MPH, my Jeep started to swerve all over the road. The
cause of this was that the front and rear and the left and right were all
going different speeds, and the traction on the roadway was fed back through
the tires to the steering wheel.

Your tcase did not explode because the front hubs were locked, it exploded
because it was operating in 4WD. If you intended it to be in 4WD, you made a
serious mistake. If you thought it was actually in 2WD, then your truck lied
to you for a very long time.

Hmmmm.  Okay.  I'm not sure what that means or doesn't mean.  I'm NOT
an expert on 4WD.

This is what I have always done:
-- Don't use 4WD on hard-surface roads, or on dirt or gravel roads
where the vehicle is humming right along in 2WD.
-- Use 4WD ONLY when the vehicle is spinning the wheels or not pulling
in 2WD.  As long as 2WD is moving me along, I stick with it.
-- Every so often -- about every six weeks or so -- I get onto a
rough, uneven surface -- I use a nearby road with loose gravel and a
steep uphill grade -- and go into 4WD for a short distance to keep the
hubs, etc., lubricated.

My Explorer has three buttons on the dash -- 4AUTO (normal), 4WD LO,
4WD HI.  My understanding is that in 4WD AUTO it will drop into 4WD or
AWD automatically when the rear tire(s) lose traction then shift out
when it's not needed.

With the Explorer in 4WD HI or LO (which I did a good bit getting
around after Hurricane Katrina) the steering was &quot;different&quot; -- not
difficult or anything but steering took a bit more effort that usual.

In my Mazda B4000, when it's in 4WD LO or HI, the steering is MUCH
different, especially in a somewhat sharp turn.  Is this normal?

Thanks.

&gt; &gt;I had quite an experience coming home from vacation this year, and I'd like
&gt; &gt;as
&gt; &gt; many people as possible to be aware of the problem, and how to avoid it.

&gt; &gt; Briefly, the automatic front hubs on my 2000 F-250 failed, and were stuck
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; locked position.  This happened once before, and the hubs were replaced
&gt; &gt; (10k
&gt; &gt; miles and well over the 12-month warranty period).  This places a lot of
&gt; &gt; stress
&gt; &gt; on the drive train, and in my case the CV joint (on the front axle)
&gt; &gt; failed.
&gt; &gt; This caused the crank-case and transmission to literally explode, sending
&gt; &gt; chunks
&gt; &gt; of metal flying all over I-80 in Wyoming.  One chunk, in fact, struck the
&gt; &gt; under-side of the pontoon boat I was towing; had the boat not been there,
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; might have been somebody's windshield.

&gt; &gt; This pickup has almost always seemed to bind in turns.  I was aware that
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; happens in 4wd (no positraction up front, which is normal).  I was not
&gt; &gt; aware
&gt; &gt; that the hubs might be stuck, nor was I aware of the potential
&gt; &gt; consequences.
&gt; &gt; Since the dealer had told me everything was OK a couple of times I
&gt; &gt; complained, I
&gt; &gt; just assumed that was the way the pickup drove.  Wrong!

&gt; &gt; From the Internet searches I have done, as well as talking to some repair
&gt; &gt; shops,
&gt; &gt; it appears to me that Ford's are especially bad for this.  Apparently the
&gt; &gt; hubs
&gt; &gt; use some type of vacuum to disengage, and that's what people seems to
&gt; &gt; fail.

&gt; &gt; What I would REALLY like to have happen is everyone with a 4wd pickup,
&gt; &gt; with auto
&gt; &gt; hubs, go out and make a couple of hard turns (cranked all the way).  If
&gt; &gt; there's
&gt; &gt; any binding, and it kind of jumps through the turn, you should have the
&gt; &gt; hubs
&gt; &gt; checked immediately.  If you want to know what the &quot;feel&quot; is I'm trying to
&gt; &gt; describe, just put it in 4wd and try a hard turn or two.

&gt; &gt; Note that if your hubs ARE defective, a REALLY good thing to do would be
&gt; &gt; to log
&gt; &gt; it on the NHTSA's web site.  You can file a complaint here:
&gt; &gt; http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq/

&gt; &gt; If enough people do that they will investigate, and potentially issue a
&gt; &gt; recall.

&gt; &gt; What I did (besides &quot;invest&quot; $5,500 in a new crank-case an tranny) was to
&gt; &gt; replace the Ford hubs with Warn manual hubs.  I will never have the same
&gt; &gt; issue
&gt; &gt; again -- besides, the Warn hubs are a lot cheaper.

&gt; &gt; For Ford's part, they have taken the stance that all parts are out of
&gt; &gt; warranty
&gt; &gt; (which is true), so they have no financial responsibility.  I feel that NO
&gt; &gt; vehicle should EVER scatter metal on a highway (an opinion also expressed
&gt; &gt; by the
&gt; &gt; NHTSA investigator I talked to), and that Ford should acknowledge that and
&gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; least help me out.  I'm probably going to see how hard they decide to
&gt; &gt; fight me
&gt; &gt; in court.

&gt; &gt; I would be VERY interested in hearing from anyone else that's had their

I have a 2004 Explorer with automatic 4WD and selector buttons on the
dash for 4WD HI and 4WD LO;  Also have a 97 Mazda B4000, 5-speed with
dash mounted selector switch -- 2WD, 4WD HI, 4WD LO.

Do I need to lubricate the front hubs as part of a normal service??

I do not run either of these vehicles off the road.  Every six weeks
or so I do take each of them out onto a rough local road with loose
gravel and a steep up-grade, shift into 4WD HI and LO  which I think
is supposed to keep the hubs lubricated.  During hunting season the
Mazda takes a lot of trips on bad roads where I use 4WD HI and LO as
needed.

Thanks.

&gt; &gt; 2004 Explorer automiatic with 4WD, 97 Mazda B4000 5-speed 4WD.

&gt; &gt; Don't use the 4WD on the Explorer very often but the B4000 4WD gets a
&gt; &gt; lot of work.  Never had a problem with hubs except that now and then
&gt; &gt; the Mazda goes &quot;zzzzzzz&quot; when the front hubs don't release -- drive
&gt; &gt; about 10 feet in reverse and they release.

&gt; &gt; Still, I'll go out and do a few hard turns in both 4WD and 2WD at slow
&gt; &gt; speed and at as high speed as I dare to see what happens.

&gt; IKf you perform this test in 4WD on dry pavement, you should expect to feel
&gt; binding and a wobble in the steering wheel. This is perfectly normal, and it
&gt; is your sign that the 4WD system is not happy with the crap that you are

I put the Mazda into 4WD HI on dry pavement, drove slowly about 20

Super Dutys with electronic shift on the fly 4wd have autolocking hub locks
which are supposed to spin free when the vehicle is in 2wd, but have a
provision for manually locking in case of hub lock malfunction. Dial on the
dash says &quot;2Hi, 4Hi, 4Lo. Standard shift 4wd have manual locking hublocks
that have selectable dials. Transfer case lever positions are 2Hi, 4Hi, N,
4Lo.

Explorers don't have any kind of hublocks, the front drivetrain is engaged
but freewheeling when in 2Hi.

&gt; Your transfer case (NOT crank-case) was in 4wheel drive on the interstate.
&gt; That's what destroyed it. Just locking the hubs does not mean you are in
&gt; four wheel drive, the hubs engaged and the  T case in 2wheel drive means
&gt; the front driveshaft is spinning, but just freewheeling.  This is what
&gt; happens to other makes (Jeep, GM, Dodge) which don't have front hublocks
&gt; in their four wheel drive vehicles. If the hubs fail to unlock, it doesn't
&gt; really cause all that much stress on the drivetrain.

&gt; I have had an F250 with the problems you described, but never had any
&gt; catastophic failures. Granted, the vacuum operated autolock hubs are  bad
&gt; design, but the hubs alone wouldn't have cause your transfer case to
&gt; explode. You must have been in four wheel drive on a high traction surface
&gt; on a regular basis, which you should NEVER do.

The way he described the damage, it sounded like he was in 4wd. But his
story changes w/ every post, first his transfer case grenaded, then it was
his driveshaft that let go and beat up his transmission.  Finally he tells
us the CV joint on the driveshaft was actually what failed, so his damage
was not due to the locked hubs, but to a bad driveshaft joint. And he tell
us 2 mechanics told him you should not drive with the hubs locked over
45mph, which is a crock...the hubs can be locked as long as you are in 2wd.
If you need 4wd, road conditions are too bad for you to go over 45mph
anyway. Granted, if the hubs were unlocked it wouldn't have mattered, but he
had a bad driveshaft joint as well, and the hublocks didn't cause the
problem with the driveshaft joint.

Me thinks that is a BS story full of holes.  For one, even if you did not
back up properly to  disengage the autophubs, the only result would be the
axles and front shaft would be turning and at the same speed as if they were
engaged and being driven.

&gt; This pickup has almost always seemed to bind in turns.  I was aware that

&gt; If enough people do that they will investigate, and potentially issue a

&gt; What I did (besides &quot;invest&quot; $5,500 in a new crank-case an tranny) was to
&gt; replace the Ford hubs with Warn manual hubs.  I will never have the same
&gt; issue
&gt; again -- besides, the Warn hubs are a lot cheaper.

&gt; For Ford's part, they have taken the stance that all parts are out of

I still think he had just pulled the pontoon boat out of the water and had
4wd engaged from the loading ramp. Maybe he flipped the switch on the dash
to 2wd, but the mechanical tension alone on the transfer case from the
automatic transmission could have kept it engaged.

That's not what happened to the OP. Also, I mentioned this scenario in a
previous post as &quot;not a good idea.&quot; And that's why when the left hublock on
my own F250 failed to disengage, I manually locked BOTH of them so as to
keep the center diff spider gears from overspeeding, until I brought it in
to be fixed, which was PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE at any legal speed.

If, for some reason, the front hubs are locked in, sharp turns will cause
the U-joints to bind as the axles rotate.... The single cardan U-joint has a
very small range of &quot;stable&quot; motion (about 3 degrees deflection). If the
joint is positioned so that it has a large deflection, a whipping motion can
set in - the physics of this whipping motion are easy to understand...
describing it, not so easy. Simply stated - the cup on the inside of the
deflection travels less distance than the cup on the outside of the
deflection.... the bug-a-boo being that they are both travelling at the same
rpm...

Our shop deals almost exclusively with SuperDuty 4WDs... our area is the
Great Arboreal Forest that spans much of the mid-north in Canada... Oilfield
and logging are our prime industries and a properly maintained front driving
axle on one of these trucks is dependable... (&quot;maintain&quot; and &quot;repair&quot; are
NOT interchangeable terms).

Lets take a look at how this system operates....

When we set the switch on the dash from 2HI to 4HI.... a series of events
occurs.... The module that controls the 4WD system (since 99, this task has
been assigned to various modules including the GEM, later a stans alone
module and currently, that function *may* be in the SJB (smart junction box)
though I would have to check to be sure) would command the appropriate
transfer case relay to turn the shift motor. When the shift motor indicates
proper positioning for the switch position selection, the module assumes
that the transfer case is working properly and that the front driveline has
been brought to speed... The appropriate 4WD indicator(s) on the dash will
illuminate....

After this happens (and only after this), the module will command the PVH
solenoid (pulsed vacuum hub).... to lock the hubs, this will be about a 12
inch vacuum signal that lasts for about 30 seconds (memory thing as far as
time allotment). Once the time is up, this vacuum signal is vented to
atmosphere... it is NOT a continuous application of vacuum.... These hubs
operate something like a click type ballpoint pen. Click it once, the point
is out... click it again, the point retracts....

To UNLOCK the hubs, the module will command about 6 inches of vacuum to the
hubs... again, after about 30 seconds, this vacuum signal is vented to
atmosphere. The hubs will not unlock until the vacuum is vented. While the
owners manual no longer states it, it is still a very good plan to wait a
bit after disengaging 4WD and back up a few feet to remove any driveline
bind that may &quot;trap&quot; a hub in the engaged position.

Now... 6 inches of vacuum is NOT a very strong signal in anyones book.... If
there is a leak in any portion of this vacuum system, the hubs will not have
enough vacuum applied for them to operate properly. A trip to motorcraft.com
and a looking up the recommended service interval for these trucks indicates
that the spindle bearings should be service regularly.... at the same time
as this service the large steering knuckle should be replaced, the O-ring
around the wheel bearing should be replaced and it's a good idea to replace
the axle tube dust seal at the same time.  conscientious tech will ensure
that the bore in the steering knuckle is clean and free of rust at this
time....

So - what else can go wrong if the hubs don't work properly.... Too many
owners don't pay enough attention to some of the little clues their autos
are trying to give them (the guy that's been driving with the CEL on for two
years might be one - the guy that's had an odd vibration for a long time but
it hasn't really &quot;bothered&quot; him yet might be another)... until the concern
decides that it is time for someone to sit up and take notice....

At the transfer case end of the driveshaft to the front axle, there is a
double cardan U-joint. This U-joint utilizes a &quot;centering ball&quot; to keep
things properly aligned. If the vacuum system is properly maintained, any
time the truck is in 2WD, this shaft is only ever &quot;along for the ride&quot;. If
the hubs are left engaged for long periods of time without 4WD being
selected, not only is the centering ball experiencing constant deflection,
but the driveshaft spends much of it's time &quot;whipping&quot;. Once the centering
ball starts to deteriorate, it can self destruct in short order. And the
resulting forces can cause the transfer case to virtually explode -
something we do see on occasion - checking service history always shows that
proper servicing has been neglected....

Have we seen rare failures? You bet - nothing is fool proof.... But, with
proper scheduled maintenance, the SuperDuty ESOF is strong, reliable and
trouble free...

Yours is quite a different system... It uses FWD style CV joints at the
knuckles and the front diff - double offset at the knuckle and tripot at the
diff (the reason is the tripots can &quot;plunge&quot; while double offsets cannot).

Add that the intended use of the SuperDuty and your cars is very different
as well....

As long as the CV boots are inspected regularly for deterioration or
perforation, you should get many happy miles from your cars....

If the centering ball is defective, there would be failure, but as long as
it is maintained properly, it is OK to run it this way. This is how Jeep
Wranglers, Cherokees, and older Grand Cherokees have been designed for
years, without any way to disconnect the front hubs. In my experience, the
centering ball would not fail without ample prior warning...squeaking,
vibration...etc, unless defective.

yes, it &quot;should&quot; give ample warning... but this has to be heeded to mean
anything.... I have absolutely no experience with any sort of Jeep so I

As far as anything else is concerned... I am speaking from my own, personal

driveshafts, the centering ball can and has failed on the SuperDuty front
driveshaft.... no amount of discussion can alter that fact....

I respectfully offer that I have worked in the automotive trades for nearly

dealer) for five years and I am currently shop foreman. Most of what we sell

I think I agree with some other posters who suggested that you were in 4WD.
That makes a lot more sense than your explanation.  I don't think the hubs
were at fault.

The problem with your explanation is that you made it up.  After your
tranfer case broke open, you surveyed this pile of parts and then made up a
series of events to explain it.  Right? You need to think about this.  If
you know what failed first, you should certainly say so, but I so no reason
to assume that you actually know what the root failure is.

Then it stands to reason the failed centering balls are defective, perhaps
not receiving enough lube upon assembly. Jeep CV joints are of the same
design and don't need hublocks to idle the driveshaft in 2wd, but yes, there
have been rare failures in that case as well. And it is possible to re-lube
them, it means disassembly of the joint, of course.

What's your take on the OP saying two mechanics (one at a Ford dealer) said
that you can't go more than 45mph if the hubs are locked?

Thanks.  I'll keep an eye on the CV boots.  And -- I assume if I find
one ripped or about to rip I pull the CV joint, clean it, re-grease
it, and put on a new boot -- just like on my old swing-axle VW Beetles.

&gt; Just to make it clear, the CV joint that failed is on the front drive
&gt; axle,
&gt; between two U-joints.  There's supposed to be something like a little ball
&gt; inside the CV joint, which was gone (only a little piece left).

Let me clarify something here, Rob.  Think hard about this.

When modern-style 4 wheel drive vehicles first came out, they didn't have
locking hubs.  Jeeps didn't have that in WWII.  Pickup trucks didn't have it
in late 50's, the 60's and some of the 70's.  Do you know what they had?
Just a solid connection. You were expected to drive the vehicle 100,000
miles, or whatever it took to wear it out, with the hubs locked in and the
front drivetrain rotating the whole way.

Do you know what this damaged?  Nothing.  Just like the rear drivetrain
rotating doesn't hurt anything.  So whatever your situation was, the hubs
have nothing to do with it.

It is true that when a u-joint breaks, you can drop one end of a driveshaft
on the road.  If you do that, the driveshaft's rotation will probably hit
something and that'll break all kinds of stuff.  Wouldn't be unusual. With
the front driveshaft, you have the option of stabbing it into the road and
doing a bunch of damage that way.

So basically you claim the root cause is a universal joint failure.  It's
still not clear where the joint is, but I'm going to guess you mean it was a
double universal joint and is part of the front driveshaft.
