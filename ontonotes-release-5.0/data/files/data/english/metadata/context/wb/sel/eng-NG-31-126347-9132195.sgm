Dear All,
I am writing this half way through process, when, perhaps, had I had my
thinking cap securely fitted, I would have canvassed opinion before its
undertaking so please keep tut tutting to a minimum please.  The process in
question, you might have guessed from the subject of the message, is
shifting my itunes music folder to an external hard disk.  So far I have
copied the entire contents of the iTunes folder, which includes artwork,
iTunes Music, etc. to the external hard drive in question.  I have then told
iTunes in the preferences/advanced/general pane the new location of the
music library.  I have also selected the 'keep folder organized' preference
and thus when I redirected iTunes to the newly copied music folder it then
went about 're-organizing' things for me (not quite sure what it was
actually doing but...).  Does this mean that I can now erase the original
iTunes folder from my iMac, in the process freeing up some much needed hard
disk space, confident that iTunes knows to access the hard disk for its
library and that it will locate any new imports there from now on or am I
teetering on the edge of a precipice of irretrievable data loss, premature
hair loss, etc.?? Please advise.

I have had inexplicable losses doing it this way. Much better to
leave the folder where it is, tell iTunes a new location then
choose Consolidate Library, iTunes will then move the folder and
keep track. also, compare the size of the folders just to see if
there are discrepancies.

usually I don't suggest backing up on DVDs but since iTunes is
quite intelligent about it now, I would say that is a good idea
(not that I've done it recently). It will rememebre what has
been backed up and what hasn't.

I've done this once successfully and once
unsuccessfully. I followed the same process
both times. Although I like iTunes, I think
that at some deep level it is sometimes

I haven't yet deleted the original iTunes folder on my iMac's hard
disk but have pointed iTunes to the new music folder on the external
hard disk as I said before.  When I go into my iTunes music library
within iTunes (ie the entire list of the library) the song files are
confirming that they are being sourced from the new path on the
external hard drive.  However, if I look at a song file within a
playlist, they are still displaying the old path to the original
music library on my iMac which I still haven't erased.  Will iTunes
automatically correct this or will I have to completely reconstruct
my playlists?

IN THEORY it look as though you've done
everything that's required to move both the
music and the playlists (as I recall that's
the reason behind all the stuff in the
Advanced Options dialogue or whatever it is).
If you're still uncertain, why not delete an
album's worth from the original library -
perhaps a CD you burned rather than purchased
- and then see if iTunes still picks it up
from the new location? If it doesn't, you
haven't really lost anything.

I have deleted a couple of tracks from the original library.  When I
try to play them iTunes says it can't find the original and asks to
be pointed in its direction.  Rather worryingly as well, when I
checked the preferences after opening iTunes it had reverted to the
original library location rather than the new one on the external
hard drive that I created yesterday.  I erased the new library on the
external drive and asked iTunes to move the library to the external
hard drive without placing the song files there first.  Although it
said it was updating the library, when that process had finished it
didn't prompt me to organize the folders/songs like it had done
previously and none of the song files had been actually moved.
Fortunatley I haven't lost anything and iTunes is still operating off
of the original library on my iMac but I really want to shift it to
the external. Help!!

there is a menu command called Consolidate Library, under
Advanced. THat should collect everything into your designated
folder. Create the new one on the hard drive and tell it to use
that in the Prefs, then Consolidate it.

when that finishes, check the size of the folders to see if
there are obvious problems.

Jonathan,

Try holding down 'alt' when opening iTunes from the dock until you get a dialogue box appear. It will give you the option of 'choosing' or 'creating' an iTunes folder. You may be able to navigate to the new one by doing that. Incidentally, it works in iPhoto (which is how I found out about that function).

Good luck.
John

I don't want to be impatient but I've given the instructions at
least twice now!

Change the location of your iTunes folder in prefs.

Consolidate Library.

check the folder that results to see if it matches the size of
the original. If you're happy with it and are sure it hasn't
lost anything, you're ok to delete the original. But I do
recommend a separate backup on DVD too.

nothing else!

sorry, realised I was too short here. Create an empty folder on
the hard drive which you can point iTunes at is what I should
have said here.

apologies. slightly mad day (week).
