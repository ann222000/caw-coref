Thoreau's position might be described as a kind of &quot;cost benefit&quot;
logic. Here Thoreau describes his logic of going to travel by train.
His conclusion is consistent with his prior positions: do it as simply
and as cheaply as possible, and with your own labor - do it on foot.
Thoreau concludes that this is the fastest as well!

In Skinner's Walden we might assume a similar human powered motif for
the community. One might assume a utopia would have robots or trams or
conveyer belts or jet packs for all of their members. However, they
would soon become quite unhealthy. In Skinner's Walden the fictional
characters walk around the community getting there only by car. When
Burris decides to go back to the community he decides to walk. In this
sense Skinner posits a utopia not just as some ideal place, but as a
place that is ideal for us.

&quot;[9]    One says to me, &quot;I wonder that you do not lay up money; you
love to travel; you might take the cars and go to Fitchburg today and
see the country.&quot; But I am wiser than that. I have learned that the
swiftest traveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose
we try who will get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the
fare ninety cents. That is almost a day's wages. I remember when wages
were sixty cents a day for laborers on this very road. Well, I start
now on foot, and get there before night; I have travelled at that rate
by the week together. You will in the meanwhile have earned your fare,
and arrive there some time tomorrow, or possibly this evening, if you
are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead of going to
Fitchburg, you will be working here the greater part of the day. And
so, if the railroad reached round the world, I think that I should
keep ahead of you; and as for seeing the country and getting
experience of that kind, I should have to cut your acquaintance
altogether. &quot; http://thoreau.eserver.org/walden1d.html
