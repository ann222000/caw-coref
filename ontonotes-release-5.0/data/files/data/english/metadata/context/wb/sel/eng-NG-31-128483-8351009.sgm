James Quintiere, Ph.DJames Quintiere, Ph.D., former Chief of the Fire
Science Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), has called for an independent review of NIST's investigation
into the collapses of the World Trade Center Towers on 9/11.

Dr. Quintiere made his plea during his presentation, &quot;Questions on the
WTC Investigations&quot; at the 2007 World Fire Safety Conference. &quot;I wish
that there would be a peer review of this,&quot; he said, referring to the
NIST investigation. &quot;I think all the records that NIST has assembled
should be archived. I would really like to see someone else take a
look at what they've done; both structurally and from a fire point of
view.&quot;

&quot;I think the official conclusion that NIST arrived at is
questionable,&quot; explained Dr. Quintiere. &quot;Let's look at real
alternatives that might have been the cause of the collapse of the
World Trade Towers and how that relates to the official cause and
what's the significance of one cause versus another.&quot;

Dr. Quintiere, one of the world's leading fire science researchers and
safety engineers, also encouraged his audience of fellow researchers
and engineers to scientifically re-examine the WTC collapses. &quot;I hope
to convince you to perhaps become 'Conspiracy Theorists', but in a
proper way,&quot; he said.

In his hour-long presentation, Dr. Quintiere discussed many elements
of NIST's investigation that he found problematic. He emphasized, &quot;In
every investigation I've taken part in, the key has been to establish
a timeline. And the timeline is established by witness accounts, by
information from alarm systems, by any video that you might have of
the event, and then by calculations. And you try to put all of this
together. And if your calculations are consistent with some of these
hard facts, then perhaps you can have some comfort in the results of
your calculations. I have not seen a timeline placed in the NIST
report.&quot;

Dr. Quintiere also expressed his frustration at NIST's failure to
provide a report on the third skyscraper that collapsed on 9/11, World
Trade Center Building 7. &quot;And that building was not hit by anything,&quot;
noted Dr. Quintiere. &quot;It's more important to take a look at that.
Maybe there was damage by the debris falling down that played a
significant role. But other than that you had fires burning a long
time without fire department intervention. And firefighters were in
that building. I have yet to see any kind of story about what they
saw. What was burning? Were photographs taken? Nothing!&quot;

World Trade Center Building 7 was 610 feet tall, 47 stories, and would
have been the tallest building in 33 states. Although it was not hit
by an airplane on 9/11, it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble
in less than 8 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11. In the 6 years since
9/11, NIST has failed to provide any explanation for the collapse. In
addition to NIST's failure to provide an explanation, absolutely no
mention of Building 7's collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission's
&quot;full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.&quot; [To watch a video of the

]

Dr. Quintiere said he originally &quot;had high hopes&quot; that NIST would do a
good job with the investigation. &quot;They're the central government lab
for fire. There are good people there and they can do a good job. But
what I also thought they would do is to enlist the service of the ATF
[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], which has an
investigation force and a laboratory of their own for fire. And I
thought they would put people out on the street and get gumshoe-type
information. What prevented all of this? I think it's the legal
structure that cloaks the Commerce Department and therefore NIST. And
so, instead of lawyers as if they were acting on a civil case trying
to get depositions and information subpoenaed, those lawyers did the
opposite and blocked everything.&quot;

In his presentation, Dr. Quintiere also criticized NIST's repeated
failures to formally respond to serious questions raised about its
conclusions regarding the WTC building collapses and the process it
employed to arrive at those conclusions. &quot;I sat through all of the
NIST hearings. I went to all of their advisory board meetings, as an
observer. I made comments at all.&quot;

Responding to a comment from a NIST representative in the audience,
Dr. Quintiere said, &quot;I found that throughout your whole investigation
it was very difficult to get a clear answer. And when anyone went to
your advisory panel meetings or hearings, where they were given five
minutes to make a statement; they could never ask any questions. And
with all the commentary that I put in, and I spent many hours writing
things, and it would bore people if I regurgitated all of that here, I
never received one formal reply.&quot;

Although Dr. Quintiere was strongly critical of NIST's conclusions and
its investigatory process, he made it clear he was not a supporter of
theories that the Twin Towers were brought down by pre-planted
explosives. &quot;If you go to World Trade Center One, nine minutes before
its collapse, there was a line of smoke that puffed out. This is one
of the basis of the 'conspiracy theories' that says the smoke puffing
out all around the building is due to somebody setting off an
explosive charge. Well, I think, more likely, it's one of the floors
falling down.&quot;

Dr. Quintiere summarized the NIST conclusion about the cause of the
collapses of the Twin Towers. &quot;It says that the core columns,
uninsulated due to the fact that the aircraft stripped off that
insulation; they softened in the heat of the fire and shortened and
that led to the collapse. They pulled in the external columns and it
caused it to buckle. They went on further to say that there would be
no collapse if the insulation remained in place.&quot;

Dr. Quintiere then presented his and his students' research that
contradicts the NIST report and points to a different cause for the
collapses; the application of insufficient fire-proofing insulation on
the truss rods in the Twin Towers. &quot;I suggest that there's an equally
justifiable theory and that's the trusses fail as they are heated by
the fire with the insulation intact. These are two different
conclusions and the accountability for each is dramatically
different,&quot; he said.

Dr. Quintiere's presentation at the World Fire Safety Conference
echoed his earlier statement to the U.S. House of Representatives,
Committee on Science, on October 26, 2005, during a hearing on &quot;The
Investigation of the World Trade Center Collapse: Findings,
Recommendations, and Next Steps&quot;, at which he stated:

&quot;In my opinion, the WTC investigation by NIST falls short of
expectations by not definitively finding cause, by not sufficiently
linking recommendations of specificity to cause, by not fully invoking
all of their authority to seek facts in the investigation, and by the
guidance of government lawyers to deter rather than develop fact
finding.

&quot;I have over 35 years of fire research in my experience. I worked in
the fire program at NIST for 19 years, leaving as a division chief. I
have been at the University of Maryland since. I am a founding member
and past-Chair of the International Association for Fire Safety Science
-the principal world forum for fire research. ...

&quot;All of these have been submitted to NIST, but never acknowledged or
answered. I will list some of these.

1. Why is not the design process of assigning fire protection to the
WTC towers fully called out for fault? ...

2. Why were not alternative collapse hypotheses investigated and
discussed as NIST had stated repeatedly that they would do? ...

3. Spoliation of a fire scene is a basis for destroying a legal case
in an investigation. Most of the steel was discarded, although the key
elements of the core steel were demographically labeled. A careful
reading of the NIST report shows that they have no evidence that the
temperatures they predict as necessary for failure are corroborated by
findings of the little steel debris they have. Why hasn't NIST
declared that this spoliation of the steel was a gross error?

4. NIST used computer models that they said have never been used in
such an application before and are the state of the art. For this they
should be commended for their skill. But the validation of these
modeling results is in question. Others have computed aspects with
different conclusions on the cause mechanism of the collapse.
Moreover, it is common in fire investigation to compute a time-line
and compare it to known events. NIST has not done that.

5. Testing by NIST has been inconclusive. Although they have done fire
tests of the scale of several work stations, a replicate test of at
least &amp; [sic] of a WTC floor would have been of considerable value.
Why was this not done? ...

6. The critical collapse of WTC 7 is relegated to a secondary role, as
its findings will not be complete for yet another year. It was clear
at the last NIST Advisory Panel meeting in September [2005] that this
date may not be realistic, as NIST has not demonstrated progress here.
Why has NIST dragged on this important investigation?&quot;

&gt; its findings will not be complete for yet another year. It was clear
&gt; at the last NIST Advisory Panel meeting in September [2005] that this
&gt; date may not be realistic, as NIST has not demonstrated progress here.
&gt; Why has NIST dragged on this important investigation?&quot;

lol.Thats why the former Chief of NIST decided to make his talk at the

&gt; By Alan Miller
&gt; Original Story: OpEd News

&gt; James Quintiere, Ph.DJames Quintiere, Ph.D., former Chief of the Fire
&gt; Science Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
&gt; (NIST), has called for an independent review of NIST's investigation
&gt; into the collapses of the World Trade Center Towers on 9/11.

&gt; Dr. Quintiere made his plea during his presentation, &quot;Questions on the
&gt; WTC Investigations&quot; at the 2007 World Fire Safety Conference. &quot;I wish
&gt; that there would be a peer review of this,&quot; he said, referring to the
&gt; NIST investigation. &quot;I think all the records that NIST has assembled
&gt; should be archived. I would really like to see someone else take a
&gt; look at what they've done; both structurally and from a fire point of
&gt; view.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I think the official conclusion that NIST arrived at is
&gt; questionable,&quot; explained Dr. Quintiere. &quot;Let's look at real
&gt; alternatives that might have been the cause of the collapse of the
&gt; World Trade Towers and how that relates to the official cause and
&gt; what's the significance of one cause versus another.&quot;

&gt; Dr. Quintiere, one of the world's leading fire science researchers and
&gt; safety engineers, also encouraged his audience of fellow researchers
&gt; and engineers to scientifically re-examine the WTC collapses. &quot;I hope
&gt; to convince you to perhaps become 'Conspiracy Theorists', but in a
&gt; proper way,&quot; he said.

&gt; In his hour-long presentation, Dr. Quintiere discussed many elements
&gt; of NIST's investigation that he found problematic. He emphasized, &quot;In
&gt; every investigation I've taken part in, the key has been to establish
&gt; a timeline. And the timeline is established by witness accounts, by
&gt; information from alarm systems, by any video that you might have of
&gt; the event, and then by calculations. And you try to put all of this
&gt; together. And if your calculations are consistent with some of these
&gt; hard facts, then perhaps you can have some comfort in the results of
&gt; your calculations. I have not seen a timeline placed in the NIST
&gt; report.&quot;

&gt; Dr. Quintiere also expressed his frustration at NIST's failure to
&gt; provide a report on the third skyscraper that collapsed on 9/11, World
&gt; Trade Center Building 7. &quot;And that building was not hit by anything,&quot;
&gt; noted Dr. Quintiere. &quot;It's more important to take a look at that.
&gt; Maybe there was damage by the debris falling down that played a
&gt; significant role. But other than that you had fires burning a long
&gt; time without fire department intervention. And firefighters were in
&gt; that building. I have yet to see any kind of story about what they
&gt; saw. What was burning? Were photographs taken? Nothing!&quot;

&gt; World Trade Center Building 7 was 610 feet tall, 47 stories, and would
&gt; have been the tallest building in 33 states. Although it was not hit
&gt; by an airplane on 9/11, it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble
&gt; in less than 8 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11. In the 6 years since
&gt; 9/11, NIST has failed to provide any explanation for the collapse. In
&gt; addition to NIST's failure to provide an explanation, absolutely no
&gt; mention of Building 7's collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission's
&gt; &quot;full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the
&gt; September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.&quot; [To watch a video of the
&gt; collapse, click here http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/IMAGES/WTC7_Collapse.wmv
&gt; ]

&gt; Dr. Quintiere said he originally &quot;had high hopes&quot; that NIST would do a
&gt; good job with the investigation. &quot;They're the central government lab
&gt; for fire. There are good people there and they can do a good job. But
&gt; what I also thought they would do is to enlist the service of the ATF
&gt; [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], which has an
&gt; investigation force and a laboratory of their own for fire. And I
&gt; thought they would put people out on the street and get gumshoe-type
&gt; information. What prevented all of this? I think it's the legal
&gt; structure that cloaks the Commerce Department and therefore NIST. And
&gt; so, instead of lawyers as if they were acting on a civil case trying
&gt; to get depositions and information subpoenaed, those lawyers did the
&gt; opposite and blocked everything.&quot;

&gt; In his presentation, Dr. Quintiere also criticized NIST's repeated
&gt; failures to formally respond to serious questions raised about its
&gt; conclusions regarding the WTC building collapses and the process it
&gt; employed to arrive at those conclusions. &quot;I sat through all of the
&gt; NIST hearings. I went to all of their advisory board meetings, as an
&gt; observer. I made comments at all.&quot;

&gt; Responding to a comment from a NIST representative in the audience,
&gt; Dr. Quintiere said, &quot;I found that throughout your whole investigation
&gt; it was very difficult to get a clear answer. And when anyone went to
&gt; your advisory panel meetings or hearings, where they were given five
&gt; minutes to make a statement; they could never ask any questions. And
&gt; with all the commentary that I put in, and I spent many hours writing
&gt; things, and it would bore people if I regurgitated all of that here, I
&gt; never received one formal reply.&quot;

&gt; Although Dr. Quintiere was strongly critical of NIST's conclusions and
&gt; its investigatory process, he made it clear he was not a supporter of
&gt; theories that the Twin Towers were brought down by pre-planted
&gt; explosives. &quot;If you go to World Trade Center One, nine minutes before
&gt; its collapse, there was a line of smoke that puffed out. This is one
&gt; of the basis of the 'conspiracy theories' that says the smoke puffing
&gt; out all around the building is due to somebody setting off an
&gt; explosive charge. Well, I think, more likely, it's one of the floors
&gt; falling down.&quot;

&gt; Dr. Quintiere summarized the NIST conclusion about the cause of the
&gt; collapses of the Twin Towers. &quot;It says that the core columns,
&gt; uninsulated due to the fact that the aircraft stripped off that
&gt; insulation; they softened in the heat of the fire and shortened and
&gt; that led to the collapse. They pulled in the external columns and it
&gt; caused it to buckle. They went on further to say that there would be
&gt; no collapse if the insulation remained in place.&quot;

&gt; Dr. Quintiere then presented his and his students' research that
&gt; contradicts the NIST report and points to a different cause for the
&gt; collapses; the application of insufficient fire-proofing insulation on
&gt; the truss rods in the Twin Towers. &quot;I suggest that there's an equally
&gt; justifiable theory and that's the trusses fail as they are heated by
&gt; the fire with the insulation intact. These are two different
&gt; conclusions and the accountability for each is dramatically
&gt; different,&quot; he said.

&gt; Dr. Quintiere's presentation at the World Fire Safety Conference
&gt; echoed his earlier statement to the U.S. House of Representatives,
&gt; Committee on Science, on October 26, 2005, during a hearing on &quot;The
&gt; Investigation of the World Trade Center Collapse: Findings,
&gt; Recommendations, and Next Steps&quot;, at which he stated:

&gt; &quot;In my opinion, the WTC investigation by NIST falls short of
&gt; expectations by not definitively finding cause, by not sufficiently
&gt; linking recommendations of specificity to cause,

&gt;&gt;Dr. Quintiere said he originally &quot;had high hopes&quot; that NIST would do a
&gt;&gt;good job with the investigation. &quot;They're the central government lab
&gt;&gt;for fire. There are good people there and they can do a good job. But
&gt;&gt;what I also thought they would do is to enlist the service of the ATF
&gt;&gt;[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], which has an
&gt;&gt;investigation force and a laboratory of their own for fire. And I
&gt;&gt;thought they would put people out on the street and get gumshoe-type
&gt;&gt;information. What prevented all of this? I think it's the legal
&gt;&gt;structure that cloaks the Commerce Department and therefore NIST. And
&gt;&gt;so, instead of lawyers as if they were acting on a civil case trying
&gt;&gt;to get depositions and information subpoenaed, those lawyers did the
&gt;&gt;opposite and blocked everything.&quot;

&gt; lol. Vandar you're a dreamer. Wake up to the reality of government
&gt; false-flag terrorism.

Alex Jones wants to know when he can expect your next check.
Dylan Avery is begging for money now too. Better cut him a check so he

Maybe he'll use the money to get denied entry to another college or bail
out his producer... or pay his rent.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Wake the fuck up, Jake.

&gt; &gt; Vandar I thought you said it was the most investigated collapse in the

&gt; It is, was, and will be for quite some time.

&gt; &gt; Thats what all you Official kooks keep spewing around Usenet.
&gt; &gt; That above lecture by former Chief of NIST tells you its one the least
&gt; &gt; investigated and that evidence was destoryed deliberately

&gt; That isn't what he said.

&gt; &gt; ====
&gt; &gt; &quot;I think the official conclusion that NIST arrived at is
&gt; &gt; questionable,&quot; explained Dr. Quintiere. &quot;Let's look at real
&gt; &gt; alternatives that might have been the cause of the collapse of the
&gt; &gt; World Trade Towers and how that relates to the official cause and
&gt; &gt; what's the significance of one cause versus another.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Dr. Quintiere, one of the world's leading fire science researchers and
&gt; &gt; safety engineers, also encouraged his audience of fellow researchers
&gt; &gt; and engineers to scientifically re-examine the WTC collapses. &quot;I hope
&gt; &gt; to convince you to perhaps become 'Conspiracy Theorists', but in a
&gt; &gt; proper way,&quot; he said.
&gt; &gt; ===

&gt; As I said: He didn't say it's one of the least investigated.

&gt; &gt; Vandar, that one statement of yours is NOTHING compared to the impact
&gt; &gt; that lecture being at the world fire safety conferance will have on
&gt; &gt; getting others to wake the fuck up. He almost HAS to disclaim that he
&gt; &gt; is not a supporter of the controlled demolition because otherwise he
&gt; &gt; will be attacked by the criminals.

&gt; uh huh.

&gt; Every that is presented that counters your version is &quot;proof&quot; for how
&gt; vast the evil Jew conspiracy is, right?

&gt; &gt; You don't understand how scientists understate opinions deliberately.
&gt; &gt; You're in denial.

&gt; &gt; Tell me, what CONSPIRACY would he be refferring to then? There is only
&gt; &gt; one out there: that 9/11 was an inside job.

&gt; You'd better re-read your precious little conspiracy sites.
">

So what CONSPIRACY is Dr. Quintiere refering to?,

&quot;one of the world's leading fire science researchers and
safety engineers, also encouraged his audience of fellow researchers
and engineers to scientifically re-examine the WTC collapses. &quot;I hope
to convince you to perhaps become 'Conspiracy Theorists', but in a
proper way,&quot; he said. &quot;&quot;

What conspiracy is he talking about Vandar? I thought all you kooks
deny there is any CONSPIRACY?
Why would the leading fire-safety expert in the world tell a packed
out World Fire Safety Conferand, an audience of fellow researchers and
engineers to become Conspiracy Theorists when looking into the
collapse of the towers? Why Vandar? Whats he talking about?

You better watch who you dis. They may be your best allies when the
truth of controlled demolition finally awakens the masses who will
then want blood. You know how unpopular the jews are, how easy it is
to convince the masses they should lynch jews and all their right-wing
Zionazi fascist Nazis racists like yourself. Lucky the jews kept all

The jews did 9/11. What else do I have to say? The jews have gotten
our countries' men and women to fight and die for them by fooling us
into believing that muslims were behind the attacks of 9/11. The jews
carry out their false flag and then point us all to their enemies in
the middle-east and tell us &quot;There are you 9/11 perpetrators, go get
them&quot;.

The jews must be brought to account. I don't see many honest jews
around speaking up about this truth. They are around and they will be
noted. There will not be a frenzied persecution of jews but the
community will be brought to account and one by one all those found
guilty of omission or complicity in the deception will be executed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wake the fuck up, Jake.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, sure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dr. Quintiere said he originally &quot;had high hopes&quot; that NIST would do a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;good job with the investigation. &quot;They're the central government lab
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for fire. There are good people there and they can do a good job. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what I also thought they would do is to enlist the service of the ATF
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], which has an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;investigation force and a laboratory of their own for fire. And I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;thought they would put people out on the street and get gumshoe-type
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;information. What prevented all of this? I think it's the legal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;structure that cloaks the Commerce Department and therefore NIST. And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so, instead of lawyers as if they were acting on a civil case trying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to get depositions and information subpoenaed, those lawyers did the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;opposite and blocked everything.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;lol. Vandar you're a dreamer. Wake up to the reality of government
&gt;&gt;&gt;false-flag terrorism.

&gt;&gt;Alex Jones wants to know when he can expect your next check.
&gt;&gt;Dylan Avery is begging for money now too. Better cut him a check so he
&gt;&gt;can afford to finish his movie that's being released less than 3 weeks.
&gt;&gt;Maybe he'll use the money to get denied entry to another college or bail
&gt;&gt;out his producer... or pay his rent.

&gt; You know that Alex Jones and Dylan Avery deny Zionist evidence of
&gt; conspiracy of Israel in 9/11?
&gt; You better watch who you dis. They may be your best allies when the
&gt; truth of controlled demolition finally awakens the masses who will
&gt; then want blood.

My allies are the facts and scholars with jobs.

&gt; Well, I think, more likely, it's one of the floors falling

&gt; Dr. Quintiere then presented his and his students'
&gt; research that contradicts the NIST report and
&gt; points to a different cause for the collapses; the
&gt; application of insufficient fire-proofing insulation on
&gt; the truss rods in the Twin Towers. &quot;I suggest that
&gt; there's an equally justifiable theory and that's the
&gt; trusses fail as they are heated by the fire with the

The most *studied*.

It is because it is studied and discussed by professionals regularly, that
you have the very comments you quoted. They were studying and discussing the

Oddly enough, quite by accident, you are correct, possibly for the first

You might notice they were discussing 9/11 and the WTC collapses. It's 6
years later, and they were discussing all this just recently. Among fire
professionals and engineers (among others), the events of 9/11 and the
collapse of the towers is frequently discussed and studied.

Page 19 of NIST NCSTAR 1 starts with;

&quot;2.1 8:46:30 A.M. EDT
On the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, a lot of people were going to
be late for work in New York City, which for many started at 9:00 a.m. or
later.  It was the first day of school for many local children, and it also
was a primary election day in New York.  The weather was clear and
comfortable with little wind to speak of, so some took time to do early
morning errands.  As a result, only about 8,900 of the typical 20,000 people
were in World Trade Center (WTC) 1 shortly before 9:00 a.m.

At 8:46:30 a.m. EDT, five hijackers flew American Airlines Flight 11 (AA 11)
with 11 crew and 76 passengers into the north face of WTC 1 (Figure 2-1). &quot;

... it then continues with the rest of the timeline for the events in regard
to tower one. It then continues in the next chapter with the timeline of
events for tower two.

So, I guess he just didn't like the format.

Because the organizers of the events filled out one of these

They paid the fee and then charge a fee to attendees in an attempt to
profit from the event.
That's what the &quot;truth&quot; movement does. That's why the &quot;truth&quot; movement
will NEVER initiate an actual investigation and generate a final report
at no cost.
