Well, this isn't a post for asking a problem. I just want you to tell
the others your favourites web pages that uses google map, just for
inspire ourselves.

to make it a good one.

I see ugly &quot;image not found&quot; boxes sitting underneath all of your
markers, where I'd expect the marker shadows to be displayed. I don't
think you're setting the icon.shadow to point to a valid image.

Yep, same here, the shadow icons are not working on my machine either.
I am on WinXP-SP2, with firefox.

But, it looks pretty nice though! I am working on a site to tell the
world about my travels, with maps and photo's, but I still have a lot
of work to do, so I will let you know when it is done...

Check the Map API, you've missed a definition:

icon.shadow =
&quot;&quot;;

Likewise, hard at work, but still a work in progress.

I think it would be better:

If the info in the &quot;list&quot; matched the markers on the &quot;map&quot;, or at least
if the ones that didn't match were displayed differently. (Does the
&quot;list&quot; contain properties that have no .status, but the &quot;map&quot; omits
them?)

If it didn't do that weird scrolling when you click an item in the
&quot;list&quot;. Every time I click on an item in the &quot;list&quot;, it scrolls part of
the &quot;map&quot; off the screen and I have to scroll it back.

If your code to match the zoom level to the displayed markers wasn't off
by 1 zoom level. (The code looks good to me, but I have to zoom out one
step to see all the markers, so something's not quite right.)

I like it. It's to the point. No extraneous eye candy to distract from
the purpose of the page.

The page does an odd jump when I click on a marker. It looks like it
scrolls up. I set the browser window size to 1024x768. When I click the
marker, the page scrolls up so that the last line on the page (the
disclaimer) is visible. Could it be the &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt; below the
&lt;/body&gt;? An html validator such as the one at
can help to reduce the number of diagnostics.

Upon further investigation, your zoom level code gets it right for some
zip codes. One that it doesn't get right is 94402, for both Single and
Condo.

creaturita: looks cute, but I can't understand the language. Also, why
the Microsoft ad for ASP.NET.2.0? The invalid (script before html?)
code has 20 warnings, if I was involved in the development of
ASP.NET.2.0 tools, it's not something I'd brag about! ;)

Anrake: I like Guide to Japanese Castles, looks good and works well.
Nice job!

Lei: HousingRadar text came up very small for me.
