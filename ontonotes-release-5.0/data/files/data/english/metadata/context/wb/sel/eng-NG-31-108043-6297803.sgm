AD&amp;D  1977-79
2nd Edition  1989
3rd Edition 2000
4th Edition  ?

Historically, we've seen major revisions every decade or so.  That
would suggest we'll see 4.0 somewhere around 2010.

This seems plausible to me, for reasons that go beyond "year ends in
nine or zero".

While 3.5 was sprung on an unsuspecting world very quickly, the big
editions have all had a year or more of lead time.  IMS it was just
over a year for second edition, and about 18-20 months for 3.0.  So
I'd be very surprised if we saw 4.0 before 2008.

Further: Wizards has investments that will be adversely affected.  For
instance, their miniature lines are still profitable.  But a new
edition would require rebooting those lines from scratch.  So,
assuming good business decision-making -- always an open question, to
be sure -- they would want to put it off until 3.x was milked dry, or
nearly so.

On the other hand, while 3.x isn't squeezed dry yet, the writing is on
the wall.  We've had pretty much every splatbook imaginable.  Deserts
and dragons, wars and aberrations, they've all had a product devoted
to them.  WotC's recent shift towards adventure publishing is
suggestive; there may be nothing left to say on the subject of dark
elves, but you can always crank out another dungeon linked to the
Underdark.

Is there another year or two of interesting material to be written and
published about 3.x?  Probably.  Five years?  I doubt it.  Ten?  No
way.

Of course, /interesting/ is not the metric businesses use.  They're
looking for what sells.  And for now, 3.x material is still selling.
But it's down from a few years ago.  Maybe that's because of trends in
the industry and hobby generally, of course.  But a sensible business
will, at some point, either kill the product or go for a reboot.  And
given that the last reboot was a great success, -- regardless of
whether you like 3.0 or not, the fact is it made a buttload of money
-- I'd expect them to try at least one more.  Probably around the time
3.5 product sales really start caving.  Which would likely be sometime
in the next three to five years.

So we'd expect 3.5 no earlier than 2008 and no later than 2012.
Taking the average... around 2010.

Let me put my money where my mouth is.  I bet that 4.0 will hit the
shelves on July 1, 2010, plus or minus one year.  A two year window
isn't deadly accuracy, but hey... we're guessing here.

Disagree?  When do /you/ think we'll see 4.0, and why?

They'll probably try for Aug/Sep again, that whole three books in
three months and then talk it all up again for christmas trick. My
reckoning has been for better than a year now that it's to be in
playtest by the end of this year (if it's not already) and on sale late
2008, *at the latest*.

There is some room for more 3.5 work, a bit of 3.0 stuff that's not
been done over, MM2, AnEG, and so on. They could also dump more 4e
concepts into splatbooks, but the Bo9S and various new magic systems
look a lot like that already.

What we really need is a mass combat system (sacrificed for minis),
a realm system (who knows?) and a patch for epic play that actually
works. Not f'n likely that.

They're supposedly earning heavily on minis now, and Warhammer (the
most successful mini on the market) turns over editions much quicker
than eight years. Makes everyone rebuy everything (without actually
requiring it, technically), which keeps working for them for some reason.
Will that be the case for DnD collectable minis? They can't know
until they try, and eventually it becomes a bigger risk not to try.

Book sales are down, partly due to MMOs taking over peoples game
time, and one can't predict when that crack habit will die off or what
will replace it. They should really put their brand behind some sort of
net-based matching service and virtual game table, but that's all
changing so quick they'll never pick the right tool. Hell, most computer
things they've tried since 3e have turned to shit.

The other reason book sales are down is the books. I mean, there's
probably some good stuff on the way, but I've stopped looking. Most of
the new systems they've made reportadly don't play well unless you
switch your whole campign over to focusing on them.
Poor game design, really. Instead of 20 competing partially
supported campaign settings ala 2nd edition they've got 20 incompatable
power systems that suck up a bit of space each in every successive book.

3e /is/ dying, but it could be made to drag on for a few years yet
if they think that's best. IMO, if they've got something worthy of an
edition kicking around, it's about time they got to work on it.

Isn't that prediction *several* years old now? (Unless you're talking
about a more recent reiteration of it that I haven't seen.)

The reality is that there is absolutely no way that we are going to
see a 4th Edition later this year. This is just plain common sense:
WotC has already announced 3.5 products through the end of the year.

The original poster is half-right: We definitely won't see a 4th
Edition until 2010 (plus or minus one year). At this point, the
realities of producing and marketing the new edition pretty much
guarantee that. WotC isn't going to skimp on either when it comes to
4th edition.

But there's no guarantee we'll see it then, either. There are plenty
of arguments which can be made for why sticking with 3rd Edition will
continue to make sense to WotC:

1. There is no sense that the marketplace is growing tired of the 3rd
Edition ruleset. To successfully launch a significant revision of your
rule system requires that your customer base is ready for such a
revision. WotC is well aware of what happened with the relatively
minor shift from 1st edition to 2nd edition (TSR split their customer
base and permanently lost a significant chunk of their audience), and
worked very hard to avoid that happening with the release of 3rd
Edition. There's no reason to think that they've forgotten the lesson.

2. The other reason they have to be fearful of splitting their
customer base is the OGL: Unless their customer base WANTS a 4th
Edition, there's really no reason they won't simply continue playing
3rd Edition (supported by a large contingent of compatible material
produced legally by third party publishers).

3. As the original poster points out, the D&amp;D miniatures game
continues to perform strongly. Warhammer reboots every couple of
years, but Warhammer isn't a collectible game. Collectible games have
a different dynamic and there's no reason to think that a major
revision of your rule system (accompanied by a complete obsoletion of
old product) is a good idea in the collectible market. I haven't been
active in the MtG scene for a few years now, but my understanding is
there hasn't been a significant revision to the MtG rules since 1999,
only expansions.

4. I have become convinced that one of the reasons we saw 3.5 come
down the pike faster than originally planned (according to Monte Cook)
was that WotC discovered that the softcover format for the class
supplements wasn't working right -- the sales weren't high enough to
justify the production costs. At the same time, the books that they
thought would be evergreen titles (Epic Level Handbook, Manual of the
Planes, Deities &amp; Demigods) turned out to be duds. Rebooting to 3.5
allowed them to restart a key component of their supplement line in
hardcover and full-color (which doesn't significantly raise WotC's
costs, but does raise the price fans are willing to pay for the
books). Did it work? Well, WotC keeps turning out new class and race
supplements, so I would say that it's a fairly safe bet that it *did*.
And if the sales of those class and race books are stabilizing at
evergreen levels, then WotC has even less motivation to ditch 3rd
Edition: They've already paid the development costs on those titles,
so they're going to want to profit from that investment for as long as
possible.

5. Contrary to what some people say, there's still plenty of design
room left in 3rd Edition. WotC seems to think they have a market for
second- and third-tier class books. WotC seems to think that major
adventure products are succeeding (enough in the past couple of years
to justify a huge slew of them this year). Their major campaign worlds
(FR and Eberron) remain largely undeveloped. And so forth.

6. And the industry is rife with recent examples of companies
mishandling the launch of a new edition and promptly obliterating
themselves. (White Wolf, I'm looking at you.)

None of these arguments apply if WotC does a CoC-style revision (where
the new edition basically does nothing except incorporate a fresh
batch of errata, leaving it completely compatible with the previous
edition). But the forthcoming release of the RULES COMPENDIUM, along
with the history of the game (which will lead fans to expect/dread a
significant revision of the rules), pretty much rules out such a
revision for 4th Edition.

And the arguments for why we might not see a new edition are certainly
subject to change: Significant dissatisfaction in the customer base?
New evergreen titles fail to emerge? D&amp;D mini sales start to flag? If
those are trends we start to see, then WotC will start the design
process on 4th Edition.

In all seriousness, WoC will roll out *any* new edition early enough in
the year to have a boxed set with the core books and probably an
introductory version in time for the fourth quarter holiday shopping
season.

Absoluely not this year.  I'd be totally flabbergasted if it did
happen, and I'm not an early adopter usually (3.5 was an exception),
so I wouldn't be upgrading unless there were a lot of obvious
improvements.

I predict at this point that 4th with probably be more like 2012 and a
fairly minor update, more similar to 3.0 - 3.5 tweaking the system
further, fixing/removing broken spells more and incorporating some of
the really good options from splatbooks.   That is if it is even
called 4th, and not 3.9 or something.

3.5 is alive and well, far more so than any previous edition this late
into its life.  It's mature, but it's got a lot of little things that
could still be clarified, tweaked, or even rolled back to make it
really polished.

Or maybe that's just what I would like to see ;)

The core rules are certainly nearing the end of their evolutionary
process. Even if the number of players continues to grow forever, I
think it's generous to say the 5th edition will be the last.

It was announced at the D&amp;D Experience (formerly Winter Fantasy) that Wizards of
the Coast have a product schedule which runs through 2008.

The earliest I can see a new edition would therefore be late 2008 (holiday
season?) or 2009.

I don't anticipate a major overhaul of the system - more of a cleaning-up. Fix
LA/ECL, make certain new concepts core, include good high-level feats for
warrior types.

i suspect, never.  by the time a 4.0 becomes possible, the audience
will have been almost completely eaten by collectible thingy games and
WoW++.  the few gamers still sitting around a table with dice won't be
a viable market for a new edition.  at best, there may still be a good
market for third-party d20 stuff, including alternate rule sets such as
arcana evolved, iron heroes, true 20, etc.

in other news, the universe will expand forever, until even the atoms

The WoW type games will take over from pencil and paper (well, word
processor and dice, these days) games when they can actually DO the
same thing that the tabletop games do, and do it as easily as those do
it, OR when they can offer a direct experience that goes FAR beyond
anything any other form of entertainment can offer.

Which, currently, none of them even vaguely approach. You'll need at
least a close approach to real AI and/or realistic, affordable,
immersive 3d VR. Yeah, I haven't got the imagery in the tabletop
games, but the personal interaction and creativity beats the living

But I have been told by those who enjoy online MMO group play is
that is why they play online MMOs. They like the group chat while
they wait for the named monster to show up so they can attempt to

They don't need much of a rework, but they definitely need a rework.
The first stop should be the melee feats in the core rulebooks which

The second stop should be making a higher BAB more useful. I'm

I think it's an open question whether polymorph and company CAN be
fixed.

The only way I can see them working is if you pretty much accept that
the metagame needs to be taken into consideration: Give literally
everything an LA/ECL -- even animals and the like (which they should
anyway because of spells like Awaken) -- and then literally delimit
the polymorph spells in such a way that you can't assume the shape of
anything with an ECL higher than your own.

And even then the spells are a nightmare because you literally have to
prep a new stat block for everything your character shifts into.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Slap the remaining silly out of the end game spells

Hmm... I'm going to take a guess here and assume that you're talking
about "save or die" effects. I agree. These spells are just not
useful: If the DM uses them, they kill a PC with a single die roll. If
the DM doesn't use them, then the PCs essentially win the arms race
against the NPCs.

The easiest fix is to replace any "save or die" effect with 4d6 damage
or drain to the relevant ability (Dexterity for paralysis effects;
Constitution for death effects). If a death effect has a "special
effect" (like turning the target into a small pile of dust or trapping
their soul), the special effect only kicks in if the ability damage
kills them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Ditch LA, CR = HD for all.

This is never going to work.

1. The CR = HD guideline doesn't even work for straight up PCs (even
though they claim it does in the DMG).

2. It was even more busted when you started adding class levels to
monsters, which is why they had to FIX this busted rule when they did
3.5. They aren't going to bust it again for 4th edition.

3. It doesn't make any sense to artificially constrain your monster-
building options with the HD = CR limitation.

4. It makes even less sense to artificially constrain your monster-
building options so that any ability you give them has to be equally
useful if (a) they're a PC and (b) they're challenging a PC party
(which is what you do when you eliminate LA).

Now, the LA system needs to be fixed. The problem is that you've got
too many creatures who have a LA of +9 or something because the PCs
aren't supposed to have one of the abilities the creature gets
naturally until they're 10th level. But the monster is completely
nerfed if you try to play it alongside 10th level PCs because its
other abilities don't stack up -- the only thing the monster has going
for him is this one ability.

There are a number of free MMOs out there. Some are pay for the

The difference between PC and NPC usefulness is nonsense. With trivial
exceptions (regeneration and DR/magic, I am looking at you) the
difference between LA and CR comes entirely and exclusively from the
value of NPC or PC gear and elite abilities.

That's it.

Stuff about a PC being able to use his abilities all day while a
monster gets only a few rounds ignores things like a monster based PC
having 3 times/day powers while a PC fighter has everything unlimited
times a day.

Add gear, elite abilities, and sensible skill and feat choices to a
Succubus and her CR is about equal to her ECL as is. Doesn't need any
class levels and doesn't need any mystical claim that somehow her
abilities are worth more as a PC, they are worth more as a sensibly
played creature, but that's the point.

Again nonsense. Give an example. IME the LA is +9 because adding elite
abilities, sensible skills and feats, and equipment to the monster
MAKES it about HD+9 CR. Where the LA is broken is that as the creature
advances it has no way to meaningfully improve it's monster abilities
and has to start a class from scratch. But THAT can be fixed by fixing
monster HD so they are about as good as class HD, which making one
HD==one CR implies doing anyway.

I was custom designing almost every monster last campaign, and IME
with elite abilities and gear ECL is a fine measure of CR.

I wouldn't say it screws the sorcerer that much, many don't even use
that spell, and it isn't even available until 10th level, half of a
standard campaign (in practice far more).

I think this is the only way to fix polymorph without removing it
totally.  I don't think you need to go all out and make each form a
separate spell, but limiting it to a set group of specific forms, ala
summons should be doable.

As far as (C), I find it's a non-issue, much like LA if you choose
something substandard, that's your problem, and since it's a spell and
is chosen to be cast, it's far less of a problem than a bad race &amp;
class combo.

Alternately instead of having a separate stat block, it could be that
you literally become said creature, all your stats change to that in
the MM (possibly barring HP) - equipment and all.  Of course that
creates the same stupid issue that WOTC's "Fix" to druid wildshape
has, just take your armor off, change form, and put it back on.

On my last thought, there's the possibility that any polymorph is
inherently broken.  Even if you limit it to a creature with equal ECL,
your additional levels are going to effectively make you that ECL
+Caster Level, so the only real fix would be limiting you to races
with the same or lower starting ECL as your own.  IE, if you start as
a human you can only change to other races with no racial HD and LA
+0, which makes about for a 1st or at most a 2nd level spell.

did not "split the customer base" anywhere NEAR like going to the
incompatible 3rd edition.  One of my gaming groups STILL refuses to
shift to 3rd edition because of the huge amount of time and expense
that would be involved in trying to shift over hundreds of existing
PCs (and NPCs as well).  There is NO simple way to do it and keep the
existing balance (the different ways multiclassing works, feats, you
name it).  The other groups I'm in switched over but only slowly, over
time.  And the quick 3.0 to 3.5 made a whole BUNCH of people around
here take the attitude "they aren't doing it to improve the game,
they're just trying to force people to spend $500 to buy a new set of
books every couple of years."

Well, at the level it's available and up, the sorceror now needs (but can't

&gt; did not &quot;split the customer base&quot; anywhere NEAR like going to the
&gt; incompatible 3rd edition.
">

The statement's based on WotC's marketing research from 2000 (which is
the only meaningful marketing research ever made publicly available
for the roleplaying industry) and from later public statements about
follow-up research. (The 2000 results were actually released. The
later research has been talked about, to a limited extent, but not
released.)

My guess is that the split was actually starting to happen before 2nd
Edition hit the shelves and was based on the different direction that
many fans saw TSR taking during those years. And for a lot of fans,
2nd edition and 1st edition *weren't* compatible. This is something I
had difficulty believing myself, but I've been convinced it's the
case.

I think the fact that 2nd edition didn't represent a significant break
from 1st edition was actually part of the problem: By 1989 a lot of
fans had already house ruled and customized the game to correct the
most blatant failures of the system and to make it fit their own
personal tastes. To see a 2nd edition which offered no additional
utility (by fixing the system) while offering just enough changes to
force them to redo their house rules did nothing for them, and when it
was followed up by a slew of poorly produced supplements with little
perceived value... Well, that just sealed the deal.

You can see some indication of this in the fact that TSR continued
*profitably* printing 1st edition rulebooks and supplements for YEARS
after 2nd edition was released. (Something which probably also reduced
the 2nd edition adoption rate: The old game was still available.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One of my gaming groups STILL refuses to

Doesn't surprise me. But, surprisingly, the adoption rate of 3rd
edition -- according to all reliable reports and research -- was much,
much higher than the adoption rate of 2nd edition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And the quick 3.0 to 3.5 made a whole BUNCH of people around
&gt; here take the attitude &quot;they aren't doing it to improve the game,
&gt; they're just trying to force people to spend $500 to buy a new set of
&gt; books every couple of years.&quot;
">

Since they hadn't even released $500 worth of 3.0 material by the time
3.5 was released, this is an argument I have difficulty accepting. I'm
sure people were making it, but I just wanted to comment on the absurd
hyperbole of it. (Heck: There was as much time between 3.0 and 3.5 as
there was between the original release of D&amp;D in 1974 and the first
AD&amp;D core rulebook in 1977.)

I was a pretty big skeptic of 3.5, but it was probably worth it. I
still don't like some of the things they broke in the revision (the
rules for cover and a creature's space, for example) and I feel that
in some cases they merely switched from one busted system to a
slightly less busted system (the rules for damage reduction), but
overall the revision was a stronger game. And since they gave away all
the new rules for *free*, I really dunno how much more they could have
done.

On a tangent, this was something I thought about earlier today:
Perhaps the most *annoying* change, for me, in 3.5 was the fact that
they reused the same art but changed where they used it throughout the
book. One of the uses of art in a book is to serve as a "landmark".
Where the rules on such-and-so? Oh, they're two pages back from the
big picture and the red dragon. I still haven't managed to completely
reprogram my sense of what rules are associated with which pictures,
frequently leaving me flipping through the wrong section of the book.

&gt;On my last thought, there's the possibility that any polymorph is
&gt;inherently broken.  Even if you limit it to a creature with equal ECL,
&gt;your additional levels are going to effectively make you that ECL

&gt;with the same or lower starting ECL as your own.  IE, if you start as
&gt;a human you can only change to other races with no racial HD and LA
&gt;+0, which makes about for a 1st or at most a 2nd level spell.
">

Which points to an obvious (imo) solution.  Polymorph should be broken
up ala Summon Monster et al.  It's also obvious that the metric of
Polymorph shouldn't be Hit Dice, but rather LA.

Therefore, Polymorph I should be a Sor/Wiz 2 spell and allow the
caster to change the subject into a creature with an LA difference of
0.  Polymorph II would be a Sor/Wiz 3 spell and allow an LA difference
of +/- 1.  Yes, plus or minus, this folds Polymorph and Baleful
Polymorph back into a single (sort of) spell and essentially balances
it in the same way as Polymorph would be.

Exactly. 2e did precisely nothing to address the major failures of

and confusion if used as reference books. I never bought a 2e book

brought back into the purchase-and-play category someone who had been
absent from D&amp;D's buyer base for over 10 years.

I haven't bought 3.5e as a set of rules because what I've heard about

I resisted upgrading for awhile, but eventually relented because of my
freelance work. I haven't regretted it, but swallowing the $90 cost of
the core rulebooks a second time was rough.

The better changes include:

- More utility in the MM. Having advanced versions of several monsters
statted up makes it remarkably easier to run stuff on the fly.

- Clarification of action types. The clear distinction between free,
swift, and immediate actions is wonderful (although this isn't
actually found in the core rulebooks).

- Making damage reduction meaningful and flavorful. It really was true
that in my 3.0 campaign DR essentially never served any function other
than to say "these monsters are way too tough for you guys", because
the PCs always had the necessary pluses on their weapons to overcome
the DRs of appropriate challenges (and, if they didn't, the DRs were
insanely high).

- Maintaining stat block compatibility. Yes, they changed the
mechanics of several classes. But you can still use stat blocks
generated under 3.0 with the 3.5 rules.

- You can even use the 3.0 versions of the classes which were changed,
but why you would want to is open for debate because they generally
improved them and fixed many of the weaker classes in 3.5.

- Weapon size mechanics: They not only make sense, they're also a lot
easier to use.

Things I don't like:

- Getting rid of partial actions. Defining swift and immediate actions
not only clarified things, it also opened up new design options.
Getting rid of partial actions, on the other hand, made things less
clear. There are far too many instances of "the character can only
perform a move or standard action, but not both or a full action" in
the rules now, when you used to be able to say "partial action" and
have that definitively defined system-wide. It also creates ridiculous
kludges like the new charge rules.

- Encouraging the "golf-bag of weapon types" through damage reduction.
I love the fact that they made DR flavorful and relevant. I hate the
fact that characters are encouraged to load up their bags of holding
with weapons of different types so that they can pull out the
appropriate weapon for ever DR-type they might run into. (The
subsequent creation of oils, creams, socketed gems, and the like are
kludgy patches.) Monte Cook's solution is quite elegant: It keeps the
flavor and relevance while still allowing PCs to work-around the DRs
without golf-bagging it. (It works even better if you go in and
restore 3.0's distinction between different magical pluses, expanding
3.5's simplification of DR X/magic. That way you get the best of all
worlds.)

- Making Crouching Tiger-style wuxia leaps difficult for the monk to
achieve (through changes to the class, the jump mechanics, and some
other changes throughout the system). Boo! (I removed their abundant
step ability and replaced it with a series of mechanics which let them
do wuxia-style jumps.)

- Getting rid of the Scry skill. Actually, I would have been okay with
the Scry skill going away, but its mechanics should have been subsumed
into the Spellcraft skill. Having it opposed in some way was an
important shift that needed to be happened, but I still would have
liked to see a skill component to scrying.

Most of my complaints are nitpicks. And it should be noted that there
were plenty of subtle improvements scattered throughout the rules,
too.

It took me a year to finally adopt 3.5, but in the three years since
then I can't say I've really regretted it (although my house rules are
larger under 3.5 than they were in 3.0).

I didn't see a lot of difference myself, but it did fix enough that I
went to it (hated the loose Monster Compendium though).  I really
loved specialty priests, and used them extensively.  I think it made a
huge difference in the campaign world.  Converting a character from 1e
to 2e was a snap, there's more difference between 3.0 and 3.5. I

It's not just an effect that is attractive, it's broken.  And any time

consideration however.  There are plenty of spells that don't have a

They've already broken down many spells in such a way, that IMHO

Incidentally, I changed DR X/magic so that each +1 reduces the DR by 5,
it's no longer binary.  This was a side effect of allowing '+0' weapons
IMC (no enhancement bonus, but does have weapon qualities -- you can
have a +0 flaming longsword or +0 ghost touch flail).

Very few of my house rules -- in the entirity of my KJD-IMC -- are

aren't as I want them, that don't support the style of play I'm looking
for, but by and large the base rule set works well.

(I'd intended to comment on this the first time but missed it).

I greatly preferred specialty priests to the default cleric class.  The
flavor was a big part of it, that they reduced the power somewhat was
also good.

3e clerics are much better than the 2e clerics, flavorwise.  IMO they
didn't go far enough, though.  I'd like to see the domains flavor the
class to a larger extent, but it's been pointed out to me that using
different but related classes can serve much the same goal, and that
prestige classes go a long way toward it.

Can you explain this? It seems to me that a monk who bothers to invest
in jump can make some pretty impressive leaps. A monk who doesn't can

It's a different matter that jumping in general is often of limited

well, I've got the RSRD in a binder, at least.  And I notice that most
OGC publishers seem to favor quantum printing for monsters (an integer
number of pages per entry).  Collecting monsters from a number of
sources into a single document now isn't so bad, and you can even keep
them in order.

One of my (outstanding) projects is to prepare an RSRD monster book
exactly like that.  Each monster starts on its own page (probably on the
'front'); just print what you need for the session, scribble all over it
during the session, copy any notes off, then toss it.  *Very* useful.

I was doing them more or less on an as-needed basis during 3.0, haven't
gotten around to updating or replacing them since.  It was a damn fine
way to use them, though.

Actually, despite the tweaking I've done (and an even greater amount
that I've written about) I'm pretty happy with how the game plays.  The
core mechanics are sound, the basics are easily understood and used.

If I were to do a 4e I'd probably want something like they did with
Fuzion, where there were entire subsystems that could be plugged in or
removed.  Want a game without spellcasting?  *done*.  Want multiple
types of spellcasting?  Okay, use this one and that one, ignore the
other.

I'm working toward that in my own design, actually.  Spellcasting is
largely universal now (it's all arcane), 'sorcery' isn't spellcasting so
much as spell-like abilities[1], 'divine magic' is based on channeling,
psionics use something based on Green Ronin's psychic system, and so on.

So, you can have a game with divine magic but not arcane (channeling but
no spellcasting), or just psychic power, or only bloodline magic, or
some combination of them.

[1] templates and feats, the exact powers available depends on your
bloodline

Apart from that, most of the changes I'd make are largely superficial,
categorization and the like.  For instance, there is a *huge* number of
[general] feats, but I can see clear subsets within those.  If you're
going to split them up at all (metamagic, item creation, wild, divine,
etc.), *split them up*.  I've added a bunch more categories of feats for
my campaign and use them when assigning feats to characters and when
designing classes.  I *could* say 'the Archer class gets feats chosen
from this list' and enumerate them, or just say 'the Archer gets bonus
[Ranged] feats'.

While special weapon properties such as silver, bludgeoning, or holy

Hmm... Now that I think about it, though, it might be more elegant to
combine the two approaches: Thus you get:

DR Type
/magic +1
/silver +2
/blugeoning, /piercing, /slashing +2
/adamantine, /cold iron +3
/[alignment] +4

For /magic DR, every +1 reduces the DR by 5 (so a +4 weapon would
reduce the DR by 20). For /silver DR, every +2 reduces the DR by 5 (so
a +4 weapon would reduce by the DR by 10). For /[alignment] DR, every
+4 reduces the DR by 5 (so a +4 weapon would reduce the DR by 5).

I think I had essentially no house rules for fixing broken or poor
rules in 3.0

- Paladins and monks can multiclass freely.
- Tripping is resolved as an opposed grapple check.
- Ranger receive the same bonus against all favored enemies.
- Dodge grants a flat +1 dodge bonus to AC.
- An alternate set of turning mechanics.

All of those house rules remain, because none of those things were
corrected in 3.5. (The type of stuff that 3.5 generally fixed were
minor inconveniences that never raised themselves to the level of
"this needs a houserule" while I was playing 3.5. In many cases I
didn't realize just how annoying they'd been until after they'd been
fixed, at which point I couldn't imagine going back.)

And then 3.5 added its own layer of house rules, mostly correcting for
stuff it had busted from 3.0:

- Jump skill DCs (3.5 made the skill easier to use in play, but busted
the DCs compared to other skills)
- Correcting DR (the 3.5 golf-bag problem is far more annoying than DR
being largely meaningless)
- Replacing the 3.0 cover rules (it wasn't busted, don't try to "fix"
it by stripping out features)

There's also a few things which I've added to my house rules since 3.5
came out which would have applied just as readily to 3.0:

- Fixing the save-or-die spells with a universal patch.
- Trying to fix polymorph.
- Generally working to tone down troublesome all-or-nothing abilities
(in a preparatory push to make play beyond level 20 possible without
the ugly kludges of the ELH).

So we're still talking about no more than five pages or so of house
rules (in a respectably large font and cushy lay-out for easy
referencing). That's still nothing compared to the 1.5" binder of
house rules I was running under 2nd Edition.

Now, that being said, my actual house rules are much longer than that:
Most of them are, in fact, entirely new rules rather than changes. For
example, I've got dozens of pages of new skill uses. I've got 60 pages
of rules covering aerial combat, mounted combat, and vehicles. Plus
the flavor stuff unique for each campaign setting, of course. But I
don't count any of that as a strike against the system. ;)

I find that allowing spontaneous domain casting does a really nice job
of bringing more domain flavor to the class. Here's the text from my
house rules:

CLERIC: Spontaneous Domain Casting (adapted from Unearthed Arcana)
Clerics do not get a daily domain spell slot. Instead, a cleric can
spontaneously cast any domain spell in place of a prepared spell of
the same level or higher. This functions identically with the cleric's
ability to spontaneously cast cure/inflict spells.
Healing Domain: Clerics with the healing domain can cast healing
spells using a d12 instead of a d8.

I think if you had alternative domain abilities which you could swap
out with "turn undead" (if so desired) you'd have more than enough
customizability to flavor the cleric class any way you wanted to.

That's basically the fix. This is what I've done:

·      At 7th level, monks get Leap of the Clouds (Ex). Their Jump checks
are made at x2.
·      At 12th level, monks get Greater Leap of the Clouds (Ex). The
vertical height of their long jumps can be any height up to one-
quarter of the horizontal distance (allowing them to skim the ground,
for example). Their high jumps are treated as if they were long jumps,
allowing the monk to jump in any direction as if they were making a
horizontal leap.
·      At 18th level, monks get Supreme Leap of the Clouds (Ex). Their Jump
checks are made at x3.
·      Monks no longer receive the Abundant Step ability at 12th level.

Seems to work pretty well.

It's not particularly powerful, but it makes the monks feel like
monks.

Seriously.  I would buy all the Monster Manuals over again if they were
issued with ONE monster per sheet in three-ring binders.  Toss in a
little artwork and statblocks for a handful of Advanced versions
(preferably one per size category), and I'd be in heaven...

Kind of makes me wonder whether an SRD-based book would be worth it.
Perhaps a user-supported document?

(*) But that's a rant for another day -- and one I'm sure has been
hashed to death in this newsgroup in the past.

&gt; While special weapon properties such as silver, bludgeoning, or holy

&gt; additional +2 damage.

Ah, right, I remember reading this.

It's workable, but I prefer that magic doesn't trump the other
requirements.  I like the feel of specific materials having greater
effect.

Also, once you've got +4, material and type are meaningless.  All it did
was shift the trump point.

&gt;&gt; Incidentally, I changed DR X/magic so that each +1 reduces the DR by 5,
&gt;&gt; it's no longer binary.

&gt; I like it.

&gt; Hmm... Now that I think about it, though, it might be more elegant to
&gt; combine the two approaches: Thus you get:

&gt; DR Type
&gt; /magic +1
&gt; /silver +2
&gt; /blugeoning, /piercing, /slashing +2
&gt; /adamantine, /cold iron +3
&gt; /[alignment] +4

&gt; For /magic DR, every +1 reduces the DR by 5 (so a +4 weapon would
&gt; reduce the DR by 20). For /silver DR, every +2 reduces the DR by 5 (so
&gt; a +4 weapon would reduce by the DR by 10). For /[alignment] DR, every
&gt; +4 reduces the DR by 5 (so a +4 weapon would reduce the DR by 5).

&gt; I'd want to play with the numbers to make sure there's nothing too
&gt; wonky going on there.
">

Interesting idea.  Personally I don't think I'd bother, but that's me.
What I do is:

DR Type          Magic does:
/magic           reduces by 5 per +1
/material        nothing
/type            nothing  (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing)
/alignment       nothing
/foo or magic    reduces by 5 per +1
/foo and magic   reduces by 5 per +1 if foo

So, a +4 weapon vs. a lesser demon (cold iron or magic) would reduce DR
by 20.  Against a greater demon (cold iron and magic) it'd have no
effect unless cold iron.

As I said, I *like* the specific materials to bypass DR, so I don't want
to allow magic to trump.

&gt;&gt; This was a side effect of allowing '+0' weapons
&gt;&gt; IMC (no enhancement bonus, but does have weapon qualities -- you can
&gt;&gt; have a +0 flaming longsword or +0 ghost touch flail).

&gt; I've never understood why that isn't just flat-out allowed in the core
&gt; rules. Does anyone have an explanation?
">

Perhaps because '+0' confused people?  Or maybe had undesired side
effects on weapon costs (ghost touch is an 8k weapon because you need +1
as well, rather than just 2k) or availability (by requiring +1 you need a
crafter of at least third level -- though you need that anyway for Craft
Magical Arms &amp; Armor, RAW).

Me, I like having +0 weapons with special qualities, so I changed it.
Which as I said led to changing DR/magic.

&gt; Yeah. And I really don't think Alchemy should be using the Craft

I didn't really consider it.  If I were reworking magic item creation to
include skill use I'd want it for Brew Potion.

Of course, I'm not happy with how the Craft rules work in the first

&gt;&gt; &gt; It took me a year to finally adopt 3.5, but in the three years since
&gt;&gt; &gt; then I can't say I've really regretted it (although my house rules are
&gt;&gt; &gt; larger under 3.5 than they were in 3.0).

&gt;&gt; How many are because things are broken, though, compared to how many are
&gt;&gt; because things don't suit the flavor you're looking for?

&gt; I think I had essentially no house rules for fixing broken or poor
&gt; rules in 3.0

&gt; - Paladins and monks can multiclass freely.
">

I did this as long as 'it worked'.  Paladin and fighter, paladin and
cleric, both were quite valid for any paladin.  Anything else 'required'
that the class taken fit the religion -- paladin and wizard was quite
all right for a god of magic but maybe not for a god of war.

&gt; All of those house rules remain, because none of those things were
&gt; corrected in 3.5. (The type of stuff that 3.5 generally fixed were
&gt; minor inconveniences that never raised themselves to the level of
&gt; &quot;this needs a houserule&quot; while I was playing 3.5. In many cases I
&gt; didn't realize just how annoying they'd been until after they'd been
&gt; fixed, at which point I couldn't imagine going back.)
">

Heh, yeah.  Though some things stood out for me from the beginning (DR
being one of them, but we've talked about that).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And then 3.5 added its own layer of house rules, mostly correcting for
&gt; stuff it had busted from 3.0:

&gt; - Jump skill DCs (3.5 made the skill easier to use in play, but busted
&gt; the DCs compared to other skills)
&gt; - Correcting DR (the 3.5 golf-bag problem is far more annoying than DR
&gt; being largely meaningless)
&gt; - Replacing the 3.0 cover rules (it wasn't busted, don't try to &quot;fix&quot;
&gt; it by stripping out features)
">

Jump so infrequently came up I didn't even notice.  I like the new DR
(except for magic), cover I think we kept the same because we didn't see
that it changed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There's also a few things which I've added to my house rules since 3.5
&gt; came out which would have applied just as readily to 3.0:

&gt; - Fixing the save-or-die spells with a universal patch.

This is a good idea.  A friend's running us through Return to Castle
Ravenloft starting in a few weeks and has been going through replacing
the uses of save or die spells with something else.

That is a good idea.  I've never been really happy with ELH.  My natural
inclination is to continue progression the obvious way, but the divides
between characters become too great.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So we're still talking about no more than five pages or so of house
&gt; rules (in a respectably large font and cushy lay-out for easy
&gt; referencing). That's still nothing compared to the 1.5&quot; binder of
&gt; house rules I was running under 2nd Edition.
">

Much of my 'house rules' is just trying to collate the extra stuff
(feats, classes, spells, etc.) I allow.

Despite appearances, much of my KJD-IMC material doesn't see play.  I
like the ideas, but getting them past my players would be problematic.
Allowing more stuff?  Fine.  Changing stuff?  Not so fine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, that being said, my actual house rules are much longer than that:
&gt; Most of them are, in fact, entirely new rules rather than changes. For
&gt; example, I've got dozens of pages of new skill uses. I've got 60 pages
&gt; of rules covering aerial combat, mounted combat, and vehicles. Plus
&gt; the flavor stuff unique for each campaign setting, of course. But I
&gt; don't count any of that as a strike against the system. ;)
">

Nah, flavor stuff doesn't even count as house rules IMO.

&gt;&gt; 3e clerics are much better than the 2e clerics, flavorwise.  IMO they

&gt;&gt; different but related classes can serve much the same goal, and that

&gt; I find that allowing spontaneous domain casting does a really nice job
&gt; of bringing more domain flavor to the class. Here's the text from my
&gt; house rules:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think if you had alternative domain abilities which you could swap
&gt; out with &quot;turn undead&quot; (if so desired) you'd have more than enough
&gt; customizability to flavor the cleric class any way you wanted to.
">

I started doing this before UA came out -- google 'cleric kjd-imc' and I
think you'll find it.

Basically, lose spontaneous casting of cure/inflict, gain spontaneous
casting of spells from your chosen domains.

My current take on clerics is:

. reduce class skill list; each domain has skills that get added to your
class list;
. lose spontaneous casting of cure/inflict; gain spontaneous casting of
spells from your two chosen domains (keep the 'domain slot', but fold
it in with the rest of the spell slots);
. keep cleric class spell list (obscenely) large, but knowledge is
limited as a wizard -- learn two spells at each level (chosen domain
spells first), may learn additional spells by expending 20XP per spell
level and one day in prayer;
. replace 'Turn Undead' with 'Channel Divine Power', domains and feats
provide applications of this ability.  (I posted about this a few
weeks ago; it's written up at
http://www.kjdavies.org/wiki/index.php/Divine_Channeling )

(I'm probably dumping 'class skills' altogether, going with something
more like Iron Heroes -- all skills are class skills, with feats
allowing improvement of all skills in a group for a single point.  If I
do this I'll probably have the 'domain skills' get a bonus instead.)

I've considered some other changes like 'War domain gives you fighter
BAB progression' but ended up not doing that.
