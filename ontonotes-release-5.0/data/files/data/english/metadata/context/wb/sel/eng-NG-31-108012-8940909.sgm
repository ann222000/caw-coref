I have been on a sort of a crusade lately to make all the foods my
mom made for us when we were kids. None of my siblings has any
interest in cooking, and I don't want my mom's recipes to die out
when she dies.  She's been having a blast teaching me over the phone
to make knaedlach (matzoh-ball) soup, lasagna, pot roast, and on and
on.

There's one dish, though, that was one of my very favorites when I
was a child that I haven't asked her about: Chicken and rice.

The reason I haven't asked her is that I knew the recipe involved at
least one can of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup. Oy.

It's worse than that, as it turns out:  One can EACH of cream of
mushroom, cream of chicken, and cream of celery.

I bit the bullet and bought the stuff.  I will certainly find the
resulting casserole too salty, but I'm eager to see if I can
recreate my mom's one really trashy offering. Mostly, she cooked
delicious foods from scratch, and still does.  Tomorrow night,
though, we're having chicken and rice, and I don't care who knows
it. :-)

(Baking dish. Six chicken thighs.  Garlic powder. A layer of sliced
onions.  Pour a mixture of the soup, some pepper, 3 cans of water, 3
cans of milk, and 2 cups of uncooked white rice on top. Sprinkle
paprika on top. Bake at 350F for 45-60 minutes, until the chicken
doesn't bleed when you pierce it.)

It is nice that you are treasuring your mother's recipes. One of my
friends went to her family reunion and everyone contributed recipes from
their parents and grandparents.  They put these recipes in a cookbook,
so everybody at the family reunion would have a copy.  I was not there,
but she gave a copy (they had a minimum number of cookbooks they had to
purchase).

I applaud your effort to preserve your mother's recipes.  I did the same
with mine over the years and was very grateful that I did when she passed
away suddenly.

There's certainly nothing wrong with using condensed soups as bases for
other dishes.  There are several I use from time to time, and the dishes
that use them would simply not be the same if I labored through duplicating
the effect of the condensed soup.

Make it and enjoy!!!

Buy the low-salt versions.  You'll soon find out it is waaay too low salt.
So add sea salt.  You can compensate.  Apparently this is what professional
chefs do.  Although frankly, I have no idea why anyone thinks sea salt is
lower in sodium than salt mined from inland seas.  After all, they were seas
once.

Salt is salt, IMHO.  They certainly charge much more for coloured crystals
ground and called &quot;sea salt&quot;.  But if you look at salt from places like
where Tabasco sauce is made in Louisiana, the salt used to make it comes
from very deep salt caves.  Sea salt.  It's not blue.  It's not black.  It's
not pink.  It's pure white salt.

Go ahead!  Pay more for all this other stuff if The Food Network tells you
to.  Meanwhile I'll buy regular sea salt.

Who cares what &quot;they&quot; think?  I've been cooking with canned soups or years.
I could not make a decent tuna noodle casserole or chicken noodle casserole
without them.  Talk about comfort food.  I've cooked TNC at 3 am when I
needed something warm, tasty and pleasing to make me feel better about the
shithole that life can sometimes turn into.  I owe my life to cream of
mushroom soup!  I admit it!!  I am glad I have a pantry full of the stuff.

So eat, enjoy, and remember that food stimulates the endorphins like nothing
else.

My chocken and rice recipe:

1 large can (family size) CoM soup
4 half chicken breasts
water
butter
2 cups long grain rice
chicken bouillion if desired

Quickly brown the chicken in butter in a high sided skillet, remove from
skillet.  Add 1 and a 3/4 cup water, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, stir,
when hot add 2 cups uncooked rice.  Add the breasts, cover, simmer on low
for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and let rest for 15 minutes.

Simple food is good food.

That could have been a tragic loss. Almost the same thing happened to DH.
When he was having a yard sale for his dad, a guy came up and handed DH a
box and said, &quot; I don't believe you want to get rid of this.&quot;  It was a
boxed album of family pictures.  Each one was a studio picture of yet
another person. It was held together by a nice clip and opened like a book
with every picture and frame the same size and type - lovely.  The pictures
must've been taken in the late 1800's; some not identified as yet.

However, DH's mother's recipes *had* to be scanned because they were in such
bad shape, dirty and buggy and -- well you can imagine.  But they were
scanned, put on CD and passed out to family.

I know that you miss that box.  Something to hold on to.

Your husband was very lucky to have that pointed out.  And it's certainly
nice to have those old recipes.  Back in the 1930s my grandmother had a
couple of her recipes published in a local newspaper.  I have those
clippings.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, I tend to hold on, perhaps some might say to the point of being
morbid.  I have my mother's &quot;highly decorative&quot; cedar chest (some would say
&quot;hope chest&quot;) that holds many of her personal items.  I don't even recall
all the contents, but I do remember a silver fox jacket from the 1940s, a
few pieces of good jewelry and a sterling silver dresser set. Perhaps my
worst &quot;hold on&quot; is a beautiful red wool coat that she bought a couple of
years before she passed away, that had become her favorite.  It hangs in a
garment bag in a seldom used closet.

I guess I'm just weird. :-)

My mom always made a dish like that, Serene.  She called it Chicken Noel -
don't know why!  She would brown the chicken in a skillet and while that was
browning she would mix up a can of cream of mushroom soup, milk, and about
1/4 cup of sherry.  Then she'd put the chicken in a baking dish and smother
it with the sauce to serve over rice.  I always would rather have the rice
and sauce instead of the chicken.  Don't feel bad.  :~)

Chicken-Rice Dinner

Recipe By:  posted to rec.food.cooking by Barb Schaller, 10-10-07
Serving Size:  4
Preparation Time: 0:00
Categories: Entrees

Amount   Measure  Ingredient  Preparation Method
3/4   cup   white rice
1  can   cream of celery soup
1  can   cream of chicken soup
1/2      soup can milk
Frying chicken pieces
Melted butter (may be omitted)
Parsley flakes

Butter a 1-1/2 quart rectangular baking dish (or a 9x13² pan) and
sprinkle rice in it.  In a bowl, combine the cream soups and milk,
stirring until smooth.  Pour over rice.  Lay chicken pieces, skin side
up, on top.  Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with parsley flakes,
if desired.  Cover tightly with foil or a tight-fitting cover.  Bake

Extra good if you add mushrooms and slivered almonds to the soups.  No
need for potatoes and gravy as rice takes their place.

After you've made it and have a baseline, you can try to modify the
recipe while still capturing the essentials. I've replaced the &quot;can of
cream of X&quot; in recipes with white sauces or velotes, pretty
successfully.

A sauce with fresh mushrooms and celery cooked in butter or olive oil,
with flour to make a roux, then some chicken broth and milk or cream
might substitute for the trio of soups.

Thanks to this thread and one other, I have started a document with
easy chicken recipes. I think they sound good and I will have fun
experimenting with them!!! I love chicken and rice! I don't mind
cooking with condensed soups, at all. I don't do it often, but I don't
mind it. I always add a slosh of sherry or white wine... a trick my
father taught me.

So thanks!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; My mom had a lovely cedar file card box that was chock full of her
&gt;&gt;&gt; recipes. When she passed away, the box passed to me.  Luckily, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; decided to scan  all the recipes for ease of use on the PC.  Last year
&gt;&gt;&gt; my partner inadvertantly threw the whole thing out with the trash.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt; miss that box, even though I have the recipes.

&gt;&gt; Of course you do! I don't have my mother's recipe box, but I do have
&gt;&gt; some of her recipes handwritten on 3x5 cards. So far I've resisted
&gt;&gt; scanning them, but they're getting so full of food spots that they're
&gt;&gt; hard to read!

&gt;&gt; Felice

&gt; Scan them, spots and all.   At least you'll have a backup, Felice.

&gt; &gt; Who cares what &quot;they&quot; think?  I've been cooking with canned soups or
years.
&gt; &gt; I could not make a decent tuna noodle casserole or chicken noodle
casserole
&gt; &gt; without them.  Talk about comfort food.  I've cooked TNC at 3 am when I
&gt; &gt; needed something warm, tasty and pleasing to make me feel better about
the
&gt; &gt; shithole that life can sometimes turn into.  I owe my life to cream of
&gt; &gt; mushroom soup!  I admit it!!  I am glad I have a pantry full of the
stuff.

&gt;    Your addiction to cream of mushroom soup  is surely the direct cause
&gt; of your insomnia and life problems. Get help before it's too late. And
&gt; remember, going cold turkey is not an excuse to pour on some cream of

I am not addicted, I can quit any time I want.

With all that rice, it might *not* be too salty.  But are you sure the

&gt; It is nice that you are treasuring your mother's recipes. One of my

At the funeral where I took all those deviled eggs last week, the family

found all the cake recipes that were submitted by Elenore (woman who

cakes from the cookbook, then set them out on the serving table with
little cards in front with the recipe names -- &quot;Aunt Ruby's Fresh Apple
Cake&quot; and &quot;LazyDazy Cake&quot; sort of names -- and didn't say anything.

About an hour into the meal, the family figured out what the name cards
were all about.  It meant a whole lot to some of the sisters and daughters.

Whoever thought of doing that was very thoughtful. It was meaningful for

&gt; If salt is salt, why not plain ol' generic store brand salt in the

Tell you what I use, Diamond Crystal Popcorn salt for table salting.
The finer the grind, the better.  For adding to food while cooking, I
currently have Reese sea salt, but I usually buy Baliene (sp?) fine
ground.
I buy the grey sea salt from Penzey's but that's only for snacking on
straight.  No point in putting salt with trace impurities on food.
That pink stuff my nephew buys is nice to do straight too.  My take on
&quot;Kosher salt&quot; is Why TF is it recommended in so many recipes?  Is it
like circumcision?  I knew that because so many physicians were
Jewish*, that circumcision became the norm in America, but is it the
same with the recipe writers?  Maybe no one questions the whole Kosher
salt thing because they don't want to seem anti-Semitic.?  You think?
Damn, the only difference is that it measures a bit differently,
right?  Why specify it in recipes where the salt ends up dissolving
anyway?

* My doctor is Jewish, and I really like him, not just as a doctor,
but I think he's a great person too, in case anyone wants to call me
anti-Jewish.
