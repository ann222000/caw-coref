*He'll rip your lungs out, Jim*
(I'd like to meet his tailor)

Finally, some responsible journalism! This just in from On the Internet,
Nobody Knows You're a
Werewolf&lt; http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2007/04/4039_haters_on_t... &gt;(Mother
Jones/MoJo Blog)...

*"What's disturbing is that it's not just peripheral geeks like RageBoy who
turn into werewolves behind the privacy of their own PCs."*

I was going to write more about this, but I got so excited on learning the
Real Truthâ„¢ that I had to stop and file down my incisors. btw, for the
uninitiated, what you're seeing here is variously called irony, satire,
parody. That means you shouldn't actually take it at face value. However,
only really mean
kids&lt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393308065/ref=nosim/entropygr... &gt;use
this sort of trope, so I guess I should apologize for my title slug,
even though I didn't write it. (Is there an echo in here?) However, Warren
Zevon should clearly be denounced for threatening poor Jim like that! I'm
ashamed to speak the same language.
