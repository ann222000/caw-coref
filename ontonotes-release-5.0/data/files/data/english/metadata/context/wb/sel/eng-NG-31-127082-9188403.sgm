Hello,

I know I'm not a regular here, but I badly need advice on what to do.
I'm fairly shy, awkward in talking to people, and now I think I need
to communicate something very delicate to a friend of mine.

I would particually welcome advice from females, especially women who
have been in various relationships with men and so have experience on
what is what in these things.

I know I'm not the best at broaching sensitive issues eg: emotional,
sexual, personal, and so I am worrying about what I should say.

I'm 20, male, and my friend is 28, female. This may be part of the
problem, I don't know.

My friend is shy, non-talkative, I think I'm the only person she
really talks to in class. I think she feels isolated and lonely, I
would love to get to know her better and be a true friend to her. On
the other hand, I wonder if she is manipulating me.

I've written this email below to my friend, but haven't sent it to her
yet. I want to know what you think of it, of me and her. I don't want
to offend this person, I want to be her friend, but I'm worried that
she may misinterpret my intention and ignore me, or worse, become an
enemy of me.

I will have to sit near or next to her for another 4 years of college!
I don't need complications with people I'll be meeting everyday.

On the other hand, I think what we do have will evaporate if things
keep going on the way that they are.

Please read this, and give me an opinion, advice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------

Subject: Name of person. If indeed that is your real name. :-|

Name of person,

After reading this email, I don't know whether you will be upset/angry
with me, or whether you simply won't give a shit. But these things
need to be said so we understand each other. If you just don't read
this email at all, then I'll simply take it that you're not interested
in being friends and don't care.

I'm more than a little hurt. Do you want to know why? I would like you
to imagine me talking to you right now, saying the words of this
email. I am not shouting or ranting at you, I am not angry with you,
I'm simply talking to you like normal. Not really normal, because I'm
feeling sad, but in a normal voice.
The subject is simple. I'm a friend to you, and you are not to me.

I don't know why this is, I've tried to befriend you as much as I'm
able. I sent lengthy emails explaining what I'm thinking, who I am and
more. I talk to you about various things to you directly, I know I'm
not the most adept communicator, I often either talk nonsense or
misinterpret things. My point here is that, even though I'm not a
perfect person, I am trying to be friendly here. Sometimes I don't
know whether I'm slightly deaf, or your voice pitch is too low. You
know I don't always understand what you say, albeit that I want to.
You speak perfect english, so it is not a lingustic problem. This
might very well be my fault, I don't know.

But that is not really why I am fustrated. I know you dislike ******,
so I'm loathe to use her as an example, but to be perfectly brutally
honest with you, I know as much about her after chatting for 5 mins,
than I do with talking &amp; typing to you at length for well over 5
weeks. ******* is not excatly the most talkative person the world
either. Neither am I, I'm not calling it a character flaw. Like I've
said before, the ****** are naturally quieter.

Here is excatly what is going through my mind right now. I am going to
be honest with you, there is little point in lying to you or as
importantly, to myself. They may be my darker moments, but it makes
them no less possibly true. Personally, in the not-so-distant past,
ie: 16 years old, 17 years old, 18 years old. I've been guilty of (4),
(5),(6) and (7), so there is an element of &quot;been there, done that&quot;
with me.

I'm 20 years of age by the way, in case you were wondering.

Either it is the case that:

(1)
You are using me as some kind of human postbox, to collect information
you need that you should be getting in college. ie: exam times, work
material uploading.

or/and

(2)
You don't like me, and simply put up with me, just another chore that
you seem to have to cope with in college.

or/and

(3)
You believe that men are only interested in knowing you for your body
ie: to fuck. Perhaps you're afraid of being friendly because you think
I'll take it as being a &quot;come-on&quot;. I know some men of which it's true,
but I assure you not all of us are like that. I'm not that shallow.
I'm sure you have a husband who loves you very much, and I'd never
seek to do anything to come between you. I want to be your friend in
the platonic sense only ie: non-sexual. Literal friends.

or/and

(4)
You simply aren't interested in having a friend.

or/and

(5)
You're introverted to a large degree, and therefore are feel suspect
of any kind of interaction with others. ie: you don't trust people
very easily.

or/and

(6)
You are depressed, you feel down and so aren't disposed to being more
open.

or/and

(7)
You are a snob, you feel that myself, the rest of ***** are a pack of
halfwits and therefore aren't good enough for you.

or/and

(8)
You see me as a child, hardly worthy of concern or serious
consideration.

I could go on, but you get the idea. I genuinely desire to be your
friend. I am finding it hard  because you don't really 'interact' with
me. I know nothing about you, although I very much want to.

I don't know *********, I don't know how she thinks or what she thinks
about. You're a closed book.

I do know these things about you.

- You like reading, especially detective books.

- You are from ****** in ******.

- You are married.

- You aren't a party animal.

- You don't like to eat sweets.

- You want to ********  to make some money for yourself.

- You live in ****** somewhere.

- You like rock music.

- You dislike *****.

- You are getting into sudoku.

That is it. I would say about 6 of those you actually told me
yourself, everything else being stuff I infered or guessed.

And I had to seriously sit down and think about you to remember all of
those. So I learn about 1 and a half things about you a week. What
would you write if you wrote a similar list about me?

I'd like to have a friend, I'd like to be your friend specifically. It
is very simple, being alone is lonely and depressing. It would be nice
to see a friendly face each day I go to college, just someone to talk
to about anything in particular. Basically just to have someone(s) who
actually give a crap about you. I do care enough to write this. I
don't do this lightly at all. It is not weakness on my part, I'm
saying I'm human, I'm not made of wood. You surely cannot be either.

I feel that there is a lot more to you than meets the eye, but I don't
know if that 'lot more' is good or bad. Some people are strong inside
but seem unimpressive externally. Some people are weak but seem
wonderful on the outside. I'm basically talking about your true
nature, your true colours, your character. It takes time for this to
become obvious. I know that some of ******* seem weak on the outside,
but will become powerful indivduals when they mature. People need a
chance, you know?

On the other hand, I intensely dislike being manipulated. I do not
like being used by people. I do not mind doing favours for friends,
that is just social networking, the give and take of friendship.
Sometimes our friends need help, sometimes we need theirs. However our
'friendship', if it is that, is highly one-sided.

I hope you see where I'm coming from. Maybe you have friends outside
college and they are enough for you. Maybe you think this is stupid
and now you have a smirk on your face. Maybe I've offended you,
although this isn't even remotely my intention. At this point I don't
care. Either you are a friend, or you are not. It is your choice.

Did you read the email?

She is married, and as importantly, I don't want to have sex with her.
She is not unattractive, but it would be no good for either of us if
we went down that route.

Sex is quite nice, but I need a friend, not a girlfriend.

Like what? What are these 'steps'? I really don't want her to confuse
friendlyness with a come-on.

But sending lengthy mails and caring whether she

How? I care about her. How do I communicate that to her? Do you think
I shouldn't? If so, why not? How the hell does she know If I actually

I have sent lengthy emails to her before, but nothing like what I have
above. Should I stop?

Help !!

Your email is creepy. You're not being honest with yourself either as to
what you want.

The kind of emotional bond you seem to want with this woman just isn't
appropriate to be having with a married woman. Doubly so since she
obviously is distancing herself from you. You really should let the whole
thing go.

I am a female. My advice is don't send her the email. Most people are
not into/nor capable of reading anything longer than a few sentences.
If you send her such a lengthy &quot;heartfelt&quot; email more than likely she
won't even read it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Doubt it. I think more of the problem is she is married, and you are
single.

Manipulating you in what way? You didn't really lay that out in your

If you send her the email, and she does actually read it, I am
guessing she will end up ignoring you. She will probably also be
pissed at you for trying to push your type of &quot;friendship&quot; on her.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I will have to sit near or next to her for another 4 years of college!
&gt;I don't need complications with people I'll be meeting everyday.
">

If you don't need complications with her -- don't send the email. Just
leave things as they are. Obviously you have a different definition of
friendship than she does.

As Troll stated correctly:

&quot;Friendship is something that happens. You don't &quot;negotiate&quot; it.
&quot;Working for it&quot; the way you intend to is complication, if something
doesn't work, don't try to push it out of proportion.&quot;

Good advice. You should listen to it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;On the other hand, I think what we do have will evaporate if things
&gt;keep going on the way that they are.
">

If your friendship evaporates, then it evaporates. Kind of sucky, but
sometimes it is what it is.

I'll be honest with you, I recommend you do not purposely seek out
married women for friendships. If your female friend is acting distant
from you, it could be because she may be uncomfortable being around
you -- a single guy. For the  &quot;normal&quot; single man, trying to maintain
friendships with &quot;normal&quot; single women are tough enough -- with
married older women you have the whole husband, children, home, family
issues.

Hey, I am just grasping at straws here.

Anyway, you are only 20, this time next year you will wonder why you
ever worried about losing your friendship with this woman.

Just my opinion. Good or bad.

&gt; &quot;Friendship is something that happens. You don't &quot;negotiate&quot; it.
&gt; &quot;Working for it&quot; the way you intend to is complication, if something
&gt; doesn't work, don't try to push it out of proportion.&quot;

&gt; Good advice. You should listen to it.

&gt; &gt;On the other hand, I think what we do have will evaporate if things
&gt; &gt;keep going on the way that they are.

&gt; If your friendship evaporates, then it evaporates. Kind of sucky, but
&gt; sometimes it is what it is.

&gt; I'll be honest with you, I recommend you do not purposely seek out
&gt; married women for friendships. If your female friend is acting distant
&gt; from you, it could be because she may be uncomfortable being around
&gt; you -- a single guy. For the  &quot;normal&quot; single man, trying to maintain
&gt; friendships with &quot;normal&quot; single women are tough enough -- with
&gt; married older women you have the whole husband, children, home, family
&gt; issues.

&gt; Hey, I am just grasping at straws here.

&gt; Anyway, you are only 20, this time next year you will wonder why you
&gt; ever worried about losing your friendship with this woman.

&gt; Just my opinion. Good or bad.

How? I care about her. How do I communicate that to her? Do you think
I shouldn't? If so, why not? How the hell does she know If I actually
give a crap about her?
I have sent lengthy emails to her before, but nothing like what I have
above. Should I stop?

Help !!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You must stop communicating to her. Give a distance on both of you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I know I'm not a regular here, but I badly need advice on what to
&gt; do.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm fairly shy, awkward in talking to people, and now I think I need
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to communicate something very delicate to a friend of mine.

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is a bad idea.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want to fuck her, take the steps towards it.

&gt; &gt; Did you read the email?

&gt; &gt; She is married, and as importantly, I don't want to have sex with her.
&gt; &gt; She is not unattractive, but it would be no good for either of us if
&gt; &gt; we went down that route.

&gt; &gt; Sex is quite nice, but I need a friend, not a girlfriend.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want to be her
&gt; &gt;&gt; friend, the same applies.

&gt; &gt; Like what? What are these 'steps'? I really don't want her to confuse
&gt; &gt; friendlyness with a come-on.

&gt; &gt; But sending lengthy mails and caring whether she
&gt; &gt;&gt; is depressed or no will get you shot down for good.

&gt; &gt; How? I care about her. How do I communicate that to her? Do you think
&gt; &gt; I shouldn't? If so, why not? How the hell does she know If I actually
&gt; &gt; give a crap about her?
&gt; &gt; I have sent lengthy emails to her before, but nothing like what I have
&gt; &gt; above. Should I stop?

&gt; &gt; Help !!

&gt; Ok, here is the small talk:

&gt; Friendship is something that happens. You don't &quot;negotiate&quot; it. &quot;Working
&gt; for it&quot; the way you intend to is complication, if something doesn't work,
&gt; don't try to push it out of proportion.

Good advice

I wouldn't send the email, if you are worried about her you could
include her more in group conversations and work groups.
It sounds like you are the shy one, try to throw yourself into the
activities surrounding college and enjoying it,meet lots of people
Start a work group - that way you talk about the course and gradually
build confidence to talk about other things.

College at  28 is a different experience from when you are 20, at 20
it tends to take up most of your time (enjoy it) while she has an
outside life and will probably not participate if activities outside
the course.
best of luck

&gt; &gt; I would particually welcome advice from females, especially women who
&gt; &gt; have been in various relationships with men and so have experience on
&gt; &gt; what is what in these things.

&gt; &gt; I know I'm not the best at broaching sensitive issues eg: emotional,
&gt; &gt; sexual, personal, and so I am worrying about what I should say.

&gt; &gt; I'm 20, male, and my friend is 28, female. This may be part of the
&gt; &gt; problem, I don't know.

&gt; &gt; My friend is shy, non-talkative, I think I'm the only person she
&gt; &gt; really talks to in class. I think she feels isolated and lonely, I
&gt; &gt; would love to get to know her better and be a true friend to her. On
&gt; &gt; the other hand, I wonder if she is manipulating me.

&gt; &gt; I've written this email below to my friend, but haven't sent it to her
&gt; &gt; yet. I want to know what you think of it, of me and her. I don't want
&gt; &gt; to offend this person, I want to be her friend, but I'm worried that
&gt; &gt; she may misinterpret my intention and ignore me, or worse, become an
&gt; &gt; enemy of me.

&gt; &gt; I will have to sit near or next to her for another 4 years of college!
&gt; &gt; I don't need complications with people I'll be meeting everyday.

&gt; &gt; On the other hand, I think what we do have will evaporate if things
&gt; &gt; keep going on the way that they are.

&gt; &gt; Please read this, and give me an opinion, advice.
&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ­-------------------------------------------------------

&gt; &gt; Subject: Name of person. If indeed that is your real name. :-|

&gt; &gt; Name of person,

&gt; &gt; After reading this email, I don't know whether you will be upset/angry
&gt; &gt; with me, or whether you simply won't give a shit. But these things
&gt; &gt; need to be said so we understand each other. If you just don't read
&gt; &gt; this email at all, then I'll simply take it that you're not interested
&gt; &gt; in being friends and don't care.

&gt; &gt; I'm more than a little hurt. Do you want to know why? I would like you
&gt; &gt; to imagine me talking to you right now, saying the words of this
&gt; &gt; email. I am not shouting or ranting at you, I am not angry with you,
&gt; &gt; I'm simply talking to you like normal. Not really normal, because I'm
&gt; &gt; feeling sad, but in a normal voice.
&gt; &gt; The subject is simple. I'm a friend to you, and you are not to me.

&gt; &gt; I don't know why this is, I've tried to befriend you as much as I'm
&gt; &gt; able. I sent lengthy emails explaining what I'm thinking, who I am and
&gt; &gt; more. I talk to you about various things to you directly, I know I'm
&gt; &gt; not the most adept communicator, I often either talk nonsense or
&gt; &gt; misinterpret things. My point here is that, even though I'm not a
&gt; &gt; perfect person, I am trying to be friendly here. Sometimes I don't
&gt; &gt; know whether I'm slightly deaf, or your voice pitch is too low. You
&gt; &gt; know I don't always understand what you say, albeit that I want to.
&gt; &gt; You speak perfect english, so it is not a lingustic problem. This
&gt; &gt; might very well be my fault, I don't know.

&gt; &gt; But that is not really why I am fustrated. I know you dislike ******,
&gt; &gt; so I'm loathe to use her as an example, but to be perfectly brutally
&gt; &gt; honest with you, I know as much about her after chatting for 5 mins,
&gt; &gt; than I do with talking &amp; typing to you at length for well over 5
&gt; &gt; weeks. ******* is not excatly the most talkative person the world
&gt; &gt; either. Neither am I, I'm not calling it a character flaw. Like I've
&gt; &gt; said before, the ****** are naturally quieter.

&gt; &gt; Here is excatly what is going through my mind right now. I am going to
&gt; &gt; be honest with you, there is little point in lying to you or as
&gt; &gt; importantly, to myself. They may be my darker moments, but it makes
&gt; &gt; them no less possibly true. Personally, in the not-so-distant past,
&gt; &gt; ie: 16 years old, 17 years old, 18 years old. I've been guilty of (4),
&gt; &gt; (5),(6) and (7), so there is an element of &quot;been there, done that&quot;
&gt; &gt; with me.

&gt; &gt; I'm 20 years of age by the way, in case you were wondering.

&gt; &gt; Either it is the case that:

&gt; &gt; (1)
&gt; &gt; You are using me as some kind of human postbox, to collect information
&gt; &gt; you need that you should be getting in college. ie: exam times, work
&gt; &gt; material uploading.

&gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; (2)
&gt; &gt; You don't like me, and simply put up with me, just another chore that
&gt; &gt; you seem to have to cope with in college.

&gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; (3)
&gt; &gt; You believe that men are only interested in knowing you for your body
&gt; &gt; ie: to fuck. Perhaps you're afraid of being friendly because you think
&gt; &gt; I'll take it as being a &quot;come-on&quot;. I know some men of which it's true,
&gt; &gt; but I assure you not all of us are like that. I'm not that shallow.
&gt; &gt; I'm sure you have a husband who loves you very much, and I'd never
&gt; &gt; seek to do anything to come between you. I want to be your friend in
&gt; &gt; the platonic sense only ie: non-sexual. Literal friends.

&gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; (4)
&gt; &gt; You simply aren't interested in having a friend.

&gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; (5)
&gt; &gt; You're introverted to a large degree, and therefore are feel suspect
&gt; &gt; of any kind of interaction with others. ie: you don't trust people
&gt; &gt; very easily.

&gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; (6)
&gt; &gt; You are depressed, you feel down and so aren't disposed to being more
&gt; &gt; open.

&gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; (7)
&gt; &gt; You are a snob, you feel that myself, the rest of ***** are a pack of
&gt; &gt; halfwits and therefore aren't good enough for you.

&gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; (8)
&gt; &gt; You see me as a child, hardly worthy of concern or serious
&gt; &gt; consideration.

&gt; &gt; I could go on, but you get the idea. I genuinely desire to be your
&gt; &gt; friend. I am finding it hard  because you don't really 'interact' with
&gt; &gt; me. I know nothing about you, although I very much want to.

&gt; &gt; I don't know *********, I don't know how she thinks or what she thinks
&gt; &gt; about. You're a closed book.

&gt; &gt; I do know these things about you.

&gt; &gt; - You like reading, especially detective books.

&gt; &gt; - You are from ****** in ******.

&gt; &gt; - You are married.

&gt; &gt; - You aren't a party animal.

&gt; &gt; - You don't like to eat sweets.

&gt; &gt; - You want to ********  to make some money for yourself.

&gt; &gt; - You live in ****** somewhere.

&gt; &gt; - You like rock music.

&gt; &gt; - You dislike *****.

&gt; &gt; - You are getting into sudoku.

&gt; &gt; That is it. I would say about 6 of those you actually told me
&gt; &gt; yourself, everything else being stuff I infered or guessed.

&gt; &gt; And I had to seriously sit down and think about you to remember all of
&gt; &gt; those. So I learn about 1 and a half things about you a week. What
&gt; &gt; would you write if you wrote a similar list about me?

&gt; &gt; I'd like to have a friend, I'd like to be your friend specifically. It
&gt; &gt; is very simple, being alone is lonely and depressing. It would be nice
&gt; &gt; to see a friendly face each day I go to college, just someone to talk
&gt; &gt; to about anything in particular. Basically just to have someone(s) who
&gt; &gt; actually give a crap about you. I do care enough to write this. I
&gt; &gt; don't do this lightly at all. It is not weakness on my part, I'm
&gt; &gt; saying I'm human, I'm not made of wood. You surely cannot be either.

&gt; &gt; I feel that there is a lot more to you than meets the eye, but I don't
&gt; &gt; know if that 'lot more' is good or bad. Some people are strong inside
&gt; &gt; but seem unimpressive externally. Some people are weak but seem
&gt; &gt; wonderful on the outside. I'm basically talking about your true
&gt; &gt; nature, your true colours, your character. It takes time for this to
&gt; &gt; become obvious. I know that some of ******* seem weak on the outside,
&gt; &gt; but will become powerful indivduals when they mature. People need a
&gt; &gt; chance, you know?

&gt; &gt; On the other hand, I intensely dislike being manipulated. I do not
&gt; &gt; like being used by people. I do not mind doing favours for friends,
&gt; &gt; that is just social networking, the give and take of friendship.
&gt; &gt; Sometimes our friends need help, sometimes we need theirs. However our
&gt; &gt; 'friendship', if it is that, is highly one-sided.

&gt; &gt; I hope you see where I'm coming from. Maybe you have friends outside
&gt; &gt; college and they are enough for you. Maybe you think this is stupid
&gt; &gt; and now you have a smirk on your face. Maybe I've offended you,
&gt; &gt; although this isn't even remotely my intention. At this point I don't
&gt; &gt; care. Either you are a friend, or you are not. It is your choice.

&gt; &gt; *********

&gt; By the way, I'm not going to have net access for a few days, not until
&gt; monday evening.

&gt; But please, please reply anyway, I promise to reply back on monday.- Hide quoted text -

DO NOT SEND. Please, do not. In movies and tv shows, people explain
their feelings and everything turns out fine. In real life, not so
much.

It's possible that to you she's &quot;a good friend,&quot; but to her, you might
be one of a thousand people she sees every day. Your letter seems
needy, confused, and lonely, for starters, three qualities that people
don't enjoy being around.

One of the worst things a shy person can do is fixate on one person.
Try to talk to other people in the class and other places, also.

I agree of course. I'm sure the guy wouldn't send such an email if the
&quot;friend&quot; were a guy, which is a good barometer for when something has
ulterior motives.

&gt; care. Either you are a friend, or you are not. It is your choice.

&gt; *********

I will add to the chorus of &quot;Do not send&quot; responses.  It's way too
personal, creepily so.  If I received an email like that from a friend
it would definitely be a &quot;WTF?!&quot; moment.  Most people don't like
gushing displays of emotion.  As Troll said, friendship is not
something that is endlessly discussed and negotiated like a legal
contract.  Either it happens or it doesn't, and in this case it looks
like it doesn't.  She's 28 and married, so it's not surprising you
might drift apart.  Just let it go.

For everyone who replied::

Thanks for replying everyone,

It is hard to see from the outside to the inside sometimes, so I
appreciate your points of view.

As re: the subject, I see things somewhat differently now, and I do
concur with your points of view, which were pretty much aligned as the
same idea. I was a little hurt at some of the posts, but I do realise
that they are the blunt truth.

It is easy to lie to oneself I guess. Feelings just get in the way of
the obvious logic you should be thinking. Even when you think you're
being logical, sometimes there is an &quot;alternative&quot; emotive reason
behind it. It just twists you up in knots.

Anyhow, I take your advice to heart, I'll distance myself more from
this woman. Not that I'll be cold to her as if I've become an enemy of
course, that would freak her out. But I'll definitely put distance
between us. Esentially that means stop sending her emails, don't
broach topics that have anything to do with anything outside of study.

Thanks again,

I think I'll visit you guys again sometime, not to talk about *this
thing* now, but just about general stuff, I'm shy and inexpert on
basic human interaction it seems to me.

&gt; &gt; Hello,

&gt; &gt; I know I'm not a regular here, but I badly need advice on what to do.
&gt; &gt; I'm fairly shy, awkward in talking to people, and now I think I need
&gt; &gt; to communicate something very delicate to a friend of mine.

&gt; &gt; I would particually welcome advice from females, especially women who
&gt; &gt; have been in various relationships with men and so have experience on
&gt; &gt; what is what in these things.

&gt; &gt; I know I'm not the best at broaching sensitive issues eg: emotional,
&gt; &gt; sexual, personal, and so I am worrying about what I should say.

&gt; &gt; I'm 20, male, and my friend is 28, female. This may be part of the
&gt; &gt; problem, I don't know.

&gt; Your email is creepy. You're not being honest with yourself either as to
&gt; what you want.

Ouch!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The kind of emotional bond you seem to want with this woman just isn't

I'm agreeing, I think I'm overstepping my bounds here. Either I should
just not talk to her et al, or maybe I should simply relax about this,
not complicate it anymore and take a step back from it and her. I'll
have to decide I suppose.

&gt; &gt; &gt; She is not unattractive, but it would be no good for either of us if
&gt; &gt; &gt; we went down that route.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sex is quite nice, but I need a friend, not a girlfriend.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If you want to be her
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; friend, the same applies.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Like what? What are these 'steps'? I really don't want her to confuse
&gt; &gt; &gt; friendlyness with a come-on.

&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ­­-------------------------------------------------------

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Name of person. If indeed that is your real name. :-|

&gt; &gt; &gt; Name of person,

&gt; &gt; &gt; After reading this email, I don't know whether you will be upset/angry
&gt; &gt; &gt; with me, or whether you simply won't give a shit. But these things
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to be said so we understand each other. If you just don't read
&gt; &gt; &gt; this email at all, then I'll simply take it that you're not interested
&gt; &gt; &gt; in being friends and don't care.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm more than a little hurt. Do you want to know why? I would like you
&gt; &gt; &gt; to imagine me talking to you right now, saying the words of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; email. I am not shouting or ranting at you, I am not angry with you,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm simply talking to you like normal. Not really normal, because I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling sad, but in a normal voice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The subject is simple. I'm a friend to you, and you are not to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know why this is, I've tried to befriend you as much as I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; able. I sent lengthy emails explaining what I'm thinking, who I am and
&gt; &gt; &gt; more. I talk to you about various things to you directly, I know I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; not the most adept communicator, I often either talk nonsense or
&gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpret things. My point here is that, even though I'm not a
&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect person, I am trying to be friendly here. Sometimes I don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; know whether I'm slightly deaf, or your voice pitch is too low. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; know I don't always understand what you say, albeit that I want to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You speak perfect english, so it is not a lingustic problem. This
&gt; &gt; &gt; might very well be my fault, I don't know.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But that is not really why I am fustrated. I know you dislike ******,
&gt; &gt; &gt; so I'm loathe to use her as an example, but to be perfectly brutally
&gt; &gt; &gt; honest with you, I know as much about her after chatting for 5 mins,
&gt; &gt; &gt; than I do with talking &amp; typing to you at length for well over 5
&gt; &gt; &gt; weeks. ******* is not excatly the most talkative person the world
&gt; &gt; &gt; either. Neither am I, I'm not calling it a character flaw. Like I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; said before, the ****** are naturally quieter.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is excatly what is going through my mind right now. I am going to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be honest with you, there is little point in lying to you or as
&gt; &gt; &gt; importantly, to myself. They may be my darker moments, but it makes
&gt; &gt; &gt; them no less possibly true. Personally, in the not-so-distant past,
&gt; &gt; &gt; ie: 16 years old, 17 years old, 18 years old. I've been guilty of (4),
&gt; &gt; &gt; (5),(6) and (7), so there is an element of &quot;been there, done that&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; with me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm 20 years of age by the way, in case you were wondering.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Either it is the case that:

&gt; &gt; &gt; (1)
&gt; &gt; &gt; You are using me as some kind of human postbox, to collect information
&gt; &gt; &gt; you need that you should be getting in college. ie: exam times, work
&gt; &gt; &gt; material uploading.

&gt; &gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; &gt; (2)
&gt; &gt; &gt; You don't like me, and simply put up with me, just another chore that
&gt; &gt; &gt; you seem to have to cope with in college.

&gt; &gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; &gt; (3)
&gt; &gt; &gt; You believe that men are only interested in knowing you for your body
&gt; &gt; &gt; ie: to fuck. Perhaps you're afraid of being friendly because you think
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll take it as being a &quot;come-on&quot;. I know some men of which it's true,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I assure you not all of us are like that. I'm not that shallow.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure you have a husband who loves you very much, and I'd never
&gt; &gt; &gt; seek to do anything to come between you. I want to be your friend in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the platonic sense only ie: non-sexual. Literal friends.

&gt; &gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; &gt; (4)
&gt; &gt; &gt; You simply aren't interested in having a friend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; &gt; (5)
&gt; &gt; &gt; You're introverted to a large degree, and therefore are feel suspect
&gt; &gt; &gt; of any kind of interaction with others. ie: you don't trust people
&gt; &gt; &gt; very easily.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You are depressed, you feel down and so aren't disposed to being more
&gt; &gt; &gt; open.

&gt; &gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; &gt; (7)
&gt; &gt; &gt; You are a snob, you feel that myself, the rest of ***** are a pack of
&gt; &gt; &gt; halfwits and therefore aren't good enough for you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; or/and

&gt; &gt; &gt; (8)
&gt; &gt; &gt; You see me as a child, hardly worthy of concern or serious
&gt; &gt; &gt; consideration.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I could go on, but you get the idea. I genuinely desire to be your
&gt; &gt; &gt; friend. I am finding it hard  because you don't really 'interact' with
&gt; &gt; &gt; me. I know nothing about you, although I very much want to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know *********, I don't know how she thinks or what she thinks
&gt; &gt; &gt; about. You're a closed book.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I do know these things about you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You like reading, especially detective books.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You are from ****** in ******.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You are married.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You aren't a party animal.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You don't like to eat sweets.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You want to ********  to make some money for yourself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You live in ****** somewhere.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You like rock music.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You dislike *****.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - You are getting into sudoku.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is it. I would say about 6 of those you actually told me
&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself, everything else being stuff I infered or guessed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And I had to seriously sit down and think about you to remember all of
&gt; &gt; &gt; those. So I learn about 1 and a half things about you a week. What
&gt; &gt; &gt; would you write if you wrote a similar list about me?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to have a friend, I'd like to be your friend specifically. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; is very simple, being alone is lonely and depressing. It would be nice
&gt; &gt; &gt; to see a friendly face each day I go to college, just someone to talk
&gt; &gt; &gt; to about anything in particular. Basically just to have someone(s) who
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually give a crap about you. I do care enough to write this. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't do this lightly at all. It is not weakness on my part, I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying I'm human, I'm not made of wood. You surely cannot be either.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel that there is a lot more to you than meets the eye, but I don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; know if that 'lot more' is good or bad. Some people are strong inside
&gt; &gt; &gt; but seem unimpressive externally. Some people are weak but seem
&gt; &gt; &gt; wonderful on the outside. I'm basically talking about your true
&gt; &gt; &gt; nature, your true colours, your character. It takes time for this to
&gt; &gt; &gt; become obvious. I know that some of ******* seem weak on the outside,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but will become powerful indivduals when they mature. People need a
&gt; &gt; &gt; chance, you know?

&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand, I intensely dislike being manipulated. I do not
&gt; &gt; &gt; like being used by people. I do not mind doing favours for friends,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is just social networking, the give and take of friendship.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes our friends need help, sometimes we need theirs. However our
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'friendship', if it is that, is highly one-sided.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you see where I'm coming from. Maybe you have friends outside
&gt; &gt; &gt; college and they are enough for you. Maybe you think this is stupid
&gt; &gt; &gt; and now you have a smirk on your face. Maybe I've offended you,
&gt; &gt; &gt; although this isn't even remotely my intention. At this point I don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; care. Either you are a friend, or you are not. It is your choice.

&gt; &gt; &gt; *********

&gt; &gt; By the way, I'm not going to have net access for a few days, not until
&gt; &gt; monday evening.

Good. You seem like a decent and sincere guy, and I'm glad you don't seem
like someone who is going to stubbornly stick with behaviour even after
seeing that it's clear that it's going to do no good.

Trying to see yourself as other people see you (in all areas of life) is
a valuable skill, but it's difficult and painful, and you can probably do
too much of it. I think I do too much of it, heh.

I think at some point you will find a girl who also enjoys the idea of a
long and deep emotional connection, by email or otherwise. So don't lose
that part of the idea, but make sure it's a build up, and make sure that
you only proceed when she does too. (You make a move, she makes a larger
one, you make a larger one, etc., kind of like a India-Pakistan nuclear
nightmare scenario.)

Probably, although not always. Most of the women I date are in their mid

Stop with the useless E-mails. Too many guys buy into this crap that if
you tell a woman how you feel, it will make her claim undying love. No - it
just cements the fact that you're not worth anything. Get used to it...

So don't complicate them. If you want to get her interest, then be
interesting. Do things with other people, be popular - invite her along
when you're out with a group, but don't spend all of your time with her,
just include her.

Look - you &quot;have&quot; nothing - it's all in your head. You probably don't
want to hear that but it's true. So get over it, and let her see other
women with you - that will get her interest if anything can...

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know I'm not a regular here, but I badly need advice on what to do.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm fairly shy, awkward in talking to people, and now I think I need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to communicate something very delicate to a friend of mine.

&gt;&gt; This is a bad idea.

&gt;&gt; If you want to fuck her, take the steps towards it.

&gt; Did you read the email?

&gt; She is married, and as importantly, I don't want to have sex with her.
&gt; She is not unattractive, but it would be no good for either of us if
&gt; we went down that route.

&gt; Sex is quite nice, but I need a friend, not a girlfriend.
">

Then be a friend, and stop with the useless E-mails. It can cause
problems if she is married. Long ago when I was in college a woman was in
one of my classes, she returned to school after having kids. Her kids were
in school and hubby was at work all the time - ended up with more than a
few fun afternoons back at my place over the next few years. Just because
she's married doesn't mean she's not looking, if you play it right. F*ck
buddies are great - you can be her outlet from reality, and she can be
yours. Just don't complicate it, enjoy what develops...

But stop with the E-mails. Include her in things you're doing if you
want her to open up to you. But don't push it - remember &quot;the woman
chooses&quot; even if she doesn't realize she's doing it. If there is
attraction, she'll let you know one way or another. But don't rush to
complicate things - keep it simple and fun. If you really want to be her
friend, keep it fun. That can lead to everything else...

I really don't know that I agree with you. I think there's a lot of
selectivity there, and many successful people are good at persisting
oblivious to criticism. I'm sure this sometimes isn't just being
determined, but actually not being aware of how they are perceived. I've
known several guys who were successful with women who didn't realize how
idiotic other people perceived them to be but kept trying anyway until they
learned to succeed.
