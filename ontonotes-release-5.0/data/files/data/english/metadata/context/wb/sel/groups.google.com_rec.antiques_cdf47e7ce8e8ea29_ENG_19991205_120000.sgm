Cyn and all

I am always a little reluctant to tell my stories because I almost
always get the feeling that people don't believe me and when you are
describing what actually happened that can be a little off putting
however--

One of the funniest happened one morning when I got up much the worst
for wear from the night before. The house was built between 1795 and
1798 and the back part of the house had settle much more than the
front part. I had a little den that had once been part of a back
porch. the pitch of the floor was so much in that room that I had a
brick under the legs on one end of the couch and even then you did
tend to list a little.On the up side of that room there was a door
that opened into long center hallway. this door opened uphill and
always stuck. it took a little effort to open it. this particular
morning as i walked into the den that door opened by itself. I held
my poor head and said aloud &quot;I am not in the mood for this!&quot;
Whereupon the door closed. The knob turned and the door closed very
guietly. i said &quot;thanks&quot; and made coffee.

"/> Popping a cool top &amp; sharing my most recent ghost.........sorry it's
long.....but Vera, my ghost, insists upon her say.......

About five years ago, I disposed of the personal property portion of the
estate of a woman who, in the days of her youth &amp; beauty, was a vocalist
with big bands in the New York City area. This was a tag sale.
The house &amp; grounds were full of boxes &amp; bags of mixed trash &amp; treasure. I
was instructed by the court to look everywhere for a will which reputably
existed solely for the purpose of preventing her ex-husband from laying
claim to certain memorabilia that the lady most definitely did not want him
to have.
All of her friends knew that the will existed. No one knew where it was.
Therefore I dared throw not even a personal letter away without checking the
contents.
I grew to know the lady well. (I grew to like the lady, as well)
She kept all of her publicity pics etc. &amp; in many of them she was wearing a
gorgeous white fox stole.
I found the white fox stole hanging in one of the closets, carefully
enclosed in the proper storage material.
As the time begin to run out &amp; I still had much to tag &amp; had not found the
will either, I begin to work evenings.
One night I smelled an overpowering &amp; heavy odor of perfume, found no
source, &amp; opened the windows to air out. Of course, I closed them &amp; locked
up carefully as I left for the night. The lawyer &amp; I had the only keys to
the house. We had the locks changed when I started tagging the contents.
When I returned in the morning, the white fox stole was laid grandly out on
the bed in front bedroom,. The bag it had been in remained in the closet at
the other end of the house.
That evening, as dusk closed in &amp; I flipped the first light inside the
house, the odor of perfume again begin to fill the house. I made a
considered, judicious, unemotional decision to high-tail it out of there
immediately &amp; to forego any more evening hours in the house.
In the morning the fox stole was under the far corner of the bed. I had to
drag it out with a broomstick. On subsequent mornings it was found (1) on
the couch, (2) draped across the birdcage, (3) atop the refrigerator (at
least it wasn't stuffed in it) &amp; various other places.
I tried to joke about it, but I was growing a little uneasy with the
traveling stole, So in desperation, I decided to talk to Vera (its former
owner) about it.
&quot;Vera,&quot; I said aloud at three o'clock on a sunny afternoon, glancing at
shadowed corners, and feeling more than a little foolish, &quot;If that's your
ghost playing these games, give me some kind of clue of what you want, will
ya&quot;
&quot;Clunk&quot; A composition animated Christmas figure (German &amp; almost
life-sized) fell chock over, gently enough not to damage. Aha.....one of
the items that Vera most definitely did not want her ex-husband to have.
Feeling not quite so foolish as before, but a tad more desperate, as my
reality tried to redefine itself, I almost shouted, &quot;Gimme a break here,
Vera. I can't find your will. You know I'm trying. I'll bet you can't even
remember where you put it. So get off my back, will ya.&quot;
For the first time ever, the house suddenly took on that dense silence of a
truly uninhabited structure.
The fox stole never moved again. The ex-husband came to pick up the property
awarded by the court &amp; no heavy odor of perfume protested his presence. The
sale went smoothly &amp; profitably. A very pretty young lady purchased the fox
stole &amp; I don't thing Vera minded.
And now finally, as I quietly promised after my outburst, Vera has had, if
not her way, at least, her say, if only in cyberspace.

"/> We had a spook in our Victorian house that only my little brother had
seen standing outside the house. One early morning @ 2am I was getting a
ride home with a friend, as we pulled up toward the front of my house
someone wearing a fedora ( Indiana Jones style) and a trench coat al la
Bogart walked from the front door around the front of my van. Before the
eyes of my friend and myself the figure faded from it's feet to the
middle and from the tip of it's hat to the middle and vanished. From
were we sat it looked almost like someone quickly ducking out of sight ,
so we both jumped out of the cab of his truck , my friend ran around the
left side of my house and I ran around the right , hoping to catch the
'Intruder' in the back yard. Neither one of us saw the intruder on our
pursuit and met one another in the back yard. Now comes the freaky part,
it had been raining off and on all day, the only footprints in the mud
were ours, no other prints were found anywhere on the property. After
our encounter we put on the kettle and went over what we both saw and
came to the conclusion that , #1 we were both sober &amp; straight and had
seen something beyond explanation and #2 we now had a good excuse to
get drunk or high. We still talk about it every now and again when
Autumn is in the air, we always have a drink afterwards.

tale about a large estate ( Probate) I worked on to Jon or Ronnie and
how the deceased's house &amp; contents seem to be waiting for their owner's
return. That expectant feeling seems to hang about two weeks and then is
gone.

"/> Absolutely, but here goes (again for some r.a. members):

I was riding my motorbike home late at night on the Isle of Wight, and
got to the top of a long hill covered over by trees. Just as I got to
the bottom a woman stepped right out in front of me. I braked so hard
that I lost control of the bike and it skidded over on its side. After
asecond I thought &quot;Oh no, I must have killed her. I couldn't see
anything as it was so dark, so I pointed the headlight around....and
there was nothing there. I was frightened because I thought I had
really hit someone and more frightened thinking that she had been
thrown into a ditch. I roared off home thinking either I had made it
all up or that this would be in the paper the next day..it wasn't.

A couple of years later, I had been playing guitar off the Island, and
someone on the car ferry offered to give me a lift home. Again it was
night and we soon reached the same spot where I had my 'experience'.
The driver turned to his friend and said jokingly &quot;Isn't this supposed
tobe where you see the &quot;White Lady&quot;?! Now I was really scared.

Apparently, last century, a woman had thrown herself in front of a
horse and cart at that exact spot.

I can't explain this...I know what I saw...and I had no knowledge of
any stories connected with this road......

There is one story I can never tell because I don't want to worry my
children...and yet I realise that this is my chance to 'get it off my
chest'.

The old house we live in was owned by two elderly sisters. Mary
outlived her sister Clara who had died before I bought the house. Mary
lived with us until she was 100, and I had to restore the house around
her. She loved this, especially talking to various plumbers and
electricians I had in from time to time.

However, whenever I was working upstairs on my own, I would hear
footsteps, the door would open (latch and all) and I KNEW that Clara
was standing there watching me. I could not see her. At first this
really spooked me, but then I kept talking to her as I got this really
lonely feeling...I even showed her the improvements I was making. I
kept telling her how happy Mary was and that she would soon be with
her again. Finally, one day, she did frighten me by running up the
stairs and bursting into the room. I yelled out loud &quot;Clara, I'm fed
up with you checking onme all the time, and it frightens me...you know
that we are looking after Mary and the house. NOW GO AWAY!!....and she
did, that minute.
From then on the house has had a warm and contented feeling which many
people comment on.

Jon

PS It still makes the hair on my neck go up thinking of all those
times when the door would open and I knew that someone was behind me
whilstI painted or plastered and all the silly conversations that I
had....&quot;Look, Clara it's pink...is that all right with you?&quot;..then the
door closing again after she had satisfied herself that the work was
progressing well.

"/> Mike--I found that whenever something happened I would try very hard
to come up with rational reasons why what happened was a natural
event. Maybe when I opened the door to the den I created a draft or
maybe we had a tiny earthquake; maybe when I saw &quot;Nanna&quot; watching me
in the garden from the dinning room window it really was just a
reflection--anything to keep from having to deal with the possibility
of the supernatural. But the one event that I can never find a
rationl reason for was the day I went into the library and found three
books in the middle of the floor. I lived alone and had had no
company for a while. the books were stacked neatly in the very middle
of the room. No way could they have fallen from any of the shelves
and landed where they were. And even if they had fallen, no way could
they land neatly stacked with the biggest on the bottom and the
smallest on the top. that on still makes my hands shake a little!

Okay, I've been resisting temptation for weeks, and I MISS YOU GUYS!!!

This webmastering is really time consuming! (More than 4200 hits so far
IN A LITTLE OVER A MONTH!!!, web cast offers up the ying-yang,
responding to inquiries regarding appearances, etc, PLUS S.O. working
every weekend - a wonderful thing!)

(playing the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; theme in the background)

The first time I realized that my life was going to be weird was when I
inherited my maternal Grandmother's high school yearbook. She committed
suicide when my father was an infant. It's a lovely red-leather bound
book. I kept it on a bookshelf.

One day I came home from work (I lived alone at the time) and the book
had *magically* moved itself from the bookcase to my coffee table. Not
only that, it was opened to the single page which had been signed by my
Grandfather. I was SOOO freaked out.. after I spotted that, I grabbed my
coat and went out for a bite to eat at the local coffee shop, where I
was a &quot;regular.&quot; Came home, and the book was still there, open like
that. At that point, I decided to just deal with it.

Stay tuned for part II - the story does NOT end there...

My Egbert...

by Tracy Doyle

Okay, some of you know that for years I have been researching the
turn-of-the-century pop music composer, Egbert Van Alstyne. If you'll
read the story at:
http://www.rag-time.com/fest/bio.html
... you will see my almost unnatural attachment to this fellow.

Anyhow, it's one thing to pick a biographical subject out of the blue
and later figure out that he is related to you. It's entirely another
when weird things start to happen which should not.

1.) I call a friend of mine who is a piano roll collector, out of the
blue, just to say &quot;hi.&quot; He says, &quot;I was just going to pick up the phone
to call you. I can't believe you're calling right now...&quot; Turns out he
had a piano roll auction list in his hand with a hand-played player
piano roll by Egbert called &quot;That Sneaky, Creepy Tune.&quot; I had never
heard of it before. Through my friend, I placed a bid and won it. Years
later, the manuscript turned up in the Library of Congress... after
years of having been missing.

2.) This all started about a year before I divorced my ex. He used to go
to work early in the morning, and I'd stay up late at night practicing
the piano. I was practicing one night, when I saw someone walk up to me
on my left. I thought it was Tom (the ex). I said, &quot;What are you doing
up at this hour?&quot; but as I turned to look, I realized no one was there.
I started playing again (of course, I was working up one of Egbert's
tunes)... and I saw that fellow again.. but when I looked up, he wasn't
there. Well, a few days later, the EX began to see a fellow peeking in
on me while we were watching TV in the den... He hasn't really left me
alone since, but he has been in a quite period lately.

3.) Within a few months, I was having plenty of &quot;Egbert moments...&quot;
events which should NOT have happened, statistically. Finding his
mother's divorce papers in a nearby courthouse... finding a transcript
of her actual testimony (from 1900) in another.. all within 10 minutes
of walking in the dcor. Calling people at the &quot;very moment&quot; they found
piano rolls or sheet music which I didn't have...

4.) But one of the two best Egbert moments was when S.O. and I were
listening to an LP of march music written by Sousa. The last track on
the side we were listening to was &quot;Liberty Bell.&quot; Well, the tune
finished playing, the tone arm lifted and swung back toward the cradle -
then swung back into the body of the record and landed EXACTLY at the
beginning of &quot;Liberty Bell.&quot; S.O., who has an engineering degree and
also is an expert in magic, couldn't believe it. &quot;That's IMPOSSIBLE!&quot; he
said. Yes, it was. Egbert wanted to hear it again, I think... funny, but
his early compositions were heavily influenced by Sousa and his then
&quot;right hand man,&quot; Arthur Pryor. Egbert and Pryor remianed friends for
years. There is more to that story....

5.) But I think the most astonishing thing was the last major &quot;Egbert moment...&quot;
I was at the grocery store, walking up and down the aisles with my
little cart. I turned down the aisle with the Italian food, and I was
thinking about my Egbert bio. There was only one other gal in the aisle
with me. I heard an abrasive sort of noise, like a jar or can sliding
over a rippled shelf. The sound had a very specific source -- both the
gal and I looked directly at the source of the noise. Then we saw it...
a jar of spaghetti sauce MOVED before our eyes. It slid toward the edge
of the shelf with a &quot;GRRTHTHTHTTTTT.&quot; She and I looked at each other...
another &quot;GRRRTTHTHTHTHTTTT...&quot; and it slid nearly half way off the
shelf. One more &quot;GRRTTHTHTHTHTTTT...&quot; and over the edge it went,
crashing to the floor and breaking!

She looked at me and said, &quot;I didn't do it!!&quot; I said, &quot;I know. We both
saw that, right?&quot; She said (eyes open quite wide) &quot;I saw it! GAWD, was
that WEIRD!! It's like someone else was here!&quot;

I said, &quot;Yep, I know... and don't even ask.&quot;

Frankly, these things don't even faze me anymore. They don't frighten
me. In a way, they comfort me. I've heard my recently dead cat purring
and felt my dead dog licking my face. It's all very strange, but in a
way very nice. I sure can't explain it, and I don't care to. I feel
priviledged to have had such experiences, and I hope they continue.

Tracy, you have given me the courage to share this story. 16 years ago
my eldest daughter gave birth to a very premature baby girl The baby
lived 3 weeks. three years ago my Father died. Several months ago i
was in church praying and not thinking of either of them, especially
not the baby, when I glanced up. For a few very brief moments I saw
my Father standing there and he was holding the baby. What is strange
to me is that I had never really put the two of them together in mind
as perhaps being in the same place. It was a wonderful to know they
are.

Tracy, It's great knowing you can see thing that others can't , isn't
it.
My husband is not a believer in ghosts
and I've seen my dearly departed cat
actually I've tripped over her, many times.
One night my husband saw her assuming
she was our new cat ,same color, but then realized the new cat was in
another room
sleeping,cause he saw her sleeping. I
guess that was her purpose in being here cause I haven't seen her since
hubby did.
She always did get the last word.
Thanks to everyone for their stories I
really enjoyed them all.

My husband &amp; I were never able to have children &amp; so our
pets became our spoiled little babies. After the death of
one of our dogs (she was 20-yrs. old), my mother gave me a
newspaper clipping entitled The Rainbow Bridge.

Due to the posts on ghost pets, I thought some of you might
receive the same comfort from it that I did.

&quot;There is a bridge connecting Heaven &amp; Earth. It is called
the Rainbow Bridge because of its many colors. Just this
side of the Rainbow Bridge there is a land of meadows, hills
&amp; valley with lush green grass.

When a beloved pet dies, the pet goes to this place. There
is always food &amp; water &amp; warm spring weather. The old &amp;
frail animals are young again. Those who are maimed are
made whole again. They play all day with each other.

There is only one thing missing. They are not with their
special person who loved them on Earth. So, each day they
run &amp; play until the day comes when one suddenly stops
playing &amp; looks up! The nose twitches! The ears are up!
The eyes are staring! And this one suddenly runs from the
group!

You have been seen, and when you and your special friend
meet, you take him or her in your arms &amp; embrace. Your face
is kissed again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; you look once more into
the eyes of your trusting pet.

Then you cross the Rainbow Bridge together, never again to
be separated.&quot;

I like to believe that someday we will all be reunited in
the same way with our loved human friends &amp; family.
Debbie

dog in to have him put to sleep. Jake was only a few months shy of 16,

Jake looked kinda like a cross between a fox, a coyote and a sheep. He
shed all year long, and his crinkley white fur has been taken home by
all my friends via static cling, and even taken pretty much around the
world when my son was in the navy. &quot;GAWD Mom, dress blues and Jake hair
don't go well together!&quot; I still see tufts of it stuck in the manzanita
now and then, and I'm sure many a newly hatched robin, or baby squirrel
has felt the warmth of that fur from hell!
Having a pet by your side night and day for 16 years, and suddenly
they're gone, is akin I think to losing a piece of yourself. He's never
come back in the spiritual sense, but it does seem odd. Shouldn't there
be an end to the clumps of Jake fur eventually? He WASN'T very big!:-)

name was Schroeder. His kidneys failed when he was 2. He barely survived
- I had to give him subcutaneous fluids 3X daily for MONTHS. Gratefully,
because of a new pet food (Hill's dry KD), he did recover and lived 4
more years. When he got sick again at age 6, I started with the fluids
again, but did not see any great improvement in his condition. One
night, I was at home working on my computer. He walked into the office,
sat down about a foot away from my chair and looked at me. &quot;Mom, let me
go...&quot; his eyes were telling me. I did... I had the vet come to the
house the next day. That was nice. He hated vets' offices.

One night my ex (Tom) and I were driving home from I forget where (I was
driving). I popped a ragtime cassette into the player, and we had
listened to several tunes. Well, suddenly Tom recoiled, pasting himself
up against the window. &quot;Oh my GOD!&quot; he said. &quot;Did you SEE THAT???&quot;

Obviously, I hadn't. &quot;It was a HAND - coming from the back seat! It was
reaching for the tape deck!&quot; he said. Not just a hand - it was sort of
grayish and transparent. The index finger was pointing, as if to press a
button on the tape deck. Then it disappeared.

Funny, but since then I've had a number of weird experiences with
electronics, like the self-repeating track on the record. I believe it
was Egbert, and I believe he figured out how to control these things on occasion.

I've been reading through my tears at all our wonderful animals and I

understands just how tough it is to actually say, yes, it's time.
Before anyone calls me a liar, I realized after posting, that Jakes been
gone over a year. Almost 14 months. I actually had to look at a calender
to believe it's been that long and still hurts this bad. The following

"/> Very nice, Mari. We have had so many animals. At one point, I had my
horse and two ponies for the kids, and I was boarding a neighbor's
pony. And we had an Old English sheepdog, and 12 cats. And a tank
full of tropical fish. And two tuft-footed pigeons. Egad!

Our last animal was an orange cat that we'd had since he was just
several weeks old. I remember when he was still just barely past
kittenhood, and he adopted a stuffed squirrel toy that had belonged to
one of the kids. He'd go get it and bring it to the living room and
throw it all *over* the place.

He was 21, finally. And so frail. Finally had trouble getting up
when he'd lie down. We had been doing what Tracy mentioned, pumping
him up with fluids, because his kidneys had failed. But one night
last year, it was just time.

Took him to the vets and bid a choked-up farewell. Makes me almost
want to cry again.

"/> _______

I probably shouldn't jump in here, what with all the good and serious
tales, but ....

This isn't exactly a ghost story, although it was for awhile. It
certainly raised my hackles -- and had me seriously doubting my sanity
for a period of about three weeks.

It was summer, and I was dozing in the dark on the living room couch,
some movie from AMC flickering on the TV. Something woke me, and as I
opened my eyes, I saw through the arch into the darkened dining room.
And saw the black silhouette of a cat gliding past the long table.

That was not unusual in our house, but then I looked down from the
couch, and there was our cat, peacefully asleep. He and I were both
good at that. I looked back to the dining room, saw nothing. But I
jumped up and went there. Nope, nothing.

A shadow? No, it was too perfectly the outline of a cat, and it
stayed in my mind. And then, one night the following week, I got up
from the couch and stepped around my fast-asleep cat to go through the
dining room and into the kitchen for the day's 32nd cup of coffee.
There in the dim, eating out of my cat's bowl, was that damned black
*something*!

We froze. And then the thing just flat out ... disappeared! By that
time, I was moving, running toward where it had been, around the
corner, down the short hall, back into the living room, through the
living room into the dining room. Back in the kitchen. Nothing.

I went through the entire house, rippling with goosebumps. The only
feline to be found was my blissfully deaf orange cat, there by the
couch. I checked the doors; everything shut. Next day, I went to
work in serious wonder. I didn't tell my wife. I didn't tell
anybody.

I was working nights then, and I usually got home at 3 or 4 a.m. And
I would sit and watch TV for awhile before going to bed. But now I
was scared to sit in my own living room. I was literally jumping at
shadows and thinking I might well be having mental troubles.

And then I saw the black blob again, this time oozing through the
dining room *toward* the kitchen. Son of a bitch!! I leaped up and
raced out there. Gone, of course. Nothing. But this time, I turned
on every light I could find. And I REALLY searched.

I spent a long time. And, finally, down on my hands and knees, I
found a tiny hole in the screen of the patio door. Not big enough for
more than a mouse, I thought. But I went to bed clinging to the hope.
I still hadn't told anyone.

I watched for the next several nights. And the eyestrain paid off.
Ridiculous. Sitting in the dark, watching for a figment of my
imagination. But there, finally ... there he was! Snaking himself
through the hole in the screen. Phew! Oh good!!

A real live cat, come to visit a full bowl of Friskies. Next day, I
took the screendoor to be fixed. And started to tell people my story.
Laughing, of course. Brave and sure of myself through it all ....

Marshall

Marshall's cat story snipped.

Talking of cats, I was really puzzled the other day. As you may
remember, I told you that we have two cats visit us all day every day.

At night, we open the kitchen door and off they go.

However, the other morning there was 'Tigger' already fast asleep in
the chair in a completely locked kitchen. Unlike in Marshall's case
there was no way in and I could not explain this.

So I watched carefully the other night, and after both cats went out,
and as my daughter was closing the door and when she turned her back,
as quick as a flash, Tigger shot back through the closing gap....and
hidherself in the nearest kitchen cupboard, just under the sink, by
slipping through the gap at the bottom of the door!!!!

I did the ususal light turning out, and could just make her out
creeping from the cupboard and into the chair for the night!

We now watch them go down the garden path before shutting the door.

When the disciples were terrified at seeing Christ on the water, he
said &quot;Don't be frightened, I'm not a ghost(spirit)&quot;

However, whether these are glitches in the space/time continuum, or
magnetically recorded images (as in The Stone Tape principle) or
actuallythe essence of people who have previously been alive is
another matter.

Jon

Okay, &quot;The Stone Tape&quot; principle is that events that give off a lot of
energy, such as violent death, actually get stored in their
surroundings...eg the rocks near famous battles (Glencoe). Just like
video tape, these recordings get 'replayed' in certain circumstances
in glorious sound and vision! This would explain why certain events
only happen in the same places. Considering the use of natural
materials eg copper, silicon to record electro-magnetic signals, this
is not as far fetched as it first sounds.

Cats...love 'em. I've got 7 and my 3 girls are fixed to keep it that
way.
I was 15 and living in Redondo Beach Cal. We had a few cats but they
all stayed outside at night. Shortly after moving into this house, I
Started hearing and seeing the same things you did. The sound I remember
most was a soft 'thud' as a cat hit the floor, and the tiny creaks as it
padded down the short hallway to my room. I swear this is true, I could
feel him jump onto my bed and settle his weight on my legs. Then I'd
hear it purring. I would reach down to 'touch' one of the lucky cats
that hadn't gotten thrown out for the night, but there was never
anything there. Eventually the weight would lift, there'd be a soft
'thud' by my bed and the creaking would return the way it came. My
father didn't believe in anything that couldn't be bought sold or
traded, but even he admitted to seeing 'phantom' (the name I'd given it)
on several occasions. My mother heard him scratching at my door one
night until he nudged it open. His silhouette in the doorway was
something we'd both seen, her from one side of the doorway, and me, from
the other. For about 2 years 'Phantom' was a regular 'guest' in the
house. (never needed a litter box either!) Then one day, he just stopped
coming.
Two years passed. We had kept one whole litter of kittens, and I'd
named them Hinky, Dinky Parley and Vous. Vous had her first litter of
kittens, and they were premature. One by one the four little babies
died until only one remained. This was the only one who'd lived long
enough to be given a name. (though now I don't recall what it was.) My
mother was an invalid, and she was asleep in a recliner just a few feet
away from me. I was lying on a couch watching tv. The box with the
remaining kitten was on the floor beside me. I felt a cat jump on the
couch by my legs and reached back to pet it while still watching tv. My
mom asked &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I was trying to pet &quot;Vous &quot; I said. Well
bottom line was, Vous was outside, there was nothing where my hand was
reaching to touch and both my mother and I realized instantly that
&quot;Phantom' had returned. Instintively I looked in the box. The remaining
kitten was dead.
Phantom never came back after that day. I like to think he came back
just one more time to carry that tiny little soul by the scruff of it's
neck.

Marshall,
The oldest a cat has ever made it under my care was 11. To keep a cat
until it was old enough to vote shows what a cared for little critter it
must have been. Sorry it still hurts.

Mari,
It's a proven fact that you are a liar, unless
you finally got around to Nuking those lies
of yours in Deja News. You might as well get
used to the idea that it is a demonstrable fact
that you are a liar and stop denying it.

That's the trouble with being a liar, I guess.
Once you have shown what you are, as you have,
no one puts much faith in what you say,
so you have to qualify things as you did in the

Cancer took my oldest kitty, who was 17 when I let her go... the dog was
about 14, and the other kitty was 11 - lost all three of them within 2
years... but we've got two others now - one's about 4 and the other is
near 2, and the young one is the spitting image of the 17 year old. The
only difference is the older one used to jump in the bathroom sink and
wait for me to turn on the faucet... now the 2 year old jumps in the
sink and falls asleep!

Cats... ya gotta luv 'em!

Have fun, Michele

Sure sounds to me as if those cats would prefer you to be
their owner.

Isn't the superstition that if a cat adopts you, it is the
reincarnated soul of a person who was formerly close to you?
Something about Egyptians niggles at the back of my mind,
too.

I have no cat ghost stories but one unrelated
ghost story.

When I was attending Arizona State University
I would go to my favorite cafe called the Java
Road Cafe. I had formally heard that this building
was from the turn of the century and had once been
a dentists office.

Once I was talking to a friend and was sitting on a
small wall out in the patio of the cafe, drinking
my coffee and enjoying the warm Arizona night. Then I
looked into the middle of the cafe where people were
talking and drinking coffee as usual, then I saw a
figure of a boy maybe 2-3 years younger then I was
at the time and he was dressed in clothes that were just
&quot;out of time&quot; and antiquated by 70 years or so.
The way his hair was done was to perfect and just
completely out of place in the grunge or gothic
styles of the people surrounding the space where
he was. He looked to &quot;well kept&quot; and that made
him seem out of place and I noticed it and looked
right at him analyzing his clothing, hair and things
about him and everything about him seemed old and
odd. He stared back with an expression of
surprise on his face almost as if he was surprised
I saw him or discovered his presence. Then when
I looked away for a second to take a quick sip of my
coffee he was gone. And I thought no human
being could leave that quickly and not be seen
exiting the cafe especially since the area he
was in was right in the middle of a very crowded
cafe. He would have had to push his way through
people to get out of the cafe and couldn't have
left so quickly so I presumed that I saw a ghost.
Who knows.

Regards,

Kathleen

&gt;&gt;Doris
&gt; _______

&gt; I probably shouldn't jump in here, what with all the good and serious
&gt; tales, but ....

&gt; This isn't exactly a ghost story, although it was for awhile. It
&gt; certainly raised my hackles -- and had me seriously doubting my sanity
&gt; for a period of about three weeks.

&gt; It was summer, and I was dozing in the dark on the living room couch,
&gt; some movie from AMC flickering on the TV. Something woke me, and as I
&gt; opened my eyes, I saw through the arch into the darkened dining room.
&gt; And saw the black silhouette of a cat gliding past the long table.

&gt; That was not unusual in our house, but then I looked down from the
&gt; couch, and there was our cat, peacefully asleep. He and I were both
&gt; good at that. I looked back to the dining room, saw nothing. But I
&gt; jumped up and went there. Nope, nothing.

&gt; A shadow? No, it was too perfectly the outline of a cat, and it
&gt; stayed in my mind. And then, one night the following week, I got up
&gt; from the couch and stepped around my fast-asleep cat to go through the
&gt; dining room and into the kitchen for the day's 32nd cup of coffee.
&gt; There in the dim, eating out of my cat's bowl, was that damned black
&gt; *something*!

&gt; We froze. And then the thing just flat out ... disappeared! By that
&gt; time, I was moving, running toward where it had been, around the
&gt; corner, down the short hall, back into the living room, through the
&gt; living room into the dining room. Back in the kitchen. Nothing.

&gt; I went through the entire house, rippling with goosebumps. The only
&gt; feline to be found was my blissfully deaf orange cat, there by the
&gt; couch. I checked the doors; everything shut. Next day, I went to
&gt; work in serious wonder. I didn't tell my wife. I didn't tell
&gt; anybody.

&gt; I was working nights then, and I usually got home at 3 or 4 a.m. And
&gt; I would sit and watch TV for awhile before going to bed. But now I
&gt; was scared to sit in my own living room. I was literally jumping at
&gt; shadows and thinking I might well be having mental troubles.

&gt; And then I saw the black blob again, this time oozing through the
&gt; dining room *toward* the kitchen. Son of a bitch!! I leaped up and
&gt; raced out there. Gone, of course. Nothing. But this time, I turned
&gt; on every light I could find. And I REALLY searched.

&gt; I spent a long time. And, finally, down on my hands and knees, I
&gt; found a tiny hole in the screen of the patio door. Not big enough for
&gt; more than a mouse, I thought. But I went to bed clinging to the hope.
&gt; I still hadn't told anyone.

&gt; I watched for the next several nights. And the eyestrain paid off.
&gt; Ridiculous. Sitting in the dark, watching for a figment of my
&gt; imagination. But there, finally ... there he was! Snaking himself
&gt; through the hole in the screen. Phew! Oh good!!

&gt; A real live cat, come to visit a full bowl of Friskies. Next day, I
&gt; took the screendoor to be fixed. And started to tell people my story.
&gt; Laughing, of course. Brave and sure of myself through it all ....

&gt; Marshall

I too, have a couple of ghost stories to tell. The first one could be
nothing more than wishful thinking....the second one is a bit more
complicated and seen by both my husband and me and a few others.
I inherited my Grandmother's rocker....she was a diabetic, and later in her
life she developed terrible leg ulcers. To ease the pain, she would sit in
her chair and &quot;rock the pain away&quot; while telling stories, sorting buttons,
or making little spool dolls for her favorite grandaughters (my sister and I
were her only grandaughters, as well). I can remember many a night falling
to sleep in the featherbed, lulled by the squeak of Grandma's chair, rocking
back and forth, back and forth. After inheriting the chair, (and annoying my
parents to no end by not having it stripped and refinished so it would look
like a new chair)....there have been times, like when my children were
toddlers and had been deathly ill, when I know I've heard the chair squeak
as it rocked by itself. Unfortunately no one has heard it but me.....BUT,
after each of these times, many people have said they smelled a rich perfume
in the house......and Grandmother wore Topaz.
The second thing that happened was in our present home. It was built in the
year 1900 and thus will be officially 100 years old at the start of
2000.....the house has lots of quirks....the floors run dowhill in some
rooms.....rooms like the bathrooms are add-ons....and some of the extensions
were built by someone who had not a clue what a square was........but after
getting rid the old stationary heating source removed and installing
central air furnace....there was nary a cold spot, or ghostly presence,
other than the scent of Grandmother's perfume occasionally, in the entire
house. It wasn't an ominous house, just one that had seen a lot of families
come and go, and yet never seemed to retain any impression of them, except
on the surface. We raised our daughters, lived, laughed, and loved....and
have remodeled, trying to bring some kind of character to the old
house....and other than being a pleasant place to live, it pretty much
resisted our efforts. Until......
Nine years ago, Gary and I adopted two little boys to get them away from an
abusive situation. The baby was seven months old, and the oldest was a
little over two, ( he was nonverbal, and lived under our dining room table
for two weeks....but he's 11 now and doing wonderfully now)....it was hard
going from no kids at home, to having a baby and a toddler.....but it was
worth it. We got them settled in, but not more than a few days after they
came to stay, we started noticing something odd. After putting them to bed,
if you were sitting in the rocking chair or on the sofa, out of the corner
of your eye you'd see a little blond head peeking out of the bedroom
door.....but when you turned to look....nothing would be there!! I just felt
that it must be stress and that I was imagining it...but about three weeks
later while Gary and I were sitting on the sofa and I turned to see if Mark
had gotten out of bed, when Gary said, &quot;Have you been seeing it too?&quot;....It
turned out that Gary, my Mother-In-Law, my Sister, and a neighbor had all
seen this little boy, peeking out of doors and windows, dressed in a
nightshirt. I haven't been able to find any history of a child dying in our
house, though our neighbor insisted that a little boy died in the Spanish
Influenza outbreak, but I haven't been able to verify that. The little
ghost, or maybe guardian Angel stayed with the boys for, maybe, five years
or so.....but now that the boys are thriving and healthy, we haven't seen
him....maybe he doesn't feel the boys need him anymore.....but finally our
house feels like a home. Messy, cluttered with various toys and trucks and
video games....but at last alive.
There is my Chirstmas offering.....
Lois E.

I don't know why I'm posting this,but I have two cats.One is a Maine
Coon Cat named Teddy and she's been with me 18 years.She's an inside cat
and has spent 24 hours a day with me through thick &amp; thin for all these
years. I've spent more time with Teddy than with any other human or
animal.
Tonight I held her in my arms and rocked her as she took her last
breath and the light left her eyes. I don't know if she had a soul,but
I'd like to think that she went to heaven.
Thanks for listening.................

Guess this time I'll bring the carafe... I'll even pour.

This is a very sad night for you. I have been there too many times. You
were fortunate to have 18 beautiful years with her. I lost by best
friend, Roseanne, before she turned four, and my darling Schroeder when
he was only 6. For what it's worth, I belive she had (and has!) a soul,
and that she didn't want to leave you.

I wish you the best in this difficult time. Will you post a picture of her?

I don't know why I'm posting this,but I have two cats.One is a Maine
Coon Cat named Teddy and she's been with me 18 years.She's an inside cat
and has spent 24 hours a day with me through thick &amp; thin for all these
years. I've spent more time with Teddy than with any other human or
animal.
Tonight I held her in my arms and rocked her as she took her
last breath and the light left her eyes. I don't know if she had a
soul,but I'd like to think that she went to heaven.
Thanks for listening.................

Sorry to hear of your loss. I'm sure she was very happy to be in your
arms for
the last time and she was remembering all the good times. &lt; !!!!!!&gt;

"/> Oh, Doug. I am so sorry. 3 years ago I sat on the floor of my vet's
office with my cat Ivory as he &quot;went to sleep.&quot;
we both cried. She (the vet) and I had nursed him for nearly 5 years
through the ravages of feline AIDS. she had promised me that when the
time came that his suffering would out way his quality of life we
would let him go. I love this doctor. She never charges when she has
to put an animal down. Instead she asks that you make a contribution
to your local ASPA. She also sends a sympathy card with a Rainbow
Bridge type message. It is so great to find a person who really
understands how painful it is to lose a pet.

Not so much a confirmed ghost story, but a personnal hope (feeling a
little guilty, but only a little) that this one report may be true...
Three years ago my folks sold their 1820's farmhouse to a builder from
Long Island (we're in NH). It needed a bit of work and some &quot;freshening
up&quot;, but was livable, and had some nice antique features (pumpkin pine
panelling, central chimney, sloping floors, etc). We rented it for
another year, 'til the new owner moved up, and we bought our own
remuddled 1830's farmhouse (no ghosts here yet), during which the old
place deteriorated badly, and the new owner's &quot;fixes&quot; worsened matters
considerably. For instance the fill valve for the forced hot water heat
failed, and the lines froze - so he left the old valve in, decided we
didn't need heat in the kitchen or bedroom and cut out the loop that had
split in 20+ places so the rest could be used with no futher repair...
damp laundry would freeze in the washer (in the kitchen) overnight ;-)
Since we left, he's collapsed an addition (don't replace 8x8 timbers
with 2x6's, they don't hold well), ripped out the central chimney
(recently restored) and gutted the house. Today it stands a shell with
no back wall, no siding, a gaping hole in the roof - no life. I was
quite maliciously intrigued when recently a common acquiantance asked if
we'd ever had ghost problems in the 30+ years we lived there (never) -
he was very unsettled, and the same week someone else mentioned the
addition (?) had begun to collapse on the owner when he was in
there..... granted the structural damage is extensive, but if there ever
was a fitting occasion to wake the prior residents from the dead, I'd
have to suspect this might upset them a tad. I'm hoping the grapevine
will continue to fill in this story, goodness knows the town is full of
them already.

Doug,
Her spirit and memories will always stay alive in your heart, even though
the flesh has been laid to rest.. She was blessed to have had you as her
forever family for so many years. I'm glad you were there to give her
comfort ......

I like to start my day with a good laugh, but I guess a good cry is okay
too. My Siamese cat Aiko was with me for 17 years and I know how
difficult it is to loose an animal that is so loved. I sit each day and
watch my 11½ year old St.Bernard grow weaker and weaker so I will be
experiencing your pain fairly soon I am afraid.
I hope your other cat can help fill the void a little.

The loss of any loved one (human or pet) is hard to handle,
but at least there is small comfort is knowing that you are
with them at the end, letting them know how very much you
loved them.

Having one die through an accident or alone can cause so
much more grief &amp; guilt.

Many of the things we have been discussing lately are
unproven, but just because our 5 senses can't identify them,
doesn't mean that they can't exist. If we believe that it
is possible &amp; it gives us comfort in our time of need, then
perhaps that is their only purpose.

While others have not, I've enjoyed these OT messages. I
feel the group has become more bonded &amp; sometimes
communication is more important than discussion.

"/> For all pet lovers . . .

A man and his dog were walking along a road. The man was enjoying
The scenery, when it suddenly occurred to him that he was dead. He
Remembered dying, and that the dog had been dead for years.
He wondered where the road was leading them. After a while, they
Came to a high, white stone wall along one side of the road. It looked like
Fine marble. At the top of a long hill, it was broken by a tall arch
That glowed in the sunlight. When he was standing before it, he saw a
magnificent gate in the arch that looked like mother of pearl, and the street
that
led to the gate looked like pure gold. He and the dog walked toward the gate,
and as hegot closer, he saw a man at a desk to one side.
When he was close enough, he called out, &quot;Excuse me, where are
we?&quot;
&quot;This is heaven, sir,&quot; the man answered.
&quot;Wow! Would you happen to have some water?&quot; the man asked.
&quot;Of course, sir. Come right in, and I'll have some ice water
brought right up.&quot; The man gestured, and the gate began to open.
&quot;Can my friend, gesturing toward his dog, come in, too?&quot; the
traveler asked.
&quot;I'm sorry, sir, but we don't accept pets.&quot;
The man thought a moment and then turned back toward the road and
Continued the way he had been going. After another long walk, and at the
top of another long hill, he came to a dirt road which led through a farm
gate that looked as if it had never been closed. There was no fence. As he
approached the gate, he saw a man inside, leaning against a tree
and reading a book.
&quot;Excuse me!&quot; he called to the reader. &quot;Do you have any water?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, sure, there's a pump over there&quot; The man pointed to a place
that couldn't be seen from outside the gate. &quot;Come on in.&quot;
&quot;How about my friend here?&quot; the traveler gestured to the dog.
&quot;There should be a bowl by the pump.&quot;
They went through the gate, and sure enough, there was an old
fashioned hand pump with a bowl beside it. The traveler filled the bowl and
took
a long drink himself, then he gave some to the dog. When they were full,
he and the dog walked back toward the man who was standing by the tree
waiting for them.
&quot;What do you call this place?&quot; the traveler asked.
&quot;This is heaven,&quot; was the answer.
&quot;Well, that's confusing,&quot; the traveler said. &quot;The man down the
road said that was heaven, too.&quot;
&quot;Oh, you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates?
Nope. That's hell.&quot;
&quot;Doesn't it make you mad for them to use your name like that?&quot;
&quot;No. I can see how you might think so, but we're just happy that
they screen out the folks who'll leave their best friends behind&quot;.

Doug,

I really understand how you feel because I had a wonderful cat for 18 years
also. She died 8 years ago and I still miss her. There is nothing I can say
to make you feel better but I wanted you to know I understand and how sorry I
am about your loss.

"/> Dear Doug-
I'm so sorry to hear about Teddy; we had exchanged a few notes in the past
about how wonderful Maine Coons are in general and especially in an antique
setting, where despite their apparent huge size, they can pick their way
through all sorts of breakables and never bump anything. When one well known
auction house lost their MCC it was about the only thing in that week's trade
paper's ad. And I know what you mean about the light in their eyes. I had to
put my Coontessa down about 4 years ago, but I still have a great picture of
her that was shot when she wanted center stage in the middle of a catalog
shoot. It's only one of 4 photos I ever put on the wall, and when people talk
about &quot;Dumb Animals&quot; they probably never had to match wits with a Maine Coon.
When you have had time to let the feelings of loss subside, you might want to
look for Retired Cats on the 'Net. That's where I found my second MCC, Hershey
(St. Michaels Hershey's Kiss) a pure bred kitten that a breeder had to give up
when she moved to a condo. It was an 800 mile drive back from Virginia with her
on my lap but well worth it. Also, the Maine Coon folks operate rescue programs
in many states. And if there is some sort of afterlife and it doesn't include
cats, I think I'll go to Philadelphia.

All Best-

Charley Kehoe
