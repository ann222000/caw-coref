I would like to get more info on mud farming or there are other names
of land treatment, and land spreading. I know of several locations
around me that are doing this. Have stopped and talked to some of the
workers, but they cant answer all my long winded questions. If there
is a web site or better yet a company person I could speak with would
be greatly appericiated.

i once posted on this matter on naro, and it elicited several
responses, especially with regard to environmental concernes. i know a
guy that is doing it at mayfield just west of sh171. next time i see
him out there i will stop and slog my way over to him and pick his
brain, as he and i are well aquainted. i bet that even though he has
two wells here locally he wont snub the ole fry guy.
fry the "already has mud on his ropers" guy
