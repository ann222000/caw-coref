&gt; Terror By the Poor and War For the Rich

&gt; By Patrick Grimm

&gt; http://www.zionistwatch.blogspot.com/

&gt; The sage-like Reverend Ted Pike and his intelligent and insightful
&gt; niece Harmony Grant have written two recent articles leaving us with
&gt; no doubt that Jewish power and Talmudic Judaism are a much greater
&gt; threat to America than radical Islam could ever hope to be. Yet, as
&gt; Pike and Grant tell us, we only hear about one (Muslims) and never
&gt; about the other (Jews) when we open a newspaper or turn on the Jew
&gt; Tube. In fact, the chorus of fear mongering regarding Islam has now
&gt; reached a crescendo, this deafening din, this cacophony drowning out
&gt; any passing mention of the much better organized Enemy (with a capital
&gt; E) of humanity that is Big Jewry. Big Jewry is well-oiled in its
&gt; machinations, its gears grinding up dissent and opposition like ground
&gt; chuck.

&gt; Islam, at least in its more rabid forms, is a fighting faith, and it
&gt; has launched terror in many different parts of the world. But the fact
&gt; that Muslims feel the need for these kinds of attacks, rather than
&gt; other types of protest, doesn't attest to Islam's strength. These are
&gt; a poor people who are desperate and resort to hackneyed forms of
&gt; terror, while strong states use full-blown war. The old adage goes
&gt; &quot;Terrorism is the war by the poor, and war is terrorism by the rich.&quot;
&gt; [1] Exactly right, exactly right.

&gt; The war of the rich takes place without end for Big Jewry in Iraq and
&gt; on many other fronts, while reactionary terror by Islamist foot
&gt; soldiers attests to the truth of the aforementioned adage. Israel
&gt; drops bombs on Palestinian neighborhoods, while Palestinians angrily
&gt; retaliate by hooking explosives to their backs. We can see which side
&gt; is coming from the position of wealth and strength, mainly because
&gt; they have American-made bullets, bombs and nukes.

&gt; If we are, with a straight and solemn face, supposed to believe that
&gt; the bogeyman of Islam is the greatest threat to America since the Red
&gt; Commies, then why does almost every Muslim nation on earth seem
&gt; isolated, disorganized, backward and poverty-stricken? Muslim states
&gt; may be enraged at the United States, and as of late, they may have
&gt; every reason for this enragement, but they hardly seem to be the
&gt; colossus inflicting calamity that the American-Israeli media want us
&gt; to believe they are.

&gt; Even Israel, one of the biggest nuclear powers on earth and the
&gt; biggest in the Middle East, slants their public relations statements
&gt; to the effect of &quot;The Arabs are poised to push the Jews into the sea.&quot;
&gt; Nonsense. Israel is a nuclear powerhouse, while its neighbors are not
&gt; the beneficiaries of a drunken sailor US government gone loony, now
&gt; splashing the Jews with largesse and cutting edge technology and
&gt; military hardware. The Jews just have better PR than the Arabs do,
&gt; hence Americans are fooled, and fooled effortlessly.

&gt; A people who own the media, Hollywood, the Federal Reserve, the World
&gt; Bank, publishing companies, the US government, the Pentagon, the White
&gt; House, etc. etc. etc. and are using all those things in a most non-
&gt; benign manner against the American people are supposed to be ignored,
&gt; while a ragtag band of Third World Arabs, so desperate that they have
&gt; to craft dirty bombs and stage suicide attacks, are the people we
&gt; supposedly should be terrified of. It's sheer mass stupidity which
&gt; permits our controlled media to construct this fraudulent template.

&gt; And yet, I know, just as surely as Chertoff, the CIA and the Mossad
&gt; will kill more Americans with false flag attacks, that the Christian
&gt; Zionists have bought the Big Lie of &quot;Islamofascism.&quot; The &quot;Christian&quot;
&gt; morons in our churches will allow the Jews to push them right over the
&gt; cliff. They will fight the wars the Jews want them to fight and kill
&gt; the people the Jews want them to kill. How do I know this? I know this
&gt; because the pseudo-Christian Zionists &quot;know&quot; that &quot;God will curse
&gt; them&quot; if they ever dare to criticize His (Self-) Chosen People. The
&gt; Jewish Zionist mind and the Christian Zionist mind are as different as
&gt; a Mensan and the village idiot. They are as different as the
&gt; disparate, but oddly united &quot;Odd Couple&quot; of &quot;war&quot; and &quot;terrorism.&quot;
