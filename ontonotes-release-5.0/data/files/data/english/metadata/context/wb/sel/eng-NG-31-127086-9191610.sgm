Aloha Everyone!

I've read this almost three times and for some reason (because my
brain is turning into mush as the days, weeks, months, years and
decades go by without much mental exercise thanks to severe pain and/
or the medications needed to keep me sane enough to continue living) I
simply cannot deduce what conclusion(s) (if any) were made from this
study!  Will somebody please give this a read and let me know if
&quot;they&quot; decided whether or not that old 1-10 pain scale, that we are
all so painfully familiar with, is accurate or not?

I used to be good at deciphering non-layman word usage. It's almost a
prerequisite in order to understand the tax laws and protocol that the
Internal Revenue Service changes from year to year and sometimes more
often.

They really lost me here! LOL!

Release Date: September 20, 2007;

September 20, 2007 — In the primary care setting, the pain numeric
rating scale to screen for pain was only moderately accurate in
identifying pain in patients, according to the results of a study
reported in the August 1 Online First issue and will appear in the
October print issue of the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

&quot;Universal pain screening with a 0-10 pain intensity numeric rating
scale (NRS) has been widely implemented in primary care,&quot; write Erin
E. Krebs, MD, MPH, from the Center on Implementing Evidence-Based
Practice, Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Indianapolis,
Indiana, and colleagues. &quot;Universal screening in primary care would be
useful if it accurately identified patients with clinically important
pain who could potentially benefit from additional pain assessment and
management.... The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommends that two criteria be met before a screening test is
recommended for widespread use: (1) the test should be sufficiently
accurate and capable of detecting a condition earlier than routine
care and, (2) screening and early treatment should improve the
likelihood of favorable patient outcomes.&quot;

In this prospective, diagnostic accuracy study, 275 adult clinic
patients were enrolled from September 2005 to March 2006 and were
tested for clinically important pain with the use of 2 alternate
definitions: pain interfering with functioning (Brief Pain Inventory
interference scale
[BPI] ≥ 5) and pain motivating a visit to the clinician or being the
patient-reported reason for the visit.

A pain symptom being the main reason for a visit to the clinician was
reported by 22% of patients, with the most frequently reported pain
locations being in the lower extremity (21%) and back or neck (18%).

As a test for pain that interferes with functioning, the NRS had fair
accuracy, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) curve of 0.76. A pain screening NRS score of 1 was 69% sensitive
for pain that interferes with functioning (95% confidence interval
[CI], 60 - 78), and multilevel likelihood ratios for scores of 0, 1 to
3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 10 were 0.39 (95% CI, 0.29 - 0.53), 0.99 (95% CI,
0.38 - 2.60), 2.67 (95% CI, 1.56 - 4.57), and 5.60 (95% CI, 3.06 -
10.26), respectively.

Use of the alternate definition of pain that motivates a visit to the
clinician yielded similar results.

Limitations of the study include the absence of a well-established
gold standard for clinically important pain, potential selection bias,
and lack of generalizability to all primary care settings.

&quot;The practice of universal pain screening has become widespread
despite a lack of published research evaluating the accuracy and
effectiveness of pain screening strategies,&quot; the study authors
conclude. &quot;Our results suggest that the most commonly used measure for
pain screening may have only modest accuracy for identifying patients
with clinically important pain in primary care. Further research is
needed to determine whether pain screening improves patient outcomes
in primary care.&quot;

with the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans
Affairs.

Clinical Context
Approximately 20% of primary care patients experience chronic pain,
and pain screening is intended to improve the quality of pain
management by systematically identifying patients with pain in
clinical settings, but currently there is no commonly accepted gold
standard for clinically important pain. The NRS on which patients rate
their pain as 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst pain&quot;) has become the most
widely used instrument for pain screening. The potential advantages of
the NRS are it is short, easy to administer, and is validated as a
measure of intensity of pain in populations with known pain. However,
no studies have evaluated its accuracy as a screening test to identify
patients with clinically important pain.

This is a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of consecutive
patients presenting to a primary care outpatient clinic to compare the
NRS used as a screening tool with 2 functional measures of pain: the
BPI interference scale and a question on pain that motivates a visit
to the clinician.

Study Highlights
*Included were consecutive patients presenting to 1 outpatient clinic
who consented to completing a face-to-face interview after the
clinician visit.
*Excluded were patients who did not speak English.
*As a routine, the NRS was completed with the vital signs for all
patients, and a nurse documented the answers in the electronic medical
record.
*Patients with an NRS score of 1 or higher were oversampled for
analysis.
20% of the sample had an NRS score of 0.
*Participants were interviewed after the clinician visit.
*Nursing notes, dictated physician notes, and problem lists were
abstracted from the medical records after the interview.
*The BPI was administered.
*The BPI measures 7 domains: general activity, mood, walking ability,
normal work, relationships with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of
life.
*Possible BPI scores ranged from 0 (&quot;does not interfere&quot;) to 10
(&quot;interferes completely&quot;), and a lead-in question was used to define
pain as other than &quot;everyday pains such as minor headaches, sprains,
and toothaches.&quot;
*2 questions were used to elicit the reason for the visit: &quot;What is
the main reason for your visit?&quot; and &quot;What other concerns would you
like to talk to your doctor about today?&quot;
*Responses were classified as pain symptom, nonpain symptom, or
other.
*Because there is no criterion standard definition of clinically
important pain, the investigators operationalized the definition as
pain that interferes with functioning and pain that motivates a
clinician visit.
*A score of 5 or greater on the BPI interference scale was used as the
reference standard for pain interfering with function.
*The ROC curves for the NRS were compared with the reference standards
for function and motivation.
*Of 548 patients approached, 357 consented and 77% were included in
the analysis.
*Mean age of the patients was 55 years, each patient had an average of
1.9 conditions, 80% saw their regular physician, and 46% saw a
resident physician.
*40% of patients reported a pain symptom as the reason for the visit,
with 22% reporting the pain as a primary and 18% as a secondary
concern.
*Among participants with an NRS screening score of 1 or greater, the
mean score was 6.0.
*Most patients reported musculoskeletal pain, with the most common
locations in the lower extremity (21%) and back or neck (18%).
*55% of patients overall and 77% with at least 1 pain symptom reported
persistent pain for 6 months or longer.
*The area under the ROC curve for the NRS vs the BPI (for a score of ≥
5) was 0.76.
*The lowest possible cut-off point (an NRS score of 1) was 69%
sensitive and 78% specific for functional interference.
*Thus, nearly one third of patients with pain-related functional
interference had an NRS score of 0.
*At the NRS score of 4, sensitivity was 64% and specificity was 83%.
*If the pretest probability of pain-related functional interference
was 40%, the post-test probabilities corresponding to scores of 0, 1
to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 10 would be 21%, 40%, 64%, and 79%,
respectively.
*The area under the ROC curve for the NRS vs the motivation for a
clinician visit was 0.78.
*21% of patients who reported pain as the primary reason for the visit
and 28% of those who reported pain as any reason for the visit had a
NRS score of 0.
*The sensitivity of an NRS score of 1 was 71%, and the specificity was
81%.
*An NRS score of 4 had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 83%.
*The study authors concluded that the NRS had only moderate accuracy
for identifying patients with clinically important pain.

Pearls for Practice

*Advantages of the NRS for pain screening are it is short, easy to
administer, and is validated as a measure of intensity of pain in
populations with known pain.

*Compared with measures of functional interference and reason for a
visit to the physician, the NRS has moderate accuracy.

Dear Wayne,

The way I get the article, is they'll continue to use the good old familiar
and inaccurate 1-10 scale. It's short and easy to administer, even though
it's only moderately (i.e.; so-so) accurate. They wont be getting rid of it
anytime soon.
All the more reason anybody serious about their pain control, keep a
journal. They can also refer to the Randall Pain scale, which while still
the old 1-10, encourages the patient to be more descriptive, both about the
pain intensity and the feeling, as well as how it affected the patient in
their lives.
You should check it out if you never tried it. It's a lot better than &quot;it's
a 7 today&quot;.
http://www2.rpa.net/~lrandall/painscale.html

Hope you have a low score, Wayne.--og

I think the key words here are &quot;clinically important pain,&quot; which
seems to mean pain that is relevant and related to the complaint for
which the patient presents to the doctor.

The biggest thing we have to remember is that pain is a subjective
sensation and what is no pain to someone may be intense, immobilizing
pain to someone else.  We have differerent experiences, different
tolerances, and different ways of measuring pain, so any universal
scale is only going to be moderately effective at best.

For example, my hubby's appendix ruptured on Thanksgiving weekend 2005
and he actually got up and went to work a few days later, working at
his factory job while the ruptured area walled itself in and created a
protective layer of scar tissue around the injury.  He did this for 2
1/2 months till one day when he couldn't sit down and then I dragged
him to the ER.  He still only rated his pain as a 7, and when they
went to explore, since the CT scan didn't show definitive
appendicitis, they had to open him up to clean up the mess in his
abdominal cavity.  What was going to be a lap appendectomy ended up
being an open one and one the surgeon said he had never seen the likes
of.

If a person ever invented a way to objectively measure pain, we'd be
in much better shape.  Until then, moderately effective is the best we
can hope for.

&gt;*2 questions were used to elicit the reason for the visit: &quot;What is
&gt;the main reason for your visit?&quot; and &quot;What other concerns would you
&gt;like to talk to your doctor about today?&quot;
&gt;*Responses were classified as pain symptom, nonpain symptom, or
&gt;other.
&gt;*Because there is no criterion standard definition of clinically
&gt;important pain, the investigators operationalized the definition as
&gt;pain that interferes with functioning and pain that motivates a
&gt;clinician visit.
&gt;*A score of 5 or greater on the BPI interference scale was used as the
&gt;reference standard for pain interfering with function.
&gt;*The ROC curves for the NRS were compared with the reference standards
&gt;for function and motivation.
&gt;*Of 548 patients approached, 357 consented and 77% were included in
&gt;the analysis.
&gt;*Mean age of the patients was 55 years, each patient had an average of
&gt;1.9 conditions, 80% saw their regular physician, and 46% saw a
&gt;resident physician.
&gt;*40% of patients reported a pain symptom as the reason for the visit,
&gt;with 22% reporting the pain as a primary and 18% as a secondary
&gt;concern.
&gt;*Among participants with an NRS screening score of 1 or greater, the
&gt;mean score was 6.0.
&gt;*Most patients reported musculoskeletal pain, with the most common
&gt;locations in the lower extremity (21%) and back or neck (18%).
&gt;*55% of patients overall and 77% with at least 1 pain symptom reported
&gt;persistent pain for 6 months or longer.
&gt;*The area under the ROC curve for the NRS vs the BPI (for a score of ?
&gt;5) was 0.76.
&gt;*The lowest possible cut-off point (an NRS score of 1) was 69%
&gt;sensitive and 78% specific for functional interference.
&gt;*Thus, nearly one third of patients with pain-related functional
&gt;interference had an NRS score of 0.
&gt;*At the NRS score of 4, sensitivity was 64% and specificity was 83%.
&gt;*If the pretest probability of pain-related functional interference
&gt;was 40%, the post-test probabilities corresponding to scores of 0, 1
&gt;to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 10 would be 21%, 40%, 64%, and 79%,
&gt;respectively.
&gt;*The area under the ROC curve for the NRS vs the motivation for a
&gt;clinician visit was 0.78.
&gt;*21% of patients who reported pain as the primary reason for the visit
&gt;and 28% of those who reported pain as any reason for the visit had a
&gt;NRS score of 0.
&gt;*The sensitivity of an NRS score of 1 was 71%, and the specificity was
&gt;81%.
&gt;*An NRS score of 4 had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 83%.
&gt;*The study authors concluded that the NRS had only moderate accuracy
&gt;for identifying patients with clinically important pain.

&gt;Pearls for Practice

&gt;*Advantages of the NRS for pain screening are it is short, easy to
&gt;administer, and is validated as a measure of intensity of pain in
&gt;populations with known pain.

&gt;*Compared with measures of functional interference and reason for a
&gt;visit to the physician, the NRS has moderate accuracy.
