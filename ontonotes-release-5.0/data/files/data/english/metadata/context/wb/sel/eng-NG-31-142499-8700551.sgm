(1) How Mossad Got America to Bomb Libya &amp; Fight Iraq

Victor Ostrovsky and Claire Hoy, By Way of Deception St Martin's Press, New York 1990.

{Ostrovsky's Foreword}

{p. vii} REVEALING THE FACTS as I know them from my vantage point of four years spent
inside the Mossad was by no means an easy task.

Coming from an ardent Zionist background, I had been taught that the state of Israel
was incapable of misconduct. That we were the David in the unending struggle against
the ever-growing Goliath. That there was no one out there to protect us but ourselves -
a feeling reinforced by the Holocaust survivors who lived among us.

We, the new generation of Israelites, the resurrected nation on its own land after more
than two thousand years of exile, were entrusted with the fate of the nation as a whole.

The commanders of our army were called champions, not generals. Our leaders were
captains at the helm of a great ship. I was elated when I was chosen and granted the
privilege to join what I considered to be the elite team of the Mossad.

But it was the twisted ideals and self-centered pragmatism that I encountered inside
the Mossad, coupled with this so-called team's greed, lust, and total lack of respect
for human life, that motivated me to tell this story.

It is out of love for Israel as a free and just country that I am laying my life on the
line by so doing, facing up to those who took it upon themselves to turn the Zionist
dream into the present-day nightmare.

{p. viii} The Mossad, being the intelligence body entrusted with the responsibility of
plotting the course for the leaders at the helm of the nation, has betrayed that trust.
Plotting on its own behalf, and for petty, self-serving reasons, it has set the nation
on a collision course with all-out war.

{Claire Hoy's Foreword}

{p. ix} One of the main themes of this book is Victor's belief that Mossad is out of
control, that even the prime minister, although ostensibly in charge, has no real
authority over its actions ...

{p. xi} The Mossad - believe it or not - has just 30 to 35 case officers, or katsas,
operating in the world at any one time. The main reason for this extraordinary low
total, as you will read in this book, is that unlike other countries, Israel can tap
the significant and loyal cadre of the worldwide Jewish community outside Israel. This
is done through a unique system of sayanim, volunteer Jewish helpers.

{Jointly written text - remainder of book}

{p. 52} My first six weeks were uneventful. I worked at the downtown office,
essentially as a gofer and filing clerk. But one chilly day in February 1984, I found
myself joining 14 others on a small bus. ... This course was to be known as Cadet 16,
as it was the sixteenth course of Mossad cadets.

{p. 53} He walked briskly to the head of the table while the other two sat at the back
of the room. &quot;My name is Aharon Sherf,&quot; he said. &quot;I am the head of the Academy. Welcome
to the Mossad. Its full name is Ha Mossad, le Modiyn ve le Tafkidim Mayuhadim [the
Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations]. Our motto is: 'By way of deception,
thou shalt do war.'

{p. 86} The next day Ran S. delivered a lecture on the sayanim, a unique and important
part of the Mossad's operation. Sayanim  -  assistants - must be 100 percent Jewish.
They live abroad, and though they are not Israeli citizens, many are reached through
their relatives in Israel. An Israeli with a relative in England, for example, might be
asked to write a letter saying the person bearing the letter represents an organization
whose main goal is to help save Jewish people in the diaspora. Could the British
relative help in any way?

There are thousands of sayanim around the world. In London alone, there are about 2,000
who are active, and another 5,000 on the list. They fulfill many different roles. A car
sayan, for example, running a rental agency, could help the Mossad rent a car without
having to complete the usual doc-

{p. 87} umentation. An apartment sayan would find accommodation without raising
suspicions, a bank sayan could get you money if you needed it in the middle of the
night, a doctor sayan would treat a bullet wound without reporting it to the police,
and so on. The idea is to have a pool of people available when needed who can provide
services but will keep quiet about them out of loyalty to the cause. They are paid only
costs. Often the loyalty of sayanim is abused by katsas who take advantage of the
available help for their own personal use. There is no way for the sayan to check this.

One thing you know for sure is that even if a Jewish person knows it is the Mossad, he
might not agree to work with you - but he won't turn you in. You have at your disposal
a nonrisk recruitment system that actually gives you a pool of millions of Jewish
people to tap from outside your own borders. It's much easier to operate with what is
available on the spot, and sayanim offer incredible practical support everywhere. But
they are never put at risk - nor are they privy to classified information.

Suppose during an operation a katsa suddenly had to come up with an electronics store
as a cover. A call to a sayan in that business could bring 50 television sets, 200 VCRs
- whatever was needed - from his warehouse to your building, and in next to no time,
you'd have a store with $3 or $4 million worth of stock in it.

Since most Mossad activity is in Europe, it may be preferable to have a business
address in North America. So, there are address sayanim and telephone sayanim. If a
katsa has to give out an address or a phone number, he can use the sayan's. And if the
sayan gets a letter or a phone call, he will know immediately how to proceed. Some
business sayanim have a bank of 20 operators answering phones, typing letters, faxing
messages, all a front for the Mossad. The joke is that 60 percent of the business of
those telephone answering companies in Europe comes from the Mossad. They'd fold otherwise.

The one problem with the system is that the Mossad does not seem to care how
devastating it could be to the status of the Jewish people in the diaspora if it was
known. The an-

{p. 88} swer you get if you ask is: &quot;So what's the worst that could happen to those
Jews? They'd all come to Israel? Great.&quot;

Katsas in the stations are in charge of the sayanim, and most active sayanim will be
visited by a katsa once every three months or so, which for the katsa usually means
between two and four face-to-face meetings a day with sayanim, along with numerous
telephone conversations. The system allows the Mossad to work with a skeleton staff.
That's why, for example, a KGB station would employ about 100 people, while a
comparable Mossad station would need only six or seven.

{p. 269} Pollard was not Mossad, but many others actively spying, recruiting,
organizing, and carrying out covert activities - mainly in New York and Washington,
which they refer to as their &quot;playground&quot; - do belong to a special, super-secret
division of the Mossad called simply Al, Hebrew for &quot;above&quot; or &quot;on top.&quot;

The unit is so secretive, and so separate from the main o ganization, that the majority
of Mossad employees don't even know what it does and do not have access to its files on
the computer.

But it exists, and employs between 24 and 27 veteran field personnel, three as active
katsas. Most, though not all, of their activity is within U.S. borders. Their primary
task is to gather information on the Arab world and the PLO, as opposed to gathering
intelligence about U.S. activities. But as we shall see, the dividing line is often
blurred, and when in doubt, Al doesn't hesitate to cross over it.

To say it doesn't gather information on the Americans is like saying mustard is not the
main course, but you do like a little on your hotdog. Say, for example, there's a
senator on the arms committee who interests Mossad. Al rarely uses sayanim, but that
senator's paperwork, anything happening in his office, would be important information,
so an aide would become a target. If an aide was Jewish, he or she would be approached
as a sayan. Otherwise, the person would be recruited as an agent, or even just as a
friend, with whom to mingle and listen.

The Washington cocktail circuit is very important for that. Certain attaches keep track
of it. There is no problem adding someone to that circuit and giving it a legitimate ring.

Suppose, for instance, McDonnell Douglas wants to sell U.S.-made airplanes to Saudi
Arabia. Is that a U.S. issue or an Israeli issue? Well, as far as the Institute is
concerned, it's Israel's business. When you have something like that in place, it's
very difficult not to use it. So they do.

{p. 270} One of the more famous of Al's activities involved the theft of research
material from some major U.S. aircraft-manufacturing firms to help Israel secure a
five-year, $25.8 million contract in January 1986 to supply the U.S. navy (shipboard)
and marine corps with 21 16-foot-long drones, or unmanned Mazlat Pioneer 1 aircraft,
plus the accompanying ground control, launch, and recovery equipment. The drones, which
have a television monitor mounted underneath, are used in military reconnaissance work.
Mazlat, a subsidiary of the state-run Israeli Aeronautical Industries and Tadiran,
&quot;won&quot; the contract after outbidding U.S. firms in a 1985 tender.

In reality, Al stole the research. Israel had been working on a drone, but was not
nearly far enough advanced to enter this competition. When you don't have to include
research recovery costs in your bid, it makes a substantial difference.

After winning the contract, Mazlat went into partnership with AAI Corp. of Baltimore,
Maryland, to complete it.

Al is similar to Tsomet, but it does not come under the jurisdiction of the head of
Tsomet. Rather, it reports directly to the head of Mossad. Unlike normal Mossad
stations, it does

Excellent article, indeed.

It is obvious that many of the Jewish posters on the mid-east ngs

&gt; &gt; The one problem with the system is that the Mossad does not seem to care
&gt; &gt; how devastating it could be to the status of the Jewish people in the
&gt; &gt; diaspora if it was known. The an-

&gt; &gt; {p. 88} swer you get if you ask is: &quot;So what's the worst that could
&gt; &gt; happen to those Jews? They'd all come to Israel? Great.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Katsas in the stations are in charge of the sayanim, and most active
&gt; &gt; sayanim will be visited by a katsa once every three months or so, which
&gt; &gt; for the katsa usually means between two and four face-to-face meetings a
&gt; &gt; day with sayanim, along with numerous telephone conversations. The
&gt; &gt; system allows the Mossad to work with a skeleton staff. That's why, for
&gt; &gt; example, a KGB station would employ about 100 people, while a comparable
&gt; &gt; Mossad station would need only six or seven.

&gt; &gt; {p. 269} Pollard was not Mossad, but many others actively spying,
&gt; &gt; recruiting, organizing, and carrying out covert activities - mainly in
&gt; &gt; New York and Washington, which they refer to as their &quot;playground&quot; - do
&gt; &gt; belong to a special, super-secret division of the Mossad called simply
&gt; &gt; Al, Hebrew for &quot;above&quot; or &quot;on top.&quot;

&gt; &gt; The unit is so secretive, and so separate from the main o ganization,
&gt; &gt; that the majority of Mossad employees don't even know what it does and
&gt; &gt; do not have access to its files on the computer.

&gt; &gt; But it exists, and employs between 24 and 27 veteran field personnel,
&gt; &gt; three as active katsas. Most, though not all, of their activity is
&gt; &gt; within U.S. borders. Their primary task is to gather information on the
&gt; &gt; Arab world and the PLO, as opposed to gathering intelligence about U.S.
&gt; &gt; activities. But as we shall see, the dividing line is often blurred, and
&gt; &gt; when in doubt, Al doesn't hesitate to cross over it.

&gt; &gt; To say it doesn't gather information on the Americans is like saying
&gt; &gt; mustard is not the main course, but you do like a little on your hotdog.
&gt; &gt; Say, for example, there's a senator on the arms committee who interests
&gt; &gt; Mossad. Al rarely uses sayanim, but that senator's paperwork, anything
&gt; &gt; happening in his office, would be important information, so an aide
&gt; &gt; would become a target. If an aide was Jewish, he or she would be
&gt; &gt; approached as a sayan. Otherwise, the person would be recruited as an
&gt; &gt; agent, or even just as a friend, with whom to mingle and listen.

&gt; &gt; The Washington cocktail circuit is very important for that. Certain
&gt; &gt; attaches keep track of it. There is no problem adding someone to that
&gt; &gt; circuit and giving it a legitimate ring.

&gt; &gt; Suppose, for instance, McDonnell Douglas wants to sell U.S.-made
&gt; &gt; airplanes to Saudi Arabia. Is that a U.S. issue or an Israeli issue?
&gt; &gt; Well, as far as the Institute is concerned, it's Israel's business. When
&gt; &gt; you have something like that in place, it's very difficult not to use
&gt; &gt; it. So they do.

&gt; &gt; {p. 270} One of the more famous of Al's activities involved the theft of
&gt; &gt; research material from some major U.S. aircraft-manufacturing firms to
&gt; &gt; help Israel secure a five-year, $25.8 million contract in January 1986
&gt; &gt; to supply the U.S. navy (shipboard) and marine corps with 21
&gt; &gt; 16-foot-long drones, or unmanned Mazlat Pioneer 1 aircraft, plus the

Why would any Jew want to be a Sayan when he or she can in most case

It was actually Israel that bombed Iraq in 1979. They blew up an Iraqi power
plant. When is Israel going to be made to destroy its ILLEGAL nuclear
weapons?
Even superpowers like Germany and Italy (ranked 3rd and 5th in the world)
don't have any nuclear weapons that we know of. So why does this
insignificant little area of Palestine with 8m people need them? They have
big brother, US, to protect them and do their dirty work.

&gt; Mirelle
&gt;&gt; &gt; (1) How Mossad Got America to Bomb Libya &amp; Fight Iraq

&gt;&gt; &gt; Victor Ostrovsky and Claire Hoy, By Way of Deception St Martin's Press,
&gt;&gt; &gt; New York 1990.

&gt;&gt; &gt; {Ostrovsky's Foreword}

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. vii} REVEALING THE FACTS as I know them from my vantage point of
&gt;&gt; &gt; four years spent inside the Mossad was by no means an easy task.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Coming from an ardent Zionist background, I had been taught that the
&gt;&gt; &gt; state of Israel was incapable of misconduct. That we were the David in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the unending struggle against the ever-growing Goliath. That there was
&gt;&gt; &gt; no one out there to protect us but ourselves - a feeling reinforced by
&gt;&gt; &gt; the Holocaust survivors who lived among us.

&gt;&gt; &gt; We, the new generation of Israelites, the resurrected nation on its own
&gt;&gt; &gt; land after more than two thousand years of exile, were entrusted with
&gt;&gt; &gt; the fate of the nation as a whole.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The commanders of our army were called champions, not generals. Our
&gt;&gt; &gt; leaders were captains at the helm of a great ship. I was elated when I
&gt;&gt; &gt; was chosen and granted the privilege to join what I considered to be
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; elite team of the Mossad.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But it was the twisted ideals and self-centered pragmatism that I
&gt;&gt; &gt; encountered inside the Mossad, coupled with this so-called team's
&gt;&gt; &gt; greed,
&gt;&gt; &gt; lust, and total lack of respect for human life, that motivated me to
&gt;&gt; &gt; tell this story.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It is out of love for Israel as a free and just country that I am
&gt;&gt; &gt; laying
&gt;&gt; &gt; my life on the line by so doing, facing up to those who took it upon
&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves to turn the Zionist dream into the present-day nightmare.

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. viii} The Mossad, being the intelligence body entrusted with the
&gt;&gt; &gt; responsibility of plotting the course for the leaders at the helm of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; nation, has betrayed that trust. Plotting on its own behalf, and for
&gt;&gt; &gt; petty, self-serving reasons, it has set the nation on a collision
&gt;&gt; &gt; course
&gt;&gt; &gt; with all-out war.

&gt;&gt; &gt; {Claire Hoy's Foreword}

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. ix} One of the main themes of this book is Victor's belief that
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mossad is out of control, that even the prime minister, although
&gt;&gt; &gt; ostensibly in charge, has no real authority over its actions ...

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. xi} The Mossad - believe it or not - has just 30 to 35 case
&gt;&gt; &gt; officers, or katsas, operating in the world at any one time. The main
&gt;&gt; &gt; reason for this extraordinary low total, as you will read in this book,
&gt;&gt; &gt; is that unlike other countries, Israel can tap the significant and
&gt;&gt; &gt; loyal
&gt;&gt; &gt; cadre of the worldwide Jewish community outside Israel. This is done
&gt;&gt; &gt; through a unique system of sayanim, volunteer Jewish helpers.

&gt;&gt; &gt; {Jointly written text - remainder of book}

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. 52} My first six weeks were uneventful. I worked at the downtown
&gt;&gt; &gt; office, essentially as a gofer and filing clerk. But one chilly day in
&gt;&gt; &gt; February 1984, I found myself joining 14 others on a small bus. ...
&gt;&gt; &gt; This
&gt;&gt; &gt; course was to be known as Cadet 16, as it was the sixteenth course of
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mossad cadets.

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. 53} He walked briskly to the head of the table while the other two
&gt;&gt; &gt; sat at the back of the room. &quot;My name is Aharon Sherf,&quot; he said. &quot;I am
&gt;&gt; &gt; the head of the Academy. Welcome to the Mossad. Its full name is Ha
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mossad, le Modiyn ve le Tafkidim Mayuhadim [the Institute for
&gt;&gt; &gt; Intelligence and Special Operations]. Our motto is: 'By way of
&gt;&gt; &gt; deception, thou shalt do war.'

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. 86} The next day Ran S. delivered a lecture on the sayanim, a
&gt;&gt; &gt; unique
&gt;&gt; &gt; and important part of the Mossad's operation. Sayanim  -  assistants -
&gt;&gt; &gt; must be 100 percent Jewish. They live abroad, and though they are not
&gt;&gt; &gt; Israeli citizens, many are reached through their relatives in Israel.
&gt;&gt; &gt; An
&gt;&gt; &gt; Israeli with a relative in England, for example, might be asked to
&gt;&gt; &gt; write
&gt;&gt; &gt; a letter saying the person bearing the letter represents an
&gt;&gt; &gt; organization
&gt;&gt; &gt; whose main goal is to help save Jewish people in the diaspora. Could
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; British relative help in any way?

&gt;&gt; &gt; There are thousands of sayanim around the world. In London alone, there
&gt;&gt; &gt; are about 2,000 who are active, and another 5,000 on the list. They
&gt;&gt; &gt; fulfill many different roles. A car sayan, for example, running a
&gt;&gt; &gt; rental
&gt;&gt; &gt; agency, could help the Mossad rent a car without having to complete the
&gt;&gt; &gt; usual doc-

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. 87} umentation. An apartment sayan would find accommodation without
&gt;&gt; &gt; raising suspicions, a bank sayan could get you money if you needed it
&gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the middle of the night, a doctor sayan would treat a bullet wound
&gt;&gt; &gt; without reporting it to the police, and so on. The idea is to have a
&gt;&gt; &gt; pool of people available when needed who can provide services but will
&gt;&gt; &gt; keep quiet about them out of loyalty to the cause. They are paid only
&gt;&gt; &gt; costs. Often the loyalty of sayanim is abused by katsas who take
&gt;&gt; &gt; advantage of the available help for their own personal use. There is no
&gt;&gt; &gt; way for the sayan to check this.

&gt;&gt; &gt; One thing you know for sure is that even if a Jewish person knows it is
&gt;&gt; &gt; the Mossad, he might not agree to work with you - but he won't turn you
&gt;&gt; &gt; in. You have at your disposal a nonrisk recruitment system that
&gt;&gt; &gt; actually
&gt;&gt; &gt; gives you a pool of millions of Jewish people to tap from outside your
&gt;&gt; &gt; own borders. It's much easier to operate with what is available on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; spot, and sayanim offer incredible practical support everywhere. But
&gt;&gt; &gt; they are never put at risk - nor are they privy to classified
&gt;&gt; &gt; information.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Suppose during an operation a katsa suddenly had to come up with an
&gt;&gt; &gt; electronics store as a cover. A call to a sayan in that business could
&gt;&gt; &gt; bring 50 television sets, 200 VCRs - whatever was needed - from his
&gt;&gt; &gt; warehouse to your building, and in next to no time, you'd have a store
&gt;&gt; &gt; with $3 or $4 million worth of stock in it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Since most Mossad activity is in Europe, it may be preferable to have a
&gt;&gt; &gt; business address in North America. So, there are address sayanim and
&gt;&gt; &gt; telephone sayanim. If a katsa has to give out an address or a phone
&gt;&gt; &gt; number, he can use the sayan's. And if the sayan gets a letter or a
&gt;&gt; &gt; phone call, he will know immediately how to proceed. Some business
&gt;&gt; &gt; sayanim have a bank of 20 operators answering phones, typing letters,
&gt;&gt; &gt; faxing messages, all a front for the Mossad. The joke is that 60
&gt;&gt; &gt; percent
&gt;&gt; &gt; of the business of those telephone answering companies in Europe comes
&gt;&gt; &gt; from the Mossad. They'd fold otherwise.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The one problem with the system is that the Mossad does not seem to
&gt;&gt; &gt; care
&gt;&gt; &gt; how devastating it could be to the status of the Jewish people in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; diaspora if it was known. The an-

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. 88} swer you get if you ask is: &quot;So what's the worst that could
&gt;&gt; &gt; happen to those Jews? They'd all come to Israel? Great.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Katsas in the stations are in charge of the sayanim, and most active
&gt;&gt; &gt; sayanim will be visited by a katsa once every three months or so, which
&gt;&gt; &gt; for the katsa usually means between two and four face-to-face meetings
&gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt; day with sayanim, along with numerous telephone conversations. The
&gt;&gt; &gt; system allows the Mossad to work with a skeleton staff. That's why, for
&gt;&gt; &gt; example, a KGB station would employ about 100 people, while a
&gt;&gt; &gt; comparable
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mossad station would need only six or seven.

&gt;&gt; &gt; {p. 269} Pollard was not Mossad, but many others actively spying,
&gt;&gt; &gt; recruiting, organizing, and carrying out covert activities - mainly in
&gt;&gt; &gt; New York and Washington, which they refer to as their &quot;playground&quot; - do
&gt;&gt; &gt; belong to a special, super-secret division of the Mossad called simply
&gt;&gt; &gt; Al, Hebrew for &quot;above&quot; or &quot;on top.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; The unit is so secretive, and so separate from the main o ganization,
&gt;&gt; &gt; that the majority of Mossad employees don't even know what it does and
&gt;&gt; &gt; do not have access to its files on the computer.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But it exists, and employs between 24 and 27 veteran field personnel,
&gt;&gt; &gt; three as active katsas. Most, though not all, of their activity is
&gt;&gt; &gt; within U.S. borders. Their primary task is to gather information on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Arab world and the PLO, as opposed to gathering intelligence about U.S.
&gt;&gt; &gt; activities. But as we shall see, the dividing line is often blurred,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; when in doubt, Al doesn't hesitate to cross over it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; To say it doesn't gather information on the Americans is like saying
&gt;&gt; &gt; mustard is not the main course, but you do like a little on your
&gt;&gt; &gt; hotdog.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Say, for example, there's a senator on the arms committee who interests
