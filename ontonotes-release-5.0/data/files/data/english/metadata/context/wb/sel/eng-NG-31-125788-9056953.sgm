...we have got the current prolonged and strident campaign from the
National Party. But I don't think for a second they really believe
that democracy is in peril from this bill. It is laughable to argue
that it is &quot;an assault on what it means to be a New Zealander&quot;. They
have spotted real faults in the wording of the bill that other people
pointed out as well. But beyond that the campaign is insincere game
playing.

What is going on? First and obviously, National has found an issue
with which to batter the Government. This is about politics, not
policy. By hyping the issue week after week, by making a mountain out
of a molehill and dancing triumphantly on top of it, they look strong
and the government looks weak.

Secondly, there is the benefit for National of having an issue to
agitate about that has nothing to do with tricky things like health,
education and privatisation - issues that might raise questions
National prefers to play down. Thirdly, and most satisfyingly for
National, it allows them to be taking the moral high ground in an area
where they should be chastened and apologetic.

Here we come to the point. By focussing attention on the deficiencies
of the bill's third-party wording, National has deflected attention
away from the reasons why this bill was needed and promoted in the
first place. This includes National's secret collaboration with the
Exclusive Brethren, who pumped nearly $1,500,000 into advertising to
try to get National elected, and National's subsequent untruthful
denials over this collaboration. This is what the bill's third-party
rules are about: stopping wealthy interests getting too much influence
in a supposedly one-person one-vote election.

The bill's opponents don't acknowledge it (and some may not
understand), but what's fundamentally at issue is the 'right' of very
wealthy people and lobbies to use their financial power to gain
disproportionate influence. The bill is designed to control only those
who have many tens of thousands of dollars to spend promoting their
preferred party or candidates. This is fundamentally different to
freedom of speech. It is more like the freedom to speak louder than or
even drown out ordinary people. Once the drafting errors affecting
ordinary political activity are corrected, the remaining objections
are not about human rights or democracy. To the contrary, they are
about the opposite: about preserving the power of the very wealthy to
gain an undue and undemocratic influence over the political process.

By stridently fighting drafting errors that are going to be fixed
anyway, National has been able to look principled when actually it is
acting out of self interest. Lost in the commotion is the fact that
they are fighting worthwhile parts of the bill that are designed to
reduce big money in elections, money that is most likely to be
supporting National. Please notice what is going on. They are
deliberately blurring their opposition to the drafting errors together
with opposition to the good and important parts of the bill. Far from
admitting past dishonesty and helping to stop this stuff in future,
they are using their defence-of-democracy campaign to try to stop
important democratic measures in the bill - measures they claim to
support [see Key's speech for examples] at the same time as calling
for the whole bill to be torn up.

National has got away with this cynical and highly successful campaign
because of too much uncritical journalism. All that seems to matter is
that they are 'newsmakers' providing juicy quotations. Never mind that
it is artifice and cynicism. It works if enough of the media don't ask
challenging questions and pass on each successive set of contrived
quotations uncritically to the public. That National has got away with
this campaign to date is evidence of where some of the genuine
problems of our democracy lie.

Thank you for another paste. You must know I can't read original articles.
Is Nicky Hagar really the authority for this issue? Whether you or Hagar
want to believe it or not this bill is designed to nobble National as much
as possible. In itself it is not going to destroy democracy. But then
experience around the world shows democracy is destroyed in stages. Each
stage usually seems very reasonable. Ask yourself if National wins the next
election will you be happy if they use this legislation against Labour? You
won't! Your opinion will be reversed.

&gt; National is against the bill essentially for 2 major reasons. It proposes to
&gt; limit 'secret' third party spending and extends the spending limits out to 1
&gt; year before an election. Those were two areas National exploited at the last
&gt; election, especially covert spending and electioneering. Of course they will
&gt; fight the bill, it cuts across their interests. Much of the rhetoric about
&gt; freedoms etc can be stripped away. Most if not all legitemate concerns in
&gt; that area will be solved through select committee &amp; redrafting work. The end
&gt; result threatens to close down two of the loop holes National used to great
&gt; effect at the last election. Were the tables turned, with National in power
&gt; &amp; Labour using such tactics, National would be proposing similar
&gt; legislation.
">

The facts remain that it's an odious piece of legislation that is
universally decried by most NZ organisations as undemocratic and
would constrain freedom of speech in this country for a third of
people's lives.

When darling of the left Nicky Hager describes it as akin to
something from the Nazi Party, you know something ain't right.

Did you see by the link that the top post is BY NICKY HAGER?! (Sorry,
I need to use caps, because you clearly did not read it.) I have
stated in this and other posts that the statement was taken out of
context and was qualified by this opinion on the poor drafting that
needed some revisions:

&quot;From a publicity-hungry opposition party point of view, there was a
small and totally legitimate point to be scored. This was clumsy
drafting. Didn't the politicians read and understand those parts of
the bill before introducing it to Parliament? Who was sleeping at the
wheel that day?  (again THIS is BY NICKY HAGER)
BUT he says...The bill's opponents don't acknowledge it (and some may
not understand), but what's fundamentally at issue is the 'right' of
very wealthy people and lobbies to use their financial power to gain
disproportionate influence. The bill is designed to control only those
who have many tens of thousands of dollars to spend promoting their
preferred party or candidates. This is fundamentally different to

That is, it deserved some &quot;do-your-job-properly&quot; criticism from the
opposition parties. It warranted some news stories on clumsy drafting,
how the Government had got it wrong and hopefully some comment on how
best to fix the bill.
