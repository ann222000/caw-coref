Gypsy is 8 years old and she's travelled this planet since she learned how
to shift her little paws in a forward motion. Sadly her attitude prevents
her from strteaking any further than down the end of our road, so she
usually flashes at people if they come near her.

This tendancy is a little worrying considering her father was castrated when
he was about two years old, one would think that these disorders would
thrash themselves out by the time they'd become a grown up.

Gypsy is currently lying on my bed dribbling at the thought that I might
come and tickle her tummy. She also likes to pretend she's a bird by
practising her chirping noises. This hasn't fooled any of our birdie friends
and they continue to ignore her whenever she enters the garden.

I hope to release her into the wild woods of th forest nearby and watch as
she leaps into her natural enviroment with glee. But I know she'll prefer to
sit comfortably on my bed and wash her paws clean from any dust. So the
travelling Terestrial will have to wait until her next dose of excitement...
Thank you for reading.
