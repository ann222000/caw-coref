There has been, and probably always will be, endless debate over what
is a good wife. There is

this article, supposedly from a May 1955 Housekeeping Monthly
magazine, that speaks directly

to this question. There are other sources as well that speak on the
issue. One is from

Aristotle, another is this one about &quot;Do men really want a wife like
June Cleaver.&quot; They bring

up some very good points.

source : http://www.goodwife.com/

It is one of those questions that heats up each side of the debate and
truly has a different

answer for each man. What do you want in a wife? Beauty? Brains?
Charm? Home and family

oriented? Strong willed? Independent? Docile? If you write out a list
of the ten things that

you must have in your life partner what would they be? Only you can
decide the answers to this

question.

Personally, I think the June Cleaver character has been much maligned
in recountings of the Leave It To Beaver saga. If you actually watch
the show, you'll see she was NOT a deferring airhead.

Sure, she was devoted to her family and knew how to work the business
end of a vacuum cleaner, but she was written and played as smart and
strong-minded. She didn't take any crap from Ward and she saw right
through Eddie Haskel's b.s.

Anyone remember the &quot;Brussels Sprouts&quot; episode where Beaver didn't
want to eat them because he didn't like the way they looked and June
was adamant that the little peckerhead was going to at least try them.
I.e. - make a decision based on facts not preconceived notions? And it
turned out he liked them after all.  It was Ward who was willing to
wuss out and let the Beav forgo the Brussels Sprouts experience.

That show in general has gotten something of bum rap. Everyone seems
to regard it as fluff, but noone seems to remember that though often
lighhearted, it tackled some pretty real issues. I recall there was
even an episode dealing pretty matter-of-factly with alcoholism.

Do I want a wife like June? You bet.

Hey. She's a raping husband's dream wife. Anytime Ward wants a good
fuck, she's ready to take it in the ass, whether she wants it or not.
She's probably a great push-over. Yeah. Yeah... I think every husband
_would_ like a wife like June. :-) Thanks for playing.
