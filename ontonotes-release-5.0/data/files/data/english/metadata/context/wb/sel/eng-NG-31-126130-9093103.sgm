She did the same thing at a diner in upstate NY when she was running
for senate.

Clinton's Tipping Point?
November 08, 2007 9:43 AM

ABC News' Eloise Harper Reports: Rule number one when campaigning at a
diner: always leave a good tip -- and, apparently, make sure it gets
properly 'disbursed'.

In early October, Sen. Hillary Clinton's 'Middle Class Express' made a
pit stop at the Maid Rite diner in Marshalltown, Iowa.

The New York senator, joined by local political luminaries Christie
Vilsack and Ruth Harkin, enjoyed a famous loose meat sandwich and
attempted to hand caucus cards to the Iowans inside.

Clinton also spoke to one of the diner's waitresses, Anita Esterday.
It was her first day on the job and she and Clinton shared a short
exchange. Esterday, who has three jobs and works 12 hour shifts, said
to Clinton &quot;both of my sons have worked since they were 14 years old&quot;;
Clinton told her, &quot;I'm proud of you.&quot;

But, according to Esterday, that's where Clinton's gratitude ended as
the campaign crew left with nary a gratuity for any of the hard
working Maid-Riters.

&quot;I mean, nobody got left a tip that day,&quot; Esterday said in an
interview with NPR after a visit by Senator Clinton.

Bad Tip -- Hillary Clinton Entourage Paid Waitress For Service

Thursday, November 08, 2007

Hillary Clinton's campaign may not know in which staffer's hands
landed the tab at an Iowa restaurant on Oct. 9, but all sides agree
the Democratic presidential frontrunner is no slouch when it comes to
leaving a tip.

National Public Radio was forced to correct a story it issued Thursday
that had suggested Clinton left waitress Anita Esterday high and dry
after Esterday served the candidate and her entourage when they
stopped in to the Maid-Rite diner near Boone, Iowa.

Turns out, however, that the campaign paid $157 for the meals and left
a $100 tip. Campaign spokesman Phil Singer said he doesn't know what
happened to the money, but Maid-Rite manager Brad Crawford confirmed
to FOX News that the bill and tip were paid. He wouldn't say the
check's amount.

Crawford's wife then added all the workers, including Esterday,
received their tips, and the members of the Clinton camp even helped
out the workers while they were there.

&quot;I think things got misconstrued ... everybody who came in was
polite,&quot; Mrs. Crawford said.

Crawford said he is not surprised by the confusion.

&quot;When these people go into a place, they are not carrying money, but
somebody else took care of it,&quot; he said, adding that all the attention
the restaurant and Esterday have been getting as a result of the false
report has become &quot;a little tiring.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Yes, the manager of the diner confirmed Clinton's staff left a tip with
him--$100 on a $157 bill.

Nice tip!

I am sure Patrick and Drudge and all the Freeper sites will quickly
retract what is a silly story anyway.

Although I agree Paddy couldn't be any more out of touch with reality,
and, worse, is a scumbag for not issuing an apology, you guys really
can't NOT know about maid-rites, can you? Maid-rites are midwestern
staples which you would call sloppy joes, albeit without tomato sauce.
I'd dig out my wife's family maid-rite recipe, but she would have to
kill me if I posted it. People in iowa, Nebraska and Illinois have
serious disagreements about maid-rites, all claiming their families'
are better than the chain.
If Bruce plays Omaha next year, you're all invited for our maid-rites.

Exactly. And did you see that they tipped $100 on a $158 bill? Talk
about elitism and rubbing their money in the faces of the middle

The first time I heard of a &quot;loose meat sandwich&quot; was while watching
an episode of Roseanne several years ago.

A few months ago, I saw a segment on Food Network about that chain.

Either way, &quot;loose meat sandwich&quot; is hands down the worst-named food
in Americana.

&gt; diner: always leave a good tip -- and, apparently, make sure it gets
&gt; properly 'disbursed'.

&gt; In early October, Sen. Hillary Clinton's 'Middle Class Express' made a
&gt; pit stop at the Maid Rite diner in Marshalltown, Iowa.

&gt; The New York senator, joined by local political luminaries Christie
&gt; Vilsack and Ruth Harkin, enjoyed a famous loose meat sandwich and
&gt; attempted to hand caucus cards to the Iowans inside.

&gt; Clinton also spoke to one of the diner's waitresses, Anita Esterday.
&gt; It was her first day on the job and she and Clinton shared a short
&gt; exchange. Esterday, who has three jobs and works 12 hour shifts, said
&gt; to Clinton &quot;both of my sons have worked since they were 14 years old&quot;;
&gt; Clinton told her, &quot;I'm proud of you.&quot;

&gt; But, according to Esterday, that's where Clinton's gratitude ended as
&gt; the campaign crew left with nary a gratuity for any of the hard
&gt; working Maid-Riters.

&gt; &quot;I mean, nobody got left a tip that day,&quot; Esterday said in an
&gt; interview with NPR after a visit by Senator Clinton.

I am neither for not against Hillary, but I would imagine the fact
that she stopped at this diner should bring enough publicity that the
Waitress will end up with a lot of tips from the increase in Customers
coming to the Diner after Hillary was there.  :-)

&gt; Exactly. And did you see that they tipped $100 on a $158 bill?

I don't believe for a second they initially left 100 dollars.   They
might have come back later after the story got out and left 100
dollars.

&gt;The first time I heard of a &quot;loose meat

&gt;A few months ago, I saw a segment on

I use to work for a man who was originally from Pennsylvania and talked
about a dish called &quot;scrapple&quot;.  He explained to me one time how it was
made and it sounded disgusting.  I forgot about it until tonight when I
was reading your comments above.  I looked it up on Google and found the
description below -- it still sounds disgusting.  :-)

Beth-
(lekni ... @webtv.net)

P.S.  Yes....I know some people here in the South eat chitlins and that
sounds disgusting also.  :-)

************

&quot;I've seen it being made; my wife's relatives are farmers in central
Pennsylvania. After butchering you boil the heck out of the rest of the
pig. The meat is then mixed with spices, poured into bread pans and
allowed to set. The resulting loaves are then sliced, and the slices
fried. It's actually not bad; I've eaten it with maple syrup and no
kidding, it tastes like pancakes. Except it's meat, and that's something
I can't quite get over.&quot;

And finally, this disgusting little vignette on how to make
old-fashioned homemade scrapple:

&quot;First, we begin with the head of a pig (fresh is always preferable to
frozen). Exactly which parts of a pig's head are included in Scrapple
depends somewhat on regional preference.
&quot;To begin, the head should be cut in half, or even quartered. (The ears
make for convenient handles while sawing the skull.) While an axe or
cleaver can be used to split the head, a saw is preferable in that it
produces no bone fragments.
&quot;Once the head is sectioned, some people remove the brains. Some remove
the teeth&amp;mdash;bashing them off with a cleaver. Yet others remove the
eyes. The most nutritious scrapple contains the entire head! That said,
however, special care should be taken to remove the ear drums. Left in
place, they contribute a distinctively bitter taste to the Scrapple,
which while popular in Pittsburgh, is generally disliked elsewhere.
&quot;Next, all desirous head and non-head matter, including heart, feet and
tail, are cooked in a pot with just enough water to cover. During
cooking, meat loosens from bone and the skin, ears, rooter and nearly
all head gristle softens. The resulting broth harbors an explosion of
nutritional goodness!
&quot;Bones and loosened meaty matter are strained from the broth, which
should be set aside. When the meat has cooled, pick through it, removing
bones and hard gristle. Grind up the skin and soft gristle, rooter and
so on. Recombine the ground meats with all but about a cup of the
strained broth. For each two cups of broth reunited with meat, add one
cup cereal (cornmeal) to thicken. Bring to a slow boil, stirring all the
time. Add salt, black pepper, red pepper, sage, onion powder, and if
you're feeling adventurous, some bacon bits.
&quot;Continue stirring until it arrives at the consistency of porridge. Pour
into loaf pans and cool. The Scrapple is finished!&quot;

&quot;Whoa- did you see that far-left liberal Hillary left a 63% (!!!) tip at
a diner someplace out in the sticks!  Typical- giving other people's
money away -you don't think she's paying out of her own pocket, do you?*
* That money comes out of the pockets of hard working corporate
excutives that wise DONATE money to both parties to make our country
stronger by shipping jobs overseas and lowering (their own) taxes!

Just another way to re-distribute wealth, going from hard working
corporations to the &quot;poor&quot; minimum wage workers (most of whom are
illegal aliens, anyway, that should have been BLOWN UP by landminds
before they even got to the US) that work in these sorts of jobs.  Did
YOU get a 63% tip the first day on your job!!!  What do you think she's
gonna do when she's in charge of the US budget?????&quot;

Iowa waitress Anita Esterday got the last word on this stupidity
sperad by ignorant sluts:

&quot;You people are really nuts. ... There's kids dying in the war, the
price of oil right now -- there's better things in this world to be
thinking about than who served Hillary Clinton at Maid-Rite and who
got a tip and who didn't get a tip.&quot;

have personally tipped the waitstaff at their campaign appearances?

None--but Rudy usually slips them his number, Romney steals their
makeup, and Brownback used to leave them those little Tracks pamphlets.
Huckabee has the best excuse not to tip, though, since he usually
only orders a glass of water and some dry toast.  And McCain skips the
Diners altogether and hits Denny's because they give free coffee to
folks over 70.  Thompson gets into the diner too late to eat.

If the repubs don't do their own tipping at campaign stops, why is it
newsworthy that a democrat doesn't do her own tipping at campaign
stops?
