My Contribution to American Letters

&quot;Members of the National Book Foundation's board said they felt
it was time to expand their definition of &quot;American letters&quot; to
embrace a wider range of fiction than they have previously
recognized, noting that King's popular success has often
led critics to dismiss the literary value of his work.&quot;
-quoted from Locus October 2003 issue.

From &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; (2001):

&quot;The Beav is basically a happy guy, any of his hang-out buddies would
tell you that, but this is his dark time. He doesn't see any of his old
friends (the ones he thinks of as his real friends) except for the one
week in November when they are together every year, and last November
he and Laurie Sue had still been hanging on. By a thread, granted, but
still hanging on. Now he spends a lot of his time - too much, he knows -
in the bars of Portland's Old Port district, The Porthole and the The
Seaman's Club and The Free Street Pub. He is drinking too much and
smoking too much of the old rope-a-dope and come most mornings he
doesn't like to look at himself in the bathroom mirror; his red-rimmed
eyes skitter away from his reflection and he thinks &quot;I ought to quit
the clubs. Pretty soon I'm gonna have a problem the way Pete's got
one. Jesus-Christ-bananas.&quot;
Quit the clubs, quit the partying, good fuckin idea, and then he's back again,
kiss my bender and how ya doin. This Thursday it's The Free Street, and
damned if there isn't a beer in his hand, a joint in his pocket, and some
old instrumental, sounds a bit like The Ventures, pouring from the juke.
He can't quite remember the name of this one, which was popular before
his time.&quot;

This is not King writing in his own voice, and, as such, completely
fails to make your point.

&quot;You can, if you wish, class all science-fiction
together; but it is about as perceptive as classing the
works of Ballantyne, Conrad and W. W. Jacobs together
as the 'sea-story' and then criticizing _that_.&quot;

Well, I spent 15 cents to photocopy that page and I'm not putting out

I agree with John. That sample is much more readable than King's usual work.
I could tell because my fillings didn't hurt when I read it. Must be the
breezy style. Maybe he had just finished reading some Harlen Ellison.

I like King's use of Byron's symbolism in &quot;Childe Harold to the
Dark Tower Came.&quot; Evidently King's Dark Tower series is a
contemporary quest analog of sorts, featuring The Gunfighter, but
indepentently of characters. Anyone who searches for Lord Byron
&quot;Dark Tower,&quot; as I just did, can estimate its contemporary vogue
and academic interests. The use of the supernatural in
literature has a distinguished Gothic history, and now they speak
of its use in an anti-civilization genre, with H. P. Lovecraft
and T. S. Eliot as exponents.

I would give King an even chance of winning the Nobel Prize for
Literature.

Ok, another 45 cents, but this is it!

From &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;:

&quot;Of the entire family, it was Pete McFarland who slept the most uneasily
in the small hours of that late spring morning; he was in the room adjoining
his parents', groaning and pulling the bedclothes into a tangle as he
turned restlessly from side to side. In his dreams he and his mother
were arguing, walking down the trail and arguing, and at some point he
turned around in disgust (or perhaps so she wouldn't have the satisfaction
of seeing that he had begun to cry a little), and Trisha was gone. At
this point his dream stuttered; it caught in his mind like a bone in a
throat. He twisted back and forth in his bed, trying to dislodge it. The
latening moon peered in at him, making the sweat on his forehead and
temples gleam.&quot;

At this point
like a bone in a throat
back and forth
making...sweat...gleam
[not to mention that the entire scene of a person turning restlessly in
bed during a dream is a cliche. Has anyone ever observed this
happening?]

From &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot;:
&quot;The shocked amazement at waking to a plane which had been
magically emptied of people had worn off; now dislocation had
taken the place of wonder. None of them had ever been in an
airport terminal which was utterly empty. The rental car stalls
were deserted. The ARRIVALS/DEPARTURES monitors were
dark and dead. No one stood at the bank of counters serving
Delta, United, Northwest Air-Link, or Mid-Coast Airways. The
huge tank in the middle of the floor with the BUY MAINE LOBSTERS
banner stretched over it was full of water, but there were no
lobsters in it. The overhead fluorescents were off, and the small
amount of light entering through the doors on the far side of the
large room petered out halfway across the floor, leaving the little
group from Flight 29 huddled together in an unpleasant nest of
shadows.&quot;

shocked amazement

Note that it's not the presence of any particular cliche that's a real
problem, it's the ratio of cliches in each paragraph to felicitous phrases
(none) and/or striking images (none). It would be tough for King to
come up with a striking image anyway because he's constantly using
what I call vague-osities, some indeterminate phrase like &quot;halfway across&quot;,
or &quot;small amount of&quot;.

As for Bookburn's comments concerning the Dark Tower series and Byron
and the Nobel prize...I guess she's pulling my leg. I skimmed through part
four and not only was there not anything of even slight interest, it was also
a hilariously tasteless compilation of butt-sniffing and urination scenes.
I honestly have no idea what anybody sees in this crap.
