Potassium in the vicinity of potatoes.

E Pfeiffer, _Soil fertility, renewal &amp; preservation: bio-dynamic
farming and gardening_:

Brehmer reports that potassium in the vicinity of potatoes ---
separated by an air space from the containers in which the plants
are growing --- was able to increase the growth and the potassium
content of the potatoes.  Stoklasa shows that potassium (in sealed
test-tubes hung over growing plants) alters the rate of growth of
the plants.  We should like to add that we have been able to make
this experiment, the validity of which we are able to confirm by
having obtained corresponding results.  Ried shows that the
presence of potassium and other salts in the vicinity of animals
can have a far-reaching influence on their growth and above all on
their reproduction.  And there are numberless experiments which
demonstrate the influence of irradiated and non-irradiated metals,
in their effects at a distance upon the development of bacteria
cultures.

Has anyone tried this recently?

Hi All,

The reason that people top post is because all the excess dross is not
sniped. This means you have to wade through the whole post to get to the
point. Hope this helps you.

This is simply not true. Some of us always snipe at the excess dross.
Others, like me, snipe at dross even when it is not in excess. Many people
snipe simply to be sniping. I don't know how many snipers actually own the
requisite sniper rifles, so I won't hazard a guess, but there are probably
enough to trim down the number of top posters and dross posters.

What if the whole post only comes up to your ankles? Is this still wading?
Or does the post have to come up to your waist to be considered as wading?
What if the post is so noxious as to dissolve reinforced concrete - does
top posting matter if you refuse to wade in at all?

As for help, I would hope someone would throw me a line and pull me out
if I waded in too deeply and found myself unable to make my way back to the
firm solidity of Terra Usenetta. If that person used the line to drag me
under, however, it might be funny, but would not be very helpful...

This is unadulterated crap! If you can truly PROVE that potassium nitrate in
a hermetically sealed glass tube leaning against a potato plant stem
increases the potassium content of the potatoes, while an empty tube of the
same nature does not, you would be a shoo-in for a Nobel prize in chemistry!
Moreover, explaining how that works would put you alongside Lavoisier as one
of the most famous chemists of all time.

I wuv that show. Especially in Cleveland where it's on the lake AND the
roads. (Note: Cleveland drivers know how to drive on snow/ice just fine,
but do it assuming -you- do too, in cars held together with duct tape and
iPod wires, at 20mph over the speed limit. This causes wackiness qualitatively

I've seen some loony theories before on the Usernet [TM], but this one
just about takes the cake. An asteroid dominating the earth for 65

&gt;&gt;IFYPFY.

&gt; I wuv that show. Especially in Cleveland where it's on the

&gt; too, in cars held together with duct tape and iPod wires,
&gt; at 20mph over the speed limit. This causes wackiness

Feh.  Not any more they don't.  Why, just this morning, in
fairly not-blizzarding conditions, with clear and clean roads,
the bozos-on-ice were going all of 35-40 mph.  With rare
bursts to 45 mph.  And coming home ?  In a blizzard ?  with
low visibility and slush and blowing snow and ice all over ?
and invisible lane lines ?  They were doing 75 !  So maybe
yeah, we can drive on -ice-, just not plain old pavement.

Oh, you mean people who xpost !  I thought someone was trying
sell V1agRa or something, and was all ready with a witty reply
as to why a good portion of the readers would not be
interested, and those that might be certainly wouldn't want
the rest of the world (or at least that part reached by
usenet) to know about it.

Of course, you are also implying that no one on either group
posted to is interested in either gardening or alternate
religions, and that would be just wrong, as I, for one, might
hold an interest in both.  And maybe at the same time.

Patience will be rewarded.  2006 was the hottest year
on record in the US, and the fifth hottest year in
the world on record (following only 1998, 2002, 2003
and 2005).  The past 9 years have all been among the
25 warmest years on record for the continental US.
Every single year since 1993 has been in the top 20
warmest years on record, globally.  Researchers predict
that temperatures worldwide will increase between 2
and 8 degrees by the end of the century.

So, my advice is to stay put and wait it out.

HAW HAW, you get two lake effects, you looZ3rs! The loony ice
fishermen were herded off Erie yesterday; perhaps we could send 'em

and 30 miles north of me, so I'm just getting a good old-fashioned
snowfall.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Up until last week, but the meteorologists say Lake Erie
&gt;&gt;&gt; is *finally* iced over, so no more lake effect storms
&gt;&gt;&gt; here! Lake Ontario is the culprit over Oswego County.

&gt;&gt;You be wrong, per Channel 8 (Cleveland)(or was that the
&gt;&gt;Clveland Plain Dealer ?)(it were someone local, at least,
&gt;&gt;and news-ish).  Huron is sending us wet gooey masses of
&gt;&gt;snow.  And Lake Effect is just a term for &quot;We aren't sure
&gt;&gt;how much will fall before it stops or where it will fall so
&gt;&gt;we will make up this here cute name for GO SOUTH OR FREEZE
&gt;&gt;YOU IDIOTS&quot;

&gt; HAW HAW, you get two lake effects, you looZ3rs! The loony
&gt; ice fishermen were herded off Erie yesterday; perhaps we
&gt; could send 'em out on Huron?! And lake effect snowstorms
&gt; usually strike below Buffalo and 30 miles north of me, so
&gt; I'm just getting a good old-fashioned snowfall.

&gt; Would you like me to send the St. Bernards west?
">

Too late.  The roads are cleared, my drive is shoveled, the
dog has pooped several times in the nice maze I dug her and
the good booze got all bought up by the dudes what have
snowplows on their huge honking trucks (plows that,
apparantly, don't plow snow unless it is in the way of booze
runs).  So no thanks, unless the Bernards have some good booze
in their barrels and the sense not to drink it all up before
they get here.

Not in Oswego County it isn't.  There "lake effect" means "go look at
the radar and you'll see it, Mother Nature giving us the finger plain as
day".

&gt; Patience will be rewarded.  2006 was the hottest year
&gt; on record in the US, and the fifth hottest year in
&gt; the world on record (following only 1998, 2002, 2003
&gt; and 2005).  The past 9 years have all been among the
&gt; 25 warmest years on record for the continental US.
&gt; Every single year since 1993 has been in the top 20
&gt; warmest years on record, globally.  Researchers predict
&gt; that temperatures worldwide will increase between 2
&gt; and 8 degrees by the end of the century.

&gt; So, my advice is to stay put and wait it out.

Well, duh, why do you think we got all this lake effect snow?  Hot
weather -&gt; lake warms up -&gt; lake stays warmer than usual -&gt; cold air
blows across it -&gt; WACKINESS ENSUES.

It's the price we pay for being able to be out in shorts and a t shirt
in early January.

A nice cognac would do.  Hell, fill 'er up with Hypnotique,
may as well have blue booze for blue(sy) weather, eh?

Stopped and got some of the flavored fake "wine" that is
really just an expensive wine wooler dressed up in a big
bottle.  Not bad for cheap stuff, tastes like fizzy fruit
juice, hits the brane like wine after the 2nd glass.  I'm
getting my hair cut n colored tomorrow, so I don't want to be
hung-over in the midst of all those chemicals.  Might not hold
still well enough, get a crooked cut or lop-sided dark-lights.
