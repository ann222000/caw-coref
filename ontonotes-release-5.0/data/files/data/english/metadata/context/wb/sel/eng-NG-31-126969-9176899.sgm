A reminder:  These threads are lame.  Their hair goes straight up, and
they're bloody stupid.

BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
Season Five, Episode 16: &quot;The Body&quot;
Writers: Joss Whedon
Director: Joss Whedon

&quot;The Body&quot; is obviously the defining episode of this period of the
show.  And it's a pretty good episode for me.  I don't think it's
among the show's best.  A lot of that is centered around the early
parts, which simply don't do their professed job of evoking the
physical side of the reaction to death - I find that all the
directorial flourishes distance me rather than being immersive.  There
are some intense moments (Buffy meeting Dawn at school is incredibly
raw, and for some reason I didn't appreciate it last time), and I keep
focusing on the roles of Anya and Tara, whose reactions to death are
quite interesting in addition to being so well performed.  I think I
feel maybe 70% of what Joss was trying for.  Obviously, it had 100% of
its intended effect on many people, so, uh, more power to everyone in
that category.
Rating: Good

Season Five, Episode 17: &quot;Forever&quot;
Writer: Marti Noxon
Director: Marti Noxon

&quot;Forever&quot; is one of those episodes I really want to like.  It's right
to take another episode specifically as a wind-down from the previous
one before going back to our silly* fantasy hellgod plot.  I've talked
before about how well it captures the oppressiveness of the mundane as
the people who've been by Buffy's side through dangerous times now try
to be her support and to take charge of grappling with things like how
to word a funeral program.  &quot;Forever&quot; does a good job shifting from
there from Buffy's headspace to Dawn's, and I very much approve of the
decision of what to show and not to show about the resurrection
ritual.  The very end is fascinating for both sisters' reactions.  On
top of that, Doc makes an immediate impression in his debut, and I
*love* Angel's visit, which plays on both what he and Buffy can and
can't do for each other in their neediest times.  It's a special one-
time guest spot that doesn't need to be anything more.  But &quot;Forever&quot;
is also not without its heaping share of flaws, and there's a worn-out
quality to staging, dialogue, and performance, like there just wasn't
enough energy left to make it more than a &quot;minor&quot; episode.  The first
signs of organ failure show up in the unnatural Willow/Tara dialogue
and the lazy composition of the egg-stealing sequence.  And then right
before that nice ending, during the Buffy/Dawn confrontation prior to
the knock at the door... Well, the episode absolutely dies, leaving the
actors buried under leaden dialogue that talks about high emotions
that they're not able to bring.  There's enough good in this show to
wish that it could've been a stronger contender.
Rating: Decent

Season Five, Episode 18: &quot;Intervention&quot;
Writer: Jane Espenson
Director: Michael Gershman

Another popular one for some, this is like an experiment to see how
well BTVS would work without some of its internal sense of logic.  The
dialogue in some part crackles, particularly in the episode's best
plot thread, as Buffy summons up some quips while she goes on a Hokey
Pokey inspired quest and receives a nicely ambiguous and intriguing
message.  The rest of the episode seems designed to be a sort of a
follow-up to &quot;Crush&quot; in which both Buffy and Spike are made to
understand, in a way they hadn't before, the level of nobility he's
capable of when driven by this obsession.  Meanwhile, in order to get
to that point, the robot humor starts to wear thin after awhile, the
Scoobies seem remarkably slow to catch on to their best friend being
replaced by a machine, and the Ben half of Glory lets the Glory half
in on a few secrets by being a moron.  As for that last scene, since
the original review I've made my peace with everything about it except
for that damn kiss.  Without the kiss, it'd be a strong piece of
drama, but with it, I don't buy it in the slightest.
Rating: Decent

Season Five, Episode 19: &quot;Tough Love&quot;
Writer: Rebecca Rand Kirshner
Director: David Grossman

And here's an experiment to see if BTVS can stand without its ear for
dialogue.  Surprisingly well, actually, at least over the short term.
At this point there's enough good will so that I have a built-in
interest in these people and their lives even when the individual
conversations aren't so special.  Some are trying to convey worthwhile
themes (Buffy/Giles), and some cover worthwhile topics in an awkwardly
contrived-looking way (the Willow/Tara argument), but I'm seeing the
worthwhile-ness.  Of course, those who appreciate TL will surely agree
that it's at its best when the dialogue drops out, with sequences like
the mopey pan through the cheerful looking fair, or the brutality of
the whole well-timed sequence in which Tara unexpectedly finds Glory
next to her, and gets her hand crushed before losing her mind while
Willow looks on.

One thing that elicited some disagreement last time is the part in
which Wil tries to take on the hell-god solo.  The amount of magic
involved gets mixed opinions; some love seeing Willow tap into
something this cosmic while others miss her being normal, and mystical
stuff as a whole being more special rather than commonplace.  I'm in
the former category largely because of Willow - I'm impressed by the
process of seeing this cute mousy (don't usually lose that adjective)
girl turn into this witch bursting with this righteous rage, avenging
her fallen lover.  One of the joys of serialized TV is when a
character undergoes a transformation like this over the course of
years.  In that moment I believe, just for a split second, that she
might actually be able to win, and I'm a little worried about where
this uncontrollable energy might lead.  It's a very strong bit, for
people in my camp, although I understand the dissenting opinion.  The
part I don't understand is why some people find the floating and
visual effects to be cheesy - by any objective standard, it looks
fucking great.  Anyway, the end of the season drags substantially for
me, but &quot;Tough Love,&quot; by itself, is a reasonably taut little big-
episode.
Rating: Good (up from Decent)

Additional comments on S5D5:  I think most people who'd be reading
this already know this, but apparently in the original outline for the
season, which got changed very early in the year, &quot;Tough Love&quot; was
basically supposed to be the part of Willow's arc that eventually made
it into &quot;Seeing Red&quot; and &quot;Villains.&quot;  Like Joss, I prefer the timing
that they ended up with, really taking the time to let her and Tara be
together.

James Marsters does not appear in TB.  The last time a BTVS was absent
in an episode for which he was credited was David Boreanaz, also
playing a vampire, in &quot;Inca Mummy Girl,&quot; another episode involving a
corpse... Yeah, in case you haven't noticed, I have nothing else of note
to say.

*Don't take the use of that adjective too seriously, okay?  I'm
applying &quot;silly&quot; to the &quot;plot&quot; rather than the &quot;story,&quot; if that makes
sense.

Thoughts?

Two other neat little scenes.

I like the whole scene, including the kiss.  I don't think the scene

One note on &quot;Tough Love&quot; for now.

Willow's remark about her and Tara &quot;never&quot; quarreling.  Probably
correct until then, and partly due to them being mostly compatible.
But also because Tara hadn't had enough self-assurance to get into a
serious argument.

As sweet and moving as their relationship is in S4-5, I honestly think
they had the potential to get it more right after they got back
together in &quot;Entropy.&quot;  You know the thrill that some of us get from
watching the Willow of WTTH turn into such a major force in the
Buffyverse?  I get a smaller-scale thrill from those increasingly
frequent moments in which we see Tara try to define herself and
ultimately become a more mature person.

On the other hand, the Scoobies didn't really have all THAT much
interaction with Buffy-bot before the real Buffy appeared.  And most
of that time they were distracted by some crisis or other.

Not that I disagree with Buffy's irritation about them not realizing
Buffy-bot was a robot.

Of course, Buffy isn't being entirely perceptive herself:  &quot;At least
it's not a very good copy.&quot;

Which reminds me of a neat little exchange just after that...

(begin scene)

DAWN: We're safe, right. And, uh, Spike built a robot Buffy to play
checkers with.

Buffy frowns, looks at Tara.

TARA: I-it sounded convincing when I thought it.

(end scene)

Well, I won't dwell on that this time.  Amply covered last time.  Suffice to
say that the first act is the best part of the episode for me.  Probably the
most perfect segment of BtVS ever.  I feel like I'm totally in Buffy's head
as it plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There
&gt; are some intense moments (Buffy meeting Dawn at school is incredibly
&gt; raw, and for some reason I didn't appreciate it last time), and I keep
&gt; focusing on the roles of Anya and Tara, whose reactions to death are
&gt; quite interesting in addition to being so well performed.
">

Buffy makes a little connection with them too in the hospital.  Well, she
does with everyone actually - even as she stays in her weird head space.
But Xander, Willow &amp; Giles are pretty much to be expected.  Long time
closeness with them.  Tara is a little new in this special sense.  When she
speaks of her own experience with loss, I think it was the moment that most
helped Buffy.

Anya is another matter.  Her oft referenced monologue back in Willow's room
is good stuff, but I think I prefer her brief remarks at the hospital.

Anya: (a little too loudly) I wish that Joyce didn't die...
Anya: (more quietly) ...because she was nice. And now we all hurt.

It's pure Anya in delivery and content.  Yet, for all its awkwardness, it
communicates perfectly and poignantly.  Anya does seem to have a knack for
sensing the mood of the room.  And it speaks well for her development as
human.  Xander has taught her well.

The Body as an episode tends not to speak too directly to the season and
series.  (Beyond the fact and implications of Joyce's death that one could
probably figure out by simply saying she died.)  But it does brush against
it here and there.  One is the waiting room scene in general - a scene
that's just filled with love.  As sad as it is, everybody's heart is
together in support of Buffy on a level we rarely see.  Two episodes from
now, Buffy's spirit guide is going to tell her that she's filled with love.
I tend to think of love as sort of the stealth theme of the season -
directly introduced late in a season so geared towards death.  But love is
kind of the foundation of family and comes to be shown at the end as giving
death meaning.  The latter experienced a different way in this episode.

Anyway, back to Tara and Anya.  This is a really good example of Tara as a
kind of gentle personal counselor I guess.  (Not sure how else to describe
it.)  Which shows up once in a while as one of her better traits - something
I always associate with the character.  A kind of unassuming wisdom.  It's
sad, though I suppose inevitable, that it eventually comes to chafe a little
on Willow.  Familiarity breeds contempt is probably too harsh a description
of the process, but it's a cousin to it I think.

Buffy seems to genuinely appreciate Anya's sentiments - which I think I'll
leave at that.  Some day I want to think more about how/if/when Buffy and
Anya connect in this series.  I've never been happy with the way that was
handled the second half of S7.

The downside of The Body is that it doesn't deal with the aftermath.  So
you've get two shows dealing directly with Joyce's death instead of one.
All that bleakness nearly buries this episode.  The oppressiveness of the
mundane you refer to goes on for quite a while.  And sometimes it's pretty
good (though I'm not wild about the coffin buying scene), but it's always
bleak.  I feel exhausted by the episode before it really gets going.

When talk turns to resurrection (and sex as affirmation of life) it starts
picking up.  The episode does a nice job, I think, of sliding Glory into the
mix, thereby achieving the major function of linking back up with the
seasonal story.  (I like how Jinx is running out of superlatives to utter
about Glory.)  It also advances the Willow/Tara story, reconnects Spike and
Dawn, introduces a small but important character, and ends up hitting
squarely on the theme of Buffy carrying the weight of the world now that
Joyce is dead.

It's not really a big episode, but it puts some valuable things out there.
With that in mind, the episode on the whole improves as it moves along for
me rather than the reverse you find.  Even if some individual moments aren't
the best.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm not sure what to make of Dawn tearing up the photo.  The aspect of
Buffy's part that gets me is that, even as she's breaking down over the
impossibility of it, she is utterly uncompromising as to the task she
assigns to herself.  She's decided she has to be mom.  Not big sister
working with little sister, all with more responsibilities.  Nope.  She has

Angel says Buffy will get help from her friends.  But it starts getting hard
to see that.  Buffy effectively pleads with Angel for help.  Stay forever.
Angel doesn't exactly say no - they both just know it can't be.  Even as
they dream for a sec that it might be possible.  But however it was done,
the answer still was no.  A few episodes from now, Giles will say no to a
similar, more serious request.  And when Buffy ask who's going to be mom at
the end of this episode, the implication is that it can only be Buffy.

I think this Angel visit has to be the most out of context cross-over of the
two series.  Others don't really connect the series, but they aren't in
opposition to it either.  This time, however, it's nigh on impossible to
imagine the Angel of AtS at this point in time acting like this at all.

I like the one with Dawn.  The one where they discover the book missing is
clunky.

The sentiments, however, work very well for me, and are, I believe,
foundational for much of what will happen between Willow and Tara for a long
time.

On the very short term, we see an excellent example of Tara being more
knowledgeable than Willow.  This plays well into what we find has been a
growing sense of discomfort with that by Willow.  I think that's mostly
surface though.  I believe something deeper is shown with the evident
different attitude towards resurrection spells that the two have.  Willow
seems to genuinely have no idea what might be wrong with them other than
technical failure, while Tara has a whole ethical belief system built around
it.  We're seeing a pretty substantial gulf between them in moral outlook.
That may not be the direct subject of their upcoming fight (though S6
implications seem clear), but that kind of fundamental difference not fully
recognized would likely be a background irritant trying to work its way out.
I think Tara's remark about being frightened by Willow's power (in Tough
Love) touches upon that gulf.

The resurrection spell also lays the groundwork for Buffy's S6 resurrection.
It shows Willow's willingness to go there.  (It's interesting that Tara
agrees to go along with Willow then.)  It introduces the ethical conundrum
generally speaking, and displays some of Spike's attitude towards the
subject.  And it introduces the concept of coming back wrong.

All in all making this aspect of the episode rather momentous and
fascinating.

I just mean that it's on the heels of beige Angel and all his S2 weirdness.
Coming after Epiphany is better than after Reprsise, but it still seems odd
seeing Angel as such a pillar of sanity and normalcy considering what he's
just been through himself.  I don't mean it as a criticism - the two shows
have their own stories and needs.  Just an observation about the two series
not being terribly synched up.

I don't see it as too much of a problem.  It is &quot;out of context&quot; in
the sense that all of Angel's appearances are post-TYF; quite simply,
the BTVS cameos make it a point such that familiarity with what's
going on on the spinoff is not required.  (Also, note that a grand
total of zero characters who originated on ATS appear on BTVS.)  But
Angel being all &quot;let me try to handle everything?&quot;  Plays right for
me.  In ATS S2 post-&quot;Epiphany,&quot; he's loudly trying to prove himself,
particularly to the people he cares about, and to (to the point of
comedic annoyance) be accessible to provide any kind of help that
might be needed.  I think we all agreed last time that  Joyce's death
comes at least after &quot;Disharmony,&quot; so Angel's probably a good distance
away from the beige period.

It's one of the best examples of the show using humor to take the
potentially-cheesy edge off a moment without in any way deflating it.
Buffy's offhand comment later about how apparently death is her gift
sums it up - it's rife for snark, but she's also not going to stop
thinking about it any time soon.

It seems like in your viewpoint sometimes Buffy's acting on instinct -
overwhelmed with relief and such - and sometimes making a pointed
decision to give Spike what he wants (since she doesn't instinctively
kiss people).  Just saying.

Well they're not great pals, but they didn't seem to be at each other either

Forced to police herself.  I like the thought.  She wasn't only acting out

Oh, just poorly placed and explained.  I was using the opportunity of the
Angel moment to observe how the kind of help that might have made a
difference to Buffy isn't making it to her - either by unavailability or
non-acceptance.  For some reason that struck me more this watching with
Angel himself as I realized (in that specific sense) that Buffy asked Angel
to stay and he said she was sure to get the help she needs from her friends.
Neither really happens.  And Buffy's framing of her job makes it all the
less likely.

We all agreed?...  I guess I forgot that conversation.  Anyway, I didn't
mean that it was a problem.  Just that there didn't seem to be any attempt
to place Angel in any AtS context.  I think all of his other appearances
have that context.  And Drusilla's appearance refers to what she's been
doing with Darla.  (Even though she never goes back.)  Faith gets some
context too, albeit rather vague.  Are there any other AtS visits to BtVS?

I think the BtVS visits to AtS are pretty good at maintaining some minimal
connect with real time too.  Though, come to think of it, the brief phone
call to Willow in Disharmony is pretty generic.  Still, it's easier for me
to imagine Willow that way at that moment than it is do the same for Angel.
Curious that the most distant crossovers for both series happen on the same
night.

I say instinctive rather than calculated because it seems to have come to
her as a complete thought rather than constructed through logic - even
though there is a logic behind it.  In my imagination a dozen possible
reactions flashed through her head, and that's the one that felt right.
Rationalizing it would take a bit longer.  (Maybe even change her mind.)
But it's not quite impulse, which implies a degree of casualness and trivial
motive.  There's a gravitas to it that properly speaks to her gratitude, his
sacrifice and recognition of what matters to each of them.

Or another way of looking at it is as a different example of Buffy's knack
for seeing a situation and knowing what to do.  Wisdom is something else
that can work like that.  At least if you view &quot;wisdom&quot; as different than
intelligence, and not necessarily logic based.  Though again, it can be
logically explained in retrospect.

I don't believe that it much matters that Buffy doesn't make a habit of
offering such kisses.  I think the scene pretty clearly presents it as
something singular.  That it's not normal is part of its power.  And the
choice of kiss is defined by what would be valuable to Spike, not by Buffy's
own standards.  (Vague Disclaimer would describe it as throwing Spike a
bone.)

But maybe she thought it out more than I give Buffy credit for.  We are,
after all, stuck analyzing the limited information offered in a TV scene.
It could be whatever anybody's imagination wants it to be.  In mixing the
perspectives I think I'm also saying that I believe it works both
emotionally and logically.

I tend to think that Spike is basically telling the truth near the
beginning of the episode when he tells Willow and Xander that he's
bringing flowers because he liked Joyce.

Not that that's necessarily his entire motivation, but it's
probably the most important conscious one at that moment.

Good point.  Combined with it seeping in to the point where she
legitimately became somewhat ashamed of herself.  She probably
(unconsciously, I mean) thinks that she's reached a level of heroism
and badassery where she doesn't have to put up with that the way she
did as Just Willow.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think this Angel visit has to be the most out of context cross-over of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; two series.  Others don't really connect the series, but they aren't in
&gt; &gt;&gt; opposition to it either.  This time, however, it's nigh on impossible to
&gt; &gt;&gt; imagine the Angel of AtS at this point in time acting like this at all.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Let me worry about the neediness. I can handle it.&quot;  Yeah, right.  Not
&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; there has to be a connection.  Just making an observation.

&gt; &gt; I don't see it as too much of a problem.  It is &quot;out of context&quot; in
&gt; &gt; the sense that all of Angel's appearances are post-TYF; quite simply,
&gt; &gt; the BTVS cameos make it a point such that familiarity with what's
&gt; &gt; going on on the spinoff is not required.  (Also, note that a grand
&gt; &gt; total of zero characters who originated on ATS appear on BTVS.)  But
&gt; &gt; Angel being all &quot;let me try to handle everything?&quot;  Plays right for
&gt; &gt; me.  In ATS S2 post-&quot;Epiphany,&quot; he's loudly trying to prove himself,
&gt; &gt; particularly to the people he cares about, and to (to the point of
&gt; &gt; comedic annoyance) be accessible to provide any kind of help that
&gt; &gt; might be needed.  I think we all agreed last time that  Joyce's death
&gt; &gt; comes at least after &quot;Disharmony,&quot; so Angel's probably a good distance
&gt; &gt; away from the beige period.

&gt; We all agreed?...  I guess I forgot that conversation.  Anyway, I didn't
&gt; mean that it was a problem.  Just that there didn't seem to be any attempt
&gt; to place Angel in any AtS context.  I think all of his other appearances
&gt; have that context.  And Drusilla's appearance refers to what she's been
&gt; doing with Darla.  (Even though she never goes back.)  Faith gets some
&gt; context too, albeit rather vague.  Are there any other AtS visits to BtVS?
">

I think that with the exception of Season Four, almost all ATS-to-BTVS
crossovers are stripped of context as much as possible.  It is not
required to have any familiarity with ATS at all to watch BTVS
through, and I think that's very much deliberate, since not everyone
watches both shows.  Drusilla's line will make ATS fans smile a bit,
but it's otherwise very quickly brushed past.  Where and why Angel got
his magic amulet isn't important to the story being told on BTVS, so
it's not told.  Even Faith in &quot;Dirty Girls&quot; provides as little
information about what she's been through as they can get away with -
I know as someone who finished BTVS before getting that far in ATS, I
appreciated &quot;Orpheus&quot; being summed up in a line that strongly
intrigues without enough context to be a true spoiler.  On the other
hand, ATS plots continue to spring out of BTVS origins through the end
of the series - it's more of a spinoff that way, despite its distinct
style compared to the parent show.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think the BtVS visits to AtS are pretty good at maintaining some minimal
&gt; connect with real time too.  Though, come to think of it, the brief phone
&gt; call to Willow in Disharmony is pretty generic.  Still, it's easier for me
&gt; to imagine Willow that way at that moment than it is do the same for Angel.
&gt; Curious that the most distant crossovers for both series happen on the same
&gt; night.
">

As I've said, the tone of the conversation is casual enough that I
feel, and did get the impression that fandom is pretty generally in
agreement, that it's pre-&quot;The Body.&quot;  It's the first time they don't
sync up.  Then again, Willow is kinda the designated BTVS
representative in L.A., and her appearances don't always reflect where
she and the others are in their stories.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As for that last scene, since
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the original review I've made my peace with everything about it except
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for that damn kiss.  Without the kiss, it'd be a strong piece of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drama, but with it, I don't buy it in the slightest.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I dissected that pretty thoroughly last time.  I still think that
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; level of relief that must of washed over Buffy when she realized Spike
&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't tell Glory about Dawn, combined with seeing what an utter mess
&gt; &gt;&gt; Spike
&gt; &gt;&gt; was - how much he had endured to keep the secret - was enough to convince
&gt; &gt;&gt; Buffy that Spike deserved something meaningful in return.  And that's
&gt; &gt;&gt; what
&gt; &gt;&gt; Buffy knew would be a meaningful gesture.  (This was all probably more
&gt; &gt;&gt; instinctive than thought out.)

&gt; &gt; It seems like in your viewpoint sometimes Buffy's acting on instinct -
&gt; &gt; overwhelmed with relief and such - and sometimes making a pointed
&gt; &gt; decision to give Spike what he wants (since she doesn't instinctively
&gt; &gt; kiss people).  Just saying.

&gt; I say instinctive rather than calculated because it seems to have come to
&gt; her as a complete thought rather than constructed through logic - even
&gt; though there is a logic behind it.  In my imagination a dozen possible
&gt; reactions flashed through her head, and that's the one that felt right.
&gt; Rationalizing it would take a bit longer.  (Maybe even change her mind.)
&gt; But it's not quite impulse, which implies a degree of casualness and trivial
&gt; motive.  There's a gravitas to it that properly speaks to her gratitude, his
&gt; sacrifice and recognition of what matters to each of them.
[snip]
&gt; I don't believe that it much matters that Buffy doesn't make a habit of
&gt; offering such kisses.  I think the scene pretty clearly presents it as
&gt; something singular.  That it's not normal is part of its power.  And the
&gt; choice of kiss is defined by what would be valuable to Spike, not by Buffy's
&gt; own standards.  (Vague Disclaimer would describe it as throwing Spike a
&gt; bone.)
">

See, for me it does matter, because a big part of the premise requires
that she be acting on instinct/impulse whatever, because by any
rational standard kissing a guy with no sense of boundaries whom she's
compared to a serial killer doesn't hold up.  So it has to be
instinctive, but then it has to go up against her other instincts,
which generally involve not being that physically friendly with
anyone.

The sentiment of the dialogue in this scene is powerful, but it also
doesn't &quot;feel&quot; to me like it calls for a sexually-charged gesture,
since it's Spike's sexual desire for Buffy that drives him to
perversions like using her as a sex toy template.  And it's his love
(or obsession, or whatever you want to call it) in ways apart from the
lust that leads him to prove himself to her the way he does in this
episode, and will drive her to think of him more like a man rather
than a monster.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Season Five, Episode 17: &quot;Forever&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this Angel visit has to be the most out of context
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cross-over of the two series.  Others don't really connect the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; series, but they aren't in opposition to it either.  This
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time, however, it's nigh on impossible to imagine the Angel of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AtS at this point in time acting like this at all. &quot;Let me

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that there has to be a connection.  Just making an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; observation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have any problem with the way Angel is acting here.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He's being what he thinks Buffy needs.

&gt;&gt; I just mean that it's on the heels of beige Angel and all his S2
&gt;&gt; weirdness. Coming after Epiphany is better than after Reprsise,
&gt;&gt; but it still seems odd seeing Angel as such a pillar of sanity
&gt;&gt; and normalcy considering what he's just been through himself.  I
&gt;&gt; don't mean it as a criticism - the two shows have their own
&gt;&gt; stories and needs.  Just an observation about the two series not
&gt;&gt; being terribly synched up.

&gt; On another subject.

&gt; I tend to think that Spike is basically telling the truth near the
&gt; beginning of the episode when he tells Willow and Xander that he's
&gt; bringing flowers because he liked Joyce.

&gt; Not that that's necessarily his entire motivation, but it's
&gt; probably the most important conscious one at that moment.
">

Personally I think his motives are so mixed together as to be impossible to
un-entwine.  He did like Joyce, but he's also moved by his feelings for
Buffy.  However, that still doesn't mean that Xander is right.  At this
moment I think he is moved by the knowledge that Buffy feels badly - which
we've already seen from him back in Fool For Love.  He'll repeat a similar
sentiment to Dawn later in the episode.  And again in Intervention.  That's
a lot of emphasis on caring about Buffy feeling bad.  Not just a get in her
pants thing.

Be that as it may, liking Joyce is still a big enough part of it that Spike
probably did feel genuinely insulted by Xander's words and did believe he
was being truthful with what he said in response.

Ah, well, there's no denying the sexuality of it to the observer caught up
in their story.  (Especially with all the shipper noise forever surrounding
them.)  But within the story - within that scene - I don't think it's very
sexual.  Spike's too beat up.  The context doesn't fit it.  As much as it
can be it's all gratitude, no lust.  And just in case the viewer missed
that, the way the series handles the follow-up is essentially lust free.  No
more trying to grope Buffy like in Triangle.  Instead Spike takes the
respect - and finds it kind of rewarding.  The sequence with Spike at the
end of S5 isn't just about setting up Spuffy.  I believe it's more about
establishing the template for Spike the hero.  And what Spike does here is
set aside (for the moment anyway) the notion of Buffy as lover in favor of
Buffy as role model.

&gt; BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
&gt; Season Five, Episode 16: &quot;The Body&quot;
&gt; Writers: Joss Whedon
&gt; Director: Joss Whedon

&gt; &quot;The Body&quot; is obviously the defining episode of this period of the

Yes. But that's the only thing wrong with it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And it's a pretty good episode for me.  I don't think it's
&gt; among the show's best.  A lot of that is centered around the early
&gt; parts, which simply don't do their professed job of evoking the
&gt; physical side of the reaction to death - I find that all the
&gt; directorial flourishes distance me rather than being immersive.  There
&gt; are some intense moments (Buffy meeting Dawn at school is incredibly
&gt; raw, and for some reason I didn't appreciate it last time), and I keep
&gt; focusing on the roles of Anya and Tara, whose reactions to death are
&gt; quite interesting in addition to being so well performed.  I think I
&gt; feel maybe 70% of what Joss was trying for.  Obviously, it had 100% of
&gt; its intended effect on many people, so, uh, more power to everyone in
&gt; that category.
&gt; Rating: Good

Either Excellent or Superlative for me. Even though it unequivocally
confirms the change from the clever early show where Buffy undergoes the
usual growing pangs in symbolic form to the more mundane later one where the
character's simply suffer the slings and arrows that superheroes are heir to
relatively directly. Of course, as slings and arrows go, the loss of a
parent is a big one, and compared to most of the later ones, pretty
universal (as they said in the 1932 Lubitsch movie, Trouble in Paradise,
&quot;That's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them, then they
die&quot;). Whedon was able to put more into this than into any later crisis.

It is my 5th favourite BtVS episode, best in season 5

&gt; &quot;Forever&quot; is one of those episodes I really want to like.  It's right

Where it is purely following on from The Body (up till the funeral) it is
actually pretty good. But the zombie Joyce story is just awful. So this time
I only watched up until the funeral, and consequently didn't consider
changing my rating. It is my 131st favourite BtVS episode, 18th best in

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Season Five, Episode 18: &quot;Intervention&quot;
&gt; Writer: Jane Espenson
&gt; Director: Michael Gershman

&gt; Another popular one for some, this is like an experiment to see how
&gt; well BTVS would work without some of its internal sense of logic.  The
&gt; dialogue in some part crackles, particularly in the episode's best
&gt; plot thread, as Buffy summons up some quips while she goes on a Hokey
&gt; Pokey inspired quest and receives a nicely ambiguous and intriguing
&gt; message.  The rest of the episode seems designed to be a sort of a
&gt; follow-up to &quot;Crush&quot; in which both Buffy and Spike are made to
&gt; understand, in a way they hadn't before, the level of nobility he's
&gt; capable of when driven by this obsession.  Meanwhile, in order to get
&gt; to that point, the robot humor starts to wear thin after awhile, the
&gt; Scoobies seem remarkably slow to catch on to their best friend being
&gt; replaced by a machine, and the Ben half of Glory lets the Glory half
&gt; in on a few secrets by being a moron.  As for that last scene, since
&gt; the original review I've made my peace with everything about it except
&gt; for that damn kiss.  Without the kiss, it'd be a strong piece of

A high Good for me, and I don't have any problem with the kiss. I don't
think it was given or received as a sexual gesture. And the episode has
easily the greatest number of great lines in season 5 - lines like &quot;I know
this ritual! The ancient shamans were next called upon to do the hokey-pokey
and turn themselves around&quot; and &quot;so really it [the Salem witch trial] was
only bad for the falsely accused, and, well, they never have a good time&quot;

It's my 29th favourite BtVS episode, 2nd best in season 5 (last year was
27th and 2nd).

I couldn't bring myself to watch this again only 15 months after I last
watched it, so the slight change in my ranking of it (to 139th best in BtVS,
21st in season 5, from 138th and 21st last year) only reflect movements of
other episodes around it.

&gt; Good point.  Combined with it seeping in to the point where she
&gt; legitimately became somewhat ashamed of herself.  She probably
&gt; (unconsciously, I mean) thinks that she's reached a level of heroism
&gt; and badassery where she doesn't have to put up with that the way she
&gt; did as Just Willow.

&gt; -AOQ

Maybe not even all that unconsciously.  At some level, I'm sure it's
dawned on her that - by this point in time - she really *doesn't* have
to take a whole lot of crap from much of anybody short of a hell-god.
Even if she isn't *deliberately* pushing back harder than necessary,
just knowing that she *can* would go a long way toward getting rid of
her tendency to hunker down and repress.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Two other neat little scenes.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Willow magically pointing out a book to Dawn.  That turns out
&gt; &gt;&gt; to reveal a lot more than she intended.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And the Willow-babble when she realizes this.  Which also
&gt; &gt;&gt; likely means that Tara figures out that Willow had some role in
&gt; &gt;&gt; Dawn finding the &quot;just a history book&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Remember the length of the discussion about how much Willow
&gt; &gt; intended Dawn to learn?

&gt; Yes.

&gt; (Intervention)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Meanwhile, in order to get to that point, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; robot humor starts to wear thin after awhile, the Scoobies
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seem remarkably slow to catch on to their best friend being
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; replaced by a machine

&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course they didn't notice last season when she was replaced
&gt; &gt;&gt; by Faith...

&gt; &gt; Faith was acting weird, but she wasn't blatantly robotic while
&gt; &gt; displaying mannerisms with a fair number of similarities to a
&gt; &gt; robot they'd encountered recently.

&gt; On the other hand, the Scoobies didn't really have all THAT much
&gt; interaction with Buffy-bot before the real Buffy appeared.  And most
&gt; of that time they were distracted by some crisis or other.

&gt; Not that I disagree with Buffy's irritation about them not realizing
&gt; Buffy-bot was a robot.

&gt; Of course, Buffy isn't being entirely perceptive herself:  &quot;At least
&gt; it's not a very good copy.&quot;

&gt; Which reminds me of a neat little exchange just after that...

&gt; (begin scene)

&gt; DAWN: We're safe, right. And, uh, Spike built a robot Buffy to play
&gt; checkers with.

&gt; Buffy frowns, looks at Tara.

&gt; TARA: I-it sounded convincing when I thought it.

&gt; (end scene)

So LOL. Sometimes I got the feeling that Dawn was just teasing Buffy.

Funny, I had the same feeling this morning when I looked at the mirror, :)

Buffy was just irritated that she had a body-double. The physical look of
the bot was perfectly identical to Buffy as it was played by the same
actress! The only tell-tale signs were the occasional silly off-beat
pre-programmed machine verbal responses.

&gt; &gt; show.  And it's a pretty good episode for me.  I don't think it's
&gt; &gt; among the show's best.

&gt; Currently #3 all time for me.  Fell behind Hush this go around, though
&gt; they're really virtually equal in quality.  They just do something
&gt; different.

&gt; &gt; A lot of that is centered around the early
&gt; &gt; parts, which simply don't do their professed job of evoking the
&gt; &gt; physical side of the reaction to death - I find that all the
&gt; &gt; directorial flourishes distance me rather than being immersive.

&gt; Well, I won't dwell on that this time.  Amply covered last time.  Suffice
to
&gt; say that the first act is the best part of the episode for me.  Probably
the
&gt; most perfect segment of BtVS ever.  I feel like I'm totally in Buffy's
head
&gt; as it plays.

&gt; &gt; There
&gt; &gt; are some intense moments (Buffy meeting Dawn at school is incredibly
&gt; &gt; raw, and for some reason I didn't appreciate it last time), and I keep
&gt; &gt; focusing on the roles of Anya and Tara, whose reactions to death are
&gt; &gt; quite interesting in addition to being so well performed.

&gt; Buffy makes a little connection with them too in the hospital.  Well, she
&gt; does with everyone actually - even as she stays in her weird head space.
&gt; But Xander, Willow &amp; Giles are pretty much to be expected.  Long time
&gt; closeness with them.  Tara is a little new in this special sense.  When
she
&gt; speaks of her own experience with loss, I think it was the moment that
most
&gt; helped Buffy.

&gt; Anya is another matter.  Her oft referenced monologue back in Willow's
room
&gt; is good stuff, but I think I prefer her brief remarks at the hospital.

&gt; Anya: (a little too loudly) I wish that Joyce didn't die...
&gt; Anya: (more quietly) ...because she was nice. And now we all hurt.

&gt; It's pure Anya in delivery and content.  Yet, for all its awkwardness, it
&gt; communicates perfectly and poignantly.  Anya does seem to have a knack for
&gt; sensing the mood of the room.  And it speaks well for her development as
&gt; human.  Xander has taught her well.
">

Did Anya's awkwardness have something to do with her losing her humanity
because of her transformation (human-&gt;vengeance demon-&gt;human), or does it
have something to do with pre-demon Anya (just the way she was when she was
human the first time)?

I had the opposite reaction last year, and that hasn't changed.  All the
directorial fluorishes succeed in their mission of putting me in the
character's mental space.  I don't find the fluorishes all that obtrusive,
either; at least no worse than more common directorial tricks like, for
example, zooming the camera in on something important when the POV
character notices it.  But this is, not quite a question of taste,
something similar.  If you find those tricks obtrusive, then to you they
*are* obtrusive, and it's nothing I can argue you out of.  But my mileage
definitely varies from yours.  In my opinion it all succeeds brilliantly
well.  On sheer technical points, The Body has few rivals and no clear
superiors in the entire Whedonverse.  Of course it helps that the
performances framed by these directorial tactics are so skilled and
powerful.

I wonder if Buffy's stunned reaction to Joyce's death presages her
later complete collapse into catatonia after losing Dawn?  I doubt Joss
had Spiral in mind when writing The Body, but it does feel like the two
are related, if only distantly.  Maybe some sorts of losses evade the
Slayer defenses in Buffy's mind and thus hit her in just the right way to
incapacitate her.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Did you ever listen to a song over and over again, each time focusing on a
different instrument, first guitar, then bass, then drums?  You can do
something similar with characters on Joss's shows, especially in an
episode like The Body.  This last time I concentrated on Tara, especially
in the dorm scene.  Notice her reaction when Willow first snipes at Anya
(&quot;It's a thing we do&quot;), aware that Willow is behaving slightly badly but
sympathizing even more with the pain that's provoking this behavior.
Then later when she looks upset during Xander's rant about the frickin'
doctors, I felt like at that moment she was remembering her own mother's
death, and maybe her own helpless anger then.  Notice also that even at a
moment like this, Tara still has two distinct modes, being more vocal and
confident with Willow alone than in a group, even a group of friends.

Completely unimportant details: In act 1, the paper towel roll moves
across Buffy's kitchen, being near the sink when she picks up the phone
and on the center island when she needs a towel.  In the same act, the top
of the living room set briefly comes into the frame while Buffy is talking
to the paramedic.  And in act 4, the doctor fails to wash his hands after
examining Joyce's body.  I understand that Joss didn't want to take the
time to show that during the long moving shot from Joyce's body to the
waiting room, but still, that just strikes me as ... wrong.

&gt; &quot;Forever&quot; is one of those episodes I really want to like.  It's right
&gt; to take another episode specifically as a wind-down from the previous
&gt; one before going back to our silly* fantasy hellgod plot.  I've talked
&gt; before about how well it captures the oppressiveness of the mundane as
&gt; the people who've been by Buffy's side through dangerous times now try
&gt; to be her support and to take charge of grappling with things like how
&gt; to word a funeral program.
">

Agreed on both of those points.  The latter makes the first few scenes of
Forever sort of a continuation of The Body in a different key, both
touching on that oppressiveness of the mundane as a central part of the
experience of death.  However, things start to shift during the funeral
scene.  Of course it's sad, and I wouldn't have it any other way ... yet
for some reason I always start to feel like the episode is wallowing in
it, or maybe milking it.  Not that I think it's all downhill from here --
the rest of the episode does contain some pretty good scenes -- but at
that point The Body's spell has now been broken.

&gt; time guest spot that doesn't need to be anything more.
">

I find it deeply satisfying myself.  But I can appreciate OBS's comments
about Angel's behavior feeling odd in the context of what's happening on
AtS at this point.  I'm going to speculate that the visit to Sunnydale in
Forever was a chance for Angel to step back from his recent past and
temporarily return to an older persona with a little less baggage.  Not
unlike the strangely chipper Willow of Orpheus, come to think of it.  But
that's more of a fanwank than an analysis of what's actually on the

&quot;Dies&quot; is a strong word, but that final conversation is not BtVS at its
best.  Some of the dialogue is weak, the sisters' postures when they're
framing zombie Joyce's shadow feel awkward and forced, and I didn't buy
the slap at all.  And while SMG is great at crying, there's only so much
of it that can be done in one scene before it starts to feel weird.  But I
see a couple of things to like in its general content, if not the exact
words or actions.  One is the reason Buffy gives for keeping busy and
&quot;uncaring&quot;:  not because she has to for practical reasons, but as a
defense mechanism, because when she stops, then the loss really hits her.
And another is when zombie Joyce reaches the house, and Buffy falls, she
gives in to temptation, turning toward the door with a hopeful little
&quot;Mommy?&quot;  I find that as satisfyingly disturbing as her lapse into
near-hysteria just before the reset button is pushed in IWRY.  The final
shot of Buffy and Dawn weeping together isn't as conventional disturbing,
but feels right.  I'll break down and use the c-word for it, cathartic.

The robot humor mostly works for me, though it does get a bit repetitive
at times.  It's also amusing to see that bad boy Spike has a thing for
frilly girls.  Given what they knew at that point, I don't blame Buffy's
friends for failing to catch on to the robot.  If anything, they should
have suspected magic or demonic possession.  Or maybe a bunch of drugs.

The two plot lines, spiritquest and robofarce, with their different tones
and styles and levels of humor, complement each other well enough.  But
they complement each other the way two separate but related episodes often
complement each other rather than the way two parts of one tightly
scripted episode should complement each other.  Seriously, if it wasn't
for the robofarce story's need to get Buffy out of town for a night,
there'd be no reason these two stories needed to be in the same episode.

I don't love it, but it could have been worse -- they could have made it a

was a one-time reward, not something that should get his hopes up;  and
the whole episode shows us over and over again how *wrong* a Buffy-Spike
love would be, so we need not fear that the writers are going down that
path without justification.  Given that, it's ... tolerable, I'll say.

The short answer I think is both.  Anya is the sum of her life.  The
somewhat longer answer is that Anya's personality/manner was developed
during her first bout as human.  Her lack of understanding of
humanity/society and so on is from lack of meaningful contact, both as human
and demon, though 1100 years as a demon is rather longer than 17 as a human.
In other words, what little social skills she had originally were probably
forgotten after 1100 years of disuse, but she appears to have had minimal
social interaction to begin with.  Her extensive knowledge of demon lore and
her use of demon life as a standard by which to measure human life comes
from her demon experience.  More recently has been the Xander influence
which has disrupted, but not overcome her prior influences.

The really long answer requires an analysis of Anya's lack of self identity
and how that fuels her isolation, her fear of rejection, her greed, her
uncritical acceptance of assorted outside influences (as in latching onto
both capitalism and communism at different times, becoming all about
vengeance, and living her life through Xander), her tendency to abstract
feelings (perversely paired with poorly controlled outbursts of feeling),
and probably just about everything else in her nature.  But I don't care to
go fully into that now.  Hopefully that adequately hints at the direction.

Any way I look at it, though, it's not an either or proposition.

Agreed.  Just adding that I like the little joke (I know that's not
universal) that the writers let us spend years assuming that she just
doesn't get humanity simply because it's been so long, and then we
find out that she's always kinda behaved this way.  And then we
explore what it means, too, because &quot;Selfless&quot; is that kind of
episode.

I'd known basically from the beginning that Buffy and Spike would get
together, and that a certain segment of the fanbase tended to get
annoyingly squeely about it.  So I was basically prepared to hate it
whenever it happened.  Maybe that didn't give me false hope that they
wouldn't hook up, but it also made me appreciate perhaps even more
than an unspoiled viewer how many times the show had the chance to go
down that path without justification, and didn't.  For years, BTVS
doesn't pull the trigger until it makes sense to do so, and when they
finally do find something resembling love towards the very end of the
series, the show has earned it.

&gt; &gt; that they ended up with, really taking the time to let her and Tara be
&gt; &gt; together.

&gt; Agreed with all that.  The final version also makes S6 more unified in
&gt; plot and theme, as all the core characters go through near-simultaneous
&gt; crises with their romantic (or at least sexual) partners and suffer
&gt; related blows to their self-esteems.  (Or is that selves-esteem?)  I think
&gt; it works well, though some might wonder if I'm just a gloomaholic.

Those of us who really like S6 may often be accused of being
gloomaholics.  Or relentless-sex-and-violence-aholics.

Oh, forgot to mention that I don't agree with the doubt that Joss had
the connection in mind from the beginning.  Within the context of the
series - and maybe I'm speaking retrospectively, yeah, but it feels
true - Joyce's death (at least in the style in which it happens) only
makes sense occurring at this point, and Buffy's system failure only
makes sense towards the end of a season in which Joyce dies.

&quot;Spiral&quot; was only 4 episodes following &quot;The Body&quot;.  The plots for the
final episodes of season 5 were probably well developed by the time the
final draft of &quot;The Body&quot; was being written.

Oh, certainly Joss knew, when writing The Body, that Buffy would go
catatonic later in the season.  What I doubt is that Buffy's stunned and
dazed reaction to Joyce's death was written in order to lay the groundwork
for her collapse at the end of Spiral.  My gut feeling is that Joss wrote
her that way in The Body because that was simply the kind of initial
reaction to death he wanted to explore, and the setup for Spiral/TWOTW was
just a bonus.  Admittedly, my guts are not infallible.
