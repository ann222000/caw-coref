Some commentators suggested that Jerry Kilgore's harping on the
illegal-immigrant issue was no more than an election-year ploy. Now
comes the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. According to
Gary Robertson with the Richmond Times-Dispatch :

The council authorized its executive director to voice support in the
legislature for admitting illegal immigrants to Virginia's public
institutions of higher education. ...

Vice Chairman Bittle W. Porterfield III of Roanoke said illegal
immigrants are living openly in Virginia and not much of an effort is
being made to remove them. That being the case, Porterfield said, "we
have the obligation to educate them."

Council Chairman Alan Wurtzel of Delaplane said that if illegal
immigrants have access to higher education, they can contribute to the
economy rather than being a burden to it.

Looks to me like the what-do-we-do-with-illegal-aliens question is an
ongoing one, not a campaign stunt. Next question: Do illegals residing
in Virginia qualify for in-state tuitions?

I don't think we owe them anything. They are here illegally, let them
deal with it.

The question is, what do we owe ourselves? Do we owe ourselves a rule
of law that is two faced or inadequately enforced?.

Do we owe ourselves a white economy, black economy, brown economy,
and gray economy? It is not just illegals that are underpaid, paid off
the books, or taken advantage of.

Do we owe ourselves the intellectual honesty to look at the situation
without rancor and figure out how to make the best of it?

Should we complain about them not paying taxes, or find a way to
collect the taxes?

We don't owe them anything because they are illegal and they don't
owe us anything because they are illegal.

It seems to me that if we think about it, we can both do better.

Now comes the news that even the Massachusetts legislature has
rejected a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrant students to
pay the same in-state tuition at state colleges as Massachusetts
residents.

Supporters of the bill had argued that the children of illegal
immigrants who have graduated from Massachusetts high schools should pay
the same tuition as their classmates.

Gov. Mitt Romney opposed the bill, and it went down to defeat
Wednesday 96 to 57.

Two points here:

1) I think that if a state allows illegal immigrants to pay in-state
tuition, then they also have to allow students from any other state to
pay in-state tuition. I believe this is federal law so if Virginia moves
in this direction, its universities and colleges may be losing a chunk
of money from out-of-state students, money it can ill afford to lose.

2) It is illegal for any business or individual to knowingly employ a
person who is in the US illegally. Why would VA - or any other state -
be willing to subsidize the education of anyone who can't be legally
employed anywhere in the US? If any of our state colleges and
universities have a pile of money lying around that they don't know what
to do with, please check down in SW Virginia. There are a lot of
students down here who would be thrilled to get help with higher
education costs.

It's a difficult issue given the 14th Amendment's citizenship
definitions. I suppose the states have considerable latitude in
establishing criteria for "in-state" status or to grant other
educational access, but are probably under constitutional obligations to
apply those criteria in an equal manner to all similarly situated. A
child of an illegal alien born (the child, that is) in the United States
is, as I understand it, a U.S. citizen at least until they get around to
amending the Constitution (I acknowledge that some feel this can be done
by federal statute, but I don't see how). The U.S. citizen child of an
illegal alien living in Virginia probably has all the rights to
state-sponsored education as any other U.S. citizen children living in
Virginia. I haven't studied up on this. so would be pleased to be put
straight if I've missed something. But I posit that if indeed this is an
issue, it's probably not one the state legislature can solve on its own.

If they can afford to send $14 to $18 billion dollars back home a
year, they can afford to pay out-of-state tuition. Let's put it this
way, if they get in-state tuition, then regular and honest taxpayers
would be subsidizing the continued illegal activity AND outflow of
capital.

wOOt: The first sentence implies that there should be some sort of
means-testing for in-state tuition. I personally would not like to see
that, but that may reflect my own financial position. Suffice it to say,
the figures you cite are aggregates and say little about the financial
capacity of any given household.

Your next point is more complicated. The relationship between illegal
immigration and tax policy is fairly gnarly. Illegal workers do
contribute tax revenues, but the extent of the capture is defies
accurate measurement. Not every dollar earned by every illegal alien is
"untaxed." However, having a handle on this income stream is one of the
reasons the Adminsitration is trying to regularize the guest-worker
concept.

Capital outflows are neutral events economically (leaving aside the
tax-tracking issues mentioned above). Money earned here (or in any other
country) and expatriated (to here or any other country) generally does
us no harm, and may do us considerable indirect good. That's not an
argument for illegal immigration. It's simply a reason that can be taken
off the board for being concerned about illegal immigration.

How much of the revenue that results from untaxed labor results in
unreported and untaxed earnings to the businesses that hire illegals?

-------------------------------

Here is part of a post that connects illegals with housing
afordability. It is from

http://www.livejournal.com/users/erudito/344156.html

"Using Wikipedia to track down which cities where in which counties
if they were not listed in the locality data, I put together the data
and ran a correlation of housing (un)affordability (the higher the index
the less affordable) against % of residents who were foreign born.

The correlation was 0.74. For 72 US cities, a sizeable sample.

If one excluded the five Texan cities (because Texas really does have
a very anti-land regulation political culture), the correlation for the
remaining 67 cities shot up to 0.82.

You just donâ€™t normally get correlations in social analysis that
high. (A perfect correlation is 1.0).

Basically, if a city has lots of foreigners (and is outside Texas),
it has lots of restrictions on land use. (The issue is not simply
population growth, a lot of the highly affordable cities have high
population growth.) "

Right now, any child born to illegal immigrants in the US is
recognized as a citizen and is entitled to in-state tuition just like
any other citizen. This issue applies only to people who were brought to
the US as young children but were born elsewhere and are therefore
citizens of the country in which they were born. These children are not
citizens any more than their illegal immigrant parents are.

It should not be necessary to amend the Constitution to deny
citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants. A simple federal law
should do. The 14th amendment was passed to assure that slaves and their
descendants were recognized as citizens, not to evade immigration laws.
The one Supreme Court challenge that resulted in the recognition of a
child born to non-citizens as a citizen (US vs Wong Kim Ark in 1898)
involved a man born to legal Chinese residents who were ineligible to
become citizens because they were Chinese and who had returned to China.
There has never been a decision regarding the children of people in the
US illegally.

BTW the Center for Immigration Studies published a report in October
2005 that notes that an estimated 380,000 children were born to illegal
immigrants in the US in 2002, about 1 in 10 births that year.

Ray Hyde: I would think very little. The cost of that labor would
affect the ultimate net income figure of a company, but it isn't
segregated in any visible way (e.g., "Payments to Illegal Immigrants").
Businesses have every reason to report all expense items. So my
un-reseached surmise is that there is no direct tax impact on earnings
for a company using undocumented workers.

Anon: The wording of the XIV amendment is pretty clear. Your point is
well-taken on the origins, but my sense is that it would require an
amendment to overturn past practice. I know several Europeans who carry
US passports simply because they were born here. Of course, this
occurred when their parents were here legally.

nova scout, I think the word "legally" is key here. There has never
been a test of whether a child born to someone in the US illegally is a
citizen. Years ago, there were so few that this wasn't a problem. Now it
is.

BTW it isn't exactly unusual for a SCOTUS decision to "overturn" a
previous one, as in Brown vs Board of Education. I say let's do the law
first and let SCOTUS decide. Then if necessary do an amendment. <
