Bush and Napoleon Both Believed Their Own Propaganda About a &quot;Greater Middle East&quot;

French Egypt and American Iraq can be considered bookends on the history of modern
imperialism in the Middle East. The Bush administration's already failed version of the
conquest of Iraq is, of course, on everyone's mind; while the French conquest of Egypt,
now more than two centuries past, is all too little remembered, despite having been led
by Napoleon Bonaparte, whose career has otherwise hardly languished in obscurity. There
are many eerily familiar resonances between the two misadventures, not least among them
that both began with supreme arrogance and ended as fiascoes. Above all, the leaders of
both occupations employed the same basic political vocabulary and rhetorical
flimflammery, invoking the spirit of liberty, security, and democracy while largely
ignoring the substance of these concepts.

The French general and the American president do not much resemble one another --
except perhaps in the way the prospect of conquest in the Middle East appears to have
put fire in their veins and in their unappealing tendency to believe their own
propaganda (or at least to keep repeating it long after it became completely
implausible). Both leaders invaded and occupied a major Arabic-speaking Muslim country;
both harbored dreams of a &quot;Greater Middle East&quot;; both were surprised to find themselves
enmeshed in long, bitter, debilitating guerrilla wars. Neither genuinely cared about
grassroots democracy, but both found its symbols easy to invoke for gullible domestic
publics. Substantial numbers of their new subjects quickly saw, however, that they
faced occupations, not liberations.

My own work on Bonaparte's lost year in Egypt began in the mid-1990s, and I had
completed about half of Napoleon's Egypt: Invading the Middle East before September 11,
2001. I had no way of knowing then that a book on such a distant, scholarly subject
would prove an allegory for Bush's Iraq War. Nor did I guess that the United States
would give old-style colonialism in the Middle East one last try, despite clear signs
that the formerly colonized would no longer put up with such acts and had, in the years
since World War II, gained the means to resist them.

The republic militant goes to war

In June of 1798, as his enormous flotilla -- 36,000 soldiers, thousands of sailors, and
hundreds of scientists on 12 ships of the line -- swept inexorably toward the Egyptian
coast, the young General Napoleon Bonaparte issued a grandiose communiqué to the
bewildered and seasick troops he was about to march into the desert without canteens or
reasonable supplies of water. He declared, &quot;Soldiers! You are about to undertake a
conquest, the effects of which on civilization and commerce are incalculable.&quot;

The prediction was as tragically inaccurate in its own way as the pronouncement George
W. Bush issued some two centuries later, on May 1, 2003, also from the deck of a great
ship of the line, the aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Today,&quot; he said, &quot;we
have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and aggressive regime.
With new tactics and precision weapons, we can achieve military objectives without
directing violence against civilians.&quot;

Both men were convinced that their invasions were announcing new epochs in human
history. Of the military vassals of the Ottoman Empire who then ruled Egypt, Bonaparte
predicted: &quot;The Mameluke Beys who favor exclusively English commerce, whose extortions
oppress our merchants, and who tyrannize over the unfortunate inhabitants of the Nile,
a few days after our arrival will no longer exist.&quot;

Bonaparte's laundry list of grievances about them consisted of three charges. First,
the beys were, in essence, enablers of France's primary enemy at that time, the British
monarchy which sought to strangle the young French republic in its cradle. Second, the
rulers of Egypt were damaging France's own commerce by extorting taxes and bribes from
its merchants in Cairo and Alexandria. Third, the Mamluks ruled tyrannically, having
never been elected, and oppressed their subjects whom Bonaparte intended to liberate.

This holy trinity of justifications for imperialism -- that the targeted state is
collaborating with an enemy of the republic, is endangering the positive interests of
the nation, and lacks legitimacy because its rule is despotic -- would all be trotted
out over the subsequent two centuries by a succession of European and American leaders
whenever they wanted to go on the attack. One implication of these familiar rhetorical
turns of phrase has all along been that democracies have a license to invade any
country they please, assuming it has the misfortune to have an authoritarian regime.

George W. Bush, of course, hit the same highlights in his &quot;mission accomplished&quot;
speech, while announcing on the Abraham Lincoln that &quot;major combat operations&quot; in Iraq
&quot;had ended.&quot; &quot;The liberation of Iraq,&quot; he proclaimed, &quot;is a crucial advance in the
campaign against terror. We've removed an ally of al Qaeda, and cut off a source of
terrorist funding.&quot; He put Saddam Hussein's secular, Arab nationalist Baath regime and
the radical Muslim terrorists of al-Qaeda under the sign of September 11th, insinuating
that Iraq was allied with the primary enemy of the United States and so posed an urgent
menace to its security. (In fact, captured Baath Party documents show that Saddam's
fretting security forces, on hearing that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had entered Iraq, put
out an all points bulletin on him, imagining -- not entirely correctly -- that he had
al-Qaeda links.) Likewise, Bush promised that Iraq's alleged &quot;weapons of mass
destruction&quot; (which existed only in his own fevered imagination) would be tracked down,
again implying that Iraq posed a threat to the interests and security of the U.S., just
as Bonaparte had claimed that the Mamluks menaced France.

According to the president, Saddam's overthrown government had lacked legitimacy, while
the new Iraqi government, to be established by a foreign power, would truly represent
the conquered population. &quot;We're helping to rebuild Iraq, where the dictator built
palaces for himself, instead of hospitals and schools. And we will stand with the new
leaders of Iraq,&quot; Bush pledged, &quot;as they establish a government of, by, and for the
Iraqi people.&quot; Bonaparte, too, established governing councils at the provincial and
national level, staffing them primarily with Sunni clergymen, declaring them more
representative of the Egyptian people than the beys and emirs of the slave soldiery who
had formerly ruled that province of the Ottoman Empire.

Liberty as tyranny

For a democracy to conduct a brutal military occupation against another country in the
name of liberty seems, on the face of it, too contradictory to elicit more than hoots
of derision at the hypocrisy of it all. Yet, the militant republic, ready to launch
aggressive war in the name of &quot;democracy,&quot; is everywhere in modern history, despite the
myth that democracies do not typically wage wars of aggression. Ironically, some
absolutist regimes, like those of modern Iran, were remarkably peaceable, if left alone
by their neighbors. In contrast, republican France invaded Belgium, Holland, Spain,
Germany, Italy, and Egypt in its first decade (though it went on the offensive in part
in response to Austrian and Prussian moves to invade France). The United States
attacked Mexico, the Seminoles and other Native polities, Hawaii, the Spanish Empire,
the Philippines, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic in just the seven-plus decades from
1845 to the eve of the U.S. entry into World War I.

Freedom and authoritarianism are nowadays taken to be stark antonyms, the provinces of
heroes and monsters. Those closer to the birth of modern republics were comforted by no
such moral clarity. In Danton's Death, the young Romantic playwright Georg Büchner
depicted the radical French revolutionary and proponent of executing enemies of the
Republic, Maximilien Robespierre, whipping up a Parisian crowd with the phrase, &quot;The
revolutionary regime is the despotism of liberty against tyranny.&quot; And nowhere has
liberty proved more oppressive than when deployed against a dictatorship abroad; for,
as Büchner also had that famed &quot;incorruptible&quot; devotee of state terror observe, &quot;In a
Republic only republicans are citizens; Royalists and foreigners are enemies.&quot;

That sunlit May afternoon on the USS Abraham Lincoln, President Bush seconded Büchner's
Robespierre. &quot;Because of you,&quot; he exhorted the listening sailors of an aircraft carrier
whose planes had just dropped 1.6 million pounds of ordnance on Iraq, &quot;our nation is
more secure. Because of you, the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free.&quot;

Security for the republic had already proved ample justification to launch a war the
previous March, even though Iraq was a poor, weak, ramshackle Third World country,
debilitated by a decade of sanctions imposed by the United Nations and the United
States, without so much as potable drinking water or an air force. Similarly, the
Mamluks of Egypt -- despite the sky-high taxes and bribes they demanded of some French
merchants -- hardly constituted a threat to French security.

The overthrow of a tyrannical regime and the liberation of an oppressed people were
constant refrains in the shipboard addresses of both the general and the president, who
felt that the liberated owed them a debt of gratitude. Bonaparte lamented that the beys
&quot;tyrannize over the unfortunate inhabitants of the Nile&quot;; or, as one of his officers,
Captain Horace Say, opined, &quot;The people of Egypt were most wretched. How will they not
cherish the liberty we are bringing them?&quot; Similarly, Bush insisted, &quot;Men
