II. Main findings

Feeling of security and concern

Absence of personal security , is the major issue of concern among
respondents from the two regions, followed by the economic hardship of the
households and the internal power struggle;

The highest level of concern is among those trusting Fateh (90%), those
trusting no faction (83%), and among the Gaza residents (80%);

The highest feeling of security is among Hamas respondents (61%) and Gaza
Strip respondents (50%). In the West Bank, only 34% feel secure about their
family and property. Feeling of insecurity slightly decreased (-3%) between
July and August, 2007.

Factional Trust

Trust in Hamas has increased from 18% in July to 23% in August while trust
in Fateh remained unchanged at 38%.

Support for Fateh is higher in Gaza (43%) than in the West Bank (33%). In
the Gaza Strip,. 29% of Gaza respondents give their trust to Hamas, as
opposed to 18% of West Bank respondents. Lack of trust in any faction is
significantly higher in the West Bank (42%) than in the Gaza Strip (24%).

Early elections

Level of confidence that dialogue between Fateh and Hamas will resume is
among 55% of the respondents. This confidence is significantly higher among
Hamas and Gaza Strip respondents;

66% of the respondents oppose holding elections in phases. Ironically, this
opposition is higher among Fateh respondents than among Hamas respondents;

Approximately 70% of the respondents are in favor of early PLC and
presidential elections. About 90% of Fateh respondents support holding early
PLC elections as opposed to 40% of Hamas respondents. Other respondents tend
to be more in tune with Fateh than with Hamas respondents on this matter. As
for the presidential elections, support for it among Hamas respondents
increases to 60% while it drops among Fateh respondents to 78%;

Between 27%-30% of the respondents said that they will not participate in
either election. As for the other respondents, approximately 40% stated
their preference to Fateh and 15% to Hamas. Non-participation in elections
is four times higher among Hamas than among Fateh respondents.

Over 70% believe that Hamas will sabotage the early elections. This view is
stronger among Gaza respondents as well as Fateh respondents;

The majority of the respondents who do not trust any faction said that they
will not participate in either election.

The peace process

The majority of the Palestinians do not believe that the appointment of Tony
Blair will have a positive impact on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Only
27% believe that his presence will have a positive impact. The highest
positive attitude towards Blair's role is among Fateh respondents (42%);

Level of support for convening a peace conference, as outlined by President
Bush, in the Middle East is evenly split. As for Fateh supporters, 74% of
their respondents think of this call rather positively;

69% of the Palestinians support a peace settlement with Israel, a 10%
increase since May 2007). Support for a peace settlement is among 85% of
Fateh respondents and 45% of Hamas respondents;

63% of the respondents are of the position that Hamas should change its
position regarding the elimination of the state of Israel. This view is
significantly stronger among Fateh than among Hamas respondents.

The economic situation

It is estimated that 59% of the respondents in August fall below the poverty
line. Poverty is more prominent among Fateh and Hamas supporters. While the
percentage of poverty in the West Bank is 51%, the level of poverty in the
Gaza Strip reaches 71%;

About 20% of the labor force is unemployed and 9% are partially employed. In
the Gaza Strip, unemployment reaches 23%, as compared to 18% in the West
Bank.

Other issues

81% of the respondents do not support an expansion of Hamas's control to the
West Bank. Even 48% of Hamas supporters are not in favor of such a prospect;

The majority (66%) believe that the surrender of weapons by some Palestinian
fighters in exchange for amnesty is a positive step. This view is also
shared by 49% of Hamas supporters.

THE LEADERSHIP

Trust in Abu Mazen has dropped from 66% in July to 63% in August. As for
Hanieh, there has been a slight increase in his favor (from 34% in July to
37% in August). The increase in the level of trust fir Hanieh is also
witnessed when comparing his standing with Salam Fayyad,

The most trusted Palestinian leader is Mahmoud Abbas (29%) followed by
Ismael Hanieh (22%) and Marwan Barghouthi (20%). About 10% of the
respondents mentioned Dr. Mustapha Barghouthi as the most trusted
Palestinian leader. Only 2% mentioned Muhammad Dahlan and 1% mentioned Dr.
Mahmoud Zahhar. Support for both Abbas and Hanieh is stronger in the Gaza
Strip than in the West Bank;

The majority of the Palestinians (42%) view Marwan Barghouthi as the most
suitable person to lead Fateh, as opposed to 33% who mentioned Mahmoud
Abbas. As for Fateh supporters, the majority (53%) see Abbas as the most
suitable leader while only 35% mentioned Marwan Barghouthi;

The majority of the Palestinians (34%) view Ismael Hanieh as the most
suitable person to lead Hamas, followed by 14% who mentioned Abdul Aziz
Dweik the imprisoned leader of the PLC. As for Hamas supporters, 62%
mentioned Ismael Hanieh while 19% mentioned Khaled Mashal. Support for Dr.
Zahhar is very negligible even among Hamas supporters (6%).
