So for the Woodfire pre-conference with Chuck Hindes I decided to
glaze some teabowls and mail them to Charlie who will get them in the
Anagama. I went with the following:

KATZ 111
WHITING
FLINT
EPK

RHODES 20
85 CORNWALL STONE
15 WHITING

TAKADA ORIBE
80 CUSTER
20 WHITING
5 COPPER CARB

BLACK
50 CUSTER
50 RAVENSCRAG
10 BLACK IRON

The idea was to use limestone (or slip clay) which have this Kansas or
Kentucky affinity. Like 1000 grams dry with a spoonful each of
bentonite and epsom salts - with the Katz I went a bit thin with
because of the high clay content - the rest I glazed kinda thick -
filled the bowl with glaze, poured it out, let the drips run down.
Added a few more horizontal drips with the baby snot remover tool.
Used Miller porcelain and B-Mix. Only did 2 bowls with the black which
was shot from the hip, no idea where that one came from. We'll see
what happens. Since mailing unfired but glazed bisque USPS CMC or
other gum would have been a good idea but didn't have any. I wrapped
each pice in a plastic bag from Safeway.

Book air fare and will stay at the folks house. Use their second car.
Might like to camp out at Corydon - maybe
