A lot of people have been saying Bush is wrong about how he is
fighting the war.  However, to my knowledge, Bush hasn't, actually,
planned even ONE military strategy.  He keeps going to the generals
and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do.  In fact,
even the troop surge plan was a suggestion of the commanders.  So,
when you are saying the war is being fought in a wrong way, you are
not saying that BUSH is wrong.  You are saying that ALL of the top
staff at the Pentagon is wrong and the commanders on the ground in
Iraq.

When your car breaks down, you don't tell the mechanic you know
better.  When you are facing surgery, you don't tell the doctor how to
operate.  However, Democrats think that politicians (experts at
deception and speeches) know better how to win a war than trained
military commanders.  How is that?

from The Nation:

Revolt of the Generals

by RICHARD J. WHALEN

A revolt is brewing among our retired Army and Marine generals. This
rebellion--quiet and nonconfrontational, but remarkable
nonetheless--comes not because their beloved forces are bearing the
brunt of ground combat in Iraq but because the retirees see the US
adventure in Mesopotamia as another Vietnam-like, strategically failed
war, and they blame the errant, arrogant civilian leadership at the
Pentagon. The dissenters include two generals who led combat troops in
Iraq: Maj. Gen. Charles Swannack Jr., who commanded the 82nd Airborne
Division, and Maj. Gen. John Batiste, who led the First Infantry
Division (the &quot;Big Red One&quot;). These men recently sacrificed their
careers by retiring and joining the public protest.

In late September Batiste, along with two other retired senior officers,
spoke out about these failures at a Washington Democratic policy
hearing, with Batiste saying Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was &quot;not
a competent wartime leader&quot; who made &quot;dismal strategic decisions&quot; that
&quot;resulted in the unnecessary deaths of American servicemen and women,
our allies and the good people of Iraq.&quot; Rumsfeld, he said, &quot;dismissed
honest dissent&quot; and &quot;did not tell the American people the truth for fear
of losing support for the war.&quot;

This kind of protest among senior military retirees during wartime is
unprecedented in American history--and it is also deeply worrisome. The
retired officers opposing the war and demanding Rumsfeld's ouster
represent a new political force, and therefore a potentially powerful
factor in the future of our democracy. The former generals' growing
lobby could acquire a unique veto power in the future by publicly
opposing reckless civilian warmaking in advance.

No one should be surprised by the antiwar dissent emerging among those
who have commanded our legions on the fringes of the US military empire.
After more than sixty-five years of increasingly centralized and secret
presidential warmaking, we have concentrated ultimate civilian authority
in fewer and fewer hands. Some of these leaders have been proved by
events to be incompetent.

I speak regularly to retired generals, former intelligence officers and
former Pentagon officials and aides, all of whom remain close to their
active-duty friends and protégés. These well-informed seniors tell me
that whatever the original US objective was in Iraq, our understrength
forces and flawed strategy have failed, and that we cannot repair this
failure by remaining there indefinitely. Fundamental changes are needed,
and senior officers are prepared to make them. According to my sources,
some active-duty officers are working behind the scenes to end the war
and are preparing for the inevitable US withdrawal. &quot;The only question
is whether a war serves the national interest,&quot; declares a retired
three-star general. &quot;Iraq does not.&quot;

How widespread is antiwar feeling among the retired and active-duty
senior military? And does it extend into the younger active-duty officer
corps? These are unanswerable questions. The soldiers who defend our
democracy on the battlefield fight within military, and therefore
nondemocratic, organizations. They are sworn to uphold the Constitution
and obey orders. Traditionally, they debate only on the &quot;inside.&quot;

Earlier this year, Gen. George Casey, the top American commander in
Iraq, drafted a highly classified briefing plan that was leaked to the
/New York Times/ in June. It called for sharply reducing US troop levels
in Iraq from the current fourteen combat brigades to a half-dozen or so
by late December 2007. The plan contained a great many caveats, and
events soon rendered it obsolete. Now General Casey says the Iraqi
security forces may be ready to take the lead role in twelve to eighteen
months, but he says nothing about troop withdrawals.

Casey's leaked plan revealed the thinking of some of today's top-level
officers. These senior military men believe that our forces will have to
win the potentially decisive battle for Baghdad before the United States
can leave. In August the Army announced an urgent transfer of American
forces from insecure western Iraq to the capital in preparation for that
coming battle. The move barely doubled the number of troops in Baghdad,
to only 14,000 GIs spread over a sprawling metropolis with a population
exceeding 7 million.

On August 3 the commander of US forces in the Middle East, Gen. John
Abizaid, the universally respected, Arabic-speaking warrior-scholar who
knows Iraq intimately, testified before the Senate Armed Services
Committee that worsening Iraqi sectarian violence, especially in
Baghdad, &quot;could move [Iraq] towards civil war.&quot; In private, senior
officers openly refer to civil war, and have indicated that the Army
would depart in such circumstances to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

The dissenting retired generals are bent on making Iraq this nation's
last strategically failed war--that is, one doggedly waged by civilian
officials largely to avoid personal accountability for their bad
decisions. A failed war causes mounting human and other costs, damaging
or entirely destroying the national interest it was supposed to serve.

Let me interject a personal note. At the height of the Vietnam War,
between 1966 and 1968, I was a conservative Republican in my early 30s
on the campaign staff of the likely next President, Richard Nixon. What
I heard from junior officers returning from Vietnam convinced me that US
military involvement there should give way to diplomacy. We no longer
had a coherent political objective, and were fighting only to avoid
admitting defeat. I wrote Nixon's secret plan for &quot;ending the war and
winning the peace,&quot; a rhetorical screen for striking a summit deal with
the Soviet Union, followed by a historic opening to China that would
allow us to extricate ourselves from what we belatedly recognized was an
anti-Chinese Indochina.

After I left Nixon's staff in August 1968, I helped end the draft. In
1969-70, I co-wrote and edited the /Report of the President's Commission
on an All-Volunteer Armed Force/. Our blockbuster proposal to end the
draft combined political expediency and libertarian idealism. Our
staff's numbers crunchers calculated that if we raised enlisted men's
pay scales, retention rates among the sons of lower- to middle-income
families would stay high enough to create a de facto all-volunteer Army.
So why not take credit for acting on principle? Nixon's domestic adviser
Martin Anderson pushed it, the private computers of consultant Alan
Greenspan (who would go on to become chair of the Federal Reserve
System) confirmed it and I delivered the text that the commission
accepted. Nixon, for once, enjoyed the media's acclaim. The draft was
swiftly abolished.

The Iraq War only confirms the wisdom of the nation's commitment to the
all-volunteer armed forces. A draft would merely prolong the Iraq agony,
not avoid defeat. More than 2,700 GIs killed and more than 20,000
wounded, along with tens of thousands of dead and wounded Iraqis, are
enough to carry on the nation's conscience.

Some of the officers from the first generation of the volunteer Army,
now mostly retired, are speaking out and influencing their active-duty
colleagues. Retired Lieut. Gen. William Odom calls the Iraq War &quot;the
worst strategic mistake in the history of the United States&quot; and draws a
grim parallel with the Vietnam War. He says that US strategy in Iraq, as
in Vietnam, has served almost exclusively the interests of our enemies.
He says that our objectives in Vietnam passed through three phases
leading to defeat. These were: (1) 1961-65, &quot;containing&quot; China; (2)
1965-68, obsession with US tactics, leading to &quot;Americanization&quot; of the
war; and (3) 1968-75, phony diplomacy and self-deluding
&quot;Vietnamization.&quot; Iraq has now completed two similar phases and is
entering the third, says Odom, now a senior fellow at the Hudson
Institute. In March he wrote in the newsletter of Harvard's Nieman
Foundation:

Will Phase Three in Iraq end with U.S. helicopters flying out of
Baghdad's Green Zone? It all sounds so familiar. The difference lies in
the consequences. Vietnam did not have the devastating effects on U.S.
power that Iraq is already having. On this point, those who deny the
Vietnam-Iraq analogy are probably right. They are wrong, however, in
believing that staying the course will have any result other than making
the damage to U.S. power far greater than would changing course and
making an orderly withdrawal.... But even in its differences, Vietnam
can be instructive about Iraq. Once the U.S. position in Vietnam
collapsed, Washington was free to reverse the negative trends it faced
in NATO and U.S.-Soviet military balance, in the world economy, in its
international image, and in other areas. Only by getting out of Iraq can
the United States possibly gain sufficient international support to
design a new strategy for limiting the burgeoning growth of anti-Western
forces it has unleashed....

The fact that so many retired generals are speaking out against the war
and against Rumsfeld, and are doing

The facts do speak for themselves.  It took us less time to defeat both the
German and the Japanese army's in WWII than the time we've been in Iraq.  And we
aren't even close to pacifying the Country.

Rumsfeld and his Generals bear most of the Blame but their successors haven't
fared much better.

Abraham Lincoln is a good role model for Georgey boy.  General Mead just kicked
the shit out of Lees army at Gettysburg.  Did he get a pat on the back and a
thataboy from Lincoln?  Hell no, he got canned  for failing to go after Lees
army and finish the Job.

Rumsfeld and his crony's should have got the same treatment as soon as the
situation got out of hand in Iraq.  Around the time we pulled down the statue
and people started to loot Baghdad not to mention the tons of unguarded
explosive that have come back to haunt us.

Unfortunately Georgey boy is no Lincoln and the second Republican to lose a war.

&gt; 1965-68, obsession with US tactics, leading to &quot;Americanization&quot; of the
&gt; war; and (3) 1968-75, phony diplomacy and self-deluding
&gt; &quot;Vietnamization.&quot; Iraq has now completed two similar phases and is
&gt; entering the third, says Odom, now a senior fellow at the Hudson
&gt; Institute. In March he wrote in the newsletter of Harvard's Nieman
&gt; Foundation:

&gt; Will Phase Three in Iraq end with U.S. helicopters flying out of
&gt; Baghdad's Green Zone? It all sounds so familiar. The difference lies in
&gt; the consequences. Vietnam did not have the devastating effects on U.S.
&gt; power that Iraq is already having. On this point, those who deny the
&gt; Vietnam-Iraq analogy are probably right. They are wrong, however, in
&gt; believing that staying the course will have any result other than making
&gt; the damage to U.S. power far greater than would changing course and

The generals devise strategies to try to best achieve the goals that
Bush tells them to achieve.  That does not mean that the goals are

Victory is impossible.  There is no strategy for victory.  Bush at
best can hope to hang on long enough and try to spin things so that it

But he had lost the war within 6 months of starting it through
incompetence.  He just managed to conceal this fact until after the

Pentagon Contradicts General on Iraq Occupation Force's Size
By Eric Schmitt
New York Times
February 28, 2003
In a contentious exchange over the costs of war with Iraq, the
Pentagon's second-ranking official today disparaged a top Army
general's assessment of the number of troops needed to secure postwar
Iraq. House Democrats then accused the Pentagon official, Paul D.
Wolfowitz, of concealing internal administration estimates on the cost
of fighting and rebuilding the country.
Mr. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, opened a two-front war of
words on Capitol Hill, calling the recent estimate by Gen. Eric K.
Shinseki of the Army that several hundred thousand troops would be
needed in postwar Iraq, &quot;wildly off the mark.&quot; Pentagon officials have
put the figure closer to 100,000 troops. Mr. Wolfowitz then dismissed
articles in several newspapers this week asserting that Pentagon
budget specialists put the cost of war and reconstruction at $60
billion to $95 billion in this fiscal year. He said it was impossible
to predict accurately a war's duration, its destruction and the extent
of rebuilding afterward.
...

In an unusual admission, Abizaid said there should have been more U.S.
troops, as well as Iraqi and foreign forces, to stabilize the country
immediately after the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. &quot;General [Eric]
Shinseki was right that a greater international force contribution,
U.S. force contribution and Iraqi force contribution should have been
available immediately after major combat operations,&quot; he said.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR200...

Gen. Merrill &quot;Tony&quot; McPeak
Air Force chief of staff, 1990-94
We have a force in Iraq that's much too small to stabilize the
situation. It's about half the size, or maybe even a third, of what we
need. As a consequence, the insurgency seems to be gathering
momentum.

Adm. Stansfield Turner
NATO Allied commander for Southern Europe, 1975-77; CIA director,
1977-81
I think we are in a real mess. There are eighty-seven attacks on
Americans every day, and our people in Baghdad can't even leave the
International Zone without being heavily armored. I think we are in
trouble because we were so slow in terms of reconstruction and
reconstituting the military and police forces.

Lt. Gen. William Odom
Director of the National Security Agency, 1985-88
...
The idea of creating a constitutional state in a short amount of time
is a joke. It will take ten to fifteen years, and that is if we want
to kill ten percent of the population.

Gen. Anthony Zinni
Commander in chief of the United States Central Command, 1997-2000
...
When I was commander of CENTCOM, we had a plan for an invasion of
Iraq, and it had specific numbers in it. We wanted to go in there with
350,000 to 380,000 troops. You didn't need that many people to defeat
the Republican Guard, but you needed them for the aftermath. We knew
that we would find ourselves in a situation where we had completely
uprooted an authoritarian government and would need to freeze the
situation: retain control, retain order, provide security, seal the
borders to keep terrorists from coming in.
...

Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy
Army deputy chief of staff for intelligence, 1997-2000

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the beginning, i was asked which side I took, Shinseki's or
">

Rumsfeld's. And I said Shinseki. I mean, Rumsfeld proudly announced
that he had told General Franks to fight this war with different
tactics in which they would bypass enemy strongholds and enemy
resistance and keep on moving. But it was shocking to me that the
secretary of defense would tell the Army how to fight. He doesn't know
how to fight; he has no business telling them. To me, it was
astonishing that Rumsfeld would presume to tell four-star generals, in
the Army thirty-five years, how to do their jobs.
...

Gen. Wesley Clark
NATO supreme Allied commander for Europe, 1997-2000
Troop strength was not the only problem. We got into this mess because
the Bush administration decided what they really wanted to do was to
invade Iraq, and then the only question was, for what reason? They
developed two or three different reasons. It wasn't until the last
minute that they came up and said, &quot;Hey, by the way, we are going to
create a wave of democracy across the Middle East.&quot; That was February
of 2003, and by that time they hadn't planned anything. In October of
2003, Donald Rumsfeld wrote a memo asking questions that should have
been asked in 2001: Do we have an overall strategy to win the war on
terror? Do we have the right organization to win the war on terror?
How are we going to know if we are not winning the war on terror? As
it has turned out, the guys on the ground are doing what they are told
to do. But let's ask this question: Have you seen an American
strategic blunder this large? The answer is: not in fifty years. I
can't imagine when the last one was. And it's not just about troop
strength. I mean, you will fail if you don't have enough troops, but
simply adding troops won't make you succeed.

Adm. William Crowe
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1985-89
...
A State Department study advising otherwise was sent to Rumsfeld, but
he threw it in the wastebasket. He overrode the military and was just
plain stubborn on numbers. Finally the military said OK, and they
totally underestimated the impact the desert had on our equipment and
the kind of troops we would need for peacekeeping. They ignored
Shinseki. The Marines were advising the same way. But the military can
only go so far. Once the civilian leadership decides otherwise, the
military is obliged.

Bush is the Commander in Chief. It is his job, and his ALONE. to hire (and
fire) competent military leaders. To do this, he must be able to measure
their effectiveness at doing their jobs. Based on the conduct of the war to
date, Bush has utterly failed to execute his duties as C in C with even a
modicum of competence.

And to use your analogy, if your mechanic does a piss-poor job, it's time to
look for a new one. And if you try a string of mechanics and they all do a
poor job, it's time to consider changing your method of finding mechanics.
Or maybe it's time to ditch your car.

That is false,completely.  Rumsfield (head of the department) was
totally with the President on that.  The strategies they had for the

by Bush.  Bush only greenlit the one we used.  You MUST know that.

&gt; Bush is the Commander in Chief. It is his job, and his ALONE. to hire (and
&gt; fire) competent military leaders. To do this, he must be able to measure
&gt; their effectiveness at doing their jobs. Based on the conduct of the war to
&gt; date, Bush has utterly failed to execute his duties as C in C with even a
&gt; modicum of competence.

&gt; And to use your analogy, if your mechanic does a piss-poor job, it's time to
&gt; look for a new one. And if you try a string of mechanics and they all do a
&gt; poor job, it's time to consider changing your method of finding mechanics.
&gt; Or maybe it's time to ditch your car.
">

Or at least wonder why veteran mechanics quit their jobs rather than
working on your car.

Yes, the Pentagon will come up with plans at the President's request.

It's up to the &quot;Decider&quot; to tell them what they want done, and
to accept or reject the results.

Tell me again why so many generals, at the peak of their careers,
chose to leave their jobs rather than participate?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;When your car breaks down, you don't tell the mechanic you know

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;operate.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When you have terminal inoperable cancer and you demand that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; doctor operate anyway as best he can, you get a situation like we have
&gt; &gt; &gt; now.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;However, Democrats think that politicians (experts at

&gt; &gt; &gt; Experts at determining political goals that are supported by &quot;we the
&gt; &gt; &gt; people&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;know better how to win a war than trained military commanders.  How is that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The military commanders don't know how to win this war.  Like the rest
&gt; &gt; &gt; of us, they cannot identify the conditions that would constitute
&gt; &gt; &gt; victory.  All they know is how to best use the military resources (the
&gt; &gt; &gt; lives of American soldiers and the treasure of America's present and
&gt; &gt; &gt; future taxpayers) to TRY to achieve the goals set by the Commander in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chief.

&gt; &gt; &gt; lojbab

&gt; &gt; Yet, you admit it IS their strategy..not Bush's..that you condemn.  A
&gt; &gt; second ago, you were telling me (on another thread) that the military
&gt; &gt; would make plans for attack under any President (even a Democrat).
&gt; &gt; Now, you are blaming Bush for their decisions.  Make up your mind.

&gt; Yes, the Pentagon will come up with plans at the President's request.

&gt; It's up to the &quot;Decider&quot; to tell them what they want done, and
&gt; to accept or reject the results.

&gt; Tell me again why so many generals, at the peak of their careers,
&gt; chose to leave their jobs rather than participate?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A lot of people have been saying Bush is wrong about how he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fighting the war.  However, to my knowledge, Bush hasn't, actually,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planned even ONE military strategy.  He keeps going to the generals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do.  In fact,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even the troop surge plan was a suggestion of the commanders.  So,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you are saying the war is being fought in a wrong way, you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not saying that BUSH is wrong.  You are saying that ALL of the top
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; staff at the Pentagon is wrong and the commanders on the ground in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Iraq.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When your car breaks down, you don't tell the mechanic you know

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kenneth Clifton

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ken said:  &quot;He keeps going to the generals

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you recall, he was advised NOT to invade Iraq. He did it anyway.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, he is the Commander in Chief. He can do what he wants regardless
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the advice he gets.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you think Powell and countless others are not in this Administration
&gt; &gt; &gt; anymore? Because they don't agree with the President.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether they were fired or resigned, they thought it was a failed policy.

&gt; &gt; That is false,completely.

&gt; What is false, that Powell left?  Than an unprecedented number
&gt; of generals took early retirement rather than participate?
&gt; Sounds verifiable to me.

&gt; &gt; Rumsfield (head of the department) was totally with the President on that.

&gt; And Rumsfeld was already notorious for running roughshod over
&gt; the recommendations of the brass BEFORE all this came along.
&gt; And he didn't get any better later.

&gt; &gt; The strategies they had for the
&gt; &gt; initial attack were prepared at the Pentagon by military leaders, not
&gt; &gt; by Bush.

&gt; What, they just knocked on the White House door one day?  &quot;Surprise, we
&gt; think we've come up with a plan for invading Iraq?.  Didn't
&gt; see that one coming, did you?&quot;

&gt; They did as they were told to do.  They did not have to think that
&gt; the goal was a good idea, they did not even have to think that
&gt; the goal was feasible.  They had to do as they were told, or,
&gt; if they thought the request unconscionable, to get out.

&gt; An unprecedented number got out.

&gt; &gt; Bush only greenlit the one we used.  You MUST know that.
&gt; &gt; So, you are being intentionally deceptive.

&gt; It's rather striking how often you confuse someone else's
&gt; superior grasp of any given topic with dupliclity.

So, you admit the plans you are condemning here were Pentagon plans,
not Bush plans.  Why do you trust politicians for running a war more
than military leaders with experience?

&gt; Kenneth Clifton
&gt; -author of The Christian Superhero Training Guide http://www.christiansuperhero.com

There is NO strategy for victory.

You are correct in this, that the Democrats have NO
strategy for victory but they win by default
because by accident they have hit upon the one
and only CORRECT strategy which is IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL.

After 5 years, al Quaeda is stronger, not weaker, and their
major path of infiltration into the United States,
the MEXICAN border, remains nearly WIDE open
as BOTH congress and Bush, BOTH demos and repubs
of the neo-con variety, stall and blather about
the need for a guest worker program while
delaying the implementation of the border
fence which they have approved
but have not fully funded.

A failed strategy is a failed strategy - the internecine strife,
racial and religious hatreds in Iraq will NOT be solved
by any kind of Democratic government but WILL BE
exploited by al Quaeda and other terrorist groups.

We are spending 12 billion dollars a month that could
have been used for invading Pakistan and
flushing out the real al Quaeda leaders,
showing them that there would
be NO SAFE PLACE on the planet to hide.

All Bush and his demo and repub supporters do is continue
to repeat themselves over and over again that the
war is working if ONLY we are patient and keep
waiting - EXACTLY as we were told during the
Vietnam quagmire.

The REASONING they give for this seems
to change every few months.
First it was to find WMD,
then it was to stop the terrorists over
there before they came over here,
then it was to demoralize the terrorists
by creating a democratic government
in Iraq.  I'm not sure what the latest
line of bullshit is, something like
le'ts wait for the surge to work.

Your reliance on the supposed &quot;experts&quot; in the Pentagon
is foolhardy.  They are dominated by the same kind
of obsolete leadership which once lead the entire
country of France into captivity when their &quot;experts&quot;
assured everyone that the Maginot line was
unassailable and impregnable.

We are doomed to failure after failure until
the &quot;experts&quot; modernize our fighting forces
which entails massive philosophical,
logistical and organizational changes
in the transition from the World War ll
style large standing armies to the
highly automated, mechanized and
roboticized forces needed for the wars
of the future.

These changes will NOT be undertaken
by a birdbrain who flew a jet onto an air craft
carrier, proudly asserted &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;
and then continued to back a failed secretary
of Defense until he was practically
FORCED to make him resign.
This is the same birdbrain who
speaks with the phony Texas
accent, pretends he can't pronounce
the word &quot;nuclear&quot; properly
(that is, one HOPES that
he is pretending)
and continued reading nursery rhymes
after being informed of the attack
on the world trade center.

No sir, the is NO Victory in this scenario.
no matter if the leadership
is democrat or republican.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A lot of people have been saying Bush is wrong about how he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fighting the war.  However, to my knowledge, Bush hasn't, actually,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planned even ONE military strategy.  He keeps going to the generals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do.  In fact,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even the troop surge plan was a suggestion of the commanders.  So,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you are saying the war is being fought in a wrong way, you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not saying that BUSH is wrong.  You are saying that ALL of the top
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; staff at the Pentagon is wrong and the commanders on the ground in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Iraq.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When your car breaks down, you don't tell the mechanic you know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better.  When you are facing surgery, you don't tell the doctor how to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operate.  However, Democrats think that politicians (experts at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deception and speeches) know better how to win a war than trained
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; military commanders.  How is that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kenneth Clifton

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ken said:  &quot;He keeps going to the generals

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you recall, he was advised NOT to invade Iraq. He did it anyway.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, he is the Commander in Chief. He can do what he wants regardless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the advice he gets.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you think Powell and countless others are not in this Administration
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anymore? Because they don't agree with the President.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether they were fired or resigned, they thought it was a failed policy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is false,completely.

&gt; &gt; What is false, that Powell left?  Than an unprecedented number
&gt; &gt; of generals took early retirement rather than participate?
&gt; &gt; Sounds verifiable to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Rumsfield (head of the department) was totally with the President on that.

&gt; &gt; And Rumsfeld was already notorious for running roughshod over
&gt; &gt; the recommendations of the brass BEFORE all this came along.
&gt; &gt; And he didn't get any better later.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The strategies they had for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; initial attack were prepared at the Pentagon by military leaders, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; by Bush.

&gt; &gt; What, they just knocked on the White House door one day?  &quot;Surprise, we
&gt; &gt; think we've come up with a plan for invading Iraq?.  Didn't
&gt; &gt; see that one coming, did you?&quot;

&gt; &gt; They did as they were told to do.  They did not have to think that
&gt; &gt; the goal was a good idea, they did not even have to think that
&gt; &gt; the goal was feasible.  They had to do as they were told, or,
&gt; &gt; if they thought the request unconscionable, to get out.

&gt; &gt; An unprecedented number got out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Bush only greenlit the one we used.  You MUST know that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, you are being intentionally deceptive.

&gt; &gt; It's rather striking how often you confuse someone else's
&gt; &gt; superior grasp of any given topic with dupliclity.

&gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; So, you admit the plans you are condemning here were Pentagon plans,
">

If you get it into your head that you want to take a dive
off a ten-story building, it's not your choice of which
elevator to take up that I would be condemning.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki to Congress, told Donald Rumsfeld, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told Bush that the war in Iraq would &quot;require several hundred thousand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troops and over a decade.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not only was Shinseki ignored, he was ridiculed and fired.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since when has Bush followed the advice of the experts?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He keeps going to the generals

The who?  I thought you had said &quot;Senator Levin&quot;
Levin IS the DNC?

In any event, let's play &quot;Spot the attack!&quot;

N. LEVIN: General Shinseki, could you give us some idea as to the
magnitude of the Army's force requirement for an occupation of Iraq
following a successful completion of the war?

GEN. SHINSEKI: In specific numbers, I would have to rely on combatant
commanders' exact requirements. But I think --

SEN. LEVIN: How about a range?

GEN. SHINSEKI: I would say that what's been mobilized to this point --
something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers are
probably, you know, a figure that would be required. We're talking
about post- hostilities control over a piece of geography that's fairly
significant, with the kinds of ethnic tensions that could lead to other
problems. And so it takes a significant ground- force presence to
maintain a safe and secure environment, to ensure that people are fed,
that water is distributed, all the normal responsibilities that go
along with administering a situation like this.

--------------

Reached after the Senate hearing, Levin said Shinseki's estimate of an
occupation force was &quot;very sobering and I would hope the American
public would have the opportunity to read that testimony.&quot;

OK, you go first:

Re: A lot of people have been saying Bush is wrong about how he is

planned even ONE military strategy.  He keeps going to the generals
and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do.  In fact,
even the troop surge plan was a suggestion of the commanders.

This is what Bush has often said, but it is NOT true. Bush has
selected the commanders, generally selecting them on the basis of
whether their views on the war are similar to his. For example,
General George Casey, who was the commander in Iraq before General
Petreus, was opposed to the surge. Petreus was selected because he
suggested a way to continue the war. It was not Petreus who convinced
Bush to continue the war.

And also opposed to the surge was former Secretary of Defense
Rumsfeld, who in his last memo of many recommendations to the White
House (leaked in December) included:

&quot;¶Retain high-end SOF capability and necessary support structure to
target Al Qaeda, death squads, and Iranians in Iraq, while drawing
down all other Coalition forces, except those necessary to provide
certain key enablers for the ISF.&quot; (&quot;Drawing down&quot; means reducing
troops, not increasing them.)

and

&quot;¶Withdraw U.S. forces from vulnerable positions - cities, patrolling,
etc. - and move U.S. forces to a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) status,
operating from within Iraq and Kuwait, to be available when Iraqi
security forces need assistance.&quot; (That means NOT putting troops into
Baghdad.

And some top generals have been critical while on the job for example:
&quot;... commanders have grown increasingly alarmed about the burden of
long deployments and the military's ability to handle a variety of
threats around the world simultaneously. Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, the
Army's chief of staff, warned Congress last week that the active-duty
Army &quot;will break&quot; under the strain of today's war-zone rotations.&quot;

And apparently the Joint Chiefs of Staff were originally opposed to
the surge idea.

Bob has it 100% correct.

There is NO victory.

And the inability of the President to formulate to a concrete
goal can be seen in the administration's constantly
changing rationalizations which are &quot;updated&quot; every
few months as circumstances change.   First, the goal
was to find and dismantle the &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;.
When that goal, eventually, proved illusory the
plan became to &quot;stop the terrorists there before they
came here.   That the Mexican border was wide
open to any terrorist on the planet was apparently
not a consideration in this goal.   Then the &quot;goal&quot;
became the establishment of a democratic government
in Iraq and to wait until the Iraq army was ready to
handle things themselves.   That was part of the
&quot;plan&quot; in Vietnam too and ignored the
violence and ruthlessness of the several
factions in Iraq (not to mention al Quaeda)
whose historical hatreds allow for
the killing of tens of thousands of innocents,
even while praying in their most sacred
places.

The &quot;president&quot; is incompetent and arrogant -
a bad combination easily exploited by
American's enemies and by defense contractors.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A lot of people have been saying Bush is wrong about how he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fighting the war.  However, to my knowledge, Bush hasn't, actually,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planned even ONE military strategy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki to Congress, told Donald Rumsfeld, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told Bush that the war in Iraq would &quot;require several hundred thousand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troops and over a decade.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not only was Shinseki ignored, he was ridiculed and fired.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since when has Bush followed the advice of the experts?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He keeps going to the generals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do.  In fact,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even the troop surge plan was a suggestion of the commanders.  So,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you are saying the war is being fought in a wrong way, you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not saying that BUSH is wrong.  You are saying that ALL of the top
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; staff at the Pentagon is wrong and the commanders on the ground in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Iraq.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When your car breaks down, you don't tell the mechanic you know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better.  When you are facing surgery, you don't tell the doctor how to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operate.  However, Democrats think that politicians (experts at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deception and speeches) know better how to win a war than trained
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; military commanders.  How is that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.christiansuperhero.com

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was the Democrats that attacked him...remember?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul Wolfowitz was a DEMOCRAT?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whoa!  Say it isn't so!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What Congressmen were behind the attack?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your claim; you tell me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may list them here:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senator Levin to start with.  Though I want to take this moment to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emphasize something.  YOU didn't have proof the attacks were from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GOP before launching into the lie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What lie?  That Wolfowitz attacked Shinseki?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Doesn't seem like a lie to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Must have been some other lie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly quote my lie here:

&gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; See.  Distraction attempt above to cover for having said the President

&gt; Where did I say that Bush attacked Shinseki?

&gt; quote here, if you will:

&gt; &gt; and GOP attacked him for his testimony,

&gt; Where did I say that &quot;the GOP&quot; attacked Shinseki:

&gt; Here, if you will be so kind:

&gt; &gt; when in fact it was the DNC that attacked him.

&gt; The who?  I thought you had said &quot;Senator Levin&quot;
&gt; Levin IS the DNC?

&gt; In any event, let's play &quot;Spot the attack!&quot;

&gt;     N. LEVIN: General Shinseki, could you give us some idea as to the
&gt;     magnitude of the Army's force requirement for an occupation of Iraq
&gt;     following a successful completion of the war?

&gt;     GEN. SHINSEKI: In specific numbers, I would have to rely on combatant
&gt;     commanders' exact requirements. But I think --

&gt;     SEN. LEVIN: How about a range?

&gt;     GEN. SHINSEKI: I would say that what's been mobilized to this point --
&gt;     something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers are
&gt;     probably, you know, a figure that would be required. We're talking
&gt;     about post- hostilities control over a piece of geography that's fairly
&gt;     significant, with the kinds of ethnic tensions that could lead to other
&gt;     problems. And so it takes a significant ground- force presence to
&gt;     maintain a safe and secure environment, to ensure that people are fed,
&gt;     that water is distributed, all the normal responsibilities that go
&gt;     along with administering a situation like this.

&gt; --------------

&gt;     Reached after the Senate hearing, Levin said Shinseki's estimate of an
&gt;     occupation force was &quot;very sobering and I would hope the American
&gt;     public would have the opportunity to read that testimony.&quot;

&gt; OK, you go first:

&gt; -- cary

I won't let you distract.  Answer the question you keep ducking.  Why
do you trust politicians to plan a war more than career military
commanders?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kenneth Clifton

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ken said:  &quot;He keeps going to the generals

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you recall, he was advised NOT to invade Iraq. He did it anyway.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, he is the Commander in Chief. He can do what he wants regardless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the advice he gets.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you think Powell and countless others are not in this Administration
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anymore? Because they don't agree with the President.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether they were fired or resigned, they thought it was a failed policy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is false,completely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What is false, that Powell left?  Than an unprecedented number
&gt; &gt; &gt; of generals took early retirement rather than participate?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds verifiable to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rumsfield (head of the department) was totally with the President on that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And Rumsfeld was already notorious for running roughshod over
&gt; &gt; &gt; the recommendations of the brass BEFORE all this came along.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And he didn't get any better later.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The strategies they had for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial attack were prepared at the Pentagon by military leaders, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by Bush.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What, they just knocked on the White House door one day?  &quot;Surprise, we
&gt; &gt; &gt; think we've come up with a plan for invading Iraq?.  Didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; see that one coming, did you?&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; They did as they were told to do.  They did not have to think that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the goal was a good idea, they did not even have to think that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the goal was feasible.  They had to do as they were told, or,
&gt; &gt; &gt; if they thought the request unconscionable, to get out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; An unprecedented number got out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bush only greenlit the one we used.  You MUST know that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, you are being intentionally deceptive.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's rather striking how often you confuse someone else's
&gt; &gt; &gt; superior grasp of any given topic with dupliclity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; So, you admit the plans you are condemning here were Pentagon plans,

&gt; If you get it into your head that you want to take a dive
&gt; off a ten-story building, it's not your choice of which
&gt; elevator to take up that I would be condemning.

&gt; -- cary

&gt; -- cary

Why do you want to trust politicians with no military training to run
a war instead of career military commanders?

Because a politician, the president
of the United States, is given the power of
COMMANDER IN CHIEF of the armed forces.

Should that president prove to be inept, as is the
current one, then it all the more behooves us
to take care when electing them.

As for your Pentagon experts, are these the same
kinds of experts that ignored or
misinterpreted numerous warnings
before Pearl Harbor, 9-11, the Tet Offensive,
the bombing of the marine barracks?

Are these the same experts who have looked
the other way as our defense companies
with outsourcings and H1B hiring of foreigners
have allowed our most precious and expensive
military technology to leak away to future
enemies.   Are THESE the experts
in which you place such great faith?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The military commanders don't know how to win this war.  Like the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lives of American soldiers and the treasure of America's present and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; future taxpayers) to TRY to achieve the goals set by the Commander in

&gt;&gt; &gt;Yet, you admit it IS their strategy..not Bush's..that you condemn.

&gt;&gt; It is Bush's non-goal that I condemn.  The strategy is useless unless
&gt;&gt; it can achieve a worthwhile goal.  It can't.

&gt;&gt; &gt;A second ago, you were telling me (on another thread) that the military
&gt;&gt; &gt;would make plans for attack under any President (even a Democrat).
&gt;&gt; &gt;Now, you are blaming Bush for their decisions.  Make up your mind.

&gt;&gt; The military makes plans.  The president decides which plans are to be
&gt;&gt; implemented, and towards what goals.  Plans are harmless without the
&gt;&gt; decision.  The decision leads to good soldiers dying, in this case for
&gt;&gt; a goal that is not achievable by any sort of plan, in part because the
&gt;&gt; president cannot communicate any concrete goal.

&gt;&gt; lojbab

&gt; Bob has it 100% correct.

&gt; There is NO victory.

&gt; And the inability of the President to formulate to a concrete
&gt; goal can be seen in the administration's constantly
&gt; changing rationalizations which are &quot;updated&quot; every
&gt; few months as circumstances change.   First, the goal
&gt; was to find and dismantle the &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;.
&gt; When that goal, eventually, proved illusory the
&gt; plan became to &quot;stop the terrorists there before they
&gt; came here.   That the Mexican border was wide
&gt; open to any terrorist on the planet was apparently
&gt; not a consideration in this goal.   Then the &quot;goal&quot;
&gt; became the establishment of a democratic government
&gt; in Iraq and to wait until the Iraq army was ready to
&gt; handle things themselves.   That was part of the
&gt; &quot;plan&quot; in Vietnam too and ignored the
&gt; violence and ruthlessness of the several
&gt; factions in Iraq (not to mention al Quaeda)
&gt; whose historical hatreds allow for
&gt; the killing of tens of thousands of innocents,
&gt; even while praying in their most sacred
&gt; places.

&gt; The &quot;president&quot; is incompetent and arrogant -
&gt; a bad combination easily exploited by
&gt; American's enemies and by defense contractors.

.. but to people like WildEyedWonder Bush is god on earth, because
they're even *MORE* incompetent and arrogant than he is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A lot of people have been saying Bush is wrong about how he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fighting the war.  However, to my knowledge, Bush hasn't, actually,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planned even ONE military strategy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki to Congress, told Donald Rumsfeld, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told Bush that the war in Iraq would &quot;require several hundred thousand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troops and over a decade.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not only was Shinseki ignored, he was ridiculed and fired.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since when has Bush followed the advice of the experts?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He keeps going to the generals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do.  In fact,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even the troop surge plan was a suggestion of the commanders.  So,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you are saying the war is being fought in a wrong way, you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not saying that BUSH is wrong.  You are saying that ALL of the top
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; staff at the Pentagon is wrong and the commanders on the ground in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Iraq.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When your car breaks down, you don't tell the mechanic you know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better.  When you are facing surgery, you don't tell the doctor how to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operate.  However, Democrats think that politicians (experts at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deception and speeches) know better how to win a war than trained
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; military commanders.  How is that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul Wolfowitz was a DEMOCRAT?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whoa!  Say it isn't so!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What Congressmen were behind the attack?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your claim; you tell me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may list them here:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senator Levin to start with.  Though I want to take this moment to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emphasize something.  YOU didn't have proof the attacks were from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GOP before launching into the lie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What lie?  That Wolfowitz attacked Shinseki?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doesn't seem like a lie to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Must have been some other lie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly quote my lie here:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See.  Distraction attempt above to cover for having said the President

&gt; &gt; &gt; Where did I say that Bush attacked Shinseki?

&gt; &gt; &gt; quote here, if you will:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and GOP attacked him for his testimony,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Where did I say that &quot;the GOP&quot; attacked Shinseki:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here, if you will be so kind:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when in fact it was the DNC that attacked him.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The who?  I thought you had said &quot;Senator Levin&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Levin IS the DNC?

&gt; &gt; &gt; In any event, let's play &quot;Spot the attack!&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;     N. LEVIN: General Shinseki, could you give us some idea as to the
&gt; &gt; &gt;     magnitude of the Army's force requirement for an occupation of Iraq
&gt; &gt; &gt;     following a successful completion of the war?

&gt; &gt; &gt;     GEN. SHINSEKI: In specific numbers, I would have to rely on combatant
&gt; &gt; &gt;     commanders' exact requirements. But I think --

&gt; &gt; &gt;     SEN. LEVIN: How about a range?

&gt; &gt; &gt;     GEN. SHINSEKI: I would say that what's been mobilized to this point --
&gt; &gt; &gt;     something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers are
&gt; &gt; &gt;     probably, you know, a figure that would be required. We're talking
&gt; &gt; &gt;     about post- hostilities control over a piece of geography that's fairly
&gt; &gt; &gt;     significant, with the kinds of ethnic tensions that could lead to other
&gt; &gt; &gt;     problems. And so it takes a significant ground- force presence to
&gt; &gt; &gt;     maintain a safe and secure environment, to ensure that people are fed,
&gt; &gt; &gt;     that water is distributed, all the normal responsibilities that go
&gt; &gt; &gt;     along with administering a situation like this.

&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------

&gt; &gt; &gt;     Reached after the Senate hearing, Levin said Shinseki's estimate of an
&gt; &gt; &gt;     occupation force was &quot;very sobering and I would hope the American
&gt; &gt; &gt;     public would have the opportunity to read that testimony.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, you go first:

&gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; I won't let you distract.  Answer the question you keep ducking.  Why
&gt; &gt; do you trust politicians to plan a war more than career military
&gt; &gt; commanders?

&gt; &gt; Kenneth Clifton
&gt; &gt; christiansuperhero.com

&gt; Because a politician, the president
&gt; of the United States, is given the power of
&gt; COMMANDER IN CHIEF of the armed forces.

&gt; Should that president prove to be inept, as is the
&gt; current one, then it all the more behooves us
&gt; to take care when electing them.

&gt; As for your Pentagon experts, are these the same
&gt; kinds of experts that ignored or
&gt; misinterpreted numerous warnings
&gt; before Pearl Harbor, 9-11, the Tet Offensive,
&gt; the bombing of the marine barracks?

&gt; Are these the same experts who have looked
&gt; the other way as our defense companies
&gt; with outsourcings and H1B hiring of foreigners
&gt; have allowed our most precious and expensive
&gt; military technology to leak away to future
&gt; enemies.   Are THESE the experts
&gt; in which you place such great faith?

This goes back to my main point.  Your beef, then, your objection is
with how the Pentagon (the experts) say the war would best be won.  As
with the doctor operating on you, they may be wrong, but who are you
to object?  Do you (or a politician) have more training to run a war?

&gt; with the doctor operating on you, they may be wrong, but who are you
&gt; to object?  Do you (or a politician) have more training to run a war?

Your funadmental misconception is that this
war has some useful purpose and if only
the right military leadership is found,
it can be &quot;won&quot; (whatever that means).

My conception is not only mistrust
of the President and the Pentagon
&quot;experts&quot; but also a complete
denial of the idea that the war
serves any useful purpose at all.

You have no comments at all
about the leakage of valuable
defense technologies
to foreign government??

You have no comments at
all on the open border
with Mexico providing
a &quot;terrorists welcome&quot;
sign to anyone who cares
to sneak across??

Curious.

Sorry, but you're wrong. The Whitehouse decides what they want to do,
then find someone in the defense department who will go along. It is
well known that the Bush administration cherry picks intelligence and
military advice.

No he isn't.  He ... and I ... are condemning Bush for
putting the brass in a lose/lose situation.   Either
quit your career, or try to come up with a plan to meet impossible
goals.

Or, more tellingly, lack of goals, beyond &quot;Get Saddam&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planned even ONE military strategy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki to Congress, told Donald Rumsfeld, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told Bush that the war in Iraq would &quot;require several hundred thousand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troops and over a decade.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not only was Shinseki ignored, he was ridiculed and fired.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since when has Bush followed the advice of the experts?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He keeps going to the generals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do.  In fact,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even the troop surge plan was a suggestion of the commanders.  So,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you are saying the war is being fought in a wrong way, you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not saying that BUSH is wrong.  You are saying that ALL of the top
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; staff at the Pentagon is wrong and the commanders on the ground in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Iraq.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When your car breaks down, you don't tell the mechanic you know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better.  When you are facing surgery, you don't tell the doctor how to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operate.  However, Democrats think that politicians (experts at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deception and speeches) know better how to win a war than trained
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; military commanders.  How is that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was the Democrats that attacked him...remember?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul Wolfowitz was a DEMOCRAT?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whoa!  Say it isn't so!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What Congressmen were behind the attack?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your claim; you tell me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may list them here:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senator Levin to start with.  Though I want to take this moment to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emphasize something.  YOU didn't have proof the attacks were from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GOP before launching into the lie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What lie?  That Wolfowitz attacked Shinseki?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doesn't seem like a lie to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Must have been some other lie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly quote my lie here:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; See.  Distraction attempt above to cover for having said the President

&gt; &gt; Where did I say that Bush attacked Shinseki?

&gt; &gt; quote here, if you will:

&gt; &gt; &gt; and GOP attacked him for his testimony,

&gt; &gt; Where did I say that &quot;the GOP&quot; attacked Shinseki:

&gt; &gt; Here, if you will be so kind:

&gt; &gt; &gt; when in fact it was the DNC that attacked him.

&gt; &gt; The who?  I thought you had said &quot;Senator Levin&quot;
&gt; &gt; Levin IS the DNC?

&gt; &gt; In any event, let's play &quot;Spot the attack!&quot;

&gt; &gt;     N. LEVIN: General Shinseki, could you give us some idea as to the
&gt; &gt;     magnitude of the Army's force requirement for an occupation of Iraq
&gt; &gt;     following a successful completion of the war?

&gt; &gt;     GEN. SHINSEKI: In specific numbers, I would have to rely on combatant
&gt; &gt;     commanders' exact requirements. But I think --

&gt; &gt;     SEN. LEVIN: How about a range?

&gt; &gt;     GEN. SHINSEKI: I would say that what's been mobilized to this point --
&gt; &gt;     something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers are
&gt; &gt;     probably, you know, a figure that would be required. We're talking
&gt; &gt;     about post- hostilities control over a piece of geography that's fairly
&gt; &gt;     significant, with the kinds of ethnic tensions that could lead to other
&gt; &gt;     problems. And so it takes a significant ground- force presence to
&gt; &gt;     maintain a safe and secure environment, to ensure that people are fed,
&gt; &gt;     that water is distributed, all the normal responsibilities that go
&gt; &gt;     along with administering a situation like this.

&gt; &gt; --------------

&gt; &gt;     Reached after the Senate hearing, Levin said Shinseki's estimate of an
&gt; &gt;     occupation force was &quot;very sobering and I would hope the American
&gt; &gt;     public would have the opportunity to read that testimony.&quot;

&gt; &gt; OK, you go first:

&gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; I won't let you distract.
">

Speaking of attempts to distract, where is that Democratic
attack on Shinseki again?  I'm havins some real trouble
coming up with evidence for it.

But you clearly said that &quot;It was the Democrats that attacked
him...remember?&quot;, and since I'm just SURE you didn't just
make that up, I'd really like to see some documentation.

Here would be nice:

You know, Clifton, I'm really, REALLY sick of your putting

be able to; this is a pure example of your leaping to
a conclusion like Wile E. Coyote sadly strapping on the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; military commanders.  How is that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kenneth Clifton

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ken said:  &quot;He keeps going to the generals

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Defense department and doing what THEY told him to do&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you recall, he was advised NOT to invade Iraq. He did it anyway.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, he is the Commander in Chief. He can do what he wants regardless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the advice he gets.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you think Powell and countless others are not in this Administration
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anymore? Because they don't agree with the President.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether they were fired or resigned, they thought it was a failed policy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is false,completely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is false, that Powell left?  Than an unprecedented number
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of generals took early retirement rather than participate?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds verifiable to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rumsfield (head of the department) was totally with the President on that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And Rumsfeld was already notorious for running roughshod over
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the recommendations of the brass BEFORE all this came along.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And he didn't get any better later.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The strategies they had for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial attack were prepared at the Pentagon by military leaders, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by Bush.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What, they just knocked on the White House door one day?  &quot;Surprise, we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think we've come up with a plan for invading Iraq?.  Didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see that one coming, did you?&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They did as they were told to do.  They did not have to think that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the goal was a good idea, they did not even have to think that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the goal was feasible.  They had to do as they were told, or,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if they thought the request unconscionable, to get out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An unprecedented number got out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bush only greenlit the one we used.  You MUST know that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, you are being intentionally deceptive.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's rather striking how often you confuse someone else's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superior grasp of any given topic with dupliclity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, you admit the plans you are condemning here were Pentagon plans,

&gt; &gt; If you get it into your head that you want to take a dive
&gt; &gt; off a ten-story building, it's not your choice of which
&gt; &gt; elevator to take up that I would be condemning.

&gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; &gt; -- cary

&gt; Why do you want to trust politicians with no military training to run
&gt; a war instead of career military commanders?
