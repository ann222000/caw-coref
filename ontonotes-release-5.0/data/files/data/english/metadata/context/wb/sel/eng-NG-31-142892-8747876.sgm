I'm starting a video blog about a little magic experiment I'm doing. I
implanted a magnet into my hand, and we are going to see how it heals
up, and what the complications are if any. All I did to get it
implanted was touch a lit cigarette to the flesh of my skin, and it
boiled up really fast. I cut a little hole big enough to slide the
magnet through, and stuck it in looking at a mirror.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqE4xY-T1U0

The whole experiment makes me wonder about smoke and mirrors. Kind of
reminds me of someone preforming surgery on themselves. Burn a wound
shut, and stitch it up looking in a mirror. Something like that.

I also have been playing with a half silvered mirror:

I got some other videos too.

I don't think it will buzz off airport security anymore than the
zipper on my jeans does, and yes I have been thinking about cutting
myself open again.  If this works out, I'm going to need a few more
magnets in my hands, and from there who knows where it will go.  Some
people believe there are healing powers in crystals, and I've heard
tell of implanting gems into the body.  The Egyptians did it.  I've
seen the prestige &amp; I also saw this cool youtube video of a guy with
an alien implant.  The thing looked like a bullet lodged in his arm,
and he could move it around under his skin.

That is freaky. I was just having a talk and comparing the &quot;Prestige&quot;
with &quot;The Illusionist&quot; last night. I say &quot;Prestige&quot; Hands down.

I was going to post and ask others which they preferred but the debate
got quite heated and I had to throw some punches. Sucks when the
person you were debating with is yourself. I throw a mean sucker
punch.

Magnets wipe out info on disks though, don't they? What if they wipe
your memory out? Or, what if you get stuck to the refrigerator and all
you become good for is holding the family pictures and To Do notes on
it?

When I had an IUD I always wondered if I would set security off. I
thought how the hell would I remove that and throw it in the tray?

Corey

it seems obvious that you want to be a STAGE magician

this mutilatin is what they refer to in the prestige as &quot;getting your
hands dirty&quot;

ie - you are applying everyday common as mud science [magnetism] to
decieve people hiding the magnet via self mutilation

fair enough...

the next step would be to corectly view mentalism for what it is -
also a stage magic entertainment catagory

but wicca and magick - the more esotric branches - are not
&quot;entertainment&quot; based

neither are they based on decieving people

wicca to me is akin homeopathy and biodynamics - it is a life science
that works in energy and vibration -

it is not to be manipulated - merely worked in accordance with - as
gravity is

it may &quot;partially&quot; assist a good mentalist on a good day - but it
can't be counted on to apeaze a paying audience looking for
entertainment

as for child recovery - as i have said

where are your uncles? second uncles - grandfathers

at some stage the &quot;boy&quot; needs a male mentor, an uncle/grandfather
figure, its as natural a law as anything wicca is based on

with your native hereitige you'd be better out doing a tracking course
and getting some &quot;real scars&quot; with a mentor who can put you in touch
with yourself

not sittting here scarring  yourself

but maybe the world is changing and humanity is becoming more
androgonus and hiena like

Yeah, well this implant is healing up nicely.  I've been reading about
implants, and  the graphic photos online show deep scars under the
skin, that bleed &amp; get infected with large pieces of metal inserted.
This was just a touch of a lit cigarette to my hand, and I just pushed
a tiny magnet you can only buy through The Great, Wise, &amp; Powerful
Trabucco. There wasn't any blood, and once it heals up, I'm going to
consider upgrading to a larger magnet.  Trabucco's tiny magnet is
designed to be embedded in things, so it is made small.  He also gave
me some a little larger that are 5x more powerful.  If I gauge up to
one of those after the wound heals, my guess is I'll be able to shoot
magnetic quarters out of my hand without even doing the muscle pass.
