The Portrait of an &quot;Green&quot; Olympic Host -- Â Activist held in China
pollution battle

Activist held in China pollution battle

Friday, 03 August, 2007.

A black sedan with dark windows follows Xu Jiehua when she rides her
motorcycle through her village on the shores of Tai lake, China's
third-largest. A policeman sits outside her back door all day; another
waits by the front gate.

It has been this way since her husband, Wu Lihong, one of China's
best-known environmental activists, was arrested in April. He is held at
a nearby police station but his family - who deny the charges - are not
allowed to see him and his lawyer claims he has been tortured.

In her first interview since his arrest, Ms Xu told the Financial Times:
&quot;My husband has used all the family savings to try and protect the lake,
but people just keep on attacking him. Since he was arrested, locals
have told me the chemicals companies now have nothing to be afraid of.&quot;

The case is emblematic of China's confused attitude to solving its
environmental problems. For more than a decade, Mr Wu, 40, was lauded by
the country's leaders as he fought pollution from local chemical plants.

But his family believes his troubles began when he began to agitate
about Yixing, the nearest town, being named a &quot;model city&quot;, a largely
ceremonial award that local officials hoped would show that pollution
was under control.

He was arrested at night a week before he was to travel to Beijing to
complain about the award, and charged with trying to extort $6,000 from
local companies by threatening to expose them.

&quot;There is a growing crackdown on activists, especially at grassroots,&quot;
says Mark Allison, China researcher at Amnesty International. Several
campaigners and lawyers have been arrested or put under house arrest
over the past year.

The police refused to comment on the case, which should have been tried
in June but was postponed after the torture claims.

Beijing has made reducing pollution a priority and Premier Wen Jiabao
ordered an investigation into the contamination of Tai lake. However,
Beijing remains uncomfortable about individual activists.

Since his arrest, the pollution of the lake has got worse. In June,
local authorities turned off tap water for 2m local residents because of
a blue-green algae bloom created by discharge from the chemical plants.

It was the pollution of the lake that drew Mr Wu to the cause. He and
his wife were childhood sweethearts who grew up in a village along the
western banks of Tai lake. They used to swim in its waters.

When the chemicals industry began polluting the lake, he sent anonymous
reports to provincial officials. In 1998, he helped a television crew
make a documentary about pollution in the area.

&quot;For the last decade, our family has not been able to enjoy a peaceful
life,&quot; says Ms Xu, 39.

In her living room are rows of photos of Mr Wu, including one taken in
the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in 2005 when he was feted as one
of China's 10 leading environmentalists.
