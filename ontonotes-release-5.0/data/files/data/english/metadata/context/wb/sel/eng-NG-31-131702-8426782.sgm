[OK.  Call me Captain OT.  Whatever.  I'm having fun and you guys are a good
audience. ;-)]

Six years ago my wife's grandmother, Gladys, decided to leave the house that
she had bought with her late husband Carl in nineteen-fifty-something for
about $6000.00 (no, I did not miss a zero) in favor of a studio in a
retirement community nearby.  Carl had been gone for 25 years and Gladys had
lived alone all that time.

One of the joys of Gladys's life was going to Longs Drugs and buying
whatever item happened to be on sale in quantities too large for a single
elderly woman.  So when she sold her home to my brother-in-law and his wife,
we had a lot of clearing out to do.  The writers of &quot;Friends&quot; (TV Show from
the 90s) hit the nail on the head when Ross found his Noni's secret stash of
Sweet-n-Low and was deluged with little pink packets.  Gladys fit the
profile exactly, except she's still alive. ;-)

We found boxes of 10 year old saltines, Oreos, and cans of vegetables
resting comfortably in an unused bedroom closet.  We collected more packages
of paper towels and toilet paper than you could shake a stick at.  Shoes she
had never worn (and never will wear) seemed to come from some bottomless pit
under the bed in that back bedroom.

But we also found some interesting stuff: a little ukulele brought back from
Hawaii, some of Carl's old cigarette lighters, and a Zenith chairside radio
in full Art Deco glory.  For you radio geeks it's a Zenith 9S244 with a 75
watt amplifier, built in 1939. The wood cabinet is in excellent shape,
though it is missing it's plate glass control panel cover.

The radio was dead, but beautiful and I knew that I would someday have it
repaired.  So I claimed it and we stored it.  The radio moved from town to
town with us, un-repaired, until we landed here in Modesto.  Then it landed
in my garage for 3 and a half more years.  It survived 115 degree (F) heat
waves and actual freezing temperatures.  It survived the demolition of the
old shake and shingle roofs and the installation of the new composite
shingle roof.  It survived numerous adoptions by spiders, a few of them were
black widows.

Finally, in April I took into a funky old shop downtown called Radio
Electronics (of all things).  The guy who runs it, Leroy, is in his 70s and
has only a rudimentary grasp of electronics not related directly to video or
sound production.  The credit card reader is a mystery to him; the
printer/fax/copier is an infernal machine.

The place is a radio geek's heaven.  It's a fire hazard of narrow passage
ways ancient wooden steps, and low ceilinged alcoves festooned with circuit
boards, pegboards, CRT tubes, amp tubes, wires, stereo components in every
stage of disrepair, and wondrous little doo-hickies that light up and find
broadcast signals or read 78s, 45s, 33s, CDs, tapes, and DVDs.

Late last week, we got a call.  The radio was ready and we could come pick
it up.  We were away, they left a message.  They a second message on Monday
morning.  Monday evening, just minutes after coming in off the road and
hearing the messages, the phone rang again.  It was Leroy.  I could tell he
was excited.  He had managed a *complete* repair despite some severe
obstacles, like a warped chassis, deteriorated belts, hardened lubricating
grease, and bent control shafts.

The repair required skill and ingenuity, and the radio was a worthy
recipient of his efforts.  He recreated rivets, he bored out parts of the
chassis to accommodate a slightly longer replacement belt, he ran a tension
wire from one corner of the chassis to another to counter the warping and
make all of the shafts slide inside one another perfectly.  He used small
bits of rubber tire inner tube to replace the old, dried, and hardened
rubber mounting rings.  Genius.

I went down to pick it up today.  Leroy spent an hour explaining the
repairs, the repair process, and showing me how the radio worked.  He was
clearly proud, and I was happy to share the success with him.

When I brought it home and plugged it in, it was magical. The dial and
controls are in the shape of a rounded isosceles triangle with a circular
frequency dial.  On the left corner is the 3 position &quot;On&quot; switch (Off, On
Local, and On Distance).  On the right is the volume control.  On the top is
the 5 position tone control switch; it's almost a notch filter.  Bottom
center is a 3 part concentric switch with which the user chooses the band
(AM, Shortwave, and REALLY Shortwave), turns the dial to fine tune the
radio, and runs a motor driven quick tuner to get around the dial fast.

When you switch bands, the dial face splits in two and the halves slide into
a recesses on either side of the triangle.  When you tune, you can visually
gauge the power of the signal by watching how close to creating a full
circle a little green florescent light appears.

The tone is amazing, it beats the hell out of any AM radio made in the last
30 years.  The 75 watt amp has a lot of power and is pretty transparent.
The Giants never sounded so good losing to &lt;shudder&gt; the Pirates after
dropping two of the last three to &lt;double shudder&gt; the Nats.

The whole thing is a combination of innovative design, good engineering,
genius repair, beautiful sound, hip retro controls, and my good sense to
spent about $300.00 on an old radio.

Now I'm looking into buying or making an antenna suitable to catch some of
the best frequencies on the shortwave band.

I'm telling you all of this because I have discovered the coolest radio
station in existence.  There's a US Dept of standards or something (KAIJ) in
Denver broadcasting the most useful stuff a musician could ever want: an
A=440 tone, a pulse every second, and the time (Greenwich Meantime) every
minute.  Get a shortwave radio and you'll never need a tuner.

Great story Daniel. It reminds me of my first tape recorder which had
the top of a valve (I think) showing, the the partial circle of green
light indicated the record level.

Daniel, that was not at all long.  It was great!  Thanks for sharing.
You did good getting the old beauty to working again.  I have restored
a few of these old radios but not the multibands ones.  They can be a
handful but I have learned that when they drove me crazy, I was in a
hurry and had a lot of other things in want of doing.

Later, I would spend a few hours rewiring it and then quit for a beer,
sit outside a while, and later go back to it.  Then it became fun.

My Heathkit audio amp still works fine.  I built it in 1952...it has
been rebuilt a few times though.

My problem with these old radios is that when I turn them on and the
golden glow of the celluloid dial lights up and I tune in a
station...I don't get &quot;Just Plain Bill&quot; or &quot;Lights Out&quot;...I
get...well...you know what I get.

I have a couple of solutions for this.  I have one of the old 1930
radio cabinets on a shelf in the bar with a couple of good speakers in
it.  I turn it on and the magic eye lights up as does the dial...but
nothing else happens because that is the only things that have power
in it.

Then I turn on my out-of-sight  CD player and it plays through the
speakers in the old cabinet.  And I have a good source of old radio
programs.  I just gave my wife a CD with 115 &quot;Gun Smoke&quot; radio
programs.  I have tons of &quot;Light Crush Dough Boys,&quot; &quot;Harry Richman
Radio Show,&quot; etc.

It does sound funny though when Harry's good voice says, &quot;Fred, I went
by the store the other day to take a look at a real beauty.  Have you
seen the new 1938 Dodge!&quot;

And I have to share this...Matt Dillon says, &quot;I've come for the girl.
Jane, are you OK?  Mister, you can't take someone's daughter to settle
a debt.  Now, don't do anything foolish and try to draw on me....&quot;
Then &quot;BANG!  BANG!  BANG!&quot;  There is a pause and you hear a body
hitting the floor.  Another long pause, and you hear Marshall Dillon:
&quot;Just step over him, Jane.&quot;

Ahhh...radio!

Ken

&gt;&gt;Pirates after dropping two of the last three to &lt;double shudder&gt; the
&gt;&gt;Nats.

&gt;&gt;The whole thing is a combination of innovative design, good
&gt;&gt;engineering, genius repair, beautiful sound, hip retro controls, and
&gt;&gt;my good sense to spent about $300.00 on an old radio.

&gt;&gt;Now I'm looking into buying or making an antenna suitable to catch
&gt;&gt;some of the best frequencies on the shortwave band.

&gt;&gt;I'm telling you all of this because I have discovered the coolest
&gt;&gt;radio station in existence.  There's a US Dept of standards or
&gt;&gt;something (KAIJ) in Denver broadcasting the most useful stuff a
&gt;&gt;musician could ever want: an A=440 tone, a pulse every second, and the
&gt;&gt;time (Greenwich Meantime) every minute.  Get a shortwave radio and
&gt;&gt;you'll never need a tuner. ;-)

&gt;&gt;Daniel

&gt; Daniel, that was not at all long.  It was great!  Thanks for sharing.
&gt; You did good getting the old beauty to working again.  I have restored
&gt; a few of these old radios but not the multibands ones.  They can be a
&gt; handful but I have learned that when they drove me crazy, I was in a
&gt; hurry and had a lot of other things in want of doing.

&gt; Later, I would spend a few hours rewiring it and then quit for a beer,
&gt; sit outside a while, and later go back to it.  Then it became fun.

&gt; My Heathkit audio amp still works fine.  I built it in 1952...it has
&gt; been rebuilt a few times though.

&gt; My problem with these old radios is that when I turn them on and the
&gt; golden glow of the celluloid dial lights up and I tune in a
&gt; station...I don't get &quot;Just Plain Bill&quot; or &quot;Lights Out&quot;...I
&gt; get...well...you know what I get.

&gt; I have a couple of solutions for this.  I have one of the old 1930
&gt; radio cabinets on a shelf in the bar with a couple of good speakers in
&gt; it.  I turn it on and the magic eye lights up as does the dial...but
&gt; nothing else happens because that is the only things that have power
&gt; in it.

&gt; Then I turn on my out-of-sight  CD player and it plays through the
&gt; speakers in the old cabinet.  And I have a good source of old radio
&gt; programs.  I just gave my wife a CD with 115 &quot;Gun Smoke&quot; radio
&gt; programs.  I have tons of &quot;Light Crush Dough Boys,&quot; &quot;Harry Richman
&gt; Radio Show,&quot; etc.

&gt; It does sound funny though when Harry's good voice says, &quot;Fred, I went
&gt; by the store the other day to take a look at a real beauty.  Have you
&gt; seen the new 1938 Dodge!&quot;

&gt; And I have to share this...Matt Dillon says, &quot;I've come for the girl.
&gt; Jane, are you OK?  Mister, you can't take someone's daughter to settle
&gt; a debt.  Now, don't do anything foolish and try to draw on me....&quot;
&gt; Then &quot;BANG!  BANG!  BANG!&quot;  There is a pause and you hear a body
&gt; hitting the floor.  Another long pause, and you hear Marshall Dillon:
&gt; &quot;Just step over him, Jane.&quot;

&gt; Ahhh...radio!

Both interesting posts. Hated to trim them but did want you to find my
words.

Glad you found some interesting things Daniel. I've participated in a
similar archeological dig and found nothing interesting (unfortunately
I'm not a fungiologist).

Ken - don't know why I haven't asked you this before - you of all
people would know. (maybe I have and dis-remember?) What was the show
that Peter Lorre narrated, in which he always sequed into the story
with &quot;...trapped in a living nightmare?&quot; The only actual story I
recall was &quot;the Birds.&quot; Best version ever including the short story,
or so it seems in my memory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Six years ago my wife's grandmother, Gladys, decided to leave the
&gt;&gt;&gt;house that she had bought with her late husband Carl in
&gt;&gt;&gt;nineteen-fifty-something for about $6000.00 (no, I did not miss a
&gt;&gt;&gt;zero) in favor of a studio in a retirement community nearby.  Carl had
&gt;&gt;&gt;been gone for 25 years and Gladys had lived alone all that time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;One of the joys of Gladys's life was going to Longs Drugs and buying
&gt;&gt;&gt;whatever item happened to be on sale in quantities too large for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;single elderly woman.  So when she sold her home to my brother-in-law
&gt;&gt;&gt;and his wife, we had a lot of clearing out to do.  The writers of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Friends&quot; (TV Show from the 90s) hit the nail on the head when Ross
&gt;&gt;&gt;found his Noni's secret stash of Sweet-n-Low and was deluged with
&gt;&gt;&gt;little pink packets.  Gladys fit the profile exactly, except she's
&gt;&gt;&gt;still alive. ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;We found boxes of 10 year old saltines, Oreos, and cans of vegetables
&gt;&gt;&gt;resting comfortably in an unused bedroom closet.  We collected more
&gt;&gt;&gt;packages of paper towels and toilet paper than you could shake a stick
&gt;&gt;&gt;at.  Shoes she had never worn (and never will wear) seemed to come
&gt;&gt;&gt;from some bottomless pit under the bed in that back bedroom.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But we also found some interesting stuff: a little ukulele brought
&gt;&gt;&gt;back from Hawaii, some of Carl's old cigarette lighters, and a Zenith
&gt;&gt;&gt;chairside radio in full Art Deco glory.  For you radio geeks it's a
&gt;&gt;&gt;Zenith 9S244 with a 75 watt amplifier, built in 1939. The wood cabinet
&gt;&gt;&gt;is in excellent shape, though it is missing it's plate glass control
&gt;&gt;&gt;panel cover.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The radio was dead, but beautiful and I knew that I would someday have
&gt;&gt;&gt;it repaired.  So I claimed it and we stored it.  The radio moved from
&gt;&gt;&gt;town to town with us, un-repaired, until we landed here in Modesto.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then it landed in my garage for 3 and a half more years.  It survived
&gt;&gt;&gt;115 degree (F) heat waves and actual freezing temperatures.  It
&gt;&gt;&gt;survived the demolition of the old shake and shingle roofs and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;installation of the new composite shingle roof.  It survived numerous
&gt;&gt;&gt;adoptions by spiders, a few of them were black widows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Finally, in April I took into a funky old shop downtown called Radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;Electronics (of all things).  The guy who runs it, Leroy, is in his
&gt;&gt;&gt;70s and has only a rudimentary grasp of electronics not related
&gt;&gt;&gt;directly to video or sound production.  The credit card reader is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;mystery to him; the printer/fax/copier is an infernal machine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The place is a radio geek's heaven.  It's a fire hazard of narrow
&gt;&gt;&gt;passage ways ancient wooden steps, and low ceilinged alcoves festooned
&gt;&gt;&gt;with circuit boards, pegboards, CRT tubes, amp tubes, wires, stereo
&gt;&gt;&gt;components in every stage of disrepair, and wondrous little
&gt;&gt;&gt;doo-hickies that light up and find broadcast signals or read 78s, 45s,
&gt;&gt;&gt;33s, CDs, tapes, and DVDs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Late last week, we got a call.  The radio was ready and we could come
&gt;&gt;&gt;pick it up.  We were away, they left a message.  They a second message
&gt;&gt;&gt;on Monday morning.  Monday evening, just minutes after coming in off
&gt;&gt;&gt;the road and hearing the messages, the phone rang again.  It was
&gt;&gt;&gt;Leroy.  I could tell he was excited.  He had managed a *complete*
&gt;&gt;&gt;repair despite some severe obstacles, like a warped chassis,
&gt;&gt;&gt;deteriorated belts, hardened lubricating grease, and bent control
&gt;&gt;&gt;shafts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The repair required skill and ingenuity, and the radio was a worthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;recipient of his efforts.  He recreated rivets, he bored out parts of
&gt;&gt;&gt;the chassis to accommodate a slightly longer replacement belt, he ran
&gt;&gt;&gt;a tension wire from one corner of the chassis to another to counter
&gt;&gt;&gt;the warping and make all of the shafts slide inside one another
&gt;&gt;&gt;perfectly.  He used small bits of rubber tire inner tube to replace
&gt;&gt;&gt;the old, dried, and hardened rubber mounting rings.  Genius.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I went down to pick it up today.  Leroy spent an hour explaining the
&gt;&gt;&gt;repairs, the repair process, and showing me how the radio worked.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;was clearly proud, and I was happy to share the success with him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;When I brought it home and plugged it in, it was magical. The dial and
&gt;&gt;&gt;controls are in the shape of a rounded isosceles triangle with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;circular frequency dial.  On the left corner is the 3 position &quot;On&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;switch (Off, On Local, and On Distance).  On the right is the volume
&gt;&gt;&gt;control.  On the top is the 5 position tone control switch; it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;almost a notch filter.  Bottom center is a 3 part concentric switch
&gt;&gt;&gt;with which the user chooses the band (AM, Shortwave, and REALLY
&gt;&gt;&gt;Shortwave), turns the dial to fine tune the radio, and runs a motor
&gt;&gt;&gt;driven quick tuner to get around the dial fast.

&gt;&gt;&gt;When you switch bands, the dial face splits in two and the halves
&gt;&gt;&gt;slide into a recesses on either side of the triangle.  When you tune,
&gt;&gt;&gt;you can visually gauge the power of the signal by watching how close
&gt;&gt;&gt;to creating a full circle a little green florescent light appears.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The tone is amazing, it beats the hell out of any AM radio made in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;last 30 years.  The 75 watt amp has a lot of power and is pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;transparent. The Giants never sounded so good losing to &lt;shudder&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Pirates after dropping two of the last three to &lt;double shudder&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nats.

Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those were such
good voices -- and for a medium that required it.  Those were the Ed
McMahons of radio.

I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad (radio
Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one scene in Africa,
he was to assume a commanding body posture...which is hard to do if
you are three feet tall.

He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.  They just
slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried it again but slower
and it was not going to work with the tight, short-sleeve shirt
limiting what flexibility he had...so he just folded his arms across
his chest without interlocking them.  He did not look authoritative at
all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had a good
voice.

I know of several that he was in and he was an erstwhile narrator on
the Shadow for a while.  Could it have been around 1947...Mystery in
the Air?

I don't have any of these.

I don't like to read mysteries but I like to &quot;hear&quot; them...and not on
TV.

I was watching my new Les Paul DVD and the early parts of it was not
done well at all.  When there is a documentary and the visuals
distract from the narration, then that is ungood.  I have seen this
sort of stuff in the printed media but I finally figured out what it
should be called in moving art...and it is a modern term/problem...I
am calling it &quot;video clip art.&quot;

I have accused out-of-control graphic artists of converting a magazine
readership into a magazine lookership.  This is caused by too much
clip art and too many fonts.  When it was truly cut-and-paste, it was
under control because the schedules didn't permit it to be done to
excess.

With computer graphics, it is too easy to be cute.  I see now that the
same thing can be done in video and I am seeing more and more of it.

Magazine lead stories look just like the magazine's advertisements;
and now the feature video production looks like the TV commercials.

I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun of a lot
but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He helped a lot of
people be discovered and the list of these names is unbelievable.

Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day and near
every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him; the CBS
president loved him...because his shows were cheap to produce and they
brought in a lot of money.  His big production shows cost what cheap
game shows cost, yet for three years this one guy brought in 12% of
CBS's annual income.  For something like eight years, it was over 8%.

The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of his &quot;on
air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.  (Lawrence Welk had a
little bit of this in him, as well.)

Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to dancing
classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he started &quot;seeing&quot;
one of the McGuire sisters, who were other &quot;little Godfreys.&quot;  Then La
Rosa had a big hit record produced independently of Godfrey, and the
last straw was when La Rosa hired an agent/manager.

This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show up for
dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his show-band because
the leader/owner of the band had used the band to back La Rosa on some
recordings and no one had asked Godfrey if that was OK.

Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa on the
air because he had hired him on the air.  The president (it is said)
agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the president's idea.  I doubt
this, but the president would agree to do about anything the
vindictive 12%er wanted.

Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey said.  The
press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him pretty hard because
Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow could get.  He wasn't like
his public persona.  (Two weeks later, he fired the entire band...but
not on the air.  They came in for a rehearsal and the replacement band
was already set up.)

Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the day),
would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind leg for his
home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an airliner had a problem and Godfrey
was told to make another circuit of the traffic pattern.

This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern until the
base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his DC-3 right in front
of the towers windows.

The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned him from
Teterbough and made him move his operation to another field.  Then
Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major TV interview that
America needed the SST like they needed more chunks of rocks from the
moon.  The US SST program was doomed immediately.  Nixon was not
pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey was a
smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the earlier ones
to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He died from emphysema ...
caused by the radiation he had received for lung cancer treatment.

I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation treatment.  An
interesting read would be of the early uses of such treatments and the
damage done while the medical people were learning to use it.

I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by mentioning
Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio and early television. I
remember he was involved in a pretty bad airplane crash, breaking mucho
bones and putting him out for a while.

When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore. He did
pretty well for not having any other talent than chatting up folks and
&quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers. Where would we be if we didn't have

My Heavens, there are a couple of names from the trendy times of radio
and television.  I had forgotten about them -- and I thought of Robert
Q. Lewis about the time I was reading &quot;Durwood Kirby.&quot;

I would watch late night TV if we had someone like Steve Allen or Jack
Parr on it.  I think Carson spanned the period between interesting
guests and just hype for some person's next big production.

Parr was the last of these guys who would bring people in off the
street and talk with them.  He was so disarming.  And he was the last
to have raconteurs.  Alexander King was my favorite.  I saw him on
Parr many times and because of that, I read his books.

&gt;&gt;&gt; lot but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He helped a lot
&gt;&gt;&gt; of people be discovered and the list of these names is unbelievable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day and
&gt;&gt;&gt; near every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him; the CBS

&gt;&gt;&gt; little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to dancing
&gt;&gt;&gt; classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he started
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;seeing&quot; one of the McGuire sisters, who were other &quot;little
&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfreys.&quot;  Then La Rosa had a big hit record produced independently
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Godfrey, and the last straw was when La Rosa hired an
&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show up for
&gt;&gt;&gt; dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his show-band
&gt;&gt;&gt; because the leader/owner of the band had used the band to back La
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rosa on some recordings and no one had asked Godfrey if that was OK.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the air because he had hired him on the air.  The president (it is

&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt this, but the president would agree to do about anything the
&gt;&gt;&gt; vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey said.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him pretty hard
&gt;&gt;&gt; because Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow could get.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't like his public persona.  (Two weeks later, he fired the
&gt;&gt;&gt; entire band...but not on the air.  They came in for a rehearsal and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the replacement band was already set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind leg
&gt;&gt;&gt; for his home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an airliner had a problem and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was told to make another circuit of the traffic pattern.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern until
&gt;&gt;&gt; the base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his DC-3 right in
&gt;&gt;&gt; front of the towers windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned him
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Teterbough and made him move his operation to another field.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Then Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major TV interview
&gt;&gt;&gt; that America needed the SST like they needed more chunks of rocks
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the moon.  The US SST program was doomed immediately.  Nixon
&gt;&gt;&gt; was not pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey was a
&gt;&gt;&gt; smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt; ones to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He died from
&gt;&gt;&gt; emphysema ... caused by the radiation he had received for lung
&gt;&gt;&gt; cancer treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation treatment.  An
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting read would be of the early uses of such treatments and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the damage done while the medical people were learning to use it.

&gt;&gt;Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by mentioning
&gt;&gt;Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio and early
&gt;&gt;television. I remember he was involved in a pretty bad airplane crash,
&gt;&gt;breaking mucho bones and putting him out for a while.

&gt;&gt;When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore. He did
&gt;&gt;pretty well for not having any other talent than chatting up folks and
&gt;&gt;&quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers. Where would we be if we didn't
&gt;&gt;have Durwood Kirby?

&gt; My Heavens, there are a couple of names from the trendy times of radio
&gt; and television.  I had forgotten about them -- and I thought of Robert
&gt; Q. Lewis about the time I was reading &quot;Durwood Kirby.&quot;

&gt; I would watch late night TV if we had someone like Steve Allen or Jack
&gt; Parr on it.  I think Carson spanned the period between interesting
&gt; guests and just hype for some person's next big production.

&gt; Parr was the last of these guys who would bring people in off the
&gt; street and talk with them.  He was so disarming.  And he was the last

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;George
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and Gracie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such good voices -- and for a medium that required it.  Those were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Ed McMahons of radio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad (radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one scene in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Africa, he was to assume a commanding body posture...which is hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do if you are three feet tall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.  They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried it again but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slower and it was not going to work with the tight, short-sleeve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shirt limiting what flexibility he had...so he just folded his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arms across his chest without interlocking them.  He did not look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authoritative
&gt;&gt;&gt;at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had a good
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I started thinking about Our Miss Brooks. Eve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Arden...talk about a perfect transition from radio to television.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So true.  I have quite a few of her programs on tape and DVD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you ever listen to Authur Godfree? I did. I also watched his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;early television shows. I remember seeing him fire Julias La Rosa on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the air for being drunk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;John

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He helped a lot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of people be discovered and the list of these names is unbelievable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; near every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him; the CBS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; president loved him...because his shows were cheap to produce and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they brought in a lot of money.  His big production shows cost what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cheap game shows cost, yet for three years this one guy brought in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 12% of CBS's annual income.  For something like eight years, it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over 8%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of his &quot;on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.  (Lawrence Welk had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to dancing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he started
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;seeing&quot; one of the McGuire sisters, who were other &quot;little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfreys.&quot;  Then La Rosa had a big hit record produced independently
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Godfrey, and the last straw was when La Rosa hired an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show up for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his show-band
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because the leader/owner of the band had used the band to back La
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rosa on some recordings and no one had asked Godfrey if that was OK.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the air because he had hired him on the air.  The president (it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said) agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the president's idea.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt this, but the president would agree to do about anything the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him pretty hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow could get.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't like his public persona.  (Two weeks later, he fired the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entire band...but not on the air.  They came in for a rehearsal and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the replacement band was already set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind leg
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for his home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an airliner had a problem and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was told to make another circuit of the traffic pattern.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern until
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his DC-3 right in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; front of the towers windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from Teterbough and made him move his operation to another field.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major TV interview
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that America needed the SST like they needed more chunks of rocks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the moon.  The US SST program was doomed immediately.  Nixon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was not pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ones to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He died from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; emphysema ... caused by the radiation he had received for lung
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cancer treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation treatment.  An
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting read would be of the early uses of such treatments and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the damage done while the medical people were learning to use it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by mentioning
&gt;&gt;&gt;Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio and early

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers. Where would we be if we didn't

And did you know that he and Susan  Pleschette (Newhart) got married
in their later days.  What a romance that must have been.  There had
to be something very satisfying about marrying an old friend and
working partner.

Well...it would have been for me...if it was Susan Pleschette...though
she was pretty rough and would have made mince-meat outta' me.  (Being
mince-meat shouldn't be that bad, should it?)

Are you saying Tom Posten and Susan Pleschette were married? I never new
that. Susan Pleschette was a regularly reoccuring guest on the Johnny
Carson show way back when...guess they were Buds. She used to talk about
her husband, which, if memory serves, was a big time producer. But I sure
could have missed something.

And that provoked me to think about the all time greatest final show in
television history. The dream sequence of an older Bob Newhart show for
the finale of the newer Newhart show.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Daniel, that was not at all long.  It was great!  Thanks for sharing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ahhh...radio!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ken

&gt;&gt;Both interesting posts. Hated to trim them but did want you to find my
&gt;&gt;words.

&gt;&gt;Glad you found some interesting things Daniel. I've participated in a
&gt;&gt;similar archeological dig and found nothing interesting (unfortunately
&gt;&gt;I'm not a fungiologist).

&gt;&gt;Ken - don't know why I haven't asked you this before - you of all
&gt;&gt;people would know. (maybe I have and dis-remember?) What was the show
&gt;&gt;that Peter Lorre narrated, in which he always sequed into the story
&gt;&gt;with &quot;...trapped in a living nightmare?&quot; The only actual story I
&gt;&gt;recall was &quot;the Birds.&quot; Best version ever including the short story,
&gt;&gt;or so it seems in my memory.

&gt;I know of several that he was in and he was an erstwhile narrator on
&gt;the Shadow for a while.  Could it have been around 1947...Mystery in
&gt;the Air?

&gt;I don't have any of these.

&gt;I don't like to read mysteries but I like to &quot;hear&quot; them...and not on
&gt;TV.

&gt;I was watching my new Les Paul DVD and the early parts of it was not
&gt;done well at all.  When there is a documentary and the visuals
&gt;distract from the narration, then that is ungood.  I have seen this
&gt;sort of stuff in the printed media but I finally figured out what it
&gt;should be called in moving art...and it is a modern term/problem...I
&gt;am calling it &quot;video clip art.&quot;

&gt;I have accused out-of-control graphic artists of converting a magazine
&gt;readership into a magazine lookership.  This is caused by too much
&gt;clip art and too many fonts.  When it was truly cut-and-paste, it was
&gt;under control because the schedules didn't permit it to be done to
&gt;excess.

&gt;With computer graphics, it is too easy to be cute.  I see now that the
&gt;same thing can be done in video and I am seeing more and more of it.

&gt;Magazine lead stories look just like the magazine's advertisements;
&gt;and now the feature video production looks like the TV commercials.

I don' wanna read all this crap - where are the pitchers?

What I remember of the Lorre show was later than '47, I'm sure. Did
they have radio re-runs? At least I think it was at least '50, more
like '52. In the garage-turned-cottage in Ocean Gate NJ. Brown radio
in the corner. Dark, lots of vines and trees around the cottage...

Odd that I turned out to like birds so much.

I have no idea what the show's title was but I doubt it was &quot;mystery&quot;
since the &quot;...trapped in a living nightmare&quot; thing would seem more
like a forunner of &quot;the Twilight Zone.&quot; Maybe it wasn't even a weekly
show - I only remember the one specifically - but I'm pretty sure it
was since it was something I recall looking forward to. Maybe I should
try hypnosis - I'm sure the details are embedded somewhere unless they
were in the cells flushed down the toilet.

The thing that I find surprising is that I've yet to find anyone who
has heard of this - maybe it was all a dream...

...or at least a muddled memory. Tried Google again and this time
found &quot;the Birds&quot; but Lorre wasn't involved. Still scary and the best
version though, I'd say. Still wondering where the &quot;living nightmare&quot;
thing is - maybe it's me trying to figure this out.

Anyway I found a good place to dig -
http://www.themonsterclub.com/radiolibrary.htm - lots of old favorites
there.

That made me think of something about a then-TV newbie. Regis Philbin
had his first TV show in the late fifties, and it lasted for ONE episode
and was a complete bust. Everything went wrong and Regis broke down and
cried. I remember this incident as plain as day, but I can't find any
other information to confirm this.

Does anyone else remember this? (No, I don't have it confused with a
similar incident with Jerry Lewis.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Vonzell. I know I don't have to tell you he was the announcer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;George
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and Gracie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such good voices -- and for a medium that required it.  Those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were the Ed McMahons of radio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (radio Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scene in Africa, he was to assume a commanding body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posture...which is hard to do if you are three feet tall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.  They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried it again
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but slower and it was not going to work with the tight,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short-sleeve shirt limiting what flexibility he had...so he just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; folded his arms across his chest without interlocking them.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did not look authoritative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I started thinking about Our Miss Brooks. Eve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Arden...talk about a perfect transition from radio to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;television.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So true.  I have quite a few of her programs on tape and DVD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you ever listen to Authur Godfree? I did. I also watched his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;early television shows. I remember seeing him fire Julias La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on the air for being drunk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;John

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He helped a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of people be discovered and the list of these names is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unbelievable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; near every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him; the CBS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; president loved him...because his shows were cheap to produce and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they brought in a lot of money.  His big production shows cost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what cheap game shows cost, yet for three years this one guy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brought in 12% of CBS's annual income.  For something like eight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years, it was over 8%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;on air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.  (Lawrence Welk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had a little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to dancing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he started
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;seeing&quot; one of the McGuire sisters, who were other &quot;little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfreys.&quot;  Then La Rosa had a big hit record produced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; independently of Godfrey, and the last straw was when La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hired an agent/manager.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his show-band
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because the leader/owner of the band had used the band to back La
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rosa on some recordings and no one had asked Godfrey if that was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OK.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the air because he had hired him on the air.  The president (it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said) agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the president's idea.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt this, but the president would agree to do about anything the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey said.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him pretty hard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow could get.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn't like his public persona.  (Two weeks later, he fired the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entire band...but not on the air.  They came in for a rehearsal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the replacement band was already set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind leg
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for his home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an airliner had a problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Godfrey was told to make another circuit of the traffic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern until
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his DC-3 right
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in front of the towers windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from Teterbough and made him move his operation to another field.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major TV
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interview that America needed the SST like they needed more chunks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of rocks from the moon.  The US SST program was doomed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately.  Nixon was not pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ones to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He died from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; emphysema ... caused by the radiation he had received for lung
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cancer treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation treatment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting read would be of the early uses of such treatments
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the damage done while the medical people were learning to use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by mentioning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio and early
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;television. I remember he was involved in a pretty bad airplane
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;crash, breaking mucho bones and putting him out for a while.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;did pretty well for not having any other talent than chatting up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;folks and &quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers. Where would we be if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;we didn't have Durwood Kirby?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My Heavens, there are a couple of names from the trendy times of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio and television.  I had forgotten about them -- and I thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Robert Q. Lewis about the time I was reading &quot;Durwood Kirby.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would watch late night TV if we had someone like Steve Allen or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jack Parr on it.  I think Carson spanned the period between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting guests and just hype for some person's next big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Parr was the last of these guys who would bring people in off the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; street and talk with them.  He was so disarming.  And he was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last to have raconteurs.  Alexander King was my favorite.  I saw him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on Parr many times and because of that, I read his books.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;I loved the Parr show...I kid you not. Also Steve Allen. Remember The
&gt;&gt;&gt;Man In The Street? Tom Poston was on that skit. He died a few weeks
&gt;&gt;&gt;back.

&gt;&gt; And did you know that he and Susan  Pleschette (Newhart) got married
&gt;&gt; in their later days.  What a romance that must have been.  There had
&gt;&gt; to be something very satisfying about marrying an old friend and
&gt;&gt; working partner.

&gt;&gt; Well...it would have been for me...if it was Susan Pleschette...though
&gt;&gt; she was pretty rough and would have made mince-meat outta' me.  (Being
&gt;&gt; mince-meat shouldn't be that bad, should it?)

&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;Are you saying Tom Posten and Susan Pleschette were married? I never new
&gt;that. Susan Pleschette was a regularly reoccuring guest on the Johnny
&gt;Carson show way back when...guess they were Buds.

Tom Poston was a recurring guest on the earlier Newhart show.  As I
remember, he was a forest ranger, lumber jack, or something.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;She used to talk about
&gt;her husband, which, if memory serves, was a big time producer. But I sure
&gt;could have missed something.

This was an earlier husband, I think. Pleschette and Poston got
married late.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And that provoked me to think about the all time greatest final show in
&gt;television history. The dream sequence of an older Bob Newhart show for
&gt;the finale of the newer Newhart show.
">

As soon as that scene opened, Bettie burst out laughing.  I got the
joke just before Pleschette turned over toward Newhart.  (Mary Fran,
Newhart's second &quot;wife,&quot; was a better ensemble actress than I think
she was given credit for.  Anyone wanting to study acting should watch
her...all the time.  She contributed the most when she didn't have
lines and was just reacting.)

Genius writers we once had.  (Neil Simon really screwed up humor when
he made it too easy for bad writers.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ken - don't know why I haven't asked you this before - you of all

&gt;&gt;I don't have any of these.

&gt;&gt;clip art and too many fonts.  When it was truly cut-and-paste, it was
&gt;&gt;under control because the schedules didn't permit it to be done to
&gt;&gt;excess.

&gt;&gt;With computer graphics, it is too easy to be cute.  I see now that the
&gt;&gt;same thing can be done in video and I am seeing more and more of it.

&gt;&gt;Magazine lead stories look just like the magazine's advertisements;
&gt;&gt;and now the feature video production looks like the TV commercials.

&gt;What I remember of the Lorre show was later than '47, I'm sure. Did
&gt;they have radio re-runs? At least I think it was at least '50, more
&gt;like '52. In the garage-turned-cottage in Ocean Gate NJ. Brown radio
&gt;in the corner. Dark, lots of vines and trees around the cottage...

&gt;Odd that I turned out to like birds so much.

&gt;I have no idea what the show's title was but I doubt it was &quot;mystery&quot;
&gt;since the &quot;...trapped in a living nightmare&quot; thing would seem more
&gt;like a forunner of &quot;the Twilight Zone.&quot; Maybe it wasn't even a weekly
&gt;show - I only remember the one specifically - but I'm pretty sure it
&gt;was since it was something I recall looking forward to. Maybe I should
&gt;try hypnosis - I'm sure the details are embedded somewhere unless they
&gt;were in the cells flushed down the toilet.

&gt;The thing that I find surprising is that I've yet to find anyone who
&gt;has heard of this - maybe it was all a dream...

&gt;...or at least a muddled memory. Tried Google again and this time
&gt;found &quot;the Birds&quot; but Lorre wasn't involved. Still scary and the best
&gt;version though, I'd say. Still wondering where the &quot;living nightmare&quot;
&gt;thing is - maybe it's me trying to figure this out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ahhh...radio!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Both interesting posts. Hated to trim them but did want you to find my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;words.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Glad you found some interesting things Daniel. I've participated in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;similar archeological dig and found nothing interesting (unfortunately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm not a fungiologist).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ken - don't know why I haven't asked you this before - you of all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people would know. (maybe I have and dis-remember?) What was the show
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that Peter Lorre narrated, in which he always sequed into the story
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with &quot;...trapped in a living nightmare?&quot; The only actual story I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;recall was &quot;the Birds.&quot; Best version ever including the short story,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or so it seems in my memory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I know of several that he was in and he was an erstwhile narrator on
&gt;&gt;&gt;the Shadow for a while.  Could it have been around 1947...Mystery in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the Air?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't have any of these.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't like to read mysteries but I like to &quot;hear&quot; them...and not on
&gt;&gt;&gt;TV.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I was watching my new Les Paul DVD and the early parts of it was not
&gt;&gt;&gt;done well at all.  When there is a documentary and the visuals
&gt;&gt;&gt;distract from the narration, then that is ungood.  I have seen this
&gt;&gt;&gt;sort of stuff in the printed media but I finally figured out what it
&gt;&gt;&gt;should be called in moving art...and it is a modern term/problem...I
&gt;&gt;&gt;am calling it &quot;video clip art.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have accused out-of-control graphic artists of converting a magazine

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and Gracie.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those were such
&gt;&gt;&gt; good voices -- and for a medium that required it.  Those were the Ed
&gt;&gt;&gt; McMahons of radio.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad (radio
&gt;&gt;&gt; Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one scene in Africa,
&gt;&gt;&gt; he was to assume a commanding body posture...which is hard to do if
&gt;&gt;&gt; you are three feet tall.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
&gt;&gt;&gt; defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.  They just
&gt;&gt;&gt; slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried it again but slower
&gt;&gt;&gt; and it was not going to work with the tight, short-sleeve shirt
&gt;&gt;&gt; limiting what flexibility he had...so he just folded his arms across
&gt;&gt;&gt; his chest without interlocking them.  He did not look authoritative at
&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had a good
&gt;&gt;&gt; voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I started thinking about Our Miss Brooks. Eve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Arden...talk about a perfect transition from radio to television.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So true.  I have quite a few of her programs on tape and DVD.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;Did you ever listen to Authur Godfree? I did. I also watched his early
&gt;&gt;television shows. I remember seeing him fire Julias La Rosa on the air
&gt;&gt;for being drunk.

&gt;&gt;John

&gt;I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun of a lot
&gt;but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He helped a lot of
&gt;people be discovered and the list of these names is unbelievable.

&gt;Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day and near
&gt;every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him; the CBS
&gt;president loved him...because his shows were cheap to produce and they
&gt;brought in a lot of money.  His big production shows cost what cheap
&gt;game shows cost, yet for three years this one guy brought in 12% of
&gt;CBS's annual income.  For something like eight years, it was over 8%.

&gt;The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of his &quot;on
&gt;air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.  (Lawrence Welk had a
&gt;little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to dancing
&gt;classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he started &quot;seeing&quot;
&gt;one of the McGuire sisters, who were other &quot;little Godfreys.&quot;  Then La
&gt;Rosa had a big hit record produced independently of Godfrey, and the
&gt;last straw was when La Rosa hired an agent/manager.

&gt;This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show up for
&gt;dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his show-band because
&gt;the leader/owner of the band had used the band to back La Rosa on some
&gt;recordings and no one had asked Godfrey if that was OK.

&gt;Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa on the
&gt;air because he had hired him on the air.  The president (it is said)
&gt;agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the president's idea.  I doubt
&gt;this, but the president would agree to do about anything the
&gt;vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey said.  The
&gt;press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him pretty hard because
&gt;Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow could get.  He wasn't like
&gt;his public persona.  (Two weeks later, he fired the entire band...but
&gt;not on the air.  They came in for a rehearsal and the replacement band
&gt;was already set up.)

&gt;Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the day),
&gt;would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind leg for his
&gt;home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an airliner had a problem and Godfrey
&gt;was told to make another circuit of the traffic pattern.

&gt;This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern until the
&gt;base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his DC-3 right in front
&gt;of the towers windows.

&gt;The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned him from
&gt;Teterbough and made him move his operation to another field.  Then
&gt;Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major TV interview that
&gt;America needed the SST like they needed more chunks of rocks from the
&gt;moon.  The US SST program was doomed immediately.  Nixon was not
&gt;pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey was a
&gt;smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the earlier ones
&gt;to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He died from emphysema ...
&gt;caused by the radiation he had received for lung cancer treatment.

&gt;I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation treatment.  An
&gt;interesting read would be of the early uses of such treatments and the
&gt;damage done while the medical people were learning to use it.

&gt;I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

&gt;Ken
">

Seems like I was still in a high chair but remember listening to him
every morning on the white Sonora radio. His tales of flying the
Navion, the DC-3, Pensacola etc. definitely had an influence on my
ending up in Pensacola, though not an aviator as I'd planned. Maybe
I'd stayed in the high chair too long. Or maybe that's just another
false memory. The chair, I mean, not Godfrey. Now I'm babbling.

So what Godfrey associate  said &quot;For free, take. For buy, waste time.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by mentioning
&gt;&gt;  Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio and early
&gt;&gt; television. I remember he was involved in a pretty bad airplane
&gt;&gt; crash, breaking mucho bones and putting him out for a while.

&gt;&gt; When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore. He did
&gt;&gt;  pretty well for not having any other talent than chatting up folks
&gt;&gt; and &quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers. Where would we be if we
&gt;&gt; didn't have Durwood Kirby?

&gt;&gt; John

&gt; That made me think of something about a then-TV newbie. Regis Philbin
&gt; had his first TV show in the late fifties, and it lasted for ONE
episode
&gt; and was a complete bust. Everything went wrong and Regis broke down and
&gt; cried. I remember this incident as plain as day, but I can't find any
&gt; other information to confirm this.

&gt; Does anyone else remember this? (No, I don't have it confused with a
&gt; similar incident with Jerry Lewis.)

I remember him being the side kick for Joey Bishop, but not him having

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the air because he had hired him on the air.  The president
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (it is said) agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the president's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea.  I doubt this, but the president would agree to do about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything the vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said. The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty hard because Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could get.  He wasn't like his public persona.  (Two weeks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; later, he fired the entire band...but not on the air.  They came
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in for a rehearsal and the replacement band was already set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leg for his home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an airliner had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem and Godfrey was told to make another circuit of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traffic pattern.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until the base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DC-3 right in front of the towers windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him from Teterbough and made him move his operation to another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; field. Then Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major TV
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interview that America needed the SST like they needed more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chunks of rocks from the moon.  The US SST program was doomed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately.  Nixon was not pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was a smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier ones to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He died
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from emphysema ... caused by the radiation he had received for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lung cancer treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation treatment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting read would be of the early uses of such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatments and the damage done while the medical people were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning to use it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mentioning Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;early television. I remember he was involved in a pretty bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;airplane crash, breaking mucho bones and putting him out for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;while.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;did pretty well for not having any other talent than chatting up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;folks and &quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers. Where would we be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if we didn't have Durwood Kirby?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My Heavens, there are a couple of names from the trendy times of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio and television.  I had forgotten about them -- and I thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Robert Q. Lewis about the time I was reading &quot;Durwood Kirby.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would watch late night TV if we had someone like Steve Allen or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jack Parr on it.  I think Carson spanned the period between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting guests and just hype for some person's next big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Parr was the last of these guys who would bring people in off the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; street and talk with them.  He was so disarming.  And he was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last to have raconteurs.  Alexander King was my favorite.  I saw
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him on Parr many times and because of that, I read his books.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I loved the Parr show...I kid you not. Also Steve Allen. Remember
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Man In The Street? Tom Poston was on that skit. He died a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;weeks back.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And did you know that he and Susan  Pleschette (Newhart) got married
&gt;&gt;&gt; in their later days.  What a romance that must have been.  There had
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be something very satisfying about marrying an old friend and
&gt;&gt;&gt; working partner.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well...it would have been for me...if it was Susan
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pleschette...though she was pretty rough and would have made
&gt;&gt;&gt; mince-meat outta' me.  (Being mince-meat shouldn't be that bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt; should it?)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;Are you saying Tom Posten and Susan Pleschette were married? I never
&gt;&gt;new that. Susan Pleschette was a regularly reoccuring guest on the
&gt;&gt;Johnny Carson show way back when...guess they were Buds.

&gt; Tom Poston was a recurring guest on the earlier Newhart show.  As I
&gt; remember, he was a forest ranger, lumber jack, or something.

&gt;&gt;She used to talk about
&gt;&gt;her husband, which, if memory serves, was a big time producer. But I
&gt;&gt;sure could have missed something.

&gt; This was an earlier husband, I think. Pleschette and Poston got
&gt; married late.

&gt;&gt;And that provoked me to think about the all time greatest final show
&gt;&gt;in television history. The dream sequence of an older Bob Newhart show
&gt;&gt;for the finale of the newer Newhart show.

&gt; As soon as that scene opened, Bettie burst out laughing.  I got the
&gt; joke just before Pleschette turned over toward Newhart.  (Mary Fran,
&gt; Newhart's second &quot;wife,&quot; was a better ensemble actress than I think
&gt; she was given credit for.  Anyone wanting to study acting should watch
&gt; her...all the time.  She contributed the most when she didn't have
&gt; lines and was just reacting.)

&gt; Genius writers we once had.  (Neil Simon really screwed up humor when
&gt; he made it too easy for bad writers.)

We had a drinking game in college called Hello Bob. We would watch the
old Bob Newhart show and everytime someone said Bob we would have to take

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When you mentioned Harry, for some reason I immediately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;thought of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Vonzell. I know I don't have to tell you he was the announcer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;George
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and Gracie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were such good voices -- and for a medium that required it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those were the Ed McMahons of radio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (radio Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scene in Africa, he was to assume a commanding body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posture...which is hard to do if you are three feet tall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They just slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again but slower and it was not going to work with the tight,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short-sleeve shirt limiting what flexibility he had...so he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just folded his arms across his chest without interlocking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them.  He did not look authoritative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I started thinking about Our Miss Brooks. Eve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Arden...talk about a perfect transition from radio to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;television.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So true.  I have quite a few of her programs on tape and DVD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you ever listen to Authur Godfree? I did. I also watched his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;early television shows. I remember seeing him fire Julias La
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rosa on the air for being drunk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;John

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He helped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of people be discovered and the list of these names is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unbelievable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; near every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CBS president loved him...because his shows were cheap to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; produce and they brought in a lot of money.  His big production
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shows cost what cheap game shows cost, yet for three years this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one guy brought in 12% of CBS's annual income.  For something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like eight years, it was over 8%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;on air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.  (Lawrence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welk had a little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dancing classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started &quot;seeing&quot; one of the McGuire sisters, who were other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;little Godfreys.&quot;  Then La Rosa had a big hit record produced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; independently of Godfrey, and the last straw was when La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hired an agent/manager.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show-band because the leader/owner of the band had used the band
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to back La Rosa on some recordings and no one had asked Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if that was OK.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the air because he had hired him on the air.  The president
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (it is said) agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the president's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea.  I doubt this, but the president would agree to do about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything the vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said. The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty hard because Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; later, he fired the entire band...but not on the air.  They came
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in for a rehearsal and the replacement band was already set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Gracie.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were such good voices -- and for a medium that required it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those were the Ed McMahons of radio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (radio Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scene in Africa, he was to assume a commanding body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posture...which is hard to do if you are three feet tall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They just slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again but slower and it was not going to work with the tight,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short-sleeve shirt limiting what flexibility he had...so he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just folded his arms across his chest without interlocking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them.  He did not look authoritative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then I started thinking about Our Miss Brooks. Eve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arden...talk about a perfect transition from radio to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; television.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So true.  I have quite a few of her programs on tape and DVD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you ever listen to Authur Godfree? I did. I also watched his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; early television shows. I remember seeing him fire Julias La
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rosa on the air for being drunk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He helped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of people be discovered and the list of these names is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unbelievable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; near every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CBS president loved him...because his shows were cheap to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; produce and they brought in a lot of money.  His big production
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shows cost what cheap game shows cost, yet for three years this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one guy brought in 12% of CBS's annual income.  For something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like eight years, it was over 8%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;on air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.  (Lawrence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welk had a little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dancing classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started &quot;seeing&quot; one of the McGuire sisters, who were other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;little Godfreys.&quot;  Then La Rosa had a big hit record produced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; independently of Godfrey, and the last straw was when La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hired an agent/manager.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show-band because the leader/owner of the band had used the band
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to back La Rosa on some recordings and no one had asked Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if that was OK.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the air because he had hired him on the air.  The president
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (it is said) agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the president's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea.  I doubt this, but the president would agree to do about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything the vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said. The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty hard because Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could get.  He wasn't like his public persona.  (Two weeks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; later, he fired the entire band...but not on the air.  They came
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in for a rehearsal and the replacement band was already set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leg for his home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an airliner had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem and Godfrey was told to make another circuit of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traffic pattern.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until the base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DC-3 right in front of the towers windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him from Teterbough and made him move his operation to another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; field. Then Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major TV
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interview that America needed the SST like they needed more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chunks of rocks from the moon.  The US SST program was doomed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately.  Nixon was not pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was a smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier ones to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He died
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from emphysema ... caused by the radiation he had received for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lung cancer treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation treatment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting read would be of the early uses of such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatments and the damage done while the medical people were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning to use it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioning Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; early television. I remember he was involved in a pretty bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; airplane crash, breaking mucho bones and putting him out for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did pretty well for not having any other talent than chatting up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; folks and &quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers. Where would we be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if we didn't have Durwood Kirby?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My Heavens, there are a couple of names from the trendy times of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio and television.  I had forgotten about them -- and I thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Robert Q. Lewis about the time I was reading &quot;Durwood Kirby.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would watch late night TV if we had someone like Steve Allen or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jack Parr on it.  I think Carson spanned the period between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting guests and just hype for some person's next big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Parr was the last of these guys who would bring people in off the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; street and talk with them.  He was so disarming.  And he was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last to have raconteurs.  Alexander King was my favorite.  I saw
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him on Parr many times and because of that, I read his books.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I loved the Parr show...I kid you not. Also Steve Allen. Remember
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Man In The Street? Tom Poston was on that skit. He died a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks back.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And did you know that he and Susan  Pleschette (Newhart) got married
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in their later days.  What a romance that must have been.  There had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be something very satisfying about marrying an old friend and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; working partner.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well...it would have been for me...if it was Susan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pleschette...though she was pretty rough and would have made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mince-meat outta' me.  (Being mince-meat shouldn't be that bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should it?)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying Tom Posten and Susan Pleschette were married? I never
&gt;&gt;&gt; new that. Susan Pleschette was a regularly reoccuring guest on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Johnny Carson show way back when...guess they were Buds.
&gt;&gt; Tom Poston was a recurring guest on the earlier Newhart show.  As I
&gt;&gt; remember, he was a forest ranger, lumber jack, or something.

&gt;&gt;&gt; She used to talk about
&gt;&gt;&gt; her husband, which, if memory serves, was a big time producer. But I
&gt;&gt;&gt; sure could have missed something.
&gt;&gt; This was an earlier husband, I think. Pleschette and Poston got
&gt;&gt; married late.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And that provoked me to think about the all time greatest final show
&gt;&gt;&gt; in television history. The dream sequence of an older Bob Newhart show
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the finale of the newer Newhart show.
&gt;&gt; As soon as that scene opened, Bettie burst out laughing.  I got the
&gt;&gt; joke just before Pleschette turned over toward Newhart.  (Mary Fran,
&gt;&gt; Newhart's second &quot;wife,&quot; was a better ensemble actress than I think
&gt;&gt; she was given credit for.  Anyone wanting to study acting should watch
&gt;&gt; her...all the time.  She contributed the most when she didn't have
&gt;&gt; lines and was just reacting.)

&gt;&gt; Genius writers we once had.  (Neil Simon really screwed up humor when
&gt;&gt; he made it too easy for bad writers.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatment. An interesting read would be of the early uses of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such treatments and the damage done while the medical people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were learning to use it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioning Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and early television. I remember he was involved in a pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bad airplane crash, breaking mucho bones and putting him out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for a while.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He did pretty well for not having any other talent than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chatting up folks and &quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where would we be if we didn't have Durwood Kirby?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My Heavens, there are a couple of names from the trendy times of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio and television.  I had forgotten about them -- and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought of Robert Q. Lewis about the time I was reading &quot;Durwood
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kirby.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would watch late night TV if we had someone like Steve Allen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or Jack Parr on it.  I think Carson spanned the period between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting guests and just hype for some person's next big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Parr was the last of these guys who would bring people in off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the street and talk with them.  He was so disarming.  And he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the last to have raconteurs.  Alexander King was my favorite.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; saw him on Parr many times and because of that, I read his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I loved the Parr show...I kid you not. Also Steve Allen. Remember
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Man In The Street? Tom Poston was on that skit. He died a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks back.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And did you know that he and Susan  Pleschette (Newhart) got
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; married in their later days.  What a romance that must have been.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There had to be something very satisfying about marrying an old
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; friend and working partner.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well...it would have been for me...if it was Susan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pleschette...though she was pretty rough and would have made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mince-meat outta' me.  (Being mince-meat shouldn't be that bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should it?)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying Tom Posten and Susan Pleschette were married? I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never new that. Susan Pleschette was a regularly reoccuring guest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the Johnny Carson show way back when...guess they were Buds.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom Poston was a recurring guest on the earlier Newhart show.  As I
&gt;&gt;&gt; remember, he was a forest ranger, lumber jack, or something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She used to talk about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her husband, which, if memory serves, was a big time producer. But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I sure could have missed something.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This was an earlier husband, I think. Pleschette and Poston got
&gt;&gt;&gt; married late.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And that provoked me to think about the all time greatest final
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show in television history. The dream sequence of an older Bob
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Newhart show for the finale of the newer Newhart show.
&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as that scene opened, Bettie burst out laughing.  I got the
&gt;&gt;&gt; joke just before Pleschette turned over toward Newhart.  (Mary Fran,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Newhart's second &quot;wife,&quot; was a better ensemble actress

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you mentioned Harry, for some reason I immediately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vonzell. I know I don't have to tell you he was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; announcer for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; George
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Gracie.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were such good voices -- and for a medium that required it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those were the Ed McMahons of radio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (radio Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scene in Africa, he was to assume a commanding body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posture...which is hard to do if you are three feet tall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They just slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again but slower and it was not going to work with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tight, short-sleeve shirt limiting what flexibility he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had...so he just folded his arms across his chest without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interlocking them.  He did not look authoritative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a good voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then I started thinking about Our Miss Brooks. Eve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arden...talk about a perfect transition from radio to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; television.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So true.  I have quite a few of her programs on tape and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DVD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you ever listen to Authur Godfree? I did. I also watched
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his early television shows. I remember seeing him fire Julias
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; La Rosa on the air for being drunk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of a lot but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; helped a lot of people be discovered and the list of these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; names is unbelievable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and near every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the CBS president loved him...because his shows were cheap to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; produce and they brought in a lot of money.  His big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production shows cost what cheap game shows cost, yet for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three years this one guy brought in 12% of CBS's annual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; income.  For something like eight years, it was over 8%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his &quot;on air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Lawrence Welk had a little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dancing classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started &quot;seeing&quot; one of the McGuire sisters, who were other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;little Godfreys.&quot;  Then La Rosa had a big hit record produced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; independently of Godfrey, and the last straw was when La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hired an agent/manager.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up for dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show-band because the leader/owner of the band had used the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; band to back La Rosa on some recordings and no one had asked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey if that was OK.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the air because he had hired him on the air.  The president
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (it is said) agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; president's idea.  I doubt this, but the president would agree
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do about anything the vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said. The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty hard because Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could get.  He wasn't like his public persona.  (Two weeks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; later, he fired the entire band...but not on the air.  They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; came in for a rehearsal and the replacement band was already
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; downwind leg for his home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; airliner had a problem and Godfrey was told to make another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circuit of the traffic pattern.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until the base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DC-3 right in front of the towers windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him from Teterbough and made him move his operation to another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; field. Then Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TV interview that America needed the SST like they needed more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chunks of rocks from the moon.  The US SST program was doomed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately.  Nixon was not pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was a smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier ones to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; died from emphysema ... caused by the radiation he had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; received for lung cancer treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatment. An interesting read would be of the early uses of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such treatments and the damage done while the medical people

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vonzell. I know I don't have to tell you he was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; announcer for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; George
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Gracie.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were such good voices -- and for a medium that required it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those were the Ed McMahons of radio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (radio Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scene in Africa, he was to assume a commanding body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posture...which is hard to do if you are three feet tall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They just slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried
it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again but slower and it was not going to work with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tight, short-sleeve shirt limiting what flexibility he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had...so he just folded his arms across his chest without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interlocking them.  He did not look authoritative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a good voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then I started thinking about Our Miss Brooks. Eve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arden...talk about a perfect transition from radio to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; television.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So true.  I have quite a few of her programs on tape and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DVD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you ever listen to Authur Godfree? I did. I also watched
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his early television shows. I remember seeing him fire
Julias
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; La Rosa on the air for being drunk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of a lot but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; helped a lot of people be discovered and the list of these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; names is unbelievable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and near every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated
him;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the CBS president loved him...because his shows were cheap to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; produce and they brought in a lot of money.  His big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production shows cost what cheap game shows cost, yet for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three years this one guy brought in 12% of CBS's annual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; income.  For something like eight years, it was over 8%.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his &quot;on air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Lawrence Welk had a little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dancing classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started &quot;seeing&quot; one of the McGuire sisters, who were other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;little Godfreys.&quot;  Then La Rosa had a big hit record
produced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; independently of Godfrey, and the last straw was when La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hired an agent/manager.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up for dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show-band because the leader/owner of the band had used the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; band to back La Rosa on some recordings and no one had asked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey if that was OK.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La
Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the air because he had hired him on the air.  The
president
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (it is said) agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; president's idea.  I doubt this, but the president would
agree
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do about anything the vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said. The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty hard because Godfrey was as far from humble as a
fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could get.  He wasn't like his public persona.  (Two weeks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; later, he fired the entire band...but not on the air.  They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; came in for a rehearsal and the replacement band was already
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; downwind leg for his home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; airliner had a problem and Godfrey was told to make another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circuit of the traffic pattern.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until the base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DC-3 right in front of the towers windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him from Teterbough and made him move his operation to
another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; field. Then Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TV interview that America needed the SST like they needed
more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chunks of rocks from the moon.  The US SST program was doomed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately.  Nixon was not pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other note -- and it would make a good story
now...Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was a smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier ones to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; died from emphysema ... caused by the radiation he had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; received for lung cancer treatment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatment. An interesting read would be of the early uses of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such treatments and the damage done while the medical people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were learning to use it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioning Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and early television. I remember he was involved in a pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bad airplane crash, breaking mucho bones and putting him out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for a while.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He did pretty well for not having any other talent than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chatting up folks and &quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where would we be if we didn't have Durwood Kirby?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My Heavens, there are a couple of names from the trendy times
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio and television.  I had forgotten about them -- and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought of Robert Q. Lewis about the time I was reading
&quot;Durwood
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kirby.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would watch late night TV if we had someone like Steve Allen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or Jack Parr on it.  I think Carson spanned the period between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting guests and just hype for some person's next big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Parr was the last of these guys who would bring people in off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the street and talk with them.  He was so disarming.  And he
was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the last to have raconteurs.  Alexander King was my favorite.
I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; saw him on Parr many times and because of that, I read his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I loved the Parr show...I kid you not. Also Steve Allen.
Remember
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Man In The Street? Tom Poston was on that skit. He died a
few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks back.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And did you know that he and Susan  Pleschette (Newhart) got
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; married in their later days.  What a romance that must have been.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There had to be something very satisfying about marrying an old
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; friend and working partner.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well...it would have been for me...if it was Susan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pleschette...though she was pretty rough and would have made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mince-meat outta' me.  (Being mince-meat shouldn't be that bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should it?)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying Tom Posten and Susan Pleschette were married? I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never new that. Susan Pleschette was a regularly reoccuring guest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the Johnny Carson show way back when...guess they were Buds.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom Poston was a recurring guest on the earlier Newhart show.  As I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remember, he was a forest ranger, lumber jack, or something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She used to talk about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leg for his home field of Teterbourgh, NJ, an airliner had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem and Godfrey was told to make another circuit of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traffic pattern.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This made him mad and Godfrey stayed in the traffic pattern
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until the base leg-to-final turn, elongated it, and flew his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DC-3 right in front of the towers windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FAA gave him hell for this.  He was fined and they banned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him from Teterbough and made him move his operation to another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; field. Then Godfrey got on the FAA's case and said on a major TV
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interview that America needed the SST like they needed more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chunks of rocks from the moon.  The US SST program was doomed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately.  Nixon was not pleased.  &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other note -- and it would make a good story now...Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was a smoker big time until he had hip replacement (one of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; earlier ones to do this) and he later had lung cancer.  He died
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from emphysema ... caused by the radiation he had received for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lung cancer treatment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had an aunt who nearly died directly from radiation treatment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting read would be of the early uses of such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; treatments and the damage done while the medical people were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning to use it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am babbling again, aren't I...jeez!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah. I figured I would be pushing one of your buttons by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioning Godfrey. I was aware of his significance in radio and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; early television. I remember he was involved in a pretty bad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; airplane crash, breaking mucho bones and putting him out for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When ever I think about Godfrey I also think about Gary Moore. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did pretty well for not having any other talent than chatting up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; folks and &quot;discovering&quot; a lot of entertainers. Where would we be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if we didn't have Durwood Kirby?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My Heavens, there are a couple of names from the trendy times of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio and television.  I had forgotten about them -- and I thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Robert Q. Lewis about the time I was reading &quot;Durwood Kirby.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would watch late night TV if we had someone like Steve Allen or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jack Parr on it.  I think Carson spanned the period between
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting guests and just hype for some person's next big
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Parr was the last of these guys who would bring people in off the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; street and talk with them.  He was so disarming.  And he was the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last to have raconteurs.  Alexander King was my favorite.  I saw
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him on Parr many times and because of that, I read his books.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I loved the Parr show...I kid you not. Also Steve Allen. Remember
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Man In The Street? Tom Poston was on that skit. He died a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks back.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And did you know that he and Susan  Pleschette (Newhart) got married
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in their later days.  What a romance that must have been.  There had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be something very satisfying about marrying an old friend and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; working partner.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well...it would have been for me...if it was Susan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pleschette...though she was pretty rough and would have made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mince-meat outta' me.  (Being mince-meat shouldn't be that bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should it?)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying Tom Posten and Susan Pleschette were married? I never
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new that. Susan Pleschette was a regularly reoccuring guest on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Johnny Carson show way back when...guess they were Buds.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom Poston was a recurring guest on the earlier Newhart show.  As I
&gt;&gt;&gt; remember, he was a forest ranger, lumber jack, or something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She used to talk about her husband, which, if memory serves, was a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; big time producer. But I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure could have missed something.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This was an earlier husband, I think. Pleschette and Poston got
&gt;&gt;&gt; married late.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And that provoked me to think about the all time greatest final show
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in television history. The dream sequence of an older Bob Newhart show
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for the finale of the newer Newhart show.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as that scene opened, Bettie burst out laughing.  I got the
&gt;&gt;&gt; joke just before Pleschette turned over toward Newhart.  (Mary Fran,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Newhart's second &quot;wife,&quot; was a better ensemble actress than I think
&gt;&gt;&gt; she was given credit for.  Anyone wanting to study acting should watch

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you mentioned Harry, for some reason I immediately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thought of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harry

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vonzell. I know I don't have to tell you he was the announcer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; George

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Gracie.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember him, and Jack Benny had Don Wilson.  Those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were such good voices -- and for a medium that required it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Those were the Ed McMahons of radio.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember how disappointed I was when I saw William Conrad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (radio Marshal Dillon) in  a movie.  Short, fat, and in one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scene in Africa, he was to assume a commanding body
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posture...which is hard to do if you are three feet tall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He spread his legs and crossed his arms across his chest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defiantly...only his hands couldn't go inside his elbows.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They just slid on by and his hands popped free.  He tried it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again but slower and it was not going to work with the tight,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short-sleeve shirt limiting what flexibility he had...so he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just folded his arms across his chest without interlocking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them.  He did not look authoritative

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  He looked like a  pigmy's sarcophagus.  Still, he had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good voice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then I started thinking about Our Miss Brooks. Eve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arden...talk about a perfect transition from radio to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; television.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So true.  I have quite a few of her programs on tape and DVD.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you ever listen to Authur Godfree? I did. I also watched his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; early television shows. I remember seeing him fire Julias La
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rosa on the air for being drunk.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember him more from radio than from TV.  He is made fun of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot but this comes from his last egomaniacal days.  He helped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of people be discovered and the list of these names is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unbelievable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey had live radio and TV programs going on the same day and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; near every day of the week.  CBS owner, Palley, hated him; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CBS president loved him...because his shows were cheap to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; produce and they brought in a lot of money.  His big production
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shows cost what cheap game shows cost, yet for three years this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one guy brought in 12% of CBS's annual income.  For something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like eight years, it was over 8%.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The people Godfrey discovered were supposed to be a part of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;on air&quot; family but Godfrey was always on the air.  (Lawrence
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welk had a little bit of this in him, as well.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey required &quot;his&quot; people get dental make overs, go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dancing classes, etc., but La Rosa's problems started when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started &quot;seeing&quot; one of the McGuire sisters, who were other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;little Godfreys.&quot;  Then La Rosa had a big hit record produced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; independently of Godfrey, and the last straw was when La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hired an agent/manager.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;  Godfrey was everyone's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent/manager/counselor/Big Daddy.  Then La Rosa didn't show up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for dance classes.  &lt;g&gt;  Godfrey was already mad at his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show-band because the leader/owner of the band had used the band
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to back La Rosa on some recordings and no one had asked Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if that was OK.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey told the CBS president he (Godfrey) was firing La Rosa
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the air because he had hired him on the air.  The president
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (it is said) agreed.  Later, Godfrey said it was the president's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea.  I doubt this, but the president would agree to do about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything the vindictive 12%er wanted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Julius was fired because &quot;he had lost his humility&quot; Godfrey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said. The press knew Godfrey and they started hitting on him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty hard because Godfrey was as far from humble as a fellow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could get.  He wasn't like his public persona.  (Two weeks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; later, he fired the entire band...but not on the air.  They came
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in for a rehearsal and the replacement band was already set up.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Godfrey was a pilot and his number and type of aircraft (for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day), would rival Travolta's, but once Godfrey was on downwind

My solution to this is actually pretty easy.  1) Save the radio for Giants
games broadcast on KNBR (680AM out of San Francisco) or 2) put it on KMBH
840AM, the local &quot;Music of Your Life&quot; station.  Lots of Jazz vocal, some big
band, some easy listening, some Barbara Streisand, Michael Feinstein,etc.
Most of it seems appropriate to that radio some how. ;-)

Interestingly, the radio cabinet has a bookcase built in to the side.  It
would make a perfect spot to put a CD player.  And I imagine that it would
be less than difficult for Leroy to include an 1/8&quot; phone jack for an iPod
or an MP3 player.

But then, those additions would ruin the integrity of the original radio.  I
wouldn't care except that the radio is in such great condition now that it
has been restored.  It would seem a shame to start putting in holes just to
add functionality that my computer already has.

Appropos of old radio shows...
Am I remembering correctly that an episode of the Twilight Zone had a plot
with an old radio that played only music and shows from its time?  That'd be
pretty cool. :-)

I modify antiques all the time but not in any way they cannot be put
back like they were...and often in less time than it took to modify
them.  Never put holes in those things but they have vent holes that
wires could run through...the problem with coupling a modern device to
them though is one of impedance (there, I used that word).

The vacuum stuff is high impedance and the xister stuff low.  The
first amps we had were the same ones that Les Paul had.  Tune to an
off station and have the input lead from the wiper of the volume
control with the shield going to ground as close to the wiper as
possible.  This is often the other side of the volume control.

You are right, sports on the radio is the same as yesterday, and a lot
music is, as well.  I have a WWII bomber receiver in this room and it
is often on a BBC station (or WWV).  &lt;g&gt;

It seems funny but most of the a.m. I was listening to 1950s Les Paul
radio shows...and the Light Crush Dough Boys.  All this computer
technology to listen to mp3s of old time radio programs.

Maybe the Twilight Zone radio was picking up original xmissions that
have traveled in space and are looping back after being reflected from
something.

Hah!  I found it!
http://tzone.the-croc.com/tzeplist/static.html
&quot;Ed Lindsay hates television, so he gets his old radio out of the basement
of the boardinghouse where he lives. He soon finds he can receive programs
from the past when he's alone. Vinnie Broun, an old maid he was once engaged
to, believes he is imagining the whole thing. Vinnie gives the radio away to
a junk dealer. Lindsay retrieves it, hoping it will still work. It does, and
when he calls Vinnie into the room, it is a younger Vinnie that appears. It
is 1940, and Lindsay, young again, has been given a second chance.&quot;

Neat!  But I am not so sure I would want to be young and in love in
1940.  &lt;g&gt;  Remember Pearl Harbor!  &lt;g&gt;

Then what age and emotional status would you like to be in 1940?
