A Democratic Congressman is facing assault and battery charges after
an altercation Sunday at Dulles International Airport, outside
Washington.

Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA) allegedly tried to enter a restricted area at
the airport baggage claim and pushed aside an airport employee who
tried to stop him, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports
Authority. Several witnesses told local Washington affiliate ABC 7
news they saw Filner push the employee and refused to leave the
restricted office.

Filner refused to leave the restricted area until just before officers
with the Airports Authority Police arrived around 6 p.m. Sunday, the
airport authority said.

Officers interviewed and released Filner and other witnesses Sunday
evening, but they warned the seven-term congressman that an airport
employee would be pressing charges. Filner is scheduled to appear in
court Oct. 2 in Loudon County, Va., to face the misdemeanor assault
and battery charge.

Filner's office did not immediately respond to RAW STORY's request for
comment. A copy of the release from the MWAA is reprinted below:

&quot;Around 6 PM on Sunday, Aug. 19, Airports Authority Police were called
to the United Airlines bag claim office at Dulles for a report of an
incident with a passenger regarding his baggage. The individual
allegedly attempted to enter an area authorized for airline employees
only, pushed aside the employee's outstretched arm and refused to
leave the area when asked by an airline employee. When MWAA officers
arrived a few minutes later, the man had left the office and was
waiting in the area of a bag carousel. Officers interviewed him and
witnesses and released him. Before the individual left the airport,
officers advised him that the airline employee would be pursuing
charges. The airline employee appeared before a Loudoun County
Magistrate later that evening and a summons was obtained charging
Robert Filner (DOB 09/04/1942) with assault and battery, a class 1
misdemeanor. Mr. Filner is scheduled to appear in Loudoun County
General District Court on October 2.&quot;

Filner should be held accountable for this, and suffer the

There's no excuse for this kind of behavior.  He was elected again in
06.  Let's hope his constituents hold him accountable.

He pushed aside an employee's arm--hardly pushing someone. Like the
Cynthia McKinney debacle, it's a tempest in a teapot, although Filner
does sound as though he may have anger issues.

By the way, assault and battery is a misdemeanor; I wouldn't expect
much in the way of &quot;consequences&quot;.

Did this guy claim he was being singled out by being prohibited from
entering a restricted area because of his race?

That is why Cynthia Moonbat McKinney was so highly criticized....her
ignorance in blaming the cop asking for ID on racism.

We had a flap here a few years ago when a foreign diplomat was in town
and hit a car (he was drunk).  Apparently they cannot be charged with
any crime while in the US...even when they break our laws!  That is

&gt; Officers interviewed and released Filner and other witnesses Sunday
&gt; evening, but they warned the seven-term congressman that an airport
&gt; employee would be pressing charges. Filner is scheduled to appear in
&gt; court Oct. 2 in Loudon County, Va., to face the misdemeanor assault
&gt; and battery charge.

&gt; Filner's office did not immediately respond to RAW STORY's request for
&gt; comment. A copy of the release from the MWAA is reprinted below:

&gt; &quot;Around 6 PM on Sunday, Aug. 19, Airports Authority Police were called
&gt; to the United Airlines bag claim office at Dulles for a report of an
&gt; incident with a passenger regarding his baggage. The individual
&gt; allegedly attempted to enter an area authorized for airline employees
&gt; only, pushed aside the employee's outstretched arm and refused to
&gt; leave the area when asked by an airline employee. When MWAA officers
&gt; arrived a few minutes later, the man had left the office and was
&gt; waiting in the area of a bag carousel. Officers interviewed him and
&gt; witnesses and released him. Before the individual left the airport,
&gt; officers advised him that the airline employee would be pursuing
&gt; charges. The airline employee appeared before a Loudoun County
&gt; Magistrate later that evening and a summons was obtained charging
&gt; Robert Filner (DOB 09/04/1942) with assault and battery, a class 1
&gt; misdemeanor. Mr. Filner is scheduled to appear in Loudoun County
&gt; General District Court on October 2.&quot;

&gt; &gt; A Democratic Congressman is facing assault and battery charges after
&gt; &gt; an altercation Sunday at Dulles International Airport, outside

&gt; &gt; Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA) allegedly tried to enter a restricted area at
&gt; &gt; the airport baggage claim and pushed aside an airport employee who
&gt; &gt; tried to stop him, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports

&gt; &gt; news they saw Filner push the employee and refused to leave the
&gt; &gt; restricted office.

I can't say for sure, but I'd guess diplomatic immunity is reciprocal.

I recall a story about 10 years ago when a diplomat's son hit a car in
Washington DC and caused a fatality.  He was not charged; he was
wisked out of the country.

I agree. Like I have said before though I can be just as harsh on
democrats who do bone headed shit like this as I am on republicans. I
hold our representatives to a higher standard.

&gt; &gt; A Democratic Congressman is facing assault and battery charges after
&gt; &gt; an altercation Sunday at Dulles International Airport, outside
&gt; &gt; Washington.

&gt; &gt; Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA) allegedly tried to enter a restricted area at
&gt; &gt; the airport baggage claim and pushed aside an airport employee who
&gt; &gt; tried to stop him, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports
&gt; &gt; Authority. Several witnesses told local Washington affiliate ABC 7
&gt; &gt; news they saw Filner push the employee and refused to leave the
&gt; &gt; restricted office.

&gt; &gt; Filner refused to leave the restricted area until just before officers
&gt; &gt; with the Airports Authority Police arrived around 6 p.m. Sunday, the
&gt; &gt; airport authority said.

&gt; &gt; Officers interviewed and released Filner and other witnesses Sunday
&gt; &gt; evening, but they warned the seven-term congressman that an airport
&gt; &gt; employee would be pressing charges. Filner is scheduled to appear in
&gt; &gt; court Oct. 2 in Loudon County, Va., to face the misdemeanor assault
&gt; &gt; and battery charge.

&gt; &gt; Filner's office did not immediately respond to RAW STORY's request for
&gt; &gt; comment. A copy of the release from the MWAA is reprinted below:

&gt; &gt; &quot;Around 6 PM on Sunday, Aug. 19, Airports Authority Police were called
&gt; &gt; to the United Airlines bag claim office at Dulles for a report of an
&gt; &gt; incident with a passenger regarding his baggage. The individual
&gt; &gt; allegedly attempted to enter an area authorized for airline employees
&gt; &gt; only, pushed aside the employee's outstretched arm and refused to
&gt; &gt; leave the area when asked by an airline employee. When MWAA officers
&gt; &gt; arrived a few minutes later, the man had left the office and was
&gt; &gt; waiting in the area of a bag carousel. Officers interviewed him and
&gt; &gt; witnesses and released him. Before the individual left the airport,
&gt; &gt; officers advised him that the airline employee would be pursuing
&gt; &gt; charges. The airline employee appeared before a Loudoun County
&gt; &gt; Magistrate later that evening and a summons was obtained charging
&gt; &gt; Robert Filner (DOB 09/04/1942) with assault and battery, a class 1

Perp,

Been that way a long time. Someone with diplomatic imminity is just
that, immune from our laws. Even murder. Flip side is that it works
the same way for own diplomats. That's why so many &quot;spooks&quot; work under
diplomatic cover.

get drunk and run someone over in the streets in another country!

Have you read any books about the CIA?  Drinking was certainly a
problem, but the cover was really to enable them to act with impunity
in other areas!

Obviously, you don't watch CSI: Miami. There was a story line (last
year?) about a diplomat's son who was a murderer, and the main
character, Horatio Caine (David Caruso, who I cannot stand), had him
dead to rights but couldn't do anything about it because of diplomatic
immunity. I looked it up online, since we had a discussion about how
true to life that might be. Apparently, it's a real deal.
