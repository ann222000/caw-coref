My Last Motions to the Board

Kindly put the following eight motions on the agenda for the last
meeting of the current USCF Executive Board

As I and two other board members will be leaving the board and this
will be our last meeting and also because this will be my only board
meeting where there will be a significant audience, I will be making
at least the following eight motions which will in general be repeats
of motions I previously made which were voted down. I want the general
membership to know that at least I tried to set things right during my
one year on the board:

Motion One: Resolved: Executive Director Bill Hall is hereby Censured
and Reprimanded for failing to provide any documents at all pertaining
to the Pension/Profit Sharing Plan.

At my very first meeting on the board on August 14, 2006, I raised the
issue of the Pension/Profit Sharing Plan especially since I had been
informed by a financial insider that there had been misconduct in
connection with the plan, money due and owing under the plan had not
been paid and in one case money had been put into the general
operating account in anticipation of being paid but had never been
paid and had simply been absorbed by operating expenses.

I was told at the August 14 meeting that this was not true and that
everything was hunky dory now, but nevertheless I continued to press
for documents pertaining to the plan. Also, there was a report that
one former employee was paid twice or double-paid.

Since then, at every meeting of the board and in numerous BINFOS in
between meetings, I have demanded documents pertaining to the plan.
There have been persistent reports of people being owed money and not
being paid and conversely of people being paid money that they were
NOT entitled to receive.

As of yet, I have not received any documents at all, not even one
sheet of paper, in spite of my persistent requests for documents. It
is obvious that our Executive Director Bill Hall is stonewalling and
has no intention and has never had any intention of sending me any
documents.

This is not a minor matter. As a member of the board, I am a trustee
of the plan which means that there could be criminal penalties
including JAIL TIME for failing to play former employees the pensions
to which they are entitled. By making this motion I want to have it on
the record that I am in no way involved in this and that if anybody
goes to jail it will be the other board members and not me.

Motion Two: Bobby Fischer USCF Membership

The by-laws passed twice the last time being in 1992 on a motion by
Joe Lux states that all chess players recognized by FIDE as USA
Grandmasters are USCF members.

As can be seen on the FIDE website, Bobby Fischer is listed as a USA
Grandmaster:
http://www.fide.com/ratings/card.phtml?event=2000016

It is the ultimate arrogance of this board that it has ignored this
delegate mandate. This shows the disregard that members of this board
have consistently displayed towards the rules as set forth by the
delegates. To date, Bobby Fischer still is not listed on the
USCHESS.ORG website as a USCF member. In particular, Mr. Goichberg and
Mr. Channing have spoken against listing Mr. Fischer as a USCF member.

I note that my first motion on this matter was passed at the meeting
on August 14, 2006. Robert Tanner and Beatriz Marinello voted in favor
and it passed. At the next meeting in Stamford Connecticut, I noted
that it still has not been implemented and called for another vote on
this. However, Robert Tanner by then had left the meeting early and
without his vote it failed. Mr. Tanner resigned shortly thereafter.

It is obvious and apparent that it is due to personal prejudices that
Mr. Goichberg and Mr. Channing have towards Mr. Fischer that they keep
voting against this motion and therefore it fails. I am renewing this
motion so that the entire world can witness the prejudices that Mr.
Goichberg and Mr. Channing hold which stops them from carrying out
their duties towards Mr. Fischer and towards chess in general.

Motion Three: Larry Evans Issue

The first act of our current editor Dan Lucas was to fire Larry Evans,
who is the most popular columnist the USCF ever had and who has been a
regular columnist in Chess Life since January 1953. It is apparent
that this firing was because one member of the board who is close to
Mr. Lucas does not like Larry Evans. At each meeting of the board, Mr.
Lucas has been politely asked by the other board members to fully
reinstate Larry Evans, yet the editor has refused to do. With this
motion, we are no longer asking, we are directly ORDERING the Chess
Life editor to fully reinstate Grandmaster Evans. If Mr. Lucas still
refuses to reinstate Grandmaster Evans, he can look for another job.

Motion Four: Ratings of Olympiads and Other Major Events

The major point in my grand plan to increase the reach of the USCF and
ultimately to bring us more members and more money is to bring into
the rating system the major international events, like the World
Championship events, major tournaments like the Aeroflot Open and the
Reykjavik Open and the Olympiads. The purpose is to give all the top
level super-grandmasters in the world a USCF rating and ID number,
thereby encouraging those players to come to the US and compete in our
tournaments and also to increase the prestige of our rating system.
There is also a secondary purpose which is to discourage some of these
foreign top level players from sneaking into the lower class sections
of our tournaments to win big money.

Not only will this bring us more prestige, it will bring us more
money. Already several of the First Saturday tournaments in Budapest
Hungary have been USCF rated and the organizer there, Mr. Nagy, has
stated that he will gladly pay rating fees to have all of his
tournaments rated. There is no doubt that many organizers around the
world will be more than willing to pay rating fees to have their
tournaments rated. I have spoken to Walter Brown (not the grandmaster)
who would be the one doing the actual work on this project and he
states that he would be willing to do this and this would not be a
problem. The fact that the board keeps voting this down in spite of
the obvious benefits demonstrates in my view the small mindedness,
narrow mindedness and lack of imagination that this board has.

Motion Five: The Executive Director is hereby directed to purchase a
three-chip camcorder which will be a SONY 2100 or equivalent at an
estimated cost of less than $2300 and will be used to video broadcast
on youtube and elsewhere meetings of the board and major events such
as the National Elementary Championship. The purpose of this
expenditure will be both to give the general membership the impression
(however false) that the board is trying its best to deal with the
problems facing the federation and to promote our events and get more
kids to play.

I made this motion at the meeting in Stamford. It was not voted on
because Bill Hall agreed to do it. Like everything else that Bill Hall
agreed to do, it was never done, and thus I am making this motion
again.

Motion Five: Bill Hall Censured for failing to provide the tapes of
the August and November board meetings to Terry Vibbert for posting on
the website and also commending Terry Vibbert for his fine work in
posting all of the May meeting and part of the February meeting on the
website.

A lot of things happened during the August and November meetings and I
can fully understand why Mr. Hall would be embarrassed by those events
and would want to cover them up. However, we want to lure the general
membership into the belief that it is not the board that is engaged in
a cover up and so therefore I move that we censure Bill Hall.

Motion Six: Irina Krush Tournament of Girl Champions

Irina Krush is our highest rated active woman tournament player and
our champion and at age 23 she is rapidly improving. How many people
even know that she defeated US Champion Alexander Shabalov in a
tournament game in June? She has had a tremendous streak of
spectacular tournament results this past year and she is getting
better all the time. Therefore, I move that the USCF Establish an
Irina Krush Tournament of Girl Champions to be played every year at
the same time and location as the US Open Championship and the Denker
Tournament.

Motion Seven: Censure Bill Hall for failing to conduct and report an
inventory of USCF Files and Records and Commending and thanking Donna
Alarie for her efforts to recover the records.

During my first meeting of the board on August 14, 2006, it was
revealed that almost all financial records and other records of the
USCF are lost or destroyed. Bill Hall later stated that 125 storage
boxes has been located in a storage bin in Crossville. In a BINFO,
Bill Hall was directed by the VP of Finance Joel Channing to take an
inventory of the contents of these storage boxes and provide this
inventory to the board.

Bill Hall never did it.

Donna Alarie went through some of the storage boxes in the storage bin
in January and found that they were covered with dust and dirt and
obviously had not been looked at in a long time.

I hereby move that Bill Hall be censured for failing even to begin to
carry out this directive from the board and to thank Donna Alarie, an
unpaid volunteer, for attempting to do the job that Bill Hall was
being paid to do but did not do.

Also, a well-known grandmaster has asked me to locate the Quark
Express files for his Chess Life columns that he wants to make into a
book. I have been reliably informed that these computer files are in
the Crossville Landfill. I hereby request that someone be sent to the
landfill to recover the files on behalf of the grandmaster. Also, I
would like to know what happened to the morgue of old photographs and
other documents to be used in Chess Life which were previously in New
Windsor until that office was closed by order of Joel Channing. Are
those files in the Landfill too?

going to Laszlo's tournaments in Buda. He told me once that it was
inexpensive for players to go there from around the world, and expense would
seem to be the main attractor - holding cheap norm tournaments in the US is
surely a preferable goal than sending US players to Budapest.

&gt; &gt; Not only will this bring us more prestige, it will bring us more
&gt; &gt; money. Already several of the First Saturday tournaments in Budapest
&gt; &gt; Hungary have been USCF rated and the organizer there, Mr. Nagy, has
&gt; &gt; stated that he will gladly pay rating fees to have all of his
&gt; &gt; tournaments rated.

&gt; (4... even more...) I bet he would! - but this is the opposite tack to
&gt; attracting players here, since more and more US and Canadian players are
&gt; going to Laszlo's tournaments in Buda. He told me once that it was
&gt; inexpensive for players to go there from around the world, and expense would
&gt; seem to be the main attractor - holding cheap norm tournaments in the US is
&gt; surely a preferable goal than sending US players to Budapest.

&gt; &gt; Motion Five: The Executive Director is hereby directed to purchase a
&gt; &gt; three-chip camcorder which will be a SONY 2100 or equivalent at an
&gt; &gt; estimated cost of less than $2300 and will be used to video broadcast
&gt; &gt; on youtube and elsewhere meetings of the board and major events such
&gt; &gt; as the National Elementary Championship. The purpose of this
&gt; &gt; expenditure will be both to give the general membership the impression
&gt; &gt; (however false) that the board is trying its best to deal with the
&gt; &gt; problems facing the federation and to promote our events and get more
&gt; &gt; kids to play.

&gt; &gt; I made this motion at the meeting in Stamford. It was not voted on
&gt; &gt; because Bill Hall agreed to do it.

&gt; (5) What? How can he agree to do something not voted on? I pass on
&gt; commentating on the efficacy of this attempt (however false) to communicate
&gt; anything at all.

&gt; &gt; Like everything else that Bill Hall
&gt; &gt; agreed to do, it was never done, and thus I am making this motion
&gt; &gt; again.

&gt; &gt; Motion Five: Bill Hall Censured for failing to provide the tapes of
&gt; &gt; the August and November board meetings to Terry Vibbert for posting on
&gt; &gt; the website and also commending Terry Vibbert for his fine work in
&gt; &gt; posting all of the May meeting and part of the February meeting on the
&gt; &gt; website.

&gt; &gt; Motion Six: Irina Krush Tournament of Girl Champions

&gt; &gt; I move that the USCF Establish an
&gt; &gt; Irina Krush Tournament of Girl Champions to be played every year at
&gt; &gt; the same time and location as the US Open Championship and the Denker
&gt; &gt; Tournament.

&gt; aut Caesar aut nihil! aut mors aut victoria! I thought the confidence of the
&gt; chess community to various parties administering scholastics events was well
&gt; known?

&gt; &gt; Motion Seven: Censure Bill Hall for failing to conduct and report an
&gt; &gt; inventory of USCF Files and Records and Commending and thanking Donna
&gt; &gt; Alarie for her efforts to recover the records.

&gt; &gt; During my first meeting of the board on August 14, 2006, it was
&gt; &gt; revealed that almost all financial records and other records of the
&gt; &gt; USCF are lost or destroyed. Bill Hall later stated that 125 storage
&gt; &gt; boxes has been located in a storage bin in Crossville. In a BINFO,
&gt; &gt; Bill Hall was directed by the VP of Finance Joel Channing to take an
&gt; &gt; inventory of the contents of these storage boxes and provide this
&gt; &gt; inventory to the board.

&gt; &gt; Bill Hall never did it.

&gt; (7) While this may or may not be censorious behavior, can just anyone ask
&gt; the Ex Dir to do anything - without the board deciding on it? As above, if
&gt; the issue was deemed /urgent/ by the board should some time-line be
&gt; associated with the activity? If the matter was deemed /important/ by the
&gt; board, should they not have assessed the time it would take to inventory 25
&gt; archived boxes, and approved salary to do so?

&gt;  &gt; Motion Eight: Commenting Tim Tobiason for scanning and converting to

&gt; &gt; DVD format back issues of Chess Life newspaper.

&gt; (8) Yes, though I imagine that Mr. Tobiason would not like to be commented
&gt; upon, though if anyone were to commend him, he may well be pleased!

&gt; Phil Innes

&gt; &gt; Please put these eight motions on the agenda.

Bruce, allow me to introduce you to &quot;Rob Mitchell&quot; who, by fantastic
coincidence, has one of the most common names known to exist and
therefor is untraceable.

You will be seeing a lot of &quot;Rob Mitchell&quot; as he attacks me

An excellent question.

My theory is that he wants to overthrow the USCF and start a new
organization headed by himself, perhaps in conjunction with Innes.

He has indicated this several times.

And so how is joining your Yahoo-FIDE discussion group going to help
him overthrow USCF and start a new organization?

Also how is posting attacks on you on RGCP going to help him
accomplish that if that is his goal?

If there is a vacuum, why doesn't he just fill it? If not, he wouldn't

Why does he need to overthrow an organization that, according to his
posts, hasn't functioned in years? He and his polymath - or is it
polymouth? - friend Innes could start such a group, but mere air never

&gt; &gt; &gt; My Last Motions to the Board

&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly put the following eight motions on the agenda for the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting of the current USCF Executive Board

&gt; &gt; I have removed the prologia and exponential explanations, to leave the 8, as
&gt; &gt; proposed:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Motion One: Resolved: Executive Director Bill Hall is hereby Censured
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Reprimanded for failing to provide any documents at all pertaining
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the Pension/Profit Sharing Plan.

&gt; &gt; (1) Has Mr. Hall been requested in writing to provide information to the
&gt; &gt; board as a result of the board's previous instruction to him, and by a
&gt; &gt; particular time? Has he made over response to this putative document, such
&gt; &gt; as, for example, on the possibility of achieving the board's directive
&gt; &gt; within the time stated?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Two: Bobby Fischer USCF Membership

&gt; &gt; &gt; The by-laws passed twice the last time being in 1992 on a motion by
&gt; &gt; &gt; Joe Lux states that all chess players recognized by FIDE as USA
&gt; &gt; &gt; Grandmasters are USCF members.

&gt; &gt; (2) RJ Fischer does not wish to be listed as a USCF member. Phil Innes,
&gt; &gt; Tuesday July 31, 2007, and is already on record as regretting USCF's linkage
&gt; &gt; his name with the organisation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Three: Larry Evans Issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; With this
&gt; &gt; &gt; motion, we are no longer asking, we are directly ORDERING the Chess
&gt; &gt; &gt; Life editor to fully reinstate Grandmaster Evans. If Mr. Lucas still
&gt; &gt; &gt; refuses to reinstate Grandmaster Evans, he can look for another job.

&gt; &gt; (3) Does this mean that GM Evans should be offered his previous column,
&gt; &gt; notwithstanding any demurrer by the editor?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Four: Ratings of Olympiads and Other Major Events
&gt; &gt; &gt; The major point in my grand plan to increase the reach of the USCF and
&gt; &gt; &gt; ultimately to bring us more members and more money is to bring into
&gt; &gt; &gt; the rating system the major international events, like the World
&gt; &gt; &gt; Championship events, major tournaments like the Aeroflot Open and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Reykjavik Open and the Olympiads. The purpose is to give all the top
&gt; &gt; &gt; level super-grandmasters in the world a USCF rating and ID number,
&gt; &gt; &gt; thereby encouraging those players to come to the US and compete in our
&gt; &gt; &gt; tournaments and also to increase the prestige of our rating system.

&gt; &gt; (4) These activities are already part of Fide's system, and in fact Fide's
&gt; &gt; system is coming here! The arguments are therefore that USCF should not
&gt; &gt; remain within Fide, but compete with it, if this should indeed be thought
&gt; &gt; sufficient to attract players from around the world. I also notice no
&gt; &gt; budgetary numbers attached to such an activity for Super-GMs, which I
&gt; &gt; presume means 2700+.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is also a secondary purpose which is to discourage some of these
&gt; &gt; &gt; foreign top level players from sneaking into the lower class sections
&gt; &gt; &gt; of our tournaments to win big money.

&gt; &gt; (4... continued) I understodd the first clauses above to mention Super-GMs,
&gt; &gt; but do we see here another idea? That these 2700+ players would not be
&gt; &gt; recognised in a super-tournament lower-class section?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Not only will this bring us more prestige, it will bring us more
&gt; &gt; &gt; money. Already several of the First Saturday tournaments in Budapest
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hungary have been USCF rated and the organizer there, Mr. Nagy, has
&gt; &gt; &gt; stated that he will gladly pay rating fees to have all of his
&gt; &gt; &gt; tournaments rated.

&gt; &gt; (4... even more...) I bet he would! - but this is the opposite tack to
&gt; &gt; attracting players here, since more and more US and Canadian players are
&gt; &gt; going to Laszlo's tournaments in Buda. He told me once that it was
&gt; &gt; inexpensive for players to go there from around the world, and expense would
&gt; &gt; seem to be the main attractor - holding cheap norm tournaments in the US is
&gt; &gt; surely a preferable goal than sending US players to Budapest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Five: The Executive Director is hereby directed to purchase a
&gt; &gt; &gt; three-chip camcorder which will be a SONY 2100 or equivalent at an
&gt; &gt; &gt; estimated cost of less than $2300 and will be used to video broadcast
&gt; &gt; &gt; on youtube and elsewhere meetings of the board and major events such
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the National Elementary Championship. The purpose of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; expenditure will be both to give the general membership the impression
&gt; &gt; &gt; (however false) that the board is trying its best to deal with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems facing the federation and to promote our events and get more
&gt; &gt; &gt; kids to play.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I made this motion at the meeting in Stamford. It was not voted on
&gt; &gt; &gt; because Bill Hall agreed to do it.

&gt; &gt; (5) What? How can he agree to do something not voted on? I pass on

&gt; &gt; &gt; the website and also commending Terry Vibbert for his fine work in

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motion, we are no longer asking, we are directly ORDERING the Chess
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Life editor to fully reinstate Grandmaster Evans. If Mr. Lucas still
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; refuses to reinstate Grandmaster Evans, he can look for another job.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) Does this mean that GM Evans should be offered his previous column,
&gt; &gt; &gt; notwithstanding any demurrer by the editor?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Four: Ratings of Olympiads and Other Major Events
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The major point in my grand plan to increase the reach of the USCF and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ultimately to bring us more members and more money is to bring into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rating system the major international events, like the World
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Championship events, major tournaments like the Aeroflot Open and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reykjavik Open and the Olympiads. The purpose is to give all the top
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level super-grandmasters in the world a USCF rating and ID number,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thereby encouraging those players to come to the US and compete in our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tournaments and also to increase the prestige of our rating system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) These activities are already part of Fide's system, and in fact Fide's
&gt; &gt; &gt; system is coming here! The arguments are therefore that USCF should not
&gt; &gt; &gt; remain within Fide, but compete with it, if this should indeed be thought
&gt; &gt; &gt; sufficient to attract players from around the world. I also notice no
&gt; &gt; &gt; budgetary numbers attached to such an activity for Super-GMs, which I
&gt; &gt; &gt; presume means 2700+.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is also a secondary purpose which is to discourage some of these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foreign top level players from sneaking into the lower class sections
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of our tournaments to win big money.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (4... continued) I understodd the first clauses above to mention Super-GMs,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but do we see here another idea? That these 2700+ players would not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; recognised in a super-tournament lower-class section?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not only will this bring us more prestige, it will bring us more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money. Already several of the First Saturday tournaments in Budapest
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hungary have been USCF rated and the organizer there, Mr. Nagy, has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stated that he will gladly pay rating fees to have all of his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tournaments rated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (4... even more...) I bet he would! - but this is the opposite tack to
&gt; &gt; &gt; attracting players here, since more and more US and Canadian players are
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to Laszlo's tournaments in Buda. He told me once that it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; inexpensive for players to go there from around the world, and expense would
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be the main attractor - holding cheap norm tournaments in the US is
&gt; &gt; &gt; surely a preferable goal than sending US players to Budapest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Five: The Executive Director is hereby directed to purchase a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three-chip camcorder which will be a SONY 2100 or equivalent at an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; estimated cost of less than $2300 and will be used to video broadcast
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on youtube and elsewhere meetings of the board and major events such
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as the National Elementary Championship. The purpose of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expenditure will be both to give the general membership the impression
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (however false) that the board is trying its best to deal with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems facing the federation and to promote our events and get more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kids to play.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I made this motion at the meeting in Stamford. It was not voted on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because Bill Hall agreed to do it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) What? How can he agree to do something not voted on? I pass on
&gt; &gt; &gt; commentating on the efficacy of this attempt (however false) to communicate
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like everything else that Bill Hall
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agreed to do, it was never done, and thus I am making this motion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Five: Bill Hall Censured for failing to provide the tapes of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the August and November board meetings to Terry Vibbert for posting on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the website and also commending Terry Vibbert for his fine work in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; posting all of the May meeting and part of the February meeting on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; website.

&gt; &gt; &gt; [no comment]

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Six: Irina Krush Tournament of Girl Champions

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I move that the USCF Establish an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Irina Krush Tournament of Girl Champions to be played every year at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same time and location as the US Open Championship and the Denker
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tournament.

&gt; &gt; &gt; aut Caesar aut nihil! aut mors aut victoria! I thought the confidence of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; chess community to various parties administering scholastics events was well
&gt; &gt; &gt; known?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Seven: Censure Bill Hall for failing to conduct and report an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inventory of USCF Files and Records and Commending and thanking Donna
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alarie for her efforts to recover the records.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; During my first meeting of the board on August 14, 2006, it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revealed that almost all financial records and other records of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; USCF are lost or destroyed. Bill Hall later stated that 125 storage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes has been located in a storage bin in Crossville. In a BINFO,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill Hall was directed by the VP of Finance Joel Channing to take an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inventory of the contents of these storage boxes and provide this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inventory to the board.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill Hall never did it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) While this may or may not be censorious behavior, can just anyone ask
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ex Dir to do anything - without the board deciding on it? As above, if
&gt; &gt; &gt; the issue was deemed /urgent/ by the board should some time-line be
&gt; &gt; &gt; associated with the activity? If the matter was deemed /important/ by the
&gt; &gt; &gt; board, should they not have assessed the time it would take to inventory 25
&gt; &gt; &gt; archived boxes, and approved salary to do so?

&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Motion Eight: Commenting Tim Tobiason for scanning and converting to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DVD format back issues of Chess Life newspaper.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (8) Yes, though I imagine that Mr. Tobiason would not like to be commented
&gt; &gt; &gt; upon, though if anyone were to commend him, he may well be pleased!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Phil Innes

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please put these eight motions on the agenda.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My Last Motions to the Board

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly put the following eight motions on the agenda for the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meeting of the current USCF Executive Board

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have removed the prologia and exponential explanations, to leave the 8, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proposed:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion One: Resolved: Executive Director Bill Hall is hereby Censured
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Reprimanded for failing to provide any documents at all pertaining
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the Pension/Profit Sharing Plan.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) Has Mr. Hall been requested in writing to provide information to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; board as a result of the board's previous instruction to him, and by a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular time? Has he made over response to this putative document, such
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as, for example, on the possibility of achieving the board's directive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within the time stated?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Two: Bobby Fischer USCF Membership

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The by-laws passed twice the last time being in 1992 on a motion by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Joe Lux states that all chess players recognized by FIDE as USA
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Grandmasters are USCF members.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) RJ Fischer does not wish to be listed as a USCF member. Phil Innes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tuesday July 31, 2007, and is already on record as regretting USCF's linkage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his name with the organisation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Three: Larry Evans Issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motion, we are no longer asking, we are directly ORDERING the Chess
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Life editor to fully reinstate Grandmaster Evans. If Mr. Lucas still
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; refuses to reinstate Grandmaster Evans, he can look for another job.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) Does this mean that GM Evans should be offered his previous column,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; notwithstanding any demurrer by the editor?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Motion Four: Ratings of Olympiads and Other Major Events
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The major point in my grand plan to increase the reach of the USCF and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ultimately to bring us more members and more money is to bring into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rating system the major international events, like the World
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Championship events, major tournaments like the Aeroflot Open and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reykjavik Open and the Olympiads. The purpose is to give all the top
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level super-grandmasters in the world a USCF rating and ID number,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thereby encouraging those players to come to the US and compete in our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tournaments and also to increase the prestige of our rating system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) These activities are already part of Fide's system, and in fact Fide's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system is coming here! The arguments are therefore that USCF should not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remain within Fide, but compete with it, if this should indeed be thought
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sufficient to attract players from around the world. I also notice no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; budgetary numbers attached to such an activity for Super-GMs, which I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; presume means 2700+.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is also a secondary purpose which is to discourage some of these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foreign top level players from sneaking into the lower class sections
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of our tournaments to win big money.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4... continued) I understodd the first clauses above to mention Super-GMs,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but do we see here another idea? That these 2700+ players would not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recognised in a super-tournament lower-class section?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not only will this bring us more prestige, it will bring us more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money. Already several of the First Saturday tournaments in Budapest
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hungary have been USCF rated and the organizer there, Mr. Nagy, has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stated that he will gladly pay rating fees to have all of his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tournaments rated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4... even more...) I bet he would! - but this is the opposite tack to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attracting players here, since more and more US and Canadian players are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to Laszlo's tournaments in Buda. He told me once that it was

You know, this is actually kind of interesting, but if you're trying
to create a &quot;total information awareness&quot; involuntary rating system (a
bad idea if you ask me, but intriguing anyway), you shouldn't stop
with just the top players.  Buy some Chessbase cd-roms instead, and
suck ALL the games into the rating system.

Are you insane?  Since when are you a video export to be telling the

documentation, and promotion) have totally different requirements.
The promotional videos have to be shot by someone who knows what
s/he's doing ($$$$$) or they'll look like crappy home videos no matter
how expensive the camera is, just like an unskilled photographer will
produce crappy snapshots no matter how expensive a still camera they
use.  So leave the camera up to the videographer, who probably wants
to use their own equipment anyway.  And the meeting documentation
videos can be shot with a 20 dollar webcam since they just have to
straightforwardly archive the meeting.

A COMPLETE SURPRISE

I have no idea whether or not GM Evans was interested in continuing
his question and answer column in Chess Life, but he said that Sam's
motion to reinstate him came as a complete surprise. My own view is
that the editor's decision to terminate the column was a big mistake
that hurt the quality of the magazine but that the board should not
tell the editor who to hire or fire.

[quote=&quot;chessoffice&quot;][quote=&quot;jacklemoine&quot;]Notwithstanding the merits
or lack thereof of these motions, doesn't a motion need a second
before it can be further discussed and any action (such as a referral)
taken?[/quote]

No, the Executive Board and its predecessor the Policy Board have
never required a second.  At the much larger USCF Delegates meeting a
second is required.

Bill Goichberg[/quote]

Obviously, with only six members of the board, requiring a second for
any motion would have as its only purpose to stifle dissent.

In this case, Bill Hall was on the line until just the moment when I
started to read my motions. Bill Goichberg had an advance copy of my
motions and warned Bill Hall that I was about to make motions to
censure him for various acts of misconduct. At that point, Bill Hall
took the hint and said that he was signing off so as to get ready to
check out of the hospital. (He was in the hospital for another one of
his foot-toe problems). This was at 11:16 AM. Obviously, Bill Hall
felt that it was more important to check out of the hospital than it
was to do the job for which he is well paid to do, which is attend
these board meetings and provide information to the board.

I would have liked for Mr. Hall to stay on line so that he could
provide his latest pretexts and excuses for failing to send me the
documents pertaining to the pension/profit sharing plan and for his
failure to send the tapes of the August 14 and November 17-18
Executive Board meetings for posting to the governance page (not to
mention the tapes of the February 25, 2007 telephone conference call
which discussed and voted on the proposal to hold the US Championship
in Stillwater, Oklahoma, which has also not been posted).

Unfortunately, the cover-up crowd (The Goichberg Gang) do not want the
Great Unwashed Masses (The General Membership) to know about these
things, and so Bill Hall was allowed to sign off without addressing
these questions.

[quote=&quot;chessoffice&quot;][quote=&quot;samsloan&quot;]The following motions were
voted at the EB meeting on August 02, 2007:

EB07 - 114 - Hall - The Executive Board adds Wayne Praeder to the
Forum Oversight committee. PASSED 4-1 with Sam Sloan opposed.

Bill Hall went offline at 11:16 AM. The &quot;Junior Tournament Membership&quot;
was then discussed.  Bill Goichberg offered the following motion:

EB07 - 115 - Goichberg - Tournament Memberships (TMs)will be revised
as follows: All adult TMs will cost $12, of which $10 can be applied
to a regular adult membership. Junior TMs, of which $5 may be applied
to a Young Adult, Youth, or Scholastic Membership. PASSED 4-1 with Sam
Sloan opposed.[/quote]

Junior TMs will cost $7, of which $5 may be applied to a Young Adult,
Youth, or Scholastic Membership.  As with existing TMs, the Junior TM
includes one issue of Chess Life (Chess Life for Kids for age 12/
below) and the player has 60 days to convert the membership.

There are a large number of nonrated scholastic tournaments, and I
expect that some of these will switch to being USCF rated because the
Junior TM lowers the minimum initial expense for a new player.

I don't expect we will sign up many Junior TMs as the full year
membership is a much better deal.  The main objective of TMs is to
cause more rated tournaments to be held.

Bill Goichberg[/quote]

I am strongly opposed to this, for the reasons I stated in the board
meeting. I think this will end in disaster as almost every kid will
join as a TM. We may even have to shut down and stop publishing Chess
Life for Kids because of this.

Since most kids only play in one tournament anyway, giving them and
their parents the option of either paying $5 or $17 will result in the
obvious decision.

Not only is this another extremely foolish and shortsighted decision
by the Goichberg Gang, I doubt it is even legal. The by-laws state
that only the delegates, not the board, can change the dues. What
gives you the authority to make this major change in the dues
structure at a board meeting?
