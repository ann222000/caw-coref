I've got 2 C16s in my attic for a few months now, and I went up to
have a look at them when the C116 fuse question arose a few days ago.
I got them &quot;as is&quot; for next to nothing. Anyway I finally decided to
give them a test and I couldn't the TV into either of them by the RF
cable.
I switched to an 8-pin to SCART cable (are they supposed to be so hard
to push in?), and there seems to be a signal, but it's just a black
screen with some dim white ghosts moving about on it. Once, and only
once, a screen popped up but it seemed to have the same wonky
character in every screen location and I couldn't get anything to
type.
Any ideas? Usual wonky TED problem?

Your cooked - mine does the same - it is a bad TED.  It makes me
wonder if there are any working C16's or Plus/4 in the world at all.

Crapola. I was actually hoping to scavenge the TEDs for some busted
Plus4s. Well I've 7 Plus4s: 2 deffo bust and 5 most likely bust
(&quot;untested&quot;). Anyone got a shed of TEDs?
It's funny because one of the C16s looks A1, like it was never turned
on.

There are a few here. Approx 50% of the C16's and plus/4's I own are in
working condition.

I had a late model Japanese made Vic-20 that was still wrapped in it's
original packaging plastic and looked to be unused, but it didn't work
properly due to a failed RAM chip.

I read an article once that suggested that non-use of silicon chips can lead
to failure over time but I can't remember the specifics.

Well that's great news isn't it: Underuse and overuse lead to chip
failure.

It might also be the unused electrolytics -- if they're degraded from lack
of applied voltage, a power-on spike could kill a chip.

Constant use at a sustained and constant temperature in a controlled
environment would see the chip last the longest in use.

A bit like this example...

My local flea market had a Plus/4 in it's original box. Don't know if it
worked or not. I'd be afraid to turn it on. Probably the only Plus/4 within
a hundred miles (160 kilometers for the Europeans here) of where I live.
