Reply by email, filling out this form and emailing it to me.
Trimming off the rest of this post is unnecessary.

I will guarantee anonymity except in cases of blatant abuse.
I will achieve anonymity by tallying the results in
uncorrelated tabulations and then deleting the emails.
(I know this loses interesting correlation data, but if
resondents want anonymity it's hard to avoid.)
I know that this anonymity promise depends on trust and that
you have no particular reason to trust me. Someday, I hope.
I will post results Saturday.

people.  A hellish shrieking and wailing broke out and
we saw people dart for shelter in strange stone buildings
erected in the streets.  There was the incessant &quot;crump-
crump&quot; of anti-aircraft shells and fighters droned across
the sky.  Instinctively we ducked as bombs fell from one
of the planes and whistled down.  For a moment there was
a hushed silence, and then whoom!  Buildings leaped into
the air and came down as dust and rubble.
Down in the deep subways of the underground railways,
people were living a strange, troglodytic existence, going
to the shelters at night, and emerging like moles in the
morning.  Whole families apparently lived there, sleeping
upon make-shift bunks, and trying to obtain a little privacy
by draping blankets from any available protrusion in the
smooth tiled walls.
I seemed to be standing on an iron platform high above
the roof tops of London, with a clear view across to the
building which people called &quot;The Palace&quot;.  A lone plane
dived from the clouds, and three bombs sped down to
