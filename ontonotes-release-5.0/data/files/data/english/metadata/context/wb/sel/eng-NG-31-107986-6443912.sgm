I have been making beer for about a year now, starting with kits, then
in the last few months buying ingredients and getting recipes on my
own. My problems is this...my last few batches have been very bitter,
harsh tasting with no real hops flavor, just bitterness. I am using the
same water (Baltimore area tap water, which I know has some sort of
chlorine in it), but this didn't seem to be a problem previously. I use
a steel-enamel pot, around here we call it a crab pot, and the problem
seems to be occuring in the boil. Should I switch to bottled water, or
am I boiling hops too long (variety is usually cascade, yakima magnum
or nugget) using too much, or what am I doing that causes this problem.
Thanks for any help!

There are parts of your water chemistry that can effect the perception of
hops, but I don't know of any recent changes to our water.  What are
some of the recipes you've been making lately?  IMO, I would guess that
you're just using too much hops for the flavor that you prefer.  Have
you been adding any late boil additions, or do all of the hops go in for
the full boil?

One thing that I have noticed with my beers is to allow enough time for
conditioning, whether it be in the keg or bottle.  I usually allow
atleast three weeks conditioning after priming.  I've had beers be very
bitter if I drink them too soon.

I'd start by decreasing boil time for your bittering hops, or use ones lower
in AAUs.  On one brew I substituted 10.5 AAU hops for 6.5 AAU ones I had
used previously used without adjusting the recipe's hop schedule and the
total IBUs were way too bitter for my taste in my old age.  Avoid adding
finish hops too early.  Specific gravity (SG) is also a factor.   If you
know your SG,  IBU calculators are available to determine final IBUs.
Chlorine boils off well before water, so I wouldn't worry too much about
that in your tap water.  Cheers.

But if you don't get rid of it before breweing, you'll form

I agree with what you're saying in general, but just FYI I use the same water
the original poster does, and to be honest I've never done anything special
to account for the chlorine (we might be on chloramine now).  I've never
noticed any problems.  Could just be my taste buds, but it's not something
I worry about with our water.

Yeah, it's certainly possible to have chlorinated water and not have any
problems.  But alos, you never know when they might spike the chlorine
level in response to a particular situation.  A good friend brewed for
years with chlorinated water with no problem.  Then he had a string of
the worst bandaid beers you could imagine.  Turns out the city had
drastically increased the chlorine temporarily.

Typical recipe for me is as follows:
6-7lbs light malt extract
12-16oz victory (steeped approx 30mins@150F)
1.5 oz Cascade@60 mins
1oz Cascade@15 mins
.5 oz at end (steep last 2 mins)
I don't remember AAU (I'm not at home right now to check), but as I
recall, Cascade is usually about 11-13AAU.
Thanks

I agree with you regarding conditioning, and when I started I used to
start drinking within a week or so (basically after it cleared!),
however, I've since decided not to be in such a hurry, and allow at
least 2-3 weeks. Part of this is after leaving it in a secondary for a
week to 10 days, it needs longer to condition &lt;G&gt;.

I had previously been using Fuggles and Kent Golding, but wanted to try
some American hops, most of which do have a higher AAU. Perhaps I will
return to the lower AAU variety hops. Thank you.

Yeah, good point.  Don't they tend to do that based on weather?  I thought
I'd read that in warmer areas they spike the chlorine during the summer
when the pipes in the ground get warm enough to promote bacterial growth.
I don't know if we have that issue around here.

Nothing really jumps out at me as being out of line (although I'm just
eyeballing it rather than putting it through a recipe program, etc).  The
AA% of hops tends to vary season to season.  Maybe the last batch of
Cascade you got was much higher than typical?  Anyone know if the AA% of
Cascades has really spiked recently?

Depending on the AA% of the Fuggles and Goldings you at least doubled
your AA% most likely.  The Fuggles I have are 4.3% and the Goldings are
5.2% so if you are wanting the same bitterness with 10-11% AA hops you
need to cut the amount of hops or the length of boil to compensate.

Different hops have much different qualities, even when just used for
bittering.  I did a bitter recipe three times with different hops
(Goldings, Hersbrucker, and Cascade I think) and they were remarkably
different beers.  No flavor or aroma hops, just bittering hops.  I
would suggest you try new and different hops, but adjust the amount so
the the HBUs are the same as the original recipe.

It generally is during the summer when higher temps lead to more
bacteila growth.  But I don't think I'd rule out the possibility of it
happening other times, too.

You need to become familiar with HBUs...Homebrew Bittering Units/  You
multiply the AA of the hops by the amount.  For instance, 1 oz. of 5 AA
hops gives you 5 HBU.  If you use 10 AA hops, you need only .5 oz. to
achieve the same level of bittering.

The Cascade hops I've seen tend to be a bit higher AA than Fuggles, and
in about the same range as UK Golding, you probably wouldn't have a
drastic change in bitterness with Cascade.  The Nugget and Yakima
Magnum are another story.  There are however other US hops that are not
always alpha monsters: Crystal, Liberty, Mt. Hood, Willammette.

I can think of one other possible reason (besides the hop variety) for
an increase in bitterness:  If you switched from a partial boil to a
full boil, reducing the boil gravity, and increasing hop utilization.
Doesn't sound like the case, though.

Around here, they do it twice each year-- in the spring, and
in the fall.  It's really obvious, at least to me.
I also noticed, the hard way, when my water filter needed
replacing.  Unfortunately, I had brewed two batches within the
space of a week, so I didn't notice the distinct chlorophenolic
tang until they were both finished fermenting.
