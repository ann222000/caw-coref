Part 1
Please see part 0 (template) for warnings and summary.

It starts while he's with the local whore. The day had gone real
good, them having delivered the genseed they'd knocked off from an
Alliance sub-storage station. The plan, the cargo, the money: it had
been a good job all round. Wash said he figured they hadn't been seen
or followed, and now Jayne had a heavy pocket full of coin.

After a celebratory drink with Mal, Zoe, Wash, and hell, even Simon,
Jayne had wandered in the direction of the woman giving him the eye.
They'd gone up to her room above the bar and she'd stripped down all
sexy-like, grinning at him the entire time. Her dress--something fancy
and shiny, tight against all the right parts--had slid right down her
hips as she'd moved in a way that made Jayne's mouth go dry. He'd
shucked his clothes as fast as possible, and then she had pushed him
down to the bed.

She hadn't just settled herself on top of him and gotten down to
business. Instead, she'd gone slow, her feet first sliding along his
legs and the rest of her body teasing him. She'd done little things,
things whores didn't usually do--cupping his shoulders and licking his
earlobe; rubbing his feet and kissing his bellybutton--that made him
wonder if this is what Inara did with her customers. And then, after
straddling his chest and bending so he could suck her nipples, she'd
wiggled down to between his legs, and just sucked him right in.

He hears the first noises while her mouth works him, but he doesn't
pay much attention. She's too damn good, not twitching or gagging as
he pushes her head down a little further and holds her still for a few
seconds. When he lets up, she takes a deep breath and then takes the
hint about what he wants.

The noises get louder, more pressing, but he brushes them off,
concentrating on her warm mouth, sharp little teeth, and deciding
he'll renegotiate with her for the whole night, not just an hour.

He's real close--almost finished--when gunshots start joining the
crashes downstairs. They're enough to make him half sit up but, being
good at her job, she just moves with him and keeps sucking. It ain't
like this bar is a stranger to gunfights, anyway. Teeth scrape him
lightly, and he starts to come, one hand still tangled in her hair.

It's as she's swallowing that the gunshots change to something more
high tech. She pulls away real fast and looking at the door, says,
&quot;Shit.&quot;

He's already standing. &quot;Sounds like Alliance tech.&quot;

Nodding, she stands and hands him his pants. &quot;We don't got a base on
planet. Ain't no reason for them to be here tonight, just to break up
what sounded like a bar fight.&quot;

Ah, hell. Fastening his pants, he says, &quot;Guns.&quot; She hands them to him,
cool as you please. He's pulling on his boots when heavy footsteps
approached the door. He isn't exactly surprised when the door is
kicked open by a couple of Feds.

&quot;Drop your weapons.&quot;

He looks them over and it's tempting to just start firing. Hell, if he
had Vera with him, he woulda just shot right through the door before
they'd kicked it down. As it is, he drops the weapons belt and scowls.

The Feds look him and the whore up and down with disgust and tell her
to get some clothes on.

* * *

They end up downstairs, him still just wearing pants and boots and
missing his guns, her in that slinky little dress and no shoes. Her
hair was pulled back, and she looked real angry.

The bar's full of soldiers and customers and the place is shot to
shit. There're men bleeding on the floor but as far as he can see,
they ain't dead. Still, looks like it was one of the worst damn
barfights ever.

The windows and doors are all covered by soldiers and Jayne knows he
ain't getting out until he's told he can go.

He can't see Mal or the rest of them, but he's pretty damn sure
whatever the hell was going on had something to do with Serenity.

At the head of the room, some tight-assed Fed is in control,
interviewing people. Jayne can't hear what about, but he knows it'll
be his turn soon enough. It's a damn boring wait though, so he starts
talking to the whore.

&quot;You were real good. Was thinking of makin' a night of it.&quot;

She nods. &quot;Wish I was gettin' paid by these bastards, seein' as how
they screwed me tonight.&quot;

His laugh is loud and people turn to look at them. &quot;You ever think of
companionin'?&quot;

Snorting, she shakes her head. &quot;Guild don't take low-borns
like me.&quot;

&quot;We got somethin' in common. Couldn't get a Companion to breathe on
me.&quot;

Her laugh is quieter than his and bitter. &quot;Rich folk.&quot; She spits at
the floor, but it lands on the boot of the Fed walking towards them.

Hell. His mouth twitches.

The Fed looks disgusted but unsurprised. Hoisting his gun, he says,
&quot;You two, you're next,&quot; and leads them up to be interviewed. For once,
Jayne wishes he'd paid attention when Mal talked about Alliance,
'cause then he'd maybe be able to figure out the rank of the Fed
who'll be asking the questions.

She's kind of pretty, for a Fed. Dressed up, she'd maybe give Inara
some competition. Jayne doubts this woman--whatever her rank--can
out-shoot Zoe, though. She's got that look on face that Feds wear
around Jayne's type. It's a look that makes Jayne want to punch
something.

The whore gets spoken to first. &quot;Name?&quot;

&quot;Alice.&quot;

&quot;Occupation?&quot;

Alice sneers. &quot;What the hell does it look like? Dressmaker?&quot;

The Fed sighs. &quot;Do you know anything of wanted fugitives in the area?&quot;

&quot;Nope. I sure know how to make a man yowl, though.&quot;

There's a long pause and then the Fed nods at an underling, and Alice
gets pulled away. It's Jayne's turn.

&quot;And you are?&quot;

&quot;Jayne.&quot;

&quot;Occupation?&quot;

&quot;Odd jobs.&quot;

She raises an eyebrow and looks at her notes. &quot;My men tell me you were
rather well-armed, for an odd job man.&quot;

He shrugs. &quot;You seen this place. You sayin' you'd walk in here without
a gun or two?&quot;

&quot;So you don't work here?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;Please explain the significance of your presence.&quot;

Ruttin' fancy-ass language. Like that makes them better. If he's gonna
be asked questions and kept from a night with the first decent whore
he's had since the brothel job, he might as well get his fun here.
&quot;Hell, I didn't bring no presents. This ain't no social call. I just
brought some coin.&quot;

She sighs and asks, &quot;What are you doing here tonight?&quot; Her words are
slow and deliberate, like he can't follow her meaning. Her expression
clearly she thinks he's got nothing upstairs. He's seen that kind of
look before; mostly from the doc, sometimes from Mal and Zoe.

Glancing over at Alice, who's now talking to what looks to be a
bartender, Jayne smirks. &quot;Gettin' a dress made.&quot; From the look on her
face, he figures the Fed would shoot him if she could. &quot;Can't say I'm
real happy about gettin' interrupted, neither.&quot; He moves forward and
leans down on the table she's sitting behind. &quot;Now I ain't gonna have
nothin' to wear to the ball.&quot;

She ignores the bait. &quot;We're looking for some fugitives. One was maybe
seen here.&quot;

Shit. He knew it. Grinning, he stands up straight again. &quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;Have you seen a Firefly land here recently?&quot; She asks it real
casual-like.

&quot;We ain't got insects here.&quot;

&quot;A Firefly class ship.&quot;

He shakes his head.

Sighing, she asks another question, clearly a last-ditch effort. &quot;Have
you ever heard of a Dr. Simon Tam?&quot;

&quot;Do I look like I'm friendly with any doctors?&quot; It ain't like he's
lying. Hell, even at the best of times he can't hardly stand the doc.

&quot;You don't look like you're friendly with anyone.&quot;

&quot;Ain't you real smart.&quot;

She stares at him hard for a few minutes, but if she figures that's
gonna get him to talk, she don't know squat. He just crosses his arms
and stares right back until she shakes her head, frowning.

&quot;We're done here.&quot; With that, she dismisses him, and he wanders away.

He sets himself up comfortable, leaning against a wall and watching
the Feds. After they talk to a few more people, he moves a little
closer so's he can hear what they're saying. It ain't interesting, not
for a long while. Then the Fed in charge stands up and walks over to
her second. Jayne inches closer.

The Fed is rubbing her eyes, like she's got a headache. &quot;Nothing,
aside from some attitude.&quot;

&quot;So, what now?&quot;

She frowns. &quot;Now nothing. We were tipped off that he was here, but we
wasted time breaking up the fight. If he was here, he's gone now.&quot;

Ah, hell. He don't like the sound of that.

&quot;Did any ships leave or try to leave while we were busy?&quot;

The second nods. &quot;A ship belonging to a Companion. She started making
noises about missing appointments and notifying the Guild.&quot; There's a
little pause. &quot;The higher-ups don't want to disgruntle the Guild.&quot;

Jayne grunts. It gets worse and worse. Ain't much hope that Mal and
the others waited for him.

The Fed is looking around the bar. &quot;Let's get out of this place. It's
making my skin crawl.&quot;

Her second snorts. &quot;Border towns.&quot;

&quot;We're wasting our time out here. They don't want what we have to
offer.&quot;

It sounds to Jayne like an old conversation, one the Fed and her men
have had before.

&quot;Don't let command hear you say that.&quot; The second is smiling a little.
Jayne listens for a bit longer and he figures that the Feds didn't
come here specifically looking for Simon. They were nearby, scouting
out ground for a possible base. It was just bad luck they got tipped
off, but it's the kind of luck Simon brings to them all the time. The
kind that lets him still get away, even if other people's nights are
ruined. Jayne wonders if the Feds will bother with a base now that the
locals ain't so endeared to them.

The Fed is still frowning. &quot;Get the men; we'll head out. Give back
their weapons. Maybe our lives will be easier if the whole damn moon
shoots itself to hell.&quot;

Jayne stands in line to get his guns, then hurries out to the space
dock. Sure enough, Serenity's gone, nothing left behind but the empty
crates Jayne tossed out this morning. Hell.

He heads back to the bar, thinking that when he next sees Mal, he's
gonna kick some ass. Gorram bastard. It's a good thing he didn't spend
all his coin with the whore after all. He'll need a place to stay for
a while, and food. Ammo. Beer.

They better not make him wait long. And he's gonna keep a tally of
what Mal owes him.

* * *

Two days in, he realises he'll need to find some work. The money's
running out fast and there's nothing to do on the rock that doesn't
need paying for first.

Town's called Plenty but as far as Jayne can tell, the question to be
asking is 'Plenty of what?' Things are tight for almost everyone here.
There ain't much work, even with the thriving smuggling trade. Even
farm work is scarce, the season having started late and the rains
failing to come. He's not the only one looking for a job.

Still, he's bigger than the people here and that makes him a better
hire. Most of the men and women looking for work are kinda scrawny and
some of them are starting to look a little hollow around the cheeks.
It makes him wonder if the Feds are going to come in with relief, if
things get much worse.

Probably not. More like they'll just leave people to their own
devices.

He gets a job as a bouncer in the bar. Turns out the guy who usually
had the job got shot up in the fight, and he ain't up for much more
than groaning about the pain right now. The pay ain't good, just
barely enough to keep him in a crappy little room. The job includes
food though, so it could be worse.

It's dull, but keeps him alert. There's no use in getting sloppy while
waiting for the others to get back.

Two weeks in, though, he starts to wonder if they will. Then the Feds
come back and set up a base after all. The official word is that
they're there to monitor the farming situation and offer relief when
and if it becomes necessary. Maybe he's been spending too much time
with Mal, but Jayne's pretty sure that ain't the case.

He doubts they figure that Simon will come back. There's some other
reason for them setting up a base. He don't really care what that
reason is, but he cares that it means Mal won't be picking him up any
time soon.

* * *

Later, when he thinks about it, he remembers it as starting slow.
First, he just took care of a couple troublemakers in the bar. He
figured he'd best do the job good, give the owner incentive to keep
him on when his regular man got over his gunshot.

So, he does the job well. Conscientious, Mal would say. Just like
Jayne was after Ariel; sticking to the rules to keep the job.

He breaks up bar fights, breaks a few faces too. It's fun work and he
gets praise for it. The bar owner is real interested in not having to
replace tables and chairs every few nights, especially after the Feds
shot the place up.

Then one night a couple of mercs set up a ruckus among the whores. The
whores in town are independent, but mostly they rent rooms above the
bar. He doesn't much care what they do or what kind of trouble they
get into, but the owner of the bar, Mr. Winters, he don't want to lose
the rent income if the whores up and leave. That means Jayne's
supposed to keep watch and break up anything that looks to get out of
control.

That night, one girl stumbles down to the bar, her face all messed up
and bloody. It's hard to understand what the hell she's saying, what
with her split lip, but it's enough for Jayne to head upstairs and
check things out.

After he'd broken a couple of arms and thrown the mercs out into the
street, the rest of the whores swarm around him, acting like he's some
kind of hero. It gives him the same kind of uncomfortableness he felt
after the mudder mess, and he tries to tell them his actions hadn't
been anything personal. They were just part of the job. He isn't their
hero. He's just trying to keep good with the boss.

They ignore his words. In the end, it ain't a bad thing. That night,
Alice and her friend Jacob Rao get him singing-drunk and take him to
bed for free. He wakes up the next afternoon with one hell of a
headache, but they chase that away good.

There turn out to be advantages to the local whores seeing a man as a
hero. Aside from the free sex, there are other good things. The town
is small and the whores aren't just workers set apart from the rest of
the townspeople. They're mothers and sisters and brothers, some own
property, and they have their own kind of influence.

The whores like him, especially Alice, who sometimes spends the whole
night in his bed. The bar owner likes him. Pretty soon, most of the
town likes him. He doesn't make friends so much, not that he wants to,
but he stops getting cheated when he buys supplies.

He gets brought home-cooked meals sometimes, when women are happy he
stopped this husband or that brother getting his head smashed in by
some merc looking for trouble. People smile at him on the street, or
at least nod in a friendly fashion, instead of looking away. It's
almost like he's getting respectable, at least to these townsfolk.

It's weird and Mal wouldn't have believed it. Still, Jayne takes what
he can get.

* * *

Sometimes, after sex, Alice likes to talk. It annoys Jayne 'cause he
always just wants to sleep, but there is no use in brushing off the
girl's questions. He wants to keep her good feelings towards him,
'cause he doesn't get paid enough to do her this often at her regular
rates. Anyway, sometimes it's fun to tell her stories about old jobs.

Still, he likes to sleep after sex and so he changes the talking part
to before instead of after.

He drinks, she asks questions, he answers, and after a while, she
starts putting her little hand in all manner of places. They always
end up in her small room after a night of working and after they'd
both cleaned up a little.

Tonight, he's on her bed, leaning against the wall, and her head is
against his thigh. Weird, but he let her be.

&quot;Do you miss 'em?&quot;

Drinking from the glass, he shrugs. &quot;Can't say.&quot;

&quot;You're waitin' for 'em though.&quot;

This time he nods.

&quot;D'you like bein' in space? All that emptiness around you?&quot; She looks
a little unsettled, the way some landfolk do. He thinks maybe he
looked a little like that, first time he signed onto a ship.

&quot;Don't care one way or another. Long as there's a decent mechanic and
I got my own bunk, one place is as good as any other.&quot;

&quot;You'll go back to your old ship when they come and get you.&quot;

He looks down at her suspiciously, wondering if she's gotten it into
her head, against all sense, to get attached. As far as he can tell
though, it's just a statement. She ain't givin him none of them sappy,
sad looks like he'd seen on Kaylee's face when there was talk of Simon
leaving.

Alice knows better than to get all starry-eyed, especially over a man
like Jayne. He nods at her and grins when she asks to hear the story
about the mudders. She likes the song the best, and once, on a night
off, taught it to some of the others: whores, customers, bar folk.

* * *

The town got word that the Magistrate's daughter had been stolen. The
Magistrate lived in the capital of the moon, rarely bothering with the
lives and concerns of the folk in the outlying towns. Nobody Jayne
knows has good or bad things to say about the man. They did enjoy a
good laugh about how the man's personal forces had been less than
successful.

Jayne shrugs off the news and applies himself to breaking up a fight
over what looks to be a nice little gun. The men--smugglers, from the
look of them, and not like to be around for more than a few days--get
told they ain't welcome back, and Jayne pockets the gun. The job ain't
much, but it has its advantages. When the ruckus is over, he thinks
about the girl and figures the Feds will find her.

Later that night, after four fights and a hell of a squabble between
one of the whores and a customer, he hears the Feds turned the job
down. The Magistrate isn't real well-liked by them, having maybe
leaned a little too close to the Independent side during the war. And
anyhow, he hears, the Feds ain't there to chase after random folk who
probably just want a ransom. That's for local forces, they said.

By the time it's near to closing, there's been lots of talk about the
Feds' attitude. People recalled the disruptions from months before and
cursed the new base, remembering how Tommy Dolan had got himself
crushed while helping with its construction.

Tommy had been popular around town. Storekeepers, barkeeps, mechanics,
even the whores, they'd all liked him. Hell, even Jayne had thought
the boy wasn't too annoying. Gorram Alliance. They had the fancy tech,
but from what Jayne heard, they'd been right cheap with construction
costs.

There's some sympathy now for the Magistrate. Near as Jayne can
figure, this is fueled partially by the beer people had been drinking
now for hours. The booze makes them see the Magistrate as just another
guy screwed by the Alliance. He shakes his head at that. Magistrate's
still rich. Jayne doesn't right care if the man is missing his daughter.

What he does care about is that there's a reward for the girl.

Last word was that she and the men who had her had headed out to the
desert. Jayne figures there's ship hiding there. If not, then the
kidnappers're crazier in the head than River on a bad day.

He also figures he could track through desert. Ain't hard if a body
knows what to look for. And hell, he knows better than most.

When the sun comes close to rising and the bar shuts down for the day,
Jayne heads to his little room and gets together the weapons he had.
Looking over the meager supplies, he briefly mourns the supplies still
on Serenity. Vera would be useful right about now, and he had some
perfectly balanced throwing knives that would come in handy.

He takes his new gun and it turns out that she's a real smooth shot.
Worth fighting over.

* * *

He brings back the girl. She was a right mess when he found her and
just about screamed her head off when he killed the men holding her.
Her mind wasn't all there, he could tell that from looking at her
eyes, but he figured it wasn't for good. She'd be fine when she got
back to her daddy's. He tried to tell her that, but she shrank away,
disgust and fear on her face.

It had made him look down at himself. His clothes were dirty and he
knew his face was, too. A day in the desert on top of a night breaking
up fights meant he weren't exactly pretty. She'd screamed so much when
he tried to get close to her that he'd thought he'd have to pistol
whip her just to shut her up. In the end, she screamed herself out.
Grateful for the silence, Jayne gave her some water, hoisted her up on
his shoulder, and started back to the town.

He'd dropped her after a while and told her to move her own self.

He gets the reward. It's not enough to get off the moon, but he
doesn't want to go anyway. Mal has to be able to find him, else he'll
never get Vera and the others back.

Even better than the reward, he gets another job offer. He imagines
the look that Mal would have on his face and says, sure, he'd take the
job as deputy sheriff back in Plenty. Then him and the Magistrate have
a little talk.

&quot;There's some things we don't pay too much attention to, on this
moon,&quot; the Magistrate says, giving Jayne a look Mal would call
'significant.'

Jayne gets it. The moon might be agricultural in name, but most
folk--including the Magistrate--make part of their living off the
smugglers and their trade. This part is real important, now that the
harvests are failing more regular. No one wants the smuggling to end
any time soon, even with the Feds sometimes making suspicious noises.

&quot;If certain--areas--of the government wish to make arrests and track
illegal doings, then let them.&quot; He pauses. &quot;I trust you to use
discretion when deciding which problems to address.&quot;

Jayne nearly laughs in the man's face. Discretion. Mal would be
choking right now and Wash too, probably. He can imagine how later,
over dinner, Wash would tell the others about the oddness of someone
expecting Jayne to be discrete. They would laugh, some trying to hide
it, others not. He brushes the thoughts away and nods.

&quot;I'd think most of your time would be spent quieting local quarrels
and chasing fugitives when necessary.&quot;

'When necessary' means 'almost never.' They both know it's a job in
name more than anything else. The Sheriff is more interested in the
health of his cows than keeping the local law, and the town hasn't had
a deputy sheriff since before the last one up and joined the
Independents and didn't come back. He'd been Alice's brother.

At the end, the Magistrate smiles and shakes his hand, and Jayne
pretends he doesn't see the man wipe that same hand on his pants
after.

He doesn't see the girl--she had some rich, stupid name like Crystal
or Jasmine--again, but he didn't expect to.

* * *

Things don't change too much with the new job. It means more
cash--legit and otherwise--and more nervous smiles sent his way. But
most nights, he still finds himself busting heads in the bar.

He moves into a better room.

He gets to track them who've pissed off and cheated the locals now and
then, and he even pulls in a 'fugie from a neighbouring moon.

The rains come and with it, a decent harvest. People start to fill out
a little and smile more.

He still wakes up with Alice pretty regular, even if there are plenty
of other options.

The Alliance base gets bigger. More troops come, and Jayne sees them
more and more every day. Nobody knows why, but Jayne remembers Mal and
Zoe talking about Reavers maybe pushing out this way. They'd almost
not taken the genseed job because of it, but then, they'd needed the
money.

He doesn't think too much on it--beyond making sure his guns are
always in good shape--until he starts hearing stories of a couple
crews going out to claim drifting ships and not coming back. Then he
starts thinking about signing on with a new ship, just in case.

But the ships are always luhsuh, with crews whose teeth aren't the
only things missing. He never gets offered more than seven percent and
nobody, he gets told, has his own bunk.

He stays on the moon.

Alice stops working in the upstairs rooms and starts working behind
the bar instead. She stops asking him for his money, but she doesn't
stop asking him questions.

* * *

&quot;Where's the fanciest place you ever been?&quot;

They're in his room, 'cause the place she's sharing ain't got much
privacy. &quot;Ariel.&quot;

Her eyes widen a little, just like Kaylee's did when they landed on
the rutting planet. &quot;Did you see much?'

He'd seen plenty, out getting the uniforms and ident cards that Simon
had wanted. Tall buildings, so tall his neck hurt as he stood looking
up at them. Fancy tech, stuff that little Kaylee would've loved to
take apart and make work better. Rich folk, stepping around him like
he was a particularly unpleasant stain.

The Core. Even thinking the words makes him feel weird inside. It's
the same feeling he always got when looking at the airlock, after that
one time.

&quot;I'd pay good money to see a Core planet.&quot; Her voice is kind of
dreamy, not the way she usually talks. Women. He snorts a little.
Fancy dreams and pretty pictures get in their heads and they get all
sentimental and soft. It's annoying and he remembers her spitting on
the Fed's boot. It makes him laugh; she'd be no good in the Core.

He thinks about screwing up on Ariel, getting stupid about the money.
He's got memories of screams and River so scared he could almost smell
it. Pain in the ass gorram girl, but when she started running from the
screams, he'd almost felt something for her. He wonders if the Feds
have got her and Simon yet; if Mal and Zoe and little Kaylee died
screaming. &quot;Not me. Couldn't pay me enough money to get near that
place again.&quot;

* * *

He has a run-in with the Feds one day, a few weeks after he'd been
made deputy. He's walking through the town, pretending like he has
something to do, when three Feds march up to him. He tries not to show
his surprise when he recognises the head Fed from the bar fight that
got him stranded.

He wonders if she recognises him.

&quot;Deputy Sheriff.&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;I've been looking for you.&quot; She doesn't smile, but gives him an
impatient, businesslike look.

&quot;Shiny.&quot; He might be the local law, but that doesn't mean he has to
pretend he gives a shit about what the Alliance wants.

She pulls out a reader and punches up a report. Flashing it at him,
she says, &quot;A nearby substation has reported the theft of a
considerable amount of protein-vitamin bars and the medical emergency
kits that we provide settlers headed to newly terraformed planets.&quot;

&quot;Huh. That's a real shame.&quot; He grins a little, wondering if maybe Mal
had been behind that job. It's exactly the kind of thing he liked to
pull, once in a while.

She ignores his smile. &quot;It is indeed. I think it would be a greater
shame if we were to find that local townsfolk were complicit in the
smuggling of these goods. The Alliance takes a dim view of our
supplies being redirected for black market profit.&quot; Her eyebrow
twitches slightly. &quot;I am willing to overlook the petty smuggling of
inferior goods. I have no interest if someone ships untariffed
livestock or other supplies through this town. The Alliance does not
have the time or resources to track down every consumable item that
passes through here. We have larger worries.&quot;

He wants to ask if those worries include Reavers, but she wouldn't
answer. She'd probably laugh in his face, scoff at the stories.

She seems to be expecting words from him, so he just folds his arms
over his chest and stares at her. Eventually, she continues,

&quot;However, if I find that these stolen supplies are being sold or
otherwise distributed in this town, it will be unpleasant for all
involved.&quot; She pauses briefly. &quot;And for any law enforcement officer
who might have been less than diligent in his or her duty.&quot;

She must hate being stationed on this moon, if she's looking so hard
for a reason to mess it up. &quot;Huh.&quot; Jayne doubts those supplies will
show up anywhere close to Plenty. Any smuggler worth his cut knows
better than to fence something so close to where the job was pulled.
He nods at her and hopes she leaves it at that.

Mostly, she does. She looks about ready to leave, but then she says,
&quot;You must have been glad to find a job. I'm certain that your position
gets you plenty of invitations to the local,&quot; there's a pause,
&quot;balls.&quot;

He almost laughs, remembering their first meeting. He don't like her
any more now than he did then, but at least she ain't just a superior
attitude.

&quot;I'm sure the job is rewarding too.&quot;

Smirking, he takes out a cigar. &quot;I always wanted to uphold the law.&quot;

The doubtful, unimpressed look she gives him reminds him of Mal. He
can't help but grin a little wider as she turns and walks away.

Once in a while there's a real crime, something that Jayne has to deal
with even if he don't much care about the law. This time it's Lee
O'Halloran, who went crazy and killed his neighbour, Billie Xiang. It
was over something that Jayne can't quite figure out and when Lee was
finished, he ran away into the desert. Don't matter none. Other
neighbours saw it happen and Lee's gonna spend a real long time in the
Magistrate's work crews when Jayne catches up with him.

Not that Jayne much cares one way or another about the killing itself.
Still, Xiang's brother is a bigshot at the docks and he made it clear
he'd throw a ruckus if Jayne just let O'Halloran get away with it. So
Jayne sets out to bring old Lee to local justice.

Turns out the desert gets him first. Jayne's seen plenty of desert,
from the type with a few plants here and there, to the type with
nothing for miles and miles. The desert around Plenty ain't the worst
he's ever seen. There's little stands of scrubby trees here and there,
and some grasses. He's seen dark, scurrying critters dart through the
sand and when he catches one, it makes good eating. Still. It ain't
hospitable and, three days into tracking O'Halloran, Jayne isn't
surprised to find the man dead.

It's stupid, going out to the desert with no water.

Jayne stands over the body and grunts. Hell. What a gorram waste of
his time. He figures it'll take two days to get back, a little less
time 'cause he won't be screwing around looking for tracks.

He looks down at O'Halloran. Things are already starting to eat up his
skin. It's an unlovely sight, but compared to them Reaver victims it
ain't nothing special to look at. Still, it's nothing he's dragging
back for a burial. Turning his back on the body, Jayne heads back to
town.

Two days later and about three miles out of town, he smells the smoke.
It's only a few minutes before he sees it, long trails of black and
grey coming from the direction of the Alliance base. He can't help but
grin as he picks up his pace. As he walks, he tries to figure who
might have done the base in. Maybe the Dolans, getting back for Tommy.
The thought makes him grin wider.

He stops smiling when, on the outskirts of town, he finds the first
body. It's no one he recognises, but he ain't sure he could recognise
anyone looking like that. It ain't hard to figure what does that to a
person.

Reavers.

Moving off a bit, he sits down and thinks about heading back into the
desert. He could survive there for a while and, if not, it'd likely
give him a better death. He sits so long that eventually, he sees a
large, ugly ship enter the sky. The body behind him nags at him
somehow, but he doesn't get up and get moving until hours after that
ship flies away.

He gets back to town and finds things he never wanted to see again.
There's some wailing, but the rest is eerie, creepifying silence.

There are survivors. People are still alive; some of them probably not
for long. He can't decide if he's surprised or not. It makes sense
there are lots of hidey places in Plenty, what with the smuggling.
He's just surprised the Reavers didn't find them all.

He finds Jacob sitting outside the bar, his eyes blank. His hands are
holding something Jayne doesn't want to look too closely at. Soon he
figures Jacob will go the way that settler did, back on Serenity.
Pulling out his best gun, Jayne makes sure that don't happen.

He walks the town. Some of the survivors didn't see nothing, and Jayne
nods at them and moves on. Others gibber and shriek and sometimes come
at him with knives or other crappy weapons. These ones he shoots down
like the freaks they are. One of them is the Sheriff, and Jayne
figures he just got himself a promotion.

Best he can guess is that it was a raiding party. Later, he learns
that the Feds got hit the worst, with the capital next. The Reavers
might have gone into Plenty, but Jayne guesses they weren't too hungry
by the time they got there.

* * *

He organises the burial crew and digs half the graves himself. The
townsfolk look at him like he's some kind of wonder, handling the
bodies. He wants to tell them that it ain't for noble reasons. He
wants off the moon, away from Plenty, and no smuggling ships worth a
man of his talent are gonna land if the docks are full of ugly bodies.

Still, even with the bodies squared away, word gets out that Plenty
got hit by Reavers. The smuggling trickles almost down to nothing.
Jayne finds himself looking at his shiny Sheriff badge and wishing
that a ship bigger than an armpit would land at the space docks. He
doesn't care about getting only 7 percent and sharing a bunk no more.
He just wants the hell off the moon.

The more the people left look at him, like he's some kind of
cold-hearted hero for cleaning up the town, the more he thinks he'd
pay good money, even all his savings, to get away.

He wonders, sometimes, how Alice might have looked at him now.

* * *

It's been hellishly quiet for near to two months when Mal comes back
to get him. The little shuttle is the first ship to land for days, and
the locals look at it with some interest and hope. Not much hope,
though. The town is drying up and them that could leave already have.
Jayne's thought of going himself, but the few ships that landed
weren't taking mercs or passengers and there's nothing for him in the
capital.

He's sitting at the edge of the space docks, so he sees when Mal comes
out of the shuttle. He notes the boxes that he starts to pull out and
after a while, he figures maybe he could go over and help.

When he gets there, Mal nods at him and hands him a crate. It ain't
heavy, just bulky, and when Jayne asks what's in it, he gets told
medicine. The doc had helped them knock off another hospital. There's
a buyer coming that's going to arrive soon, just to pick up the cargo
and lift back off.

&quot;Most folk ain't too keen on landing here since it got hit by
Reavers,&quot; Mal says. &quot;Still, some want to fly way under the radar, and
this place is perfect for that.&quot;
