i recall when reading this conspiracy some time ago, reading this link
http://www.masada2000.org/al-dura.html

and others.

Israel did know . An israeli investigation uncovered that the israeli
army didn't kill him, early on, and that investigation may have even
uncovered that he was shot from a palestinian position, as other
investigations have shown.

But israeli spokesmen covered this up and put out or maintained that
he died in crossfire.

Obviously the israeli government covered this up because had they told
the truth it'd have harmed &quot;the peace process&quot;.

If Israel had killed al dura then that'd have been fine. It's a war,
he shouldn't have been there.

If looking at fighting israel's PR battles, do not presume that the
israeli government shares that goal.  The israeli government is
defending the peace process. Supporting a palestinian state but not
too blatantly, or they won't get votes.

Facts don't matter much to them.
When they wanted to disengage, israel suddenly started saying &quot;the
occupation was wrong and untenable&quot;  (olmert when deputy pm under
sharon, interview on hardtalk). They'd never have said that before.
And when they did, it became OK for the BBC to say it, and boy did you
hear it alot in the first week after that!! I didn't know it was
possible to say occupied so many times in one sentence!

Those that defend israel care so much about history! But notso the
israeli government

us.&quot;

people, even if the people don't want it.&quot;  (consider that in the
context of dividing jerusalem. Likud would do it too)

and from somebody  - YM of SCJM I think.
Ben Gurion also frequently stated (and Barak and Peres quoted it)

This is a sweeping dismissal of any opposition to their policies
and is what all dictators claim.  This is far more dangerous.

i'm concerned that you said Absolutely. And even that you thanked me
for the quotations.

What I posted was repulsive garbage.  I only posted it because it
wasn't quite vomit.

The quotations weren't vomit because vomit is regurgitated, and those
quotes aren't easy to find on the web, so it's unlikely that people
have digested them many times before. Those quotes aren't yet on lists
of Peres quotes for some reason.

The quotations are only even potentially of use, if making the case
against a leftist Peres supporter.  If you are allowing those
quotations or what I wrote about the israeli government, to confirm or
add to what you already know about them, then that's terrible, and it
means that you didn't get it the first million times.

Regarding The Al Dura thing. The reason I posted it wasn't to make a
point. It was merely because it was my memory of some information I
read on the web, that is now not easy to find, and I cannot find. I
had a scanned picture of the israeli investigation statement, and
showed how the israeli government spokesman changed the words.

This is only of use to somebody who is documenting the finer details
of the al dura case. Maybe, maybe, he can follow this up. And if he
can, then maybe somebody interested in building a list of examples of
the israeli government lying pragmatically to protect the peace
process, can use it as another example.  Thus having all the garbage
in one place, without having to constantly post it so it becomes
vomit.

The most suitable response to one of these kinds of  posts of mine on
israel, one that produces no new ideas. Is no response. (unless you
have some information to tag worth documenting, to tag on.  The
purpose is documenting. Because it shouldn't confirm concepts you
already know if you already know it. It should bore you.   Documenting
these things are useless for 99% of people anyway, including you. But
for better and for worse, google's usenet archive is the most reliable
archive on the web.

You are a knowledgeable Torah jew, i've benefited greatly from your
posts on Torah. Even posts which may to you have seemed tedious, are
useful for generations.  So, given your well above average abilities
in Torah, i'm sure you can find better things to post on.

I anticipated that response (or a more logical form of it) and thus I
wrote why I posted it.

I think repulsive garbage(as I defined it), like the fact of the
degeneracy of the israeli government for example, should be known. I
made that clear. I am only against regurgitating it.  Moshe wrote
indicating that he liked the post, but I know that he liked it for the
wrong reasons, and that's terrible.

And it has other implications that are relatively advanced and too
complicated for me to explain to you at this stage in your
understanding- judging by your reply to my post and other threads.
Nevertheless, you are another with good Torah knowledge, better than
mine. And I only add &quot;better than mine&quot; because otherwise you'll read
things in and misunderstand, and give the response I currently
anticipate, so i'll say explicitly here, that i'm not calling you
stupid or me brilliant.

I don't mind you telling me that my post is worthless garbage that
should never have been posted. But at least then have the decency to
specify your criteria, clearly, and apply it to your own posts, and
other peoples'.

A very interesting observation, is that your  sentence, if we examine
it again
&quot;It would then be appreciated in the future if you exercised self-
moderation and don't post repulsive garbage. &quot;

it actually assumes that I am illogical, yet there is really no urge
on your part, to attempt to ask me to resolve it.   You don't ask me
Why I posted what I did if I said it was &quot;repulsive garbage&quot;. You
obviously didn't sit there reading my post trying to resolve how I
could've called my 'repulsive garbage' and posted it.

Do you even think that my reply to the OP, about Al Dura  and shimon
peres, was repulsive garbage? I don't think you do.

If I hadn't called that post 'repulsive garbage' then you wouldn't
have called it that. And you wouldn't have had a problem with it. You
didn't have a problem with - that - post at all, even though you
that's the post you refer to.

Your whole position is so full of logical contradictions and
psychological contradictions, that is why I wrote my third paragraph.
You are not ready for a logical discussion.  And you obviously don't
want to hire me or anybody else, as a psychiatrist, either. So I don't
think we can take this any further.

it much further than it warranted, so I won't be replying again.
