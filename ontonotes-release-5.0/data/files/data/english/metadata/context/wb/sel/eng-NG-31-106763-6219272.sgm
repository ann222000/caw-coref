Halliburton Motto - It's Cost Plus, Baby
By Evelyn Pringle
t r u t h o u t | Perspective

Monday 30 October 2006

Halliburton's contracts for work in Iraq are what's known as cost
plus contracts, meaning that after all the costs for labor, materials
and other expenses are added together, the company makes its profit
based on a percentage of that total.

It certainly does not take a financial genius to figure out that
under the terms of such a contract, a company has every motive in the
world to increase the costs of every project to increase profits.

Since the minute Dick Cheney authorized the no-bid contracts for
Halliburton, the granddaddy of war profiteering has been ripping off
American tax payers left, right, and center through the use of these
cost plus contracts, and another clear-cut profiteering scheme was
recently revealed in testimony at a Senate Democratic Policy Committee
hearing.

On September 18, 2006, Julie McBride, a former Halliburton employee
with the company's Morale, Welfare &amp; Recreation Department (MWR) in
Iraq, testified that "the mantra at Halliburton camps goes, 'It's cost
plus, baby.'"

Ms. McBride was hired as an MWR coordinator in Camp Fallujah at
facilities that organize recreational activities for off-duty troops.

The two MWR facilities she coordinated were a fitness center and an
Internet cafè. The fitness center had gym equipment, pool and ping
pong tables, video games, and a large room for movies, fitness classes
and dances, and the Internet cafè housed telephones, computers, and a
library.

At Camp Fallujah, she testified, she became concerned about several
Halliburton practices and especially with the procedures used to
compile the head count for the MWR Department.

"Funding for the MWR Department," Ms. McBride stated, "was
evidently based, in part, on the head count that Halliburton reported."

She explained that to obtain a head count, each off-duty soldier
who entered the fitness center or the Internet cafè had to sign in,
and that the number of soldiers on the sign-in sheet was referred to as
the "Boots in the Door" count.

She then testified that she and other MWR employees were directed
to use a specific methodology to intentionally inflate this head count
to run up costs, and described how it worked.

"To begin," she told the panel, "each hour, on the hour,
Halliburton staff were instructed to record the number of soldiers in
each of the five rooms of the fitness center, and in the Internet cafè
library."

"In addition," she said, "each person who used any equipment in the
fitness center was required to sign a form."

"This included balls, ping pong paddles, pool cues, board games,
video games, etc.," she noted.

"Further," she testified, "a record was kept of the number of
troops who attended fitness classes or other activities."

At the end of each day, she said, Halliburton instructed MWR
coordinators to prepare a situation report, or "sit rep," to record
what was purported to be the MWR head count for the day.

"To inflate that figure," Ms McBride explained, "the coordinators
began by adding together the "Boots in the Door" count, and the hourly
totals for each room in the fitness center throughout the day and in
the library."

"For example," she said, "I was present in Iraq on February 27,
2005, when the "Boots in the Door" count at the MWR facility in
Fallujah was about 330."

"The hourly count that day," she noted, "for each room was over
1,300."

"These totals were then combined for a fitness center head count in
excess of 1,600," she stated, "or five times the actual number of
troops that came into the facility."

On top of that she said, Halliburton would often add the number of
troops who attended a fitness class or activity, even though each
person had already been counted when he or she came in the door, and
counted a second time in the hourly head count.

In addition, she testified, they would often add on the total
number of equipment items that were checked out that day and sometimes
they would even add the number of towels checked out by the troops.

"One day in February 2005, for example," Ms McBride told the panel,
"179 towels were added into the head count."

On another day in January 2005, she said, they added 240 bottles of
water used by the troops that day.

"Sometimes," she testified, "they used a sum total for the head
count that was higher than the "Boots in the Door," hourly room counts,
activity count, equipment count, and towels count combined."

After adding together all of the numbers to arrive at a "sum
total," she said, coordinators were instructed to throw away the
original "Boots in the Door" figure and the larger total was then
designated as the head count for that day and emailed to Halliburton
administrators who compiled the numbers for all of the MWR facilities
in Iraq.

"There are many other Halliburton MWR coordinators who can verify
this procedure," she told the committee.

Ms. McBride went on to describe how the fraudulent head counts are
used to generate millions of dollars in unearned profits for the
company by running up costs. "By inflating the number of users," she
said, "Halliburton can rationalize a greater need for facilities,
equipment, staffing and administrators than actually exists."

"The additional staffing," she said, "does not benefit the troops,
but it does benefit Halliburton."

"Under its contract," Ms McBride points out, "the more facilities,
equipment, staff and administrators Halliburton can show a need for,
the more profit Halliburton makes."

She said that she also watched Halliburton employees use their
control of the MWR and dining facility requisition procedures to
requisition many items for their own personal use, by claiming that the
items were for the troops.

"I have personally observed," she said, "cases of soda, stacked on
top of each other in Halliburton administrative offices, which
Halliburton employees obtained this way."

She pointed out that the employees not only drank soda free but
they also generated more undeserved profits for Halliburton by running
up the cost of supplies.

"By contrast," she told the committee, "US soldiers who make a
quarter as much, or less, must go to the PX to purchase their soda with
money from their own pockets."

Ms. McBride also described how Halliburton employees exploit
requisitions to obtain luxuries that are not afforded to the troops.
"One example of this," she said, "was a Super Bowl party, for
Halliburton employees only, at taxpayer expense."

According to Ms. McBride, Halliburton requisitioned a big screen TV
and lots of food for employees and thus, under the cost plus contract,
the company even made money off its private Super Bowl party.

Following the party, she said, the Halliburton employees arranged a
live television connection for the big screen TV so that they could
watch more football games.

She told the committee that many Halliburton employees did not seem
to care about the soldiers and often ignored troop requests, or treated
them like an annoyance.

"Those same employees," she said, "indulged their own whims at
taxpayer expense."

She also described methods used by Halliburton to discourages
employees from speaking out about these issues. "It's not easy to stand
up to Halliburton," she told the committee.

"After I voiced my concerns about what I believed to be accounting
fraud," Ms. McBride said, "Halliburton placed me under guard and kept
me in seclusion."

She said her property was searched, and she was specifically told
that she was not allowed to speak to any member of the US military. "I
remained under guard until I was flown out of the country," she said.

In concluding her testimony, Ms. McBride expressed her admiration
and devotion to the US troops in Iraq as well as her purpose in
testifying before the committee.

"During my time at Camp Fallujah," she said, "I came to love the
young men and women in the military, who serve our country so well."

"It was an honor for me to help them in any way," she stated.

"I will never forget their kindness," she said, "and their courage
has inspired me to speak out now on their behalf."

Democrats have promised to end Halliburton's war profiteering in
Iraq as soon as they take control of Congress, and hopefully tax payers
will hold them to it.

HALLIBURTON - THE CLINTON CONTRACTOR
Waxman's second objection concerns the way the company will be paid for

its services. The LOGCAP payment method, known as a cost-plus-award,
calls for KBR to be paid its costs plus a profit of 1 percent.
According to the General Accounting Office, KBR could also earn "an
incentive fee of up to nine percent of the cost estimate, based on the
contractor's performance in a number of areas, including cost control."

In one of his letters to the Corps of Engineers, Waxman says that the
cost-plus-award system is "generally discouraged in the executive
branch because it provides the contractor with an incentive to increase

its profits by increasing the costs to the taxpayer." But in fact, the
cost-plus-award method is an extremely common arrangement throughout
the defense-contracting industry; one can leaf through the pages of
Defense Daily and see many hundreds of contracts handled on the same
basis. Given such widespread use, it is hard to conclude that the
cost-plus-award method somehow makes the Halliburton contract a
sweetheart deal for a politically favored company. (Nor is the contract

unusually generous; the LOGCAP's range of a 1 percent to 9 percent fee
is in line with standard government/industry practice.)

[Editor's note - Since this article was published in National Review
magazine, Halliburton has said that while the LOGCAP that was in effect

from 1992 until 1997 called for a one-to-nine percent profit range, the

LOGCAP in effect now calls for significantly less, a one-to-three
percent profit margin.]

Finally, Waxman objects to what he calls Halliburton's "troubling"
performance record, suggesting that Halliburton would not have gotten
the contract had Vice President Cheney not once headed the company. But

Waxman's charges - and their echoes in outraged editorials -
overlook Halliburton's extensive history of defense work for earlier
administrations. Indeed, far from having a "troubling" past, one could
argue that Halliburton was a favorite contractor of the Clinton
Pentagon.

The first LOGCAP was awarded in 1992, as the first Bush administration
(including then-Secretary of Defense Cheney) was leaving office. Four
companies competed, and the winner was Brown &amp; Root, as it was known at

the time (Halliburton changed the name to Kellogg Brown &amp; Root after an

acquisition in 1998). The multi-year contract was in effect during much

of the Clinton administration. During those years, Brown &amp; Root did
extensive work for the Army under the LOGCAP contract in Haiti,
Somalia, and Bosnia; contract workers built base camps and provided
troops with electrical power, food, and other necessities.

In 1997, when LOGCAP was again put up for bid, Halliburton/Brown &amp; Root

lost the competition to another contractor, Dyncorp. But the Clinton
Defense Department, rather than switch from Halliburton to Dyncorp,
elected to award a separate, sole-source contract to Halliburton/Brown
&amp; Root to continue its work in the Balkans. According to a later GAO
study, the Army made the choice because 1) Brown &amp; Root had already
acquired extensive knowledge of how to work in the area; 2) the company

"had demonstrated the ability to support the operation"; and 3)
changing contractors would have been costly. The Army's sole-source
Bosnia contract with Brown &amp; Root lasted until 1999. At that time, the
Clinton Defense Department conducted full-scale competitive bidding for

a new contract. The winner was . . . Halliburton/Brown &amp; Root. The
company continued its work in Bosnia uninterrupted.

That work received favorable notices throughout the Clinton
administration. For example, Vice President Al Gore's National
Performance Review mentioned Halliburton's performance in its Report on

Reinventing the Department of Defense, issued in September 1996. In a
section titled "Outsourcing of Logistics Allows Combat Troops to Stick
to Basics," Gore's reinventing-government team favorably mentioned
LOGCAP, the cost-plus-award system, and Brown &amp; Root, which the report
said provided "basic life support services - food, water, sanitation,
shelter, and laundry; and the full realm of logistics services -
transportation, electrical, hazardous materials collection and
disposal, fuel delivery, airfield and seaport operations, and road
maintenance."

In 2001, after the Bush administration came into office, the giant
LOGCAP contract expired again and another competition was held. Once
again, Halliburton won the contract, and it was under that arrangement
that the Iraqi-oilfield analysis was done. As the record shows,
Halliburton won big government contracts under the Clinton
administration, and it won big government contracts under the Bush
administration. The only difference between the two is that Henry
Waxman is making allegations of favoritism in the Bush administration,
while he appeared untroubled by the issue during the Clinton years.

creeech, oversight was much stronger during those days. bush and his
gang of thugs and criminals just threw open the door and told his
supporters to come and loot the treasury.

I keep thinking some day you will actually comment on the corruption of
the bush gang but your still locked in the kill the messenger mindset.
