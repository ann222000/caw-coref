I just got a Tron and can't play it due to it not registering
credits.  I tried dropping quarters and pushing the red credit button
inside the coin door.  The coin door is getting voltage (bulbs
burning) and the game is in attract mode.  Working fine except for the
credit issue.  Any help will be greatly appreciated!

A bit of a side issue, but you could always install the free play
ROMs and not worry about the credits.

O.k. so I ordered the Free Play ROM and hopefully it will be here next
week.  Does anyone have any idea how I might be able to register
credits other than via the coin mechs or credit button mounted inside
the coin door?  It's driving me crazy having a new game that powers up
and only being able to watch it in attract mode.

You can always momentarily ground the credit switch (pin)
on the PCB itself.  If it won't credit at the boardset,
then something else is wrong, like it's being held grounded,
a bad chip on the PCB, cabling issues, etc.

Can you set the test switch into test mode? Can you test the coin
switches there? What shows up?

No, the test switch does nothing, when switched on it continues to run
start up and run in attract mode.  When I push the credit button or
the coin mech wire there are no sounds nor do credits appear on the
screen.  I do not have any schematics so if someone could tell me how/
where to ground the pin on the PCB to get credits maybe that would
work.

Let me guess -- it's saying sound board interface error when you boot
it up too...

You got it!  I take it you have experience with something similar to
this?  Any input you can give will be greatly appreciated!

Well, all the inputs go through the SSIO board.  If you've got bad
RAM/ROM/CPU there, then the sound CPU can't communicate with the main CPU
and send over the inputs.

Could be the ribbon cables too...

Sometimes the sound board interface error just comes from the main CPU
coming out of reset a lot faster than the sound CPU, so the sound CPU
isn't ready when the main CPU pings it, but in your case, it sounds like
a genuine problem.
