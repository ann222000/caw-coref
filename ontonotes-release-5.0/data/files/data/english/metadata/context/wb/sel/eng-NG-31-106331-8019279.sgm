So, my question has always been: How can paying such a low fee every
month even begin to pay the fees americans would have to pay for
medical care...? PLUS we all know that insurance companies are
NOTORIOUS for not paying, despite demanding payments from us.

I don't know how long the link below will work, but since we're such a
wide group of people from various locations as well as status, what
are your thoughts on Micheal Moore's &quot;SICKO&quot;?

Thanks for this link. Great video.

Medical care will always be extremely expensive. Even if the more
minor services could be delegated to nurse practicioners and physician
assistants, etc, the costs are still sky-high. The only question is
whether rich people, including middle class people are willing to fund
the expense to provide some level of insurance for everyone.
Considering the history of Medicaid and Medicare, it would seem to be
an unlikely possibility. Perhaps about the most that could happen is
some kind of national catastrophic coverage for everyone. Even this
would need to be funded by people with money though. It does seem to
be a matter of priorities though, since a LOT of tax money goes to
defense. Diverting some of that to fund medical insurance is not very
likely either. I think we're stuck pretty much where we are for the
foreseeable future. dkw

Hi Erica,

I am an enormous fan of the NHS (Britain's free National Health
Service), which has never failed myself or my family. I can personally
relate a number of stories where I've been truly thankful for the
speed and quality of the care I have received. Although private health
care is available -- and I can afford it -- I am proud to use the NHS.
If I am taken ill I don't have any anxiety about paying for treatment
or whether or not my insurance claim will be accepted; I just walk
into a hospital and they take care of me. No matter what.

It's paid for by tax payers and it's not about paying a &quot;low fee every
month&quot;. It's paid for from the standard tax yield, where, of course,
larger earners pay more tax. Although not enough, in my opinion. We
also couple this with PAYE (Pay-As-You-Earn), where both you and your
employer contribute a percentage amount based on salary which
contributes towards your state pension and unemployment benefit. PAYE
is more complex and people tend to opt in and out of it based on their
pension situation.

Yep I too applaud the NHS, in the 60 odd years since it's inception it
has become a massive part of life in the UK, and everybody gets to
reap the benifits of free(ish) health care.

It has though over the years also become a massive expense for the
goverment, with each sucessive goverment over the years promising to
make it better etc...

I make Erica right, given that pharmacutical firms are greedy money
grabbing bastards, and that both the price of reseach and medicine is
not getting lower, how long have we go until our NHS crumbles of some
erstwhile PM decides to intrudice a tiered system of medical care?

Ohh and I forgot, you done a great job in promoting the NHS, but you
forgot to mention the exuberant perscription charges we face for the
actual drugs.

I don't follow you. You pay a fixed price of, I think, about £7.15 as
a patient (no what the drug is). I was prescribed some anti-vitals
which, for the week's treatment, cost £124.99. I paid my standard
seven quid! If I was retired, unemployed, or a student, it would have
been free!

That's a deal.

I haven't really been able to see a Dr my whole life, and when I busted my
arm last year
http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b70/Dying4Eternity/12b56610.jpg
http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b70/Dying4Eternity/415b81cc.jpg

I delayed doing anything about it. Guy landed on my arm which was sitting on
a speaker... (he was crowdsurfing).  The bruise was essentially the folcrum
point, and he landed on my hand. I swear I have bendable bones! I nearly
blacked out, and I couldn't really use my arm all week. FINALLY Dave made me
go to the ER because there was a tearing feeling in my arm when I rotated my
wrist pinky towards thumb... Went to the ER, waited for 45 minutes (it
wasn't busy), got seen and the ENTIRE TIME NOBODY TOUCHED ME except to take
my blood pressure, and to move my hand for the X-Ray.

I kept asking the Dr about the tearing feeling in my arm, and he ignored me.
I asked SEVERAL times... he kept saying &quot;Its not broken&quot;... which I knew. If
I thought it was broken I'd have gone to the ER sooner... sheesh. The whole
visit consisted of about 4 min of contact with the dr.

Anyway, I got the bills (which there were THREE of). $800 for the hospital
visit... $150 for the XRay, AND $115 for the ER doctor to read the xray.

Yup. All that to learn NOTHING about my arm... And I still can't feel peices
of my arm that were bruised, get a hot feeling on the top of my had
occasionally, and STILL sometimes feel the glorious tearing in my arm (VERY
rare, but it happens).

Because I'm poor I have unlimited care until 2 months after she's born, and
after that, I'm screwed again... (right now I have an RX to an allergy
medicine that's $86 a month w/o insurance)....

*sigh*

Yep you are right it's about the £7 mark, and yep you are right it is
just the one cost no matter what the drug, heh would you pay £7 for
paracetemol?

Okay so yes drugs do cost a fourtune, and I guess we are not being
asked to pay the whole cost. However considering the first part of my
question, and considering  that we have had an increase in
perscription charges every budget, how long do you think that will
last?

Warlock, only warning...around here, we try to play nice. Feel free to
attack the message, but leave the personal attacks at home.

Oh, and while we're at it, I'm an American too, and I think Socialized
Medicine and Higher Education is long overdue. Socialism is such a scarey
boogey man to some Americans, as a concept, without even realizing they
already benefit from socialist services such as Fire Rescue, Police
Services, Primary Education, Social Welfare programs, Medicare and Medicaid,
Food Stamps, etc. etc. etc. My sister received far better care under
Medicaid than I got under my HMO, so personally, I'm all about a National
Health Care System.

I kind of agree with you. My eyes became opened when I toured Europe.
I had always believed that America was best....best products, best
living conditions, best of everything, then I lived in Germany a while
and saw Europeans living quite well. Now Mexico is another story.
America ain't bad, but it could sure be a lot better if we weren't so
tied up with the military and all that encompasses. dkw

&gt; &gt; I think you're both of those things already.

&gt; Ahh, thanks! Now I just need the degree to back it up...  slowly but
&gt; surely.  I *may* be able to just stay on welfare and continue school  for a
&gt; few years and NOT have to deal with working.... (which would be a
&gt; lifesaver), but there really  isn't  any information online about how our
&gt; welfare system works, and they're not interested in helping you unless you
&gt; are already at the point to obtain the service. Whoo.

&gt; &gt; America sucks. Is there room for a few more over there?

&gt; &gt; I think all countries have their fair share of problems; the grass is
&gt; &gt; definitely not always greener. I think there's more opportunities for
&gt; &gt; large wealth in America, but perhaps the UK does more for those who
&gt; &gt; have less.

&gt; &gt; Swings and roundaboutas, as they say.

Umm, now I don't know about the rest of you but both of these comments
seem to be having a small dig at Britian rather than the USA, and both
form the fingers of a cititisen of the USA, so I wonder why warlock

Unless of course he is correct and he is 'Just an American'?

I have experience with the Australian Medicare public health services
and I have to say that the biggest problems seem to revolve around
strain on the system. Medicare is great if all you need is to visit a
doctor and collect a prescription. If, however, you required any kind
of surgery or specialist consultation the waiting lists can be long
bordering on absurd.

There is a private health service that operates as well and so often
people have the choice of waiting or paying which of course results in
alot of sniping about the system being there for the rich etc etc. How
can public care expect to keep up though?

And by the way, it was never a question of whether people really do
care or not.  The majority of people probably do. (at least I think so
when I'm being optomistic)  My point is only that socialization of
medicine is bad for everyone.

The lack of socialized medicine encourages the cycle of poverty, Craig. They
call the ER the poor man's doctor, because when you are sick or hurt, with
no insurance, it's the only place you can go. Then, you get hit with a 1000
dollar bill that you can't afford, so it starts eating at your credit. Bad
credit will make you pay more for the same products than others do (because
of higher interest), and will deny you the opportunity to do things for
betterment, like student and business loans.

I'm telling you my personal story here, so believ that it's not just liberal
propaganda. Socialized medicine and socialized higher education are the two
key factors in eliminating the vast majority of poverty in this country.

Unfortunately, the poor will always be with us.  No amount of free
education and medicine will eliminate it.  I'm not completely opposed
to offering the overly downtrodden governmental reimbursement for
their medical expenses.  I am opposed though to completely socializing
medicine.  I'm convinced it's the wrong move.  I lived in Canada for
two years and had first hand experience with how crappy socialized
medicine really is.  Nearly everyone I talked to up there hated it.  I

Craig, if I don't become independently wealthy, I'll wait the rest of my
life to have Knee Surgery. Even when I did have an HMO, the percentage they
would pay makes it prohibitively expensive. I'll wait two years for
something as opposed to never getting it.

The poor WILL always be with us...but I am a perfect example of someone who
was ghetto poor, but motivated enough to try and work my way out of it, if
given the opportunity. If I had been able to get a degree of any sort, I
would be much farither along now then I was.

Don't get me wrong, I believe strongly in personal accountability, and have
Libertarian sensibilities. However, I know how poverty self propagates, and
becomes a prison that lasts for generations, and how little it takes in
external influence to break the cycle.

I have to disagree with this KC.  I'm with DC all the way on this one.

A better standard of education, and an equal chance at higher lever
education will give the poor better tools to make the most of their
lifes.

And social healthcare for everybody is a must. Having said that though
Erica is correct in her initial post, the cost to the goevrment and
subsqently the tax payer is enormouse, and I can't see it doing any
thing other than grow bigger.

The question is what can be done about this? I would like to see drug
companies bring the cost of drugs down, I would like to get rid of
drug company money from drug reasearch I would like to see better anti
corruption measures in all walks of bussiness life.

Heh but then in many ways I let my rampant Socialism  cloud my brain
and I get all navive about things.

Well you also have to consider the quality of healthcare once it
becomes privatized.  It's hard to measure exactly what would happen if
America's health system became privatized.  Other systems, like
Cananda's for example may be keeping up with moden technology, but
that also may be because they are piggybacking off of other systems
that are still private, like America's.  Cutting edge technology in
the medical field may be hindered if we remove the money incentive
from the equation.  This wouldn't be so bad if we had others to
piggyback off of; but would we?

Hi Craig,

No healthcare system is perfect; just as no company or government or
human-being is either. I strongly disagree with your suggestion that
socialised healthcare is &quot;crappy&quot;, and I have plenty of personal
experience to defend my corner here. Also, in Canada, just as in the
UK, private healthcare operates perfectly happily alongside public
healthcare. You can have both, but, honestly, a person's health cannot
be considered a privilege. The individual and society both benefit
from a person's good health; it enables them to contribute.

I agree that the poor will always be with us, but we can certainly
shift the parameters of what is considered to be &quot;poor&quot; and, at the
same, offer these people opportunities to raise their own status. Free
healthcare and education -- for everyone and by default -- should be
considered a fundamental human right.

xxxianxx

I would like to see this as well Lee.  That does not equal socialized
medicine.  I think the pharmacutical companies are making way too much
money.  There probably is corruption there.  There are many problems
with the current system, but I don't think that means fundmamentally
changing the entire system.  It only means fixing the specific
problems.

Why should free healthcare and education be considered a &quot;fundmental
human right&quot;?  What moral theory justifies such a designation?

Yeah; I mean... look what it's done for Eastern Europe (USSR), Cuba
and China.

They dont have any sick or poor people.  *chuckles*

I heard a political activist on the radio once say: why are people are
fleeing Haiti 500 miles by ocean on wooden rafts to get to the
&quot;imperialist, capitalist empire&quot; when they could have walked 50 miles
to the &quot;workers' paradise&quot; of Cuba?

When Micheal Moore's heart explodes (should be any day now) where do
you thing that whale is going to go to seek medical treatment?  You
think he's gonna go to Canada or Cuba?

Sure; the idea of socialized medicine &quot;sounds&quot; great.  It makes
everyone &quot;feel&quot; good to support the cause.  But explain to me....
&quot;HOW&quot; will socialized medicine work?  Everyone that supports
socialized medicine likes the idea but when you ask them how it will
work they havent a clue.

You want to change my mind about socialized medicine? Convince me it
works and then we'll talk.

Hey KC,

I say this only in referance to keeping a control on the riseing cost
of our NHS.
I think the cost of drugs set by the drug companies, is far too high
and I am positive that it is just greed that makes it so.

Hey Warlock,

Where do you live?

Here in the UK we have a great NHS, yes the cost is high, yes it could
be even better, and no it is not free of it's problems.  But we have
had it for 60 odd years, and in that time it has help millions, and I
mean millions of people, who otherwise would not have had been able to
afford medical attention.

It is via education and more importantly higher education that we are
given the tools to make our lives better.  It is therefore an act of
humane fairness to make sure that everybody is given equal access and
equal chance to this.

Standard free healthcare for all people is important for the
productivity of the whole country.  More poor sick people, means more
of the shitty lowpaid but essential work goes undone.

I don't about the rest of the folk here, but I remember all the
strikes we had over here in the 70s and 80s, especaily the dustman
strike.  Ohhh try to live without these services, because the people
doing the job are too ill, and toopoor to be able to aford to get
better.

While we are on the subject I would also like to see these essential
low paid job get a massive pay hike

&gt; &gt; Hi Craig,

&gt; &gt; No healthcare system is perfect; just as no company or government or
&gt; &gt; human-being is either. I strongly disagree with your suggestion that
&gt; &gt; socialised healthcare is &quot;crappy&quot;, and I have plenty of personal
&gt; &gt; experience to defend my corner here. Also, in Canada, just as in the
&gt; &gt; UK, private healthcare operates perfectly happily alongside public
&gt; &gt; healthcare. You can have both, but, honestly, a person's health cannot
&gt; &gt; be considered a privilege. The individual and society both benefit
&gt; &gt; from a person's good health; it enables them to contribute.

&gt; &gt; I agree that the poor will always be with us, but we can certainly
&gt; &gt; shift the parameters of what is considered to be &quot;poor&quot; and, at the
&gt; &gt; same, offer these people opportunities to raise their own status. Free
&gt; &gt; healthcare and education -- for everyone and by default -- should be
&gt; &gt; considered a fundamental human right.

Craig, after thinking about this for a while I think that I'll change
my words. I want to defend the position exactly as is, but I think
it's more complicated than my initial statement suggests. But, hey,
that's what you get for drawing me into a debate 5 minutes before I am
about to leave work. :)

I think that society can be more productive if more individuals are
allowed to reach their potential. The individual feels happier and
more fulfilled, whilst society sees increased productivity and lower
crime. So, really, I think there's a strong political and economic
precedence for free healthcare and education for all.

As for a moral theory behind this, I believe in the essential decency
of human society. Not in some abstract, bleeding heart, way: rather in
a definite Darwinian sense, traceable from gene-level preservation
traits that permeate the mass-psychology of the group. I don't think
that most people look at a single mother who can't afford to put food
on the table for her child, can't get a job because she lacks
qualifications, and is dying of treatable form of cancer and think
&quot;ah, tough shit&quot;. Giving an at least equal playing field for
individuals to carve their own success within the group (society) just
seems right to me. I'm not being flip and going on a gut feeling; I
genuinely think and feel, from what I've seen in my life, that it's
fair and morally commendable to insist on these basic rights for
everyone. Everyone benefits.

Everyone should have a chance to have a good life and I think it's
right that the government of the day should pursue policy to that
effect. That does mean proportional taxes to fund social welfare, but
I look at something like Thatcherism and I think we can't go back to
that. Capitalism, when pursued in such a pure way, eventually
collapses in on itself and the people at the top fall too, as economic
recession makes us all poorer.

I agree with most of what you've said here.  Like I've said before,
I'm for fixing our system, but the changes you've suggested are just
too much.  We do not need a switch from private to public medicine.
We need to leave it private, but have the government establish certain
regulations.

I think that is a very good aspiration, Ian. Something many of us long for.
The question is, which ways would be effective in increasing the likelihood
of this happening?

&lt;of human society.  (...)in a definite Darwinian sense, traceable from

That is something we want to believe, too. And yet, conditions in human
society points to deviations.....
What do you think is behind these deviations, that is, what leads human
beings to behavior we would not classify as decent?

traits that permeate the mass-psychology of the group. I don't think
that most people look at a single mother who can't afford to put food
on the table for her child, can't get a job because she lacks
qualifications, and is dying of treatable form of cancer and think
&quot;ah, tough shit&quot;. Giving an at least equal playing field for
individuals to carve their own success within the group (society) just
seems right to me. I'm not being flip and going on a gut feeling; I
genuinely think and feel, from what I've seen in my life, that it's
fair and morally commendable to insist on these basic rights for
everyone. Everyone benefits.

Everyone should have a chance to have a good life and I think it's
right that the government of the day should pursue policy to that
effect. That does mean proportional taxes to fund social welfare, but
I look at something like Thatcherism and I think we can't go back to
that. Capitalism, when pursued in such a pure way, eventually
collapses in on itself and the people at the top fall too, as economic
recession makes us all poorer.

I agree that socialized medicine is far from being perfect, but to many
people it is still the only option. If someone needs health care and can't
afford a private service, having an option becomes very important. I think
the question is, what can be done in order to have a better service?

You mention privatization. What would this privatization mean to you, that
is, how do you see it being done and working?

And by the way, it was never a question of whether people really do
care or not.  The majority of people probably do. (at least I think so
when I'm being optomistic)  My point is only that socialization of
medicine is bad for everyone.

Well the medical world doesn't need &quot;privatized&quot; because it's already
private.  So I don't think the fundamental way things are done needs
changed.  I think the system needs to remain the same, but the
government needs to intervene when necessary.

Good discussion people. What I see is nobody wanting to be singled out
and given a comparatively bad piece of the health care pie. Rich folks
tend to think well, hey, they went to college and work hard, so if
they can afford the best, they want it. Also they are not so sure
someone who does not work should have the same quality of care and
access as they, SO...they feel singled out collectively as a group by
the threat of socialization of the system because they fear they will
lose out by either decreased quality of care, or their tax burden will
be substantial plus their level of care decreased. Obviously poor
people feel left out already, because they can't afford health care or
the level of health care that is available is sub-par by their
thinking. It's the two tiered level of care that's the problem. I
don't see people ranting and raving over all the diseases that cannot
be controlled or cured, for example, because this tends to apply to
everyone. Even rich people die from cancer and heart disease after
they have their expensive bypass, etc. You can take almost perfect
care of yourself and drop dead of heart disease, for example. In fact,
eventually you WILL die from something and that includes Bill Gates.

So how can this problem be solved...the problem of giving everyone a
fair break (in their minds)? I think the solution is to offer eveyone
free health care as simply a percentage of their income, but make the
&quot;health tax&quot; similar to the interest on home payments. Rich people get
much more of a tax deduction that way (in exchange for a decreased
level of health care, in some cases). It would be up to the govt
actuaries to find out what that cost would be and what the govt could
afford to provide. There could only be one tier of health care though.
Expensive? Hell yes, but more fair than what we have now, and nobody
gets screwed. dkw

Woah easy there!  Did I get that right?  You think that free
healthcare as a percentage of your income would make people belive
they are getting a fair deal?

I'm not so sure, I think this thing about a two tiered system is at
the root,and that  we must aviod it.

I don't see that much needs to be changed about our NHS, I mean about
the way we pay for it.  I don't know where in the world you are DK?

But for the non UK peeps out there.  When we pay tax here we pay
PAYE(pay as you earn) which is your basic income tax, and higher
earners pay at a higher percentage, we also get to pay National
Insureance.  Which is a fixed rate for all of us and a portion of
which goes towards paying for the NHS.

I just want to note that if you are out of work and claiming benifit
the goverment pays your NI.

The way we have it now is fine, we all pay more or less the same
towards the NHS and the provision for the richer to have private
health care is there, in fact anybody can have private, social, or a
mix of both types of health care.

The high cost of our health service as far as I can see(and I used to
work for the NHS) is down to the inflated cost of drugs, the inherent
corruption amongst high and middle management, and too much middle
management, and bad, I mean very bad business practices.

Thanks to that Thatcher woman, nowadays we have goverment services
being run as businesses with an eye on profit rather than on best
service.
Only today I read a story about a high level manager who has just been
made redundant(along with other staff) as an excersie to cut debt(yep
it is always the staff that go first).  He had the job for 4 years was
on £16500 PA, and recived a redundancey package of one million pounds.
