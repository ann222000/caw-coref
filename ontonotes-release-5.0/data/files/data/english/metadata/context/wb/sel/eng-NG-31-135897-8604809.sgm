I like the fact that it's rated 16+ IQ in Portugal, which means our

why because you're afraid he'll blow his pigs instead of a valve? he's never
needed incentive on any other occasion to blow his pigs.

Those were already there and as far as I know they're real - some of the
few things I left completely untouched and to be honest I don't even
know what they're supposed to mean.  This game makes you want to do

Wow, something is screwy. First of all, this game's case (on the
picture) was made in Portugal, and it is plastic. The case which I
bought (and which was the only available) is made of tin and is &quot;made
in EU&quot; (EU = European Union). Things are even more screwy. On the

I can honestly say I haven't paid a penny for any pictures d-loaded from
the net.  There is obviously a loophole in the browsers software (all of
them) as I don't even have to use Azureus or similar.  I'd say take
advantage before someone spots the loophole and closes it...

For Wally I'd suggest something like &quot;HL2: special super-linear edition&quot;,
no gameplay choices included ;). And for Shawk something like STALKER &quot;now
with all the things we promised but couldn't deliver.&quot; And for me I'd like
a Bloodlines version &quot;nearly bugfree with all unfinished stuff added&quot; :)!

Baladi - you do know this is a cover made up by RifRaf and not an actual
cover?  RifRaf added the 'made in Portugal' etc and the reversing of the
cover was either deliberate or accidental.  Either way it does not
detract from the intent.

With all due respect to certain people, it seems that it's not
possible to express a favourable opinion of a game whilst still
recognising its flaws. If you say you like a game some people
automatically assume that you think it's perfect. If you say you
really like a game you're somehow &quot;hyping it&quot;.

I'm with you on STALKER. In retrospect it wasn't quite how I saw the
game in my minds eye. It was still an excellent game in my opinion.
Not without its faults, but still one of my favourites of 2007.

It really boils down to a very simple and basic concept. People play a
game for their own entertainment. It doesn't matter if you're only
person in the who world to enjoy that game.

Nobody else's opinion of a game matters except your own. The same goes
with books, films, music and other forms of entertainment media. It's
an indisputably subjective experience.

I only noticed that you liked the game a lot and never critized much about

So who listens to reviews in magazines?

We've been here before haven't we?

If I were to say that BioShock was the best game ever made and was the
pinnacle of gaming, without having ever played the full game, I'd be
hyping the game up.

If I said the same thing having played it I'd merely be stating my
opinion based on a purely subjective experience.

Again, with all due respect, if you still haven't learnt to see
through media hype surrounding games it's not surprising that you feel
disappointment.

As for games not delivering on promises, are we really talking about
promises made by developers? Or are we talking about expectations
based on personal gaming desire?

Did STALKER really not deliver what you were &quot;promised&quot;? Or is it
really a case of it didn't turn out how you expected it to?  Were the
&quot;promises&quot; real world or were they manufactured by your gaming mind?

Oh, I don't remember exactly but I'm quite sure the developers promised a
wide open gameworld and not fences. They also promised artificial life and
not some simple respawning and I'm sure they originally planned to offer
vehicles as well. In the case of STALKER though one may admit that it was
delayed and delayed until the publisher probably pulled the plug and just
forced them to finish the stuff they had. Still I would like the developer
or magazines to clearly recognize something like that for once! Just look
at the YouTube video with Ken Levine hyping all that old-school stuff :(.

Can you back that up with some facts? Because Im following the

symbiont relationship wich was formed by the AI. And this actually also
happens in the game.

Everything is &quot;Old School&quot; Werner.

In BioShock I really enjoyed how I could set enemies against each
other. I liked to get Big Daddies to fight each other and then when
one was dead I killed the other and rescued the Little sister after
killing the other weakened Big Daddy.

You'll no doubt tell me that there's nothing new in NPC's fighting
each other. Heck, the original DOOM did it! Yeah, yeah, I know this
already.

I really liked the graphics in BioShock, but you'll immediately tell
me that the lighting is all wrong and the shadows are &quot;fake&quot;. I don't
care about those things. BioShock looked great to me.

In STALKER I thought the AI was great. I also thought that the A-Life
was great to watch and added to the atmosphere. No doubt you'll link
me to YouTube clips showing moments of crass AI behaviour (I made one
myself I might add) and &quot;pooh-pooh&quot; the A-Life.

Forget Ken Levine. Who cares what *he* says? Who cares what *anyone*
says? Just play the game and enjoy it for what it is. Or don't enjoy
it if it doesn't grab you.

Life is as simple as you make it. Games are no different.

No, no. Just point me to a review that found BioShock dissappointing. I'm
not complaining about different opinions here, I'm complaining about that
there is hardly more than one opinion left, and that one is that the new
AAA blockbusters are always great. Just look at the first reactions to the

I was disappointed of course.  So... when the game was released and I
loaded it up and played, it was as good if not better than my new
expectations of it.  Therefore I really enjoyed it.  No 'missing' of
anything, no conspiracy, no hype, no story here.

If you'd have followed Stalker as I did you'd have had the same
experience except of course yours would have been coloured by Bloodlines
in some way or other   ;-)

That would explain it then. I just follow all the games on Blues News and
occasionally dip into an interview, preview or review from there for a
game I'm interested in. I seldom follow a game on it's homepage or read
everything about it. I knew they had to cut STALKER down but not much
more. But I remembered the early hype and expected at least something
like Boiling Point minus all the bugs ;).

Games (and books and movies and such) are usually divided into AAA, A,
and B.  I think Vogel (or the guy from Stardock) did an article for
one of the on-line magazines about how the games are divided up this
way but I can't find it now.  Yeah, there are games beyond B but
believe me you don't want to see them...

AAA games are ones like Warcraft, Bioshock, NWN, Oblivion, World of
Warcraft, Halo, and the like.  Big games made by big companies with a
huge development and marketing effort behind them.  Note that being
AAA doesn't necessarily guarantee either success or goodness, though.
There are quite a few AAA flops out there.

Hype alone doesn't push a game into AAA territory.  I had a lot of fun
with Stalker but I consider it an A title at best.  And some of my
favorite games are B titles.

&gt;I agree, but still you must recognize that those two already released AAA
&gt;blockbusters of this year, STALKER and BioShock, couldn't deliver a lot of
&gt;what they promised and nevertheless they were hyped to hell and back as if
&gt;nobody ever noticed that. Just remember the review scores of both games!

Er, STALKER had very little market hype compared to the nonsense
surrounding Bioshock. Remember that STALKER was a &quot;known&quot; title for
about 2 years and much delayed, so the hype that built up was
primarily forum-speak of a long gestation in the &quot;user-community&quot;.
And, regardless of your opinion, STALKER is actually quite a good game
after the latest (1.0004) bug-fix. The open-gameplay and the ability
to take tasks almost in any order gives lots of scope for alternate
tactics plus some of the side-quest exploration is great fun.. unlike
the suffocatingly-linear HL2 and Bioshock both with near-zero replay
value. STALKER is an action-RPG like Bloodlines, but without the depth
of Bloodlines; please do not put it in the same class as straight
&quot;on-rails&quot; shooters (with gimmicks) such as Doom3, HL2, or Bioshock.

BTW, I was not one of those who followed STALKER development
(and its release-disappointments) very closely. I bought the game
expecting a more or less linear corridor shooter with a few
sidequests. I was very pleased indeed with what it finally turned out
to be in terms of open gameplay and look forward to its sequel.

&gt;&gt; I liked the game a lot and didn't criticise much about it because it

&gt;&gt; game wasn't what they originally wanted to make and they, and
&gt;&gt; reviewers went on to explain what had been lost and what the game
&gt;&gt; would be at release.

&gt; That would explain it then. I just follow all the games on Blues News
&gt; and occasionally dip into an interview, preview or review from there for
&gt; a game I'm interested in. I seldom follow a game on it's homepage or
&gt; read everything about it. I knew they had to cut STALKER down but not
&gt; much more. But I remembered the early hype and expected at least
&gt; something like Boiling Point minus all the bugs ;).
">

Yeah, TBH I don't follow games, hanging on every word like I did when
younger but when a game does interest me I'll read any articles I come
across - a number of those articles talked about how it was cut down.

The only magazine I still subscribe to nowadays is the UK's PC Gamer
(and sometimes I read that and wonder whether I'll bother to renew my
subscription).  With Stalker I particularly remember PC Gamer going out
to the Ukraine a few months before release to play the latest build and
interview the devs.  On return they wrote an article detailing how it
had changed.  There was so many changes so close to release that I
expected a massive delay or another Boiling Point (bug fest).

When I did get to play it I was therefore very pleasantly surprised.
Although it was not what I'd hoped for it was a great game and I've
since played it through a few times.  I'll play it through again in the
near future no doubt.  Definitely one of the best games of the year *for
me* - even without the early hopes it was just my type of game.

I didn't.

OK, I'm guessing that you're attributing these things to Ken Levine?
Like I already said, don't listen to him. Make up your own mind about
these things.

BioShock is hardly the first game to have its developers make such
claims. The only things to trust are your own eyes and your own
experiences of the game.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I really liked the graphics in BioShock, but you'll immediately tell me
&gt;&gt; that the lighting is all wrong and the shadows are &quot;fake&quot;. I don't care
&gt;&gt; about those things. BioShock looked great to me.

&gt;It looks great to me too. I just always followed engine development and
&gt;was really astonished that the Unreal 3 engine doesn't seem up to date
&gt;with FEAR or Doom 3. I never said it looked bad!

&gt;&gt; In STALKER I thought the AI was great. I also thought that the A-Life

&gt;A-Life? That's just another word for respawning and that's the problem.
&gt;Nowadays most developers use such terms and then deliver &quot;Old School&quot;.
">

Werner, I stated my opinion. Once again you try to argue against it.
What's the point? I said *I* liked it. I never said you liked it, I
never said you had to like it. You can say it's the crappiest addition
to any game ever made and I will *still* have liked what it added to
the game for *me*.

In essence Werner, your opinions of the game are meaningless to me. I
respect them and your right to have them, but I simply don't agree
with them. There goes that subjectivity thing getting right in the way
again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Forget Ken Levine. Who cares what *he* says?

&gt;Obviously a lot of people care otherwise he wouldn't be saying it. Maybe
&gt;his hype is the reason why BioShock got so many good reviews after all?
">

No Werner, BioShock go so many good press reviews because reviewers
like their little perks and beano's supplied and paid for by the
developers.

That is probably a little harsh on some of them. But again it's
possible to really rate something highly whilst accepting its flaws.
Some of the reviews are likely honest enough.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But don't force me into a corner. I like BioShock, I think it's looking
&gt;great and has great gameplay. But it's not the innovation everyone was
&gt;talking about, and STALKER wasn't it either. Also it still crashes :(!
">

To you, maybe not. To a lot of people both games seem to have
delivered what they wanted and were mostly expecting. Personally, I
don't have any problems seeing through the developer and media spiel
and enjoying the games by playing them with an open mind.

&gt;I don't really know what defines AAA but STALKER was hyped high all around
&gt;and waited for for years. I don't think this is valid for other eastern
&gt;europe shooters like e.g. &quot;You are empty&quot;. Rob surely knows ;).
">

Yes, I would know, because I've taken the time to play both of them.

There is no comparison. YaE was a good budget shooter. STALKER was a
top notch game with high production values and engaging gameplay. It
was worth the tier 1 price to me.

Of course, these are just my opinions. But, at least they are formed
based on having played and completed both games. I also accept that
some people won't agree with me.

That's life.
