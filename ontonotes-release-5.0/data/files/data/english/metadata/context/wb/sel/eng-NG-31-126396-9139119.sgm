and where did i ever proclaim the iphone would take over the world?
nope, never happened. sure, the iphone will get around 30-40% of the
cell market within 8 years, everyone agrees with that.

so i'll proclaim that since the iPod got 72% within 6 years, the iPhone
should easily get 30-40% of the cell market within 8 years. If i'm a bit
low on that estimate, i'm sorry.

Ah, but Google just announced they aren't going to produce a PHONE, they
are only going to do the software, so by default they have given up on
the cell market. Nobody is going to put Google Software on a phone.
That's just ridiculous.

Google (Eric) realized they couldn't compete against the iPhone in
software or hardware, so they admitted defeat today.

Eric sits on Apple's Board, and was shown the way by Steve.

Let's make a bet.

If iPhone has at least 30% of the world mobile phone market by 2015, then
I will buy you two new iPhones of whatever the current model is.

If iPhone has less than 30% of the world mobile phone market, then you
turn over your iPhone to me, I smash it with a hammer, and then you will
eat it.  And if you try to weasel out by not owning an iPhone at the time,
then I will donate a Newton MP100 that to be smashed with a hammer and for
you subsequently to eat.

You will need to supply me with your correct name, address, and phone
number; and keep me informed of all subsequent changes of address and
phone number to ensure fufillment of the wager.

Oh, and I'll be nice and supply some soy sauce to go with your meal.

This is stupid. It doesn't even make any sense, and what I can make out
of it is so silly it's obviously dumb.

All manufacturers will get together on almost nothing.
Few manufacturers want or need to get together against Apple -- a
company that plays well with most companies in most ways.
It is nonsense to suggest even a small group will get together
&quot;eventually&quot; to crush a product that exists and is marketed today. When
such a time arrives, the device is almost certainly to have developed
and changed in many ways. No one plans to get together a coalition to
fight a war that will be (distant) tech history.
Since the iPhone isn't &quot;crushing&quot; anything now, I doubt anyone is
planning to &quot;crush&quot; it. It isn't an evil blight on the market.

Hang around cellphone forums sometime (um, er, then again, DON'T!  We get
enough of your crap here!) and you'd see amongst the most popular
cellphone java apps downloaded are Google Maps, and the GMail client.
There are MILLIONS of cellphone users already using Google-produced
software on their phones, including the 1.4 million iPhone owners using
the special, inferior, crippled (no GPS support) version of Google Maps
commissioned for iPhone.

I don't know where this comes from either. I gave my Apple ][ away
to a relative more than ten years ago. It was a mere novelty at that
point. This is not to denigrate the role of the Apple ][...it was a
quantum leap forward in personal computing. When I first saw one, I
was in graduate school working on a UNIVAC 1108 (this will date me)
and I was blown away. But to contend that this technology has any
real impact twenty years later is naive at the very least. Even cheap
embedded processors have a lot more power. I don't doubt though that
one could still boot and use an Apple ][, or an Amiga 1000 and run
it....it's just that there's little point.

">

I'm not entirely following your logic here. Visicalc appeared on the
Apple ][ originally, and it was a &quot;killer app&quot; but it did not save the
Apple ][ as a computer model. Mainframes were (and to a much lesser
extent today are) used for large monolithic applications....several
generations ago in computer parlance. Mainframes have been relegated
to a very minor niche and that came about because of the &quot;attack of
the killer micros&quot; as the phrase was used in comp.arch back in the
80s and 90s. You are right that nobody would waste mainframe time
on running spreadsheets....it would not make sense. But the killer
micros that pushed aside the mainframes and minicomputers were
not eight bitters or even 16 bitters like the 6502 or the 186/286.
They were the micros that would do everything the mainframes could
do only a lot more cheaply. Further, the important thing that made
micros shine was the far superior OSs that became available for use
on them. Now, what replaces mainframe functionality are things like
blade servers with gobs of processors, SANs, lights-out operation
and much more sophisticated software.

&quot;iSuppli's sell-through research and the subsequent press release
indicated that the iPhone outsold all smart phone models in July in the
United States on an individual basis. While iSuppli stands by this

February is when the SDK is supposed to be released.  Unless teams of
amateurs are going to pump out thousands of &quot;Hello World&quot;- caliber apps
the first two weeks, RIM will have the edge for awhile in terms of number
of apps available.

Having said that,the iPhone only needs a few good apps to address it
shortcomings, but I'll wager the SDK still won't let developers have
access deep inside the OS.

I'll make my bold Oxford-like predictions right here, (and risk looking
foolish in February!)  My guess is that Apple will maintain a very tight
control over development in one of the following ways:

Limiting distribution of the SDK either by commanding a very high price,
or only distributing it to select &quot;approved&quot; developers.

Requiring apps to be digitally signed by Apple (via an arduous/expensive
process)  before they can be installed, or:
The SDK will be neutered &quot;harmless&quot; allowing no access to the OS-
creating essentially installable versions of the current &quot;webapps&quot; or run
in some type of as-yet-unreleased Java-like virtual machine (or other
&quot;sandbox&quot;) insulating it from the phone's guts.

Folklore to the contrary notwithstanding, IMAP is fine for security.  The
problem is whether or not the IMAP implementation is any good.

Most IMAP implementations on mobile devices, including iPhone, are not
very good; they are basically POP client that have been hacked to babble
IMAP, and do not use any of IMAP's capabilities other than multiple
folders (why POP3 deleted the POP2 FOLD command remains a mystery to most
of the world).

To make things worse, many of the current generation of mobile phone IMAP
clients (including iPhone) either don't implement any security at all, or
only implement the 1990s SSL security and not the modern TLS/SASL
security.

There's a new generation of mobile device IMAP clients being developed in
Canada, Scandanavia, and China that are quite a bit better.  Part of the
impetus is to move away from push technology due to patent issues.

&gt; Even it that is true - which I seriously doubt - it doesn't matter.
&gt; The iphone and BlackBerry are in totally different markets.

ah, they are in the same market, both are perfect for business but the
blackberry doesn't have the large development community behind it, nor
is it built on UNIX. the iPhone is.

maybe not this year but within 3 years the iphone will be the primary
smartphone in use, it just has a lot more power under the hood and fits
better into business settings since it's easier to use, far larger
screen and cheaper.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The iphone simply does not have the
&gt; capabilities of a Blackberry.

opps, you have it backwards, the iphone is several years ahead on the
hardware side and about a decade ahead with the OS and number of
developers.

it's more like the iphone is a lear jet, every business person wants one
and apple was the first to make them affordable. the iphone is the best
business tool probably ever developed, you'll catch up with what is
happening in a few years.

yes, you were.

learn about &quot;markets&quot; and development it will help you immensely when

but you are lost on the actual history. the 286 replaced the 8088.

but on the Apple // the 6502 (roughly the same as the 8088) remained the

so the PC and the similar clones didn't last &quot;nearly as long&quot; as the

learn your history or don't post. thanks.

You're nuts Mark. I'll keep in touch. I do this all the time with
reporters. I have $150 coming to me since there are still no Viruses on
the Mac and a fairly well known reporter bet that by the time Bush is
out of office there will be. I'm going to easily win that one.

You're nuts Mark. Should I report you to the computing department at
Washington.edu? You're demands are insane, just do a gentleman's bet and
leave it at that. Are you afraid you are going to lose? It appears so.

We have a bet, but I'll only hold up the rational portion of the wager.

&gt; &gt; i'm not hiding anything, and no, qwest could careless about you iphone

&gt; Don't bet on that point.  It's a very straightforward, and quite

Go for it Mark, qwest doesn't even know I'm on their system due to a
bureaucratic mistake many years ago. You have no access anyway, or legal
claim so give it up, you're insane.

&gt;&gt; This announcement will be a good reason why Oxford's fanatical fanboy

&gt; and where did i ever proclaim the iphone would take over the world?
&gt; nope, never happened. sure, the iphone will get around 30-40% of the
&gt; cell market within 8 years, everyone agrees with that.

&gt; so i'll proclaim that since the iPod got 72% within 6 years, the iPhone
&gt; should easily get 30-40% of the cell market within 8 years. If i'm a bit
&gt; low on that estimate, i'm sorry.

&gt;&gt; Google will partner with all other manufacturer's and eventually CRUSH
&gt;&gt; the iPhone.

&gt; Ah, but Google just announced they aren't going to produce a PHONE, they
&gt; are only going to do the software, so by default they have given up on
&gt; the cell market. Nobody is going to put Google Software on a phone.
&gt; That's just ridiculous.

&gt; Google (Eric) realized they couldn't compete against the iPhone in
&gt; software or hardware, so they admitted defeat today.

&gt; Eric sits on Apple's Board, and was shown the way by Steve.

Why would we still be using cellphones by then? This is the 21st century,
