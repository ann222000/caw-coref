This will not be another gripe post about how bad the term podcast is to the
long term growth of portable media.  You will never again hear me bash it.
It is here to stay and we need to make the best of the situation.

I am hearing more and more private discussion about working to change the
meaning of the term &quot;Podcast&quot; away from a strong connection with the iPod
and making the name mean &quot;Portable On-Demand Cast&quot;.  I think this makes a
lot of sense because the name podcast is here to stay and it is more often
then not understood to mean a piece of content and less to mean a type of
distribution. This transition will take time as most have been conditioned
to connect the iPod with Podcasting in thinking about the medium.

I think with the coming support for podcasting on the Zune, we have an
opportunity to muddy the meaning to mean something a little more open and
less Apple-centric.

The challenge to everyone in the podcast industry is to start talking about
this rebranding concept.  I think it is important to the future of a strong
and diverse distribution ecosystem that users will understand better.

Podcasting today has a user understanding and communications challenge that
can be addresses by all parties involved at all levels in the industry. I
also think that it is important to move beyond the singular focus that many
podcasters large and small have on iTunes and the iPod.

We are seeing many new distribution platforms on mobile, coming Zune support
of podcasting and other types of mobile and living room devices that will
bring greater success to content creators.

Podcasters need to be sure they offer their podcast RSS feeds right on their
websites and stop only linking over to iTunes.

What do all of you think of this direction?

FYI, I am no longer working at or on the Melodeo &quot;Mobilcast&quot; Mobile
Podcasting product.

I've always liked the word -- it's neat, a nice pun, and conveys a lot in
two syllables. The only downside has been that unfortunate first syllable
linking it in consumer minds with iPods. But I think if there is a strong,
easily conveyed, and pithy definition of the word and the concept, the word
itself will extend beyond iPods in much the way Kleenex has. God knows I
don't want to be a zunecaster.

The idealist in me will tell you that's the definition I gave in
Podcasting for Dummies.

But the realist in me says... what's the fuss? Don't get me wrong, I'm
obviously a proponent of making sure potential listeners know that we're
not platform-dependent, and I think that any podcast only showing an
iTunes link on their site is missing a larger opportunity.

So yes, I suppose I support the initiative. I'm just not sure there is
an action item here, other than personal responsibility.

When I talk to somebody about &quot;robots,&quot; I very rarely start the

Likewise, when I'm telling somebody about podcasting, I almost never

podcast is: a series of audio or video files that you can download and
subscribe to, to listen to or watch whenever you want.

Associating it directly with the iPod is factually incorrect: Apple
didn't originate the term.  An indirect association is probably on
target.  But saying it stands for &quot;Portable On Demand&quot; is kludgy as
hell.  Why do we need to take an awkward and politically correct stand
on this issue?  Telling people you don't need an iPod is important,
but it shouldn't be wrapped up in semantics like this.

BTW, I saw the Zune listed at http://woot.com the other day for a deep
discount.  It didn't sell out all day.

I'd love to see serious competition for the iPod, but this won't be
it.  The future of the Zune is dead.  Sorry if that hurts the feelings
of the dozen people who bought one.

Then check out Creative's Zen line.

The Video iPod lets you buy a microphone attachment.
The Zen has it built in.

The Video iPod lets you buy a speaker attachment.
The Zen has it built in.

The Video iPod lets you buy a standalone charger.
The Zen comes with it.

The Video iPod uses a unique cable that can only be
bought from Apple, directly or indirectly.
The Zen uses a standard USB cable that you can snag
from any other standardized device if you can't find
it.

And the Vision W has a larger and nicer screen.

And the Zen has superior audio quality.

And the Zen has a better battery life.

I love showing iPod owners my Zen playing a movie and
watching their faces.  Total jaw drop.  All I use my
iPod for is stuff proprietary to iTunes.  Otherwise,
it's Creative all the way for me.

Eventually the term will take on its own meaning
divorced from its roots anyway.  It's already going
that way.  How often do you hear the word &quot;dial tone&quot;,
as in &quot;a signal that your phone is ready for you to
turn the dial&quot;?  When was the last time you saw a
rotary phone?  There isn't much need to change it to a
&quot;push button tone&quot;.

These kinds of anachronisms are caught in the
linguistic ether all the time, and no one really pays
any attention to them.  It's still a &quot;television&quot; when
I'm watching a DVD from a player mere feet away (the
root &quot;tele&quot; means &quot;distant&quot;).  We have Internet
&quot;radio&quot; stations that have no connection to radio
waves.

It won't take long for podcasting to lose any
associations with any particular technology, and that
is as it should be.  The distribution method doesn't
matter nearly as much as the contents.  If I hand you
a copy Fireside on an audio CD, no RSS involved, no
mp3 involved, it would still be a podcast.

My 2 cents anyway.

Steve,

While I generally agree with what you are saying about the messaging. I just
feel we need to spin the POD message in a different direction. While your
solution here is more of the same messaging that has not been working
either. The question is what can we all do differently to make this industry
grow faster?

We also cannot at every opportunity bash every competing platform like the
Zune.  You can say the Zune is dead, but millions of dollars are being put
into this competitive platform and you are not even giving it a chance to
get off the ground without saying it is dead.  Tell me who else out their
could invest like that to bring a competitive platform with so much
potential.

Steven, I agree with your comments. It seems like all we need to do is
slightly change how we all talk about and market podcasting in our blogs and
to the media. This slight change in message could make a dramatic
difference.  I am seeing first hand that many existing and new podcasting
related companies are trying to make podcasting an easier process for the
listener and viewer. I also believe that content quality and selection is
getting better everyday. I do think the coming 12 months will be a very
important new phase for podcasters and podcast consumers.  I think the
technology of easier discovery, management and anywhere delivery will make
for a dramatic leap forward in 2008.

What can we all do today to start making a difference in this area and here
is my to do/wish list:

1) Make podcast RSS feed links available in addition to our iTunes links on
our websites
2) Promote alternative distribution platforms to other devices as much as
possible in your shows and on your site
3) Submit your podcast RSS feeds to all available aggregators, mobile
platforms, podcast networks to build a true online syndicated distribution
strategy
4) Make sure your site visitors can listen or watch your content easily on
your website
5) Reach out and talk to mainstream media and online media folks to tell
them how the meaning of Podcasting is changing to go beyond the iPod
6) On all of our blogs, feeds, graphics and websites use the terms &quot;Portable
On-Demand&quot; in as many places as possible

Get the coming podcasting expos to discuss this topic and play up this
change in terms to describe the industry.  Tim from the PME has always had
this vision with the Portable Media and Podcast Expo and I just want to ramp
it up.

I am hearing more and more private discussion about working to change the

We are seeing many new distribution platforms on mobile, coming Zune support

Sorry.  That's not it either.  Creative has had cheaper and mostly
superior players for pretty much the entire history of the iPod.  And
their market share has been abysmal that entire time.  What does the
iPod have?  Better ease of use, slicker design, and viral marketing
that can't be beat.  No one else seems able to address those.

Whatever challenges it, it's not going to be the standard fare from
the standard competitors.  I do think the Zune, with all of the money
behind it, had more potential than any other recent device; but
Microsoft squandered that potential by alienating its customers and
most of its former content partners with stupid limitations.  The Xbox
360 shows that Microsoft *can* be cool and stay in touch with the
current generation if it makes the right decisions.  But they blew it
on this one.

Sony Walkman, nobody ever *beat* Sony but rather the market watered
down with so many knock offs that it just didn't matter anymore.

My 3rd Gen iPod recently bit the dust.  I've been using my new Sony-Ericsson
Walkman phone in its place.  The phone's built-in media player works well.
But it lacks a lot of the simplicity and intuitiveness that are synonymous
with the iPod.  One thing Apple seems to understand above and beyond all
other tech companies is, &quot;It's the interface, stupid.&quot;  No one's going to
build a true iPod killer until they understand this simple point.

Oddly, and I suppose it was because I'd been using
other MP3 players for a long time before trying an
iPod, I found it hard to get used to.  My first player
(that silly Muvo thing that Audible was giving away)
had two buttons for volume.  One pointed up and the
other pointed down.  I figured that out in a sec.  The
spin-your-finger-around-a-wheel thing?  Not so easy,
at least to me.

The fact is, podcasts are rapidly approaching parity with all other delivery
methods.

(See Podcast Parity on Careers in Podcasting, http://tinyurl.com/2ntckx )

People aren't going to know, nor necessarily care, where their entertainment
comes from, only that it is available. Shows can be delivered via broadcast
tv, cable, satellite, podcast download, Joost and other VOD, whatever.

Look at the Apple TV, which is only the beginning of the change. The main
menu consists of Music, TV, YouTube, Podcasts, et al.  Joost is looking to
imbed its software into cable boxes already.

I see the term podcast falling away over time for the much more generic term
&quot;show&quot;. After all, aren't they all just shows like all the others?

Excellent suggestions Rob.  I've got a paper I'm writing on blogging
and podcasting that's due in about 2 weeks and I'll be giving a
presentation on podcasting in October.  I'll incorporate &quot;Portable On
Demand Casting&quot; into both of these.  My audience (college instructors)
are still confused about the need for an ipod to listen to podcasts.
The clarification is definitely needed.

Also: this discussions sounds a lot like the one  aover the word
&quot;album&quot;.  I've seen it happen a few times in conversation: can a CD be
called an &quot;album&quot;?  Nobody seems to be really hung up about this term,
but it's interesting.

Again, good suggestions Rob.

&gt; What can we all do today to start making a difference in this area
and here

&gt; 1) Make podcast RSS feed links available in addition to our iTunes
links on

&gt; 2) Promote alternative distribution platforms to other devices as

distribution
&gt; strategy
&gt; 4) Make sure your site visitors can listen or watch your content
easily on
&gt; your website
&gt; 5) Reach out and talk to mainstream media and online media folks to tell
&gt; them how the meaning of Podcasting is changing to go beyond the iPod
&gt; 6) On all of our blogs, feeds, graphics and websites use the terms
&quot;Portable
&gt; On-Demand&quot; in as many places as possible

&gt; Get the coming podcasting expos to discuss this topic and play up this

&gt; This will not be another gripe post about how bad the term podcast
is to the
&gt; long term growth of portable media. You will never again hear me
bash it.
&gt; It is here to stay and we need to make the best of the situation.

&gt; I am hearing more and more private discussion about working to
change the
&gt; meaning of the term &quot;Podcast&quot; away from a strong connection with the
iPod
&gt; and making the name mean &quot;Portable On-Demand Cast&quot;. I think this makes a
&gt; lot of sense because the name podcast is here to stay and it is more
often
&gt; then not understood to mean a piece of content and less to mean a
type of
&gt; distribution. This transition will take time as most have been
conditioned
&gt; to connect the iPod with Podcasting in thinking about the medium.

&gt; I think with the coming support for podcasting on the Zune, we have an
&gt; opportunity to muddy the meaning to mean something a little more
open and
&gt; less Apple-centric.

&gt; The challenge to everyone in the podcast industry is to start
talking about
&gt; this rebranding concept. I think it is important to the future of a
strong
&gt; and diverse distribution ecosystem that users will understand better.

&gt; Podcasting today has a user understanding and communications
challenge that
&gt; can be addresses by all parties involved at all levels in the
industry. I
&gt; also think that it is important to move beyond the singular focus
that many
&gt; podcasters large and small have on iTunes and the iPod.

&gt; We are seeing many new distribution platforms on mobile, coming Zune
support
&gt; of podcasting and other types of mobile and living room devices that
will
&gt; bring greater success to content creators.

&gt; Podcasters need to be sure they offer their podcast RSS feeds right
on their
&gt; websites and stop only linking over to iTunes.

&gt; What do all of you think of this direction?

&gt; FYI, I am no longer working at or on the Melodeo &quot;Mobilcast&quot; Mobile

An &quot;album&quot; is a collection. Photo album. The confusion is whether or not a
CD can be a &quot;record.&quot; &quot;Record album&quot; is a collection of recordings.
Personally I think you can say &quot;we have a new album&quot; coming out, but &quot;we
have a new record coming out&quot; sounds anachronistic, as &quot;record&quot; became so
identified with the thing itself. Silly thing, language.

Ivy,

I do agree with your thoughts from a 30,000 foot future view of podcasting.
But, I still think we have an association issue to the iPod that needs to
have the message changed.  I agree that Portable On-Demand Broadcast is a
rather geeky and technical concept still and is not entirely mainstream.
The truth is that we need a transition path of understanding and
communication that goes totally through the insiders and outsiders that will
eventually evolve into what you are saying that over time the concept of
podcasting will disappear and it will be as simple as clicking a play button
for most people and the technology of it will be invisible.  The truth is we
are not to that place and and we need a way to transition the message.

Eventually the term will take on its own meaning
divorced from its roots anyway. It's already going
that way. How often do you hear the word &quot;dial tone&quot;,
as in &quot;a signal that your phone is ready for you to
turn the dial&quot;? When was the last time you saw a
rotary phone? There isn't much need to change it to a
&quot;push button tone&quot;.

These kinds of anachronisms are caught in the
linguistic ether all the time, and no one really pays
any attention to them. It's still a &quot;television&quot; when
I'm watching a DVD from a player mere feet away (the
root &quot;tele&quot; means &quot;distant&quot;). We have Internet
&quot;radio&quot; stations that have no connection to radio
waves.

It won't take long for podcasting to lose any
associations with any particular technology, and that
is as it should be. The distribution method doesn't
matter nearly as much as the contents. If I hand you
a copy Fireside on an audio CD, no RSS involved, no
mp3 involved, it would still be a podcast.

My 2 cents anyway.

I think any term you must constantly explain is an inherent failure. The
point is to associate the word podcast with what a podcast is, and do it
repeatedly and clearly without marrying it to iPods. The story behind the
word is largely irrelevant; 99.9% of the people who drink Coke have no idea
where that word came from, and they shouldn't have to.

I think I just hit this in practice.  I set up a second feed of
Knitting Step by Step for iTunes since a good chunk of my viewers were
watching it that way.  I figured I'd convert the file to mp4 and put
it in a second feed and they wouldn't all have to run the video
converter.

The script was supposed to go like this:

Jason:  We have easier support for iTunes.  Tell me about that.

Ivy:  I set up a second feed that uses mp4 files, instead of the mkv
files in the main feed.  Technical, but it basically means you can
subscribe via iTunes and the format will be better for your iPod.

Jason:  And we have a new wiki.

Instead, he went off script and explained where one might buy an iPod.
To me, if you tell someone where to get a device, it means they need
that device.  So I have to edit that out--my first time tweaking video
like that.  I also have to tweak the beginning part of when I show the
purl stitch and didn't realize the camera was going.  So it's about 90
second of staring at my hands holding yarn, doing nothing.  Oops.
Time to learn how to splice out sections.

Steven, I agree with your comments. It seems like all we need to do is
slightly change how we all talk about and market podcasting in our blogs and
to the media. This slight change in message could make a dramatic
difference.  I am seeing first hand that many existing and new podcasting
related companies are trying to make podcasting an easier process for the
listener and viewer. I also believe that content quality and selection is
getting better everyday. I do think the coming 12 months will be a very
important new phase for podcasters and podcast consumers.  I think the
technology of easier discovery, management and anywhere delivery will make
for a dramatic leap forward in 2008.

What can we all do today to start making a difference in this area and here
is my to do/wish list:

1) Make podcast RSS feed links available in addition to our iTunes links on
our websites
2) Promote alternative distribution platforms to other devices as much as
possible in your shows and on your site
3) Submit your podcast RSS feeds to all available aggregators, mobile
platforms, podcast networks to build a true online syndicated distribution
strategy
4) Make sure your site visitors can listen or watch your content easily on
your website
5) Reach out and talk to mainstream media and online media folks to tell
them how the meaning of Podcasting is changing to go beyond the iPod
6) On all of our blogs, feeds, graphics and websites use the terms &quot;Portable
On-Demand&quot; in as many places as possible

Get the coming podcasting expos to discuss this topic and play up this
change in terms to describe the industry.  Tim from the PME has always had
this vision with the Portable Media and Podcast Expo and I just want to ramp
it up.

Subject: [podcasters] Portable On-Demand Cast = Podcast

This will not be another gripe post about how bad the term podcast is to the
long term growth of portable media. You will never again hear me bash it.
It is here to stay and we need to make the best of the situation.

I am hearing more and more private discussion about working to change the
meaning of the term &quot;Podcast&quot; away from a strong connection with the iPod
and making the name mean &quot;Portable On-Demand Cast&quot;. I think this makes a
lot of sense because the name podcast is here to stay and it is more often
then not understood to mean a piece of content and less to mean a type of
distribution. This transition will take time as most have been conditioned
to connect the iPod with Podcasting in thinking about the medium.

I think with the coming support for podcasting on the Zune, we have an
opportunity to muddy the meaning to mean something a little more open and
less Apple-centric.

The challenge to everyone in the podcast industry is to start talking about
this rebranding concept. I think it is important to the future of a strong
and diverse distribution ecosystem that users will understand better.

Podcasting today has a user understanding and communications challenge that
can be addresses by all parties involved at all levels in the industry. I
also think that it is important to move beyond the singular focus that many
podcasters large and small have on iTunes and the iPod.

We are seeing many new distribution platforms on mobile, coming Zune support
of podcasting and other types of mobile and living room devices that will
bring greater success to content creators.

Podcasters need to be sure they offer their podcast RSS feeds right on their
websites and stop only linking over to iTunes.

What do all of you think of this direction?

FYI, I am no longer working at or on the Melodeo &quot;Mobilcast&quot; Mobile
Podcasting product.

Hi Rob:

I find your post very interesting because it exposes the fact that it
is really the World Wide Web that is the &quot;Cable System&quot; and iTunes or
a network's web page, or a podcaster's website that can be seen
almost as &quot;Channels.&quot; It's like if you love Seinfeld and it plays on
4 different stations. You may only go to the station that you've
heard of, or you may learn about other stations if you do a search
through Tivo or other DVR. The fact is, 90% of people are going to
watch Seinfeld on the station that heavily pays to advertise that
it's on that station, or the station that people used to watch it on
in the past.

I think that iTunes has, in many ways helped to bring in the major
media (for better or worse), which in turn brings in the general
public. They watch TV and the people on TV say they have podcasts
(and they can be found on iTunes). Immediately a lot of people know
about podcasting and iTunes. That's probably why American Idol chose
iTunes to partner with to help sell music related to the show. The
fact that Apple advertises on American Idol and the fact that music
downloads on iTunes are so popular also helps drive more awareness
about podcasts.

Like millions of other people from all walks of life around the
world, I read Time magazine and watch CNN. Anderson Cooper, at the
end of his broadcast says something like this:  &quot;You can download
highlights of the AC360 podcast at &lt; http://www.cnn.com/podcast &gt;  or
you can search for it on iTunes.&quot; He usually then says it is the most
popular podcast in the universe (or something like that) and....you
don't even need an iPod.

I'm curious, if others on this list watch Anderson Cooper, do you
think that he has helped people to understand that no iPod is
necessary to watch? I would be curious if you ask someone who knows
little or nothing about podcasting, but who watches AC360 if they
need an iPod to listen to a podcast. I wonder if they'll say &quot;What's
a Podcast?&quot;

I mention Time magazine because it is so widely distributed, and
Richard Stengel, managing editor recently recommended people check
out their podcasts in his letter from the editor.

Just some food for thought,

Andrew Darlow

Rob

When I release my book on Podcasting two years ago, I got some criticism
from folks calling podcasting &quot;Portable On-Demand Cast&quot; it is how I have
described podcasting to people for the past two years so while I am glad to
see some people get on board with it. I saw Larry King the other night saw
subscribe to our Podcast and get Larry King on your portable device.. So I
guess in a way CNN is helping but I am sure we will never beyond the fact
that people are going to think they need a iPod

Microsoft is partly to blame as well because they have been so slow to join
the party.

Ivy,

I do agree with your thoughts from a 30,000 foot future view of podcasting.
But, I still think we have an association issue to the iPod that needs to
have the message changed.  I agree that Portable On-Demand Broadcast is a
rather geeky and technical concept still and is not entirely mainstream.
The truth is that we need a transition path of understanding and
communication that goes totally through the insiders and outsiders that will
eventually evolve into what you are saying that over time the concept of
podcasting will disappear and it will be as simple as clicking a play button
for most people and the technology of it will be invisible.  The truth is we
are not to that place and and we need a way to transition the message.

Eventually the term will take on its own meaning
divorced from its roots anyway. It's already going
that way. How often do you hear the word &quot;dial tone&quot;,
as in &quot;a signal that your phone is ready for you to
turn the dial&quot;? When was the last time you saw a
rotary phone? There isn't much need to change it to a
&quot;push button tone&quot;.

These kinds of anachronisms are caught in the
linguistic ether all the time, and no one really pays
any attention to them. It's still a &quot;television&quot; when
I'm watching a DVD from a player mere feet away (the
root &quot;tele&quot; means &quot;distant&quot;). We have Internet
&quot;radio&quot; stations that have no connection to radio
waves.

It won't take long for podcasting to lose any
associations with any particular technology, and that
is as it should be. The distribution method doesn't
matter nearly as much as the contents. If I hand you
a copy Fireside on an audio CD, no RSS involved, no
mp3 involved, it would still be a podcast.

My 2 cents anyway.

In the short term, probably.  There are still people who want to know
if they need an iPod to listen to podcasts (and one person who thought
all podcasts started with the phrase, &quot;This is Audible&quot;, a story for
another time).

I guess it's a matter of what kind of time frame you're looking at.
Telephones, which have given us such legacy terms as &quot;dial-up&quot;, &quot;dial
tone&quot; and &quot;dialing a number&quot;, is only a few decades old.  A friend's
grandmother told me about when her neighbor first got a wall-mounted
phone (and for the puppies on the list, this was before the days of
cordless phones, so you had to stay pretty near it to use it).  The
neighbor came rushing into the grandmother's apartment all upset.
&quot;Rosie,&quot; she said.  &quot;My husband's gone crazy.  He's talking to the
wall.&quot;

My step-father first encountered television in prison.  They were far
from ubiquitous at the time.  And now we're using the term to mean
things far removed from the roots of the word.

IMHO pushing the delivery method is like putting the cart before the
horse.  It's the whole &quot;killer app&quot; thing.  No one wanted a device
built to intercept, decode, and render audio and video signals
broadcast over public airways.  They wanted to watch the Honeymooners.
No one wants to download mp3 files via RSS to a portable media
device.  They want to listen to Morevi.  They're only going to want to
know HOW this works (or more to the point, how to make it work for
them) after they decide that they want what it offers.

But wouldn't the ballgame I'm watching right now be considered an &quot;e-cast&quot;?
&quot;Podcast&quot; is simple.going overboard with overly techy names will not do much
to help win over new listeners.  As others have said before me, the term
podcast will take on a meaning of its own.  Creating an identity crisis will
turn a lot of people away.  The term podcast has been around long enough to
be recognizable; at least you're halfway home if you have to explain to

Yeah, short for electronic broadcast. Nothing really fancy, but simple and

Personally, I'm of the opinion that the whole &quot;podcast = ipod&quot; thing
is a canard.  Yeah, maybe a few people have thought they needed an
ipod to listen to a podcast but to many people, any mp3 player is an
&quot;ipod&quot;.  If you look at the design of mp3 players these days, they're
not doing anything to lessen the confusion:

I was listening to my own machine the other day and someone came up
and said, &quot;What'cha got on your ipod?&quot;

http://www.bharatpetroleum.com/petrozine/quart3_2006/object_big.gif

&quot;It's not an ipod, it's just an mp3 player.&quot;

&quot;Hunh?&quot;

The guy is, by the way, a brilliant network administrator who keeps
our system humming along smoothly... not a technophobe.

Hmmm. I don't know. I know of a few people when I said that I was getting into podcasting, that said, &quot;We'd listen to you, but we don't have an iPod.&quot; They had no clue that they could listen on their computer, and when I told them about it, they were still concerned with compatibility to the PC. These are people that work with me at a semiconductor plant, and deal with technology everyday. A few of them have degrees in computer engineering.

Aside from the Mac vs. PC idea, I don't think it's as universal as you think. Podcasting is fairly new, as not everyone is as quick to learn new technologies. My grandmother has webTv and might really be interested in a knitting podcast, but if she can't figure it out, she won't listen.

For one thing, &quot;Internet radio&quot; already has a different, commonly

have an online radio show&quot; I'd envision something I'd have to tune
into at a certain time each week, that I'd have to listen to on my
computer, and that I couldn't save for later listening.

If your content is in the form of audio files that can be downloaded
onto a computer *or* a portable device, that can be listened to over
and over at the listener's convenience, and that can be subscribed to
on a feed for regular updates -- well, there's a term for it that more
and more people are familiar with, and that term isn't &quot;radio show&quot; or
&quot;broadcast.&quot;  The term is &quot;podcast.&quot;

If she's into knitting and she's online, she's
probably heard of Knit Picks http://knitpicks.com/ If
not, show her that.  Really good yarn on the cheap.
Free patterns.  It's wildly popular with knitters.
And, they have a very good podcast.  Go to the
Knitting Room http://knitpicks.com/Content/index.php
and amidst all the useful technique articles, there is
a link for their podcast.  There's an iTunes link, an
RSS link, and an mp3 file she can download directly.

Well, I say podcast. And I'll continue to. Other people's ignorance isn't my
problem, and catering to ignorance because of its commonality doesn't
exactly let it off the hook. I have a podcast. There ya go.

Todd,

I do agree that Podcasting will always be linked up with the iPod from a
historical perspective, but devices come and go.  You could have said that
about the Sony Walkman, but a new and better device came along and replaced
it called an iPod.  I believe the same thing will happen to the iPod as one
day a better device will be seen as cooler.  I think we are already seeing
that day come closer with the launch of the iPhone and other true mobile
devices with wireless connections.  We shall see if Apple can keep the iPod
viable over the long-run.  I do hope that a better device does come that
becomes a wild hit as I think it would be good for all of us.

Rob

When I release my book on Podcasting two years ago, I got some criticism
from folks calling podcasting &quot;Portable On-Demand Cast&quot; it is how I have
described podcasting to people for the past two years so while I am glad to
see some people get on board with it. I saw Larry King the other night saw
subscribe to our Podcast and get Larry King on your portable device.. So I
guess in a way CNN is helping but I am sure we will never beyond the fact
that people are going to think they need a iPod

Microsoft is partly to blame as well because they have been so slow to join
the party.

&gt; This will not be another gripe post about how bad the term podcast is to
the
&gt; long term growth of portable media. You will never again hear me bash it.
&gt; It is here to stay and we need to make the best of the situation.

&gt; I am hearing more and more private discussion about working to change the
&gt; meaning of the term &quot;Podcast&quot; away from a strong connection with the iPod
&gt; and making the name mean &quot;Portable On-Demand Cast&quot;. I think this makes a
&gt; lot of sense because the name podcast is here to stay and it is more often
&gt; then not understood to mean a piece of content and less to mean a type of
&gt; distribution. This transition will take time as most have been conditioned
&gt; to connect the iPod with Podcasting in thinking about the medium.,___

I think we are still very early to the podcasting party and I see a huge
upside ahead of us with Microsoft coming to the podcasting party with Zune.
I think is 2008 we all have a chance to really move the industry forward on
many fronts.  I think we all have a responsibility to start being positive
about alternative listening platforms and getting companies making those
platforms to advertise and promote the fact that the iPod is not needed to
get podcasts.  We also need to talk about alternative ways of getting
podcasts in our shows and on our websites.

We all think Apple has cool products and they have been what has moved
podcasting forward, but I think to keep the growth going we cannot just sit
back and let Apple control our future. Podcasting started with us and Apple
has just taken advantage of it in a way that early on discouraged companies
like Microsoft from jumping in. I think this is about to change and let's be
much more open about our distribution and not let Apple control our future
success.

The question is what can we all do to help change the message about
podcasting?

For me, with Knitting Step by Step, I didn't care so
much if it was a podcast or a series of videos or
whatever, as long as it got out there, so I did things
like put them up on YouTube and link to the YouTube
files in the show notes.  I also set the files up on
the website so that they would play on the page.

I release on an erratic schedule based on how long it
should take to finish the assignment for the episode,
so I offered to e-mail people when a new episode goes
live and a bunch of people took me up on that.

I didn't push the idea of it being a podcast, I pushed
the idea of it being knitting lessons and, of the now
700 people who watch the show, over 200 don't use any
sort of podcatcher at all.  Two people have
subscribed, not to the feed, but to the YouTube
videos.

So I guess I kind of worked around the technology for
people who weren't comfortable with it yet.  I don't
know if that answers your concern (and it's past
midnight, so I don't know if I'm plum rambling).

When people ask me what a podcast is, I say it is a usually free portable
show you get on the web that you can experience right there or take with you
on an MP3 player, and further, it can be talkshow, music or a movie. If they
haven't run away from me halfway through my speech, they are intrigued
enough to want to know more, so I ask them what they like and I point them
to a few shows that I like.
