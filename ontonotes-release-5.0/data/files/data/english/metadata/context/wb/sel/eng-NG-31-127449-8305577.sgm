Kooky Keillor blames Bush for the river crossing collapse? In as far as
he states that it takes disaster to get things done, that's pretty
bloody obvious. One wonders though why Minnesota didn't find the money
to fix this span, why it needed to wait for it to collapse first so
congress would feel impelled to act. Of course every other state is in
the same situation, they all have broken bridges that they refuse to
find the funds to fix.

So what's new, or news here?

Both before and after this disaster, I've seen quite a bit of discussion
of  the US's crumbling infrastructure.

It's too late, really, to blame the last 20-30-50 years of
administrations, local through Oval Office, for the situation. And I
don't know that it's fair to blame anyone currently in office for 20
years of neglected upkeep on 100, 500, 5,000,000 neglected items under
their jurisdiction.

'Cuz it's you, the voters and taxpayers, that did it. You voted for
tax-cutters and &quot;anti-government-waste&quot; candidates. You approved,
tacitly or overtly, budgets that spent as little on 'invisible
infrastructure' as possible while putting a park down the street or
holding property taxes to an absurdly low level or getting a financially
meaningless refund check or subsidizing a pro sports team.

I've seen estimates that place the do-it-now cost of this deferred
maintenance as high as $12 trillion. Let's say that's a media figure and
ten times too high. So we need to come up with, say, $1.25 trillion to
fix all these problems and keep old ladies, moms and schoolbusses full
of kids from falling off bridges and being swept away by broken dams and
failed levees and collapsing tunnels. That's about $4,200 per person,
every man, woman, child, shemale, illegal and vegetable in the country.

checks - one per person in your household - to...

You blame Bush for 9/11 even though the principals were in the US
training to commit the terrorist act before he was even president. So
why not blame Bush for the bridge collapse?

Property taxes are dangerous because they can be used to take away
peoples' homes. A tax for simply owning something is therefore very
questionable. I would never use such a tax to fund the repair of an
interstate highway bridge. Interstate highway bridges should be funded
by gas taxes and taxes on trucks based on weight. State roads should be
funded by state gasoline taxes and taxes on trucks based on weight.

The most obvious response is to use the SSTF surplus to buy bonds that
invest in this repair and to pay back those bonds using tolls that are
on the roads/bridges/tunnels/whatevers only so long as needed to pay

I think the only toll highway in B.C. is the Coquihalla, and it remains
in public hands, though maintenance on all provincial highways has been
contracted out for many years. The provincial government announced a few
years ago it would &quot;privatize&quot; the road and the contractor would collect
the tolls, etc. There was a public uproar, elected representatives in
the area were firmly told by their constituents that neither they nor
their party would ever get another vote if this went through, and the
government quickly retreated.

The Coquihalla remains a toll road, but only because the capital cost
plus interest hasn't been paid off yet. It's not private.

Without getting into another tedious morass in which my time-limited
replies will be judged insufficient and arrogant, I can point out that
with few exceptions you can only own property because of the
infrastructure provided in which to own it. And that infrastructure goes
far beyond individual, pay-as-you-go elements. So charging property
owners for the costs of that infrastructure is both reasonable and
necessary.

You also can't opt out of that infrastructure, so if you're going to
'own' a home and chunk of dirt within it, the ultimate right of the
infrastructure providers to remove you from the benefits of the
infrastructure, as a last resort, is not excessive.

What's key here is that real property is unique in this characteristic.
Even cars and trucks, as you note, are somewhere between real and other
property - no one can arbitrarily take away a vehicle as they can real
property for which property 'taxes' are not paid, but they shurezell can
prevent you from driving it on public infrastructure without paying the
overall toll and meeting standards.

I think that a big part of the problem here is that it's still called a
'tax,' which sets off brain-explosions in this vastly anti-tax era. It's
not really a tax any longer, any more than your water, sewage or garbage
fees - which often come from a different office in the same building -
are 'taxes.'

Maybe an arbitrary surcharge on a farm somewhere miles from any sort of
infrastructure is an objectionable tax. But not much property falls into
that category any more. Certainly nothing even slightly within the
bounds of 'civilization.'

1) Where did I say that? I've uniformly opposed tolls on roads beyond
paying for them. I've also uniformly opposed restrictions (by forcing
you to pay) for access to natural birthrights that all Americans should
be able to access without cost. By that I mean national parks. I don't
oppose charging for use of improved campgrounds or the like.

Limit the payments to whatever it really costs for the real services to
that property. If government wants to do other things, say fund schools,
which currently eat most of the property taxes, it should be getting
that money from somewhere else. There should also be protections for
homes and farms so people in difficult times don't have to leave
Oklahoma for California, cause if it happens in California, where are

&gt;&gt; &gt;The most obvious response is to use the SSTF surplus to buy bonds that
&gt;&gt; &gt;invest in this repair and to pay back those bonds using tolls that are
&gt;&gt; &gt;on the roads/bridges/tunnels/whatevers only so long as needed to pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;back the bonds.

&gt;&gt; Why the limited term?  I thought that you liked charging for the use
&gt;&gt; of assets.

&gt;&gt; In BC, a major toll freeway was leased to a private consortium a few
&gt;&gt; years back.  I don't know whether the toll had paid back the
&gt;&gt; construction by that point.  But the toll stayed.

&gt;I think the only toll highway in B.C. is the Coquihalla, and it remains
&gt;in public hands, though maintenance on all provincial highways has been
&gt;contracted out for many years. The provincial government announced a few
&gt;years ago it would &quot;privatize&quot; the road and the contractor would collect
&gt;the tolls, etc. There was a public uproar, elected representatives in
&gt;the area were firmly told by their constituents that neither they nor
&gt;their party would ever get another vote if this went through, and the
&gt;government quickly retreated.

&gt;The Coquihalla remains a toll road, but only because the capital cost
&gt;plus interest hasn't been paid off yet. It's not private.

I misremembered the argument.  I thought that the Coq privatization
(really a long lease) had gone through, in a similar &quot;damn the
torpedos&quot; mood to that which sent BC Rail to CN.  (following which CN
got into the habit of dropping trains into rivers and lakes.  The
regional railway took maintenance more seriously than the megacorp.)

He was commenting on the ritual of post-disaster political theater.
Bush played his role.  Bush was not the only one.

If you read the entire piece, you might be able to spot where Keillor

I concur. Property taxes for this should only cover whatever law
enforcement or other emergency response is ever expected. (And no, I don't
think those can be done on a pay-as-you-go basis. They need to be handled
more like group insurance, although the individual cost of maintaining that
structure could be supplemented by specific response charges, as is now
often done.)

Hold that thought.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So you are all right with taxing people out of their homes? That's
&gt; really what it comes down to.
">

Short answer? Yes.

Longer answer: Yes. It should be a humane and understanding policy, but
in the end, if you can't pay for all that makes your house and parcel
possible, then it's not much different from not being able to pay for
the sticks and paper that comprise it. You (that universal you) expects
the vast sweep of societal support; since you can't turn off many of
these generalized benefits, turning off payment for it is something that
the body can't tolerate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; What's key here is that real property is unique in this
&gt;&gt; characteristic. Even cars and trucks, as you note, are somewhere
&gt;&gt; between real and other property - no one can arbitrarily take away a
&gt;&gt; vehicle as they can real property for which property 'taxes' are not
&gt;&gt; paid, but they shurezell can prevent you from driving it on public
&gt;&gt; infrastructure without paying the overall toll and meeting standards.
&gt; But if you were unable to pay for a few years, you wouldn't lose the
&gt; car. With the real property, that's a real possibility. So we have
&gt; people risking a &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; situation but it's not the baddy
&gt; bank, it's the supposed to be good government doing the deed.
">

At the risk of being judged arrogant, Bill: shit happens. The function
of society is to spread out both the good and the bad, but there's no
way to make sure everyone shares every bit of good or remains unaffected
by any of the bad. If a person or family's situation has taken a hit and
property taxes can't be paid, there are often programs and extensions
and such to help. Can't pay the taxes for several years, which is the
limit of most such help? You're past a situation where property taxes
are the problem and the person or family needs to adjust.

It's much more complex than that, sure - see comments about brevity,
time and Usenet. But in general societal support of individual units has
to have limits. And sometimes those limits arrive with a rude and
painful bang. If (for example) your industry closes down and your spouse
is too ill to work and you run through your available assets and (as one
consequence) your property taxes don't get paid for three years... the
consequences from that are likely to be only a final nail in the coffin
of your former life, not an isolated gummental attack on your rights as
a citizen. Time to adjust.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Limit the payments to whatever it really costs for the real services
&gt; to that property. If government wants to do other things, say fund
&gt; schools, which currently eat most of the property taxes, it should be
&gt; getting that money from somewhere else. There should also be
&gt; protections for homes and farms so people in difficult times don't
&gt; have to leave Oklahoma for California, cause if it happens in
&gt; California, where are they going to go?
">

Back to Oklahoma, Idaho, Missouri and other places where they can live
the good life in their fishing shack 37 miles out on a logging road,
apparently. I've sat through an awful lot of this kind of discussion
lately.

You were holding that thought. Here, a final comment: There's a
continuing bit of nonsense - IMHO - about taxation that bothers me with
its selectivity and selfishness. Most people will concede that 'some
taxes are necessary and even (gasp) good.' But hardly any two agree on
what those some are. A vast number of people only approve of taxes that
pay for something they admit needs paying for - roads, cops,
firefighting - and see a personal need for. Anything else is damned
gummint nonsense they shouldn't have to pay for. People who don't drive
bitch about road taxes (as if their goods and livelihood-makers don't
come by road), who don't have kids (any more?) bitch about schools
(denying the incontrovertible arguments in favor of mass education),
etc. so forth. This kind of blinkered, I only want to pay for what I use
right now kind of thinking is contrary to any sense of what society and
consensual government brings individuals.

Right.  The government doesn't owe anyone a guarantee that they get to
keep their current job, house, or lifestyle.

And I think that applies to farmers, too.  There are an awful lot of
sob stories about people losing The Family Farm, but what's never
mentioned is that there are equal numbers of people making a success
of growing, say, organic vegetables on a small scale.  Why should a
farmer who's a bad business manager be able to expect continual bail-
outs any more than any other business owner?

This is incomprehensible to me. Bush has been a good if not great
president in very difficult times. I know his mode of speech and that
all isn't exactly Great Communicator level but he's a good guy. I don't
blame him for actually leading either. That's where I think I have

anything, never took chances, I mean in policy matters.

Which means I think that the amount of tax based on a supposed

houses that don't have smoke detectors or are otherwise more risky?

the possibly (in say California or Australia) of wildfires getting in

&gt; Longer answer: Yes. It should be a humane and understanding policy, but
&gt; in the end, if you can't pay for all that makes your house and parcel
&gt; possible, then it's not much different from not being able to pay for
&gt; the sticks and paper that comprise it. You (that universal you) expects
&gt; the vast sweep of societal support; since you can't turn off many of
&gt; these generalized benefits, turning off payment for it is something that
&gt; the body can't tolerate.

I don't think it's a huge problem to allow it if the person can show
financial need and it's their primary residence. Beyond that, taking
away their house is going exactly in the opposite direction of policy
ideals. You'll ask what if they've overbought, one of those subprime
loans or something.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What's key here is that real property is unique in this
&gt; &gt;&gt; characteristic. Even cars and trucks, as you note, are somewhere
&gt; &gt;&gt; between real and other property - no one can arbitrarily take away a
&gt; &gt;&gt; vehicle as they can real property for which property 'taxes' are not
&gt; &gt;&gt; paid, but they shurezell can prevent you from driving it on public
&gt; &gt;&gt; infrastructure without paying the overall toll and meeting standards.

&gt; &gt; But if you were unable to pay for a few years, you wouldn't lose the
&gt; &gt; car. With the real property, that's a real possibility. So we have
&gt; &gt; people risking a &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; situation but it's not the baddy
&gt; &gt; bank, it's the supposed to be good government doing the deed.

&gt; At the risk of being judged arrogant, Bill: shit happens. The function
&gt; of society is to spread out both the good and the bad, but there's no
&gt; way to make sure everyone shares every bit of good or remains unaffected
&gt; by any of the bad. If a person or family's situation has taken a hit and
&gt; property taxes can't be paid, there are often programs and extensions
&gt; and such to help. Can't pay the taxes for several years, which is the
&gt; limit of most such help? You're past a situation where property taxes
&gt; are the problem and the person or family needs to adjust.
">

But what if the taxes are enormous? What if they are making you pay for
all sorts of services that don't involve you? This is why I originally
said that property taxes should pay for things related to the actual
property and not all the other wonderful things that government feels
the need to do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's much more complex than that, sure - see comments about brevity,
&gt; time and Usenet. But in general societal support of individual units has
&gt; to have limits. And sometimes those limits arrive with a rude and
&gt; painful bang. If (for example) your industry closes down and your spouse
&gt; is too ill to work and you run through your available assets and (as one
&gt; consequence) your property taxes don't get paid for three years... the
&gt; consequences from that are likely to be only a final nail in the coffin
&gt; of your former life, not an isolated gummental attack on your rights as
&gt; a citizen. Time to adjust.

So Henry Fonda and his family drive off to California. We have to decide
what our societal policy is, what our actual goals are. Each country and
the citizens of each country have to do that. There will be different
decisions. And that's good.

&gt; &gt; Limit the payments to whatever it really costs for the real services
&gt; &gt; to that property. If government wants to do other things, say fund
&gt; &gt; schools, which currently eat most of the property taxes, it should be
&gt; &gt; getting that money from somewhere else. There should also be
&gt; &gt; protections for homes and farms so people in difficult times don't
&gt; &gt; have to leave Oklahoma for California, cause if it happens in
&gt; &gt; California, where are they going to go?

&gt; Back to Oklahoma, Idaho, Missouri and other places where they can live
&gt; the good life in their fishing shack 37 miles out on a logging road,
&gt; apparently. I've sat through an awful lot of this kind of discussion

Making the assumption that adverse possession is allowed. These really
are meaty issues that need to be more fully fleshed out. There certainly
doesn't seem to be any grand plan. The solution can't be to dispose of

Think about Farm Aid and all the moaning about farmers.

&gt; You were holding that thought. Here, a final comment: There's a
&gt; continuing bit of nonsense - IMHO - about taxation that bothers me with
&gt; its selectivity and selfishness. Most people will concede that 'some
&gt; taxes are necessary and even (gasp) good.' But hardly any two agree on
&gt; what those some are. A vast number of people only approve of taxes that
&gt; pay for something they admit needs paying for - roads, cops,

You could bet your egg money on this proposition -- that the case of
Jenkins v. Commissioner  will never get to oral argument in the Supreme
Court. Together with hundreds of other pending petitions, the case is
doomed to instant dismissal when the Court gets back to work in the
fall. Even so, every lost cause deserves a parting wave, and this cause
is more lost than most.

The Jenkins in the case is Daniel Taylor Jenkins of Saranac Lake, N.Y.
He is 54 years old, a hydro-geologist by profession, a practicing member
of the Religious Society of Friends. The commissioner in the case is
Mark W. Everson, chief of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
...
Writing in March for a unanimous panel of the Second Circuit, Judge Jose
Cabranes refused to cut Daniel Jenkins any slack at all: The panel
granted him the sincerity of his religious convictions, but it found his
arguments under RFRA &quot;without merit.&quot; Similarly, the Ninth Amendment was
no help to him. The Ninth is not an independent source of individual
rights. It is no more than &quot;a 'rule of construction' that we apply in
certain cases.&quot;

Granted, said Judge Cabranes, there was a time when conscientious
objectors could be accommodated in their objection to supporting
military service. For example, a New York law of 1814 provided that
money received from Quakers could not be used to support the state
militia. It would be used instead for educational and charitable
purposes.

That time was long ago and far away. Today no citizen has a right to
negotiate alternative taxes by proclaiming his genuinely held religious
objections to military service. The rule applies, said Judge Cabranes,
&quot;no matter how sincerely those convictions may be held.&quot;

All that remains to be said to Daniel Jenkins' counsel is, &quot;Nice try!&quot;
The Ninth Amendment may not be dead -- but it surely looks that way.

I'm not sure what you mean, this being a question of opinion. There is
no one way to write, no one way to punctuate, there are many views. I
would, for example, almost entirely eschew the semicolon. The bang's
right out too.

This situation certainly is a style point, but not including a question
mark in a question word sentence that is rhetorical serves to set it
off, similar to using a specific sign to show that it is a rhetorical
question, ie the rhetorical question mark.

In the minimalist style, which I tend to subscribe to in punctuation, I
would also probably not include a question mark in a real question that
had a not-question tag ending clause. My rule is something like, is the
end of the sentence spoken with a rising question tone? If it is,
include the question mark, otherwise don't.

collapsed bridge, he &quot;promised&quot; that it would be rebuilt quickly and
recovery assistance would be provided.

So my question is this:  He said the same damn thing in New Orleans
two years ago, and the place is still a smoking ruin.  So is
Minneapolis jumping to the front of the queue, or do we have to wait
for New Orleans to get their assistance first before we get ours?

&gt;&gt; &gt;In the minimalist style, which I tend to subscribe to in punctuation, I
&gt;&gt; &gt;would also probably not include a question mark in a real question that
&gt;&gt; &gt;had a not-question tag ending clause. My rule is something like, is the
&gt;&gt; &gt;end of the sentence spoken with a rising question tone? If it is,
&gt;&gt; &gt;include the question mark, otherwise don't.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, that and you misunderstood the Keillor quote.

&gt;&gt; Actually, I'm less than certain about the question mark.
&gt;&gt; If the omission is an error, it is a fairly minor one. Any
&gt;&gt; comments on that particular point will be appreciated.

&gt;I follow the &quot;rule&quot; that punctuation follows intonation. No question
&gt;intonation (of any variety), hence no question mark.

Oh, wow!  You've really backed up your assertion with hard data there,
Bill.  Nothing like a quote from another Usenet poster in another
group to lend yourself pseudo-credence, eh?

How are your supporters in email?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So this idea that I gave above isn't something that only I follow.

No, and nor are you alone in some of your other assertions.  Doesn't
mean much, though, does it?  Sorry ... &quot;doesn't mean much, does it.&quot;
Without the question mark, because you and another guy on Usenet think
rhetorical questions shouldn't have question marks.

(Did you notice, BTW, that he was in the minority on that thread?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You're full of shit, Bill, and the worst thing is, even when people
&gt;&gt; point this out to you, you don't back down and admit error.

&gt;What error?

See up there ^^.

You said &quot;a rhetorical question doesn't need a question mark&quot; (exact
quote), which is what I've been addressing.  The only thing that's got
twisted here is your logic.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You are a very silly person.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe but you and every single other reply didn't deal with what I said
&gt;&gt; &gt;other than the original *question*, which you took as a statement even
&gt;&gt; &gt;though it has a question mark on it. There's enough in that quote to
&gt;&gt; &gt;infer that Kooky Keillor is blaming Bush for the river crossing
&gt;&gt; &gt;collapse, but I wanted to be sure.

&gt;&gt; Read for comprehension, rather than the knee-jerk &quot;X is a Liberal, so
&gt;&gt; he/she must be wrong&quot; attitude you have, followed by weaseling and
&gt;&gt; feeble attempts to justify your own ignorance without losing face
&gt;&gt; (which never work, you might notice).

&gt;I have no idea what you are talking about.

Another Bondeism.

So do you believe that Keillor is *not* a &quot;liberal&quot;?  'Cos I think he
is, y'know.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's a big question.  You'll need to narrow the field a bit here.
Maybe reverse the question, give us a chance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Do you know who Keillor is?

Ah, a decent question.  Yes, I know who he is, and own several of his
books.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If you had the grace to admit that you're wrong, it wouldn't be so

&gt;&gt; Be a man, Bill.  Admit defeat.  Then start looking at *why* you were
&gt;&gt; wrong.

&gt;What am I supposedly wrong about? No one addressed anything beyond me
&gt;saying that Keillor was kooky, my opinion, while asking about him
&gt;blaming Bush for the crossing collapse.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The most obvious response is to use the SSTF surplus to buy bonds that
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;invest in this repair and to pay back those bonds using tolls that are
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;on the roads/bridges/tunnels/whatevers only so long as needed to pay
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;back the bonds.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why the limited term?  I thought that you liked charging for the use
&gt;&gt;&gt; of assets.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In BC, a major toll freeway was leased to a private consortium a few
&gt;&gt;&gt; years back.  I don't know whether the toll had paid back the
&gt;&gt;&gt; construction by that point.  But the toll stayed.

&gt;&gt;I think the only toll highway in B.C. is the Coquihalla, and it remains
&gt;&gt;in public hands, though maintenance on all provincial highways has been
&gt;&gt;contracted out for many years. The provincial government announced a few
&gt;&gt;years ago it would &quot;privatize&quot; the road and the contractor would collect
&gt;&gt;the tolls, etc. There was a public uproar, elected representatives in
&gt;&gt;the area were firmly told by their constituents that neither they nor
&gt;&gt;their party would ever get another vote if this went through, and the
&gt;&gt;government quickly retreated.

&gt;&gt;The Coquihalla remains a toll road, but only because the capital cost
&gt;&gt;plus interest hasn't been paid off yet. It's not private.

&gt;I misremembered the argument.  I thought that the Coq privatization
&gt;(really a long lease) had gone through, in a similar &quot;damn the
&gt;torpedos&quot; mood to that which sent BC Rail to CN.  (following which CN
&gt;got into the habit of dropping trains into rivers and lakes.  The
&gt;regional railway took maintenance more seriously than the megacorp.)
">

The Ontario government under Mike Harris built a toll highway and then
sell it off for a pittance.

What CN has done to BC Rail is a disgrace. And let's not get started
on recent experiences with BC Ferries, which was't really privatised
but hived off into a corporation that's not responsible to either
government or shareholders.
