Well they finally did it. They created a CGI movie that while watching
you forgot you were watching a cgi movie.

This movie was fantastic! The &quot;acting&quot; was great, the voices were good
and the animation was out-freaking-standing.

I'm not sure how accurate to the original story it is, since I haven't
read the story in a long time, but there got most of the pieces.

Man this movie was good. It is not for kids. Don't take a young person
to see this movie.
Enjoy.

Beowulf pulls it the money.
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21869861/

$28 million for the weekend.

This really was a good movie and for anyone who loves fantasy, this
medium and technique is the best way to bring those worlds and stories
to &quot;life&quot; and on the big screen.

Not having seen the movie yet, I was looking forward to the way they
did it until I saw that they made the CGI characters match the voice
actors looks....that is just crap!  I am looking forward to a time
when how you look no longer has bering on whether you are a respected
actor.  And I have great respect for voice actors...real ones.  Not
hollywood folks that they want to use the names of to sell a movie.

Mind you, plot-wise I have a feeling it is great, and I still intend
to see it.

I thought Polar Express was creepy as hell...can't watch it.  Uncanny
Valley...they were at the bottom of it.

Since the only person I recognize in the movie was Jolie and she was
only in it (as her image) for about five minutes I thought they did a
decent job.

It was some great animation. 8^)

I haven't seen it yet, but from the reviews I've read so far it
deviates from the original poem quite a bit.

Saw it in the 3d over the weekend...OMFG, that movie was amazing.
Beautiful movie, great action, cool plot, wonderful voice acting.  It
was great all the way around.

I will disagree HEAVILY with Sterling about not recognizing people.
Aside from Beowulf, I recognized everyone.  And Jolie...putting the
mole above her eye was just too much recognition.  I am sure the
studios told them to do it so it would still have star power.

If you can see it in 3D I highly recommend it!
