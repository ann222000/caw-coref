That is subject to discussion since there

lasting100,000± years. Only in the past
50 ± years has there been any realistc

The following is from the report of the Summer
2006 expedition. I expect they will not be home
before mid Sept.

*** German-American researchers
discovered more hydrothermal activity
at the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean
than anyone ever imagined. The Gakkel
ridge is a gigantic volcanic mountain
chain stretching beneath the Arctic Ocean.

With its deep valleys 5,500 meters beneath
the sea surface and its 5,000 meter- high
summits, Gakkel ridge is far mightier than
the Alps. Two research icebreakers, the
USCGC Healy from the United States and
the German PFS Polarstern, joined forces
in the international expedition AMORE
(Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge Expedition). In
attendance were scientists from the Max
Planck Institute for Chemistry and other
international institutions.

The scientists had expected that the Gakkel
ridge would exhibit &quot;anemic&quot; magmatism.
Instead, they found &quot;surprisingly strong
magmatic activity in the west and the east
of the ridge and one of the strongest
hydrothermal activities ever seen at mid-
ocean ridges.&quot; The Gakkel ridge extends
about 1,800 kilometers beneath the Arctic
Ocean from north of Greenland to Siberia,
and is the northern-most portion of the
mid-ocean ridge system.

To their surprise, the researchers found
high levels of volcanic activity. Indeed,
magmatism was &quot;dramatically&quot; higher than
expected.

Hydrothermal hot springs on the sea floor
were also far more abundant than predicted.
&quot;We expected this to be a hydrothermally
dead ridge, and almost every time our water
measurement instruments came up, they
showed evidence of hydrothermal activity,
and once we even 'saw' an active hot spring
on the sea floor,&quot; said Dr. Jonathan Snow,
the leader of the research group from the
Max Planck Institute.

Remember, that &quot;magmatism&quot; is red hot
magma seeping up from the ocean floor.
It's like putting a burner under a pot of
water.

NASA Revisions Create a Stir in The Blogosphere

By Marc Kaufman
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, August 15, 2007; A06

NASA has slightly revised its record of average annual temperatures in
the United States since 2000 -- modifications that researchers say are
insignificant but that some conservative commentators and bloggers
have seized upon to assert that global warming has been hyped as a
problem.

The revisions, which were first posted on the Web site of NASA's
Goddard Institute for Space Studies, stemmed from an error noticed by
Canadian blogger and global warming skeptic Stephen McIntyre. James
Hansen, director of the institute, said McIntyre brought the error to
the institute's attention, and the error was corrected.

Average annual temperatures are based on readings collected from many
different sites. To compare these readings over time, scientists
adjust them to take into account factors such as urbanization. Hansen
said the mistake occurred because NASA scientists thought some
readings they used in determining the average annual temperature after
the year 2000 had been adjusted, when they had not been.

Hansen said that the corrected figures show that the past six years
were 0.15 degrees centigrade cooler than reported. Hansen said that
the change is insignificant in terms of global warming and altered the
overall global mean temperatures by one-one-thousandth of a degree.

Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh used reports of the
revisions to argue that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by
scientists with liberal agendas.

&quot;We have proof of man-made global warming,&quot; Limbaugh said on his show
last Thursday. &quot;The man-made global warming is inside NASA. The man-
made global warming is in the scientific community with false data.&quot;

Hansen said that the critics were &quot;making a mountain of a molehill.&quot;

&quot;The change does nothing to our understanding of how the global
climate is changing and is being used by critics to muddy the debate,&quot;
he said.

Hansen said that NASA generally does not release or discuss national
weather statistics because it is more concerned with global patterns.
The agency that pays more attention to American temperature trends is
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has said
that most of the warmest years in the past century have been in the
past 12 years.

Hansen said the revised data do nothing to change that overall trend.

Climate researchers have long known that the mid- and late 1930s were
quite warm and that 1934 may have been the hottest year of the century
-- although average temperatures in 1998 were statistically just as
high. The revised data do not affect the debate over which of those
years was warmer.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported earlier this
year that global warming is definitely occurring and that greenhouse
gases created by humans are the most likely cause.

Peruse last weeks issues of NATURE and SCIENCE. Seems
that atmospheric &quot;brown haze&quot; has suddenly been
identified as the primary culprit in the accelerating
melting of Himalayan glaciers - not CO2 levels. The haze
traps heat, a &quot;greenhouse layer&quot; rather than a global
issue. The haze itself ... apparently dust, smoke and
industrial pollution mostly from India that gets trapped
in a stagnant air circulation pattern during the summer.
In short, the &quot;LA smog&quot; situation on a vastly larger scale.

There may indeed be some GW ... but it ain't what the
hype-artists are trying to sell us.

Conservatives screw up global warming story (again)
Posted August 15th, 2007 at 4:00 pm
Share This | Spotlight | Permalink

Any post that begins, &quot;Far-right blogs were all atwitter the other
day...&quot; is bound to end up making conservatives look pretty bad. This is
another one of those posts. This time, the topic is global warming.

The WaPo noted the bones of the &quot;controversy&quot; today.

NASA has slightly revised its record of average annual temperatures in
the United States since 2000 - modifications that researchers say are
insignificant but that some conservative commentators and bloggers
have seized upon to assert that global warming has been hyped as a
problem.

The revisions, which were first posted on the Web site of NASA's
Goddard Institute for Space Studies, stemmed from an error noticed by
Canadian blogger and global warming skeptic Stephen McIntyre. James
Hansen, director of the institute, said McIntyre brought the error to
the institute's attention, and the error was corrected.

Average annual temperatures are based on readings collected from many
different sites. To compare these readings over time, scientists
adjust them to take into account factors such as urbanization. Hansen
said the mistake occurred because NASA scientists thought some
readings they used in determining the average annual temperature after
the year 2000 had been adjusted, when they had not been.

So, no big deal right? A computer glitch altered the overall global
mean temperatures by one-one-thousandth of a degree. An amateur
noticed the problem, NASA corrected it, and the agency gave the person
who noticed full credit for the catch. The trends remain the same, and
scientists' understanding of climate change is entirely unaffected.

At which point conservative global-warming deniers praised scientists
for making the minor correction and went about their business. No, I'm
just kidding - after the minor data correction, the right threw a
hissy fit and argued that this is proof that global warming is bogus.

Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh used reports of the
revisions to argue that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by
scientists with liberal agendas.

&quot;We have proof of man-made global warming,&quot; Limbaugh said on his show
last Thursday. &quot;The man-made global warming is inside NASA. The man-
made global warming is in the scientific community with false data.&quot;

Limbaugh's clownery is actually mild compared to the reaction
generated by several conservative blogs, which collectively lost their
minds. One accused NASA of perpetrating a &quot;deliberate fraud.&quot; Several
others called for Hansen to be fired from his position. Fox News -
surprise, surprise - got in on the fun.

Brad Plumer summarized nicely just how foolish the right's reaction to
this meaningless story really is.

1998 went from being listed as 0.01 degrees warmer than 1934 to being
listed as 0.02 degrees cooler. That means 1934 is back to being the
&quot;official&quot; hottest U.S. year on record, although it's still a
statistical tie. Some of the other U.S. years in this decade were also
downgraded slightly. This all had virtually no bearing on the global
temperature record, in which 2005 is still the hottest year and Al
Gore's claim that nine of the ten hottest years in history have
occurred since 1995 is still operative. [...]

Nothing's really changed. All told, it's a tempest that deserves a
very tiny teapot.

I often wonder if conservatives ever get tired of being this wrong,
this often. I suspect it must be demoralizing after a while.

No surprise.
Conservatives are mostly simple minded buffoons bereft of any nominal
capacity to think critically.  Hence, they are easily mislead by loudmouth
crackpot drug addicts like Limbaugh.

&gt;&gt; &gt; NASA has slightly revised its record of average annual temperatures in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the United States since 2000 -- modifications that researchers say are
&gt;&gt; &gt; insignificant but that some conservative commentators and bloggers
&gt;&gt; &gt; have seized upon to assert that global warming has been hyped as a
&gt;&gt; &gt; problem.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The revisions, which were first posted on the Web site of NASA's
&gt;&gt; &gt; Goddard Institute for Space Studies, stemmed from an error noticed by
&gt;&gt; &gt; Canadian blogger and global warming skeptic Stephen McIntyre. James
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hansen, director of the institute, said McIntyre brought the error to
&gt;&gt; &gt; the institute's attention, and the error was corrected.

&gt;&gt;      Global warming in this century is merely an hyped-up myth

&gt; Conservatives screw up global warming story (again)

So, you quote a stupid commie blog?!

Pretty funny. Fact is, NASA lied.  1934 was the hottest year on record,
not 1998. Yes, the difference is by a trivial three hundredths of a
degree, but they lied about that difference to hype the anthropogenic
global warming lie.

Yes, it is a trivial difference, but it was a trivial difference they
played up for propaganda purposes from the start.

Now they don't have that &quot;warmest on record&quot; bullshit to play.

There are three types of people that you can_not_talk
into behaving well. The stupid, the religious fanatic,
and the evil.

1- The stupid aren't smart enough to follow the logic
of what you say. You have to tell them what is right in
very simple terms. If they don't agree, then you'll
never be able to change their mind.

2- the religious fanatic
If what you say goes against their religious belief,
they will cling to that religious belief even if it
means their death.&quot;

3- There is no way to reform evil-
Not in a million years
There is no way to convince the terrorists, serial
killers, pedophiles, and predators to change their evil
ways. They knew what they were doing was wrong, but
that knowledge didn't stop them. It only made them more
careful in how they went about performing their evil
acts.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; NASA Revisions Create a Stir in The Blogosphere

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; By Marc Kaufman
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Washington Post Staff Writer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Wednesday, August 15, 2007

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; NASA has slightly revised its record of average annual temperatures in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the United States since 2000 -- modifications that researchers say are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; insignificant but that some conservative commentators and bloggers
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have seized upon to assert that global warming has been hyped as a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problem.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The revisions, which were first posted on the Web site of NASA's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Goddard Institute for Space Studies, stemmed from an error noticed by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Canadian blogger and global warming skeptic Stephen McIntyre. James
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hansen, director of the institute, said McIntyre brought the error to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the institute's attention, and the error was corrected.

&gt; &gt;&gt;      Global warming in this century is merely an hyped-up myth

&gt; So, you quote a stupid commie blog?!

&gt; Pretty funny. Fact is, NASA lied.  1934 was the hottest year on record,
&gt; not 1998. Yes, the difference is by a trivial three hundredths of a
&gt; degree, but they lied about that difference to hype the anthropogenic
&gt; global warming lie.
">

First, that's only for the lower 48 US states.  Globally, 1998 is
still warmer.  Secondly, NASA made an adjustment in 2001 but didn't go
back and correct the other years to take the adjustment into account.
Hardly NASA lying.

Now, if you want to see lying, read any of the denialist posts.

&quot;CO2 isn't a greenhouse gas.&quot;
&quot;There is no warming.&quot;
&quot;There is no evidence of warming.&quot;
&quot;Any effect of CO2 is minor compared to water.&quot;
&quot;It's just natural variation.&quot;
&quot;The sun is changing.&quot;
&quot;The earth is cooling.&quot;

The only one they haven't trotted out recently is &quot;Volcanoes produce
more CO2 than humans.&quot;

Don't you see?  Read &quot;American Thinker&quot;!

A website quoted often by that denizen of modern science, Rush Limbaugh.
http://www.americanthinker.com/2007/08/nasa_flacks_for_global_warming...

It's a big leftist conspiracy by NASA!  NASA is out to get us!

Damn Socialists!

The truth is:

&quot;NASA has since adjusted its numbers. They now show that 1998 is the U.S.'s
second-hottest year and that five of the 10 warmest years on record in the
U.S. date from before 1939. The worldwide numbers remain unchanged, with
1998 and 2005 tied as the hottest year on record.&quot;

And in another report (which I can't find at the moment), Stephen McIntyre
admitted that his finding was insignificant vis-a-vis global warming.
Stephen McIntyre was interviewed on Toronto's AM640 and said that the
deviation was of no significance at all.  I heard that one on the way to
work the other day.

It's hilarious how those who oppose the facts about Anthropogenic Global
Warming are ready to jump on the most insignificant deviation, while
promoting snake oil ideas like volcanoes and scientifically debunked
notions that the Sun is the cause.

It's about time that people realized that the scientists are behind this global
warming fraud.

With any luck, a God fearing Republican will be elected as the next President
and with God's will, our children will be taught about the evils of socialist
notions like not-for-profit health care, the socialist global warming conspiracy
and how Intelligent Design is the reason for our being here in the first place.

Not to forget that the Earth is a disk with a circumference of about 78225 miles
and a diameter of 24900 miles. The sun and moon are both disks about 32 miles in
diameter (though some sources say that the sun and moon are spheres) and are
about 3000 miles above the Earth, and the stars about 100 miles above the sun
and moon and how the Earth is accelerating upward at a rate of 9.8 m/s², thereby
simulating gravity. This upward momentum is caused by the &quot;Universal
Accelerator&quot;, our exact term to describe a force that originated at the Big Bang
and caused the Earth to speed upwards. Though many say that Gravity cannot exist
on a flat Earth since the disc shape would eventually collapse on itself.

Some say that other planetary bodies such as the moon and the sun have
gravitational pulls, causing the gravitational force a object to decrease as the
object increases in altitude. This also allow spacecraft to &quot;orbit&quot;. At some
point the Earth would exceed the speed of light. Therefore, our truth states
that the Earth started at a speed faster than the speed of light, therefore
eliminating the problem of approaching the speed of light.
The planetary bodies above the Earth revolve above it, thereby causing sunrise
and sunset to occur. As the sun moves farther away, it shrinks until it is no
longer able to be seen. The same phenomenon occurs with the stars to cause their
movement.

The fact is that  when a ship moves farther away, the chance of a wave being in
front of the ship relative to a viewer's perspective on shore. Therefore,
because the ship moves farther away and becomes smaller, a wave is able to
obscure a larger portion of the hull until the ship is no longer visible. Other
factors that also contribute to this effect is atmospheric distortion and human
eyesight.

Otherwise, global warming is a hoax put on by crazy people!

SCIENCE Magazine Waffles on Warming
By James Lewis | July 08, 2007

Scientists Will Caution That All Is Not Well In The Global Warming
Game.

The American scientific establishment is starting to take
baby steps away from taking sides in the politics of global
warming. It's sad to have to read science articles for
political spin, like some announcement by the Kremlin.
But climate change has now become so politicized that
SCIENCE magazine reflects at least as much politics as
honest science. You_have_to_read_it_for_spin.

SCIENCE magazine is the flagship journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science,
which is the professional advocacy group for scientists in
the United States. SCIENCE is both the profession's
political journal (telling readers how to get government
grants, for example), and it also has original findings. So
it has an openly political side, as well as a real science
side.

The last issue of SCIENCE is waffling like mad on
the global warming fad, warning its readers that it
may not be so settled a question.

Under the headline &quot;Another Global Warming Icon
Comes Under Attack,&quot; SCIENCE writer Richard Kerr
writes:

www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/317/5834/28a

&quot;...a group of mainstream atmospheric scientists is
disputing a rising icon of global warming, and
researchers are giving some ground.&quot; ...

&quot;Robert Charlson of the University of Washington,
Seattle, (is) one of three authors of a commentary
published online last week in Nature Reports: Climate
Change. ... he and his co-authors argue that the
simulation by 14 different climate models of the
warming in the 20th century is not the reassuring
success IPCC claims it to be.&quot;

(IPCC is the supposed international scientific consensus
document on global warming - JL).

&quot;... In the run-up to the IPCC climate science report
released last February ... 14 groups ran their models
under 20th-century conditions of rising greenhouse
gases. ... But the group of three atmospheric scientists
... says the close match between models and the
actual warming is deceptive. The match &quot;conveys a lot
more confidence [in the models] than can be
supported in actuality,&quot; says Schwartz. [....]

&quot;Greenhouse gas changes are well known, they note,
but not so the counteracting cooling of pollutant hazes,
called aerosols. Aerosols cool the planet by reflecting
away sunlight and increasing the reflectivity of clouds.
Somehow, the three researchers say, modelers failed
to draw on all the uncertainty inherent in aerosols so
that the 20th-century simulations look more certain
than they should.&quot;

What? &quot;Somehow&quot; they missed the biggest unknown
factor in climate prediction?

Ssssuuuuurre they did!

Highly qualified climate scientists have long warned that
warming estimates have at least one giant question mark:
Water vapor and other tiny particles in the atmosphere.
By failing to include reliable estimates of such &quot;hazes&quot;
(not necessarily pollutants, as the article says), global
warming models are likely to err wildly on the side of
warming. It's the unseen elephant in the living room.

The SCIENCE article therefore finally admits what
scientific critics have been saying for years.

Interested readers should also take a good look at the
graph in the SCIENCE article, which superficially seems
to support the global warming story. But notice the vertical
bars at the right side of the graph, which show the &quot;90
percent confidence interval&quot; --- the chances that the graph
line is actually where it is shown to be. Turns out that the
orange confidence interval includes all the points on the
graph between 1930 and 2000... meaning that we can't
tell that any of those points are different from each other
with even 90 percent certainty. And that's not even
including the big Black Hole of water vapor.

Now &quot;90 percent confidence&quot; might sound like a lot. But in
standard scientific publications a 95 percent confidence
level is the minimum acceptable level. The reason is that
one can just run a study 10 times, and achieve a 90
percent confidence level purely by chance. So we
normally demand a higher standard of proof --- at least 95
percent confidence. The data in the SCIENCE graph
therefore does not meet routine scientific standards.

Many scientists will read this item as a red flag,
cautioning that all is not well in the global warming game.

Happy Earth Day - and never forget that telling the truth
is the first, indispensible step toward wise management
of our resources.

&gt; warming. It's the unseen elephant in the living room.

&gt; The SCIENCE article therefore finally admits what
&gt; scientific critics have been saying for years.

&gt; Interested readers should also take a good look at the
&gt; graph in the SCIENCE article, which superficially seems
&gt; to support the global warming story. But notice the vertical
&gt; bars at the right side of the graph, which show the &quot;90
&gt; percent confidence interval&quot; --- the chances that the graph
&gt; line is actually where it is shown to be. Turns out that the
&gt; orange confidence interval includes all the points on the
&gt; graph between 1930 and 2000... meaning that we can't
&gt; tell that any of those points are different from each other
&gt; with even 90 percent certainty. And that's not even
&gt; including the big Black Hole of water vapor.

&gt; Now &quot;90 percent confidence&quot; might sound like a lot. But in
&gt; standard scientific publications a 95 percent confidence
&gt; level is the minimum acceptable level. The reason is that
&gt; one can just run a study 10 times, and achieve a 90
&gt; percent confidence level purely by chance. So we
&gt; normally demand a higher standard of proof --- at least 95
&gt; percent confidence. The data in the SCIENCE graph
&gt; therefore does not meet routine scientific standards.

&gt; Many scientists will read this item as a red flag,
&gt; cautioning that all is not well in the global warming game.

&gt; Happy Earth Day - and never forget that telling the truth
&gt; is the first, indispensible step toward wise management
&gt; of our resources.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; NASA has slightly revised its record of average annual temperatures in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the United States since 2000 -- modifications that researchers say are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; insignificant but that some conservative commentators and bloggers
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have seized upon to assert that global warming has been hyped as a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The revisions, which were first posted on the Web site of NASA's

&gt; &gt; So, you quote a stupid commie blog?!

&gt; &gt; Pretty funny. Fact is, NASA lied.  1934 was the hottest year on record,
&gt; &gt; not 1998. Yes, the difference is by a trivial three hundredths of a
&gt; &gt; degree, but they lied about that difference to hype the anthropogenic
&gt; &gt; global warming lie.

&gt; First, that's only for the lower 48 US states.  Globally, 1998 is
&gt; still warmer.  Secondly, NASA made an adjustment in 2001 but didn't go
&gt; back and correct the other years to take the adjustment into account.
&gt; Hardly NASA lying.

&gt; Now, if you want to see lying, read any of the denialist posts.

&gt; &quot;CO2 isn't a greenhouse gas.&quot;
&gt; &quot;There is no warming.&quot;
&gt; &quot;There is no evidence of warming.&quot;
&gt; &quot;Any effect of CO2 is minor compared to water.&quot;
&gt; &quot;It's just natural variation.&quot;
&gt; &quot;The sun is changing.&quot;
&gt; &quot;The earth is cooling.&quot;

&gt; The only one they haven't trotted out recently is &quot;Volcanoes produce
&gt; more CO2 than humans.&quot;

&gt;&gt; It's a big leftist conspiracy by NASA!  NASA is out to get us!

&gt;&gt; Damn Socialists!

&gt; It's about time that people realized that the scientists are behind this
&gt; global warming fraud.

&gt; With any luck, a God fearing Republican will be elected as the next
&gt; President and with God's will, our children will be taught about the evils
&gt; of socialist notions like not-for-profit health care, the socialist global
&gt; warming conspiracy and how Intelligent Design is the reason for our being
&gt; here in the first place.

&gt; Not to forget that the Earth is a disk with a circumference of about 78225
&gt; miles and a diameter of 24900 miles. The sun and moon are both disks about
&gt; 32 miles in diameter (though some sources say that the sun and moon are
&gt; spheres) and are about 3000 miles above the Earth, and the stars about 100
&gt; miles above the sun and moon and how the Earth is accelerating upward at a
&gt; rate of 9.8 m/s², thereby simulating gravity. This upward momentum is
&gt; caused by the &quot;Universal Accelerator&quot;, our exact term to describe a force
&gt; that originated at the Big Bang and caused the Earth to speed upwards.
&gt; Though many say that Gravity cannot exist on a flat Earth since the disc
&gt; shape would eventually collapse on itself.

&gt; Some say that other planetary bodies such as the moon and the sun have
&gt; gravitational pulls, causing the gravitational force a object to decrease
&gt; as the object increases in altitude. This also allow spacecraft to
&gt; &quot;orbit&quot;. At some point the Earth would exceed the speed of light.
&gt; Therefore, our truth states that the Earth started at a speed faster than
&gt; the speed of light, therefore eliminating the problem of approaching the
&gt; speed of light.
&gt; The planetary bodies above the Earth revolve above it, thereby causing
&gt; sunrise and sunset to occur. As the sun moves farther away, it shrinks
&gt; until it is no longer able to be seen. The same phenomenon occurs with the
&gt; stars to cause their movement.

&gt; The fact is that  when a ship moves farther away, the chance of a wave
&gt; being in front of the ship relative to a viewer's perspective on shore.
&gt; Therefore, because the ship moves farther away and becomes smaller, a wave
&gt; is able to obscure a larger portion of the hull until the ship is no
&gt; longer visible. Other factors that also contribute to this effect is
&gt; atmospheric distortion and human eyesight.

&gt; Otherwise, global warming is a hoax put on by crazy people!

A real scientist is one who lets conservative doctrine influence his

A real scientist does not believe in Al Gore's lefty socialist global

&gt; &gt; Back in the &quot;ozone hole&quot; days when I would go to beach, I brought

&gt; &gt; time I left for the day people were clamoring to use my helped-along
&gt; &gt; ozone hole - it knocked my tanning time down from 3 hours per week to
&gt; &gt; about a 1/2 an hour!

&gt; I found an article that pointed out that there was a great deal of concern
&gt; because the glaciers were melting. No big deal today, but this was in
&gt; 1934. It seems the glaciers made a come back in time to melt again and set
&gt; the chickens off on &quot;the sky is falling!&quot; panic.

&gt; This time, they are using it to fear monger for money.

&gt; These warming and cooling trends happen in cycles. It turns out that
&gt; global warming already stopped. These scam artist just want to get the US
&gt; to do SOMETHING so they can claim that some small action created the
&gt; coming cooling trend. If the trend stops without some action, then they
&gt; will have to admit the cooling trend is natural.

&gt; They're frauds.

Indeed they are!!!

As for that dreaded greenhouse gas, CO2,
atmospheric levels of which now exceed 400
parts per million (ppm), it is important to note that
paleological records show that every time CO2
levels have exceeded 300 ppm there has been
an ice age. Every time - without exception.

Befuddled Gore keeps blathering about
how the oceans are being heated by
global warming, instead of the warming
being created by the oceans, as the facts
clearly show

&gt; That's right, we are no warmer now than we were almost three quarters of

So far neither IPCC nor anyone else has provided       one iota
of valid data for global warming nor have       they provided data
that climate change is being       effected by commerce and industry
and not by       natural phenomena.

What a shame that the title of the article is so completely disconnected
from the article content.  o waffling was mentioned in the article.  In
fact, no variace was shown in te article at all.

&gt; Scientists Will Caution That All Is Not Well In The Global Warming
&gt; Game.

&gt; The American scientific establishment is starting to take
&gt; baby steps away from taking sides in the politics of global
&gt; warming. It's sad to have to read science articles for
&gt; political spin, like some announcement by the Kremlin.
&gt; But climate change has now become so politicized that
&gt; SCIENCE magazine reflects at least as much politics as
&gt; honest science. You_have_to_read_it_for_spin.

&gt; SCIENCE magazine is the flagship journal of the
&gt; American Association for the Advancement of Science,
&gt; which is the professional advocacy group for scientists in
&gt; the United States. SCIENCE is both the profession's
&gt; political journal (telling readers how to get government
&gt; grants, for example), and it also has original findings. So
&gt; it has an openly political side, as well as a real science
&gt; side.

&gt; The last issue of SCIENCE is waffling like mad on
&gt; the global warming fad, warning its readers that it
&gt; may not be so settled a question.

&gt; Under the headline &quot;Another Global Warming Icon
&gt; Comes Under Attack,&quot; SCIENCE writer Richard Kerr
&gt; writes:

&gt; www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/317/5834/28a

&gt;     &quot;...a group of mainstream atmospheric scientists is
&gt;     disputing a rising icon of global warming, and
&gt;     researchers are giving some ground.&quot; ...

&gt;     &quot;Robert Charlson of the University of Washington,
&gt;     Seattle, (is) one of three authors of a commentary
&gt;     published online last week in Nature Reports: Climate
&gt;     Change. ... he and his co-authors argue that the
&gt;     simulation by 14 different climate models of the
&gt;     warming in the 20th century is not the reassuring
&gt;     success IPCC claims it to be.&quot;

&gt; (IPCC is the supposed international scientific consensus
&gt; document on global warming - JL).

&gt;     &quot;... In the run-up to the IPCC climate science report
&gt;     released last February ... 14 groups ran their models
&gt;     under 20th-century conditions of rising greenhouse
&gt;     gases. ... But the group of three atmospheric scientists
&gt;     ... says the close match between models and the
&gt;     actual warming is deceptive. The match &quot;conveys a lot
&gt;     more confidence [in the models] than can be
&gt;     supported in actuality,&quot; says Schwartz. [....]

&gt;     &quot;Greenhouse gas changes are well known, they note,
&gt;     but not so the counteracting cooling of pollutant hazes,
&gt;     called aerosols. Aerosols cool the planet by reflecting
&gt;     away sunlight and increasing the reflectivity of clouds.
&gt;     Somehow, the three researchers say, modelers failed
&gt;     to draw on all the uncertainty inherent in aerosols so
&gt;     that the 20th-century simulations look more certain
&gt;     than they should.&quot;

&gt; What? &quot;Somehow&quot; they missed the biggest unknown
&gt; factor in climate prediction?

&gt;     Ssssuuuuurre they did!

&gt; Highly qualified climate scientists have long warned that
&gt; warming estimates have at least one giant question mark:
&gt; Water vapor and other tiny particles in the atmosphere.
&gt; By failing to include reliable estimates of such &quot;hazes&quot;
&gt; (not necessarily pollutants, as the article says), global
&gt; warming models are likely to err wildly on the side of
&gt; warming. It's the unseen elephant in the living room.

&gt; The SCIENCE article therefore finally admits what
&gt; scientific critics have been saying for years.

&gt; Interested readers should also take a good look at the
&gt; graph in the SCIENCE article, which superficially seems
&gt; to support the global warming story. But notice the vertical
&gt; bars at the right side of the graph, which show the &quot;90
&gt; percent confidence interval&quot; --- the chances that the graph
&gt; line is actually where it is shown to be. Turns out that the
&gt; orange confidence interval includes all the points on the
&gt; graph between 1930 and 2000... meaning that we can't
&gt; tell that any of those points are different from each other
&gt; with even 90 percent certainty. And that's not even
&gt; including the big Black Hole of water vapor.

&gt; Now &quot;90 percent confidence&quot; might sound like a lot. But in
&gt; standard scientific publications a 95 percent confidence
&gt; level is the minimum acceptable level. The reason is that
&gt; one can just run a study 10 times, and achieve a 90
&gt; percent confidence level purely by chance. So we
&gt; normally demand a higher standard of proof --- at least 95
&gt; percent confidence. The data in the SCIENCE graph
&gt; therefore does not meet routine scientific standards.

&gt; Many scientists will read this item as a red flag,
&gt; cautioning that all is not well in the global warming game.

&gt; Happy Earth Day - and never forget that telling the truth
&gt; is the first, indispensible step toward wise management
&gt; of our resources.
