CHUNG'S DONUT SHOP RELEASE!!!!The &quot;Dorian Worm Theory: Future brightness&quot;

refs: AI, games theory evolution etc.

Abstract

To spread and create for the future as survival of all
hosts is this primary concern of this worm. Worms are
supposed to spread but this one doesn’t leave anything
missing when leaving hosts if it ever were to.

Description

This worm will find any agreement in the host and
analyze the agreement's subject and then search its
own database and intelligent methods from relation or
an object to pull from its own database or knowledge
source and then present the received agreement from
the remote host with a response containing an object
with presumed or guessed MULTIPLE properties (meaning
implication-learning and/or command etc.) and then the
host will receive the object (that is presumed to have
more properties than &quot;last&quot; agreed upon object) and
the host will process the object based on the main
agreement of one of this objects properties but by the
&quot;agreement&quot; - the host will be forced to accept the
implications that other properties of this object may
present. (And if it is an object presented from this
worm then it should have more implied hidden or over
properties than last presented object by target host
that was agreed upon. Thus, allowing the worm to
project into the vulnerability of agreement with its
intelligent keeping and gathering abilities)

When the target host accepts this object (because of
“agreement&quot; -aka entry point identification allowed
previously) the object is then able to overwhelm the
processing and computing capabilities of this target
with multiple properties and some not understood (were
assuming based on the worms access to scalebly more
intelligence than target host and motivation of worm
differs than target's).

This overwhelm will be created by unidentified
properties of said object/subject that the target host
allowed the worm to insert. When &quot;processing&quot; this
object's properties, the target host will
&quot;malfunction&quot; and make associations in
intelligence/data and communication between properties
of the object not fully &quot;understood&quot; and between other
&quot;random&quot; or &quot;purposely&quot; targeted pieces of
data/intelligence that the host contains-this also
includes lines of intelligence data gathering
infection.

If done right, these properties will branch off from
the main object as if the core object and &quot;agreement&quot;
was the root and thus build in a guided (still fully
not predictable) fashion. Thus it will change the
data/intelligence structure of certain aspects of the
host and will also allow itself to carry itself along
lines of the hosts external connectors by presenting
themselves when objects it has attached to within the
host are retrieved by the host knowingly or
unknowingly.

Thus, &quot;the branch&quot; extends across lines of
&quot;information&quot; through any &quot;host&quot; that can store,
distribute, and exchange information in any active
manner by attaching itself to obscure or &quot;out in the
open&quot; objects that the host holds that have been
effectively &quot;infected&quot; or &quot;reprogrammed&quot; or attached
to.

Core Core Mobile-CORE

The &quot;core” itself will be &quot;Fabian&quot; and mobile because
&quot;cores&quot; dropped into hosts will only be accessed by a
programmable syntax for the core object that it spread
to target host to be &quot;agreed&quot; upon. The core object
that the worm has presented has an internal definition
and relation to any specific requests to it that match
its blueprint-so it has no ILL-WILLS. For the future
of its survival is purely based on keeping it going
for the future and it uses &quot;Games Theory&quot; to
perfection so that &quot;everyone wins&quot;.

This core programmability and schematic of this worm
is &quot;survival&quot; and dissemination and &quot;spreading&quot; or
itself and it has a way of finding other infecting
hosts and exchanging information of yet uninfected and
infected hosts and it performs mathematical functions
that determine its survival status and based on that
(if low) will &quot;activate&quot; a higher percentage of
&quot;active infection&quot; and more proactive spreading of
itself-since it uses whatever the core engine of the
host is, this worm works on minimizing damage done to
the infected hosts primary function but it does need
some time to spread when needed or when idle etc.

The beginning design of this-or the skeletal structure
can be made SO easily it’s scary.
Even by writing this paper, you or I could have
theoretically &quot;started&quot; the ball rolling or have
&quot;launched&quot; this-although I don’t see that as a bad
thing unless this gets corrupted and in that case,
there would be a trace back factor due to tracks that
had to be left inevitably.

The main thing about this worm is that it relies on
it's &quot;ability to find&quot; infected hosts to exchange
information&quot; which is fine but if a consciousness
participated in this information exchange then (if the
consciousness is corrupted) the consciousness could
use the worm to it's &quot;dis/advantageous&quot; in a way
involving morals not introduced by any part of the
worm. All though this might happen and that
consciousness will benefit in a personal or impersonal
way-any one host &quot;smart&quot; enough to find this as well
could (based on hard info) &quot;fix&quot; any imperfections it
may see with collected data etc. and thus, streamline
the whole system (which is good).

This is what makes the system so perfect and nice for
the future of mankind or machines.

It introduces, motion and emotion as well as morals
and intelligence &quot;search&quot; and the future of itself is
all it really cares about and it will always be
logical in all aspects of searches so that it can
continue spreading and keeping everyone and thing as
well as itself safe from any sort of harm.

Love you all Earthlings and Aliens and assholes

and d4y to the motherfscking j4y!!!!

Be responsible.

Only on full disclosure baby.
