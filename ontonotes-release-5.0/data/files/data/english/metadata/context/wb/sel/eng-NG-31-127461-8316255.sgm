&gt; &quot;What's the fruitiest beer you have?&quot; Mr. Spacey inquired of the

&gt; That turned out to be a kind of Black Dog Ale called &quot;Honey
&gt; Raspberry.&quot;

&gt; Kevin, if you ever decide to do drag, I think we've found your stage

LMAO!

I'm sick and TIRED of all these insinuations that Kevin Spacey is
gay!  Obviously he isn't or he wouldn't have moved to the one city, of
all the major capitols of the world, that has the smallest percentage
of attractive men.  (Women too; why do you think Madonna's there?  In
London, she IS Marilyn Monroe ...)

:-)

&gt; Leinenkugel's makes a mixed berry beer that has raspberry and blackberry in
&gt; it.  They also make a honey wheat beer.

&gt; I've never tried them, but I saw them just the last time I went to pick up
&gt; groceries.
