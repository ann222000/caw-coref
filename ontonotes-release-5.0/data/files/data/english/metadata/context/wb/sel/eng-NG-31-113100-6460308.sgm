I can't find this word in the online version of  the American Heritage
Dictionary, nor in the Mirriam-Webster.

I gather, from my battered old edition of the Shorter Oxford, that it must
refer to a thief or swindler, but I'm sure there are posters to AEU that can
give me further enlightenment.

Is it a Whitmanism, or does it predate him?

It seems to have originally refered to a Jewish person.

The Compact OED has (among other entries):

1765 C. Johnston _Chrysal_ (1794) "I hate them [the Inquisitors]
mortally ever since I saw them roast some poor Smouches at Lisbon
because they would not eat pork".

Later on, it seems to have taken on the swindler meaning.

"They would smouch provisions from the pantry whenever they got a
chance; or a brass thimble, or a cake of wax, or an emery bag, or a
paper of needles, or a silver spoon, or a dollar bill, or small
articles of clothing, or any other property of light value; and so far
were they from considering such reprisals sinful, that they would go
to church and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their
plunder in their pockets."

I know you intend nothing bad here, and you've done nothing bad.

But nonetheless, speaking as a Jew, I would appreciate it if, unless
it violates parallelism or otherwise grates in a sentence, posters
could use "Jew" instead of "Jewish person", and Jews instead of Jewish
people.

So many people have used Jew as something bad, something hateful, that
those people have given much of the Western world the impression that
Jew is a dirty word, and even people of good will have been avoiding
using it.  Even some Jews pick up this speech habit.

For example, I've seen or heard people say things like, "A Swede, a
Norwegian, and a Jewish person".   That's not the case in the sentence
I'm reacting to, but I didn't want to pass up this opportunity to
raise this subject.

I think that avoiding the word Jew when it fits the sentence, no
matter what is intended when doing so, gives subtle confirmation of
the opinion of the haters, that Jew is a dirty word.  The way to end
that seems to me to be to use the word as much as possible in places
where Jewish person could be used instead.

I'm not suggesting redoing the entire sentence, for example, redoing a
different phrase into "a Swedish person, a Norwegian person, and a
Jew".  That would violate parallelism and I would not recommend that.

If you doubt that my observation is accurate, just count.  People are
more willing to use Jews than Jew, but it is still uncommon compared
to "Jewish people".

I'm not claiming to speak for other Jews here, but when I have
discussed it with other Jews on quite a few occasions, no one has said
I was wrong.

Somewhat related is a post I read on Usenet where someone thought that
Yid was an insulting word (so, being a nice guy, he had avoided using
it).  I replied to him and said that it may be used as an insult by a
jackass, but the word was not insulting at all.  It is Yiddish for
Jew.

Context is always nice.
OED has "smoucher" from the verb "smouch" - to kiss, from the 16th Century.
We'd expect to see the "smooch" spelling these days. And under the "smooch"
spelling, OED has further meanings of the verb - to "sully or dirty" from
C17 but latterly (C19) U.S. and to "sneak, creep ... or prowl" from early
C20 as a variant on "mooch" or "mouch" which is used for loafing, stealing
and pilfering and even, in a slang usage dated to 1857:

5. intr. 'To sponge, to slink away and allow others to pay for your
entertainment' (Barrère &amp; Leland Dict. Slang).
1857 'Ducange Anglicus' Vulgar Tongue 13 Mouch, v., to go about sponging
on your friends.

And we all know Minnie the Moocher ...

If a person lives or works in a milieu in which the term "Jew" is
used in a derogatory sense by some people, that person may tend to
avoid the term because listeners might interpret it as insulting to
a Jew or Jews.

It can be a bit nerve-jangling for such a person to switch to using
"Jew" in a straightforward sense.

Some individuals might be concerned that the practice of using "Jew"
straightforwardly here might accidentally carry over into
circumstances in which it would perceived as being derogatory.

On the infrequent occasions in this ng[1] when it is relevant to
refer to someone as a Jew I will do just that. However, I will tend
to hesitate while I consider where I am before using the word.

I'm not arguing against your plea for the use of "Jew". I'm just
pointing out that it can be genuinely difficult for some
individuals.

[1] And in the other ng: alt.usage.english.

Or just the opposite, as in my case, where it was pointedly avoided.

Indeed. Unfortunately this is not always possible. Just occasionally
it be can relevant to a discussion.

As one who made my matzo balls two weeks ago, and today the tzimmes,
cause it's just better the next day, I see your point, but personally,
tend not to correct those who avoid the word Jew. If someone wants to be
hypersensitive to what might offend, I try to respect that sensitivity,
and if it's in person, it's easy enough to use the word myself to let
them know the usage is ok.
What I don't get it this - why do they float when I first make them, but
sink when served? (The matzo balls, of course)
