Was changing the sparkplugs and found oil in the cylinder!

So, on a long driver over the 4th of July weekend,
I noticed some hesitation in the car at lower speeds.
As the weekend progressed, it sounded like the car was
misfiring.

When I got back home on Monday, I pulled the spark plug
wires.  The second spark plug chamber (second
from the front) has a significant amount of engine oil in it
(guess this could have caused the misfire, eh? :)

Anyway, there was also a silicone type substance along the
top portion of the cylinder.  This leads me to believe that
a seal between the engine block and the head cover has given
way (my brother-in-law called this a "top side leak"?)

Question time:

1. How likely / common is this?
2. If it is that gasket, how do I replace it?  What is name
of the part that would need to be replaced?
3. Is this a likely cause of the misfiring and hesitation?

On a side note, I just bought this car not a month ago,
and as I go I'm finding all kinds of things that were covered
up.  Alot of the repairs done by the previous owner were done
in a very ghetto-ass style.  I hope this isn't indicative of
your average 944 owner (as opposed to the fine people who lurk
in this newsgroup ;)

At any rate, if I ever see the previous owner on the street, I'm
going to kick him in the nuts.  But that's for another day.....

I have had oil build up in spark plug cavity also and is due to reusing
plug washer.  You need to put new washers on when cleaing plugs and
torque them down to specs.  You could also have excess oil going into
combustion chamber from worn valve stem seals.  I have this problem on
my number one cylinder.
Other questions can be best answered by consulting shop manual at
www.clarks-garage.com .  I believe you are referring to the cam box to
head gasket leaking????  Previous owner probably used some silicone
rubber instead of purchasing a gasket.  Small job to replace.

">

----&gt; depends on how many miles you have on it, higher mileage cars are
prone to leaks,  it is not under any kind of pressure like a head gasket

2. If it is that gasket, how do I replace it?
----&gt;  you will need to remove the timing belt then unbolt the cam
tower, take care to not let the lifters fall out,  best left to a
mechanic unless you really knowabout 944's. couple of hundred bucks for
a shop to do it...

&lt;&gt;What is name of the part that would need to be replaced?
---&gt; Sounds like a leak on the Cam Tower,  has a gasket,

3. Is this a likely cause of the misfiring and hesitation?
----&gt; not really unless the spark plug boot is bad and causing shorting
(look at the running engine at noght with no lights, if the are wire
issues, you will see a really nice light show....

Just so I know we're talking the same thing: I'm talking about
the plate on the top left side of the engine block.  It says
"Porsche" on it (mine is red).

I'm guessing there is a gasket that seals the gap in the spark
plug cavity between the cam box and the engine block.  Is
it reasonable for this gasket to leak?

Also, it looks like the plate is held on by about 10 bolts.
Anything else to be aware of here?

Thanks!

Yes, you need to take the cam box off, clean the surfaces carefully and
put a new  gasket on.

You might get more help here if you identified the year and specific
model.

Orientation is typically from the drivers seated postion.  Cam box on
the right.

Buy a copy of the Haynes manual at your local book stockist.

Sorry.
The car is a 1990 944 cabriolet.
That is part of the problem, as the haynes clearly cuts off at 1989.
Much of it is correct, but I have noticed some glaring differences.

I found on a parts website a listing for "valve cover gasket set."
After looking into it further, it looks like this is what I need.

The haynes I have (as well as clark's garage) has no mention of
the torque settings for the cam box bolts.  Any idea where this can
be found?

Cya.
Scott.

33 ft/lbs.  The tappets need to go back in the same holes they come out
of.
Use grease, chord or wire to hold them in temporarily when
reassembling.
Put engine to TDC and slacken the cam belt.  Mark position with white
paint  on pulleys and belt.

I'm in the process of doing that.  I started taking the
bolts out.  Got all the way to the last one in the back
upper left-hand corner.  The $*#&amp;#^ is rounded out.

Let's see what a local tool place has for me tomorrow.  Hopefully
one of the local junkyards will have a recent 944 that I can take
a bolt from.

This is still lots of fun though :)

task

I had to cut one rounded bolt out, but other than that the replacement
looks to be a success.  I ran it for a little while today and there was
no oil in my no. 2 spark plug chamber.  There are a few places online
that should have quotes back to me tomorrow on replacement bolts.

It should be noted that in my case, I didn't have to go to TDC
or slacken the cam belt as it was only necessary to re-gasket
the valve cover.

BTW, thanks for your help over the past week Mr....uh...darthpup..
uh...sir.

If you have more than 30,000 miles on the cam timing belt would
recommend a replacement.  If it breaks you will have a little job to do
on the head replacing bent valves.
Your engine must have an autotensioner for cam belt?
