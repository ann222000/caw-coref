Leaked Media Defender e-mails reveal secret government
project&lt; http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070916-leaked-media-defender-e... &gt;

&lt; http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/mediadefender.ars &gt;Peer-to-peer
(P2P) poisoning company
MediaDefender&lt; http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/mediadefender.ars &gt;suffered
an embarrassing leak this weekend, when almost 700MB of internal
company e-mail was distributed on the Internet via BitTorrent. The e-mails
reveal many aspects of MediaDefender's elaborate P2P disruption strategies,
illuminate previously undisclosed details about the MiiVi scandal, and bring
to light details regarding MediaDefender's collaboration with the New York
Attorney General's office on a secret law enforcement project. We have been
reviewing the data for days and will have multiple reports on the topic.

MediaDefender specializes in file-sharing mitigation—practices that disrupt
and deter infringing uses of P2P file-sharing networks. Music labels and
movie studios pay the company millions of dollars to temporarily impede the
propagation of new releases in order to compel consumers to pursue
legitimate commercial distribution channels. MediaDefender accomplishes this
task by using its array of 2,000 servers and a 9GBps dedicated connection to
propagate fake files and launch denial of service attacks against
distributors.

The e-mail was leaked to the public by a group that calls itself
MediaDefender-Defenders. In a text file distributed with the mail, the group
explains how the e-mails were obtained and why they are being distributed.
Apparently, MediaDefender employee Jay Mairs forwarded all of his company
e-mails to a Gmail account, which was eventually infiltrated. &quot;By releasing
these e-mails we hope to secure the privacy and personal integrity of all
peer-to-peer users,&quot; writes the group behind the disclosure. &quot;So here it is;
we hope this is enough to create a viable defense to the tactics used by
these companies.&quot;

It's not surprising that MediaDefender was targeted in this manner. The
company was accused of using shady tactics earlier this year when BitTorrent
community site TorrentFreak
revealed&lt; http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-gang-launches-their-own-video-dow... &gt;that
the anti-piracy company was surreptitiously operating a video upload
service called MiiVi that offered high speed downloads of
copyright-protected content. Critics accused MediaDefender of using the site
to perpetrate an entrapment scheme, an allegation that the company has
vigorously denied. MediaDefender founder Randy Saaf personally assured
Ars&lt; http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070706-mediadefender-denies-en... &gt;that
MiiVi was an internal project that was never intended for public use.
Back in July when we covered the MiiVi scandal, we knew Saaf's story didn't
quite add up, and now the general public has evidence that blows holes in
Saaf's claims.

The MediaDefender e-mails leaked this
weekend&lt; http://torrentfreak.com/mediadefender-emails-leaked-070915/ &gt;confirm
beyond doubt that the company intentionally attempted to draw
traffic to MiiVi while obscuring its own affiliation with the site. The
e-mails also show that MediaDefender immediately began to recreate the site
under a different name and corporate identity soon after the original plan
was exposed.
The rise of MiiVi

Shortly after the public launch of MiiVi in June, developer Ben Grodsky
e-mailed Saaf and his colleagues to inform them that the site was beginning
to receive traffic. &quot;We have some success! 12 people have signed up on [the]
page. 7 have installed [the] app,&quot; wrote Grodsky. &quot;This is from about 3,000
uniques from limewire redirects.&quot; Grodksy sent another user count status
update a week later revealing that the site had drawn 19,000 unique visitors
from LimeWire redirects. He also informed Saaf that his team was &quot;working on
putting Google Analytics all over MiiVi&quot; in order to &quot;better track what
people are doing on the site.&quot;

MediaDefender went to great lengths to obscure its affiliation with MiiVi.
&quot;I don't want MediaDefender anywhere in your e-mail replies to people
contacting Miivi,&quot; Saaf instructed company employees. &quot;Make sure
MediaDefender can not be seen in any of the hidden email data crap that
smart people can look in.&quot; Grodsky and Saaf also began discussing new ways
to drive traffic to the MiiVi site. &quot;If we want more users, Dylan's eDonkey
messages would get us a lot of Europeans that are a little bit older crowd,&quot;
Grodsky wrote. &quot;I would like it if our pictures were indexed with goggle
[sic]. We need to get as much search traffic as we can,&quot; Saaf replied.

Developer Dylan Douglas also suggested some Google ranking improvement
strategies. &quot;We should come up with a bunch of keywords and a description
for the hidden metadata entries to increase traffic,&quot; Douglas told the MiiVi
developers.

In late June, Grodsky began considering ways to leverage the MiiVi client
application infrastructure. &quot;Do you think it would break a lot and take more
time than its [sic] worth for the MiiVi application/installer also to act
like Serge's Proxy client and spoof on eMule?&quot; Grodsky asked Saaf. &quot;We don't
want to do this at this time,&quot; Saaf replied. &quot;Good idea, but we don't want
to give it a spyware stigma.&quot;
The disclosure

Chaos ensued at the company when TorrentFreak disclosed MediaDefender's
affiliation with MiiVi in early July. &quot;Looks like the domain transfer
screwed us over,&quot; Grodsky wrote in an e-mail which also contained a link to
TorrentFreak's article. &quot;What needs to happen?! Do you want the server
pulled?&quot; he asked Saaf. &quot;This is really fucked,&quot; Saaf replied. &quot;Let's pull
miivi offline.&quot; Shortly after the server was shut down completely, Grodsky
sent a follow-up e-mail noting that the story was beginning to spread. He
dutifully requested &quot;damage control&quot; instructions from Saaf and discontinued
the LimeWire redirect campaign.

MediaDefender's damage control program went into full swing shortly after
that. When Douglas pointed out that information about MiiVi had been added
to the MediaDefender Wikipedia page, Saaf decided that he wanted it taken
down. &quot;Can you please do what you can to eliminate the entry? Let me know if
you have any success,&quot; Saaf wrote. &quot;I will attempt to get all references to
miivi removed from wiki,&quot; developer Ben Ebert replied. &quot;We'll see if I can
get rid of it.&quot;

After a statement Saaf sent to Digital Daily was included in a blog
entry&lt; http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20070705/miivii-mediadefender/ &gt;,
Saaf sent an e-mail to a handful of MediaDefender employees asking if it
would be a good idea to post it to the Digg.com news site. He also suggested
possibly having MediaDefender employees post comments. Referring to the Digg
community, MediaDefender co-founder Octavio Herrera replied, &quot;They aren't
going to believe you.&quot;

MediaDefender developers also discussed ways to downplay the story or spin
it to dull the impact. &quot;If the major news outlets aren't interested in the
story, I would take that as an indication that the VAST majority of people
don't give a shit about this story,&quot; Mairs wrote. &quot;However, if they do think
it's worth writing about, we definitely want to get our side of the story in
the mainstream media, so I think Randy's plan of going to the big tech media
outlets is a good one. So far the story has only been on techie, geek web
sites where everybody already hates us. If the story stays on these sites,
we should let it die.&quot;

Saaf sent Mairs a private reply in response, expressing his personal opinion
about the media backlash surrounding the spyware allegations. &quot;Truth is I
don't give a crap about most of this shit,&quot; Saaf wrote.
The resurrection

Despite the serious failure of MiiVi, MediaDefender decided to try again.
&quot;Looks like we'll just have to take 2-3 weeks of downtime and do some
cosmetic work and relaunch,&quot; wrote MediaDefender employee Ty Heath in an
e-mail to the MiiVi development team. &quot;Plus creating another DBA (or better
yet incorporating under a new name), getting a new domain, getting another
Verisign certificate, getting a new IP range, etc.,&quot; Grosdky replied. In an
e-mail titled &quot;MiiVi redux,&quot; Grodsky asks Saaf if he wanted to &quot;do the
incorporating from scratch idea for the MiiVi replacement&quot; instead of the
doing-business-as arrangement used for MiiVi. &quot;If so,&quot; wrote Grodsky, &quot;I
have no idea what the turn-around is on creating a complete corporate entity
and we would need a name for the new corp.&quot;

Grodksy's first step was establishing a new mailing address using a mail
service in Las Vegas. &quot;I called the place ( www.maillinkplus.com ) and
verified the name(s) on the box and the name(s) that receive the mail can be
different from the name of the company that's paying by check. They also
e-mail nightly if there's mail and someone on their staff inputs the FROM
address on the envelope to a database that will show us when we login who we
got mail from and then we can pick to have those article [sic] forwarded to
us per item,&quot; wrote Grodsky. &quot;Worst case scenario paranoia craziness, does
anyone have objections with this mail box place being the foundation for all
the materials that would have to do with the to-be-named MiiVi?&quot;

One point that came up during MiiVi resurrection planning was the potential
value of the traffic generated by the negative publicity. &quot;We are leaning
toward dumping the URL and just re-launching with a new URL? Are we being
too hasty because you can't buy 1,000,000 pages linking to you in Google
returns.&quot; Michael Potts, who works for MediaDefender parent company
ARTISTDirect, suggested putting a link to the new site on a page at the
MiiVi domain so that the new site benefits from MiiVi's high Google rank.

After an extensive naming discussion, MediaDefender finally decided to bring
back MiiVi under the name Viide. In an e-mail to Potts, Grodsky wrote, &quot;When
you get a chance, we would love you to start taking a look at www.viide.com .
That is the current home of our MiiVi site. We have totally locked-down the
site, while we improve the look and feel from [what] the blogosphere saw.&quot;

The next step was purging Viide of all references to MiiVi before the
official launch. &quot;I'm not sure if you guys are planning on going live with
the Viide domain name... but in case you are... you might want to remove all
references of Miivi on the homepage of viide.com before it gets Googled or
someone public comes across it,&quot; wrote former MediaDefender developer Tabish
Hasan in an e-mail sent to the MiiVi development team. Development on Viide
was ongoing in the most recent e-mails included in the leaked collection.
Providing data for use by law enforcement agencies

In the collection of leaked e-mails, there are several discussions with
representatives of the New York Attorney General's office, including
intelligence analyst Bradley J. Bartram and senior special investigator
Michael G. McCartney. MediaDefender is in the process of devising a system
that will enable the Attorney General's office to remotely access
MediaDefender's data about P2P users. In an e-mail that McCartney sent to
Mairs last month, the investigator explained that the matter was &quot;being
overseen by the highest members of [the] agency&quot; and was considered somewhat
urgent.

Although the full scope of the project cannot be extrapolated from the
e-mails, the information available indicates that MediaDefender intends to
provide the Attorney General's office with information about users accessing
pornographic content. Other kinds of information could be involved as well.
The e-mails clearly indicate that the data provided by MediaDefender was
intended to be used for law enforcement purposes. In an e-mail to Mairs,
Bartram says that the system must be specifically designed &quot;to satisfy the
legal and evidentiary requirements&quot; before use.

&quot;On your end, the peer-to-peer crawler will be identifying files matching
the established search criteria from various hosts,&quot; wrote Bartram. &quot;This
data will then be collected, filtered for New York resident ip addresses (to
the accuracy limits imposed by geo-query tech). The data will then be
transferred to us where; on our end, a separate piece of software will use
that data to connect into the network and download the file from a host and
store it on our servers for evidence retention and further analysis.&quot;

It is not clear whether or not the project with the Attorney General's
Office has any connection with the MiiVi project. At this time, we have not
uncovered any substantial evidence to indicate that such a connection
exists.

Some evidence in the e-mails indicates that the system devised by
MediaDefender in collaboration with the Attorney General's Office was
targeted by a hacker. &quot;[A]n ip from, what appears to be sweden, connected to
the server using your username, made two failed password entries and then
disconnected 4 seconds after the initial connection,&quot; Bartram informed
MediaDefender. &quot;Considering the nature of the information being collected, I
would like to restrict access as much as possible.&quot; McCartney followed up
soon after with an e-mail to Grodsky and Mairs. &quot;Is this one of your
engineers? Because if not, this is very disturbing! Who ever [sic] this was
obviously had the non standard port as well as your user name to attempt
these logins,&quot; wrote McCartney. &quot;This leads me to believe that your system
is compromised and/or our communications were either sniffed or accessed
providing this fella with much of the relevant information to attempt
access. As of now, all out side [sic] access has been disabled until we can
figure this out further.&quot;

It is possible that the individual who attempted to infiltrate the server is
associated with the organization behind the MediaDefender e-mail leak.
McCartney's concerns represent the only instance in the MediaDefender
e-mails where anyone expresses suspicion that the messages are being
intercepted and obtained by a third party.
Universal Music Group contract

One of the most informative documents included in the leaked e-mails is a
draft of MediaDefender's confidential contract with Universal Music Group.
The contract reveals exact details of MediaDefender's pricing structure and
services and provides insight into which P2P networks the company is
targeting. MediaDefender charges $4,000 for one month of protection for an
album, and $2,000 for one month of protection for a track. Clients are also
given access to MediaDefender's reports and statistical analysis. In the
contract, the company claims that it &quot;will perform Services against
approximately twelve million&quot; file-sharing users at any given time and will
target the fifteen most popular P2P networks. Targeted networks include
FastTrack, Gnutella, IRC, Usenet, DirectConnect, eDonkey, MP2P, Kademlia,
Overnet, BitTorrent, SoulSeek, and Shareaza. The contract also provides
detailed explanations of MediaDefender's efficacy testing practices.
Other odds and ends

There is simply too much information in the MediaDefender e-mails for us to
cover in detail. We leave further analysis of the data as an exercise to the
reader. We did encounter, however, a few other things worthy of note. There
are detailed statistics that illuminate the efficacy of MediaDefender's
file-sharing mitigation tactics and an extensive discussion of new
techniques used by the company. The e-mails, unfortunately, also contain
some highly sensitive financial information, including a spreadsheet with
the salaries, Social Security numbers, and home addresses of individual
MediaDefender software developers. There are also e-mails that discuss
MediaDefender's competition intelligence activities, where they attempt to
discover file-sharing mitigation tactics used by competitors like
MediaSentry.

The e-mails contain information about the personal life of MediaDefender
employees as well. One particularly ironic example can be found in an e-mail
sent by Mairs, the MediaDefender employee whose technical ineptitude was
ultimately responsible for the leak. &quot;I was out of the office yesterday
because my son stuck something up his nose and I had to take him to urgent
care. I guess we know where he gets his smarts from ;)&quot; The NBC Universal
representative who received that e-mail replied sympathetically, &quot;Haha. I
hope it wasn't a crayon.&quot;
Conclusion

The cold war being waged between MediaDefender and P2P copyright infringers
is rife with mutual deception, but one fact shines through all of the layers
of obfuscation: MediaDefender consistently underestimates the ingenuity,
resourcefulness, and dedication of its adversaries. In this case, it could
cost the company everything.

Internet users are beginning to demand a higher level of transparency and
accountability from companies that operate within the Internet ecosystem.
Companies like MediaDefender that rely on secrecy and discretion
unintentionally invite scrutiny by attempting to hide.

Although many of MediaDefender's innermost secrets have been laid bare by
this leak, there are many aspects of the company that remain shrouded in
mystery. The ultimate purpose of the MiiVi site, for instance, is still an
enigma. In some ways, the information in these e-mails raises more questions
about MiiVi than it answers. It is likely that many additional details about
MediaDefender's operations will be disclosed to the public as new secrets
are uncovered in the e-mails. The rate at which these e-mails propagate
across the Internet may also stand as a testament to the difficulty of
trying to stand between consumers and their torrents.

Peer-to-peer poisoners: A tour of MediaDefender

By Nate Anderson &lt; http://arstechnica.com/authors.ars/Nate+Anderson &gt; |
Published: March 18, 2007 - 09:28PM CT
A war of attrition

When your company poisons peer-to-peer networks for a living, public
relations usually takes a back seat to discretion; quiet is the rule in the
P2P content-protection industry. That's why Jonathan Lee, the company's VP
of business development, isn't worried that the corporate web site is down
when I reach him in his Santa Monica office. &quot;It's kind of ugly anyway,&quot; he
says.

For a company like MediaDefender, the largest such firm in existence,
privacy comes naturally, but a 2005 acquisition by ARTISTDirect has
encouraged the firm to take its services public as it starts to look beyond
its original client base—music labels and movie studios—and dives headfirst
into the brave new world of providing legitimate P2P content for
advertisers.

Such advertising deals may be the future, but the company's bread and butter
continues to be P2P disruption of movies and music downloads. MediaDefender
is quite good at this, as it should be after five years of antipiracy work.
Unlike DRM providers that focus on protecting the product, MediaDefender
tries to protect the distribution channel—and only for a limited time.
Recognizing that it is impossible to shut down the sharing of copyrighted
works, the company focuses instead on mitigation. Record labels and movie
companies can pay between $5,000 and $15,000 per title for differing levels
of protection that extend over different time periods.

For most content owners, MediaDefender's services are needed at the
beginning of a product's life cycle. Lee points out that most movies and
albums makes the majority of their money in the first few months after
release. MediaDefender's value proposition is not that it can stop such
files from being shared, but that it can make sharing difficult for a month
or two in order to give the legitimate product more traction.

Is it live or is it MediaDefender?
How it works

To work its magic on the various P2P networks, Lee describes four strategies
that MediaDefender uses. All four are powered by a back end of 2,000 servers
co-located around the world, and the company has contracts for 9GBps of
Internet bandwidth. For a 60-person operation, these numbers are (to put it
mildly) a bit high, but the scale of its system usually ensures that the
company gets prompt attention and good deals when it goes shopping. It also
means that employees who stay late after work to game on the corporate LAN
always have a good connection.

Those 2,000 servers do four things that MediaDefender refers to as decoying,
spoofing, interdiction, and swarming. Here's how they work...
Four main methods

*Decoying*. This, in a nutshell, is the serving of fake files that are
generally empty or contain a trailer. The goal is to make legitimate content
a needle in a haystack, so MediaDefender works hard to ensure that its
copies of files show up in the top ten spots when certain keywords are
searched for. Everything about the file is tailored to look like the work of
pirates, from the file size (movies are often compressed enough to fit on a
CD) to the naming conventions to the pirate scene tag. With massive
bandwidth and plenty of servers, the company has little trouble in getting
these decoy files to appear at the top of search results, but decoying has a
down side: the bandwidth. Because MediaDefender actually serves these large
but bogus files, it incurs a significant bandwidth bill by using this
technique.

*Spoofing*. Spoofing sends searchers down dead ends. MediaDefender coders
have written their own software that interacts with the various P2P
protocols and sends bogus returns to search requests, usually directing
people to nonexistent locations. Because most people only look at the top
five search results, MediaDefender tries to frustrate their first attempts
to download a file in hopes that they will just give up.

*Interdiction*. While the first two techniques try to prevent searchers from
locating files, interdiction prevents distributors from serving them. The
tool is generally used when media is leaked or newly released; the goal is
to slow its spread in those crucial first days. MediaDefender servers
attempt to create constant connections to the files in question, saturating
the provider's upstream bandwidth and preventing anyone else from grabbing
the data.

*Swarming*. Though he acknowledges the BitTorrent networks can be hard to
disrupt, Lee points out that MediaDefender can use &quot;swarming&quot; to make life
more difficult for users trying to download copyrighted content. BitTorrent
works by using a hash file to reassemble a file from many pieces, each of
which may have been downloaded from a different user. MediaDefender simply
serves up its chunks of these files, but instead of providing the proper
data, its chunks contain static or nothing at all. BitTorrent will discard
such junk data, but a flood of it can slow a user's download to a crawl.

Does all of this really curtail P2P usage? Lee admits that the company will
never stop file-swapping, but says that isn't the point of what it does.
Instead, the goal is to make files hard to find for a short period of time
so that studios, music labels, and artists can make money from selling the
legitimate product. Companies that use MediaDefender's services will often
run their own download tests (or contract with one of the firms that does
this) to make sure that they are receiving a return on their investment.

Apparently, they are. MediaDefender counts every major music label and most
studios among its clients, with the notable exception of Disney. Lee says
that initially, his company expected to work largely with trade
organizations like the RIAA and the MPAA. When it actually approached them,
however, the trade groups were more focused on court cases and Congressional
lobbying. While they approve of MediaDefenders's work, the actual contracts
are signed directly with labels and studios, many of whom pay millions for
the company's services.
A brave new world: advertising

In recent months, MediaDefender has shifted some of its efforts in a new
direction: using its P2P technology and massive bandwidth to serve files,
rather than stop them. Last year, the company partnered with Jay-Z and Coke
in a widely-covered promotion that saw MediaDefender pushing a legitimate
piece of Jay-Z concert footage to fans who searched for videos by the
artist. In essence, these are &quot;decoys&quot; that contain real content.

The company has also helped promote Vitamin Water commercials that were
deemed too &quot;edgy&quot; for network television, along with video game trailers and
exclusive P2P remixes. The goal is to diversify—a necessary safeguard in an
industry that has few clients. There simply aren't that many major movie
studios and music labels, but there are millions of potential clients with
fat ad budgets who wouldn't mind reaching the millions of young, tech-savvy
people who make use of P2P networks.

Lee says that even music and movie companies have changed their stance in
the last few years, and while none condone illegal downloads, they have
realized that this is a huge potential market. This is especially true for
smaller indie labels, for whom exposure is sometimes more important than
legitimate sales. Some of these small firms have actually paid MediaDefender
to serve content by their acts, often in response to users searching for a
related (but better known) artist.

This mingling of licit and illicit content on P2P networks raises some
questions, of course. How are users to know in advance if content is legal
or not? Are some labels actually encouraging the use of such networks, even
as their trade groups prosecute those who use them? Does serving legitimate
content show confusion about what can and cannot be shared and downloaded?

This was, in fact, a major concern that the industry had. For years, content
owners refused to place any legal material on P2P networks for fear of
legitimizing them. That fear largely vanished in the wake of the Supreme
Court's Grokster
decision&lt; http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050627-5042.html &gt;.
Once it was well established that such networks could be held liable for
copyright infringement, content owners actually felt more free to make use
of the networks for legitimate uses of their own.

But antipiracy work still accounts for 99 percent of MediaDefender's
work—work that Lee knows is not popular in all circles. Last year, for
instance, the company began recruiting on college campuses for the first
time. Students would approach company reps and tell them that they hated
what they did. &quot;But five minutes later,&quot; says Lee, &quot;they came back and asked
us for a job.&quot; Hackers, he says, &quot;love screwing with each other,&quot; and
MediaDefender gives them an impressive platform and some serious bandwidth
to hack on. Besides, &quot;you can't get that mad&quot; about what the company does,
Lee says with a laugh. &quot;I mean, you're looking for pirated stuff!&quot;
Update:

Various forum posters and bloggers have commented on MediaDefender's
&quot;swarming&quot; claim in particular, arguing that BitTorrent's hash-based
technology prevents file disruption and that MediaDefender could simply not
disrupt the network. We contacted the company for clarification and were
told that the details of their BitTorrent work remain secret, but that the
company does indeed employ swarming on BitTorrent networks.

Because of the anti-corruption technology on such networks, MediaDefender
tries to stall downloads and make files frustrating to grab by serving bad
data. The file corruption discussed in the article should not have
referenced BitTorrent; such swarming causes corruption only on networks
without similar error-checking (the article text has been corrected).
MediaDefender's goal with BitTorrent is to slow down transfers. Making them
slow enough counts as a &quot;win&quot; for the company, though this does seem like a
hollow victory, as the consumer still has the correct file in the end.

MediaDefender denies entrapment accusations with fake torrent
site&lt; http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070706-mediadefender-denies-en... &gt;

By Jacqui Cheng &lt; http://arstechnica.com/authors.ars/eJacqui &gt; | Published:
July 06, 2007 - 12:54PM CT

Antipiracy agency
MediaDefender&lt; http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070706-mediadefender-denies-en... &gt;strongly
denies recent claims that it set up an entrapment scheme in order
to catch so-called pirates downloading illegal movies and software.

Earlier this week, the Motion Picture Association of America and antipiracy
agency MediaDefender were allegedly caught red-handed when Internet sleuths
traced a &quot;fake&quot; BitTorrent site back to the two groups. But MediaDefender
told Ars Technica that the story has been blown far out of proportion and
was started by sites like The Pirate Bay and TorrentFreak in order to slam
MediaDefender's organization and software.

The soap opera that the entire brouhaha revolves around started like this. A
web site called MiiVi &lt; http://miivi.com/ &gt; allegedly offered full-length
motion pictures for download and offered to install special client software
on the user's computer to help speed up the downloads. However, the software
did a little more than that: it also reportedly performed searches of the
user's computer for other illegal software and reported its findings back to
MediaDefender. Acting on a tip from The Pirate Bay, the online publication
ZeroPaid began an
&quot;investigation&lt; http://www.zeropaid.com/news/8877/Gotcha%21+New+MPAA+Site+Tries+to+Tr... &gt;&quot;
(a followup to Torrent Freak's
article&lt; http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-gang-launches-their-own-video-dow... &gt;)
and found that MediaDefender didn't make much of an effort to hide who was
behind MiiVi. The whois records for MiiVi were clearly registered to
MediaDefender with the company's address in California and administrative
contact information within the company.

The initial article by ZeroPaid was picked up among members of the tech web
immediately, which must have caused MediaDefender to realize that torrenters
were a little brighter than they had previously thought. Shortly thereafter,
the name in the whois record was changed, although MediaDefender's
postal *address
*remained intact. As of today, all of the whois contact information has been
removed and it instead reflects anonymous Domains by Proxy information set
up by GoDaddy. Since the MiiVi site's public exposure, it has since been
taken down and replaced with a parked GoDaddy page.

MediaDefender's Randy Saaf told Ars Technica that while the company does own
the domain to MiiVi, the story itself was completely made up. &quot;MediaDefender
was working on an internal project that involved video and didn't realize
that people would be trying to go to it and so we didn't password-protect
the site,&quot; Saaf said. &quot;It was just an oversight from that perspective. This
was not an entrapment site, and we were not working with the MPAA on it. In
fact, the MPAA didn't even know about it.&quot;

If this is true, why did MediaDefender immediately remove all contact
information from the whois registry for the domain? Saaf said that after
everything hit the fan, the company decided to take everything on the site
down because it was afraid of a hacker attack or &quot;people sending us spam.&quot;
Yes, spam.

The MPAA's Elizabeth Kaltman also chimed in to say that they had no
involvement with MiiVi: &quot;The MediaDefender story is false. We have no
relationship with that company at all,&quot; she told Ars.

We may never know MediaDefender's true motive behind MiiVi, but Saaf insists
that it was nothing more than an internal site for research and development
purposes only. If true, however, does this mean that MediaDefender could be
looking into such a scheme in the future? Our Magic 8-Ball says &quot;Reply hazy.
Ask again later.&quot;

Without a doubt, however, something isn't right with this story. If anyone
has a copy of the application that was originally hosted on MiiVi, we'd love
to get a look at it.
