Interesting that the ads on the page are for Christian things...
Hey, there's an idea - perhaps they can encourage environmentalism
by asking Christians not to light their houses and trees for their
holiday!  Just think of how much energy *that* would save.

Just as long as no one tells them about Shabbat candles, which are lit
every single week, or more than twice as many candles in the space of
a year than during Hanukkah.  &quot;Why do you need two Shabbat candles,
anyway?  Hashem said &quot;zachor&quot; and &quot;shamor&quot; in one breath, you can
represent both with one candle!&quot;

You may have something there.  Perhaps the environuts in the US
will ask people to abstain from xmas lights.  Let's see how well
that goes over!
