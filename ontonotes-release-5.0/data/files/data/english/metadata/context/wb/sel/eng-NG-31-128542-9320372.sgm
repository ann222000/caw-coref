Funny story. I've lost my iPod.

Not that I expect it to be in brighton, but it has my name etched into
the back of it along with the company I used to work for, pretty unique.

I'm sure it's nothing a quick sandblaster can't fix though... sigh.

iPods are crap anyway, I was waiting for the excuse to get something
better.

I'm pretty sure it was the bouncer at Lloyd's bar in Windsor who took
it, but how exactly do you question that ;)

I need to do some research, but I quite like archos.

I just don't want the dependency on iTunes, as I don't use a 'supported'
operating system, and I hear that the iPod touch has locked out all
third-party applications. So, I'm so-over iPods!

If you're into that sort of thing, all Cowon iAudios play ogg vorbis and
FLAC files. The audio quality is pretty good too. I've just recently
bought an iAudio7 which is pretty reasonable.

I previously had my eyes on one of these:

http://www.ebuyer.com/UK/product/124858 - Sandisk 4GB flash (£60?)

Also - bagged up a 2gb Creative Zen Stone at the weekend as a gift - acts as
a flash drive - open it, plug it in and you have lift off - very small -
nice and simple.

Nope

It's only since the iPod touch - and it was only discovered that they do
this 2 days ago or so - this will break all these third party apps

Also, I don't use or own a copy of Windows in any incarnation, so that
doesn't help either!

&gt; It's only since the iPod touch - and it was only discovered that they
do
&gt; this 2 days ago or so - this will break all these third party apps

&gt; Also, I don't use or own a copy of Windows in any incarnation, so that
&gt; doesn't help either!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I need to do some research, but I quite like archos.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just don't want the dependency on iTunes, as I don't use a
&gt; 'supported'
&gt; &gt; &gt; operating system, and I hear that the iPod touch has locked out
all
&gt; &gt; &gt; third-party applications. So, I'm so-over iPods!

&gt; &gt; This any good?

&gt; the back of it along with the company I used to work for, pretty unique.

&gt; I'm sure it's nothing a quick sandblaster can't fix though... sigh.

&gt; iPods are crap anyway, I was waiting for the excuse to get something
&gt; better.
