Be Humble to be Exalted

Matthew 23:10-12 [KJV]
10 &quot;Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.
11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.&quot;

Like my mail the day before yesterday (31/10/07 - You can not serve two masters) I would like you to understand that when you dig into the scripture in each word (Bible - word study) you will understand the true meaning of the scripture.

Before I get to the scripture I like to explain pride and humility (being humble) in simple terms.

Pride is being ahead of your self (thinking of your self, what you are not).
Humility is putting your self behind others not to remain there, but to push them ahead to you (lifting others).

Matthew 23 verses 10-12 tells us to resist from thinking ourselves as masters, for there is only master for us that is Christ. This does not mean that we devalue ourselves completely. For the Greek word used here for 'servant' is 'Diakonos' if correctly translated to English would be 'attendant' - Strong 1249 (person's relation to his work /activity).

Understanding this word changes the depth of the scripture. It is like a relation of a doctor to his work. However big the doctor may be, when he does his work he does all that is necessary to get the job done. When we call Christ our master, we work for Him. And when we work for Him we need to do all that is necessary to get the job done.

That means if the Lord has blessed you greatly do not reject it, enjoy it. Wear your good suites, or best of clothes or drive in the best of the cars you can. But if the Lord tells you help a poor child on the street get off that 'expensive' car and in those very 'good' clothes get on to the street and help that child. If you need to sit on the street and feed him, do so. Do not throw money from the window of your car and think you have done your job. Be humble in your work.

Most of us have the habit of getting someone else like a peon or a worker to get our work done and we feel satisfied that we have done our job as a good Christian. This we do for we think ourselves to be masters. Jesus warns us that if we do so, we will be humbled. So when you do the Lord's work, do not exalt yourself but humble your self in your work and you will be exalted.

[ Prayer for the Day ]

Lord Jesus, You were God in Heaven yet You came on earth as mere man. You humbled Yourself to the point of dearth to help us to receive our salvation so as to bring us to You. Help us lift others in our work in You, like You did. This I pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
