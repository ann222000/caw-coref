I just bought a used 2003 Concorde limited after my 99 Intrepid lost
its front end to a cab.  Although still greaving over the loss of my
intrepid, the Concorde is great.  The Concorde driver seat is a 8 way
power seat.  But the passanger seat seems to be a 6 way power seat. It
seats goes back and forth.  The back reclines up and back.  The front
seat botton goes up and down.  The only movement it does not have is
for the back of the seat bottom to go up and down, which is what I
would expect of a 6 way seat.  I knew about the issue before I got the
car and it does not cause me any great issues.  But I am wondering if
perhaps the switch is bad and it might be a 8 way seat. Does anyone
out there know if the 2003 Concorde Limited had a 6-way or a 8-way
passanger seat?  I have looked on various web sites with mixed
answers.

It may be worth fixing if it is only the switch.  But I understand if
the motor is the problem that they are hard to get by themselves and
it would not be worth it to me to fix.

Thanks Gary

I have an 02 and the two seats are certainly different.  I would call it a
4-way power seat on the passenger side, plus a power recliner.  Back in the
old days a 6-way was actually a bit different from what it does.  But
anyway, mine is just like you describe.

Many thanks:  Guess I got the terms mixed up.  My 99 intrepid had a
driver and passanger 8 way, which was my first power seat, so was
notsure what to call the Concorde passanger seat.  Get spoiled fast
with all the power stuff.
Thanks again Gary
