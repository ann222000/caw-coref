...when it involves people's dogs and cats dying :(

A massive pet food recall:

http://www.menufoods.com/recall/

What's most revealing is that this one company makes all the food for so
many brands, from the cheapest Walmart Ol' Roy's to the "premium" Iams,
Eukanuba, and Nutro.

I've been telling y'all for years that, if you are going to feed a
commercial pet food, it should be one of the dozen or so super premium
foods, like Canidae, Old Mother Hubbard, California Natural, Merrick, Paul
Newman's, etcetera.

I used to advise that, if you didn't, at least feed a premium one like Iams
or Nutro or Eukanuba.  WRONG! They had me fooled as well. Fuckers! Hope they
get their asses sued off by the dead animal owners.

FEED THESE!!

Screw that. 6 bucks for a 20lb bag of cat food at Winco. It wasn't on the

Then that would make you incorrect.

If your perfectly healthy cat dies at age, let's say, 10, and would have
died at age 13, given a better diet, how will you tell the difference?

My cat, which I got when she was 6 weeks old, lived to the ripe old age
of 18-1/2 years.  I never stuck with one brand or even one type of cat
food - varied brands of canned cat food, and switched brand of dry every
few months as well.

When my kids are, knock on wood, grown and gone from my house, we'll
probably get another cat, but until then, two male human animals are all
we can take care of here, and even that's tough.

It was the trendy organically-grown, all-natural spinach that spread
E.coli all over the country.  It's a crap shoot, and it has nothing to
do with how expensive, organic, premium, or ultra-cool it is,
regardless of whether it's human food or pet food.

BTW, when I say it's crap shoot, if Menu Foods produces over a billion
cans a year, there's a lot higher a probability of them turning out
some bad cans than the little "premium" companies who probably turn
out a few hundred thousand.

Oh ... and Eukanuba ... do all the trendy dog food companies pump
money into campaigns for the adoption of unwanted dogs in shelters the
way Eukanuba does?  Or do they just assume their customer base is
limited to folks who feed trendy dog food to their AKC-registered
canines?

&gt;&gt;&gt; different gimmicky marketing.

&gt;&gt; If your perfectly healthy cat dies at age, let's say, 10, and would have

&gt; My cat, which I got when she was 6 weeks old, lived to the ripe old age of
&gt; 18-1/2 years.  I never stuck with one brand or even one type of cat food -
&gt; varied brands of canned cat food, and switched brand of dry every few
&gt; months as well.

&gt; When my kids are, knock on wood, grown and gone from my house, we'll
&gt; probably get another cat, but until then, two male human animals are all
&gt; we can take care of here, and even that's tough.

Doesn't answer the question. The answer is, you can't tell the difference.
All one can do is feed the highest quality diet one can afford, and make the
assumption that it probably helps.

It's the same philosophy I apply to life extentionist supplementation, and
we disagree there as well. The nice thing about a free country: you and
yours eat what you decide, me and mine do likewise. It's the American Way!

&gt;&gt;I used to advise that, if you didn't, at least feed a premium one like
&gt;&gt;Iams
&gt;&gt;or Nutro or Eukanuba.  WRONG! They had me fooled as well. Fuckers! Hope
&gt;&gt;they
&gt;&gt;get their asses sued off by the dead animal owners.

&gt; It was the trendy organically-grown, all-natural spinach that spread
&gt; E.coli all over the country.  It's a crap shoot, and it has nothing to
&gt; do with how expensive, organic, premium, or ultra-cool it is,
&gt; regardless of whether it's human food or pet food.
">

Irrelevant analogy. None of the dog foods I recommended are "expensive,
organic, premium, or ultra-cool". They are simply made, carefully, by small
companies that do no mass marketing, and consist of high quality
ingredients, in the proper proportions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; BTW, when I say it's crap shoot, if Menu Foods produces over a billion
&gt; cans a year, there's a lot higher a probability of them turning out
&gt; some bad cans than the little &quot;premium&quot; companies who probably turn
&gt; out a few hundred thousand.

I wasn't particularly commenting of the recall itself. Shit happens. As I
said, above, "What's most revealing is that this one company makes all the
food for so many brands, from the cheapest Walmart Ol' Roy's to the
"premium" Iams, Eukanuba, and Nutro." It's the latter companies that like to
portray themselves as "premium", better than the rest, when, as it turns
out, they simply have better marketing departments and a different label
design. Why are you buying Iams? Same stuff as Walmart Ol' Roy. This doesn't
piss you off? You don't want the difference in what you've paid all these
years for "premium" pet food back from Iams?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oh ... and Eukanuba ... do all the trendy dog food companies pump
&gt; money into campaigns for the adoption of unwanted dogs in shelters the
&gt; way Eukanuba does?
">

They do so in an amount commensurate with their much smaller size.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or do they just assume their customer base is

Uncalled for snipe, irrelevant to the conversation, and not worth dignifying

I follow the same ideas. But I go the cheaper route, if one can't go tell
the difference why spend the extra money? I would think that a variety in
brands (organic to processed, cheap to expensive, vegetarian to meat,
etc.) would probably be the safest route to provide your animal with a
balanced diet. My girlfriend constantly acquires the 'spensive pet foods
and we alternate feeding them the cheap stuff and the 'spensive stuff at
arbitrary intervals. Funny thing though, my cats seem to like the 20lb/$6
stuff better than the expensive brands

To drift further off topic, how much do MFW cat owners feed their cats? I
house-sit for a friend who has two morbidly obese cats, one of which I have
to give insulin injections. If pets are incapable of regulating their
consumption in an environment of food surplus, how should we regulate it
for them?

&gt;&gt; All one can do is feed the highest quality diet one can afford, and make the
&gt;&gt; assumption that it probably helps.

&gt; Maybe I should start packaging regular dog food under the name &quot;Tree
&gt; Hugger's Organic Gourmet&quot; and labeling it with a pic of a dog wearing
&gt; a macrame collar, then quadrupling the price tag.  Voila!  Instant
&gt; high quality dog food!

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.menufoods.com/recall/

&gt;&gt;&gt; What's most revealing is that this one company makes all the food for so
&gt;&gt;&gt; many brands, from the cheapest Walmart Ol' Roy's to the &quot;premium&quot; Iams,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Eukanuba, and Nutro.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been telling y'all for years that, if you are going to feed a
&gt;&gt;&gt; commercial pet food, it should be one of the dozen or so super premium
&gt;&gt;&gt; foods, like Canidae, Old Mother Hubbard, California Natural, Merrick, Paul
&gt;&gt;&gt; Newman's, etcetera.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to advise that, if you didn't, at least feed a premium one like
&gt;&gt;&gt; Iams
&gt;&gt;&gt; or Nutro or Eukanuba.  WRONG! They had me fooled as well. Fuckers! Hope
&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; get their asses sued off by the dead animal owners.

&gt;&gt; It was the trendy organically-grown, all-natural spinach that spread
&gt;&gt; E.coli all over the country.  It's a crap shoot, and it has nothing to
&gt;&gt; do with how expensive, organic, premium, or ultra-cool it is,
&gt;&gt; regardless of whether it's human food or pet food.

&gt; Irrelevant analogy. None of the dog foods I recommended are &quot;expensive,
&gt; organic, premium, or ultra-cool&quot;. They are simply made, carefully, by small
&gt; companies that do no mass marketing, and consist of high quality
&gt; ingredients, in the proper proportions.

&gt;&gt; BTW, when I say it's crap shoot, if Menu Foods produces over a billion
&gt;&gt; cans a year, there's a lot higher a probability of them turning out
&gt;&gt; some bad cans than the little &quot;premium&quot; companies who probably turn
&gt;&gt; out a few hundred thousand.

&gt; I wasn't particularly commenting of the recall itself. Shit happens. As I
&gt; said, above, &quot;What's most revealing is that this one company makes all the
&gt; food for so many brands, from the cheapest Walmart Ol' Roy's to the
&gt; &quot;premium&quot; Iams, Eukanuba, and Nutro.&quot; It's the latter companies that like to
&gt; portray themselves as &quot;premium&quot;, better than the rest, when, as it turns
&gt; out, they simply have better marketing departments and a different label
&gt; design. Why are you buying Iams? Same stuff as Walmart Ol' Roy. This doesn't
&gt; piss you off? You don't want the difference in what you've paid all these
&gt; years for &quot;premium&quot; pet food back from Iams?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Newman's, etcetera.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Screw that. 6 bucks for a 20lb bag of cat food at Winco. It wasn't on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; recall list and my cats are in perfect health. I'd say the real moral
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the story is premium != better. It's all the same, just different
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; gimmicky
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; marketing.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Then that would make you incorrect.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If your perfectly healthy cat dies at age, let's say, 10, and would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; died at age 13, given a better diet, how will you tell the difference?

&gt;&gt; &gt; And some people fall for the gimmicky marketing.

&gt;&gt; True. I just HATE all the gimmicky marketing that Canidae, Merrick, Flint
&gt;&gt; River Ranch, etcetera, engage in. I mean, did you SEE that last TV
&gt;&gt; commercial by Old Mother Hubbard? The one with Shania Twain, naked,
&gt;&gt; holding
&gt;&gt; her little pussy?

&gt;&gt; What? Didn't see it? Hmmm...

&gt; My oldest cat (a Siamese) is 19...
&gt; A bit skinny as old cats tend to get hyperthyroidism, but she's till
&gt; doing well. :-)

&gt; A good diet, for ANY animal (including humans) can never hurt.
">

Exactly. Can I PROVE a better diet keeps dogs healthier, longer? Nope. But I
can afford to feed the slightly more expersive super premium dog foods
(which, after this revealing episode, I will refer to as high quality food,
as opposed to everything else), and will assume it helps, and, as you state,
"can never hurt".

If I were homeless, living in the park under the bridge, I'd feed, and
probably eat, Ol' Roys from Walmart. The vast majority of pet owners, who
spend literally BILLIONS of dollars a year on their animals, can afford high
quality foods. Many of them thought they were feeding high quality foods
when they fed Iams, Nutro, and Eukanuba. They were lied to.

The only thing better than the commercial high quality foods I recommended

&gt; I follow the same ideas. But I go the cheaper route, if one can't go tell
&gt; the difference why spend the extra money? I would think that a variety in
&gt; brands (organic to processed, cheap to expensive, vegetarian to meat,
&gt; etc.) would probably be the safest route to provide your animal with a
&gt; balanced diet. My girlfriend constantly acquires the 'spensive pet foods
&gt; and we alternate feeding them the cheap stuff and the 'spensive stuff at
&gt; arbitrary intervals.
">

It costs little more to switch among the various high quality foods. The
owners of the dead pets from this recall may be wishing they had. Not one of
those on the recall list.

This is the point I seem NOT to be getting across here. My complaint is not
the recall. Shit happens. It may be no one's fault. What pisses me off, and
should be pissing off every Iams, Nutro, and Eukanuba customer, is that
those companies have lied all these years, portraying themselves as
"premium", better than the "cheap stuff". They ARE the cheap stuff, only
more expensive.

&gt;&gt;&gt; do with how expensive, organic, premium, or ultra-cool it is,
&gt;&gt;&gt; regardless of whether it's human food or pet food.

&gt;&gt;Irrelevant analogy. None of the dog foods I recommended are &quot;expensive,
&gt;&gt;organic, premium, or ultra-cool&quot;. They are simply made, carefully, by
&gt;&gt;small
&gt;&gt;companies that do no mass marketing, and consist of high quality
&gt;&gt;ingredients, in the proper proportions.

&gt; And you've visited the manufacturers to confirm their processing and
&gt; packing methods, and to analyze the final product for the proper
&gt; ingredients?

Yup. Got one of those.

to worry that Mec-Gars were actually manufactured by Wilson. Because, unlike
the big pet food companies, the firearms industry has an extraordinary

How do you figure? Given the same probability, they will simply turn out
more bad cans due to their larger production. Why would the probability
change?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Screw that. 6 bucks for a 20lb bag of cat food at Winco. It wasn't on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recall list and my cats are in perfect health. I'd say the real moral to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the story is premium != better. It's all the same, just different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gimmicky
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marketing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then that would make you incorrect.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If your perfectly healthy cat dies at age, let's say, 10, and would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; died at age 13, given a better diet, how will you tell the difference?

&gt;&gt;&gt; My cat is already 13, eats Iams kibble, and is in good health.

&gt;&gt; Doesn't answer the question. The answer is, you can't tell the difference.
&gt;&gt; All one can do is feed the highest quality diet one can afford, and make the
&gt;&gt; assumption that it probably helps.
&gt; I follow the same ideas. But I go the cheaper route, if one can't go tell
&gt; the difference why spend the extra money? I would think that a variety in
&gt; brands (organic to processed, cheap to expensive, vegetarian to meat,
&gt; etc.) would probably be the safest route to provide your animal with a
&gt; balanced diet. My girlfriend constantly acquires the 'spensive pet foods
&gt; and we alternate feeding them the cheap stuff and the 'spensive stuff at
&gt; arbitrary intervals. Funny thing though, my cats seem to like the 20lb/$6
&gt; stuff better than the expensive brands
">

In the UK we recently had a bad national food scare with Mad Cow
Disease. Seems it was being spread by the habit of some cow food
suppliers of adding protein from cow carcasses to their cow feed
mixes. Cows don't naturally eat other cows, but the supplier had
access to plenty of cheap dead cow carcasses, so why not?

In the case of this pet food I note that a suspicious finger has been
pointed at the use of wheat gluten from "a certain source" as a
protein supplement. *Wheat* gluten? The stuff that causes life
threatening digestive problems in those few humans who don't have the
specific genes necessary to digest this recent addition (recent in
evolutionary timesscales) to the human diet? A protein that wheat
developed to stop animals eating its grains by making them ill?

Cats and dogs are carnivores, meat eaters. What kind of diet are they
being fed which needs a protein *supplement*? A cheap one with too
little meat in it, obviously. Is it a good idea to supplement the diet
of an animal which can't naturally eat a single grain with a
grain-based product?

Well it is if it's cheap and you're trying to make a profit...

I'd like to see some of that. :-)

Speaking of guns...

I finally got my replacement part from Taurus last Monday and got to
play with my 9mm at the range Saturday morning. I noted that the inside
of the gun was a bit dry which might be why it broke in the first place.

I carefully applied a bit of Rem-oil to the interior before
re-assembling it this time.

Put 90 rounds thru it (3 different brands of cheap 9mm ball ammo., CCI,
Magtech and Ultramax). Not a single jam. Flawless performance. ;-)

Here are 3 targets using Ultramax which was the cheapest. Bought it in
bulk with an ammo box. Yes I know I need to work on my 25 yard shots...

Taurus PT-92, 25 yards, Standing, Ultramax:
http://i15.tinypic.com/2lkweau.jpg

Taurus PT-92, 15 yards, Standing, Ultramax:
http://i18.tinypic.com/314xjj9.jpg

Taurus PT-92, 5 yards, Standing, Ultramax:
http://i17.tinypic.com/2djyoeg.jpg

I've also gotten better with the IJ .22. I used to have a prejudice
against small, light guns because I could not hit the broad side of a
barn with this one. I've started using the Weaver stance (and read up on
proper grip) and my precision has gotten a lot better. I'm looking at
Cold Pythons now as a backup weapon:

&gt; I finally got my replacement part from Taurus last Monday and got to
&gt; play with my 9mm at the range Saturday morning. I noted that the inside
&gt; of the gun was a bit dry which might be why it broke in the first place.

&gt; I carefully applied a bit of Rem-oil to the interior before
&gt; re-assembling it this time.

Break Free is my favorite.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Put 90 rounds thru it (3 different brands of cheap 9mm ball ammo., CCI,
&gt; Magtech and Ultramax).

People who love their guns only feed them expensive ammo.

No, wait, that's pets, not guns. Sorry. I got confused :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not a single jam. Flawless performance. ;-)

Well, it was ball ammo. I wouldn't expect much failure. Gotta' put a few
hundred rounds of full power hollow points throught it, too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Here are 3 targets using Ultramax which was the cheapest. Bought it in
&gt; bulk with an ammo box. Yes I know I need to work on my 25 yard shots...

Nicely done.

Get some Religion of Peace Practitioner targets. Might as well get used to
that sight picture now.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I should start packaging regular dog food under the name &quot;Tree
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hugger's Organic Gourmet&quot; and labeling it with a pic of a dog
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wearing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a macrame collar, then quadrupling the price tag.  Voila!  Instant
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; high quality dog food!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;That is essentially what Iams, Nutro, and Eukanuba have been doing all
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;these
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;years.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; See my previous response regarding the Iams kibble I feed our dogs.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You really should do the research before you make certain
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; presumptions.

&gt;&gt; &gt;They've been lying all these years about their canned food, but, let's
&gt;&gt; &gt;trust
&gt;&gt; &gt;them about the dry food. Yeah. Bridge in Brooklyn is still available for
&gt;&gt; &gt;you
&gt;&gt; &gt;on Ebay.

&gt;&gt; &lt;heh&gt;  So shoot me with that expensive Kimber ... if you can hit with
&gt;&gt; the first shot, that is.

&gt; Just out of curiosity, which Kimber does Cohen own?

I don't think that's the question, for two reasons:

1) It doesn't excuse the lies.

2) The "specs" aren't the issue for me. The quality is. Most all pet foods
have the proper percentage of protein, fats, micronutrients. The issue is
the quality of those ingredients. The shills for the pet food companies on
the dog news groups like to maintain that macronutrient percentages are all
that matter. Despite the fact that a proper % food could be compounded with
the slop shoveled off the slaughter house floor, some road kill, and a bit
of elephant shit thrown in. It is unreasonable to believe that the same
manufacturing plant uses fresh, wholesome, human grade meat and by-products
for one company, and animal digest from euthanized pets for another.

Speaking of which, a large study of dog foods found traces of pentobarbital
in many of them (the ones on the recall list, for example). There is only
one possible source of pentobarbital in dog foods: euthanized pets and zoo
animals. Yummy :(

For your trip to Las Vegas? There are two within a short cab ride from The
Strip: The Gun Store on East Tropicana, and American Shooters off West
Spring Mountain on Arville. Both will rent you anything you want, including
full auto submachineguns. Have fun :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iams,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Eukanuba, and Nutro.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been telling y'all for years that, if you are going to feed a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; commercial pet food, it should be one of the dozen or so super
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; premium
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; foods, like Canidae, Old Mother Hubbard, California Natural,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Merrick, Paul
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Newman's, etcetera.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Screw that. 6 bucks for a 20lb bag of cat food at Winco. It wasn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the recall list and my cats are in perfect health. I'd say the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; real moral to the story is premium != better. It's all the same,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just different gimmicky marketing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then that would make you incorrect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If your perfectly healthy cat dies at age, let's say, 10, and would
&gt;&gt;&gt; have died at age 13, given a better diet, how will you tell the
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference?

&gt;&gt; My cat, which I got when she was 6 weeks old, lived to the ripe old
&gt;&gt; age of 18-1/2 years.  I never stuck with one brand or even one type
&gt;&gt; of cat food - varied brands of canned cat food, and switched brand of
&gt;&gt; dry every few months as well.

&gt;&gt; When my kids are, knock on wood, grown and gone from my house, we'll
&gt;&gt; probably get another cat, but until then, two male human animals are
&gt;&gt; all we can take care of here, and even that's tough.

&gt; There are the 120 year old Russians up in the Ural Mountains who smoke
&gt; like chimneys.

&gt; Therefore, smoking is not bad for you.

&gt; David
">

I've been meaning to start smoking - thanks for the reminder.

FWIW, my choice of cat food was never part of any grand design.  I just
never seemed to be able to find the same thing at the store on a regular
basis.
