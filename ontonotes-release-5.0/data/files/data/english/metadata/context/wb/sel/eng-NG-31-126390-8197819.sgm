I haven't been keeping up with the latest news. But does anyone know
if a uninstaller has been mentioned? I miss the old days when Mac's
had a built in uninstaller. I hate having to drag applications/
programs I don't want to the trash. Because half the time there is
remnants left on the system somewhere. By the way are there any 3rd
parties applications that can keep track of applications/programs that
are installed on OSX?

1. There's been no public mention of any such capability beyond what
might be achievable with Time Machine.

2. Doing a reliable, centralized, general-purpose uninstaller is
virtually impossible.

">

The capabilities have been present in the installer engines provided by
Apple since the days of OS 8, at least, to implement uninstaller
capabilities (might have been earlier; however, I first got involved
with that capability in 1991-92). However, as in the case of
determining what to install, when, and where, it has been the
responsibility of the developer creating the installer rules and
defining the packages to instantiate that functionality. Since it
requires more effort to determine what can be safely removed than
determining whether something needs to be installed, many ...imo
&quot;most&quot;... developers skip the uninstaller functionality (in
installation, if the necessary component isn't present, you install it;
however, removing some component that is present might break another
app that depends upon it -- such as a shared library or a shared
framework).

Similarly uninstall functionality is available through third-party
installer engines as well, for example MindVision's VISE and
Aladdin/Smith Micro's StuffIt InstallerMaker and, due to the virtual
impossibility of doing a perfect job of uninstalling (there is no
&quot;trail&quot; as to whether some other application/service is using a
component outside of the application package), the capability is again
generally unexercised.

Apple's current installer, with the bookkeeping trail it leaves, is a
step in the direction of making uninstaller logic more solid, still
leaves the gaps that unavoidably accompany any installation that does
not employ the functionality as well as holes left by the Migration
Assistant and similar tools that go outside the framework.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't been keeping up with the latest news. But does anyone know

&gt; &gt; 1. There's been no public mention of any such capability beyond what
&gt; &gt; might be achievable with Time Machine.

&gt; &gt; 2. Doing a reliable, centralized, general-purpose uninstaller is
&gt; &gt; virtually impossible.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I miss the old days when Mac's had a built in uninstaller.

&gt; &gt; When was that? Granted I only started using Macs seriously when the Plus
&gt; &gt; came out, but I don't recall any such thing.
&gt; OS 9 had a uninstaller.

As a software developer (thus, someone who paid quite a bit of attention
to deployment mechanisms) I used Mac OS 9 as my primary OS from the day
it shipped until 10.2 was released. There was no built-in uninstaller.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You lost me when you introduced this Mac lack character.  Why does he not
&gt; &gt; &gt; capitalize his last name?

&gt; &gt; It's a family thing. His brother, Shel, doesn't capitalize the last
&gt; &gt; name either, althugh he does drop the &quot;k&quot;.

A frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He can see from her
nameplate that the teller¹s name is Patricia Whack. He says, ³Ms. Whack, I¹d
like to get a loan to buy a boat and go on a long vacation.²

Patricia looks at the frog in disbelief and asks how much he wants to
borrow. The frog says $30,000. The teller asks his name and the frog says
that his name is Kermit Jagger and that it¹s OK, he knows the bank manager.

Patricia explains that $30,000 is a substantial amount of money and that he
will need to secure some collateral against the loan. She asks if he has
anything he can use as collateral.

The frog says, ³Sure. I have this.² He produces a tiny pink porcelain
elephant, about half an inch tall. It¹s bright pink and perfectly formed.

Very confused, Patti explains that she¹ll have to consult with the manager;
and disappears into a back office. She finds the manager and reports:
³There¹s a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you, and
he wants to borrow $30,000 to buy a boat. And he wants to use this as
collateral.²

She holds up the tiny pink elephant. ³I mean, what the heck is this?²

The manager looks back at her and says, ³It¹s a knick knack, Patti Whack.
Give the frog a loan. His old man¹s a Rolling Stone!²

In one of his posts he specifically said OS 9, so that rules out the
latter.  The former, of course, can never be ruled out.
