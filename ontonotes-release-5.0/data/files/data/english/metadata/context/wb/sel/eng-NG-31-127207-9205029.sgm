Stanback fared well in his debut as Tyson's
replacement, but unfortunately, suffered a
shoulder injury that will keep him out of
this Sunday's game. Last year, Miles Austin
had the Cowboys' only KR for a TD, in the
playoff game, and may be 'next up' to be
the primary kickoff returner.

Even though it occurred a bit late, I am
pleased to see the Cowboys finally have
given someone else a chance as primary
KR (reference a post I made on Oct. 4):

Miles from home, Austin shines

Excerpts:

Not that Miles Austin has anything else on his
mind this week. What with the defining NFC
East game on Sunday afternoon at Giants Sta-
dium, and a possible expanded role that could
place him in center of the maelstrom just min-
utes away from where he grew up.

&quot;How's Monmouth doing?&quot; inquired the voice
on the other end of the telephone. &quot;I saw they
won big (over St. Francis). I only get to see
the scores down here.&quot;

Turns out you can take the kid out of West Long
Branch, but you can't take the Hawk out of him.

When you consider the path he's taken to cover
just the few miles from his Garfield home to the
Meadowlands, what transpires on the FieldTurf,
with the pressure of a Giants-Cowboys' clash
magnified by the postseason ramifications, will
be anything but intimidating.

He was merely a talented project with size and
speed when he showed up at Kessler Field,
eventually rewriting the Monmouth University
receiving record book. He was an undrafted
rookie free agent, better known as &quot;dog meat&quot;
in the NFL vernacular, when he unpacked his
bags in Thousand Oaks, Calif., two summers
ago, ultimately catching the eye of Bill Parcells,
who has a penchant for taking to &quot;Jersey guys.&quot;

Then, as he's had to do his entire career, he
was forced to prove himself once again this
summer when head coach Wade Phillips and
his crew came onboard.

&quot;It was tough. With a new staff, not knowing
how things are going to go. You hear nasty
rumors about coaches having &quot;their guys,' &quot;
Austin said. &quot;But I just had to prepare like
I did for the last training camp. Prepare like
my name is the one on the chopping block.&quot;

Actually, it was. There were 11 receivers in
training camp, and five of the six slots were
already spoken for with Terry Glenn, Terrell
Owens, Patrick Crayton, Sam Hurd and fourth
rounder Isaiah Stanback. Do the math. It placed
the Turk's axe squarely on the back of Austin's
neck.

Then, in the preseason finale, Jerheme Urban,
his primary competition, returned a punt 95
yards for a touchdown.

Yet, it's Austin who could be deep as the Cow-
boys' primary kickoff returner with Stanback
nursing a separated shoulder, resurrecting a
role he excelled in last season after Tyson
Thompson broke his ankle.

His 26-yard average was the highest by a Cow-
boys' rookie since &quot;Bullet Bob&quot; Hayes in 1965,
when the Fastest Man on Earth averaged 26.6
yards. He then etched his name in America's
Team lore by becoming the first to take one to
the house in the postseason, racing 93 yards in
Seattle to give them a second-half lead.

It was at Monmouth 19 months ago that a scout
from the Cowboys and Ray Sherman, then an
assistant coach with the Tennessee Titans, spent
time watching Austin run routes, catch passes
and go through agility drills. Now Sherman's in
his first year as the Cowboys' receivers coach.

&quot;I'm pleased with his progress,&quot; Sherman said.
&quot;He's got a lot of potential. He works hard and
he's got good size and speed.&quot;

While Austin's contributions on special teams
are where he's made his mark, including seven
tackles this season, he's still looking for his first
catch on offense.

For a time during the preseason, it was those
receiving skills, which accounted for 33 touch-
downs among his 150 catches at Monmouth,
totaling 2,867 yards, that appeared to put his
job in jeopardy at one point. Several drops,
and another route where he slipped, resulting
in a Tony Romo interception, placed him
squarely on thin ice. But with one final chance
to prove himself, he made three catches for 37
yards against the Vikings, with two more re-
ceptions for 62 yards negated by penalties.

Two days later he'd made the 53-main roster.

&quot;I'm happy with whatever role I have out there,&quot;
he said. &quot;I just like winning games, and that's
what we're doing now. I'm not playing the
game for the money. I just want to be able to
do something to contribute to the team. And
making tackles on special teams is helping the
team.

&quot;The biggest thing for me is that the game has
slowed down. The difference from the first to
the second year is pretty big. I understand the
game more now, and I'm more confident in
what I'm doing.&quot;

It's that confidence and awareness that might
just help the Cowboys against the team Austin
grew up rooting for. And you can be pretty
certain that, amid the last minute preparations
at the team hotel Saturday night, and the obli-
gatory meet and greet with family and friends,
he'll find time to check on how Monmouth
did against Albany.

I don't understand why Austin hasn't been doing it all year.  The TD against
Seattle was great, for sure, but I guess people forget that he averaged 26
yards per return last season after Thompson went down.  Not only that, but
23 or his 29 returns went for more that 20 yards.  He came close to breaking
a half-dozen returns before the big one in the playoffs.
