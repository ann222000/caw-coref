LCD monitor prices have been holding pretty steady for a while, but
I've seen a few news articles indicating that they may start coming
down sometime around mid-summer. Any indications on whether it's
worth waiting a couple months or so?

"/> Yeah, I know. But the day after would be ok, it's generally 31 days
after that gets annoying. :)

The 17&quot; LCD monitors have been around $400-500 for quite a while now,
I'm sure the law will require them to drop to $200 the day after....

"/>  History says that isn't very likely. What you MAY find is closeout
specials on &quot;older technology&quot;
units, but the production lines will generally shift wholesale to the faster
material (unless it's done
by &quot;overdrive&quot; technology, which will result in higher prices due to added
parts).

Can't beat 'em, and can't join 'em - just have to live with what's
available, IMHO.

You can get some already - look out for reviews on the Samsung Syncmaster
172 X - response times of 12ms and very highly rated - though for a price -
Â£400 in  www.komplett.co.uk  and I am sure similar prices in the states...

I don't mind that - I also remember reading that it was 16.2 million colours
as opposed to true 16 bit which is 16.7 million colours.

Can many people distinguish between 16, 24 or 32 bit colour ranges??

I've been watching the prices for about 2 years and it seems like prices
are fropping about 10% a quarter. The well known brands aren't deopping as
fast as the unkowns. I'm waiting till the nmae brand 19&quot; is well under
$500.00 with at least a 3 yr renewable warranty before I buy .

I probably couldn't tell 24- from 32-bit, but AFAIK no LCD is remotely
capable of 32-bit colour.

16-bit is easily spotted though, when doing photo work.

"/> Well, technically, there's not going to be anything capable of
&quot;32-bit&quot; color; assuming you want equal dynamic range on
all three channels, your choices would be either 30 bit
(10 bits/primary) or 33 (11 bits/primary). 10-bit drivers
are starting to become available now, although certainly
this level of performance is not yet common in mainstream
products. Even 24 bits (8 per primary) would be more than
adequate, though, IF something more sensible than simple
linear encoding is used.

&gt; A good point and one which, to my shame, I'd never noticed. So any idea
&gt; what Windows display drivers mean when they refer to 32-bit colour?

"/> 24 bit color and 8 bit used for either padding or alpha, there are various
hardware related reasons why it is faster to read and write to/from memory
with chunks which have size multiples of the memory bus width. At this point
the biggest reason is inertia and existing practise. Internally GPU could
use whatever &quot;virtual&quot; channel width they want because the data read and
write packets could be muxed and demuxed to whatever width the memory bus
would have, and there would propably be a memory controller / cache between
the memory and the &quot;client transistors&quot; anyway.

Origins of this practise date to the times when CPU was used to compute what
color each pixel should be and the way the commonly used x86 compatible
processors read and write from/to the memory. 32 bit color is more
convenient than for instance 24 bit color because single pixel is single
read or write to update. This means the code is less complex to write in
order to be more efficient.

Here's illustration, these numbers correspond to memory addreses:

|0123|4567|... and so on

Each address is 8 bits worth of data. 32 bit variable (for instance cpu
register) would take four slots, I took liberty of making these slots with
|'s in above illustration. When 32 bit data is read each 32 bit &quot;block&quot; of
data is aligned to begin every 32 bits (every four bytes, 8 bits is a
byte..) what this means in practise is that it is fast to read and write
single block at a time.

If we read 32 bits worth of data from, say, address 3 in above illustration
it would mean the block consists of addreses: 3,4,5,6. This block crosses a
boundary, this means the memory read or write is MISALIGNED. In most other
microarchitechtures this would immediately terminate the execution of the
program to runtime error / hardware exception.

On x86 this is just performance hit: it means for instance when reading,
that the system has to read from both two blocks, then shift the bits around
to form 32 bits of coherent data so that it can be returned to the process
that executed the command to read from said address.

To put it in English: reading from address which is multiple of 32 bits is
simply FASTER, and in computer graphics FASTER IS BETTER, right? 16 bit
works the same way, each 16 bit block of data is aligned to begin every 16
bits and so on. This is why 16 bit color is also alright. But it means less
bits for color which is very bad, typical 16 bit format is 565, which means
5 bits for red and blue and 6 bits for green. 5 bits means we have 32
different intensities we can store into the bits, yes, that is not very much
and yet, it looks pretty crappy unless dithered (which costs performance so
it is a Bad Thing).

Alright. 24 bit color has 8 bits per component which means 256 different
levels of intensity. This is adequate (not enough, IMHO; but adequate.. in
near future we'll be using floating-point color everywhere but not just
yet..). While 24 bits is enough bits for color it is not very good width for
pixel because only every 3rd pixel is aligned to 32 bit boundary and
depending on the coordinate we are writing to this means only 33% of pixels
are &quot;fast to write&quot;, if we are writing random pixels which we ofcourse are
not doing very often (software rendering loves to process pixels scanline at
a time because this reduces the amount of computation we need to do). But
still, the code must be quite a bit more complex to arrange things so that
we can write 32 bits at a time and into aligned address. There are also
masking issues I won't go into, Too Much Detail. Here's another schematic:

|RGBR|GBRG|BRGB|

RGB block above is single pixel. |....| is block of 32 bits of data. As we
can see to write single pixel we have to write typically into two separate
32 bit data blocks! And! We also have to make it so that the other parts of
the data block we write are PRESERVED. To preserve them, we have to READ
first to know what's in there, then use bitwise AND to mask out bits we want
to overwrite, then use bitwise OR to combine the bits we want to write
there, and THEN we can write the resulting color into the buffer. Sounds
like a lot of work doesn't it?

Look at 32 bit color:

|ARGB|ARGB|ARGB|

Each pixel fits precisely into single 32 bit block of data. If we want to
write a pixel, we just write it. Much Simpler, isn't it?

The A, Alpha component is used usually for &quot;alpha blending&quot;, which is
interesting topic on it's own but let's skip it for now. The A might not be
used, then the bits are ignored. You wan write whatever values you want
there and it will have no effect whatsoever. The bits are there just to make
life easier, think it like this:

|?RGB|?RGB|... and so on.

Matrox atleast supports 32 bit color mode where 10 bits are used for red,
green and blue and two bits are used for A (or just ignored). You will want
to have a CRT to enjoy the 10 bit per component color because if I am not
mistaken TFT's only do 8 bit per component or there about (correct me if
wrong).

Hope this helps. Yes, I have too much time.

"/> I believe it's usually 3 8-bit channels stored in 4 bytes; the fourth
byte is sacrificed to maintain 32-bit alignment. Some graphics engines
and drivers may be more efficient in this mode, because it causes all
data accesses to be 32-bit aligned. Some software won't work properly
in 24-bit mode and requires 32-bit mode.

(Because you can sacrifice a bit or so of resolution in the blue
channel, you could conceivably have an 11/11/10-bit RGB in 32 bits,
but I don't know of anybody who does this.)

you mean this snip:

When you put it into context of memory organization you realize I was
talking about framebuffer, not display technology. Do you want another
lengthy lecture why floating-point framebuffer is advantageous in image
generation? I really don't have as much time currently as I had when made
the previous post.

I will be brief:

- floating-point framebuffer has more stops for intensity ramps in
low-intensity range which is crucial for good looking gamma correction: when
you &quot;zoom&quot; (luminance wise) into limited numeric range with fixed integer
steps from one intensity to another banding will appear, especially on
really dark areas of generated image.

- we can store intensity values over 1.0 maximum, even though the DAC will
clamp each component to 1.0 when we do post-processing and multipass
rendering we will find out that more vibrant and bright images are possible
to generate compared to color blending system where everything is saturated
to range from 0.0 to 1.0

- more precision will mean less loss of precision, example:

If we have 4 layers we are blending together we lose lowest bit to round-off
error every time, in this case it means maximum error will be 4. this means
two bits. Out of 8 bits of precision means we have only 6 significant bits
left so we only have 64 distinct luminance values we have control on how
they are computed.

- 8 bits per primary component is too little for any serious work, the next
logical step is 16 bits per component because it adds up to a nice
power-of-two sum (64 bits). Silicon Graphics used 12 bits (integer) per
primary on their workstation chipsets for years. This was a compromise we
don't have to do anymore because we are beyond the point where it is too
cost inefficient to implement floating-point arithmetic at affordable price.
The reason for this is that the we can now pack more transistors into
smaller area which means we can make chips smaller which means higher yields
which means products are cheaper to manufacture so we can finally get this
incredible performance and feature-rich hardware for peanuts.

It really doesn't take a rocket-scientist to figure this out. The Display
Technology doesn't have to keep up even, 8 bpp or even 10 bpp per component
displays are alright. More would be better obviously but the more serious
quality bottleneck of the framebuffer has atleast been overcome in
higher-end hardware. Now there is loss only at end of the pipeline: not in
every single step, add increased range for color components for the image
generation and it's a no-brainer. So the increased precision helps in more
ways than one.

Did you know that is is very difficult to get &quot;perfect gray&quot; on RGB565?
Interested in why? Even if not, the point is that 888 is just split of hair
away from 565, barely above the treshold of adequate. I would expect
intelligent beings to aim higher. And we are.

&gt; Since you fail to quote the specific part of my post I must extrapolate
that
&gt; you mean this snip:

"/> Joe, this: :-) is a smiley. It is used to indicate a response that
is to be taken less-than-completely-seriously. In this case, about
half seriously, if that.

Yes, I am well aware of the advantages of floating-point representation
within a frame buffer - however, ultimately, all images wind up being
presented to human users, with regular ol' human vision, on SOME
sort of electronic display. So the serious point to be taken from my
half-serious comment is that it makes little sense to build performance
into the graphics hardware which could never have a visible impact on
the displayed image.

Does this mean that I think that 8 bit/primary linear encoding is
adequate? Of course not; however, we don't quite have to go to a
full floating-point representation, either, in order to provide a good
deal more color information than any practical display device will
every be capable of, or for that matter could possibly be handled
by the human visual system. Somewhere in the neighborhood
of 10-12 bits/primary, ESPECIALLY if we think beyond simply
linear encoding, you're at the point where further improvements
are likely going to be not worth the effort - from those perspectives.

Re your latest, more specific points:

"/> On the other hand, it IS reasonable to ask just how much you need
in this respect, and what the best practical means is for delivering it.
There's also a difference between how images are generated (and the
accuracy you need to carry around in the numbers within that process)
and the representation you finally want to come up with for delivery
to the output hardware. And please note that your &quot;snip&quot;
DID include the following:

&quot;This is adequate (not enough, IMHO; but adequate.. in
near future we'll be using floating-point color everywhere but not just
yet..).&quot;

I can't tell from this what you meant by &quot;everywhere,&quot; but to ME,
that would imply things like the DAC (if you've got one) or, more
likely, whatever digital representation you're feeding to your
display device.

In short, let's try not to take any of this so seriously in the future, OK?
It just ain't worth the stomach acid...
