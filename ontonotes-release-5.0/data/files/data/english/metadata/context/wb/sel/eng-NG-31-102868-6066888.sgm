Went for a swift look to the river this morning. As we were turning the car from the bund spotted something unusual walking on the ground. Turned out to be a Northern Lapwing and looked like a first winter male. He walked around tamely and seemed a little lost. We were about to leave when we saw a dog approach him and nab him. We quickly shooed off the dog and discovered that the bird, while appearing perfectly healthy, was unable to fly as he had lost some feathers on one wing. Leaving him there would have meant certain death in a couple of hours at the most, so Nik has rescued him and taken him home. Any suggestions on what to feed him and how to care for him would be really welcome. Normally he would sift for invertebrates in muddy banks. Can these be substituted with hydrated freeze dried worms that are fed to fish or with worms used in wormiculture? If yes does anyone know where these worms are available?
Suggestions and advise are awaited
regards
Sheila

I googled it and wikipedia/ kenyabirds  answered that
their food is insects especially earthworms ( apart
from invertebrates).
Answers.com had an interesting aside, in cold weather
they may eat cattle dung!
Happy hunting/gathering Nik.

Good of Nik to save this bird and Sheila for all the
help.

Thank you Sir for your swift response. Does anyone have any idea from where
to get earthworms? I know that they are used to recycle garbage and food
waste and are available for wormiculture but does anyone have a contact
number for one hungry bird?
Thank you
Sheila

Here is the bird. I have put it in a warm place and put rice, dog food
and I dug up some earth from a nearby wetland. Hope it finds something
to eat.
Will also be trying the fish food. However need to know where I could
get some worms in Delhi

At the moment the bird is very active and alert, but can't even lift
himself 6 inches off the ground.

wormiculture?
.
This is a common agriculture practice now.
You may get thousands of EWs in a few kg of wormiculture compost.
So look out for an advanced agriculturist and he will let you know.
Here I am myself doing wormiculture compost and we may supply you not only
thousands but Lacs of earthworms at a go.
But unfortunately, I am 200 km from Delhi.
Do try locally and you will get.
With all good wishes,

Difficult to be sure from these pics but it looks as though the flight
feathers are regrowing and have been for some time. This would suggest they
were pulled out by someone after the Lapwing arrived here. This happened to
a couple of Marsh Harriers at Basai a few years ago (one, the famous Marsha
who was released after a year in recuperative captivity).

Is it a practice in India for people who want to keep larger wild birds as
pets (or future meals?) to pull out their flight feathers?

Hi,
All insectivores take to a mix of Sattu ( Gram flour ) and mince meat.
The best way to mix it is to use frozen mince meat (goat) and mix it
with gram flour. The moisture in the meat allows the flour to stick to
the meat and coat it and you will ideally have dry-moist (more dry than
moist) pellets at the end of this process. This usually works as a
staple and needs to be supplemented with live food. The positive is
that it can be easily made from easily available ingredients, the
negative is that we do not know how the Lapwing will repond to this
strange offering. No harm in trying, and while you are at it you may
later decide to add some garnish with powdered hard boiled eggs and a
touch of honey - don't laugh, I am dead serious having done this with
many pets birds in the, now distant, past. After all this will be an
acquired taste.......
Also, please don't let this mix go stale - an hour or two is the most
I'd leave it with the bird.
Regards,
Sumit

Great. Obviously worms are best food of all as they are natural. I recall
the fisherman on the Okhla village side of OBP collecting worms (bright red
ones) as bait. They were on the bunds north of Flamingo Point. I am sure you
could track a source down there. Don't forget to supply plenty of clean
water.  Cheers Bill

No problem of getting the worms as per our phone discussions.
The bird can get any amount of worms for years together at almost no cost.
Even then if there is any problem, do let me know.
With all good wishes for your bird,

&gt; .
&gt; This is a common agriculture practice now.
&gt; You may get thousands of EWs in a few kg of wormiculture compost.
&gt; So look out for an advanced agriculturist and he will let you know.
&gt; Here I am myself doing wormiculture compost and we may supply you not only
&gt; thousands but Lacs of earthworms at a go.
&gt; But unfortunately, I am 200 km from Delhi.
&gt; Do try locally and you will get.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Sir for your swift response. Does anyone have any idea from
&gt;&gt; where
&gt;&gt; to get earthworms? I know that they are used to recycle garbage and food
&gt;&gt; waste and are available for wormiculture but does anyone have a contact
&gt;&gt; number for one hungry bird?
&gt;&gt; Thank you

&gt;&gt;&gt; I googled it and wikipedia/ kenyabirds answered that
&gt;&gt;&gt; their food is insects especially earthworms ( apart
&gt;&gt;&gt; from invertebrates).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Answers.com had an interesting aside, in cold weather
&gt;&gt;&gt; they may eat cattle dung!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Happy hunting/gathering Nik.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good of Nik to save this bird and Sheila for all the
&gt;&gt;&gt; help.
