O.J. Simpson to be charged with robbery, assault, burglary
a.. NEW: Simpson to be charged with robbery, assault, burglary and conspiracy

b.. Alleged robbery involved sports-related items, police say

c.. Simpson arrested Sunday in his Las Vegas hotel room in the Palms Hotel

d.. Simpson has said he was merely retrieving items that were stolen from him
LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- O.J. Simpson will be charged with a total of six
counts of robbery, assault, burglary and conspiracy, Las Vegas police announced
Sunday.

Simpson was arrested at his hotel room at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas,
where he was staying to attend a friend's wedding, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police
Capt. James Dillon told reporters.

He was expected to be booked Sunday evening on two counts of robbery with a
deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count each of
armed burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary, Dillon said.

Simpson requested an attorney and was still at police headquarters late Sunday
afternoon, Dillon said.

On Saturday, Las Vegas police arrested Walter Alexander and seized two guns in
connection with the incident, a source told CNN earlier Sunday.

&quot;I don't know why they arrested him,&quot; Simpson told CNN before his own arrest.
&quot;I've stayed in contact with the police, and the truth will come out.&quot;

Simpson already had been questioned during the investigation into several items
of sports memorabilia that were taken from collectors in a room at the Palace
Station Hotel and Casino. Simpson has said the items belonged to him.

Alexander was arrested Saturday night and charged with two counts of robbery
with a deadly weapon, one count of conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly
weapon and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, the source said.

Alexander, a Nevada resident, was arrested on his way to McCarran International
Airport, the source said.

During searches Saturday, police recovered two guns they say were used in the
alleged robbery, the source said.

Simpson, 60, acknowledged that he entered a man's room with a group of friends,
one of whom was posing as a potential buyer, after being tipped off that some of
his personal items were for sale there.

Among the items were things he hadn't seen in years or that had been stolen, he
said. They included photographs of his family and himself as a child, and
photographs and negatives taken by his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson.

Simpson said friends helped him carry the items from the room, but no guns were
involved and the incident was not a robbery. Watch a report on the latest
developments in the probe »

On Saturday, Simpson said that he and one of the alleged victims, Alfred
Beardsley, spoke on the telephone with each other and agreed the incident had
been blown out of proportion.

Beardsley confirmed the conversation to celebrity Web site TMZ.com, saying
Simpson apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident. The other
alleged victim, Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector, said that two of
the men accompanying Simpson pointed guns at the other occupants of the room in
what he described as &quot;a home invasion-type robbery.&quot; Watch Fromong talk about
what happened

Fromong testified for Simpson's defense in the 1997 wrongful death trial
stemming from a lawsuit filed by the family of Ron Goldman, who was killed in
1994 alongside Simpson's ex-wife.

Simpson was acquitted of the murders in 1995, but the jury in the 1997 civil
trial found him liable and awarded the Goldmans $33.5 million for their son's
wrongful death.

Fromong testified that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially
since the 1995 verdict. His testimony was part of the defense's contention that
Simpson could not afford to pay the Goldmans. Also on Friday, Thomas Riccio, a
former business associate of Simpson, told KVVU television in Las Vegas that he
told Simpson about the sale.

Riccio said someone told him last month that he wanted to auction some of
Simpson's possessions by placing them on consignment. Riccio added that when he
called Simpson to tell him about the planned sale, the former athlete told him
the items had been stolen.

Riccio said that as he was being shown the items in the hotel room, Simpson
entered the room and seized the items. He said there was no break-in and no gun
was used.

Simpson's ex-wife and Goldman -- a waiter who had gone to her Los Angeles,
California, home to return a pair of glasses -- were fatally stabbed outside her
townhouse June 12, 1994. A jury found Simpson not guilty of the crimes.

Simpson recently wrote a book originally titled &quot;If I Did It&quot; and planned to
publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book
deal. A bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the Goldmans the rights to the
book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award.

They retitled the book &quot;If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer,&quot; which is in
bookstores.

Police: No bail for O.J. Simpson in Las Vegas robbery arrest

NEW: No bail for ex-NFL star accused of directing men in alleged armed robbery

Simpson faces charges of robbery, assault, burglary and conspiracy

Alleged robbery involved sports-related items, police say

Simpson arrested Sunday in Las Vegas, but he says items were his

LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Former football star O.J. Simpson will be held
without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges, police announced
late Sunday.

Simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed
robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a Las Vegas hotel room.

Las Vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe
Simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the Palace Station
Hotel and Casino.

Police said Simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the
memorabilia, including some that was unrelated to Simpson, police said.

&quot;We don't believe that anyone was roughed up, but there were firearms involved,&quot;
Lt. Clint Nichols told reporters.
Nichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims.

A reporter asked Nichols: Was &quot;O.J. was the boss in that room?&quot;

Nichols responded, &quot;That is what we believe, yes.&quot; Watch a report on the latest
developments in the probe »

The victims were identified as Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector who
described the incident as &quot;a home invasion-type robbery,&quot; and Alfred Beardsley,
who has been quoted by celebrity Web site TMZ.com as saying that Simpson later
apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident. Watch Fromong talk
about what happened

Acting on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport
with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona, who told them about the
alleged robbery and validated the tipster's information, Capt. James Dillon told
reporters.

Alexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly
weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery
and burglary with a deadly weapon.

He was released on his own recognizance and returned to Mesa either Saturday
night or early Sunday morning, Dillon said.
In addition, investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied
Simpson into the hotel room, Nichols said.
Nichols said, &quot;There is a social relationship between the individuals that we
identified and O.J. Simpson.&quot;

Though Simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself, two firearms
that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches.
Investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found.

Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police.

&quot;There is no truth to that whatsoever,&quot; he said. &quot;That came as a result of some
language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our
victims to believe that they may have been police.&quot;

Simpson, 60, has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him, but he has
denied that any weapons were involved.

&quot;Whether the property belonged to Mr. Simpson or not is still in debate,&quot;
Nichols said. &quot;We are still in the process of sorting that out.&quot;
Nichols also said that some of the property taken had Simpson's signature. But
&quot;there was some other property taken as well,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe there were
some Joe Montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff.&quot;

The latest charges against Simpson mean he faces the prospect of another
prosecution, more than a decade after the June 1994 stabbing deaths of his
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman.

Simpson was acquitted of murder the following year. The trial riveted much of
the United States.

But in 1997, a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by
the Goldman family. Simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $33.5
million for the deaths

Goldman went to Nicole Simpson's Los Angeles home to return a pair of glasses
the day of the slayings.

Goldman's sister, Kim Goldman, said she wasn't surprised by the robbery
allegations, since Simpson &quot;thinks he can do no wrong.&quot;
&quot;He's capable of stabbing people to death, so I think robbery is nothing
surprising,&quot; she said. &quot;Normal, logical, civil-minded, law-abiding people don't
storm a room with guns demanding stuff back.&quot;

Fromong had testified on Simpson's behalf in the civil case, telling the court
that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995
verdict. His testimony was part of the defense's contention that Simpson could
not afford to pay the Goldmans.

Simpson recently wrote a book originally titled &quot;If I Did It&quot; and had planned to
publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book
deal.

A bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the Goldmans the rights to the book in
light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award. The Goldmans
retitled the book, &quot;If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.&quot; That book just hit
bookstores.

&quot;Obviously, I'm sure everyone here is aware of the Goldmans' right to his
valuables,&quot; he said. &quot;We are still in the process of sorting that out and
determining if the properties that were taken were on the turnover agreement
that the courts issued in California. That is still in the process of being
worked out.&quot;

Riiiiight. And notwithstanding your state of delusion, where exactly
does it work like that? You ever called the cops and told them
where your &quot;stolen goods&quot; were? What, exactly, was their response?

Riiiiight, except the Cop's guns, the strong arm of the Law, and Jail for
anyone the cops drag in with their nets.

Gee, no, I never bother the cops at all.  I don't operate with such shady
characters as those who have stolen goods, either.  Please tell us about
your experiences, though.  I can tell they must be VERY interesting.  Got
your ass thrown in jail, did you?

Jonez refuses to acknowledge this.  He thinks someone who was acquitted

First of all, as Kent pointed out, I did not say this about OJ.

Second of all, a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict could mean any of the things I
stated above.  You'd understand this if you recognized the statement is
written using the disjunctive.  Why do you think repeating it endlessly
makes it less true?
