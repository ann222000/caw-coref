More on New Bedford Immig Raid

[Notice they're using helicopters to track down workers who fled the plant.
They have mothers of small children in custody -- and claim they'll release
those who have no one to leave them with. In other words, if there's an aunt
or cousin to watch them, Mom gets deported. This must be denounced
immediately! -Andy]

Activist: 90 people in custody after immigration raid in New Bedford

By Yvonne Abraham, Globe Staff

Federal immigration agents raided a New Bedford leather manufacturer
this morning and arrested the company's owner and three managers on
charges that they hired illegal workers to meet labor demands fueled by
millions of dollars in contracts with the US military.

About 90 other people had also been taken into custody by 9:30 a.m. as
part of the raid, said Corinn Williams, executive director of the
Community Economic Development Center in New Bedford, which has been
fielding calls from worried immigrants.

The number of arrests is expected to climb, she said, because the
waterfront factory, which has about 500 workers, employs mostly
immigrants from Guatemala and El Salvador. Williams said some employees,
most of them female, fled the factory when the raid began, and
helicopters hovered overhead to alert authorities of escape routes.

"A lot of the women working there left small children in child care
today," Williams said. "Members of the community are just devastated.
People are just in disbelief. They're hard-working people."

Michael Bianco Inc. makes handbags and leather goods, including military
backpacks and survival vests. Since 2003, it has received almost $100
millions in defense contracts, and its workforce has grown from 85 to
500, according to a federal indictment unsealed today.

The indictment accused the company's owner, Francesco Insolia, of having
knowingly and actively hired illegal immigrants to expand his workforce.
It alleged that not only did Insolia and his management staff knowingly
accept false documents, but that they also instructed illegal immigrants
on how to obtain fake documents. Others named in the criminal complaint
include Ana Figueroa, the company's payroll manager; Dilia Costa, the
plant manager; and office manager Gloria Melo.

The indictment also charged Luis Torres, a New Bedford music store
worker, with providing fake documentation to illegal immigrants.

The arrests followed a 10-month investigation by federal officials,
working with state and local law enforcement, in which undercover agents
used recording devices, according to the indictment.

Paula Grenier, Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman, declined
to confirm or provide details about the raid.

The arrests were made as Congress is preparing to grapple again with the
issue of comprehensive immigration reform and as the agency has stepped
up efforts to target employers who hire illegal immigrants.

"I question the timing on this," Williams said. "We're on the eve of
another introduction of comprehensive immigration reform. My hope is
that many people will have the opportunity to normalize their status.
This is going to drive people back into the shadows and make them much
more vulnerable."

Williams said she has received assurances that the women who have
children with no one else to care for them would be released today. The
others will be put into deportation proceedings, she was told.
