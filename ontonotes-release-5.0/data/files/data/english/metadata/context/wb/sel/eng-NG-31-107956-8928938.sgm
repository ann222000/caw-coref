You post received 6:15 pm.   I posted about including only &quot;contemporary&quot;
world leaders prior to that, although it may not show up as such due to some
glitch with my ISP.

Contemporary world leaders only........although yours was certainly a valid
response to my original question.

I thought Tom would come up with it first though.  ;-)

Once had a listing on a boat that belonged to the Sultan of Brunei.
He had boats scattered all over the world. This one was an opulently
equipped 40-some footer complete with claustrophobic (!) crew quarters
entered through a hatch at the transom. His main boat was a megayacht
that he used through the Med and elsewhere- scandalizing everybody in
the process. The name on the transom of his megayacht?
&quot;Tits&quot;

(activate sense of humor here- note tongue planted firmly in cheek)
Now if this were a political group I'd have to take issue with JimH's
nomination of GWB as a pleasure boater. In fact there's an active
website dedicated to &quot;setting the record straight&quot; about GWB's
possibly exaggerated claims of heroic accomplishments while pleasure
boating. (He may not have actually deserved all those purple noses).
It's called &quot;Pleasure Boat Captains For The Truth&quot;. :-)

Former British Prime Minister, Edward Heath.

From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Heath

He bought his first yacht Morning Cloud in 1969 and won the Sydney to
Hobart race that year. He captained Britain's winning team for the
Admiral's Cup in 1971 — while Prime Minister — and also captained the
team in the 1979 Fastnet race.

Also from Wikipedia, Sequoia, the former presidential yacht:

The Sequoia was purchased in 1931 by the United States Department of
Commerce, for Prohibition patrol and decoy duties. Herbert Hoover, an
avid angler, had decommissioned the presidential yacht the USS
Mayflower in 1929 as an economy measure, and borrowed the Sequoia from
the Commerce Department as an unofficial yacht during the last two
years of his Presidency.

In 1933, it was transferred to the Navy, serving officially as the
presidential yacht for three years, until replaced by the Potomac.
From 1936 through 1969 the Sequoia then became the yacht of the
Secretary of the Navy. During this period the Sequoia was used by
presidents and other high-ranking government officials. From 1969
through 1977 the yacht was dual-use for the Navy and Executive branch
officials including the president.

At Jimmy Carter's direction, the U.S. government sold it at auction in
1977 for $270,000, as a symbolic cutback.

Notable events aboard the Sequoia include:

Herbert Hoover sailed her to Florida.
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower planned European war
strategy (but this may have been aboard Potomac).
Harry S. Truman decided to bomb Hiroshima.
Dwight Eisenhower loaned her to Queen Elizabeth II during her state
visit to the U.S.
John F. Kennedy held strategy meetings during the Cuban Missile
Crisis.
Richard M. Nixon negotiated the SALT I arms treaty with Leonid
Brezhnev and Anatoly Dobrynin, and later made the decision to resign
the presidency.
Gerald R. Ford conducted cabinet meetings.
Ronald W. Reagan met all 50 state governors at the gangplank.
George H.W. Bush met with Chinese premier Li Peng.

John Paul II was a kayaker; he paddled a Klepper:  tinyurl.com/ypz9by

&quot;Father Karol Wojtyla is pictured reading in a kayak in 1955. Three years
later during a kayaking trip, he was called to Warsaw for the announcement
that he was to be made a bishop. In 1978, then-Cardinal Wojtyla was elected
pope and took the name John Paul II.&quot;
