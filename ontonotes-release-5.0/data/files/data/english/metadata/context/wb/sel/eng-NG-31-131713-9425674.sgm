&gt; Trek Score Will Keep Theme

&gt; Michael Giacchino, who is set to compose the score for J.J. Abrams'
&gt; upcoming Star Trek movie, told SCI FI Wire that he will retain at
&gt; least the original theme music from the original series, by Alexander
&gt; Courage.

&gt; &quot;I think that the thing to do would be to hold on to the only thing
&gt; that does speak-that says Star Trek-universally, which is the [opening
&gt; theme from the original series],&quot; Giacchino said in an interview while
&gt; promoting the upcoming release of Ratatouille on DVD, for which he
&gt; also composed the music.

&gt; Giacchino also revealed a few details about the top-secret film's plot
&gt; and how the theme music fits in. &quot;To me, that fanfare, boom, that says
&gt; it all right there,&quot; he said. &quot;And this film is about everything that
&gt; came before that. So, yes, I want to keep that. But everything that
&gt; was done after that, it shouldn't be about that. It needs to be about
&gt; these characters now and how they met and all of these things. So it's
&gt; a very kind of specific place and time.&quot;

&gt; Giacchino has worked with Star Trek director Abrams on the television
&gt; series Alias and continues to compose music for Abrams' ABC series
&gt; Lost. He said that his approach to the Star Trek score will be guided
&gt; by Abrams' vision for the film.

&gt; &quot;I love working with J.J., and I know that he'll make it something
&gt; special, so I have no doubt that there'll be something there that'll
&gt; inspire me,&quot; Giacchino said. &quot;I don't know what it's going to be, so I
&gt; still have that anticipation about it.&quot;

&gt; But Giacchino admitted that he is daunted by the prospect of following
&gt; in the footsteps of such Trek film composers as James Horner and Jerry
&gt; Goldsmith.

&gt; &quot;I grew up listening to all of that great [Trek] music, and that's
&gt; part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing,&quot; Giacchino said. &quot;So,
&gt; yeah, it's horrifying to think that I've got to go and stand in line
&gt; with those guys.&quot; He added: &quot;You just go in scared. You just hope you
&gt; do your best. It's one of those things where the film will tell me
&gt; what to do.&quot; Star Trek is scheduled for release on Dec. 25, 2008.

Just as long as it doesn't have anything to do with that insipid theme
music for the Star Trek TV series of the first adventures of the
Enterprise.  God...that's awful stuff!  Good series...but the insipid
opening theme is dreadful.  I'm more a fan of Horner's vision of Star
Trek...what with the nautical leanings of his themes...wonderful!

Um.... Mr. Blowhard?  I believe THAT is just what the article was
about, using the Alexander Courage original theme... which I find much
more appealing than the ubiquitous Goldsmith theme that has been
pommeled into skulls over the years.... so there.

I don't remember Horner's music other than I had the LP at one time
and that it was rather Korngoldish.

Of course with this 'Lost' composer at the helm, the score could end
up being a few plinkety plinks throughout.... (heh).

To think that Star Trek is now tantamount to Dracula.  No matter how
many stakes have been driven through the heart, it keeps rising from
the dead.

I hope in re-using the original theme we have a chance to return to
the historically informed scoring - including soaring soprano line and
bongos!

I believe they eventually dropped the bongs by the second year, or my

I'm not a fan of JJ Abrams, so I'm not holding my breath on that
point.

And if what I've heard about their intent to completely toss aside all
of
the established Trek continuity turns out to be true, well -- the hell

it.

It annoys me that we're getting more Trek, but Firefly is apparently

Well... Firefly was excellent and will always remain so... the irony
is, in the face of what exists today on television, this show could
soar....

But it has to go down in history as one of the most botched projects
either for TV or the big screen... since Serenity was a damn good film
as well.

As far as Star Trek continuity is concerned... well... they could just
start up a whole new sci-fi franchise and do what they want, but the
words STAR TREK have their obvious draw.  So in a way it is a cheat.

Saint Roger Ebert even wrote in his review of Serenity that it was (I
paraphrase here) a worthy successor to the Star Wars franchise... but
it didn't happen.

Drat.

You're absolutely right about the theme being re-scored. It was
subject to several revisions in the first season, and reached a
codified form for the 2nd and 3rd.

Still, one has to regret that the lyric fashioned for the piece was
never given wide play:

Be-yond -
the rim of the star-light...
My love -
Is wandering in star flight...
I know -
he'll find in star-clustered reaches -
Love,
Strange love, a star woman teaches.
I know -
his journey ends never.
His Star Trek
will go on forever.
But tell him -
when he wanders his starry sea -
Remember, remember me.

The author of this blather? Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry.
Although it's doggerel of the worst sort, it does point to several
ongoing concerns of the series -

&quot;Strange love a Star Woman teaches...&quot;

This certainly points to the presence of Captain Kirk as the prime
space nuggie hunter of all time, evidently a preoccupation issuing
forth from GR.

&quot;His Star Trek wil go on forever...&quot;

Like the opening statement &quot;five-year mission,&quot; GR was evidently
attempting to build a certain longevity into the project. Sadly, this
did not occur during the NBC first run, but succeeded wildly in terms
of long-term interest in the property.

&quot;Remember, Remember me.&quot;

Not that he went to the Hitchcockian extent of including his own image
in his product, but Roddenberry was certainly fairly aggressive about
getting his name out there and associated with &quot;Star Trek,&quot; and again,
succeeded to a surprising degree.

Wrong on all counts, oh fruit sounder!

First, Serenity is the name of the motuion picture made from the
SERIES Firefly.

Second, there was plenty of buzz on the Internet about the show (am I
the *only* person who watches the bells &amp; whistles on DVDs and listens
to teh commentaries?)... it's just that Fox didn't allow the two hour
pilot to be aired at the beginning then bumped the show around so no
one could find it.

Third, Pee-Wee HERMAN is the name you are looking for.

Bean counters have always ruled the world.  Read Barbara Paul's KILL
FEE... a riotously smart crime/mystery novel about a freelance hit
man... and at the beginning there's a scathing account of a small
publisher that released wonderful books but made little money until he
hired a partner who increased sales at the expense of those wonderful
books, publishing only popular dreck that made the big bucks.

Guess who gets murdered?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;I grew up listening to all of that great [Trek] music, and that's

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yeah, it's horrifying to think that I've got to go and stand in line
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with those guys.&quot; He added: &quot;You just go in scared. You just hope you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; do your best. It's one of those things where the film will tell me
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what to do.&quot; Star Trek is scheduled for release on Dec. 25, 2008.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Just as long as it doesn't have anything to do with that insipid theme
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;music for the Star Trek TV series of the first adventures of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Enterprise.  God...that's awful stuff!  Good series...but the insipid
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;opening theme is dreadful.  I'm more a fan of Horner's vision of Star
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Trek...what with the nautical leanings of his themes...wonderful!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Jon E. Szostak, Sr.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Um.... Mr. Blowhard?  I believe THAT is just what the article was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about, using the Alexander Courage original theme... which I find much
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more appealing than the ubiquitous Goldsmith theme that has been
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pommeled into skulls over the years.... so there.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't remember Horner's music other than I had the LP at one time
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and that it was rather Korngoldish.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course with this 'Lost' composer at the helm, the score could end
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; up being a few plinkety plinks throughout.... (heh).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To think that Star Trek is now tantamount to Dracula.  No matter how
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; many stakes have been driven through the heart, it keeps rising from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the dead.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What do you mean...&quot;so there&quot;?  I clearly stated that I preferred
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Horner's themes to any others.  I think an early vision of Kirk and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;crew is a valid one...Dracula not withstanding.  Just hope it's well
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;scripted.

Dear Blushing Root:  I stand corrected...I was listening to some Jazz
in the background and a clarinet was playing so I unconsciously wrote
'Russell' instead of 'Herman'...mea Culpa! Mea maxima Culpa!  But you
got the idea anyway...so that's all that counts.

There may have been plenty of buzz on the internet about
'Firefly'...but that's where I made a huge mistake.  That was the
reason given by Sci-Fi network execs regarding their cancellation of
one of this family's favorite series...to wit 'Dresden Files'.  A show
dealing with a modern magician/sorcerer...which had wonderful story
lines and wonderful effects and...as I recall...a good musical score.

So I reduce my very loud fruit-sound to a gentler 'Razzberries'.  Hope
that eases your green frond-topped dome.

a friend sent me a few eps to watch (I ALWAYS watch things sent to me)

I no longer read novels...only PC magazines and technical articles.  I
started reading a ridculously early age...and had read most of the
classics before I was out of 6th grade...including Shakespeare.  I
wouldn't begin to assume who is murdered in that novel...but I guess I
never will know.

I tried watching 'Torchwood' but wasn't horibbly impressed either.  As
for Dr. Strange...that was one of my favorite Marvel comics...along
with Thor and the Sub-Mariner.  It's a pity that they don't have a
serious attempt at Dr. Strange though...great potential all
around...stories...music...SFX.  What's the problem Sci-Fi Channel????

While I'm at it...the ads for the new 'Beowulf' movie leave me cold.
In one scene the main actore screams...&quot;I AM BEOWULF!&quot;  Unfortunately
he yells it exactly as the guy in '300' yelled...&quot;THIS IS SPARTA!&quot;
That's a poor decision on the director's part...and is an obvious
ripoff of that other actors scene.  I mean...there are a number of
ways to say that which are far more effective than screaming like some
other movie.  Most disappointing...since I had planned to see it.  No
way in Hell now!  Think I'll watch my DVD of 'Big Country' again...or

Beowulf has no actors.... it's another CGI experiment along the lines
of The Polar Express... so don't fret about lines.

Dr. Strange was made into a TV movie in the late 70s... but I never

have no respect for his own work/creations as long as he's paid
enough.  I read the writers behind the Fantastic Four films/disasters

One wonders what a remake of The Big Country would be?  Does Heston

Tyler Bates is the composer who penned the score to 300. Apparently
he was so hamstrung by the producers' insistence that he ape the temp
track that the resulting score sounded sufficiently like the work of
the
composers on the temp track (Goldenthal's &quot;Titus&quot;, frex) that there
was
some legal stuff that resulted in disclaimers being added to the
album.

As for &quot;no actors&quot;, there are actors, actually -- it's &quot;motion
capture&quot;,
not completely computer-generated images, and of course there's
voice work.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;ripoff of that other actors scene.  I mean...there are a number of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;ways to say that which are far more effective than screaming like some
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;other movie.  Most disappointing...since I had planned to see it.  No
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;way in Hell now!  Think I'll watch my DVD of 'Big Country' again...or
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;just wait until my Carlos Saura Flamenco trilogy DVD box set arrives.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Beowulf has no actors.... it's another CGI experiment along the lines
&gt;&gt; &gt; of The Polar Express... so don't fret about lines.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Dr. Strange was made into a TV movie in the late 70s... but I never
&gt;&gt; &gt; saw it.  Typically they changed the existig mythos.  Stan Lee seems to
&gt;&gt; &gt; have no respect for his own work/creations as long as he's paid
&gt;&gt; &gt; enough.  I read the writers behind the Fantastic Four films/disasters
&gt;&gt; &gt; were GREAT fans of the orginal comics but evidently not fans enough to
&gt;&gt; &gt; screw over the years of existing continuity.

&gt;&gt; &gt; One wonders what a remake of The Big Country would be?  Does Heston
&gt;&gt; &gt; still look good wearing just long johns?  I suspect there would no
&gt;&gt; &gt; longer be horses... possibly hoards of corgis?

&gt;&gt; &gt; PS.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Noticed that the 300 jewel case at stores now has a sticker announcing
&gt;&gt; &gt; a web site to explain the true authorship of the music in the film.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Wow.  Poor Tyler Bates... probably wonders how Horner always gets away

&gt;&gt; NO ACTORS!!!  Well then...can you please explain to this old theater/
&gt;&gt; film person just how the spoken dialogue/lines come to be heard?
&gt;&gt; Someone's got to say the lines...or there's no film dialogue!  So
&gt;&gt; there ARE actors after all methinks.

&gt;&gt; Hoards of Corgis and a Beagle or two thrown in for the fun of it all.
&gt;&gt; And didn't Charles Heston die not too long ago?  And who is Tyler
&gt;&gt; Bates?

&gt;Tyler Bates is the composer who penned the score to 300. Apparently
&gt;he was so hamstrung by the producers' insistence that he ape the temp
&gt;track that the resulting score sounded sufficiently like the work of
&gt;the
&gt;composers on the temp track (Goldenthal's &quot;Titus&quot;, frex) that there
&gt;was
&gt;some legal stuff that resulted in disclaimers being added to the
&gt;album.

&gt;As for &quot;no actors&quot;, there are actors, actually -- it's &quot;motion
&gt;capture&quot;,
&gt;not completely computer-generated images, and of course there's
&gt;voice work.
">

Yeah.  That.

But from my POV, this Beowulf looks just as ugly and is just as poorly
conceived as that Polar Express film which tanked.  It is done by the
same director who evidently is a successful hypnotist in order to get
such a production bankrolled.

I'd sooner see the director of Sky Captian &amp; the World of Tomorrow
resurface with another visually remarkable and seamless CGI effort.
Imagination is so hard to come by in Hollywood...

The score for 300 was rather a successful seller... I wonder how much
of the profit went to Goldenthal (and his lawyers)?  I also wonder of
this set James Horner back a few notches, drumming his fingers
pensively about his next assignment (unless he rips himself off again,
then he would only have to worry about being sued by himself)

Of course I know it a 'motion capture' process...but just who the hell
do y'all think they're capturing?  And voice work...to me means an

I'm thoroughly confused by the Blushing Root's insistence that there
are no actors in the film.  Apparently Heston is still alive...I was
confused about that.  Isn't Tyler Bates supposed to compose the music
the remake of 'Big Country'?

Hi Jon.  The only real actors in the film ARE the voices, and a list

However, the entire film is indeed CG.  The explanation here....

To defend veggie mentality: Puppet shows in my universe do not have
actors, they have puppets... but there &quot;are&quot; real people pulling the
strings.  The same can be said for these dopey CGI-Animated people
films... then again... a whole lot of Snow White was rotoscoped
(animated over action film) as was Racheal for a few frames in Blade
Runner.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm thoroughly confused by the Blushing Root's insistence that there
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are no actors in the film.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Jon.  The only real actors in the film ARE the voices, and a list
&gt; &gt;&gt; of who's who can be found at...

&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933

&gt; &gt;&gt; However, the entire film is indeed CG.  The explanation here....

&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933/faq

&gt; &gt;&gt; P.S.  I think the commercials look fascinating!

&gt; &gt;C-Jo:  Well thanks for someone finally agreeing with me...there ARE
&gt; &gt;actors in the film after all is said and done.  I'm thinking of making
&gt; &gt;a nice, hot pot of veggie soup!  Razzberries for dessert.

&gt; &gt;And...yes...the commercials do look fascinating...save for the line of
&gt; &gt;&quot;I AM BEOWULF!&quot; screamed exactly the same as the actor in 300 who
&gt; &gt;screamed &quot;THIS IS SPARTA!'.  I'll still go see it.

&gt; To defend veggie mentality: Puppet shows in my universe do not have
&gt; actors, they have puppets... but there &quot;are&quot; real people pulling the
&gt; strings.  The same can be said for these dopey CGI-Animated people
&gt; films... then again... a whole lot of Snow White was rotoscoped
&gt; (animated over action film) as was Racheal for a few frames in Blade
&gt; Runner.

&gt; And I do not for a moment believe that (1) we are argueing over this ,
&gt; and (2) C-jo is agreeing with you (unless she owes you money) and (3)
&gt; &quot;Luke, I am your father!&quot;- Hide quoted text -

There's a great Gilmore Girl's ep. that is bookended by The

Well,  I like Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End &amp; Rendevous With Rama
better as stories... never understood the film... even when I was in
high school... and what does this have to do with Star Trek, The
