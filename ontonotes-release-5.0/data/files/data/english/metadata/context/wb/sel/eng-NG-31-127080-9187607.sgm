Here's an interesting report concerning early morning whole barley and
insulin and glucose response through out the day.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070905095324.htm

What's interesting is that the purposed mechanism is not just from
delayed glucose absorbtion, but the conversion of fiber by gut
bacteria to butyrate. The butyrate, when absorbed, has all sorts of
positve benefits.

There lots of coaborating evidence such as:

http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/8/831

This also fits in well with the study of Japanese prisoners feed a
high barley diet reported a few weeks ago to the group.

Some might ask why not just have a low carb, high protein breakfast
thereby avoiding the much dietary glucose.
As far as avoiding dietary glucose this reasoning is correct, but your
still straining your poor worn out beta cells to pump out insulin.
This is especially true for beef and diary products contain whey. If
you really want to beat up your pancreas low carb whey shake.

Does barley have gluten?  I wouldn't mind having a bit of bread in the
morning, but I'd need some gluten to puff it up a bit.  I'm tired of
hockey-puck bread.  (That's how mine usually turns out.)

Interesting that you should post this today. I, like many diabetics, am very
carb sensitive in the mornings. 10 gr of carbs is my absolute limit.

This morning I slept in and didn't have time to do my usual sort of
breakfast as I had an early and very important appt. So I tossed some
leftover chicken stew I made the kids last night into the microwave. It had
chicken, celery, onion and garlic (all foods I can tolerate at breakfast
normally) and about 1/4 cup cooked barley. I had a massive bg rise about
half an hour later and one of the worst reactive hypoglycemic episodes while
driving a little while later.

Luckily I was at the point of stopping at a small shop so my son could buy
himself some breakfast. He got me a juice. I have felt bad all day.

I have had a rye cracker often for breakfasts on the run, about 8 gr carb in
the cracker spread with mayo and cold hard boiled egg slices. No problems. I
have never eaten barley for breakfast before and I was shocked at the result
because I eat barley often, with an evening meal. It may well work for
someone with no glucose problems but I have to say it was a big breakfast
loser for me personally. Right up there with oatmeal at breakfast - which
produces the same result.

Sorry to hear of the hyper and hypo - but I'm not surprised.

I make a vege soup (see the recipe in the blog) with about
three tablespoons of barley in the big pot which makes ten
serves. I found, by experimentation in the past, if I
increase that portion of barley to five tablespoons spread
across the five serves, it raises my BG's an extra full
mmol(18mg/dl) after lunch if the only food eaten is the bowl
of soup.

Didn't the original article talk about whole barley?  I don't know what you
can get there but here in the states, I've seen only pearl barley. It's had
the hulls &quot;polished&quot; off. I'm betting this makes a big difference.

I can tolerate only limited portions of barley in this form..... and I used
to like it a lot.

Good point. I do use pearl barley.

I was trying to get to the original paper, but it needed
payment.

I use un-hulled. I buy any whole grains, unprocessed bran etc from health
food stores. Supermarkets are a different kettle of fish. You pay more for
health food items but usually worth it. I buy nuts from a hot nut bar that
has a large turnover and freeze them straight away. Only buy enough to last
a week anyway.

G'day G'day Chak,

Barley flour is almost totally gluten free. When I was into
experimenting with making bread mixes I tried adding barley flour.
Even one eight barley flour led to pretty solid bread. Nice flavour
though.

Love the hockey-puck bread description.  Quite apt IMHO.

Best wishes,

Do you have a reference for the above.
All sources I've seen indicate that barley is loaded with gluten.

Barley *is* loaded with gluten.  It must be avoided if you are on a gluten
free diet.
