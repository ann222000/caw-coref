My dwarf pie cherry tree has died, perhaps from old age.  At least I
found no patent signs of injury or disease.  We removed it and dug out
the stump (no easy task on an older tree).

I want to put in a replacement, but not a dwarf.  The place we had the
old one is ideal.  Is there some reason I wouldn't put the replacement
there next spring, or something I should do to prepare the site?

These are good questions.  Most likely if you dug the stump out.  There may
be some woody roots that are left without and energy source.  They will be
predisposed to rot decay fungi.  As long as the tree is healthy, you are
planting, you plant correctly, mulch correctly, I would wait until the
second growing season before any stem pruning or fertilization,you should be
OK.  I guess some organic fertilizer would be fine.  Do root prune at
planting time to remove torn woody roots.  With a sharp tool and straight
across like the end of a straw.  Look up &quot;root pruning&quot; at pruning link
below.  Other than that -

I'd plant close but no exactly where the old one was. Remember it died.
I'd hate to see you lose another.

I lost two about a year apart, dwarf North Star.  I wasn't going to
replace them but missed them too much, waited about 3 years.  If a virus
killed them (they were about 30 years old), I was afraid to put new
trees near there, but not much sunny, open space in my smallish yard.

Somebody came around, and I paid to have the stumps dug out, but there
are still remains underneath that need to decay.

I wouldn't want anything but a dwarf.  They are good producers, at least
mine were, every year, more than I needed, didn't do a thing to them
ever except plant well, water and mulch the first year.  I bought two NS
at Home Depot early this spring and planted them a few feet away from
where the others had been, would have gone further if I had had more
space to work with.  Then the deep freeze killed all the buds, one was dead.

So I didn't want to lose a year, they had a warranty, so first made sure
they had something left, dug up and returned the NS and came home with 2
Montmorency.  I should have taken more care about the shape of them, but
not much to choose from that were close to the same and looked nice.
Then some bugs or some critter, possibly deer but never saw any in the
yard, ate a bunch of leaves off the one, never had any problem like that
with the NS's that I can remember.

So maybe next spring, I'll dig them out while they are still under
warranty unless they bud out too nicely and go back to NS and probably
bite the bullet and get some nicer ones from a nursery.  I saw some huge
NS's at Lowe's, but they were larger than I would have wanted to tackle.

Good luck.  You don't need a pair for cross pollination I guess, but I
liked having two.

I go along with your feelings on dwarf trees.  I don't know why anyone would
prefer a full size tree, especially on a small lot.  I had a North Star, which
was
supposed to be a dwarf, but grew to great size and took up a lot of space.  I
might
have kept it, but it never produced more than a handful of cherries every year,
so
I pulled it out.  Having two North Stars instead of one should help with the
pollination and result in more fruit, even though that tree is self fertile.  I
still have my Montmorency, which has consistently produced fruit for the last 15
years.

Maybe it was a freak or got mislabelled somewhere in the process.  Maybe
some do get large like those young 'uns I saw at Lowe's.

Seems mine grew to no more than 7' tall and 5' wide and stayed like that
for many years.

They told me at the nursery where I bought the NS's that it required two
to cross pollinate.  Now I've read that is not true.  Anyway, your
satisfaction with the Montmorency is encouraging, and I hope mine will
do well.

I so wish I had room for a couple dwarf apricot trees.  I have what I
thought was supposed to be a dwarf Moorpark, and late frosts almost
always kill the fruit, once they got wormy, and about 3 years ago loaded
with gorgeous apricots (somebody stole all the low ones I was watching
until they were just right to pick).  It looks like a standard to me.
It's a crooked old thing now (because it had to stretch out to get to
the sun), I think I will give it one more year.  I read Sungold or
Moongold are more hardy, but I could only have one.

Haven't seen any around for a long time, but when I first moved here,
two neighbors had some standards that bore tons of smaller fruit without
fail every year, messy, but delicious.

Nobody bothers much with fruit trees any more.  Why don't more people
want fruit trees?  New luxury homes have sprung up all around, but they
seem to want yards that are professionally landscaped.  They all look
kind of blah to me, same old, same old.  Some of it is practical.  Low
maintenance.  Reliable in our climate.

I have Montmorency's, as I think they make the best pies, and I don't
have room in the front yard for two trees.

I too have a very small yard, so the place where the old one died is
about the only place to put a new one without removing something else.
Our dwarf Montmorency in the back yard was not affected, which inclines
me to think the cause of death was not a virus.

I'm looking at the non dwarf variety, as they say it will be 15 to 20
feet tall, which will nicely shade the porch, and let the birds eat the
fruit at the top, while we enjoy the lower fruit.  I have a non-dwarf
Stella in the back, which has done quite well, although it had mold on
the fruit a couple of years ago, which I attribute to inadequate
pruning.  My good luck with the non-dwarf Stella is inclining me to try
a non-dwarf Montmorency.

I have heard that, too, so hope mine will be ok.  When I made pies with
the NS's, I diluted the juice with water a little because they have high
acid, and everybody loved them.  They freeze well and easily and keep
longer than most people keep frozen stuff.

I would think mine was due to one having been damaged by a teen going
rambunctious, then getting scraped with the mower (it had a bole-like
scar growth at the ground level).  But when the other went that wasn't
like it, it was either a virus or they had just reached the end of their
life cycle.

Now that you explain your needs and desires, if that is what you want,
it should be fine.  The shade factor is important, much as I love my
trees, I am paying for not having enough sunny spots for my flowers.
One must choose.  I didn't think of some of that when I planted many
years ago.  So you deal with what is.

Go with the standard and be happy with it.  It will look pretty at
blossoming and fruiting time.  Bet you wish you had more room, too, but
again we have to deal with what is or get a bigger place which is not a
good option for many of us.

And you may get occasional people asking if they can have some like I
did :-).  I had plenty to share because I really didn't NEED that many,
just enjoy watching them do their thing and a few pies to look forward to.
