No, but you can fertilize it.

Stupid article.  You couldn't give me anodized alum cookware.  It's
gimmicky crap.  OTOH, the Bush administration and the RIAA has been
totally unsuccessful in banning fetishizing.

My apologies.  I meant to say "absurdly overpriced gimmicky crap".
Whew!  I'm glad we cleared that up.  ;)

It's not just cookware that this religous zeal the article's author speaks
of applies to. It applies equally well to houses, cars, home electronics,
etc. Worship of material goods. What would happen if America decided to stop
worshipping this god? It's the basis of our whole economy! ;-)

I do have my share of All Clad LTD, Le Creuset, and other high end cookware.
But I also have a fair collection of kitchen items (cookware included)
bought at thrift shops and on ebay. In fact, tonight's dinner of beef fondue
will be made in a fondue set where the burner came from Habitat for Humanity
and the pot from ebay. A matching set from the same manufacturer even! Nice
Stockli (Swiss made) copper. Some bride in the 1960s must have been proud...
but she never used the set.
