'See? No warming' (wink)

By John Young
Created Jan 20 2007 - 9:22am

Texans are shocked. Per that third-grade science lesson (now surely in
preschool, followed by a standardized test): At 32 degrees and below, water
becomes solid and slippery.

This is happening across much of our state. Texans are shocked. But some are
reassured. No global warming! We just got the first "global warming fear
mongers" e-mail of the season from a local reader.

"It's 29 degrees as I write this . . ." It reads.

I'm sorry to inform the reader, but: His foamy reaction to a modest
mid-January temperature dip, like the pale-with-shock faces of his fellow
Texans, actually serves as a barometer that climate change is real. Clearly
they have forgotten what cold feels like.

This part of Texas barely has had winter by the standard definition this
century. So, yeah, we freak out when water congeals.

Central Texans used to cover vents and hunker down for at least two months
of real winter, January and February. Now they hunker down for 48 hours. The
Bermuda shorts are barely wrinkled when redeployed.

It fits too well into what climatologists are saying. Last year was the
warmest in recorded history. But, hey, it was 29 and icy here yesterday. So,
it's all a myth.

That's certainly what ExxonMobil wants you to believe. The Union of
Concerned Scientists recently issued a report that the oil giant gave $16
million to 43 ideological groups between 1998 and 2005 to discredit the
science behind global warming.

Does that include donations to Bush-Cheney?

ExxonMobil may have a tough time picking horses for the next go-around,
certainly if John McCain gets the GOP nomination. Global warming, he says,
"is serious and it's real."

Speaking of Team Bush, which often calls for "good science," then looks the
other way:

The Associated Press reports that the Bush administration is clamping down
on what scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey write and say, screening
"all facts and interpretations by agency scientists who study everything
from caribou mating to global warming."

The rules state that USGS's communications office must be "alerted about
information products containing high-visibility topics or topics of a
policy-sensitive nature."

That's how information is done in the age of plausible deniability. Global
warming? Pshaw. If you can recall, the insurgency in Iraq was in cool-down
phase as well. So said the vice president.

The Persians are masters at rugs. Americans, apparently, are masters at
corporate-style damage control and spin.

Rob Gelbspan, in his book The Heat Is On, tells of the
industry-within-an-industry of denying and obfuscating climate data that
alarms scientists and endangers polar bears.

Go to a climate conference and you will see the corporate hired guns who've
jetted in to offer the "other side" on the data.

They've been very effective thus far -- hence the continued stall on
treating carbon dioxide as a pollutant or a greenhouse gas. Hence so little
action on automobile fuel economy, on alternative energy, on energy
conservation.

What also gets ignored

What's outrageous is that whether or not you want to believe man-emitted
gases are causing the world to overheat, so many other dangers can't be
denied:

Our dependence on foreign oil. The effects of ozone and particulates. The
crushing costs of electricity and gasoline, which could be blunted through
an urgent national effort aimed at conserving.

The masterful high-dollar effort to cast doubt on global warming has
succeeded not only in blocking action on greenhouse gases but in blunting
all sorts of important steps in changing our approach to energy and air
pollution.

I'm not an expert on climate change. I do know what my skin tells me and
what too-early buds on the ash in my front yard say about a season that once
was winter.

Anymore in Central Texas, we have just three seasons and one long weekend
when it gets really cold. You explain it to me.
