...new monitors last only about 5 years.  Has anyone found this to be
the case, or is this just pure BS?

Depends on manufacture and size. My experience has been that most
monitors larger then 25&quot; isnt going to have a very nice picture in a
few years time. Also, some of the Korean manufactured monitors are
junk from the get go. Older monitors in these games do seem to last a
lot longer then their new cousins.

Probably true if the game is left on 8 - 12 hours a day, every day. For
home use, not so much an issue. I've put a lot of new Eygo and Sharp
Image monitors in games for my operator buddy and they've been out in
service for about 5 years now. Most were 19's but one was a 31&quot; for a
HOTD and it's still going strong.... as far as I know :)

The problem with old monitors is the burn in and washed out colors. Even
if you put a new chassis in and rejuvenate the tube it's still not going
to be as sharp and bright as a new one. Just my .02.

Cliffy brings up a good point. I'm always coming at this from the
business end of things and not the hobbyist end. A new monitor will
last years before you have any problems with it. With that you get a
nice sharp picture too.

my guess is that if this game had a new monitor, the description would
read the same but the words &quot;new&quot; and &quot;recently serviced&quot; would trade
places :)
