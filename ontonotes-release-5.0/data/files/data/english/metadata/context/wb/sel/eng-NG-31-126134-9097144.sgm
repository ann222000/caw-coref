I listened to the new Fiddy on the way to work this morning.  Felt the

Childish, eh? I'm sure 50 will take that.  50 Cent is worth over 100

I say I have more to learn from 50 or Jay-Z than most rappers out

Like 50 Cent vs. Immortal Technique....50 probably offers more value.

I'm not sure about the Kanye.  Production wise is good, but I still

I was looking forward to the 50 cent cd.  But when I heard the advance
I was kinda bored with it.  The only song I kinda liked was with Mary
J. Blige &quot;All of Me&quot;.  There were some alright beats and all but the
lyrics just put me off.  Those lovey-dovey lyrics just sounded corny.
A Half thug and half romance album just doesn't mesh well.  2pac
pulled it off on &quot;Me Against the World&quot; but this one just didn't sit
right.

Hype will only ensure 1st week sales it's a good product that will
ensure it to multi-platinum status.  But I'm sure there's enough loyal
50 fans to make this hit double platinum.

Kanye's cd on the other hand, I don't know what to make of.  It'll
take me a couple of listens to really get into the album.

Lang Whitaker from slamonline.com wrote a bit about it and I pretty
much agree with what he says.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------
http://slamonline.com/online/2007/09/links-random-notes-2/

I’ve been listening to the forthcoming Kanye album a lot the last few
days, and I like it. It’s not a great album, but it’s good, definitely
worth owning. The problem is, Kanye doesn’t really have much to say.
The album is called The Good Life, and pretty much every song is about
how good Kanye’s life is. Fun!

What Kanye definitely is, however, is two things: A great producer and
a really clever writer. The beats all instantly feel familiar,
probably because most of them sample old songs that you’ll probably at
least partially recognize. Lyrically, Kanye’s album is pretty much a
really long blog post. Since he doesn’t have anything to say, he just
drops about a million references to people in pop culture, from Kate
Moss to Lawry’s seasoning salt to Rosie Perez to Blackstreet to Will
Smith to Lauryn Hill to Barry Bonds.

Peace!

Yes. I've heard he's complaining that the label didn't &quot;set up&quot; the
album properly. Childish. With fools taking anything they can get by way
of rappers like him and Jigga-boo, I'm sure he is worth what you say.
That doesn't make him a dope lyricist and for you to even equate the
money to his lyrical ability shows where your head's at. At any rate,
Immortal Technique is a better MC all day, everyday. The comedic value
is from Curtis with the ass-backward quotes being passed off as

Don't give IT the compliment of calling him a political rapper.  Have
you heard his lyrics?  On top of god awful delivery, he makes fucking
Brother J sound like Bill DuBois.  His lyrics are nothing more than a
string of contradictory conspiracy theories and pedestrian race
baiting.  I've only heard like three songs and it was enough.  In four
minutes flat he claimed to not believe in black or white, to talking

Please. Read and profit from history. Jigga-boo rode the wave of the
empty void left behind Biggie and Tupac passing. Everyone knows that in
1996, NO ONE was even talking about Jigga-boo. 50 Cent is no lyricist,
and EVERYONE knows that. So, I don't see where the &quot;dope lyrics&quot; made
them successful. Their &quot;success&quot; has more to do with the herd mentality
and corporate influence than it does with lyricism.

&lt;&lt;Talk about missing the point.&gt;&gt;

Agreed....your statement below is proof positive of that. It's rather
sad, too.

&lt;&lt;Let me put it this way. I'd rather be where Fiddy or Jigga-Boo are in

The sad part is, you most likely have never walked a day with either of
those guys. You don't know where they are in life. Clearly, you're
looking at it from the financial reports release via the media. But as
men, you don't have a clue as to where they're at in their lives. A
so-called political rapper talks to the common man like you because the
other two guys are selling pipe dreams because you and I both know that
you don't know anyone flying around in G4s, romancing super models, and
pushing Maybachs. You'd think with the songs those clowns put out
concerning &quot;teaching you&quot; how to stunt and dealing with &quot;money, cash,
and hoes&quot; some of that would've rubbed off on you. Hmmm.......

Wrong answer. Stand down. He dropped Reasonable Doubt in 1996. He got
plenty of press. You're simply wrong.

However if you're saying instead that he wasn't as known as he was
now, you're quite right. However using that argument as a way to
somehow prove he is or isn't dope is plainly absurd. Nobody was
talking about Immortal Technique in 1986. Nobody was talking about PE
in 1982. Nobody was talking about Rakim in 1979. See how it works?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Troll alert. Wrong answer. Stand down. Using EVERYONE as your
yardstick is again, simply absurd. EVERYONE thinks Jay-Z is dope.
Clearly you don't, so EVERYONE doesn't wash as a cover-all catchment
for your generalized statements.

You've already stated many times you don't care for these artists and
don't listen to them - so how can you ever say if their lyrics are
truly dope or not?

Anyway, let me take the time to welcome you back from wherever you
went to hide from the last argument you ducked out of. Feel free to
make some gay and mom jokes in response to this post, before you get

I agree with Irish and musically I CAN'T STAND Jay-z.  I was pretty
active as a dj at the time and REASONALBLE DOUBT had tremendous buzz.
I was pretty much forced to buy it - due to the fact that every little
bar that let me spin backpacker hip hop at the time was requesting
it.  Back then he got tremendous respect from theunderground kids, who
liked it a hell of a lot more than the g's.  On the West Coast , at
least, I was asked to play &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; and &quot;Ain't No Nigga&quot; far
more than I was asked to play anything off LIFE AFTER DEATH.

In my original post I actually meant to say they are not where they
are because of &quot;dope lyrics&quot;.

I still like both of them, and in Jay-Zs case he DOES have dope lyrics
in my opinion.

I would rather learn from both, than from Immortal Technique for
sure.  What'd Technique offer me of value?

I agree with quest's point.  Emcee's glorifiying this type of
lifestyle does have a dangerous impact on people.  Pushing this type
of balling lifestyle image in hip hop lyrics is more of a concern to
me than lyrics concerning homicide, drug dealing and misogynistic
(sp?) lyrics.

Showing people a lifestyle that is beyond most people's means becomes
something that a lot of people are susceptible to and feel long term
effects from it.  I don't know about everybody else but alot of people
I know try to rock the crazy rides and cop the latest gear but can
barely afford that shit and are living cheque to cheque or even more
commonly living in debt.  In other words &quot;Broke Ass Ballers&quot;.

Now I don't hate on people buying all that bullshit Gucci and Louis
Vutton and poppin bottles and all that crap.  If you can afford it
then more power to you.  All I'm saying is 50 and Jay and all these
other dudes  gotta stress to cats that they should make sure they can
afford it before they overextend themselves financially to look like
the next man who's probably broker than you.  I'd stress &quot;Ballin on a
Budget&quot;.

I'd rather have 50 cent and Jay Z encouraging people to be smart with
their money and they too could have an easier life.  But right now all
most of them seem to be are walking product placement ads for other
people or their own companies.

I have to agree with Natty on this one too.  That one where he starts
talking about Vegetarianism on one of his cd's got pretty annoying.
The message was simple but for some reason he kept using big scholarly
words.  I don't know what type of point he was making there.  And he
does seem to incorporate a lot of conspiracy theories.  He's tries to
pull off an RBG image (Revolutionary but Gangsta) but it just comes
across as contradictory and for me he just projects himself as
educated AND ignorant at the same time.

One prison scholar rapper I do like though is OneBeLo.

why?

if we're making the argument to the Bill O'Reillys of this world, that
they don't understand Hiphop... that its entertainment... that hearing
someone talking about shooting someone, selling drugs, or anything
else does not make the average person want to run out and copy... then
how how can you make the opposite argument for anything else...

Just because Jay drinks Cristal, 50 drives Maybachs, Kanye carries LV
bag it doesn't mean that I'm trying to do that. If people DO try to do
that without the means to support it, then they're as dumb as trying
those trying to match or better the Clipse drug tales, or calling
women bitches because Cube and the 2 Live Crew did so.

And there are dumb people in ALL walks of life. Cue mass suicides from
the grunge crowd when Cobain snuffed it for example. They're always
going to exist - but the average fan knows right from wrong, knows
their financial limits and behaves as required.

Why does this one aspect of Hiphop concern you more than the others?

Why? Why wouldn't they glorify achieving riches, especially if it's a
rags rags-to-riches situation?  They've experienced some sort of
(financial) success.  Also, their reference point has changed.

Ass To Lose, helping son himself, goes:
&lt;&lt;Wrong answer. Stand down. He dropped Reasonable Doubt in 1996. He got
plenty of press. You're simply wrong.&gt;&gt;

50 Cent had a big article in the SOURCE long before &quot;Wanksta&quot;, still for
the most part no one was talking about him. You're wrong, you can have
plenty of press and still be a nobody, in the main, until your song
blows up. Stand down and stay off the T.I.P of my(your gay
reference...like Kanye Worst, you can come out of the closet).

&lt;&lt;However if you're saying instead that he wasn't as known as he was
now, you're quite right. However using that argument as a way to somehow
prove he is or isn't dope is plainly absurd. Nobody was talking about
Immortal Technique in 1986. Nobody was talking about PE in 1982. Nobody
was talking about Rakim in 1979. See how it works?&gt;&gt;

I know I'm right, and you are hardly worth the co-sign that you wish you
were. And no, your &quot;see how it works&quot; examples don't. Read and profit
from history...and use common sense.

&lt;&lt;Troll alert. Wrong answer. Stand down. Using EVERYONE as your
yardstick is again, simply absurd. EVERYONE thinks Jay-Z is dope.
Clearly you don't, so EVERYONE doesn't wash as a cover-all catchment for
your generalized statements.&gt;&gt;

Yes, troll, stand down. Again sport, your example here, like most of
your posts, is all over the place. &quot;Catchment&quot;, hmmm, I think I'll start
using that.

&lt;&lt;You've already stated many times you don't care for these artists and
don't listen to them - so how can you ever say if their lyrics are truly
dope or not?&gt;&gt;

And you've read enough of(or should I say, salivated over) my posts to
know that I've also said you don't need to buy/own their work to come
away with an informed opinion. Thanks to this medium(and the bars),
that's how I can say what I say. But you're an idiot, so I have no
problem reminding you of what I said. Amazing how you jock everything I
say yet fail to remember this, but that's what idiots do.

&lt;&lt;Anyway, let me take the time to welcome you back from wherever you
went to hide from the last argument you ducked out of. Feel free to make
some gay and mom jokes in response to this post, before you get sonned
again.&gt;&gt;

Duck from you?! You, your posts, and your website are bullshit. Face the
fact that cyberspace is your life and you've become a pestilent shell of
a person because of it. Boy, this isn't even close, you always get your
ass handed to you locking horns with me. And yes, it's a pity that some
bitch actually carried you to term. A waste of potentially good snatch.
The sympathy of women is a thing to behold 'sho 'nuff.

Again, I don't like 50 Cent at all.  Only heard a handful of songs on
the radio and mixtapes.  Still, this is really bad revisionist
history.  You've been taking G Dub lessons... completely ignoring
something I know you were around to witness.

In 1999/2000 or so, before he got signed, there was HUGE buzz around
50.  Mainly when &quot;How to Rob&quot; came out on the Mad Rapper tape.  RMHH
blew up with nothing but &quot;50 this, 50 that&quot; chat for months.  Xenos
said he liked it, people were amazed he called out names.  Josh Scott
declared 50 the only East Coast artist he ever liked.  I remember it.
I remember Napster-ing the damn song to hear what everyone was talking
about.

Everyone!  Not just in here.  I'd go to Fat Beats or Aron's records,
and all the hip hop kids were talking about it.  Again, just like with
Jay Z, the initial buzz was mainly around underground hip hop kids.
50 was backpacker's delight for the entire year of 2000.  Then he got
signed to Shady and it was gigantic talk, and one of the most
anticipated releases ever.

You can't deny that - someone can Google it and shove it in your
face.  You have a bad habit of trying to discredit things you don't
like.  I share your dislike for 50 and Jay-Z, but I'd never deny that
they paid their dues and came up the same way everyone else did.  It's
not debatable.  there's hard documentation.  The holocaust did happen,
there's film footage and everything.

Nice job not seeing the forest for the trees, but the baller lifestyle
these guys are living is because of their being smart with the money
and starting companies and not trying to live off of being an
entertainer, and THEY TALK ABOUT THIS IN THEIR RHYMES.  So if anything
I'd say they are encouraging people to live realistically.  Just
because dumb motherfuckers wanna walk before they crawl doesnt mean
that its the people able to walks fault for not crawling around on the
ground.  Hell why not blame every politician ever who has security and
a mansion, and a fleet of cars
(and frequently a private jet) for setting an &quot;impossible standard&quot;
with regards to what common people can actually attain?  Fronting like
your a baller when your in debt isnt keeping it real, and anyone
trying to do that certainly isnt getting their ideas from hiphop,
they're just fucking lazy pricks who wanna look like they're rich and
famous, and I would say bullshit like celebrity columns in newspapers
and bullshit liek people magazine are glorifying that more than the
artists themselves.  I mean, to quote every texas rapper &quot;gimme the

&gt;Prez collabo.  He's always said he'd rhyme like Kweli and Dead Prez if
&gt;it paid bills.

Yeah that's true.  But how much more $ does he gotta make?  And can't
he put like one song on every album that teaches the youth?  I think
&quot;99 problems&quot; was actually a good song where for 4 lines it taught
laymen about your rights when a policeman asks to search your car.  I
think he should do some songs that reflect that type of spirit for a
whole song once in a while.  You know that &quot;They Schools&quot; don't teach
you all you need to know about society and the government and other
unscrupulous predators prey on people who are ignorant of the
situation they get themselves into.  So why not teach them some stuff?

I know that didn't really address your post but Jay Z can always fit
at least one type of song like that.  If your not part of the solution
are you not part of the problem?

">

I've thinking been about this and I think why materialism is so
offensive to me more than anything is that it can influence a lot more
people.  When somebody talks about killing somebody, dealing drugs,
pimping women the law is actually there to dissuade people and a
person's morality will tell them from within that that shit is wrong.
No matter what somebody told you, you know mercking somebody is wrong.
So you gotta be really stupid to do those other things because
everyone in society opposes these actions.

But almost everyone is susceptible to materialism.  What is there to
stop people from going into debt and overextending themselves
financially to buy things they can't afford?  Is there a law against
it?  Everywhere you look you get bombarded.  Virtually media outlet,
every company promotes consumerism.  They enable this type of
financial prison on people.  Companies get richer while consumers
break their back trying to live up to an ideal that they cannot
possibly attain.

Greed and materialism is the #1 reason why the economy in the US is in
the toilet right now.  People getting greedy from those sub-prime
lending schemes have caused the US economy to collapse and it's
affected world wide markets and the Canadian economy especially.  Our
Dollar almost at par to the US Dollar ($0.97).  It's not because the
Canadian economy is doing so good but because the US economy is in the
crap hole.  This just proves to me that consumerism, materialism and
bad money management is prevelant among a lot more people than just a
bunch of idiots.

I'm not saying that hip hop is the sole contributor to this epidemic.
In fact I say it's actually a very small contributor compared to the
other agencies out there promoting consumerism.  But it's still a
contributor.  And since young kids that listen to this are very
impressionable they get started at an early age.

I didn't think I'd ever wave the impressionable young kids argument
ever in my life but these young kids today are stupid as hell.

That's my thoughts anyway.

P.S. AtotheL, you're probably one of the smart people that know how to
handle their money.  But that's probably because you're Irish.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The sad part is, you most likely have never walked a day with either of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;those guys. You don't know where they are in life. Clearly, you're
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;looking at it from the financial reports release via the media. But as
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;men, you don't have a clue as to where they're at in their lives. A
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;so-called political rapper talks to the common man like you because the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;other two guys are selling pipe dreams because you and I both know that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;you don't know anyone flying around in G4s, romancing super models, and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;pushing Maybachs. You'd think with the songs those clowns put out
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;concerning &quot;teaching you&quot; how to stunt and dealing with &quot;money, cash,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and hoes&quot; some of that would've rubbed off on you. Hmmm.......

&gt; &gt;&gt;I agree with quest's point.  Emcee's glorifiying this type of
&gt; &gt;&gt;lifestyle does have a dangerous impact on people.  Pushing this type
&gt; &gt;&gt;of balling lifestyle image in hip hop lyrics is more of a concern to
&gt; &gt;&gt;me than lyrics concerning homicide, drug dealing and misogynistic
&gt; &gt;&gt;(sp?) lyrics.

&gt; &gt;why?

&gt; &gt;if we're making the argument to the Bill O'Reillys of this world, that
&gt; &gt;they don't understand Hiphop... that its entertainment... that hearing
&gt; &gt;someone talking about shooting someone, selling drugs, or anything
&gt; &gt;else does not make the average person want to run out and copy... then
&gt; &gt;how how can you make the opposite argument for anything else...

&gt; &gt;Just because Jay drinks Cristal, 50 drives Maybachs, Kanye carries LV
&gt; &gt;bag it doesn't mean that I'm trying to do that. If people DO try to do
&gt; &gt;that without the means to support it, then they're as dumb as trying
&gt; &gt;those trying to match or better the Clipse drug tales, or calling
&gt; &gt;women bitches because Cube and the 2 Live Crew did so.

&gt; I've thinking been about this and I think why materialism is so
&gt; offensive to me more than anything is that it can influence a lot more
&gt; people.  When somebody talks about killing somebody, dealing drugs,
&gt; pimping women the law is actually there to dissuade people and a
&gt; person's morality will tell them from within that that shit is wrong.
&gt; No matter what somebody told you, you know mercking somebody is wrong.
&gt; So you gotta be really stupid to do those other things because
&gt; everyone in society opposes these actions.

&gt; But almost everyone is susceptible to materialism.  What is there to
&gt; stop people from going into debt and overextending themselves
&gt; financially to buy things they can't afford?  Is there a law against
&gt; it?  Everywhere you look you get bombarded.  Virtually media outlet,
&gt; every company promotes consumerism.  They enable this type of
&gt; financial prison on people.  Companies get richer while consumers
&gt; break their back trying to live up to an ideal that they cannot
&gt; possibly attain.

I feel you on that point. My mom was an political activist in nyc so I
was literally raised on the peace marches and garvey readings. That
being said, that may be the reason I really don't care to listen to
immortal tech and the new generation of political rap &quot;teachers&quot;. they
can't teach me shit. I know all the stuff they speak on to the point
it's played out to me. I will say that it doesn't hurt for the younger
generation of hip hop fans to feel them cause I know if I was 14, I'd
like them all. 50 cent/jay-z, on the other hand, are what I like to
call fast food mc's. im not saying they aren't legitimate
artists(cause im a jay-z fan). They are businessmen who are selling a
prepackaged commodity that is the american dream. And the real
american dream happens to be alcohol, clothes, jewelry, and auto
accessories. Those good old american values and the globalization of
those values are fundamentally the reason more than half the world
hates us right now.

&gt;&gt; blows up. Stand down and stay off the T.I.P of my(your gay

&gt;Again, I don't like 50 Cent at all.  Only heard a handful of songs on

&gt;history.  You've been taking G Dub lessons... completely ignoring
&gt;something I know you were around to witness.

&gt;In 1999/2000 or so, before he got signed, there was HUGE buzz around
&gt;50.  Mainly when &quot;How to Rob&quot; came out on the Mad Rapper tape.  RMHH
&gt;blew up with nothing but &quot;50 this, 50 that&quot; chat for months.  Xenos
&gt;said he liked it, people were amazed he called out names.  Josh Scott
&gt;declared 50 the only East Coast artist he ever liked.  I remember it.
&gt;I remember Napster-ing the damn song to hear what everyone was talking
&gt;about.

&gt;Everyone!  Not just in here.  I'd go to Fat Beats or Aron's records,
&gt;and all the hip hop kids were talking about it.  Again, just like with
&gt;Jay Z, the initial buzz was mainly around underground hip hop kids.
&gt;50 was backpacker's delight for the entire year of 2000.  Then he got
&gt;signed to Shady and it was gigantic talk, and one of the most
&gt;anticipated releases ever.

&gt;You can't deny that - someone can Google it and shove it in your
&gt;face.  You have a bad habit of trying to discredit things you don't
&gt;like.  I share your dislike for 50 and Jay-Z, but I'd never deny that
&gt;they paid their dues and came up the same way everyone else did.  It's
&gt;not debatable.  there's hard documentation.  The holocaust did happen,

If you've been following the thread, you know what the fuck my point
was. Don't ask stupid questions. And in 1996, it was Biggie and Tupac
all the time. And the South was about to start its' takeover. Technique,
as far as I know, was still doing/or just finished his bid in prison.
Naturally, he wouldn't have been discussed.

&lt;&lt;What the fuck planet are you on where no one cared about power of the
dollar? That shit got so heavily bootlegged when it got pushed back in
late 99. The only reason it never dropped was the stabbing and shooting
incidents. 50 had plenty of buzz pre wanksta.&gt;&gt;

I know about &quot;How To Rob&quot;, name another. The &quot;buzz&quot; essentially came
from that and that's it. Where did he say he profited most from early
on....the mixtape thing. You and I both know that the mixtape game today
is far and away more advanced than it was in the mid-1990s. Everyone was
still on the mainstream tip, going to FYE and what not. If you're not
there at that time, you weren't talked about. Then again, my memory's
faulty.

&lt;&lt;Nobody gave a fuck about Rakim until Run DMC fell off and started
rapping over rock beats and LL went soft to get the ladies and he was
able to step into the void.&gt;&gt;

You are on drugs. What the fuck planet are you on? Considered a classic,
&quot;Raising Hell&quot; came out in 1986. Guess who also dropped in 1986? Think
about it. Your history is atrocious, L.L. didn't go &quot;soft&quot; at this time.

Agreed 100%. But now, one can rightly argue that 30 year old men and
women justify in their minds that it's the thing to do to get 1 pair of
$150 jeans, the new phone from Apple, and then complain because they
don't have money to take them through the end of the work week. Yes sir,
listen to what you want. But I also believe that what you listen to
becomes you after a while. And this point should never be lost, most of
the stuff they're listening is just plain wack.

&lt;&lt;wow... Ludacris references topping off a completely wrong summary of
the beginning of 50's career... way to stay up with the yung uns,
questy!&gt;&gt;

Whoosh!

&lt;&lt;this coming from a man who's SO on the pulse, he started raving about
NYOIL almost 11 months after the man first dropped 'Y'all Should All Get
Lynched'.&gt;&gt;

Really?! It's been that long?! Whoosh!

&lt;&lt;What the fuck does this even mean? You're saying that 50 Cent and
Jay-Z weren't getting any buzz before they came out on a major label.
You're fucking wrong.&gt;&gt;

No stupid. What the fuck do you mean, retard? Read what you said above.
That's what I hit you back with. See how it works dumbass?

&lt;&lt;You're saying they aren't dope, BECAUSE nobody was talking about them.
Again, you're blantantly wrong.
But anyway, if you want me to use common sense. Nobody was talking about
him as a major star in 1988. There. Happy now?&gt;&gt;

No moron, YOU'RE saying that. I'm saying they not dope because they're
wack. I've listened to them enough to come away with that conclusion.
You're blatantly wrong because again, you're all over the place.

&lt;&lt;Please explain why its all over the place. You're saying &quot;50 Cent is
no lyricist, and EVERYONE knows that&quot; - you don't speak for everyone, so
you're wrong. The same way as if I said 'everyone thinks Jay-Z is dope'
I'd be wrong, because you plainly don't.&gt;&gt;

It is dumbass. 50 Cent isn't lyrical, I know you'll defend him. Immortal
Technique needs no defending and I KNOW he's lyrical. Admittedly
Jigga-boo is better sounding than 50 Cent, but as always, you get me
with these trick questions.

&lt;&lt;However, since we're in Questworld, all answers that don't agree with
Quest are automatically wrong (even when they're right) which means that
myself, Natty, and TJ are all completely wrong, have no knowledge of any
Hiphop history, and are probably extremely gay with prostitutes for
mothers.&gt;&gt;

Let me jack you again, quickly. Wrong answer. We're at
rec.music.hip-hop. I'm not asking you or anyone else to agree with my
view(s). I pretty much NEVER agree with anything you say because your
reasoning is never clear and cohesive. And your last statement, stick to
YOU. Nothing is more gay than trying to drag other people into your
situation. EVERYONE knows that whores do that.

&lt;&lt;yup... webtv is a wonderful thing...
(note to rest of group: A to the L knows that Quest prob has 'real'
internet access elsewhere... yes, even in McDonalds... but I'll
generalize and assume on this instance, as he always does with
everything (see: 'EVERYONE knows' line above) that he only has Webtv.&gt;&gt;

Well, yes it(and the internet as a whole) is. Hey, I agreed with you on
something. Note to you: your &quot;tendencies&quot; are showing.

&lt;&lt;I think I've covered enough here, while still leaving you enough
wiggle room (nh) to retort with some gay slurs, some momma jokes, and
some 'read and profit' throwaway lines.&gt;&gt;

Wiggle room? See, that &quot;nh&quot; thing is all &quot;we&quot; need to know about you.

You're the one that shifted the goalposts to &quot;most rappers&quot; because if

trafficking joint and &quot;Point of no return&quot;.  I'm not as into him (no
homo) as when that album dropped though as he seems to be trying too
hard to be revolutionary.

I didn't realise he was one.  I'm hit and miss on his solo, sometimes
I think it's dope, sometimes I think it's boring.  I need to spin it
again.

Yeah, just to add another angle to this.  Being a newbie, 96 was the
year I got into hip-hop and although &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; got mad plays by
everyone (including myself), there was a lot of love for Reasonable
Doubt, even in the Uk.  I remember my brothers friends raving about
&quot;Dead Presidents&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn's Finest&quot;.

&gt; In 1999/2000 or so, before he got signed, there was HUGE buzz around

&gt; blew up with nothing but &quot;50 this, 50 that&quot; chat for months.  Xenos
&gt; said he liked it, people were amazed he called out names.  Josh Scott
&gt; declared 50 the only East Coast artist he ever liked.  I remember it.
&gt; I remember Napster-ing the damn song to hear what everyone was talking

Yeah I have to co-sign this.  I remember before 50 signed to Shady,
listening to the Westwood show were he was raving about him.  Then
almost every guest at the time was asked &quot;who do you think will blow
up next&quot; and the answer was always 50 because of the sheer amount of
buzz he was getting from the mixtape circuit.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The sad part is, you most likely have never walked a day with either of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;those guys. You don't know where they are in life. Clearly, you're
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;looking at it from the financial reports release via the media. But as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;men, you don't have a clue as to where they're at in their lives. A
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;so-called political rapper talks to the common man like you because the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;other two guys are selling pipe dreams because you and I both know that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;you don't know anyone flying around in G4s, romancing super models, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;pushing Maybachs. You'd think with the songs those clowns put out
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;concerning &quot;teaching you&quot; how to stunt and dealing with &quot;money, cash,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and hoes&quot; some of that would've rubbed off on you. Hmmm.......

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I agree with quest's point.  Emcee's glorifiying this type of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;lifestyle does have a dangerous impact on people.  Pushing this type
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;of balling lifestyle image in hip hop lyrics is more of a concern to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;me than lyrics concerning homicide, drug dealing and misogynistic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(sp?) lyrics.

&gt;&gt; &gt;why?

&gt;&gt; &gt;if we're making the argument to the Bill O'Reillys of this world, that
&gt;&gt; &gt;they don't understand Hiphop... that its entertainment... that hearing
&gt;&gt; &gt;someone talking about shooting someone, selling drugs, or anything
&gt;&gt; &gt;else does not make the average person want to run out and copy... then
&gt;&gt; &gt;how how can you make the opposite argument for anything else...

&gt;&gt; &gt;Just because Jay drinks Cristal, 50 drives Maybachs, Kanye carries LV
&gt;&gt; &gt;bag it doesn't mean that I'm trying to do that. If people DO try to do
&gt;&gt; &gt;that without the means to support it, then they're as dumb as trying
&gt;&gt; &gt;those trying to match or better the Clipse drug tales, or calling
&gt;&gt; &gt;women bitches because Cube and the 2 Live Crew did so.

&gt;&gt; I've thinking been about this and I think why materialism is so
&gt;&gt; offensive to me more than anything is that it can influence a lot more
&gt;&gt; people.  When somebody talks about killing somebody, dealing drugs,
&gt;&gt; pimping women the law is actually there to dissuade people and a
&gt;&gt; person's morality will tell them from within that that shit is wrong.
&gt;&gt; No matter what somebody told you, you know mercking somebody is wrong.
&gt;&gt; So you gotta be really stupid to do those other things because
&gt;&gt; everyone in society opposes these actions.

&gt;&gt; But almost everyone is susceptible to materialism.  What is there to
&gt;&gt; stop people from going into debt and overextending themselves
&gt;&gt; financially to buy things they can't afford?  Is there a law against
&gt;&gt; it?  Everywhere you look you get bombarded.  Virtually media outlet,
&gt;&gt; every company promotes consumerism.  They enable this type of
&gt;&gt; financial prison on people.  Companies get richer while consumers
&gt;&gt; break their back trying to live up to an ideal that they cannot
&gt;&gt; possibly attain.

&gt;&gt; Greed and materialism is the #1 reason why the economy in the US is in
&gt;&gt; the toilet right now.  People getting greedy from those sub-prime
&gt;&gt; lending schemes have caused the US economy to collapse and it's
&gt;&gt; affected world wide markets and the Canadian economy especially.  Our
&gt;&gt; Dollar almost at par to the US Dollar ($0.97).  It's not because the
&gt;&gt; Canadian economy is doing so good but because the US economy is in the
&gt;&gt; crap hole.  This just proves to me that consumerism, materialism and
&gt;&gt; bad money management is prevelant among a lot more people than just a
&gt;&gt; bunch of idiots. http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/personalfinance/mortgage-meltdown.html

&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that hip hop is the sole contributor to this epidemic.
&gt;&gt; In fact I say it's actually a very small contributor compared to the
&gt;&gt; other agencies out there promoting consumerism.  But it's still a
&gt;&gt; contributor.  And since young kids that listen to this are very
&gt;&gt; impressionable they get started at an early age.

&gt;&gt; I didn't think I'd ever wave the impressionable young kids argument
&gt;&gt; ever in my life but these young kids today are stupid as hell.

&gt;&gt; That's my thoughts anyway.

&gt;&gt; P.S. AtotheL, you're probably one of the smart people that know how to
&gt;&gt; handle their money.  But that's probably because you're Irish.

&gt;&gt; Peace!

&gt;I feel you on that point. My mom was an political activist in nyc so I
&gt;was literally raised on the peace marches and garvey readings. That
&gt;being said, that may be the reason I really don't care to listen to
&gt;immortal tech and the new generation of political rap &quot;teachers&quot;. they
&gt;can't teach me shit. I know all the stuff they speak on to the point
&gt;it's played out to me. I will say that it doesn't hurt for the younger
&gt;generation of hip hop fans to feel them cause I know if I was 14, I'd
&gt;like them all. 50 cent/jay-z, on the other hand, are what I like to
&gt;call fast food mc's. im not saying they aren't legitimate
&gt;artists(cause im a jay-z fan). They are businessmen who are selling a
&gt;prepackaged commodity that is the american dream. And the real
&gt;american dream happens to be alcohol, clothes, jewelry, and auto
&gt;accessories. Those good old american values and the globalization of
&gt;those values are fundamentally the reason more than half the world
&gt;hates us right now.

Yeah I agree with you totally.  When I first heard Immortal Technique
back in '02-'03.  I really liked his shit (nh).  It was something
different.  It was like Dead Prez but a lot more aggressive.

But after my road trip about a month back, I popped it in the car
stereo and for me it wasn't as great as I remembered.  I don't think
it was because the cd sucked but because I already heard all of this
stuff before and it seemed kinda old now and didn't have much of an
impact on me anymore.  If I was listening to it again for the first
time I'd like to believe I'd still like it.

Peace!

Rowdy Rowdy was on the In Too Deep soundtrack too.  Ghetto Quran and
