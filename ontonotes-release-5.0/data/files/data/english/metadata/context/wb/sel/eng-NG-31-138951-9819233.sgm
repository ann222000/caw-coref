WEEKLY LOVE HOROSCOPE
for Monday, December 3 thru Sunday, December 9, 2007
(c) Astrology.com 1996-2007

ARIES
Put the proverbial shoe on the other foot when it comes to sizing up a
romantic situation as the week gets going. How would you feel if you were
them? Love isn't about looking out for number one. Your emotions are
emphasized by the stars beginning sometime Wednesday and lasting through the
end of the workweek. You're liable to really overreact at this time. Take
multiple deep breaths, and ask a heart-smart friend for a reality check
prior to freaking out. This weekend, action's favored -- could it be action
of the amorous variety? It's up to you!

TAURUS
Take extra good care of yourself as the week gets going. The sniffles just
aren't sexy, and the stars say your health needs attention. If you're
coupled up, it's an excellent time to start a tandem fitness activity. Your
life looks much more passionate beginning sometime Wednesday and lasting
through the end of the workweek -- you might even feel some pangs of
jealousy or some pretty serious possessiveness. Know when you're going a
little too far! This weekend, encounters with others have many layers. Don't
take romantic matters at face value.

GEMINI
Romance is in your personal stars as the week gets going. If you're single,
don't wait to make an overture (or several -- increase your odds!). If
you're coupled up, you only have eyes for your sweetie (so be careful
driving or operating heavy machinery!). Then, if there's something you've
been wondering about regarding your love life, an answer may be coming
sometime Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. Hint: Ask or look all you want, but
the info you need may lie within your own heart. Smart's sexy, and you're
smarter than ever this weekend. What are you learning? Don't be afraid to
share it.

CANCER
You and your certain someone may not be seeing eye-to-eye as the week gets
going. Don't ignore it -- sort it out instead. If you're single, well ...
right now that may be the way to be! Then, beginning sometime Wednesday and
lasting through the end of the workweek, you've got a unique cosmic
opportunity to express your inner self and effect change as a result.
Whether you're sharing with a partner or a close friend (or your therapist),
go deep. And while festivities may beckon this weekend, know when to duck
out, solo or with someone you want to spend time with.

LEO
Friends and flirtation and fun are favored right up front this week -- on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning. At this time, you ought to be feeling
and looking fabulous, and if the stars have their say, you will be.
Singletons, hop online or get out and about real-time -- you're very
popular! If you're coupled up, take advantage of the sway you'll have over
your sweetie now. The really good news is that the weekend's energy is much
the same, but more so. You're hot, so plan accordingly! And on those days in
between, watch for something interesting going on beneath the surface.

VIRGO
If you're on the fence about a certain situation at the beginning of the
week, a heart-to-heart -- whether with a friend or the person in question --
can be most revealing. Then, from sometime Wednesday through the end of the
workweek, you may feel a little restless with whatever's happening in your
love life (or not happening, as the case may be). Luckily, you're extra
sharp now -- apply that brainpower to the realm of romance. Your hint from
the stars for this weekend: The universe loves those who give love a chance.
Give it a whirl, lay it on the line ... say yes (or at least maybe).

LIBRA
It's joy to your world as the week gets going, with the stars giving you
lots of extra sparkle and those around you feeling the love. Whether you're
coupled up or single, you're making people feel special and getting special
attention in return. Then, from sometime Wednesday through the end of the
workweek, it's likely work or money that's uppermost in your mind. But if
you make it a priority, a certain connection can really blossom now. And
when the weekend comes, wonder awaits, especially if you're branching out,
embracing the new and saying what's on your mind.

SCORPIO
One of your skills in the love department is particularly useful as the week
gets going. Which one, you ask? It's your ability to look deeper, comprehend
subtle signals and sort out what's really going on beneath the surface.
Then, beginning sometime Wednesday and lasting through the end of the
workweek, your unbelievable magnetism has even more attraction factor than
usual. Single? Maybe not for long. Coupled up? Your honey's more into you
than ever now. This weekend, cool down and take a calm, collected look at
your current situation.

SAGITTARIUS
Make your own magic as the week gets going! If you're coupled up, letting
your sweetie in on what you're wishing for could bring a welcome gift;
singletons who take advantage of the present moment instead of waiting
around can also find sweet stuff now. You're more shy and retiring from
later on Wednesday through the end of the workweek, and that's just fine.
Let them come to you, and rest up for what promises to be an even more
magical weekend. You'll want to be ready, willing and able to embrace the
season's joys while exploring all sorts of relationships and feeling the
love.

CAPRICORN
Love connections are a little off as the week gets going, so you might as
well apply yourself to work and rest up for what's to come. The energy
changes sometime Wednesday, lasting through the end of the workweek. At this
time, friends are in the forefront, there's fun to be had and you notice
some subtle signals of the more-than-friendly variety. If you're coupled up,
the two of you may make an exciting move now; singletons, too, take
significant steps on their love path. This weekend, matters of the heart may
be moving even faster. Don't lose track of what's most important.

AQUARIUS
Keeping it to yourself isn't going to cut it as the week gets going. Good
energy and good times depend on sharing your thoughts and feelings -- put
yourself out there, and the stars will send sweet stuff your way. Then it
may be work, work and more work from sometime Wednesday through Friday; keep
social plans low-key and dates on the casual side now. There's plenty of
time for bigger, better stuff this weekend, when the stars are letting you
in on some secrets, giving you some great ideas and generally making life
(and love) grand.

PISCES
Don't just stand there -- take an active role in your love life as the week
gets going. Singletons: You won't know until you try -- so go on, send that
flirty message! The coupled up: Now's the time to speak your mind about what
you want (and maybe what you don't). Then, beginning sometime Wednesday and
lasting through the end of the workweek, seek clarity about your own
emotional state. Why are you feeling this way? Look at love and life
holistically, and be ready for a stroke of luck this weekend. Watch
carefully, as it could come when (and where) you least expect it!
