I have a friend who wants to rejuvenate the faceplates on his/her
altimeter and airspeed. Â They have become faded and 'unsightly' although
working just fine.

Any suggestions as to approaches, "no-no's", etc.?

Thanks,

Larry

About 8 or 10 years ago the following outfit completely corrected this
very problem:

OTTO INSTRUMENT SERVICE
1441 Valencia Pl # A
Ontario, CA 91761
909-930-5800

Arrangements were made on the telephone, the airspeed indicator was
mailed to them, and it came back with all the yellow, white, and red
markings looking bright and shinny.
