The Richmond Times-Dispatch has hired a new executive editor --
59-year-old Glenn Proctor, an associated editor of the Star-Ledger in
Newark, N.J. -- to replace William H. Millsaps Jr., who has run the
paper for 11 years. Publisher Thomas A. Silvestri described Proctor as
"a firebrand on behalf of excellence in journalism." ( See story .)

Proctor is an ex-Marine, a seasoned newsman and... an
African-American. As Michael Paul Williams, the T-D's liberal black
columnist observed , "This qualifies as a ... seminal event not just in
the history of this publication, but in a community where few corporate
posts of this magnitude are held by people of color."

Added Williams: "The uniform reaction to the news from other members
of the 'Caucus' -- the web of black journalists who once plied their
trade here before moving on -- was a collective 'wow!' Only the number
of exclamation points varied."

I interpret the Proctor appointment as consistent with Publisher
Silvestri's make-over of the T-D as a stronger force in the community.
First we saw Silvestri's "public square" initiative, promising a greater
involvement in the community, accompanied by a discernible shift in the
editorial pages in the treatment of local issues. Now we see the
appointment of a forceful black executive editor whose predecessors 50
years ago defended massive resistance to integration.

If Proctor shares the shop-worn, blacks-as-victims narrative of
Williams' column, his relationship with Richmond could be a very rocky
one. But I'm hoping that won't be the case. I expect that Proctor will
reflect the can-do ethic of the Marines he sprang from. In which case,
we can all say, Welcome to Richmond!

It won't matter a damn if they can't get the thing in my driveway by
6 a.m. The old carrier got it there by 5, the new carrier is spotty at 6
(6:20 today in the rain)-- which means they have lost my early-to-work
wife as a loyal daily reader and I spend less time with it.

I'm guessing that an ex-Marine with over 3 decades of journalism
experience in places like Newark, Akron, Iowa, Rochester and Philly who
was also a congressional press secretary will not have the tendencies
that you fear, Jim. As for Williams, remember that nearly all of his
journalism career has been spent inside the halls of the RTD which,
given that paper's history, brings a more personal tale of woe for him
than is readily understood. From what I've seen, that "battle" tends to
permeate much of his writing. At worst, Proctor's hiring will shake up
things across the street at the Richmond Free Press so that paper can be
more than the "RTD hates blacks" newspaper that it is now.

Personally, I like that Proctor will be pushing the paper beyond the
frontiers of its sleepy, gentile coverage. Maybe they can actually
compete with the Virginian-Pilot and WashPost on quality, if not size.
Richmond - all of the Metro - deserves a better lead newspaper.
