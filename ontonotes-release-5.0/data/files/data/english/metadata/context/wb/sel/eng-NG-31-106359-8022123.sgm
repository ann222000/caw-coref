hi all,
new to this group and was wondering about lifting to failure -- of
course I have lots of questions being new to this.  When I'm doing my
last rep, is there value in continuing to push as hard as I can for a
few seconds even though the weights aren't moving anymore.  My guess
is that this still helps to stress the muscle even more (but I
remember from first year physics that force with no movement = no
work).

Also, I have been giving myself as little as 48 hours rest between
workouts for the following exercises (i.e. sometimes 2 days, sometime
4 days as I don't do all each time, but sometimes repeat the same
exercises every-other day)
-bench press
-shoulder press
-preacher curl
-dips
-lat pull-down
-chin-ups and pull-ups
-seated rows
-shrugs

I'm 31 years old, 180lb, 5'11&quot;, using a Powertec WB-LS, consuming
enough protein, eating and resting relatively well, etc, etc.  I am
happy with my gains in the last 3 months, but am I putting myself at
risk for over-training?

thanks in advance.

Wayne.

Yep, that's how Physics 101 defines &quot;work&quot; -- but it's somewhat
different when it comes to muscles.  For example, too much force can
be no &quot;work,&quot; too -- you throw the weight up and it's basically
momentum, not your muscles (after the initial heave)...you see, it's
about stressing the muscle, and insofar as you're still stressing the
muscle even though no weight is being moved, you are doing &quot;work&quot; in
the bodybuilding sense.  This is also why it's good to flex and pose
in front of the mirror.a

If you're giving yourself a break every other day, you're most likely
all right.  What does your body tell you?

There are just so many factors involved...perhaps you're not doing a
lot of reps, perhaps you're not going heavy, perhaps you're don't have
many sets, perhaps you're genetically gifted...&quot;over-training&quot; can be
over-stressed, I think...I doubt most people over-train...I hardly see
anyone break a sweat....

I'll guess &quot;no,&quot; however you can only be sure (again a guess) when
you're no longer happy with your gains. That is, when you're no longer
making gains then that could be evidence of over-training (or you've
reached your genetic limit).

Or, uh, other.

I have been running 2x per week (10k + 4k), and just haven't gotten
around to fitting additional leg (weight) exercises into my schedule.
I have been thinking about that the last week or so, just haven't
gotten to it yet.... will this slow down my running if I gain muscle
mass on my legs?  Should I do higher reps with lower weight (vs. the
6-10 for my upper body) if I still want to run regularly? thanks
again.

Wayne.

You sound all right.  Only slight soreness the next day, which goes
away the day after that, apparently.  Also, only two sets -- even if
to failure, for a max of ~10 reps -- and no more than an hour each
session.  You're doing everything by the book, for a beginner, and the
textbook answer would be, you're okay.

Just for comparison purposes: I used to do 5-hour workouts at least
once a week, with 40 minutes of cardio before and after weight-
lifiting...so I doubt you're anywhere near over-training.

Do you have any trouble sleeping?  Have you lost your appetite at
all?  (&quot;Eating and resting relatively well,&quot; as you originally
reported, is ambiguous.)  Are you more irritable lately?  Do you feel
weaker in some way?  Have you become a little less enthusiastic about
working out?  In most cases of overtraining a number of these symptoms
hit you all at once, particularly if you're less strong than ever
before (!) -- but short of all that, you're most likely doing just
fine.

What got you worried about over training?

An excellent book that will answer your questions
if you're willing to put in the time to read it
(500 pages) is &quot;Beyond Brawn.&quot;  My online briefcase
contains a copy, and you're welcome to check it out.
Here's a link: http://briefcase.yahoo.com/kd6tas
In addition, there are two sites with a lot of info
that I recommend:

Personally, I believe in intensity cycling.
In a nutshell, each cycle starts out with lighter
weights and progresses over time until linear
progress can't be maintained (weights can not
be increased without sacrificing form and/or
increasing total workout time).  At that point
the cycle ends, some off time is taken after which
another cycle is started.

The question is how often that level of intensity
is necessary (if ever).  Progression through
consistency is the key.  Beating yourself up
to the point of burn out is not a long term plan.

I believe that training every work set to failure
at every workout will eventually lead to CNS
(central nervous system) exhaustion.  CNS exhaustion
is a part of overtraining as is incomplete muscular
repair.  Either or both will halt your progress.

It's just a matter of time.  When looking at
your list of exercises I notice squats and deadlifts
are missing.  If you were training those to failure
several times a week along with all the others you'd
have your answer.  It quickly gets to the point where
you begin to fear what you think you need to do to
continue to progress.  At that point you begin to
question the value of weight training.  Then come
the missed workouts.  Finally you either quit completely
or discover intensity cycling and the difference between
progressive resistance and misguided intensity.

In the end it's a turtle and hare thing.  Consistency
is the key.  Training success is quantified based on
how many pounds of muscle is built per year.  Obviously
that means avoiding injury and burnout.  Leaving a rep
or two in the jar most of the time helps with the CNS
fatigue and mental (how you feel about what you face
each time you train) aspects.

You're welcome.  Good luck with your training.

Work for the purpose of Physics and for the purpose of exercise are not
the same.  Recall that if an object is moved from point A to point B, and
then back to point A, the net work done is Zero (0 net displacement = 0
work). From a strict Physics perspective, virtually no 'work' is done when
lifting weights because the weight usually ends up back at the starting
position.

No work is done *on the weight*; a considerable amount of work is done
warming up the atmosphere!

From an exercise POV, pushing without moving is isometric stress. It does
cause muscle development.
