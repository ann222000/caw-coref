Occam's Razor is the idea that when confronted with competing theories that
explain certain data equally well, the simplest one is usually correct. It's
called Occam's Razor, and not Occam's Hypothesis, or Occam's Theorem, or
Occam's Bit of Useful Advice, because it is a razor - it cuts cleanly and
with great efficiency.
And though it pains me to say so, this culture is in desperate need of a
shave.
IT'S A CONSPIRACY!
I want to forgo the niceties of the hot towel and go straight for the
jugular on this one. My goal here is not to bust any of these four
conspiracy theories; that has all been done much more effictively elsewhere.
What I am trying to do here is to build a chain of evidence to show a
progressively deteriorating epidemic of world-wide insanity, of truly
diseased thinking -- not just a misunderstanding or difference of opinion
but real, diagnosable mental illness.
I want to get to that disease in a minute -- and the cause of it too - but
first let's examine what some people claim to believe in and the mountains
of sand one has to carry in order to bury one's head so deep.
Man on the Moon
Several years ago, I was having lunch with some co-workers and the subject
of the Loch Ness Monster came up. They seemed genuinely amazed that I was so
certain that it did not exist. I pointed out that an air-breathing
plesiosaur would have to surface for air so often that its "reality" would
be as much in doubt as that of whales or dolphins. Also, there are
essentially no fish in Loch Ness, so it has nothing to eat. The most famous
photo of it is a known fake. It's a no-brainer. Not that I couldn't be
convinced I was wrong, I added. But I would want to pet the damn thing, or
at least stand on the carcass with my hands clasped in the air.
This shocking position got me an invitation to meet "Joe" (might be his real
name; I frankly don't remember). Joe is a friend of one of my colleagues.
Joe, I was told, is one of the most well-respected paranormal researchers in
the world, and as it turned out, he lived a few blocks from me.
Would I be willing to debate him?
I said yes, of course - and for a reason that I later came to regret. I said
yes not because I felt some need to set this guy right, but rather because I
hoped he might have something really interesting, something that might cause
me to change my mind.
I met him at his apartment: the kind of musty, cluttered, book-filled room I
had seen before and come to expect. There were two others in the room. We
shook hands. He was a nice enough guy.
"So whatcha got?"
He pulls out a videotape. Buzz is holding the flag. Neil takes a picture.
Buzz lets go of the flag pole.and the flag waves! In the breeze! Fake! Fake!
The mask slips!
You ever played golf, Joe? I ask. He has not. I tell him that the flag pole
is very long, very thin, like the pin on a green. Touch that and let it go
and it will wobble precisely the same way, like a giant guitar string. It's
got nothing to do with air.
What else have you got?
He's got stills from the lunar surface. Where are the stars? Huh? Skeptic
Boy? I thought you could see stars in space. Why don't we see any in the
picture? I ask him to imagine he is on a dark road in the middle of a black
night. A car is approaching with its high beams glaring. What does the
grille look like?
He doesn't get the analogy. I have to explain that you can't see the grille
because the lights are too bright. Your eyes (or the camera) stop down - the
iris constricts - so that you can comfortably view the bright lights.
Likewise, on the moon, the camera is exposed to see the bright lunar
landscape, or the brilliant blue Earth. The stars are too dim to register.
There are no stars visible in virtually any photo taken in earth orbit,
either - not behind the shuttle, or the space station.
This is a sign it is not a fake, because while it is logical it's also
somewhat unexpected. A hoaxer would almost certainly add stars. All of the
paintings that preceded the actual landing show a lunar sky ablaze with
stars. This was something no one realized until we got there.
He had scores of criticisms, all of which were specious and which have been
refuted in excruciating detail. I'll spare you the half-hour spent looking
at lighting differences and the position of suspicious shadows and cut to
the chase here.
Watch Buzz walk, I tell him. See the dust at his feet. Look at that
carefully. See how it sprays like water? Very fine dust spraying like a
water skier's wake?
In an atmosphere - like on a sound stage - very fine dust is lifted by the
air into a dust cloud, and we all know what a little dust cloud looks like.
What you are seeing when you watch those dust trails are very small
particles moving in a low-gravity vacuum. I tell him - not that he believes
me - that it is a tougher engineering challenge to make an area the size of
a movie lot into a perfect vacuum than it is to actually go to the moon.
Now it's my turn to ask some questions, and here's where it goes from the
ridiculous to the sublime:
I was there at Cape Kennedy for the launch of Apollo 13. Is he saying I am
lying about this whole moon mission conspiracy? I and millions of others who
stood there and saw those Saturn V's climb into the sky?
Of course not, says Joe. They actually launched. The astronauts just stayed
in earth orbit the whole time.
I see. So we have the technical expertise to build a 40-story rocket that
can produce millions of pounds of thrust. We can build capsules and lunar
landers that function in zero-G. We have the means and the will to put these
massive objects into Earth orbit, keep them up there for two weeks, but the
additional 3-4% of the total launch energy needed to send this package to
the moon is so obviously beyond our technical skill that the whole thing
must be a hoax?
I'm sorry, that's the thinking of someone who is mentally ill. There is
something deeper at work there.
That "something" is different than someone who "believes" in UFO's or the
Loch Ness Monster. Such people may be short on critical reasoning, but the
emotional force that drives them is a desire for wonder and the magical.
Many have remarked that this is, indeed, almost a religious impulse. I've
wanted to see a real-live flying saucer my entire life. Likewise, if Nessie
really existed, what an incredible sight that would be.to look upon the last
surviving dinosaur in the flesh! But a videotape of a standing wave shot
from five miles away does not outweigh the whole air-breather / no fish
evidence. It does not come close to outweighing it. And so I reluctantly
throw Nessie back into the superstition bin from whence she came.
But these denialists - the Moon Hoaxers and the 9/11 "Truthers" - these are
a different breed. And they are cut from precisely the same cloth. That is
to say, they suffer from the same disease: an unwillingness to face reality
and its consequences.
My evening with Joe was very illuminative. After the moon hoax came the
following, depending on your point of view:
Alien blobs surrounding the Space Shuttle OR a negative image videotape of a
blurry object at the bottom of an aquarium.
UFO squadrons flying in close formation OR distant geese at the limit of a
digital zoom slowed to 5 frames per second.
A giant, manned American space station in orbit around Mars OR a still frame
from NASA's 1976 Viking animation.
Otherworldly "rods" darting invisibly through the skies of our planet OR
individual frames of a large insect leaving a blurry video trail as it
whizzes past the lens.
Every time I would identify one of these great mysteries, Joe had the same
response: okay, but what about this! No fight, no defense - nothing. And
then we'd be on to some new blur or smudge that proved, incontrovertibly,
that this "reality" we live in is a giant lie, and that we are all victims
of Dark Forces moving beyond our control or even our awareness. and that
while the sleepwalking sheeple go on with our corporate-controlled lives the
mysterious wheels of the Shadow Government turn inexorably onward, crushing
those brave few individuals who are on to the whole horrid plot like so many
ants.
There is a word for this diseased mental state. It begins with a "P" and if
you blurted out "progressive" then shame on you, you horrible bigot. That
may be a correlation without causality.
As I was leaving Joe's, he said something I'm sure he thought was very
funny. He said, "Man, I'll bet a guy like you thinks Lee Harvey Oswald
really shot JFK."
Of course he shot JFK, Joe. Who do you think did it? The American Beef
Council?
Joe looked at me the way I had been looking at him. That is to say, he
simply could not process that I could hold such a belief in my head.
You're serious?
I'm dead serious. I recommended Case Closed, by Gerald Posner - without
question the best piece of critical reasoning, research and logic I have
ever read, bar none.
I suspect he did not follow my advice. Books like that are bad for his
business.
Man, you're out there, said Joe.
You know, the sad thing is, I'm starting to believe he is right.

A quick aside.
Back around 1989 or so, I had just moved to LA and was working the night
shift as a limousine driver. I had a miserable little apartment in North
Hollywood. I had heard of a book that had published the autopsy pictures of
President Kennedy, and how it contained compelling evidence of a conspiracy.
It was called Best Evidence and I bought it.
It doesn't rain often in Los Angeles, but it rained the night I read that
book. Its author, David Lifton, claimed that Kennedy was shot from the
front, but then the body was secretly taken from Air Force One to Walter
Reed Army Hospital where extensive surgery "reversed" the trajectory of the
wounds to make it look like poor patsy Oswald was the real assassin.
When I finally got to the payoff a shot of electricity went through me. I
realized that I was now

That was great!  Not sure what it's doing here in RAS, but I enjoyed it.
Scares me to death that there are people who believe this crap.

Sheesh Mr McCorkle, i've got that Mitch troll in my killfile so i don't have
to wade through his blubber. Do you really need to full-quote him? At least
stick an "OT" to the subject, so the non sim stuff can go unnoticed. Thanks.
:-)

Hey, I resent that!  I'm my own wacko thank you very much.  And Cris,
perhaps you didn't notice the word SNIP in my post, but it represented
98% of the original post.

I totally agree with that, too. DonM is his very own wacko in his own
right, but no comparison to Mitch when it comes to being totally off
one's rocker. Sorry for the full quote, but at least I bottom-posted ;-)

All the best, uwe
