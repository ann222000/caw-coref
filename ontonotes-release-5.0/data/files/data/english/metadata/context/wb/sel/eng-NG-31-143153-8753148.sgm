Ron Paul was on O'Reilly this evening.  He was asked about the threat
that Iran was to the US.

His answer was incoherent and rambling.  He had no reasonable approach.
He evaded answering several simple questions.  He lived up to my other
viewings of him.

IMNSHO, he is not qualified to be Commander in Chief.  I would make a
better CiC.  There are lots of truly fine people who would not make a
good CiC, nor a good President.

As usual, YMMV.

I didn't have any problems with anything RP said.  All BoR did was
have RP on in order to yell at him.  BoR wouldn't even let him talk.
Nothing personal, but I don't have much respect for the way Fox has
interviews.  They never let anyone talk.  If you want to see the
interview, you can find a link to it below:

How do you know? My take was somewhat different, even though I am not a

Jonathan, thank you for this link so that I could watch the interview with Dr. Paul.

Jon, I don't know what you saw.  Perhaps something different from what I just watched.

Dr. Paul was right on the money with his analysis of Saudi Arabia and Iran.  The people of Iran are
generally a good people.  I have believed that for a long time, ever since I studied Iran in a
US-Foreign Policy class in high school.  All the evidence points to the Iranian people being good
people.  I used to work at a coin laundromat next door to a deli run by two of the nicest guys you
could ever meet (I think my sister actually had a part time job with them for a while) who called
themselves &quot;Persian&quot; because of the negative bias against their country.  I also had an Iranian
economics professor who was one of the funniest and most knowledgeable economists I ever knew.  Iran
is a country in which the US government, using the CIA, has subverted the right of the people of that
country to choose a government of their choosing.  That is why we have the problem with the Iranian
*government* that we do.  (And this in another example of how the &quot;people&quot; of a given nation and the
&quot;government&quot; of that same nation can be, indeed oftentimes should be, considered separate.)  If the
people had not come under such an oppressive government as they have, due in no small part to the
blowback resulting from installing the Shah, Iran would possibly be one of the US' strongest allies in
the region.

Dr. Paul knows that and tried to lay the blame on where it lies, with the Saudi Arabian people.  Sure,
the Saudi king may be an ally of the US, but Osama bin Ladin is from Saudi Arabia, the vast majority
of the 9-11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, and though the king may be an ally of the US, he
certainly is not an ally of the people who he rules over.  I remember in the days between 9-11 and
leading up to March 17, 2002 when Bush officially announced the war with Iraq, that I was kept hearing
stuff about Hussein and why the US had to go into Iraq.  But everything Bush said was much more
applicable to Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent, North Korea.  And yet we have done nothing in
Saudi Arabia or in North Korea.

I completely agree with what I saw Dr. Paul stating in this short time with Mr. O'Reilly.  I agree
with Jonathan's analysis that Mr. O'Reilly was trying to look good on his part.  But that's what these
shows are about to begin with.  They aren't to get any kind of information from the guests.  The stars
are not the guests, but the hosts.  Mr. O'Reilly, and I consider myself a fan of Mr. O'Reilly for the
most part, is known for yelling at guests and that's what he did here.

I'm still waiting for someone to show me a vote Dr. Paul has made in the past, or a proposition he has
made for the future, that is demonstrably unconstitutional, or for which his integrity would come into
question.

I think both O'Reilly and Ron Paul were amateurish in their words and
answers.  O'Reilly in that he was argumentative, and Paul because he was not
direct in his answers (such as talking about Saudi Arabia and Pakistan when
the question was about Iran).

While I don't think we should go into nation building everywhere, history
has shown it to be a useful tool to create allies and  eliminate future
enemies (a la WWII).  Perhaps we should not be doing it in Iraq, but we
definitely need to do it in Afghanistan, where there is nothing but poverty,
and a vacuum there will ensure Al Qaeda's return.

The successful nation building that took place after WWII took place only after the enemy was soundly
defeated.  I don't see any such kind of success taking place anywhere in the Middle East at this time.
I see a little here and a little there.  Like in Vietnam, instead of going in with the will to win, I
don't know why we're over there.

Had we not gotten off track with Iraq, but focused on Afghanistan, things
would be going well there. Instead, because Iraq became a poorly planned,
try-to-do-on-the-cheap enterprise, resources were taken away from
Afghanistan to try and fix Iraq and its current problems.

Had we focused this much money and energy on Afghanistan, it would
definitely be fixed by now with a decent infrastructure and a totally
defeated Taliban and Al Qaeda.

Actually, O'Reilly's consistent policy is that if he asks a
straightforward question, then if the guest doesn't answer it, he will
be interrupted.  Ron Paul was asked if he thought that Iran was a threat
to the US.  A tough but straightforward question.  Ron Paul rambled a
bit, then started on  a history lesson.  Paul was asked three times for
an answer to the same question, and Paul would not or could not give an
answer.

This is consistent with everything I have read, seen or heard by Paul.
He has no answer to these types of questions.  He has no answer to
dealing with Islamists other than to just go away and leave them alone,
and besides, we made them attack us.  Some, even some here on this list,
may agree with that.  The facts speak otherwise, clearly and convincingly.

O'Reilly was not boorish.  He simply refuses to provide a platform for
people to talk about something other that what the guest knows ahead of
time they will be asked.  And for the record, all Paul had to do was to
say yes, they are a threat to us, and then go on to say how he would
deal with them and also blame the US for Iran's actions, or say no, they
are not a threat, and explain why.  It is simple.  It is always this way
on O'Reilly.  Whoever is advising Paul did a poor job preparing him.

And Paul needs to come up with an answer to this question that deals
with the facts as they are.  Unfortunately, his philosophical premises
provide no guidance.  Principles endure throughout time.  Circumstances
and tactics do not.

All he had to do was to answer the question.  He refused.  So since you
agree with Paul, why don't you take a stab at it.

Is Iran a threat to the US?

I was fascinated by what Paul's eyes were doing when he was talking.
His eyes darted sideways back and forth, back and forth, left to right
to left, back and forth.   Knowing just a little about body language, it
was very curious to me.

Sometimes people move their eyes sideways back and forth when they are
composing their thoughts or thinking of what they will say next, but
that movement is more looking upward.   More often,  the eyes dart
side-to-side when they are lying; thus the old term &quot;shifty-eyed.&quot;    I
personally don't think Paul was composing his thoughts internally,
because what I heard coming from his mouth was a long string of typical
'talking points' I have heard hundreds of times in the last 15-20
years:  everything is America's fault; we are to blame for everything,
we did it wrong, we deserve it, the enemy is reasonable, we are the ones
who are unreasonable, etc., etc., etc. . . .

Watch the video and see what you think.

I have no problem with going in Iraq, except HOW Bush sent them in.
Rumsfeld try to go in on the cheap, ignoring General Collin Powell and many
other generals.  We should have gone in with 250,000 troops, quickly crushed
the opposition, contained the entire nation, and been able to get out in a
year or two - without having Sunni, Sh'ia, or Al Qaeda opposition occurring
ever since.

Since Bush bumbled it, Iraq has gotten us off track from our search and
destroy mission of terrorists.  We are now more focused on preventing a
civil war in Iraq than we are in stopping terrorists.  That is what I mean
by &quot;off track.&quot;

Because we bumbled in Iraq, we've been forced to use huge amounts of
resources there. This has forced us to pull back resources from Afghanistan,
kept us from being a &quot;real threat&quot; to Syria or Iran in their continued
terrorist activities (such as having Hezbollah take over the Gaza Strip by
force), or stopping activities elsewhere.  A 2 year successful war and
rebuilding there, with troops now able to come home, with fewer casualties,
would have been preferable to the quagmire we now are in.  Our troops are
doing admirably, but they should have had reinforced armored vehicles a long
time ago (Rumsfeld said they didn't need it), and General Petraeus and
others in DoD are now saying we cannot maintain the surge for more than 6
more months.  If the Iraqi government doesn't step up by then, do we begin
packing up and leaving, with Al Qaeda and radicals waiting in the wings to
stir things up again?  What good is the surge, if it can't be sustained
until Iraq can fully get back on their feet?  It might give them a breather,
but it endangers more of our troops needlessly, because a true solution
(Iraq getting its own act together) is still not in sight.

I like what Camille Paglia said about it.  If we pull out now, we will have
to return in 5-10 years. But then we can just go in from 40,000 feet and do
things right the first time around, like we did in WWII.  Bombing the bad
guys into the stone age every 5-10 years is a lot cheaper in money and
manpower than to do what we are now doing.

You (and as you claim, Mr. O'Reilly) want a simple yes or no to a question that cannot take a simple
yes or no.

As the question is stated, I believe that Iran's government is an indirect threat to the US.  So yes.

But I agree with Dr. Paul in that I believe the Saudi Arabian people (in general - I'm sure there are
some good people over there) are a bigger threat than the Iranian government, whose people I believe
(in general - I'm sure there are some bad people over there) are good.

But you made the point about Mr. O'Reilly that he expects answers to his questions, and then you

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.foxnews.com/oreilly/index.html

&gt;&gt; Jonathan, thank you for this link so that I could watch the
&gt;&gt; interview with Dr. Paul.

&gt;&gt; Jon, I don't know what you saw.  Perhaps something different from
&gt;&gt; what I just watched.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Paul was right on the money with his analysis of Saudi Arabia
&gt;&gt; and Iran.  The people of Iran are
&gt;&gt; generally a good people.  I have believed that for a long time,
&gt;&gt; ever since I studied Iran in a
&gt;&gt; US-Foreign Policy class in high school.  All the evidence points
&gt;&gt; to the Iranian people being good
&gt;&gt; people.  I used to work at a coin laundromat next door to a deli
&gt;&gt; run by two of the nicest guys you
&gt;&gt; could ever meet (I think my sister actually had a part time job
&gt;&gt; with them for a while) who called
&gt;&gt; themselves &quot;Persian&quot; because of the negative bias against their
&gt;&gt; country.  I also had an Iranian
&gt;&gt; economics professor who was one of the funniest and most
&gt;&gt; knowledgeable economists I ever knew.  Iran
&gt;&gt; is a country in which the US government, using the CIA, has
&gt;&gt; subverted the right of the people of that
&gt;&gt; country to choose a government of their choosing.  That is why we
&gt;&gt; have the problem with the Iranian
&gt;&gt; *government* that we do.  (And this in another example of how the
&gt;&gt; &quot;people&quot; of a given nation and the
&gt;&gt; &quot;government&quot; of that same nation can be, indeed oftentimes should
&gt;&gt; be, considered separate.)  If the
&gt;&gt; people had not come under such an oppressive government as they
&gt;&gt; have, due in no small part to the
&gt;&gt; blowback resulting from installing the Shah, Iran would possibly
&gt;&gt; be one of the US' strongest allies in
&gt;&gt; the region.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Paul knows that and tried to lay the blame on where it lies,
&gt;&gt; with the Saudi Arabian people.  Sure,
&gt;&gt; the Saudi king may be an ally of the US, but Osama bin Ladin is
&gt;&gt; from Saudi Arabia, the vast majority
&gt;&gt; of the 9-11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, and though the king
&gt;&gt; may be an ally of the US, he
&gt;&gt; certainly is not an ally of the people who he rules over.  I
&gt;&gt; remember in the days between 9-11 and
&gt;&gt; leading up to March 17, 2002 when Bush officially announced the
&gt;&gt; war with Iraq, that I was kept hearing
&gt;&gt; stuff about Hussein and why the US had to go into Iraq.  But
&gt;&gt; everything Bush said was much more
&gt;&gt; applicable to Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent, North Korea.
&gt;&gt; And yet we have done nothing in
&gt;&gt; Saudi Arabia or in North Korea.

&gt;&gt; I completely agree with what I saw Dr. Paul stating in this short
&gt;&gt; time with Mr. O'Reilly.  I agree
&gt;&gt; with Jonathan's analysis that Mr. O'Reilly was trying to look good
&gt;&gt; on his part.  But that's what these
&gt;&gt; shows are about to begin with.  They aren't to get any kind of
&gt;&gt; information from the guests.  The stars
&gt;&gt; are not the guests, but the hosts.  Mr. O'Reilly, and I consider
&gt;&gt; myself a fan of Mr. O'Reilly for the
&gt;&gt; most part, is known for yelling at guests and that's what he did
&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt; I'm still waiting for someone to show me a vote Dr. Paul has made
&gt;&gt; in the past, or a proposition he has
&gt;&gt; made for the future, that is demonstrably unconstitutional, or for
&gt;&gt; which his integrity would come into
&gt;&gt; question.

Why shold O'Reilly come up with better questions? It is his show!  If a
candidate comes on a person's show, shouldn't they expect to respond to the
things the host will probably ask him?  If Ron Paul wanted soft balls tossed
at him, he should have gone on some pro-Libertarian show.  Then again, not
Neal Boortz, because Boortz would have harangued him over Iraq and
terrorism.

The world isn't the same as it was in 1789.  The oceans are no longer the
defensible walls they once were. Terrorists do have access to some very
deadly technologies today - just look at what 4 jet airliners did.  Now,
there are effective and ineffective ways to deal with these things. We've
seen both effective and ineffective methods used by Clinton and Bush -
hopefully we'll learn, and learn quickly, to handle things right.

Ron Paul offered no true solution to the terrorist issue.  Sending out
bounty hunters has proven ineffective in the past, as it cannot find
everyone that is in a terrorist cell; or in all terrorist cells. This past
group of terrorists in England would not have been caught prior to their
assault, had we depended on letters of marque.  Yet, if we were to
disassemble the FBI and CIA, we would end up finding bad guys after the
fact, instead of being preemptive and catching them in the planning stage.

Although Ron Paul might have urged that we get rid of the FBI and the CIA, a
careful reading of Paul's statements would enlighten you to the fact that
Ron Paul has never advocated getting rid of our foreign or domestic security
in either Federal Police powers or intelligence (spying). For one thing he
would advocate bringing back in some form the House Un-American Activities
Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Both were abolished
(I believe in the sixties) and both were objects of a pleading by Ezra Taft
Benson that they remain.

Further, Ron Paul would (I'm sure) highly advocate that each branch of the
military highly develop and improve the intelligence gathering capabilities.
Ron Paul is former military and understands the need for intelligence
gathering.

Still further, Ron Paul (I'm sure) would highly advocate that each state of
the Union highly develop and improve their intelligence gathering
capability. Such as California used to have with their California Senate
Fact Finding Committee on Un-American Activities but which has since been
abolished (wonder why?).

The argument against Ron Paul that he would paralyze the United States by
abolishing the FBI or CIA is simply a deflection meant to marginalize Ron
Paul and make him look like an idiot. But the real idiots are those who
believe such arguments and fail to closely look at the issues.

I was looking for some serious answers/discussion.  Perhaps I don't
understand the issues well enough to ask intelligent questions.  While
I think the US tax and health care systems are in need of serious work
and/or overhaul, I don't think just doing away with them is a viable
answer.

Take Medicare, for example.  What does Ron Paul suggest we do?  Remove
it?  Reform it?  Amend it?  What?  I hear his supporters saying (I
haven't actually heard the words from his mouth) that Medicare is bad.
Whether I agree or disagree, I have not heard a plan of what to do
about all the people who rely on it presently.  Where is the
implementation.  I've heard the high-level stump talk, now I want to
hear about the implementation.

Abolishing the IRS would do nothing to impact Federal Spending. Congress
would continue to spend and spend. Right now we are running a deficit. Which
means that the government spends more than it receives in tax receipts. It
gets this money by printing more paper money and putting up a bond to pay
for it. So getting rid of the IRS and any and all taxes would have no
impact. It could just print and print all the money it needs.

As far as Medicare--I believe I already answered that question in a previous
post. I say abolish it entirely and as quickly as possible. Sometimes the
best method for healing is removing the encumbering bandages as fast as
possible. A quick &quot;ouch&quot; and then its all over.

But then you don't really want to hear from me, from Ron Paul, Cousin Oscar
or anyone else on this issue. We as a people have been taught correct
governmental principles over the years but we are either too dumb, stupid,
ignorant or wicked to accept it.

I believe this is incorrect. If the government simply prints up more

That &quot;quick ouch&quot; is the pain, misery, and death of thousands.

In the long run, we're all dead, anyway. So does that mean we should
avoid spending time, effort, and money to improve our lot right now?
The idea that future generations may be incrementally better off if we
commit mass suicide now is not sufficient reason to do so, at least in
my mind. The suffering of people in the here and now counts for as
much as the suffering of people a hundred years from now. In my view,
cutting off Medicare would essentially be a form of mass suicide, or
at least homicide. Even if you think Medicare is morally and ethically
wrong, you shouldn't just cut it off, any more than you should just
cut off all welfare payments to people who have never learned to hold
a job or fend for themselves.

Or periods like the great depression where great contractions of credit
occurred.  In fact, it was a tightening of credit that was responsible for
the great depression. Oh yeah. I forgot. It was the machinations of the

The IRS and the Federal Reserve were meant by the PTB to work hand in hand
with each other. Both should be abolished together.

Not necessarily. I have faith that the kindness and generosity of my fellow

happen. We are the most generous nation on earth. Shouldn't we also be

Jeff, and others, I don't feel that you are any of those things.  Well, perhaps ignorant, but I don't
think being ignorant is a bad thing, unless you are willfully ignorant.  There are many subjects on
which I am ignorant.  Some of them interest me and I try to learn more.  Others I couldn't care less
about.

I hope I haven't offended anyone by calling them dumb, stupid or wicked.  I'm simply trying to give
