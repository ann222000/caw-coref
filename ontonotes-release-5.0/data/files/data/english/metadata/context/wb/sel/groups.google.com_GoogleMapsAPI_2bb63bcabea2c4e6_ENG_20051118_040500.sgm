Distance calculator?

I am looking for a distance calculator for our local bike group. I just
want the users to be able to type in two different addresses and then
have it spit out the riding distance between them.

A map would be nice but not required. Would GM be overkill for what I
want?

I am a total PHP / JS newbie. Anyone know of a simple &quot;drop in&quot; script
I can use for this?

Thanks in advance for any help or websites you can point me to!

If you pass the two addresses to the Google Local route finder it will
tell you the distance of the route that it suggests.

See   for details
of parameters you can pass to Google Local. In particular you'd be
interested in the sadr and dadr parameters.

If you want to draw your own route and measure that, you can use

It's designed for runners, but will work just as well for cyclists.

Mike,

Thanks for the link, but I'd rather keep the members on my site instead
of pushing them to Google's map site for the distance.

Any other suggestions?

Chris Soak's EXCELLENT XMaps will calcualte the distance between two
points for you.
If you plot a polyline as the route to be taken then calculate the
distance between each point of the polyline and the next you will get a
distance.
