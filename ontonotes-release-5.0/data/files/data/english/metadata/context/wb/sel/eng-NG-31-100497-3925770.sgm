I just can't believe that a limited production car of 2000 with just 75,000
miles is not worth more than $3,100 in excellent condition. I'm sure that
his figures are based on real-world sales, though. I guess the Fiero is
just not yet a *real* collector's car...
I would think the Indy cars will be worth ALOT more than that in the near
future. (but then again I always thought they would bring alot more than
they do after 20 years.)

A lot more is made about a car's collection value than holds up in
reality. I have Fieros I can't even GIVE away. An Indy is rare by
production standards but even if 1,000 are still around in some sort of
condition, it will be the ones with the least amount of mileage and wear
and tear that get any sort of bucks from a collector.

An 88 GT sold for about $16,000 fully optioned. At least the one I saw
in the showroom when I bought my first Fiero cost that. If you put it in
a garage back then and didn't use it, you might be able to get about
that for it now. Perhaps a bit more... but certainly you could have made
more money in the stock market or your 401K.

These cars are not rare enough or old enough to rake in much cash yet.
Best thing is to drive and enjoy them until they are dead. Thenn buy a
few moore and build another good one. If you have a really nice one that
might be worth something some day, put it in a heated garage and don't
use it for ten years. That is not putting the car to its best use
though: it AND you, will be ten years older and inflation will have
probably gobbled up any profit you might make.

Nope! get it out on the road and enjoy it. There's garage queens out
there just waiting to steal your thunder and those people have the bucks
to wait you out. :-)

My problem with finding a Fiero in good shape is that most of the people who
have them want top dollar for them as in more than KBB even says for mint
conditioned ones.  I find myself unwilling to spend more than 8 grand on a
1988 GT in decent shape with no mods (all stock), all I want is PW and MT.
I have found an AT for 5 grand, but not what I want :(.  I found a MT for
9.5 that I would buy if I had the money but just bought myself my first new
car a few months ago (2004 Malibu Classic) also my first GM, I love it and
wouldnt think of getting anything else after owning it, I for some reason
thought I would hate a domestic and had alwasy driven imports, now I wouldnt
even think of going back.  This Chevy is so much nicer than any of the
Hondas or Nissans I have owned, also better than the 2005 Toyota I test
drove.  My only complaint is road noise is a bit high.

Sean,
I think that most people selling their Fieros don't really want to sell
them. That's part of why they ask well over book for them. They want you the
buyer to supply them with that extra excuse to part with the thing. Also,
only a previous Fiero owner will pay these inflated prices. Back in 96 I let
my wife talk me into selling my first 88 GT, and for 8 years all I could
think about was getting another one. Finally this past summer it came to be.
("She'll have to pry the steering wheel out of my cold dead hands this time
around!")
On the subject of resale values. I think that if any of us could travel
back in time and take a wad of cash with us, we'd buy two copies of our
Fieros. One to enjoy, and one as an investment to stash away. But in the
present reality, I think that our cars are just now beginning to turn the
corner. In fact, given the current aftermarket support, now looks like the
optimum time to buy a Fiero and restore it. If you don't drive the wheels
off of it again in the next ten years or so it may be worth something. On
the subject of the Indy model. I think Pontiac blew it! If the production
cars truly resembled the car that paced the track, buyers would have been
trampling over each other to get at one. Just putting on those nifty chrome
wheels would have made a difference. But that engine would have put the car
over the top.
Next, I was very gratified to hear that you are a new convert to the
Yankee side of the automotive equation. 75 % of our nations economic woes
would be cured if Americans bought just one specific domestic product. CARS!
There was once a statistic published that stated "one in seven American jobs
can be traced back to this country's auto industry. What a powerful concept
when you think about it! Of course a lot has changed since then. Today
Detroit has a minority share of the market, and our cars have a lot of
imported parts in them, so the stat must now be half of what it was or
worse. So I truly wish you the best of luck with that new Chevy.
Martin
