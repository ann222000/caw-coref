My brother just had half a lung removed this morning due to cancer.  They
won't know until next week what the course of treatment will be (chemo,
radiation, etc.).  He may have a hard time being able to eat food.
L-glutamine powder served my father well when he was undergoing chemo.
Hopefully he won't have to.

Friends from his office have said they'll be bringing over casseroles and
such.  Sort of like a &quot;dead spread&quot; (I credit Barb with that term, except
he's not dead.)  I expect lots of egg or pasta salad type things.

He has no food restrictions and the doctor I spoke with said it's good for
him to be up and moving around but he will tire easily so the more help and
easy to make foods the better.  Gee, what a great time for me to not have to
worry about reporting to work!

So, I was thinking of some breakfast casseroles.  He can easily make toast
and eggs, but what about some &quot;breakfast pizzas&quot;?  I'm thinking English
muffins with very lightly scrambled egg, bacon &amp; cheese on top.  Something
he can just stick in the microwave.

I also have a skillet breakfast which dates back to the 1970's, adapted from
something our mom made.  You brown some grated potatoes (hash browns as
opposed to home fries), cut the browned potatoes into quarters.  Whisk 4
eggs and pour it over the crispy browned potatoes.  Add some crumbled bacon
and top with cheese.  Season with S&amp;P.  Hot sauce, maybe?  Cook until the
mixture is set.

I'll bring him some soup.  I'm good at that.

Fish is always rejuvenating IMO for those undergoing prolonged medical
treatment; and often overlooked.

Something light in the fish/soup department - served steaming hot so sipping
and enjoyment is prolonged.

Jill,

Sorry to hear the sad news.

I'd make a batch of my artichoke Vegelaya for him but it's probably not the
comfort food he'd like.

Hope he can get well soon.

When Beck was in high school she loved the 'breakfast souffles' -- bread
soaked in a custard mix, then baked.  I had some small bakers  (maybe
4-5&quot; diameter) and would occasionally put one together for her at night
with instructions for baking in the morning -- she could pop it in the
oven while she showered and it would be ready when she was done.  I
don't have a recipe other than my recollection that I'd butter the
baking dish, put in about a slice of cubed or torn bread, some meat
(diced ham, crumbled bacon), some shredded cheese, and pour the egg-milk
mixture over.  Cover and refrigerate overnight or several hours (for the
bread to absorb the liquid then bake (20 minutes at 350?  Whatever seems
right.  Some help, huh?) uncovered.  It will puff up.

I have found that the little pudding cups and jello cups available at the
grocery store are very helpful.  Also Ramen noodles, power bars and canned
soups.  Check around on the power bars and try to present a variety.  They
need not be hunks of goo gluing a bunch of grains together.  I know it
doesn't sound healthful, but many times it is the necessity of being able to
consume calories to avoid alarming weight loss, coupled with not being able
to prepare (just too darn weary) a meal.  The deal is, you already know that
you aren't going to eat but a tiny amount, you want something with a
pleasant mouth feel, something cool and soothing or warm and soothing and
yet with flavor.  Having these prepared foods in the house means that you
can eat something on the spur of the moment with very little effort.  The
hospital dietician will tell you to eat tiny amounts at a time -- 1/2 cup --
and eat frequently, if you can.  If he likes cottage cheese, also keep that
on hand.  Also crackers, but make sure there is a variety, because what
tastes good today may not taste good tomorrow.  Foods that have onions or
garlic probably will taste good going down, but leave a lingering aftertaste
that is distressing.  Foods that have more than a minimum of fats or oils
may also cause problems.  Really plain food is going to be best.  Small cans
of juice may or may not be something he can tolerate.  Strongly flavored
meat like bacon, ham or sausage may not sit well....    Get some bottles of
vitamin water.  It can be consumed a little at a time.  Get several
different flavors.   Check with the hospital dietician.  He/she will be able
to guide you and also have booklets of recipes.  If I think of anything
else. I'll write more.

I'm not sure he's big into canned tuna, I know I'm not.  But I can certainly

Y'all have my prayers as well. My DH is going in Tuesday for the same upper

moved at lightspeed on this. Their prognosis is good, but we still take
turns falling apart.

It depends.  Surgery has  a depressing effect on the appetite.  As long as
he is served something that can be consumed in small amounts.  Immediately
after hospital will be when he has the best tolerance for a variety of
comfort foods.  If and when he begins chemo or radiation, eating still may
be tolerable.  However, the effects of these treatments are unpredictable
and do not stop simply because the treatment has stopped.  The treatment
kills cells, good ones as well as the bad ones and he may or may not
experience eating issues during and after the treatments.

I got to thinking - frozen berries are strongly antioxidant and
flavorsome as well. A person could put a few berries on cottage cheese
or nibble them nice and cold. Does Bro have a blender? You might
make him some soothing smoothies, sweet to taste. Throw in some
extra powdered milk or protein powder to help with recovery.
Or tofu when he's not looking... :0
Have a little cheese already cut into small pieces. Maybe some
string cheese we pack in lunches, that's pretty mild. I don't like the
low fat versions, they aren't too fatty to begin with.
Thanks for the discussion, things I need to plan for also.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll bring him some soup.  I'm good at that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jill

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fish is always rejuvenating IMO for those undergoing prolonged
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; medical treatment; and often overlooked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something light in the fish/soup department - served steaming hot so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sipping and enjoyment is prolonged.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dee Dee
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.  Fish is good if simply prepared.  Canned tuna may or not be
&gt;&gt;&gt; agreeable. Janet

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure he's big into canned tuna, I know I'm not.  But I can
&gt;&gt; certainly
&gt;&gt; bake some really nice fish dishes.  Just got some mahi-mahi and some cod
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; couple of days ago.

&gt;&gt; As for soups, I bought some butternut squash so I can make one of my
&gt;&gt; signature dishes, roasted butternut squash soup.  It's a good fall soup
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; goes well with a nice warmed crusty bread.

&gt;&gt; His co-workers are planning to bring by pasta salads and the like.  He's
&gt;&gt; probably going to want something more substantial after eating hospital
&gt;&gt; food
&gt;&gt; for a few days.

&gt;&gt; Jill

&gt; It depends.  Surgery has  a depressing effect on the appetite.  As long as
&gt; he is served something that can be consumed in small amounts.  Immediately
&gt; after hospital will be when he has the best tolerance for a variety of
&gt; comfort foods.  If and when he begins chemo or radiation, eating still may
&gt; be tolerable.  However, the effects of these treatments are unpredictable
&gt; and do not stop simply because the treatment has stopped.  The treatment
&gt; kills cells, good ones as well as the bad ones and he may or may not
&gt; experience eating issues during and after the treatments.
&gt; Janet

My hospital had a menu that you could order from.  I ordered things like a
side of pickles, steamed broccoli, yogurt, potato chips, sandwiches, potato
salad, fruit plate, soup,ginger ale.  Odd stuff.  The menu was for the whole
hospital, not just my  area.  They had wonderful sounding stuff on it.
Portabella burgers, fritatta, oh heck, I can't remember all the variety of
things.  Today kind of food offerings as well as old standards.  I do
remember that you could order a lot of things just the way you wanted them,
but none of it interested me.  I wanted cool in my mouth, something sweet
and something salty.  There was no separate charge for any of these foods,
it was all included in the daily room charge, so I wasn't limited by cost.
But, I would order the pickles, yogurt and broccoli for one meal and only be
able to pick at it.  What I'm trying to say is, don't get your feelings hurt
if your brother doesn't do justice to your offerings.  He just may not feel
like eating at all.
Best wishes to you both.

This happened to me after my last surgery.  Many times I could barely
pick at my meal.  And when I got home, the same thing happend: I could
barely eat.

Part of it was the pain meds I was on.  Some of them slow down the
intestinal tract, and part of the result was that I just wasn't hungry
at all.

It was probably a month or so before I started really wanting to eat
normally again.

Don't know if this will happen to your brother or not, but don't be
surprised if he isn't really that hungry.  And if he has to do chemo,
it might really affect his appetite.  Go by his cues then..as to what
he might want to eat or not eat.  He might surprise you..he might want
something totally out of the blue, that you would have never imagined
him wanting.

I think I craved milk in large quantities for quite a few weeks after
my surgery.  Food not so much, but milk..I could go through a gallon
or so every few days.   After a while, it slacked off...

I like Bed Spread for those who are ill and Dead Spread for funeral
gatherings.

Jill... I thought soup would be what my friend, who was terminally ill
and I was helping to take care of her, would like and it just didn't
go over well at all. It was very distressing to me. I am just
mentioning that so you don't get your feelings hurt. It was surprising
to find out what was enjoyed and successful. One day it was ice chips,
or frozen juice chips, the next it was cheese souffle or spaghetti.

Your brother is going to get better so this will be temporary. Just
listen to what he says is craving and don't just give him what you
think he needs. iow, if Peppermint Schnapps is the request, go for it.
That's what I did...

My dad had no appetite after his surgery and my mom was working evenings
so I'd go over there and make sure he ate some supper.  Comfort foods
went over well.  Homemade applesauce, pot pies made with leftover
chicken or pork, mashed potatoes and gravy, everything well seasoned, as
much for the smell (to stimulate appetite) as the taste.

I also took advantage of his depression-era upbringing.  Left to his own
devices he'd serve himself a tiny scoop of everything and call it good.
I discovered, though, that if I left him sitting in his recliner in
the living room and made him up a plate with reasonable servings of
everything he'd finish it all out of reflex.  YMMV.

I always made enough that my mom could have a late supper when she got
home from work.

I don't know how much difference it really made, but it made me feel a
little better.

How about Sofa Picnic? Recliner Repast? Bed Snacks?

Soup's kinda hard to eat if you're laying down, too. Thinking burrito
thingies, rollups, either in little tortillas or lettuce leaves. Spring
rolls. Rice (or rice pudding) might be good, protein in the custard &amp; rice.
Veggie sushi-type things? One thing I learned is that you never know what is
truly repulsive until you try to eat it after surgery. One never knows. The
DH loves pizza, so I'll get him some frozen pizza snacks. It's just too much
for me to think about actually making things beyond chicken salad. Which
actually sounds good to me - fresh herbs, etc.

&gt; worry about reporting to work!

&gt; So, I was thinking of some breakfast casseroles.  He can easily make toast
&gt; and eggs, but what about some &quot;breakfast pizzas&quot;?  I'm thinking English
&gt; muffins with very lightly scrambled egg, bacon &amp; cheese on top.  Something
&gt; he can just stick in the microwave.

&gt; I also have a skillet breakfast which dates back to the 1970's, adapted from
&gt; something our mom made.  You brown some grated potatoes (hash browns as
&gt; opposed to home fries), cut the browned potatoes into quarters.  Whisk 4
&gt; eggs and pour it over the crispy browned potatoes.  Add some crumbled bacon
&gt; and top with cheese.  Season with S&amp;P.  Hot sauce, maybe?  Cook until the
&gt; mixture is set.

&gt; I'll bring him some soup.  I'm good at that.

Hugs babe!

How about quiches? They generally re-heat well?

Soups like you planned are good, as are hearty, chunky stews that also
freeze well.

Those Ziplock/Glad/generic disposable containers are great for that sort
of thing.

Portions of roast chicken and steamed veggies might work also?

&gt; (clipped a lot)

&gt;  Get some bottles of

&gt;&gt; Janet
&gt; I got to thinking - frozen berries are strongly antioxidant and
&gt; flavorsome as well. A person could put a few berries on cottage cheese
&gt; or nibble them nice and cold. Does Bro have a blender? You might
&gt; make him some soothing smoothies, sweet to taste. Throw in some
&gt; extra powdered milk or protein powder to help with recovery.
&gt; Or tofu when he's not looking... :0
&gt;  Have a little cheese already cut into small pieces. Maybe some
&gt; string cheese we pack in lunches, that's pretty mild. I don't like the
&gt; low fat versions, they aren't too fatty to begin with.
&gt;  Thanks for the discussion, things I need to plan for also.
&gt; Edrena

I ate so many scrambled eggs, I have no desire to ever eat another one.  I
ate lots and lots of cheese with crackers.  That's something that can be
nibbled.  I got ferocious hunger attacks and that meant that I had to eat
NOW.  (midnight, 3 a.m.)  That's where the little pudding cups, etc. came in
handy.  I also got some of those little packages of crackers with
cheese/peanut butter.  I had never eaten any of this kind of thing before,
but they came in very handy.
Best wishes to you and family, Edrena.

I forgot to mention. . .the after surgery, but especially chemo/radiation,
the mind is just not the same for quite some time.  It is difficult to think
and memory is really iffy.  I mean, like, you get up out of your chair and
have no idea why.  I started keeping a pencil and paper beside the bed to
help me.  Every person that I have talked to about chemo/radiation and to a
lesser extent surgery, volunteers info about 'chemo brain.'  Don't stress
about it, it will get better but it takes time and you may never get back to
what you were, but you will be able to function very well.

Hey Jill,

You have some great hints in this thread I just thought I would throw in a
concern from the chick who has been operated almost as many times as I am
years old. =-)

Be mindful of what foods may sound really good but if they have to come back
up they may be terribly painful. Crunchy foods, nuts, al dente legumes, meat
that isn't cut into small pieces and may be swallowed with being chewed
well.

Just a thought. Though it may be rather a disgusting one, it's worth
considering.

Your brother is in my prayers.

All my best to you and your brother.

I have already seen many good ideas on this thread.  Soups, small
portions of comforting casseroles, quiche are all easy to freeze and
reheat.

You could bring over and freeze some hearty muffins or quick breads.
Those would be easy to microwave or toast.    You could make some
homemade hot pocket style freezer sandwiches by rolling out some
biscuit dough, filling with meats, cheese, veggies, folding it over
and crimping it shut, then baking.   Creamed chicken or chipped beef
is easy to reheat and eat over toast or biscuits.

I'm sure he'd prefer homemade soup to the canned variety.  He did mention

He ate a rather hearty meal of turkey &amp; dressing and was looking forward to
dinner when I visited him today.  So apparently this hasn't affected his
appetite.  He'll tire easily, yes.  That's a given.  His doctor says he'll
need some assistance for a couple of weeks.  I'll be there to help out with
basic chores.

His boss and a co-worker showed up to visit while I was there.  That was

The first thing he requested when I went to see him yesterday was to please
get him his toothbrush &amp; toothpaste out of his overnight bag.  He was still
in a &quot;recovery room&quot; in ICU.  Aside from a toilet there wasn't even a sink
but he had a pitcher of water and a cup.  He hadn't brushed his teeth in 2
days and said that made him feel horrible!  No kidding!

Yes, some moist towelettes will probably be something he would appreciate.
While the doctors say it's good for him to be up and around, he's probably
not going to feel like doing a lot of walking.  But they had written on a
white board in his room, tasks for today:  Walk.  He said he made it as far
as the chair and back.  I'm going to have to motivate him!

I don't think he'll need a &quot;sippy cup&quot; for soup.  He ate turkey &amp; dressing
for lunch yesterday, using a knife &amp; a fork just like anyone else.  Besides,
I'm just joshing about the soup.  I'm known for it, but he'll need more
substantial meals than that!  :)

&gt; This happened to me after my last surgery.  Many times I could barely

&gt; barely eat.

&gt; Part of it was the pain meds I was on.  Some of them slow down the

&gt; at all.

&gt; It was probably a month or so before I started really wanting to eat
&gt; normally again.

&gt; Don't know if this will happen to your brother or not, but don't be
&gt; surprised if he isn't really that hungry.  And if he has to do chemo,
&gt; it might really affect his appetite.  Go by his cues then..as to what
&gt; he might want to eat or not eat.  He might surprise you..he might want
&gt; something totally out of the blue, that you would have never imagined
&gt; him wanting.

&gt; I think I craved milk in large quantities for quite a few weeks after
&gt; my surgery.  Food not so much, but milk..I could go through a gallon
&gt; or so every few days.   After a while, it slacked off...

*Nodding*. My mother has little appetite even when she's well and it
really disappeared each time she was in hospital. She was always on
normal diet, so I used to eat her hospital meals but bring her things
she *would* eat. Did the same for my father.

It took me most of the summer to recover my appetite after surgery and
medications weren't an issue (wasn't taking any).

Soup is always good if he likes to eat that. Lean meats/fish are good;
he will need to keep up his proteins unless advised otherwise.

Used to marinate small chunks of lean pork or lamb then grill/broil
them. Serve with rice/pasta/potatoes and a small simple salad.

He ate a hearty lunch yesterday and was looking forward to dinner.  He's on
dilaudid (sp?) with one of those push button things he can use to give
himself pain meds as he feels necessary.  One of the things on the white

with routine chores like laundry than he will with meals.  Some of his

Thanks for the input, sweetie ;)  His appetite was good yesterday but I
don't know what the future will hold.  I'll just be there for him.  Run
errands, help him around the house, whatever it takes.  The doctor said
he'll need the most help the first week during his recovery.  I know you
know how that is!  Walking around isn't exactly comfortable right after
surgery.

Do not scoff, my dear. The DH has tremendous whiskers and I pour his morning
coffee in a travel cup made for the car. He calls it is grown up sippy cup.
He got tired of fighting his whiskers for his coffee. And beer.

That's great to hear, Arri!  Thanks for the encouragement.  They won't know
until next week if he will need chemo but the doctor was hopeful he won't.

I rarely use a lot of fat anyway, but it will be up to him what he wants to
eat.  I'm just there to help out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Soup is always good if he likes to eat that. Lean meats/fish are good;

I have some cod fillets in the freezer and also mahi-mahi.  He likes fish.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Used to marinate small chunks of lean pork or lamb then grill/broil

I'm not sure he likes lamb.  I love lamb.  When we were roommates back in
the 1980's I don't recall ever making lamb for us.  I'm sure I grilled (or
broiled) lamb chops for myself.  He absolutely loves pork chops so that's a
good item to add to my list.  Thank you!

That's what I mean about picking up on cues.  Some things may be
surprising as to what one craves after surgery.

I think my appetite was fair after surgery, at least for one or two
meals.  Then physical therapy started getting me up to first sit on
the edge of the bed, and then to walk with a walker, to the chair.  I
was a basket case after that, and lost whatever appetite I had.  Food
that seemed appealing before all that activity, was totally disgusting
after that.  I just was not hungry at all, and especially after the
physical therapist got me up up, it was just nauseating.

I can't remember what else I craved after surgery.   I remember the
milk though, and I got panicky when I got to less than a quart left.

My best friend here in town, had major surgery earlier in the year.
She started craving those slurpee like concoctions, and she would send
her visitors to go get them for her.

And several years ago...after another surgery, I was craving onion
soup.  Big time craving.  Fortunately I had some in the freezer and
got my helpers to heat it up for me.

Those cravings will come out of the blue.  I listen to them, thinking
that maybe my body is telling me that it needs something.  In my case
it was milk, in other cases it might be something in a frozen slurpee.
Ya just never know...

I did a bunch of cooking for myself before surgery, thinking that I
would be hungry for what I fixed.  It turned out to be quite a few
weeks later before I was interested in anything I had cooked for
myself.

&gt; Friends from his office have said they'll be bringing over casseroles and
&gt; such.  Sort of like a &quot;dead spread&quot; (I credit Barb with that term, except
&gt; he's not dead.)  I expect lots of egg or pasta salad type things.

&gt; He has no food restrictions and the doctor I spoke with said it's good for

&gt; I also have a skillet breakfast which dates back to the 1970's, adapted from
&gt; something our mom made.  You brown some grated potatoes (hash browns as
&gt; opposed to home fries), cut the browned potatoes into quarters.  Whisk 4
&gt; eggs and pour it over the crispy browned potatoes.  Add some crumbled bacon
&gt; and top with cheese.  Season with S&amp;P.  Hot sauce, maybe?  Cook until the
&gt; mixture is set.

&gt; I'll bring him some soup.  I'm good at that.

She's right.
I was in the ICU for the whole time after I had my hip surgery last
year: they wanted to watch some medical issues of mine.

That was for about 4-5 days...  After the first day, I was allowed to
have whatever I wanted to eat, and no one cared if folks brought me
food.
