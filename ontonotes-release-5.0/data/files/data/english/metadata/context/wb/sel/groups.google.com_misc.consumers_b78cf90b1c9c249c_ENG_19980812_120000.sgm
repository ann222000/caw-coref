There is a church in Wells Branch who repeatedly sends
me &quot;religious advertizing&quot;, trying to get me to attend
their services. I'm not Christian, so I find this
extremely offensive. I'd rather receive pornography
or another long distance ad in my mailbox than
something from another church. ;-)

Two times, I've called the church's admin office and
left voicemail asking to be removed from their mailing
list. I've even called the minister and the
administrator and demanded that they stop sending
me their advertizements. The minister called me back
just to be obnoxious to me. ;-)
These people were extrememly condescending and one came
close to being downright nasty. They refused to stop
sending it. I threathened to contact a lawyer and file a
civil suit if they continued, but they just sneered,
laughed and told me I will receive more. It was almost
as if they were telling me I would recieve &quot;even more&quot;
because I objected to it.

I've talked to the USPS Inspector's office and
the city and county police departments. They say
they can't help.

Has anyone here had any success being removed from
a religious mailing list? If so, how did you do it.
Does anyone know of a newsgroup which might be able
to offer some help.

"/> I thought the post office was supposed to do SOMETHING if you complained that
a particular organization -- like this one -- was mailing you unwanted

certainly do and you want it stopped NOW!

You might also give the stuff to somebody with a wood stove -- they LOVE junk
mail!

&gt;&quot;Return Service Requested&quot;

"/>  Oh, yeah. Getting unwanted mail certainly justifies committing a
federal crime. Way to seize the moral high ground.
And if you believe that your &quot;cleverness&quot; will actually cost the mailer
anything at all other than a few laughs, you are incorrect. Return service
is something that has to be set up in advance; the money doesn't magically
teleport out of the mailer's bank account. And return service is used rarely
enough that the postal employees who handle returned mail at a post office
usually know exactly which mailers at that office use it; a piece returned to
a mailer who doesn't normally use return service will attract a much higher
level of scrutiny.
It is agonizingly unlikely that the piece will actually make it back to
the mailer. And if it does, and if the mailer does not appreciate its return,
then they can always send it on to the Postal Inspection Service, which can
be surprisingly touchy about such matters.
Naturally, you don't need to worry about this, since you have no such
stamp. Oh, wait... of course. You have such a stamp, but it--and the
reason you had it made--_completely_ slipped your mind until someone pointed
out just how completely ineffectual you were being without it, right? I mean,
this magical appearance of a rubber stamp _couldn't_ simply be yet another
symptom of your pathological inability to admit to being wrong on any point...

[SNIPPAGE]

Speaking as a non-believer, my suggest ot you is not to worry about those
unwanted mailings. By just tossing those maliings in your waste basket or
recycling bin, you're helping to cause the church to waste its money on a
futile cause. Why save them money if they're such pests? In fact, if those
mailings come with a card to enroll a friend, fill out the car with a
bogus address, such as a cemetary or sports stadium and let the church
waste more of its money sending out its silly mailings.

You could always do what I'm about to do... despite constant phone
calls, Time-Crapper Cable still insists on sending me junk mail about
their wonderful (VERY EXPENSIVE) cable TV. This stuff comes at LEAST
once a week, sometimes twice. So, I have a bag containing all their
junk, which just happens to have been passed through my shredder, and
which will find itself strewn all over their office floor if they
continue to send me any more.

Don't get mad, get even ;-)

been pointed out, probably doesn't ultimately matter since return service
depends on the kind of mailing you've actually purchased rather than any

was all computerized now, in fact, though this may vary from mailing

waste your brain doing anything about it. Petty revenge is often a

However, if you just want to do something nasty (as we evil heathens
sometimes do) put them on the Adam &amp; Eve mailing list. Send them
literature they don't agree with. Buy them a Penthouse subscription,
Texas Triangle, and all those swinger mags they give away at Planet K.
Make sure everything is legal because if anything comes to law you
will not be on the good side.

I still say the best thing to do is ignore it. A religious war will
only make the jesus crispies more intolerable than they are now.
Gives them something to feel righteous about.

Just throw it away. I get hundreds of pieces of junk mail every month.
99% of it goes in the trash. Is it addressed to you by name?

What would you sue them for? Wasting stamps?

You seem pretty sensitive on this. It doesn't bother me a bit when I get
junk mail, or hoardes of spam, I just toss/delete the stuff. I think someone

&gt; Um, gee, Dusty - no. The &quot;trash&quot; at my house is separated into to four

You might want to lighten up a little, too. I'm happy you recycle,
though.

Now, on to the real story here. Shoreline Christian Center does 2 kinds
of mailings. One is from an internal list of their parishioners. Collene
is not on this list. They also hire a private list company, The List
Store, to do bulk mailings a couple of times per year based on zip code.

The bulk mailing list is the property of The List Store, not the church.
The church never sees the list. They pay a fee, drop off however many
fliers they wish to send and The List Store labels, sorts and mails
their stuff. They have no way to add or remove anyone from this list.

Collene, however, can contact the list store and ask to be removed. As
the list is based on publicly available info, they may or may not
comply. Most companies will comply with a removal request, but they
don't have to.

As to the abuse allegations, the church claims they told Collene they
did not control the list the first time she called. According to them,
she called back several more times demanding to be removed and
threatening, &quot;...to make you pay.&quot; The Sheriff was called and a report
filed. The Sheriff spoke to Collene and warned her against telephone
harassment. That was the official end of the incident.

According to the church, it's true, she was laughed at the third time
she called by an office volunteer due to her complaints about all the
energy the church was sending her way. The pastor apologized for this
and has spoken to the volunteer.

Shoreline tells me they would honor her request if they could, but they
have no control over the list. They also warn that she will continue to
receive mailings from them and others as long as she is on that
particular list. They regret any inconvenience this may cause and
suggest she contact The List Store.

So there ya go. As with many rants here, there are two sides. The one we
saw here was a bit less than completely accurate. One note, though.
Shoreline apparently did not provide Collene with the name of the
mailing service. Now that she has it, she should be able to get herself
removed.

Cheers,

Dusty

Dusty, you could become Austin's version of Marvin Zindler, Houston's
longtime consumer advocate. Bravo for your taking the time to make a
couple of phone calls and actually *accomplish* something.

This is a remarkable contrast to some of the self-proclaimed consumer
advocates on Usenet, who babble much but actually accomplish nothing.

"/> Well, I didn't tell my side of the story, when I
posted my original message. I decided to 1) be
discrete and 2) it would take too long and 3) would
probably inflame the bible beaters, who would rush
to the church's defense. I still feel its' not appropriate
to air the church's dirty linen here.

And, as with so many of the &quot;other side of the story&quot;,
the rebuttal, above has been &quot;whitewashed&quot;. No one from
the chruch has ever apologized to me. In fact, the 2 people
I spoke with were very offensive and asked me personal
questions about my &quot;creed&quot; and &quot;belief system&quot;. One
even accused me of &quot;not helping the poor&quot; because I'm
not a christian. Don't ask me what kind of logic that
is or which field it came from. I'll have to admit,
his screaming tirade was rather amusing.

The church admitted to me that the list was in their
possession and since it is, they are capable of
removing my name. They refused to tell me where
the list was purchased. One person said &quot;we bought
it from the city&quot;. When asked what they meant by
that, they changed the subject.

As to a police report. I won't know about that
until Sunday, when the complaint I've reported,
will be reviewed. However, from what the original
Sargent said, the rude &quot;policeman&quot; who spoke to
me and defended the church, was an imposter.
However, if they were vicious enough to file a false
report, I have even less respect for the institution
than I did before.

Now, you still don't know the whole story, and
at least for my part, you never will, because
I don't have the time or desire to describe
all the horrors of my dealings with these people.
Suffice it to say that my dealings with the Shoreline
Christian Center have substantiated my previously
low opinion of christian institutions and bible
beaters, in general. ;-)

I do think it's very sad commentary on society,
that we allow christian chruches to harrass and
belittle individuals, the police aids them in this
and we have no recourse. Until this, I was under
the impression I was entitled to the same police
protection and laws , as any other person or
institution. It's clear that this is not true
in the US. Christians and christian institutions
take precedence.

All I have ever asked is that these horrible
people (at the SCC) leave me alone. I don't think
that is such an unreasonable request.

nothing I find more offensive than christianity and
2) I've asked them nicely in the past and they've

they sneered and laughed and screamed at me and refused
to remove my name from the list. The message they
were sending was very deliberate and clear. They
think that eventually I will &quot;break down&quot; and
admit that I'm a sordid sinner and let them
&quot;save&quot; me. ;-) This reasoning was also suggested
by personnel at the USPS Inspector's office, who
seem to be a bit more enlightened than the folks
at the church. ;-)

Even though it's very frustrating, I have to see

I am sorry Suzanne. I did not mean to scare you there. :-) I meant to
poke fun at religions who do that type of nonsense, and we all know who is
most notorious for it.

The &quot;proper&quot; way of getting people to change their faith is by letting them
come to you of their own free will. So let's say I wanted to become a pagan
I would just come to you, not the other way around. Or if someone wanted to
become a Christian they would go to a preacher.

You are absolutely correct that threats, stoning, bombings, burnings, etc,
etc are all incorrect and wrong methods. I do not think they are right at
least. I do not believe in condemning people who are of different
religions. I did not mean to imply that I did. In my faith that is just as
a horrible solution.

My implication was that religions (read me *all*) should not go door to door
and should not do mass mailings if they wish to further the good of their
religion. So I agree with you on that also. I must have really failed to
get my point across in my message. DOH!

Again I do apologize with making it seem the opposite. I do agree with what
you have said on the above Suzanne.

"/> This to me is a useful method of illustrating the situation, especially
if you add &quot;and continued to do so after being asked to stop.&quot; While I
think Collene's probably more bothered than I would be, if a place kept
sending me stuff I had a strong philosophical opposition to and showed no
sympathy for my desire to get off their mailing list, I would also be
pretty annoyed.

I'm not insisting I never see anything religious in my mailbox (I'm a
major mail-orderer and I get a ton of catalogues in general, and it's
clear that my demographic has confused a few list-sellers :-)), and I do
know that I was setting myself up for some misguided marketing when I
purchased a British tape from a vendor of religious videos. The
religious catalogues can get recycled along with the new-age,
survivalist, dog-owner, minority-focused, etc. stuff that I get that
doesn't apply either.

But I don't actually see Collene's situation as the same thing. She
didn't buy anything and this place presumably wouldn't be trying to make
money from her, what with being a church and all. This is a
specific exhortation from a specific church, it's been repeatedly mailed,
and it's been objected to as offensive by the recipient. Never mind what
they &quot;have&quot; to do--seems to me the civilized thing to do is to apologize
and arrange to remove the name from the list. Failure to do that, IMHO,
calls into question 1) their charity; 2) the efficacy of their approach to
conversion and 3) their organization (it doesn't strike me as spiritual
to say &quot;We don't care about offending your deepest philosophical beliefs;
we paid good money for this package and it's convenient for us to keep
sending it.&quot; I've got seriously devout friends, and none of these
behaviors is consonant with Christianity as they practice it, that's for
sure.

&gt; I don't mind flyers. What I do mind is when some one or two Christians

&gt; won't go away or come back day after day.

"/> Bud, I've had problems with the way that personal information is discolsed by
State officials here in TX, who regard official records like tax rolls as
public information. Because of this, I have been inundated with sales flyers
and salesmen calling and knocking on my door since I bought my home here.
However, I have not gone out on the NG to flame the brand x water softener
company or Acme home alarms inc., no matter how much they pester me. I just
toss their mailings or tell them I'm not interested and hang up the phone or
close the door.

FWIW, as a Christian, I also get the JW and LDS knocking on my door. They do
not disturb or threaten me any more than the Kirby Vacuum man, even though
they are from a totally different faith. Why should an atheist or a pagan
feel any differently? I can see getting a bit flustered when harrassed on
the street or in a store by someone getting in your face, but why should a
simple flyer pose such a threat?

"/> At least in Canada, some &quot;religious content&quot; has fallen into the same
cracks as pornography. But it has to be wild. Most of it would fall in
the same category as supermarket flyers, political party flyers, etc.
which can be useful to some, liked by a few, but not liked by many
others.

Because it is addressed in your name, the Postal service must deliver it
to you, unless they have a specific obligation to stop it. You would
need a court order requiring that &quot;christian center&quot; to stop sending you
that paper, and then serve an injunction to the Post office requiring
them to follow the order.

The best bets are persuasion. Sometimes, the best trick with some ardent
zealots is to convince them that you *are* a christian, albeit of
another persuasion, and that you are not interested of switching to a
different church (just get the name of a nearby mainline church and
learn the name of the pastor).

Another trick is to find other people in your situation and flood them
with phone call requests to unsubscribe. 50 persons phoning once a day
to unsubscribe would jam their system...

Another idea: instead of talking to the first person who answers the
phone (likely a volunteer who barely knows the subscription system),
talk to the publication supervisor. He or she will know the computer
better and hopefully the legal stuff better.

P.S. On the persuasion trick: when Jehova whitnesses ring at the door, I
usually tell them quickly that I should discuss these theological issues
in the presence of my rector. Usually, they are out long before I finish
that sentence!

re P.S. I am a Christian (Anglican), but it is by choice, not because
someone forced it upon me. I expect the same of others.
