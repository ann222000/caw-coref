Trip Report - Charlottesville, VA American Idol Show on Sept. 16th,
2007:

The Concierge in our office building was offering good seats for
$50.00 or about $20 less than face value. When I further inquired, she
indicated that as the show was not selling well we might not even have
to pay for the tickets at all.

In the end, I received 3 tickets for a total of $50.00. These had a
face value of $68.00 + $2.00 service charge, so it seemed quite the
deal.

My wife and I, along with our 12-yr-old son headed out from Richmond
at about 2:00 on Sunday. This was to be his first concert experience.
He has attended Redskin's and Nationals' games, but a concert venue,
was different - &quot;a lot to take in&quot; as he put it once we were in the
arena.

We got into Charlottesville a little after 3:00, parking near the
Downtown promenade. We walked up and down, enjoying the lovely weather
(about 70, clear and comfortable), some street music and poking in
bookstores and antique shops.

We were heading, eventually, to the Hardware Store, a lovely
restaurant we had been to last summer after a trip to Monticello. An
old-fashioned eatery, this place had an extensive menu-it included
full meals, salads, sandwiches, desserts and milkshakes, etc. etc- as
well as a Pickle Bar. Yes, a bar of different pickle types to sample.
But alas, it had closed down in the interim.

We settled on Five Guys Burgers. This is a top-notch burger joint.
Everything fresh, hand-cut fries cooked in peanut oil, and all burger
fixings included, just ask for what you want. Also, boxes of peanuts
to munch while waiting for your order. Good food.

Off to the arena. John Paul Jones Arena is on the UVA campus. It is
where the UVA basketball teams play in addition to hosting many shows.
Bad beat #1: we did not have a parking pass., so had to pay $15.00 to
park. We were not familiar with the area so we did not attempt to park
further off and hoof it in. Well, considering the deal I got on the
tickets, 15 bucks was- almost- easy to accept.

I thought the arena was quite nice-Carpeted spacious corridors,
comfortable seating, and clean restrooms. Very modern, although I will
never understand why building designers will not put a sufficient
number of ladies' rooms in venues such as this. The intermission
brought long lines waiting to get in.

We found our seats with no problem- Section 103, Row N. When we got to
our seats we found that we were in a &quot;front&quot; row, elevated above the
floor with a railing in front of us. In fact, we were right about
level height with the stage. Nice.

The local Richmond paper had run a story about the tour on Friday
mentioning that Blake likes to sometimes dress up as a Pop Tart or one
of the security guards before the show starts. So of course as soon as
the &quot;pop-tart&quot; comes out to the floor we were scrutinizing him to see
if he (she?) moved like Blake. Imagine our surprise then, when looking
over at the stage directly across from us, we saw a guard at
attention- and it was obviously Blake in hat, wig, t-shirt and shades.
Cool. The show was about to start!
A few minutes later Blake ran over to a prop and pulled a switch; the
stage lit up and the Idols ran out, singing &quot;Let's Get it Started!&quot;-
and they were off and running!

My impressions of the show follow. Kind of scatter-shot but here goes:

Over-all a great show. Lots of energy, good, familiar songs sung well
(for the most part) and a dazzling band. The two back-up singers, one
male and one female, sounded pitch-perfect.

Each Idol got to do a solo and there were group songs thrown in the
mix as well. Jordin closed it out. I know you can find detailed re-
caps of each song elsewhere so I won't try to replicate that.

Bad Beat #2: the ten-year-old directly behind us screaming bloody
murder before, during and after EVERY song. This kid never lost his
voice! He was right in our ears and it was painful, literally. But
what're-you-gonna-do? &quot;Please, I know this is a concert, but can you
stop expressing your enthusiasm so loudly?&quot; I just wish the parents
had caught a clue and quieted the kid down a bit.

Gina and Chris Sligh: Could barely hear them unless they were belting
it out. I don't know if it was bad miking or what, but I had trouble
understanding either of their vocals throughout the show.

Haley: Forgettable.

Boy Band: This was fun. Not the worst band I have ever heard, for
sure- Phil on keyboards, Chris R. on drums, Chris S. on bass, Blake on
guitar and Sanjaya on tambourine/fake guitar strumming. &quot;Hey Jude&quot;
vocals were serviceable.

Phil doing &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; was awesome. Same for LaKisha doing &quot;I
Will Always Love You&quot; and Melinda on &quot;Natural Woman&quot;.

I enjoyed Sanjaya. Lots of energy, good moves and good stage presence.
His MJ impersonation was enjoyable. He even moon-walked a bit.

Blake &quot;blew it out the box&quot; as Randy would say. He sounded great all
through the show. The beat-boxing made me think &quot;how does he do
that?&quot;- Highlights: &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; and &quot;Dueling Beatboxes&quot;
with Chris R. Also the guitar-solo, looping thingy was cool.

Chris Richardson has really matured as a performer. Not so herky-jerky
in his moves anymore and vocals were smooth. Kid's got a future. Much
better looking in-person than on TV.

Jordin: Very under-utilized in the first half. I almost thought they
were keeping her under wraps until the end, but no, she was out for
one song and then kinda disappeared until the end. Yes, there was an
intermission. One half hour to get Bad Beat #3: A thirty-frickin-
dollar t-shirt for the youngster. Oy vey. Yes, Jordin has a rich,
powerful voice. Whether singing &quot;I Who Have Nothing&quot; (incredible) or
the Jewel song (she's learning to play guitar, how cool is that), her
voice is clean and strong. Â She will go as far as she wants to go in
her singing career. We left a bit early to beat the crowds out. Monday
is a school and work day, after all!

To sum up:
All-in-all, a tremendous experience. Our boy was thrilled by the whole
experience. My wife and I danced in our seats through the whole show,
singing along. A good time was had by all.
50 (tix) + 15(parking) + 30(t-shirt) + 25 (gas) + 20 (dinner) = A
priceless first-time experience for us.

The feeling I got from the show can be summed up by this scene, no
doubt repeated throughout the arena: Three little girls just below us-
swaying back and forth with their arms in the air with no hint at all
of self-consciousness during the slower songs. It nearly brought a
tear to my eye. Okay, maybe I did have to blot a bit. The show was
that good. Thanks for reading.

Awesome. Â It's great that they're offering to teach Blake a skill,
such as being a security guard or a pop tart so that when his foray
into beat boxing crashes and burns within a year, he'll have something
to fall back on. Â Those Idol folks think of everything.
