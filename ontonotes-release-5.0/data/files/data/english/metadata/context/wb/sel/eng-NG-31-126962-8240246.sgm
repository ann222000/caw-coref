Ray Haddad Claims:

&quot;In all of my past careers, writing was a large part of what I did.
I suppose I should try fiction next.&quot;

HELLO?

&quot;The reality is that I did have a 22 year long military career.&quot;

&quot;I am retired from the US Navy and was in naval aviation. I only
flew occasionally as on official passenger and never drove a plane other
than an R/C  plane.&quot;

&quot;I had a brilliant, 22 year long career - some small parts of which
I described here.&quot;

&quot;I also write a great deal of electronic related articles under a
pseudonym which I choose to keep to myself. No reason. I just want to
keep it to myself. I wrote two textbooks using that name which are still
being used at colleges worldwide. [...]

&quot;I have been fortunate enough to have taught magic in many places
around the world over the past 30 years.&quot;

&quot;I work in community access televsion (Access 31) as the show
manager for a TV show that showcases talent in Western Australia.&quot;

&quot;My background is well founded in science. That was my career by
training. My choice of career is different now. I've left my science
work behind me but still retain the knowledge.&quot;

&quot;I'm retired from electronic engineering and design having at one
time 50 engineers in my employ in my company.&quot;

&quot;I am an expert at magic. Like it or not, I have 40 years of
experience at performing continuously around the world.&quot;

&quot;After a full career in the military,&quot;

&quot;My ego is case hardened by 40 years of performing on stage.&quot;

&quot;Unlike the civilian work force, all military personnel are on duty
24/7 every day of the year. There is no time clock to punch nor is
there any real expectation of a &quot;quitting time.&quot; The enemy never  seems
to respect our days off.&quot;

&quot;I wrote and edited many parts of early USENET  documentation and
FAQ pages. &quot;

&quot;I do, however, write occasional opinion pieces for a newspaper with
a daily circulation of a quarter million.&quot;

&quot;I get paid to be funny.&quot;

&quot;Of course, I'm a writer. Prolific, even. Are you?&quot;

&quot;As a senior military person, that task often falls on our shoulders
and we are trained in the matter.&quot;

&quot;I was one of those adults who proudly taught religious education in
the Catholic Church for more than 20 years.&quot;

&quot;And I've been writing for more than 30 years in the fields of
magic,  electronics engineering, embedded systems programming, model
railroading, and right wing politics.&quot;

&quot;I knew what you meant. But only because of my long and famous
career in [culinary] art.&quot;

&quot;I've been a pro magician for most of my life.&quot;

&quot;Every word I have written about my service time has been absolute
fact.&quot;

&quot;You know I am a writer and a magician. So, what do you do?&quot;

&quot;I worked every year for 20+ years for the American Red Cross to
help encourage people to donate blood. I do that now in Australia for
the Australian Red Cross.&quot;

&quot;I have 40+ years treading the boards, as it were.  [...]  I've
taught drama for the past 20 years but only very occasionally. It's not
impossible to become an entertainer without formal training [...].&quot;

&quot;I'm a Republican to prove my patriotism. That and my 22 years of
voluntary and honorable military service to the United States of America
doing my bit to preserve your freedoms allows me to call myself a
patriot. Each year for all of those 22 years, I swore an oath to uphold,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, so
help me God. I did my bit.&quot;

&quot;I currently perform professionally. I also produce variety
entertainment shows for live performances and for television. I write
performance scripts for people who request them. You guys are awfully
lucky that I get time to post here at all.&quot;

&quot;Before moving across the Pacific and Indian Oceans to Perth, I
spent the previous 20 years performing in Las Vegas and Southern
California - the Magic Capital of the World! &quot;

&quot;I try to describe to lay people those project meetings where reference
books go flying across the room, erasers get bounced from the foreheads
of engineers and the absolute frustration of the office help tasked with
recording the proceedings of these meetings. No one, save an engineer,
can ever truly understand.&quot;

&quot;I'm a professional magician and thousands  came to watch me perform in
venues around the world over my  trip/tour. I write for a number of
magic magazines and newsletters. &quot;

&quot;I have travelled all over the world and performed in places like
Cannes, Monte Carlo, St. Thomas, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Naples,
Manila, Cairo, Bremerhaven, Athens, Barcelona, and for two Christmas
seasons in 1972 and 1973, I toured for 3 weeks each year with the USO on
the jungles of Southeast Asia. I've also performed in 47 US States in
military clubs, public venues and private parties and now in Australia
since moving here in March, 1999.&quot;

[NOTE:  According to the Bob Hope/USO records, Ray Haddad is lying about
having toured with them.]

&quot;I had the distinct pleasure of working with Bob Hope when I was
performing in the United Services Organization's Pacific Theater of
Operations tours during the Vietnam era.&quot;

[NOTE:  According to the Bob Hope/USO records, Ray Haddad is lying about
having toured with them.]

&quot;I do magic and write, gekko. I am a full time, practicing magician
and I write a little here and there.&quot;

&quot;I write non fiction that deals exclusively with what I do as a
primary profession. It's part and parcel of what I do so my income from
that is lumped in one basket, so to speak.&quot;

&quot;I also often write without compensation and edit a newsletter,
again without compensation, for others in my profession.&quot;

&quot;I want people to find me. Without them finding me, I wouldn't be
fabulously wealthy from them paying me money to entertain them or to
write for them.&quot;

&quot;I'm retired from killing now, Geno. I haven't taken a life in over
30 years now. I'm not reformed, mind you, just retired.&quot;

&quot;Read about his means to ensure your livelihood and secure your
future has income. Mine keeps rolling in years after I earned it the
first time.&quot;

&quot;That being said, I studied in Memphis, TN for a year to learn
electronics the US Navy way and then went to further study on specific
systems. I was trained   the computers and remote guidance systems
for missiles and bomb directing computers on the RA-5C Vigilante, the
A3D Skywarrior and A4 Skyhawk.&quot;

&quot;Later, after those planes were retired, I learned the F-14 system
and became an instructor for the US Navy teaching many men and women how
to do all that good stuff like keeping the world free by using and
maintaining superior technology.&quot;

A Night in the Life of the &quot;Fabulously Wealthy&quot; Ray Haddad:

&quot;I'm up late. Just got back from a gig. A hen's night for a
wedding shower. Just a bunch of lovely gals all very, very drunk
and me. So drunk, in fact, that one of them actually made a pass
at me. Mrs Ray is always so amused when I tell her about those
incidents. It was hard but I turned the lady down.

&quot;Mrs Ray often comes along with me for the larger shows where
I need sound, music and etc. Once, as I was doing my cabaret
show which has me wandering through the audience, she actually
saw (from the sound stage area) a woman grab me. It sort of
startled me as this was a very swank gig and I don't often feel
any other woman's hand besides Mrs Ray's in that location. She
thought initially the lady was after my wallet but when I returned
by the same route, she saw much better what happened as the
lady did it yet again.

&quot;I love drunk, beautiful women.&quot;

Mr. Hope:  &quot;Was that when you were being a professional killer?&quot;

Ray Haddad:  &quot;Professional? Where did you get that from?&quot;

Mr. Hope:  &quot;Did you not say you used to kill people for a living?&quot;

Ray Haddad:  &quot;That's correct. That doesn't make me a professional.
Look it up.&quot;

Dr Zen:  &quot;I did. My dictionary has 'Performed by persons
receiving pay'.

&quot;You using Ray's Magick Dictionary again?&quot;
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dr Zen:  &quot;Robbie is an anti-Arabist. He thinks Arabs are
all bloodthirsty savages who would murder anyone
and everyone given the means.&quot;

Ray Haddad:  &quot;I used to kill for a living.&quot;

Mr. Hope:  &quot;Stuffing doves into top-hats is very naughty.
However in the interests of children's parties,
it's only to be expected that one or two will
snuff it from time to time. We live with that
according to the tightness of our consciences.&quot;

&quot;But to say you killed for a living is taking the
whole thing a little too seriously. You bent
balloons for a living, man. The doves were
collateral damage. You didn't mean for them to
die, for the love of God. Won't somebody give
this man, this hero, just one night's sleep
before he dies!???!&quot;

Ray Haddad:  &quot;You move me, Alan. Sniff . . . I needed that.&quot;

Mr. Hope:  &quot;Has there ever been a more preposterous comment
posted to the Usenet than: 'I used to kill for a
living'? You're a bloated great parody of a
pastiche of a caricature of a buffoon, Ray.&quot;
