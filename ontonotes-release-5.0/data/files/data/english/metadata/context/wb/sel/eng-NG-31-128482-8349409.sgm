Admitting that the surge is working should be avoided as much as
possible, lest it increase political support for the war.

The Democrats' Counsel of Despair

David Bonior has a problem with the surge - it's had some success. The
campaign manager for John Edwards slammed Hillary Clinton for telling
the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention that &quot;we've begun to change
our tactics in Iraq and in some areas, particularly in al Anbar
province, it's working.&quot; Bonior called on Sen. Clinton to &quot;reconsider
her ill-advised statement and reaffirm her dedication to using
Congress' constitutional funding power to end this war.&quot; Bonior
himself, however, notes &quot;our military's hard-won progress in al-Anbar
province.&quot;

Bonior's position appears to be that admitting that the surge is
working should be avoided as much as possible, lest it increase
political support for the war. As Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, &quot;It's
difficult to say positive things in this environment and not have some
snarky apologist for the White House turn it into clipped phraseology
that looks like support for the president's policies.&quot; Better, then,
to ignore all progress?

The fact is that the surge is President Bush's policy, and one that he
implemented over the vociferous opposition of Democrats who thought
the best strategy against al Qaeda in Iraq was to begin to leave. Now
the surge has helped turn Sunni tribes against al Qaeda, advancing the
goal that nearly everyone in the U.S. notionally shares of routing the
terror group from Iraq. Democrats try to chalk up this progress
generically to the courage and the adeptness of our troops. Our troops
were just as courageous and adept a year ago but they were burdened,
unfortunately, by a flawed strategy of prematurely pulling back to let
Iraqi forces take the lead - exactly the strategy Democrats have
favored ever since President Bush announced the surge.

The new National Intelligence Estimate reports &quot;measurable but uneven
improvements in Iraq's security situation,&quot; and says a shift from
counterinsurgency operations to efforts simply to train Iraqis &quot;would
erode security gains achieved so far.&quot; On the other hand, the estimate
is grim on the prospects of the Maliki government that, it predicts,
&quot;will become more precarious over the next six to 12 months.&quot; Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki has become a favored target of Democrats this
week as they shift the focus from military progress to the failure to
meet the political benchmarks set out along with the surge in January.
Trying to placate her Democratic critics, Clinton said on Wednesday,
&quot;The surge was designed to give the Iraqi government time to take
steps to ensure a political solution. It has failed.&quot;

This is too simplistic. The surge has failed to enable legislative
progress on the part of the central government (i.e., the benchmarks),
but important political progress has been taking place in Iraq. The
turn of the Sunni tribes away from al Qaeda and toward us is a crucial
political development. If anyone had thought this was possible at the
beginning of the year (it wasn't even mentioned in the January 2007
NIE), it might have been included as a benchmark and considered the
most important one. Are we really supposed to discount this political
progress because it happened in a manner and on a timetable that no
one would have predicted?

As the NIE notes, the central government needs to build on this
progress at the local level by passing legislation aimed at
reconciling Sunni and Shia. (Essentially, for now, the Sunni tribes
have reconciled to us, but not to the Shia.) But this isn't all that
matters in Iraq, as Democrats suggest when they say there is no
&quot;military solution.&quot; They are right that there isn't an exclusively
military solution, but neither is there an exclusively political
solution. As we've seen in Anbar, the military and political
dimensions of the war constantly interact. It would have been harder
for the Sunni tribes to turn against al Qaeda absent our military
help, and even if they had, they probably wouldn't have been strong
enough to beat back the terror group. Our military operations have
been key to the political progress there and the political progress
has, in turn, facilitated our military operations.

The Democrats' counsel of despair would only make sense if we had sent
another 30,000 troops to Iraq to pursue a new strategy and nothing had
come of it. Instead, we have seen results and the NIE forecasts more
(&quot;modest&quot;) progress on the military front if we maintain our counter-
insurgency operations. We can't know whether Maliki's government will
ever congeal enough to become effective and whether it will ever pass
broad-based reform legislation. But if the violence of 2006 had
continued unabated, the Iraqi government might have fallen by now. The
Democrats - of all people - shouldn't forget that Iraq has been
traumatized by a civil war; political reconciliation, if it happens,
will take time and only happen in an environment of increasing
security.

President Bush provoked liberal outrage when he cited the Vietnam war
in making the case for the war in his speech at the VFW convention. Of
course, Vietnam analogies cut both ways. The Iraq war is, as critics
point out, like Vietnam in that we are trying to create a legitimate,
capable government in the midst of a brutal war of insurgency - and
learning (or re-learning) how arduous and complicated a task that is.
But Bush was right to remind us of the horrific humanitarian costs of
the precipitous withdrawal from Southeast Asia demanded by liberals in
the 1970s. He might have mentioned another similarity with Vietnam -
how Democrats were in such a fever to pullout that they disregarded
any encouraging signs on the ground and abandoned all strategic sense.

And to make your point more poignant, William F. Buckley, the founder of
modern conservatism said the war was lost over a year ago. Here's a bit
of what he said.

The American objective in Iraq has failed.
National Review
It Didn't Work
William F. Buckley
February 24, 2006

&lt;snip&gt;
The accompanying postulate was that the invading American army would
succeed in training Iraqi soldiers and policymkers to cope with
insurgents bent on violence.

This last did not happen. And the administration has, now, to cope with
failure.

&lt;snip&gt;

Yes, but within their own counsels, different plans have to be made. And
the kernel here is the acknowledgment of defeat.

The Democrat establishment is desperately trying to find excuses for the

Military experts say we can't win the war militarily, therefore we begin
with that basic truth, which is the surge is a political ploy to buy
time for whatever the politicians are trying to do.

Debating a &quot;positive effect&quot; (sic - positive affect) would require first
accepting there is no military solution, second, the war is lost and
thirdly, political solutions that may have arisen from the &quot;surge&quot;
haven't materialized.

Thus, the only positive affect we can see is one that results in a more
stable political solution - IE: the government of Iraq becoming more stable.

Back in the real world, the Iraqi government is on the verge of collapse
(specifically the al-Maliki coalition).

Sometimes it's best to create a standard and stick to it. If we'd have
done that we wouldn't have needed so many excuses for this war, we would
have been satisfied with one reason for war (reasons for war never
change, excuses must).

The surge was suppose to create stronger Iraqi government but clearly
the opposite has occurred. It's time to change the standard again.

The Democratic Underground shouldn't be confused with the Democrat
establishment.

&quot;DU has become one of the premier left-wing websites on the Internet,
publishing original content six days a week, and hosting one of the
Web's most active left-wing discussion boards.&quot;

http://www.democraticunderground.com/about.html

Since liberals were against the war from 'day one' of course we're
against any Democrat who are delusional enough to say the &quot;surge is
working.&quot;

The odd part is now that the GOP is in the minority, more of their
members have come out against the war, so it seems self-evident that
support of the war is based entirely on the delusion associated with
having majority control.

Couple of points.  First, I used &quot;effect&quot; correctly.  Effect, as noun,
means an accomplishment or a result.

http://209.10.134.179/141/strunk3.html (scroll down to &quot;effect&quot;)

Second point, the stable political solution cannot happen until the
violence comes under control.  There are signs that that is occurring,
or at least beginning; time will tell. All one needs to do is listen to
several of the Democratic presidential candidates -- with their
seemingly inbred fear of being out-of-step with opinion polls on the war
-- to realize there is some good news coming from Iraq.  No one denies
that it can degrade quickly.  To say it's a fragile situation is an
understatement.  Too many on the far left are, however, conditioned to
bad news from Iraq.  Anything that contradicts their expectations is
considered false on face value.  It's an interesting phenomenon to observe.

This is a fascinating -- and very telling -- statement.  I actually read
this after my last post where I claimed the far left will dismiss any
positive news on Iraq at face value.  And here you prove my point with
commendable brevity.

It is completely irrational for anyone to judge reports on progress in
Iraq (or the lack of progress) based on their opinion of the invasion
before the war.  One has nothing to do with other.  Your marvelously
accurate statement shows that many on the left are simply incapable of
independent thought on this subject (and I would argue any subject even
tangentially related to GWB, for that matter).    Their political
thought process has become nothing short of tribal -- it's &quot;us&quot; versus
&quot;him.&quot;

That's somewhat true.
Each time a reason for the war is disproved, the Missionaries come up
wtih a new, false, justification for the predetermined goal - War.

Zepp probably considers himself a rational person...  when in fact, he
doesn't even know any rational people.

&gt; Couple of points.  First, I used &quot;effect&quot; correctly.  Effect, as noun,

Affect also means to alter. Since you wanted to know what has to be
shown (evidence) to alter the current situation (from bad to good), the
word should have been &quot;affect.&quot;

(original)
&quot;What would you accept as evidence that surge was working, or at least
having a positive effect?&quot;

In this sense you want to know the evidence needed to &quot;influence,&quot; not
alter.  If influence is what you were asking then you are correct, but
that's not what you're asking.

I personally wouldn't have used either word.

(mine)
What evidence would you require to prove the surge is working?

We know the objective but the goals keep shifting

It's good that they feel they know what the objective is.
But it's kinda crazy for them to say that their objective is not their goal.

But hey - that kind of logic seems to work *well* on the evangelicals.

If you need to ask ...

- -
&quot;The Democrats, instead of realizing that this is
as bad as World War Two, or even worse, are
going to pull out of Iraq, handing it over to Iran on
a silver platter. Next may come the Saudis and
the rest of the Gulf states. When dirty bombs go
off all over Western towns, who is going to stop
the Iranians?
