Will high octane really damage my engine?

As some of you know, I'm a 2001 Dakota owner who is currently stationed
overseas.  The base just upgraded the gas station, and in their infinite
wisdom, now only offer 95 Octane gas.  My owner's manual says my engine
could be damaged if I use high octane.  Will it really?

If this can indeed damage my engine, I'd like to know how, and if,
there's any way (additives?) I'd be able to use this gas.  Otherwise, I
have to use more expensive options, which may include paying the current
$6.50 per gallon, which is what we pay here, with the currently high
exchange rate.

Thanks for any advice!

Wow.  I always thought it could do damage if you went the other way (putting
lower octane gas into an engine requiring high, although today's engines can
compensate for it).  Years ago, when gas was cheaper (heh, heh.  remember
when?) I would sometimes put higher octane gas in my car, even though it
served no purpose whatsoever in my car.  I'm curious to know the answer to
your question.

It is possible BUT not very likely. The higher octane fuel additives MAY
not burn off as well and could result in carbon deposit buildup on the
heads. Easy solution would be to use some cleaner every few thousand
miles to prevent it from occurring.

Oh and thank you. Keep your head down.

That part is really debateable because some modern hi compression
engines really need more than 87 to run at their fullest potentail and
will run better and get better fuel mileage with it. While maybe they
might not all gain, all for my vehicals do especailly in hot weather
and even my wife 4cyl 2000 Cherokee runs noticably smooth at speed and
picks up 1 or 2 mpg as well when she uses it during the warmer months.
Besdie at today prices it is only 4 to 6% for premium and I gain more
than that back in performance and MPG in my cars so it is actually
cheaper to run premium for me.

I wouldn't lose a minutes sleep over it.  I imagine that your owners manual
when talking about high octane is referring to 100+ octane racing fuel but,
still I don't know why it would harm the engine.  Higher octane fuel doesn't
ignite as easily as lower octane fuel.  With higher octane fuel you have a
more controlled burn than with lower octane fuel and that is why you have
detonation with low octane fuel because it so easily ignites = pre-ignition.
With today's newer engines many have a higher compression ratio than they
had 10 years ago.  The computers on today's vehicles try to adjust for the
lower octane fuel to keep them from the pinging pre-ignition.  Back in the
late 60's when you had such high horsepower engines coming stock in
musclecars they were running 10:1 compression or higher and they had higher
octane fuel at the local gas station.  Now we've got the high compression
ratios back in quite a few new engines and are using the computers to retard
the timing so that they run on 87 octane fuel without damaging the engine
from lack of octane.  If the compression ratio of your engine is not high
enough to require high octane fuel then you don't need it.  2 octane points
above the normal premium gas here in the states will make next to no
difference at all except your engine may run better and cooler and if it
pinged on 87 octane fuel you will not have to worry about it pinging
anymore.

IIRC, the problem with using high octane fuel stems from the computer.  It
seems that the longer burn time of higher octane fuel fools the computer
into thinking that the engine is running rich and causes it to lean the
engine out.  Running lean itself is not a particularly good thing for the
engine and will be reflected in a loss of power, not to mention heat which
could cause detonation, another bad thing for the engine.

Your typical warped logic didn't deserve any explanation.  Heres your
logic, high octane fuel causes the computer to lean the mixture which
causes increased heat which in turn causes detonation (I assume you mean
pinging).  Somebody really needs to explain why this is warped to you?

First of all, I never claimed it, that would be the manufacturer who I would

What's the matter Miles?  Are you still upset?  Perhaps you should do a
little research before jumping in and making an ass out of yourself. Perhaps
if you knew anything about how an engine actually runs and how modern
emissions systems actually work you would not be so quick to jump in and
attack.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Heres your
&gt; logic, high octane fuel causes the computer to lean the mixture which
&gt; causes increased heat which in turn causes detonation (I assume you mean
&gt; pinging).
">

Pretty much, but like I said, if you knew half as much as you think you do,
you would see the possibility.  To further reduce emissions for areas like
California where they are very strict, tighter tolerances are required.
Then when you add the exceptionally high cost of fuel, especially premium,
it is easy to make the assumption that if a vehicle is not to be used for
high performance applications, the engine could and would be designed around
the characteristics of regular unleaded.  This could include things like
fuel delivery rates, valve timing, ignition timing, computer curves based on
the fuels rate of burn and anti-knock capabilities .... get the picture
yet?????

If the fuel burns slower than the engine and its control computers curves
were designed for, the O2 sensor is going to detect a false rich run
condition because some of that fuel is going to enter the exhaust unburned.
I would think that even you could understand this much.  Now unless your
engine has variable valve timing, there are really only two ways to deal
with this situation, increase the timing and/or cut back the fuel.  I would
hope that even you could understand this much.

Now, since the fuel curves are based on the properties of regular unleaded
AND set up for minimum emissions while giving maximum available power, I
think that it would be fairly easy to assume that the timing would always be
at or near its maximum setting for any given speed and load.  That would
leave the computer with the simple choice of reducing the injector pulse
width (cutting back the fuel amount) to correct what it sees as a rich
condition.  The problem is that by doing this, what it has actually done is
cause a lean run condition.

I guess that you don't know this but unlike a diesel, a gas engine requires
a very specific air / fuel ration to run properly.  If you run it lean, it
will increase cylinder temps and reduce power.  I have read posts in here
where people noticed power loss when running high octane fuel in engines
where the manufacturer stated not to use it.  Why do you think that is "all
knowing one"?  This lean run condition also makes the fuel charge unstable
and combined with the added heat, there is the increased possibility of
detonation and pre-ignition, both of which can cause damage to the engine,
hence, the manufacturers claims of "possible engine damage".  Here is a link
explaining detonation and pre-ignition.
http://www.hastingsmfg.com/Service%20Tips/detonation_and_preignition.htm
Notice the number 1 reason for detonation and the number 4 reason for
pre-ignition pretty much follows what I was saying.  Then on top of that
there is the possibility of the increased cylinder wall temps burning off
the protective film of oil causing increased wear, even without any
detonation or pre-ignition.  You can also look at the wording from the
manufacturer.   If they were simply saying not top use premium fuels, you
could also assume that they were more concerned about the detergents added
to that grade damaging fuel injection components rather than confusing the
computer but from what I have seen posted, they were instead specifically
talking octane ratings which would lead me to believe that they were more
concerned about the fuel rate of burn and it confusing the computer rather
than detergent damage.

Now, does this guarantee that I am correct, nope.  What I am saying is
simply based on knowledge of how a modern fuel injected engine operates and
what could go wrong as well as the wording of the warning and symptoms
reported by posters in this group which is far and away more than anything
that you have provided so as they say, put up or shut up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yep, so I suggest that you either get started or mind your own business.
The sad thing is Miles that you do seem to be a bright guy and we could have
some interesting conversations if you didn't resort to turning everything
into some sort of personal attack.  I'll admit that I was just as bad at one
time but I have stopped doing that a while ago.  Perhaps if or when you
realize that it simply isn't worth the trouble doing that we can get into
some interesting discussions and or debates...

It's fairly likely that the "87 octane" gas you can buy in the States and
the "91 octane" gas you can buy in Germany (among other places) are, in
fact, the SAME THING.  Octane is measured two different ways; in the US
it is specified and sold by the average of the two numbers, while in
Europe it is often specified and sold by the higher number.  See
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/070415.html for more.

If this is what's going on where you are, the "95 octane" available at
the pump is probably about equal to "89 octane" in the States.  There
may be a label on the pump someplace that states how the octane is
measured.  If not, you might get in touch with that oil company's office
in your country and ask them - someone there will know which octane
number they are using.  The local Chrysler dealer might know, or you
might try asking Chrysler national customer service in the US.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;My owner's manual says my engine could be damaged if I use high octane.

I'm not sure.  However, consider this.  Most gas stations in the USA
sell at least 87, 89, and 91 octane.  Most people don't read the manual.
Some people insist on buying 91 octane for all their vehicles.  If
putting 89 or 91 octane in Dakotas made the engine blow up, it would have
probably made the papers by now.  There will be a sticker near the gas
filler that says "UNLEADED FUEL ONLY"; if it was a big problem, I would
think that you'd see another sticker there says "IF YOU PUT IN GAS RATED
AT OVER 87 OCTANE, YOUR ENGINE WILL SURELY EXPLODE".  The fact that it
_is_ in the owner's manual could probably get Chrysler off the hook for
a warranty claim, but it's not good business to annoy your customers
that way.  Now, if you went to the airport and put 100 octane av-gas
in your truck, or to the race track and put 110 octane race gas in your
truck, you'd probably be right to worry.  IMHO.

You are ASSuming that burn rate and octane rating are related. also
ASuming higher octane fuel burns slower. This ASumption is not
necessarily true.
The burn rate of a fuel is a measurement of the time required for
complete combustion of the air/fuel mixture. The notion that octane
ratings affect the burn rate of fuel is about 180-degrees from
reality. Burn rate is a function of several variables, and the two are
completely independent. Although there is generally a correlation
between octane ratings and burn rates, the fuel mixture ratio has a
lot more effect on burn rate than octane rating does.

To give you a good example of this,  Jim Wurth from Sunoco Race Fuels.
explains, "A perfect example is Sunoco Maximal, which is our fastest
burning fuel, and coincidentally one of Sunoco’s highest octane fuels
at 116 (R+M)/2. A lot of Pro Stock teams rely on Maximal for those
sub-seven second runs. When they are turning 9,000rpm or more, the
fuel has to burn pretty quickly to achieve complete combustion."

However he also says AVIATION high octane fuel has a significantly
lower burn rate, being designed to run in engines running at 3000RPM
and less. It is not a good idea to run AvGas in a car.
BUT - add a small amount of leaded AvGas to unleaded MoGas, and the
octane increases significantly more than the mathemathical ratio would
suggest, without slowing the burn rate appreciably.

One reason some people think octane and burn rate are related is
because some (most) high octane fuels are lower in Specific Gravity
(below 0.75)than regular unleaded (generally 0.75 or higher), which
causes the engine to actually run leaner. Burn rate of a lean mixture
is slower than burn rate of a rich mixture.

This is not uneducated conjecture - it is from fuel company experts.

Ok, I'm not going to argue this or the reasons for it but lets put your
claim to work.  For a specific fuel type and or make, an increased octane
rating indicates a slower burn rate and nothing that you have said so far
says anything different.  If the computer in the vehicles with this warning
are configured based on the burn rate of REGULAR unleaded with tight
emission tolerances, the slightly slower burn rate of super will cause the
computer to see a rich condition.  Since these computers are configured to
control emissions over performance, it will probably cut back the injector
pulse width to lean out the mixture.  Now according to you, that will slow
the burn rate down even further and may make the computer think that the
problem has not improved enough for the current reduction or may have gotten
worse.  Either way , now it will further lean out the mixture and / or
increase the timing until the O2 sensor indicates that the emissions are
within specifications.  Lean mixtures burn hotter and are far more unstable
and likely to ping than the correct mixture and combined with advanced
timing....   You really need to look at the complete picture.  The computer
controls the mixture depending on what it sees on the emission side and if
it thinks it is delivering too much fuel based on excess unburned fuel
entering the exhaust, it will cut it back, possibly to the point of causing
damage over time.

&gt;&gt; The burn rate of a fuel is a measurement of the time required for

&gt; Really, how?  Octane is a level of fuel stability and it is impossible to

&gt;&gt; Burn rate is a function of several variables, and the two are
&gt;&gt; completely independent. Although there is generally a correlation
&gt;&gt; between octane ratings and burn rates, the fuel mixture ratio has a
&gt;&gt; lot more effect on burn rate than octane rating does.

&gt; Hahahaha, talk about doubletalk.  While as you say, many variables that
&gt; can
&gt; effect the burn rate, there cannot be a correlation between octane ratings
&gt; and burn rate unless octane ratings effect the burn rate as well,
&gt; regardless
&gt; of the effect the mixture or other variables may also have on it.

&gt;&gt; To give you a good example of this,  Jim Wurth from Sunoco Race Fuels.
&gt;&gt; explains, &quot;A perfect example is Sunoco Maximal, which is our fastest
&gt;&gt; burning fuel, and coincidentally one of Sunoco's highest octane fuels
&gt;&gt; at 116 (R+M)/2. A lot of Pro Stock teams rely on Maximal for those

T-Bone - I'm not going to get into an arguement here - but the fact is
that the burn rate varies more from manufacturer to manufacturer,
within the same "grade" of gasoline, than it does from regular to
hi-test in a particular brand.
There are MANY ways to change the octane rating of fuel - some of
which will have more effect on burn rate than others.
I do not think the burn rate has as much effect on the emissions
systems of todays cars as you think it does.
First of all, the O2 sensor, which is the ONLY part of the system that
monitors the mixture, has no idea how much fuel was unburned - only
the amount of oxygen in the exhaust. Granted - this IS a pretty good
indicator of how well the fuel is being burned - but by the time the
slow burning fuel in your description hits the O2 sensor it has more
or less completed it's burn, whether it has converted its heat energy
into torque (cyl pressure) or not.
If the fuel has not completed it's burn, the O2 sensor will sense
excess oxygen, which it will interpret as a LEAN mixture - not rich -
and it will RICHEN the mixture to compensate. Since the mixture
strength has significantly more effect on burn time than octane change
does, the burn time will speed up with the richened mixture,
compensating and bringing the oxygen level in the exhaust back down to
within range. If the O2 level in the exhaust drops too far, the engine
compensates by leaning the engine - which causes the burn rate to slow
down, restarting the cycle. This can happen at close to 8000 times a
minute on a 4 cyl engine at 4000 RPM - or 12000 times a minute at 6000
RPM.
Add to this  the fact that MOST engines now have knock sensors, with
adaptive ignition timing. The engine runs as advanced as possible at
all times. This means the burn time is less critical than if the
engine was running later ignition timing. Timing is only retarded when
the knock count reaches a given (programmed) knock threshold. This
knock threshold is reached earlier with low octane fuel than with
premium.

All of this is NOT to say that some of today's engines MAY not have an
adverse reaction to high-test fuels - but that if they do it is for a
different reason.
A POSSIBLE reason is that IF the burn rate is too slow, and IF that
causes the O2 sensor to tell the computer it is running too lean, and
IF the computer overcompensates, causing the engine to actually run
richer - and IF this causes the engine to carbon up, THIS could
contribute to engine knock/detonation by both raising compression
ratio and causing hot spots in the cyl (glowing carbon).

We KNOW that certain vehicles built in the last 15 years have a carbon
deposit problem under certain conditions, and that this causes
detonation problems on these vehicles. Dodge Colts and Toyota Tercels
are two examples of these vehicles.
Whether fuel octane ratings contribute to this problem or not is
strictly a matter of conjecture at this time - but my FEELING is it
does not - as the problem exists on vehicles run exclusively on
regular fuel - I can't say if it happens as often or as severely as on
vehicles run on hi-test - so this is not the ONLY explanation, if
indeed it is valid at all.
I'm not saying I totally understand the entire combustion process -
but as you may remember I have taught the trade in the past, and have
a little bit more than a passing aquaintance with engines and engine
control systems and theory.
There are a LOT of theories out there - many of which do not stand up
to close scrutiny.
What we DO know is the manufacturers will "cover their behinds" in as
many ways as possible when it comes to legal mumbo-jumbo, and if there
is any possibility that CAFE and or emissions standards MAY be
compromized by use of a given (not manufacturer supplied) product,
they WILL warn against it's use.
But will they fix "known" mechanical or safety problems if the
accountants think they can play the odds and buy off the "victims"
cheaper than fixing the problem???? We all know the answer to that one
too.

Just some more to think about. Have a good weekend.

Excellent response, thank you.  It appears that I got my fuel burn rates
regarding rich / lean mixtures completely backwards, oh well.  Now it looks
to me like those warnings could be to prevent a possible rich run condition
that would cause premature converter failures that the companies would have
to pay for.  You have a good weekend as well and thanks again.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You are ASSuming that burn rate and octane rating are related. also
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ASuming higher octane fuel burns slower. This ASumption is not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; necessarily true.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But it is not false either and I am not the one saying high octane fuel
&gt;&gt; &gt; will
&gt;&gt; &gt; cause damage to certian engines, the MANUFACTURER is!!!   I am simply
&gt;&gt; &gt; giving
&gt;&gt; &gt; a possible reason as to why.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The burn rate of a fuel is a measurement of the time required for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; complete combustion of the air/fuel mixture. The notion that octane
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ratings affect the burn rate of fuel is about 180-degrees from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reality.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Really, how?  Octane is a level of fuel stability and it is impossible
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; make a given fuel more stable without affecting the burn rate.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Burn rate is a function of several variables, and the two are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; completely independent. Although there is generally a correlation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; between octane ratings and burn rates, the fuel mixture ratio has a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lot more effect on burn rate than octane rating does.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hahahaha, talk about doubletalk.  While as you say, many variables that
&gt;&gt; &gt; can
&gt;&gt; &gt; effect the burn rate, there cannot be a correlation between octane
&gt; ratings
&gt;&gt; &gt; and burn rate unless octane ratings effect the burn rate as well,
&gt;&gt; &gt; regardless
&gt;&gt; &gt; of the effect the mixture or other variables may also have on it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To give you a good example of this,  Jim Wurth from Sunoco Race Fuels.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; explains, &quot;A perfect example is Sunoco Maximal, which is our fastest
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; burning fuel, and coincidentally one of Sunoco's highest octane fuels
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at 116 (R+M)/2. A lot of Pro Stock teams rely on Maximal for those
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sub-seven second runs. When they are turning 9,000rpm or more, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fuel has to burn pretty quickly to achieve complete combustion.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you really think that you can put this in your car and it will run
&gt;&gt; &gt; ok?????  You are also comparing apples to airplanes.  This is a racing
&gt;&gt; &gt; fuel
&gt;&gt; &gt; refined for specific needs that are very different than that of
&gt; automotive
&gt;&gt; &gt; fuel.  If you dropped the octane rating of this specific fuel, it would
&gt;&gt; &gt; burn
&gt;&gt; &gt; even faster but at a cost of significant instability that is simply not
&gt;&gt; &gt; worth the small increase in speed.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However he also says AVIATION high octane fuel has a significantly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lower burn rate, being designed to run in engines running at 3000RPM
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and less. It is not a good idea to run AvGas in a car.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It would not be a good idea to put either one of these fuels in a
&gt;&gt; &gt; modern
&gt;&gt; &gt; fuel injected vehicle.  Either one would make the vehicle run like shit
&gt;&gt; &gt; because the computer is not set up for the characteristics of either
&gt;&gt; &gt; one
&gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; these fuels.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BUT - add a small amount of leaded AvGas to unleaded MoGas, and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; octane increases significantly more than the mathemathical ratio would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suggest, without slowing the burn rate appreciably.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But here is the key word, appreciably.  IOW, it WILL slow down the burn
&gt;&gt; &gt; rate, just not by a huge amount.  The problem is that it doesn't have
&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt; slowed down by a huge amount for a computerized emissions specific
&gt;&gt; &gt; computer
&gt;&gt; &gt; to react to it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One reason some people think octane and burn rate are related is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; because some (most) high octane fuels are lower in Specific Gravity
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (below 0.75)than regular unleaded (generally 0.75 or higher), which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; causes the engine to actually run leaner.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You really need to stop talking out of both sides of your mouth.  For
&gt; any
&gt;&gt; &gt; SPECIFIC FUEL TYPE, a change in octane reflects a change in the burn
&gt; rate.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Comparing different fuel formulations and types is like comparing
&gt;&gt; &gt; apples
&gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; grapes, regardless of the octane ratings.  When you can provide proof
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt; for a specific fuel, changes in the octane ratings have no effect AT
&gt;&gt; &gt; ALL
&gt;&gt; &gt; on
&gt;&gt; &gt; the burn rate, then you win and perhaps you can then inform the
&gt;&gt; &gt; manufacturers of the vehicles that they are wrong and should remove
&gt; their
&gt;&gt; &gt; bogus warnings as well but until then...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Burn rate of a lean mixture is slower than burn rate of a rich
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mixture.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Ok, I'm not going to argue this or the reasons for it but lets put your
&gt;&gt; &gt; claim to work.  For a specific fuel type and or make, an increased
&gt; octane
&gt;&gt; &gt; rating indicates a slower burn rate and nothing that you have said so
&gt; far
&gt;&gt; &gt; says anything different.  If the computer in the vehicles with this
&gt;&gt; &gt; warning
&gt;&gt; &gt; are configured based on the burn rate of REGULAR unleaded with tight
&gt;&gt; &gt; emission tolerances, the slightly slower burn rate of super will cause
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; computer to see a rich condition.  Since these computers are configured
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; control emissions over performance, it will probably cut back the
&gt; injector
&gt;&gt; &gt; pulse width to lean out the mixture.  Now according to you, that will
&gt; slow
&gt;&gt; &gt; the burn rate down even further and may make the computer think that
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; problem has not improved enough for the current reduction or may have
&gt;&gt; &gt; gotten
&gt;&gt; &gt; worse.  Either way , now it will further lean out the mixture and / or
&gt;&gt; &gt; increase the timing until the O2 sensor indicates that the emissions
&gt;&gt; &gt; are
&gt;&gt; &gt; within specifications.  Lean mixtures burn hotter and are far more
&gt;&gt; &gt; unstable
&gt;&gt; &gt; and likely to ping than the correct mixture and combined with advanced
&gt;&gt; &gt; timing....   You really need to look at the complete picture.  The
&gt;&gt; &gt; computer
&gt;&gt; &gt; controls the mixture depending on what it sees on the emission side and
&gt; if
&gt;&gt; &gt; it thinks it is delivering too much fuel based on excess unburned fuel
&gt;&gt; &gt; entering the exhaust, it will cut it back, possibly to the point of
&gt;&gt; &gt; causing
&gt;&gt; &gt; damage over time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And those that cannot or do not explain there answers are usually full

&gt; of

&gt;&gt;&gt;shit.

&gt;&gt;Your typical warped logic didn't deserve any explanation.

&gt; What's the matter Miles?  Are you still upset?  Perhaps you should do a
&gt; little research before jumping in and making an ass out of yourself. Perhaps
&gt; if you knew anything about how an engine actually runs and how modern
&gt; emissions systems actually work you would not be so quick to jump in and
&gt; attack.

&gt;&gt;Heres your
&gt;&gt;logic, high octane fuel causes the computer to lean the mixture which
&gt;&gt;causes increased heat which in turn causes detonation (I assume you mean
&gt;&gt;pinging).

&gt; Pretty much, but like I said, if you knew half as much as you think you do,
&gt; you would see the possibility.  To further reduce emissions for areas like
&gt; California where they are very strict, tighter tolerances are required.
&gt; Then when you add the exceptionally high cost of fuel, especially premium,
&gt; it is easy to make the assumption that if a vehicle is not to be used for
&gt; high performance applications, the engine could and would be designed around
&gt; the characteristics of regular unleaded.  This could include things like
&gt; fuel delivery rates, valve timing, ignition timing, computer curves based on
&gt; the fuels rate of burn and anti-knock capabilities .... get the picture
&gt; yet?????

&gt; If the fuel burns slower than the engine and its control computers curves
&gt; were designed for, the O2 sensor is going to detect a false rich run
&gt; condition because some of that fuel is going to enter the exhaust unburned.
&gt; I would think that even you could understand this much.  Now unless your
&gt; engine has variable valve timing, there are really only two ways to deal
&gt; with this situation, increase the timing and/or cut back the fuel.  I would
&gt; hope that even you could understand this much.

&gt; Now, since the fuel curves are based on the properties of regular unleaded
&gt; AND set up for minimum emissions while giving maximum available power, I
&gt; think that it would be fairly easy to assume that the timing would always be
&gt; at or near its maximum setting for any given speed and load.  That would
&gt; leave the computer with the simple choice of reducing the injector pulse
&gt; width (cutting back the fuel amount) to correct what it sees as a rich
&gt; condition.  The problem is that by doing this, what it has actually done is
&gt; cause a lean run condition.

&gt; I guess that you don't know this but unlike a diesel, a gas engine requires
&gt; a very specific air / fuel ration to run properly.  If you run it lean, it
&gt; will increase cylinder temps and reduce power.  I have read posts in here
&gt; where people noticed power loss when running high octane fuel in engines
&gt; where the manufacturer stated not to use it.  Why do you think that is &quot;all
&gt; knowing one&quot;?  This lean run condition also makes the fuel charge unstable
&gt; and combined with the added heat, there is the increased possibility of
&gt; detonation and pre-ignition, both of which can cause damage to the engine,
&gt; hence, the manufacturers claims of &quot;possible engine damage&quot;.  Here is a link
&gt; explaining detonation and pre-ignition.
&gt; http://www.hastingsmfg.com/Service%20Tips/detonation_and_preignition.htm
&gt; Notice the number 1 reason for detonation and the number 4 reason for
&gt; pre-ignition pretty much follows what I was saying.  Then on top of that
&gt; there is the possibility of the increased cylinder wall temps burning off
&gt; the protective film of oil causing increased wear, even without any
&gt; detonation or pre-ignition.  You can also look at the wording from the
&gt; manufacturer.   If they were simply saying not top use premium fuels, you
&gt; could also assume that they were more concerned about the detergents added
&gt; to that grade damaging fuel injection components rather than confusing the
&gt; computer but from what I have seen posted, they were instead specifically
&gt; talking octane ratings which would lead me to believe that they were more
&gt; concerned about the fuel rate of burn and it confusing the computer rather
&gt; than detergent damage.

&gt; Now, does this guarantee that I am correct, nope.  What I am saying is
&gt; simply based on knowledge of how a modern fuel injected engine operates and
&gt; what could go wrong as well as the wording of the warning and symptoms
&gt; reported by posters in this group which is far and away more than anything
&gt; that you have provided so as they say, put up or shut up.

&gt;&gt;Somebody really needs to explain why this is warped to you?

&gt; Yep, so I suggest that you either get started or mind your own business.
&gt; The sad thing is Miles that you do seem to be a bright guy and we could have
&gt; some interesting conversations if you didn't resort to turning everything
&gt; into some sort of personal attack.  I'll admit that I was just as bad at one
&gt; time but I have stopped doing that a while ago.  Perhaps if or when you
&gt; realize that it simply isn't worth the trouble doing that we can get into
&gt; some interesting discussions and or debates...
">

TBone, thank you for this.  I may not be a mechanic but this is exact
sort of explanation I was looking for - con *or* pro.  I missed it
originally in some of the, uh, excess posts my question has engendered,
and I've still to catch up with what is below, but the wording in my
manual does indeed specifically mention octane ratings.  I don't have it
in front of me, but seem to remember it suggested using fuel with no
higher than 87 octane.  95's a bit beyond that.

For those who happen to disagree, please post an explanation as to why
not, unless you have already and I just haven't made it that far down
the thread.

'Course, at the moment the question's moot.  The garage closed the next
day, due to receiving a possibly contaminated load of fuel - just-fueled
vehicles started sputtering nearly immediately after leaving the
station, from what I hear.

&gt;&gt;And yet, even though you call it nonsense, you were once again unable to
&gt;&gt;disprove any of it.  This is really getting to be a habit with you Miles.
&gt;&gt;Instead, you just ramble on making claims that show your complete lack of
&gt;&gt;understanding of the operation of a modern computer controlled fuel injected
&gt;&gt;engine.  And yes, if the slower burn rate of a higher octane fuel confuses
&gt;&gt;the computer and causes it to put the engine into a lean run condition (the
&gt;&gt;number 1 cause of detonation in the link I gave you), it in fact can cause
&gt;&gt;it to PING.  93 octane fuel is far from ping proof and it is obvious that
&gt;&gt;you simply didn't understand anything.  You did however manage to prove me
&gt;&gt;wrong on one point.  I did say that I thought you were a bright guy but
&gt;&gt;after this response....Congratulations.

&gt; You are ASSuming that burn rate and octane rating are related. also
&gt; ASuming higher octane fuel burns slower. This ASumption is not
&gt; necessarily true.
&gt; The burn rate of a fuel is a measurement of the time required for
&gt; complete combustion of the air/fuel mixture. The notion that octane
&gt; ratings affect the burn rate of fuel is about 180-degrees from
&gt; reality. Burn rate is a function of several variables, and the two are
&gt; completely independent. Although there is generally a correlation
&gt; between octane ratings and burn rates, the fuel mixture ratio has a
&gt; lot more effect on burn rate than octane rating does.

&gt; To give you a good example of this,  Jim Wurth from Sunoco Race Fuels.
&gt; explains, &quot;A perfect example is Sunoco Maximal, which is our fastest
&gt; burning fuel, and coincidentally one of Sunoco’s highest octane fuels
&gt; at 116 (R+M)/2. A lot of Pro Stock teams rely on Maximal for those
&gt; sub-seven second runs. When they are turning 9,000rpm or more, the
&gt; fuel has to burn pretty quickly to achieve complete combustion.&quot;

&gt; However he also says AVIATION high octane fuel has a significantly
&gt; lower burn rate, being designed to run in engines running at 3000RPM
&gt; and less. It is not a good idea to run AvGas in a car.
&gt; BUT - add a small amount of leaded AvGas to unleaded MoGas, and the
&gt; octane increases significantly more than the mathemathical ratio would
&gt; suggest, without slowing the burn rate appreciably.

&gt; One reason some people think octane and burn rate are related is
&gt; because some (most) high octane fuels are lower in Specific Gravity
&gt; (below 0.75)than regular unleaded (generally 0.75 or higher), which
&gt; causes the engine to actually run leaner. Burn rate of a lean mixture
&gt; is slower than burn rate of a rich mixture.

&gt; This is not uneducated conjecture - it is from fuel company experts.

Ok, so assuming this is true, how would I figure out if this particular
fuel is safe?

&gt;&gt;But it is not false either and I am not the one saying high octane fuel will
&gt;&gt;cause damage to certian engines, the MANUFACTURER is!!!   I am simply giving
&gt;&gt;a possible reason as to why.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The burn rate of a fuel is a measurement of the time required for
&gt;&gt;&gt;complete combustion of the air/fuel mixture. The notion that octane
&gt;&gt;&gt;ratings affect the burn rate of fuel is about 180-degrees from
&gt;&gt;&gt;reality.

&gt;&gt;Really, how?  Octane is a level of fuel stability and it is impossible to
&gt;&gt;make a given fuel more stable without affecting the burn rate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Burn rate is a function of several variables, and the two are
&gt;&gt;&gt;completely independent. Although there is generally a correlation
&gt;&gt;&gt;between octane ratings and burn rates, the fuel mixture ratio has a
&gt;&gt;&gt;lot more effect on burn rate than octane rating does.

&gt;&gt;Hahahaha, talk about doubletalk.  While as you say, many variables that can
&gt;&gt;effect the burn rate, there cannot be a correlation between octane ratings
&gt;&gt;and burn rate unless octane ratings effect the burn rate as well, regardless
&gt;&gt;of the effect the mixture or other variables may also have on it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;To give you a good example of this,  Jim Wurth from Sunoco Race Fuels.
&gt;&gt;&gt;explains, &quot;A perfect example is Sunoco Maximal, which is our fastest
&gt;&gt;&gt;burning fuel, and coincidentally one of Sunoco's highest octane fuels

&gt;&gt;&gt;sub-seven second runs. When they are turning 9,000rpm or more, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;fuel has to burn pretty quickly to achieve complete combustion.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Do you really think that you can put this in your car and it will run
&gt;&gt;ok?????  You are also comparing apples to airplanes.  This is a racing fuel
&gt;&gt;refined for specific needs that are very different than that of automotive
&gt;&gt;fuel.  If you dropped the octane rating of this specific fuel, it would burn
&gt;&gt;even faster but at a cost of significant instability that is simply not
&gt;&gt;worth the small increase in speed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;However he also says AVIATION high octane fuel has a significantly
&gt;&gt;&gt;lower burn rate, being designed to run in engines running at 3000RPM
&gt;&gt;&gt;and less. It is not a good idea to run AvGas in a car.

&gt;&gt;It would not be a good idea to put either one of these fuels in a modern
&gt;&gt;fuel injected vehicle.  Either one would make the vehicle run like shit
&gt;&gt;because the computer is not set up for the characteristics of either one of
&gt;&gt;these fuels.

&gt;&gt;&gt;BUT - add a small amount of leaded AvGas to unleaded MoGas, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;octane increases significantly more than the mathemathical ratio would
&gt;&gt;&gt;suggest, without slowing the burn rate appreciably.

&gt;&gt;But here is the key word, appreciably.  IOW, it WILL slow down the burn
&gt;&gt;rate, just not by a huge amount.  The problem is that it doesn't have to be
&gt;&gt;slowed down by a huge amount for a computerized emissions specific computer
&gt;&gt;to react to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;One reason some people think octane and burn rate are related is
&gt;&gt;&gt;because some (most) high octane fuels are lower in Specific Gravity
&gt;&gt;&gt;(below 0.75)than regular unleaded (generally 0.75 or higher), which
&gt;&gt;&gt;causes the engine to actually run leaner.

&gt;&gt;You really need to stop talking out of both sides of your mouth.  For any
&gt;&gt;SPECIFIC FUEL TYPE, a change in octane reflects a change in the burn rate.
&gt;&gt;Comparing different fuel formulations and types is like comparing apples to
&gt;&gt;grapes, regardless of the octane ratings.  When you can provide proof that
&gt;&gt;for a specific fuel, changes in the octane ratings have no effect AT ALL on
&gt;&gt;the burn rate, then you win and perhaps you can then inform the
&gt;&gt;manufacturers of the vehicles that they are wrong and should remove their
&gt;&gt;bogus warnings as well but until then...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Burn rate of a lean mixture is slower than burn rate of a rich mixture.

&gt;&gt;Ok, I'm not going to argue this or the reasons for it but lets put your
&gt;&gt;claim to work.  For a specific fuel type and or make, an increased octane
&gt;&gt;rating indicates a slower burn rate and nothing that you have said so far
&gt;&gt;says anything different.  If the computer in the vehicles with this warning
&gt;&gt;are configured based on the burn rate of REGULAR unleaded with tight
&gt;&gt;emission tolerances, the slightly slower burn rate of super will cause the
&gt;&gt;computer to see a rich condition.  Since these computers are configured to
&gt;&gt;control emissions over performance, it will probably cut back the injector
&gt;&gt;pulse width to lean out the mixture.  Now according to you, that will slow
&gt;&gt;the burn rate down even further and may make the computer think that the
&gt;&gt;problem has not improved enough for the current reduction or may have gotten
&gt;&gt;worse.  Either way , now it will further lean out the mixture and / or
&gt;&gt;increase the timing until the O2 sensor indicates that the emissions are
&gt;&gt;within specifications.  Lean mixtures burn hotter and are far more unstable
&gt;&gt;and likely to ping than the correct mixture and combined with advanced
&gt;&gt;timing....   You really need to look at the complete picture.  The computer
&gt;&gt;controls the mixture depending on what it sees on the emission side and if
&gt;&gt;it thinks it is delivering too much fuel based on excess unburned fuel
&gt;&gt;entering the exhaust, it will cut it back, possibly to the point of causing
&gt;&gt;damage over time.

&gt; T-Bone - I'm not going to get into an arguement here - but the fact is
&gt; that the burn rate varies more from manufacturer to manufacturer,
&gt; within the same &quot;grade&quot; of gasoline, than it does from regular to
&gt; hi-test in a particular brand.
&gt; There are MANY ways to change the octane rating of fuel - some of
&gt; which will have more effect on burn rate than others.
&gt; I do not think the burn rate has as much effect on the emissions
&gt; systems of todays cars as you think it does.
&gt; First of all, the O2 sensor, which is the ONLY part of the system that
&gt; monitors the mixture, has no idea how much fuel was unburned - only
&gt; the amount of oxygen in the exhaust. Granted - this IS a pretty good
&gt; indicator of how well the fuel is being burned - but by the time the
&gt; slow burning fuel in your description hits the O2 sensor it has more
&gt; or less completed it's burn, whether it has converted its heat energy
&gt; into torque (cyl pressure) or not.
&gt; If the fuel has not completed it's burn, the O2 sensor will sense
&gt; excess oxygen, which it will interpret as a LEAN mixture - not rich -
&gt; and it will RICHEN the mixture to compensate. Since the mixture
&gt; strength has significantly more effect on burn time than octane change
&gt; does, the burn time will speed up with the richened mixture,
&gt; compensating and bringing the oxygen level in the exhaust back down to
&gt; within range. If the O2 level in the exhaust drops too far, the engine
&gt; compensates by leaning the engine - which causes the burn rate to slow
&gt; down, restarting the cycle. This can happen at close to 8000 times a
&gt; minute on a 4 cyl engine at 4000 RPM - or 12000 times a minute at 6000
&gt; RPM.
&gt; Add to this  the fact that MOST engines now have knock sensors, with
&gt; adaptive ignition timing. The engine runs as advanced as possible at
&gt; all times. This means the burn time is less critical than if the
&gt; engine was running later ignition timing. Timing is only retarded when
&gt; the knock count reaches a given (programmed) knock threshold. This
&gt; knock threshold is reached earlier with low octane fuel than with
&gt; premium.

&gt; All of this is NOT to say that some of today's engines MAY not have an
&gt; adverse reaction to high-test fuels - but that if they do it is for a
&gt; different reason.
&gt; A POSSIBLE reason is that IF the burn rate is too slow, and IF that
&gt; causes the O2 sensor to tell the computer it is running too lean, and
&gt; IF the computer overcompensates, causing the engine to actually run
&gt; richer - and IF this causes the engine to carbon up, THIS could
&gt; contribute to engine knock/detonation by both raising compression
&gt; ratio and causing hot spots in the cyl (glowing carbon).

&gt; We KNOW that certain vehicles built in the last 15 years have a carbon
&gt; deposit problem under certain conditions, and that this causes
&gt; detonation problems on these vehicles. Dodge Colts and Toyota Tercels
&gt; are two examples of these vehicles.
&gt; Whether fuel octane ratings contribute to this problem or not is
&gt; strictly a matter of conjecture at this time - but my FEELING is it
&gt; does not - as the problem exists on vehicles run exclusively on
&gt; regular fuel - I can't say if it happens as often or as severely as on
&gt; vehicles run on hi-test - so this is not the ONLY explanation, if
&gt; indeed it is valid at all.
&gt; I'm not saying I totally understand the entire combustion process -
&gt; but as you may remember I have taught the trade in the past, and have
&gt; a little bit more than a passing aquaintance with engines and engine
&gt; control systems and theory.
&gt; There are a LOT of theories out there - many of which do not stand up
&gt; to close scrutiny.
&gt; What we DO know is the manufacturers will &quot;cover their behinds&quot; in as
&gt; many ways as possible when it comes to legal mumbo-jumbo, and if there
&gt; is any possibility that CAFE and or emissions standards MAY be
&gt; compromized by use of a given (not manufacturer supplied) product,
&gt; they WILL warn against it's use.
&gt; But will they fix &quot;known&quot; mechanical or safety problems if the
&gt; accountants think they can play the odds and buy off the &quot;victims&quot;
&gt; cheaper than fixing the problem???? We all know the answer to that one
&gt; too.

&gt; Just some more to think about.

Not sure, really.  I purchased it overseas, it was built in Detroit,
delivered to Montana, and registered in Virginia.  They did ask where my
residence was, so I'm guessing it meets VA emissions standards, but then
so would a vehicle built to the more rigorous CA specs, right?

Anyway, though some of it was over my head, I did enjoy the actually
informative posts in answer to my question (could have done without the
more numerous name-calling posts, but then that's usenet), though I'm
still not sure if I should use the fuel or not.  I think I'll probably
just use it to top off, since gas coupons are for specific liter
amounts, and thus rarely fill the tank, unless I'm willing to take a loss.

Just so I understand, if I pump high octane fuel, it burns slower, and
may cause the engine to think the mixture's too lean, and make it
richer, right?  Which, if I understood, could cause some sort of cycle
where the mixture will rapidly cycle between too lean and too rich.
It's unclear to me whether this will or won't cause knock or engine
problems further down the line.  I also don't know what would be the
symptoms of such a cycle.  I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

When I buy a vehicle, I buy with the intention of keeping it 'for life',
so it is important to me that I not do something now that may not show
as damage until some time from now.

So, thanks again, gentlemen (for the most part) for a very educational

In my opinion? not very likely. If a car run on premium actually does
run richer, driving it a bit harder (which most premium users will do
by instinct)will help chase out any carbon build-up. If it runs lean,
unless you are chasing it's tail very hard, you will not have an
overheating problem - you may have driveability problems - but I doubt
it. If it runs within specs, no problem.

You MIGHT end up with a damaged catalitic converter, but whether that
would hapen significantly sooner than normal is rather doubtful.

This cycle between too rich and too lean is actually the normal realm
of operation of the emission system. All the O2 sensor can tell the
computer (with the exception of a VERY few select non-chrysler
vehicles) is if the mixture is too rich or too lean. Can't tell it how
much too rich, or how much too lean - so it says "too rich" and the
computer leans the mixture untill the sensor reports "too lean". The
cycle repeats itself, and the average resultant mixture is stoich.

The number of "crossings" indicates the health of the O2 sensor.

Just a quick followup.  Turns out, I shoulda paid attention to the
normal octane level of UK petrol - just got back from a 6-day trip, and
turns out I've been putting 95 octane in my tank every time we take a
trip.  Oddly, the one gas station I use locally, has low octane gas.  If
there's a choice of one, it's always 95 octane.  So, since I've been
using it on and off for a couple of years, whatever damage is already
being done.  After this trip, I noticed a bit of knocking.  I'll put
lower octane in as soon as I use some of this up.

Is there any way to mitigate any damage already done?

Oh, and this'll put things in perspective, the next time you folks in
the US cringe at the gas pumps:  6 day trip.  1,100 miles or so.
Something in the line of $300 worth of fuel.  ARGH!  Last trip we take

There is no damage!!! The only danger there is, is from using less
octane than required not more. I do not know how in the world people
ever started thinking that higher octane will damage engine. That is
bizzare!!!!

&gt; &gt;Just a quick followup.  Turns out, I shoulda paid attention to the
&gt; &gt;normal octane level of UK petrol - just got back from a 6-day trip,
&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt;turns out I've been putting 95 octane in my tank every time we
&gt; &gt;take a
&gt; &gt;trip.  Oddly, the one gas station I use locally, has low octane gas.
&gt; &gt;If
&gt; &gt;there's a choice of one, it's always 95 octane.  So, since
&gt; &gt;I've been
&gt; &gt;using it on and off for a couple of years, whatever damage is already

&gt; &gt;being done.  After this trip, I noticed a bit of knocking.  I'll
&gt; &gt;put
&gt; &gt;lower octane in as soon as I use some of this up.

&gt; &gt;Is there any way to mitigate any damage already done?

&gt; There is no damage!!! The only danger there is, is from using less
&gt; octane than required not more. I do not know how in the world people
&gt; ever started thinking that higher octane will damage engine. That is
&gt; bizzare!!!!

Did you see my reply?  There are two ways that octane is measured, and
three ways that the result of this measurement can be expressed.  In the
US we express it in the average of the two measurements, while
continental Europe (and, I'll bet, the UK) express it as the higher of
the two measurements.  The odds are better than even that the "95
octane" you're buying in the UK is about the same stuff as "89 octane"
in the US.
