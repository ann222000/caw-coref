Hi All,

I will share more at a later time regarding the Mission-Ignition 777 spheres
of transformation and feedback ... but importantly now is the below...

Of late there has been  several messages circulating the internet about the
negative and malovent efforts of Fire The Grid project.

Within the space of  24 hours i've received  more than a dozen emails and
increasing from people whom are concerned ... have raised questions and
expressed their fears with regards to FTG ... all wanting to know my
thoughts  ... opinions and more so that of Blue's regarding that &quot;firing the
grid is our prison&quot; that has been circulating the internet ... I appreciate
that others who have circulated 777 also may have circulated FTG all with
good intentions ...

I have not engaged discussion nor promoted various initiatives except two
(Tom Kenyon and World Hoop Day) that were occuring on 777, but in particular
i've never made mention or promoted FTG 7/17 ... this is purely because it
does not resonate with me nor does it resonate with Blue ...

These people whom have expressed concern and are questioning FTG have simply
used their inner intuition ... inner guidance ... and are not simply
following the status quo or getting caught up in the feel-good /
self-gratification emotion of it and going along for the ride because it is
the &quot;new age&quot; fad-thing to do ...

The world is transforming and so are people ... we all need to develope ..
grow ... our own inner guidance ... intuition for truth and spiritual values
... connection to higherself or source and become self empowered ... from
inside rather than relying on external hive-mind mechanisms ...

For now i wish to highlight my concerns regarding FTG.... as you would have
read in several recent posts but in particular &quot;ignition point 777&quot; ....
Blue brought forward some awareness about the frequency fence / filter and
those whom will come later to negate efforts made to remove the fence/filter
but keep it in place ...

you can review this post :

To one level or another we are all instruments ... the question is
instruments to what or whom ? .... and whom or what does it serve ? Is it
self serving or in service to others .... is it inclusive or exclusive ...
does it ask or force you to do something against your will or when you are
not ready yet? ...

Does it empower you or does it ask you for your power ... is it something
you can do yourself individually applying it to your personal sphere and
those you interact with ... or does it require ritual and group effort i.e.
cult/hive-mind .... (peer group pressure) ...

Don't take my or Blue's word for it ... watch the FTG video's all 8 of them
... in particular part 5 to 8 .... listen with an open mind and heart ...
and decide for yourselves ...

In all 40 years since rebirth/nde i've known Blue within ... never ever have
they asked me to do anything i wasn't prepared or ready to do or against my
will  ... if anything i'm further behind from where they would have liked
for me to be ... i've never been asked to mutilate my body as a sign of
commitment ... but rather empowered to seek purification ...

It's been about the return to self-empowerment and individual uniqueness ...
inner and personal transformation ... there has never been a quest to return
to tribal mentality ... if anything further from it for those who know and
have read Blue's KYOYS series (know yourself / own yourself) is the order of
the day .... no tribes here ... no global council here ... no charity here
... no funneling of resources into one channel ....

What is required is equal distribution and open-sourceness rather than the
funneling and centralisation models that the FTG promote ... and not a
return to old-paradigm models and structures that have not served us in
by-gone aeons and now of centralisation and hive-tribe-mind ...

who is (behind) the global council ?

Please be discerning and use your inner guidance and inner senses for all
things ... feel for yourself ... trust your own inner being ...

The below is a quick rough transcription of part 5 ... but will give you a
lead-in to the other videos if you watch them yourself ... nice good things
mixed in with not so resonating vibes ...

Fire the Grid-Part 5

(0:53-1:05)
...&quot;Please give me the words,&quot; because I was faking it till I make it.  I
was in obligation mode.  I wasn't in faith mode.  I certainly wasn't in
trust mode.  So I said, &quot;If you want me to speak to the world, you better
give me the words.&quot;

(1:08-1:34)
Apparently I was really good, but it wasn't me.  I was a vessel that night
and I allowed myself to be a vessel with enthusiasm and the
excitement...well I didn't feel any of that.  I felt pissed off and
disconnected and like I didn't want to do it.  So the fact that I came
across with enthusiasm and all that stuff I KNOW wasn't me, but it went off
really well.  That was the catalyst.

(1:56-2:20)
But still I wasn't walking the path.  I was still doing it out of
obligation, so it was a lot more difficult to do stuff out of obligation
than to do stuff out of joy and love.  So I hated doing it...Oh God I gotta
talk about this again?  So I did the radio shows and I did everything I was
supposed to do, and it grew and grew and grew and grew.

(2:38-3:20)
July of 2006 --that's a long time to be walking a path that you're not even
sure you believe--I'm in the bathtub and these beings show up and they say,
&quot;We need a commitment.  We can't keep doing this.  We need you to be in.
Are you in or are you out?&quot;  Now my first reaction was to say, &quot;I'm out.
Fine.  If I'm getting an ultimatum, I'll go.  Thanks for that.  See ya.&quot;

(3:52-2:56)
So they said, &quot;Look, the instructions to walk this path are very simple...&quot;

(4:39-4:42)
Ok so I'm sitting in the bathtub and I said, &quot;Well ok I can commit...&quot;

(4:47-4:59)
&quot;...I will commit.&quot; And the next thing I know this song comes on the radio
by Dido and it was &quot;This land is mine, but I'll let you rule, I'll let you
navigate and command...&quot;

(5:29-5:57)
So I got up that night from the bathtub, and I had made a commitment that I
was gonna follow the path.  That meant taking three tangible tokens.

(7:27-8:08)
My tangible things I had to do to prove myself to me, not to them--Shelley
is the hindrance here--Shelley the human needed something tangible.  They
asked me to put this tattoo on my arm.  I didn't do it for four years
because it's a freakin tattoo of a snake.  I'm like a biker chick.  But what
they said this tattoo symbolized to Shelley the human was a commitment that
I was making.  But what it meant on a bigger message to me the human, so
that I can share with you, is a return to a tribal mentality, a return to
one race, one tribe...

(8:24-8:56)
...and that this snake is that symbol because it's an Ouroboros so it was a
snake eating its own tail in the very first meditation image.  The second
one was Alpha and the Omega and the snake twisted itself and they said the
Alpha and the Omega is a christian-based symbol for the infinity and so is
the snake eating its own tail, but the snake eating its own tail is a
tribal, ancient mark, and not until humanity embraces the ancient ways of a
tribal mentality are they going to move forward in their search for the
future.
