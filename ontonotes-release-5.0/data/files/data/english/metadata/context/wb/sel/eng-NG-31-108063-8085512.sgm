Live in Florida and my plant is located on our screened in pool area.
Get's plenty of sun and I guess is an outdoor plant.

I have small white bugs in my hibiscus buds and leaves. Just planted
it about 1 month ago. The plant is still blooming but many leaves have
turned yellow and have fallen off leaving the bush look very bare and
sickly.

I sprayed some insecticidal soap on it about 1 week ago and then
during the week I have been spraying the leaves and buds off with a
jet of water.

It looks like the leaves are starting to grow back towards the ends of
the bush but the middle of the plant is still very bare. Plus the bugs
are still there, it seems like I am just keep the population under
slight control.

I was thinking about letting some lady bugs go in the yard to eat the
bugs and also spraying the soap again too.

I also need to fertilize it as well.

What order should I do this in and is there anything I am missing or
should avoid? Further, how long should I wait in betwene treatments /
steps? Any help is greatly appreciated.
