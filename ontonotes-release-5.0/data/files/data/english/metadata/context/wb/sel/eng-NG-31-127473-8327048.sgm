He'd had a rough life.  Various hostilities left their scars on him.  It
seemed things were being orchestrated to send him to his grave.  How was he
to survive?

Every homicidal current directed at him had to either stop or die itself,
instead.  Some of these sources of hatred turned against him were so rooted
in that no amount of love he could show would neutralize them.  The had to
be isolated and quarantined if he was to survive them.

It was as though they said to him, &quot;If you love us, you'll die for us.&quot; and
&quot;If you die for us, we'll love you.&quot; He was wise to the scam, though.  &quot;The
purpose of being born into the world is to grow, prosper, and live as long
as possible,&quot; he believed.  Every attitude that wanted him dead was against
evolution.  Since their efforts failed, everything that didn't kill him only
made him stronger.

A hook from the left, a hook from the right.  They tried and tried, over and
over.  They couldn't perfect a knockout.  He only grew stronger from both of
them.  Two against one, and the one survived, stronger than the two.  Then
the one isolate one of the two with a fatal knockout.

When he was avenged of every attitude embarked to hurt him, he nestled into
a little peace of mind of his own.  Although he didn't know where all of
these hostilities came from, or how he was avenged of them, he knew he was
avenged of them, by the better peace of mind he felt, despite the heartaches
and anguishes he had to endure to arrive at that point.

The entire foundation of Jack Powelson's strategy is based on provoking any
kind of reaction to him, negative or positive, and using that emotion to
gain entry, move in and take over.  It's all about control, manipulation and
tyranny.  If he doesn't like someone he'll use the technique to hurt them,
or kill them if he can.  He enters people through their unconscious minds.
He has a fascination with the unconscious mind.  He uses it as a tool to get
his way with people.  It seems he has appointed himself with a free ticket
to violate anyone's privacy he so fancies.  It seems that a woman who spent
her whole life with a man, is probably more influenced by that man, than by
a man who only met her once for a week, sent her some letters, and wrote
posts about her on the internet.  It seems that Jack's contribution as an
influence on Carolyn far outweighs my own.  It seems that he smothered her
to death with his sexual impalement in order to make her 100% his own.
