Fascist community,
police-America,
supremacy disorder,
Bush's land of white pride.
Glamour is grass,
Glamour is community permits for flowers,
Glamour is the disgusting Republican,
Glamour is pride of the American Militant.

A mindset of war,
eat, vote, work,
erecting Iraq as a model for all Arabs
is the brain, the cop
in the fascist militant's land of radical extremist zoning.

The sound of police sirens chasing niggers,

Patrol and Command the zoned landscape,
Community Pride rules farms indivisibly with flags
with regulations stricter than a Commercial Center in New York.

The flags on a farm are the picture.

The secret police is watching him,

USA. Illegal supremacy and cultural violation of human rights.
Illegal fascist mentality. An illegal racist country who just
collapsed with a racist war in Iraq (erecting Iraq as a model
for all Arab countries, a country better than 1.n billion Arabs).
Unlivable conditions in and out of the USA.
