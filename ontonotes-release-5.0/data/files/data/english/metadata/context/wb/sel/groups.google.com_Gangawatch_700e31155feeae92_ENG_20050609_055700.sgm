RIVER Sutra

Prayag, Triveni, Allahabad - call this ancient city by any name and it
continues to draw pilgrims from round the world throughout the year.
The major attractions arethe kumbh melas held every year, the ardh
kumbh every 6 years and the mahakumbhonce in 12 years.

But there are two parallel attractions in the holy city that
presidesover the union of three rivers, the Ganga, Yamuna and mythical
Saraswati. One isthe Sangam itself, where the ashes of the departed are
surrendered to the swirling waters once the rituals are complete and
the demands of foraging pandas arefulfilled.

Prayag is so named as it presides over the confluence of rivers.
TheTriveni Sangam is also where the believer comes to take a holy dip
hoping that thetriumvirate of waters will somehow cleanse her of all
ills in a churning centrifugal motion, like a giant washing machine.

The other attraction is the Anand Bhawan (Abode of Joy), the ancestral
home of theNehrus, India's first family that commands an impressive
following. For historybuffs and for the politically inclined, a trip to
Anand Bhawan is no different from one to the Sangam.

After all, the manthan by freedom fightrs like Motilal Nehru,
MahatmaGandhi and others took place in this building, yielding the
amrit of freedom to a country bound by British rule.

First, we headed for the riverbank where pandas, boatmen and guides
swooped down upon us like vultures. Each one out-shouted the other,
intent on annexing our undivided attention. Desperate to put an end to
the tamasha, we settled for Raj Kumar's boat, won over by his little
brother-in-law's smile.

We had to literally release our armsfrom the vice-like grip of priests
who insisted on accompanying us on the boat tothe Sangam point. &quot;You
will be damned if you do not perform appropriate rituals,&quot; yelled one
of them. We chose to be damned.

The boatmen paddled us peacefully to the Triveni sangam point, where I
quizzed Rajkumar about the mythical Sarswati. &quot;Memsahib, cut off a
lock of your hair and throw it in the water here and you will see it
getting dragged underneath bySaraswati's current.&quot; Deep faith is no
laughing matter.

He also explained why Saraswati was unseen - she was like one of the
three strands of hair that go tomake a plait. Only two strands are
visible; the third remains hidden. Keeping a straight face and hoisting
myself out of the boat was quite an achievement.

We got onto the wooden platform made for use of pilgrims who throng the
spot to carry out vows and rituals, mostly related to praying for the
souls of the departed. My sister and I stepped into the cool waters
that came barely to our shoulders. There was no stench and no garbage.
The waters seemed to be clean.

According to Hindu mythology, the gods and the asuras once got together
to churn the ocean of milk. Among others things, the manthan yielded
both a deathly poison and a kumbh or pot of amrit (nectar of
immortality). While Shiva swallowed the poison and came to be known as
Neelkanth, the gods and demons fought over the amrit.

In the ensuing struggle, four drops fell in four places and they
acquired holy status because of this: Prayag, Hardwar, Nasik and
Ujjain. Hence the holding of thevarious kumbh melas at these places,
commemorating the manthan and its fruits.

Bath over, we scrambled onto the platform and got back into the boat
that took us ashore. We drove past the maidan where tents are normally
pitched for the kumbh mela. The driver informed us that during the
Kumbh, it becomes difficult to see the sand for the people. He added,
&quot;It doesn't require faith to welcome the mega event that does wonders
for the local economy.&quot; We couldn't agree more.

We head straight for the Abode of Joy, for that was the name chosen by
Motilal Nehru for the house he moved into in 1900. Jawaharlal, his son,
was married to Kamala Kaul here and their daughter, Indira
Priyadarshini, was born here. Mahatma Gandhi initiated the
non-cooperation movement from Anand Bhawan where a bonfire was made of
foreign-made goods. As the birthplace of the Swaraj party, it is also
known as Swaraj Bhawan.

The historic building and precincts were made into a national memorial
and opened to the public in 1989. We queued up to see an audiovisual
presentation in Anand Bhawan. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was
insipid and badly produced; we walked out mid-presentation.

A raised platform, painted russet, with a tulsi shrub at its centre
stands in the garden in front of the house. A plaque informs the
visitor that this was where Kamala Nehru's ashes were kept for 28 years
till they were immersed in the sangam with her husband's.

There's no getting away from the sangam, wherever you go to in
Allahabad, a name given to Prayag by Mughal emperor Akbar who built a
magnificent fort on the banks of the Triveni. Prayag has a hoary
history of myths and legends, the most popular of which is the churning
of the ocean and the existence of a subterranean Saraswati.

The sangam experience far exceeded our expectations while the Abode of
Joy disappointed us. On that note, we wound our way out of Tirth Raj -
the king of pilgrimage centres - and took the road to another holiest
of holy cities, Kashi, a bare 128 km away. And we knew instinctively
that Shiva's favourite city would have many surprises in store for us.
