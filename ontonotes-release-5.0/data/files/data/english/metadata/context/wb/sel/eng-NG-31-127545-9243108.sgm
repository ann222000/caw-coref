4.7 tonnes of rubbish collected from Kudat beach

KUDAT: About 4.7 tonnes of non-recyclable items and 110 kilogrammes of recyclable items were collected during a beach-clean up project here in conjunction with the district's environmental week.

Project facilitator Lee Yoke Lee said more than 140 people gathered to tackle the piles of garbage that lined the beach in front of Sekolah Menengah St Peter Kudat.

&quot;The purpose of the beach clean-up, which was held in conjunction with Kudat Environmental Week, is to create awareness of the importance of waste management,&quot; she said.

The stretch of beach confronting the school is bordered by two different environments - the immaculate grounds of Kudat Golf and Marina Resort on one side and the stilt houses of Kampung Tanjung Kapor on the other.

Lee, who is a marine biologist from WWF-Malaysia, explained that the purpose of the event was not just to pick up trash, but also to spread the message on how each individual could help our environment by practising good waste management.

She said this included separating recyclable products such as plastic bottles, paper, glass and aluminium from non-recyclable products.

According to her, the impact of recycling on the environment was considerable, as some products would take a long time to decompose.

&quot;The effect of products on the environment can be gauged from its decomposition rate. Steel cans take 50 years to decompose, cigarette butts 80 years and glass bottles do not decompose at all,&quot; said Lee.

A friendly football match was played between the local football team from Kampung Bawang Jamal and participants at the end of the day.

The beach clean-up was jointly organised by WWF-Malaysia and Kudat Turtle Conservation Society, supporting the national celebration of Malaysian Environment Week.
