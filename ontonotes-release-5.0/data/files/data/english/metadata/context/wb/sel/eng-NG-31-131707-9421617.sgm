I just received the instrument today. Yuris did a great job on the frets. It
plays really nice. Everything Yuris touches turns to gold! Michael did a
great job too! :-)

The back braces and seam reinforcement seem to be cedro on this guitar.  Is
there a reason a luthier would use that rather than good,  well quartered
spruce which is stiffer in relationship to mass?

My 1930 Santos Hernandez had cedro back braces,  and those had failed over
time,  as have the majority of cedro braces I've encountered.

Right Kevin!  I'm as shocked as you are to see this guitar still in
one piece. Usually they self destruct after a couple of years.

I would definitely think twice about buying this guitar.  As you can
see it has cedro back bracing and center joint
reinforcements.......buyer be warned!

I think I may have sold this guitar  to a person in New Jersey  a few
years back , I may have pictures of the guitar on my home PC. I try
to  remember to check tonight. I did sell a 1992 Elevated Fingerboard
to a very fine  person in N.J.

Michael, you did  played the MT Elevated Fingerboard 1992 ( or was it
a 1991I had )  it in my place in Brooklyn  a few years back  while you
showed me a new guitar of yours ( very nice spruce top)  I guess you
could have  made  a few elevated fingerboard guitars  in 1990's. As I
recalled, you like the guitar and thought is held up well. Maybe you
where just being kind to me :&gt;)

I sold  the early 1990's MT w/elevated fingerboard  I'm  guessing
between 2002 and 2005  , I got around $2500  for the guitar  from a
person who tried out many we had. I tend not  to be over price.

$1900 is a very fair price.

okay back to doing inventory. .  god I hate doing inventory ..
thanks  for the coffee break.

Ed, I met you I believe in 1999.  Those were the days my wife worked
in NYC. for 2 weeks out of each month.  Her company Booze Allen would
fly me out there and put us up at the Parker Meridian, next door to
Carnige Hall....those were the days, care free access to the fruits of
Manhattan.

Anyway, I remember you had a spruce elevated fingerboard of mine which
Lorimer  thought sounded too nasaly due to the treble bar, he didn't
like guitars with treble bars.  I recall you sold the guitar soon
after we met....I think?

The first time I had seen an elevated fingerboard was on a guitar,
Ruck sent me, to give to a client of his in San Francisco who was
staying with me.  Ruck told me he was the inventor of the elevated
fingerboard.  After seeing it I made a few. However, I ended up not
promoting them as something I offer because I'm too attached to the
look and ascetics of the traditional guitar.

Forgive an old steel-string builder for being ignorant of most things
classical,  but is M.Thames the same 'MT' who posts as 'Themtesticles'?
Haven't figured out everyones' secret identity here yet.;-)

I didn't mean to be critical or rude when I asked about those cedro braces,
just want to know if there is some sort of rationale for using them,  since
I have seen them on a number of classicals and flamencos over the years.
Of course I've also seen mahogany braces on the top of some Martin
classicals,  and that makes even less sense to me.

I have built a number of classicals and flamencos,  but pretty much gave up
on 'em 15 or 20 years ago because I just don't speak the same language as
most of the rubber-string brigade.   I have no classical playing technique
at all,  and had to rely on feedback from those who do.   I found that very
difficult,  since many of the classical players I encountered talked purest,
wholesale,  chromium plated horseshit from sunup to midnight.    When I was
lucky enough to bump into one who actually knew his arse from his elbow I
learned a lot but the rest of the time I found very frustrating.

Now that I'm about 90% retired my interest in good classicals has rekindled
and I'm trying to figure out what exactly makes a first class guitar on my
own.   In the intervening years a chap who was my apprentice for about 5
years has become a very good classical player.  That's a huge bonus for me
since he can well and truly evaluate individual guitars from a players'
standpoint plus he has a good grounding in instrument construction and
repair.

Now I no longer need to produce a steady stream of dreadnoughts and other
pre-war Martin knockoffs in order to put the steaks on the table,  and I'm
enjoying pottering about playing with things which have piqued my curiosity
over the years.

There must be some reason folks used those cedro braces,  because they seem
to crop up fairly regularly.  Could it be as simple as the material happened
to be handy way back when some of the old heavyweights were building to a
tight deadline,  and subsequent builders copied 'em?  Copying is a perfectly
reasonble way to develop instruments,  but it pays to keep your wits about
you when sorting what to copy and what to ignore.

Seems to me I encountered an ebony guitar by Eric Sahlin about 1981,  and
that had cedro back braces.  The back on that folded up completely with
about 6 or 7 major splits,  some almost full length,  in it's first year of
existence.  It was otherwise beautifully built,  I remember.  At the time I
chalked that up to the vaguaries of ebony for use as backs plus our
unfortunate Canadian climate and less than perfect attention to relative
humidity.

All the best,
KH

I have a Hippner Hauser based guitar made from ebony and German
spruce.  As a lute player with some experience with ebony bodies, I
had it lined with cypress and finished inside and out.  After 2 years
of hard use it has yet to show any cracks, etc.

Of course, it could be because Darren Hippner is a gifted builder.

Kevin sorry for the sarcasm.  Cedro has been used traditionally on
classical guitars from the time of Torres.  Torres used it for necks,
linings and braces. etc.  Finding good cedro is highest on my list for
making a good guitar.  Early on I used mahogany for necks but after I
tried real cedro it was a revelation in sound. A cedro neck imparts
warmth as opposed to mahogany which imparts a thinner tone.

I don't think I've ever seen a classical guitar without cedro back

I know this from experiance....I sent an ebony guitar to Singapore
once from Santa Fe 3 months latter it had swelled up like a balloon,
not only did the bracing all fail, but it pushed the purfling off the

Thanks for that MT.   I've used cedro for a fair number of flamenco and uke
necks,  and used it for kerfed linings for years so am familiar with its
properties.  I quite agree with you about the effect of it as a neck wood.
As a rule,  harder more dense neck woods produce great volume but add an
unpleasant harsh edge to the sound.   The ultimate expression of this can be
heard in instruments with solid rosewood necks,  like the Selmer Macaferri
owned by Diz Dizley.   That was re-necked in the 50s or 60s in East Indian
rosewood,  resulting in possibly the loudest Mac in captivity.

When a client ordered a banjo years ago and his main stipulation was that it
had to be LOUD,  I built up a normal 'pot',  and whittled a Braz. neck for
it.   That thing made astonishing amounts of a sound I didn't particularly
want to hear.  He was tickled pink.

Back around 1976 or '77 when I worked at Martin I remember Dick Boak working
on prototypes for a proposed Martin solid body.   Somehow he mistook  a lump
of cedro ( which Martin had on hand to cut into kerfed linings) for mahogany
and used that for the body.  Needless to say sustain left something to be
desired.

I have no doubt the cedro in the neck has a great and positive effect on
sound,  but I can't see it making nearly that difference when used as back
braces.  Good spruce stock could be made considerably less bulky while
retaining the same resistence to deformation,  surely?   Shouldn't less mass
on the back and less intrusion into the air cavity be positive things?   I'm
not suggesting you are wrong here,  just trying to figure out the pros and
cons.

We also agree on ebony as a body material.  Another poster has mentioned
having an ebony gtr. lined,  but I can't see that being a viable cure.   If
ebony wants to move,  you could laminate it to half-inch guage plate and it
would still shift.    When buying ebony in bulk you usually buy it 'wet',
and anticipate anywhere up to 70% losses during the drying process.  Hairy
stuff.

I also notice you used a rosewood bridge on the gtr. in question and found
that interesting.  As I confessed earlier I don't pretend to be a classical
builder or player,  but I have found that I can hear a definite difference
between rosewood and ebony bridges on the classicals and flamencos I have
built,  and I generally prefer the rosewood.   I'm not a huge fan of
Brazillian rosewood as a body material ( especially the stuff which is
available these days) but I do like the sound of a Braz. bridge,  especially
on a w.r.c. top.

Thanks for taking the time to answer my prev. question.

&gt; Right Kevin! I'm as shocked as you are to see this guitar still in
&gt; one piece. Usually they self destruct after a couple of years.

&gt; I would definitely think twice about buying this guitar. As you can
&gt; see it has cedro back bracing and center joint
&gt; reinforcements.......buyer be warned!
&gt; MT

Kevin sorry for the sarcasm.  Cedro has been used traditionally on
classical guitars from the time of Torres.  Torres used it for necks,
linings and braces. etc.  Finding good cedro is highest on my list for
making a good guitar.  Early on I used mahogany for necks but after I
tried real cedro it was a revelation in sound. A cedro neck imparts
warmth as opposed to mahogany which imparts a thinner tone.

I don't think I've ever seen a classical guitar without cedro back
bracing , lining, and necks coming out of Spain.  Some American makers
like Ruck still use mahogany for necks.  I had a conversation with
Ruck about this once, and he seemed puzzled why anyone would use cedro
for necks.

Concerning Ebony for back and sides.  I don't think the problem is
with the cedro braces.  Ebony is a bad choice for back and side
because it swells and shrinks more than any other hard wood I have
ever used.  Nothing will stay glued to ebony if it decsides to swell
up.

I know this from experiance....I sent an ebony guitar to Singapore
once from Santa Fe 3 months latter it had swelled up like a balloon,
not only did the bracing all fail, but it pushed the purfling off the
edges.  Needless to say that was the last ebony guitar I ever made.

In my opionon Cedro is a key ingerdiant in a good classical guitar.

You must have exceeding bad luck.
Although, a longitudinal center seam will sometimes split if the grain

Now that's interesting.  Just about every gtr. I've encountered with cedro
back braces has had back problems.   I wonder if that has more to do with
our Canadian climate and ignorance of humidity control on the part of
owners?

As a result of my repair experiences I've never used cedro for braces of any
sort.

Lorimer  plays a Angella ( so did I until I sold it last month to

I ran the center strip with the grain on the guitar David is selling
because I saw some Rominillios guitars done this way.  I think I read
somewhere that Rominillios thinks this is the better way. Regardless,
I can't recall seeing a center strip fail on mine, or any guitar
regaurdless of the direction of the grain.
I like the look of the center strip not runing with the grain
thesedays and probably made 3 guitar with it runing with the grain.

However, of all the fun things you can do with cedro you can get
very creative with the linings. I think this has one of the most
profound effects of any single factor on the direction you want to
take the sound.

After watching the Barrett Jackson auto auction, on the Speed Channel,
these hi end $30,000 guitars are starting to look like a good
investment. A Porsche Speedster 1955 went for $150,000! It was said,
that was a low price. Now, that's what I need, a Porsche Speedster to
drive to my restaurant gig; naturally with a $30,000 Rodriquez or
Hauser in the passenger's seat. I'll bet MT's ebay goes for $3,352.00

Michael,

Could you elaborate on what you've said about linings affecting the
sound?
Thanks,

&gt; &gt; 2k is a good price if the guitar is anything like the one I had of

&gt; It is an fantastic guitar for $2K. That is what the owner wanted to start
&gt; the bidding at. A great deal to start 2008 with!

It's always a little scary to see a guitar that's 15 years old.
Sometimes I see them and think what the hell was I thinking!  This one
seems to have done well, and I'm pleased with the ascetic.  I hope she

It is in great shape. I like it better than the two you built for Trevin.
This one blows them away! My friend has had it for many years, but it has
just been sitting in a closet. Best bargain on ebay!

&gt; I ran the center strip with the grain on the guitar David is selling
&gt; because I saw some Rominillios guitars done this way.  I think I read
&gt; somewhere that Rominillios thinks this is the better way. Regardless,
&gt; I can't recall seeing a center strip fail on mine, or any guitar
&gt; regaurdless of the direction of the grain.
&gt;   I like the look of the center strip not runing with the grain
&gt; thesedays and probably made 3 guitar with it runing with the grain.

Right.  Romanillos does.  Rodriquez did.  I don't think it matters
unless the guitar is stressed (abuse or drastic climate change).  In
fact, it would act as a stiffener and could be good for sound.  It is
certainly easier to make and shape such a center strip.

I echo the request of SDluthier.   Michael, tell us about cedrella and
linings?

I use either the Dunlap 6100 or the 6105.  Both are about the
same height but the 6100 are wider. Mostly I prefer the 6105 as the
6100 are a real chore to true up.  I recently got some stainless steel
frets, but after they arrived I realized they are as&quot; stiff as a
pecker on a wedding night&quot;. I got that expression from Gilbert who
used to say that about his bridges!

Have either of you ever used Dunlop 6150?  They are .042&quot; tall and .
102&quot; wide.  Jeremy Perks of Rudy's shop here in NY recommended them to
me and I've had them used on my last few guitars, I love their
playability.
