Cherry,

At present orthopod list is at google server and I do not think that there
is a size limit for attachment( someone please correct me if I am wrong).
However as a consideration for members like us having dial up connection,
you can continue to limit size of images.

There is a limit of 2 mb of total mail size but I say that if we can manage to keep the mail size under 100k then it is easy to download the messages easily

Sure is good to have a size image limit because some of us use blackberry or
others use slow connection and download some huge image is gonna block our
system.

Just take a time to reduce it for respect to the others that do not have all
the tech that we have.
