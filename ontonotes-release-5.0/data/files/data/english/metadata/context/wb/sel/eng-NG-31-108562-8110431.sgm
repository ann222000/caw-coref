May be off subject if so let me know where else to post
I have an Ariens ZTR 1742 mower with a 17 HP B&amp;S engine that has been
afterfiring ( After ingnition is turned off raw gas collects in the muffler
and explodes) since I got it .This destroys the muffler and I need replace
another $90 one so I thought I'd look into why its happening.
When I checked into it there is an afterfire solenoid on the carb that is
supposed to shut off the fuel supply when the ignition is turned off. Ariens
didn't do this and as a result the solenoid which is powered from the
alternator does not disengage until the alternator ( and engine ) has almost
stopped so I get feul in the muffler.

When I called Ariens they admited to the problem and sent me a new ignition
switch that is supposed to fix the problem. When I got it it was clear that
this would not switch teh solenoid power and when I called again I was told
that the fix was internal to the switch and did not need any cabling.

When I pressed for how it was done teh engineer told me that rather than
switch off the solenoid they simply shorted it to ground when teh ignition
was turned off.
While I agree this will fix the afterfire it does so by applying a short
across the alternator while its still at speed.

So my question is am I trading a annual muffler replacement for a much more
expensive Alternator problem down the road
Thanks
in Advance

Is the fuel exploding because there is a spark that causes it, or is
it just the fuel accumulation in the hot exhaust system.  If it is
anything electrical, you should keep the ignition off/ shorted out
until the engine stopsrotating.

I own an ancient Hayterette with a B&amp;S engine.
Not prone to back/misfires but to stop it I just pull the HT cap off the
spark plug. As originally a bare metal cap I adapted an old bakelite knob to
cover it.
I've always the opposite problem - starting , as usual with these mowers, to
start  - its always take off the airfilter cover and teaspoon of petrol in
the inlet chmber. Apparently something to do with a carburetor that can be
taken up and down slopes without playing up.

The fuel is exploding because its accumalating in the exhaust after the
spark is removed. The carbirator continues to feed fuel to the cylinder and
its just passed through. The solenoid used on the carburator is intended to
immediately shut off the fuel when you turn the engine off. The problem is
that the design ties the somenoid to the alternator rather than switching it
off . The alternator continues to product voltage after the spark is stopped
which defeats teh purpose of the soleniid.

This is a different issue caused by  fuel in the muffler. If I pull the plug
cap it still happens because even without the spark the engine continues to
pull fuel/Air into the cylinder and then sends it out to th emuffler where
its ignited by the hot muffler.The issue is that the mechanism to shut down
teh fuel is delayed by the bad design which I believe just got worst by the
&quot;fix&quot; which shouts out the alternator output

The older B &amp; S engines had a low current self limiting alternator, it
had only a fuse for circuit protection. Those would not fail if shorted
with the engine running, they only put out about 2A charging current.

Some larger engines had a voltage regulator those would fail if shorted
while the engine was running. Theese put out about 10A charging current.

Solenoids were not installed until a few years ago and engines have
been around for much longer than that.  On the lawnmower I use the
book calls it a SAFETY solenoid and it is connect to various limit
switches (along with the ignition switch) which shut the engine off if
you do something prohibited.
I have had several lawnmowers with the same type of engine and no
solenoid that performed extremely well and had no afterfiring
problems. Perhaps you should look further into the problem.

Put a switch on the wire to the solenoid and turn it off that way.

Thanks given this alternator is a 9 Amp unit I'll put a switch ( or Relay )
directly in the solenoid circuit so I don't damage teh solenoid

It's possible that the engine is dieseling, that can happen with some carbon
buildup in the combustion chamber. It could also be running very rich and
accumulating excess fuel in the exhaust.

I considered that but don't believe thats the case I pulled the heads last
year and there was minimal carbon which I removed.Also if it was dieseling
wouldn' the fuel ignite while in teh power stroke with the exhaust valve
closed ?
I also considered all the fuel wasn't being burnt but assume that would
cause afterfire randomly not only when I turned teh ignition off

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have an Ariens ZTR 1742 mower with a 17 HP B&amp;S engine that has been

&gt;&gt; Solenoids were not installed until a few years ago and engines have
&gt;&gt; been around for much longer than that.  On the lawnmower I use the
&gt;&gt; book calls it a SAFETY solenoid and it is connect to various limit
&gt;&gt; switches (along with the ignition switch) which shut the engine off if
&gt;&gt; you do something prohibited.
&gt;&gt;  I have had several lawnmowers with the same type of engine and no
&gt;&gt; solenoid that performed extremely well and had no afterfiring
&gt;&gt; problems. Perhaps you should look further into the problem.

&gt; It's possible that the engine is dieseling, that can happen with some
&gt; carbon buildup in the combustion chamber. It could also be running very
&gt; rich and accumulating excess fuel in the exhaust.

Dieseling in a low compression small engine also seems less likely.

It's rare, but it happens, and with a weird problem like this one can't rule
out the rare just because it's uncommon. This does sound like something else
though.

The B&amp;S manual actually descriobes this problem if the afterfire solenoid is
tied to the alternator which is a 9 amp unit . Their fix is to switch teh
solenoid . Ariens decided to short out teh alternator instead
If anyone wants to see the diagram I can post it or email it
