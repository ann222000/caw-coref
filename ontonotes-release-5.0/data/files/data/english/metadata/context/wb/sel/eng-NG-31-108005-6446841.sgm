If any of you frequent Wal-Mart fabric section, I just heard on CNN that WM
has decided to discontinue fabrics. They will expand their crafting
supplies. Fabrics need someone to always be there to measure and cut, and
they can save $$ by not selling fabric. Not that their fabric was all that
great. You can see through it! AWKK   Anyway, I have often times searched
through their bolts and $1.00 bins and found something I could use. They are
also a good source for trims.

Any idea if this is specific to the US and/or Canada? I was told this a
couple of weeks ago but can not confirm what if anything it relates to
their stores in Canada.
Thanx

I don't know if it will happen in Canada. Perhaps if you go to the Wal-Mart
site.  Close to my house I have The Rag Shop and Wal-Mart - both are going
to stop selling fabric. I will now have to make a trek to Sunshine Sewing
(which has much better fabric, but sometimes you just need a little
something.)

I found this news item online and it sounds somewhat
hopeful.  I got the gist that only select stores are
considering discontinuing their fabric line, but there's
also a toll free # and an address where customers are urged
to phone/write to save the fabric department.

Our walmart home office is located in Mississauga. I have written them
for clarification. When and if I hear from them I'll let everyone know.
This will be a blow to ability to purchase more fabrics for sure.

I don't know for sure, but I have been told that it is all Wal-Mart stores
everywhere.  The nephew of one of the members of my quilt guild is the
manager of one of the local Wal-Mart's, and he said all Wal-Mart stores will
discontinue the fabric portion and parts of the craft portion in their
stores.  They want it all phased out by the end of the year.  The 3
Wal-Mart's close to me, have been doing this since June or July.

Google just changed the appearance of the ng, so I hope I am replying
correctly!  Employees of our local WalMart told me about a month ago
that ALL the fabrics would be discontinued in ALL the WalMarts.  Nobody
seemed to know when.  I talked to the fabric dept. manager last week
and she said she has been told they are closing her department but she
hasn't been given a date.  She said she just ordered 18,000 bolts(!!!)
and will keep ordering as much as she can for as long as she can.
Sadly, she also said she ordered mostly $1 a yard fabrics since that's
what sells the best.  I won't find much to buy in that bunch of bolts.
The really, really sad part is that there will be no place left in my
little town to grab a spool of thread, a rotary blade or a box of pins.
I'll miss that MUCH more than the fabrics- but then I have a mighty
stash!

Dang, Jacqueline, you make me feel so RICH!  Here in Tucson we have two (no,
make that three) fabulous quilt stores and several good ones.  Also JoAnne's
and Hancock fabric stores.  I haven't bought fabric from Wal-Mart in ages,
though I go there a couple of times a month.  We also have a
Fabric-By-The-Pound store on the east side of town, but I haven't been there
yet.  Every time I plan a S.E.X. excursion, I fail to allow enough time to
go through a place like that.  They are fun (speaking from my days of sewing
clothing and going to the Munsingwear outlet in Minneapolis) but I need to
set aside a couple of hours just for that one store as it is sometimes hard
to search through the double-knits and upholstery fabrics for the quilter's
cottons I really want.

However, in spite of all that--my DS, who lives in a small town in Idaho,
sends me wonderful fabric every year for Christmas and my birthday and
Mother's Day.  He buys from a local quilt shop and from a local dyer's group
that sells scraps (up to a half-yard) of lovely hand-dyed batiks.  So, you
see, small towns can be great sources.  We just need to get more folks in
your area interested in fabric!

I read on another group that I am in that calls to the 800 number ARE
effective.  Walmart officials are reconsidering their decision in some
areas.  The manager at the closest Walmart has argued the decision because
they are the only store in our county that carries fabric.  The closest
quilt shops are a minimum of 40 miles from them.
I do know that they have said they will not do away with the fabric
departments in the Ohio Amish communities ( and they are usually the ones
with the biggest and best quilt stores!!).

I had noticed our Wal Mart never gets any new fabric in anymore. Just
the same old stuff. I be that's why. I'm kind of glad, in a way; we
have two small LQS's whose prices are very reasonable considering the
quality of their fabric. I hope this decision makes their stores really
bloom. I'm tired of seeing our local hardware stores, florists,
groceries, etc. go out of business because of Wal Mart.

<POSTDATE> 2007-01-24T03:57:00 </POSTDATE>
I don't post very often and I am new to this group as of the first of
the year.  I was told about this early fall.  Wallmart made $720
million dollars in profit from their fabric alone last year.  Their
mark up is small compared to other fabric retailers.  That is a lot of
yardage and will leave a very big hole in the availability of fabric
for sewers.  When Sam Walton opened his first store, he was not getting
the traffic he needed to make a go at it.  His wife, Helen,  made all
her children's clothes and had to drive to another town to buy fabric
that she could afford.  They only had one car and this was a problem
when she needed sewing supplies.  She tried to get him to add fabrics
and notions to his store because she said it would bring in the ladies.
He resisted because he didn't want to have to worry about scheduling
employees to man the cutting table and all the space the bolts would
take up.  She kept making the argument that the ladies would come in
often to look and while they were there they would remember that they
needed other things.  He finally gave in and order notions and fabric.
He spent one Sunday { In those days they had Blue Laws that did not
allow stores to be open on  Sundays}  building the counters and getting
the cutting table set up.  He didn't think that this was really going
to bring many customers in without advertising so he would have a
chance on Monday to finish putting out the fabric and notions stock.
But it didn't take long for the word to spread on Monday that he had a
fabric department.  He spent the day trying to get the fabric and
notions displayed between cutting fabric.  He had not hired anyone
extra yet.  By the end of the week the sales doubled and the rest is
history.  I read this in a book about Sam Walton 15 years ago.  What
ever Helen wanted for the fabric department Sam bought.  After Walmart
became a large company, the accountants and other upper management
wanted to get rid of fabric because of the lower profit per square
footage of  space and the higher employee over head compared to what
the other departments made.  He would not do it because he understood
that was his part of his customer base.   He was satisfied with the
company's profit.  I bet Helen and Sam are rolling over in their
graves.

Customers have been complaining since this first leaked out last
summer.  I don't know if it has made much impacted on the CEO and his
team,  CEO background is in groceries.  He used to be CEO of Kash n
Karry Foods in Florida. They ended up in bankruptcy and reorganized and
sold to Sweet Bay a several years ago.  I hope that Walmart has taken
notice of the mistake that Federated Department Stores made last year.
They changed over 550 regional departments stores ( Marshal Fields,
Mays Co. and Kaufman's) to Macy's trying to make themselves a national
brand store.  People complained bitterly after the announcement and in
some places picketed.  I think this why Walmart has been so closed
mouth about their plans. With all the complaining Federated Dept. went
through with the change over any ways.  Changed all the stores over in
October and the bottom fell out of those stores sales in November.
They lost between 10 to 20% of their customer base in each of the
stores that was changed over to Macy's.  Walmart tried this once before
as a pilot program in 60 stores with prefolded package fabric in 2001
and scrapped it because of the customer complaints and sales fell off
in those 60 stores.  The Walmart stores here in South West Florida is
already winding down for the change over and face lift in April.  The
store that I shop at has already felt the drop in sales.  The fabric
department was told in November that the store would stop selling
fabric in April.

I used to buy everything there but I don't now because the fabric
stores are in the other direction and I shop at the grocery stores in
the same strip malls that the fabric stores are located. I don't go to
Walmart just to go.  When I shop I like to look at fabric even when I
can't buy.  I always fabric shop first then do the other shopping.  I
only go in Walmart now to buy the fabric that is being marked down.
They are underestimating how important the fabric department is to
Walmart's customers and how much it will effect their bottom line.  Why
go to Walmart for just groceries and stand in a long line when I can go
to a traditional grocery store and save time and have someone offer to
take the groceries to the car for you.

It make me wonder how much this will effect quilting trends because it
make fabric harder to buy in small communities and rural areas that
only have Walmart.  Not everyone is on the Internet.  Walmart has a low
income customer base so many shop there for fabric because that is what
they can afford.    I think we will see a lot of scrap quilting and
depression era patterns being featured in quilt magazines using a lot
of muslin. If I saw something pretty in  Walmart fabric dept.,  I would
buy enough of it to back a queen size quilt.  Now I am glad I did that
because I have a nice big stash of fabric that will keep me going for
awhile before I have to start using plain muslin.  Also this will have
an effect on charity projects that guilds and cottage groups work on.
I know I won't be making as much because of the increase in the cost of
fabric.

I have finished two sets of star blocks this week for the exchange and
will post pictures of them as soon as I figure out how to use web
shots.  Don't laugh it took me a couple of weeks to work out the bugs
in google to be able to post here.

Hi Christina
Where in OK are you? I'm in Blanchard, OK. There ia a Joann's in OKC. I
think it's just off of Northwest Expressway if I remember correctly. There
might be a Joann's closer to you. Just check their website for the Joann's
nearest to you. There are other fabric stores like Hancock's. They are
usually more expensive than Joann's, but definitely a LOT cheaper than a
trip to Texas ;-) And don't forget about Hobby Lobby.

supplies. Fabrics need someone to always be there to measure and cut, and
they can save $$ by not selling fabric. Not that their fabric was all that
great. You can see through it! AWKK   Anyway, I have often times searched
through their bolts and $1.00 bins and found something I could use. They are
also a good source for trims.

Ok.. I live in Los Angeles County in Southern California where there is a Walmart, JoAnn, Hancock, and LQS on every corner.  I Just called 5 local Walmarts and they are all closing their Fabric Depts. and said ALL STORES ARE.   Even though I live in the land of FABRIC on every corner, I will be sad to see it go. :(

Some of you may think this is funny, ROFL as you say. It is not so funny in
the rural areas.Where I live, there is a Walmart about ten miles away, and
it is at least 30 miles to the nearest fabric store. Most of the fabric I
buy at Walmart is the crafty type items, because that is the bulk of their
stock. I do enjoy having that available, and having a nearby source for
muslin and notions. I often go to Walmart just for that reason. Would not
want to drive thirty miles to pick up thread or a zipper to complete a
project. I hope they keep the fabric depts. open.

My understanding is that they will still carry everything EXCEPT actual bolts of fabric.  It takes up too much room.  They still carry notions and such.  and as far as funny, I think it's HILARIOUS that we are all searching and calling and in such an uproar over it INCLUDING me. :)   I bought Disney princess fabric at my local Walmart three days ago that I CANNOT find in stock anywhere else.  It's the same fabric.  It's only cheaper then If i'd bought it at JoAnn or Hancocks.   I am very disappointed they are doing away with it.

Hi Karen,
I am from South/Central/Eastern, OK, Your Joann's in OKC is 102 miles from
me, Sherman, TX is closer to me then OKC.
Then comes in Denton, TX at  89 Miles, behind that is Frisco, TX and Plano,
even Lewisville comes in before Oklahoma City. and that is just for Joanns.

Now lets try Hancocks, at 74 miles we find Shawnee, then Norman, and again
Denton, TX comes in just at 90 miles,  Plano at 93 miles.

Now Hobby Lobby comes in at Ardmore, Ok and at Sherman, Tx.

Still a drive down to Sherman,Tx is clearly cheaper then OKC. (grin)
Just like Jacqeline, it is hard to get people to understand when you live in
a rural area, that you really don't have other places to shop other then
Walmart.
I am not as far to Walmart as Jacqeline is, our closet Walmart is in Atoka,
Then would come Durant, Ada and down to Denison &amp; Sherman, TX.
DR's are also in short supply here, and they will have you going in every
direction.
as far as online shopping goes, I cannot even start to shop online for
fabrics, the cost for my budget is just too high.

for now I will hold my breath and wait and see what happens in my area.

&gt; Where in OK are you? I'm in Blanchard, OK. There ia a Joann's in OKC. I
&gt; think it's just off of Northwest Expressway if I remember correctly. There

&gt; nearest to you. There are other fabric stores like Hancock's. They are
&gt; usually more expensive than Joann's, but definitely a LOT cheaper than a

If this is true for our Canadian stores as well I am not going to be
increasing my stash except for the occasional finds in the thrift stores. I
cannot afford much of the "good" stuff very often. Real good fabric is
treasured by me since the limited budget is what I work with. The only place
in my small town to buy ANY fabric new is Wal-Mart and if that's gone.......
it is at least a 2 hour drive to the next closest place that sells fabric.

I am not one of those that can shop online for fabric either. I don't have a
CC. It is something I don't own and don't want to. If I can't pay cash or
use my debit card right out of my account, I don't buy. It has to be that
way on a limited budget. I have to know where I stand and how much I have
and getting a CC is just far too much temptation.

Thank goodness I believe in recycling and reusing and thriftiness. But it is
still nice to be able to hit the local WM and get something new once in a
while....... was that is.

I don't have a credit card either, but I e-mailed and asked if they would
accept a postal money order, they said yes, and I ordered.  They told me the
total amount including postage, I bought the money order and sent it, and my

Your debit card will have either a Visa or MasterCard symbol on it. You can

Debit cards in Canada are different or at least at my bank they are. It is a
bank card and only able to be used as such.  I have seen debit cards that
have the visa or mc symbols but not ours.

Actually, we just call them bank cards here not debit cards. I worked in 2
different banks in the past 6 years and the cards are just for that bank and
your own account.

On the up side of it all.......... I cant buy more so I can save money!!!!
And I can use up my stash!!! I just finished going through my stash and all
my sewing stuff while relocating my sewing room and .......well..........

Be really careful, though!  I once used my debit card as a credit card
online (I have the MasterCard symbol on mine). Someone got ahold of the
number and luckily, I discovered it quickly. I stayed up all night,
nervously watching charges rack up for plane tickets to and from Turkey
and India, electronics and computer equipment, and sex phone lines via
my online account information.

MY bank wasn't nearly as nice as some.  I was waiting at the door when
they opened the next morning.  They told me they had to prove I didn't
make the charges. How was I making charges from Turkey and India if I
was OBVIOUSLY in Missouri within four hours of the charge, sitting in
their bank? The account manager was VERY rude, not even sympathizing
with me, knowing that I had just watched my entire summer's earnings
(over seven thousand dollars at the time) disappear overnight.

We demanded to withdraw every cent that was still left in the account,
went directly to the police, reported the stolen credit card (well,
debit card) number, and went to a new bank.  We did eventually get all
of the money back (took several weeks), but I will never, ever, use
that bank again.

Just a word of warning about using a debit card as a credit card.
YMMV.

rather nice quilting on them, though.   I didn't get MY quilt done over
the holiday break because I got the flu.  Phooey.  I'm hoping this
semester is easier (seems like it so far), and that I'll be able to
quilt some more again soon!

Sadly, I don't think they are that smart.

I feel for those who have no local alternative for fabric because Walmart
drove their competitors out of business.

Thank God for the Internet, say I!

&gt;&gt;areas.  The manager at the closest Walmart has argued the decision because
&gt;&gt;they are the only store in our county that carries fabric.  The closest
&gt;&gt;quilt shops are a minimum of 40 miles from them.
&gt;&gt; I do know that they have said they will not do away with the fabric

Oops, for some reason I thought you were some where north of me. That's why
I thought it would be closer for you to go to OKC than Texas. It sounds like
you must be about an hour and a half away from me.
Yep, I know what you are talking about, being in a "rural" area myself :-) I
had to really search to find fabric sources around here. I realize that I
can shop online fabric sales, but it just isn't the same as actually seeing
and touching the fabric in person :-) The closest source of fabric for me is
just about 15 miles away. There are Hobby Lobby, Walmart, and one quilt shop
within about 20 miles. There are a total of three quilt shops within an hour
of me  so I'm pretty happy about that :-) The rest of the shops that I hear
about are all quite a drive away.
I think there is a fabric source (other than Walmart) in McAlester, but I
don't know the details about it.

&gt; Hi Karen,
&gt; I am from South/Central/Eastern, OK, Your Joann's in OKC is 102 miles from
&gt; me, Sherman, TX is closer to me then OKC.
&gt; Then comes in Denton, TX at  89 Miles, behind that is Frisco, TX and
&gt; Plano, even Lewisville comes in before Oklahoma City. and that is just for
&gt; Joanns.

&gt; Now lets try Hancocks, at 74 miles we find Shawnee, then Norman, and again
&gt; Denton, TX comes in just at 90 miles,  Plano at 93 miles.

&gt; Now Hobby Lobby comes in at Ardmore, Ok and at Sherman, Tx.

&gt; Still a drive down to Sherman,Tx is clearly cheaper then OKC. (grin)
&gt; Just like Jacqeline, it is hard to get people to understand when you live
&gt; in a rural area, that you really don't have other places to shop other
&gt; then Walmart.
&gt; I am not as far to Walmart as Jacqeline is, our closet Walmart is in
&gt; Atoka, Then would come Durant, Ada and down to Denison &amp; Sherman, TX.
&gt; DR's are also in short supply here, and they will have you going in every
&gt; direction.
&gt; as far as online shopping goes, I cannot even start to shop online for
&gt; fabrics, the cost for my budget is just too high.

&gt; for now I will hold my breath and wait and see what happens in my area.

I avoid using my debit card online; I think you have better legal
protection on a credit card. Good info from the U.S. Public Information
Research Group at &lt; http://www.pirg.org/consumer/banks/debit/debitcards1.htm &gt;

&gt; Be really careful, though!  I once used my debit card as a credit card
&gt; online (I have the MasterCard symbol on mine). Someone got ahold of the
&gt; number and luckily, I discovered it quickly. I stayed up all night,
&gt; nervously watching charges rack up for plane tickets to and from Turkey
&gt; and India, electronics and computer equipment, and sex phone lines via
&gt; my online account information.

&gt; MY bank wasn't nearly as nice as some.  I was waiting at the door when
&gt; they opened the next morning.  They told me they had to prove I didn't
&gt; make the charges. How was I making charges from Turkey and India if I
&gt; was OBVIOUSLY in Missouri within four hours of the charge, sitting in
&gt; their bank? The account manager was VERY rude, not even sympathizing
&gt; with me, knowing that I had just watched my entire summer's earnings
&gt; (over seven thousand dollars at the time) disappear overnight.

&gt; We demanded to withdraw every cent that was still left in the account,
&gt; went directly to the police, reported the stolen credit card (well,
&gt; debit card) number, and went to a new bank.  We did eventually get all
&gt; of the money back (took several weeks), but I will never, ever, use
&gt; that bank again.

&gt; Just a word of warning about using a debit card as a credit card.
&gt; YMMV.

Hi Christina
My friend in McAlester just emailed me some info about fabric sources in her
area.
I don't know if these are close to you, but I thought I would post them just
in case.

Karen

Hancock's and Hobby Lobby in Muskogee (both in Curt's strip mall along
Shawnee Bypass, north side of town)
Fabric Outlet in Eufaula (on the main street) - prices quite reasonable, and
a good selection of brights and blenders in particular.

Hi Karen,

I am aware of that McAlester has a Quilt store on the South side of town, Do
you know if they sell fabrics?
If so, what our there prices.
Muskogee, is far from us, at 127 miles.

I was down in Durant today buying groceries, and it looks like the Fabric
Dept. is closing down at that store. lots of fabrics missing from the
shelves, I did not see a clerk in sight, So I did not ask.

I have no Idea, but you could call them and ask :-)
Today I got the following info about some fabric sources in  Eufaula.

"The Fabric Outlet Store is on  Main Street in downtown Eufaula, and
Patchwork Plus is one mile north of Eufaula(Hwy 69) and 8 miles east on
Texana Road. Both have great
fabrics and a good selection at reasonable prices. "
