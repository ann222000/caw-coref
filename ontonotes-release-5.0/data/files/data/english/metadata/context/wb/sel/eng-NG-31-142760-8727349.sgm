Face Blind
They can see your eyes, your nose, your mouth and still not recognize
your face. Now scientists say people with prosopagnosia may help unlock
some of the deepest mysteries of the brain.
OVER THE NEXT FIVE DECADES, researchers trying to pursue these
questions had one major problem: Not many people get shrapnel shot
though their brain and survive. In other words, the pool of potential
research subjects was minuscule. Scientists did discover that a small
number of stroke victims developed prosopagnosia, but their lesions
often continued to grow, preventing reliable comparisons and, in many
cases, causing death.
Still, these patients tantalized researchers. &quot;People think of the
brain as one seamless intelligence, because that's how it feels to us
from the inside,&quot; says Nancy Kanwisher, an MIT vision researcher. &quot;But
if you look at prosopagnosia, you start to realize that the brain may
actually be a grouping of stand-alone computational machines that are
wired together.&quot;
The question is, how many machines are there and how do they work? On a
basic level, we know that there are distinct visual, auditory, memory,
and motor systems. But within each of these, are there further
specializations? For instance, within the visual cortex, is there a
specialized part of the brain devoted to faces? And, if so, are there
further specializations within that for gender, skin color, age, and
even attractiveness? It's akin to discovering the molecule, only to
realize that there may be atoms, electrons, and quarks as well.
As functional MRI came into use in the 1990s, neuroscientists rolled
people under the magnets to track blood flow to specific parts of their
brain. They learned that a small part of the visual cortex – eventually
dubbed the fusiform face area – showed increased blood activity
whenever a subject looked at a face. Researchers had discovered what
appeared to be a computational machine devoted specifically to
processing faces. Stroke or gunshot victims tended to develop
prosopagnosia if they sustained injuries to that area. But that was
about as much as this relatively crude imaging technique could reveal.
The best that scientists had been able to do was point to a particular
part of the brain and say, &quot;That's important.&quot; The face-processing
system remained a black box.
MORDECHAI HOUSMAN, A GENIAL, portly Hasidic Jew, is playing Minesweeper
on his computer at home in Brooklyn. One of his three young sons sits
next to him – though Housman isn't sure which.
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Housman finally asks with a smile.
&quot;I'm Abraham, Dad,&quot; Abraham says. The 6-year-old has heard this
question before and thinks his father is just kidding. It's like a
family joke. He doesn't understand that his dad really can't tell him
apart from other kids on the street.
The Hasidic men in the neighborhood – clad uniformly in black pants,
white shirt, black jacket, and black hat – are even harder to
distinguish. But this doesn't bother Housman. He considers it a
blessing of sorts. &quot;In my culture,&quot; he says, &quot;we de-emphasize material
things and appearances. Our focus should be on God. For me, I've been
given a head start.&quot;
Nonetheless, even the religious have to make a living. Housman found
work as a swing-shift building manager for a Hasidic college in Borough
Park, Brooklyn. Most nights, he sits behind a small window near the
entrance, answers questions, and is supposed to keep an eye on who is
coming and going.
Housman doesn't think he's ill-suited for the task; he has developed
other ways to recognize people. On a recent Monday night, he peers out
of his small window, chews on a pen while beads of sweat gather on his
forehead, and watches people walk past. He recognizes one student by
his &quot;intense, inwardly focused attitude.&quot; He greets a professor he
thinks he recognizes by the type of yarmulke he is wearing, though it
turns out to be the wrong guy. A young man darts past, but Housman
knows him. &quot;I recognize him by his soul,&quot; he says.
For Housman, as for most prosopagnosics, the Internet is changing
everything. He learned about his condition when his wife stumbled
across Choisser's Web site one night. She thought it explained a lot
about her husband, and she showed the site to him. Housman stayed up
until five in the morning reading Choisser's online memoir and
following links to other prosopagnosia Web sites. For Hasidics, Housman
says, &quot;it's considered arrogant if you make a big deal out of something
or call attention to yourself. So I didn't really talk about my
problems until I sent my first email to Brad Duchaine.&quot;
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, Duchaine has been hungrily collecting profiles
of developmental prosopagnosics though his Web site, Faceblind.org.
It's a war chest assembled to search for double dissociations. There is
the Caucasian man who upset a colleague by telling him a racial joke,
not recognizing that the listener was black. There is the woman who
waved to someone in a hotel, only to discover that it was a mirror.
There is the man who takes emotional cues from the way a person's pants
crease and bunch.
Now Duchaine is trying to prove that the condition is inherited. He
plans to spend this New Year's in Las Vegas at a reunion of a family
full of prosopagnosics. Three generations will be there. By sequencing
DNA samples from every attendee and looking at the differences between
those who do and don't have the condition, Duchaine hopes to pinpoint a
particular gene or set of genes that code for face perception. It's
unlikely to lead to a cure, but it could illuminate how the brain
builds specialized abilities.
Developmental prosopagnosia came to light in large part because of
Internet groups. Before that, most people born with the condition
assumed they were just bad with faces. It's not the type of thing most
would go to a doctor about, and even if they did, their physician
probably couldn't help, because many doctors are unaware of it. In many
ways, this is a neurological condition discovered by Yahoo.
Which makes Duchaine wonder if other groups of people with perception
problems will start to coalesce online. It would certainly help him if
new groups formed with names like Trouble Recognizing Gender or Trouble
Recognizing Myself. Among the millions of Internet users, there are
sure to be some who consider themselves normal save for one troubling
quirk. They may hold the key to a deeper understanding of the way we
assemble reality.
