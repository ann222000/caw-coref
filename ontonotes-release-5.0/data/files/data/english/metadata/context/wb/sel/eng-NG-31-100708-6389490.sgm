Seeds of Tomorrow: Why Not a 21st-Century "WPA"?

By RJ Eskow
Created Mar 10 2007 - 9:42am

The Works Progress Administration was created in the 1930's to address the
problem of mass unemployment, help with some unmet social needs, and create
a new spirit of hope and optimism. The WPA set people to work on the
nation's declining physical infrastructure, helped create new works of art,
taught the young, and generated a new sense of purpose in many people who
had been in the grips of despair.

The problems of the 21st Century are radically different, and government
can't be the entire solution. Since then we've seen what entrepreneurial
vision can accomplish, too. So why not create an agency that's designed to
address today's challenges - on a smaller, more tactical scale that's
designed to become economically self-sustaining?

Problem

First, a definition of our national/global challenge:

1.. Global warming is an existential threat. Going "green" enough to make
a difference feels overwhelming to many, if not most, Americans.
2.. Some regions of the United States are in decline. These include the
industrial belt, the farm belt, and the Gulf.
3.. The government has allowed much of America's physical infrastructure
to fall into decline [1].
These problems haven't resulted in an economic Depression our country, or
for that matter a psychological one. But if we're not in a "depression,"
then our country is certainly in a kind of "dysthymia." That's a form of
low-grade but ongoing sense of hopelessness, which a lot of Americans
struggle with as they consider the massive efforts needed to fix our many
national and global problems.

Meanwhile working Americans are excluded from the good times that have come
to the wealthy, and that needs to change.

Unemployment isn't the massive problem it was in the 1930's, but it is a
problem. We face a more focused and more complex set of issues. We're not
seeing bread lines with hundreds of workers waiting for a handout. Instead
we're seeing worry lines on the faces of many working Americans, and pockets
of intractable unemployment in different communities and groups.

Why?

1.. We have a subset of longer-term unemployed people, some of whom are
college-educated. There's a problem with chronic under-employment in some
demographic groups.
2.. Outsourcing represents a threat to an entire class of workers,
including white-collar service workers and programmers.
3.. A sense of job security is a thing of the past for many. Few Americans
have the sense of secure employment than much of the nation once enjoyed.
4.. There is a sense that innovation and entrepreneurship are not the
thriving forces they once were in our country.
5.. Conservative ideas for inner-city redevelopment like "Free Enterprise
Zones" have been creatively but economically problematic. Others have failed
to offer or publicize equally creative and less problematic counterproposals
in the same innovative spirit.
6.. Job retraining programs have not provided much benefit, and have
tended to degrade unemployed Americans by chastising them for not having the
"spunk" to "sell themselves."
(See Louis Uchitelle's fine book, The Disposable American [2], for more
information on the unemployment problem.)

Opportunity

Meanwhile, we have no shortage of great ideas. For an overwhelming
compendium of brilliant thinking about green living, there's
worldchanging.com [3] and their fine book of the same name [4]. There you'll
find ideas on everything from slowly making your house "green" - one room at
a time - to creating a complete hydrogen-based economy.

There are plenty of brilliant entrepreneurial ideas out there, too. For
'angels" who want innovative and socially conscious investment
opportunities, or companies looking for funding, there are groups like
Investors Circle [5]. (Conflict of interest note: I once submitted a funding
request to Investors Circle, although it's no longer current.)

And this week a group of the world's most innovative thinkers is meeting at
TED2007 [6] to germinate yet more new ideas, mostly - I suspect - in random
social encounters. Speakers will discuss everything from "imagined future"
to lateral thinking. (I think I'd prefer sessions on "lateral futures" and
"imagined thinking," but that's probably just me.)

Solution

Create a new government agency (call it Seeds of Tomorrow, until someone
comes up with a better name) that has four branches - the Investment Fund,
the Service Group, the International Development Fund,and the Research and
Development Fund. The agency's core mission would be to revitalize the U.S.
economy in targeted areas of need; promote new technologies and businesses
that address pressing environmental and social concerns; and promote
education and research to design and create a working United States for the
21st Century.

The agency would operate as follows:

1.. Use the Investment Fund to germinate entrepreneurial businesses that
will help address the national and global challenges outlined above, and
those that have a good chance of reinvigorating the lagging sectors of
America's economy.
2.. Act as an investor, so that profits from successful businesses can be
re-invested into the fund.
3.. Use the R&amp;D Fund to work on those ideas, however seemingly
impractical, that are approved by the a research board.
4.. Use Investment Fund profits and government grants to support the
Service Group, which will finance and manage those types of needed
activities that can't be turned into self-sustaining businesses - e.g.,
rebuilding decaying bridges, tunnels, and buildings.
5.. Use the International Development Fund to finance multinational
programs that meet the agency's core mission.
6.. Merge the Service Group with VISTA and other volunteer programs
designed to support education, inner city development, and other critical
yet chronically underfunded activities.
The best cure for dysthymia is a strong dose of hope. Personally, I'd find
reason for hope if I knew that my country was engaged in a major effort to
address some national and global problems, address the new dimensions of our
unemployment problem, and reinvigorate our economy, without breaking the
bank to do it.

It's time for a more visions of leadership that moves beyond criticism of
what's been done wrong, and generates new ideas and new initiatives on a
national - even global - scale.

Feedback

There's more that I could say, but for now I'd like to hear from others.
Obviously this is just a top-level sketch of the problems and one aspect of
the potential solution.

If you have any thoughts, let's hear them.
