Transcript of Guy Fawkes trial

XIX. The Trials of Robert Winter, Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes,
John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates,
and Sir Everard Digby, at Westminster for High-Treason, being
Conspirators in the Gunpowder-Plot. 27 Jan. 1605. 3 Jac. l.

The C O M M I S S I O N E R S were,
The Earl of Nottingham.
The Earl of Salisbury.
The Earl of Suffolk.
The Lord Chief Justice of England, Sir John Popham.
The Earl of Worcester.
The Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, Thomas
Fleming.
The Earl of Devonshire.
Sir Peter Warburton, Knight, one of the Justices of
the Common-Pleas.
The Earl of Northampton.

The Effect of the Indictment.

Presently after whose Death was Christopher Wright, another Messenger
sent over into Spain by Garnet, (who likewise did write by him to
Creswell, for the furtherance of the Negotiation) Catesby and Tresham,
in the name and behalf of all the Romish Catholicks in England; as well
to carry News of her Majesty's Death, as also to continue the aforesaid
Negotiation for an Invasion and Pensions, which by Tho. Winter had
before been dealt in. And in the Spanish Court, about two Months after
his arrival there, doth Christopher Wright meet with Guy Fawkes; who
upon the 22d of June was employed out of Flanders from Brussels by Sir
William Stanley, Hugh Owen, (whose Finger hath been in every Treason
which hath been of late Years detected) and Baldwyn the Legier Jesuit in
Flanders; from whom likewise the said Fawkes carried Letters to Creswell
in Spain, for the countenancing and furtherance of his Affairs.

Now the End of Fawkes's imployment was, to give Advertisement to the
King of Spain, how the King of England was like to proceed rigorously
with the Catholicks, and to run the same course which the late Queen
did; and withal to intreat that it would please him to send an Army into
England to Milford-haven, where the Romish Catholicks would be ready to
assist him; and then the Forces that should be transported in Spinola's
Gallies, should be landed where they could most conveniently. And these
their several Messages did Christopher Wright and Guy Fawkes in the end
intimate and propound to the King of Spain. But the King as then very
honourably answered them both, that he would not in any wise further
listen to any such Motion, as having before dispatched an Embassy into
England, to treat concerning Peace. Therefore this Course by foreign
Forces failing, they fell to the Powder-Plot, Catesby and Tresham being
in at all; in the Treason of the Earl of Essex, in the Treason of Watson
and Clarke Seminary Priests, and also in this of the Jesuits; such a
greedy Appetite had they to practise against the State.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We must blow up the King and his Parliament...

In 1604 four men, Robert Catesby, Thomas Winter, John Winter,and John
Wright, all Catholics who had been personally affected by religious
persecution and who were all related either by birth or marriage, met at
the request of Robert Catesby at his house in Lambeth (across the river
from Parliament) to discuss possible solutions to the current
persecution which James I had re-imposed. James had suggested that
should he become king he would be tolerant of Catholics. The
disappointment of this reversal served as the last straw for men who had
personally felt the weight of religious intolerance. Blowing up the king
and Parliament was first discussed. It is significant that not only was
the king to be killed but that to change the Parliament, the institution
must now be attacked. Thomas Winter proposed a mission to the King
Philip of Spain, who was in the process of negotiating peace with
England from a position of considerable weakness. Winter also was to
locate Guy Fawkes, known for his skills as a miner. The Spanish refused
to help. They needed the peace agreement as war with England had
depleted their resources.

The plot moves slowly first due to the dissolution of Parliament, then
because of hope that the Spanish would help. The Winniard house near
Parliament was rented by Thomas Percy. Robert Keyes then joined the
plot, assigned to watch over the house at Lambeth. They soon discovered
that the Winniard house was being used by a delegation of Scottish peers
so a further delay was encountered, overcome only on December 11.
Materials were moved across the river from Robert Catesby's house in
Lambeth under cover of darkness. The acquisition of gunpowder and
supplies is a point of interest in Fawkesian studies as the substance
was produced and tightly controlled by the state.

The question of the royal succession was discussed. The direct
successor was to James I was Prince Henry, who would be in Parliament
and be destroyed with James I. Also the Duke of York, later Charles I,
who was only five years old at the time, might also go to Parliament and
be killed. Thomas Percy would go to be with Charles and carry him off at
the time of the explosion. If this would not work, they would go for
Princess Elizabeth James's eldest daughter , next in line to the throne
A hunting party would pick her up at the estate where she was staying.
Friendly peers were to be warned not to attend parliament.

The tunnel was at the wall of Parliament on Christmas eve. Trouble was
the wall was 9 feet thick and they also needed to hollow out a room for
the gunpowder. Time was running out as February 7 was the deadline, the
date of the Parliament meeting. Miraculously, the session of Parliament
was postponed until September 29, 1605. The wall was penetrated at a
rate of a foot a week , this by men who, besides Guy Fawkes, were not
accustomed to manual labor. Because of this slow progress, Christopher
Wright, brother of John, joins the plot as an extra pair of hands. In
February, thirty six hundred weight barrels of powder were conveyed
across the river, each carried by two men using a brewers sling. This
nearly two tons of powder would certainly make a dent in Parliment. In
March, the excavators of the tunnel hear a strange sound: men removing
barrels from a cellar. It turned out that this cellar was located right
under parliament. Thomas Percy rents the cellar and gunpowder is moved
there.

Robert Catesby then runs out of money.Catesby becomes involved with
the English effort to recruit a English Catholic force to fight with
Archduke Albert in the Netherlands.Catesby is able to visit Catholic
households without penalty. Catesby recruits for financial assistance
Robert Winter and John Grant.Catesby servant, Thomas Bates, is recruited
as a loyal follower, as the comings and goings of his master were
beginning to alarm him. Catesby also goes in late March to visit Father
Garnet and talks with him about his conscience. &quot;Is it right to justify
the killing of innocent-non-combatants?&quot; Garnet replies that killing of
innocents is permitted if it can not be avoided.

Ambrose Rookwood was admitted to the plot at the end of March, as
Rookwood had one of the finest stables in all of England. Plenty of
horses would be needed for a hasty escape.

Father Garnet sets out to warn Catesby not to become involved in
mischief Catesby agrees to ask the Pope directly what should be done
about the plight of the English Catholics before the plan is completed.
In July Catesby reveals the plot to Tesimond in the confessional, who in
turn reveals it with Catesby's permission to Garnet. Thus two priests
each knew of the others obligations to the confessional, sub sigillo.
Each would know if the other had broken the vow, a clever gambit by
Catesby. Garnet requests special powers from the Pope to help stay any
general plot which he might suspect. The Pope responded with a request
for further details, details which Garnet could not provide due to the
seal of the confessional. Catesby eventually broke the seal the day
after the plot was discovered allowing Father Garnet to testify. By
which time, Catesby was dead.

In the summer of 1605 the plotters either went to the countryside or
turned to fund-raising. A search for Jesuits in the Midlands came close
but suspiciously did not net any. Catesby enlists Edward Digby with a
colorful oath on the cross and references to a book by Father Martin
Delrius: Disquisitiones Magiacae. This book discusses the relationship
of the seal of the confessional to blowing up the sovereign. It
parallels the plot and is certainly where Catesby arrived at his plan.
Digby donates 1,500 pounds to the plot and agrees to lead the rising in
the Midlands. He would lead a hunting party on Dunsmore Heath then with
word of the explosion he would swoop down on Combe abbey and take
Princess Elizabeth to be proclaimed queen. Unless Percy could make off
with the prince. Digby was a hunter and would not arouse suspicion.

Father Garnet had to choose which to contact concerning the plot: Rome
or the Government. He chose Rome because there was hope for the
relaxation of the Penal Laws in the next session of Parliament. This
hope would fade had a plot been uncovered.

In Fall 1605 Francis Tresham was recruited. He donates 2000 pounds and
is the last conspirator enlisted. Much is made that his admission
increased the number of conspirators to 13.

Parliament is delayed in opening from October 3 to November 5.

Catesby meets in late October with an important admiral and it seems was
being watched by Cecil's men. One meeting was attended by Ben Johnson,
writer turned spy.

Guy Fawkes returns from Yorkshire to the Bell Inn at Daventry on
October 14.

The conspirators meet on October 15 and discuss problems with Catholics
who sitting in Parliament might be killed: Thomas Howard, Earl of
Arundel; Lord Mountague; Lord Mordaunt and the relatives of Tresham,
Mounteagle and Stourton. These men were to be warned if possible.
Mordaunt was believed not to attend and the others were either to be
subtly warned or prevented from attending.Tresham gets cold feet and
asks for postponement. But the first day was essential as the king would
have to be present only on that day.

On October 25, Thomas Winter learns via Mounteagle that Prince Henry
would not be attending Parliament. Arrangements were made to surprise
the prince, aged 12, and leave alone Duke Charles.

At the same time Fawkes notes that he had made a visit to the cellar
and that by consulting secret marks knew that nothing had been
disturbed. Rookwood stations horses in London and along route to
Midlands to carry the news to Digby at Dunchurch on Dunsmore Heath.
Tresham would be at White Webs with the badly needed money. Robert
Winter on October 24 arranges for ready money, fearing he may have to
leave the country. Cecil writes on the same day, &quot;Let His Majesty know
that I dare boldly say no shower nor storm shall mar our harvest except
it should come from the middle region.&quot;

Two days later an anonymous writer, some suspect Tresham, informs Lord
Mounteagle of the plot. Mounteagle was at his mansion in Hoxton when he
received the letter. Mounteagle rides right off to London with the
letter, although the message was far from exact or clear. A conference
was called to discuss the letter and it was agreed to wait and watch.
Thomas Winter said he learned of the delivery of the letter the next day
on the 27th. The next morning he informed Fawkes and Catesby at White
Webs believes that the letter was too vague and the government would be
slow to act.

Precautions were to be taken and Fawkes was to check the powder. He goes
to do this on the 30th. Tresham avoids meeting the others as he was to
hand over funds and is suspect as a relative of Mounteagle. Fawkes
returns with the news that his marks were intact and the powder not
discovered.

Thomas Winter goes to London to check things out on the 31st. No
indication of serious consideration of the note. Winter tells Tresham to
meet Catesby

The King also returns to London on the 31st and Cecil gives him a day
to settle in before mentioning the letter.

Tresham meets with Catesby on November 1. Tresham convinces the others
of his abandonment of the plot.

The king orders a search of the Parliament building to be conducted on
the day before Parliament was to meet on Nov. 4.

Garnet says an illegal mass on November 1. This is one of the charges
which convicted him. In the mass for the day is the Vesper Hymn with the
lines: &quot;From the land of believers take away all unbelievers that all
beneath our One Shepherd's sway within one fold may come again&quot;. This
was taken by the government, although an ancient text, as evidence
Garnet had used these lines in his discourse to give one last warning to
the conspirators.Catesby was to have been at the Mass but did not turn
up.Garnet's last words of the mass urged the success of the Catholic
cause in the beginning of the first parliament. The government
interpreted them as wishing for the success of the plot.

Fawkes is sent to advise Percy of events on Friday November 1. Percy
and Fawkes return to London on November 2. On the evening of November 2,
the conspirators meet to consider the plot and agree to move ahead.
Percy diverted the rent money he was to collected, over 3,000 pounds, to
the uprising. Percy also researches the atmosphere at the court.

On Monday, November 4, Thomas Howard, Lord Chamberlain, with Lord
Mounteagle, searching Parliament, discover the cellar and stored wood
and coal. By asking Whyneard, the keeper of the wardrobe, they find that
Thomas Percy had rented the house and cellar. In the corner at the time
of the search, &quot;Whereupon, the Lord Chamberlain, casting his eye aside,
perceived a fellow standing in a corner there calling himself the said
Percy's man, and keeper of the house for him, but indeed was Guido (Guy)
Fawkes, the owner of that hand which should have acted that monsterous
tragedy.&quot; Fawkes was not seized on this afternoon inspection.

On November 4, Sir Everard Digby, unaware of difficulties in London,
rides out for the hunting party on the 5th. That night, Fawkes was on
guard at ten o' clock when Robert Keyes brings him the Watch given by to
him by Percy. The watch was probably a symbolic gesture as fuses would
have been timed in advance and the king would not be on a strict
timetable. Fawkes also was probably not preparing to leave by ship but
perhaps to go somewhere to wait out the events ( point of contention to
Fawkensian scholars.)

Catesby heads toward Dunchurch to aid in the rising on Monday
afternoon. John Wright meets with Thomas Winter, Robert Keyes and Thomas
Percy. Keyes receives the watch and John Wright goes to meet Catesby
while Percy stays the night with preparations to leave in the morning.
Christopher Wright purchases three beaver hats and picks up an engraved
sword, both symbols in the confidence of their success. The engraving on
the sword : &quot;The Passion of Christ&quot; and &quot;another&quot;.

At about Midnight, Fawkes heard footsteps on the way to him on watch in
the cellar. Sir Thomas Knyvet, a justice of the peace, and a small
number of men found Fawkes in the rooms dressed to ride at such a late
time of the evening . A search was made of the room and the powder found
under coal and wood. Fawkes was searched and found to have three matches
Fawkes was bound and guarded and Sir Thomas went to the palace to advise
the Lord Chamberlain and Cecil who informed the king at about four in
the morning. Fawkes did not talk but gave only the name of John Johnson,
servant to Thomas Percy

King James I asked: &quot;Why would you have fired the powder?&quot;
Fawkes replied:

&quot;To blow the Scottish beggars back to their native mountains!&quot;

Now that the plot has been discovered...

In the last part of our tale, we find Guy Fawkes, the brave Yorkshire
man and experienced miner and sapper soldier, being questioned by the
King, having been interrupted in his work of blowing up Parliament. The
others are rushing north to the Midlands and preparing to capture
members of the royal family or rescue Catholic friends and relatives
from the explosion.

Cecil, in his writings about Fawkes under questioning, &quot;(He was) no
more dismayed, nay,scarce any more troubled, than if he were taken for a
poor robbery on the highway.&quot;

One must imagine the meeting of James the king with Fawkes and the
remembrance of his own father's assassination by gunpowder at Kirk o'
Field.

Christopher Wright was wandering about the Strand before five in the
morning of November 5. Wright heard the commotion and that the matter
was discovered . He went and found Thomas Winter at the Duck and Drake.

John Lepton Groom of the Privy Chamber was already on horseback riding
in search of Percy. But he was riding north while Percy slept at the Red
Lion.

Wright wakes Percy muttering &quot;I am undone.&quot; He climbs onto his horse.
Percy and Wright ride out of London toward Dunchurch and the planned
rising.

Meanwhile, Rookwood and Keyes were warned as they stayed
at Mrs. Moores house near Temple Bar. The two rode on together.

Winter himself goes to the gates of Parliament and can not pass.
He was informed that the plot has been discovered.
Satisfied that all was known, he too rode into the country.

On the road north the conspirators meet up with one another.
Catesby's horse throws a shoe and needs to have a new one.
Others are recognized through their servants.

They all met at Brickhill and rode on together. Cloakes were thrown into
the hedge to improve speed. Those in the countryside already
had formed the hunting party and were waiting for word.

On six o'clock on this foul November evening, the conspirators paused at
the estate of Ashby St. Ledgers. A servant was sent to the house with
the news for Robert Winter from the assembled group waiting outside
in the rain.

Winter joins the party on the way to the Inn at Dunchurch on Dunsmore
Heath. Digby and the hunting party waited following dinner with mulled
ale when the six wet and bedraggled men arrived. Catesby tells Digby a
lie: that James and Cecil had been killed and the revolt must go on.
The Littletons will raise a thousand men.

Digby tells those in his party who had not yet learned of the true
reason for the hunt. He was met by disgust from his own uncle, who
stated that treason and murder of the king would set the Catholic cause
back forever. Others also doubted and deserted the plot. The band of
conspirators left Dunchurch with only about 50 horse, a straggling
group. The servants, merrymaking just before in the kitchen, were
shocked that their masters were perpetrating treason. As the servants
rode on with their masters, doubt entered their minds and
they slipped away from them into the darkness.

Meanwhile, in London, a mob was at the gates of the residence of the
Spanish Ambassador. Throughout the night and into the next day, the
citizens were kept under arms. There were concerned about the newly
negotiated peace with Spain and the ambassador was given special
protection.

A proclamation for the arrest of Thomas Percy from the king
was posted. Lepton, the Privy Chamber man,
continues his search but ends up in Scotland.

Fawkes was in the tower undergoing the first of six examinations.
Not tortured yet but it was to come. He revealed nothing.

A priest, Father John Roberts, was found at Percy's house. London was
busy looking in several places for Percy but had not yet widening the
search to locate other conspirators.

At midnight the conspirators; Digby, Catesby, Robert Winter Rookwood and
the Wrights; were on their way to Warwick. New horses were needed. At
Warwick Castle, a break in to steal horses was contemplated. Robert
Winter expresses doubt. Catesby responds &quot;What! Hast thou any hope,
Robert? I assure thee there is none that knoweth of this action but
shall perish.&quot; They were in trouble enough.
Why not add horse stealing to the list?

Winter remains but Rookwood , with a fresh horse, having been
pre-positioned, rides to warn John Grant. Leaving servants and pack
horses outside the city gates, Catesby and the others go to the stables
of Mr. Benock adjoining the castle. Ten horses were taken before alarm
was given. But two servants were captured and they were identified. From
the servants Conyers and Fowes the Sheriff of Warwickshire learned that
the horses were laden with trunks of arms and ammunition. Cecil is
informed by Benock. The guardians of the Princess Elizabeth
at Combe Abbey were alerted.

Catesby and the others catch up with Rookwood at Norbrook, the home of
John Grant . Grant had opened the secret cache of arms he had stored for
this day. The weapons were laid out on long tables in the hall.

Digby writes to Father Garnet to convey to him the news. Bates was sent
with the letter to Garnet. Lady Digby received Bates after Mass in the
secret chapel above the gate house at Coughton Court, a building riddled
with secret priests rooms. The letter asked Garnet to take part and help
with the rising in Wales. It was pointed out that &quot;if he refused to
accompany them but let them now perish out of any scruples and to free
himself and his fellow Jesuits from blame, he too would soon perish,
as would all Catholics.&quot;

Tesimond was with Garnet. They both realized that, having the knowledge
from the confessional, they were both undone. Garnet does not rush to
their aid. He asks that they surrender. Tesimond however,
left with Bates

Lady Mary Digby learned for the first time that her husband's was
not an ordinary hunting party and broke down to be comforted
by Garnet Lady Digby sends horses to aid her husband

As the conspirators move toward Huddington. Digby's own uncle is
assisting with the rounding up of prisoners. The Sherif of Warwickshire
estimates the size of the band to be about one hundred, with a bit of
exaggeration. Robert Winter refuses Catesby' s request
to ask John Talbot for the promised thousand men.

Bates, Father Tesimond and Thomas Winter join the band.
Tresham stayed in London.

When the band reached Hindlip Manor, near Huddington, it found no help
from Thomas Abingdon, owner of the manor. After staying the night there,
Robert Winter's priest, Father Nicholas Hart, hears the confession of
the conspirators and distributed communion.
This was Thursday the 7th of November .

The band rode off toward Wales and Lancashire following Tesimond They
were a band of less than forty looking for reinforcements. The next stop
was Hewell Grange, which they plundered for arms and ammunition. The
country folk they met along the way in response to Catesby's request
replied, &quot;We are for King James as well as for God and country.&quot;

After a long journey mired in rainy November's cold and mud and without
recruits, the band ended up at Holbeach House. They had been trailed by
Sheriff Walsh High Sheriff of Worcestershire.
They arrived at ten that night.

Meanwhile, Fawkes was facing more questions. The King requests that &quot;the
gentler tortours are to be first used unto him and by degrees towards
the uttermost and so God speede youre goode worke&quot; of the interrogator,
William Wade, Lieutenant of the Tower. Probably after being suspended by
his thumbs, Fawkes began to crack but only just revealed his oath not to
tell. More torture would come on the 7th. But still no information other
than his true name was revealed.

At Holbeach House, the conspirators had two suicidal choices. They could
run and be immediately captured, or fight it out. Sheriff Walsh had
raised a significant posse of several hundred.

Grasping at straws, Thomas Winter tried other friends but none come.
Preparations to defend the house get under way.

Damp gunpowder wet from the ride is spread out in the great hall to dry,
but a little close to the fire. The powder was spread on a tray near
another great bag of powder. A spark from the coal fire ignited the
powder and a big bag of powder is not ignited but is blown through the
roof to land in the courtyard. JohnGrant had his eyes burnt out and face
disfigured. Catesby and Rookwood were injured.

Winter and Littleton were met with this news on their way back. Winter
thought Catesby to be dead and went on to bury the body of his friend.
Thomas Winter was surprised finds Catesby alive when he returns to the
house. All are in prayer. &quot;We mean here to die,&quot; they said.

Christopher Wright tosses money out a window to Bates who is to take it
to his wife. Robert Winter, shaken, has a wild dream of &quot;steeples awry
,and within those churches strange and unknown faces.&quot; He leaves with
Littleton, these two being the last to be captured. John Winter left and
was captured the next day. To seek help, Digby left, only to be
surrounded and captured in a quarry nearby.

It was now the 8th of November a Friday. Around noon, the house was
stormed. Thomas Winter was hit and lost the use of one arm. Next the
elder Wright was shot dead, then the younger Wright and then Rookwood.
Percy was shot together with Catesby with one bullet and Winter beaten
and captured. Accounts vary but there was considerable chaos after the
shoot out, with locals tearing off the clothing of the victims and
arguments over horses. The event has evoked significant drama: &quot;Mr
Catesby being fallen onto the ground as they say, went upon his knees
into the house and there got a picture off our Blessed Lady in his arms
and so embracing and kissing the same he died.&quot; Catesby also is said to
dramatically have taken a gold cross from his neck and raised it up to
swear that it all was for the honor of the cross.

But then the marksmen shot both men dead with the same bullet. There is
also significant doubt that all who eventually died as a result of the
incident died as a result of wounds received during the struggle itself.

At the same time as the shoot out Fawkes was being described as &quot;most
stubborn and perverse humor as dogged as if he were possessed.&quot;. After
exposure though to Wade's less gentler toys, perhaps the rack. Fawkes
cracked on November the 8th in the torture chamber deep under the tower.
With the exception of Percy he still gave no names but revealed only the
events of the plot.

On the 9th names were revealed including those of the Jesuits. Again on
the 10th after more torture he finally provided all the information the
state required. It was not until the 16th that he could be examined
again due to injuries inflicted.

On November 16, the Sheriff of Staffordshire is ordered to exhume the
bodies of Catesby, Percy, the two Wrights and the others, and that the
bodies be bowelled and quartered. These pieces were to be set up in
principal towns where they most led their lives. The heads of Percy and
Catesby were to be sent up to London. At the cost of 23s 6d for
ironwork, the heads of Catesby and Percy were exhibited on the ramparts
of Parliament House.

Keyes was captured on November 9. Bates never carried out
his mission and was captured on November 12.

The plot provided the government with reason to arrest many. Anne Vaux
remained free until the government had caught up with Father Garnet.
Tresham was also not arrested until the 12th, although his connection
with the plot was well known from the start and he had lived openly in
London.

Winter and Lyttleton remained at large until Thursday, January 9, 1606,
when, after hiding in the hay in a barn, they were discovered and
captured after a chase.

On the 27th of January 1606, the first prisoners were hanged at
Worcester jail, John Perckes and Thomas Burford. Others were to follow.
None survived.

We shall soon talk of further interrogations and
executions followed by a most amazing miracle.
----------------------------------------------------------
Hanged, Drawn and Quartered.....
Only eight of the original Plot survived.
On a cold Monday, January 27, 1606, all
the prisoners were brought from the Tower of London through Traitors
Gate and onto a barge to go up-river to Westminster. John Winter was
only 19, hardly a part of the plot at all, but he would be tried with
his two other brothers, Thomas and Robert. The only account of the trial
is the &quot;True and Perfect&quot;&quot;Kings Book&quot;, which is not either.

Once at Westminster the men sat for a while in the Star Chamber.
They told their rosaries while the mocking public looked on.

There was no defense-no verbal examination. They had already been
condemned several days before. The Archbishop of Canterbury had summoned
a committee to discuss the manner of their execution. After a half hour
the prisoners were led from the Star Chamber into Westminster Hall which
was packed with onlookers. The Queen, Prince, and James were there
incognito.
The prisoners were brought to a high scaffold so that they could be
seen and faced their jury. Not a jury of their piers but a special
commission; Robert Cecil, Sir John
Popham, Charles Howard, Thomas Howard, Henry Somerset, Charles Blount,
Henry Howard, Sir Thomas Fleming, Sir Thomas Walmesley and Sir Peter
Warburton, quite a biased group. Counsel for the crown were Sir Edward
Philips and Sir Edward Coke&quot; Coke was know as a &quot;savage prosecutor&quot;.
Philips spent time as a Circuit Judge responsible for among other things
cutting off the ears of Catholics.
Lack of representation was not unusual for the period nor was the
use of torture to force confessions. Alteration of the evidence was
common. The only evidence required was very strong: they were Catholics,
in close communication with Jesuits, a part of an underground army of
the Counter Reformation working on behalf of the Pope for the
restoration of England to the true faith and possibly the defeat of
England by Spain. This was fact and took precedence over all else. The
Indictment (on right) was Pronounced.
All except Digby pleaded not guilty. He had been arraigned on a
separate indictment in Northamptonshire. Fawkes was singled out by
Popham. How could he be not guilty when found in a room full of
gunpowder with a pocket full of matches! But Popham had given Fawkes an
opportunity to speak-he did not deny being part of the plot but what he
did say was in relation to the priests: &quot;We never opened the matter to
them.&quot; Cokehad no suitable reply, &quot;All that was put in for form of law,
because it must be presupposed,&quot; not very convincing.
To get things back on track,
Sir Edward Phillips got right up and said,

But of such horror and monstrous nature,
That before now the tongue of man never delivered,
The ear of man never heard,
The heart of man never conceived,
Nor the malice of hellish or earthly devil ever practiced.
For if it be abominable to murder the least,
If to touch God's anointed be to oppose themselves against God,
If by blood to subvert princes,states
and kingdoms, be hateful to God
and man, as all true Christians must
acknowledge.
Then how much more than too
monstrous shall all Christian hearts
judge the horror of this reason , to
murder and subvert
Such a king,
Such a queen,
Such a progeny,
Such a state,
Such a government,
So complete and absolute,
That God approves.
The world admires,
All true English hearts honor and reverence,
The Pope and his disciples only envy and malign.

Then Coke took over. He described the &quot;gentlemen of good houses, of
excellent parts, of very competent fortunes and estates ... who have
been most perniciously seduced, abused, corrupted and Jesuited... The
Principal offenders are the seducing Jesuits men that use the reverence
of religion, yea even the most sacred and blessed name of Jesus, as a
mantle to cover their impiety,blasphemy, treason and rebellion...&quot; The
trial was only a first step to bringing the priests to justice. Cecil
had instructed Coke in how the trial was to take place.

These things I am commanded to
renew unto your memory. First that
you be sure to make it appear to the
world that there was an employment
of some persons to Spain for a
practice of invasion (referring to the
visit of Thomas Winter to Madrid )
as soon as the Queens breath was
out of her body. The reason is this
for which the King doth urge it. He
saith some men there are that will
give out and do that only despair of
the King's courses on the Catholics
and his severity draw all these to
such works of discontentment
where by you it will appear that
before his Majesty face was ever
seen or that he had done anything in
government, the King of Spain was
approached through he refused it,
saying 'he rather expected to have
peace'...You must remember to lay
Owen as found in this as you can.

In the trial Cecil noted that gunpowder itself was the invention of a
Friar, &quot;one of the Romash Rabble.&quot; Jokes were made. &quot;If the trial had
been conducted sooner they would have hung John Johnson (the alias used
by Fawkes) instead of Guy Fawkes&quot;. From the scriptures he quoted: &quot;the
proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net a broad yea and set
traps in my way.&quot; Cecil reflected upon the tolerance of James
and then laid out the punishment which was due traitors:

First after a traitor hath had his just
trial and is convicted and attained he
shall have his judgment to be drawn
to the place of execution from his
prison as being not worthy any more
to tread upon the face of the earth,
whereof he was made. Also that he
hath been retrograde by nature, and
there fore he is drawn backwards at
a horses tail. And whereas god hath
made the head of a man the highest
and most supreme part as being his
chief grace and ornament he must
be drawn with his head declining
downward, and lying so near the
ground as may be being thought
unfit to take benefit of the common
air. For which cause also he shall be
strangled being hanged up by the
neck between heaven and earth as
deemed unworthy of both or either
as likewise that the eyes of men may
behold and their hearts condemn
him. Then he is to be cut down alive
and to have his privy parts cut off
and burnt before his face, as being
unworthy begotten and unfit to
leave any generation after him. His
bowels and inlaid parts taken out
and burnt who inwardly had
conceived and harbored in his heart
such horrible treason after to have
his head cut off which had imagined
the mischief and lastly his body to
be quartered and the quarters set up
in some high and eminent place to
the view and detestation of men and
to become a prey for the fowls of
the air. And this is a reward due to
traitors.

The guilty were caught red handed and the Jesuits, who were captured
but absent, were behind it all. When Cecil was done the jury retired
without a word from the accused. Digby was then tried separately and,
because of his guilty plea, was allowed to speak. He was involved for
four reasons: first, Loyalty to Catesby; second, religion; third, James
change from tolerance to intolerance; and finally, the view that even
harsher rules against Catholics were to come.

He asked to be punished alone and that his family be spared. Coke
answered:, from the 109th Psalm, &quot;May his children be fatherless and
his wife a widow. Let his children be carried about vagabonds and
beg in one generation may his name be blotted out&quot;

To which Digby might well have replied, &quot;The mouth of the wicked
and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me&quot;. The
Arraignment of Sir Everard Digby: Then was Sir Everard Digby arraigned,
and after his Indictment was read ; wherein he was charged, not only to
have been acquainted with the Powder-Treason, and concealed it, and
taken the double Oath of Secrecy and Constancy therein,
but likewise to have been an Actor in this Conspiracy ;
and lastly to have exposed, and openly shewed
himself in the Rebellion in the Country amongst the rest of the
Traitors. All which after he had attentively heard and marked, knowing
that he had confessed it, and the strength and Evidence of the Proofs
against him, and convicted with the Testimony of his own Conscience,
shewed his Disposition to confess the principal Part of the said
Indictment, and so began to enter into a Discourse. But being advertised
that he must first plead to the Indictment directly, either Guilty, or
not Guilty ; and that afterwards he should be licensed to speak his
Pleasure ; he forthwith confessed the Treason contained in the
Indictment, and so fell into a Speech, whereof there were two Parts,
viz. Motives, and Petitions. The first Motive which drew him into this
Action, was not Ambition or Discontentment of his Estate, neither Malice
to any in Parliament, but the Friendship and Love he bare to Catesby,
which prevailed so much, and was so powerful with him, as that for his
sake he was ever contented and ready to hazard himself and his Estate.
The next Motive, was the Cause of Religion, which alone, seeing (as he
said) it lay at the stake, he entered into Resolution to neglect in that
behalf, his Estate, his Life, his Name, his Memory, his Posterity, and
all worldly and earthly Felicity whatsoever ; tho' he did utterly
extirpate, and extinguish all other hopes for the restoring of the
Catholick Religion in England. His third Motive was, that Promises were
broken with the Catholicks. And lastly, That they generally feared
harder Laws from this Parliament against Recusants, as that Recusants
Wives, and Women should be liable to the Mulct as well as their Husbands
and Men. And further, that it was supposed, that it should be made a
Præmunire, only to be a Catholick.

His Petitions were, That sithence his Offence was confined and
contained within himself, that the Punishment also of the same might
extend only to himself, and not to be transferred either to his Wife,
Children, Sisters, or others : And therefore for his Wife he humbly
craved, that she might enjoy her Jointure ; his Son the benefit of an
Entail made long before any thought of this Action ; his Sisters, their
just and due Portions, which were in his Hands ; his Creditors their
rightful Debts, which that he might more justly set down under his Hand,
he requested that before his Death, his Man (who was better acquainted
both with the Men, and the Particulars than himself) might be licensed
to come unto him. Then prayed he Pardon of the King and Lords for his
Guilt. And lastly he entreated to be beheaded ; desiring all Men to
forgive him, and that his Death might satisfy them for his Trespass.

To this Speech forthwith answered Sir Edward Coke Attorney-General, but
in respect of the time (for it grew now dark) very briefly :
1.For his Friendship with Catesby, that it was mere Folly and wicked
Conspiracy.
2.His Religion, Error, and Heresy.
3.His Promises, idle and vain Presumptions, as also his Fears, false
Alarms, Concerning Wives that were Recusants, if they were known so to
be before their Husbands (though they were good Protestants) took them,
and yet for outward and worldly Respects whatsoever, any would match
with such; great reason there is, that he or they should pay for it as
knowing the Penalty and Burden before: for volenti &amp; scienti non sit
Injuria; No Man receives Injury in that, to which he willingly and
knowingly agreeth and consenteth. But if she were no Recusant at the
time of Marriage, and yet afterwards he suffer her to be corrupted and
seduced, by admitting Priests and Romanists into his House; good
reason likewise that he, be he Papist or Protestant, should pay for
his Negligence and Misgovernment.
4.Concerning the Petitions for Wife, for Children, for Sisters, &amp;c. O
how he doth now put on the bowels of Nature and Compassion, in the peril
of his private and domestical Estate ! But before, when the publick
State of his Country, when the King, the Queen, the tender Princes, the
Nobles, the whole Kingdom were designed to a perpetual Destruction;
where was then this Piety, this religious Affection, this Care ? All
Nature, all Humanity, all Respect of Laws both divine and human, were
quite abandoned; then was there no Conscience made to extirpate the
whole Nation, and all for a pretended Zeal to the Catholick Religion,
and the Justification of so detestable and damnable a Fact.

Here did Sir Everard Digby interrupt Mr. Attorney, and said that he did
not justify the Fact, but confessed that he deserved the vilest Death,
and most severe Punishment that might be:But he was an humble Petitioner
for Mercy, and some Moderation of Justice. Whereupon Mr. Attorney
replied, that he should not look by the King to be honoured in the
manner of his Death, having so far abondoned all Religion and Humanity
in his Action : But that he was rather to admire the great Moderation
and Mercy of the King, in that for so
exorbitant a Crime, no new Torture answerable thereunto was devised to
be inflicted upon him. And for his Wife and Children, whereas he said
that for the Catholick Cause he was content to neglect the Ruin of
himself, his Wife, his Estate, and all; he should have his desire as it
is in the Psalm , Let his Wife be a Widow, and his Children Vagabonds,
let his Posterity be destroyed, and in the next Generation let his Name
be quite put out. For the paying of your Creditors, it is equal and
just; but yet fit the King be first satisfied and paid, to whom you owe
so much, as that all you have is too little : yet these things must be
left to the Pleasure of his Majesty, and the Course of Justice and Law.
Earl of Northamp. You must not hold it strange, Sir Everard Digby,
though at this time being pressed in Duty, Conscience and Truth, I do
not suffer you to wander in the Labyrinth of your own idle Conceits,
without opposition, to seduce others, as yourself have been seduced, by
false Principles, or to convey yourself by Charms of Imputation, by
Clouds of Error, and by Shifts of lately devised Equivocation, out of
that straight wherein your late secure and happy Fortune hath been
unluckily entangled, but yet justly surprized by the Rage and Revenge of
your own rash Humours. If in this Crime (more horrible than any Man is
able to express) I could lament the Estate of any Person upon Earth, I
could pity you ; but thank yourself and your bad Counsellors for leading
you into a Crime of such a kind, as no less benumbeth in all faithful,
true and honest Men, the Tenderness of Affection, than did in you the
Sense of all Humanity.

That you were once well thought of and esteemed by the late Queen, I
can witness, having heard her speak of you with that Grace, which might
have encouraged a true Gentlemen to have run a better Course. Nay, I
will add further, that there was a time wherein you were as well
affected to the King our Master's Expectation, though perhaps upon false
Rumours andReports, that he would have yielded Satisfaction to your
unprobable and vast Desires ; but the Seed that wanted moisture (as our
Saviour himself reporteth ) took no deep Root : that Zeal which hath no
other End or Object than the pleasing of itself, is quickly spent ; and
Trajan, that worthy and wise Emperor, had reason to hold himself
discharged of all Debts to those that had offended more by
Prevarication, than they could ever deserve by Industry.

The Grace and Goodness of his Majesty in giving Honour at his first
coming unto many Men of your own Affection, and (as I think) unto
yourself ; his Facility in admitting all without distinction of Trojan
or of Tyrian, to his Royal Presence, upon just occasions of Access; his
Integrity in setting open the Gate of civil Justice unto all his
Subjects equally and indifferently, with many other Favours that
succeeded by the Progression of Peace ; are so palpable and evident to
all Men, that have either Eyes of Understanding, or Understanding of
Capacity, as yourself and many others have been driven of late to excuse
and countenance your execrable Ingratitude with a false and scandalous
Report of some further Hope and Comfort yielded to the Catholicks for
Toleration and Connivance, before his coming to the Crown, than since
hath been performed, made good or satisfied. I am not ignorant, that
this seditious and false Alarm hath awaked and incited many working
Spirits to the prejudice of the present State, that might otherwise have
slept as before with silence and sufferance ; it hath served for a
Shield of Wax against a Sword of Power : it hath been used as an
Instrument of Art to shadow false Approaches, till the Trojan Horse
might be brought within the Walls of the Parliament, with a Belly
stuffed, not as in old time with armed Greeks, but with hellish
Gunpowder. But howsoever God had blinded you and others in this Action,
as he did the King of Egypt and his Instruments, for the brighter
Evidence of his own powerful Glory ; yet every Man of Understanding
could discern, that a Prince whose Judgment had been fixed by Experience
of so many Years upon the Poles of the North and the South, could not
shrink upon the sudden : no nor since with fear of that Combustion which
Catesby that Arch-Traitor, like a second Phaeton, would have caused in
an instant in all the Elements. His Majesty did never value Fortunes of
the World, in lesser Matter than Religion, with the Freedom of his
Thoughts : he thought it no safe Policy (professing as he did, and ever
will) to call up more Spirits into the Circle than
he could put down again ; he knew, that omne regnum in se divisum
desolabitar, Philosophy doth teach, that whatsoever any Man may think in
secret thought, that where one doth hold of Ciphas, another of Apollo,
openly Dissension ensues, Quod insitum alieno solo est, in id que alitur
natura vertente degenerat ; and the World will ever apprehend, that
Quorum est commune symbolum, facillimus est transitus.

Touching the Point itself of promising a kind of Toleration to
Catholicks, as it was divulged by these two Limbs of Lucifer, Watson and
Percy, to raise a ground of Practice and Conspiracy against the state
and Person of our dear Sovereign, let the Kingdom of Scotland witness
for the space of so many Years before his coming hither, whether either
Flattery or Fear (no, not upon that Enterprize of the 17th of November,
which would have put the patience of any Prince in Europe to his proof)
could draw from the King the least Inclination to this dispensative
Indifference, that was only believed, because it was eagerly desired.

Every Man doth known how great Art was used, what strong Wits sublimed,
and how many Ministers suborned and corrupted many Years both in
Scotland and in foreign Parts, to set the King's Teeth an edge with fair
Promises of future Helps and Supplies, to that happy End of attaining
his due Right in England, when the Sun should set, to rise more
gloriously in the same Hemisphere, to the wonder both of this Island and
of the World. But all in vain ; for jacta erat alea, the King's Compass
had been set before, and by a more certain Rule, nd they were commonly
cast off as forlorn Hopes in the King's Favour, that ran a Course of
ranking themsleves in the foremost Front of foreign Correspondency.

Upon notice given to his Majesty from hence some Years before the Death
of the late Queen, that many Men were grown suspicious of his Religion,
by Rumours spread abroad, that some of those in foreign Parts, that
seemed to be well-affected to his future Expectation, had used his Name
more audaciously, and spoken of his Favour to the Catholicks more
forwardly than the King's own Conscience and unchangeable Decree could
acknowledge or admit (either with a purpose to prepare the Minds of
foreign Princes, or for a practice to estrange and alienate Affections
at home) not only utterly renounced and condemned these Encroachments of
blind Zeal, and rash Proceedings, by the Voices of his own Ministers,
but was careful also for a Caution to succeeding Hopes, so far as lay
in him, that by the Disgrace of the Delinquents in this kind, the Minds
of all English Subjects chiefly might be secured, and the World
satisfied.

No man can speak in this Case more confidently than myself, that
received in the Queen's time, for the space of many Years, Directions
and Warnings to take heed, that neither any further Comfort might be
given to Catholicks, concerning future Favours, than he did intend,
which was to bind all Subjects in one Kingdom to one Law, concerning the
Religion
established, howsoever in Civil Matters he might extend his Favour as
he found just cause : nor any Seeds of Jealousy and Diffidence sown in
the Minds of Protestants by Semcis and Achitophels, to make them
doubtful of his Constancy, to whom he would confirm with his dearest
Blood, that Faith which he had sucked from the Breast of his Nurse,
apprehended from the Cradle of his Infancy, and maintained with his
uttermost Endeavour, Affection and Strength : since he was more able out
of reading and disputing, to give a reason of those Principles which he
had now digested and turned to Nutriment.

He that wrote the Book of Titles before the late Queen's Death,
declares abundantly by seeking to possess some Foreign Prince of the
King's Hereditary Crowns, when the Cause should come to the proof, and
may witness instead of many ; what hope there was of the King's Favour
or Affection to Catholicks in the case of Toleration or Dispensation,
with Exercise of Conscience. For every Man may guess that it was no
slight or ordinary degree of Despair, that made him and other of his
Suit renounce their Portion in the Son and Heir of that renowned and
rare Lady, Mary Queen of Scotland, a Member of the Roman Church ; as
some did in David, Nulla nobis pars in David, nec hæreditas in filio
Isai : For hereof by Letters intercepted in their Passage into Scotland,
the Records and Proofs are evident. His Majesty, so long as he was in
expectation of that which by the Work and Grace of God he doth now
possess, did ever seek to settle his Establishment upon the Faith of
Protestants in generality, as the most assured Sheet-Anchor. For tho' he
found a number on the other side, as faithful and as well-affected to
his Person, Claim and Interest, as any Men alive, as well in respect of
their dependency upon the Queen his Mother, as for the
taste which they had of the sweetness of himself ; yet finding with
what strength of Blood many have been over-carried out of a Fervency in
Zeal in former Times, observing to what Censures they were subject, both
in Points of Faith, and Limitation of Loyalty : And last of all,
forcasting to what end their former Protestation would come, when
present Satisfaction should shrink ; he was ever fearful to embark
himself for any further Voyage and Adventure in this Strait, than his
own Compass might steer him, and his Judgment level him.

If any one green Leaf for Catholicks could have been visibly discerned
by the eye of Catesby, Winter, Garnet, Fawkes, &amp;c. they would neither
have entred into Practice with foreign Princes during the Queen's time
for prevention of the King's Lawful and Hereditary Right, nor have
renewed the same both abroad and at home by Missions and Combinations,
after his Majesty was both applauded and entred.

It is true, that by Confessions we find, that false Priest Watson, and
Arch-Traitor Percy, to have been the first Devisers and Divulgers of
this scandalous Report, as an accursed Ground, whereon they might with
some Advantage, as it was conceived, build the Castles of their
Conspiracy.

Touching the first, no Man can speak more soundly to the point than
myself : for being sent into the Prison by the King to charge him with
this false Alarm, only two days before his Death, and upon his Soul to
press him in the presence of God, and as he would answer it at another
Bar, to confess directly whether at either of both these times he had
access unto his Majesty at Edinborough, his Majesty did give him any
Promise, Hope or Comfort or Encouragement to Catholicks concerning
Toleration ; he did there protest upon his Soul that he could never win
one Inch of Ground, or draw the smallest Comfort from the King in those
degrees, nor further than that he would have them apprehend, that as he
was a Stranger to this State, so till he understood in all Points how
those matters stood, he would not promise Favour any way ; but did
protest that all the Crowns and Kingdoms in this World, should not
induce him to change any jot of his Profession, which was the Pasture of
his Soul, and Earnest of his eternal Inheritance. He did confess that in
very deed, to keep up the Hearts of Catholicks in Love and Duty to the
King, he had imparted the King's words to many, in a better Tune, and a
higher kind of Descant, than his Book of plain Song did direct; because
he knew that others like sly Bargemen looked that way, when their stroke
was bent another way. For this he craved Pardon of the King in humble
Manner, and for his main Treasons of a higher Nature than these Figures
of Hypocrisy ; and seemed penitent, as well for the Horror of his Crime,
as for the Falshood of his Whisperings.

It hindered not the Satisfaction which may be given to Percy's Shadow
(the most desperate Boutefeu in the Pack), that as he died impenitent,
for any thing we know ; so likewise he died silent in the Particulars.
For first, it is not strange that such a Traitor should devise so
scandalous a Slander out of the Malice of his Heart, intending to
destroy the
King by any Means, and to advance all Means that might remove
Obstructions and Impediments to the Plot of Gunpowder. The more odious
that he could make him to the Party Malecontent, and the more sharply
that he could set the Party Malecontent upon the Point and Humour of
Revenge ; the stronger was his Hope at the giving of the last Blow, to
be glorified and justified. But touching the Truth of the Matters, it
will be witnessed by many, that this Traitor Percy after both the first
and second return from the King, brought to the Catholicks no spark of
Comfort, of Encouragement, of Hope ; whereof no stronger Proof of
Argument doth need, than that Fawkes and others were employed both into
Spain and other Parts, for the reviving of a Practice suspended and
covered, after Percy's coming back ; as in likelihood they should not
have been, in case he had returned with a Branch of Olive in his Mouth,
or yielded any Ground of Comfort to resolve upon.

Therefore I thought it thus far needful to proceed, for the clearing of
those Scandals that were cast abroad, by these forlorn Hopes and
graceless Intruments. It only remains that I Pray for your Repentance in
this world for the Satisfaction of many, and Forgiveness in the next
World, for the saving of yourself ; having had by the King's Favour so
long a Time to cast up your Account, before your Appearance at the Seat
of the great Auditor.

Then spake the Earl of Salisbury, especially to that Point, of his
Majesty's breaking of Promise with Recusants, which was used and urged
by Sir Everard Digby, as a Motive to draw him to participate in this so
hideous a Treason. Wherein his Lordship, after Acknowledgement that Sir
Everard Digby was his Ally, and having made a zealous and religious
Protestation concerning the Sincerity and Truth of that which he would
deliver ; shortly and clearly defended the Honour of the King herein ;
and freed his Majesty from all Imputation and Scandal of Irresolution in
Religion, and in the constant and perpetual maintaining thereof ; as
also from having at any time given the least Hope, much less Promise of
Toleration. To which purpose he declared how his Majesty, as well
before his coming to this Crown, as at that very Time, and always since,
was so far from making of Promise, or giving Hope of Toleration, that he
ever professed he should not endure the very Motion thereof from any.

And here his Lordship shewed what was done at Hampton-Court at the time
of Watson's Treason, where some of the greater Recusants were convented
: And being found then not to have their Fingers in Treason, were sent
away again with Encouragement to persist in their dutiful Carriage, and
with Promise only of thus much Favour, That those mean Profits which had
accrued since the King's time to his Majesty for their Recusancy, should
be forgiven to the principal Gentlemen, who had both at his Entry shewed
so much Loyalty, and had kept themselves so free since from all
Conspiracies.

Then did his Lordship also (the rather to shew how little Truth Sir
Everard Digby's Words did carry in any thing which he had spoken)
plainly prove, that all his Protestations wherein he denied so
constantly to be privy to the Plot of Powder, were utterly False, by the
Testimony of Fawkes (there present at the Bar) who had confessed, that
certain Months
before that Session, the said Fawkes being with Digby at his House in
the Country, about what time there had fallen much wet; Digby taking
Fawkes aside after Supper, told him that he was much afraid that the
Powder in the Cellar was grown dank, and that some new must be provided,
lest that should not take Fire.

Next, the said Earl did justly and greatly commend the Lord Mounteagle
for his Loyal and honourable Care of his Prince and Country, in the
speedy bringing forth of the Letter sent unto him; wherein he said,
that he had shewed both his Discretion and Fidelity. Which Speech being
ended, Digby then acknowledged, that he spake not that of the Breach of
Promise out of his own Knowledge, but from their Relation whom he
trusted; and namely from Sir Tho. Tresham.----Source:A Complete

Winter, Guy Fawkes, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keyes,
Thomas Bates, and Sir Everard Digby, at Westminster for High-Treason,
being Conspirators in the Gunpowder-Plot. 27 Jan. 1605. 3 Jac. l.

As the account above indicates -promises of toleration struck a
sore point. However those promises had not been given to Digby
personally but to Percy, who was conveniently dead. Henry Howard stated
that such promises could not and would not have been made. Digby
admitted that he had received the information concerning tolerance
second hand from Sir Thomas Tresham.

The Verdict:

The Jury returned and gave their verdict: Fawkes; Thomas,Robert and
John Winter; Rookwood; Grant; Bates and Keyes were all guilty. Digby was
of course guilty and asked
to be beheaded instead of drawn and quartered.
The prisoners were asked what they could say wherefore judgment of
Death should not be pronounced against them.
The Winters &quot;... accounted themselves not guilty of any crime in
the sight of God, Whom they sought to serve and please in the action and
would not for any other respect
have attempted it.&quot; Had it not been such a high crime the younger
Winter could be spared but not in this case, although all sensed the
tragedy. &quot;Thomas Winter only desired, that he might be hanged both for
his Brother and himself. &quot;- Trial Transcript
Rookwood cited friendship with Catesby and loyalty to the Catholic
religion.
The author of the Kings Book responded, &quot;He would fain have made
his bringing up and breeding in idolatry to have been some excuse to his
villainy but a fair tale could not
help a foul deed&quot;&quot;But Ambrose Rookwood first excused his denial of the
Indictment, for that he had rather lose his Life than give it. Then did
he acknowledge his Offence to be so heinous, that he justly deserved
the Indignation of the King, and of the Lords, and the Hatred of the
whole Commonwealth ; yet could he not despair of Mercy at the Hands of
a Prince, so abounding in Grace and Mercy : And the rather, because his
Offence, tho' it were incapable of any Excuse, yet not altogether
incapable of some Extenuation, in that he had been neither Author nor
Actor, but only persuaded and drawn in by Catesby, whom he loved above
any worldly Man : And that he had concealed it not for any Malice to the
Person of the King, or to the State, or for any ambitious Respect of
his own, but only drawn with the tender Respect, and the faithful and
dear Affection he bare to Mr. Catesby his Friend, whom he esteem'd
dearer than any thing else in the World. And this Mercy he desired not
for any fear of the Image of Death, but for grief that so shameful a
Death should leave so perpetual a blemish and blot unto all Ages, upon
his Name and Blood. But howsoever that this was his first Offence, yet
he humbly submitted himself to the Mercy of the King, and prayed that
the King would herein imitate God, who sometimes doth punish
corporaliter, non mortaliter, corporally, yet not mortally.

Then was related how that on the Friday immediately before this
Arraignment, Robert Winter having found opportunity to have Conference
with Fawkes in the Tower, in regard of the
nearness of their Lodgings, should say to Fawkes, as Robert Winter and
Fawkes confessed, That he and Catesby had Sons, and that Boys would be
Men, and that he hoped they would
Revenge the Cause ; nay, that God would raise up Children to Abraham
out of Stones : Also that they were sorry, that nobody did set forth a
Defence or Apology of their Action, but yet they would maintain the
Cause at their Deaths.

Here also was reported Robert Winter's Dream, which he had before the
blasting with Powder in Littleton's House, and which he himself
confessed and first notified, viz. That he thought he saw Steeples
stand awry, and within those Churches strange and unknown Faces. And
after, when the foresaid Blast had the Day following scorched divers of
the Confederates, and much disfigured the Faces and Countenances of
Grant, Rookwood, and others ; then did Winter call to Mind his Dream,
and to his Remembrance thought, that the Faces of his Associates so
scorched, resembled those which he had seen in his Dream. &quot;-Trial
Transcript John Grant admitted his guilt of a conspiracy intended
but never carried out. &quot;John Grant was a good while mute ; yet after,
submissively said, He was guilty of a Conspiracy intended, but never
effected. &quot;-Trial Transcript

Guy Fawkes again spoke of the innocence of the Priests. He was much
tortured and in pain and not well. He acknowledged his own guilt and
stated that he was ready to die for
it. &quot;Guy Fawkes being asked, Why he pleaded Not Guilty, having
nothing to say for his Excuse : answered, That he had so done in respect
of certain Conferences mention'd in the Indictment, which he said that
he knew not of : Which were answered to have been set down according to
Course of Law, as necessarily pre-supposed before the Resolution of such
a Design.&quot;- Trial Transcript

Robert Keyes made a spirited speech which was quite defiant. He
discussed the persecution which had motivated the plot and personal
experience. He was glad of the occasion of the trial and was not afraid
of the sentence of death. There could be for him no better cause than to
die for freedom. &quot;Keys said, That his Estate and Fortunes were
desperate, and as good now as at another time, and for this Cause rather
than for another. &quot;- Trial Transcript

Bates, the serving man, had little to say. He said it was done for
love of master. Popham Lord Chief Justice then defended the Recussancy
Laws passed by Elizabeth and that they were &quot;necessary mild equal
moderate and to be justified to all the world.&quot; He then pronounced
judgment and read the description of the penalty once again.
There was a pause. All eyes turned to Digby, who bowed to the Lords
and said, &quot;If I may but hear any of your Lordships say you forgive me I
shall go more cheerfully to the
gallows.&quot; The Lords said, &quot;God forgive you and we do.&quot; It was however
only a verbal forgiveness.
They were taken out from Westminster Hall into the cold and by boat
to the Tower.
Cecil wrote later: &quot;Most of them confessed their offense against
God and this State, some few and especially Grant did obstinately hold
that this late action was no sin against God but all died true Roman
Catholics.&quot; The conspirators probably would have taken this as the
highest compliment.

Execution:

There was a considerable delay between judgment and execution. The
trial was on Monday the 27th of January 1606. Tuesday and Wednesday they
remained in the Tower, but not to prepare for death. There were no
visitors, only Father Strange who ministered to them. The delay instead
was for the construction of a scaffold, arrangement of the butchering
blocks and issue of plans for crowd control. The Gala was to
begin.... There might be protests. Sheriff Verneys house had been
set on fire twice when holding prisoners from Holbeach. The Lord Mayor
ordered that one able person with halberd in hand stand at every door of
every dwelling house in the open street along the way that the traitors
were to be drawn towards the place of execution. Sir Arthur Gorges wrote
a complaint to Cecil: The gate of Paul's Churchyard was not the place
for the executions. But they took place there, the location only changed
on the second day to the Old Palace Yard.
On January 30, a Thursday first conspirators were drawn behind
horses, heads downward, on a framework of poles through crowded streets
of London toward St. Paul's. They were Digby, Robert Winter, John Grant
and Thomas Bates. It is said that a he passed one of the Digby boys
shouted &quot;Tata, tata&quot; to his father. Marthat Bates broke free of the
guards to jump onto her husband's hurdle protesting his fate. Bates
told his wife where he had stashed the money given to hikm by Jack
Wright. (She eventually found it and was allowed to keep it!)
The executions wre planned for 8:00 A.M. .It would have been dark.
The hangman was ready for them there,at the western end of the
churchyard of St. Pauls, next to the Bishop of London's house, waiting
beside his ladder on the scaffold. The butcher stood beneath at his
block with his knives and cleavers for the quartering. The fire was
already burning to receive their privates and entrails. The hangman's
skill was not to kill them instantly by breaking their necks. It was far
more entertaining to deliver them to the block when still alive. The
prisoner mounts the ladder to the gibbet arm, the rope is placed around
his neck, then the hangman would turn him off the ladder. The prisoner
was instantly cut down and sent to the block very much alive.
Digby went first. He grew pale and eye heavy. He spoke briefly,
noting that he held no offense having been directed by his religion and
conscience. but asked forgiveness of God, the king and the whole kingdom
for breaking the law. Sir Everard would not pray with the Protestant
preachers. He crossed himself and prayed his Latin prayers. He gave
great satisfaction to the standers by. The hangman did not kill him but
cut him down fully consious. He made no resistance to the block whilst
he was in quartering and his bowels and heart were cast into the fire
and his head cut off, the hangman holding it up as is usual. It was
noted that there was no alteration at all in his countenance. It was
also said by Anthony á Wood that &quot;When the executioner pluckt out his
heart holding up saying 'this is the heart of a traitor,' that Digby&quot;
Sir Everard made the statement, 'Thou Liest.'&quot;
Winter went next, making no call for mercy, just a few prayers.
Then John Grant, with a short speech excusing himself by his dedication
to religion.It was &quot;No Sin against
God&quot;Grant had been blinded at Holbeach and was helped up the ladder.
Then came Bates, who noted again that it was done only for the love of
his master Catesby. He asked forgiveness of God, King and kingdom. Bates
makes an interesting statement which contrasts with that of Grant.
Bates was aware that he had forgotten his patriotic duty to god
king and country. Unlike Grant Bates clearly felt the importantce of
his responsibilities to the nation being more important than those to
church.
The first executions ended. The air must of smelled of burning
human flesh and pitch. Their quarters were dipped in tar to preserve
them whilst on display and their heads set up on display at London
Bridge.
Garnet writes, &quot;Many of the beholders returned full of pity and
compassion towards so worthy minded men...especially Sir Everard Digby
whose fortitude of mind they did so much admire and had so great
opinions of his devotions that for all that day and some time after they
could talk almost of nothing else.&quot;
Then the crowds came back the next day in their thousands lining
the three mile route between the Tower and Old Palace yard in
Westminster. The site was appropriate- right
next to the building that was to have been blown up. They were hanging
from upper story windows and rooftops. The day was Friday the 31st of
January 1606.
It was now the turn of Thomas Winter, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert
Keyes and Guy Fawkes. Rookwood knew he would be drawn past the house
where his wife was staying. He asked to be told when that was. He paused
and could see her standing in a window. He shouted, &quot;Pray for me!&quot; She
answers that she would. He then shouts, &quot;I will and be of good courage
and offer thyself wholly to God. I for my part do as freely restore thee
to God as he gave thee unto me.&quot;
Thomas Winter, the only survivor of the original inner ring, was
the first. He was asked to speak but replied that he had already told
all to the Council. He had come to die
and noted that the priests were not to blame. In the tradition of those
who will not confess he was cut down quickly while still conscious.
Rookwood followed making a long speech asking forgiveness from King
and State. He prayed for James, the Queen and their Children .He prayed
to God to make James a Catholic, as the historian noted : &quot;a line which
was to mar all the potage with one filthy weed.&quot; Rookwood received a
longer hanging following his request for forgiveness.
Then next was Keyes. He tried to jump from the ladder but the rope
broke. He was quickly taken to the block and divided into four parts.
The last was the one to become the most famous. Already tortured
into ill health, Guy Fawkes could hardly go up the ladder. He asked a
kind of forgiveness of the King,
prayed and then jumped off the ladder, breaking his neck. He was spared
the pain of the inevitable butchery.
John Winter was left in the Tower for a few weeks but was taken to
Worcester and executed at Red Hill on April 7 1606. He was executed
there along with Father Oldcorne,
Humphrey Littleton and Ralph Ashley. Wintour was buried at Huddington
in the Chancel under plain stones with his sister in law Geretrude.
Father Oldcorne prayed to St. Winifred as he died. Humphrey Littleton
said that he deserved his death for turning in the two priests. Stafford
was the site for the execution of Stephen Litleton and Henry Morgan.
They all were convinced that they died serving religious freedom.
But in such a way, however, which was against the law and threatened a
state for which Catholic causes were linked to empire building on the
part of Spain and reconquest of souls by the Rome.

Digby wrote a beautiful epitaph:

Who's that which knocks? O stay, my Lord I come I know that call
since first it made me know My self, which makes me now with joy to
run Lest he be gone that can my duty show Jesu my Lord I know Thee by
the Cross Thou offerst me, but not unto my loss.

This was found in his papers in the Tower after his death.

Consequences
On the 6th of February 1606,Cecil addressed a joint session of
Parliament which he was pleased to find had come prepared with articles
containing suggestions for harsher laws concerning the priests and
papists. He was happy to encourage them.

Yet Henry Garnet remained alive...
That very day Father Garnet was on the final portion of his journey
from Worcester to London. Cecil wrote to Lord Dirleton, &quot;Thus have you
in effect the true state of
Parliament causes to which I will only make this addition, that we are
sure of Hall and Walley (Garnet) in the Gatehouse to which place we have
this night committed them
themselves not sticking now to acknowledge their dignities.&quot;
Cecil's enemy of more than 20 years was now being brought into his
grasp. Yet Garnet proved a very difficult nut to crack.......

As we continue we shall learn of the miracle and of the brave Jesuit...

Father Garnet and one other priest had know all along of the Gunpowder
Plot. They knew those responsible intimately. Instead of telling the
government and the king at once, they chose to ask Rome what they should
do in the event that they knew that violent action involving the murder
of all in Parliament, the King and his family was being contemplated.
The state could not in any way think well of this. After his stay at
Holt Castle with Bromley was complete, Garnet left to London with Thomas
Abingdon, Father Hall, Ashley and Little John Owen. It took them three
days to reach London. Garnet was still suffering from his hiding. The
Priests were taken to the Gatehouse while the other prisoners were put
into Marshalsea prison.
After three or four days Garnet was examined by members of the Privy
Council who were polite. They were impressed with the man and his
knowledge. One of the council said, &quot;He could not be misliked but for
matter of doctrine only. As for the Powder he was clear of it.&quot; Cecil,
on the other hand, had other evidence and set out to demonstrate guilt.
Garnet was brought before the entire Privy council on February 13. A
courteous meeting but the pressure was mounting. Technical aspects of
religious doctrine were discussed. The Council was also interested in
the names of others who might have been involved. Garnet was moved from
the Gatehouse to the Tower the next day. He mentioned in his writings
the courteous treatment he received. Cecil was working to catch Garnet
off guard.
Cecil assigned a keeper to Garnet with instructions to pretend to be
interested in becoming Catholic. At first Garnet was suspicious but then
accepted the planted spy. Luxuries were permitted. He could buy wine and
send letters to Catholics on the outside asking for clothing and
spectacles. But using the messenger to carry letters he placed himself
into a trap. He wrote to his nephew Thomas Garnet, also a Jesuit being
held in the tower, and to Anne Vaux, who would relay any cryptic or
secret messages which he might be able to include in the letters to the
Jesuit society or other Catholics. Unknown to the priest, the letters
were opened and read. A skilled forger, Thomas Phelippes, himself a
prisoner in the Tower, copied them and passed them on minus secret
messages and encoded lines. There were such secret messages included
written in orange juice as well as encoded lines.
Cecil found as a result that Anne Vaux should be brought in. She was
arrested and imprisoned in the Tower around March 11 and stayed there
till the following August. But she did not give in and gave not one
word. She had after all signed a letter to Garnet &quot;your loving sister&quot;,
which prompted Cecil to call Garnet &quot;Senex Fornicarius,&quot; for which he
apologized. Still there are questions though about the relationship. It
was extremely close and dangerous.
Working on Garnet, Cecil made it possible for Hall to be transferred
into adjoining cells where they could speak with each other through a
small opening in the wall. The two priests heard each others confession.
Then they compared notes on their interrogations by the Council. The
conversations provided the essential information required for
conviction. They discussed Tesimond and the knowledge of the plot that
he had given Garnet in confession. Through the opening in the wall a
small cavity also lead to a chamber where two scribes had been stationed
to take down every word.
Garnet was again brought before the council, this time having been
purposely deprived of sleep and perhaps drugged. He could not talk for
thirst. He was given two glasses of beer, fell asleep and was let to
rest but was little better. He was in a befuddled state. However, he
revealed nothing. He was confronted with the partial knowledge that was
gained from the listeners. They knew he was guilty but not from whom he
received the information.
Tesimond had reached freedom and Garnet knew of this through the
grapevine. Tesimond had gone directly to the hive of activity to escape.
He had realized that the plot was done for and immediately rode to
London. He was in fact reading a proclamation for his own arrest in a
London street when one of the crowd recognized him. They took him to a
dark alley where he escaped, crossing to France from Dover with a cargo
of pigs.
The seal of the confessional no longer applied. Catesby had lifted it
by writing openly to Garnet at Coughton and the plot was no longer
secret. Garnet was tricked and knew it. He knew that torture would
continue. He decided that through confession there might come mercy so
agreed to confess. He declared on the 8th of March to the Council that
he had knowledge of the plot beforehand but was under the seal of the
confessional. He stated that the knowledge had come from Tesimond.
Cecil then lied to Garnet stating that Tesimond had actually been
captured and was a prisoner in the Tower and that he denied that
Garnet's knowledge had come under the seal. Garnet was stunned. &quot;It may
be that he meant not so but I stand to it as the truth is that I took it
so, both because he offered confession and a few days after came to
confession.&quot;
A letter Garnet wrote to Tesimond, who he believed to be in the Tower,
came into the possession of Cecil and was found in his papers. He was
concerned about Tesimond's fate but also underlines the fact that no
other knowledge came to him outside the seal.
Nicholas Little John Owen was also in the prison and was also now the
subject of torture. He was a cripple with a rupture having injured
himself in his priest hole construction activities. Being hanged from
the manacles or Topcliffes rack would surely be extremely painful for
him. Little John's information was also very important in regard to
priest holes as well as to the individuals involved, if only they could
make him talk.
Little John was tortured to such an extent that his bowels were forced
out, then later reinforced with an iron plate which cut him. The torture
continued until it is said that he cut himself and died in the process.
He took his secrets with him.
James Johnson, alias John Grissold, was also tortured concerning the
Vaux-Garnet connection as he was caretaker at White Webbs. He did under
torture list the visits of Garnet and the others to this Catholic &quot;safe
House&quot;. Johnson was released but still afterwards was followed closely
by the government.
Father Hall, with no direct knowledge in advance of the plot, was
guilty of helping those involved. He too was tortured extensively. He
had nothing new to tell of the plot. He was taken to Worcester with
Abingdon, John Winter and Ralph Ashley.
On the 7th day of April 1606 Hall was hanged drawn and quartered at
Red Hill, a mile outside Worcester. As was Ashley, young John Winter and
Humphrey Littleton. Thomas Abingdon, as the brother in law of Lord
Mounteagle, was given preferential treatment. After the execution of the
others he was released but was forbidden for life to leave
Worcestershire. He lived out his days doing antiquarian research.
At eight in the morning on Friday March 28, a coach rolls out of the
Tower towards Guildhall in the City of London. Sir William Wade and
another knight were accompanying a prisoner. The coach had its curtains
tightly drawn. Henry Garnet, Superior of the English Society of Jesus,
was going to trial. Henry Garnet , alias Walley alias Farmer alias
Darcy, &quot;had conspired with Robert Catesby to withdraw the hearts of the
subjects from their due obedience to God and their King and to deprive
the King of his crown, to kill him and the Prince and to slaughter the
whole Parliament assembled to raise rebellion to change religion, to
ruin the commonwealth and to bring in strangers....&quot; To this Garnet
plead not guilty, even though he had early knowledge of it all via
Tesimond through Catesby.
