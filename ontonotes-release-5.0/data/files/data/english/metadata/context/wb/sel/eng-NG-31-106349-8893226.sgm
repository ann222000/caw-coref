Wow, the &quot;city&quot; &quot;government&quot; is after this little girl but probably
does not waste a second worrying about illegal aliens who might be
carrying incurable diseases - perhaps they even give them drivers
licenses!

Don't kid yourself for a moment -&gt; THERE WILL BE CHANGE, THERE WILL BE
REFORM as voters everywhere start to rebel against this kind of
misdirected stupidity.

Both parties are in for a SURPRISE.

This time IT IS DIFFERENT.

get insurance and cancel it after the car is registered the first
time...it will never be registered or insured after that. Get a clue.

Well, I finally followed up and read about the case, and what happened
is that someone made a complaint, so the government issued a desist
letter.  The guy who sent the letter may not have known it was a 6
year old.  They got a complaint, and the law says what they are
supposed to do, so they did it.  I see no problem with that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Because local government is supposed to enforce local ordinances, such
as anti-graffiti laws.  The Federal government is supposed to enforce
immigration law.

Most people are happy that we have multiple levels of government, each
with its own sphere of influence and limits.

On this, I agree with you.  A driver's license should be
ONLY a certification that the person whose picture appears
in the license is a sufficiently capable driver, and not
a form of identification.

This is what it was BEFORE it started to be used for the
purpose of identification, and even without the picture.
Photography was expensive then.

And look what has happened with the Social Security number given each
citizen that was initially limited in use and purpose. It also has
become a means of identifying the possessor.

Each of these and other required documents have evolved into an
underground cottage industry for the purposes of counterfeiters and
traffickers of illegal documents for illegal uses as well as
undocumented migrants.

That is why we elect representatives.  If your congresscritter is
voting for laws that are unenforceable, then elect someone who will
repeal them or modify them so that they are enforceable.

The local government, on the other hand, has no say in enforcement of
federal laws.  Indeed the local government has only the powers that
the state government granted to it - our constitution recognizes only
three parties to governance: we the people, the state, and the
federal.

If we the people don't want to pay the enormous price to enforce
unenforceable laws (there has never been a long term successful
prevention of mass-migration, even in countries that don't practice
human rights, so the cost of strict enforcement would almost certainly
be astronomical in both economic and freedom terms), then indeed the
problem will not get solved.

The solution to rising crime rates is more cops and more courts.  The
solution to overcrowded schools and hospitals is to build more of
them.  If you want government on the cheap like most libertarians do,
then you better learn to live with overwhelmed services.

Neither.  My most recent foreign ancestor entered this country quite

Why enforce the immigration laws more strictly but not enforce the
traffic laws?  Most Americans consider it a fundamental right to be a
scofflaw on the freeway, and it costs more in human lives than illegal
immigration does.  Red light cameras everywhere - let's take enforcing
our laws seriously for once.

And if we are worried about the money, maybe the IRS should audit
everyone, because its a good bet that half the people who complain
about illegal immigration have cheated on their income tax at least
once.  That'd probably add a couple hundred billion to the tax
coffers, which might help pay for all the law enforcement people value
so highly when the laws are being enforced against someone else
besides them.

And have you ever hired someone and not submitted income tax and
social security withholding, or on the other side, failed to report
the income from such a job?

I have no truck with those who claim our society should not tolerate
people who avoid following the laws, when in fact most Americans pride
themselves on following the 11th commandment: &quot;don't get caught&quot;.

&gt;Neither.  My most recent foreign ancestor entered this country quite

&gt;&gt;Or just a stupid scofflaw.

&gt;Why enforce the immigration laws more strictly but not enforce the

&gt;scofflaw on the freeway, and it costs more in human lives than illegal
&gt;immigration does.  Red light cameras everywhere - let's take enforcing
&gt;our laws seriously for once.

&gt;And if we are worried about the money, maybe the IRS should audit
&gt;everyone, because its a good bet that half the people who complain
&gt;about illegal immigration have cheated on their income tax at least
&gt;once.  That'd probably add a couple hundred billion to the tax

You say that you opposed ideological approaches to government [sic].
One of the problems that folks seem to have with &quot;government&quot; is a
conundrum that few people can solve. The fact is: government does not
make decisions, people do. Government does not enforce laws, people
do. Government does not aid, assist, make war, make peace, make
anything, people do. This slight error of not knowing who is doing the
governing is reflected in the news when we read headlines such as,
&quot;CIA takes a more active role in arresting foreign agents.&quot; CIA didn't
do anything, it's only a building with a book of legislated policy
written by Congress and signed by a President. It is people who take
action, it is people who write legislation, it is the man in the
Office of the President that signs the legislation into law or vetoes
it. If voters were more willing to hold people instead of
&quot;departments&quot; or &quot;bureaus&quot; or an office accountable, some matters
would clear up and be understood easily as to the implications of
decisions and actions. Remember Harry S. Truman's oh so true statement
when it came to his decisions: The buck stops here!

Failing to hold individuals accountable is too often reflected in
seeing people elected or appointed to office and doing just the
opposite of what they said to get elected or appointed, political
party affiliation be damned.

Enjoy.

&gt; &gt;I DO.

&gt; Whoopie for you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Talk about the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;heavy hand of government...why can't they be so dedicated against
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;people who are in this country illegally instead of it's own CITIZENS?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Because local government is supposed to enforce local ordinances, such
&gt; &gt;&gt; as anti-graffiti laws.  The Federal government is supposed to enforce
&gt; &gt;&gt; immigration law.

&gt; &gt;Oh thank you for helping us out with the civics 101.  And if the
&gt; &gt;Federal government decides NOT to enforce some law, the locals can
&gt; &gt;just look the other way, and forget about it eh?

&gt; That is why we elect representatives.  If your congresscritter is
&gt; voting for laws that are unenforceable, then elect someone who will
&gt; repeal them or modify them so that they are enforceable.

&gt; The local government, on the other hand, has no say in enforcement of
&gt; federal laws.  Indeed the local government has only the powers that
&gt; the state government granted to it - our constitution recognizes only
&gt; three parties to governance: we the people, the state, and the
&gt; federal.

&gt; &gt;You simplistic view of government is EXACTLY the view that the Bush
&gt; &gt;administration hope that everyone will take.

&gt; Not hardly.

&gt; &gt;But REALITY has intervened
&gt; &gt;and the lawsuits have begun as cities plagued with rising crime rates,
&gt; &gt;overloaded schools, overwhelmed hospitals and other related problems
&gt; &gt;begin to fight back against a festering problem that will not go away
&gt; &gt;unless addressed.

&gt; If we the people don't want to pay the enormous price to enforce
&gt; unenforceable laws (there has never been a long term successful
&gt; prevention of mass-migration, even in countries that don't practice
&gt; human rights, so the cost of strict enforcement would almost certainly
&gt; be astronomical in both economic and freedom terms), then indeed the
&gt; problem will not get solved.

Conservative William H. Calhoun disagrees with you.
His comments on the idea that the laws against illegal immigration
are not enforceable can be found here:

http://www.theconservativevoice.com/article/19522.html

Calhoun states that:
&quot;In the 1950s when our country was under invasion, President
Eisenhower responded with &quot;Operation Wetback&quot; and deported over a
million illegals in a little over a year. Today, however, Bush says
that he is unable. Rather, he is unwilling. By 1950s standards, Bush
should be impeached and tried for treason&quot;.

WHICH is it Bob -&gt; UNWILLING OR UNABLE???

There IS a big difference!

Your humble respondent (and not at all libertarian (well maybe a wee
bit heh heh!!))

Well said!

And in November 2008 the PEOPLE are going to obliterate
and extirpate all of the conceptions of the neo-cons
from both the Republican and Democrat parties or whatever
is left of them.   Then congress will not DARE again
attempt the deception of a &quot;guest worker continuation&quot; bill
disguised as an Immigration &quot;Reform&quot; Bill - or if they persist
in these deceptions, there may very well be NO congress.

Why should I care?

There are any number of people that can be found to disagree about
anything.  I don't give a damn about any of them.

And one who advocates the use of land mines, when most of the world
