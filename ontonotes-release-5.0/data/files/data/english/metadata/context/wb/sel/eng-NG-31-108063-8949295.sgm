This is the second time I've tried growing luffa sponge gourds.  The first
time was nearly 20 years ago, and all I can remember is that it frosted
before the tiny gourds got big enough.  This time, I planted them very
early.  However, even though the plants have vined up all over my trellis,
there has not been even a single flower on them.

Anyone have any ideas for why this might be?  The plants are healthy and
growing.

I had a similar problem with melons. There was too much nitrogen in the soil.
I added 0-10-10 and had blooms in 10 days. :~)
