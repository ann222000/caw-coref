Has anyone had any experience with Mason before? I've only just discovered it and I'm a little unsure what to make of it in terms of comparison.

I mean, is it a framework comparible to Cake or Symfony? It doesn't seem to be a CMS comparible to Drupal or Expression Engine.

My inital impression is it's just a framework that facilitates the insertion of Perl into HTML docs.

Cheers
Aaron

Mason is an embedded scripting/template engine with extra knobs
attached. It is to the Perl world what Smarty is to the PHP world,
although it does more, and predates all PHP frameworks by many years.
scoop.co.nz used it for a while, as did large sites like salon.com,
and del.icio.us.

One way of looking at it is almost doing the same thing that PHP
itself does - ie: embedded scripting language / making Cpan libraries
available to HTML templates the same way that PHP makes C libraries
available.

Your best comparison would be ASP or raw PHP without any framework, more
or less.  Mason does very little to support you beyond those basic
facilities.
