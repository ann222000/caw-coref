Fifteen, 20 years ago, I ran into OU softball coach Michelle Thomas;
she was somewhat harried. Thomas had just come from a goofy
conversation with a parent of one of her players.
Meddling parents on the college softball scene? No way, I said.

Way, said Thomas. And not just in softball. Baseball, track, tennis,
hoops, football. Not even Barry Switzer, she said, was immune to stage
parents. Only difference, Switzer had a battalion of lieutenants to run
interference from such nonsense.

Which brings us to Mitch Mustain, the Arkansas quarterback flash who is
fleeing the Ozarks and reportedly considering a visit to the crimson
campus.

Bob Stoops should get out of town before the airport closes for snow.
Drop his cell phone in a drawer and pull it out when Mustain has landed
in another port. Don't touch this quarterback with a 10-foot crossbar.

Mustain might be a good kid, and there's probably plenty of blame to go
around for all the crazy stuff happening in the hills, but parental
intervention has no place in college football. Or any other kind, for
that matter, when it comes to football

Parents of the Springdale trio - Arkansas freshmen who joined coach
Gus Malzahn in jumping from high school to the Razorbacks - have
turned Fayetteville into a firestorm.

The parents of Mustain, tight end Ben Cleveland and flanker Damian
Williams expressed alarm over "the direction of the program" in a
December meeting with athletic director Frank Broyles. They spoke of
dismay over the lack of passing in Arkansas' offense. They issued
statements in which they all agreed the head coach should have the
final say on football matters, which was mighty darn big of them.
Mustain, in a book on Springdale's 2005 football team, ripped Arkansas
coach Houston Nutt.

This isn't little league. Isn't YMCA ball. Isn't even Springdale High
School, not that parents should ever have a say in whether the hometown
team runs off tackle or tries a Boise State flea flicker.

This is big-boy football. It has no place for parents dismayed because
Little Johnny isn't throwing or catching enough passes.

For crying out loud, how far will this madness go?

Rick Cleveland, father of Ben, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette "we
would never have committed here knowing that this was the offense,
because we know our boys wouldn't be happy."

Happiness should be winning football. Happiness should be the best
Arkansas season since 1977, when the Hogs went 11-1 and won the Orange
Bowl. These Razorbacks won the SEC West, a much stouter achievement
than Arkansas' 1995 and 2002 division title, since LSU and Auburn now
are top-10 teams.

Does Stoops want to step into this mess? Bad enough when parents gripe
about playing time. Now they're griping about style of play?

These guys were freshmen. Time was, no coach, much less athletic
director, would listen to the complaints of a yearling. Do your job,
try hard and maybe patience would pay off.

That was then. This is now. Now 10-year-olds play 100 baseball games in
a summer, and football players change high schools the way they change
their shirts, and 13-year-olds have personal trainers in every sport
from hoops to golf.

Now, parents raise children to believe they are the center of the
universe. Now, parents assault youth-league umpires and demand playing
time for their precious angel and treat an 11-year-old ballgame like
it's Game 7 of Red Sox-Yankees.

Mitch Mustain a Sooner? Sounds like a package deal. No thanks.

He hit it on the head, didn't he?
