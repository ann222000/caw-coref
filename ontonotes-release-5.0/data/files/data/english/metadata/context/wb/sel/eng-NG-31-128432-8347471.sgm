Virginia registry to list dangerous dogs up and running
By STEVE SZKOTAK
Associated Press Writer
July 3, 2007

RICHMOND, Va. -- Dee Dee is listed. So are Fototo, Buster and Griz.

The four are among the earliest entries to Virginia's dangerous dogs registry.

The Roanoke-area dogs have been deemed dangerous by the courts or local officials, which adds their names to a database allowing Virginians to locate threatening dogs that may be prowling their neighborhood.

The registry was created by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services under legislation passed by the 2006 General Assembly. It was part of a package of measures enacted following highly publicized incidents in which dogs killed or maimed people.

The office of the state veterinarian will maintain the registry, which will allow users to search by locality or ZIP code to locate dogs that have been found to be dangerous. Owners of these dogs will also have to heed other rules to keep their pet.

A check Tuesday of the registry found nine listings. Each included the dog's name, its owner and address. Some listings provide photographs of the offending animal.

The registry also includes a dossier on the dog. Buster, for instance, is a 4-year-old male pit bull that has had his rabies shots and has been neutered. It also lists a contact for the animal control officer.

Owners of dogs found to be dangerous also must confine the animal to a shelter such as a fenced run; spay or neuter the dog; and post $100,000 liability insurance. When taken off the owner's property, the dog must be on a leash and wearing a muzzle.

The state veterinarian, Dr. Richard Wilkes, said guessing the ultimate number of dogs in the registry would be &quot;a shot in the dark.&quot; He said new state law, however, has clearly outlined what constitutes a dangerous dog, eliminating any local inconsistencies.

A dog can been declared dangerous if it bites, attacks or causes any type of injury to a person or an animal, provided the dog is not protecting its owner, Wilkes said. Dogs assigned to police departments are exempt.

Wilkes said the registry is intended to inform neighbors and help parents educate their children to be mindful of strange dogs.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals backed Virginia's efforts to control dangerous dogs to encourage responsible ownership.

&quot;This is a measure we see as protective of the dog as well as the community at large,&quot; said Daphna Nachminovitch, director of PETA's domestic animal department.

The registry and related laws involving dangerous dogs were primarily inspired by the fatal mauling in March 2005 of an 82-year-old Spotsylvania County woman by a neighbor's three pit bulls. Dorothy Sullivan was attacked by the roaming dogs while walking her Shih Tzu, Buttons, in her front yard in Partlow. Buttons was also killed.

Sullivan's family collected thousands of signatures on a petition promoting stricter dog laws, ultimately resulting in legislation imposing tough penalties on dog owners whose pets seriously injure others.

I personally object to the way this law was amended a
few yrs ago and to this registry being published.

For instance, if you're out walking your dog and a
loose cat comes along, and your dog hurts it, then
your dog can be labelled dangerous.

&quot;Dangerous dog&quot; means a canine or canine crossbreed
that has bitten, attacked, or inflicted injury on a
person or companion animal that is a dog or cat, or
killed a companion animal that is a dog or cat.
However, when a dog attacks or bites a companion
animal that is a dog or cat, the attacking or biting
dog shall not be deemed dangerous (i) if no serious
physical injury as determined by a licensed
veterinarian has occurred to the dog or cat as a
result of the attack or bite, (ii) if both animals are
owned by the same person, (iii) if such attack occurs
on the property of the attacking or biting dog's owner
or custodian, or (iv) for other good cause as
determined by the court. No dog shall be found to be a
dangerous dog as a result of biting, attacking, or
inflicting injury on a dog or cat while engaged with
an owner or custodian as part of lawful hunting or
participating in an organized, lawful dog handling
event. &quot;

I have a friend who does Greyhound rescue - greys have
a high prey drive. Foster mom was walking her grey,
and woman with small fluffy dog came walking toward
her with no control over small fluffy dog (on flexi).
Foster mom of greys called out to her to please not
bring her dog close, please. She tried to steer grey
away, owner of small fluffy dog let dog follow closer
and grey thrashed it, injuring it badly.
Think about those types of situations.

It is true, Colleen, but we have had severe injuries inflicted by dogs in the dog park. Unfortunately, there is no backup assistance for the monitors or Reston Dogs. Not long ago, we had a very severe attack by a Dobie on a Havanese who was hiding behind his owner. The Havanese was close to death but has survived, with permanent muscle damage to his neck and shoulders. The Dobie was involved in a death shake when forced to let go.

In defense of the Dobie, he was taken from PG Animal Control and was, supposedly, taken from fighters - probably having been used for 'bait'. The new owner nursed him back to health but never retrained. The owner is now taking him to Herndon Dog Park but that is being rectified. Unfortunately, without proper retraining, he is a dangerous animal.

I understand the case with greyhounds, they have to be small prey attentive if they want to survive on the track ... many other dogs like terriers have an innate sense in the same respect. But I think it helps if we know dogs to avoid. I would hate to see one of mine fall prey to another. Lili talks a good talk but she's a wimp and I don't think she would fight back. Last year, a husky went after her in the park and Oz came running over to 'save her'. The husky backed him across the park and bit next to his eye. Oz isn't a fighter either [thank God as I wouldn't want to see that]. The case of your friends grey is one of those ridiculous things, not their fault but the stupid owner of the other dog. The grey was defending himself and most likely his owner.

I worry about the lists too but there has to be some way for the rest of us to know.

I remember that, and personally, I think that when you
go to an off leash park, you take risks. Just like
allowing your cat to go outside. If your dog is on a
leash and CAN STILL be found to be dangerous?? That's
ludicrous.
There were already laws in effect that weren't
enforced when this one was put thru.
And did anyone use that law when the Dobe attacked the
havanese? So what good is it?

Well, a couple of things I worry about - one is that
then the homeowners insurance co's deny these people
coverage so dog dies becuz owner has to have insurance
or the dog gets pawned off to yet another home, which
won't help anyone consulting that list.
And there are many dogs not on that list - the dobe,
for instance. We all need to be vigilant about our
personal safety, that of kids, and our animals.
I don't think it has the effect that people want, but
it has consequences that we have yet to see.

You are right in that. If dog owners had to be tested and licensed, we wouldn't have these problems to deal with.
