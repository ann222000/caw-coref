The day is finally here, we will begin switching my sewing stuffand the
computer stuff and in the end I will have my very own dedicated sewing
room. Amazing! I have a wall space that measures 5' x 8' and I want to
use it for a design wall. What's cheap, effective, and will look fairly
decent? Right now I've got a piece of cheap craft felt pinned to a
strip of wall about half that size and my quilt blocks are stuck to
that.

Ok, wade in with the standard excellent ideas. &lt;BG&gt;

I have tried many, many things.....and finally I have something I like. I
had my DH make one of those quilt hangers that is two narrow boards the
width of the wall.....one lays on top of the other and has screws at the top
to tighten. Instead of  placing a quilt in it....I bought a good quality
flannel sheet, think it was LL Bean and hung it from the quilt hanger. I put
dowels through the hem in the bottom to make it hang straight and flat.

I got the foam insulation sheets at the home improvement store. They are 4'
x 8', and come in various thicknesses. Since it was cheap, I got the 2", the
thickest one they had. I spray glued batting to both sides.

Normally, these lean up against the wall, but if I need to, I can swap them
out or take them to other areas of the house. I love, love, love them.

I was using felt and it was working just fine, until I saw this stuff that
had markings (1 inch grid) on it and thought that it sounded great! Well, I
bought it and nothing stuck to it very well. Soooooooooooooo   my suggestion
is to stick to the felt.

Sunny: Here is what I have ... and like
very much. I bought a 4' x 8' sheet of
that foam insulation board, about 1.5"
thick ... the aqua kind. DH attached to
wall with some bolts and included a thin
washer on the foam board so it won't
slide off. Then I covered it with white
cotton flannel ... maybe it is a poly
blend. I folded top and bottom to size
and tucked over the edges. Long pins,
maybe T-Pins, secure the fabric around 4
edges. If I did this over, I would put a
cheap white or natural muslin on the
board to prevent the aqua from
'shadowing' the flannel. Too long, but I
am too lazy to edit. HTH. Enjoy your new
room!! PAT

This is similar to what I did, but we used two pieces of  the styrofoam
(ours were pink, so no show through problem, although I wondered about
that beforehand too) and used wooden pieces to secure them together on
the back.  I used Hobbs 80/20 to cover it.  After trying at first to
staple the batting to the back (didn't work at all), duck tape on the
back worked the best and has stayed 1 year+ and counting.   Because
it's made with the foam, it can be easily carried from room to room.
My husband made a hanging system for it that I can attempt to explain
if you want to know (my fingers are still thawing out from my walk home
from work so I'm going to keep this short), but it's basically a groove
system with a long piece of wood attached to the wall and another piece
of wood on the back of the design wall.  If you use the google
archives, you'll find a lot of descriptions of people's design walls -
that's how we decided how to make mine.
here's a photo of my wall - http://www.tiny.cc/VU0E8
congrats on the new space!

I have done it wrong twice.  My first was a sheet of leftover paneling
covered with awfully cheap poly terry cloth.  It held blocks very, very well
but I really need a grid.
The 2nd trip through this adventure, I tried the stuff made for a design
wall.  It costs me more than $ 40 to cover the 4 x 8 panel.  The grid is
sort of 2 1/8" squares.  Who the heck decided on that?  And it does Not hold
anything without pins or paste made of leftover spaghetti sauce.  I think
maybe a spray of that quilt basting stuff might help but it would be a royal
pain to carry it outside to spray it.
(Through whining now.)  I love having a design wall.  It helps me create
and sometimes I just put something I love looking at on it.  Eager to see
the rest of the solutions.  Did you say you're going to have a sewing room
of your own?  Polly

Here's another idea for you to ponder. You know those kinda cheap roll-up
bamboo matchstick shades - think Pier One or Cost Plus if there is one near
you. Anyway, wait for a sale or use a coupon to get the best price. What you
are really after is those tough, strong, lightweight top &amp; bottom bamboo
poles (pre-drilled mind you) and all the pulley hardware!! If you carefully
unscrew and remove the pulley hardware &amp; pulley string, you can then cut the
upper &amp; lower threads to get rid of the interior "matchstick" material.
(It's kinda heavy also.) Save it for another project if you'd like, maybe a
floor covering. Once the inner shade is removed, you can replace it with a
nice quality flannel sheet. Simply thread the poles through the top and
bottom hems of the sheet, poke the little holes in the top area for the
hardware to re-attach at the top pole, rethread the pulley string and
waa-laa, you have a flannel roll-up shade!!! It's extremely portable and
lightweight. I take mine to retreats with WIP's still attached, simply hang,
unroll and go.  BTW - buy the shade the correct width for the size of sheet
you are using, ignore the length because it will end up being the length of
your flannel. Sounds like a "duh", but it almost tripped me up once in
making one.

Thank you all, you have given me many excellent ideas to chew on. My DH
has suggested putting cork on the wall.... what do any of you think of
this? (Obviously, I wouldn't be taking it anywhere, LOL). Anyways, I'm
gonna sit back and read all these ideas carefully, ask DH to take a
look, and make my list. It may be a few weeks before I get my room all
squared away, but it will be grand and I will have a design wall. &lt;BG&gt;
BTW, did I tell you I'm getting my own room???

A cheaper and easier version would be to buy a wide vinyl roll-up
shade, remove the vinyl, staple on a flannel sheet, take rod out of
bottom of vinyl and put in bottom of the flannel.  A possibly easier
version would be to unroll the shade and apply the flannel sheet to
the vinyl with a spray adhesive.

Does your DH think you need something to stick pins into? The whole idea of
the design wall (mine's a big piece of felt stuff from Keepsake Quilting,
tacked over wood panelling) is that you can just smooth your blocks onto it
and they stick. Easy to move around until you get the design just right. I'm
not opposed to cork, of course, but make sure there's a way to cover it with
the clingy material of your choice.

Thanks for confirming that this could work. I was sure I had seen someone
post about doing this a long time ago. The new house we are hoping to move
to has a wall of bookcases in the loft I plan on using as my space and I was
thinking of a roll up system for a design wall that could pull down over the
bookshelves when needed.
Geez, we don't even own the place yet and already I want to run out and buy
a blind and a sheet!

Patience, Patience...

enough. Your idea would work great in my studio which on a couple occassions

My design wall is a piece of foam board covered with felt (the felt is
stapled to the back).  I can stick blocks up on the board or pin them if I so
desire.  When we made my studio, David came up with this idea.  The board is
in a light weight wooden frame and I can prop it up on the ledge of the
chalkboard I have.

There is a photo of it in the sewing studio album:
http://new.photos.yahoo.com/mwoz2/albums/

I just took a quick look at these.  They are very old, I really should update
those.  Of course, that means I need to take new photos, then figure out how
to get them onto my laptop since the thieves, while they did not take the
camera because it was upstairs, took the cradle and USB cord to transfer from
camera to 'puter.

The only time I use pins on my design wall is when I have the design
finalized, and I don't want my "helpers" to rearrange things. Otherwise,
I just stick them up. My design wall is a large piece of Warm &amp; Natural
cotton batting, stapled to a 1"x2" piece of wood, 6' long. This is then
hung by hook and eye, mounted to the ceiling moulding. I thought I might
want to be able to take it down... but that's never happened. ;-P

&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; nice quality flannel sheet. Simply thread the poles through the top and
&gt;&gt;&gt; bottom hems of the sheet, poke the little holes in the top area for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; hardware to re-attach at the top pole, rethread the pulley string and
&gt;&gt;&gt; waa-laa, you have a flannel roll-up shade!!! It's extremely portable and
&gt;&gt;&gt; lightweight. I take mine to retreats with WIP's still attached, simply
&gt;&gt;&gt; hang,
&gt;&gt;&gt; unroll and go.  BTW - buy the shade the correct width for the size of
&gt;&gt;&gt; sheet
&gt;&gt;&gt; you are using, ignore the length because it will end up being the length
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your flannel. Sounds like a &quot;duh&quot;, but it almost tripped me up once in
&gt;&gt;&gt; making one.

Howdy!

My design wall is on the living room floor.
..oh, wait, my design wall IS the living room floor.
&lt;g&gt;

This means I have to clean the floor before I throw down blocks..
er..carefully place my well-planned designs on the floor,
which is not a bad thing; even Casual Housekeepers will clear &amp; clean
the floor for a good cause.  &lt;g&gt;
The hardwood flooring makes a lovely backdrop for any fabric,
I can slide around the fabric so easily, re-place and re-submit the
ideas as many times as it takes, the lighting is good so I can
actually see what I'm doing, and I can leave the project right there
until I'm ready to move it (take digital photos of new design layout
before taking another breath!).  My designing process usually takes
a day or less so I'm Finished before the floor is required for anything
else, but I'm not done until I'm durned good&amp;ready.
Of course, Stanley dog is NOT allowed in that room during this creative
endeavor and he responds well to the "Out!" command when I can tell that
he's just thinking about taking that next step.  There are no small children
or clumsy-footed visitors in the front room, either.
And I can work in the heart of my home.

YMMV

&gt; My design wall is a piece of foam board covered with felt (the felt is
&gt; stapled to the back).  I can stick blocks up on the board or pin them if I so
&gt; desire.  When we made my studio, David came up with this idea.  The board is
&gt; in a light weight wooden frame and I can prop it up on the ledge of the
&gt; chalkboard I have.

&gt; There is a photo of it in the sewing studio album:
&gt; http://new.photos.yahoo.com/mwoz2/albums/

&gt; I just took a quick look at these.  They are very old, I really should update
&gt; those.  Of course, that means I need to take new photos, then figure out how
&gt; to get them onto my laptop since the thieves, while they did not take the
&gt; camera because it was upstairs, took the cradle and USB cord to transfer from
&gt; camera to 'puter.

Ok, I'm a bit weird this way.  My design wall is whatever big open
space I can find at the moment.  However, what I do is buy the batting
for the size quilt I want to make and pin it up on the wall.  Then I
put blocks up on the batting itself until I have it just the way I
want!  So not only am I storing the batting and getting the wrinkles
out of the batting, I'm also adjust my quilt top to make sure I'm
getting it the right size!

I do have a small piece of leftover batting hanging in another spot on
a wall to put up a block or two of long-term projects that I can just
leave up for inspiration.

There might be a drawback to this one,
Marilyn. If you have a bunch of quilt
pieces on the surface, but need to
access the book case what happens to the
design? WOuld you roll up the shade with
the pieces on it, then roll it out
again? If so, would they stay neat and
in position?

I did a combination - I used foam board like others have mentioned but
attached it 'non-permanently' with hooks on the wall near the ceiling
like you......not that I want to take it down of course!

Mine do on the bamboo/sheet/pulley string setup. Since it rolls from the
bottom up, it can be raised as much as needed. If it is a large and/or
complex project, I might put a pin in the pieces, parallel to the roll up
bars, but my projects are Very Portable.

Hmmm... good question
I guess I was thinking that I would be able to just roll it up or even lift
it away from the bookcase, get what I wanted and let it back down.
If the pieces cling fairly well, I'm thinking that rolling it up with pieces
still on shouldn't be too big a problem.  Less trouble-some than having to
pick them up off the floor cause the grandchildren are coming, or I'm
feeling guilty for locking the dogs out.
Guess I should just make sure that the books I reference most often are not
behind my design wall!
Thanks for making me think about it.

I stapled fleece to a vinyl shade and I could roll it up with blocks on it
and it worked fine.

Since my stash shelving is now wider than the 72" shade I had, I was going
to make Roman shades using fusible fleece backed with blackout fabric to
cover up my stash and serve as a design wall, but it occurs to me now that I
wouldn't be able to fold it up and hope to keep any blocks on it. Hmmm, back
to the rollup shade. I'm glad I didn't already make them.

My design wall IS a roll up blind, sort of. I bought an empty blind roller
(about $6) and attached a flannel backed tablecloth (another $6) to it (it's
only fairly small). It rolls up and everything stays in place. If anything,
it would get squished more into place by the pressure of the roll of "wall".
