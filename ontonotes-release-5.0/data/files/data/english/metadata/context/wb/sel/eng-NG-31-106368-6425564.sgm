Last time, we didn't come up with a name until about 3 hours before I
went into labor.  I'm trying to avoid that scenario this time.  ;)
I've got a girl name (although DH hasn't given final approval), but
yet again I'm stuck on boy names -- I'm not sure why I find them
harder!!

Anyway, our last name begins with an R and ends with a -son, so that
cuts out a first name that ends in on/an/en etc.  (like Branden, for
ex.).  I'm pretty opposed to a first name beginning with an "R".  I'd
like to avoid one beginning with "M" since we already have a Micah,
but that's not set in stone.  I'd also like to avoid another Old
Testament name; I love them, but I don't want to end up being one of
those families with a Jonah, a Micah, a Nahum and a Habakkuk.  ;)  I
*would* go with Shiloh if certain annoying celebrities hadn't stolen
it from me (we should have conceived LAST year!!).  And finally, I
think we'll probably go with Kenji for a middle name, which would mean
avoiding a first name ending in an "ee" sound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm starting to figure out why boy names are harder.  :P

Anyway, I'd love any suggestions!!!

Emily,
So what types of names do you tend to like?  Micah is a sort of uncommon
name, at least that I know of, so I'm guessing that you don't want to name
your next son William or John.  Do you tend to favor uncommon names, or very
very old fashioned names?

Emily,
It seems to me that you could stick with the "biblical" bent on your name
choices, but not be so unusual as "Nahum and a Habakkuk" -- (I think you
were joking with those).  My point is that there are other names from the
Old or New Testament that don't seem obviously biblical, at least not to me.
But the two names would "go" together, since they are both from the same
source.

For example...

Aaron
Abraham, Abram
Adam
Amos
Asher
Benjamin
Caleb
Elijah
Ezra
Gabriel
Gideon
Isaac
Isaiah
Jacob
Jared
Jeremiah
Joel (who uses that any more!)
Jonas
Josiah
Nehemiah
Samson
Saul
Simeon
Simon
Tobias

Now, the Kenji middle name sort of throws me, partly because my dh used to
have his hair cut by a small Japanese guy named Kenji.  I'm guessing you
chose it because of the meaning?  It has a lovely meaning.  What is Micah's
middle name?  I'm going to pretend your last name is Robinson.

Micah Robinson and his brother

Asher Kenji Robinson
Caleb Kenji Robinson
Isaac Kenji Robinson
Isaiah Kenji Robinson
Jacob Kenji Robinson
Jared Kenji Robinson
Joel Kenji Robinson
Josiah Kenji Robinson
Tobias Kenji Robinson

I sort of like the hard C or K sound with Kenji as the middle name -- Caleb
Kenji -- so maybe another hard C like Connor or an interesting K name could
work.

I also sort of like the names that start with J, so there is the second J
sound in Kenji.

I don't know if that helps.  It certainly is a challenge, but nothing
undoable!

Jamie, you're the best!  I actually love the name Josiah (although DH
nixed that when I brought it up the first time)... the reason I don't
want to go TOO Old Testament-y is because it reminds me of very
fundamentalist families and I don't want to be too closely associated
with that community. I admit, this is pretty lame of me.  One of the
reasons I liked "Micah" so much was because it does recall my own
evangelical upbringing, but Micah was a really progressive prophet who
agitated on behalf of the poor.  ;)  And that's also why I like Shiloh
--  it's not one of the common church-y picks.  Darn you,
Brangelina...

Kenji is because my mom's family is Japanese and I want at least one
of my kids to have a Japanese name.  I'd go with a family name, but I
didn't want to saddle the poor soul with my grandpa's name,
"Toshisharu."  And "Toshi" sounded too kiddy-anime-y for me.

Tobias... I like Tobiasl.  :)

I like I &amp; J names, and love Isaac, but I'm not mad on Isaac &amp; Micah.... I
do however like Jared Kenji, and like  Jamie, I'm using Robinson as my
example, I think Jared Robinson is very cool :) My daughter has the initials
JK (Jessica Kate) and a lot of people commenton that being cool too :)...

Also from Jamie's list, I think Tobias Kenji is a really good name!! Has
quite a modern funky sound, so you won't sound like the people you're trying
not be, and still has the parts you want in it - in fact, the more I say it,
the more I like it!!

Emily,
Where you aware of the meaning of the name? www.babynamer.com lists the
following meanings...

healthy second son
healthy next son
peaceful and modest
wise second son

I just thought those were exceptionally appropriate.

As far as names go, make a list of 5 or 6 that you would consider, and see
if dh can pick any of them that he'd like.  Or make him make a list of his
top 5-6, and see if there are any that are similar.

Good luck!

Well for me, in my experience, Joel is a name that I didn't know was from
the bible.  To me, it's a very 70's name.  That's why I singled it out.
Many of the rest of the names seem much more used and current.  Not quite
trendy, but certainly more commonly used than Joel in the past 10 years.

I guess I should clarify -- In the SF Bay Area, Oakland, Berkeley, etc,
there are lots of more unusual less commonly used names, and I can guarantee
you that if you looked at 10 preschol classes you'd find at least one of
every name on that list, except probably Joel, although I wouldn't bet on
it!

Asher, Caleb, Isaac, Isaiah, Jacob, Jared, Joel, Josiah, Tobias

&gt;&gt; although that's not the same, is it!  I mean, it's not an unusual name,
&gt;&gt; just not common around these parts any more.

&gt; I think many of the names you listed are in that category, there are quite
&gt; a few were I wouldn't be able to think of any, particularly as first
&gt; names, so it seemed odd to single Joel out.

&gt; Last time, we didn't come up with a name until about 3 hours before I

&gt; I've got a girl name (although DH hasn't given final approval), but
&gt; yet again I'm stuck on boy names -- I'm not sure why I find them
&gt; harder!!

&gt; Anyway, our last name begins with an R and ends with a -son, so that
&gt; cuts out a first name that ends in on/an/en etc.  (like Branden, for
&gt; ex.).  I'm pretty opposed to a first name beginning with an &quot;R&quot;.  I'd
&gt; like to avoid one beginning with &quot;M&quot; since we already have a Micah,
&gt; but that's not set in stone.  I'd also like to avoid another Old
&gt; Testament name; I love them, but I don't want to end up being one of
&gt; those families with a Jonah, a Micah, a Nahum and a Habakkuk.  ;)  I
&gt; *would* go with Shiloh if certain annoying celebrities hadn't stolen
&gt; it from me (we should have conceived LAST year!!).  And finally, I
&gt; think we'll probably go with Kenji for a middle name, which would mean
&gt; avoiding a first name ending in an &quot;ee&quot; sound.

&gt; Hmm, perhaps I'm starting to figure out why boy names are harder.  :P

&gt; Anyway, I'd love any suggestions!!!

HI -
Looks like you're into special names. Thought of any Israeli names??
I also have a daughter, she's gonna be 2 this coming week. We had to
look for a gift for all the grandpas/grandmas etc.. for the upcoming
holiday (passover) so I found this amazing site and I made a beautiful
calender for the folks w/pics of my daughter. It came out so pretty so
I highly recommend!! Try it out, www.imgaineyourphotos.com I put in
TEST 5 in the place and it gave me a 30% discount. Let me know how it
goes w/the names. I might have a few good suggestions for you..
Candy.

&gt;&gt; hmm, we have friends who's first child is Micah (also an unusual name,
&gt;&gt; he's the only other Micah I know), who's 2nd child is Joel, we also have
&gt;&gt; friends in England with a 7yr old called Joel, so I'm not convinced Joel
&gt;&gt; is any less common than any of the other names you suggest.

&gt;&gt; Emily, I like classic NT names, such as James, Matthew etc. both of which
&gt;&gt; seem to fit with the combo you have.

&gt; I personally haven't heard of a single baby named Joel in a bazillion

Well unless your husband, your friend's husband, and those customers are 5
years old or under, I'd say that it WAS pretty popular (born in the 70's or
earlier perhaps?), but isn't as much today.

Easiest way to find out - cool little gadget too

http://babynamewizard.com/namevoyager/lnv0105.html

Joel was ranked 125th in 2005 (out of what I'm not sure) but it seems to
have peaked in the 80s sometime and although going downhill, it's still
up there in popularity.

interesting, I did my kids names, also in 2005, Nathanael is 451 (I bet the
other spelling is more common), Ada is 798. Even the more common spelling,
Nathaniel, is 69th, it doesn't make Joel sounds uncommon to me.

I checked mine and my husbands name, DH is Andrew, I had accidently left
girls checked, scarily in the 70s and 80s it makes it into the top 1000
girls names! (it's 6th in 2005 for boys). Anne was 437 and seems to be
having a resurgance.

Jamie is right that Joel is on the decrease, but only from popular to
moderately popular.

Yep, that's why I like it!!  ;)  I think the name meanings also are
helping persuade DH, who didn't really like Kenji when I first

Wow, "Micah" is on a HUGE upswing -- .  We thought we were being
pretty original with it, but ever since he was born, I've run into
more and more Micahs.

I also noticed Ada has a slight upswing, but it was so uncommon that even a
slight upswing isn't much, the data is from the US and we haven't met any
Ada's spelt that way, though we have met some Aidas, but according to this
that is less common now, though in the 70s it was the more common spelling,
but not before or since. If I'd have had to guess, I may have put that the
other way round.

&gt; Emily,
&gt; It seems to me that you could stick with the &quot;biblical&quot; bent on your name
&gt; choices, but not be so unusual as &quot;Nahum and a Habakkuk&quot; -- (I think you
&gt; were joking with those).  My point is that there are other names from the
&gt; Old or New Testament that don't seem obviously biblical, at least not to
&gt; me. But the two names would &quot;go&quot; together, since they are both from the
&gt; same source.

&gt; For example...

&gt; Aaron
&gt; Abraham, Abram
&gt; Adam
&gt; Amos
&gt; Asher
