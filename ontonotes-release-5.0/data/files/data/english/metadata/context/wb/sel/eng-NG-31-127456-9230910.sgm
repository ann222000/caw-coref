&gt; Half price at 'The Works', but I don't know if that's a UK-wide chain.

I'm fairly certain this is the case - there was one in Swansea last time I
looked and I walked past one in Sheffield today.

The sign rather surprised me, actually, since The Works seem to mostly sell
remaindered books and art supplies. Presumably MM hasn't been out long
enough to be remaindered, so it's mildly puzzling...

I was surprised to see MM in it as well. I think they sell anything they
can discount - which seems to be the case for MM. I just hope PTerry is
still getting a proper royalty from all these discounted volumes.

Usually the versions in The Works are defects if not remaindered, check
whether the name's printed upside-down on the spine or something.

Hmm, I'm sure they've got a branch in Chelmsford too. I'll have to
go there today and have a look.

Good point, although if they were produced deliberately it'd be odd
for them to be sold at a discount.

You'd be surprised at what The Works sells.  A neighbour of mine found
Ian Rankin's 'Exit Music' in there the other day (which as far as I
know has only just come out), and I found 'India with Sanjeev Bhaskar'
there for ?9.99.  (But didn't buy it, as I'd ordered it from the
library)

My local The Works used to be a good place for finding craft books I
was after - two otherwise expensive embroidery books and one about
bead jewellery come to mind.  They're not so good for that sort of
thing any more, though.

I bought a cheap Sudoku book from them, a couple of months back.  I like
Sudoku.  I like the way that there is just one solution for any given
puzzle.

Only in the first half dozen puzzles in this book, four of them did
/not/ have unique solutions.

In solving the very first one, I found myself at the point where there
two pairs of squares left unresolved, each pair was in a major square,
same row, same pair of numbers superpositioned in both cases, and the
pair members vertically aligned with their counterparts.  Which, as any
Sudokuhead will realise if I've described it correctly, means it could
be either way round.  One of the others was even worse, with three
separate mutually-unsolvable combinations of cells with even more
complex self-dependencies.

Best guess is that someone took a valid solution and wiped digits off
'to taste', without checking the result.  (If it was caused by a typo in
the puzzle, then the same typo was in the solution, which gave one of
the valid answers and other numbers that were pre-filled or could be
solved for.

The worst thing is that there are many ways to skimp and save on Sudoku
puzzles.  One of the easiest is to take an existing puzzle (and,
simultaneously, the solution) and perform some or all of the following
transformations:

1) Interchange some or all digits for others (and/or letters, symbols,
if you want it to look &quot;exotic).
2) Shuffle the three minor columns/rows with each other, within their
own major column/row set.
3) Shuffle the major column/rows around.

(At one point I was analysing how many 'core' Sudoku puzzles there could
be, if any two puzzles related by the above transformations could be
considered one.  But I never did get around to completing this...  And I
suspect it would take a mind greater/more dedicated than mine to do
anyway.  ;)

Anyway, not to defame The Works, at all.  It wasn't them that created
the book.  (And I doubt they've got a QC procedure along the lines of
&quot;ensure this book's puzzles are soluble before bringing it in to sell&quot;. ;)

I think I may have had the same Sudoku book when I was being
kept in hospital a couple of years ago. I share your
frustration.

&gt; Now I'm worried  :-)  but I haven't read much of the book so far, and
&gt; I haven't (yet) noticed any problems. If there are any defects - I've
&gt; kept the receipt, and I'm not averse to returning faulty goods to a
&gt; shop and making it known - politely but strongly - why I am returning
&gt; faulty goods.

They're not allowed to sell unfit for purpose books without labeling
them as such (missing pages, for example), but visual details that don't
affect the contents (like the silver foil spine printing being wrong, or
upside down, or &quot;Marking Monet&quot; or something) at a discount would be
usual. Possibly there is a small notice somewhere in the store that says
some things may be slightly fooked.

Caveat Emptor, up until the point where the Trades Descriptions Act
comes into force, then it's more Caveat venditor.
