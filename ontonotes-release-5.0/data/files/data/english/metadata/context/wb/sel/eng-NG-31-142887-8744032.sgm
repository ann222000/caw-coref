THE THREE WITNESSES

A Response to the Utah Evangel

by
Ogden Kraut

Ever since the restoration of the Gospel of Christ and the re-establishment
of His Church, there have been a multitude of anti-Mormon writers pouring
out their venom against it. Most of this opposition comes from apostate
Mormons. That is understandable because Christ also suffered most from
apostates. Nevertheless, there should be some response made in vindication.
Oliver Cowdery said it best:

Since then our opposer, have been thus kind to introduce our cause before
the public, it is no more than just that a correct account should be given;
and since they have invariably sought to cast a shade over the truth, and
hinder its influence from gaining ascendancy, it is also proper that it
should be vindicated by laying before the world a correct statement of
events as they have transpired from time to time. (Letters by Oliver Cowdery
to W. W. Phelps, p. 15)

This response is very brief in comparison to the volumes that could be
written in answer to the many publications by the anti-Mormons and
ex-Mormons. These people publish newspapers, books, pamphlets and produce
films and videos with a critical and negative attitude of the liberal left
wing of our &quot;modern counterfeit Christians.&quot; their entire gospel is
anti-Mormonism. The following article comes from one such newspaper:

[2]                          The Three Witnesses
by Robert McKay

In the front of every Book of Mormon is found a statement called the
Testimony of Three Witnesses. It is signed by Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer,
and Martin Harris. The Testimony says in substance that these three men saw
an angel holding the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was
supposedly translated.
The Mormon church claims that these three men were sober, steady
individuals who would not lie, who could not be easily fooled, and whose
word was reliable. The facts are otherwise. Rather than being unimpeachable,
these witnesses and their testimony are worthless in determining the truth
about the Book of Mormon.
Oliver Cowdery, the first the three witnesses, was not an upstanding
citizen. Among other things, he was a counterfeiter. A booklet published in
Warsaw, Illinois, states, &quot;Joe (Joseph Smith) told me, that in Ohio he...and
Oliver Cowdery...were engaged in a bogus establishment&quot; (The Adventures and
Experience of Joseph H. Jackson, pg. 15). A letter signed by 84 Mormons
declared that &quot;Oliver Cowdery...united with a gang of counterfeiters&quot;
(quoted in Senate Document 189, pg. 8). In 1838 Cowdery was tried before the
Far West (Missouri) High Council. The eighth charge against him was, &quot;For
disgracing the Church by being connected in the bogus business.&quot; This charge
was &quot;sustained&quot; (History of the Church, Vol. 3, pgs. 16-17).
The LDS church claims that not one of the witnesses ever denied his
testimony. Yet a poem publishes in 1841 asks if it proves &quot;Book of Mormon
not his (God's) word Because denied, by Oliver?&quot; (Times and Seasons, Vol. 2.
pg. 482). Apparently Cowdery wasn't as sure of his statements as Mormons
would like to think.
David Whitmer was also involved in counterfeiting. His character is further
revealed by Joseph Smith's statement that Whitmer was a &quot;dumb ass&quot; (History
of the Church, Vol. 3. pg. 228). Whitmer himself declared, &quot;if you believe
my testimony to the Book of Mormon...then I tell you that in June, 1838, God
spoke to me again by His own voice from the heavens, and told me to
`separate myself from among the Latter Day Saints (sic)...'&quot; (An Address to
All Believers in Christ, pg. 27). According to this statement, if Whitmer's
testimony to the Book of Mormon is true then the LDS church has apostatized.
But the church denies that what Whitmer says here is true, thus casting
doubt on his testimony to the Book of Mormon.
The third witness, Martin Harris, was no better. It was Harris who lost the
116 pages of the book of Lehi, forcing Joseph Smith to start &quot;translating&quot;
all over again. Because of this incident. Harris was called &quot;a wicked man,
Who...has broken the most sacred promises which were made before God&quot;
(Doctrine &amp; Covenants 3:12-13). An affidavit made in 1833 declares, &quot;I have
been acquainted with Martin Harris, about thirty years... his moral and
religious character was such, as not to entitle him to respect among his
neighbors...He was first an orthadox (sic) Quaker, then a Universalist, next
a Restorationer, then a Baptist, next a Presbyterian, and then a Mormon&quot;
(Mormonism Unvailed, pgs. 260-261). An official Mormon publication said of
Harris, &quot;he changed his religious position eight times&quot; after accepting the
Book of Mormon (Improvement Era, March 69, pg. 63). One of the groups he
joined was the Shakers, who had their own &quot;latter day scripture.&quot; At one
point Harris claimed that he believed in the Shakers more strongly than he
did his own testimony to the Book of Mormon (Martin Harris - Witness and
Benefactor to the Book of Mormon, pg. 52).
All three of these witnesses were excommunicated from the Mormon church.
Joseph Smith wrote, &quot;Such characters as...David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, and
Martin Harris, are too mean to mention, and we had liked to have forgotten
them&quot; (History of the Church, Vol. 3, pg. 232).
Thus we see that the Testimony of Three Witnesses was signed by men who
were unreliable, who denied their testimony, and who were condemned by those
they aided. To hold these three men and their testimony up to the world as
proof that the Book of Mormon is of God is analogous to letting one
rattlesnake vouch for another. They cannot be trusted.
THE UTAH EVANGEL
Aug.-Sept. 1985

[3] To recap, then, Robert McKay's article makes the following charges
against the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon:

1. Oliver Cowdery denied his testimony of the Book of Mormon.
2. Oliver Cowdery was a counterfeiter.
3. David Whitmer was a counterfeiter.
4. David Whitmer was told by God to leave the Saints, inferring that the
Church had apostatized.
5. Martin Harris's &quot;moral and religious character was such, as not to
entitle him to respect among his neighbors, . . . &quot; and also that &quot;he
changed his religious position eight times....&quot;
6. The three witnesses were unreliable, denied their testimony, and were
condemned by those they aided. Their testimony is like &quot;letting one
rattlesnake vouch for another. They cannot be trusted.&quot;

Oftentimes such accusations are false, overemphasized, or without real
proof, as is the case with the above charges. Without delving extensively
into the subject, here are a few explanations and clarifications that should
be considered in response to these charges by McKay.

Charge 1. Oliver Cowdery denied his testimony of the Book of Mormon.

In addition to the testimony given in the Book of Mormon, Cowdery made
similar positive statements even after he had left the LDS Church. The
following report was printed in 1910 by Judge C. M. Nielsen of Salt Lake
City. He stated that while he was traveling as a missionary in Minnesota
during the year of 1884, he met a wealthy farmer who became especially
interested in him because he came from Utah. The farmer stated that when he
was 21, an interesting event occurred at the time he was working on his
father's farm in Michigan. On one of his days off, he went to town where the
following incident occurred, as retold by Judge Nielsen:

&quot;Near the courthouse I saw a great many people assembling and others
walking that way, so I went over to see what was up. There was a jam in the
courtroom, but being young and strong, I pushed my way close up to the
center, where I found the prosecuting attorney addressing the court and jury
in a murder trial. The prosecuting attorney was Oliver Cowdery, and he was
giving his opening address in behalf of the state. (After he was
excommunicated from the Church, Oliver Cowdery studied law, practicing in
Ohio, Wisconsin and then Michigan, where he was elected prosecuting
attorney.) After Cowdery sat down, the attorney representing the prisoner
arose and with taunting sarcasm said: `May it please the court and gentlemen
of the jury, I see one Oliver Cowdery is going to reply to my argument. I
wish he would tell us something about that golden [4] Bible that Joe Smith
dug out of the hill; something about the great fraud he perpetrated upon the
American people whereby he gained thousands of dollars. Now he seems to know
so much about this poor prisoner, I wonder if he has forgotten all about Joe
Smith and his connection with him.' The speaker all the while sneering and
pointing his finger in scorn at Cowdery in the hope of making him ridiculous
before the court and jury.
&quot;Everybody present began to wonder if they had been guilty of making such
a mistake as choosing a Mormon for prosecuting attorney. Even the judge on
the bench began looking with suspicion and distrust at the prosecuting
attorney. The prisoner and his attorney became elated at the effect of the
speech. People began asking, `Is he a Mormon?' Everybody wondered what
Cowdery would say against such foul charges.
&quot;Finally Oliver Cowdery arose, calm as a summer morning. I was within
three feet of him. There was no hesitation, no fear, no anger in his voice,
as he said: `May it please the court, and gentlemen of the jury, my brother
attorney on the other side has charged me with connection with Joseph Smith
and the golden Bible. The responsibility has been placed upon me, and I
cannot escape reply. Before God and man I dare not deny what I have said,
and what my testimony contains as written and printed on the front page of
the Book of Mormon. May it please your honor and gentlemen of the jury, this
I say, I saw the angel and heard his voice--how can I deny it? It happened
in the daytime when the sun was shining bright in the firmament; not in the
night when I was asleep. That glorious messenger from heaven, dressed in

My parents aren't religious at all. I was led by the Lord by the Holy Spirit
that the Book of Mormon is true a few years ago. Like Paul said no man knows
the things of man but by the spirit of man and no one knows the things of
God but by the Spirit of God.

Joseph Smith said in so many words that only true religion is the one that
has the Priesthood and gets direct revelation from God. The devil raises
many fools and impostors to confuse people from the true prophets of God.

At least you were led by SOME STRANGE SPIRIT, although not by the
Lord.

God never contradicts Himself (lies).  Your god seems to do that a
lot.

Paul also said:

1 Thess 5:19-23

19 Do not quench the Spirit. 20 Do not despise prophecies. 21 Test all
things; hold fast what is good. 22 Abstain from every form of evil.

NKJV

He told us that SCRIPTURE was how we do that:

2 Tim 3:16-17

16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly
equipped for every good work.
NKJV

If you TEST the so-called &quot;proof-test&quot; that smitty gave in his bom,
the &quot;pray to see if it is true&quot; test. . .you find the &quot;test&quot; only
works some of the time, about 50%.

IF you TEST the bom by the BIBLE (that we already KNOW to be
SCRIPTURE), the bom fails misurably, the d&amp;c fails even worse, and the
worst of smitty's fiction, the pgp (supposedly &quot;translated from a
common funeral papirus, proven to be a sham) is the worst failure of
all!

But some (like YOU) can be led to believe anything at all!
Like PT Barnum once said, &quot;There's a sucker born every minute!&quot;

Joseph smith made up his priesthood from his imagination, and his
so-called &quot;revelation from God&quot; contradicts what God has already said,
all over the place.  His so-called &quot;revelation from his god&quot; also
contradicts ITSELF all over the place.

So why would anyone believe such pathetic dung?
