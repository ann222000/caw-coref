Hi All

87 prelude 5 spd 1.8L side draft dual carbs with 220000kms on it.  Noticed an
oil leak about a week ago, its dripping from somewhere on the front passenger
side, and drips onto a cross member and some onto the exhaust, creating a
burning smell.

Checked the valve cover seal today, seemed fine, no imperfections.  I did not
replace it, but did put a bead of silicone around it.

The oil also looks like it could be coming from where the head and the block
mate.  I assume this would be indicative of a head gasket failure.  However,
would this diagnosis not also include several other symptoms?  ie coolant in
the oil, oil in the coolant, losing coolant for no reason, etc etc?

Also, where is the PCV valve on this thing?  I couldn't find it amongst all
the mess of vacuum hoses for the carburation system.  I assume it has one
though, even if its not fuel injected?  I thought maybe it would be plugged,
causing excess pressure in the valve cover or crankcase which could bring on
the oil leak.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Terry

PS, after working on this car a bit, my hands do smell like antifreeze.  hmmm.

Oh ya, and I also cleaned the oil covered part of the motor with degreaser, I
will check it tomorrow to see if the leak is any more obvious.
