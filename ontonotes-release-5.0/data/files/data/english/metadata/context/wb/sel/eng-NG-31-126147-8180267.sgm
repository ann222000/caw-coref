Hi all! - from what I understand about the cruises is that it ends up being
a nice way to get a cheap vacation right?  I know you're working on the
cruise but you also have to pay to be there right?  They don't pay you for  your
services in money, just in discounts towards your trip, am I understanding  this
correctly? - Dawn

You normally pay anywhere from $25-40 per day for two people to
cruise. Add in excursion fees and tipping fees and it gets higher- but
it is still a wonderful way to travel.

Just remember...you have to declare the value of the cruise...not what you
PAID, but the VALUE, when you do your taxes!!   Barter is considered income,
so if you get a $3,000 cruise, you have to claim $3,000 in income....

I am not a tax person, however, I would think that being on the boat would
be a requirement to face paint on the boat.... So the cruise is an expense of
working/face painting.  You are doing the gig for free and the cruise line
just providing room and board...  You can not very well get off the boat and
go home at night after you face paint....

You can go ahead and try that, but I wouldn't want to be in your shoes when
the IRS comes knocking!   WHY would you give a cruise line free face
painting?  They aren't a charity.  So why do it?  Because they give you free
room and board.  What's that called?  Barter.  How's barter handled?  As
taxable income.

If you can come up with a really awesome reason why you are face painting
for free on the boat, and if the contract you sign with Sixth Star doesn't
mention that you are getting the room and board IN EXCHANGE for face
painting, MAYBE you could get away with it.  But I wouldn't try!

Best bet...consult a tax expert.  :)

It just so happens I use to be a tax preparer. Unless things have
changed drastically I would say that you have to count the cruise as
income but everything else should be an expense that you can write
off(probably not the alcohol) Also there are some laws regarding
international waters so I recommend checking with IRS.
By the way you can go to www.irs.gov and ask them.

I´m baffled here!  This is basically a holiday.  You wouldn´t declare
any other holiday you had to the taxman so why mention it at all on
your tax return??? I don´t think staff at the tax office will have
time to investigating what holidays face painters went on in the
previous tax year!

Because Sixth Star is PAYING for your holiday in exchange for your painting,
that's why!  You tell me any holiday you just get for free, and I'm there!

Oh, and remember...if you gave Sixth Star your Social Security number, they
ARE reporting it as a barter situation -- especially if you filled out a
W-9.  Don't think they won't -- they don't want to get in trouble with the
IRS, and this is a BUSINESS for them, not a holiday!  So then it is just a
matter of whether it gets caught in any kind of cross-referencing thing by
the IRS computers, or a random audit.

Me?  I don't want the IRS after me...especially since once they catch you
cheating, you'll be on their &quot;keep hassling them&quot; list FOREVER, and they
often go back something like 7 years to make sure all your other returns are
OK.

But then again, I don't take a lot of deductions that other people take,
just because I want to play it safe.  :)

I was being a little lighthearted, however, you can look at the cruise from
several directions..
1.       It was a free gig that you 'just wanted to try out' and the
accommodations that the cruise company supplied were needed to perform the
gig ( THIS  is the same as being provided light, tent, space, parking at an
other gig....etc)... You can not very well go home each night after face
painting.
2.     If you are bartering just to go on the cruise I would considered it
income and I would suspect the cost of getting to the cruise would NOT be
deductible because it is a vacation.

I am not a certified licensed tax person. And I have some one else do my
taxes.....

If I did a face painting cruise I would consider it a business and a
learning experience (much like a convention) and take most ** expenses as
business related.  I would then have by marketing information include the
cruise as a reference, the same as receiving an award for my face
painting.................  However you may want to discuss it with a tax person...  And
YES a business license would be needed to take it as a business expense.

And I have no idea about your guest's status on the cruise.  For me it would
be my husband and he would be taking lots of pictures and video of my face
painting and the people I face painted, and handling most of the logistics
of my FP set-up.  It would be a working vacation. And yes I would take most
of the expenses as a business expenses. And all my pictures, set up, costume
would show up on my web page.  It would be a great learning expense for me....
BUT, you have to make it a learning experience, the same as a convention or
any other educational opportunity.

I paid $512 a class for my master's degree; I believe I would get the same
educational value from a working cruse ship.  Again, my local weekly
newspaper would get my press release when I got home.

I hope this has helped and not made it cloudier,

Any more questions just write back......

Hugs and Laughter from Delaware,

Chris

** = You have to be reasonable; souvenirs, body wraps and off boat
excursions, I think you would have trouble selling to the IRS.

FYI from someone who took a cruise.
Sixth Star does not have your SSN and reports nothing to the IRS.  I
did not report anything to the IRS last year, no expenses or revenue.
It was a vacation for me.

Also, it's my understanding that you pay an adminstrative fee of
something like $30 per day to Sixth Star for each day you are on the
cruise.  How would that come into play with taxes... an agent fee? As
an expense? Or as the fee of the cruise?

hmmm, interesting topic
