&gt; Hey Ooops,

&gt; You've got a lot of sports franchises to follow in Chicago, most of
&gt; them are pretty good too. The BIG question though:

&gt; Cubbies or White Sox?

&gt; I'm an Orioles fan, sigh...nuff said.

&gt; Take care,

&gt; Doc

Hi Doc,
Cubbies or White Sox?
That question is very easy for most Chicago sports fans.
If one lives on the Chicago SOUTH side, it is the White
Sox.  And on the Chicago NORTH side, it is the Cubbies.
And for me?  Not wanting to spill any more detail, I happen
to just like them both!  hehe
And for a little nostalgia Chicago sports fun, that story
regarding the Colts players eating quiche and drinking white
wine was borrowed from our Chicago sports writers gushing
out about an upcoming game between the Chicago Bears
and the San Francisco Niners.  It was something like 150 degrees
below zero on Lake Michigan that edged Soldier Field. And
the Chicago sports writers were gushing out that the Bears would
slaughter the SF Niners because of the extreme temperature
and that the Niners players all ate quiche and drank white wine.
AND THAN the Chicago Bear/ SF Niner game started!
Joe Montana and Jerry Rice turned Soldier Field into a
gladiator blood bath. They had most of the Chicago Bear
players with their throats slit and hung on poles at the middle
of the field.  The Montana/Rice slaughter was so bad that
the Chicago Bears fans were booing their own players.
hehe
Ooops

Cubbies or White Sox?
================
Harry Caray was the Chicago White Sox voice (announcer)
for several years. And than he moved to the Cubbies as
their voice.  Harry Caray breathed Chicago Sports back into
the Cubs. HC is still worshiped on both the Chicago south
and north sides.  Harry Caray is our kind of Chicago sports fan.
Ooops
